1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,483
Rym: It's Monday December 12th 2016.

2
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:12,945
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:15,514
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:23,437
Rym: instant messaging in 2016. cuz last time we talked about this was And it was way better back then.

5
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:25,958
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:32,479
Rym: So I did buy that computer that I've been talking about constantly and there's a bunch of forum threads about it.

7
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:37,918
Rym: I'll make the like Definitive Newegg playlist of exactly what I bought because I tweaked a few things.

8
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:38,320
Rym: playlist.

9
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:41,444
Rym: But you're like the.

10
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:46,076
Rym: the Samsung 960 just came out and it was actually cheaper than the 950 and better.

11
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:54,958
Rym: So there's no reason to buy a 950 Pro and do that m2 SSD unless you find it like less than 280 bucks.

12
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,618
Rym: What you might they might get cheap soon.

13
00:00:58,964 --> 00:01:09,060
Rym: If you're not building computer right now, though the Samsung 950 or 960 will have an evo version which is like the more discounted version and they'll be pretty cheap.

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:18,619
Rym: You'll be able to get out like one terabyte one of those for not that much money like five or six hundred bucks in January Mm-hmm, so it'll be good times.

15
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:22,540
Rym: But I was not gonna buy a video card.

16
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:34,525
Rym: I had sort of planned Originally to take the 770 out of my current computer and stick it in the new computer and buy a 1080 later Because right now actually the 770 is not the primary bottleneck on this computer I'm using now.

17
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,800
Rym: all the other things are the bottleneck.

18
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:47,974
Rym: But then I was looking at the computer and I imagine taking my slightly dusty oldest shit 770 putting it in this nice new computer and then five minutes later.

19
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:52,809
Rym: I just bought a 1080 after doing some research Mm-hmm, and it'll come.

20
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:55,116
Rym: if not today definitely tomorrow's.

21
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,692
Rym: I'm gonna finish the computer probably tomorrow Mm-hmm.

22
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:01,720
Rym: Yeah So what's going on in the life of Scott?

23
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:10,410
Scott: Wake up go to work Make a podcast go home.

24
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:15,117
Scott: Wash your hands wash your hands page Go to bed.

25
00:02:17,864 --> 00:02:18,750
Rym: That was some.

26
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,099
Rym: some football and hockey last night though.

27
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:23,050
Scott: New York is very winning right now.

28
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,280
Scott: everyone else very losing.

29
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,660
Scott: I mean losing more than normal, right?

30
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,132
Scott: Cuz I mean if you're not in New York, you're already losing just by not being New York.

31
00:02:31,273 --> 00:02:37,848
Scott: Yeah, but we're winning Real good right now.

32
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:41,464
Scott: Oh, man, we put the beat we got a shit kicked out of us We got mad injuries.

33
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:48,087
Scott: We put the B team out there like to one or two lines of AHL dudes Yeah, and yet the B team shutting them out.

34
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:52,400
Rym: Yeah, and then Rhonda two nights in a row Giants, right?

35
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,079
Scott: So in the frozen tundra?

36
00:02:55,162 --> 00:02:59,200
Scott: No, the frozen tundras in Green Bay where there was a much more thrilling game.

37
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:07,420
Scott: You know Giants coming out got these Cowboys and the Cowboys all season only lost one game to the Giants.

38
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,579
Scott: They beat everybody else and that the number one had the number one record in the whole Football League, but then Giants again.

39
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:15,285
Scott: Giants beat him again.

40
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:17,273
Scott: So it's like what does that mean?

41
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:20,699
Scott: We're like we lost other games, you know We're not like the greatest.

42
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:25,936
Scott: We won six in a row before but we're not like, you know, like the world.

43
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:27,380
Scott: we're not looking super amazing.

44
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,909
Scott: We got problems But hey, we beat the best team of the year twice.

45
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:38,347
Rym: So the crazy thing about that's how we do was that Rangers were scoring on power plays.

46
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:39,711
Scott: I know they didn't do that last.

47
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:42,660
Rym: that's that's kind of frightening new territory for last year.

48
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:43,551
Scott: They didn't know how to do that.

49
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:47,675
Rym: That was like the one Counterbalancing factors that made them not like the best team.

50
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:48,920
Scott: Well, they learned in the offseason.

51
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:52,039
Scott: We have an extra guy so it's easy to see.

52
00:03:53,342 --> 00:03:58,100
Rym: I thought we should just like really turtle and just sort of pass it around the goal and not actually do anything with it.

53
00:03:58,382 --> 00:04:00,058
Rym: So yeah, the biggest news is probably that.

54
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:04,973
Rym: So for a while people who backed all the new pebble devices.

55
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:11,220
Rym: We're kind of rumbling on Kickstarter like how come no updates hearing rumors things aren't good.

56
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:22,659
Scott: Yeah I didn't know it was up with that because like pebble was one of those things when the very first pebble was Kickstarted and I was like, you know If I it's not too much money if I kickstart that and I never get it.

57
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:27,700
Scott: I'm okay with that because if I do get it, whoa, cuz that was before smartwatches.

58
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,312
Scott: Yeah, I mean there wasn't no Apple watch.

59
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:38,981
Scott: there was no, you know Android wear Right, and it looked like pretty much exactly what I wanted in a smartwatch, which is not what Android wear Apple watch does But it's just.

60
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:43,776
Scott: I just want something that will have a very long battery life.

61
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,100
Scott: So I don't have to deal with it.

62
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,315
Scott: It'll just always work and just show me the time and show me notifications.

63
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:51,780
Scott: I don't take my phone out of my pocket.

64
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:54,964
Scott: Just bonus feature.

65
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:55,988
Scott: I don't even use right.

66
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,734
Rym: I yourself them like if I'm biking.

67
00:04:57,774 --> 00:05:00,282
Scott: or the only other feature I use Navigation.

68
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,065
Scott: I don't use that.

69
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:10,046
Scott: The only other feature I use is could make my music go forward and back and also Remembering things.

70
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:11,560
Scott: No, it's like someone calls me on the phone.

71
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:16,560
Scott: I look and see who it is and I can hang up on them without Right, that's that's all I use it for us anyway.

72
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:19,879
Scott: So I kick-started and it came and I was like, wow, they done it.

73
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:20,684
Scott: And then those.

74
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:21,206
Scott: it was.

75
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:26,352
Scott: the first one though was not a perfect watch by any means Actually, my first one was like messed up and I had to send.

76
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:34,180
Scott: they sent me an RMA new one But they actually sent it and then pebble time came out and it was just so drastically better and perfect.

77
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:36,380
Scott: It was smaller and had a better screen.

78
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:38,040
Scott: It was just better in every way.

79
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,440
Rym: So and the pebble time steel was just like the power watch and I was happy with the pebble time.

80
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:46,440
Scott: So I got one and then I'm like those pebble time two and stuff and I'm like man.

81
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,283
Scott: I got pebble time.

82
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:49,712
Scott: pebble time two is not the significant upgrade.

83
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,205
Rym: I kick-started the pebble time to my Interesting.

84
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:54,268
Rym: So my rationale was one.

85
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:56,094
Rym: the pebble time one was just like spending money.

86
00:05:56,696 --> 00:05:57,780
Rym: was it was real cheap?

87
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,362
Rym: That's the thing.

88
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:09,680
Rym: the problem with smartwatches in general is that they're really expensive devices Yet they don't actually provide that level of it like benefit to your life.

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,147
Scott: I think that they're ridiculously inexpensive.

90
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:15,317
Scott: regular watches are freaking expensive as hell.

91
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:20,660
Scott: if you want one that does You know, it's not just a Casio or whatever, but the Casio will tell the time right?

92
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,185
Rym: It's like 50% of your use case.

93
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:27,364
Scott: like you go you go to the you go to a watch store and it's like I Got watches.

94
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:36,553
Rym: thousand dollars two thousand dollars ten thousand dollars Dollars add zero additional functionality except they tell you like the moon phase or something.

95
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:38,337
Scott: They're gold gold Jerry.

96
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:39,340
Rym: Yeah, it's gold.

97
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:46,340
Rym: But the new one Emily didn't have a smartwatch and I was like, oh well I'll get the new one and I'll just give you my old one because it's still in like perfect condition.

98
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:51,387
Scott: I have a pebble one that still works I assume Yeah So and also have a one that's mad broken.

99
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:57,084
Rym: and also the screen on the time too was just way bigger Which was interesting.

100
00:06:57,104 --> 00:07:00,837
Rym: because your thing because the pebble time the one thing about actually like smaller.

101
00:07:00,857 --> 00:07:01,720
Scott: I don't like those giant.

102
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,819
Rym: Well, so it says the watch is now bigger the screen just goes all the way to the edge.

103
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:11,578
Scott: That's the difference because right now there's like Bigger though, but yeah, there is almost a centimeter of not.

104
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:16,372
Rym: Yeah, there's like a little space six millimeters on each side.

105
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:19,240
Rym: So you're getting like 12 millimeters of more screen total.

106
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:20,625
Rym: Yeah, maybe a whole centimeter.

107
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:23,917
Rym: That's kind of a big deal for a tiny device and the.

108
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:24,740
Scott: I don't need more screen.

109
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,967
Scott: That's enough screen like a little.

110
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:27,617
Scott: I wish they would just shrink the bezel down.

111
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:28,160
Scott: That would be better.

112
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:33,498
Rym: Yeah, well it was color as opposed to the original one, which was nice and it's ink.

113
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:37,320
Rym: So the screen is always on and not using battery.

114
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:38,960
Scott: I mean the pebble time is color.

115
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:47,329
Rym: Yeah, all the pebbles are as opposed to every other smartwatch, which is an actual screen burning through your one-day battery Like I see people talk about.

116
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:49,260
Rym: all those watches run out of battery in the middle of the day.

117
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,196
Scott: No, but you're acting like the pebble time - is color the pebble time?

118
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:52,940
Scott: one wasn't the pebble.

119
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:55,840
Rym: I kind of just digressed into like what I like.

120
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:57,507
Scott: Pebble is not color.

121
00:07:57,808 --> 00:07:57,909
Rym: Now.

122
00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:00,520
Rym: They did make a pebble like the when the pebble time came out.

123
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,094
Rym: They had like updated regular pebbles as well.

124
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:03,979
Scott: Oh, yeah.

125
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:09,060
Rym: So anyway that kick I kick-started a thing and whatever it'll come because I kind of had faith.

126
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:17,933
Scott: It's like this company was already at a point where they went from kick-starting to actually making stuff to actually having a community of Developers to actually have it, you know, like it was a real thing.

127
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:18,877
Scott: They were in stores.

128
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:19,560
Scott: You could buy them.

129
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:21,915
Scott: It's like oh they made it into a real thing.

130
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:22,479
Scott: Good job.

131
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:27,280
Rym: So when I saw people rumbling in the early days like hey, what's going on with pebble?

132
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,584
Rym: I Mostly ignored it.

133
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:33,316
Rym: but then I noticed something because I had like.

134
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:39,546
Rym: there's three watch faces I use on this thing like three of the apps that I installed the minimalist weather one The weather land one.

135
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,212
Scott: I kept getting firmware updates too.

136
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:43,159
Scott: So I assumed that pebble was just rolling right along.

137
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,249
Rym: Yeah, and they kept adding features like they added stuff.

138
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:47,560
Rym: I don't use but they were adding like stuff to the pebble.

139
00:08:47,680 --> 00:09:00,346
Rym: Yeah, but the apps like other than pebble themselves The list of apps and watch faces that the community created for the pebble a long time ago Basically went unchanged.

140
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:04,420
Scott: Well, I think when everyone gets a watch face, they like finally and then they don't look again.

141
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,062
Scott: It's like none of them.

142
00:09:05,142 --> 00:09:06,928
Scott: I got a perfect one.

143
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:07,570
Scott: Which one?

144
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,292
Rym: minimalist weather?

145
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:09,937
Scott: No, I got this one that cost a dollar.

146
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:12,069
Scott: Ah It's perfect.

147
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,839
Scott: But Ben anyway.

148
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,668
Scott: But yeah it's like when you set up a brand new pebble.

149
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:24,780
Scott: you go searching through the watch faces and the apps and you set them all and You pretty much never look at that again ever but I just noticed cuz I thought oh I wonder if anything updated.

150
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:25,340
Rym: I went in there.

151
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,132
Rym: I was looking through like every app just to see like what had happened.

152
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:32,055
Scott: like imagine if like that's your thing like Making and changing watch faces all the time.

153
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:32,800
Scott: That's a weird thing.

154
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,264
Rym: Well, I could.

155
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:38,860
Rym: it's not a good use of your life But I could think of like cool like there were things I would like to do with the smartwatch that it didn't do that.

156
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,575
Scott: Well, I could make a watch face really easily.

157
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:41,059
Scott: Just make one.

158
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,325
Rym: Yeah, not just watching.

159
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:49,120
Rym: this is but other things like for example, I use Strava a lot for running and by the Strava Yeah, but I went and got the app.

160
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,218
Rym: I think I paid a dollar for it so I can start and start a Strava just on the watch without having to pull My phone out and we're great.

161
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,718
Rym: But that app has not been updated since it was written and there's no other app that does that.

162
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:06,113
Rym: Mm-hmm And that ecosystem seemed to have already dried up quite some time ago.

163
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:08,620
Rym: Like no one was buying apps for the pebble.

164
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:10,989
Scott: No, why would you buy apps for your pebble watch?

165
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,351
Scott: It's silly.

166
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:12,980
Scott: It does everything you need to do right out of the box.

167
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,965
Rym: Well, it didn't do the Strava thing.

168
00:10:13,985 --> 00:10:14,830
Rym: I had to pay a dollar for that.

169
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,258
Scott: I paid a dollar for a watch face.

170
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:16,479
Scott: Yeah

171
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:43,940
Rym: But it was the fact that the ecosystem was Pretty much immediately stagnant was a minor warning sign Because that is the exact same thing that happened when the palm when I had the palm pre and that palm OS like there was bunch like it had the same number of apps as like Android and iPhones pretty much like early on and Then like no one ever wrote anymore and then the platform got discontinued like months later.

172
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:49,400
Rym: So, I don't know what smartwatch I'll get when this thing finally dies because I really like this thing.

173
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:53,957
Rym: But the story behind why pebble went down is actually kind of interesting.

174
00:10:53,997 --> 00:11:03,385
Rym: because think about this They had a very popular hardware product that works and a very and they were actually able to manufacture it and sell it To lots and lots of people.

175
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:05,472
Rym: Yeah, cuz I kick-started hardware before.

176
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:12,925
Rym: millions of people have pebble watches most Kick-started like design projects like hardware Kind of garbage.

177
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:19,343
Rym: Yeah, and yet the pebble watch is like super well engineered like the things pretty much invincibles waterproof Like it was great.

178
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:19,965
Rym: Hmm.

179
00:11:20,427 --> 00:11:24,199
Rym: And yeah, they went out of business and did not have a viable business.

180
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:29,074
Scott: Nope, and it seems like they actually sold the watch for not enough money for it.

181
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:29,656
Rym: Yep.

182
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:32,143
Rym: They also probably Didn't like.

183
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:37,440
Rym: the ecosystem was weird because there's this like upper-end ecosystem of people who thought they wanted like I watches.

184
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:39,790
Rym: But that market seems to have dried up too.

185
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:43,044
Rym: Once people realize watches don't do the magic things They expected them to do.

186
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:51,040
Scott: I think the problem with the watches is simply that You know, you look at something like iPhone has this upgrade cycle, right?

187
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,873
Scott: So it's like you buy iPhone and then two years later you buy iPhone.

188
00:11:54,974 --> 00:11:56,740
Scott: years later you buy iPhone you buy a watch.

189
00:11:57,408 --> 00:11:58,339
Scott: That's your watch forever.

190
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,705
Scott: Congratulations, you're not buying another one.

191
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:05,400
Scott: So it's like you make pebbles and everyone buys one and wants one and then you're done.

192
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:11,560
Scott: Well, thus when I kick started Apple watch and everyone buys one who wants one and then you're done.

193
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,285
Scott: You don't make.

194
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:14,340
Scott: you can't keep making money by making more.

195
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,718
Scott: It's like you keep making more of them.

196
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:25,579
Scott: I mean You can't get new people to buy them because everyone who wants one already has one and if you make a new one People are way pissed because they expect to watch to last like their whole lives not a year.

197
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:30,626
Rym: I don't think the smartwatch industry as a whole is really Thought all of that.

198
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:40,380
Rym: through just that you see the whole market like really cooling off rapidly Which is a shame because having a screen that shows you notifications on your wrist is a super big killer app.

199
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:41,329
Scott: It's pretty good.

200
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:42,480
Scott: You don't take your phone in your pocket.

201
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:42,584
Scott: Yeah

202
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:53,289
Rym: but the articles that are coming out about what happened to pebble because they're about my Fitbit who make devices that I See very little value in even

203
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:54,734
Scott: as well you whatsoever

204
00:12:55,076 --> 00:13:01,020
Rym: even despite being An athlete who doesn't spends a lot of time running and tracking stats and all these things.

205
00:13:01,742 --> 00:13:07,220
Rym: My smartwatch and smartphone by themselves already do all that stuff really well.

206
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:10,414
Rym: Fitbit would just be like one more device to buy.

207
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:11,840
Rym: that doesn't give me a lot of value add.

208
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:13,871
Scott: It's like part of a pebble.

209
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:19,295
Rym: Yeah, so Fitbit didn't buy the pebble company as best I can tell.

210
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:20,680
Rym: pebble basically is gone.

211
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:26,144
Rym: Yeah, they bought the pebble staff and not all the staff just like 40% of the staff Apparently the old one.

212
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:32,400
Rym: they only got the software and like app ecosystem people and they ignored all the hardware and UX people.

213
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,049
Scott: They have their own hardware UX people.

214
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:42,035
Rym: They don't need the pebble people Even though I actually think that the hardware and UX was the only unique and good aspect of pebble.

215
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:44,280
Scott: Sure like if it's not bad Yeah.

216
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:59,432
Rym: but I feel like Fitbit by my guess just my gut because when this sort of acquisition happens people really only buy a Receivership or they're like buying it because it's they're like they can buy it for nothing just for the hell of it to get the IP.

217
00:14:00,284 --> 00:14:09,358
Rym: You buy it for the customers Which they're definitely not doing because they basically already pissed off all the pebble customers by shutting it all down Like that like people who like pebbles hate Fitbit.

218
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:10,905
Rym: now Or three.

219
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:14,500
Rym: you buy them because it's really hard to hire good tech people.

220
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:24,120
Rym: It's way easier to just buy out a company that has a bunch of people and now you've got those and if you see anyone Then, you know after you hire all these people you see anyone unproductive you can fire them later.

221
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:36,876
Rym: But especially if you knew how much recruiters get like say like in IT a recruiter picks you up and yeah Let's say recruiter calls me and I actually go to apply for the job and get the job.

222
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:40,287
Scott: that recruiter will get Thousands and thousands of dollars.

223
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:43,960
Rym: I've seen as high as like 50% of my annual salary.

224
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,300
Scott: I haven't seen that much but I've seen a large percentages.

225
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,272
Scott: But anyway, like 10% so 20% I've seen way higher.

226
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:54,100
Scott: the point is the point is that is thousands of dollars, right?

227
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:59,720
Scott: So you're if you're a recruiter if you get like two people hired like you're you're set for quite a while.

228
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:08,527
Scott: So imagine, you know pebble had like what you're getting tens of employees all at once and they paid you know Like 40 million for the company.

229
00:15:08,547 --> 00:15:13,673
Rym: It's like you already know their value because they contributed to a Extremely viable platform.

230
00:15:13,854 --> 00:15:23,666
Scott: It's like whoa that was that was totally saved us all this money on like and time not having to like get recruiters and read resumes and All this kind of nonsense.

231
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:25,739
Scott: It's like oh, we just hired a whole bunch of developers real cheap.

232
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:28,737
Rym: So, I don't know what the future is gonna be for this stuff.

233
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:43,020
Scott: now I think what's gonna happen is like, you know, people are amazing miss reading and misunderstanding where they're like We don't you know that when in the writing they're like a pebble may see degraded You know like use in the future like it may degrade service may degrade.

234
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:49,430
Scott: It's like yeah, that means that what's gonna happen is Android's gonna update iPhones gonna update and that Apple break.

235
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,540
Scott: They're not gonna update the pebble software ever again.

236
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:59,500
Scott: So your pebble watch might keep working But it might stop working because you're never getting another update ever.

237
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,180
Rym: Yep You might be able to do what I did with Google Glass where you can connect like if you connect to somebody.

238
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:08,943
Scott: I still won't work as well as it does like right now Won't work anymore.

239
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:14,559
Scott: right now is as good as ever gonna work and it's only gonna work less as time goes on.

240
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,164
Scott: Yeah, so I'm actually see.

241
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:22,991
Scott: what I was hoping was that you know because with Apple whenever they do the second version of something That's always the best version right?

242
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:24,099
Scott: It's like they had that.

243
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:26,563
Scott: What's a good?

244
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:29,093
Scott: like the iPhone the original iPhone not so good.

245
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:37,180
Scott: the iPhone 3g so good Right, like the Apple the first Apple no good Apple - so good.

246
00:16:38,302 --> 00:16:42,877
Rym: The iWatch and iWatch - Not that special have some problems, right?

247
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,512
Scott: I watch was kind of big and fat and with battery life problems and whatever.

248
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:52,728
Scott: and the Apple watch - is I guess the new Apple Watch is just a slight update.

249
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:53,812
Scott: It's it's still fat.

250
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:54,896
Scott: It's still the same shape.

251
00:16:54,956 --> 00:16:55,438
Scott: Mostly.

252
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:57,587
Rym: It's you know I think the real problem is we're not.

253
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:03,532
Scott: it said it solves some of the problems, but it's still a significant problems And I'm like, wow, that's not really fixing it.

254
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:19,339
Rym: if they other than for fashion There's almost no way to have a premium sale of a smartwatch Because for the all the use cases that require like complex design or difficult hardware Are things that a tiny minority of people care about.

255
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:26,230
Rym: I would like to have NFC support in it directly so I can not have to pull my phone out to do like Android pay and Apple pay and all that.

256
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,902
Rym: I guess the iWatch might do that I watch.

257
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,048
Scott: does I wish does that will pay?

258
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:31,059
Rym: yeah, this this pebble does not do.

259
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:33,338
Rym: that I don't know if any Android where does Android pay?

260
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:35,260
Scott: Mmm, but anyways, yeah.

261
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:45,260
Scott: So I mean if Apple were to make now because by pebbles dying I guess slowly if Apple were to make an Apple watch that was significantly better and thinner and whatever I'd probably get one.

262
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:54,611
Scott: But then unlike my iPhone that I replace every two years and they think of it like a computer that I carry around Yeah, I would never replace that Apple watch ever.

263
00:17:54,912 --> 00:18:00,482
Scott: and if they made it stop working or stop supporting it I would be pissed and I would just stop wearing watches I like fuck.

264
00:18:00,523 --> 00:18:01,347
Rym: this thing is.

265
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,040
Rym: I know I am so used to having that second screen.

266
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:12,691
Rym: I would go back to wearing my Google Glass if I didn't have a good smartwatch but actually Google Glass still works fine if you use it directly with Android wear.

267
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:20,700
Scott: one good thing though Is that Apple tends to actually be good about allowing old devices to keep working like when they put out a new version of iOS.

268
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:24,470
Scott: It works with surprisingly old iPhones and works well, right?

269
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:25,774
Scott: It's like, oh, okay.

270
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,840
Scott: Wow, I didn't realize that old an iPhone.

271
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:31,075
Scott: Yeah, it's still run the newest iOS and run all the newest apps.

272
00:18:31,316 --> 00:18:32,140
Scott: That's pretty nice.

273
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,700
Scott: You didn't have to do that considering how much you're trying to get people to upgrade.

274
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:45,159
Scott: So I assume that even if you buy the old the original Apple watch today That it will serve you well for at least five years.

275
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:48,216
Rym: It's also so the article will link to is.

276
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:48,660
Rym: you can look at it.

277
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,086
Scott: I'll serve you as well as it can.

278
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:57,655
Rym: sort of goes through some of the details of what happened to pebble and We could talk about that, but that's more of a Thursday topic.

279
00:18:57,675 --> 00:18:58,740
Scott: Silicon Valley bullshit.

280
00:18:58,841 --> 00:18:59,203
Scott: yeah, because

281
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:08,678
Rym: that is that is the typical story of When and how these kinds of companies can't raise money and what kinds of people are the CEOs of these kinds of companies

282
00:19:08,838 --> 00:19:09,279
Scott: heads

283
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:11,319
Rym: Or at least people well

284
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:15,028
Scott: People who do not share our values for whom

285
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:19,620
Rym: their professional life is the is the height of their ambition.

286
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:21,098
Rym: Who have trouble?

287
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,910
Rym: Existing in a world where they do not have to do that job.

288
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:30,215
Rym: Yeah the person with career goals Yeah, my career goal is to retire to the beach.

289
00:19:30,276 --> 00:19:37,020
Scott: Yeah, my boss My boss is like trying to you know, do more I guess bossy stuff, I guess.

290
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,484
Scott: Ah So he's like.

291
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:42,257
Scott: he's like, alright, we're gonna have a little meetings with everyone and answer these questions.

292
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:43,422
Scott: So he's like here Let's try to.

293
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:45,051
Scott: he's like, alright, what are your goals?

294
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:46,619
Scott: And I'm like, do you mean outside of work?

295

00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:53,852
Scott: I'm like, what do you want me to say?

297
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:54,636
Scott: take your job?

298
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:55,259
Scott: I don't want that.

299
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,503
Rym: Yep, not poop myself.

300
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,409
Scott: He the CEO don't want that don't?

301
00:19:58,429 --> 00:19:59,211
Rym: we're sold your eye.

Scott: It's like it's like what's my career goal?

303
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:06,740
Scott: Nothing Not have to work less work less not get fired.

304
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:12,484
Rym: I mean any career goal I could give anyone get the most money for the least effort Boils down to.

305
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:17,420
Rym: I either want a job that's super fun and amazing or I want to not ever have to work again.

306
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,523
Scott: Yeah, what's my job?

307
00:20:18,623 --> 00:20:19,606

00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:20,469
Scott: All right.

310
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,552
Scott: Now we're talking.

311
00:20:21,572 --> 00:20:22,796
Scott: now we're talking.

312
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:23,739
Scott: I got career goals.

00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:26,928
Scott: now Survive ten rides and without stopping.

314
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:29,675
Scott: so tomorrow my goal be twelve.

315
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:30,878
Rym: I got a little side news.

316
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:31,420
Rym: It's kind of fun.

317
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,892
Rym: This is a ransomware and it's amazing.

318
00:20:33,952 --> 00:20:35,480
Rym: This is something I never even thought of.

319
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,730
Rym: I'm super proud of the whatever shithead made this malware.

320
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:42,060
Rym: It's a typical, you know crypto locker.

321
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:44,349
Scott: We're in your entire hard drive.

322
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:49,649
Scott: If you don't give us bitcoins, we gonna delete your data Yeah, or we just will never give you the key.

323
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,120
Scott: So your data will just be encrypted forever.

324
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:58,591
Rym: There are with this one Once it gets your data There are two ways to get your data back.

325
00:20:58,812 --> 00:20:59,615
Scott: is it is one of them?

326
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:00,680
Scott: still give them bitcoins.

327
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:06,872
Rym: So with the it actually gives you two options one Restoring your files the fast easy way to get your files fast.

328
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,120
Rym: Please transfer one Bitcoin to this address.

329
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,459
Scott: How much is one Bitcoin these days?

330
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:14,724
Rym: Off hand, I don't know but I'm gonna guess 280 bucks.

331
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:16,511
Scott: That's a lot of fucking money.

332
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:17,716
Rym: one Bitcoin.

333
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:20,625
Scott: Oh 778 that's a lot.

334
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:21,147
Scott: Yeah.

335
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:24,118
Rym: I am so well bitcoins way up since the election.

336
00:21:24,198 --> 00:21:31,237
Rym: actually Yeah, okay people are using it to launder money Because no one's gonna stop you?

337
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:32,704
Rym: Yeah, it was.

338
00:21:32,744 --> 00:21:33,728
Rym: it was okay.

339
00:21:33,748 --> 00:21:34,169
Rym: Yeah, it's.

340
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,558
Rym: it's gone up dramatically since the election.

341
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:37,220
Rym: That's interesting.

342
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:39,307
Scott: Is this safer than US dollars?

343
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:40,693
Rym: Oh, I don't know.

344
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,258
Rym: I guess you use it to transfer money.

345
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:42,700
Rym: But anyway.

346
00:21:44,144 --> 00:21:45,032
Rym: so yeah pay the money.

347
00:21:45,234 --> 00:21:49,339
Rym: typical or Restoring your files the nasty way.

348
00:21:50,103 --> 00:21:52,332
Rym: Send the link below to other people.

349
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:57,631
Rym: if two or more people Install this malware and pay the ransom.

350
00:21:58,172 --> 00:22:00,460
Rym: We will decrypt your files for free.

351
00:22:01,995 --> 00:22:02,160
Rym: Yeah.

352
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:08,380
Rym: So basically give us 700 bucks or fuck two of your friends.

353
00:22:10,187 --> 00:22:13,330
Scott: Yeah Anyone who sends this out?

354
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:18,011
Scott: I Kill you and I don't feel bad about no jury would convict.

355
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:20,680
Scott: No, they would be nullification all the way.

356
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,067
Rym: You know people talk about monetization.

357
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:26,057
Rym: This is a brilliant monetization model.

358
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:32,497
Rym: I Am proud of you, even though I would probably punch you in the face if I met you in person.

359
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:32,818
Rym: Oh, yeah.

360
00:22:38,512 --> 00:22:40,504
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

361
00:22:40,806 --> 00:22:47,809
Rym: so funnily enough Scott was telling me he had a thing of the day and I had my thing of the day and He was looking for the video of his thing of the day.

362
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:58,450
Rym: I went and clicked on the video of my thing of the day and The first recommended video for my thing of the day was Scott's thing of the day, I guess they're somewhat related.

363
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:01,710
Scott: Yeah, yeah, my video my thing of the day somehow has like a million views already.

364
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,723
Scott: So I guess it you might have you might have seen it already.

365
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:04,347
Scott: It's pretty good.

366
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:05,211
Scott: Yeah, it's good It's great.

367
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:06,497
Rym: so we can do yours first.

368
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:22,977
Scott: Okay, so imagine you're in like a mine or you like the kind where you dig stuff up right or Some other very large construction project like the big-time ones like the biggest big-time and you got some big-time equipment Like Tonka truck equipment Tonka

369
00:23:22,997 --> 00:23:23,639
Rym: trucks

370
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,030
Scott: big time like, you know where the tire is bigger than you that kind.

371
00:23:27,151 --> 00:23:28,241
Scott: It's so enormous, right?

372
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,189
Scott: Whatever this vehicle is.

373
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:36,444
Scott: Yeah Now imagine that tire on that enormous vehicle Goes flat because you ran over some giant nail.

374
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:38,230
Scott: cuz you're on a giant construction project.

375
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,937
Scott: You think I was gonna tire like that.

376
00:23:39,978 --> 00:23:40,540
Scott: go flat.

377
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:42,750
Scott: Yeah, it's like forward six eight inches thick.

378
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:49,350
Scott: But yeah, no, you can run over something like, you know, a giant rock or something really nasty a night with a lance.

379
00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:51,316
Scott: Yeah, anything can happen.

380
00:23:51,377 --> 00:23:52,821
Scott: So they do go flat.

381
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:53,725
Scott: It's still made of rubber.

382
00:23:53,745 --> 00:23:54,648
Scott: No matter how thick it is.

383
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:55,330
Scott: It's not invincible.

384
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:57,259
Scott: So what the hell do you do?

385
00:23:57,339 --> 00:24:03,130
Scott: It's like well you think oh you just you know Throw the tire out and put on a flat tire spare tire and open on a flat tire.

386
00:24:03,251 --> 00:24:05,690
Scott: You can put in a spare tire just like you would with your car.

387
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,696
Scott: And the answer is are you insane?

388
00:24:07,736 --> 00:24:12,290
Scott: because on your car like car tires for your a normal car are not cheap.

389
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,690
Scott: But you know, they're cheap enough.

390
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,184
Scott: We're like you couldn't get and just buy a new one right if you have to.

391
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,670
Scott: it's sort of the cost of owning a car.

392
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,569
Scott: Right, if you can afford to own a car you can afford to buy a tire once in a while, right?

393
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,170
Scott: A tire for one of these vehicles is like $30,000.

394
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:34,366
Scott: It's like two daddy two cars that to get one tire for the construction vehicle.

395
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:40,604
Rym: that is about double The value of any car I have ever owned in my life.

396
00:24:40,624 --> 00:24:44,430
Scott: That's not just that's not even counting the wheel That's just the tire rubber part.

397
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:49,581
Scott: So if one goes flat I'm sure at a big enough construction site you're prepared and you can.

398
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:52,712
Scott: you have a spare or you can get a spare from somewhere You know.

399
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:57,090
Scott: so you can keep working without you know having to delay your whole construction project because of one tire.

400
00:24:57,732 --> 00:24:59,497
Scott: but you aren't throwing that shit out.

401
00:24:59,517 --> 00:25:16,063
Scott: you're fixing that fucking tire right, but how do you fix a ginormous piece of rubber that is taller than a human being and Make it like sturdy enough that like someone can actually put an enormous Vehicles weight on that tire and drive around safely?

402
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:32,180
Scott: in this video He shows you the entire process of repairing the tire on an from an enormous construction vehicle And it is quite fascinating actually looks kind of fun except for the part where it looks like they're breathing in little bits of rubber Which I don't want to

403
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:32,241
Rym: do.

404
00:25:32,526 --> 00:25:38,506
Scott: yeah All the rest of its looks real fun and way awesome and sort of like sculpting and artwork.

405
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:39,750
Scott: in a way, it's real good.

406
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:48,589
Rym: So what I got for you is The wobble dado blade the what the fuck what all right, so you know what a blade is like a knife.

407
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:51,579
Rym: Yeah, so imagine like a blade on a circular saw.

408
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,010
Rym: okay, all right, so do you know what a dado is?

409
00:25:56,432 --> 00:25:58,409
Scott: an artist from you know like the.

410
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:04,090
Rym: so Like my grandpa was a cabinet maker so I learned a lot of carpentry and stuff as a kid.

411
00:26:04,552 --> 00:26:06,279
Rym: But dados are when.

412
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:14,389
Rym: so you know what like say you've got like a piece of wood And you want to cut a groove in it to slide another piece of wood in like for a shelf or something.

413
00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:24,440
Rym: That trench that you cut is called a dado Mm-hmm the kind that's like a trapezoid kind of shape or or yeah like it like there We've got a picture of on like that.

414
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,365
Rym: just cut a trench.

415
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:26,210
Rym: There's some wood.

416
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:29,329
Rym: Yeah, how do you think you make those in a piece of wood?

417
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:37,170
Scott: So if I remember my memory is not good I remember Norm Abrams the new Yankee workshop used to watch on PBS.

418
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:45,073
Scott: Yeah, the new Yankee workshop He would make shaker furniture, and I'm pretty sure what he would do is that there are two things I remember him doing right.

419
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:50,630
Scott: he always used like his router around the edge or Norm Abram and his dados, okay?

420
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,360
Rym: Oh, man, I just oh crap look at this.

421
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:54,304
Scott: Yes anyway.

422
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:57,294
Rym: This whole article is about Norm Making dados right.

423
00:26:57,334 --> 00:27:04,838
Scott: so if I remember what he would do is he would had the table saw and he'd put something in the Table saw and just set it low.

424
00:27:04,858 --> 00:27:13,569
Scott: and then when he put the wood over the table saw it wouldn't cut all the way through The wood it would just cut you know a groove in the wood without cutting out.

425
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,195
Scott: So you wouldn't split the wood in half.

426
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:16,138
Scott: you're getting real close.

427
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,805
Scott: It's got this groove in it what?

428
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,976
Rym: so if a dados say like an inch thick Mmm.

429
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,529
Rym: What are you gonna put there?

430
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:25,178
Rym: There's no such thing as an inch thick blade.

431
00:27:25,218 --> 00:27:26,001
Rym: it can't be sure.

432
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:26,503
Rym: no you can.

433
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:33,124
Scott: when you have a table saw you can raise And lower the blades all right Is barely sticking out of the table.

434
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:34,733
Rym: no no I'm talking about Depth.

435
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:39,330
Rym: though the width of your blade the how wide is the blade you just get a thick ass one a thick blade.

436
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,033
Rym: What's that look like?

437
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:41,519
Rym: what are the teeth look like on a blade?

438
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:44,330
Scott: That's an inch thick the same as on a regular blade.

439
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,027
Scott: Just thick like that would chip the wood me.

440
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:48,516
Scott: I don't know I would.

441
00:27:48,557 --> 00:27:53,369
Rym: so You can do this with routers, but that's really yeah.

442
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:58,955
Scott: I think I've seen him do it with a router a few times where instead of putting the router around the edge of the wood To make a nice shape you just

443
00:27:58,995 --> 00:27:59,638
Rym: kind of you just

444
00:27:59,698 --> 00:28:06,410
Scott: drive the writer the router right down the middle of the wood in a Straight line and you know just make it with put the right bit on there.

445
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,635
Scott: So it just that's tough to do.

446
00:28:07,675 --> 00:28:13,740
Rym: in my experience people you use a router if you're doing like fancy work like kind of scroll Work or something, but I remember.

447
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,030
Scott: all I remember is he used the router all the fucking time.

448
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:16,995
Scott: That's like his favorite thing.

449
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:28,020
Rym: so there's a thing called a dado blade And it's basically you stack all these blades that have like these blunt gears together And you make a stack until it's as wide as the dado you want to cut.

450
00:28:28,843 --> 00:28:31,090
Scott: and oh so only one blade hits at a time.

451
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,213
Scott: Yeah, but the blades are.

452
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:35,403
Scott: it's spinning fast and the blades are.

453
00:28:35,664 --> 00:28:37,590
Scott: you know it ends up being wide enough?

454
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,594
Scott: So you're hitting all the.

455
00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:40,402
Scott: I can already imagine exactly what that looks.

456
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:42,230
Rym: so dado blades are pretty expensive.

457
00:28:42,531 --> 00:28:45,738
Scott: And yeah, I mean it's X times the cost of one blade.

458
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,322
Scott: or you're buying multiple blades.

459
00:28:47,402 --> 00:28:50,790
Rym: they might be illegal in the EU as well.

460
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:52,576
Scott: Interesting don't make.

461
00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:52,736
Scott: for.

462
00:28:52,837 --> 00:28:57,513
Rym: oh yeah, I type dado blade Europe and the first result is illegal, okay Why is it illegal?

463
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:59,057
Rym: because they're dangerous?

464
00:28:59,178 --> 00:29:00,241
Scott: Why is it dangerous?

465
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:02,608
Scott: more dangerous than just a single table saw blade so?

466
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:12,409
Rym: The reasons for that are kind of complicated, but basically It looks like in Europe It's illegal for because the way they the way they get prevent you from using them.

467
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:19,312
Rym: The thing you mount your blades on in a table saw in Europe is so narrow that you could never put dados on there Mm-hmm.

468
00:29:19,955 --> 00:29:26,668
Scott: so if I tried to import a US table saw to Europe they'd be like no No, I find all that's what customs would see.

469
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:33,684
Scott: they'd be like Ah you know you get to customs and like table saws a and they go to their customs guide And it's got this list of things to check on a table.

470
00:29:33,704 --> 00:29:34,410
Rym: so all these forms.

471
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:42,068
Rym: I'm finding our woodworkers who are like Really in the US like everyone dados everywhere ever a dado blade dado blade dado heaven.

472
00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:45,624
Scott: yeah Yeah, we also got cameras that can record for more than 30 minutes.

473
00:29:45,644 --> 00:29:46,730
Scott: Yeah, take that Europe.

474
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:51,070
Rym: We'll see how well we do in the near future, but they actually do also.

475
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,141
Scott: They just have to pay video recording tax on those cameras.

476
00:29:54,202 --> 00:29:56,430
Rym: There is another way to cut a dado.

477
00:29:57,073 --> 00:29:57,274
Rym: They.

478
00:29:57,454 --> 00:30:02,862
Rym: apparently no one makes these blades anymore, but people find him like garage sales, okay I did not know this was the thing all right.

479
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:06,402
Rym: This is a blade That is a normal blade.

480
00:30:06,603 --> 00:30:06,724
Rym: like.

481
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:07,829
Rym: it looks like normal table saw blade.

482
00:30:08,351 --> 00:30:12,246
Rym: Is it like an angle at an angle so it wobbles?

483
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:13,430
Scott: Oh wobbling?

484
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:19,645
Scott: Oh, I thought it would just be like at a slant so as no fun It would be you know sort of going back and forth.

485
00:30:19,726 --> 00:30:25,507
Scott: It's what not Physically wobbling at the axis that danger physically wobbles at the axis.

486
00:30:25,547 --> 00:30:26,310
Scott: Oh, that's dangerous.

487
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,643
Rym: That's way safer than a dado stack as far as I can tell.

488
00:30:30,723 --> 00:30:34,797
Scott: I thought it would just sort of be like this way So that as it spins.

489
00:30:34,978 --> 00:30:38,610
Rym: It's you know it's got this whole mechanism inside to control the angle.

490
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:40,456
Rym: These are actually pretty sophisticated.

491
00:30:40,637 --> 00:30:41,300
Scott: That's fancy.

492
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,090
Rym: Yeah, so I stumble out of this video.

493
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:47,799
Rym: I'm not really sure how and it was just really interesting.

494
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:55,530
Rym: and If you follow the recommended videos from this you think we talk our nerd crap about like what video card to buy.

495
00:30:55,972 --> 00:30:59,410
Rym: Watch some woodworkers talking their nerd crap about what data blade to buy.

496
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:00,235
Scott: I wonder what.

497
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:06,846
Scott: cuz you know there's that stuff that other people are into the the Japanese woodworking where you don't use glue or nails you just Japanese joy.

498
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:07,709
Scott: There's a joinery.

499
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,793
Scott: Yeah, the joinery.

500
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,580
Scott: We're like you enter everything interlock.

501
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,242
Rym: Oh, soo.

502
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:13,350
Scott: Yeah, I forget what the word is, but it's like.

503
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,422
Scott: There's like a Twitter account.

504
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:17,876
Scott: I think that posts gifts of.

505
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:22,335
Scott: you know the interlocking Joinery, thank you Wikipedia.

506
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:23,618
Rym: You are very helpful.

507
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:31,850
Scott: Japanese carpentry is carpentry in Japan period yeah, but anyway I wonder how like these dados and stuff a lot.

508
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,805
Scott: I wonder how they did it by hand all those days.

509
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:35,870
Rym: Oh you want to know by hand.

510
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,598
Rym: I got videos of doing that by hand.

511
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:39,226
Rym: guess what it's a pain in the ass.

512
00:31:39,246 --> 00:31:39,890
Rym: It takes forever.

513
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:43,920
Rym: You look you basically sit there with like these implements.

514
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,889
Scott: Just hitting and shaving with just like a chisel or whatever.

515
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:48,743
Rym: It is awful, okay.

516
00:31:50,893 --> 00:32:04,892
Rym: In the moment the booklet book is Rebecca To start reading it yeah again, yeah, okay, I want you to think you've been done with it Weeks all right, I'll start reading it in earnest today cuz I just days days weeks It depends.

517
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:09,949
Rym: I finished Black Mirror on Netflix on my phone, so now I'm gonna read Rebecca as fast as possible.

518
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:14,676
Rym: Otherwise we're gonna be magfest Between Scott's on two panels.

519
00:32:15,137 --> 00:32:21,958
Rym: I am on six panels and joy, and we're always gonna be a peck Or more hours of games than you.

520
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:25,050
Rym: one of those panels is anime openers from around the world.

521
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,058
Scott: It's a whole game of Eclipse.

522
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:26,663
Scott: you ain't playing?

523
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:31,326
Rym: yeah I don't think any of my panels start at midnight, so I think my clips game will be fine.

524
00:32:31,346 --> 00:32:32,310
Scott: You're gonna miss daytime.

525
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:34,193
Rym: We're playing.

526
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:35,520
Rym: we got to play some battle tech.

527
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:36,947
Scott: You know you want to play battle.

528
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:37,610
Scott: take it mag fest.

529
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,958
Scott: I think we can do that.

530
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:40,990
Rym: We can get the band together and make this happen.

531
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:43,390
Scott: I can bring battle tech stuffs to mag fest.

532
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,422
Rym: I wonder if I guess I could run mech maker in an emulator.

533
00:32:46,623 --> 00:32:48,210
Scott: We could just make mechs at home bring them.

534
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,421
Rym: Yeah, we don't know we're making the max ahead of time.

535
00:32:50,461 --> 00:32:51,145
Rym: That is not.

536
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:52,090
Rym: we're not gonna make max.

537
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,321
Scott: They're gonna begin to get a printer at mag fest.

538
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:54,683
Scott: good luck.

539
00:32:54,823 --> 00:32:56,170
Scott: Yeah, I guess I use my tablet.

540
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,585
Scott: I wonder if there's a Mac app.

541
00:32:57,605 --> 00:32:58,070
Scott: I can get my.

542
00:32:59,214 --> 00:33:01,303
Rym: I wonder how well supported modern battle tech is.

543
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:03,050
Scott: it's very well supported.

544
00:33:03,532 --> 00:33:04,295
Scott: We go to packs.

545
00:33:04,456 --> 00:33:05,239
Scott: we could buy it from.

546
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,183
Scott: the people are always there.

547
00:33:06,224 --> 00:33:10,662
Scott: so yeah, but in terms of Technological support you want to upgrade our battle tech to the new.

548
00:33:10,682 --> 00:33:12,370
Scott: you know the new updated rules.

549
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,684
Rym: It depends is the targeting computer is still cheap.

550
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:15,730
Scott: I'm pretty.

551
00:33:17,054 --> 00:33:24,270
Rym: No one's allowed to have a targeting But my old neck is based on having nothing but rail guns in a targeting computer and armor only in the front.

552
00:33:24,491 --> 00:33:29,429
Rym: Yeah, backed up against a wall with a tripod and no piloting skill and no jump jets.

553
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:43,390
Rym: But yeah, we'll be a PAX South doing at least one panel a bunch of stuffs coming up and Stay tuned as GeekNights will continue its regular schedule even through the holidays, so we've done the show before.

554
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:50,759
Scott: Yeah, so usually when we come up with a show idea for Monday then the number one reason We don't do it is we've done this before.

555
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:51,945
Rym: it's not even Simpsons.

556
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:52,226
Rym: Did it.

557
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:53,070
Rym: It's ribbon Scott.

558
00:33:53,150 --> 00:34:00,143
Scott: You literally did this one in 2006 though in the first year of GeekNights about a decade ago a decade ago And usually I'd be like well.

559
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:00,405
Scott: Nope.

560
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:00,830
Scott: That's it.

561
00:34:00,911 --> 00:34:01,848
Scott: We can't do the show again.

562
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:08,868
Scott: But so much has changed in ten years that we can safely do this show again.

563
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:12,045
Rym: in fact it's things that it's kind of like with monitors.

564
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:24,175
Rym: how like monitors and displays for computers were actually very high resolution until Relatively recently in the history when 1080p Became some sort of like.

565
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,882
Scott: oh I get an HD now.

566
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:26,324
Scott: We're 4k.

567
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:26,686
Scott: We're good.

568
00:34:26,706 --> 00:34:27,590
Scott: We're high-resolution again.

569
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:35,409
Rym: Yeah but for a long time that basically monitor technology went from an elegant weapon from a more civilized age to this sort of dark era of.

570
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:39,536
Rym: Really, you're giving me 1080 pixels vertically.

571
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:41,987
Rym: that's worse than the CRT I had in high school.

572
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:50,036
Rym: Yep But I am instant messaging Kind of had a similar problem like the war the landscape of.

573
00:34:50,216 --> 00:34:55,929
Rym: I am today in the era of modern smartphones and like way advanced web technology.

574
00:34:55,949 --> 00:35:10,786
Rym: I mean 2006 was web 2.0 stuff going on I don't know like early days of like pre-modern internet stuff Mmm, and I am was in a lot of ways better back then than it is now mm-hmm.

575
00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:16,752
Scott: so back Then we were talking about you know aim ICQ and mostly XMPP.

576
00:35:16,812 --> 00:35:21,326
Scott: right and at the time XMPP jabber was this interoperable thing.

577
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:27,289
Scott: you could use Google Hangout Or you could use your own jabber server, and it's like all these things could talk to each other.

578
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:35,490
Scott: Yeah, and that was a feature that we actually used and was actually great That you could just sort of chat between these different chat systems.

579
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:40,465
Scott: They all work together and because they used XMPP you could get any client you wanted.

580
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:42,679
Scott: so you could use like you know Just any.

581
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:51,917
Scott: you could just pigeon I think that's what we were using bad vision at home, and there's pigeons trillium adium all these you know programs And you could use whichever one you wanted.

582
00:35:51,957 --> 00:35:55,230
Scott: that was best for you, and they would all you could work with whatever aim.

583
00:35:55,694 --> 00:35:58,372
Scott: You know instant messaging Protocol.

584
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:00,019
Scott: you wanted to use multiples together.

585
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:04,217
Scott: Yeah, and you know it was a little bit Cumbersome to you know.

586
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:07,010
Scott: sort all that out, but but it was like email.

587
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:08,896
Rym: Anyone could message anyone.

588
00:36:08,936 --> 00:36:11,143
Scott: yeah the end result was actually pretty great.

589
00:36:11,243 --> 00:36:15,616
Scott: anyone could message almost anybody and You could send you could.

590
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:19,390
Scott: there's even times you could send files to people directly over these networks.

591
00:36:19,872 --> 00:36:23,624
Scott: And you know there are all sorts of features, and it was really kind of nice.

592
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:26,295
Rym: yep, and what's really interesting And we're not.

593
00:36:26,335 --> 00:36:38,262
Rym: it was not a thing that we complained about really where we were mostly just Wondering about the future and like adding functionality and making it easier and encryption and all that kind of like file sending stopped working because of routers and things.

594
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,047
Scott: right you know.

595
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:50,610
Rym: and yet somehow and you know the year 2016 things like what's app exists and What's that basically has a limited subset of what I see Q provided in?

596
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,314
Scott: 1996 right.

597
00:36:52,474 --> 00:36:55,744
Scott: so on the one hand things have gotten a little bit better in some areas.

598
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:57,410
Scott: right user interface is much better.

599
00:36:57,911 --> 00:37:00,078
Scott: Right support for Unicode and things like that.

600
00:37:00,138 --> 00:37:03,770
Scott: much better emojis and stickers and those sorts of fun things.

601
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:05,498
Scott: Those are those aren't night.

602
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:06,061
Scott: They're nice.

603
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:09,792
Scott: I like to use them sometimes, right You know.

604
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:11,518
Scott: so those are in mobile support.

605
00:37:11,578 --> 00:37:14,910
Scott: obviously having mobile apps that are kind of slick is really nice because they can.

606
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,858
Rym: 1996 there was.

607
00:37:16,878 --> 00:37:17,923
Rym: smartphones didn't exist.

608
00:37:17,963 --> 00:37:20,112
Rym: cell phones were barely available.

609
00:37:20,132 --> 00:37:23,744
Scott: the other thing that we have that we also had back then but is now easier.

610
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,293
Scott: as long as you choose the right app is Encryption.

611
00:37:26,353 --> 00:37:26,976
Scott: that we didn't have.

612
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:27,298
Scott: you know.

613
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:33,923
Scott: end-to-end encryption it depending on what you choose If you signal or what's app you get the end-to-end encryption gonna.

614
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:36,170
Rym: it had encryption to a degree.

615
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:39,909
Rym: But also, I'm not necessarily trusting of the actually.

616
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:48,404
Scott: yeah I'm not I'm not sure quite yet sure which ones that claim to be end-to-end encrypted are actually really truly encrypted.

617
00:37:48,444 --> 00:37:56,529
Rym: so for Lee in 1996 when I wanted to send encrypted I am's I use the PGP clipboard crypto to do it by hand.

618
00:37:56,569 --> 00:37:57,674
Scott: yeah But it worked.

619
00:37:57,754 --> 00:37:59,282
Scott: there's no way ends are gonna get through that.

620
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:01,050
Rym: Yeah, that shit was secure.

621
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:02,340
Scott: I was guaranteed secure.

622
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,590
Scott: cuz you do you can still do that today.

623
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:13,793
Scott: You could encrypt something by hand copy and paste it into Google Hangout and as long as no one's messed your computer up Yep, no one in between is getting the MTM to M MIM.

624
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:22,054
Rym: but the the biggest problem today is that there's been this huge fracturing of IM services and They've taken away Interoperability.

625
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:29,343
Scott: Google Hangout got rid of XM PPS only works with itself And then all these walled garden apps for communicating with people appeared.

626
00:38:29,383 --> 00:38:31,150
Rym: What's app is just the most egregious way?

627
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,581
Scott: Google made like aloe and they made this other one.

628
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:36,106
Scott: That's like four groups spaces.

629
00:38:36,186 --> 00:38:37,270
Scott: It's like four groups only.

630
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,759
Scott: It's like I guess supposed to do a beluga.

631
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:42,910
Scott: did you got Facebook Messenger, which is really the worst one?

632
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,118
Rym: Yep, beluga was gonna see.

633
00:38:45,138 --> 00:38:45,640
Rym: there were all these.

634
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,070
Rym: like there was this explosion of good ideas like beluga.

635
00:38:48,271 --> 00:38:52,769
Scott: Well, yes, we can use Google Spaces instead of beluga, but you can also just make a Google Hangout with multiple people in it.

636
00:38:52,951 --> 00:38:54,310
Scott: Yeah, why do you need Google Spaces?

637
00:38:54,892 --> 00:39:10,464
Rym: So I guess what happened was Google for a long time since 2006 like the Hangouts platform emerged as even though it was no longer interoperable It was the most reliable had the best feature set the best UX.

638
00:39:10,785 --> 00:39:12,190
Rym: every feature of this thing was great.

639
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:17,630
Rym: So, of course, they're basically trying to kill it and replace it with aloe which kind of sucks.

640
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,737
Scott: Yeah, I don't aloe.

641
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:20,790
Scott: the problem aloe is no desktop client, right?

642
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,011
Scott: That's.

643
00:39:21,031 --> 00:39:23,622
Scott: the other thing is that these, you know, the I am apps.

644
00:39:23,964 --> 00:39:25,350
Scott: they worked on every device.

645
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:29,030
Scott: You could be the same identity and chat with the same people no matter where you are.

646
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:33,530
Scott: Now you got people using like iMessage and iMessage is actually really great feature wise.

647
00:39:33,691 --> 00:39:36,630
Rym: Yeah, the problem is better than Google Hangouts in a lot of ways.

648
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,263
Scott: Oh, yeah But the problem with iMessage is that a you can only use it on a desktop.

649
00:39:40,484 --> 00:39:49,010
Scott: if you got a Mac with iChat you can't use iMessage on a Windows desktop or Linux desktop and If your friend doesn't have an iPhone, they're not iMessaging.

650
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:55,730
Rym: So if you got Android friends get rekt, but my Android friends most of them have a gmail address.

651
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:57,477
Rym: Thank God at least so everyone.

652
00:39:57,497 --> 00:39:58,240
Scott: Yeah everyone.

653
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,268
Scott: I know who I want to chat with uses Gmail.

654
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,779
Rym: Ah, you know who doesn't chase.

655
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:05,090
Scott: even if I said I chase I hang on him.

656
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,949
Rym: Yeah, even though I hang out him when I was out he hang us me too.

657
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,856
Rym: Yeah, if I I am him he will.

658
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:13,871
Rym: I am me back but his default way to communicate with me is they always sends me a Text.

659
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:14,536
Scott: Yeah, he does.

660
00:40:14,576 --> 00:40:20,590
Scott: He does default to SMS, but he will use hang out And I think that's because his wider social circle is all SMS base.

661
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,296
Rym: Yeah, they pretty much only use SMS.

662
00:40:22,316 --> 00:40:29,815
Scott: The people are using SMS which sucks by the way, but they're using it because 100% interoperable with everyone.

663
00:40:29,896 --> 00:40:32,803
Rym: everyone has a phone except if I'm at home.

664
00:40:33,104 --> 00:40:36,586
Rym: and I'm not using my phone because I'm home You can't SMS me.

665
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:37,410
Scott: That's right.

666
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:43,070
Scott: Your SMS will only show up on your phone and not on your computer or anywhere I got around that is I use Google Voice.

667
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:44,922
Rym: So actually I do get like you can.

668
00:40:44,962 --> 00:40:50,106
Rym: if you call my phone number It'll actually ring my computer if I'm home and you know what?

669
00:40:50,427 --> 00:40:51,050
Rym: That's amazing.

670
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:58,650
Rym: Yeah It's like we advance to this point to where your identity and communication capabilities follow you to whatever device you're at.

671
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:03,050
Rym: And then we said fuck that and we're going back to these walled gardens and these phone only systems.

672
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:08,890
Scott: Yeah, I mean it people are not as upset with it as we are because they're phone only people.

673
00:41:09,364 --> 00:41:16,990
Rym: Yeah right and I spend even eight hours a day sitting at work in front of a computer and you know what I do at home for at These four hours it in front of a computer.

674
00:41:17,732 --> 00:41:25,230
Scott: But even if you have phone and tablet, let's say right or phone and Mac, you know If you're Apple person all this stuff works together.

675
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:32,601
Scott: If you call me on my phone and my iPad has Wi-Fi or it's near my phone My iPad starts ringing even though it's Wi-Fi only.

676
00:41:32,702 --> 00:41:33,565
Scott: Yeah, it knows.

677
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,070
Scott: it knows it's like, you know.

678
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:39,330
Scott: So a lot of people are set up in this sort of integrated way.

679
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:48,552
Scott: We're like their shit works and they don't realize like, you know, they're not using a desktop computer So much, they don't have a real computer connected to their TV They have.

680
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:51,362
Scott: so they're doing it in such a way there.

681
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:57,310
Scott: for like normal people things are just fine But they're ruining it for advanced people.

682
00:41:57,491 --> 00:42:02,428
Rym: So another example I've seen is that I know some people who will not be named on this episode.

683
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:02,990
Scott: who?

684
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:13,389
Rym: They have gmail accounts But they don't like pay attention to it or have like the messaging like notifications set up because they primarily use Facebook Messenger or something.

685
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,344
Scott: Yeah No bueno.

686
00:42:16,507 --> 00:42:27,241
Rym: Yeah Beluga was great because in the old days you would use that at an event like a convention like we need an I am Group just for this convention.

687
00:42:27,282 --> 00:42:28,890
Scott: You can do that today with Google Spaces.

688
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:36,850
Scott: But like I said, Google Hangout lets you make a hangout with multiple people and it's basically perfect Yeah, and it works on your phone and your computer.

689
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,617
Scott: But Google seems to be not.

690
00:42:38,677 --> 00:42:44,428
Scott: first they got rid of the XM PP part and now they seem to be slowly killing it in Which is weird because they made aloe.

691
00:42:44,891 --> 00:42:45,392
Rym: Why?

692
00:42:45,412 --> 00:42:51,170
Rym: basically the same but only on phones but slightly different user interface like the ux.

693
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:55,803
Rym: The ux is a little better, but it doesn't have any like additional capabilities.

694
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,070
Scott: It's just separate for no reason.

695
00:42:58,131 --> 00:43:01,870
Rym: It's more like it's aimed around Communicating with your friends, right?

696
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:15,450
Scott: I don't understand how you lot like if you launch a new network and it's how do you get people if everyone's already has a Hey friend, oh, yeah, there are holy shit Scott.

697
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:25,050
Rym: So people I interact with a lot of people in like the finance world and people who are our age are reasonably educated Don't they use SMS if they don't use anything else?

698
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:33,970
Rym: So they primarily so normal people like that Seem to just not know about this stuff like they don't really understand the difference between hangouts and SMS and all these things.

699
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,376
Scott: But I mean they're just using SMS.

700
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:35,777
Scott: So why?

701
00:43:35,878 --> 00:43:38,167
Scott: how could you sell them on switching from that to?

702
00:43:39,493 --> 00:43:44,653
Rym: So some of these people came to me when what's that was first announced and they were like, holy shit Check this out.

703
00:43:44,934 --> 00:43:48,730
Rym: If you install this app and I'm like what app he's like, yeah, what's that?

704
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:49,732
Rym: And I did.

705
00:43:49,812 --> 00:43:55,853
Rym: I've grown at him and then he was like it totally lets you chat with people on your phone Uh-huh.

706
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:56,958
Scott: They mean the thing we did.

707
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:02,881
Scott: since they don't know like they don't do that Do they not have people they chat with they don't.

708
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:04,246
Rym: they like SMS people like an.

709
00:44:04,487 --> 00:44:07,757
Scott: I am client Marketed so why does that make?

710
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:12,410
Scott: why are they happy to use whatsapp as opposed to they didn't conceive I am before that.

711
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:22,323
Scott: Okay They didn't use I am but how if you're already if everyone you know is already SMSing right and some of those people all have iPhones and are therefore using iMessage in the same exact app?

712
00:44:22,344 --> 00:44:24,050
Scott: that does SMS, right?

713
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:27,859
Scott: Why would you then that's doing what you need to do?

714
00:44:28,261 --> 00:44:31,370
Scott: Why would you switch to alo or whatsapp or whatever?

715
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:34,060
Rym: So I feel like the people who switched to watch that.

716
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,288
Scott: and how do you convince I all of your friends to switch?

717
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:42,385
Rym: they switched From nothing or from just SMS, which was actually pretty unreliable, especially if it's international.

718
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:43,628
Scott: I've never under national.

719
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:44,588
Scott: Yeah as a problem Yeah.

720
00:44:45,371 --> 00:44:56,590
Rym: So I feel I feel like a lot of the people are using things like whatsapp Basically didn't use anything before that like they might individually send an SMS occasionally, but they never chatted via SMS.

721
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:58,218
Scott: I feel like a lot of people.

722
00:44:58,358 --> 00:45:08,980
Rym: it's like this messengers like built into everything Like you can eat like everything has messaging built in like yeah, like you can send me these blizzard messages I'm like, what the fuck is there any I wish I could turn it off.

723
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:14,673
Scott: You can use steam you can use reddit You can use What else.

724
00:45:14,693 --> 00:45:18,210
Scott: can you draw Twitter on direct messages Skype you can use sky.

725
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:25,150
Rym: There are people I know who have gmails who use hangouts who send me Twitter DMS.

726
00:45:26,231 --> 00:45:26,492
Rym: It's like.

727
00:45:26,512 --> 00:45:36,000
Rym: you have my email you have my phone number you know where I live you have every means in the world to communicate With me and yet you send me a fucking Twitter DM.

728
00:45:36,141 --> 00:45:36,402
Scott: Yep.

729
00:45:36,682 --> 00:45:39,050
Scott: It's like everything that takes like 10 minutes to arrive.

730
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,799
Scott: Why does everything have messaging built in?

731
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:50,030
Scott: it's like, you know a Twitter DM makes sense for Someone in the public who's like a Twitter follower to message me?

732
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:56,710
Rym: Yeah, but it doesn't make sense for anyone right or like blizzard like inside of the battle net stuff.

733
00:45:57,071 --> 00:46:03,872
Rym: It makes sense like the steam messaging because the messages exist for one purpose to try to invite someone into a game that you're playing Right now.

734
00:46:03,892 --> 00:46:08,368
Rym: Mmm, but people just like I am me via it.

735
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:19,284
Rym: people We know have just tried to chat with me and had conversations with me in steam Instead of a hangout Mmm, and it's super weird.

736
00:46:19,304 --> 00:46:31,050
Rym: Like I got home from work one day There's a couple months ago and there's all these messages from someone we know just in steam on my desktop Mmm, so of course, I guess think about the old days.

737
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:35,125
Rym: there was you know ICQ and there's I and there was aim and there was MSN.

738
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:43,534
Rym: if you were dumb or lived in one of the countries that was popular and then everyone got on right here and Everyone like.

739
00:46:43,575 --> 00:46:46,390
Rym: there was the battle of half of us used ICQ and half is used aim.

740
00:46:46,912 --> 00:46:50,389
Rym: Half of you were about to get fucked and gonna have to switch and that's what we did.

741
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:57,367
Rym: I switched from the far superior ICQ to the far inferior aim because that is what my new social circle use.

742
00:46:57,407 --> 00:46:58,269
Scott: just fine aim.

743
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:00,195
Rym: It was just way.

744
00:47:00,215 --> 00:47:01,959
Scott: that also supported XM PP.

745
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:03,464
Scott: Yeah, it was totally nice.

746
00:47:03,484 --> 00:47:05,730
Rym: In fact, I remember I had a client client.

747
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:06,433
Rym: I used my.

748
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:10,209
Rym: I had my aim ID and my ICQ ID both working in Trillium.

749
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:11,855
Scott: I used pigeon.

750
00:47:12,418 --> 00:47:14,507
Scott: Well at the time it wasn't known as pigeon.

751
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:17,714
Scott: It was known as GM yep.

752
00:47:17,996 --> 00:47:18,257
Rym: Yep.

753
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,610
Rym: I used to use the game pretty extensively.

754
00:47:22,011 --> 00:47:22,915
Rym: Those are dark days.

755
00:47:22,955 --> 00:47:24,260
Scott: thinking back became pigeon.

756
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,550
Rym: Anyway, the big difference is ICQ at offline messaging.

757
00:47:26,893 --> 00:47:28,890
Scott: But yeah, instant messaging is fucked up these days.

758
00:47:29,131 --> 00:47:34,110
Scott: It's all these separate, you know, totally walled off things and everyone's using like ten of them at once.

759
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:42,683
Rym: So I literally have to think whenever I want to met whenever I want to communicate with a human who is not like super savvy Well, sometimes there's a contextual reason to use a specific thing, right.

760
00:47:42,723 --> 00:47:44,330
Rym: so like inside of a map, right?

761
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:50,370
Scott: Like if I'm gonna talk to someone cuz I'm gonna play a game with them right now We'll use the steam chat because we both have steam open and it's convenient.

762
00:47:50,711 --> 00:47:59,746
Rym: But at the same time if if I want to play a mess like I want to play overwatch with someone I can't use blizzard first unless they're already logged in and playing overwatch.

763
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:01,888
Rym: if I want to say hey Scott You want to play overwatch?

764
00:48:02,371 --> 00:48:02,612
Rym: I'm gonna.

765
00:48:02,752 --> 00:48:07,170
Rym: I am them on something else because I don't look at the blizzard thing unless I'm actively playing the game.

766
00:48:07,391 --> 00:48:09,379
Scott: It's for the people you're already playing a game with.

767
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,448
Rym: so you still need to use a different service.

768
00:48:11,729 --> 00:48:15,064
Rym: with Like it old walkie-talkies you make the bleeper tone to tell people.

769
00:48:15,104 --> 00:48:16,450
Rym: Hey, I'm about to message you, right?

770
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,265
Scott: So another example is like sometimes I have slack.

771
00:48:19,326 --> 00:48:20,090
Scott: everyone uses slack.

772
00:48:20,271 --> 00:48:23,469
Scott: Yeah, but slack is for like a group a permanent group kind of thing, right?

773
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:31,440
Scott: But it can also be used for a private thing if say someone in that group wants to contact you specifically but you're not super close with them, right?

774
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:35,390
Scott: so there's like a netrunner slack and It's for the whole netrunner world.

775
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:41,509
Scott: But we made a channel NYC on there for only netrunner and NYC people and there's people in there.

776
00:48:41,851 --> 00:48:43,380
Scott: You can't hang out me really.

777
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,190
Scott: I guess I could if they wanted to that's fine.

778
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:45,932
Scott: But they don't.

779
00:48:46,473 --> 00:48:55,850
Scott: but if they want to message me then they send me a direct message on that particular slack And it's like okay, I guess that works, right?

780
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:57,776
Scott: But this is yet another like.

781
00:48:57,997 --> 00:49:00,184
Scott: how many different ways are there to contact me?

782
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:01,790
Scott: Why do we need so many?

783
00:49:02,452 --> 00:49:07,350
Scott: It makes sense sometimes but really I wish there was just one and I could funnel everything together.

784
00:49:07,651 --> 00:49:08,635
Rym: Yep, there was that like.

785
00:49:08,675 --> 00:49:11,827
Rym: remember when Twitter was and it's everyone used xmpp.

786
00:49:11,868 --> 00:49:21,803
Scott: we could write I could get a message from someone at steam and then I would get another message from someone at Netrunner dot slack comm and I get a message from my work at Broadway.

787
00:49:21,823 --> 00:49:22,666
Scott: does like calm.

788
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:27,190
Scott: I get a message from Rym Just Rym at front recruit calm just like email.

789
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:31,745
Scott: Xmpp works is everyone could use all these networks and we could tie them all together.

790
00:49:31,765 --> 00:49:38,270
Scott: and you could you know I'd have one app on my phone and every message for every different service would go into the one app all in one place.

791
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:47,131
Rym: Now the way that world did not happen Even though it should have another way around that would be to have clients that can connect to all the networks and aggregate for You.

792
00:49:47,512 --> 00:49:50,321
Rym: but now because of smartphones that's infinitely more complicated.

793
00:49:50,381 --> 00:49:53,390
Scott: all the networks also are like proprietary protocols.

794
00:49:53,511 --> 00:49:55,788
Rym: Your own client for aloe I dare you.

795
00:49:55,889 --> 00:50:00,330
Scott: yeah Can you make an app that like does steam chat like but also think of this the app?

796
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:06,450
Rym: Would now have to sync itself because you have all these different devices that are all connecting to all these things.

797
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:07,314
Scott: That's why you need your.

798
00:50:07,394 --> 00:50:12,313
Scott: we had our own jabber server that did all the xmpp in for us Yeah And then would you just?

799
00:50:12,453 --> 00:50:17,188
Scott: we connected to the one server ourselves and that server had bridges to all the other.

800
00:50:17,268 --> 00:50:20,039
Scott: I have networks Right and work that way.

801
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:21,505
Rym: now remember Twitter was the same way.

802
00:50:21,525 --> 00:50:24,697
Rym: in the early days of Twitter There was that Laconica thing that we used.

803
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:25,842
Rym: that was like federated.

804
00:50:25,862 --> 00:50:27,628
Scott: That was run your own Twitter, right?

805
00:50:27,689 --> 00:50:29,457
Scott: Yeah Yeah, that was we should do.

806
00:50:29,497 --> 00:50:32,190
Scott: that should have been the way it went but they had that software failed.

807
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:33,135
Rym: So well, you know what?

808
00:50:33,175 --> 00:50:34,181
Rym: I think it is written.

809
00:50:34,201 --> 00:50:40,830
Rym: all the software All these networks are funded by companies that have to monetize or companies.

810
00:50:40,991 --> 00:50:43,229
Scott: How does having a messenger network help you monetize?

811
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:44,336
Scott: I don't understand.

812
00:50:44,638 --> 00:50:52,330
Rym: or why even make one or Companies that have a vested interest in getting you into the ecosystem of their shit and keeping you there, right?

813
00:50:52,471 --> 00:51:00,570
Scott: I assume there must be some groups of people out there Right who like steam chat is their chat like their group of teenagers who play steam games.

814
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:01,413
Scott: That's their thing.

815
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:04,021
Scott: and up and steam chat like is their chat.

816
00:51:04,282 --> 00:51:05,024
Scott: They don't make it easy.

817
00:51:05,044 --> 00:51:06,890
Scott: They don't use the other stuff at all.

818
00:51:08,354 --> 00:51:09,416
Scott: They live in steam.

819
00:51:09,456 --> 00:51:10,519
Scott: That's where their life is.

820
00:51:10,659 --> 00:51:11,441
Rym: or you know

821
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:17,929
Scott: by adding a messaging component to your app You're basically allowing people to make it their home

822
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:25,696
Rym: And even if you don't live there, it's just a way to keep you there Like you're done playing a game you quit but before you quit you look in the friends list and you say hey Joey Jojo's online.

823
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,609
Rym: then you mess up saying hey, you want to play some more games?

824
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,154
Rym: Mm-hmm and and cuz.

825
00:51:29,274 --> 00:51:33,330
Rym: every every website every service is obsessed with getting people to stay.

826
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:40,521
Rym: That's why Twitter like the default app if you click on a link, it doesn't just open Chrome It opens its own browser to keep you in Twitter.

827
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:41,727
Scott: Yeah, it's annoying.

828
00:51:41,908 --> 00:51:43,901
Rym: Yeah Everybody's obsessed with that.

829
00:51:44,648 --> 00:51:47,730
Rym: Uh So and also like Google, I don't know what the hell they're doing.

830
00:51:47,831 --> 00:51:49,544
Rym: I really don't understand Allah like.

831
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:54,630
Rym: I cannot Understand why it exists because it's just a shitty version of I mess.

832
00:51:54,750 --> 00:52:00,950
Scott: I think the explanation for why Allah exists is that you'll you it's some internal thing at Google, right?

833
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:02,887
Scott: we're gonna hear a story one day about like.

834
00:52:04,056 --> 00:52:05,889
Scott: This is why they got some team.

835
00:52:06,311 --> 00:52:19,843
Scott: Google did this and that's why they made alo and they were fighting with the hangout team or someone on the hangout team got Fired and there was a political thing and they didn't like that person and they the other people They you know liked and they made alo instead.

836
00:52:19,863 --> 00:52:30,485
Scott: It's like the same, you know I always bring up this story where like when we were kids you watch Disney afternoon the good shows Ducktales the tailspins, right and then suddenly one year.

837
00:52:30,525 --> 00:52:31,890
Scott: It's like alright good shows gone.

838
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:38,917
Scott: Now we're doing Aladdin and Timon and Pumbaa and shows based on our movies Characters and not original shows.

839
00:52:39,218 --> 00:52:41,084
Scott: and these shows aren't as good as the old shows.

840
00:52:41,165 --> 00:52:42,490
Scott: and why did they do that?

841
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:52,330
Scott: It wasn't cuz the old shows weren't successful or anything Because there's an executive shakeup at Disney and the new executive wanted to do something different and the old executive did and that's what happened.

842
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:56,689
Scott: So there's a story like that that will explain alo hangout, etc.

843
00:52:57,272 --> 00:53:05,870
Rym: so in terms of monetization to like look at Twitter is a big example of that and a bunch of the I am things over the Years and all these little social media networks or social networks.

844
00:53:06,292 --> 00:53:09,609
Rym: They would be funded by VCS who wanted a big payout at some point.

845
00:53:10,213 --> 00:53:12,730
Rym: So they had to monetize in particular ways.

846
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:21,417
Rym: But they also had a whole bunch of capital to sort of push themselves out there and get adopted Widely before they had a monetization model.

847
00:53:21,979 --> 00:53:27,494
Rym: Meanwhile a federated model sort of kicks monetization Into the ground, right?

848
00:53:27,554 --> 00:53:35,881
Scott: It's like oh if you because if you're federated then to most of your users You actually end up just being infrastructure, right?

849
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:38,450
Scott: Because they're not seeing any of your stuff.

850
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:41,022
Scott: They're not using your client that could have ads in it.

851
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,830
Scott: They're not looking at your brand.

852
00:53:43,312 --> 00:53:45,340
Scott: They're just using their own stuff.

853
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,107
Scott: in a case, you know, you become just.

854
00:53:47,429 --> 00:54:00,450
Scott: you know a dumb pipe your messages and some people will be using your client because they prefer it over others, but Most people will be other people talking to your users and it's not to say there aren't ways to monetize that sort of thing.

855
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:03,778
Rym: I actually came up with a bunch of them, but I'm not as easy.

856
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:11,943
Scott: I think a good way to If you have big networks federating with each other just charge each other money.

857
00:54:11,963 --> 00:54:14,010
Scott: Yeah, just be like, all right, we're Google.

858
00:54:14,654 --> 00:54:18,213
Scott: Oh you want to federate, you know, the steam messages and the Google messages All right valve.

859
00:54:18,253 --> 00:54:22,229
Scott: and Google exchange money with each other and now all the users can chat with each other for free.

860
00:54:22,571 --> 00:54:38,160
Rym: Well, like say I was making say Twitter if I in the earliest days if I wanted to federate it instead of running it 100% myself or be like Laconica or monetize Laconica you run the main service free to get people use it or whatever but Maybe you are the server to run.

861
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:48,861
Rym: the federated thing is not open source or free Mm-hmm, but you can just buy it and run it and the pricing is tiered based on your usage Like two schmucks with a podcast want to run their federated server.

862
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,330
Rym: Yeah, like hundred bucks a year go nuts, right?

863
00:54:51,791 --> 00:55:02,950
Rym: I mean, you know, it's like but Microsoft wants to run their own And maybe have some enterprise features like an internal only version or encryption or like data tracking stuff.

864
00:55:03,396 --> 00:55:08,818
Rym: I ain't gonna pay yeah, but that's a much more complicated monetization model.

865
00:55:09,219 --> 00:55:14,755
Rym: then take VC money and then figure out a way to profit from a service that You literally hold by the throat.

866
00:55:14,775 --> 00:55:18,245
Scott: I just don't know why anyone's making a new a new thing.

867
00:55:18,265 --> 00:55:19,730
Scott: That's only messaging, right?

868
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:23,690
Scott: It's like if you you might be making a new product that should include messaging.

869
00:55:24,192 --> 00:55:27,082
Scott: But why make a new messaging only serve?

870
00:55:27,102 --> 00:55:29,370
Rym: So what's the difference between messaging and like Twitter?

871
00:55:31,252 --> 00:55:34,710
Scott: Because Twitter is not just direct messaging, right?

872
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:41,504
Rym: Broadcasting to the whole world Twitter's like having a public conversation in a big like.

873
00:55:41,585 --> 00:55:42,527
Scott: feel no Twitter.

874
00:55:42,587 --> 00:55:46,123
Scott: the way I see Twitter Twitter is really closer to IRC right?

875
00:55:46,203 --> 00:55:51,530
Scott: Imagine IRC chat room But you obviously you can only chat 140 characters at a time, right?

876
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:52,173
Scott: Yeah, it just.

877
00:55:52,234 --> 00:55:53,926
Scott: it just stops letting you type when you hit 140, right?

878
00:55:54,430 --> 00:56:12,065
Scott: But otherwise IRC and now everyone in the whole world that matters is in the same IRC channel and it's just a flood like oh shit Right, but that's okay because when you join it when you join this channel by default Everyone is on mute and it's absolutely quiet

879
00:56:12,105 --> 00:56:13,089
Rym: and your own man you

880
00:56:13,511 --> 00:56:20,470
Scott: Unmute specific people in this and this IRC channel that has everyone in the world and that's Twitter, right?

881
00:56:20,751 --> 00:56:31,912
Scott: It's not you know, Google Hangout, which is I Specifically message one person or a specific handcraft, you know Hand grab two group of people each time Right.

882
00:56:32,073 --> 00:56:33,276
Scott: Yeah, which is totally it's.

883
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:38,770
Scott: you know, you wouldn't use Twitter to be like, hey, you know, what do you check out?

884
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:39,688
Scott: You know, what are you doing?

885
00:56:42,071 --> 00:56:53,037
Scott: Specifically, right you'd only use it for like hey entire world Yeah, well in the look at snapchat the idea of the ephemeral chat Like right, yeah you chatting it goes.

886
00:56:53,057 --> 00:56:58,198
Rym: that's actually surprisingly popular and a lot of people even people We know use it as their main.

887
00:56:58,278 --> 00:56:58,982
Rym: I am client.

888
00:56:59,323 --> 00:57:06,167
Rym: Yeah, they don't care about the archive Sure, but I guess for me like my use case is this the good I am.

889
00:57:06,187 --> 00:57:11,073
