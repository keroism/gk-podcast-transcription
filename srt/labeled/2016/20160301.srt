00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,500
Rym: It's Super Tuesday, March 1st, 2016.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:11,661
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:14,226
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,894
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:22,010
Rym: Tonight, we're talking about Thebes, the reprint of Genocides von Theben.

6
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:25,589
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,450
Rym: So remember how last week I was complaining about how I had to fly to Southern California for one meeting?

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,948
Rym: Well, we're recording this show in advance because I'm in London right now.

9
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:40,870
Rym: Literally for like one day of a convention, so I'll be back.

10
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:42,650
Scott: Well, it's a convention and not a one-hour meeting.

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,558
Rym: Yeah, it is a convention.

12
00:00:43,578 --> 00:00:44,570
Rym: It's like a whole day convention.

13
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:51,850
Rym: And I had to have the days before and after the convention free to be able to go to meetings.

14
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:55,430
Rym: I don't know if we'll have any meetings lined up, so I might just be fucking around in London.

15
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,670
Rym: So if any of you are in London...

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,525
Scott: Just don't line up meetings.

17
00:00:58,565 --> 00:00:58,749
Scott: Oops.

18
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,970
Rym: If any of you... Well, I'd like to line up a few meetings because if those meetings turn into money, I can take some of that money.

19
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,029
Rym: But if any of you are in London...

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,164
Scott: You get commissions on the...

21
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:09,030
Rym: I can, depending.

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,270
Rym: Actually, as for a commission, I've usually stood up our whole Australian business.

23
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:17,510
Rym: In fact, I get to go to Australia again in May, probably, and then I'm probably going to make him pay for me to go to PAX Australia.

24
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:18,879
Scott: That's not in May.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,570
Scott: It's in October.

26
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,128
Rym: I'm getting two Australia trips this year.

27
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:22,716
Rym: At least.

28
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:30,825
Rym: Anyway... So if any of you are in London and you're listening to this on Tuesday, I'm landing in London right about now, your time.

29
00:01:34,472 --> 00:01:37,990
Rym: And yeah, maybe we can hang out, especially on, like, Wednesday during the day.

30
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,829
Rym: I'll meet you in a pub and drink a beer and such.

31
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:43,330
Rym: So, gaming news.

32
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:52,227
Scott: Yeah, so the biggest, you know, deal right now, I guess, and really the only gaming news recently... Is that Street Fighter V came out.

33
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:52,368
Scott: Woo!

34
00:01:52,891 --> 00:02:01,785
Rym: No, it's interesting because... I don't know if it... I remember a time when, like, if I tweeted about things that weren't anime, like, certain people would be like, "Ugh, why are you talking about this other

35
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:02,107
Rym: shit?".

36
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,250
Rym: You know, just in, like, Anna Twitter and R-General.

37
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,650
Rym: But now, like, everyone in my Twitter feed always talks about the same thing, or at least a lot of them do.

38
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,410
Rym: So Street Fighter was the focus of, like, half my Twitter a few days ago.

39
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,830
Scott: Right, so if you weren't paying attention, Street Fighter V came out.

40
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,390
Scott: I've been seeing it at PAX for quite a while and other conventions and whatnot.

41
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:20,038
Scott: So it's Street Fighter.

42
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,369
Scott: If you know Street Fighter, this is it.

43
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,450
Scott: It's just a new one with more characters, upgraded graphics, that sort of thing.

44
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:38,730
Scott: One big change they did that I actually think is a positive change... Is they increased the buffer window and they sort of automatic... They did a bunch of stuff and basically all that you care about is that it makes it easier to do special moves.

45
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:47,730
Scott: You can be less accurate and you will still execute your special move and your combo as if you had been very accurate with your... And precise with your button pressing.

46
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:57,050
Rym: I do like that change because I don't think there are that many people in the world who will excel beyond that to the point that it matters.

47
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:05,130
Scott: And Street Fighter IV pro players, you know, and really... I mean, not necessarily the top of the pros who might have been so good they didn't need to do this.

48
00:03:05,611 --> 00:03:10,870
Scott: But extremely good players would, like, double tap because Street Fighter IV required you to be so precise.

49
00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:13,369
Scott: They'd, like, hit it twice to make sure they got it.

50
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:19,710
Rym: But I'm saying this will broaden the top tier a little bit and I think it will be a net positive for the game.

51
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,131
Scott: Maybe.

52
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:25,050
Scott: So the problem with Street Fighter V is that this release... Basically, they weren't done with the game and they put it out anyway.

53
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:31,390
Scott: The only things really in this release are multiplayer, just play online, and they did improve the netcode.

54
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,410
Scott: It's, like, the best fighting game netcode that's ever existed, as far as I know.

55
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:41,510
Scott: There's a story mode, but the story mode isn't even the story mode you're used to in Street Fighter.

56
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,850
Scott: They didn't even include that, which is, you know, you pick a character, you fight every single character until you beat the boss.

57
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,550
Rym: You get a couple of cutscenes along the way.

58
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,770
Scott: Well, there's usually no cutscenes until the very end when you win, right?

59
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:58,490
Scott: I mean, for at least in Street Fighter II, but this... Basically, story mode is, like, you fight, like, a few guys.

60
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,990
Scott: It's, like, a really crappy story mode with, like, almost nothing in it.

61
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:02,869
Scott: It's, like, garbage.

62
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,729
Scott: And, like, there's no training.

63
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:08,850
Scott: There's, like, nothing in the game.

64
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,290
Scott: These didn't finish any of those things.

65
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,385
Scott: They're, like, "Yeah, we'll patch it later.

66
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:13,928
Scott: We'll patch it

67
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:14,150
Scott: later.".

68
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,269
Scott: It's, like, why did you release it undone like this?

69
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:25,370
Rym: They released it undone for the fighting game community, like, the pro players and the people who care about fighting games and shorten it to FG and all that.

70
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,303
Scott: But that's not a large number of people.

71
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:28,350
Scott: You're gonna sell it to them.

72
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,690
Scott: And, meanwhile, it's, like, no one's gonna go back and, like, re-review the game and update the review once you make the updates.

73
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:34,487
Rym: I wonder...

74
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:41,110
Scott: It's a bad... It's not good in its current state, and it's gonna have a reputation for being bad forever because the initial release is bad.

75
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:42,510
Rym: I don't know if that, like, should be much of a concern.

76
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:48,209
Scott: And it's gonna be very, very hard now for non-pro players to become pro because usually...

77
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,410
Rym: Yeah, because that training mode in Street Fighter IV was so fucking useful.

78
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,590
Scott: It wasn't useful, but it's better than nothing, right?

79
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,207
Scott: But here's the thing.

80
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:09,530
Scott: Even if, you know, you have a game where it's really hard, so it's, you know, like Street Fighter IV, let's say, at least the game is complete from the get-go so everyone can start at the beginning.

81
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:13,850
Scott: Even though some people might have a head start from previous Street Fighters, but pretend it's a brand new fighting game, right?

82
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,950
Scott: That doesn't have a legacy.

83
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,170
Scott: Everyone can start learning from the same, you know, level at the same time.

84
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:23,450
Scott: This is a game where, at release, only pros can play it.

85
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,290
Scott: It's only playable by pros.

86
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,470
Scott: So now you gave all the pros a head start.

87
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:38,629
Scott: All the pros are already learning Street Fighter V. The people who might possibly become pros of Street Fighter V, you know, the kid who's just now become old enough to play a fighting game and understand it?

88
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:43,410
Scott: And will practice enough in his life or her life to become a Street Fighter master.

89
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,899
Scott: They can't play this because it's the floor.

90
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,850
Scott: We're not talking about the ceiling.

91
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,780
Scott: We're talking about the floor to even play.

92
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,429
Scott: the game is too high.

93
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,149
Rym: Well, they could just play Street Fighter IV, raise themselves, and then play V.

94
00:05:57,151 --> 00:06:00,950
Scott: It's, I mean, I think the transition is, like, it's pretty significantly different.

95
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,970
Scott: I mean, it's, yeah, you could do that, but I don't know.

96
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,210
Rym: I mean, how do you think the pros do it?

97
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,350
Rym: They had to do that transition.

98
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:12,610
Scott: I'm just saying, Street Fighter V has got a lot of issues right now, and it's making a big fuss in the fighting game community.

99
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:16,090
Scott: The fighting game community loves to talk big.

100
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,909
Scott: You know, this is the thing I've taken out of this, you know, hubbub that's happened around the release of this game, right?

101
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:29,050
Scott: Is the fighting game community likes to talk big about how such a good community it is, except for, you know, right?

102
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,650
Scott: And all the positive aspects of the fighting community, which many of them do exist, right?

103
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:36,350
Scott: There's also a lot of negative aspects in the fighting game community.

104
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:37,449
Rym: Oh, yes, there are.

105
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:47,430
Scott: But they have, you know, many people in the fighting game community, or fighting communities, have, you know, pointed that out as also being bad and that they don't like it, right?

106
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:51,527
Scott: However, you know, we're talking about, like, behavior and harassment and such, right?

107
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:52,150
Scott: That sort of thing.

108
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:58,990
Rym: I think fighting games might be, of all the game sub-genres, I think fighting games probably actually have the worst culture.

109
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:10,482
Scott: Maybe, but the one thing I realized is that, you know, even though, you know, we can put a lot of blame on the people who make fighting games for making them hard to learn, and we've discussed this in the past, right?

110
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:11,530
Scott: Where, like, everything's a secret.

111
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,129
Scott: You know, go listen to, like, when we talked about Street Fighter IV years ago.

112
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,950
Rym: Yeah, like Counter-Strike doesn't have any way for you to, like, double shoot if you time it just right.

113
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:26,890
Scott: But the fighting game community, if you want to talk big about how great you are, make some tutorials that actually teach people how to play your fucking games.

114
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,491
Scott: 'Cause you know what?

115
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:28,674
Scott: I went online looking.

116
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:35,390
Scott: Can I even find a fan-made tutorial that teaches the basics of Street Fighter?

117
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:42,188
Rym: Now, you might already be saying, "But Scott, the manual tells me to do a Hadoken, I go down, down and right, right, and I hit

118
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:42,609
Rym: punch.".

119
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:43,279
Scott: Sure.

120
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:44,710
Rym: That's what-- Tells me all the secret moves.

121
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:50,290
Scott: And that's what almost all the tutorials will tell you, is to press down, down, right, right, and then punch, right?

122
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,273
Scott: And it shows you these four icons.

123
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:54,957
Scott: That doesn't teach you jack shit.

124
00:07:55,017 --> 00:08:04,010
Scott: Can I press down, then move the joystick to the middle, then to the down, right, then back to the middle, then to the right, then back to the middle, then press a punch button?

125
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,293
Scott: Fuck no, you can't.

126
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:07,058
Scott: You can't do that shit, right?

127
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,910
Scott: Okay, I have to push down, then I swing it to the right in an arc.

128
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,809
Rym: Alright, now that's fine.

129
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,452
Scott: That's fine.

130
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:14,338
Scott: How fast do I have to swing it in an arc?

131
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:16,064
Scott: Can I swing it slowly through that arc?

132
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:17,770
Scott: Like, tick, tick, tick.

133
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,760
Scott: Or do I have to go, tick, tick, tick?

134
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,687
Scott: How fast do I have to do it, exactly?

135
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:23,068
Scott: How fast?

136
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,572
Rym: Maybe it doesn't even matter, but the problem is, even if all that stuff is sort of-- When exactly do I press the punch button?

137
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,599
Scott: Do I press the punch button at the same time as the stick reaches the right hand position?

138
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:35,482
Scott: Do I push it after it reaches the right hand position?

139
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:37,326
Scott: How long do I have to wait before?

140
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,029
Scott: Which punch button can I push?

141
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:39,710
Scott: Right?

142
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,215
Scott: No one teaches you any of that shit.

143
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:48,265
Scott: I actually found one tutorial where the guy actually did show you--his joystick was like a little tiny thing.

144
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:50,810
Scott: You can actually see the joystick in the bottom right corner.

145
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,737
Scott: And while he wasn't showing it well, he was at least showing it.

146
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:58,730
Scott: And he did teach how to do the Hadouken better than I've seen anyone teach it.

147
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,570
Scott: He then went on to the Shoryuken and didn't teach jack shit.

148
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:03,392
Scott: Right?

149
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:07,081
Scott: He's just like-- He's just like, "Yeah, Shoryuken, same as Hadouken.

150
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:08,469
Scott: It's right, then down, then down

151
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:08,690
Scott: forward.".

152
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,750
Rym: Fighting games could be designed differently to where that minutia wouldn't matter.

153
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:19,390
Rym: But the fact is, with Street Fighter specifically, that minutia, like that frame timing, is the entire game.

154
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,615
Scott: I don't even know the answer to this question, right?

155
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:26,910
Scott: And I've been playing Street Fighter since it was only Street Fighter II in the arcade, not even Championship Edition, right?

156
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,710
Scott: If you want to do a Shoryuken, you have to go right, then down, then down forward, then punch, right?

157
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:37,144
Scott: I know that you can press punch pretty much very soon after you press down forward.

158
00:09:37,164 --> 00:09:37,685
Scott: I know that.

159
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:39,630
Scott: I was just asking it rhetorically before, right?

160
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,071
Rym: Yeah.

161
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:41,510
Rym: I mean, I can do it reliably.

162
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,183
Scott: I can do it mostly reliably, right?

163
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:45,309
Scott: But here's the question I don't know.

164
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:54,850
Scott: So you press right, then when you're moving the stick from the right position to the down position, are you allowed to pass through the down right position on your way there?

165
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,889
Rym: I don't think I do.

166
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,324
Scott: Are you allowed to pass through, because I mean, the joystick only has like three ways to go, right?

167
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:03,170
Scott: It can go to the neutral position and then down.

168
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:10,740
Scott: It can go to the down right position and then to the down position, or you can sort of sneak between the two at like an angle, right?

169
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:18,510
Scott: If it's a square box joystick hole, you can sort of go at an angle from right to down, just sort of sneak between neutral and down right.

170
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,429
Rym: I think I bring it back and then I go down and then I swing it.

171
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:21,670
Scott: Right.

172
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,274
Scott: But it's like, are you allowed?

173
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:31,049
Scott: I mean, like, even if I experiment with those three, which I have done for a considerable amount of time, sometimes a Shoryuken comes out and sometimes it doesn't.

174
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:38,130
Scott: And I can't really prove conclusively which of those three paths you're allowed to take.

175
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,170
Scott: Now, again, you can make a fighting game.

176
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,990
Scott: And nobody, not one tutorial on the internet will tell me a definitive answer.

177
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:48,710
Rym: Now, these things could be addressed by game design.

178
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:58,670
Scott: If I tell them how to do a Shoryuken or teach one of my friends who's never played a fighting game in their lives, but happens to be a smart person who's a nerd, how to do a Shoryuken, what the fuck do I tell them?

179
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:05,230
Rym: Now, the thing is, as a kid, Scott, even without any of that, I was able to do all those moves most of the time reliably.

180
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,441
Scott: But I got to do them 100% of the time.

181
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:25,850
Rym: Yeah, the problem I'm getting at is that because the games rely on that really fiddliness to be the competitive scene above even, like, Baby's first level, it makes it to where the community has a vested interest in not making it all super clear because it adds this artificial barrier to entry that makes their skills that much more special.

182
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:30,670
Scott: I'm going to talk about even one more example just because this bothers me so much, right?

183
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,479
Scott: So M. Bison is my guy, right?

184
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:34,770
Scott: Well, dictator, because he's not M. Bison in other countries.

185
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,670
Rym: Psycho crusher, psycho crusher, psycho crusher.

186
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,236
Scott: So I know how to do a charge move.

187
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:41,610
Scott: I hold back for a little while and then I press forward and then punch, right?

188
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,590
Scott: Should I do my psycho crusher and my scissor kick?

189
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,916
Scott: I can't even do the jumping on.

190
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:47,450
Scott: I can do these moves relatively reliably, right?

191
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:49,767
Scott: Here's something I don't actually know, right?

192
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:56,010
Scott: So you have to charge down, which means you have to hold the stick down for, you know, I assume it's like two seconds.

193
00:11:56,731 --> 00:12:01,445
Scott: I usually just sort of feel it, but I'm pretty sure it's two seconds on the clock in the game, right?

194
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:03,250
Scott: The clock in the middle of the screen there.

195
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:04,874
Scott: So here's a question.

196
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:09,590
Scott: If I jump in the air and while I'm in the air, you know, just in a regular jump, I tap up.

197
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:15,510
Scott: If I tap up and then immediately hold down, but I'm still in this jumping animation, I haven't hit the ground yet, right?

198
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:19,929
Scott: And maybe I hold, you know, I go from, I go up then down right away, like really quick.

199
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,410
Scott: So I'm holding down even though I'm only in the up motion of the jump.

200
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:28,030
Scott: By the time I hit the ground, I've already held the stick down for like a second and a half.

201
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,150
Scott: So I was about to say, I think I immediately press up and kick to do the head stomp right out of that.

202
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:37,330
Scott: Or did the charging not count because I wasn't on the ground?

203
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,290
Rym: I was about to say, I think it counts, but I realized here's a panel you could do.

204
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,770
Rym: I don't want to run it because we don't even know anyone qualified to do it.

205
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:53,270
Rym: So what you do is you have a panel of street fighter champion guys, like 10 of them, and you ask them questions like that.

206
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:58,650
Rym: And they have to write their answer on a whiteboard, match game style, and then they all reveal.

207
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:06,970
Rym: And then we have the super pro who's running the panel do the motion and see what happens in a very defined manner, maybe tool assisted.

208
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:14,890
Rym: So it would be very interesting to see a panel of 10 street fighter champions if they agree on the answers to all those kinds of questions.

209
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:15,910
Rym: Because I suspect...

210
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,460
Scott: Right, and it's like, okay, so I'm going to do this hago crusher.

211
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,970
Scott: You hold back for two seconds, then forward and punch, right?

212
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:28,389
Scott: What if I hold back and up and you do a back away jump and I'm still holding, I'm back, but I'm also holding back up, right?

213
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,238
Scott: And then I sort of transition into holding back as I go towards the ground.

214
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:36,147
Scott: Can I unleash the psycho crusher when I land from the backwards jump?

215
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:37,530
Scott: Am I allowed to do that?

216
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:49,110
Rym: Now, this is all in sort of stark light to the experience we had at Magfest because I played a bunch of the Fist of the North Star fighting game, which I mentioned this and Darryl Surratt pointed out that the game actually has infinite combos.

217
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:49,790
Rym: Nice.

218
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:50,769
Rym: Like it's completely broken.

219
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:54,750
Rym: But none of us had ever played it before.

220
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:55,067
Rym: Nope.

221
00:13:55,371 --> 00:14:00,330
Rym: And most of the people at the con had maybe played it at the previous Magfest at best.

222
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:05,323
Scott: So... I didn't see, I'm sure someone at the con was pro at it.

223
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:06,990
Scott: I didn't see any such person.

224
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:14,770
Rym: So when I played it with our friends and I played it a bunch and I played it with just strangers, like I did the old like arcade pickup game stuff, it was real fun.

225
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:23,010
Scott: Fighting games are hella fun if everyone is at the same skill level, which is why pros at fighting games have hella fun because the people they're fighting against are also pros.

226
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:32,910
Rym: But I guess the difference is with a lot of other games, like especially a lot of board games, but also a lot of like competitive video games, you sort of, once you hit the level of master, there usually isn't a pro circuit.

227
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:35,950
Rym: So then you and your friends all just give up on the game.

228
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,490
Scott: There's no magical drop pro circuit.

229
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,390
Rym: Yeah, you move on to a different game.

230
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:44,110
Rym: But with fighting games, you pretty much get into that tier and live that life forever.

231
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,606
Scott: So the news is Street Fighter V is out, pros only.

232
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:47,130
Scott: What's your news?

233
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:56,670
Rym: I don't think it affects their sales at all, and I think that Street Fighter basically caters to and relies on the fighting game community and doesn't give a shit about the casual anymore.

234
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,610
Scott: Also, it's even more pervy than the previous Street Fighter, yet still not in Dead or Alive territory.

235
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,675
Rym: Yeah.

236
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:05,530
Scott: Also, I was reminded that- But there's like a new character who's bus just hanging out.

237
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,817
Rym: You wanna talk about story modes?

238
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:09,430
Rym: Bushido Blade 2 had one hell of a story mode.

239
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,910
Scott: Alright, do your news.

240
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,638
Rym: So, let me go back here to my link.

241
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,862
Rym: Got a bunch of links about this.

242
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:17,490
Rym: Fire Emblem Fates got released in the US.

243
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:19,430
Scott: Is that a 3DS Fire Emblem?

244
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:19,765
Scott: Yes.

245
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:20,361
Scott: Oh, okay.

246
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:27,090
Scott: One of our friends- Considering that I was never able to finish any of the GBA or DS Fire Emblems, I am not going to buy or play this one.

247
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,630
Rym: I'm not going to either because I'm done with Fire Emblem games.

248
00:15:29,851 --> 00:15:30,610
Scott: I'm also done.

249
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,010
Rym: I played the most recent one before this on the 3DS all the way through.

250
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,648
Rym: And I gotta admit, they're not that good as games.

251
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:47,270
Scott: I mean, when my Pegasus, who's way far away from everyone, just gets like one-shotted and then I have to restart the whole game.

252
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,854
Scott: Well, because the games are puzzles.

253
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:55,350
Rym: They're very much- it's a puzzle, grind through it, or learn the magic sauce, or learn the perfect way.

254
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:57,849
Rym: It's not the kind of game it looks like it is.

255
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,390
Scott: Yeah, do the mission, figure out what it is, and do it again after you reset your system so you know what's coming.

256
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:07,410
Rym: But anyway, so the game came out in Japan, and it didn't come out of the US until some months later.

257
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:14,990
Rym: So fan-subbing groups fucking went apeshit trying to translate this game before Nintendo released it.

258
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:19,270
Rym: And the reason they did this is because they were afraid of Nintendo censorship.

259
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:26,550
Rym: Now, what they mean by censorship is that Nintendo of America removed one scene from the game that was pretty much just straight-up homophobic.

260
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:31,310
Rym: They covered up one bikini shot of, I'm pretty sure, an underage character.

261
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:35,010
Scott: Japan, why you do these things in the first place?

262
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,970
Rym: They removed a game where you can use your finger to pet your characters.

263
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,664
Scott: I never saw any of these things in a previous Fire Emblem.

264
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:43,690
Scott: What happened?

265
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,254
Scott: It's like they made it worse.

266
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:47,279
Scott: It was just a regular old fantasy thing.

267
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:51,590
Scott: I didn't know any of this stuff was in any Fire Emblem I've ever seen.

268
00:16:51,650 --> 00:17:03,550
Rym: The most egregious sin that Nintendo of America apparently committed on this game is they did a real translation and localization instead of a weeaboo exact word minakama translation.

269
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:09,930
Rym: So welcome, video game people, to the world of animo weeaboo bullshit.

270
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,200
Rym: Welcome to the fan-subbers of America.

271
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,270
Rym: This shit is amazing, what people are mad about.

272
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:23,550
Rym: They're mad that instead of doing a word-for-word literal terrible translation, they actually localized the game and made it funny.

273
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,673
Rym: Because you know what?

274
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:25,415
Rym: Fire Emblem games?

275
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,762
Rym: Not really well known for their writing.

276
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,850
Rym: In fact, the writing kind of shit.

277
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:34,930
Scott: Go listen to the interview we did with Oda King and you'll hear everything you need to know about this topic.

278
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:36,737
Scott: That was so many years ago.

279
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:38,062
Scott: We lived in Beacon then.

280
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:40,090
Scott: It was more than a zillion years ago.

281
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:54,700
Rym: So basically the game came out and all the fan-subber people made the same arguments that the anime weeaboo fan-subber people make about how, "Well, if you're not going to release the thing in its pure form, then I'm not going to buy it.

282
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,888
Rym: Good luck selling it on our market, you pieces of shit, with your fake

283
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:58,530
Rym: translations.".

284
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,421
Rym: And they were like, "I'm boycotting the game.

285
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:01,486
Rym: I'm going to play my pirated

286
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:01,949
Rym: copy.".

287
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:08,410
Rym: And as far as I can tell, this game outsold any Fire Emblem game ever in North America already.

288
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:10,896
Scott: Well, it's not like they print that many copies.

289
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:16,930
Scott: So usually, I was really big into Nintendo portable games for a long time.

290
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,516
Scott: And I still kind of am.

291
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,010
Scott: It's just they haven't released the kind that I want to play recently.

292
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:27,630
Scott: But it's like when they were the big thing, GBA, DS, from Game Boy Color to DS, I was getting all the hot games.

293
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:30,557
Scott: Like all the Phoenix Rites and all that, right?

294
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:35,650
Scott: And those games, those really hot games that they wouldn't print a lot of copies.

295
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:36,875
Scott: So they would be hard to get.

296
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:40,650
Scott: You'd have to get them unreleased, pre-order them from Amazon or somewhere.

297
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,209
Scott: And then they'd be out of print and they'd be worth a lot of money.

298
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:49,690
Scott: So this is just another one of those where it comes out and you got to get it because there aren't that many copies.

299
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,702
Rym: Oh my god, I saw another headline, "The ass Nintendo doesn't want you to

300
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:54,224
Rym: see.".

301
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:55,750
Rym: Cool it, kids.

302
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:59,309
Scott: The ass that they shouldn't have had in Japan probably to begin with.

303
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:06,450
Rym: Yeah, I mean, if you really care that much, I mean, this is the speech I would give to the weebs.

304
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,996
Rym: But I guess now weebs are infiltrating gaming.

305
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:13,430
Rym: If you care that much about a pure translation, maybe you should learn Japanese.

306
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:25,469
Scott: I was about to say, this is yet another example of Scott's peeve, which is, "Oh look, there's a person who is doing a large amount of labor, so much labor, to avoid learning

307
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:25,930
Scott: something.".

308
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:32,290
Scott: It would be less work to learn Japanese than to simply, you know, than to translate this game.

309
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:40,630
Scott: But because people hate learning so much, they would rather do the extra labor of translating this whole fucking thing than just learning a new language.

310
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:44,450
Scott: Which, while not easy, is easier than translating this game.

311
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,502
Rym: The fan translation, as far as I can tell, is terrible.

312
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:50,769
Rym: It has, like, no life.

313
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,750
Scott: Do we have even one example of comparing the real translation to the fan translation?

314
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,130
Rym: I have a few, but they're not really illustrative enough of the point.

315
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:04,769
Rym: But apparently there's one scene where two assassins have this really, sort of, typical animu discussion about, "I'm such a

316
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:05,110
Rym: badass.".

317
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:05,639
Rym: "No, I'm such a

318
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:05,965
Rym: badass.".

319
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,284
Scott: "I didn't show my full

320
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:07,628
Scott: power.".

321
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,457
Rym: And it's kind of this conversation here.

322
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:12,430
Rym: So the localizers took it as a joke.

323
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:22,910
Rym: And for that one conversation, because it's these two badass, loner, serial killer assassins, it just had them have this long conversation that's "dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot

324
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,050
Rym: dot.".

325
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,009
Scott: It sounds like they didn't want to translate it and just put "dot dot dot

326
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:26,110
Scott: dot.".

327
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:27,380
Rym: Yeah, but I read the conversation.

328
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,510
Rym: There's not much going on in there.

329
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,030
Scott: I mean, it would be funny if it was a GoGo 13 reference.

330
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:39,650
Rym: But all the examples I can find are basically just the Nintendo America translation is, it reads like something someone would say in a movie.

331
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:48,668
Rym: And the fan translation is, "Here's a bunch of Japanese verbs and nouns translated directly so they don't make a lot of sense in the order that they're not

332
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:49,069
Rym: presented.".

333
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:50,910
Scott: Nakama sword zone.

334
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:51,304
Scott: Yeah.

335
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:53,070
Rym: Okay.

336
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,673
Rym: In the moment, we're going to be at PAX East performing on Sunday at, I believe, 3 or 3.30 p.m.

337
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:04,034
Rym: Atari Game Design.

338
00:21:07,441 --> 00:21:12,035
Rym: We did this at PAX South, and people lined up way in advance.

339
00:21:12,055 --> 00:21:13,760
Rym: The room was completely filled.

340
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,260
Rym: I think it's one of our best new panels.

341
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,420
Scott: I don't think it's that good a panel, but it's what they accepted.

342
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:26,400
Rym: People really liked it, even though I would rather be doing design and game rules, because I feel like that'll actually have more impact on games that I play down the road.

343
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:31,440
Rym: But we've got video of that one from PAX South, so I'll probably get the video of that up this weekend.

344
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,769
Rym: Otherwise, other conventions are coming up.

345
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:37,740
Rym: Mocha's coming up, so remember to come to New York and go to that.

346
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,520
Rym: Emily will have a table at Mocha, so stay tuned for that business.

347
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:42,139
Scott: Okay.

348
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:46,060
Rym: And I guess it's time to talk about a game, because we played a bunch of games.

349
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,320
Scott: What about Things of the Day?

350
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,440
Rym: Oh yeah, you want to do Things of the Day?

351
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:48,813
Rym: Yeah.

352
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,778
Rym: We'll do those next now.

353
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:57,039
Scott: So, this is not related to gaming in any way, unless you want to talk about some Sesame Street games, like I had one for the NES.

354
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:57,580
Scott: that was okay.

355
00:21:58,945 --> 00:21:59,699
Scott: It's actually kind of creepy.

356
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,800
Scott: But yeah, so here's a recipe for a baked good known as Cookie Monster Bark.

357
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:09,360
Scott: It is basically one big sheet cookie that looks like Cookie Monster.

358
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,359
Rym: Oh, that kind of bark.

359
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:17,520
Scott: Because you put blue frosting on it, and then you put Candy Googly's eyes on it, and then you put, you know, cookies in it.

360
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,060
Scott: And it looks like Cookie Monster, and then you break it up into pieces of bark, and then you eat it.

361
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,640
Scott: So, I'm going to bake this this weekend, and Rym's going to leave town, and then I'm going to eat it when he's not here.

362
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:28,351
Rym: Ah, Emily steals some for me.

363
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:29,198
Rym: Oh no.

364
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,944
Rym: So, my Thing of the Day.

365
00:22:32,245 --> 00:22:36,920
Rym: So, remember way back, we did that bad games lecture at a bunch of PAXes, and we did it all over the place.

366
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:43,480
Rym: This is a fun lecture to do, but there's one section of it where we basically shit all over racewalking for being bullshit.

367
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,739
Scott: Racewalking is bullshit.

368
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,020
Scott: Yep.

369
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:53,020
Rym: So, I pulled that part out and put it as his own YouTube video, and basically, I pretty regularly see the comments people write on it.

370
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,874
Rym: Like, "Stop embarrassing

371
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:55,299
Rym: yourself!".

372
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:05,420
Rym: Racewalkers really butter about this video, because if you search for racewalking on YouTube, on the front page, two of the videos are people talking about how stupid racewalking is.

373
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,028
Rym: Us, and that SciShow.

374
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:08,917
Rym: that's like, "Yeah, everyone

375
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:09,259
Rym: cheats.".

376
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:22,200
Rym: So, I was reminded, because this keeps coming up, and I wanted to give a video to someone who was complaining about us, and it was that old, old, old Thing of the Day we did in like 2006.

377
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,349
Rym: Samurai are coming.

378
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,740
Rym: Will he run?

379
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:26,178
Scott: I don't remember this.

380
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:27,652
Rym: It was your Thing of the Day.

381
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:28,540
Rym: You don't remember anything.

382
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,380
Scott: That's why it was so good.

383
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:31,280
Rym: So, I found the old episode.

384
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,267
Scott: You can't even beat my Things of the Day.

385
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,120
Scott: You gotta take my own Thing of the Day from the past and bring it back.

386
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,225
Rym: It might have been my Thing of the Day.

387
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:39,899
Rym: I don't actually remember, but I can go check, but I found the episode.

388
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,140
Scott: That was back in the days when I would use Japanese television for all my Things of the Day.

389
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,380
Rym: And of course, the link was super broken, because every Thing of the Day link is broken.

390
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,767
Rym: So, it actually took me a while to find this again, but here it is.

391
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:57,780
Rym: This is a video, and because I put so much work into finding it again, I want you to all see it.

392
00:23:58,862 --> 00:24:07,119
Rym: This is a professional Olympic race walker who apparently does not actually know much about Japan, because he's not American.

393
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:11,140
Rym: I think he's Italian or something, but basically he does not know much about Japan.

394
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,220
Rym: So, this is, even by Japanese prank standards, pretty elaborate.

395
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:27,300
Rym: They put fake news on TVs in all the restaurants, in his hotel, everywhere he was, talking about how there's been a samurai uprising.

396
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:32,393
Rym: So, he's had this background of news commentators and video.

397
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:34,720
Rym: All these people being murdered by samurai.

398
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,531
Rym: There's a big samurai uprising all over Japan.

399
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:38,636
Rym: Will the emperor fall?

400
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,420
Rym: All this nonsense.

401
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,080
Rym: And it was on the news for him constantly.

402
00:24:43,808 --> 00:24:44,539
Scott: What year was this?

403
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,724
Rym: Like, recently.

404
00:24:45,744 --> 00:24:46,872
Rym: Early 2000s.

405
00:24:49,182 --> 00:24:51,374
Scott: If you saw that on the news, I think it was a fake news.

406
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:52,360
Scott: I wouldn't think it was real news.

407
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:53,905
Rym: Well, it was all in the background.

408
00:24:53,945 --> 00:24:58,200
Rym: It'd be like normal news, normal news, and then there'd be this one thing just planted in the news.

409
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:01,740
Scott: Yeah, there's no way a smart person believes that.

410
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,500
Rym: So, we didn't think about it too much, I assume.

411
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:10,780
Rym: But then the event was, they ostensibly had flown him out to Japan to try to beat a race walking world record in an empty stadium.

412
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:12,520
Scott: Was this guy a race walking record holder?

413
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:15,039
Rym: He is a professional race walker of some kind.

414
00:25:16,963 --> 00:25:18,660
Rym: And they had him doing his race walking.

415
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,680
Rym: And then they had a bunch of people dressed up as samurai bust in and they had a bunch of blood squibs and everything.

416
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,940
Rym: So, as he's running by, there's this kind of commotion.

417
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,440
Rym: And he sees this guy dressed up as samurai yelling at some cops and things.

418
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,100
Rym: And then the samurai murder these dudes and he's still race walking.

419
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:37,032
Rym: And then the samurai go, "Oh,

420
00:25:37,314 --> 00:25:37,456
Rym: oh!".

421
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:37,960
Rym: and they point.

422
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:40,019
Rym: And then they start running after him.

423
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:47,840
Rym: And the whole point of this is a bunch of people watching this on monitors betting on whether or not he will run or walk away.

424
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:51,798
Rym: Will he race walk away or will he give up and run?

425
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,140
Scott: It pretty much comes down to if he believes it's fake, he's just going to keep doing his race walk.

426
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,160
Rym: But then they come after him.

427
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,380
Scott: If he doesn't believe it's fake, he's just going to run because he doesn't care about the race walk anymore.

428
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,719
Rym: So, when they come after him, he starts to race walk a little bit.

429
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,059
Rym: And then, spoilers, he runs.

430
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,059
Scott: I mean, technically he was running the whole time.

431
00:26:08,244 --> 00:26:08,594
Rym: Well, yeah.

432
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:13,355
Rym: So, yeah.

433
00:26:13,517 --> 00:26:13,800
Rym: Theben.

434
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,659
Scott: Yeah, so here's a game.

435
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,700
Scott: And I did a little bit of research on this game.

436
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,234
Scott: So, it was printed a long time ago.

437
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:19,760
Scott: What year?

438
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,760
Scott: That's a long time ago.

439
00:26:22,322 --> 00:26:24,837
Rym: The box art looks like it's an early 90s game, though.

440
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:26,039
Rym: I mean, look at that box.

441
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,560
Scott: Yeah, it looks like an even older game.

442
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,740
Scott: But the game was called Gensites von Theben.

443
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,260
Scott: Does gensites mean archaeologists or something like that?

444
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,671
Rym: Archaeological sites?

445
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:34,219
Rym: I don't know.

446
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,120
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

447
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,920
Scott: And archaeological von Peterprins.

448
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:37,490
Scott: Right.

449
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:38,020
Scott: So, anyway.

450
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:39,939
Rym: For two to four spieler.

451
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,636
Scott: So, the game was reprinted in a much better version.

452
00:26:43,677 --> 00:26:44,099
Scott: in what year?

453
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,703
Rym: Oh, sorry.

454
00:26:45,743 --> 00:26:46,951
Rym: For ages 10 and up.

455
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,360
Rym: I'm trying to read those old German rules.

456
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,160
Scott: Yeah, we don't care about that.

457
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,671
Rym: It was reprinted in 2007 as just Thebes.

458
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,920
Scott: So, I think it's hard to get and out of print, maybe.

459
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:56,536
Scott: But, maybe it's not hard to get.

460
00:26:56,576 --> 00:26:56,900
Scott: I don't know.

461
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:59,676
Scott: But, we had a friend had a copy.

462
00:26:59,716 --> 00:27:00,360
Scott: We played it a bunch.

463
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,440
Scott: It's a game I had seen around before at conventions and in game libraries.

464
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:05,060
Scott: And never had actually played.

465
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:06,429
Scott: So, we played it.

466
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,140
Scott: We played it like two or three times.

467
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,860
Rym: Well, Scott played it and then he comes over to me later because I was doing something else.

468
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,294
Rym: He's like, "Oh my god, we're going to play this digging

469
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:13,537
Rym: game.".

470
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,965
Rym: And he kept bringing it up.

471
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:17,940
Rym: And then, like the next day, I played the digging game and we dug.

472
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,280
Scott: So, the thing about this game is that it's just so thematically good, right?

473
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,706
Scott: The theme of the game is this.

474
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,220
Scott: You are an archaeologist, like Indiana Jones style.

475
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,260
Rym: Yeah, fake archaeologist.

476
00:27:27,742 --> 00:27:29,740
Scott: Except without the traps and the golden monkeys and shit.

477
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,275
Rym: The little dudes you move around have Indiana Jones.

478
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:33,180
Rym: They're just Indiana Jones.

479
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,461
Rym: Right.

480
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:39,460
Scott: So, you start in yerp and you're going around yerp researching things, right?

481
00:27:39,782 --> 00:27:40,960
Rym: And chasing down rumors.

482
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,775
Scott: Right, or you're hiring diggers or getting graduate students to follow you around.

483
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,900
Rym: Maybe you're buying a blimp to keep on hand or you buy a car, which apparently is super awesome.

484
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,440
Scott: Yeah, which we didn't think was awesome.

485
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:55,960
Rym: You didn't think was awesome.

486
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,540
Scott: Well, I was told it was not awesome.

487
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,159
Rym: Yeah, we'll talk about this later, but we started the game and Scott's like,

488
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:00,220
Rym: "Oh.".

489
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,079
Rym: I trusted someone.

490
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:02,990
Rym: The car comes up and Scott's like, "Oh, the car

491
00:28:03,111 --> 00:28:03,473
Rym: sucks.".

492
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:04,519
Rym: And I'm like, "Well...".

493
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:07,640
Scott: I was told the car sucked, but apparently that was not the case.

494
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,019
Rym: The car would probably be pretty great if I bought it in the beginning of the game and then a car appears.

495
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,760
Rym: And, of course, our friend buys it right away.

496
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,136
Scott: I was also told the shovel was awesome, so I got a bunch of shovels right away.

497
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:16,840
Scott: Not that awesome.

498
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,811
Rym: Yeah, the shovel was awesome, but you know what?

499
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:19,778
Rym: I only got two shovels.

500
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,980
Scott: I got three and it still wasn't awesome enough.

501
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,319
Scott: Anyway, so here's how the game works.

502
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:27,106
Scott: You spend time.

503
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:30,560
Scott: The game, depending on how many players you have, is two or three years long.

504
00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:35,920
Scott: And everything you do takes time, so you move along the edge of the board whenever you do anything.

505
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,840
Rym: Like where the victory point track is on regular German games.

506
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,700
Rym: Instead, that's just time, so I do a thing.

507
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,840
Scott: There's 52 weeks in the year, so you move.

508
00:28:44,421 --> 00:28:52,537
Scott: If you do something that takes six weeks, it's like moving from Moscow to London and then doing some research could take you one week per space.

509
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:55,272
Scott: you have to move, which could be three spaces or four spaces.

510
00:28:55,373 --> 00:28:56,520
Scott: Moscow to London is pretty far.

511
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:00,776
Scott: And then you spend time learning about Mesopotamia.

512
00:29:00,816 --> 00:29:01,780
Scott: That takes three more weeks.

513
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,360
Rym: So like a card would be on a place.

514
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,920
Scott: So you move your guy seven spaces because it took seven weeks.

515
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:14,020
Rym: So some cards, like if you do a bunch of research in Moscow, even after you move to Moscow, you'll spend like six weeks doing the research.

516
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:18,620
Rym: But if you just find some schmuck with a room around the street, it only takes like one more week.

517
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:21,820
Rym: And you go until you run out of time.

518
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:27,020
Scott: So whoever's turn it is is the person who has currently spent the least number of weeks.

519
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,560
Scott: So if you've spent the least amount of time, you spend a little bit of time.

520
00:29:30,761 --> 00:29:33,760
Scott: And if you pass someone, they now spend a little bit of time.

521
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,800
Scott: And everyone does a move whenever they're currently the person who's done the least stuff.

522
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,860
Rym: So whoever's furthest back always takes their turn.

523
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Scott: So sometimes you can do stuff twice in a row.

524
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:49,960
Scott: If you do a little bit and then a little bit and a little bit and everyone else has already done a whole ton of crap, then you can actually do a bunch of different things while everyone else is waiting for you.

525
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,720
Rym: Now that in and of itself is a novel mechanic.

526
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,885
Scott: It's so thematic.

527
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:56,400
Scott: It's like you're spending time going around doing stuff.

528
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,539
Scott: And everyone has the same amount of time to do stuff as everyone else.

529
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,120
Scott: Because you can't end the game by going over or under.

530
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,860
Scott: You end the game going exactly two or three years of stuff doing.

531
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,580
Rym: But also as a mechanic, it is very novel because it provides a lot of...

532
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,480
Scott: It solves the turn order problem.

533
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,360
Rym: It provides a lot of opportunities for a clever game designer using a mechanic like this.

534
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,197
Scott: It's something like, "Oh, you got to be the first player and I'm sitting to your

535
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:20,499
Scott: left.".

536
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,439
Scott: And none of that happens.

537
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,940
Rym: To design a very well-balanced or self-balancing game.

538
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,560
Rym: Because sure, the shovel's awesome.

539
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,420
Rym: Shovel takes a lot of time.

540
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,059
Rym: So you could do like a big crazy move on your turn.

541
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:33,940
Rym: But it might take a ton of weeks.

542
00:30:34,341 --> 00:30:37,480
Rym: And then everyone else takes like three or four turns before you get to go again.

543
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:37,942
Scott: Right.

544
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:41,447
Scott: Now the other thing you do is you can go down below out of... You can leave Europe.

545
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:42,980
Scott: You can go to... Well, Greece is still in Europe.

546
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,380
Scott: But you can go to Greece, Crete, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Palestine.

547
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:48,479
Scott: Is there somewhere else to go?

548
00:30:48,642 --> 00:30:49,000
Rym: I forget.

549
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:49,561
Scott: Right.

550
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:50,568
Scott: Rome is part of Europe.

551
00:30:50,608 --> 00:30:52,380
Scott: It's not part of the archaeology dig places.

552
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,280
Scott: And you just go there the same way you go around Europe.

553
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,539
Scott: But when you get there, there's only one thing to do.

554
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:57,840
Scott: And that is start digging.

555
00:30:58,623 --> 00:30:59,696
Rym: Now the digging mechanic is...

556
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,019
Scott: The best.

557
00:31:01,762 --> 00:31:04,620
Rym: Now it's the best, but at the same time it does make the game a little random.

558
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,719
Scott: It makes the game a lot random.

559
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,860
Rym: But it makes it thematically really fun.

560
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:08,982
Scott: Right.

561
00:31:09,022 --> 00:31:10,280
Scott: This game is all about theme.

562
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,620
Scott: It's not about being a strong competitive game.

563
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:15,399
Rym: I've already come up with some pretty strong strategies, though.

564
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,220
Scott: I mean, there's strong strategies, but in the end it's the mercy of the desert, right?

565
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:20,680
Scott: So let's say you go to Egypt.

566
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,287
Scott: And you've studied Egypt a lot.

567
00:31:22,307 --> 00:31:24,640
Scott: You've studied four Egypts, right?

568
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,820
Scott: There's this little awesome wheel you use and you spin the wheel.

569
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,115
Scott: And the wheel says, "Oh, you've studied four

570
00:31:30,276 --> 00:31:30,598
Scott: Egypts.".

571
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,160
Scott: Well, if you dig in Egypt for eight weeks, you get to dig this much dirt in Egypt.

572
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,380
Scott: And the more you know about Egypt or the more time you spend, the more you get to dig.

573
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:45,460
Rym: So the bag that you dig from for each site, each site has its own bag.

574
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,468
Scott: You literally dig.

575
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:47,660
Scott: There's an Egypt bag.

576
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:53,918
Scott: And you reach your hand in there and pull out a number of tiles equal to how many you're allowed to dig, right?

577
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:56,420
Scott: And you're digging through that bag.

578
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,640
Scott: And in the bag, it starts the game with half treasure and half dirt.

579
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,240
Scott: Any treasure you get is treasure you get.

580
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,619
Scott: And it's worth victory points.

581
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,016
Scott: Any dirt you get is dirt.

582
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:13,139
Scott: Now what makes the game amazing is that when you're done digging the Egypt bag, you take all the treasures and you keep them.

583
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,379
Scott: You know, you might want to uphold an exhibition or who knows what you're going to do with them.

584
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,414
Scott: But all the dirt goes back in.

585
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:20,520
Scott: You fill in the holes.

586
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,720
Scott: And the next person who comes and digs in Egypt, it fucking sucks, right?

587
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,339
Scott: Because there is way more dirt than treasure in there now.

588
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:32,320
Scott: So they need to dig even better than you, Doug, to have a chance of getting anything.

589
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:38,638
Rym: I once dug 12 tiles from a bag that had a reasonable amount of treasure in it and dug 12 dirt.

590
00:32:39,521 --> 00:32:45,120
Scott: I've also saw some people dig like six tiles out of a bag that was mostly dirt and get like five treasures.

591
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,960
Scott: So it's like there's so much drama when digging.

592
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:52,640
Scott: But it's just like the drama of doing real archaeology where you go to a site and you start digging.

593
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,808
Scott: It's like, are we going to find anything?

594
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,319
Scott: We don't fucking know.

595
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,198
Scott: And then if you do find something like, "Oh my God, it's a prize amphora completely

596
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:00,740
Scott: intact.".

597
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,539
Scott: Or, "Oh my God, it's a whole sarcophagus that's plated in gold leaf, only

598
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:04,720
Scott: shit.".

599
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:12,360
Rym: So even further to really drive the theme home, it's got all these other little elements, like it has a sheet that tells you what all the treasures are.

600
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,114
Scott: Yeah, they're all real treasures and they have names and stuff.

601
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:20,739
Rym: There's no bearing on the game, but yet we would read like, "Oh, you just found a blah and a blah and the ancient menorah of blah blah

602
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:20,980
Rym: blah.".

603
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:26,120
Scott: Now that's the thing about the game is that the theme of it is so good, but the mechanics are only okay.

604
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,820
Rym: Well, I would say the digging mechanic is what makes you say the mechanics are okay.

605
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:37,380
Rym: Because the rest of the game, I would like to make a more deterministic game that uses the same front half.

606
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,320
Rym: Everything but the digging.

607
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Scott: It's not just the digging that's random, it's also the cards that are random.

608
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,000
Rym: Well, it's a third in taxes randomness or a web of power randomness.

609
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,180
Scott: So let's say I go to London and I spend a turn researching Egypt, right?

610
00:33:51,741 --> 00:33:54,374
Scott: And then it goes around and I spent a lot of time doing that.

611
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:55,500
Scott: Everyone else does a bunch of stuff.

612
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,900
Scott: It's finally my turn again, right?

613
00:33:57,362 --> 00:33:59,048
Scott: Now there's four cards available.

614
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:02,200
Scott: The only thing you can do in Europe is do one of those four cards, pretty much.

615
00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:06,020
Scott: And I look at those four cards and they're all in Moscow.

616
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:09,733
Scott: And even though I might want to do one of them, I'm in London.

617
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:11,120
Scott: I just happen to be in London now.

618
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,340
Rym: So suck it up, spend some weeks and go over there.

619
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,998
Scott: So I end up having to spend a bunch of weeks.

620
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,320
Scott: Meanwhile, so now I spend a bunch of weeks to go to Moscow to do this card.

621
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,657
Scott: Then the card that gets flipped over next is, I don't know, Paris.

622
00:34:24,882 --> 00:34:32,976
Scott: Rims already in Paris and it's his turn now and that card only, you know, so he just picks up that card for a lot less weeks than it would have cost me.

623
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:42,340
Scott: because, and that ends up, it doesn't seem that big a deal, but if it keeps and it might, you know, over time, the whole course of the game, it should even out between the players.

624
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:48,540
Rym: It is also mitigated heavily by the fact that if you find a good card, it pushes you way up on the time track.

625
00:34:48,841 --> 00:34:54,120
Rym: So whoever fell behind will probably get to do a couple turns in a row and reveal more cards.

626
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:57,757
Scott: No, that's what I'm saying is if a good card spawns on you, right?

627
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,640
Scott: Not only do you get that card without having to spend a lot of time, but now it's your turn again.

628
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,940
Scott: You can get to do a lot more stuff in a lot less time if the cards turn up your way.

629
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,460
Rym: Well, that's the danger of taking cards and going ahead.

630
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:14,319
Rym: If you take good cards and go ahead, you basically give everyone else way more card opportunities.

631
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,740
Scott: But you might have no choice depending on what cards are available on your turn.

632
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,060
Scott: So it's not just the digging that's random, it's which cards are there on your turn.

633
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:25,019
Scott: that is also almost as random as the tiles, but not quite as random.

634
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,952
Rym: Moving will only take like one, two or three weeks.

635
00:35:27,053 --> 00:35:28,100
Rym: Good cards take six.

636
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,380
Rym: I think it's close to being very optimally balanced.

637
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,360
Scott: It's close, but it's not so perfect, right?

638
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:35,420
Rym: I was watching you make very poor decisions throughout that game.

639
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,380
Scott: No, I was doing fine.

640
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:45,660
Scott: I mean, so yes, there is decisions to be made that matter a lot, but it's like a half luck, half skill game.

641
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,720
Rym: I think the digging adds 80% of the luck to the game.

642
00:35:49,821 --> 00:35:51,100
Rym: The luck of the card getting.

643
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,780
Scott: I'm just saying the luck of the card getting is not nearly as big as the digging luck.

644
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,846
Rym: I would go beyond that.

645
00:35:55,907 --> 00:35:56,874
Rym: I would say that it's minor.

646
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:04,140
Scott: I'm saying it is not huge, it is not major, but it is large enough to be significant.

647
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,791
Rym: I wouldn't even say it's that significant.

648
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:07,120
Rym: I would say it's barely significant.

649
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,560
Scott: I'd say it is significant.

650
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,820
Rym: I think it's a bigger deal in Thurn in taxes and Web of Power.

651
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,193
Scott: It is a bigger deal in those, but it is still a deal.

652
00:36:15,554 --> 00:36:16,036
Scott: It's a deal.

653
00:36:16,317 --> 00:36:16,960
Scott: It's not a big deal?

654
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,473
Rym: Yes, technically you are correct.

655
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:19,060
Rym: It is a deal.

656
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,564
Scott: It's a deal, right?

657
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:27,320
Scott: So you could lose a game because bad tiles in your turn, but I also think we were playing four player games, right?

658
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,318
Scott: We've only had two years.

659
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:35,518
Scott: If you're playing with less players, which it gives you the third year, and also not only more time to do stuff with that third year, right?

660
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,240
Scott: But also more chances at the cards because less competition.

661
00:36:40,102 --> 00:36:43,620
Scott: Also, that it becomes much less, they won't be a deal in less players.

662
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:51,500
Rym: Interesting thing, we played, this was like the magfest of playing more old style classic German games.

663
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:58,120
Rym: What I've noticed is that five players or six players is what everyone is shooting for these days because people have bigger groups.

664
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:05,400
Rym: But, most of the best German games I can think of and most games that have stood the test of time are four player games.

665
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,420
Scott: We played this with four or five players.

666
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,589
Scott: No, we played it with four.

667
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:09,379
Rym: It only takes up to four.

668
00:37:11,844 --> 00:37:14,719
Rym: Most of the games we played at this magfest take four max.

669
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,726
Scott: I think this is best with two or three.

670
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:20,700
Scott: I think four stresses the resources of the game too much.

671
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,120
Scott: And it makes the digging much more punishing because now you've got the same amount of competition for the same amount of treasure.

672
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,434
Scott: They don't put in more treasures and more dirt in more player game.

673
00:37:30,474 --> 00:37:31,600
Scott: It's the same bag, right?

674
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,528
Rym: Because this game is a race, it is not highly political.

675
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:43,340
Rym: so it does not fall into the three player game trap where a three player game is actually a two player game plus a safety monkey.

676
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,560
Rym: So, yes, I agree this game is probably a lot better with three player.

677
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,603
Scott: Just because it will be more fun.

678
00:37:48,663 --> 00:37:53,560
Scott: More people will get a chance to go in the bag and get treasures even though the scores will be higher.

679
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,045
Scott: You'll get to do more stuff.

680
00:37:55,527 --> 00:37:57,957
Scott: It will just be more enjoyable with more players.

681
00:37:57,997 --> 00:37:58,379
Scott: Less players.

682
00:37:58,981 --> 00:38:04,600
Rym: It's kind of like how Bonanza is real fun with six and seven but it's also kind of broken.

683
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,280
Rym: Bonanza with five is ideal and perfect and one of my favorite games.

684
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,988
Scott: I think this game is ideal with three.

685
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:13,100
Scott: Even two I think this game can be really good.

686
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,953
Rym: Two would be real interesting.

687
00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:16,959
Scott: I haven't played it with two.

688
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,513
Scott: I think three is the ideal but I still think two is good.

689
00:38:19,593 --> 00:38:20,780
Scott: I would prefer two to the four.

690
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,180
Rym: Board Game Geek says best with three to four which is interesting.

691
00:38:24,962 --> 00:38:27,839
Scott: I wonder if there's any special rules for the two because we didn't actually play the two.

692
00:38:28,802 --> 00:38:30,940
Scott: But the three I think is the sweet spot.

693
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,170
Rym: Yeah, there's a big difference between three and four player.

694
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:35,060
Rym: I wouldn't say best with three to four.

695
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,200
Scott: Yeah, I think best with three and then four is kind of like it's playable but it's not as good as the three.

696
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,720
Rym: But if you're especially an aspiring game designer, you should play this game for nothing else than to see a game that so perfectly matches theme.

697
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,540
Scott: Yeah, the mechanic theme meshing here is so perfect.

698
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,440
Rym: Here's another example.

699
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,800
Scott: There are so few games that line it up so well.

700
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,207
Rym: There's a bunch of other parts.

701
00:38:55,227 --> 00:38:56,594
Rym: We didn't obviously tell you the whole rules.

702
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,700
Scott: Like when you play Puerto Rico and you choose Craftsman, do you really feel like you're crafting?

703
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,430
Scott: No, but when you choose to dig and spend six weeks digging in Egypt.

704
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,880
Scott: in this game, you feel like you're spending six weeks digging in Egypt.

705
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:13,000
Scott: And when you go around Europe researching, you feel like you're traveling around Europe researching.

706
00:39:13,882 --> 00:39:15,560
Rym: But there's also these exhibitions.

707
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:22,580
Rym: So you'll be digging in Egypt and suddenly you see, oh, there's an exposition going on in London right now.

708
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:36,599
Rym: And if you've got the stuff to be able to exhibit there to loan to their museum, you've got to get your ass back to London, be there before anyone else who also has the right goods, lend your stuff to the museum and you have to spend three weeks at the exposition.

709
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:38,457
Scott: The expo.

710
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:39,551
Scott: Yes, expo.

711
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:42,220
Rym: Because I'm doing expeditions.

712
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,034
Scott: I think it's actually just exhibit in a museum.

713
00:39:44,054 --> 00:39:44,799
Scott: It's not an expo.

714
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,620
Scott: But yeah, there's all kinds of side things that you can do that are kind of interesting and fun to get more victory points.

715
00:39:50,761 --> 00:39:52,319
Rym: And they're all so tight with the theme.

716
00:39:53,081 --> 00:40:02,740
Rym: But also the mechanic of you spend time going around a board is a very interesting self-tuning mechanic that you could use.

717
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:04,960
Rym: It's a lot of old German games had stuff like that.

718
00:40:05,661 --> 00:40:14,760
Rym: I recall I started playing a bunch of them again, where even if the game wasn't like super prescriptively designed for balance, they'll have these mechanics where anyone gets too far ahead.

719
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,959
Rym: It's not like a traditional rubber band that just sort of pulls you up.

720
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:23,292
Rym: But it's more like the more powerful strategies have an intrinsic game cost.

721
00:40:23,553 --> 00:40:28,040
Rym: that sort of causes them to balance out very nicely, even if you didn't think about it too closely.

722
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,920
Scott: I think what makes this game such a good thing, if you can find a copy, buy it.

723
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:41,660
Scott: Because on the one hand, it is a competitive game, though it's not super perfect, amazing competitive, like I say, a netrunner or something like that.

724
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:50,300
Scott: But it's competitive enough that someone who likes to play games to win can play this game and think a lot about strategies and make interesting decisions and have a good time.

725
00:40:51,101 --> 00:41:03,680
Scott: But also because the theme and the mechanic match so well and the fun are reaching in the bag, that person who usually was only willing to play Cards Against Humanity or maybe Camel Up, Camel Cup, something like that.

726
00:41:04,204 --> 00:41:05,419
Rym: It's canonically Camel Up.

727
00:41:06,122 --> 00:41:18,339
Scott: Someone who's usually only playing the easier, more luck-based, not skilled, not hardcore games like Camel Up, you can get them to play this game because it's so fun to go in the bag and do the things.

728
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:26,000
Scott: And then you can use this to get both of those people to play the game together and have a good time without that conflict that usually happens.

729
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:28,660
Scott: There's not a lot of games in that sweet spot.

730
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,980
Rym: You'll see a neat design pattern.

731
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:39,860
Rym: There's a lot of games where you can take some number of things, and if you're clever, you can make a combo of the exact values of them.

732
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,243
Rym: Like Power Grid is an example.

733
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:49,539
Rym: Power Grid is a game where you can spend exactly all of your money if you're very clever a lot of the time, and it's a huge advantage if you did so.

734
00:41:49,800 --> 00:42:04,875
Rym: If you set the stage for that play to happen later, this game does that in the sense that if you fall way behind in time, you might be able to look at the board and come up with a combo where you get to take two or three turns, and then you land directly on top of someone.

735
00:42:04,996 --> 00:42:05,620
Rym: Exactly.

736
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,940
Rym: If you land on top of someone on the time thing, top is last place, so you get to take yet another turn.

737
00:42:13,402 --> 00:42:15,229
Rym: I feel like a heuristic to know who's doing.

738
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:24,300
Rym: well is who landed on top of another player the most, because that is the person who's doing the Power Grid thing of spending exactly all of their money more than once in the game.

739
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,044
Scott: Right, so think about it.

740
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:28,480
Scott: You're sitting there looking at the board, and you see a card you really want, right?

741
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:35,048
Scott: And there's three cards you don't really want so much, so you go and you're in Europe, you're not ready to dig anything yet, so you just go and get the card you really want.

742
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:37,720
Scott: You move two spaces and take it for five turns.

743
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,260
Scott: Now it's not your turn anymore, but you didn't pay attention.

744
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:46,599
Scott: One of those cards you didn't want was on the spot you spawned and only cost one week to pick up.

745
00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:47,502
Rym: Even though

746
00:42:47,643 --> 00:43:01,460
Scott: it wasn't a great card that you really wanted, you could have gotten that card basically for free, but because you weren't paying attention, you didn't get it, and you just let it sit there, and it's like you could have had two cards, instead you only got one card because you weren't being careful.

747
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:16,440
Rym: So that is sort of almost a common design pattern, irrespective of the mechanic that causes it, of does the game have a mechanism to reward the player for being exact about something that's difficult to predict or difficult to calculate?

748
00:43:17,064 --> 00:43:19,179
Rym: Power Grid does it, and this game does it.

749
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:27,490
Rym: And I wanted to add a new thing to the way we review board games, because on one of the panels I was on, that Scott was not on at MagFest, super smart guy.

750
00:43:27,811 --> 00:43:30,300
Rym: Luke Peterschmidt at Fundo11 said something really interesting.

751
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:44,489
Rym: Most tabletop games, like commercial ones, not necessarily the weirdo German ones we play, but in general, they pretty much assume that the game's got three to five plays tops, and that people really won't play it.

752
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:46,420
Rym: much beyond that, except maybe bringing it out.

753
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:52,080
Rym: Games that get past that three plays barrier are real close to being classics for all time.

754
00:43:53,180 --> 00:44:07,160
Rym: If you're talking about games above a certain level of complexity, but below a certain other arbitrary, there's a lot more, I'm taking this quote kind of out of context, I think this game has four to five more plays by me before I'm done with it.

755
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:23,080
Scott: I think the number of plays this game has is entirely dependent on how many friends you have, because you might get tired of digging in that bag, and it might lose its excitement a bit, but if you bring some new people in, it can refresh in the excitement, because reaching in that bag is just so awesome.

756
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:30,140
Rym: So thus, the way I would put that is, this game has three to five plays from a purely intellectual, "I'm a gamer playing this game" perspective.

757
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,220
Scott: And any new person is going to want to play it at least two to three times.

758
00:44:33,461 --> 00:44:35,246
Rym: But it has unlimited play.

759
00:44:35,286 --> 00:44:41,919
Rym: for me, as Scott was alluding to, in that if I'm with some people who have never played this game, and I own this game, I'll just bust it out.

760
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:46,719
Scott: You're not going to bust it out with two people who've played it before and one who hasn't?

761
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:47,040
Scott: Nope.

762
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:52,899
Scott: But one who has played it before and two or three who haven't, yes, you're going to bust it out, because they're going to have so much fun going in the bag.

763
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:53,600
Rym: Definitely.

764
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,813
Scott: And digging into Egypt and finding nothing.

765
00:44:56,055 --> 00:44:56,760
Scott: Dirt, dirt, dirt.

766
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,595
Scott: And everyone's chanting when you go in the bag, all the other players are like, "Dirt!

767
00:45:00,937 --> 00:45:01,198
Scott: Dirt!

768
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:01,700
Scott: Dirt!".

769
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,328
Rym: And at one point, Scott took the bag.

770
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,760
Rym: I was about to dig into and put a curse on it.

771
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,059
Rym: And sure enough, I drew like nine fucking dirt.

772
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:09,204
Scott: Curses!

773
00:45:09,566 --> 00:45:11,416
Scott: King Tut, he got you!

774
00:45:11,677 --> 00:45:12,080
Scott: King Tut!

775
00:45:13,301 --> 00:45:26,160
Rym: So we're going to try to do that in all of our reviews from now on, of really talk about how many plays this game has got in it, because I feel like that's one thing, that's a metric that we could have used a lot more, we could have used that very effectively in our older game reviews.

776
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:34,772
Rym: I'm trying to go back and think about some of those games, because then, a couple of years down the road, we can go back and say, "Hey, how many times did we play that game?

777
00:45:35,134 --> 00:45:39,980
Rym: Was it really five players, or was there some high-end strategy we didn't think about?

778
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:41,147
Rym: Did we play it

779
00:45:41,187 --> 00:45:41,490
Rym: more?".

780
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,953
Rym: Because T&E right now is one of the... T&E and Puerto Rico still have Infinity.

781
00:45:45,973 --> 00:45:46,780
Rym: I'll play those right now.

782
00:45:49,343 --> 00:45:52,580
Scott: But there's also games that could have a lot of plays and we just don't for whatever reason.

783
00:45:54,202 --> 00:45:56,313
Scott: We could play Lost Cities just whenever.

784
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:57,418
Scott: We just don't.

785
00:45:58,342 --> 00:46:01,079
Rym: If we go to Anime Boston, we're going to be playing a lot of Lost Cities, I think.

786
00:46:01,627 --> 00:46:02,018
Scott: Good idea.

787
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,120
Rym: Yeah, and that Mushroom game, and we're going to bring all the two-player games.

788
00:46:05,503 --> 00:46:05,718
Scott: Netrunner.

789
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:06,350
Rym: Yeah.

790
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:18,560
Rym: And kind of a total aside, but we played some Blast from the past that we'll talk about later, so I have this old... I don't even know if we ever reviewed it on GeekNights, because I think I bought it before GeekNights.

791
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:19,136
Scott: I think we did.

792
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:20,919
Rym: But Lachita.

793
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,800
Scott: It was a Beacon game.

794
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:26,872
Rym: And Scott read the rules again, and I read them again, and then... That game's got some stuff going on.

795
00:46:26,892 --> 00:46:27,859
Rym: I think it needs a second look.

796
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:28,522
Scott: Yeah.

797
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:29,960
Scott: I think it did an episode on it.

798
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:43,220
Rym: Scott did not play, but there are two games that are kind of famous in our circle, because they're both games that we played a reasonable number of times back in college, but Scott and I are mutually, independently undefeated at both of them.

799
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:48,520
Rym: I am undefeated at Pizarro, and Scott is undefeated at Web of Power, despite many plays.

800
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:50,853
Rym: Someone brought Web of Power.

801
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:51,720
Rym: I don't know how it got him.

802
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,940
Scott: I've never seen a copy of Pizarro since college.

803
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:54,423
Scott: I know.

804
00:46:54,826 --> 00:46:56,720
Rym: So I played a game of Web of Power.

805
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,720
Rym: I won by so much, it wasn't even... It was laughable.

806
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:08,960
Rym: They were babies fumbling in the dark in terms of their strategy, despite having played it a bunch relatively recently.

807
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,800
Scott: All I remember from that... I don't remember how to play.

808
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:17,317
Scott: I just remember, "Just connect all your guys in a big, long network, and then at the end of the game, put the cylinders out in the best

809
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:17,660
Scott: spots.".

810
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,320
Rym: So Scott, I hadn't played the game in a long time.

811
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:19,927
Scott: What did you do?

812
00:47:19,947 --> 00:47:20,940
Scott: Did you do what I just said?

813
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:25,230
Rym: I looked at the board, and I had my usual gut feeling of, "Here's how I'm going to win this

814
00:47:25,271 --> 00:47:25,534
Rym: game.".

815
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,800
Rym: But then I stepped back, and I thought long and hard about what you did when you were undefeated.

816
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:32,819
Scott: How do you remember from back then?

817
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:34,260
Rym: I remember things, apparently.

818
00:47:35,502 --> 00:47:38,219
Scott: All I remember is, "Make a big network of houses, and then put the cylinders

819
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,299
Scott: out.".

820
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:45,120
Rym: So I focused on the network of houses to the exclusion of the things that my heuristics were screaming at me to do.

821
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,740
Scott: That's also what I did when I played it.

822
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:49,420
Scott: I made the biggest network of houses I possibly could.

823
00:47:49,902 --> 00:47:53,500
Rym: I won real hard, real early.

824
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:58,920
Scott: I want to know what happens in the game when multiple people are all trying to make the biggest network of houses they possibly can.

825
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,519
Rym: So the question is, if we get a hold of this game again, will you play it with me?

826
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,099
Rym: Because you are legit undefeated at this game, and you played it more than once.

827
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,660
Scott: The game I forget how to play, other than I remember making a network of houses.

828
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,610
Rym: Yeah, that's most of the game.

829
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:15,140
Rym: It's actually a very simple and really quick game.

830
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,138
Rym: If I ever see it for cheap, I'm going to get it, because I kind of liked it.

831
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:20,820
Rym: Alright, we're done.

832
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,640
Scott: This game is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

833
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,760
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

834
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:55,110
Rym: The Patrons this week, in order of the amount of money they annoy Scott with, are Nicholas Brandau, Rebecca Dunn, John R. Knobs II, Amanda Duchette, James David White, Christian Koops, Jess, Mechanical Mind, William Eisenroos, you expected the next name to be yours, but it was me, Dio, Clinton Walton, MyStady.com, Phil Ulrich, Ren from New Zealand, Robert Lee, Ryan Perrin, Drew Openlander, Rare Lavelle, Brian Cedroni, Rochelle Montanona, Finn Eric Silverhot, Can't Melt Steel Beams, Kinetic Man, Aaron Cerise, Chris Nox, Flame Darkfire, I've Thought Carefully and I'm Still Going to Pay, Daniel Redman, Chris Hadad, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

835
00:49:55,851 --> 00:50:00,330
Rym: At least someone has figured out that one of my favorite jokes in the world is the Can't Melt Steel Beams thing.

836
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:03,630
Rym: So you know, you all know where it comes from.

837
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:13,603
Rym: It's that completely fake and stupid, loose change, whatever, 9/11 was a conspiracy thing, but I first encountered it as a joke long ago when someone made this image.

838
00:50:13,664 --> 00:50:17,302
Rym: that was just like, what my eight-year-old cousin thinks.

839
00:50:17,342 --> 00:50:31,669
Rym: all the Pokemon are called, and it shows Pikachu, and it's like Yellow Cat, and it's just like, it's kind of funny, and it's going on, and they increasingly make less and less and less sense as you go through this image, and then eventually it's just like Jet Fuel, Can't Melt Steel, for whatever reason.

840
00:50:32,394 --> 00:50:41,370
Rym: I found this way funnier than I probably should have, and I've just found that one particular joke really, really, really funny every time I encounter it forever.

841
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:51,869
Rym: So, I don't know, maybe my brain's broken, but I just find it really funny, and in fact, that joke is the whole reason I made that Ozymandias Twitter account that a lot of you are following now.

842
00:50:52,531 --> 00:50:59,050
Rym: But anyway, I should keep this brief, because as you all know, I'm actually in London right now, and the episode's basically recorded well in advance.

843
00:50:59,492 --> 00:51:17,370
Rym: We will resume the normal GeekNights stuff starting next week, and I think it's either 3 or 3.30 p.m As I said, we do have with that panel Atari Game Design at PAX East, and while we're probably going to have video of the PAX South version of it up before PAX East even happens, we do it differently every time.

844
00:51:17,531 --> 00:51:22,050
Rym: This is a panel we can actually get a lot of mileage out of, because we can just keep doing different Atari games.

845
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:30,450
Rym: So, we're basically going to do Outlaw for the first 20-ish minutes of this panel every time we run it, at least until we've milked that cow for all it's worth.

846
00:51:30,951 --> 00:51:33,230
Rym: But all the other games, we're going to jump around.

847
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,821
Rym: We might not talk about combat.

848
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:35,910
Rym: We might talk about other games.

849
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:44,190
Rym: I've been experimenting with maybe some paddle games, maybe some games on the Intellivision to kind of really push it over the line.

850
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:52,590
Rym: So, yeah, it'll probably be worth your while to see the panel, even though Scott doesn't seem to think the panel's that good, despite the fact that people lined up literally hours to see it.

851
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,989
Rym: They completely filled the not-small panel room at PAX.

852
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:01,330
Rym: Also, Scott does not listen to these things at the end, so I can pretty much do whatever I want here.

853
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:14,970
Rym: And now, thus, I leave you with... It's kind of an oldie and a classic, but I'm pretty sure you're going to laugh when you remember what this is, and if you've never heard it before, well, my hat is off to you guys at Dorkly for making this possible.

854
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:17,010
Scott: Don't deny your fursona, brother.

855
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:20,349
Scott: There is a sexy raccoon living inside you.

856
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:21,726
Rym: Let him out.

857
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,789
Rym: I don't have a fursona, my God.

858
00:52:25,931 --> 00:52:31,429
Scott: I was once like you, trying to quell the sexy wolf-fox howling in my soul.

859
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:34,729
Rym: Let him out so you can feel whole.

860
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:36,430
Rym: Listen to Goomba.

861
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,849
Rym: That name has no meaning to me.

862
00:52:38,331 --> 00:52:40,070
Scott: I am Snowtail, Arctic Foxwolf.

863
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:43,650
Rym: I'm sorry, Snowtail, but I'm not a furry.

864
00:52:43,991 --> 00:52:45,109
Rym: I'm not down to yiff.

865
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,030
Rym: I wear a tanuki suit so I cannot fly and I cannot turn to stone.

866
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,386
Scott: So, you wear it to get hard?

867
00:52:51,095 --> 00:52:51,930
Scott: Yes, exactly.

868
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,529
Rym: Wait, no, not like that.

869
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:56,629
Rym: Greetings, Snowtail.

870
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:00,566
Scott: It is I, a pond-hopper, a sexy frog-man, and a...

871
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:01,456
Rym: Luigi?

872
00:53:02,351 --> 00:53:02,867
Scott: Oh, my God.

873
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,709
Rym: Mario, I can explain.

874
00:53:07,034 --> 00:53:08,210
Rym: Please don't tell Mama.
