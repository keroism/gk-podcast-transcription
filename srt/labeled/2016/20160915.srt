1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,961
Rym: It's Thursday September 15th 2016.

2
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:13,167
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:16,180
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:27,618
Rym: I can't believe we never did a show about pizza and all these years of complaining about not having Thursday show ideas pizza really Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:37,580
Rym: So I had the ancient ancient Laser printer that Scott and I shared at the geek house and over time it sort of stopped working like it still printed.

6
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:38,879
Scott: I think it worked.

7
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,244
Rym: Okay, it didn't.

8
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:50,071
Rym: it wouldn't load paper unless you sort of like shook it and like push the paper in and half the time It would load multiple sheets and then fuck itself up.

9
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:51,919
Rym: paper got jammed in it all the time.

10
00:00:52,662 --> 00:00:59,028
Rym: The toner was still mostly present like it would print like it was running low on toner But the problems were all the rest of the mechanical bits.

11
00:00:59,489 --> 00:00:59,690
Scott: Mm-hmm.

12
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:03,564
Rym: So we family needed a printer for something Something else.

13
00:01:03,624 --> 00:01:05,492
Scott: Rym breaks to make an excuse to buy something.

14
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:07,620
Rym: Yeah, I would rather have not bought a printer.

15
00:01:07,882 --> 00:01:08,727
Rym: I use printers.

16
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:19,029
Rym: Like the only thing I print anymore is The thing I have to mail with my rent every month because they made an online system But they charge 50 or so bucks to use it.

17
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:27,140
Rym: So I have to print my thing every month Which I do at work, but what if I didn't go to work or something or you know change?

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,140
Scott: Like what if I just didn't have a friend print character sheets for RPGs, but I could use my iPad maybe and I print?

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:45,279
Rym: There were a couple times where I needed to print Sheets not for me to use an RPG But for everyone else to use because it was an RPG that I had some sort of higher level interest in.

20
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:49,336
Rym: But in those cases that printer was too unreliable.

21
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,300
Rym: So I just go and print it at work.

22
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,054
Scott: Anyway, yeah, but I mean that's kind of like the only thing that it's like.

23
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:59,204
Rym: oh and if I use mega bus I got a print the ticket because they won't let you use your phone Why not?

24
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:04,348
Rym: they just won't they specifically on the website like fuck you You cannot show us your phone like they were.

25
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:11,580
Rym: the last time I checked they were very explicit about that Which was always weird, but I hate about not taking their bus.

26
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,400
Rym: So yeah, the thing is mega bus is the only non Amtrak way to get to Hartford.

27
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:18,327
Scott: Just cars cars go there.

28
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,431
Rym: Yeah, you want to rent a car.

29
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:20,456
Rym: I'm not renting a car.

30
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:21,300
Rym: I'm done renting cars.

31
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:22,246
Scott: I got other methods.

32
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:24,358
Rym: Yeah, you have parental methods.

33
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,212
Scott: You can come and get in the same car that I get in.

34
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:29,639
Rym: Yeah, but you left way later than us.

35
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:30,944
Scott: So, what's your hurry?

36
00:02:31,828 --> 00:02:32,792
Rym: I'd like to get there earlier.

37
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:33,314
Rym: Mm-hmm.

38
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:34,920
Rym: I do a lot more work on the staff.

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,478
Rym: We'll see if I keep staffing but at least for now, I do a lot of work on the staff.

40
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:39,748
Scott: Nothing had.

41
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,939
Scott: Thursday doesn't really exist.

42
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:45,837
Rym: Yeah, most lives like I like to get like I'm older now and it's weird.

43
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:46,620
Rym: I've gone back and forth.

44
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,080
Rym: There was a time when I go to a convention.

45
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:59,859
Rym: I would want to maximize my time at that convention like in those early Otakon days Like we'd get up at the crack of dawn on Thursday and our goal was to be in Baltimore by noon Because that just means more time hanging out like yeah.

46
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,300
Rym: But then I got older and I actually had stuff to do outside the conventions.

47
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:07,190
Rym: So I started like I remember a couple anime bosses.

48
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:16,319
Rym: we'd roll in Friday morning and leave like Sunday early afternoon Which became problematic because may a bolt bus would often get stuck in traffic on Friday morning.

49
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:18,740
Rym: So, I don't know.

50
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:28,080
Rym: I feel like I either want like I either want to get in early enough to have dinner and go to bed as opposed to Show up late and be kind of hungry, but it's Hartford or Baltimore or whatever and there's nowhere to eat.

51
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:29,767
Rym: I'd rather actually eat a real dinner.

52
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:34,045
Rym: So I tend to show up at cons at like 5 p.m The day before the con.

53
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:34,426
Rym: that's like.

54
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:35,531
Rym: that's my go-in.

55
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:39,223
Rym: That's my modus operandi now mmm.

56
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,519
Rym: So you got any news on this Thursday GeekNights' the lounge?

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:53,179
Rym: I do have always gonna say is I bought a new printer and it's just like professional color laser printer and We didn't know what any printer papers that would sitting up there and I haven't actually set it up yet.

58
00:03:53,863 --> 00:04:00,959
Scott: So well a while ago many months ago I finished watching like every Zatoichi movie and I finished watching a bunch of animes.

59
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,607
Rym: now I gotta I gotta watch those the tochis.

60
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:03,532
Rym: I've only seen a handful.

61
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,260
Scott: Is that tochi your mom, right?

62
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:10,456
Rym: I heard that he had a war with a Nobunga.

63
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:16,766
Scott: Yeah And then of all the animes that were on Hulu but weren't on crunchyroll I finished watching those.

64
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:19,238
Scott: so and I have crunchyroll still.

65
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:20,906
Scott: So there was ice.

66
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,260
Scott: basically you I didn't cancel the Hulu.

67
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,130
Scott: I basically said stop paying for the no commercial Hulu.

68
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,177
Rym: and then they stopped offering the free Hulu.

69
00:04:28,197 --> 00:04:35,460
Scott: No Yeah, it's not offering the free one But it's like I was paying for the no commercial super one because that I don't want to see commercial.

70
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,331
Rym: I was too and I remember I stopped paying for it.

71
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:42,200
Rym: one day when I logged in I was like, alright There's no shows in here that I can't watch elsewhere.

72
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:45,720
Scott: Well, it's like I already watched all this that you have, you know, and I'm good.

73
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:50,953
Rym: So then now if they had more archives I'm outta kept paying like if you could watch old Simpsons, but you can't.

74
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:55,277
Rym: so I just downloaded torrents of every Simpsons but first 20 seasons.

75
00:04:55,317 --> 00:05:01,680
Scott: today May be the day when I pay Hulu monies again because I remembered why I paid Hulu monies in the first place.

76
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:02,677
Scott: It's when do you watch TV?

77
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:07,072
Scott: Primarily for one show the park of South.

78
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:07,915
Rym: Oh shit.

79
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:09,140
Rym: I guess I gotta pay for Hulu again.

80
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:10,410
Scott: It has return ed.

81
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:16,815
Scott: there was a new episode Yesterday, so I could mind having cable television.

82
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:17,900
Scott: Yeah, sure we could.

83
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,412
Rym: I guess the problem is what I've run into recently is that you pirate Bay.

84
00:05:21,673 --> 00:05:30,734
Rym: unless you're pirating something like Right after the episode which I guess I would with South Park It's hard to get good quality rips of things later.

85
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:32,380
Scott: Like I haven't had that experience.

86
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:36,779
Rym: Try try getting like all the episodes of Adventure Time you've missed.

87
00:05:38,182 --> 00:05:39,708
Scott: I haven't had a problem ever getting an episode.

88
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:41,154
Rym: What was the last episode you watched?

89
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:42,399
Scott: I don't remember.

90
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,083
Rym: but thing that happened in Adventure Time Don't remember.

91
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:49,690
Rym: but how many arms does fan have?

92
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:54,319
Scott: That changes all the time, but there's a current number.

93
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:55,024
Scott: I don't know.

94
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:57,440
Rym: But anyway, how many did he have when you last watched?

95
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,143
Scott: I don't remember name another character other than Jake Uh Lovey's face princess.

96
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:03,525
Rym: Okay.

97
00:06:03,706 --> 00:06:12,693
Scott: Okay the when I downloaded that episode that I watched most recently I had I was actually like 10 or 20 episodes behind at that point Yep, and I downloaded all of them individually.

98
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:13,840
Scott: No problem from bit Torrance.

99
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:16,272
Rym: See I tried to do that a few weeks ago.

100
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,084
Scott: I think you're just really bad at bit Torrance Like you're really bad at googling.

101
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:21,734
Rym: No, so you can get him easily.

102
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:23,702
Rym: Just don't go to pirate Bay You gotta go to.

103
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:25,553
Scott: I always actually got them from pirate Bay.

104
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:25,935
Scott: No problem.

105
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:26,740
Scott: That's where I got them from.

106
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:31,037
Rym: Just try doing that recently because there are four specific adventure time episode.

107
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,868
Scott: when I get home I will go and stock up on the missed adventure times.

108
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:36,292
Scott: I'll remind here's the rules.

109
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:38,117
Rym: It's gotta actually be HD.

110
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:41,372
Scott: Of course It's a adventure time isn't actually 1080p at 720p first.

111
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:52,808
Rym: That's fine But yeah I always get HD every time cuz I thought a few of them the only one that had anyone actually seating were like these 480 whatever like bad rips the people.

112
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:55,397
Scott: I've never seen a non 720p Adventure Time.

113
00:06:55,718 --> 00:06:56,240
Rym: They're out there.

114
00:06:57,063 --> 00:07:03,028
Rym: They're out there Steven Universe, I just pay for but whatever We're at site lets you pay for that.

115
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,254
Rym: It's just on Amazon.

116
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,951
Scott: Oh You buy it direct buy a buy it as a show.

117
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,900
Rym: Yeah, I think it's worth it.

118
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,745
Rym: I mean that show is probably the best cartoon other than Bojack out right now and I like it a lot.

119
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:17,960
Rym: so I might as well pay money to the people who made it isn't it?

120
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:19,595
Scott: It's not on Hulu or Netflix.

121
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:24,535
Rym: Oh Hey, well, all those things are on those services, but they're always like so far behind.

122
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:25,620
Rym: that is literally pointless.

123
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:29,332
Scott: But far behind is good cuz I'm not that far behind.

124
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:31,259
Rym: you think like I'm behind on Adventure Time.

125
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,088
Rym: All right Well watching one of those services.

126
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:34,797
Rym: No, those services are so far behind.

127
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:35,299
Rym: It's a joke.

128
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:38,776
Scott: Well, I mean if you're starting at the beginning you can get caught way up.

129
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:43,459
Rym: Yeah But I'm not mmm, that's my problem.

130
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:50,353
Scott: Yeah, like you can just go on Hulu and watch all the South Park, yeah But you can't do that to the Simpsons from episode one.

131
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:56,420
Rym: Anyway, anyway So, uh, yeah South Park, I guess I mean that shows always been pretty solid.

132
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:58,050
Rym: I guess it will continue to be solid.

133
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:59,600
Scott: it will continue to be solid.

134
00:07:59,781 --> 00:07:59,841
Scott: So

135
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:08,047
Rym: in other news our our friend Luke crane and while this is a game It's also improv and it like it's not just like it's kind of beyond a game I could see people who have never played you

136
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:10,480
Scott: don't need an excuse to talk about this just cuz it's not Tuesday.

137
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,202
Rym: I don't know what I'm saying.

138
00:08:11,243 --> 00:08:16,220
Rym: people who don't play role-playing games and maybe don't even know really what a role-playing game is.

139
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:18,004
Scott: It's better if you know.

140
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:22,700
Scott: if you've heard the word larp before it's and you have an idea of what that is and haven't done.

141
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,137
Scott: I don't know because it's probably better that no one tells you that this is a larp even though it is cuz.

142
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:29,399
Scott: maybe you'll play It if no one calls it a larp.

143
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,400
Rym: I feel like there's a. there's an uncanny valley of larp.

144
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,438
Scott: Like if you don't tell a kid that a food is a vegetable he might get him to eat it.

145
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:46,559
Rym: But like someone who knows what larks are is gonna assume that it's just all weird vampire sex or 90% of it is or people hitting each other with foam swords.

146
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,160
Rym: 80% of it is this is this is an experience.

147
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:57,760
Rym: This is the 10% that is neither our good friend Luke crane who you may know from burning wheel and project donut and other such things.

148
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:15,180
Rym: Quite like seven years ago long goddamn time ago had this little like mod scenario of burning wheel that he called inheritance and get a bunch of people together and The prodigal son returns having been exiled for a decade for murdering his brother to claim his grandfather's inheritance.

149
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:17,509
Rym: And it's just this role-playing scenario.

150
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:30,079
Rym: We played it at an uber con like sitting around a table and he kept working on that thing year after year after year and Many years refining it and refining and refining it to the point to where it's its own standalone game.

151
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,007
Rym: now It's on Kickstarter.

152
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,520
Rym: It was released on Kickstarter this morning.

153
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,891
Scott: Why does it only have 17 days to go aren't?

154
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,759
Scott: kickstart is usually more than 18 days long.

155
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:42,932
Rym: Anyway, I guess you could pick a number of days like.

156
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:43,776
Rym: I'm actually not sure.

157
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,399
Rym: maybe it was on.

158
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:46,428
Rym: I mean, I can't imagine it was there before.

159
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:48,536
Scott: it just seems like arbitrary number of days 18 days.

160
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,011
Scott: Yeah, well a plus 17 more days.

161
00:09:52,485 --> 00:10:00,508
Rym: well, I mean I don't need to tell you to back it cuz he only wanted 10 grand and he's already got 25 grand as a 25 grand from a mere 236 people.

162
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:02,680
Scott: so that's an average of hundred dollars a person.

163
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:07,639
Rym: Well, it's a hundred dollars to get the good edition that has the cloth stuff.

164
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:09,872
Scott: Oh, so did everyone kick all.

165
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:11,320
Scott: two hundred thirty people got the cloth?

166
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,713
Rym: Well, pretty much everyone who could got the six hundred dollar wood edition and they're gone.

167
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:16,956
Scott: How many of those were there?

168
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:23,918
Scott: Uh 20 it looks like 20 people paid six hundred dollars for the wood edition.

169
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,780
Rym: Whoa So the cloth edition is a hundred bucks or a ninety?

170
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,879
Rym: Yeah hundred bucks ish and there's only 21 of them left.

171
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:32,515
Rym: No, and everything else is not.

172
00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:33,480
Rym: you want the cloth edition.

173
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,935
Rym: I think for like 70 you can get the paper edition, which is still the game.

174
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:42,260
Rym: Oh, that's fine But the game is a. it's kind of a one-shot like you can play it again.

175
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:44,140
Rym: I mean, I've played it a bunch of times through the year.

176
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,299
Rym: So I actually know all the at least many of the crazy spoilers I've seen this game change over the years.

177
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:53,713
Scott: Yeah, and I you know I can't imagine too much of the story and characters that the core have changed.

178
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:55,400
Rym: the core story is still there.

179
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,868
Rym: I can pick out from this image.

180
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,879
Rym: He's got who most of these people are.

181
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:01,189
Scott: That priest is so lame.

182
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:05,326
Scott: Yeah, I was imagined him being way cooler Christian.

183
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,359
Rym: why would he be cool?

184
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:15,492
Rym: And the one time the last time I played this when it was closest to his current form I fucking tracked that priest down and murdered him in the epilogue.

185
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:16,915
Scott: Where's where's runecasting?

186
00:11:16,935 --> 00:11:17,356
Scott: dwarf, man?

187
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:17,937
Scott: That's my guy.

188
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:21,568
Scott: I Always hiding in the back inside in the back.

189
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:22,752
Scott: That's my guy.

190
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:24,339
Rym: Yeah, that was your guy.

191
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:27,495
Scott: But I think that if I play it again, I think that would still be my guy.

192
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:29,464
Rym: but seriously Inheritance.

193
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:35,730
Rym: if you've never played one of those like Scandinavian or Nordic style LARPs It is not like what you expect from America.

194
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:46,500
Rym: Imagine a bunch of people just in a room arguing violently and Crying and getting weirdly emotional and playing this sort of very human drama.

195
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,483
Scott: Well, I mean, it's a. it's a you know a typical thing you see in a soap opera right, you know The old man dies.

196
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:56,700
Scott: There's a big inheritance - and all the family gets together and the lawyers there and you're all fighting, right?

197
00:11:57,982 --> 00:12:02,907
Rym: Usually in the so I guess in the soap opera the sonu murdered his brother ten years ago comes back to claiming Exactly.

198
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:04,300
Scott: It's just a typical plot.

199
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,880
Scott: There's nothing special about it Except for the fact we just change the setting to be all ye Norse Vikings and suddenly it's awesome.

200
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:15,680
Scott: And it's not some corny soap opera because everyone's got horns on their helmets and swords.

201
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:24,120
Rym: Also, it has very simple elegant mccain or hammers or magic And as a result, it's very freeform and open.

202
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,800
Rym: So what you find is that that even though they get like the snare is pretty much the same every time same characters.

203
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:33,615
Rym: It plays a specific not nine people and a facilitator like you can't play with less.

204
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:35,240
Rym: you got rid of all those options.

205
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,443
Rym: It's just an experience.

206
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:42,139
Rym: if you've played it enough, you'll know literally all the spoilers and yet it'll go a different way every time.

207
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:43,586
Scott: Maybe a different people.

208
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:46,700
Scott: It'll go a different way every time but in the same people at the same people.

209
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,930
Scott: You're gonna do something different cuz you learn something from the last time.

210
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:50,592
Rym: Yep.

211
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:59,320
Scott: The last time I played it I ended Like if you play a text adventure five times It'll be different five times because you're not just gonna sit there and make the same exact choice.

212
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,828
Rym: Like that pretty real scenario the sword.

213
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:01,009
Rym: like.

214
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:03,080
Rym: I've seen the sword end with all of them dying.

215
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:07,800
Rym: I've seen it end with like the human guy becoming king and everyone else dead.

216
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,111
Scott: I've seen the rat scurry away with the sword.

217
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:12,019
Rym: Yep, Pete ran that one.

218
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:13,908
Rym: What con were we at?

219
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:16,099
Rym: Was that Zenkon Con or Magfest?

220
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:19,240
Rym: Where he ran the sword for these kids?

221
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,416
Rym: They got really into it and he just kept rolling with it and it ended up being like the rat.

222
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:28,752
Rym: people like fighting for their Kingdom like way off distant from where it began.

223
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:30,500
Scott: You gotta stop the sword before it gets to that point.

224
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:32,899
Rym: He just kept going and it just kept rolling.

225
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:34,858
Rym: Just roll that wheel.

226
00:13:35,763 --> 00:13:37,740
Rym: Yeah, inheritance is crazy amazing.

227
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,300
Rym: I would say that the last time I played it was literally the peak role-playing experience of my life to date.

228
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:47,879
Scott: The problem with this is that you know, like Rym got the cloth edition, so I don't need it.

229
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,114
Scott: Yeah, usually like burning will codex comes out like everybody kicking that right.

230
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:53,720
Scott: cuz I'm gonna say everyone needs a book.

231
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:55,820
Scott: Not everyone needs one of these which is fine.

232
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,199
Scott: You just need one per group.

233
00:13:57,661 --> 00:14:04,960
Scott: Make sure you know someone who who backed this on Kickstarter and if the only person you know is you that guess who's buying.

234
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:17,715
Rym: Yeah But seriously I'm getting this and I plan to run it for people at conventions because it takes a few hours Like it's not like it takes longer to play Eclipse than to play this for serious heavy-duty RPG.

235
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:19,500
Scott: Yeah, cuz you gotta learn a cliff.

236
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:23,830
Scott: Yeah Lips is coming out for PC tomorrow.

237
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,853
Scott: So we're gonna play.

238
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:29,869
Scott: so if you want to play eclipse with us You know go buy it on Scott's in charge of that.

239
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:34,126
Rym: cuz I facilitated the subterfuge which I kind of want to play again But buy it on Steam tomorrow.

240
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:36,737
Rym: Yep, and got the Civ 5 also.

241
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:39,247
Rym: patreon backers There's two of you haven't joined.

242
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:42,200
Rym: the patreon backers said five game.

243
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,983
Scott: That's how people do?

244
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:47,020
Rym: they pay for shit and they don't join it like real soon or I'm replacing you with alternates.

245
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,759
Scott: You know how many people buy like humble bundles and don't play the games like me?

246
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,742
Rym: Oh, I can see exactly how many people look at the content in the patreon Like.

247
00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:58,020
Rym: I get a lot of data and all I want to say is that data is fascinating.

248
00:14:58,141 --> 00:15:00,499
Scott: Are people spending money and they're not even checking it out?

249
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:01,803
Scott: Uh, they're just.

250
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:06,880
Scott: they just forgot about it and they're giving us money every month without even looking actually listening to any podcast or anything.

251
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:13,045
Rym: A lot of people started subscribing to gig nights in patreon like regular gig nights because it has this whole RSS feature now Mm-hmm.

252
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:17,860
Rym: So they're using that instead of our feed and They I actually talked to some people about it.

253
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:26,780
Rym: the main reason seems to be that They actually subscribe to a lot of things on patreon and they basically patreon is now the feed of all the things they like.

254
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:30,450
Scott: Uh-huh, so they don't just use an RSS reader like feedly or something.

255
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:40,119
Rym: Well if they do they RSS the patreon Mm-hmm because it's like an aggregator of their stuff Interesting and it's not like they can just go like it.

256
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,420
Rym: They have to have the account because a lot of it is stuff that they paid for and patreon is getting real interesting.

257
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:50,940
Scott: It's interesting that without google reader, you could suddenly charge people money for each individual feed in google reader.

258
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:53,649
Scott: No, you want us to add this to your google reader.

259
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:54,812
Scott: one dollar a month.

260
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:55,475
Scott: Okay.

261
00:15:55,595 --> 00:15:57,140
Scott: It's like what you're just getting this for free.

262
00:15:57,866 --> 00:16:05,440
Scott: Well the people i've talked to There's a really interesting article by the guy who was in charge of google reader when it died and he's basically so sorry.

263
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:08,046
Scott: Yeah, he's like it's all my fault.

264
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:12,460
Scott: I sucked so I should have been concentrating more on getting more users, but I didn't care.

265
00:16:12,862 --> 00:16:18,180
Rym: Yeah, well i've done some informal sampling and it seems like most people who back to patreon They don't care about any extra rewards.

266
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,517
Rym: They just want to give us money because they appreciate what we've done.

267
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:25,475
Rym: stop But there's a small number of people who back it only to get the rewards.

268
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:27,160
Scott: smart, but the rewards are worthless.

269
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,840
Scott: Why are you backing?

270
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:36,890
Rym: and one person and only one person stopped backing us and they filled out the exit survey and the exit survey was basically Didn't get enough extra content.

271
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,695
Scott: smartest person.

272
00:16:38,218 --> 00:16:40,279
Rym: Yeah He was giving more money.

273
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,260
Rym: Well, he or she I don't know but that person was giving more money than I would have expected.

274
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,674
Rym: Also, some of you are giving a lot of money.

275
00:16:44,694 --> 00:16:47,567
Scott: Good god Good god, just give me the money.

276
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:50,920
Rym: Well, yeah, if you tell me something good you're gonna do with it.

277
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:52,307
Scott: I just built a computer.

278
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:54,800
Rym: Well, yeah, and what's that gonna facilitate in terms of content?

279
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,338
Scott: All the things I have to watch then review on this show.

280
00:16:57,781 --> 00:16:59,690
Rym: But it doesn't cost you money to watch those things.

281
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:01,940
Scott: It cost me a whole computer to watch those things.

282
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,887
Rym: You can watch those things on your old htpc.

283
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:07,675
Rym: you just can't play pac-man on your old htpc.

284
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:18,140
Rym: not a full frames anyway But anyway things of the day.

285
00:17:18,722 --> 00:17:24,380
Rym: This was in my feed and it was way more terrifying than I thought it was going to be when I read it.

286
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,991
Rym: So I got two things today that are related.

287
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:27,279
Rym: They both involve ants.

288
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:35,200
Rym: So this is a uh, the headline is bizarre ant colony discovered in an abandoned polish nuclear weapons bunker.

289
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:38,893
Scott: So wait, I didn't know that the poland ever had nuclear weapons.

290
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:43,320
Rym: that's news to me, uh Why don't you know about the cold war?

291
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,727
Scott: Oh, are you saying those are russian nuclear weapons that were in poland?

292
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:51,200
Rym: Uh, poland did not control nuclear weapons directly.

293
00:17:51,381 --> 00:17:55,455
Rym: No, as far as I know, okay, but uh, I was I was.

294
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:57,604
Scott: I guess I was not aware that russia Put it that way.

295
00:17:57,624 --> 00:18:03,480
Scott: Yeah Anyway, so basically they develop video games these days.

296
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,555
Rym: I'll summarize this but you got to read this article.

297
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:11,539
Rym: This is Fascinating, but basically there's this one kind of wood ant that is pretty like a termite.

298
00:18:12,262 --> 00:18:13,026
Scott: It eats it eats wood.

299
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:14,974
Rym: But yeah, I think so or it lives in the world.

300
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:21,720
Rym: I don't know a lot about ants But you don't say but these oh soviets built the bunker during the cold war to store nuclear weapons, blah blah blah blah.

301
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:24,672
Rym: Okay, basically this giant and code to store them.

302
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:26,400
Scott: It wasn't a launching place, but it was hidden.

303
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,808
Rym: It was a storing like it was camouflaged and hidden.

304
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:30,433
Rym: Okay, so it's abandoned.

305
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:32,360
Scott: Poland is a good place to hide nuclear weapons.

306
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,464
Scott: No one's gonna look for them there.

307
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:34,487
Rym: It's abandoned.

308
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:35,872
Rym: and ants?

309
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,919
Rym: these ants just formed a colony on top of it.

310
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:45,240
Rym: But then one day apparently the center of their colony was right over this metal pipe ventilation pipe that had a metal cap on it.

311
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:48,872
Rym: And the cap eventually corroded and this hole opened.

312
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:57,519
Rym: a bunch of the ants fell into the bunker And there is this horrific minds of moria ant death colony down there.

313
00:18:57,579 --> 00:19:03,567
Scott: now wait, wouldn't the ants that fell down there just be Dead because it's dark and there's no food.

314
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:05,773
Rym: So that's what's fascinating.

315
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:08,480
Rym: basically ants that fall in can't get out.

316
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:11,099
Rym: No shit, but lots of ants fall in.

317
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:15,714
Rym: So the ants that fall in keep falling in because there's a giant hole.

318
00:19:15,814 --> 00:19:17,420
Rym: ants aren't that bright individually.

319
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,224
Rym: There's a lot of reasons.

320
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:21,040
Rym: you gotta read the article to explain to answering most of your questions.

321
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:23,440
Rym: I would just read the whole article to you and it's long.

322
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,659
Rym: But basically these ants fall down there and they can't get out.

323
00:19:28,222 --> 00:19:31,535
Rym: But they're still alive and there seems to be something they can eat.

324
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:32,639
Rym: it's not just cannibalism.

325
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:38,239
Rym: So they continue to live their lives And try to make their colony work.

326
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:47,839
Rym: But instead of the colony being refreshed by new ants being born down there It's refreshed by otherwise happy ants falling into this hell pit and being trapped there.

327
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:50,485
Rym: Uh, what do they call it?

328
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:54,780
Rym: Uh trapped for years in a hostile environment of cold and total darkness.

329
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:56,127
Scott: Then how I mean?

330
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:58,540
Scott: the ants can't even make anything down there because this is just concrete.

331
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:02,072
Rym: Uh, there's dirt and grime and there's bats in there too.

332
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:03,919
Rym: Oh, so there's some bat guano.

333
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:10,254
Rym: uh scientists pulled one cubic decimeter of material out of the bottom and found eight thousand corpses.

334
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:14,709
Rym: they estimate there are Millions of dead ants in the ant cemeteries.

335
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:18,566
Rym: the ants down there when the when the ant catacomb Yeah, the anticum.

336
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:21,301
Rym: so when the other ants die, you know ants have cemeteries Like.

337
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,119
Rym: they carry the ants away and they put them all in a place.

338
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:27,260
Rym: There are millions of ants in the cemeteries down there.

339
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:38,379
Rym: So basically when you fall into this hell pit you live your life maintaining the colony and then when you die One of the fresh ants puts you in the cemetery and then does what you used to do.

340
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,967
Rym: And this is just terrifying and fascinating.

341
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:47,100
Rym: but much more directly terrifying is apparently there are people who keep fire ants in their houses as pets.

342
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:48,668
Scott: Wait a minute.

343
00:20:49,172 --> 00:20:50,000
Scott: How do you even do that?

344
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,300
Scott: As soon as you go near a fire ant is it gonna bite you and you're gonna be in excruciating pain for a long time?

345
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,000
Rym: Yeah, so this dude keeps these fire ants in an ant colony.

346
00:20:57,907 --> 00:20:58,459
Scott: How did he get them?

347
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:03,015
Scott: Uh, just ordered them online or something You can buy them or did you just take them from the street?

348
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:03,598
Rym: I don't know.

349
00:21:04,082 --> 00:21:04,826
Rym: All I know is this guy.

350
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,135
Rym: apparently there's a lot of people who do this.

351
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,980
Rym: This is Ants Canada.

352
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,983
Rym: So he has fire ants.

353
00:21:08,404 --> 00:21:20,059
Rym: but this video is him explaining how he figured out that the fire ants Were trying to escape because they run out of space to live And if they escaped they would have escaped into his house.

354
00:21:20,682 --> 00:21:22,428
Scott: Yeah, why did you put them in your house?

355
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:25,900
Scott: So this video is just like every time i've gone to florida.

356
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:36,020
Scott: no one goes on the grass ever because fire ants And pretty much everyone's like oh shit watch out fire ants and they're constantly exterminating the fire ants.

357
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:37,389
Rym: This video is great because you like see those.

358
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,140
Scott: why would you bring them into your house on purpose?

359
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,266
Rym: See those three ants right there?

360
00:21:40,286 --> 00:21:42,380
Rym: Yeah, all the other ants are moving around doing shit.

361
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,240
Rym: But those three ants are just sitting there at the edge of the territory.

362
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:52,740
Rym: Ants and ant colonies do that when they're planning an escape when they're planning a way to go across a dangerous obstacle.

363
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:56,579
Rym: So when you see that happening watch the fuck out because your fire ants are about to get loose.

364
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:00,410
Rym: So, uh, yeah ants that's that's what I found.

365
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,093
Scott: Here's a good idea.

366
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:05,392
Scott: if you got some fire ants as pets Kill them all and don't get any more.

367
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:07,100
Rym: No, he keeps expanding the colony.

368
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:08,507
Scott: What the fuck?

369
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:10,339
Rym: He's got a lot of fire ants.

370
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:12,955
Scott: I hope that they break out and infest his whole house and bite him.

371
00:22:12,975 --> 00:22:15,107
Rym: when I was a little kid I read a horror story about that.

372
00:22:15,148 --> 00:22:17,320
Rym: a kid had an ant colony and he tortured the ants also.

373
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:17,743
Scott: It's like.

374
00:22:17,763 --> 00:22:19,799
Rym: and then the ants got out and they bit him to death.

375
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,539
Scott: You know, there's a law that's like you can't have ferrets.

376
00:22:23,781 --> 00:22:25,513
Scott: Yeah, would you get rid of that law and make a law?

377
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:26,359
Scott: You can't have fire ants.

378
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:34,066
Rym: Oh if someone has fire ants in new york in their apartment and I find out Burn the building down Don't shed it too.

379
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,314
Rym: I'm not afraid of him.

380
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:40,033
Rym: I just don't want to get bit Like spiders whatever but colony of fire ants biting me.

381
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:41,660
Rym: that is that is objectively unpleasant.

382
00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:43,368
Scott: So you gotta think at least.

383
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:44,940
Scott: if like a snake poisons you like you'll die.

384
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,906
Scott: I don't know how painful it is.

385
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:47,656
Scott: But fire is biting you all over.

386
00:22:47,676 --> 00:22:57,787
Scott: Yeah anyway, so Tomorrow I have tickets to go see the world's Greatest lower mid-tier prog metal band.

387
00:22:58,288 --> 00:22:58,810
Scott: All right.

388
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,652
Scott: I forgot about that.

389
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,560
Scott: the devin towns and projects not sold out because metal doesn't sell out.

390
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:08,520
Scott: um And they have been doing on the devin towns in youtube channel.

391
00:23:09,842 --> 00:23:11,468
Scott: Uh, you know some tour videos like.

392
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:33,058
Scott: there's like there's a guy traveling with them making videos every day every single day they're making videos and these remind me of Like a lot of the video legendary like behind the scenes Band touring videos used to see back in the day like pantera videos and stuff like that Only, you know, almost perhaps more funny, but obviously less hardcore and less insane.

393
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:48,854
Scott: uh So you should go The devin town sends youtube channel and watch all the videos that he's posted since the start of this tour because there's a documentary Of you know the making of the new album You know sort of mixed in with the daily videos of what's going on in the tour.

394
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:59,760
Scott: and it's like all this shit happens Like you see them going to like places you might recognize Or like, you know, the bus breaks down and they're at some hotel that the outside of denny's for a whole day.

395
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:08,719
Scott: Hey Like he hurt his foot and like, you know, one of the fans of wives is a podiatrist and he brought her over.

396
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:10,202
Scott: it's like.

397
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:17,530
Scott: it's just all this, you know, really awesome kind of stuff that you know, if uh, We went somewhere for longer than one weekend.

398
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,480
Scott: We could do something a video series like this.

399
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:24,500
Scott: Also, it would help if someone followed us around and did all the video work while we slept and just did our thing.

400
00:24:24,825 --> 00:24:27,867
Rym: See if I get enough money I'll hire cameraman.

401
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:28,732
Scott: We'll hire this guy.

402
00:24:28,772 --> 00:24:30,079
Scott: He's do really fucking good job.

403
00:24:31,321 --> 00:24:40,232
Scott: Yeah, if you were doing on a tour or want someone to follow you around to the camera producing videos of your shit The guy who makes these is like way good.

404
00:24:40,252 --> 00:24:51,339
Scott: and i'm sure as soon as this tour is over He probably I mean, I don't know him, but I guess I might see him tomorrow and say hi Yeah, I imagine he would very much like to do that more often for money.

405
00:24:52,602 --> 00:24:56,979
Rym: Uh, so there you go, so in the meta moment, uh, the book club book is rebecca.

406
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:05,540
Rym: I'm gonna read it before I watch the movie which i've never seen or I might have seen as a kid But I can't remember and I might have conflated it with a much worse movie.

407
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,013
Rym: So we'll see when I when I actually watch it or read it if suddenly my brain's like

408
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:13,416
Scott: i've seen the movie twice and not Recently,

409
00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:30,763
Rym: yeah All i'm gonna say is if you ever if there was a movie that traumatized you as a kid and all you remember Is this creepy girl singing the worms crawling the worms crawl out that is a movie called Uh, imagine or picture mommy dead and it is not rebecca Uh, otherwise

410
00:25:30,783 --> 00:25:39,666
Scott: the movie from my childhood that I remembered scenes from but could not actually remember the name of at least attaching it Was uh time lords.

411
00:25:39,686 --> 00:25:44,080
Scott: Ah, I knew what time was was and I remember had memories of this movie.

412
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,515
Scott: I just didn't realize that that movie was time right.

413
00:25:46,858 --> 00:25:54,813
Rym: as a kid I think I also actually conflated a lot of sean connery movies together because I saw a lot of them when I was too young to really process Because my like my dad would watch him.

414
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:58,577
Scott: So like It was james bond that said I am the last one.

415
00:25:58,597 --> 00:26:04,027
Rym: Yep Um, we got no conventions till magfest.

416
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:06,234
Scott: guys it was the dragon that said.

417
00:26:06,254 --> 00:26:09,580
Scott: yeah, they said when he goes to the hospital You send two of those to the moon.

418
00:26:11,044 --> 00:26:14,500
Rym: When you're the last one It's the chicago way.

419
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:16,466
Rym: Oh my god, I should just make a.

420
00:26:16,848 --> 00:26:18,575
Scott: it's the dragon way I should.

421
00:26:18,615 --> 00:26:24,000
Rym: may I should just take Line sean connery set and string them together into one long rant and make the dragon say them.

422
00:26:24,442 --> 00:26:27,997
Scott: Make the dragon say all of them except for the ones the dragon says at the very end of the video.

423
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:33,692
Rym: make james bond say So, uh, yeah, we got no conventions coming up.

424
00:26:33,752 --> 00:26:36,000
Rym: I got nothing really big to plug except the usual stuff.

425
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:42,860
Rym: So now that we're back Like I said follow scott's youtube channel follow my youtube channel because we're making shit as fast as we can.

426
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:56,916
Scott: I'm gonna make a whole bunch of videos about making an htbc Even though the number one thing if you search on the internet if you want content related to computer building There is a never-ending supply, but i'm gonna add to that never-ending supply because I can.

427
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:57,940
Scott: that's fine.

428
00:26:58,421 --> 00:27:07,078
Scott: Actually, I gotta start doing my also because all the people giving you creating all those that content about computer building Are crazy overclock nerds and i'm gonna tell you how stupid they are.

429
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:11,037
Rym: I can't believe we never did a show on this.

430
00:27:12,343 --> 00:27:13,065
Scott: Maybe we did.

431
00:27:13,106 --> 00:27:14,610
Scott: we've talked about it very often.

432
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:19,692
Rym: I searched about it in the last episode we did So i'm not gonna elaborate too much.

433
00:27:19,712 --> 00:27:21,000
Rym: I guess I will a little bit on the saddle thing.

434
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,519
Rym: We'll talk about why that pizza was bad.

435
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:26,960
Scott: I think this is a thing we've talked about but I searched and there was no episode named pizza.

436
00:27:27,404 --> 00:27:28,859
Rym: Yeah, the word pizza did not appear.

437
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:35,136
Scott: People love food episodes and pizza is such a big deal that we can talk about it beyond just food.

438
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:40,959
Rym: Like it's such a pop culture Phenomenon mama me a pizza pie, right, but I want to make it very clear.

439
00:27:41,642 --> 00:27:42,264
Rym: Unlike scott.

440
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:47,500
Rym: I do not have this ridiculous obsession with new york pizza being special because I didn't grow up in new york.

441
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,465
Scott: It's not special.

442
00:27:48,545 --> 00:27:49,590
Scott: It's just that it's different.

443
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,640
Rym: It's a style of pizza, but I don't even care about the style.

444
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,405
Rym: It's not even my favorite style of pizza.

445
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:54,689
Scott: It's my favorite style of pizza.

446
00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:00,505
Scott: All i'm saying is also the most delicious style of pizza and um most other style.

447
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:07,388
Rym: the thing is my favorite style of pizza is actually the thin crust from A fancy italian restaurant.

448
00:28:07,408 --> 00:28:08,914
Scott: That's a fine style of pizza.

449
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:11,604
Scott: Yeah, i'm not saying that it's the only good stuff I'm saying that's my favorite.

450
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:17,625
Scott: I'm saying that most other styles of pizza of all the styles Uh are garbage shot.

451
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:19,471
Rym: It's the chicago way.

452
00:28:19,551 --> 00:28:21,156
Scott: No, the chicago way is a bad way.

453
00:28:21,176 --> 00:28:22,420
Rym: I like chicago pizza a lot.

454
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:25,915
Scott: No, it's also not pizza, but that's that's a semantic argument.

455
00:28:26,015 --> 00:28:26,337
Rym: It's pizza.

456
00:28:26,357 --> 00:28:29,020
Rym: if I go to wikipedia I'm, pretty sure i'm gonna be able to say that that's pizza.

457
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,411
Scott: It's deep dish pizza.

458
00:28:30,552 --> 00:28:31,540
Scott: It has an adjective attached.

459
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:52,480
Rym: All i'm saying the only preference I got to make is that I don't think new york pizza Is that high on a pedestal, but I do think having eaten pizza all over the goddamn world uh The the average shitty pizza in new york Is better than the average delivery pizza in the entire rest of the united states.

460
00:28:53,220 --> 00:29:02,480
Rym: Like a shit slice of pizza from a shit bodega here Tastes better independent of style than pretty much anything you can get delivered in most places.

461
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,688
Scott: It's because of the style.

462
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:05,300
Scott: you could make pizza like that in a shit.

463
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:06,549
Scott: I don't think it's the style.

464
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,000
Scott: I don't think it's the water.

465
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:11,029
Rym: I think it's the cheap ass mozzarella.

466
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,480
Scott: You don't think they have cheap ass mozzarella in other places.

467
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:15,540
Scott: I think they use an expensive mozzarella.

468
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,540
Rym: I think they're either using more expensive mozzarella or they're cutting it with ricotta or something?

469
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:25,707
Scott: No, I don't think that's what it is at all because in my experience if you go to other places and get the delivery pizza This big puffy thing.

470
00:29:25,787 --> 00:29:28,220
Scott: It's not you know, it's a different style of pizza.

471
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,069
Scott: The dough you can see right away is different.

472
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:32,119
Scott: the amount of sauce the variety of sauce.

473
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,388
Rym: So take the pizza.

474
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:34,537
Scott: the whole thing is different.

475
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:35,201
Rym: take the pizza We had.

476
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:36,892
Scott: the cheese is like not a thing.

477
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:38,040
Scott: that's like resting on top.

478
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,960
Scott: It's like sort of like integrated into the bread almost like it's a garlic bread the pizza we got in seattle.

479
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,767
Rym: My problem with it was not its style.

480
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:48,120
Rym: The problem was that the mozzarella it wasn't new york style.

481
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:49,145
Rym: No, it wasn't new york style.

482
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:53,846
Rym: Okay, but had it been made in its style Well, it would have been a fine pizza.

483
00:29:53,867 --> 00:29:57,520
Rym: the problem was the mozzarella was overcooked to a significant degree.

484
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,103
Scott: That is true.

485
00:29:58,284 --> 00:30:00,799
Rym: If your pizza is mostly brown on top you fucked up.

486
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,769
Rym: That is true and that's across the board.

487
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:04,900
Scott: burnt cheese suddenly gets a bad flavor.

488
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:12,060
Rym: Yeah, and that mozzarella was that like ultra greasy runny ass shit, but not you know, new york style pizza is greasy.

489
00:30:12,241 --> 00:30:26,980
Scott: I actually thought that it was actually like so dry that that mozzarella because it was so burnt and All the grease all the grease had run off the pizza was not dry but the mozzarella they used to make the pizza I expect was greasy and also shitty way.

490
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,587
Rym: but that grease was gone in the actual pizza because they did congealed by the time it got.

491
00:30:31,768 --> 00:30:38,640
Scott: the other problem is that the Like the crust underneath the cheese and almost non-existent sauce was all this puffy kind of stuff.

492
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,546
Scott: Well, because it was full of the congealed grease, uh, and it was very chewy and it was not you know A nice crispy crust.

493
00:30:44,586 --> 00:30:48,509
Rym: Yeah, and while I do also enjoy a chewy pizza This was not the good chewy.

494
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:50,180
Rym: This was the congealed grease chewy.

495
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:57,700
Rym: Anyway, but so remember, uh, I was infamous at rit because I worked at the bar downstairs for a while.

496
00:30:58,302 --> 00:31:05,004
Rym: I was in charge of the pizza station and uh, I made pretty much the worst pizza you can imagine And I want.

497
00:31:05,044 --> 00:31:12,615
Rym: I remember I tried to make it better and the only way to make it better Was to steal The more expensive mozzarella and use that.

498
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:13,339
Scott: where'd you steal it?

499
00:31:13,662 --> 00:31:14,899
Scott: Where was it to be stolen from?

500
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,740
Rym: I just went to the other restaurant on campus and because we could like in emergencies like oh we need supplies.

501
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,174
Scott: Like the different restaurants had different qualities of cheese.

502
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:23,180
Scott: Yeah, okay.

503
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:29,760
Rym: So if I got better mozzarella, the pizzas were okay, even if I fucked up but the default cheapest mozzarella.

504
00:31:29,881 --> 00:31:37,821
Rym: Well when the pizza cooked it'd get like super nasty greasy And then that grease would immediately like run out or congeal and the pizza was the worst Right.

505
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:40,411
Scott: the thing about you know, when you make a pizza, right?

506
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,800
Scott: You're taking a big piece of bread or dough, right?

507
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,523
Scott: Not bread It's dough.

508
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:45,306
Scott: it becomes bread.

509
00:31:45,326 --> 00:31:47,353
Scott: Uh, it's really flat bread.

510
00:31:47,996 --> 00:31:50,440
Scott: You roll it out get it flat You put the sauce on there.

511
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,660
Scott: You don't want to put too much sauce because then suddenly if you put too much sauce the cheese will slide right the fuck off.

512
00:31:55,881 --> 00:32:02,127
Rym: Yep, unless you're making a different style of pizza, but you want to put sauce in there because that is you know I like a soupy sauce.

513
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:03,415
Scott: Otherwise, it's not pizza.

514
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:04,180
Scott: It's cheesy bread.

515
00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:08,900
Rym: Like my main complaint about new york pizza if I have one is that often it doesn't have enough sauce, right?

516
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,400
Scott: Well, you know, you gotta have enough sauce that you can taste the sauce.

517
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,991
Scott: Yeah, you don't actually want the sauce to create like a layer.

518
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:15,979
Scott: You need that cheese to like stick on there, right?

519
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:25,758
Scott: Uh, and then you put on the cheese and the cheese melts the sauce heats up and the dough bakes all at the same time In the oven all together and creates a perfect thing.

520
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:30,247
Scott: now As that cheese heats up Grease comes out.

521
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:31,413
Scott: That's how cheese works.

522
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:32,600
Scott: It's a dairy thing, right?

523
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,505
Scott: I don't think there's very few cheeses.

524
00:32:34,565 --> 00:32:38,920
Scott: I can imagine making them hot where no grease would emerge from them.

525
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:41,815
Rym: And the thing is probably some horrible cheeses where that happens.

526
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,800
Scott: super hard dry cheese But not a not a cheese you're gonna put on a pizza.

527
00:32:45,482 --> 00:32:50,440
Scott: And the thing is you want that grease to come out because that grease is delicious, right?

528
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,091
Scott: And creates the nice texture on the pizza, right?

529
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,260
Scott: You know makes nice and shiny, right?

530
00:32:56,501 --> 00:33:02,439
Scott: It gives us something for maybe some oregano or some pepper flakes to like dissolve into right if you shake it on there, right?

531
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:12,580
Scott: But if too much grease comes out you might get into trouble with the cheese sliding right off when you pick up the slice Which is solved by waiting for it to cool But then it congeals.

532
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:19,839
Scott: Yes You could also get into a situation where you pick up the slice and the cheese is still on there But it's still too greasy and the grease drips all over the fuck.

533
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:25,482
Scott: And when you fold and make that little crack in the crust you get a grease drip coming out the back of the slice All over you.

534
00:33:25,743 --> 00:33:27,168
Scott: so that's also too much grease.

535
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:30,640
Rym: take the new york slice and take it to its extreme like make it bad.

536
00:33:31,284 --> 00:33:40,511
Rym: And you know when I grew up as a kid like I was in michigan Unless you went to a sit-down place the only pizza style you could you could get uh dominoes You could get not pizza pizza hut not pizza.

537
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:41,896
Rym: It's it's pizza.

538
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:42,900
Rym: It's just bad pizza.

539
00:33:43,582 --> 00:33:46,434
Rym: Pizza hut was pretty much the best delivery you could get later.

540
00:33:46,454 --> 00:33:53,215
Rym: You get papa john's And you could get little caesars, oh god, I actually like a little.

541
00:33:53,255 --> 00:33:55,000
Scott: when's the last time you had a little caesar?

542
00:33:56,073 --> 00:34:00,543
Rym: uh When I was in arizona Two times ago.

543
00:34:00,563 --> 00:34:05,739
Rym: Wow, because they opened little caesars opened up some chains in arizona because there's so many midwest transplants.

544
00:34:06,782 --> 00:34:11,658
Rym: imagine a new york pizza, but 50 times greasier.

545
00:34:13,686 --> 00:34:14,920
Rym: That is little caesars pizza.

546
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:24,000
Scott: So the thing is even though I grew up mostly in connecticut obviously visiting new york and having a pizza from new york many times New york pizza was available in connecticut, right?

547
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,706
Scott: It's not like it's.

548
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:28,045
Scott: you can only get it in new york You can get it in many many places.

549
00:34:28,387 --> 00:34:34,792
Scott: like i've ever had good pizza in florida in a place where new yorkers lived Or even like all the places i've lived or gone.

550
00:34:34,812 --> 00:34:38,130
Rym: like you can often get a pretty good pizza Even if it's not even a new york style.

551
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,579
Rym: like you can get at least a good pizza.

552
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:53,418
Scott: But anyway, uh, so I just want to you know not talk about the food pizza right but people I don't think realize Pizza as we know it in america is somewhat new.

553
00:34:54,762 --> 00:35:02,563
Scott: If you watch like old tv old movies read old books pizza wasn't a thing in like The 60s.

554
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:08,840
Scott: like you you don't see like things from the 60s people ordering pizzas getting them delivered eating them, you know, right?

555
00:35:09,462 --> 00:35:11,632
Rym: Uh, you're doing a lot of uh in some pop culture.

556
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,540
Scott: It's not like it didn't exist at all.

557
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:14,509
Rym: I think you know what it is.

558
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:17,564
Rym: delivery pizza Is pizza.

559
00:35:17,664 --> 00:35:19,189
Rym: as far as most americans are concerned.

560
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,055
Rym: delivery pizza is pizza, right?

561
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:22,460
Scott: It's not like pizza didn't exist.

562
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:24,608
Scott: It just wasn't enormous, right?

563
00:35:24,649 --> 00:35:27,340
Scott: It wasn't super huge and popular everywhere, right?

564
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,372
Rym: Actually in canada pizza was really popular in the 50s and 60s.

565
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:41,308
Scott: I'm sure it was but in the united states It wasn't this tremendous deal until you know, at least as far as I remember like 70s and then really 80s 90s and we were young.

566
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:45,320
Scott: that's when you had like, you know, suddenly pizza was everywhere, right?

567
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,379
Scott: It was this big, you know, ninja turtles were eating pizza.

568
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:49,826
Scott: Right, like pizza was a big deal as well.

569
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:53,840
Rym: It was when pizza became like a popular reference in pop culture, right?

570
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,241
Scott: Right.

571
00:35:54,261 --> 00:35:56,014
Scott: It's like suddenly pizza was everywhere.

572
00:35:56,094 --> 00:36:00,149
Scott: There were you know, Restaurants like pizza hut dominoes got way bigger.

573
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:00,932
Scott: Only pizzeria.

574
00:36:01,052 --> 00:36:03,480
Rym: Uno is a big part of america's pizza history.

575
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,526
Scott: Yeah, no pizzeria.

576
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:04,908
Scott: Uno.

577
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:08,342
Scott: I remember the first one like 1943.

578
00:36:08,342 --> 00:36:10,632
Scott: I don't know if it was the first one ever obviously it wasn't.

579
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:12,584
Rym: but yeah 1943.

580
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:13,680
Rym: You did not go to the first one ever.

581
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:15,950
Scott: No But one opened in connecticut and it was like this.

582
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:19,152
Scott: it seemed to us like this brand new thing We had never heard of before.

583
00:36:19,172 --> 00:36:19,980
Scott: and actually, you know what?

584
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,262
Scott: I hate pizzeria.

585
00:36:21,383 --> 00:36:23,129
Scott: Uno every time i've eaten at one.

586
00:36:23,169 --> 00:36:26,000
Scott: It's like this style of pizza that's different from every other place.

587
00:36:26,302 --> 00:36:27,410
Scott: Well, and I don't like that.

588
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,196
Rym: I don't like that style.

589
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:29,562
Rym: Now pizzeria.

590
00:36:29,703 --> 00:36:36,840
Rym: Uno is tgi friday's effectively quality wise but I do really like deep days in chicago style pizza a lot.

591
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,084
Rym: It's one of my favorite kinds of pizza.

592
00:36:38,124 --> 00:36:38,927
Scott: It's like top five.

593
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:40,613
Scott: I'm not saying it's a disgusting food.

594
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:43,664
Scott: I'm just saying it's not pizza It's pizza.

595
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:44,105
Scott: Also.

596
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:44,848
Scott: I don't really want it.

597
00:36:45,068 --> 00:36:47,817
Rym: In fact, uh, wikipedia specifically calls it pizza.

598
00:36:47,898 --> 00:36:48,098
Scott: Uh-huh.

599
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,274
Rym: Whatever Uh, there are actually there are academic citations on this.

600
00:36:52,737 --> 00:36:54,124
Scott: Uh-huh Whatever.

601
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:54,828
Scott: So you disagree?

602
00:36:55,231 --> 00:36:56,136
Rym: Yeah, you do.

603
00:36:56,357 --> 00:36:56,578
Rym: What's it?

604
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,076
Rym: I could make a reference to you disagreeing but you haven't watched frickin morty.

605
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:05,903
Scott: All right So we don't need to tell How much.

606
00:37:05,943 --> 00:37:10,740
Scott: how often are we going to go back to the topic of whether or not this thing that is so unlike?

607
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:15,775
Scott: Uh pizza How far away can you get from pizza while still being pizza, right?

608
00:37:15,815 --> 00:37:16,740
Scott: Is it calzona pizza?

609
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,387
Scott: It's just a piece of folded over.

610
00:37:18,688 --> 00:37:20,114
Scott: It's got sauce and cheese on the inside.

611
00:37:20,134 --> 00:37:26,099
Rym: No, it's not just this fold over It's also cooked folded Yeah, so so that's like still bread sauce and cheese.

612
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:32,220
Rym: So is a hoagie different from a sandwich different from a sub different from a grinder is a pizza bagel not a pizza.

613
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,282
Scott: What if?

614
00:37:33,302 --> 00:37:35,936
Scott: what if I put sauce and cheese on an english muffin and put it in my toaster?

615
00:37:35,977 --> 00:37:36,560
Scott: Is that a pizza?

616
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:37,622
Rym: All right.

617
00:37:37,642 --> 00:37:39,300
Rym: Let's see what the definition word pizza blah blah blah blah.

618
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,500
Scott: What if I take a a cheese stick a mozzarella cheese stick dip it in sauce and then put it on a bread?

619
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,088
Scott: Roll the bread up like a hot.

620
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:46,773
Rym: I put it on a hot.

621
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:47,640
Rym: I see you're going with this.

622
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:53,785
Scott: All i'm saying is when I put a mozzarella stick on a hot dog button pour sauce onto it and then eat it Is that a pizza?

623
00:37:53,885 --> 00:38:02,784
Rym: your position that chicago style is not pizza is outside of weird new york and connecticut bullshit circles Not recognized by anyone.

624
00:38:02,804 --> 00:38:08,300
Scott: i'm saying there's a point at which you diverge so much from the formula of a very flat piece of bread.

625
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:08,943
Rym: I would agree with that.

626
00:38:08,983 --> 00:38:16,656
Scott: and you know what the and you are no longer the same thing Even though whatever word you want to use right you want to use the word pizza for all these things fine.

627
00:38:16,696 --> 00:38:17,078
Scott: Whatever.

628
00:38:17,138 --> 00:38:17,720
Scott: It's semantics.

629
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:22,720
Scott: I'm saying It is different enough that it is in a different category.

630
00:38:23,061 --> 00:38:26,472
Rym: Chicago style pizza is so similar to all other forms of pizza.

631
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,735
Rym: They could make babies with it.

632
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:29,180
Rym: It's the same species.

633
00:38:29,585 --> 00:38:30,638
Scott: No, I don't think you could.

634
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:31,963
Rym: All right, what?

635
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,730
Rym: what makes a chicago style pizza fundamentally different?

636
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,415
Scott: It's so deep right?

637
00:38:36,435 --> 00:38:38,079
Rym: It's almost Sicilian Sicilians.

638
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:40,184
Scott: deep Sicilian is just square.

639
00:38:40,204 --> 00:38:43,174
Rym: Uh, it's also thick real deep like an inch thick.

640
00:38:43,274 --> 00:38:43,957
Scott: not in new york.

641
00:38:43,977 --> 00:38:45,703
Scott: I just had a new york Yesterday.

642
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:46,266
Scott: it was not deep.

643
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:48,375
Rym: I had Sicilian from little italy's downtown.

644
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:49,520
Rym: You know what it's an inch thick.

645
00:38:50,184 --> 00:38:51,533
Scott: Uh, the one I had wasn't an inch thick.

646
00:38:51,573 --> 00:38:53,906
Rym: Well, you went to a shitty place That actually knows a really good place.

647
00:38:53,926 --> 00:38:57,260
Scott: Most Sicilian pizza in new york is real thick.

648
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,872
Rym: Its squareness is not its identifying characteristic.

649
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:01,459
Scott: Anyway, let's talk about some other.

650
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,992
Rym: anyway Let's ignore the fact that i'm wrong and just continue.

651
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:09,420
Rym: All right more important uh Why do people eat such shitty pizza?

652
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:11,007
Scott: Because they don't have good pizza.

653
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:18,440
Rym: and then it has to be it because I tweeted like, you know We were in seattle like this pizza's garbage down here and a lot of people were trying to tell me that it was not garbage.

654
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,239
Scott: Well, here's the thing, right?

655
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:25,940
Scott: So first of all There are situations in life where if you live in a certain area Or you grew up in a certain way you got used to something, right?

656
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:32,780
Scott: So for example someone who grew up say getting used to I don't know chef boyardee, right?

657
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:53,240
Scott: Uh, which is a pizza related food that has sauce and pasta which is bread like And then suddenly are encountered with like real italian food or the real italian restaurant may not like it Even though it is objectively superior because they are used to crap and they have grown To enjoy that crap because it has this familiarity and this psychological thing in their brain, right?

658
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:59,709
Scott: So if you grew up with eating dominoes you have this thing for dominoes even though it's crap And you like it.

659
00:39:59,729 --> 00:40:11,032
Scott: and if you encounter good pizza You may not like it even though it is better because you're used to and have this, you know Nostalgia affection for this bad thing and that's why you like it.

660
00:40:11,313 --> 00:40:15,264
Scott: I think I see this the most actually not with pizza But with taco bell.

661
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:24,920
Scott: there are people who just fucking love taco bell and they know it's crap, but they always want to go there Even though they know it's not like even really mexican food.

662
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:34,076
Rym: Oh, yeah, but i'll put it this way if if I was really hungry and I was in a bad place And the restaurants lined up in front of me were mcdonald's burger king arby's and taco bell.

663
00:40:34,116 --> 00:40:35,240
Rym: I go to taco bell in a heartbeat.

664
00:40:35,862 --> 00:40:36,563
Scott: What were the choices?

665
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:39,150
Rym: mcdonald's burger king arby's taco bell arby's.

666
00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:40,313
Rym: what are you gonna get at?

667
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:40,594
Rym: arby's?

668
00:40:40,614 --> 00:40:42,760
Rym: chicken fingers chicken fingers and curly fries?

669
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,592
Scott: Yeah, I would not touch anything else in that restaurant.

670
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:47,440
Rym: When was the last time you ate those curly fries?

671
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,425
Scott: They're really good.

672
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:49,918
Rym: When was the last time you ate them?

673
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,545
Scott: Probably in college.

674
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:57,867
Rym: Yeah, because you know what your mouth is gonna say These are all right, and then the rest of your body is gonna say oh hell no Uh, that's all right.

675
00:40:58,229 --> 00:40:58,993
Scott: That's better than anything.

676
00:40:59,013 --> 00:41:01,167
Scott: The taco bell is gonna do to me plus I.

677
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:04,344
Rym: I think it's partly that they're A lot of times.

678
00:41:04,384 --> 00:41:09,770
Rym: if you don't it's not that people like a lot of people I talk to it's not like they will say Uh that new york pizza is disgusting.

679
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:17,400
Rym: They actually much prefer the new york pizza But their line of what is acceptable is much lower because they can't get good pizza nearby.

680
00:41:17,581 --> 00:41:20,040
Scott: You got to lower your bar based on what you can get right?

681
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,924
Scott: You don't want to just like.

682
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:26,556
Scott: imagine you just you know, if we were stuck in some place Where literally the only pizza was mediocre pizza.

683
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:27,300
Rym: I just won't eat pizza.

684
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:32,634
Scott: And then but you go so long and eventually when you get a cave I would just i'd give up on pizza when you're gonna cave.

685
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:36,400
Rym: if I lived in downtown Seattle and that delivery pizza was all I could get I would never eat pizza again.

686
00:41:37,544 --> 00:41:38,438
Scott: But what if you didn't know better?

687
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,787
Rym: Well, that's the decision once you.

688
00:41:40,988 --> 00:41:42,757
Rym: once you find out you can't go back.

689
00:41:42,777 --> 00:41:43,240
Scott: I don't.

690
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,140
Rym: I mean remember that time we accidentally ordered the godfather's pizza in albany.

691
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:49,702
Scott: All right.

692
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:50,123
Scott: So I got.

693
00:41:50,183 --> 00:41:51,889
Scott: I got some pizza related anecdotes here.

694
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:52,993
Scott: I got pizza related.

695
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:55,040
Scott: Anecdote number one red baron red baron.

696
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,466
Rym: Yep, red baron.

697
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:01,986
Rym: I was reminded of that recently because our friend jared sorensen tweeted at length about he cooked.

698
00:42:02,006 --> 00:42:06,420
Rym: he cooked a cheese brat in the microwave and forgot what microwaves do with cheese.

699
00:42:06,581 --> 00:42:07,042
Scott: That's right.

700
00:42:07,384 --> 00:42:08,347
Rym: And I think he's dead now.

701
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:11,780
Scott: Anyway, so in college we would get we would need food.

702
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,479
Scott: It'd be late at night.

703
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:17,958
Scott: The only food we could get was frozen food and they had these frozen pizzas called red from red baron.

704
00:42:17,978 --> 00:42:19,838
Rym: They weren't even frozen They were refrigerated.

705
00:42:20,181 --> 00:42:21,346
Rym: They were in a bag.

706
00:42:21,386 --> 00:42:24,540
Scott: They came in this little piece of cardboard that was like had shiny foil on it.

707
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,215
Rym: They were like a dollar forty nine, but it wasn't tin foil.

708
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:28,140
Scott: so you could microwave it.

709
00:42:28,561 --> 00:42:30,188
Rym: Yeah, they were like a dollar forty nine.

710
00:42:30,389 --> 00:42:33,140
Rym: We basically run to the corner the corner store.

711
00:42:33,401 --> 00:42:34,708
Scott: Yeah at like 11 at night.

712
00:42:34,728 --> 00:42:35,754
Scott: It was the only food we could get.

713
00:42:35,774 --> 00:42:36,880
Scott: we were hungry college kids.

714
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:38,246
Scott: You put it in the microwave.

715
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:38,347
Scott: Now.

716
00:42:38,387 --> 00:42:39,673
Scott: This is an old microwave.

717
00:42:39,693 --> 00:42:41,200
Scott: We would just make everything crazy hot.

718
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:43,809
Scott: Uh, so but we were so hungry.

719
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:47,023
Scott: We would eat it before it was cool like hipsters I would burn.

720
00:42:47,043 --> 00:42:50,193
Scott: we would burn the roof of our mouth on this not good pizza.

721
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:53,705
Rym: that pizza was awful But I was so hungry.

722
00:42:53,745 --> 00:42:57,055
Scott: It would fill our college stomachs at 11 at night.

723
00:42:57,196 --> 00:42:57,898
Scott: the red baron.

724
00:42:57,918 --> 00:43:00,766
Rym: so I still have fond memories there.

725
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:04,940
Rym: In fact, I imagine eating one right now and imagining it still being really satisfying.

726
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:07,396
Scott: Well, I think part of it was you burned your mouth so you couldn't taste it.

727
00:43:07,457 --> 00:43:15,371
Rym: Yeah So my my anecdote will just trade anecdotes, uh, you know The apocryphal tale of people getting kicked out of all-you-can-eat restaurants.

728
00:43:15,813 --> 00:43:17,780
Rym: I did get kicked out of an all-you-can-eat pizza hut.

729
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:19,320
Scott: It was an all-you-can-eat pizza.

730
00:43:19,441 --> 00:43:23,059
Rym: So pizza hut used to do a thing when I was in high school of all-you-can-eat at lunch.

731
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:27,680
Rym: So I was on a band trip and we stopped at a rest stop the area.

732
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,200
Scott: They figured that no one who could eat that much would come there for lunch.

733
00:43:30,502 --> 00:43:34,465
Rym: We had an hour and a half to eat lunch and do whatever we wanted But we had to be back on the bus.

734
00:43:34,868 --> 00:43:38,852
Rym: Everyone stupid went over to mcdonald's and taco bell Me and a couple other of my friends.

735
00:43:38,913 --> 00:43:39,940
Rym: We were like guys.

736
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,828
Rym: There's a pizza hut across the freeway.

737
00:43:40,848 --> 00:43:46,260
Scott: That reminds me when I was in israel And we got off a bus to eat lunch and me and this other guy whose first name was actually ruben.

738
00:43:47,101 --> 00:43:55,035
Scott: We went to like this crazy awesome Thai place and got these ridiculous sandwiches that were like crazy long and a delicious meats on them And everyone else went to mcdonald's.

739
00:43:56,661 --> 00:43:59,814
Rym: So me and the four of us were like let's go across the freeway.

740
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:03,631
Rym: like it was kind of dodgy to get over there But we did it to the pizza hut did the lunch buffet.

741
00:44:03,651 --> 00:44:04,696
Scott: That's why no one went over there.

742
00:44:04,716 --> 00:44:07,306
Rym: Yeah, because They fucked up.

743
00:44:07,366 --> 00:44:08,815
Scott: They didn't want to get killed by a car.

744
00:44:08,836 --> 00:44:09,439
Scott: It wasn't worth it.

745
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,266
Rym: We all got the all-you-can-eat.

746
00:44:11,286 --> 00:44:14,860
Rym: We went up to the pizza bar and there were only three pizzas up there.

747
00:44:15,281 --> 00:44:16,244
Rym: We took every slice.

748
00:44:16,545 --> 00:44:17,729
Rym: Yeah, we ate them all.

749
00:44:18,211 --> 00:44:22,864
Rym: We went back up took all the breadsticks and ate them all and then we waited Like 20 minutes later.

750
00:44:22,904 --> 00:44:24,269
Rym: They brought out a bunch more pizzas.

751
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:29,546
Rym: We went out the mall took them all ate everything And then we just stood by.

752
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:38,919
Rym: we went back up and we stood by the buffet table like waiting for our pizza to come out And then other customers kind of walked up too because apparently we'd taken all the pizzas so they didn't get any.

753
00:44:39,502 --> 00:44:40,628
Scott: They didn't make enough pizzas.

754
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:43,080
Rym: So we're standing there and then we got more pizza.

755
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,300
Rym: We start to take it and then literally the manager comes out and he's like you guys have had enough you've got to leave.

756
00:44:47,862 --> 00:44:49,129
Scott: It's like it's all you can eat.

757
00:44:49,149 --> 00:44:49,732
Scott: screw you give us.

758
00:44:49,752 --> 00:44:56,596
Rym: so we made a big stink And we kind of argued with the guy for a while and we ended up paying but we gave a zero tip.

759
00:44:56,717 --> 00:45:01,013
Scott: Yeah And why don't you do tip if you got up and got your own?

760
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:02,439
Rym: Yeah one I got my own pizza.

761
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:03,834
Rym: two It wasn't enough pizza.

762
00:45:03,854 --> 00:45:04,259
Scott: That's right.

763
00:45:04,883 --> 00:45:09,563
Rym: No tip for you, and it was very telling that that promotion ended Just generally.

764
00:45:09,664 --> 00:45:11,912
Scott: all you can eat generally and did is I haven't seen it.

765
00:45:11,932 --> 00:45:13,999
Scott: in a lot of places golden corral still exists.

766
00:45:15,021 --> 00:45:20,166
Scott: Uh golden corral is not the worst It's not the worst.

767
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:21,713
Rym: well when was the last?

768
00:45:21,954 --> 00:45:23,079
Scott: it's second the worst maybe.

769
00:45:23,991 --> 00:45:25,514
Rym: Have you ever seen the inside of golden corral?

770
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:26,256
Scott: I've seen the outside.

771
00:45:26,276 --> 00:45:27,478
Rym: have you seen the inside of one?

772
00:45:27,498 --> 00:45:32,159
Rym: No Uh farx had stories relatively recently about what goes on inside golden corral.

773
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,086
Rym: Do not go into those places.

774
00:45:35,588 --> 00:45:38,756
Rym: I would rather eat at an old country buffet than a golden girl.

775
00:45:38,776 --> 00:45:39,458
Scott: Oh, really?

776
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:41,507
Scott: Yeah No, it is.

777
00:45:41,547 --> 00:45:42,874
Rym: the food is equal quality.

778
00:45:42,894 --> 00:45:44,040
Rym: the clientele.

779
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:49,574
Rym: Golden corral is a feeding trough of sin and misery.

780
00:45:49,594 --> 00:45:53,559
Scott: Oh that kind of sounds more interesting than a country Maybe is a spectator.

781
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:54,982
Rym: I don't know.

782
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:55,564
Rym: I feel like it would.

783
00:45:55,664 --> 00:45:56,326
Rym: it's scarring.

784
00:45:56,887 --> 00:46:01,159
Rym: Uh, I would rather eat at a chucky cheeses than eat at a golden corral.

785
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:09,272
Scott: So one time me you and james went to An ice hockey game a college ice hockey game.

786
00:46:09,393 --> 00:46:10,316
Scott: It was in oswego.

787
00:46:10,456 --> 00:46:11,420
Rym: Oh the oswego one, right?

788
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,439
Scott: I was in the middle of fuck nowhere in new york.

789
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:22,420
Scott: uh we drove there and then we finished the hockey game and we wanted food and there was nothing to eat in the middle of nowhere and We had like a more than an hour drive home.

790
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,123
Scott: There was nothing.

791
00:46:23,143 --> 00:46:26,400
Scott: there was nothing that was open for eating except for this pizza hut.

792
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,405
Scott: We went into the pizza hut.

793
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:29,474
Scott: we ordered one pizza for three people.

794
00:46:29,494 --> 00:46:30,559
Rym: We were the only people in there.

795
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:33,192
Scott: There's someone else in there the one waiter.

796
00:46:33,513 --> 00:46:37,568
Scott: Anyway, he brought us a pizza And he you know, we're just getting ready to eat it.

797
00:46:37,588 --> 00:46:43,620
Scott: I didn't even notice but before we start eating he says hey It doesn't look like there's a lot of cheese on that pizza.

798
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:47,278
Scott: So we look at it and sure enough this is basically bread with sauce on it.

799
00:46:48,463 --> 00:46:54,460
Scott: And he's like, I think he like, you know Realized you were the kind of people who weren't going to fight with him and were so hungry and it was crazy late at night.

800
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,636
Scott: He'd get rid of this obviously, uh malfunctioned pizza.

801
00:46:57,776 --> 00:47:01,631
Scott: Yep Uh, even like compared to other pizza pizzas, right?

802
00:47:01,671 --> 00:47:02,675
Scott: This one was messed up.

803
00:47:02,855 --> 00:47:03,618
Scott: They had no cheese.

804
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:06,891
Scott: Yep He's like, how about you don't pay for this pizza?

805
00:47:07,132 --> 00:47:08,799
Scott: And we're like, we're okay with that.

806
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:15,932
Scott: And he's like, but instead of me giving you another pizza, that is good You just shake parmesan on there and eat that.

807
00:47:15,952 --> 00:47:17,640
Scott: and i'm like, I don't give a fuck.

808
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,827
Scott: But I was like, it's too late for this shit.

809
00:47:19,907 --> 00:47:23,479
Rym: I was like, I only have like 28 total in assets right now.

810
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:26,710
Scott: Oh, right the repo the repo man was coming for you.

811
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:29,780
Rym: that was at like the deepest poverty of my college days.

812
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:33,495
Scott: So yeah, by the way a pizza with parmesan is not a good pizza.

813
00:47:33,957 --> 00:47:34,680
Rym: I was so hungry.

814
00:47:34,881 --> 00:47:36,567
Scott: Hunger is the best spice.

815
00:47:36,948 --> 00:47:43,379
Rym: Not only did I not care and I remember that pizza tasting really good But I was still super fucking hungry after we ate it.

816
00:47:43,585 --> 00:47:55,860
Rym: Yeah And when we got home, I remember I remember specifically like we finally got home and I went and I opened the fridge and there was Nothing to eat like not eat like nothing unless I wanted to cook and we only had like two eggs.

817
00:47:56,222 --> 00:47:59,960
Rym: And I remember I cooked both those eggs, then I went to bed and I was miserable.

818
00:48:00,681 --> 00:48:01,403
Rym: Good hockey game though.

819
00:48:01,784 --> 00:48:02,005
Scott: Yes.

820
00:48:02,025 --> 00:48:03,088
Rym: I don't remember if we won or lost.

821
00:48:03,108 --> 00:48:03,730
Rym: I think we lost.

822
00:48:03,991 --> 00:48:04,473
Scott: I don't remember.

823
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:05,075
Scott: Yeah.

824
00:48:05,556 --> 00:48:08,426
Scott: Anyway, oh Anecdote.

825
00:48:08,446 --> 00:48:09,360
Rym: do I have a good anecdote?

826
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:20,940
Rym: so one time I was doing science olympiad with the people who were in charge of that in my middle school and they were like Let's get a. and they named like this weird pizza place like a weird style of pizza I'd never heard of and my dad knew what it was.

827
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:27,460
Rym: He was like, yeah And everyone was into it except me and a few and a few of the other kids No idea what the fuck they were talking about.

828
00:48:27,902 --> 00:48:30,111
Rym: And then they started grilling us like oh you never had one of these.

829
00:48:30,673 --> 00:48:32,039
Rym: Uh, like making a big deal about it.

830
00:48:32,664 --> 00:48:33,979
Rym: What eventually got delivered?

831
00:48:34,841 --> 00:48:36,198
Rym: Was more than two inches thick.

832
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,184
Scott: Well more than two inches.

833
00:48:38,224 --> 00:48:40,692
Rym: it was shaped like a pizza, but the crust went all the way around.

834
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:47,780
Rym: it was basically like a dough Crust container in the shape of the dough was on top and bottom and sides.

835
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:52,294
Scott: I've seen i've seen tv commercials with pictures of those it was filled to the brim.

836
00:48:52,394 --> 00:48:56,247
Scott: It's basically a sauce cheese pie Yes, but sometimes there's other stuff in there.

837
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,133
Rym: a pizza pie one might say.

838
00:48:58,334 --> 00:49:03,936
Scott: well, usually a pizza pie That does not have a crust over the top like an apple pie does.

839
00:49:03,956 --> 00:49:06,293
Rym: Oh, wow Usually making distinctions.

840
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:08,813
Rym: now there too Why do we call it a pizza pie?

841
00:49:09,015 --> 00:49:11,187
Rym: It's not a pie So, but we call it a pie.

842
00:49:11,228 --> 00:49:13,580
Scott: the thing that you had though with the crust over the top that was a pie.

843
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,162
Scott: That was a pie.

844
00:49:14,443 --> 00:49:18,700
Rym: it was full of like chopped ham and artichokes and all this nonsense.

845
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,956
Rym: And it was crazy good and I ate a whole bunch of it and then I got kind of sick.

846
00:49:22,997 --> 00:49:23,942
Rym: and that's the end of that Story.

847
00:49:24,103 --> 00:49:24,808
Scott: Yeah, those aren't bad.

848
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:26,460
Scott: They're just uh, not pizza.

849
00:49:27,641 --> 00:49:32,480
Rym: So that one I might I might accept saying that that is not pizza, but you know what I would call it.

850
00:49:33,001 --> 00:49:35,107
Rym: I would call it a casserole maybe.

851
00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:41,960
Scott: so regardless of any pizza not pizza semantics What is the best varieties?

852
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:49,167
Rym: Of pizza, I really mostly in terms of toppings and such, you know Ask me at different stages of my life My answer is very different.

853
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:52,968
Rym: when I was in like middle school high school As much meat and garbage as you can like.

854
00:49:52,988 --> 00:49:54,614
Rym: just cover the pizza in garbage.

855
00:49:54,835 --> 00:49:55,337
Rym: I'm gonna eat it.

856
00:49:55,357 --> 00:49:55,799
Rym: Mm-hmm.

857
00:49:56,521 --> 00:50:00,895
Rym: And in rit, it was whatever pizza we can get because everyone was stupid one.

858
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:05,780
Rym: I was hungry and two Between everyone we knew no one would fucking eat anything on their pizza.

859
00:50:06,021 --> 00:50:09,691
Scott: Well, I think the greatest thing about pizza actually is that it's so unifying.

860
00:50:09,912 --> 00:50:14,791
Scott: even if someone unless someone's a vegan and doesn't want cheese Yep, everyone can eat pizza.

861
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,178
Scott: It's a vegetarian thing.

862
00:50:16,238 --> 00:50:17,422
Scott: Yep It's almost.

863
00:50:17,442 --> 00:50:22,054
Scott: there's almost nobody who doesn't like even like even someone who prefers.

864
00:50:22,215 --> 00:50:26,847
Scott: most people prefer not just cheese pizza but Almost everyone like.

865
00:50:26,908 --> 00:50:29,900
Scott: i've never seen someone who like just doesn't like any pizza.

866
00:50:30,362 --> 00:50:36,820
Scott: At least someone will at least if they're like a super pickiest eater They will still like cheese pizza as one of the things they like to eat.

867
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:41,660
Rym: Well, cheese pizza is one of the things next to uh chicken wings or chicken nuggets that those kinds of people will eat.

868
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:49,760
Scott: it's like you're only sort of pushing out the lactose intolerant and the vegans and Dude, a lot of lactose intolerant people I know will fucking eat pizza anyway.

869
00:50:50,101 --> 00:50:53,150
Scott: Well, yeah, and the people who can't eat bread, but pretty much everyone else.

870
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:53,993
Scott: It's like it's.

871
00:50:54,153 --> 00:51:00,739
Scott: there's no food that more people can eat Right together that you can order and get for a party or anything than pizza.

872
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:02,265
Scott: It is so unified.

873
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:06,360
Rym: in my in like the broad adulthood of my life my actual favorite kind of pizza was hawaiian pizza.

874
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:13,016
Rym: Yeah No Because I like the sweet and savory mix together like the pineapple sharpness and sweetness with the ham like.

875
00:51:13,056 --> 00:51:14,540
Rym: I just love hawaiian pizza.

876
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:27,540
Rym: the problem is Now that i'm older and I eat basically much more expensive food all the time I find that unless you get hawaiian pizza from a really fancy place They make it like garbage and really fancy places usually aren't going to have hawaiian pizza.

877
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:28,964
Scott: That's the thing.

878
00:51:29,004 --> 00:51:32,303
Rym: cheap places like all the super fancy delivery places around here They all have hawaiian.

879
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:33,286
Scott: those aren't super fancy.

880
00:51:33,307 --> 00:51:36,699
Rym: if they're delivering, uh here even the fancy places deliver.

881
00:51:37,423 --> 00:51:40,900
Rym: Anyway, like even the italian restaurants will deliver their fancy restaurant pizza here.

882
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:47,130
Scott: Whoa, like like I guess I guess vesta will deliver me a pizza if I ask them to yeah Like masa all the places down by vernon jackson.

883
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,075
Rym: They'll deliver the pizza.

884
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,080
Scott: This is not that fancy.

885
00:51:49,801 --> 00:51:52,148
Rym: Anyway, their pizza is the fancy style.

886
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,433
Rym: It's not the delivery style.

887
00:51:53,453 --> 00:51:55,540
Scott: See I like a wide variety of pizzas.

888
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,012
Scott: There's almost no topping that I do not want on a pizza lately.

889
00:51:59,153 --> 00:52:04,372
Scott: I will even eat in it the empty, uh, You know the much maligned anchovy pizza.

890
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,020
Rym: Oh, dude anchovy pizza is the best, right?

891
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,628
Scott: It's not the best but like if it's there I will eat it.

892
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:11,338
Scott: I'm not like ew anchovies like tv is right.

893
00:52:11,499 --> 00:52:13,048
Rym: Yep anchovies are delicious.

894
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,987
Rym: get them in your caesar salad, too, but My favorite pizza is actually.

895
00:52:17,088 --> 00:52:23,130
Scott: I like the simpler pizzas right like a pepperoni mushroom Right, but I prefer pepperoni onion.

896
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,260
Scott: But yes pepperoni onions also great, you know.

897
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:31,220
Scott: But the thing is I you know, it's that's that is only the greatest when it's made the greatest, right?

898
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,626
Scott: It's like you can make a crappy.

899
00:52:32,726 --> 00:52:35,560
Scott: just you can go somewhere that's crappy and get a pepperoni mushroom and it sucks.

900
00:52:35,721 --> 00:52:39,619
Scott: But when it's really good, it's really good.

901
00:52:39,941 --> 00:52:44,540
Rym: That's my favorite pizzas lately are things like margarita pizzas grandma pizza.

902
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:46,784
Scott: It's so top tier.

903
00:52:46,824 --> 00:52:52,786
Scott: the grandma pizza and I tend to as much as like the grandma pizza is like so deceptive Like it looks like a regular pizza like.

904
00:52:52,827 --> 00:52:53,389
Scott: how is that is?

905
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:54,172
Scott: what's the difference?

906
00:52:54,192 --> 00:52:57,338
Rym: then you get that little garlic the marinade Some basil going on, right?

907
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:03,640
Scott: You know, it's like it tastes more like a pizza that italian grandma made than just sauce and cheese on a bread.

908
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,464
Scott: It's it's got.

909
00:53:04,484 --> 00:53:07,095
Rym: there's a place near my office that makes a really good grandma pizza.

910
00:53:07,175 --> 00:53:08,200
Rym: I get it like twice a week.

911
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:11,098
Scott: No, I don't get pizza that often but I eat a lot of food.

912
00:53:11,118 --> 00:53:11,440
Rym: What do you want?

913
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,042
Scott: Yeah, the pizza.

914
00:53:12,062 --> 00:53:16,600
Scott: there's so many pizza places near us, uh, living, you know in such a touristy zone.

915
00:53:17,101 --> 00:53:27,538
Scott: But there's one place it's just called gotham pizza and it looks like a regular old pizza place and the pizza isn't the best pizza But it's like so solid new york pizza right with the.

916
00:53:27,779 --> 00:53:28,804
Scott: you know It's just made.

917
00:53:28,925 --> 00:53:30,091
Scott: everything is made properly.

918
00:53:30,232 --> 00:53:31,539
Scott: All the different varieties are good.

919
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:32,703
Scott: Their oven is hot.

920
00:53:33,245 --> 00:53:37,860
Rym: the place I go downtown is one of the like 30 places named little italy pizza.

921
00:53:38,844 --> 00:53:40,076
Scott: I think we also got to talk about.

922
00:53:40,197 --> 00:53:43,192
Scott: you know There's certain varieties of pizza that are like kind of rare.

923
00:53:43,614 --> 00:53:46,706
Scott: you can only get them in certain places For example the two boots.

924
00:53:47,087 --> 00:53:48,090
Scott: There's only a few.

925
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,595
Scott: there's only a few two boots.

926
00:53:49,635 --> 00:53:51,020
Scott: They're not like everywhere in the world.

927
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:56,818
Rym: I've only ever seen them in new york two boots than I used to be Because it used to be that they were the cool weird pizzas.

928
00:53:57,181 --> 00:53:59,269
Rym: But the last time I had two boots was about two years ago.

929
00:53:59,289 --> 00:54:00,555
Rym: It was just kind of shitty.

930
00:54:00,575 --> 00:54:09,308
Scott: I haven't had it in Maybe over a year, but I used to have it pretty frequently when I was working like a few blocks away from a two boots And it was the best pizza in the area.

931
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:16,840
Scott: and the thing I like about two boots is that it's you know It's got the same crust as regular new york pizza and the same cheese, but the weird stuff, right?

932
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,780
Scott: They got really good topping combinations.

933
00:54:20,342 --> 00:54:26,280
Scott: But usually if you get a topping combination in normal pizza place, you'll get like big old chunks of broccoli and stuff on there.

934
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:30,799
Scott: It's like that tastes good but it's like they don't put the toppings on right and you'll end up getting like.

935
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:34,720
Scott: You know, you won't be eating those toppings together in sort of a good food way.

936
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,011
Scott: It'll just be like this bite had broccoli in it.

937
00:54:37,252 --> 00:54:47,740
Scott: This bite had a pepperoni in it Whereas two boots, you know the way they prepare the toppings and put them on there so evenly and so well mixed And like under the cheese or in the cheese as necessary.

938
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:55,200
Scott: Well, that is how I decide it comes into like, you know a well constructed You know thing that you can fold and shove in your mouth.

939
00:54:55,381 --> 00:54:58,373
Rym: that's how I decide in a vacuum where to order pizza from.

940
00:54:58,413 --> 00:55:01,771
Rym: because if a place just says Get a pizza and pick your toppings.

941
00:55:01,811 --> 00:55:03,160
Rym: That place is almost always garbage.

942
00:55:03,581 --> 00:55:08,520
Rym: If the place has here are the 10 kinds of pizza we make it's probably a much better place.

943
00:55:08,981 --> 00:55:09,443
Scott: Someone went.

944
00:55:09,503 --> 00:55:10,447
Scott: put some thought into that.

945
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:14,240
Rym: Yeah, and what i'll do now is i'll order only from those kinds of places.

946
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,920
Rym: So i'll get like the grandma pizza or something.

947
00:55:16,362 --> 00:55:19,412
Rym: But then i'll always do an augment like i'll add one topping.

948
00:55:19,453 --> 00:55:25,822
Rym: and lately the things I want to add are either onions cremini mushrooms or capers Capers.

949
00:55:25,842 --> 00:55:28,353
Rym: capers are real effing good on a pizza.

950
00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:30,988
Scott: capers are pretty powerful flavor, though I feel like they overpower.

951
00:55:31,008 --> 00:55:32,700
Rym: you gotta use it on the very specific kind of pizza.

952
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:32,941
Rym: Like you.

953
00:55:32,961 --> 00:55:34,426
Rym: don't mix capers with something else.

954
00:55:34,466 --> 00:55:38,160
Scott: that's also strong and almost anything with capers is overpowered by caper power.

955
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:45,912
Rym: So a grandma pizza with capers as long as the capers are subtle as long as they're sparse Yeah, they gotta be sparse like two per slice.

956
00:55:45,932 --> 00:55:49,117
Rym: Yeah, yeah Just like this layer of capers.

957
00:55:49,882 --> 00:55:51,187
Scott: Where could you even get that many capers?

958
00:55:51,207 --> 00:55:51,910
Scott: It could have been afforded.

959
00:55:52,252 --> 00:55:53,437
Rym: Yeah, just take them take the little.

960
00:55:53,537 --> 00:55:54,200
Scott: they're not that cheap.

961
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,478
Rym: Take that little bottle just dump it all out on the pizza.

962
00:55:56,518 --> 00:56:01,240
Rym: Yeah What the fuck is this new haven style pizza is a thing that has its own wikipedia page.

963
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,549
Scott: Yeah, so apparently people it's called a pizza.

964
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,400
Rym: white clam is the kind of pizza they make here.

965
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,720
Scott: Yes, there's a place in new haven that's like, you know near yale that pepe invented it.

966
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,451
Scott: That's like their famous pizza place.

967
00:56:12,471 --> 00:56:12,592
Scott: Like.

968
00:56:12,652 --> 00:56:13,800
Scott: it's like such a big deal.

969
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:20,519
Rym: It's like the biggest white pizza with olive oil oregano cheese chopped garlic and clams other than And they can they cook it way too hot.

970
00:56:20,687 --> 00:56:22,547
Scott: Yes Other than you know yale itself.

971
00:56:22,768 --> 00:56:25,820
Scott: this pizza place in new haven is like the biggest deal in the town.

972
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,987
Scott: It's like the only thing they've got.

973
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:32,120
Scott: and if you go there and ask people what to eat That's like the only thing that people bring up is this one pizza place.

974
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:37,844
Scott: I've never actually been to it because even though i've been to and through new haven very often I've never like downtown.

975
00:56:37,885 --> 00:56:40,372
Scott: new haven is not near like the highways or anything.

976
00:56:40,393 --> 00:56:41,978
Scott: I don't go there that frequently.

977
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:42,700
Rym: Yeah, it looks okay.

978
00:56:43,562 --> 00:56:46,738
Scott: You know, I just never went to that place because I just never did so.

979
00:56:47,562 --> 00:56:51,720
Rym: So I used to like much meatier pizzas, but just i've actually tried to cut a lot of meat out of my diet.

980
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,653
Rym: Just you know, I eat too much meat.

981
00:56:53,673 --> 00:56:54,699
Rym: At least I used to eat too much meat.

982
00:56:55,428 --> 00:57:01,333
Rym: So If I get meat on a pizza now, I used to always go for like sausage But pretty much I actually prefer pepperoni.

983
00:57:01,434 --> 00:57:04,250
Rym: pepperoni is delicious Like that's my favorite meat on a pizza now.

984
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:09,691
Scott: pepperoni is a really delicious meat And it's really only appropriate in like a few scenarios, right?

985
00:57:09,711 --> 00:57:12,098
Scott: You don't usually get like sandwiches with pepperoni too.

986
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:12,440
Rym: I do.

987
00:57:13,082 --> 00:57:18,897
Scott: Yeah, you know, but it's like a pizza is where it belongs and that is you know If you want to enjoy its flavor, that is the best place.

988
00:57:18,917 --> 00:57:23,200
Rym: because yep The worst though is when you get a pizza that has pepperoni, but they cook the pizza wrong.

989
00:57:23,563 --> 00:57:30,877
Rym: So the pepperoni is on top of the pizza Curled up into little bowls of pepperoni filled with its own grease and burned on the edges.

990
00:57:30,937 --> 00:57:31,580
Scott: mistakes are made.

991
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:32,523
Rym: That is like.

992
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,651
Scott: that's also a sign of low quality pepperonis.

993
00:57:34,692 --> 00:57:36,840
Scott: Yep, and that is also how it's sliced too thick.

994
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:47,601
Rym: That's how the pepperoni has looked on every pepperoni pizza I have ever gotten anywhere in the city of seattle except in a sit-down restaurant since 2008.

995
00:57:47,601 --> 00:57:49,366
Rym: So i'm sorry, stop telling it's usually.

996
00:57:49,527 --> 00:57:52,636
Scott: it's usually a consequence of too thick cutting the pepperonis.

997
00:57:52,837 --> 00:57:58,220
Rym: Yeah, you want thin ones Yeah, but they're tiny they're shitty and also they put them in the wrong places or they don't pre-cook.

998
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,755
Scott: Yeah, some people put too much and some people don't put enough.

999
00:58:01,298 --> 00:58:04,290
Rym: Yep Just I don't that cup of grease.

1000
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:06,560
Rym: It's just like like why do you think that's okay?

1001
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:06,941
Scott: All right.

1002
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:12,500
Scott: Now the final thing we must discuss but I hope everyone knows already is the proper way to eat a pizza, right?

1003
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:18,095
Scott: If it's not a square pizza, which it rarely is it's a triangle pizza.

1004
00:58:18,115 --> 00:58:19,780
Scott: Well, it's a circle that's cut into triangles.

1005
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,699
Scott: You fold that shit from the back and you put the pointy end in your mouth.

1006
00:58:25,412 --> 00:58:32,187
Scott: All right If you do if you get a fork and knife you can shove it the fork in your left eye And you can shove the knife in your right eye.

1007
00:58:32,388 --> 00:58:34,435
Rym: so you don't deserve the pizza.

1008
00:58:34,796 --> 00:58:37,548
Scott: use a fork and knife Then you can shove them in your eye.

1009
00:58:37,729 --> 00:58:38,393
Rym: So I do it.

1010
00:58:38,956 --> 00:58:44,220
Rym: if i'm hungry And the pizza is way too hot like the point that it burns my hands when I touch it then just wait.

1011
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,244
Rym: No, i'm too hungry.

1012
00:58:45,506 --> 00:58:47,233
Rym: So I cut the tip then you burn your mouth.

1013
00:58:47,534 --> 00:58:47,735
Scott: No.

1014
00:58:47,776 --> 00:58:48,800
Scott: Yeah, you should cut the tip off.

1015
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,653
Rym: That's what you should do and then it'll cool really cool.

1016
00:58:50,673 --> 00:58:51,540
Rym: You got yours cut off, right?

1017
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,766
Scott: And you're saying that's what you deserve.

1018
00:58:54,148 --> 00:58:56,860
Scott: after you uh, ate the pizza with a fork and knife.

1019
00:58:57,121 --> 00:58:59,855
Rym: Uh, if it's chicago style you're gonna cut it up with a fork and knife.

1020
00:58:59,956 --> 00:59:00,740
Scott: that's not pizza though.

1021
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,889
Rym: So that's fine and it's good.

1022
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:03,219
Scott: That is the right way to eat that food.

1023
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:13,623
Rym: but also Sometimes even in new york even a new york style pizza You can't fuck crack the bottom and hold it up because the front end will go blorp Like that.

1024
00:59:13,644 --> 00:59:15,672
Rym: that happens a lot even in good places that it.

1025
00:59:15,732 --> 00:59:17,620
Scott: no that does not happen if the pizza is made.

1026
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:19,379
Rym: Well, no that happens even in good places.

1027
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,633
Scott: Also, it is dependent on your skills of folding.

1028
00:59:22,653 --> 00:59:24,783
Scott: maybe since you grew up in michigan You don't have the skills.

1029
00:59:25,024 --> 00:59:28,376
Rym: So what I will often do is i'll cut just like i'll go again.

1030
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:33,180
Rym: I'll cut the tip off the pizza I'll eat that and then i'll crack the rest of it.

1031
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:39,100
Scott: It's actually I think a number file video about You know the shape of the pizza and whether it'll blorp and how to get it to unblorp.

1032
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:39,402
Rym: You know what?

1033
00:59:39,422 --> 00:59:42,520
Rym: That's like the video that taught me the correct way to eat a hamburger.

1034
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:50,479
Rym: Well, you put your pinky and your thumb on the bottom and the three fingers on the top and I felt really stupid for having Not figured that out in 20 years.

1035
00:59:51,245 --> 00:59:53,200
Scott: Okay I don't know how you're eating hamburgers.

1036
00:59:54,162 --> 00:59:55,450
Rym: So the video talked about it at length.

1037
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:56,818
Rym: americans do not do that.

1038
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,058
Rym: Americans put their thumb on the bottom and their entire hand on the top.

1039
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,831
Rym: Okay, like no one puts their pinky down there.

1040
01:00:04,213 --> 01:00:05,840
Rym: pretty much if they do it's kind of weird.

1041
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,930
Scott: And doesn't everything fall out the back if you don't do that.

1042
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:10,060
Rym: Yeah, that's a very common thing that happens with hamburgers.

1043
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:11,940
Scott: I mean, I don't eat the way anyone else eats, right?

1044
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,147
Rym: I just keep the fork on my left hand a hundred percent and you hold it backwards and you kind of like Just kind of just stab at your food.

1045
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:17,629
Rym: You're weird.

1046
01:00:18,212 --> 01:00:18,635
Scott: It works.

1047
01:00:18,795 --> 01:00:19,660
Scott: It's way more efficient.

1048
01:00:19,841 --> 01:00:21,412
Rym: It's just fascinating to watch you eat like.

1049
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:22,338
Rym: I will never get over it.

1050
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,325
Scott: Don't you know how to?

1051
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,800
Scott: why don't you just eat the same way if it's so fascinating?

1052
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,892
Rym: It's fascinating to watch it's not?

1053
01:00:27,952 --> 01:00:28,819
Rym: I wouldn't do it.

1054
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:30,286
Rym: It's like watching someone.

1055
01:00:30,647 --> 01:00:34,947
Rym: it's like watching someone biking with a really weird technique like wow, they're going Good for them.

1056
01:00:34,968 --> 01:00:36,300
Rym: That's fascinating.

1057
01:00:37,341 --> 01:00:38,268
Rym: Not gonna emulate it.

1058
01:00:38,349 --> 01:00:39,759
Scott: My technique is way more powerful.

1059
01:00:40,861 --> 01:00:42,086
Rym: Should we have an eating contest?

1060
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:45,560
Scott: who can eat something faster, but you have to use a fork and knife you can't, you know?

1061
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,151
Rym: Yeah, well, we'll make a challenge.

1062
01:00:47,171 --> 01:00:48,480
Rym: You gotta eat a pizza with a fork and knife.

1063
01:00:49,582 --> 01:00:50,685
Scott: Uh, yeah, okay.

1064
01:00:50,805 --> 01:00:55,960
Scott: I'll stab you and not the two eyes with the fork and a knife and then eat the pizza comfortably with my hands.

1065
01:00:56,902 --> 01:01:10,932
Rym: The one problem I've had with pizza lately is that even though like it's easy to order pizza Uh, if I consult the people who are going to be eating the pizza At all even among close friends Everyone's a super picky eater and doesn't want something.

1066
01:01:10,952 --> 01:01:11,896
Scott: That's not a pizza problem.

1067
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:16,280
Scott: That's a people problem Yeah, but that problem happens even if you order something that's not pizza.

1068
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:20,500
Rym: So what i've decided what i've done i've tried this now is instead of asking anyone.

1069
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:23,793
Rym: The problem is usually I can only get away with this if i'm just.

1070
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:30,568
Rym: i'm gonna order pizza for everyone because you know Otherwise people might be like eh And often they'll give me the five bucks anyway, even if I say that.

1071
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:35,378
Rym: but I just say I ordered pizza It'll be here in an hour.

1072
01:01:36,462 --> 01:01:38,069
Rym: I don't even say i'm gonna order pizza.

1073
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:40,298
Rym: I say I ordered it even if I didn't.

1074
01:01:41,345 --> 01:01:42,273
Rym: I say I ordered pizza.

1075
01:01:42,313 --> 01:01:43,079
Rym: It'll be here in an hour.

1076
01:01:43,424 --> 01:01:46,350
Rym: And if everyone's like, yes Then I order weird pizza because fuck them.

1077
01:01:46,933 --> 01:01:52,838
Rym: and if they're not that into it I order bland ass pizza because I know they're hungry anyway, and at least I know they'll eat it.

1078
01:01:53,762 --> 01:01:58,510
Rym: And that strategy's worked really well and I hope none of the people i've done that to are listening right now because they'll figure me out.

1079
01:02:00,761 --> 01:02:05,480
Scott: Oh and if you are listening and you got you figured Rym out, uh, you know, you're mad at Rym right now.

1080
01:02:05,581 --> 01:02:07,214
Scott: Be mad at me too because you're all picky eaters.

1081
01:02:07,234 --> 01:02:08,945
Scott: get babies Eat anything.

1082
01:02:08,985 --> 01:02:12,380
Scott: if someone orders a pizza and it's like if I don't want the hawaiian pizza, right?

1083
01:02:12,461 --> 01:02:13,512
Scott: I just i'm not a fan of it.

1084
01:02:13,532 --> 01:02:14,320
Scott: I would not order it on purpose.

1085
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:19,640
Rym: Pizza is you can almost any topping you can pick it out Like I could see if you had a religious thing like a food allergy.

1086
01:02:19,901 --> 01:02:22,993
Scott: Yeah, if you have a real allergy a religious thing, whatever you got an excuse.

1087
01:02:23,054 --> 01:02:26,387
Scott: but like I just don't like kawaiian pizza I would not order on purpose, but you know what.

1088
01:02:26,407 --> 01:02:27,331
Rym: pick the ham out of there.

1089
01:02:27,412 --> 01:02:30,799
Scott: if Rym ordered it on Rym ordered it And it was there and I was hungry.

1090
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:34,733
Scott: I would eat it because i'm an adult and this applies to all kinds not just pizza.

1091
01:02:34,773 --> 01:02:36,740
Rym: Would you eat the mcdonald's pizza?

1092
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:40,035
Rym: It's a pizza, but it's got mcdonald's hamburger meat ground up on top of it.

1093
01:02:40,176 --> 01:02:41,080
Rym: What the fuck?

1094
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:42,529
Rym: I'm just saying would you eat that?

1095
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:43,314
Rym: or would you say no ew?

1096
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:47,252
Rym: Well, I mean is this saying it's just a matter of perspective.

1097
01:02:47,433 --> 01:02:47,855
Scott: I mean, it's.

1098
01:02:47,995 --> 01:02:50,385
Rym: I mean, so Would you eat it?

1099
01:02:50,405 --> 01:02:52,112
Rym: Because i'm gonna say right now.

1100
01:02:52,232 --> 01:02:53,376
Rym: No, fuck that.

1101
01:02:53,878 --> 01:02:54,300
Scott: It depends.

1102
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,540
Rym: Is this a situation where if I was starving to death, it's about I would consider it.

1103
01:02:59,761 --> 01:03:01,309
Scott: It's about the scenario, right?

1104
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:03,160
Scott: Is this a scenario like if i'm at a party?

1105
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:13,800
Scott: Right, and I really you know This party is a scenario in which food is being delivered for everyone to eat And the person hosting the party orders a fuck ton of mcdonald's for everyone to eat.

1106
01:03:14,622 --> 01:03:18,039
Scott: I would actually probably go for that pizza ahead of like a big bank, right?

1107
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,348
Scott: In display of available mcdonald's foods.

1108
01:03:21,709 --> 01:03:24,820
Scott: and that's a situation where i'm going to be an adult and eat the food that's at the party.

1109
01:03:25,382 --> 01:03:28,013
Scott: But if it's just like, you know, I want some pizza.

1110
01:03:28,274 --> 01:03:29,338
Scott: would I go to mcdonald's?

1111
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:34,825
Scott: No I think in that scenario unless if someone on the street said here Do you want a slice of pizza?

1112
01:03:34,845 --> 01:03:35,689
Scott: It's a mcdonald's pizza.

1113
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:36,512
Scott: I would say no.

1114
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:42,596
Rym: if it was a hospitality situation Like if a family invited me into their home and they bust out that mcdonald's pizza.

1115
01:03:42,656 --> 01:03:51,952
Scott: if i'm with a group of people And we're all hanging out together because they're like visiting town and every single person Wants to go to mcdonald's and i'm in this group i'll go but I won't eat.

1116
01:03:52,735 --> 01:03:55,869
Scott: Uh, I would probably eat Chicken nuggets and french fries.

1117
01:03:56,312 --> 01:03:59,727
Rym: I think I would just not eat Unless it was before breakfast time that I would.

1118
01:03:59,807 --> 01:04:01,474
Scott: maybe i'd get an apple and ice cream.

1119
01:04:01,836 --> 01:04:02,900
Rym: Yeah, don't get their salad.

1120
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:12,302
Rym: Anyway, uh, so what we have not talked about at all because i've cut it out of my life entirely once I left college But it was a staple It would like.

1121
01:04:12,363 --> 01:04:24,432
Rym: it was one of my food groups throughout basically my entire life until I graduated and until like halfway through our time in beacon frozen pizza Like actual frozen DiGiorno or whatever pizza.

1122
01:04:24,492 --> 01:04:28,131
Scott: Listen, those pizzas depending on the situation Are not the worst.

1123
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:31,327
Rym: they do that thing to your body Like if i'm hungry.

1124
01:04:31,347 --> 01:04:34,900
Scott: they can often be better than delivery pizza based on where you live.

1125
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,090
Rym: Oh compared to the pizza I got in seattle.

1126
01:04:37,191 --> 01:04:39,059
Rym: I would rather eat one of those frozen pizzas.

1127
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:43,240
Scott: However, there is no reason to get them because there is a better technique.

1128
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:48,714
Scott: You can buy at the grocery store for less than the cost of the frozen pizza refrigerator pizza.

1129
01:04:49,015 --> 01:04:53,149
Scott: You can buy a bag of dough And a can of sauce.

1130
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:54,960
Scott: No, not even that's got a bag of cheese.

1131
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:55,603
Rym: That's already too much.

1132
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:58,880
Rym: the point of the frozen pizza is that you do literally nothing to it.

1133
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,125
Scott: You can buy the dough.

1134
01:05:00,145 --> 01:05:01,049
Scott: that's already bread.

1135
01:05:01,129 --> 01:05:05,308
Scott: Basically instead of buying a bag of dough Buy a can of sauce.

1136
01:05:05,329 --> 01:05:06,638
Scott: No, too much work.

1137
01:05:06,658 --> 01:05:10,355
Scott: scott You're forgetting to lower the sauce on there put the cheese in there put in the oven.

1138
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:16,667
Rym: remember at rit instead of getting we kept a few frozen pizzas for emergencies because You know stuff wasn't open late at night.

1139
01:05:16,728 --> 01:05:20,800
Rym: like food emergencies happen on a regular basis and if you had a frozen pizza you were saved.

1140
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,113
Rym: But instead in wegmans, I would get the refrigerated pizza.

1141
01:05:25,374 --> 01:05:26,860
Rym: It's already made just throw in the oven.

1142
01:05:27,486 --> 01:05:28,720
Rym: Not as good as the real pizza.

1143
01:05:28,961 --> 01:05:31,073
Rym: Oh that kind way better than the frozen pizza.

1144
01:05:31,435 --> 01:05:34,469
Rym: just as convenient but it only lasts like a week in the fridge.

1145
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:40,014
Scott: the point is if you do the methods I just said where you buy the Bag of dough the can of sauce the sack of cheese has way more work.

1146
01:05:40,154 --> 01:05:41,360
Scott: any toppings that you want.

1147
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,640
Rym: That's way more work than literally just hitting a button on your oven.

1148
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,239
Scott: It's not a lot of work though, and you will get a fucking delicious pizza if you do that shit.

1149
01:05:49,043 --> 01:05:52,360
Rym: Uh, actually so lately we've been making a lot of pizza because blue apron had a bunch of pizzas.

1150
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:55,339
Scott: We remember I usually cancel my blue apron as a pizza because I can't eat all that.

1151
01:05:55,906 --> 01:05:56,839
Rym: Yeah, I guess there's two of us.

1152
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:57,482
Rym: So we would.

1153
01:05:57,964 --> 01:06:04,453
Rym: one of those pizzas is exactly dinner for two and it is way too much food for one person the pizza in particular.

1154
01:06:04,897 --> 01:06:10,078
Rym: but We started making pizzas again because we got the bread maker that'll like make the doughs.

1155
01:06:10,138 --> 01:06:10,620
Scott: I got a pizza.

1156
01:06:10,861 --> 01:06:11,764
Scott: I got a pizza stone.

1157
01:06:11,845 --> 01:06:14,856
Scott: So I just buy a dough at the bakery and then you know roll it out.

1158
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:19,500
Rym: Yep Uh, I think i'm gonna keep making pizzas because i'm feeling that it's like a ridge.

1159
01:06:19,781 --> 01:06:22,840
Rym: It's way less work than some of the like regular blue apron things we get lately.

1160
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,651
Scott: It's also cheaper than even delivering one.

1161
01:06:24,711 --> 01:06:25,315
Scott: It's way cheap.

1162
01:06:25,476 --> 01:06:30,260
Scott: a bag of dough It cost almost nothing a can of sauce cost almost nothing and a sack of cheese is like a dollar or two.

1163
01:06:30,702 --> 01:06:33,859
Rym: But I don't really feel like thinking back on what frozen pizza tastes like.

1164
01:06:34,764 --> 01:06:35,539
Rym: It's not good.

1165
01:06:36,665 --> 01:06:38,543
Scott: The thing is it's not good It's not the worst.

1166
01:06:38,563 --> 01:06:46,698
Rym: and then mcdonald's way and that in retrospect I feel like it's so full of salt and sugar That it's tricking my body into like enjoying it.

1167
01:06:46,759 --> 01:06:51,478
Scott: on this If you buy one of those like yeah, depending on the brand most likely that is exactly correct.

1168
01:06:51,659 --> 01:07:04,219
Rym: Yep It's kind of like how if i'm hungry Even though the thought of eating mcdonald's hamburger is like physically revolting to me if I smell it a little bit Part of my body says hell no and this other animal part of my body says yeah, you could eat that.

1169
01:07:04,844 --> 01:07:05,611
Rym: You should go eat that.

1170
01:07:05,874 --> 01:07:06,277
Rym: go eat it.

1171
01:07:07,025 --> 01:07:08,440
Scott: I mean pizza is basically bread.

1172
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:12,436
Scott: You know milk Salt and sugar anyway.

1173
01:07:12,456 --> 01:07:15,068
Rym: Yeah I should start putting msg on pizza.

1174
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:16,354
Scott: Yeah, it would taste great.

1175
01:07:16,394 --> 01:07:17,459
Rym: It tastes really great.

1176
01:07:18,642 --> 01:07:19,448
Rym: I'm real hungry.

1177
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:24,672
Scott: You've covered all the pizza related topics But i'm sure everyone in the world doesn't say about pizza because everyone eats.

1178
01:07:24,692 --> 01:07:26,257
Rym: almost every other anecdote I have.

1179
01:07:26,277 --> 01:07:30,079
Rym: is It relates to someone being picky when i'm trying to order pizza?

1180
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,943
Rym: Uh is that?

1181
01:07:32,003 --> 01:07:34,668
Rym: is there any other anecdote other than that cow bunga?

1182
01:07:34,928 --> 01:07:35,870
Scott: Yeah, I made it fun.

1183
