1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,827
Rym: It's Wednesday, June 1st, 2016.

2
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:11,068
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:14,496
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:16,560
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,060
Rym: The anime we've been watching.

6
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:19,598
Rym: It's anime day.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,457
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:29,920
Rym: Problem is, I could have watched a lot more anime, but one, I really got into the new Fargo TV show.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,172
Rym: A little late to the game there.

10
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:31,779
Rym: It was really good.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,980
Rym: And two, I watched a bunch of other anime, but more importantly, three, I've been playing a lot of Overwatch.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,620
Rym: It's actually pretty good.

13
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:42,019
Rym: Remember when Team Fortress 2 came out?

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:42,768
Rym: And we were like,

15
00:00:42,972 --> 00:00:43,340
Rym: "Yeah!".

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,437
Rym: And then we played it, and that night we were like,

17
00:00:45,457 --> 00:00:45,497
Rym: "Eh.".

18
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:48,317
Scott: It was more like, "Oh, I played it for a few

19
00:00:48,337 --> 00:00:48,539
Scott: weeks.".

20
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:52,500
Rym: I played it, but that night I was like, "Oh, this isn't what I wanted.

21
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:53,531
Rym: Okay,

22
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:53,860
Rym: whatever.".

23
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,579
Rym: And I played it for a few weeks and I just stopped.

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,720
Rym: Overwatch is only superficially similar to it.

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:19,019
Rym: I'm not going to review it now because it's Wednesday day, but it is way closer to Quake II Weapons Factory or Team Fortress than Team Fortress 2 ever got, which is interesting that this is the game that made it, but it's also got a... It's like every MOBA has the same set of characters and the same aesthetic now.

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,040
Rym: I think pretty much every eSport game that isn't video ball or Rocket League is going to look like this down the road.

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,699
Rym: It's kind of weird.

28
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:31,299
Rym: People still confuse this game with, what, Battleborn or that other game that doesn't look good?

29
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:33,179
Rym: That's actually a MOBA, I guess?

30
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:33,856
Scott: I don't know.

31
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,957
Rym: Anyway, people seem to be confusing the two, like non-gamers, because they have very similar style, even though they're completely different games.

32
00:01:41,424 --> 00:01:42,459
Rym: See, I've been playing a lot of that.

33
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:49,458
Rym: I guess if I had any more opening bits or anecdotes... Actually...

34
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:50,360
Scott: It's warm today.

35
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,800
Rym: Something funny happened.

36
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,259
Rym: A biking story today involving a Fixie.

37
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:54,607
Scott: Uh-oh.

38
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:55,759
Rym: But it's a new one.

39
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,200
Rym: This is something that's never happened to me before.

40
00:01:57,782 --> 00:02:03,219
Rym: So I'm biking and I pass this really slow guy on a Fixie and he's with his friend who's on a Fixie and also really slow.

41
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:05,380
Scott: Are you sure it was Fixies in that one speed?

42
00:02:06,703 --> 00:02:10,098
Rym: One of them, at least, was an actual Fixie, because I saw him coasting, sticking his legs up.

43
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:11,660
Rym: The pedals were still going.

44
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,214
Scott: Yep, okay.

45
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:13,520
Rym: I didn't confirm the other guy.

46
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,938
Rym: They had brakes, so I'll give them that.

47
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:17,079
Scott: Was this the one front brake?

48
00:02:18,627 --> 00:02:18,840
Rym: Maybe.

49
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,060
Rym: I mean, I didn't inspect their bikes that closely.

50
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,279
Rym: I'm not that obsessed.

51
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,599
Rym: But so I'm biking and I stop at the red light and they shoal and get in the way of traffic and run the red light and kind of puff past me.

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,779
Rym: And then I pass him every time the light turns green.

53
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,340
Rym: And eventually, I get to a red light and there's a bunch of traffic.

54
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,520
Rym: So even when they catch up to me, they can't just go through the light.

55
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:41,579
Rym: They just stand there.

56
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:52,199
Rym: And the one guy pulls up next to me and is just staring at my bike, like really staring at it, not even trying to hide the fact, like looking at it so intently.

57
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:56,559
Rym: And he keeps doing it for like 20 seconds or so.

58
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:57,959
Rym: So finally I just turn to him.

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,611
Rym: I'm like, "Can I help you?

60
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:00,075
Rym: What's

61
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:00,256
Rym: up?".

62
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,230
Rym: And he's like, "Where's the

63
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,693
Rym: battery?".

64
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:04,712
Rym: And I'm like, "What do you

65
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:05,097
Rym: mean?".

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,695
Rym: And he's like, "Well, how are you going so

67
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:07,040
Rym: fast?".

68
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:11,739
Rym: And I got to use the line that I've always wanted to be able to use on one of these kinds of people.

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,620
Rym: But I'm just biking.

70
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,680
Rym: I'm not going to stop and yell a retort.

71
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:16,680
Rym: I just keep going.

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,280
Rym: So I turn to him and I'm like, "I have gears.

73
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,299
Rym: That's how I go fast.

74
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:23,953
Rym: If you had gears, you could go

75
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:24,397
Rym: fast.".

76
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:25,695
Rym: And he's like, "There's no

77
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:25,960
Rym: way.".

78
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:26,920
Rym: And then the light turned green.

79
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,696
Rym: I never saw him again.

80
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:34,899
Rym: But the fact that he's just standing there, like staring at my bike.

81
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,140
Rym: It's one of those like, you know when a stranger does something a little bit weird.

82
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:41,838
Rym: and in New York your sense goes off of like, "Wait a minute.

83
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,160
Rym: That one's not acting like the rest of the herd.

84
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,548
Rym: Warning,

85
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:45,958
Rym: warning.".

86
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,899
Scott: I mean, even if you only had one, it's like bikes are leg-powered.

87
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:54,960
Scott: It's like he couldn't imagine there would be someone with better legs than him.

88
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,638
Scott: It's like, "Let me introduce you to professional

89
00:03:57,698 --> 00:03:57,920
Scott: cyclists.".

90
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,620
Rym: So, well, but the thing is even a professional cyclist.

91
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,600
Scott: That's like I'm playing basketball against Michael Jordan.

92
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,000
Scott: I'm like, "How did you score so many points?

93
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:10,820
Scott: Where's your performance-enhancing drugs?

94
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,278
Scott: Where are your drugs?

95
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:13,077
Scott: How did you do it?

96
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,280
Scott: There's no other way.

97
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,890
Scott: You could have done

98
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:14,992
Scott: it.".

99
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:17,519
Rym: But I think it's partly, it's not the high speed.

100
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,380
Rym: It's the acceleration.

101
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:18,641
Rym: Because

102
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:19,065
Scott: remember,

103
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:36,080
Rym: even a professional cyclist, if you're sitting at a dead stop on an uphill slope, that's a not insignificant slope, and someone who is way less athletic than you is starting at the exact same spot, but they have a real bike with gears, they will accelerate way faster than you.

104
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,880
Rym: You're going to pass them eventually because you have legs the size of my torso, but they're going to accelerate faster than you.

105
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,440
Rym: There is no way around that unless you snap your chain.

106
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,299
Rym: It was just an interesting moment because he was so fixated on it.

107
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,258
Rym: Fixated, fixie.

108
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,396
Rym: All right, there we go.

109
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:56,480
Rym: That wasn't intentional.

110
00:04:58,842 --> 00:04:59,900
Rym: That's what happened to me today.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
Rym: Got any news related to anime or comics or manga?

112
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:03,559
Scott: I do have news.

113
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:14,040
Scott: People always be complaining about PAX and the way it sells tickets, and Robert Koop did that interview where he pretty much gave the lowdown, which is the exact same lowdown we always gave.

114
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,692
Rym: It's like, "Kids, if you've been around the block, I know you're going to

115
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:18,259
Rym: conventions.".

116
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,039
Scott: This is how I do.

117
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:25,460
Rym: It's like never tried to buy tickets to a hockey game, never tried to get tickets to a popular concert.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,060
Rym: That shit is way harder than even these conventions you guys are so upset about.

119
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:34,619
Scott: Anyway, New York Comic Con, many conventions have tried different solutions, lotteries and things.

120
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:35,800
Scott: They all had their problems.

121
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:42,599
Scott: New York Comic Con is trying something new this year, and interestingly enough, it has some positive and some negative aspects.

122
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,254
Scott: It's actually not the worst idea.

123
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:49,240
Scott: It's not just awful, but I think overall it's still negative.

124
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,360
Rym: I will admit, I bristled at it just instinctively before I actually tried to figure it out.

125
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,614
Scott: I think it's still worth the bristle, but it's not 100% bad.

126
00:05:58,905 --> 00:05:59,169
Scott: It's 50% bad.

127
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:01,539
Rym: I bristle at almost anything.

128
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:03,760
Scott: Anyway, here's what they're doing.

129
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,720
Scott: They're doing fan verification.

130
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,659
Scott: Here's how this works.

131
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,300
Scott: First, you got to go to their website and make a profile.

132
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,239
Scott: Why do you do this?

133
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,480
Scott: So that they can collect all your personal information.

134
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,275
Rym: Hooray!

135
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:19,299
Scott: Also, I just learned that, like, um, that Reed -- Did you know who owns Reed?

136
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:21,058
Rym: Uh, I actually don't.

137
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,980
Scott: Reed is owned by an evil, evil company.

138
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,738
Rym: Which one?

139
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:25,840
Scott: Elsevier.

140
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:27,262
Rym: Oh!

141
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:27,323
Rym: Oh!

142
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:30,879
Rym: I know all about them.

143
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,540
Scott: Yeah, the people who refuse to open up their medical and scientific journals for freeness, right?

144
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,760
Rym: I've had recruiters from them.

145
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,199
Scott: I figured out it was from them.

146
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,240
Scott: The people who you could say murdered Aaron Schwartz indirectly.

147
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:46,860
Rym: I know all about that company.

148
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:50,220
Scott: Anyway, so they like to collect -- You know, they own LexisNexis and whatnot.

149
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:52,880
Scott: They want to collect your information and put it in a database.

150
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,039
Scott: So that's the worst part of this.

151
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,800
Scott: So anyone who wants a New York Comic Con ticket has to make a profile on their website so they can collect your personal information for their business purposes, right?

152
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:10,480
Scott: So then what they do is they're going to let you know if you have a profile that's been verified, they're going to let you know when tickets are going to go on sale.

153
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:11,719
Scott: Which is cool.

154
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:15,880
Scott: Alright, because now no scalpers are going to have profiles, right?

155
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:16,719
Scott: So it's no big deal.

156
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:21,060
Scott: Then all the ticket types will go on sale at the same time.

157
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:21,680
Scott: Also good.

158
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:24,380
Scott: They're not going to sell VIP tickets anymore.

159
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,138
Scott: Also good.

160
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,900
Scott: That's great.

161
00:07:26,702 --> 00:07:29,640
Rym: VIP tickets were one of the main problems I had with the New York Comic Con.

162
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,099
Scott: They're only going to sell tickets on their website and not in comic book stores like they used to.

163
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,195
Scott: Which, good and bad-ish, maybe.

164
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:36,740
Scott: Whatever.

165
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,160
Scott: It was kind of nice to be able to go to a comic store and get a ticket.

166
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:41,680
Rym: Well, yeah, except that didn't work anymore.

167
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,577
Rym: Because all that meant was you either stand in line outside of a comic book store that has like 10 tickets.

168
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:55,980
Scott: The thing is the comic book stores had a lot more than 10 tickets, like Midtown, and there were so many of them in the city that got tickets that you could actually pretty easily get them there.

169
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:58,160
Scott: People didn't know about this a lot.

170
00:07:58,362 --> 00:07:58,799
Rym: Well, that was it.

171
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,362
Rym: If you

172
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:12,319
Scott: needed a ticket late, I remember in past years comic book stores in the city were the only places that still had them and people just didn't know to go there and get them, which is, I guess, also why it's fine to just take that away from them.

173
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,560
Scott: Anyway, so then they're going to be sold first come, first serve basis.

174
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,299
Rym: So normal.

175
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:19,792
Scott: Normal.

176
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:30,840
Scott: And basically what happens is, is on the day they go on sale, you can log in and buy one ticket per person and for a certain number of friends.

177
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,198
Scott: So let's say me, Rym, and Emily all want to go.

178
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:34,919
Rym: We each have to make a profile.

179
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,299
Scott: We each have to make a profile.

180
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:36,794
Scott: Right.

181
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,020
Scott: And then one of us can buy three tickets.

182
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:48,039
Scott: And if it's a I guess I could buy three Fridays, three Saturdays and three Sundays because we have three profiles, even though I'm one person and I'm paying for all of them.

183
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:52,640
Scott: We need to have a profile for each individual human being going to the con.

184
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:56,759
Scott: And then I could buy the three tickets for the three profiles like that.

185
00:08:57,281 --> 00:09:00,740
Scott: So this should prevent scalping because a scalper wants to buy a lot of tickets.

186
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,719
Scott: I had to make a lot of profiles and they're not going to let you make that many.

187
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:08,000
Scott: But also they're just collecting information that everyone was going.

188
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:17,920
Scott: But also, I think the biggest problem with this, besides the collecting your information so blatantly, is they're selling a lot of tickets to this thing.

189
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,420
Scott: It's huge.

190
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:22,437
Scott: But only Internet people will know to do this.

191
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:23,880
Scott: Right.

192
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:25,619
Rym: That's what I was about to get to.

193
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:29,340
Scott: A lot of people go to New York Comic Con are not fans.

194
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:37,040
Rym: Guys, there are people who want to go to PAX who show up at PAX and don't understand that they can't buy a ticket to it.

195
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,720
Scott: Because I think they're going to have a problem selling out because people won't know to make profiles to buy a ticket.

196
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,100
Rym: I think enough people know to where it'll still sell out and a bunch of other people who wouldn't have gotten them anyway.

197
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:58,879
Rym: The same people who normally don't get them because they don't try to log on and buy them immediately are now going to think that they didn't get them because they didn't fill out this problem or whatever.

198
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,413
Rym: The same people won't get badges.

199
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:02,800
Rym: They'll be mad for a different reason.

200
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,263
Scott: I don't know.

201
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:11,160
Scott: I think that you're going to see also a harder core audience of people who know how to Internet and know how to check on these things so far in advance.

202
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:21,680
Rym: Which actually could be bad for New York Comic Con's business because New York Comic Con seems to thrive on getting kind of casual fans who are just going for one day to walk around and buy stuff.

203
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,735
Rym: That seems to be...

204
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:23,720
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

205
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,280
Rym: That's the kind of people they want there.

206
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:32,000
Scott: You're going to get less of the people that they actually want but they're going to get more information about the people who are there and maybe cater to them more.

207
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,645
Scott: I don't know.

208
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:43,520
Scott: This is still... I guess props for trying something and creative idea but I think that you should still just do it the PAX way.

209
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,599
Scott: I can't see this being any more successful than that.

210
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:49,753
Scott: Other than the money they make from collecting all the information maybe helps them more.

211
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:50,117
Scott: I don't know.

212
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:57,439
Rym: The only people who do not need profiles... For kids under 5, just get in for any one.

213
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,900
Rym: Kids aged between 6 and 12, there's two kinds of badges they can get.

214
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:05,300
Rym: They have to get an adult badge unless they go on Sunday.

215
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:07,120
Rym: then they get a slightly cheaper kids badge.

216
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,619
Rym: Kids aged 6 to 12 do not need a profile because Child Online Protection Act you're not allowed to collect that information about those kids.

217
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:16,559
Rym: I'm reading this now.

218
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:32,100
Rym: If you want to buy a badge for a kid aged 6 to 12 you'll still have to get the adult badge for Saturday and you just have to note that you're purchasing one or more of your tickets for a kid aged 6 to 12 and then you would sign them the ticket without them having a profile.

219
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:34,339
Rym: but supposedly it is just an adult ticket.

220
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:40,700
Rym: but "any New York Comic Con tickets assigned to kids will only be valid for kids aged 6 to 12 at the time of New York Comic Con.

221
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:42,696
Rym: this will be noted on their badge RFID".

222
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,400
Rym: and remember New York Comic Con is the only reason this all works.

223
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,560
Rym: because they're doing that bullshit.

224
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,160
Rym: You have to scan your badge to enter and exit the convention.

225
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:55,120
Scott: And they're going to have your personal information associated with your badge.

226
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,206
Rym: Yeah, and vendors.

227
00:11:56,226 --> 00:12:00,513
Rym: It's going to be like those bullshit vendor conferences where every vendor is like "Hey, you want the free thing?

228
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:02,957
Rym: Tap your badge and then we're going to spam you for the rest of your

229
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:03,200
Rym: life.".

230
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:10,820
Scott: I'm telling you, overall it's a negative but there is some interesting ideas here, right?

231
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,660
Scott: I think you could take part of these ideas.

232
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:16,000
Rym: Yeah, no tap-in, no badge-in, ever at a PAX.

233
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:22,460
Scott: You could do the PAX profiles but they could just be cool gamer profiles not collecting your info, right?

234
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,540
Rym: Actually, that would be a good idea.

235
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:33,859
Rym: Make your PAX profile and then actually, Penny Arcade is one of the few groups that would have the clout to go to game companies like Blizzard and say "Hey, integrate this with your system and Steam and

236
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,080
Rym: everything.".

237
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:36,900
Scott: Yeah, you could do some okay stuff with that.

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,340
Rym: I'm saying that's how Robert could take that and make it a pretty legit thing.

239
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:47,200
Scott: Do it nicely and also help integrate it with badge-getting to make it a little bit better, something like that, I don't know.

240
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:50,860
Rym: Yeah, but again, scalpers are not the problem.

241
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,180
Rym: Demand is the problem.

242
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:52,620
Scott: Correct.

243
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:54,820
Rym: And demand cannot be addressed.

244
00:12:55,243 --> 00:12:57,140
Rym: Now, it's interesting because demand was addressed for us.

245
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,539
Rym: Remember, we stopped going to the New York Comic-Con many years ago.

246
00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:00,920
Scott: I had free badges.

247
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,999
Scott: It's right fucking there.

248
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:09,820
Rym: Like, I used to get the professional badge every year and half the time I'd get the badge and literally not go because there's nothing to do or see there.

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,720
Scott: It's a giant conflict store, what do you need to go there for?

250
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,080
Rym: I mean, now the panels are all just like paid pro panels or whatever.

251
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:29,739
Rym: but I remember a time when I went to the actual New York Comic-Con and I went to where the panels were and I walked around with my camera videoing all these panel rooms with scheduled panels and panelists but literally no one was in these panels watching them.

252
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,060
Rym: It was people sitting in the front of the room, empty room, doing nothing.

253
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,820
Rym: It was just terrifying to behold.

254
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:47,759
Rym: But yeah, I guess if you want to go to New York Comic-Con, make sure you pay attention to this because, I mean, even small dumpy cons, it's like no one knows how to internet.

255
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,979
Rym: Like, there were people at PAX, right?

256
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,240
Rym: PAX East, the one that just happened, who knew that Markiplier was a guest somehow.

257
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:08,020
Rym: They knew that he was in a particular theater doing something, that he was in the Albatross Theater at some point during the convention and they showed up at the convention with a PAX badge which, remember, is very hard to get at PAX East.

258
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:20,700
Rym: so somehow, their whole family, they got PAX badges, they show up at PAX, there's a guest they want to see, they know he's at the con, they know what room his panel was in, they didn't know his panel was on Friday and he didn't have any panels on Saturday.

259
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:27,880
Rym: So those are the kinds of people who now have to navigate this system for the New York Comic-Con.

260
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:32,339
Rym: Those are the kinds of people who will fly to New York and then not have a badge.

261
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:37,380
Rym: And then buy one from all the friendly scalpers who I guarantee are still going to be out on the street.

262
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:50,220
Rym: So in other news, the internet was going crazy about this and I kind of don't want to talk about it so much as a sort of, there's an underlying problem way deeper than the thing that I'm about to talk about.

263
00:14:50,620 --> 00:15:05,719
Rym: So I'm sure you saw that Captain America is apparently a Nazi which, honestly, in terms of comic books, had you told me that, like years ago, 20 years ago, I would have just assumed, alright, sure, they'll undo it at some point.

264
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,207
Rym: He's probably dead at the end of that series or whatever because it's comic books.

265
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,580
Rym: You can't spoil comic books.

266
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:19,199
Scott: Also, I think it's kind of weird that everyone says he's a Nazi but I think the truth is that he's in Hydra which is a terrorist organization which isn't Nazis.

267
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:32,040
Rym: It is canonical through several avenues of Captain America comics that Hydra was actually the Nazis or that the Nazis were propped up by Hydra as part of a scheme.

268
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,980
Scott: I thought the Hydra was anti-Nazi but this shows you how comic books are so fucked up.

269
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,279
Scott: there's no one right answer to anything.

270
00:15:41,303 --> 00:15:44,020
Scott: The same way that Russians, you know, commies are anti-Nazi.

271
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:54,240
Rym: It's hard for me to be offended by this just because of the fact that Captain America is an ancient character that they're still making comics about for some reason and, I mean, how many times did they kill Superman or Batman or whatever?

272
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,180
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, I usually judge...

273
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,640
Rym: Like, clearly he's brainwashed or it's alternate reality or whatever nonsense is going to happen because that's how this goes.

274
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:11,737
Scott: I usually judge underwear pervert heroes, their quality, based on how many of the books focusing on them are worth reading and they're very... right?

275
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,700
Scott: It's like how many Captain America comic books are like top tier comic books?

276
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,080
Rym: I can only name a handful of top tier underwear pervert comics and most of them are one-offs.

277
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:21,881
Scott: Right.

278
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,700
Scott: Captain America, it's like there aren't a lot of great Captain America books.

279
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:26,174
Scott: It's like...

280
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,320
Rym: He punched Hitler that one time.

281
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,299
Scott: There's some Avengers stories, right, that are like, you know, pretty great that are like up there.

282
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,580
Rym: Yeah, but Cap's just part of it.

283
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,240
Scott: He's just... it's not like they focus on him a whole lot.

284
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,100
Scott: He's just sort of like... he's just there and he's usually just, you know, hitting things with his mighty shield and whatnot.

285
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:49,575
Scott: He's not really, you know... I mean, like, his story overall, like, oh, he was frozen in the ice and, you know, it's like, that's an okay story.

286
00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:50,200
Scott: It's okay.

287
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:54,378
Scott: But, like, the actual comic books containing that story, you don't need to read those.

288
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:58,480
Scott: They're not particularly amazing comic books of any kind.

289
00:16:59,063 --> 00:16:59,246
Scott: Right?

290
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:00,019
Scott: You can skip it.

291
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:08,650
Rym: So, the good thing that came out of this is the memes of, like, someone just drew a really great Steven Universe stand in there and he's like, "Hell

292
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,537
Rym: homeworld.".

293
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:11,520
Rym: The memes around this are great.

294
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:43,480
Rym: But the underlying issue is just that a lot of people were really mad about this and for the reason being, they're invested in this character and they're mad and deeply, like, they feel deeply about something that happened to a fictional character to the point that they will send death threats or that they somehow feel like because they're a big fan of a property, of someone else's property, that they somehow are entitled to have, like, input into how that property is treated.

295
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,960
Scott: This has been true for as long as comic books have been printed.

296
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,460
Scott: This is what's news here.

297
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:50,629
Rym: That's not news.

298
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,019
Rym: That's the underlying issue.

299
00:17:52,280 --> 00:18:02,699
Rym: And what's interesting is that finally, this time, multiple essays have been written and the sort of pop nerd culture is actually talking about that issue as a result of this.

300
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,339
Scott: That's not new either.

301
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:05,405
Rym: Yeah, it is.

302
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:07,060
Rym: People haven't really talked about it that much.

303
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,300
Scott: Talking about it for a long time.

304
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:12,440
Rym: Outside of some circles that we're in, that is not a common nerd theme.

305
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:19,858
Rym: Mostly the nerd theme is, "I am entitled to this character or this actor that I like who shouldn't be dating someone in the real

306
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:20,160
Rym: world.".

307
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,797
Scott: I mean, I was reading, like, you know, quote, "think pieces," you know, long ago.

308
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:25,577
Scott: Hot takes?

309
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,680
Scott: Yeah, hot takes in, like, the '90s that were like, "Hey, people aren't going to have wars about religion anymore.

310
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:36,457
Scott: They're going to be having wars about, like, you know, bands, like which band people are following and shit like

311
00:18:36,477 --> 00:18:36,678
Scott: that.".

312
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:40,820
Scott: And I think somebody referenced one of those things in one of these newer ones.

313
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,511
Scott: I'm like, "Oh, I remember reading

314
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:42,693
Scott: that.".

315
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:53,657
Rym: But I guess it's real hard for me to feel anything about this character because Captain America is so old and comic books are notorious for doing and undoing things so often that you could tell

316
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:53,979
Scott: me that,

317
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:57,655
Rym: "Oh, yeah, it turns out that literally every one of the Avengers is literally a

318
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:57,899
Rym: Nazi.".

319
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,639
Rym: And I would say, "Well, that had to happen at some

320
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:00,820
Rym: point.".

321
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:01,796
Scott: Right.

322
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:13,380
Scott: I think the, you know, the only part of it that I can sort of sympathize with the upset people, right, is that, like, let's say you're the kind of person who is, like, got the collecting part, right, in your brain.

323
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:15,400
Scott: You've got to buy them all, like Pokémon, right?

324
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,239
Scott: And every month, no matter what, you buy Captain America on, like, clockwork, right?

325
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,690
Scott: And that's your thing.

326
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,078
Scott: It's like you read it.

327
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:24,920
Scott: You know, you buy Spider-Man every month.

328
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,620
Scott: You just keep getting Spider-Man no matter what.

329
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,279
Rym: That's the monomaniacal fan whose identity is tied up in the thing they collect.

330
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,320
Scott: And every month you read this thing and you really like reading it, right?

331
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:45,060
Scott: But unlike, say, something like One Piece where you read it every month and it's always One Piece with the same creators, you know, and the same story going on, this Spider-Man, like, changes.

332
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,039
Scott: You've got a new writer.

333
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:48,640
Scott: You've got a new, you know, new story.

334
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:49,940
Scott: You've got a new character in there.

335
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,479
Scott: And, like, you've been buying it all this time because you liked it.

336
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:54,439
Scott: And now it changes.

337
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:55,640
Scott: And now you don't like it anymore.

338
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,820
Scott: And you're like, no, this thing that I was enjoying every month, like a routine, like when they changed the flavor of my fucking orange juice, right?

339
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,740
Rym: Or, like, you're into My Little Pony because of the comic.

340
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:06,540
Rym: And then Frank Miller takes over.

341
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:07,680
Scott: Right.

342
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,178
Scott: I mean, like, I remember, you know, I bought Spider-Man 2099 when I was a kid every month, right?

343
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:12,919
Scott: That was my book.

344
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:14,180
Scott: It's still a great book, by the way.

345
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,160
Scott: If you can get the old Spider-Man 2099, it's, like, super cyberpunk and amazing.

346
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:22,800
Scott: But there was one issue where, like, suddenly it was following this plot.

347
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:29,339
Scott: And then suddenly this one random issue, which I now realize today was, like, a filler issue because the real artists and writers couldn't get it in on time, right?

348
00:20:30,821 --> 00:20:34,820
Scott: Had, like, really bad art and a really weird story and had nothing to do.

349
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,500
Scott: It was like a side story that had nothing to do with the plot.

350
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:39,700
Scott: It was just, like, just random nothing.

351
00:20:39,842 --> 00:20:40,878
Scott: And I was like, what the fuck is this?

352
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:43,700
Scott: And I wrote in a letter because they always had those letters columns.

353
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,579
Scott: And there was some other letter in the back of the next issue that got back to the main story, the main artist, and the main writer again.

354
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,980
Scott: It looked a lot like my letter, only all the negatives are changed to positives.

355
00:20:57,926 --> 00:20:58,818
Scott: I don't know what was up with that.

356
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:00,671
Scott: But, yeah.

357
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,120
Rym: See, at least when you were in the Strong Bad emails, it was pretty much your email.

358
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,536
Scott: Mostly, yeah.

359
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,520
Scott: At least I'm -- but it didn't -- I didn't know if it was mine because, you know.

360
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:09,030
Scott: Yeah.

361
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:09,380
Scott: Anyway.

362
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:10,698
Scott: But, yeah.

363
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,520
Scott: You know, that's the only thing I can sympathize with.

364
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,160
Scott: Like, if you're into this thing, it's, like, your routine and someone changes it on you.

365
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:30,840
Rym: But at the same time, you can't ever be so monomaniacal about fictional media that a change to that media is actually physically devastating or mentally devastating to your well-being as a person.

366
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,198
Scott: Dude, you want to have some fun?

367
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:38,120
Scott: Go to all the websites of, like, all the metal magazines, right?

368
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,000
Scott: And, basically, all the metal magazines have been writing, like, constant articles about, like, baby metal every day.

369
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,424
Scott: Oh, dude.

370
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:45,139
Rym: I saw a bunch of that.

371
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:49,273
Rym: I remember Motorhead was like, "What the fuck have you done?

372
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,898
Rym: These girls are out there making

373
00:21:50,938 --> 00:21:51,179
Rym: metal.".

374
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:51,681
Scott: Right.

375
00:21:51,702 --> 00:21:53,089
Scott: All of the comments sections on those articles.

376
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,060
Scott: Because, basically, tons of people are reading these articles because they're all fans.

377
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,260
Scott: They're bringing the magazines and stuff, tons of money.

378
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:00,597
Scott: Yup.

379
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:02,019
Scott: And tons of eyeballs.

380
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,219
Scott: But all the comments sections are, like, the most, like, prototypical Internet flame wars.

381
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:10,516
Rym: Look, it came full circle.

382
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,280
Scott: Of pet ants and all of it's the greatest.

383
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:18,380
Rym: It came full circle with, you know, the Ghostbusters and the MRAs because, you know, there's the all-female Ghostbusters.

384
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:19,557
Scott: Same thing.

385
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,734
Rym: Dan Aykroyd tweeted the other day and he was like, "This movie is great.

386
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,159
Rym: Like, this might be better than the

387
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:25,420
Rym: originals.".

388
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:27,191
Scott: Even the drunk guy.

389
00:22:27,231 --> 00:22:28,340
Scott: Drunk old guy likes it.

390
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:34,160
Rym: But when the original cast is like, "This movie might be funnier than what we made before,".

391
00:22:34,782 --> 00:22:42,333
Rym: and the first response to that message was some MRI guy being like, "I guess you're shitting all over the originals with the fuck, man.

392
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:42,956
Scott: Ruining my...".

393
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:45,143
Scott: He's like, "Really, dude?

394
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:52,317
Rym: That's literally, like, that is literally the worst possible way to make your point to attack Dan Aykroyd about

395
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:53,279
Rym: Ghostbusters.".

396
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,180
Rym: I guess attacking Bill Murray about it is, like, the only way you could go worse.

397
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,030
Rym: Anyway, things of the day.

398
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,397
Rym: So, Scott, I'm curious.

399
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:08,430
Rym: Do you know how George Washington died?

400
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:10,570
Scott: I thought I did, but I guess I was wrong.

401
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,829
Rym: Yeah, so, because the other night I was talking to Emily and I was like, "You know how George Washington died,

402
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:16,030
Rym: right?".

403
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:20,166
Rym: And she's like, "Yeah, he got sick and, like, the doctors drained his blood and that killed

404
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:20,306
Rym: him.".

405
00:23:21,452 --> 00:23:21,676
Rym: What?

406
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:22,429
Scott: I never heard that.

407
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,920
Rym: That's apparently pretty common knowledge.

408
00:23:25,563 --> 00:23:26,990
Rym: You just thought he died of old age.

409
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:28,024
Scott: Yeah.

410
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,625
Rym: No, he died of old...

411
00:23:30,336 --> 00:23:31,029
Scott: Bad doctoring?

412
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:38,810
Rym: So, the story that most people seem to know, other than you, is that, you know, bloodletting was terrible practice because doctors sucked and he got sick.

413
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,670
Scott: I thought the bloodletting ended way before the times of George Washington.

414
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:43,499
Rym: So, you should watch this video.

415
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,710
Rym: It's a SciShow video, but Hank Green says it best.

416
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:53,950
Rym: If you're ever going to time travel, don't go to any time period before about 1940 because there wasn't medicine before then.

417
00:23:54,470 --> 00:24:04,670
Scott: Well, I know that medicine was shitty until, you know, early... I thought even 19... I mean, medicine... I know that medicine in 1940 was way better, but I figured we stopped bloodletting way before.

418
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:14,970
Rym: So, the high-level story that most people know is, you know, doctors drained his blood because, you know, doctors sucked back then and then that caused him to die and they kind of leave it at that.

419
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:24,830
Rym: The specifics of what happened, basically, between four and six doctors fucking murdered him when he basically had, at worst, the flu.

420
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,290
Scott: Well, the flu would fucking kill you in 1797.

421
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,910
Rym: He probably would have survived what was going on.

422
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:30,350
Scott: He was a tough motherfucker.

423
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,830
Rym: The worst disease he could have had...

424
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:35,870
Scott: Even the non-fictional George Washington was a tough motherfucker, right?

425
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:42,730
Rym: He might have had this particular fast onset swelling of something in your throat, but he more likely had a severe cold or a flu.

426
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,754
Rym: Probably would have been okay.

427
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:50,550
Rym: He got it because he was such a tough motherfucker that he was working out in the snow all day and then he was soaking wet.

428
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,430
Rym: He came inside and he didn't want to delay dinner, so he refused to change into dry clothes.

429
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,490
Rym: And then the next day, he had a sore throat and instead of staying in bed, he went outside and did the same thing again.

430
00:25:00,737 --> 00:25:00,987
Rym: Yeah.

431
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:02,650
Rym: Yeah, George Washington.

432
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,236
Scott: I mean, there's funny jokes like, "Aw,

433
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,337
Scott: man.".

434
00:25:07,331 --> 00:25:20,810
Rym: George Washington was probably the first known person for whom "I'm too old for this shit and I'm unwilling to deal with your shit" are probably like... He made those come into being in American culture.

435
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,650
Scott: Like the real George Washington, right?

436
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,450
Scott: He was like six feet tall plus and buff.

437
00:25:25,772 --> 00:25:26,649
Scott: He could fuck you up.

438
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,240
Scott: He was not a tiny person, right?

439
00:25:30,232 --> 00:25:32,745
Scott: I'm talking about the real George Washington.

440
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:34,884
Rym: Not the 40-foot radiation one.

441
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:35,992
Scott: Right, not that one.

442
00:25:36,032 --> 00:25:37,475
Scott: That's just an exaggeration, right?

443
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,520
Scott: The real one was a guy.

444
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,823
Rym: you were not going to fight with him, right?

445
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,840
Scott: It's like you could take on a lot of the other guys like Jefferson.

446
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,743
Scott: He's just like an old man.

447
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:49,610
Scott: You could knock him the fuck out, right?

448
00:25:50,052 --> 00:25:52,010
Scott: But you weren't going to mess with Washington, right?

449
00:25:53,192 --> 00:25:54,962
Rym: So here's what really happened to George Washington.

450
00:25:55,002 --> 00:25:56,390
Rym: He had this cold, basically.

451
00:25:57,413 --> 00:25:59,689
Rym: Doctors, of course, they did bloodletting right away.

452
00:26:01,591 --> 00:26:06,490
Rym: They fed him poison, which they made him vomit a whole bunch, which dehydrated him.

453
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:18,790
Rym: They burned his mouth and throat with acid because apparently that was an expected and common treatment for a sore throat is to fucking put acid in your throat and burn you severely.

454
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:22,070
Rym: And they were doing all this to try to balance his humors.

455
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:23,734
Rym: They drew his blood.

456
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:29,750
Rym: They drew such an amount of his blood that it is shocking he didn't die then and there.

457
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,870
Scott: Well, I mean, first of all, so badass, he's not going to die even if you take half his blood.

458
00:26:34,231 --> 00:26:37,930
Scott: And two, his heart is probably pumping so much blood, they started letting it, and he's like spraying it all over the fuck.

459
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:43,950
Rym: So they drained his blood, and then they decide that he's not getting better fast enough because they got his humors too far in one direction.

460
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,990
Rym: So they burned his fucking throat with acid, and then they decide that's not enough, so they make him vomit with poison.

461
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,513
Rym: Then they burn his throat again.

462
00:26:50,814 --> 00:26:52,558
Rym: They draw his blood again.

463
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:56,768
Rym: I think by the third time they drew his blood, and at this point they've taken like 20% of all his blood.

464
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:03,110
Rym: He started to get better for a period of maybe a few hours, and then he died.

465
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,353
Rym: So it's not just that.

466
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:07,498
Rym: doctors did bloodletting and then he died.

467
00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:13,150
Rym: It was a bunch of doctors poisoned him and drew and bled him to death because he had a cold.

468
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,695
Scott: Well, you know what this proves?

469
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,004
Scott: This proves who would win in a fight.

470
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:18,570
Scott: George Washington.

471
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:19,429
Rym: And anyone?

472
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,733
Scott: And Rasputin.

473
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:25,750
Scott: Rasputin would win because Rasputin got fucked up way more before he died.

474
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,990
Scott: And he laid there bleeding, but still alive.

475
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,739
Scott: Oh yeah, Rasputin took way more than that.

476
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,687
Scott: If they did that shit to Rasputin, he'd be like,

477
00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:33,088
Scott: "Aight.".

478
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:38,670
Rym: Yup, and now even though the end of Rasputin- Rasputin was also a giant butt fucker.

479
00:27:39,012 --> 00:27:42,870
Rym: The end of Rasputin, like the final end, was exaggerated almost definitely.

480
00:27:43,692 --> 00:27:48,250
Rym: But dude survived with probably a sucking lung wound and a chest wound.

481
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,009
Rym: Didn't he get shot with a gun?

482
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,370
Rym: The vague story I remember is they poisoned him, and he just wouldn't die from the poison.

483
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,070
Rym: So eventually the dude shot him a couple times, and then they just left the room.

484
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:01,769
Scott: Didn't they eventually have to dump him in the river to kill him?

485
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:05,490
Rym: Well, he was probably actually dead by the time they dumped him in the river.

486
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:06,069
Scott: Oh, okay.

487
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:06,754
Rym: Probably.

488
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:09,029
Rym: But the story is that he was still alive even then.

489
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,310
Scott: Well, we learned that he can take Washington.

490
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:11,794
Scott: Yup.

491
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,300
Scott: At least at that age, right?

492
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:14,390
Scott: The age at which they died.

493
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:15,465
Scott: Each one, right?

494
00:28:15,506 --> 00:28:15,670
Scott: Whatever.

495
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:21,810
Rym: After a controlled study, you gotta get a whole bunch of Washingtons, and a whole bunch of Rasputins, and then poison half of them.

496
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,184
Scott: The other thing is that Rasputin came way later, right?

497
00:28:25,546 --> 00:28:25,747
Scott: So...

498
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:32,370
Rym: Rasputin still right at the end of the era of the doctors would have killed him if they tried to save him.

499
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:34,270
Scott: I'm just saying, he came way later than Washington.

500
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:40,110
Rym: Yeah, but like Hank Green said, 1940 is your baseline for pre- and post-medicine existence.

501
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,755
Scott: Yeah, Rasputin was dead in 1940.

502
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:44,329
Scott: Already dead.

503
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,589
Rym: So you got a thing of the day for me?

504
00:28:45,831 --> 00:28:46,173
Scott: I do.

505
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:49,150
Scott: So there's this dude, he's I guess called the samurai guitarist.

506
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:54,367
Scott: And he's playing one of the great songs of all time, "Here Comes the Sun" by Los Beatles.

507
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,269
Rym: Real good song.

508
00:28:56,472 --> 00:28:56,928
Scott: Good song.

509
00:28:57,511 --> 00:28:58,818
Scott: And he starts playing the song at 5.24 AM.

510
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:04,590
Scott: You can see, because in the video of him playing the song, there's a clock in the bottom left corner.

511
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,282
Scott: And he finishes playing the song at around, oh, 5.50 something.

512
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,930
Scott: So it takes him a half hour to play this, you know, few minute song.

513
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,990
Scott: So he basically plays it real slow-like.

514
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,166
Scott: And you know, the song goes doo doo doo doo.

515
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,842
Scott: So he's like, doo, doo, doo.

516
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,857
Scott: You know, even slower than that, right?

517
00:29:26,877 --> 00:29:29,310
Scott: Because it takes him 30 minutes to play the song once on the guitar.

518
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:29,849
Rym: Yup.

519
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,350
Scott: And he videos himself playing the song over the course of 30 minutes.

520
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,033
Scott: Right?

521
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:35,110
Scott: With a clock in the corner.

522
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,370
Scott: And then what he'd do, be the work of genius.

523
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,062
Scott: Obviously he was doing this between 5.24 and 5.50 because the sun was coming up.

524
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,229
Scott: So it's, you know, the sun comes up as he's playing, right?

525
00:29:46,694 --> 00:29:47,129
Scott: Makes sense.

526
00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:50,449
Scott: He makes a little time lapse of the video.

527
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:51,414
Scott: Oooh.

528
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,670
Scott: So it sounds like he's playing normal.

529
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:55,229
Rym: And the sun's just coming up.

530
00:29:55,371 --> 00:29:56,110
Scott: And the sun's coming up.

531
00:29:56,615 --> 00:29:58,289
Scott: So he made an A+ internet video.

532
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:02,990
Scott: This is one of those things where it's like, I could have done that if I would have thought to do it.

533
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,815
Scott: But you didn't.

534
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,709
Scott: And that's why the Samurai Guitarist is better than you.

535
00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:08,060
Scott: So watch his video.

536
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:09,149
Scott: He deserves your view.

537
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,890
Rym: In the meantime, the Book Club book will be Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood.

538
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:16,290
Rym: Because I'm finally almost done with The Wheel of Time.

539
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:17,929
Rym: I just finished the 13th book.

540
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:19,949
Rym: And I know what's in that tower now.

541
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,269
Scott: Tell me what's in there.

542
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:21,572
Rym: No.

543
00:30:21,593 --> 00:30:22,229
Rym: Read the books.

544
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,349
Rym: I also know.

545
00:30:23,996 --> 00:30:24,489
Rym: Just tell me.

546
00:30:24,812 --> 00:30:26,989
Rym: I don't know fully what Luz Theron fucked up.

547
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,869
Rym: But I know mostly what he fucked up.

548
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:29,921
Rym: And I know where...

549
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,610
Scott: Luz Theron, as far as I know from reading only books four, was the man.

550
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:35,029
Rym: I know how the taint worked.

551
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,329
Rym: Like, I know that biz now.

552
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,409
Scott: It's between your legs.

553
00:30:38,151 --> 00:30:38,494
Rym: Yeah.

554
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,150
Rym: Well, it's also in your brain with spikes.

555
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,038
Scott: Okay.

556
00:30:42,512 --> 00:30:44,469
Rym: I know the deal with a lot of things.

557
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,568
Scott: Tell me all the things.

558
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,390
Rym: You know, the problem is, I wasn't going to read all The Wheel of Time.

559
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:50,730
Rym: I got to a point around book seven.

560
00:30:50,971 --> 00:30:52,670
Scott: Well, that was my Book Club pick, by the way.

561
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:52,776
Scott: Yeah.

562
00:30:53,453 --> 00:31:03,010
Rym: I'm going to read... Well, it's interesting because now that I've read it all, going back to The Prince of Nothing, I see where he drew tropes there as well.

563
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,809
Rym: Like, you can't just look...

564
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,690
Scott: Fantasy books have similar tropes, you don't say.

565
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:17,350
Rym: Yeah, but by focusing on the Tolkien tropes that are lifted, we've overlooked other tropes that didn't come from Tolkien-esque history of fantasy.

566
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:17,950
Scott: Okay.

567
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,749
Rym: But anyway, I'm going to finish the 14th book because I had to.

568
00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:25,990
Rym: And we're going to do a special podcast, me and Cahill White at PAX Prime, about the.

569
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,869
Scott: It's going to be great if this podcast doesn't happen.

570
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:28,788
Scott: You hyped it up so much.

571
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,710
Rym: It's going to happen because he was into it.

572
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:36,208
Rym: Believe me, when I tweet about The Wheel of Time, there are two people who respond to those tweets.

573
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,170
Rym: And 90% of the time, it's Summerando and Cahill.

574
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:40,630
Rym: All right.

575
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:41,830
Rym: He is into Wheel of Time.

576
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:49,450
Rym: In fact, after I said that The Prince of Nothing is The Wheel of Time, times... What did I say?

577
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,030
Rym: I said something.

578
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,050
Rym: But basically I was like, Prince of Nothing is the real mode version of Wheel of Time.

579
00:31:54,231 --> 00:31:56,810
Scott: I mean, every fantasy book is every other fantasy book.

580
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,290
Rym: Yeah.

581
00:31:57,611 --> 00:31:59,690
Rym: But I think he's going to read The Prince of Nothing now.

582
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,825
Rym: You didn't read it already?

583
00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:01,567
Scott: No.

584
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:06,129
Rym: A lot of people haven't read The Prince of Nothing because you start that stuff and it is dense.

585
00:32:06,697 --> 00:32:07,330
Rym: It is brutal.

586
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,330
Rym: It makes the Game of Thrones look like a children's story.

587
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,704
Scott: Game of Thrones is a children's story.

588
00:32:14,736 --> 00:32:15,630
Scott: So is Wheel of Time.

589
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,789
Rym: ConnectiCon's coming up.

590
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:18,249
Rym: We'll be doing a bunch of shows there.

591
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:21,290
Rym: We're also rapidly scheduling the panels.

592
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,090
Rym: I cannot tell you when the panel schedule will appear on the website.

593
00:32:24,493 --> 00:32:25,569
Rym: I have no control over that.

594
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:33,450
Rym: But I have scheduled about three quarters of the convention and someone else is emailing people who have panels scheduled.

595
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,490
Rym: If you didn't get an email yet, it doesn't mean I didn't schedule you yet.

596
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:42,769
Rym: It just means there's a lot of follow up to do because there's a lot of manual processes this year for reasons I have no control over.

597
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:43,968
Rym: So stay tuned.

598
00:32:45,511 --> 00:32:47,169
Rym: Otherwise, PAX Prime is coming up.

599
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:47,787
Rym: We'll be there.

600
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:48,504
Rym: PAX Dev.

601
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,628
Rym: I'll be there at least.

602
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:52,330
Rym: And yeah.

603
00:32:53,153 --> 00:32:53,728
Rym: Any other stuff?

604
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:54,927
Scott: Patreon's going.

605
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,430
Rym: Still selling t-shirts.

606
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,790
Scott: I got a bunch of video equipment.

607
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:01,869
Scott: I'm going to make a whole bunch of videos that are free on YouTube soon.

608
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,770
Scott: Streaming and also not streaming.

609
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,930
Rym: The third game, you know, we've been doing our Civ series.

610
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:13,569
Rym: The problem is I can't upload videos from a game until the game's over because I can't reveal information to Scott and vice versa.

611
00:33:14,351 --> 00:33:17,910
Rym: But the third series, pretty interesting shit's going down.

612
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,950
Rym: I actually can't wait to see what Scott saw over the course of this game.

613
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:24,669
Scott: I saw your pike man to the north of me.

614
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,450
Rym: Oh, that's actually, I don't have a pike man.

615
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,109
Scott: Yeah, you do.

616
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:28,724
Scott: No, I don't.

617
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:30,509
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's a pike man.

618
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:31,749
Rym: No, it's a sword man.

619
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,490
Scott: Oh, I guess he's standing next to the pike.

620
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,089
Rym: The city state has a pike man.

621
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:38,069
Scott: Oh, is that who that belongs to?

622
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:38,428
Scott: Yeah.

623
00:33:38,711 --> 00:33:40,550
Rym: That's not the city state I'm allied with either.

624
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:48,287
Rym: So all the city states that declared war on you are actually on the other side of me and literally can't interact with you.

625
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:52,926
Rym: So I like the two that are next to you that I wanted to declare war on.

626
00:33:52,946 --> 00:33:54,990
Rym: you have quests that are literally impossible.

627
00:33:55,873 --> 00:33:57,830
Rym: One of them is like, give me some marble.

628
00:33:58,011 --> 00:34:00,270
Rym: And the only marble on the map is like next to your capital.

629
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,669
Scott: Yeah, it's my marble and they're not asking for it.

630
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,570
Rym: Yeah, they're asking for it from me and I can't give it to them.

631
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,770
Scott: Yeah, I would give them the marble.

632
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,250
Scott: No problem.

633
00:34:07,552 --> 00:34:10,530
Rym: Yeah, they're like, we need to get some marble room marble.

634
00:34:11,851 --> 00:34:15,010
Scott: Yeah, I built my game around that marble and my plan went according to plan.

635
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,909
Scott: But basically I learned that in a dual military is all that matters and nothing else really does.

636
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,549
Rym: Thing is, I can't take Scott out.

637
00:34:23,074 --> 00:34:23,808
Rym: I know I can't do.

638
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,688
Scott: No, I got my Babylonian walls.

639
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:26,467
Scott: Come and bring it.

640
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:29,750
Rym: Not only that, but you're one era ahead of me science wise.

641
00:34:30,071 --> 00:34:35,648
Rym: And one of the things that you might not know is that city defense is heavily influenced by what era you reach.

642
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:36,030
Scott: Right.

643
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,263
Scott: But you think I think if you brought your whole military to bear, I can't.

644
00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:44,929
Scott: I can't exert my force on anything right now, not even barbarians, because I don't have enough force.

645
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,310
Rym: There are so many goddamn barbarians.

646
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:50,869
Scott: And I don't I know and I don't have enough money to to get more.

647
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,489
Scott: I could build more military easily.

648
00:34:52,773 --> 00:34:54,230
Scott: I just don't have money to pay for it.

649
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:55,010
Rym: Scott, you need some money.

650
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,069
Rym: I'll give you money for your marble.

651
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,030
Scott: No, not for the marble.

652
00:35:00,751 --> 00:35:04,530
Scott: So it's like if I could just get some fucking money, I would be actually like really good.

653
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,989
Scott: But there's nowhere I can send a caravan safely.

654
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,870
Scott: I can't caravan.

655
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,470
Rym: There's one place you could, but not for long.

656
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:13,690
Scott: Yeah, I can't caravan basically.

657
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,890
Rym: I only have one caravan and I only made that caravan because the city state asked for it.

658
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:24,630
Scott: This is why China was so good when I played it, because you get two money from your library and that I'm actually at like minus two money.

659
00:35:24,693 --> 00:35:24,966
Scott: Exactly.

660
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,570
Scott: Like it's like, oh, I just was China.

661
00:35:27,732 --> 00:35:28,928
Scott: I would be so good right now.

662
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:33,169
Rym: Well, even worse in the big Civ game, the worst fucking thing happened to me.

663
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,649
Rym: I might declare war on Chris and Egypt because of it.

664
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:37,450
Rym: So there's a bunch of wonders.

665
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,170
Rym: You know the wonders like no one builds like Chichen Itza or whatever, just hanging out.

666
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:40,669
Scott: That's a good one.

667
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:41,869
Rym: It is a good one, but no one built it.

668
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,930
Rym: It's a bunch of wonders no one built.

669
00:35:43,552 --> 00:35:45,589
Rym: I had a great engineer and I was like, you know what?

670
00:35:46,551 --> 00:35:50,370
Rym: I'm just going to in one turn build Chichen Itza.

671
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:51,448
Scott: He built it under you.

672
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,848
Rym: He literally had been working on it for a while and finished it.

673
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:55,909
Rym: The turn.

674
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:57,430
Rym: I used my great engineer.

675
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,630
Scott: It's that early in the game.

676
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,589
Scott: Why don't you use your great engineer to make the factory?

677
00:36:02,614 --> 00:36:04,270
Rym: The factory is not available yet.

678
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,088
Scott: The manufactory.

679
00:36:05,652 --> 00:36:06,408
Rym: The manufactory?

680
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,729
Scott: The thing he builds on the terrain.

681
00:36:09,652 --> 00:36:13,774
Rym: Oh, so I am more ties that over the hammers in terms of how long I think the game will go.

682
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,101
Rym: Probably not worth it.

683
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:18,550
Scott: If it's early in the game, I would build that.

684
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:26,330
Rym: I will do that with the science one or the money one, but very rarely will I build the manufactory because instead I'll just mine all the hills I got around.

685
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:28,261
Rym: But anyway, I digress.

686
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:30,687
Scott: All right.

687
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:37,630
Rym: So Scott told me to watch a bunch of anime and I told him to watch a bunch of anime and neither one of us watched the anime that the other one watch, except I think we both watched Sakamoto.

688
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:38,233
Scott: Oh, OK.

689
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:40,650
Scott: But why didn't you watch any of the things I told you to watch?

690
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,230
Rym: I didn't watch... Chichen Daisuke is only 50 minutes long.

691
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,049
Scott: That's been around for a long time.

692
00:36:46,212 --> 00:36:46,302
Rym: Yeah.

693
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,870
Rym: And it's going to not be on Hulu like tomorrow.

694
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,730
Scott: But there's plenty of ways to watch it without Hulu.

695
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,464
Scott: Name one.

696
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:53,766
Scott: BitTorrent.

697
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:54,910
Rym: He's going to pirate.

698
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:57,070
Rym: It's getting harder unless you really know where to go.

699
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,090
Rym: I mean, I could pirate it, obviously, but most people probably couldn't without going.

700
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,869
Scott: It's not my problem.

701
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,190
Rym: More and more people I see are pirating stuff by going to those shady...

702
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:09,810
Scott: Also, as many animes, people are like panicking because all the anime are removed from Hulu.

703
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,290
Rym: It's all like Saber, Marionette, J.

704
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:19,949
Scott: I have a bunch of anime in my queue on Hulu, and I only got an email from Hulu saying that one of them was being removed, which is the second season of Mushishi, which is like, all right.

705
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,210
Rym: Scott, you don't understand.

706
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,370
Rym: It is Lupin's season because we went back and finished Fuji Go Mine.

707
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:27,070
Scott: I like me a Lupin, but I'm not in Lupin mood right now.

708
00:37:27,657 --> 00:37:28,710
Rym: But this is a new Lupin.

709
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:36,840
Rym: This blue-shirted Lupin that we're seeing in Fuji Go Mine and now in Jigendaisuke is, it's a way to do Lupin.

710
00:37:37,202 --> 00:37:38,650
Rym: that I think is making Lupin.

711
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,990
Rym: Lupin's going to be big again, like real big.

712
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,510
Scott: I mean, it's probably good, but I don't need to watch it right now.

713
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,209
Scott: It's not going anywhere.

714
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,109
Rym: But it's so good.

715
00:37:46,574 --> 00:37:47,248
Rym: Just watch it.

716
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:48,709
Rym: We could do a whole show on it.

717
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,068
Rym: What's my hurry?

718
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,129
Rym: It's a whole Wednesday show.

719
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,710
Scott: We could have done many Wednesday shows if you were to watch the four anime that I'm watching.

720
00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:01,890
Rym: I watched way more minutes of anime than I did, and we could have done a whole show just on that 51 minutes of anime.

721
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:03,070
Scott: Yeah.

722
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,250
Scott: Well, you told me to watch it way too late.

723
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,949
Scott: I told you to watch this shit way long ago.

724
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,283
Scott: Yeah.

725
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,270
Rym: The problem has been playing Overwatch and watching Fargo.

726
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:13,570
Rym: We can do a show on Fargo if you watch it.

727
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,809
Scott: It's really, really good.

728
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:15,321
Scott: Yeah.

729
00:38:15,874 --> 00:38:16,410
Rym: It's Coen Brothers.

730
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,550
Rym: It's not like a spinoff.

731
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:21,650
Rym: It's Coen Brothers made more stories like Fargo and they made it as a serial.

732
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:22,210
Rym: It's great.

733
00:38:22,472 --> 00:38:22,829
Scott: Don't care.

734
00:38:23,543 --> 00:38:23,890
Rym: All right.

735
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,788
Rym: Guess you don't like things.

736
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:32,190
Rym: So tell what's one of these animes I should have watched that I didn't other than Sakamoto because the first one you got to watch is Space Patrol Luluco.

737
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,364
Scott: That is the show, right?

738
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:38,450
Scott: So Trigger basically is sort of working on two shows this season, right?

739
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,530
Scott: Space Patrol Luluco and Kizniver.

740
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:46,350
Scott: And basically imagine Kill La Kill, the center of all the Trigger universe, right?

741
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:56,130
Scott: And now split it into two parts, the zany part, which is the part of the reason you like Trigger and the normal anime part.

742
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:03,569
Scott: And the normal anime part became Kizniver and Space Patrol Luluco is like, it's like Inferno Cop distilled.

743
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:05,530
Scott: Inferno Cop's even in it.

744
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,824
Rym: Inferno Cop is already vodka.

745
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,049
Rym: It's already distilled.

746
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:10,808
Rym: So what's this?

747
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:11,668
Scott: Just fucking moonshine.

748
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,689
Scott: It's just fucking moonshine.

749
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,230
Rym: It's just crystal meth dissolved.

750
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:19,430
Scott: So the story, Space Patrol Luluco isn't even a full TV series.

751
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:24,126
Scott: It's short episodes like fucking Tamagotobutsu where the opener and the closer is longer than the show.

752
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:30,750
Rym: It's interesting because if I look at my Twitter feed, the Kizniver is getting like 80% of all the anime love I'm seeing.

753
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,099
Scott: I watched one episode.

754
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,150
Scott: I don't need to watch anymore.

755
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,249
Rym: My Twitter feed loves it.

756
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,690
Scott: But anyway, the Space Patrol Luluco, right?

757
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:49,850
Scott: So the story is there's a crazy town, which is a lot like sort of like the Men in Black alien town where it's like just all kinds of crossroads of the galaxy kind of place.

758
00:39:50,657 --> 00:39:51,330
Scott: And it's crazy.

759
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:57,130
Scott: And there's a girl who lives there and she's normal and she wants things to be normal, but she lives in a crazy town and it's crazy.

760
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,667
Scott: So her dad is in the Space Patrol and he's like the awesomest Space Patrol dude.

761
00:40:01,572 --> 00:40:03,430
Scott: He's pretty much dad from Kill La Kill.

762
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:07,250
Scott: But he's in the Space Patrol and he's like the hero of the Space Patrol.

763
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,370
Scott: The chief of the Space Patrol is Inferno Cop.

764
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:11,550
Scott: Anyway.

765
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:14,090
Rym: Oh, it is just Inferno Cop, but he's wearing those sunglasses.

766
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,406
Scott: Yes, it's Inferno Cop.

767
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:16,704
Scott: Anyway.

768
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,790
Scott: And the main girl is basically, um, what's her name?

769
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:22,390
Scott: From Kill La Kill.

770
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,089
Rym: You forgot the names of every single character in Kill La Kill, didn't you?

771
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:25,485
Scott: Yes.

772
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:26,810
Rym: Every character?

773
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:28,327
Scott: Yes.

774
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,009
Scott: Yes.

775
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:31,768
Scott: All of them.

776
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,248
Scott: Anyway.

777
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:36,308
Scott: Is it Maho?

778
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:36,865
Scott: Whatever.

779
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:37,405
Scott: Is that her name?

780
00:40:38,433 --> 00:40:39,069
Scott: The crazy one.

781
00:40:39,534 --> 00:40:39,790
Rym: Yup.

782
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:40,409
Scott: Anyway.

783
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,429
Scott: It's basically her.

784
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:48,808
Scott: And basically dad gets fucked up, uh, through like his body gets frozen and his only- Like Han Solo style?

785
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:49,748
Scott: In ice.

786
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,050
Scott: But yeah, his brain is like, the slice of his brain is the only thing left or whatever.

787
00:40:54,212 --> 00:40:58,510
Scott: And so this girl joins the Space Patrol and has to deal with Space Patrol nonsense.

788
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:06,390
Scott: And he gets crazy go nuts and they go to Kill La Kill planet and they go to, right, you know, they go to Little Witch Academia planet.

789
00:41:07,012 --> 00:41:11,270
Scott: It just goes, the show is out of control, zaniness that you need in your anime life.

790
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:12,630
Scott: And it's short episodes.

791
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,070
Scott: You can watch the whole thing, right?

792
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,050
Scott: And you know, all the episodes that are out so far.

793
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:27,310
Scott: And it's funny cause like you watch three episodes and like the fourth episode would be like, season two, episode one, it's like it's seasons, but there's only been like seven or eight episodes so far, but it's already the third season just ended.

794
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:33,210
Rym: I can just squeeze it in then because it's, it's, there's very low barrier to entry to watch a show like that.

795
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,430
Rym: Like Inferno Cop, like once you turn it on, you're like, oh, okay.

796
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:35,555
Rym: Yeah.

797
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:36,910
Scott: You can watch this whole thing.

798
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:38,387
Scott: Like by the time I leave here.

799
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:42,370
Rym: Cause Sakamoto is kind of like though, it kind of just keeps going, just like, well, Sakamoto shoots.

800
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,270
Scott: So Sakamoto I watched because the trailer was so epic, right?

801
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:52,070
Rym: And Sakamoto, while good, is not what I, you don't get any more out of it by watching it than by just reading the manga.

802
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:52,989
Scott: Oh, okay.

803
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,850
Scott: So the manga I think is even worse than the anime.

804
00:41:56,071 --> 00:42:00,130
Scott: So Sakamoto gives me that feel that I get from like, I was a manga dio, right?

805
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:05,209
Scott: With the way the school feels, there's a cast of characters in the school and the sort of pacing and the way it's edited.

806
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:13,989
Scott: But also sort of like Cromartie, but less crazy than Cromartie, but still Cromartie cause you got thuggish bully kid, you know, kind of action going on.

807
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:23,329
Rym: It's like Cromartie, but there's only one, like there aren't like there's like in Cromartie, everyone except the main guy has some crazy thing going on and this is pretty much just Sakamoto.

808
00:42:23,863 --> 00:42:24,010
Scott: Yeah.

809
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,727
Rym: Pretty much like everyone else is normal-ish.

810
00:42:27,794 --> 00:42:35,110
Scott: Um, the, uh, you know, as a little bit of the zaniness of like, uh, you know, the Nichijou kind of action.

811
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:35,290
Scott: Right.

812
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:39,890
Scott: But anyway, so Sakamoto, it is what it says it was about, right?

813
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:46,050
Scott: It's about this kid who's like, you know, super good at everything, but he's also kind of weird.

814
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,430
Scott: Like he's like, I'm thinking there's some plot to it.

815
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,090
Scott: Like he's alien.

816
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,745
Scott: He's gotta be like, he's an alien or he's a bird cause he's always hanging out with birds and stuff.

817
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,029
Rym: He's an alien bird alien.

818
00:42:54,611 --> 00:42:56,490
Scott: He's like an alien to investigate high schools.

819
00:42:56,811 --> 00:43:00,270
Scott: There's something going on there that's kind of weird and sort of offsetting.

820
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,129
Scott: He's not just like this hero that you root for.

821
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:08,690
Scott: He's just sort of like this strange character who just coincidentally is bad-ass at everything somehow.

822
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,170
Scott: It's like, what's up with that?

823
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:17,050
Scott: And it's, you know, so the feel that you get, the vibe that comes from it isn't exactly the vibe that I got from the trailer.

824
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:17,666
Rym: Yeah.

825
00:43:18,652 --> 00:43:21,030
Rym: Uh, you're expecting more like initial D style.

826
00:43:21,091 --> 00:43:22,409
Rym: Like he just wins all the time.

827
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:22,947
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

828
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:24,388
Rym: And there's nothing wrong with it.

829
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:31,970
Scott: And then in the manga, the thing with the manga is basically the same exact material and you can actually digest it much faster if you read the manga.

830
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:36,810
Scott: But the manga, it's like the, it's really compressed compared to the anime.

831
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:40,070
Rym: Which I kind of like cause the anime just feels sort of drawn out.

832
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,730
Scott: No, I kind of liked that it's drawn out cause then you can actually get the feel of the whole situation.

833
00:43:45,071 --> 00:43:49,490
Scott: When you compress it, it's like the timing of the jokes are just off and they're not funny at all.

834
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,148
Rym: You know what it might be?

835
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,630
Rym: I actually read a bunch of the manga before I went back and watched the anime.

836
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,729
Rym: I feel like you got to pick one of the two.

837
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:57,789
Scott: I did the reverse.

838
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:58,826
Rym: That's it.

839
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:03,503
Rym: You got whichever one you do, if you do the manga or the anime, the other one is worthless to you.

840
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:04,110
Scott: Maybe.

841
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,470
Scott: But yeah, uh, I prefer the anime.

842
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:09,609
Scott: I'm not going to buy any more of the manga and I'll just keep watching it.

843
00:44:11,012 --> 00:44:13,970
Scott: But it's not, it's, it's worth watching, but it's not like must watch.

844
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:18,986
Scott: You could just, if you haven't seen, say, Ozamanga Daioh or Cromartie, you should go there first.

845
00:44:19,572 --> 00:44:24,249
Rym: So the anime that I watched and Emily watched it with me was, and we watched the entire thing.

846
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,248
Scott: How many episodes is it?

847
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:25,945
Rym: Uh, eight.

848
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:28,409
Rym: Oh no, eight volumes, 12 episodes of anime.

849
00:44:28,592 --> 00:44:29,129
Scott: So it's not bad.

850
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:29,610
Rym: Half season.

851
00:44:30,061 --> 00:44:30,229
Rym: Okay.

852
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,670
Rym: You could burn through it actually.

853
00:44:31,851 --> 00:44:34,450
Rym: Cause it's very, it's, it's, it just moves quickly.

854
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:39,349
Rym: So we actually reviewed it fully on the Patreon, but basically it's called erased.

855
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:41,129
Scott: and isn't that an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie?

856
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:42,410
Rym: That's eraser.

857
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,630
Rym: You're thinking of what's the difference a lot.

858
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:49,230
Rym: This doesn't have sub supersonic bullets in quotes.

859
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:49,929
Rym: Was that eraser?

860
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:56,688
Rym: I think eraser had these supersonic bullets like night arrows, but this thing ended in March.

861
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:58,489
Rym: Like it's a recent anime and it's all just out.

862
00:44:58,931 --> 00:45:03,750
Rym: But the story is basically there's a kid and he has his normal life.

863
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:04,390
Rym: He's kind of a loser.

864
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:04,968
Rym: Like he's our age.

865
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:05,428
Rym: He's a loser.

866
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:06,530
Rym: Not like a loser.

867
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:10,070
Rym: Like he sucks, but like he's got kind of a dead end job and he's just living his life.

868
00:45:10,151 --> 00:45:12,330
Rym: and he's kind of an artist, like a failed manga artist or whatever.

869
00:45:13,034 --> 00:45:14,190
Rym: But he has a superpower.

870
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:20,929
Rym: No one else seems to have a superpower where sometimes he'll just see a butterfly go by and then suddenly deja vu.

871
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:25,910
Rym: He goes back in time like a couple of minutes and something's wrong.

872
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,130
Rym: Like that was a moment where something that was going to go bad could be fixed.

873
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:35,909
Rym: So like he's riding his little scooter and then suddenly he sees the butterflies and he backs up.

874
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,669
Rym: She's like, Oh shit.

875
00:45:37,032 --> 00:45:37,930
Rym: So now he's paying attention.

876
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:38,830
Rym: Like what's weird.

877
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:40,150
Rym: What's out of place.

878
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:48,149
Rym: And then he notices that the truck that was next to him, the driver is literally just like passed out and the truck's just like careening down the road, which he didn't notice before.

879
00:45:49,735 --> 00:45:50,909
Rym: So that's like the setup.

880
00:45:51,731 --> 00:46:01,450
Rym: And then some crazy Phoenix Wright shit goes down and he goes back in time after being reminded about a bunch of murders that happened when he was a kid.

881
00:46:02,272 --> 00:46:05,869
Rym: And he goes back in time all the way to when he was in grade school.

882
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:10,030
Scott: And but he still has his adult mind, all his adult memories, all his adult mind.

883
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:17,230
Rym: And he's back in time and he has the, like, you know, think about how fuzzy your memories are of like third or fourth or fifth grade.

884
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:17,670
Scott: Yeah.

885
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:23,770
Rym: So he wakes up in his body in that, like in that era, kid body, adult body, kid body.

886
00:46:24,192 --> 00:46:29,788
Rym: But he has the adult memories of, wait a minute, some people I kind of knew got like kidnapped and murdered.

887
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:31,449
Scott: I get some good grades, man.

888
00:46:32,054 --> 00:46:32,610
Rym: Uh, yeah.

889
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:43,829
Rym: He basically doesn't give a shit about school, but, and he remembers specifically this one girl who he didn't know, but he kind of remembered like the, like these kids looks like a serial killer murdered these kids.

890
00:46:44,452 --> 00:46:48,250
Rym: And like the parents and adults tried to like hush it up so the kids wouldn't be traumatized.

891
00:46:48,611 --> 00:46:54,148
Rym: But he remembers that like right before the girl got murdered, he remembers seeing her alone in the park.

892
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:57,970
Rym: So he makes it his mission to prevent the serial killings.

893
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:03,350
Rym: And holy shit does this show go off the rails in a really good way.

894
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,390
Scott: Like you think he is the serial killer.

895
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,148
Scott: I figured it all out.

896
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:13,670
Rym: Uh, watch your show, but it's one of those shows that pretty much every episode ends.

897
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,309
Rym: So Scott, here's how to make it a little bit crazier.

898
00:47:17,052 --> 00:47:27,187
Rym: In English, the official name of the show is erased, but the actual Japanese name of the show is the guy, the main character is the serial killer is the town where only I am missing.

899
00:47:28,371 --> 00:47:41,970
Rym: And that's the name of a short story that a character wrote when that character was a kid about how the world would have been better if that character didn't exist or didn't exist in the place they existed because he wouldn't have killed that girl.

900
00:47:43,857 --> 00:47:44,809
Rym: This the watch your show.

901
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,990
Rym: The show is not what you think, except I'm right.

902
00:47:47,271 --> 00:47:47,608
Rym: No, you're not.

903
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,841
Rym: Yeah.

904
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,467
Rym: Now watch your show.

905
00:47:50,592 --> 00:47:53,310
Rym: The show is crazy good though.

906
00:47:53,553 --> 00:47:55,010
Rym: And it's only 12 episodes long.

907
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:56,670
Rym: Every episode ends on a cliffhanger.

908
00:47:57,052 --> 00:48:00,189
Rym: And every time you think, all right, I know what's going on.

909
00:48:00,471 --> 00:48:04,606
Rym: Some Phoenix Wright crap happens, then you're like, well, I was 100% wrong.

910
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,569
Rym: And it, it, it's just really good.

911
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:09,690
Rym: It's amazing.

912
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:11,970
Rym: Once you watch a couple episodes, you're just going to watch the whole thing.

913
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:13,126
Rym: Like you can't stop yourself.

914
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:15,950
Rym: Watch anything else?

915
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:16,244
Scott: I did.

916
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:16,947
Scott: I watched a lot of stuff.

917
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:21,729
Scott: So I watched this, but you remember there was that one about like the people on the bus that go to lost village.

918
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:25,010
Rym: The one that we had a vague Bocurano-esque feeling about.

919
00:48:25,393 --> 00:48:25,768
Scott: That one.

920
00:48:25,994 --> 00:48:26,709
Scott: So I watched that.

921
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,269
Scott: I've watched every episode so far.

922
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,889
Scott: It's not the greatest thing ever, but it's pretty good.

923
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:38,840
Scott: And it sort of has this balance where like, they're not telling you enough of the mystery, but they do tell you enough of the mystery.

924
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:44,829
Scott: at the same time where it's like, you're not telling enough, but you're telling enough that you're not jerking me around.

925
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:45,610
Scott: Right.

926
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:46,387
Rym: All right.

927
00:48:46,711 --> 00:48:56,730
Scott: And basically it's, it's exactly, you know, a bunch of characters get on a bus and the main problem I have with the show is the characters in that a lot of them are kind of zany, right?

928
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:08,250
Scott: There's like guy who dresses up like a pirate and thinks he's a pirate and this girl who's like an who's thinks she's an idol and basically is constantly yelling, like, "Execute everybody!

929
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,410
Scott: Oh my God, execute everybody!

930
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:09,887
Scott: Kill them!

931
00:49:10,052 --> 00:49:10,195
Scott: Oh my

932
00:49:10,257 --> 00:49:10,544
Scott: God!".

933
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:10,921
Scott: Right?

934
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:11,270
Scott: Yeah.

935
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:20,147
Rym: Because while they're not similar, except in our superficial look at one screenshot in Bocurano, the characters are all different, but they were like, "This kid's no Taku and this girl's like, she plays the

936
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:20,390
Rym: piano.".

937
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:24,030
Scott: Yeah, but they weren't extreme hyperbole stereotype caricatures.

938
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:25,643
Scott: They were like, "This girl murders people with

939
00:49:25,683 --> 00:49:26,369
Scott: pianos.".

940
00:49:26,661 --> 00:49:26,850
Scott: Right.

941
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:27,790
Scott: They were like normal.

942
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:32,350
Scott: They seemed like normal people in Bocurano that just were different, had different personalities.

943
00:49:32,871 --> 00:49:36,210
Scott: These are like extreme anime personalities, each different character, right?

944
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:37,609
Scott: So it was like two gun nuts.

945
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:38,826
Scott: The girl who's like, "Meow,

946
00:49:38,847 --> 00:49:38,969
Scott: meow.".

947
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,030
Rym: Two gun nuts!

948
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,166
Scott: This is a girl who's kind of like making meow, cat noises, right?

949
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:45,569
Rym: We knew someone like that at RIT, so.

950
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:45,816
Rym: Yeah.

951
00:49:46,474 --> 00:49:46,601
Rym: YMMV.

952
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:50,910
Scott: But you know, like she says meow at the end of every like sentence or whatever, right?

953
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:58,490
Scott: There's all these weird characters in there and like, it's all, you know, that sort of, I think sort of makes it a little chintzy, right?

954
00:49:59,014 --> 00:49:59,769
Scott: And less serious.

955
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:10,149
Scott: But it's also like these people go to this village in the middle of nowhere and you know, they find it and crazy shit happens there and it's a mystery of like, what's the deal with this village?

956
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:12,010
Scott: Well, what's through the mysterious tunnel?

957
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:15,829
Scott: You know, where did that guy disappear to?

958
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:22,109
Scott: And it gives me sort of the same feel you get from like playing one of those video games, like nine doors, nine persons kind of thing.

959
00:50:22,371 --> 00:50:28,950
Rym: You know, actually Erased will give you a similar feeling because you're really, really trying to figure it out and they give you a lot of clues.

960
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:42,036
Scott: And it also feels like a little bit of paranoia agent, though clearly not anywhere near as good, but at least the mystery part of like, you know, because when you're thinking about like what's the deal with this village, it almost feels like what's the deal with Shounen Bed?

961
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:45,843
Rym: It's a shame you never didn't watch Inasekiyori from the New World.

962
00:50:45,903 --> 00:50:53,770
Rym: because what I would ask you is, is the mystery like like, is it more or less that kind of mystery?

963
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:54,454
Scott: It's definitely it's.

964
00:50:54,474 --> 00:50:56,430
Scott: it's definitely a supernatural mystery, for sure.

965
00:50:56,672 --> 00:50:58,270
Scott: It's not something that's just normal.

966
00:50:58,572 --> 00:50:59,397
Rym: But is it going to be like?

967
00:50:59,437 --> 00:51:03,549
Rym: what's the deal with the town is going to be like, what's the deal with the world in which this town exists?

968
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:05,050
Scott: It could be both.

969
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:13,769
Scott: It's also like there's a lot focusing on like each character having a troubled past and like their past is related to like, are they all on the bus because they have troubled past?

970
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:14,829
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

971
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:16,489
Rym: You know, that's why they're all.

972
00:51:16,832 --> 00:51:21,569
Scott: And then there's obviously the one magical girl who doesn't have a troubled past that she doesn't see monsters or whatever.

973
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:21,967
Rym: She had.

974
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:22,666
Rym: Oh, yeah.

975
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:22,958
Rym: OK.

976
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:24,670
Scott: And she might be a ghost.

977
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:27,530
Scott: It's just like there's all this stuff that like it's their body.

978
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,989
Scott: There's all this stuff that like might be or might not be.

979
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,450
Scott: And it's like they don't confirm anything.

980
00:51:31,551 --> 00:51:33,690
Scott: And the characters are all like detectives on their own.

981
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:35,270
Scott: Like everyone's got a different theory.

982
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:41,168
Scott: You know, they're always talking about stuff and forming different parties and going to different locations with each other.

983
00:51:41,551 --> 00:51:43,270
Scott: You know, all that kind of stuff.

984
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,629
Rym: Actually, Erase does a lot of that as well.

985
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:49,410
Rym: And also is very good at like every character at all.

986
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:54,569
Rym: Well, it'll give you moments of like a bunch of evidence, like, all right, something's up with that character, something possibly bad.

987
00:51:57,871 --> 00:52:02,370
Scott: So, yeah, those are all the shows that like I've been watching, like every episode of.

988
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:05,190
Scott: But I watched one of this one show I'm going to watch more episodes of.

989
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:07,830
Scott: I just have it, which is the Joker game.

990
00:52:08,112 --> 00:52:09,070
Rym: Yeah, that was one.

991
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,369
Rym: That was the one I was second most looking forward to.

992
00:52:11,891 --> 00:52:15,230
Rym: So it looked like a series shows the one I was the most looking.

993
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:22,289
Scott: I watched a few episodes of The Witch Show, but it's just like The Witch Show is just like a nice, you know, ah, kind of show.

994
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:24,709
Scott: So it's like I only watch it.

995
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:25,935
Scott: It's like I'm just not.

996
00:52:25,955 --> 00:52:28,950
Scott: it's like there's no pressing needs like watch more episodes.

997
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,770
Scott: It's not like a plot that really is pushing you.

998
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,890
Rym: It's like like when I watch Nietzsche, Joe, it's like, well, that was amusing.

999
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:34,733
Scott: It's just like.

1000
00:52:34,793 --> 00:52:41,525
Scott: it's just like if I need some, ah, I can always go back to The Witch Show, but there's no reason to like grind through it because it's like there's not like some plot you're trying to.

1001
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,570
Rym: So it's Joker game look like it's going to go somewhere or is it going to be.

1002
00:52:45,096 --> 00:52:46,149
Rym: So they know your Jimbo.

1003
00:52:46,411 --> 00:52:47,255
Scott: So no, no, no.

1004
00:52:47,276 --> 00:52:49,750
Scott: So it has a similar aesthetic gangster.

1005
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:50,492
Rym: Was that the other one?

1006
00:52:50,513 --> 00:52:56,133
Scott: It has a similar feel kind of because, you know, Jimbo serious adult dudes.

1007
00:52:56,233 --> 00:53:05,029
Scott: But anyway, it's so there's some sort of super secret spy organization and this guy is like the liaison to it of some kind.

1008
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:06,177
Scott: It's like it's not.

1009
00:53:06,278 --> 00:53:07,890
Scott: I'm not entirely clear what his position is.

1010
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:08,211
Scott: Right.

1011
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:16,050
Scott: But and they're all these ultimate badasses who had the ultimate training and he goes, he's hanging out and there's a game of poker.

1012
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:16,676
Scott: He's all right.

1013
00:53:16,696 --> 00:53:17,708
Scott: I'll play some poker with you.

1014
00:53:18,731 --> 00:53:21,649
Scott: And in the end of the poker game, it's like, no, no, no.

1015
00:53:21,911 --> 00:53:23,170
Scott: Actually, we weren't playing poker.

1016
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:28,055
Scott: We were playing the Joker game where we totally were all messing with you and what, you know.

1017
00:53:28,565 --> 00:53:28,769
Scott: Right.

1018
00:53:29,511 --> 00:53:41,118
Scott: And then immediately they start playing, you know, he gets played in the Joker game for real, where it's like all this total like espionage, deception, like you get set up big time.

1019
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:41,907
Scott: And right.

1020
00:53:43,131 --> 00:53:45,030
Scott: So basically I'll spoil the first episode.

1021
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:45,410
Scott: Right.

1022
00:53:46,274 --> 00:53:50,833
Scott: So there's something where they're like, oh, you know, this this guy is totally a spy.

1023
00:53:51,175 --> 00:53:54,170
Scott: We got to go to his house and investigate.

1024
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:56,030
Scott: And they're like, no, let's not do that.

1025
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,809
Scott: And he's like, no, we have orders to do it.

1026
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:58,774
Scott: We're going to do it.

1027
00:53:59,116 --> 00:53:59,357
Scott: Is that?

1028
00:53:59,418 --> 00:54:10,530
Scott: and the spy organization doesn't want to do it, but he forces them to do it, which is exactly what they wanted him to do, because when he gets there, they search his house and they didn't find anything.

1029
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,350
Scott: And he's like, what do you mean you didn't find anything?

1030
00:54:12,611 --> 00:54:15,710
Scott: It's like this place was searched actually recently.

1031
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:20,950
Scott: He didn't know that he got totally played in the Joker game.

1032
00:54:21,571 --> 00:54:25,850
Scott: And he said that he would, you know, commit a coup if he didn't find anything.

1033
00:54:26,374 --> 00:54:27,709
Scott: And it's like, ha ha ha ha ha.

1034
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:30,530
Scott: We totally tricked you into agreeing to kill yourself.

1035
00:54:30,874 --> 00:54:32,189
Scott: And we knew nothing would be here.

1036
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:36,390
Scott: We played you because we're super bad as some Akagi nonsense.

1037
00:54:36,593 --> 00:54:37,689
Rym: Which can be good.

1038
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:38,550
Scott: Yeah.

1039
00:54:38,932 --> 00:54:44,669
Scott: And now he's all sweating like, oh, shit, I'm going to have to kill myself now, even though this guy's totally a double agent for it.

1040
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:45,990
Scott: This guy's a spy for real.

1041
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,070
Scott: No, it's that kind of right.

1042
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:55,016
Scott: So it's all about that kind of situations with these crazy bad ass spy dudes and these kind of scenarios.

1043
00:54:55,076 --> 00:54:58,128
Scott: I don't know what episode two is going to be like, but that's what episode one was like.

1044
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:58,833
Scott: All right.

1045
00:54:59,357 --> 00:55:02,949
Rym: Well, I guess I'll catch up with some of these shows and then we'll start doing like full reviews of them.

1046
00:55:03,371 --> 00:55:05,470
Rym: Yeah, I think the one I'll watch immediately.

1047
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,214
Scott: I hope they play.

1048
00:55:06,294 --> 00:55:09,110
Scott: I hope they do Joker games, stuff like that every episode.

1049
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:09,611
Scott: Right.

1050
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:11,970
Scott: Where it's like, oh, someone got played every episode.

1051
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:12,331
Scott: Oh, sure.

1052
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:15,350
Rym: The game just sounds the most different from things I have seen.

1053
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:15,912
Scott: It's super.

1054
00:55:15,972 --> 00:55:21,710
Rym: It's way different from like all animes I've seen or at least stuff that I've seen recently, because there are shows that do that kind of thing.

1055
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:26,269
Scott: I just haven't watched them or at least there's not a lot of things I can compare Joker game to that I've seen.

1056
00:55:26,811 --> 00:55:30,030
Scott: It's almost like one of those awesome mangas you see that never gets translated.

1057
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,088
Scott: God actually got made into it.

1058
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:41,240
Rym: So this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1059
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:46,339
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for Web Design and Brando K for the logos.

1066
00:56:36,183 --> 00:56:38,450
Rym: I had great plans for this bit, but now I'm doubting it.

1067
00:56:38,610 --> 00:57:03,310

1068
00:57:04,531 --> 00:57:09,975
Rym: We just recorded the April Q&A and we're going to record the May Q&A almost immediately afterward.

1069
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:12,070
Rym: So that'll be up on the Patreon as soon as I can get.

1070
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:16,190
Rym: And then we'll be back on our regular schedule for the foreseeable future.

1071
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:19,170
Rym: The next interruption we'll have will be a very short one for ConnectiCon.

1072
00:57:20,672 --> 00:57:21,802
Rym: Give me another week or two.

1073
00:57:21,822 --> 00:57:22,810
Rym: You should start getting emails.

1074
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:26,510
Rym: Many of you submitted panels to ConnectiCon if you're actually doing it or whatever.

1075
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:43,694
Rym: But if you think if you sent a panel in and you're one of the people who listens to GeekNights and you think that it's one that I should have taken and I didn't for whatever reason, email me and remind me because I have very few slots and I'm extremely limited what I can fit.

1076
00:57:44,015 --> 00:57:50,749
Rym: But I will definitely take a look at something that someone messaged me about based on listening to what you just listened to.

1077
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,790
Rym: But anyway, I got another special.

1078
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:54,302
Rym: GeekNights is resumed.

1079
00:57:54,424 --> 00:57:54,890
Rym: Everything's good.

1080
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,970
Rym: I'm almost done with the Wheel of Time and now I leave you with something weird.
