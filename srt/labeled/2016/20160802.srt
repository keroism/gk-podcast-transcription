1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,342
Rym: It's Tuesday August 2nd 2016.

2
00:00:13,342 --> 00:00:20,039
Rym: I'm Rym I'm scared and this is GeekNights tonight the games that rims playing and Scott's not playing.

3
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:22,757
Scott: I guess Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:35,980
Rym: We're actually still a little bit sick like You know like usually when we get sick like there's a week of like no GeekNights And then we're just good to go again, but we're both still kind of sick, and it's weird sick.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,268
Scott: It's just like I keep having phlegm.

6
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:39,874
Scott: I keep coughing up, and it like like.

7
00:00:39,894 --> 00:00:44,068
Rym: this is the longest lingering virus I've ever had like it's.

8
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,064
Rym: actually if we if we keep lingering coughing for like another couple weeks This will be longer than Lyme disease Like it.

9
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:54,375
Scott: just you know like it waxes and wanes like at night.

10
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:59,231
Rym: It's bad, and then the day Who do we even get this from?

11
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:00,618
Rym: thanks ConnectiCon mm-hmm?

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,965
Scott: Followed the protocol.

13
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:05,780
Rym: yeah protocol did not save us that time.

14
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:06,986
Rym: I mean I buy.

15
00:01:07,087 --> 00:01:16,200
Rym: I even use the alcohol like hand wash Pretty regularly just because you know as the head of the panel's department I was like walking around touching shit like touching microphones.

16
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:17,625
Rym: That's the kind of stuff.

17
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,622
Rym: I don't do like at a normal packs other than the one panel We're on.

18
00:01:20,943 --> 00:01:24,440
Rym: it's not like we're walking around touching things other than board games.

19
00:01:25,882 --> 00:01:27,251
Rym: So I have in.

20
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:31,800
Rym: I had other gaming news But this is important enough because we'll see if it sticks around.

21
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,739
Rym: I tried to figure out the exact and specific legal reason why and how this occurred.

22
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,980
Rym: and Holy hell is the publishing provenance of Nintendo power difficult to suss out?

23
00:01:43,502 --> 00:02:00,160
Rym: But the best I can tell is Nintendo ceded the rights to this other company Future which was a subsidiary of a British company also called future Which apparently also owns things like games radar PC gamer maximum PC and all that nonsense.

24
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:04,778
Rym: but anyway the news is all of Nintendo power.

25
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:09,689
Rym: every single one is scanned and online.

26
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:13,279
Rym: at archive org you can just read through Nintendo power.

27
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:23,030
Rym: and It was a real real hardcore nostalgia trip because I our family we subscribe to Nintendo power Literally from day one.

28
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:27,912
Rym: I received in the mail every episode of Nintendo power except the first one.

29
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:33,460
Rym: we bought the first one in the store and Subscribed from it and got the next one in October.

30
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,158
Rym: So yeah, the Nintendo power was pretty much just An ad that I paid for.

31
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:56,769
Rym: Every month an ad came and I read the ad and I read the ad so much that when I was flipping through these things today I Remember Almost every one of these issues in frightening detail Like I remember what games were in them.

32
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:01,731
Rym: I just lay there as a kid like read them but over over again The most important one I think is probably 17.

33
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:12,635
Rym: I think it's 17 17 whichever one was the Final Fantasy guide Because that one most starkly shows the difference between a kid brain and an adult brain.

34
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:40,070
Rym: when I was a kid my kid brain I'd played Final Fantasy 1. but when I had the Final Fantasy 1 Nintendo power strategy guide, which I think was this year 17 I changed the way I played Final Fantasy 1. and what I would do and I do this about once a year is I would use The guide to do the perfect step count effectively other than leveling up but to just go through the game like no puzzles No getting lost no danger.

35
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,800
Rym: Just fight your way through get the floater and beat the game.

36
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,095
Rym: Like I would read a strategy guide and use it to play this optimal path through a very long game.

37
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:52,368
Rym: and I would do this Semi often as a child.

38
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:58,899
Rym: and that's the kind of thing that adult brain would not only disdain But actively try to convince people not to do.

39
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:12,419
Rym: I don't know what it was but I guess all the nostalgia I would get for playing Final Fantasy 1 again is 100% covered by just reading this issue of Nintendo power again.

40
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,214
Rym: In fact, I think I'm gonna read it again right now.

41
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:16,140
Rym: You got any news?

42
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,903
Scott: I do have a news.

43
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:31,869
Scott: So the game that I played perhaps the best game of a few years ago Whatever year it was that I played so much that I became one of the best maybe hundred players in the world Pac-man CEDX, XDX.

44
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,472
Scott: Pac-man.

45
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:36,011
Scott: Well, there was Pac-man championship edition Which I actually did not play.

46
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:44,160
Scott: then those Pac-man DX which is the real one and then they even had like DX plus which is like what you'll buy on Steam now.

47
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:48,109
Scott: Whatever right or see you all Whatever CEDX plus.

48
00:04:48,432 --> 00:05:00,183
Scott: Yeah, it was 17 man, anyway anyway, so You know that game, you know has been Sort of people like lost because basically, you know, it's a game I'm good at.

49
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:02,860
Scott: but the way the game works is really a game of optimization, right?

50
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:15,546
Scott: There's so many maps and you optimize each one and then after you figure out how to optimize each one It's just can you execute that optimization the end and if you can, you know Every little bit counts and that's your score.

51
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:20,120
Scott: and whoever gets the highest score the fastest time because there's time modes and score modes.

52
00:05:20,743 --> 00:05:21,587
Scott: That's pretty much it.

53
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:22,532
Scott: And then there's not much.

54
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:33,060
Scott: once you've reached like the limit There's only so much more you can improve and it's really not worth it to most human beings to sit there that long to Marginally improve by like a fraction of a second.

55
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,320
Rym: I mean, it's a lot like like for real more legitimate racing games like just get your time better by a few milliseconds.

56
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:48,054
Scott: Yeah, so over and over again memorize reached almost my maximum, you know Ability and results so I didn't play it as much.

57
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:51,600
Rym: You don't want to be a world contender I mean, I basically am a world contender.

58
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:53,165
Rym: So you should answer like packs.

59
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:59,109
Scott: a lot of the people who are ahead of me on the score chart were basically fake Entries that were not real people.

60
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:01,219
Scott: So yeah, it's pretty high up there.

61
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:04,689
Scott: but part of that was also because the way that the rankings worked.

62
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,614
Scott: is it you it combined.

63
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:06,996
Scott: there's like.

64
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:08,781
Scott: there's the combined ranking of Like.

65
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:13,865
Scott: I think at my highest ranking I was like, you know Like top 20 something.

66
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:18,300
Scott: but it's like it combined your scores for everything and I did everything in the whole game.

67
00:06:18,982 --> 00:06:25,080
Scott: But if you looked like I was like on the regular old course the basic course, I was like 200 something, right?

68
00:06:25,682 --> 00:06:32,789
Scott: It's still there are a bunch of fake people above me, but it's like I did all the courses It's like on the combined total ranking.

69
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:36,080
Scott: I was like 20 something, you know, but much higher anyway.

70
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:58,460
Scott: They have announced and produced many videos displaying and advertising the upcoming thankfully after packs Pac-man championship edition - Which is now which looks to be from the videos An awesome game but also a different game from championship edition different enough that it's not the same game.

71
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:03,013
Scott: So I think a lot of the same skills will apply.

72
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:14,309
Scott: It'll be the same kind of game about optimization but it seems much more complex and more interesting and will probably Take a lot longer to master.

73
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:17,299
Scott: and you mean you're gonna get to start from scratch no matter what.

74
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,295
Scott: So let's play this game because I can play this game.

75
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:31,284
Rym: Ah I played the original game and it was fun But I'm actually very much more a fan of sort of shared screen direct competition games Like video ball.

76
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:36,243
Rym: then I'm going to master this one particular skill Memorization games.

77
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:44,953
Rym: I have never liked games like Ikaruga never even really liked memorize these shmups that much it is Technically the same kind of thing is Ikaruga.

78
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:51,832
Scott: Yeah for some reason I mean, it's not that fun, but pac-man is way fun.

79
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:53,920
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what differences

80
00:07:54,140 --> 00:08:07,497
Rym: I've been is way fun until I got really good times on everything and then I could foresee I could forecast I could see the future I could look at one of my times or one of my scores and I can imagine what it would take to make that score better.

81
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:15,320
Rym: and As soon as I hit that point where I was not getting a better score almost every time I played I no longer cared.

82
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:17,467
Scott: That was pretty much the same thing that happened to me.

83
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:22,107
Scott: only the score that I got before I couldn't improve it significantly was much Higher than the one you got.

84
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:22,510
Scott: Yeah.

85
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:32,416
Rym: Yeah, so So in other news, I'm not gonna go through the details of it But Pokemon go got a couple updates and I've noticed it still haven't even installed this game.

86
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:37,080
Rym: It's uh, so here's Scott Here's the way to treat it like for real like real talk to really ignore it.

87
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:39,794
Rym: No, go play it because it is it's a fun thing.

88
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:42,924
Scott: It takes no time Wasn't fun to play?

89
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:48,410
Rym: tang that it is Pokemon snap and Play it as such.

90
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,720
Scott: Why don't I just play Pokemon snap?

91
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,280
Scott: Because it's better than Pokemon snap at being Pokemon snap.

92
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,253
Rym: Yeah, cuz Pokemon snaps actually not that I want to remade Pokemon snap.

93
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,340
Scott: I want to share but Pokemon snap is amazing.

94
00:08:59,380 --> 00:08:59,984
Scott: What's wrong with you?

95
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:00,587
Scott: It's old.

96
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,472
Scott: It's great.

97
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:02,740
Scott: Yeah, what do you mean?

98
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,924
Scott: And what's the last time you played it?

99
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:11,872
Rym: last time I played it was when it was a contemporary newish game Mm-hmm, and even then I only rented it for your n64 that you didn't have.

100
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,176
Rym: no, uh by who?

101
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:17,903
Rym: uh, I Don't remember the names any Adam Adams n64.

102
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:21,049
Scott: The point is Pokemon snap is still an amazing game.

103
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:21,510
Scott: Even today.

104
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,494
Scott: You don't know what you're talking about.

105
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,525
Rym: Yeah, play it again I dare you.

106
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:25,009
Scott: All right.

107
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:25,976
Rym: It's not that fun.

108
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:26,420
Scott: It's great.

109
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:27,203
Rym: This is this.

110
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:32,480
Rym: Pokemon snap is better because you're taking pictures of real Pokemon in the real world on like other people's crotches and things

111
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:33,942
Scott: Mm-hmm,

112
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:46,090
Rym: but the game has had some updates and some features have been added and removed and there was a so-called cheating thing where you could go to Google Maps and see where all the Pokemon were and And Niantic cut that off.

113
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,920
Rym: so that doesn't work anymore and people were bitching.

114
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:57,331
Rym: My advice to all of you out there because I play the game idly but like don't try to level up Don't try to maximize your IVs.

115
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:59,120
Rym: that stuff's not gonna matter ever.

116
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:06,100
Rym: But for real Don't complain to Niantic about the fact that they made the game more annoying for you.

117
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,198
Rym: You don't seem to understand the fact that this is a free-to-play cell phone game.

118
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:16,820
Scott: This is a garbage game and you're complaining that they took away what like something from it.

119
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,427
Rym: It's like it's not that garbage Scott like.

120
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:21,580
Rym: I don't know why you have such as like starkly dour opinion of it.

121
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,551
Scott: You walk around you mindlessly press a button.

122
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:26,920
Scott: you walk to a different place and mindlessly press a button.

123
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,046
Scott: This is not even like.

124
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:29,293
Scott: it's very actually.

125
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:30,399
Rym: no, you don't just press a button.

126
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:32,722
Rym: It.

127
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:43,513
Rym: you see you but you see a Pokemon composite on the real world like perched on something okay, and they're in that spot like other people only see that Pokemon in that one specific spot and You have to throw a pokeball and hit him.

128
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:44,219
Rym: get him.

129
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:51,996
Scott: Yeah, wouldn't it be better just play Angry Birds, which is more skill-based Because they're completely different thing.

130
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:56,480
Rym: Angry Birds is a game you play while you're pooping and you're trying to get a high score.

131
00:10:56,841 --> 00:10:58,046
Rym: This game is oh shit.

132
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:00,916
Rym: There's a Bulbasaur in near this park and I don't have it.

133
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:02,100
Rym: I'll get this Bulbasaur.

134
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,206
Rym: Yeah, I got a Bulbasaur.

135
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:05,378
Rym: you fill out the pokedex and then you're pretty much done.

136
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:07,325
Scott: Yeah, I don't do that.

137
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,539
Rym: All right, but plus, you know the social phenomenon.

138
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:19,345
Rym: it is Really interesting to me how the crowds of people who are out like catching Pokemon are only growing despite the you know Complaints about the game.

139
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:23,640
Scott: I don't need to play it to see morons in a group going around catching Pokemon.

140
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:29,477
Scott: I can I can get or to see Pokemon in potent super imposed on things in the real world in a funny way.

141
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:30,260
Scott: I can see that on Twitter.

142
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,590
Scott: There's no reason to actually install and waste time on this.

143
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:33,133
Rym: All right.

144
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:34,820
Rym: Well, it doesn't take really any time.

145
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,924
Rym: It's not like you're leveling up.

146
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:36,726
Rym: There's nothing to do.

147
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:40,439
Scott: It's less effort than ingress, but you know, it's less ever nothing.

148
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:43,860
Rym: All right, but what I'm seeing out there that's still real interesting.

149
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:54,558
Rym: It's like every time I walk at the lunch There are easily like 30 or 40 people like right outside of even my office and any phone I look at like any random phone that's out where someone's standing looking at it.

150
00:11:55,302 --> 00:12:04,734
Rym: more than half have a Pokemon go open and on adults kids there seems to be like a Completely flat demographic of just anyone with a smartphone pretty much.

151
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:13,600
Rym: Yeah, I see it on almost every phone I look at and it started a lot Like I'd see a lot of strangers talking to each other which did not really happen in New York City parks before.

152
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:18,359
Rym: Like you did not talk to a stranger and yet I've had strangers walk up to me.

153
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:23,781
Rym: Cuz I'm poking at the game and they're like, oh man There's a Clefairy like right over there, dude and it's.

154
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:35,359
Rym: it's weird and interesting to me that strangers will talk to me in New York City and I let my shields down enough to look them in the eye and possibly respond with human words that are not.

155
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,179
Rym: no Thanks, or I'll call the police.

156
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:39,795
Scott: Shouldn't the response be get the fuck away from me.

157
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:40,239
Scott: Who are you?

158
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,482
Rym: Pokemon guy.

159
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:42,407
Rym: Pokemon trainers are good.

160
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:42,869
Rym: They're all like.

161
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:45,320
Rym: they're all like the NPCs in Pokemon, but I'm an evil Pokemon.

162
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:49,560
Rym: I'm telling you knock a kid out and steal his fucking Pokemon.

163
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,360
Scott: Dude if they let you do that, like if I if my Scott they do it's called the real world.

164
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:56,150
Rym: Just hit people and take their phone.

165
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,312
Scott: if I took someone's phone and I could just Transfer all their Pokemon into my pokedex or my PC.

166
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:03,480
Rym: They're adding trading so you will be able to do that.

167
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,692
Scott: No, just giving like just take like all in one shot really quickly.

168
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,220
Scott: Yeah, then I would totally do that rocket mode.

169
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,210
Scott: Yeah I'd go around and just steal all people's Pokemon when they're not looking.

170
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:19,018
Rym: if you tied it to Google Wallet and then if you beat Someone in a Pokemon duel it literally took their money and gave it to you.

171
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:20,444
Scott: Yeah, all right.

172
00:13:20,585 --> 00:13:21,208
Scott: I would play that.

173
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:23,356
Rym: Okay speaking of which Google Wallet?

174
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:31,608
Rym: the thing that you Desperately tried to argue with me and convinced me a long time ago that it was done And website said it was no the website didn't.

175
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,340
Scott: the web multiple articles saying Google Wallet will no longer let you put money in.

176
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:37,827
Rym: Nope You said that and you were a hundred percent wrong.

177
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:51,007
Rym: every one of those articles linked to one article and that one article said Google Wallet will not let you put money in for the purposes of using a Google credit card Well debit card for transactions.

178
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,174
Rym: They were ending the debit card component of it.

179
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:54,439
Rym: Not the rest of it.

180
00:13:55,482 --> 00:14:04,693
Rym: And I point out it is now by six months since the date that you said Based on poor reading of a website that Google Wallet was gonna die.

181
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:08,299
Rym: and not only is Google Wallet still working But I used it today.

182
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:12,386
Rym: So you were wrong about that 100%.

183
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:13,374
Scott: the website was wrong about?

184
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:14,180
Rym: no the website.

185
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:16,049
Rym: In fact, I can find the website again a link to it.

186
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:17,879
Rym: The website was a hundred percent, right?

187
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:28,169
Rym: The website said Google Said You'll find the website again because I'll find the website again.

188
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:28,791
Rym: I saved it.

189
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:29,935
Scott: All right, go ahead.

190
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:31,420
Scott: All right, you were wrong.

191
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:40,266
Rym: But my advice to all you Pokemon go players out there is that if you expect Niantic to respond To you or care about your complaints.

192
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:44,300
Rym: This is a free-to-play cell phone game the free-to-play cell phone games.

193
00:14:44,661 --> 00:14:50,060
Rym: Especially if they have a candy box model and have any sort of interaction between players or levels or anything.

194
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,940
Rym: They they make their money by annoying you.

195
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,760
Rym: They're not gonna stop annoying you because the only way you're gonna put money into the thing is if that money avoids some annoyance.

196
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:21,179
Scott: It just never ceases to amaze me that like I'm 34 and I figured out sometime Around high school in college you know how to separate you know a game from its skin and like recognize the two things as a separate thing and see through the matrix and recognize a game for what it is and How many people in the world despite how much I spread this knowledge to them?

197
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:30,548
Scott: Completely failed to recognize this and like they can't see past the fact that this Pokemon on their screen and realize that there's some garbage Useless game underneath Scott.

198
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:35,024
Rym: Here's the article I had saved the link quote When to support.

199
00:15:35,044 --> 00:15:36,188
Scott: I don't think that's the right.

200
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:36,931
Scott: the same article.

201
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:38,376
Rym: This is definitely it.

202
00:15:38,697 --> 00:15:39,640
Rym: Google is shutting down.

203
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:42,519
Scott: That's not the same article that I saw.

204
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:49,558
Rym: Well, if you claim that then the article you saw one doesn't exist and two was wrong.

205
00:15:50,722 --> 00:15:56,280
Rym: So that either the best-case scenario is that you're bad at vetting websites and that you fell for a scam site.

206
00:15:58,322 --> 00:15:59,345
Rym: I mean, this is CNET.

207
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:00,528
Rym: There's no.

208
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:02,393
Rym: this was like the source.

209
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:04,138
Rym: This is still the top link.

210
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:10,251
Rym: if you search for that Wrong for some reason you're resisting it somehow here.

211
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:10,632
Rym: another one.

212
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:14,125
Rym: Google ready to kill its physical wallet card Got a wallet card.

213
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:16,216
Rym: Google is dropping support for it on June 30th.

214
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:21,757
Rym: separate article There is no article anywhere saying that Google Wallet itself is ending on that day.

215
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:22,419
Rym: You made it up.

216
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:26,640
Scott: There is an article that said Google Wallet will no longer let you put money into it.

217
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,787
Rym: There is no article that says that there is.

218
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:29,269
Scott: I'll find them.

219
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:29,590
Rym: Nope.

220
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:32,240
Rym: I dare you to find it because it does not exist.

221
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,540
Rym: So but Pokemon go at least is the minimum effort and it is fun enough like it covered the basics.

222
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,185
Rym: There's a Pokemon in the real world.

223
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:47,200
Rym: I can throw a pokeball at it and catch it and you can ignore every other part of the game.

224
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:57,429
Rym: What frightens me is that there are people who are not ignoring the rest of the game and are actively trying to level up and Play it and our certain friends of ours.

225
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,400
Rym: In fact are going so far as to IV train their Pokemon.

226
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:09,310
Rym: I guarantee that that IV training stuff either will never matter or If they add features to the point where it does matter.

227
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:09,992
Scott: Okay.

228
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:10,556
Scott: So here we go.

229
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:10,877
Scott: Mr.

230
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:14,108
Scott: All right This is the CNET article that you brought up.

231
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,397
Scott: All right, let me read it word for word.

232
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:20,869
Scott: All right When does support for wallet cards and wallet cards not wallet?

233
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:25,483
Scott: Hold on wallet cards will stop working on June 30th 2016.

234
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:26,130
Scott: Okay, sure.

235
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:34,843
Scott: Yeah, and You will not be able to add money to your Google Wallet account after May 1st 2016 Period.

236
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:36,990
Scott: so the article is written poorly.

237
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:39,880
Scott: It says you will not be able to add money to your Google Wallet account.

238
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,060
Scott: It doesn't say you will not be able to add money to your Google debit card.

239
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:59,787
Scott: You will not be able to add money to your Google Wallet account after May 1st 2016. clearly that is not the case because you can add money to your Google Wallet account and we are now after May 1st 2016. but those are the exact words in this article from CNET the Vented place or whatever.

240
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,837
Rym: All right, so you know those words were wrong.

241
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:03,700
Scott: I'm not wrong.

242
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:12,999
Scott: I just read those words and those words lied to me except every other website contemporary to this Says can you guys are those the words that say are that are on that page?

243
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,887
Rym: I'm reading the whole thing now.

244
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,520
Scott: Are those the words that are in that side?

245
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,530
Rym: So you are just there's some.

246
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,420
Scott: I'm dumb because I read what the word said.

247
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,840
Scott: You're the one who said something different from what the words say.

248
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,716
Rym: ah But I remember when we had this argument.

249
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:29,314
Rym: you Refuse to acknowledge all the other evidence of all the other sites that did not say that.

250
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:31,200
Scott: I'm just saying that's what they wrote here.

251
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:32,196
Scott: They wrote a wrong thing.

252
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:35,660
Scott: We can't yet tell me I'm dumb because someone wrote a wrong thing.

253
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:35,901
Scott: Well,

254
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:39,382
Rym: yeah, if one website says one thing and every other website says a different thing I'm

255
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:40,150
Scott: just saying and

256
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:40,898
Rym: you believe CNET

257
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,149
Scott: CNET that you were just trying to say this because

258
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:49,188
Rym: I was trying to give you the benefit of the doubt and find any website that Corroborated your made-up bullshit about Google Wallet.

259
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,736
Scott: I'm just saying you will not be able to add money.

260
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:52,780
Scott: That's a pretty clear statement.

261
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,600
Rym: Yeah, and if that's true, then how come you'd still argued against me even then when other websites said the opposite?

262
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,320
Rym: Why did you trust CNET over all these other websites?

263
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,399
Rym: I didn't read any other websites even when I showed him to you on my phone and I was like hey That's what it says right there.

264
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:14,160
Rym: In fact believe many of our friends were present for this argument and we're waiting for me to bring this up in the future.

265
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,300
Rym: when?

266
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,090
Rym: You were definitely wrong Because no one agreed with you and everyone thought you were wrong.

267
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,077
Rym: and sure enough you were wrong.

268
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:21,960
Scott: Yes the whole world.

269
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:28,303
Scott: I'm just saying those are the words that are in that article that led me to believe a thing that is wrong and those words Are pretty clear.

270
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:32,100
Scott: So that's what happens when you read things up further on in the article.

271
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:33,319
Rym: It actually is pretty clear.

272
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:39,920
Rym: So you focused on one sentence of one article among a sentence among many in an article among many.

273
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,831
Rym: I'm just saying I'm just saying yeah, you were super wrong on this.

274
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:45,435
Scott: Let's go find the things.

275
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,748
Scott: room is wrong about no name name one thing.

276
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:59,428
Rym: I'm wrong about many things such as So Scott what's funny?

277
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:04,532
Rym: because you I know you don't listen to the patreon stuff But I've been listening to the beta episodes of GeekNights.

278
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:06,400
Scott: Why why do you hurt yourself that way?

279
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,220
Rym: We until the the one I just remastered was the first time we did a real episode of GeekNights.

280
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:18,635
Rym: Before that it was just us arguing about stupid shit like that And I was kind of nostalgic for those days like we argued about the dumbest shit.

281
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:19,980
Scott: you stop listening to this shit.

282
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:21,264
Rym: It's amazing though.

283
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:22,408
Scott: No, it's not Scott.

284
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:28,500
Rym: you and I both were super convinced and excited That Karl Rove was gonna get indicted for treason.

285
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:30,266
Scott: No, I guess that could happen.

286
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:34,300
Rym: yeah, yeah, but we both like really believed it and you talked a lot about Janet Reno.

287
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:35,407
Rym: You seem to know a lot about her.

288
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:37,239
Scott: I guess I'd used to yeah.

289
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:43,616
Rym: But anyway, uh, that's another GeekNights tradition of the dumb argument that goes on forever.

290
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:44,198
Scott: There's not a point.

291
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:48,713
Scott: It's like what good load of caring did to help write nothing.

292
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:57,938
Rym: Pokemon go is Fun despite what Scott says but do not in any way Spend money on it.

293
00:20:58,461 --> 00:21:03,200
Rym: Do not in any way spend time on it other than collecting Pokemon and doing the basics.

294
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:17,510
Rym: Like if you're walking around catch some Pokemon Don't spend hours using lucky eggs to level yourself up to hit a specific level and Also that level cap of 30 that you're all obsessed with.

295
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:20,399
Rym: that's gonna take, you know hundreds of hours to level up to.

296
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:22,165
Rym: They're gonna raise it.

297
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:23,430
Rym: They're gonna keep raising forever.

298
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,340
Rym: candy box games have to raise the levels forever.

299
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:28,228
Scott: Your life is only so long.

300
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,180
Scott: how much of your life are you gonna spend making a number go up on your phone?

301
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:41,355
Scott: even if you like even if you're walking from point A to point B is Your life going to be enriched more by looking at your phone Mindlessly tapping in the picture of a Pokemon or by looking around you?

302
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,580
Rym: that depends on where I am.

303
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,751
Rym: If it's a place I won't let play a worthwhile game.

304
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:52,667
Scott: if you're gonna be doing that a game with some amount of thought Involved like what that you can play while you're walking You can play while you're walking.

305
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,540
Scott: a game with thought involves some kind of some kind of like puzzle or something.

306
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,255
Rym: You know, you're gonna stare at your phone staring at a puzzle while you're walking.

307
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,240
Scott: Hey, why not?

308
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:01,152
Rym: I guess it could be an audio puzzle.

309
00:22:01,172 --> 00:22:02,179
Scott: Well, that's not bad idea.

310
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:05,575
Rym: I wonder if we could make that like audio puzzles share for blind people.

311
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:05,976
Scott: They exist.

312
00:22:06,097 --> 00:22:08,326
Scott: Yeah Where what?

313
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:09,214
Rym: What do you mean?

314
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:09,879
Rym: They exist where?

315
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,905
Scott: There's all kinds of search for.

316
00:22:11,925 --> 00:22:12,869
Scott: I've done this before.

317
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:18,000
Scott: they search like video games for blind people and there's all sorts of like audio Only games text adventures are actually really popular.

318
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:19,282
Scott: Use that.

319
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:24,723
Scott: use the voice the text to voice and voice to text both combined and you can you know, ah Actually, here's one.

320
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:28,500
Rym: when NPR does is it's wait, they're always logic puzzles, but they tell you a logic puzzle.

321
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,386
Rym: You have to figure out the answer.

322
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:29,809
Rym: Mm-hmm.

323
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,849
Rym: I don't think they give you the answer though Maybe they give it to you next week.

324
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:33,232
Rym: I don't know.

325
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,039
Rym: I already lost interest.

326
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:47,641
Rym: Don't just do not invest significance time or resources in Pokemon go because what it is now it will never be Substantially more than what it is Now.

327
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:54,873
Rym: if you're investing in it thinking that is going to be more than it is now in the future You're going to be deeply disappointed in the future.

328
00:22:54,893 --> 00:23:00,258
Rym: I'm surprised people aren't disappointed already Because it's actually way better than the minimum effort had to be.

329
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,520
Rym: Shockingly, yeah, okay it is it could have been way less and it was way more.

330
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,411
Scott: I guess it can always be less but it's still not enough.

331
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,137
Rym: Oh, what would be enough?

332
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:11,700
Rym: What do you want?

333
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,266
Scott: What would be enough to make me play it?

334
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:16,415
Scott: Yeah had to be an actual game of skills.

335
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:17,780
Rym: What like Pokemon?

336
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:20,566
Scott: Pokemon is more game of skills the book.

337
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:24,799
Rym: So what if it was regular Pokemon except in the real world like a are MMO?

338
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:26,224
Scott: Maybe?

339
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:35,800
Rym: then maybe you'd play it maybe Anyway things of the day.

340
00:23:36,355 --> 00:23:39,079
Rym: so Most of you probably have no idea about this.

341
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:45,300
Rym: But if you play Mario Party, I think seven six or seven was the last one I play because Mario Party fucking sucks.

342
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:53,820
Rym: I'm just sorry, but Mario Party Has something that you might not have known because you've probably never actually put the AI on easy.

343
00:23:53,981 --> 00:23:57,117
Scott: Well, you've never been so sad as to play Mario Party against the AI.

344
00:23:57,137 --> 00:24:02,012
Rym: now I first encountered this with a red supray.

345
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:04,640
Rym: It's one of the things you'll ever see.

346
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:09,400
Rym: It's Mario Party of one and it's a kid playing Mario Party.

347
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,892
Scott: I think that was the prettiest thing of the day.

348
00:24:10,912 --> 00:24:11,819
Rym: calm calm and calm.

349
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:14,035
Scott: But well calm one come to come through.

350
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:14,659
Scott: I should do that.

351
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:26,315
Rym: If you put the AI in Mario Party games on easy like you set the game to easy mode and You're the only human the AIs conspire to make you win.

352
00:24:26,335 --> 00:24:50,619
Rym: and this video And there's one of these for every Mario Party it's just a compilation of a ton of mini games in Mario Party 10 where Luigi wins by inputting nothing at any point into the game and It's kind of amazing to watch Especially considering a lot of the comments are people who are either saying it's fake or who are Angry at the other players for being so bad.

353
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:53,314
Rym: Do not understand that.

354
00:24:53,676 --> 00:24:54,399
Rym: it's the AI.

355
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:57,811
Scott: Yeah, Rin sent me this link and I'm like, why is it?

356
00:24:57,851 --> 00:25:00,480
Scott: I just watched the video and I'm like, why is this interesting?

357
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:08,260
Scott: it's just like somebody made a bunch of clips of Luigi winning it Smash Brothers and Mario Party without pressing any buttons.

358
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:13,200
Scott: I assumed that some other people were controlling all the other characters and just making them be stupid.

359
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,275
Scott: Yeah to create this video and I'm like, this isn't really funny or interesting.

360
00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:17,957
Scott: What's the deal?

361
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:18,640
Scott: Why do you like this?

362
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,420
Scott: And then I realized Smash Brothers is only one and they probably did the Smash Brothers one like a bunch of times.

363
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:33,900
Scott: Yeah, but the until they got the result they wanted but the Mario Party ones is yeah It's the AI went on easy is so bad that it loses on purpose.

364
00:25:34,362 --> 00:25:41,672
Scott: So they were able to show I don't know why they didn't need to do so many of them to demonstrate this but it's like Yeah, well the thing is an easy loses on purpose.

365
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:43,300
Scott: You can literally input nothing and win.

366
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:47,982
Rym: This is in a court one of those ghettos on the internet, especially on YouTube There are.

367
00:25:48,022 --> 00:25:53,917
Rym: there's this whole underground world of no input wins in games and there's a community of people.

368
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,724
Rym: It's kind of like the lot Running community.

369
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:57,529
Rym: They're not.

370
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,680
Rym: they're not like super big but I found this whole game.

371
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,060
Rym: There's a lot of videos about this stuff and as people try to win games by not inputting anything

372
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:20,212
Scott: I've seen people make Mario Maps before Mario maker and the old like hack ROMs and stuff where they make their own maps where they design the map where you don't input anything and it starts and then Mario just goes like Through a crazy amount of stuff and eventually wins the level without pressing anything.

373
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:25,146
Rym: This is a step beyond the half press a. So you got a thing of the day.

374
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,500
Scott: yeah, I do have a thing of the day.

375
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:37,360
Scott: So, you know under your bicycle you got gears and you got a gear in the front and a gear in the back Hopefully a bunch of gears in the back unless you're really dumb and there's a ratio between those gears.

376
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:45,499
Scott: right if you got a big one in the front and a small one in the back one crank in the front might turn the back one Like five or six times.

377
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,637
Scott: that's like the ratio is the number of times the other one spins and you turn the crank once.

378
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:59,048
Scott: if you had a little One in the front a big one in the back You might turn the crank once and have the back one spin like not even one time And then your ratio is like less than one.

379
00:26:59,088 --> 00:26:59,952
Scott: It's like point five.

380
00:27:00,012 --> 00:27:01,599
Rym: That's how you go weeka weeka weeka up a hill.

381
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:02,540
Scott: All right, exactly.

382
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:09,786
Scott: But when the ratio is low less than one or you know well the lower the ratio the easier it is to turn the handle.

383
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:15,349
Scott: the crank is real easy to turn and The bigger the ratio you go a lot faster.

384
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:18,580
Scott: less cranks will get you a lot of spins, but it's hard to turn like.

385
00:27:19,662 --> 00:27:20,506
Scott: You need more energy.

386
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:29,337
Rym: Oh, I was gonna look up something about gear ratios And all I found is these fixie people who are obsessed with a 44 16 ratio and how it's the perfect rate.

387
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:31,263
Rym: fixie people Whatever.

388
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:34,211
Scott: So this guy this has nothing to do with bicycles.

389
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:48,471
Scott: He just set up a bunch of gears and these gears have Particularly, they're designed in particular way such that the ratio is ridiculously Ridiculously low or high depending on which end you put the crank on.

390
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:51,100
Rym: Oh, it looks like it's a bunch of planetary nonsense in here.

391
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,681
Rym: Yeah, well no It's.

392
00:27:52,841 --> 00:27:55,049
Scott: it's really the other gears that are the main ones.

393
00:27:55,089 --> 00:28:05,840
Scott: you just use the planetary ones to sort of multiply the effect of the other ones, you know if you watch the video, but basically He's got a whole bunch of gears all stacked up in a really interesting configuration.

394
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:18,039
Scott: That's easy to understand if you watch the video such that you have you would have to turn the crank over 11 million times to get the big gear to turn one time.

395
00:28:18,703 --> 00:28:19,770
Scott: So such power.

396
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:27,439
Scott: so it's like dude Turn the big gear one time put a lever on it and pull it and make the handle spin 11 million.

397
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:29,224
Scott: Just do it.

398
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:30,066
Scott: Just do it.

399
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:30,448
Scott: Of course.

400
00:28:30,528 --> 00:28:36,149
Scott: It would be so hard to turn that you actually I'm pretty sure It might just explode if you do that.

401
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,004
Scott: Well, I'm pretty sure I need a lever So big.

402
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:45,339
Rym: if you tried to do that it would If it was a perfect system that doesn't exist in the real world.

403
00:28:45,782 --> 00:28:52,752
Rym: Yeah, the other end would go faster than the speed of light which is why this is impossible Independent of the material sciences concerns, huh?

404
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,816
Scott: That's interesting, right?

405
00:28:53,836 --> 00:28:54,117
Scott: Yeah.

406
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:54,780
Rym: I know the answer.

407
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,509
Rym: I know where you're going with this behind you.

408
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:57,233
Scott: What's the answer then?

409
00:28:57,374 --> 00:29:00,660
Rym: So the answer is Materials are not actually rigid.

410
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:09,291
Rym: So no matter how long a lever you think you're gonna make because you're thinking make a lever so long That you could force something else to go faster than the speed of lights, right?

411
00:29:09,572 --> 00:29:09,752
Rym: Yeah.

412
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:12,119
Rym: The answer is materials aren't actually rigid.

413
00:29:13,123 --> 00:29:21,974
Rym: So just because the bending of the thing y'all couldn't can't actually make a rigid body Mmm, cuz remember it's just electrons like nothing's touching anything.

414
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:26,671
Scott: So even though on paper it would happen You can't actually do it because there's no material you can actually make.

415
00:29:26,712 --> 00:29:27,555
Scott: that would make it happen.

416
00:29:27,595 --> 00:29:28,719
Scott: Something else would mess you up.

417
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,885
Scott: Yep, physically.

418
00:29:29,905 --> 00:29:31,472
Rym: Yep physics gets in the way.

419
00:29:31,492 --> 00:29:35,472
Scott: It's like we just it's like oh, haha It didn't actually happen the way you thought all this video.

420
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:37,180
Scott: I didn't make one that wouldn't explode.

421
00:29:37,461 --> 00:29:41,540
Rym: I was clicking around the video and I hit the page where he shows the equation of the gear ratio.

422
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,387
Scott: It's not really a complex math at all.

423
00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:53,340
Scott: He's just multiplying the ratios of all the gear after gear after gear, you know All together, so we should make an art installation with a robot that's slowly turning that 11 million times.

424
00:29:54,143 --> 00:29:54,505
Scott: Go for it.

425
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:56,192
Scott: Yeah, you can 3d print all his gears.

426
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:58,301
Rym: Yeah, I Go.

427
00:29:58,321 --> 00:30:00,573
Rym: Whoa, there's a. so I found another ghetto on the internet.

428
00:30:00,593 --> 00:30:03,070
Rym: Oh That's all his channel.

429
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:07,916
Rym: I was about to say now There's all these recommended videos of crazy gears, but it's all the same guy's channel.

430
00:30:08,217 --> 00:30:08,900
Scott: He 3d prints gears.

431
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,484
Scott: That's his deal.

432
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:12,140
Scott: So you could actually add his channel to the thing of the day if you want as well.

433
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,260
Scott: But the extreme ratio is the most interesting one, right?

434
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:18,340
Scott: Yeah bigger go home.

435
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,597
Rym: I really do just want to do what you're saying and put something on the inside gear.

436
00:30:22,617 --> 00:30:23,260
Rym: just give it a twist.

437
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:24,298
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

438
00:30:25,165 --> 00:30:31,879
Scott: At least you know, you know If you can't do the 11 million right at least cut it down to like 1 million and then turn it like 90 degrees.

439
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:36,195
Scott: You don't need to turn all the way and you get 250 K spins in one pole.

440
00:30:36,255 --> 00:30:37,580
Scott: It's like go for it.

441
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:38,544
Scott: Pretty awesome, right?

442
00:30:38,564 --> 00:30:42,020
Scott: I wonder what that has to be a point at which it's doable.

443
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:43,185
Rym: Well, the gears either.

444
00:30:43,446 --> 00:30:46,580
Scott: even 10,000 spins in that amount of time would be really cool.

445
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,339
Rym: I suspect things will either melt catch fire or shear or explode.

446
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:52,625
Rym: Those are the four options.

447
00:30:52,665 --> 00:31:03,286
Scott: melt like no, all right, you know put a knife on it and pull it right cut something Put a knife with like an apple and like You know, we've.

448
00:31:03,347 --> 00:31:05,540
Rym: if we were better at this we could just video ourselves.

449
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:18,799
Rym: Like we're gonna turn the other way and make a whole video and then you like walk up to it and you start to turn It and then we just composite it exploding and killing both of us Do it like a live stream prank and then just shows us sitting there dead and the live streams keeps going after that.

450
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:23,296
Rym: Whatever in the moment the book club book, which we are talking about on Thursday.

451
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:24,018
Scott: You actually read it.

452
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:29,040
Rym: Yeah Book took me like five and a half six hours to read according to Kendall.

453
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,211
Rym: That's what I took me or extend Craig by Margaret Atwood.

454
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:38,731
Rym: if you ever wondered what cheeky knobs are now, you'll know goons pig goons.

455
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:43,393
Scott: You know actually that cool a pig cheeky knobs also.

456
00:31:43,454 --> 00:31:45,520
Scott: pig goons ring goes from the shell to man machine interface.

457
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,240
Scott: Ah, I feel like they were the main plot point if you could pay attention and understand what the hell was going on.

458
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:56,388
Rym: Something that is very important to modern society is that I think Chicky knobs would be a good idea.

459
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:59,303
Rym: Like I feel like we really should make things like that I would eat chicken them.

460
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:00,628
Rym: I would eat chicken knobs all the time.

461
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,271

473
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,349

Rym: anything other than laundry like it's.

497
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,783
Rym: it's nice out but like it can only bike so much in a day Biking around.

498
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:55,530
Rym: Yeah, I've been biking around reading books.

500
00:33:57,115 --> 00:34:02,710

501
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:04,776

Rym: I've been cooking those.

504
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:09,885
Rym: I've been watching a lot of TV.

505
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,333
Rym: actually cuz Steven Universe is like in full steam again.

506
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:16,178
Rym: Bojack just came out Rick and Morty's coming real soon.

507
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:18,255
Rym: Stranger Things looks real good.

508
00:34:18,335 --> 00:34:26,699
Rym: It looks like It looks like some Stephen King style horror nonsense with a modern sensibility but with some throwback sensibilities as well.

509
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:27,918
Scott: Yeah, I don't watch any of that trick.

510
00:34:28,842 --> 00:34:30,435
Rym: It's probably really good and critically acclaimed.

511
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:31,120
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

512
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:35,760
Rym: So I thought I thought your whole definition of non-drek was like it has to be critically acclaimed in some way.

513
00:34:36,061 --> 00:34:38,688
Scott: No, I just don't like American television really.

514
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:39,973
Rym: All right.

515
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:42,340
Rym: So what about critically acclaimed American television?

516
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,612
Scott: Yeah, we'll see if anyone even remembers it in like five years.

517
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,080
Rym: So have you watched the wire?

518
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,811
Rym: Nope, cuz that's still remembered.

519
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,219
Rym: It's been a long time since that came out.

520
00:34:51,802 --> 00:34:54,777
Rym: Yeah, you're not playing any games at all because you don't even come to like game nights.

521
00:34:54,797 --> 00:34:55,480
Rym: We do over here anymore.

522
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:58,095
Rym: No, no, you're not playing like games.

523
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:03,060
Rym: Yeah, you didn't even really play all the games we played at the party.

524
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,172
Scott: You only played Motai night, which is a bad game now.

525
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:07,640
Rym: We played a few other games.

526
00:35:07,861 --> 00:35:08,704
Scott: What are the games you play?

527
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:10,190
Rym: mostly glory to Rome?

528
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,495
Scott: I played that once.

529
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:11,736
Scott: Yeah.

530
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:12,760
Scott: It's also not a good game.

531
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,325
Scott: That's a good game.

532
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:13,930
Rym: It's a real good game.

533
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,080
Rym: I like Motai night a lot.

534
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,974
Rym: I still think I like glory to Rome more, but I feel like they're.

535
00:35:19,194 --> 00:35:20,780
Rym: they serve different purposes.

536
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:24,938
Rym: glory to Rome is just a romp through this heuristic space.

537
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:31,060
Rym: and Motai night is you stare at each other and then you all do a thing and then you all go well shit.

538
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,733
Rym: And then you stare at each other do it a few more times and someone was smarter.

539
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:36,520
Scott: I don't like any of those games.

540
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:37,284
Rym: All right.

541
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:40,060
Rym: So what game what game do you want to play if you're not playing any games?

542
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,319
Rym: Like what game would break you out of your not gaming funk?

543
00:35:44,523 --> 00:35:46,234
Scott: It starts snowing so I can't go outside.

544
00:35:46,255 --> 00:35:48,788
Rym: I have to play a game So there's no game you can think of.

545
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:51,280
Rym: that would get you to stay inside and play a game like today.

546
00:35:52,722 --> 00:35:53,848
Scott: It is kind of raining today.

547
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:55,859
Rym: Yeah, it was raining yesterday's why I didn't bike to work.

548
00:35:56,602 --> 00:36:00,656
Scott: I spent all night playing overwatch a game where I like wouldn't go home and eat dinner.

549
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:01,780
Scott: I'd play the game instead.

550
00:36:01,922 --> 00:36:05,727
Rym: Yeah, like I'd say like after we do the show We just play the game cuz I can name like.

551
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,616
Rym: I could easily come up with 40 or so games.

552
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,438
Rym: I would do that for right now.

553
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,278
Rym: Mmm, some of those games don't exist.

554
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:19,902
Scott: Nothing I'm not in a gaming mood.

555
00:36:19,942 --> 00:36:20,924
Scott: It's not game time.

556
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:21,444

561
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:34,026
Scott: Uh, if you played Valhalla Installed that too and didn't play it yet.

562
00:36:34,146 --> 00:36:35,210
Rym: Oh, you least installed it.

563
00:36:35,351 --> 00:36:36,274
Scott: It's not going anywhere.

564
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:37,418
Scott: That's a single-player game.

565
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:37,880
Scott: What's the rush?

566
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:39,989
Rym: Yeah, it looks like there was an update to it already.

567
00:36:40,211 --> 00:36:41,818
Scott: I can wait for a gaming mood and then play.

568
00:36:41,858 --> 00:36:42,280
Scott: it's not going.

569
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,872
Scott: It's nothing, you know, it's not gonna be a different game than it is now.

570
00:36:46,294 --> 00:36:48,060
Rym: So I got the expansion to camel up.

571
00:36:49,422 --> 00:36:50,890
Rym: Now we can do 10 player camel ups.

572
00:36:51,272 --> 00:36:52,760
Scott: if you had 10 people I might play that once.

573
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:54,948
Rym: Yeah, in fact people are coming over tomorrow.

574
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:56,434
Rym: We're gonna play some board games.

575
00:36:56,454 --> 00:36:58,100
Scott: I don't think you have 10 people though.

576
00:36:58,302 --> 00:36:59,838
Rym: No, I don't agree to have 10 people either.

577
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:01,767
Rym: Camel up at this point is my.

578
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,840
Rym: there's more people than we have room in a real game to play.

579
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,775
Rym: So we're gonna play camel up instead pretty much.

580
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:11,055
Rym: That's the game I mean, it's fun, but it's not as fun as say st.

581
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,340
Rym: Petersburg or Kayla's.

582
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:15,108

00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,440
Scott: I'm gonna fly across the country to spend four days playing games.

586

Rym: Why would I play a game now just play a game then but you're gonna get over there and we're all just gonna want to Play overwatch and we'll just go to the PC area and play an overwatch.

587
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,615
Scott: Okay, you can't do that for more than like 20 minutes.

588
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:30,480
Scott: So good luck with that.

589
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,423
Rym: I could I could.

590
00:37:31,523 --> 00:37:34,654

591
00:37:34,975 --> 00:37:38,744
Rym: where I went I entered the Counter-strike arms race tournament.

592
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:50,920
Rym: because basically and this seems to be a trend at PAX is if you enter those like second tier PC gaming tournaments at PAX is The enforcers like set you up and it's sort of self-regulating like they don't really pay attention to you that much.

593
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:53,159
Rym: So you do the qualifier and you lose or whatever?

594
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:03,719
Rym: But usually no one comes over and makes you leave because those pcs are dedicated to that tournament and you can just stay in There and keep playing counter-strike for like hours and no one will say anything to you.

595
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:11,172
Scott: That's how you want to spend your pecs playing a game that you could play in your house Playing it on a LAN with other people or physically next to me yelling and screaming.

596
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:13,520
Scott: Mm-hmm slightly improved, but it's not.

597
00:38:13,901 --> 00:38:16,188
Scott: Experience not really worth the.

598
00:38:16,408 --> 00:38:21,566
Rym: I think it is more than like one or two because the LAN experience is actually rare Er than it used to be.

599
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:28,394
Rym: so I don't commonly experience the LAN But on the rare occasions when I do usually cuz I'm at a con by accident.

600
00:38:28,435 --> 00:38:36,350
Rym: Like I play a game on a LAN suddenly like How come I can avoid coughing in the microphone.

601
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,640
Scott: but you can't you think you've been coughing constantly for a while?

602
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,940
Scott: But I go is go away from the microphone like chocolate rain.

603
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:48,427
Rym: I still have a filter that edits the cops out at least for you because yours are yours are pretty Regular and consistent.

604
00:38:48,447 --> 00:38:50,700
Rym: I can show you the cough filter if you want.

605
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,739
Rym: It's a noise filter that looks specifically for cops and reduces them.

606
00:38:56,227 --> 00:39:00,615
Rym: But the LAN experience every time I do it like especially a couple weekends ago.

607
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:05,015
Rym: our friends came out and Phil and Jan and we we just played overwatch while they were here.

608
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:06,040
Rym: They stood up in the living room.

609
00:39:06,522 --> 00:39:06,904
Scott: Why didn't?

610
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:07,606
Scott: why they even come?

611
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:08,490
Scott: they could have just stayed at home.

612
00:39:09,153 --> 00:39:10,860
Rym: There's something about the LAN experience.

613
00:39:11,221 --> 00:39:16,160
Scott: I mean, yeah, there's something about the LAN experience, but I'm not gonna do it more than like two games worth at a PAX.

614
00:39:17,362 --> 00:39:18,487
Rym: I mean, I used to go to LAN.

615
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:21,340
Scott: The LAN experience does not even come close to the PAX experience.

616
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,269
Rym: The LAN experience is the PAX experience.

617
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:25,057
Rym: Yeah, it's all part of the same experience.

618
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,143
Rym: No All right.

619
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:28,168
Rym: Well, I'm gonna keep doing it.

620
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:30,620
Rym: But yeah overwatch is pretty much my overarching game right now.

621
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,567
Rym: Like I'm actually playing it's interesting.

622
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:36,540
Rym: We've sort of flipped for some reason Scott's I guess doing laundry and watching Korean dramas.

623
00:39:37,162 --> 00:39:38,969
Rym: I'm playing more games than I've played.

624
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,034
Scott: I don't watch any dramas.

625
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:41,560
Rym: Ah, just the variety shows.

626
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:46,332
Rym: But like I'm gaming a lot lately.

627
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:48,740
Scott: The dramas are probably even worse than American television.

628
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:52,439
Scott: I mean, yeah, they have their merits but it's like oh my god, you can't watch it.

629
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:59,340
Rym: But I honestly play overwatch like an hour or two every night and you're never getting those hours back.

630
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:03,094
Rym: You know what dad you never get those tribes two hours back yet either.

631
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,660
Rym: Do you regret those tribes two hours?

632
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:07,610
Rym: Maybe what do you really regret?

633
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,440
Rym: playing tribes - those are good time?

634
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,850
Scott: I could have done some good stuff instead.

635
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,959
Scott: if like what less stupid?

636
00:40:12,352 --> 00:40:13,684
Rym: Oh, well Like what if we had died.

637
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:16,374
Rym: if we had done like we're gonna fucking make shit.

638
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,657
Rym: back then when we were in college instead of playing Games, we wouldn't have played enough games to be able to GeekNights.

639
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,569
Rym: now Mmm, like we wouldn't have known the things that we.

640
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:26,520
Scott: so I running out of you guys ideas now cuz they're making shit and not.

641
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:28,180
Rym: So we got to play more shit.

642
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:29,843
Rym: No, why not?

643
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:38,331
Rym: because then week one I don't want to because either we can make more because we've played more or We're just playing games like in the old like, you know those days.

644
00:40:38,713 --> 00:40:40,460
Scott: problem is I've seen through all games.

645
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,122
Scott: There's nothing.

646
00:40:41,363 --> 00:40:42,527
Scott: there's nothing new in gaming.

647
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:43,991
Scott: That is different than anything.

648
00:40:44,031 --> 00:40:46,680
Scott: I've seen before it's not you know, it's not getting me excited.

649
00:40:47,521 --> 00:40:49,471
Scott: Every time I look at a new game, I'm like, yeah.

650
00:40:49,551 --> 00:40:49,873
Scott: All right.

651
00:40:49,953 --> 00:40:50,797
Scott: That's just one of those.

652
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:53,668
Scott: whatever That played that what?

653
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:57,300
Rym: if that's true then how come you don't win new games when we play them?

654
00:40:57,865 --> 00:40:59,099
Scott: It doesn't mean that I have the skills.

655
00:40:59,281 --> 00:41:01,088
Scott: It just means that I'm not interested.

656
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,334
Rym: but you saw through it.

657
00:41:02,354 --> 00:41:03,660
Rym: So clearly you didn't actually see through.

658
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,870
Rym: you Don't really know what's going on.

659
00:41:06,183 --> 00:41:08,020
Rym: What do you mean like in a random board game?

660
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,727
Rym: Look, you play.

661
00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:12,357
Rym: we play some new board game Like you don't really see if you understood it enough to win it.

662
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:16,758
Scott: I understand it enough that it is not stimulating me in a way that is bringing me.

663
00:41:16,818 --> 00:41:20,975
Rym: Joy All right, so what kind of game would you would be new?

664
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:22,179
Rym: what kind of game do you want to play?

665
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,845
Scott: No games Not any game.

666
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:28,790
Scott: I can bet a game.

667
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:29,796
Rym: What kind of tabletop game?

668
00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:30,339
Rym: any game?

669
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,945
Scott: You just play some teeny I guess.

670
00:41:31,985 --> 00:41:33,891
Rym: so just play teeny again.

671
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:33,972
Rym: Mmm.

672
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:36,300
Scott: What else you want to play?

673
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,281
Rym: I don't know.

674
00:41:37,301 --> 00:41:39,811
Rym: I actually kind of want after doing that show the other day.

675
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:41,900
Rym: I kind of want to play Kayla's again.

676
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,429
Rym: Yeah, I miss Kayla's.

677
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,500
Scott: I think I'd actually like to play a legacy game.

678
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,184
Scott: but the problem is the only legacy games are risk and pandemic.

679
00:41:50,486 --> 00:42:08,480
Rym: if there was something else legacy like Agricola legacy Everyone we know has seems to agree that if they played risk legacy or not race legacy pandemic legacy It's not the best game, but the pandemic problem is eliminated by the fact that it is just legacy.

680
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:19,393
Rym: It's more like you're playing this sort of adventure game together and then you react to stuff that happens and it's not the well Let's beat this very trivially optimized semi-random game again.

681
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:21,280
Scott: No, I just believe them.

682
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,553
Rym: We should play it and find out you don't know.

683
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:24,458
Scott: you go for it.

684
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,885
Rym: Yeah, so you're not gonna play it.

685
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:30,424
Rym: you tell me first and then maybe okay, but if I play it I'm not gonna play it again.

686
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,689
Rym: There's only play the game once.

687
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:34,460
Scott: Oh, you got a you know, but you got to play multiple sessions.

688
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,446
Scott: That's what the legacy is about.

689
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:36,190
Scott: So play the first set.

690
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,900
Rym: Yeah, you play the multiple sessions with the same people.

691
00:42:37,961 --> 00:42:38,324
Rym: I'm not gonna.

692
00:42:38,344 --> 00:42:40,260
Rym: I'm not gonna split up my group once I make a group.

693
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,574
Scott: Good luck getting the same people to shove every time.

694
00:42:43,238 --> 00:42:44,996
Rym: Ah I think I get some people to show up.

695
00:42:45,098 --> 00:42:47,873
Rym: actually I'm pretty sure we're gonna start up the burning wheel game again.

696
00:42:47,893 --> 00:42:49,360
Scott: No burning wheels a good idea.

697
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:50,446
Rym: You wanna play burning wheel.

698
00:42:50,788 --> 00:42:51,452
Rym: play my thief game.

699
00:42:51,472 --> 00:42:52,700
Scott: I don't play your thief game.

700
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:54,371
Rym: What game do you want to play burning wheel then?

701
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:54,915
Rym: Cuz that's the game.

702
00:42:54,955 --> 00:42:55,338
Rym: I'm running.

703
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,009
Scott: Yeah, actually gonna want to play not burning wheel RV.

704
00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:00,494
Rym: What RPG do you want to play?

705
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:01,658
Rym: I'll fucking run it for you.

706
00:43:01,678 --> 00:43:04,485
Scott: Jesus I don't want to play a game.

707
00:43:04,505 --> 00:43:05,068
Scott: Rym runs.

708
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:06,776
Scott: Why I just don't like you?

709
00:43:06,836 --> 00:43:07,540
Rym: what DM to you?

710
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,556
Rym: Who do you want to DM then?

711
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:13,960
Rym: What do you want like Luke crane to personally curate a custom RPG for you in your house.

712
00:43:14,182 --> 00:43:16,479
Scott: I wouldn't complain about that, but I'm not gonna ask for it either.

713
00:43:20,507 --> 00:43:25,872
Rym: Just not Rym Pretty much anyone else when I don't know if you've ever played in a game.

714
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:28,903
Rym: I DM'd I Can imagine.

715
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:30,732
Scott: I don't think you know, I know you've all know.

716
00:43:30,772 --> 00:43:31,415
Rym: you never have.

717
00:43:31,435 --> 00:43:32,400
Rym: you've never played in a game.

718
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:32,927
Rym: I've DM'd.

719
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:33,737
Rym: I don't think ever.

720
00:43:35,081 --> 00:43:35,705
Scott: Let's keep it that way.

721
00:43:35,765 --> 00:43:41,319
Rym: I played in your burning con game that one time Mmm, I also played in your door fortress game.

722
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:43,347
Rym: Then we'll never speak of again.

723
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:47,835
Scott: No, even though the last session was pretty good That's why I figured out how to make shit up.

724
00:43:48,217 --> 00:43:49,804
Scott: No No, it's.

725
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:52,056
Rym: I know what I'm doing now makes it up but also follow the rules.

726
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:52,619
Rym: That's how you do it.

727
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,768
Scott: Yeah, I wasn't making shit up before that last game.

728
00:43:54,808 --> 00:43:56,835
Rym: Yeah, so you want to play.

729
00:43:57,237 --> 00:43:58,020
Rym: what kind of RPG?

730
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,813
Rym: Do you want to play or who do you want to run?

731
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:00,459
Rym: What kind of DM?

732
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,102
Rym: Do you want?

733
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:02,569
Scott: I just kind of want to play like cuz.

734
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:06,184
Scott: I got so many indie RPGs that I bought and are on the Urban played.

735
00:44:06,204 --> 00:44:08,614
Scott: I don't want to play each one like one time each.

736
00:44:08,734 --> 00:44:09,277
Rym: I'm up for that.

737
00:44:09,337 --> 00:44:11,327
Rym: Like I got the Warren I'm pretty excited to run it.

738
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:11,769
Rym: Actually.

739
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:14,906
Rym: I could play a Warren once play the Warren So I don't want to play it once.

740
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:29,199
Rym: I want to play at least one short campaign because most Kind of like I'm not interested in the one-off RPG anymore because all the like advancement mechanics and legacy mechanics Those are the things that have always made RPGs really fun.

741
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:39,936
Scott: Yeah, I mean while I do agree that the campaign that goes on has gone forever I'm talking like six sessions has you know, much more power and quality than the one-off.

742
00:44:40,196 --> 00:44:41,220
Scott: There is no denying that.

743
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,378
Scott: It's just that I don't want to commit to anything.

744
00:44:45,122 --> 00:44:48,736
Rym: So your main complaint about other people is that they won't commit to anything.

745
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:49,660
Scott: That's also true.

746
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:52,072
Scott: But I'm also people that won't commit.

747
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:53,639
Rym: your complaint is about yourself.

748
00:44:54,423 --> 00:44:55,920
Rym: So do you want in the thief game or not?

749
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,440
Rym: Cuz I'm gonna start it up again as soon as the weather gets a little bit south like right after packs.

750
00:45:00,081 --> 00:45:02,557
Scott: Well, I mean after packs, it might be in a game mood again.

751
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:02,959
Scott: Who knows?

752
00:45:03,644 --> 00:45:04,088
Scott: I don't know.

753
00:45:04,108 --> 00:45:05,538
Rym: until then you're in the mood for anything.

754
00:45:07,463 --> 00:45:09,853
Scott: I mean laying in the Sun like I'd say.

755
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,260
Rym: you're missing the boat on overwatch.

756
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,369
Rym: But overwatch is only gaining steam like it's not slowing down.

757
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:15,211
Rym: It's expanding.

758
00:45:15,231 --> 00:45:17,096
Scott: I don't really want to play enough.

759
00:45:17,136 --> 00:45:18,159
Scott: Yeah, why not?

760
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,789
Scott: I mean, I just don't want to play enough.

761
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:21,172
Scott: Yes.

762
00:45:21,514 --> 00:45:25,091
Rym: So what what if tribes 2 was remade?

763
00:45:25,151 --> 00:45:28,040
Rym: but it had everything good about tribes 2?

764
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:33,699
Rym: Everything like it was perfect as far as our game design sensibilities were and it just came out again tomorrow.

765
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:35,549
Rym: But it was like tribes to 2016.

766
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:40,534
Scott: I Mean they did come out with those other tribes and then one of them I played like.

767
00:45:40,614 --> 00:45:41,438
Rym: those are all kind of bad.

768
00:45:41,882 --> 00:45:42,678
Rym: We knew they were bad.

769
00:45:43,402 --> 00:45:49,900
Rym: There's even a penny arcade talking about how like they'll get you through the night, but they're not a real substitute for tribes to.

770
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:52,565
Rym: I Weren't.

771
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:53,256
Rym: they were kind of bad.

772
00:45:54,161 --> 00:45:56,630
Scott: Maybe if I was in a given mood, I'm just nice not game time.

773
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:57,654
Scott: All right.

774
00:45:57,815 --> 00:45:58,478
Scott: I'll play pac-man.

775
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:01,068
Scott: Say pac-man championship edition - that's good.

776
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:02,213
Rym: That's just a single-player game.

777
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:03,700
Rym: I guess I'll play it enough to review it.

778
00:46:04,081 --> 00:46:04,523
Scott: I'll play it.

779
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:05,669
Rym: I'll play it to review it.

780
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:11,039
Scott: if it'll run on my ancient htpc Why would I think it's gonna run in pretty much any?

781
00:46:12,581 --> 00:46:13,244
Scott: X86 computer?

782
00:46:13,344 --> 00:46:13,726
Rym: I hope so.

783
00:46:13,746 --> 00:46:16,940
Rym: We'll find out because actually video ball a little bit of trouble on my htpc.

784
00:46:18,282 --> 00:46:26,996
Rym: Video ball runs way better on my main PC Which itself is not not a spring chicken compared to the htpc.

785
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:35,556
Rym: Remember the htpc is also 2009 era but it was less than a third the cost of my other PC 2009 era.

786
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,693
Scott: I mean mine's like i3 as a GPU.

787
00:46:38,794 --> 00:46:39,600
Scott: I would be nice.

788
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:44,179
Rym: I can't play 2d video of all the frame rate not as good as on my main PC.

789
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:45,506
Scott: I'll have to test it out.

790
00:46:45,647 --> 00:46:48,400
Rym: You should the game does not work a hundred percent great.

791
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,216
Scott: I mean now's the time to buy computers.

792
00:46:50,257 --> 00:46:57,400
Rym: So Yeah, it's either buy it now because if you buy a computer like six months from now, it's not gonna cost much less.

793
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,002
Scott: Well, you know what?

794
00:46:58,042 --> 00:46:58,424
Scott: It packs.

795
00:46:58,444 --> 00:47:02,320
Rym: You'll have less time with the new computer, you know, we're going to a packs.

796
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:05,833
Scott: We can go around to all those little booths with all the hardware vendors.

797
00:47:05,853 --> 00:47:08,412
Rym: That's what I did at the last packs We went to.

798
00:47:08,494 --> 00:47:09,684
Scott: well, yeah I keep that for some reason.

799
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:15,240
Scott: I keep doing that at packs and then even though I've done it packs like three or four Times I've never actually bought anything in there.

800
00:47:15,862 --> 00:47:17,187
Rym: But this time I don't buy things.

801
00:47:17,227 --> 00:47:18,913
Rym: what I do is I add them to my.

802
00:47:18,934 --> 00:47:21,222
Rym: I have that wish list that I'm constantly updating of the piece.

803
00:47:21,262 --> 00:47:31,998
Scott: I'm gonna go look at the small computer vendors like zotac and whatnot and try to see if I can get a htpc, maybe get like a 1070 in there and then I won't need another htpc for like ten years.

804
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:40,872
Rym: Yep but that's why you know, I chose what case I'm gonna build my new computer in because I poked at all the cases that a And the one that had the most marketing around.

805
00:47:40,912 --> 00:47:43,300
Rym: it happened to also be the easiest to use case.

806
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:47,997
Scott: I happen to fall for the marketing and then make an excuse as to why I didn't fall for the marketing.

807
00:47:48,037 --> 00:47:48,820
Scott: so I can believe that.

808
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,672
Scott: Continue to believe advertising did not work on me when it totally did

809
00:47:51,973 --> 00:48:00,339
Rym: now because there were others flashy booths But mostly those other pcs like those other cases were either like weird liquid cool bullshit that I don't

810
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:00,720
Scott: want

811
00:48:01,782 --> 00:48:02,989
Rym: or they were loud or

812
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:05,272
Scott: They

813
00:48:05,292 --> 00:48:06,075
Rym: were like really

814
00:48:06,155 --> 00:48:07,019
Scott: really heavy.

815
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:11,561
Scott: you can't judge the loudness on your impacts as you're in this giant loud room Every computer sounds quiet.

816
00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:12,830
Rym: No, I went out and read some reviews.

817
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:16,787
Rym: I mean what might have helped is that the one vendor we looked at like the one that like that case

818
00:48:16,828 --> 00:48:17,763
Scott: is in the quiet Area,

819
00:48:17,784 --> 00:48:27,389
Rym: yeah they were outside of the expo hall so I could stand next to it in a quiet area and see what it sounded like and It had like big stuff inside of it and it was not that loud.

820
00:48:28,211 --> 00:48:30,018
Rym: Hmm it also had that baffle in the front.

821
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:37,781
Rym: most of the cases that I looked at don't have the baffling and the baffle according to reviews Definitely decreases the noise substantially.

822
00:48:37,801 --> 00:48:43,070
Scott: Mm-hmm and That's what doesn't matter cuz you're gonna put a 1080 in there and it's gonna go.

823
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:48,124
Rym: So I'm not gonna get a 1080 yet because I want to.

824
00:48:48,465 --> 00:48:49,530
Scott: oh, I mean you just wait for one day.

825
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:50,722
Scott: There's no reason to buy anything.

826
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:57,530
Rym: any other GPU And I sorted basically by reviews and every day 1080 I would buy is sold out out of stock.

827
00:48:57,671 --> 00:49:00,750
Scott: Yeah, you just wait for them to come back in stock and use whatever GP you already have.

828
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:01,774
Rym: So I did some research.

829
00:49:02,056 --> 00:49:03,783
Rym: there are two quiet 1080s.

830
00:49:03,823 --> 00:49:04,064
Rym: Mm-hmm.

831
00:49:05,491 --> 00:49:07,740
Rym: They're real performant just like the other ones.

832
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:19,870
Rym: You know why they're quiet water cooling water cooling Yeah but the water cooling is built in to the card and it just has the Assembly with the radiators and you stick that in one of the radiator assembly spots in your case.

833
00:49:20,193 --> 00:49:21,403
Rym: But you have to get a modern case.

834
00:49:21,423 --> 00:49:25,424
Rym: Mm-hmm Like this case I got here does not does not support that kind of modern shit.

835
00:49:25,987 --> 00:49:37,238
Scott: Mm-hmm I've been doing my research the I gotta buy this PC real soon because like I said So there's a what is a pump for the liquid cooling on the GPU and you need to plug power into it from your power Supply.

836
00:49:37,299 --> 00:49:37,545
Scott: no

837
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:53,025
Rym: So basically so it looks like it works the same way as the CPU coolers where instead of a big heat sink fan thing You put you have the nubbin that is on the heat source and there's two tubes coming out of it And those tubes go to a block that has fans and radiators in it.

838
00:49:53,647 --> 00:49:54,310
Rym: It's like a square.

839
00:49:54,671 --> 00:50:02,870
Rym: it looks like two fans stuck to each other and Modern cases have multiple places where you put those like on the top inside or on the back inside.

840
00:50:03,352 --> 00:50:08,693
Rym: So they work as a case fan, but they're pulling the air over that thing Mm-hmm.

841
00:50:08,894 --> 00:50:11,484
Rym: That's pretty much how anyone who isn't crazy does it.

842
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:12,026
Rym: now.

843
00:50:12,066 --> 00:50:33,273
Rym: if you're crazy then you get a motherboard that supports that and instead of buying like All these like you don't buy like a CPU cooler that has its own fans and then a separate video card cooler to zone fans you buy a cooling rig that will connect to multiple devices with a larger loop and You have the cooling rig and the giant set of radiators but then it's

844
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:33,714
Scott: a loop.

845
00:50:33,754 --> 00:50:38,209
Scott: wouldn't you be sending like hot liquid from the CPU to the GPU and then to the cooler?

846
00:50:38,229 --> 00:50:41,581
Scott: and that's A bad idea when you want each one individually going to them.

847
00:50:41,922 --> 00:50:44,050
Rym: Well, it's sort of like it's like heat pipes.

848
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:48,990
Rym: They effectively act like heat pipes, so you're just pushing heat out of the system.

849
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:52,480
Rym: There's complicated.

850
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,024
Rym: I mean it's got.

851
00:50:53,065 --> 00:50:56,700
Rym: I'm not an expert But that's not a concern.

852
00:50:57,102 --> 00:50:58,005
Scott: Don't you still need a pump?

853
00:50:58,025 --> 00:50:59,009
Scott: and doesn't the pump make noise?

854
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,890
Rym: Oh, yeah, quiet pumps cost so much fucking more than loud ones.

855
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:10,150
Rym: Oh like it's ridiculous, but basically reading the reviews like if you buy a cheap pump either, you know what you're doing or God help you.

856
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:26,250
Rym: But the crazy ones like the crazy people and I don't I'm not doing this The motherboard will have two little holes in it on the back and you plug Like you basically plug your pump system into that and it cools the motherboard itself.

857
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:31,819
Rym: So like all the bridges and all the things that have like, you know Your motherboard is like heat sinks all over it

858
00:51:32,262 --> 00:51:44,850
Scott: and like I mean for something like this I think you're gonna like have to not build your PC and just find someone who put you got a Compatible motherboard case CPU cooler GPU cooler that all work together and put them together for you in advance.

859
00:51:45,112 --> 00:51:48,119
Rym: Well, I've been doing my research and instead of that It seems like the way to go.

860
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:52,290
Scott: if you can take care all the other parts But it's like the GPU the motherboard the CPU and the case.

861
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:56,469
Scott: I mean You could put that together for you and then you do everything else to roll your own.

862
00:51:57,092 --> 00:51:57,735
Rym: You have to have.

863
00:51:57,775 --> 00:51:58,779
Rym: you have to put in the remember.

864
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:03,940
Rym: when we were kids like before we knew shit and we'd like research building a Computer like in high school my computer shopping magazine.

865
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,952
Rym: Yeah, you you would have to do that level of research Like you've been.

866
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:19,265
Rym: you basically have to spend the amount of time that I spent in high school in college learning about like specific detailed computer component integration shit to build a modern computer.

867
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:25,309
Rym: roll your own with modern liquid cooling and As an adult, there's no way in fucking hell that I'm gonna do that.

868
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:33,056
Rym: So the options are either do what you said or buy all the components from the same company and they pretty much just work together Mmm, so like.

869
00:52:33,558 --> 00:52:36,230
Rym: but if you buy a case from like the people I want to buy that case from.

870
00:52:36,894 --> 00:52:39,289
Rym: Only buy the cooling stuff that that company also makes.

871
00:52:39,309 --> 00:52:46,815
Scott: well I'm sure at pecs we could go to say the Cooler Master booth and we could be like up buy those four things that we See assembled right there before us.

872
00:52:47,036 --> 00:52:51,690
Rym: people on the internet seemed to hint that Cooler Master is overpriced and not great.

873
00:52:51,871 --> 00:52:55,450
Scott: I'm sure it isn't but I'm just that's just an example of a brand.

874
00:52:55,550 --> 00:53:00,199
Scott: I'm sure you can go to the new egg booth the Intel booth no highs no lows Just Cooler Master.

875
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:11,570
Scott: you could go to any of the booths Right of hardware vendors and they will have at least one setup computer That has demonstrating this technology that you could look at and say yeah, I'll buy those four things.

876
00:53:12,153 --> 00:53:14,730
Rym: But I also I poked it overwatch.

877
00:53:14,872 --> 00:53:20,186
Rym: I turned a bunch of settings down to get my frame rate up because I'm actually there's a little bit of a frame rate issue.

878
00:53:20,207 --> 00:53:24,460
Rym: just you know, My computer is pretty old and Yeah, I need a new computer.

879
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:32,310
Rym: Mm-hmm I really need a new computer because it is PC gaming season because the other thing I'm playing pretty much constantly is Civ 5.

880
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,474
Rym: Now, I know the videos are going up.

881
00:53:33,515 --> 00:53:36,264
Scott: pretty sure you can play Civ 5 on any computer.

882
00:53:36,324 --> 00:53:37,910
Rym: Civ 5 I can play on my laptop.

883
00:53:39,371 --> 00:53:44,370
Rym: But I've been playing a lot of Civ 5 and you guys seem to like the videos are putting up of our games.

884
00:53:45,592 --> 00:53:56,542
Rym: I'm gonna start putting those up a lot faster because we've blown through multiple further games beyond the ones that I've got up on YouTube so far and I kind of want to start one of those up again with Scott.

885
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:57,668
Rym: So you want to do it?

886
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:02,249
Rym: No, not really not even not even if we make it with two AI.

887
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:09,421
Rym: So it's not just like a stupid donut duel on a bullshit math Where I put like one unit between you and the city-state and game over.

888
00:54:09,441 --> 00:54:14,413
Scott: I mean, that's better, but it's still not that exciting Not exciting.

889
00:54:14,454 --> 00:54:14,976
Rym: It's like it's.

890
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:18,790
Rym: you take one turn of a complicated German board game every day or so.

891
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,078
Rym: Yeah, I mean I've got four.

892
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:23,923
Scott: I'm not even like reading webcomics lately.

893
00:54:24,104 --> 00:54:26,110
Rym: I've got four GM our games going now.

894
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:31,728
Rym: They're all like gigantic and it takes maybe ten minutes out of my day every other day or so.

895
00:54:31,789 --> 00:54:35,070
Rym: tops Cuz with eight players like people don't take the turns that fast.

896
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:39,116
Scott: meh Nah, I'm actually like glad.

897
00:54:39,157 --> 00:54:48,054
Scott: I just you know quit that other game because it's like how much time would I spend on it by Now, I don't know how this is like that episode of Seinfeld where Kramer's like Well, how do you?

898
00:54:48,074 --> 00:54:56,550
Rym: it takes me like two hours to take a shower and just saw Jerry's like, uh You're spending way too much time in the shower and he needs help because he's spending too much time in the shower.

899
00:54:56,912 --> 00:54:59,290
Rym: Was it that situation like how much time do you spend on your turns?

900
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:02,282
Scott: I look at every city and then gonna move every unit.

901
00:55:02,543 --> 00:55:07,850
Scott: Yeah, so like two minutes tops And look at all that, you know every possible thing that's going on.

902
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:09,394
Rym: Yeah, so three minutes.

903
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:17,059
Rym: if you also like look at the crazy deep arcane bullshit and like rearrange great people production and then you know Try enough like different combinations.

904
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:19,910
Rym: I just take my turn and go I don't redo my turn anymore at all.

905
00:55:20,393 --> 00:55:22,448
Scott: Mmm, you know got to see what's going on.

906
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:28,811
Rym: The only time I ever redo my turn is if I sometimes you miss click and a guy moves cuz you've meant to click somewhere Else.

907
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:35,730
Rym: then I redo my turn cuz I'm not going to eat the fact that I moved a cellar to the wrong spot next to a barbarian.

908
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,622
Rym: I'm gonna restart my turn if I do that But I never like.

909
00:55:39,844 --> 00:55:40,228
Rym: I don't like.

910
00:55:41,552 --> 00:55:45,048
Rym: And then oh that didn't work out and do the war again cuz no nobody's got time for that.

911
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:45,490
Rym: I just play.

912
00:55:47,416 --> 00:55:49,757
Rym: hmm No, you know don't want to play that.

913
00:55:49,797 --> 00:55:51,082
Rym: Danny to two minutes.

914
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,350
Rym: two minutes every other day can't handle it.

915
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:57,060
Scott: It's also you got to keep sieve like open on your computer.

916
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,190
Rym: You know, it boots in like 30 seconds tops.

917
00:56:00,371 --> 00:56:02,362
Rym: I just hit play and then some pops up.

918
00:56:02,382 --> 00:56:03,608
Rym: then I take my turn and I close it.

919
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,999
Scott: Even though my computer is way faster sieve does not boot quickly.

920
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:12,540
Rym: how Scott my sieve is on a spinning disk On say to three.

921
00:56:12,862 --> 00:56:14,429
Rym: I've got 12 gigs of RAM.

922
00:56:15,132 --> 00:56:15,473
Rym: Like.

923
00:56:16,035 --> 00:56:18,003
Rym: in fact sieve is not only on a spinning disk.

924
00:56:18,364 --> 00:56:19,830
Rym: It's on my system partition.

925
00:56:20,552 --> 00:56:22,379
Rym: How is my computer faster than yours?

926
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:27,081
Scott: and if your computer isn't faster than mine, but sieve does not boot up quickly Boots up pretty quick.

927
00:56:27,222 --> 00:56:28,269
Rym: I don't leave sieve running.

928
00:56:29,193 --> 00:56:33,919
Rym: Like sieve boots up quicker than overwatch does Mmm, it's not boot up quickly.

929
00:56:33,959 --> 00:56:34,281
Scott: made them.

930
00:56:34,301 --> 00:56:35,808
Scott: do I have more sieve stuff than you.

931
00:56:35,868 --> 00:56:36,190
Scott: I don't know.

932
00:56:37,591 --> 00:56:44,330
Rym: I'm playing games that have like eight player like giant nonsense late-game like bullshit going on.

933
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:48,739
Rym: In fact when I'm in the game It takes a long time for the turn to load.

934
00:56:48,819 --> 00:56:55,303
Rym: now because the game is just so big there's so much stuff Hmm.

935
00:56:55,324 --> 00:56:56,450
Scott: Oh, it sits on the screen.

936
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:01,550
Scott: That's like Civ 5 logo with all the shit in the background before the main menu comes up for a long time.

937
00:57:01,731 --> 00:57:03,050
Rym: Yeah, are you on an SSD?

938
00:57:04,311 --> 00:57:05,977
Rym: No, no, that's part of it I guess.

939
00:57:06,077 --> 00:57:08,044
Rym: but I mean I'm not on an SSD.

940
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:10,878
Scott: I install all my steam games on this Spinning disk.

941
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:12,390
Scott: It's like I colon slash steam.

942
00:57:12,651 --> 00:57:19,350
Rym: I installed overwatch and a couple other games on my third SSD the one that I bought a while ago cuz they were cheap.

943
00:57:19,511 --> 00:57:20,377
Scott: Maybe I'll move it to SSD.

944
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:20,941
Scott: I don't know.

945
00:57:21,123 --> 00:57:21,747
Rym: Yeah, that might help.

946
00:57:22,952 --> 00:57:26,550
Rym: Will you play a two player with two AI Civ game again?

947
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:30,935
Rym: Once it starts raining and is cold again in the winter It's gotta be.

948
00:57:31,016 --> 00:57:33,090
Scott: if I'm in a gaming mood, I'll probably want to play all the games.

949
00:57:34,771 --> 00:57:36,301
Rym: What'll it take to be in a gaming mood again?

950
00:57:36,502 --> 00:57:39,075
Scott: gaming season, which is current I mean, I'm not baking anything either.

951
00:57:39,115 --> 00:57:41,685
Scott: why cuz it's caught out and I'm gonna turn my fucking oven on.

952
00:57:41,846 --> 00:57:42,850
Rym: cuz I got a concern.

953
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:45,232
Rym: what if you're?

954
00:57:45,352 --> 00:57:48,145
Rym: you're the noble from far away who comes back to play.

955
00:57:48,185 --> 00:57:51,052
Rym: go at the Capitol and Everyone surpassed you.

956
00:57:51,713 --> 00:57:55,358
Scott: so what then?

957
00:57:55,398 --> 00:57:56,580
Rym: it won't be team room and Scott anymore.

958
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:00,115
Rym: I gotta get a team over someone else to have the guaranteed joint victory or 50/50 shot.

959
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:03,500
Scott: What have you ever actually teamed up with?

960
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:09,693
Rym: We got to keep the illusion up that we never team up But really I want one of us to to win because fuck everybody else.

961
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:11,340
Scott: You've never teamed up with me ever.

962
00:58:12,243 --> 00:58:15,659
Rym: You're the one who attacks me out of nowhere Usually like make sure you don't win.

963
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:21,500
Rym: Like look the last board game that you and I actually played together of the we were playing Hanza, right?

964
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,586
Rym: Yeah, and what'd you do immediately?

965
00:58:24,606 --> 00:58:29,500
Rym: You use the item to just attack me all over the board and played as fast as possible.

966
00:58:30,263 --> 00:58:30,909
Rym: Who won that game?

967
00:58:30,929 --> 00:58:32,542
Scott: I Don't remember.

968
00:58:32,562 --> 00:58:33,446
Rym: You really don't remember that.

969
00:58:33,506 --> 00:58:36,380
Rym: I won by so much that not everyone even counted up their scores.

970
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:38,040
Scott: I mean you could be sad even remember.

971
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:40,367
Scott: We don't remember so I have no idea.

Rym: other people are in that game.

1003
01:02:13,922 --> 01:02:18,280
Rym: They are non-productive and must be abolished.

1004
