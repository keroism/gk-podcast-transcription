8
00:00:33,764 --> 00:00:39,360
Rym: I don't think I have actually seen Pete and Pete since I haven't seen like a whole episode, but I seen a clip.

Scott: I don't remember.

12
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:47,960
Rym: Well, you should remember that I remember enough.

13
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:50,972
Rym: I remember very clearly because it was on TV many many times.

14
00:00:51,012 --> 00:00:52,619
Rym: I think I was sick and I just kept seeing it.

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,035
Rym: It's the one where he's Pete as opposed to Pete is mowing the side of the freeway.

16
00:00:58,215 --> 00:00:59,499
Rym: Yep, trying to blow up cars.

00:00:59,639 --> 00:00:59,960
Scott: classic.

18
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:02,144
Scott: Yeah How about the Hoover Dam?

19
00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:04,652
Scott: Oh my god classic the roof stack.

20
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:06,900
Rym: I think I really like the one with the lunar eclipse.

21
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:08,517
Scott: No, he has a good one, too.

22
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:11,928
Scott: Or the the times the daylight savings time.

23
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:14,577
Rym: Oh, but he's trying to race and stay in the same time.

24
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:21,291
Scott: Yeah Anyway, so, you know, I always say right that You know, it's like I got a big trade-off, right?

25
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:28,080
Scott: It's like aha all these people in the world They suffer from chronic back pain, but I will not suffer from pain.

26
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,567
Scott: I will have a hunch instead.

27
00:01:29,628 --> 00:01:31,296
Scott: but be pain-free until maybe I'm old.

28
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:33,531
Rym: but Scott I point out I'm also pain-free.

29
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:34,539
Rym: nor do I have a hunch?

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,107
Scott: I'm just saying neither what.

31
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:39,867
Rym: it's possible to have no hunch And do not have back pain.

32
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:43,140
Rym: the people who have back pain don't have it for their lack of hunching.

33
00:01:45,423 --> 00:01:47,039
Rym: They have it because they don't bend their knees.

34
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,656
Scott: But anyway, I have suffered my first back pain.

35
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:55,450
Rym: Oh back injury You know, it's funny because I did hurt my back my entire life.

36
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:56,834
Scott: It is now I have.

37
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,741
Rym: now it is hurting Scott You know what?

38
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,786
Rym: This means we're officially old.

39
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:04,916
Rym: Oh, no because my whole life I would like fall off cliffs.

40
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:09,273
Rym: bicycle spoke through the leg Cushion and I never like.

41
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,620
Rym: I just bounced back like the next day.

42
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:23,990
Rym: I'd be fine Yeah, and then you know last week when I got food poisoning and I fell over backwards vomiting so hard that I threw my back out My back hurt for like two weeks really - we okay Cuz like I don't know I didn't actually do.

43
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,540
Scott: at least remember doing anything that injured the back, right?

44
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:27,124
Scott: But it's like.

45
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:29,056
Rym: I know exactly what you did but nothing.

46
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:30,901
Rym: hunching It's.

47
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,788
Scott: but the thing is it's on the low back.

48
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,354
Scott: It's not in the upper hunch area.

49
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:35,980
Scott: It's like way low.

50
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,350
Scott: It's like where my tail would be if I had a tail.

51
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:40,620
Rym: Yeah, that's where most back pain ends up being.

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,528
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, it's like you know where you should go Spock hassle.

53
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:47,780
Rym: Yeah, cuz my back pain actually went away completely after Spock hassle.

54
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:49,691
Scott: Yeah, I could definitely use something like that cuz they.

55
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:51,260
Rym: I mean there's some Randy in there.

56
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,719
Rym: You gotta stay away from the Randy, but there's also just jets of water that pound your back for free.

57
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:56,664
Scott: Yeah, I'll take that.

58
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:57,006
Scott: Yeah.

59
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:57,307
Scott: Yeah.

60
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:00,664
Scott: But anyway, it's like I woke up like a couple mornings ago And it was just not good.

61
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:04,180
Scott: And then I went to bed last night and I woke up and it was still not good.

62
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:04,822
Scott: I was like what.

63
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,708
Rym: that's the first sign of being old.

64
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:10,200
Rym: when there's pain that is there one day and it's still there.

65
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,446
Rym: Then it's like usually.

66
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:14,279
Scott: usually you're gonna go to bed and wake up and it's gonna be gone.

67
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:23,357
Rym: I think the primary example of youth is that when I was a kid like when I would get hangovers like okay I got a hangover in the morning afternoon fine or really sick feeling.

68
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:26,153
Rym: go to sleep You'll feel a hundred percent like new the next day.

69
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,360
Rym: It's not true anymore.

70
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:28,243
Scott: No, I'm gonna.

71
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:31,536
Scott: I'm gonna do big sleep if I still have it for anime.

72
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:32,320
Scott: Boston's gonna be trouble.

73
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:34,972
Scott: I gotta carry my luggage around now.

74
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:37,663
Rym: You should get wheely luggage Like a sissy.

75
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:43,560
Scott: you mean like everyone who travels except one see the thing is the people with wheely luggage are permanent sissies.

76
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,386
Scott: I'm only a part-time sissy.

77
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:47,694
Scott: I have been temporarily sissified.

78
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:51,570
Scott: as soon as I'm getting rid of this pain I will no longer need really like.

79
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:58,603
Rym: I point out that had you had wheely luggage You might not have slammed into that obstacle Shows.

80
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:00,413
Scott: even less of a sissy I am.

81
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:04,624
Scott: I get slammed right into an obstacle breaker of Infrastructure.

82
00:04:04,805 --> 00:04:07,858
Rym: I will continue to use my wheely luggage sissy.

83
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:12,497
Rym: So it's Tuesday, it's tourist season.

84
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:15,244
Scott: yeah That's all I'm gonna say.

85
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:15,967
Scott: kill all tourists.

86
00:04:15,987 --> 00:04:18,860
Rym: They've actually been pretty well behaved by me not by me.

87
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:21,769
Rym: Low as balls the people.

88
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:22,311
Scott: I even took.

89
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:25,080
Scott: I took a train to Fairfield last night to go to my parents house.

90
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:29,180
Scott: I was walking down the ramp to go from the train platform to the the card.

91
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:31,228
Scott: You know my dad was sitting in the car like you do.

92
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:34,259
Scott: old lady in front of me slow in Fairfield tourist in front of me.

93
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:36,372
Rym: She might have just been old.

94
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:37,398
Scott: That's that's enough.

95
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,545
Scott: Also the connect.

96
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:43,520
Scott: I didn't actually get on one of these trains, but Connecticut is a new trains on the New Haven line.

97
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:45,157
Scott: I've heard very nice.

98
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:53,479
Rym: Yeah, one of my co-workers used to live in Manhattan moved out there, and he's like yeah, the trains nice, but fuck this.

99
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,839
Scott: yeah Yeah, I'm sad, but the trains are nice at least.

100
00:04:57,741 --> 00:05:06,650
Rym: So only it won't be that long till we find out who's in Jane McGonigal's take or fight the future find the future That event we talked about that thing of the day, so yeah, I applied.

101
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,420
Rym: I think tomorrow is the last day to apply.

102
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,268
Rym: All right, so if you want to be in that game you'd better apply now.

103
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:17,699
Scott: Well, I mean anyone can play.

104
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,192
Rym: It's just if you want to be overnight do if you want to be one of the immortal 500.

105
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:26,847
Scott: Yeah anyway Is that it for opening bits?

106
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,573
Rym: I guess you're supposed to.

107
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:30,260
Rym: we're supposed to have a smooth transition.

108
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:32,950
Scott: Well, you know after hundreds of smooth transitions.

109
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,700
Scott: We can have one non smooth transition now.

110
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,468
Rym: So that'll be the thing.

111
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:39,384
Rym: non smooth transition It can be.

112
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,034
Scott: it can be smooth in its lack of smoothness.

113
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:42,858
Scott: It's gonna be smooth.

114
00:05:42,878 --> 00:05:47,573
Rym: intentionally Unsmooth you mean like when black dynamite glances up at that microphone.

115
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:49,438
Rym: That's hanging down from the boom in shot.

116
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:49,900
Scott: That's right.

117
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:55,331
Scott: So I got sort of a news slash geek bite together.

118
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:58,860
Scott: right there's this game that came out called the ace of spades.

119
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:01,493
Rym: Ah the game that we couldn't get the server working.

120
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,646
Scott: I've gotten it to work a few times I mean last.

121
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,635
Rym: I thought I didn't get that.

122
00:06:04,676 --> 00:06:09,320
Scott: well I didn't get the server to work personally, but I've played it on someone else's server a few times.

123
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,619
Rym: So how come they can get it working, but you can I?

124
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:20,454
Scott: Because they were at RIT Yeah, but anyway my Counter-Strike servers still broken.

125
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:22,420
Rym: so yeah, I get something running anyway.

126
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:25,399
Scott: So this game basically is the kind of thing I've been asking for.

127
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,054
Scott: It's basically that the core concept of it is very strong.

128
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:30,660
Scott: this game has good fundamentals, right?

129
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,041
Scott: Which is?

130
00:06:31,462 --> 00:06:36,900
Scott: it's like Minecraft you can break blocks and you can put blocks and you can put blocks of any color you want.

131
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:38,680
Scott: Right and every block is just a block.

132
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,532
Scott: There's no difference between one block and another block.

133
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:51,008
Scott: everything is just the same And you also have a gun Right and the gun kills people and both sides of the map have an intelligence that you're trying to protect And you're also trying to capture the other guys.

134
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:52,496
Scott: intelligence right.

135
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:57,806
Scott: so Fundamentally, it's capture the flag with blocks Which is pretty damn good.

136
00:06:57,826 --> 00:07:05,812
Scott: the problem with the game is that it has some mechanic you know Technological shortcomings right in that the networking you know fails.

137
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,940
Rym: Why does no one get this right?

138
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,072
Scott: Understand the thing is they've actually gotten it right into where.

139
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:15,840
Scott: once the server is working properly And you're connected to it properly it does work really well.

140
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,015
Rym: I actually heard a lot of people complaining about the fact that there's no sort of.

141
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:26,880
Rym: it appears that there's no Prediction of movement that you have to lead your shots based on lag not based on movement.

142
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:32,120
Scott: Well if there is someone who is incredibly laggy, then yes, you do have to maybe figure it out.

143
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:44,134
Rym: I've always been of the mind and maybe it's just because I've never in my life Had a high ping that if you have to choose between punishing the high ping bastards and the low ping bastards Fuck the high ping bastards.

144
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:44,700
Scott: That's right.

145
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:52,123
Scott: You should punish the lag guy not the not the guy with no leg, but anyway the thing is the gun in the game is actually Stupidly accurate.

146
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:54,088
Scott: like there is no scatter or cone shot.

147
00:07:54,129 --> 00:08:02,464
Scott: you click and the bullet goes infinitely in that direction that you clicked precisely where the crosshair was and Immediately so you shit.

148
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:08,622
Scott: you click to style you click on a guy and as soon as you click blood pops out of him like Right.

149
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:10,348
Scott: It's like if you click on him you got him.

150
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:11,873
Scott: the gun is a sniper rifle.

151
00:08:12,174 --> 00:08:14,583
Scott: That is has no you know There's no recoil.

152
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:19,100
Scott: There's no nothing right and it has a slow rate of fire, but you can just like bam bam.

153
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,259
Scott: And so the problem is the game has fog.

154
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:28,198
Scott: So the thing is if you can see someone through the fog you can shoot him But if they're if you can't see them it becomes hard to shoot him.

155
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:29,344
Scott: But eat.

156
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:33,602
Scott: don't let that fool you though because sometimes you won't see someone through the fog But you'll.

157
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:44,207
Scott: they'll see you when you were in the fog and you'll recede into the fog thinking you ran away from them But they just keep shooting right where they last saw you Because ammo is basically almost infinite.

158
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:47,820
Rym: god if we didn't have anime Boston coming up I would have been playing some of that.

159
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,720
Scott: No, I'd be playing portal to which I only was able to play one chapter.

160
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,580
Rym: Oh, yeah, but it's only gonna take us eight hours to beat portal.

161
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,600
Scott: Well, you got to play it twice because it's a co-op game and a single-player game.

162
00:08:56,961 --> 00:09:02,016
Rym: I heard I heard eight hours for single-player and then another four or five for the co-op whatever.

163
00:09:02,036 --> 00:09:13,078
Scott: It's quality hours Yeah, anyway, but yeah ace of spades the game has some you know problems in its details You know when it's technology, and it definitely needs a lot more polishing and embellishing.

164
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:21,357
Rym: well I would say that the the problems that appears to have by and large are very similar to the problems that were never solved in The old quick two mods that I like.

165
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:24,050
Scott: yeah But the fundamentals of the game are very sound.

166
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,600
Scott: and the thing is I'm already seeing emerging gameplay for example.

167
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:27,873
Scott: It's just one example.

168
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:28,399
Scott: then we'll move on.

169
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:33,420
Scott: When you're hoping you you you start with 50 blocks and you can place blocks wherever you want.

170
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,199
Scott: Right and you can make the blocks any color you want.

171
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:46,020
Scott: so what you can do is you can right-click on any block on the screen and Then it'll change the color of the block you're holding to match the color of the block you clicked.

172
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:55,358
Scott: Uh-huh, and there's a mini map in the game that you press M to look at the map And it gives you a basically a perfect overhead view of the game.

173
00:09:55,479 --> 00:10:01,120
Scott: perfect All right, so you see pretty much every pixel of the whole map from a directly straight down overhead view.

174
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,940
Scott: So the intelligence on the map is like a blue square or a green square.

175
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:08,875
Scott: So lay down some blocks in a blue square or a green square of the same dimensions.

176
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:14,053
Scott: and now the other team sees two Intelligences and if they're stupid they don't know which one is which that is.

177
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:16,020
Rym: that is right up there with my bro.

178
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:17,567
Scott: See another example.

179
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:20,480
Scott: right go to where you to make bridges to go over the water faster.

180
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:23,120
Scott: Right because swimming in the water is kind of slow and troublesome.

181
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:27,460
Scott: But if you make a bridge then you're in business But you don't want the other team to see where your bridges are.

182
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:38,574
Scott: So what you do is when you're making a bridge you jump in the water and you make every brick of the bridge you Use the right-click to make it the same color as the water underneath and you get Indiana Jones bridges Yeah, and no one can see them on the map.

183
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:39,480
Scott: It just looks like water.

184
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:46,660
Scott: But when your team actually is standing right there It's pretty easy to see the bridge from the side just like the Indiana Jones bridge is easy to see from the side.

185
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:48,304
Rym: See I love it's.

186
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:57,059
Rym: I realized that I like first generation emergent gameplay, but I often dislike second-generation simulacra of emergent gameplay.

187
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:02,560
Rym: La I think the best example is bunny hopping was kind of a fluke in early quake games.

188
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:04,579
Scott: But but you don't like skiing and tribes.

189
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:10,120
Rym: Well, but that thing is skiing in tribes like bunny hopping was at least like it was done.

190
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:11,979
Rym: Well, but it's very hard to do that.

191
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:21,424
Rym: Most games that try to simulate some sort of errant or emergent behavior from previous games end up duplicating it perfectly rather than Duplicating the intent.

192
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:25,356
Rym: and when you duplicate it perfectly you get here is a fucking new earth.

193
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:28,006
Scott: Yep Anyway, so what you got?

194
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,917
Rym: So the nation of Armenia has what is it?

195
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:31,680
Scott: Are they playing games?

196
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,562
Scott: What is it?

197
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:38,240
Rym: they have decided that chess is now compulsory in all primary education schools.

198
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:40,894
Rym: Chess is a class just like math and everything else.

199
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:41,900
Rym: That's okay.

200
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:43,824
Rym: Here's what I want to say.

201
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:46,032
Rym: I think the concept is great.

202
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:48,260
Scott: I think that game chess is the wrong choice.

203
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:50,188
Rym: Let me finish that.

204
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:52,740
Rym: games and analytical thinking and things like this.

205
00:11:53,282 --> 00:12:00,888
Rym: I feel like a lot of students in school learn more innately from their music classes their art classes Their chess classes.

206
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:04,487
Rym: then they do from a lot of their math and science Even if they don't learn it directly.

207
00:12:04,687 --> 00:12:07,880
Scott: being in those classes has been shown in many studies to enhance.

208
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:09,739
Scott: You know what you learn in the other classes.

209
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:12,570
Scott: You're in band, you know, you're gonna learn.

210
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:18,171
Scott: you're gonna be smarter and learn more in math, you know Even though you you know might not necessarily learn about music more.

211
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,917
Rym: Yes, exactly what I was saying.

212
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:33,298
Rym: So But gaming in particular I mean remember Jane McGonigal's talk from Pax and what a lot of researchers say time and time again that play is One of the primary methods that mammals learn anything.

213
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:37,480
Rym: Yep I mean, it's the way that hunting instincts and predation instincts are passed on.

214
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,960
Scott: Are you saying you want a school where people do nothing but play games all day?

215
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Rym: I'm saying that gaming needs to be more tightly integrated with education.

216
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,149
Rym: Of course, and I've been saying that for a long time and every now and then we get a tiny Glimmer, I mean someone who gets it.

217
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,080
Scott: It wasn't completely absent from our education.

218
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,911
Scott: We played Oregon Trail and you know all sorts of stuff.

219
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:56,080
Rym: We never played Oregon Trail officially.

220
00:12:56,241 --> 00:13:00,180
Rym: It was just there in the computer lab and the smart kids played it instead of doing their work.

221
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,617
Scott: No gaming was there in my schooling from nursery school to 12th grade.

222
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,340
Rym: There was games going on but not as much as there should be not as tightly integrated with the education.

223
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:09,843
Rym: It was nothing.

224
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:12,920
Scott: there could have been very active there could have been more but there was still plenty of gaming.

225
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,185
Scott: I mean word munchers in kindergarten.

226
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:17,199
Rym: I mean was your assignment to play Oregon Trail or was it just on the computer?

227
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:22,577
Scott: No, I'm pretty sure it was just on the computer, but there was nothing to do on the computer but play games.

228
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:28,360
Rym: Yeah Well, usually they'd give you some assignment like alright type this document in this word processor.

229
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,757
Rym: I never just sit there.

230
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:36,767
Rym: So all the smart kids would just go to the shared drive get the document the teacher typed up Send it back to him and then play games for an hour.

231
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:42,880
Rym: Mmm, but the thing I take issue with is that They're about 50 years too late.

232
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,220
Rym: I don't think chess is the game that should be used because I don't think chess is a good teaching tool at all.

233
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,966
Rym: No chess is too abstract.

234
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:58,520
Scott: if there's too high of a barrier to skilled play I think the reason they're doing it is they just want to have an Armenian be like the chess champion of the world.

235
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,627
Scott: They don't want to miss anybody.

236
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:00,734
Scott: That's all about national.

237
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:03,573
Rym: I Actually think it's a little deeper than that.

238
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:11,120
Rym: I think that there's a recognition I mean most people associate chess with smart people that people who play chess tend to be smart.

239
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,321
Rym: They.

240
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:14,640
Rym: they know that chess is an abstraction of war that there's strategy involved.

241
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:24,200
Rym: It has all the trappings of the things you would actually want to teach children on a fundamental level But it does self-reliance analytical thinking and it does have all those things.

242
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:29,320
Rym: I just don't think it is nearly as good a teaching tool as say a lot of the German style board games.

243
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,506
Scott: Of course, why don't they?

244
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:39,280
Scott: what they should do is I don't understand how you're gonna have a required class But for every possible grade, so you're gonna play chess as a class every year for your whole schooling from campus.

245
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:41,008
Rym: I don't know the exact details of it.

246
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:43,800
Scott: Yeah, because it's like that's a lot of chess to be playing.

247
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,139
Scott: Why don't you they should mix it up?

248
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,173
Scott: There should be basically game class where you play serious games of all sorts.

249
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:53,648
Rym: go chess Puerto Rico I would just call the class strategy.

250
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:55,934
Scott: That's a good class or analytical thinking.

251
00:14:56,055 --> 00:14:56,496
Scott: Why not?

252
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:57,740
Scott: Sure go for it.

253
00:14:57,862 --> 00:15:02,500
Rym: Yeah portal Do but I mean we did a panel on this.

254
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,074
Rym: But basically I think my main argument the reason why chess and go don't work.

255
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:10,484
Rym: and the same reason why a lot of video games Don't actually work.

256
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:21,000
Rym: and sports and everything is that these particular types of board games the not wholly abstracted You know German or euro style games tend to be very focused and tend to reduce randomness.

257
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:45,459
Rym: but more importantly because of the mechanical constraints of the game and the fact that they are a Kind of direct analogy of the real world You can hold the entire state of the game in your head to a reasonable degree that the like the actual number of different decisions you're making is Fairly constrained and you can have a board game that you teach to kids Where they play it and the smarter of them will solve it by the end of the class.

258
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:55,780
Rym: And I think there's a lot more actual learning going on at least practical learning because chess will teach you to be a better chess player and Maybe it'll teach you some pattern recognition.

259
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,743
Rym: But I don't know.

260
00:15:56,763 --> 00:16:01,157
Rym: playing modern art will teach you evaluation and mind reading and all sort of fighters.

261
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:03,345
Scott: Street Fighter is important Starcraft why not?

262
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:05,332
Rym: Yeah, but Street Fighter and Starcraft?

263
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:16,399
Rym: because they're not mechanical They're more mathematically complex and have a much broader Decision matrix in them and as a result I think they're less good as direct teaching tools because there's no.

264
00:16:17,122 --> 00:16:21,460
Rym: The answer key is not as useful to a student's progress as it is in say, Puerto Rico.

265
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,770
Scott: It will if you want to actually produce people who are gonna be professional gamers.

266
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,380
Rym: I think that should be a separate branch of education.

267
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:31,028
Scott: Hey, they have a gym classes required.

268
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:32,392
Scott: They're trying to make professional athlete.

269
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:33,877
Rym: No, they're not trying to make professional.

270
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:34,740
Scott: Maybe they should.

271
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:38,419
Scott: You got to start young if you want even have a chance.

272
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:48,038
Rym: so things of the day hobo Nichols.

273
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,189
Rym: Nichols made by hobos.

274
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:53,640
Scott: Oh, they took nickel and they minted it.

275
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:58,682
Rym: Possibly do that in the early part of the 1900s.

276
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:10,064
Rym: there be there's a movement of not really a movement but kind of an art form that was popularized Called the hobo nickel where people would take Nichols particularly later on via that Buffalo nickel and just carve Reliefs into them.

277
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:11,047
Rym: make them so kind of.

278
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:17,153
Scott: you need a pretty serious tool to carve into the nickel right with any efficiency No more than you need for any sort of metal sculpting.

279
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:18,660
Scott: Yeah, what would you use like a chisel?

280
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,542
Scott: It's like would you?

281
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:22,579
Rym: yeah nowadays people use dremels and things but a dremel would work.

282
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:24,166
Rym: I mean hobos did this Scott.

283
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,051
Rym: It's not that hard.

284
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:28,165
Rym: Nichols are actually not that Strong either.

285
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:29,471
Scott: they never actually tried to.

286
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:31,058
Rym: you know, try to deface a nickel.

287
00:17:31,078 --> 00:17:35,037
Rym: It won't take you I could deface a nickel with a dime if I really wanted.

288
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:37,992
Rym: I don't know I'm right here.

289
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:38,718
Rym: So I'll work on that.

290
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:49,777
Rym: Anyway hobo Nichols are Often actually made by hobos and there's a whole like hobby of collecting them and making them.

291
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:52,507
Scott: and this crazy story Yeah hobos do lots of stuff like that.

292
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:55,058
Scott: cuz you know your hobo you don't there are you don't have anything to do.

293
00:17:55,118 --> 00:18:02,060
Scott: so something That takes a long time like, you know Scratching a nickel to put draw a picture on it is gonna be perfect.

294
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:07,173
Rym: There is the era of the classic hobo Nichols from 1913 to 1940. then there was the later era.

295
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:11,167
Scott: So what about the other?

296
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:12,715
Scott: so the hobo who made one in 1941 his doesn't count?

297
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,024
Rym: No, this is the later era.

298
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,115
Rym: and then 1980 onward is the modern era.

299
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:19,843
Scott: what happened in 1940?

300
00:18:19,843 --> 00:18:20,831
Scott: Changed the hobos.

301
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:21,960
Rym: Oh, let's find out.

302
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:31,402
Rym: So in the original era in the 30s and on there was a guy named Bert and he had a student named Oh and Burton Bo.

303
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:37,446
Rym: these hobos carved all the kind of canonical Hobo Nichols, so there were.

304
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:39,634
Scott: so basically they were only two hobos who were in the game.

305
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:41,440
Rym: Well, don't know they're the famous ones.

306
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,379
Rym: There are many other people but these two were like well known.

307
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:55,100
Rym: Okay, so in the 40s 50s 60s 70s onward That was a transitional period for hobo engravers because the Buffalo nickel was gradually replaced by the Jefferson nickel.

308
00:18:56,141 --> 00:19:09,500
Rym: the Buffalo nickel was apparently it was widely regarded as being too ugly when it was new and Too ugly when it was worn down and therefore always ugly, but it was a good medium for a hobo carving.

309
00:19:10,702 --> 00:19:12,210
Rym: So the Jefferson nickel wasn't as good.

310
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,324
Rym: so people had to do very different things to the nickels They made different.

311
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:16,609
Scott: Oh, so it's so it's.

312
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,946
Scott: it's not the year that you carved it that makes the difference It's the nickel you used.

313
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:30,026
Rym: Well, no, it's that the types of hobo nickels that were made transition because the kinds of nickels that existed were different and Like art styles were different.

314
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:33,280
Rym: Apparently a lot of people made Chinese women and hippies.

315
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,899
Rym: Modern hobo nickels are made mostly with dremels and a lot of people disdain them saying that only old hobo nickels count.

316
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,129
Scott: Oh you don't Rym you.

317
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:49,242
Scott: I see you painted this fabulous painting and it's so incredibly fabulous But you know what?

318
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:51,533
Scott: It doesn't count because you use paint from the paint store.

319
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:52,498
Scott: You weren't like Van Gogh.

320
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:55,096
Rym: Yeah There's the original hobo society.

321
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:03,620
Rym: They will like do research on and certify because apparently there's a problem where people will make fake hobo nickels and sell them to collectors.

322
00:20:03,742 --> 00:20:06,948
Rym: Well for five cents Hundreds thousands of dollars.

323
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:09,036
Scott: who would pay hundreds of thousand dollars for a nickel?

324
00:20:09,437 --> 00:20:14,020
Rym: your moron What if it's a car meets a piece of art just like a painting and that pay it doesn't matter.

325
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:19,079
Scott: I don't think it's worth that much money for a nickel, but it's not a nickel anymore.

326
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,551
Rym: It doesn't matter how fast it needs to be in this shape of a.

327
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:24,213
Scott: I don't care.

328
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:27,865
Scott: if Michelangelo carved the fucking nickel It's not worth a hundred thousand.

329
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,136
Rym: I would pay a hundred thousand dollars for a nickel carved by Michelangelo.

330
00:20:31,237 --> 00:20:32,686
Scott: I would pay maybe 1000. you know why?

331
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:43,166
Rym: Because I could sell it for way more than a hundred thousand Museum because it belongs in a museum.

332
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:48,300
Scott: I'm just saying if Michelangelo had a hoe and a buffalo nickel that is some serious crazy.

333
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:51,066
Scott: So how the hell did he get it?

334
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:55,360
Rym: My thing of the day is merely the existence of hobo nickels.

335
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,265
Rym: I suggest you check these out.

336
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:57,847
Rym: All right.

337
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,451
Rym: I like this Viking guy.

338
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:08,756
Scott: So I know that Rym is a hater of the LCD Portable game game, you know the game and watch the tiger LCD.

339
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:09,439
Rym: not a hater.

340
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,029
Rym: All right, really the hater implies that the hate is probably unwarranted.

341
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,000
Scott: those games where shit as you can see haters gonna hate.

342
00:21:17,482 --> 00:21:19,509
Rym: I had a gameboy and a game gear.

343
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,300
Rym: Yeah before those existed, you know what I had before them.

344
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:22,682
Rym: You know what?

345
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:31,020
Rym: I did when I had a long car trip book read a fucking book Yeah, but anyway, or I had mechanical handheld or light-up football.

346
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:32,911
Rym: Now not let a football.

347
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:39,694
Scott: I had a light-up baseball from like Anyway, be I am a fan of the old LCD games.

348
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:41,380
Scott: game and watch tiger LCD, etc.

349
00:21:42,763 --> 00:21:44,319
Scott: Rym is not easy cuz they're shitty.

350
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,394
Rym: Anyway, they were way overpriced for what they were.

351
00:21:47,414 --> 00:21:48,540
Scott: Yeah, they were like 10 bucks.

352
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,973
Scott: This guy made a website called pika pic p ICA - PIC and it's hippopotums.

353
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:54,535
Scott: hip.

354
00:21:54,575 --> 00:22:02,852
Scott: not hippopotamus is hippopotums digitized Digitalized collection of handheld electronic games and this is a. it's a flash site.

355
00:22:02,892 --> 00:22:15,904
Scott: It's all flash, but on this site It's basically exact perfect reproductions of a bunch not a whole ton but a whole bunch of Old LCD games.

356
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:16,726
Scott: that Rym doesn't like.

357
00:22:16,786 --> 00:22:20,517
Scott: some gaming watches Zelda game and watch a dr.

358
00:22:20,617 --> 00:22:21,299
Scott: Slump game.

Scott: Dr Slump Arale Arale song and super whatever.

361
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:29,820
Rym: see now things like that are fun.

362
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:35,280
Rym: I enjoy playing like kind of like old electro mechanical arcade games or a lot of vintage arcade games.

363
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:35,602
Rym: They're not.

364
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:37,412
Scott: so these are okay now that they're old.

365
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:40,331
Rym: No, they're not actually fun But they are actually fun.

366
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:46,856
Rym: if I'd been a kid I would not have enjoyed playing some of the games that are lauded as you know modern like.

367
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:48,000
Rym: oh check out this class.

368
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:54,580
Rym: But there's still an interesting experience in playing an old game just to see what it was like.

369
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,063
Rym: But you know what?

370
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:57,719
Rym: You're not gonna have fun playing these shitty tiger LCD.

371
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,068
Scott: You're gonna have plenty of fun playing these games.

372
00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:01,935
Scott: play some Bartman Avenger of Evil.

373
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:03,420
Scott: play some terminate.

374
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:05,975
Scott: They got the electronic that terminate.

375
00:23:05,995 --> 00:23:06,799
Scott: take a g-man.

376
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,271
Scott: All kinds of good games going on here.

377
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:10,659
Scott: The Zelda ones actually really good.

378
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:21,700
Scott: but yeah if you either too young to have ever seen these games or had them or maybe you're old and you have nostalgia for them or You're really old and you were too old to have them when you were a kid.

379
00:23:22,243 --> 00:23:22,907
Scott: Go to this site.

380
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:25,240
Scott: play a bunch of these awesome games, they're awesome.

381
00:23:25,681 --> 00:23:30,235
Rym: So in much more important news, I deface the fuck out of this nickel with this dime.

382
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:31,720
Scott: Yeah, let me see that nickel.

383
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,803
Rym: I mean, I didn't.

384
00:23:32,884 --> 00:23:38,020
Rym: I just did a little bit of scratching and look I put some surprisingly deep scratches in it none whatsoever.

385
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:41,316
Scott: It looks like Jefferson to me.

386
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:53,763
Scott: So you minorly scratched Jefferson's collar.

387
00:23:53,984 --> 00:23:54,968
Rym: Yeah in like two seconds.

388
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:58,160
Rym: All I was saying is that it's not that hard to deface a nickel.

389
00:23:58,528 --> 00:24:01,900
Scott: Yeah, okay But try how long is it gonna take you to put an art in it and replace?

390
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,955
Rym: Jefferson completely about as long as it takes to do any soft metal carving.

391
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:10,965
Scott: I Think if you heat it up a little bit or used a better tool like a dremel It would take a lot less.

392
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:13,180
Rym: I wasn't saying you should carve it with a dime.

393
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,209
Rym: I'm just saying I trivially defaced it with a dime.

394
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,055
Rym: Anyway, I'll bet in about ten minutes.

395
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:19,460
Rym: I could remove Jefferson's nose.

396
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,730
Scott: Yeah, you know what I could remove nose nose.

397
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,675
Scott: I could remove instantly.

398
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:24,700
Scott: Yeah, thanks.

399
00:24:26,618 --> 00:24:27,684
Rym: I Argue that you cannot.

400
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,494
Scott: how can I not cuz it's already removed.

401
00:24:30,514 --> 00:24:30,996
Scott: That's right.

402
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:32,060
Scott: That's how I did it so fast.

403
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:34,548
Rym: So, how can you remove it?

404
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:36,294
Rym: undertake the action of removing it?

405
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:36,716
Rym: I did.

406
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:37,980
Rym: No, it was removed prior.

407
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,471
Rym: You did not remove you did nothing.

408
00:24:39,672 --> 00:24:44,439
Scott: How do you know I didn't do it Because Michelangelo said anyway.

409
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,773
Rym: So metamoment very briefly we will be this weekend at anime Boston.

410
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:52,572
Rym: That's why the show might have gone up a little late Today.

411
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:55,388
Scott: It's cuz I was in Connecticut less tonight.

412
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:56,050
Rym: Yeah.

413
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:56,512
Rym: Yeah.

414
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:58,740
Rym: Anyway, and why we're kind of tired?

415
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,777
Rym: We're kind of rushing the show and we may not have a Thursday episode.

416
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:02,180
Rym: We'll see.

417
00:25:02,823 --> 00:25:04,252
Rym: I don't think we're gonna have a Thursday episode.

418
00:25:04,473 --> 00:25:07,327
Scott: Anyway, lots of other Meta news.

419
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:07,669
Scott: Let's see.

420
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,120
Scott: We got bar camp, right?

421
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,769
Scott: I'm helping to organize bar camp NYC.

422
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:13,937
Scott: if you don't know a bar camp NYC is going the internet.

423
00:25:13,957 --> 00:25:15,381
Scott: look up bar camp Right.

00:25:15,482 --> 00:25:16,645
Scott: It happens in a bunch of cities.

00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:26,219
Scott: It is gonna be on May 21st and 22nd in New York City The Microsoft Office and you can go to the bar camp NYC website to get all the information about it.

426
00:25:27,262 --> 00:25:32,618
Scott: The 20th May 20th the night before bar camp starts is actually that Jane McGonigal thing where I'm already mentioned.

427
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,910
Scott: Yep May 7th at noon is the nerd NYC.

428
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:39,615

Scott: go to the nerd NYC comm Website to get all the information about the nerd.

430
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:45,897
Rym: I look forward to some jungle speed outside.

431
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:54,200
Scott: Yep April 30th and May 1st is the comic geek speak podcast is having their convention in Redding, Pennsylvania.

432
00:25:54,602 --> 00:26:05,630
Rym: I probably won't go to it though because it's a really bad timing, you know I feel like this meta moment if we're gonna talk about all the other geeky things out There is better served by being a post on the website.

433
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:06,192
Scott: Yeah.

434
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:07,337
Scott: Well, I can working on that.

435
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:08,180
Scott: I'm working on that.

436
00:26:09,063 --> 00:26:13,500
Scott: It'll happen soon after we after all these geeky things end probably in June.

437
00:26:13,992 --> 00:26:15,284
Rym: I'm curious Do you guys care cuz?

438
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:22,217
Rym: I get a feeling that the only purpose of the meta moment really is people who want to know about Our stuff or stuff that we're like, we're actually like we're doing this con.

439
00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:22,800
Rym: We're going in.

440
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,799
Scott: I'm just saying people show up at these things.

441
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,067
Rym: Yeah, but we but we should.

442
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:31,414
Rym: but we tell them because we tell them to yeah But the things we're at how many of them show up to the things we're not?

443
00:26:31,434 --> 00:26:32,157
Scott: and you don't know.

444
00:26:32,177 --> 00:26:34,085
Scott: we'd have to go to Those things to find out wouldn't we?

445
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:35,973
Rym: Yeah, but why tell them to go then?

446
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:37,500
Scott: because they're cool things.

447
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:39,039
Rym: Yeah, but why not just have a link to it?

448
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:45,832
Rym: I don't think that many people are going to things we tell them to go to Especially since they listen to the episodes often way after we made them.

449
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:48,199
Scott: Anyway, and when's the next board game night?

450
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:54,778
Rym: is May 13th the same night as of the nerd night that they want us to go present beyond candy land ad.

451
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:55,200
Rym: so we got it.

452
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:56,639
Scott: Oh, are we actually scheduled to do that?

453
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,554
Rym: Uh, we weren't but we didn't go to two in a row and then they got emailed.

454
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:01,725
Rym: me is like hey you guys want to Present so we'll see.

455
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,307
Rym: All right.

456
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:04,900
Scott: Well, I guess if we're presenting that's more important than board games.

457
00:27:05,261 --> 00:27:07,531
Rym: Yeah, but I really want to play board games is my trouble.

458
00:27:07,672 --> 00:27:09,480
Scott: I can go present it with my never-ending trouble.

459
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:11,248
Scott: Okay, I don't need you to be on candy land.

460
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,896
Rym: I actually I just did a cuz.

461
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,705
Rym: remember it's a shorter We have like 20 minutes.

462
00:27:14,987 --> 00:27:17,320
Scott: Oh, we only have 20 minutes, but I had to redo the whole fucking thing.

463
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,305
Rym: Yeah, I already redid it.

464
00:27:18,526 --> 00:27:18,767
Scott: Yeah.

465
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:21,440
Rym: Yeah, cuz I ran it for a bunch of people at work.

466
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:23,251
Rym: I ran beyond candy land like four times.

467
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:24,640
Rym: Okay for various audiences.

468
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:32,308
Rym: Anyway, the only meta news that's really pertinent to GeekNights other than the fact that we're doing a bunch of panels at anime Boston and we'll be playing a bunch of games there.

469
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:39,260
Rym: Is that the book club book is still Foundation by Asimov, you know the one of the great nerd books.

470
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:45,076
Scott: Yes of all time that I sadly admittedly have not actually read and also follow me on Twitter.

471
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,831
Rym: APR ECHE You could follow GeekNights on Twitter.

472
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:50,740
Scott: You can do that too, but I want more followers.

473
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,528
Scott: Why cuz somebody else had more file.

474
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:52,990
Scott: I didn't care.

475
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:55,281
Scott: I don't really care about the followers, you know I don't.

476
00:27:55,584 --> 00:27:57,760
Scott: I'm not the kind of person to pay attention to numbers and give a shit.

477
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,663
Scott: I'm just sort of joking.

478
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,610
Scott: but someone else had more followers than me.

479
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,875
Scott: That's not cool.

480
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:03,079
Rym: I should unfollow you.

481
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:05,166
Rym: We should all unfollow you.

482
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:05,467
Scott: do it.

483
00:28:05,487 --> 00:28:06,068
Scott: that'd be hilarious.

484
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:09,438
Rym: guys either follow Scott or unfollow him and let's see what happens.

485
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:10,978
Scott: sure Do whatever you want.

486
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,524
Rym: So seven wonders.

487
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:17,269
Rym: one of the games we picked.

488
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,032
Rym: we played like.

489
00:28:18,353 --> 00:28:20,800
Rym: I don't know a ton of games that we have to review.

490
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,780
Rym: We've just been slowly like piling them up and then playing them more times to make sure.

491
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,850
Scott: Basically seven wonders is the new hot game.

492
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,000
Scott: I heard about it and I heard that it was the new hot game.

493
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:36,060
Scott: I played it a couple times at someone's house And then I played it a few more times at like a zinc icon and then Rym bought a copy and played it even more.

494
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,407
Rym: Yep, it was sold out.

495
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:37,990
Rym: I had to pre-order.

496
00:28:38,111 --> 00:28:39,760
Scott: obviously, you know already.

497
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:50,398
Scott: Yeah, you know already that if we played it so much and we kept going back to it that there is good a warning I am getting slightly tired of it and I don't think it has staying power.

498
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,628
Rym: I agree No, well, there we go.

499
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:54,240
Rym: But anyway, it's still a great game.

500
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,297
Rym: I highly recommend you own it because straight up this is a game like Zula Rhetto where it's not the best game.

501
00:28:59,378 --> 00:29:04,580
Scott: if you're smart You'll have solved it pretty quickly and the winner will come down to luck.

502
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,760
Rym: But it's a game that you can whip out and play relatively quickly that you can teach relatively quickly.

503
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,975
Rym: It's a great game like at a con like you have a bunch of new people.

504
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:17,436
Rym: We should play a game You don't really want to spend 40 minutes teaching them.

505
00:29:17,476 --> 00:29:22,680
Scott: Puerto Rico The game pretty much is almost exactly in the same niche as ticket to ride.

506
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,708
Scott: It takes about the same length of time to play.

507
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:32,260
Scott: It's got that same mechanic of on your turn All you do is one very small thing and you take a lot of small turns.

508
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:38,300
Scott: So the game goes very quickly and in fact, this is even one better than ticket to ride because everyone takes simultaneous turns.

509
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:40,660
Scott: So there's absolutely no waiting for anyone to take their turn.

510
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,320
Rym: You just keep going and going and going and going and also prevents over any arguments of oh so-and-so always doesn't take his turn.

511
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:47,984
Rym: That's a lie.

512
00:29:48,024 --> 00:29:54,693
Rym: You take just as long because you can see every round Exactly who's holding everyone up because everyone's taking their turn simultaneously.

513
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:55,998
Rym: It's always Scott Johnson.

514
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:56,460
Rym: That's right.

515
00:29:56,843 --> 00:30:12,398
Scott: So the way seven wonders works is you know You have there's a deck of cards and you split it up and you give everyone a hand and on your turn every turn Of the entire game all you do is play a card That's it and you and then you give that the remaining cards to the person to your left or right depending whatever.

516
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:17,400
Rym: and some of The cards are resources and you basically tap the resources magic style every round.

517
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,280
Rym: So you build up this kind of increasing accumulation of resources and there's a whole bunch of different kind.

518
00:30:22,902 --> 00:30:34,424
Scott: So early in the game you build up more resources and having more resources allows you to play other cards which allow you to play Other cards which allow you to play more cards to give you more points and then at the end of the game rose the most points Wins, right?

519
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:39,460
Scott: So it's all about, you know getting a good sequence of cards that play into each other.

520
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:43,660
Scott: You know every time you play a card and you never use that card it never gets you any points.

521
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,936
Scott: You just wasted a turn because you could have used that card to get money instead Which would be worth at least one point.

522
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:55,040
Rym: now It has a lot of particular mechanics that are either cribbed from other games or just analogously grown.

523
00:30:55,141 --> 00:30:56,491
Rym: Like you build buildings, right?

524
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:57,800
Rym: And you can only build unique buildings.

525
00:30:57,901 --> 00:31:11,240
Rym: So if there's a granary and you build it, you can't build another granary But you can build another building similar to a great Yes Now the thing is many buildings have a notation on them that if you already have X building you can build this for free.

526
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:19,360
Scott: Yeah, it's basically identical to the way it works in Attica For example, I learned by, you know, if you actually look at the cards of the game, right?

527
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,140
Scott: I learned that there's a very, the most difficult card to build in the whole game is worth like eight points.

528
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,844
Scott: I forget what it is.

529
00:31:25,528 --> 00:31:26,755
Scott: It might be the Parthenon or something.

530
00:31:26,796 --> 00:31:27,520
Scott: It's something ridiculous.

531
00:31:28,027 --> 00:31:28,939
Scott: It's worth a ton of points.

532
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,100
Scott: But if you have a theater you can build that ridiculously expensive building for free.

533
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:40,779
Scott: So basically I always build the theater so that I can always try to get the expensive building for free and it's worked out In my favor two or three times already.

534
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:47,138
Scott: Yep So it's like no way, once you know the cards the game starts to lose a lot of its luster because it's like just sort of obvious.

535
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:47,840
Scott: the path to take?

536
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,224
Rym: Well, I would say the path.

537
00:31:50,264 --> 00:31:56,220
Rym: There are, I don't know, about three, maybe four paths to victory.

538
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,880
Scott: Yeah, there's the military path.

539
00:31:58,111 --> 00:31:59,140
Scott: Yeah There's the green path.

540
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,980
Rym: Well, military is a choice that modifies every path.

541
00:32:02,104 --> 00:32:04,337
Rym: It does true Because military alone does not win you.

542
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:08,100
Rym: the game That can get you at most 10 plus six plus two points.

543
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:11,196
Scott: It's mostly the green path and the blue path are the ways to go, right?

544
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,520
Scott: And green is harder to do but has a potentially higher payout.

545
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:20,300
Scott: Like if one guy goes all blue and one guy goes all green, green guy is probably gonna win because the way the math works.

546
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,520
Rym: But here let's talk about like the reason the paths are different.

547
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:26,060
Rym: You know not to get into the stupid details of the game because you should just buy it.

548
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,439
Rym: You'll read the rules you see how it really works.

549
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,820
Rym: But the green path is these there's sets of different types of items.

550
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:32,799
Scott: Yeah, science cards.

551
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:44,800
Rym: So there's three types and you get points increasingly based on the number of sets of three that you get But also two to the end points and being the number of one particular one that you have.

552
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:46,431
Scott: So basically all the green cards.

553
00:32:46,471 --> 00:32:51,020
Scott: if you start piling them up It makes sort of like a two-dimensional grid of scoring.

554
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,140
Scott: So all the green cards actually score twice in two different ways.

555
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:55,678
Scott: What this means.

556
00:32:55,901 --> 00:33:03,980
Scott: And one of those ways it scores, it scores exponentially And the other way it scores, it scores linearly, but even the linear scoring is a multiple of seven.

557
00:33:04,502 --> 00:33:06,834
Scott: So you get basically every green card.

558
00:33:06,975 --> 00:33:14,120
Scott: as you get more of them The amount of points that each individual green card gives you continues to go up at a very very high rate.

559
00:33:14,502 --> 00:33:20,160
Rym: So if you're playing this game because the two-dimensional grid It's actually fairly complicated until you figure it out.

560
00:33:20,262 --> 00:33:25,098
Rym: And then it's obvious If you play this game with friends who have not played it before Get all the green cards.

561
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:31,280
Rym: They will look at the green cards, their eyes will glaze over when you explain how the scoring works And they'll ignore them.

562
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,600
Rym: You will win almost every time if you go for the green cards when people around you are not that bright or haven't played much.

563
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:41,700
Scott: Yeah, it is sort of interesting because there isn't a lot of inter-player.

564
00:33:42,004 --> 00:33:43,140
Scott: You know there is a little bit, right?

565
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,420
Scott: You can buy things from the people to your left or right And you military with the people to your left or right and things like that.

566
00:33:49,602 --> 00:33:51,600
Rym: But it has a heavy left-right mechanic.

567
00:33:51,807 --> 00:34:01,220
Scott: Yes And you know you think about your hand, you're going to play a card But any cards you leave in your hand you're giving to the person to your left or your right depending on the age.

568
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:09,920
Scott: So there is significant impact you can have on your immediate neighbors in the game And in a three-player game that's really significant because you're influencing all the other players.

569
00:34:10,442 --> 00:34:13,577
Scott: But other than that there isn't a whole lot of inter-player mechanics.

570
00:34:14,482 --> 00:34:17,120
Scott: You can't destroy other people's cards, you can't steal their cards.

571
00:34:18,061 --> 00:34:21,260
Scott: There's really not much you can do to take points away from other people.

572
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:26,540
Rym: It's a little more than say Agricola in terms of how much you can actually fuck with everybody.

573
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,600
Scott: I'd say it's a little bit less than Puerto Rico because you can screw with people sort of the same way that you do in Puerto Rico.

574
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:33,679
Scott: Like aha, I played captain so you couldn't play captain.

575
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:38,716
Scott: But it's like a little bit less than that because in Puerto Rico if I craftsman out from under you.

576
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:39,739
Scott: that could hurt you pretty badly.

577
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:50,020
Rym: So my main problem with the game is that like I said I think I have solved it mostly And I think when I play it really just comes down to luck.

578
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:54,120
Rym: And it took maybe eight plays to solve.

579
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,079
Rym: There's not that much going on in the game.

580
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:58,480
Scott: Most people though don't play a game as much as we do right.

581
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,400
Scott: They get a game and if they play it twice it's like oh they're so happy.

582
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:04,120
Scott: You know how many people play it get a game and play it eight times.

583
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,920
Rym: But I found that games like this in a couple weeks will be played a lot.

584
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,800
Rym: Or Zularetto gets played a lot too just because like I said at the beginning they're quick to play.

585
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:12,524
Scott: That is true.

586
00:35:12,564 --> 00:35:15,740
Scott: it is quick to play so if you do bust it out you're probably going to play it two or three times.

587
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,360
Rym: I mean this takes a half hour tops if people are slow.

588
00:35:18,782 --> 00:35:22,779
Rym: If people take their turn you'll whip out a whole game including scoring at the end in like 20 minutes.

589
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:30,200
Scott: The scoring could actually take as long as a whole age Just because you know you have to add up so many different things and you know some of them are slightly.

590
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:36,080
Rym: Now the analogy of the game is not as bad as Le Havre which basically doesn't have an actual theme.

591
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,357
Rym: You're just kind of like yeah boats and food get food.

592
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:41,288
Scott: It's a port town.

593
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:47,710
Rym: yeah you make money But seven wonders you're playing a wonder.

594
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,320
Rym: slash the civilization that built that wonder.

595
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,671
Scott: Yeah it's like if you're playing you know the colossus well.

596
00:35:53,711 --> 00:35:54,375
Scott: are you playing?

597
00:35:54,616 --> 00:35:57,640
Scott: are you the colossus Or are you the people building the colossus?

598
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,480
Rym: I think you're playing the city state that has wrought the colossus.

599
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,627
Rym: But you know everyone plays a wonder.

600
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:03,828
Rym: so

601
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:04,731
Scott: Sardia you can either

602
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:17,365
Rym: pick them or pass them out randomly And everyone has a little card and in addition to the cards in their hands that they're buying And passing back and forth you can also buy the improvements that make your wonder bigger Like as you complete your wonder.

603
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:22,887
Rym: it does stuff and every wonder has a different set of powers And an a and a b side.

604
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:23,128
Scott: yeah.

605
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:27,564
Scott: so basically everyone has a wonder which is basically three unique cards That no one else has.

606
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:28,529
Scott: effectively right.

607
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:34,634
Scott: it's like everyone's playing with the same deck of cards But each person has three cards usually three sometimes four.

608
00:36:34,654 --> 00:36:36,461
Scott: I think there's one weird one weird Wonder.

609
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:42,184
Scott: that is four but everyone basically has a handful of a few cards that are different from Everyone else's cards.

610
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:45,378
Scott: that makes you unique which gives you a little bit more replay value.

611
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:48,817
Scott: it's like Well I'll play with the mausoleum well now I'll play with the hanging garden.

612
00:36:48,837 --> 00:37:02,340
Scott: so it's a little Slightly different game if you have a different wonder and every wonder has two sides which gives You a little bit more replay value because there's an a side which is easy and direct And there's a b side which is a little more complicated but potentially higher payout.

613
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:08,362
Rym: I would recommend when you play do the random allocation of the wonders but let players pick A or b.

614
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:10,492
Scott: I would recommend you do it completely randomly.

615
00:37:10,713 --> 00:37:12,904
Rym: nah that gets boring because I'm already Bored with the game.

616
00:37:12,924 --> 00:37:18,414
Rym: I mean I wouldn't play it unless I was teaching it or playing it with new People or as like a warm-up game and a board game night.

617
00:37:18,454 --> 00:37:18,736
Rym: I wouldn't.

618
00:37:18,756 --> 00:37:21,127
Scott: just definitely it's definitely Good warm-up game I don't know.

619
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:23,317
Scott: I wouldn't make the highlight game though no but is.

620
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:29,484
Scott: it is an Excellent new warm-up game you know and if I was short on warm-up games I would definitely add it My game library.

621
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:33,023
Rym: even if I was bored I'm accumulating a lot of warm-up games because I Lacked them.

622
00:37:33,063 --> 00:37:37,243
Scott: I realized that because people refuse to play the series games people just play warm-up Games and then they're done.

623
00:37:37,404 --> 00:37:47,960
Rym: well I particular I only owned some of the big heavy-hitter games Like el grande and t and e and I own a lot of the weird old out of print games like la cheetah.

624
00:37:48,801 --> 00:37:51,691
Rym: I didn't own many quick whip them out games.

625
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:55,044
Rym: that's why I got zularetto and seven wonders and I'm Ordering rico.

626
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,556
Scott: zularetto takes a little bit longer than seven wonders.

627
00:37:57,596 --> 00:38:01,876
Scott: I think it's more of a. It's sort of in between warm-up when I say highlight there's different.

628
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:03,825
Rym: there's two kinds of Warm-up games in my mind.

629
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,576
Rym: there's the warm-up game that's quick to play as in.

630
00:38:06,636 --> 00:38:09,429
Rym: you whip it out you Play with everybody and then you play the main event.

631
00:38:09,992 --> 00:38:18,834
Rym: and then there's the warm-up game like Zularetto where you've got a bunch of people over you're gonna play a game you're gonna play games Many games but people are still wanting to socialize.

632
00:38:18,854 --> 00:38:19,557
Rym: they're not in the.

633
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:20,641
Rym: let's just play a Game mode.

634
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:24,817
Rym: yet zularetto you can socialize over without impacting the game.

635
00:38:24,957 --> 00:38:27,972
Scott: I mostly think of Zularetto as more like a settlers replacement.

636
00:38:28,032 --> 00:38:36,044
Scott: right because like I'm looking down on settlers But zularetto I can still play a lot more easily than I can play guitar settlers in zularetto are Actually pretty equal to me.

637
00:38:36,124 --> 00:38:38,191
Scott: zularetto is a much better gateway.

638
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:38,772
Scott: I think too.

639
00:38:39,615 --> 00:38:40,518
Rym: uh I don't know.

640
00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:42,183
Rym: it Depends on the person.

641
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:46,921
Rym: someone who is predisposed toward hardcore settlers is a better like intro Game.

642
00:38:47,343 --> 00:38:49,912
Rym: someone who isn't zularetto is a better intro game anyway.

643
00:38:50,313 --> 00:38:51,557
Scott: but yeah seven wonders.

644
00:38:51,577 --> 00:38:53,223
Rym: my other new Trouble.

645
00:38:53,283 --> 00:39:01,088
Rym: I'll warn you now when you're teaching this game people who played magic as they were Kids they'll get the resources immediately.

646
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,714
Rym: no one else will.

647
00:39:02,955 --> 00:39:07,346
Rym: yeah I was very surprised Has fucked up the resources.

648
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:13,625
Rym: despite multiple alternative explanations analogies examples Nothing works.

649
00:39:13,745 --> 00:39:17,359
Scott: I can't understand why these people don't understand how the resources work.

650
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,685
Scott: it's like You have two rocks.

651
00:39:18,745 --> 00:39:20,573
Scott: that means you look at the cost of something.

652
00:39:20,614 --> 00:39:21,940
Scott: if it costs three rock you can't.

653
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:27,122
Scott: It's like money that you can only spend it once per turn and every turn everyone gives you all the Money back.

654
00:39:27,222 --> 00:39:28,166
Rym: it's magic resources.

655
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:36,658
Rym: you tap them every round but people don't get that and they'll like They'll buy resources by trying to like play cards and just they will cock that up.

656
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:37,701
Rym: you've got to make Sure.

657
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:41,915
Rym: after you teach the whole game teach everybody resources again.

658
00:39:42,035 --> 00:39:45,206
Rym: I guarantee at least one of your Players doesn't actually understand.

659
00:39:45,226 --> 00:39:55,040
Scott: yeah and on top of that right even if people uh understand Resources right there's a lot of the game requires you to notice a lot of small things on the cards.

660
00:39:55,421 --> 00:40:00,097
Scott: For example you know the you what this card upgrades to that card for free.

661
00:40:00,158 --> 00:40:02,406
Scott: well it's a really Tiny icon that says that.

662
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:08,747
Scott: so if you're not really looking closely at every card you might like say Not build something even though you could have for free.

663
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:10,451
Scott: uh you know.

664
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:14,162
Rym: because uh yep people will also Fuck up.

665
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:18,517
Rym: they will not remember that they can't build the same named building twice.

666
00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:22,778
Rym: so they'll Build the barracks and then they'll build the barracks again and it just cocks up the game.

667
00:40:25,081 --> 00:40:27,228
Rym: Anyway other than that the game is great.

668
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:32,611
Rym: uh i don't know if it was really worth msrp but I'm glad i own it.

669
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:36,523
Scott: mm-hmm We're doing more show or is that enough?

670
00:40:36,763 --> 00:40:37,385
Rym: i think that's enough.
