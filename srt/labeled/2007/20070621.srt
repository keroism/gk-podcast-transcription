1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,028
Rym: It's Thursday June 21st.

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,011
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:16,680
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:30,082
Scott: spoilers Let's do this Man today.

5
00:00:30,103 --> 00:00:36,220
Rym: I was looking at the Dell website a new egg, and I'm getting real close to just buying a gigantic monitor.

6
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:38,205
Scott: Yeah, you kind of need one.

7
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:40,051
Scott: you had that shitty 19-inch CRT is great.

8
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:40,653
Rym: Yeah, it sucks.

9
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:40,894
Rym: It's fine.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,707
Scott: And yeah many years.

11
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:49,800
Rym: the only reason I'm really getting rid of it is that I can't have it and my microphone.

12
00:00:50,882 --> 00:00:51,646
Scott: It still sucks.

13
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:55,205
Scott: It's fine, and oh if it's so fine Why aren't you using it right now?

14
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:57,860
Rym: like I just said I can't have it and my microphone.

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,746
Scott: Yeah, it in your microphone for a long time before yeah And you know what it totally sucked.

16
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:05,623
Rym: cuz I had to keep the microphone like several feet away from it or else I got that honey.

17
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:08,617
Scott: Well that crappy crappy crappy LCD using right now.

18
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:11,488
Rym: Oh god This thing is is not the business.

19
00:01:11,568 --> 00:01:14,699
Scott: It's still better than that 19-inch CRT that you not really.

20
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:16,868
Rym: yeah I really I'd prefer the CRT right now.

21
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:18,615
Scott: Yeah, your eyes are broken.

22
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:19,057
Scott: What do you know?

23
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:19,740
Rym: well plus once?

24
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,760
Rym: I realized that according to the stress test I can get a couple thousand frames per second in half-life 2 with everything turned up.

25
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:31,134
Rym: so uh I Think I'm gonna go with the gigantic high-resolution widescreen monitor.

26
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:41,860
Scott: the thing that I've noticed though Especially with my 22 inch at work is that most of the monitors that are over 20 inches It's kind of stupid to get them because what happens is you know you have a height.

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,164
Scott: They do have a higher resolution.

28
00:01:43,184 --> 00:01:49,023
Scott: like the 20 inch can go to like 1600 by 1200 right and the 22 inch can go 1680 by 1050 80 pixels over 2 inches.

29
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:58,352
Scott: I mean it's not it's 2 inches diagonally But that's the pixels on the 22 inch monitor or bigger.

30
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:02,967
Scott: thus the image is lower quality Like if you look at the monitor on my laptop.

31
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:07,746
Scott: It's a 10.6 inch screen, but it's 1280 by 768.

32
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:16,825
Rym: It's not that it's lower quality It's that the viewing radius of how far away you can be and still see a good picture is increased I guess.

33
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:18,294
Scott: but do I really that logic?

34
00:02:18,314 --> 00:02:19,279
Rym: Why do you ever have a TV?

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,832
Rym: That's what if you had a one inch by one inch screen?

36
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:23,400
Rym: There was like a million by a million pixels.

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,122
Rym: That's not good.

38
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:24,924
Scott: Well.

39
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:28,112
Scott: No, but the the point is how a monitor.

40
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:30,258
Scott: you're sitting pretty close to it so bigger.

41
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:32,317
Scott: close I'm pretty close.

42
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:39,460
Rym: I'm probably gonna go with a 22 inch widescreen with the 1680 by whatever resolution And I have it at work and the pixels are too big.

43
00:02:39,963 --> 00:02:40,245
Rym: I don't know.

44
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,399
Rym: I've used them at work too, and they don't doesn't bother me at all.

45
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:51,360
Scott: Yeah I definitely have seen the 20 inches and with the same or slightly lower resolution the image quality is far sharper and far superior.

46
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:55,976
Rym: To me the image quality is the same partly because I sit slightly further away from my monitor than you do.

47
00:02:55,996 --> 00:03:01,698
Scott: I Just put the monitor on the desk, and then I sit at depending on where the desk is not where the monitor is.

48
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,920
Scott: hmm Yeah, I also don't really have a need to be that far away from my monitor.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,060
Scott: It's like I'm not going across the room to watch a video or something.

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,301
Scott: That's.

51
00:03:10,503 --> 00:03:13,439
Scott: that's why TVs should be big because you sit across the room.

52
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:25,500
Scott: But then again TVs also need some high resolution or else you get the syndrome like where we have the Mac plugged into our TV You can't read the text of them making it huge because there's not enough pixels to render the fonts properly.

53
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:30,258
Rym: I'd argue more vehemently, but I'm eating some habanero cheddar cheese, and it's pretty awesome.

54
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:34,948
Scott: Yeah Anyway What kind of news actions going on?

55
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:35,129
Rym: Oh?

56
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,420
Rym: I thought you're gonna tell everyone we're going to mocha one last chance.

57
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:38,324
Scott: Oh right right.

58
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:39,188
Scott: so tomorrow this way.

59
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,956
Rym: I could eat more cheese not tomorrow.

60
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:54,566
Scott: Saturday Saturday June 23rd 2007 we are going to go to the Museum of comic and cartoon art arts Festival and that is not a redundant.

61
00:03:54,646 --> 00:04:01,420
Scott: art like I said yesterday is an arts festival at the Museum of comic and cartoon art And it's pretty awesome.

62
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:15,188
Scott: You know we always kind of rag on comic conventions because they're full of nerds buying you know super ultra old Crappy Silver Age books for like $50 like those two guys Interviewed at the Philly wizard world and they were.

63
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,493
Rym: I was like what kind of comics you like?

64
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:19,908
Rym: and the one guy said oh I only read Silver Age, whatever.

65
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:22,460
Rym: and the other guys like yes, there's nothing else worth reading.

66
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:32,423
Scott: Yeah So we don't like those kind of places because a lot of plus the the attitude of collecting as opposed to Enjoying art is not so About that.

67
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:33,606
Rym: listen to last night's episode.

68
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:38,059
Scott: Yeah, but at the mocha everything is totally turned upside down.

69
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:45,091
Scott: first of all it is much more heavily populated with the indie comics than the superhero underwear perfect comics.

70
00:04:45,714 --> 00:04:54,377
Scott: and second of all It's it's like just like a big artists alley you go up to a table And if there's a comic there whoever makes that comic is sitting at that table like 99% of the time.

71
00:04:55,402 --> 00:05:02,860
Scott: you know you're not like going up to a Dealers room where someone some retailer you don't want to talk to is selling the comic that you want.

72
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:08,169
Scott: it's just an artist alley pretty much and Everyone there is sort of on an even playing field.

73
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:28,699
Scott: you've got big-name people or relatively big-name people You know who like what Eisner awards and have so published their comics widely around the world in many languages sold thousands and thousands of copies and right next to them is some punk kid who Xeroxed his frickin Comic at Kinko's this morning, and he's stapling it together as you're standing there, and he's like hey, how you doing?

74
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,183
Scott: Read my comic.

75
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:33,697
Rym: I'm sure our regular listeners wanted to hear you say exactly what you said yesterday.

76
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:34,320
Rym: all over again.

77
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:48,420
Scott: That's fine because there are some people who didn't listen today And there's not much else to say about the convention other than if you like comics And you are anywhere within striking distance of New York City you have no reason not to go on Saturday unless you're doing something Saturday, man

78
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,532
Rym: I recently remembered when I picked up that prison comics last year And I just remembered how funny that thing was

79
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:57,449
Scott: that that was a great comic And we will get many more like it and then talk about.

80
00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:00,540
Rym: you know what I like more than killing, but nothing stab.

81
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:11,420
Rym: So in the news this is kind of big news partly because of the hilarity just provided us for up the Pirate Bay That upstanding bastion of freedom on the internet.

82
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:14,560
Rym: They have decided that they're going to law well going to launch.

83
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:25,760
Rym: They already did launch a new site called Bay IMG Bay image And what it is according to them is a censorship free image hosting website where anyone in the world can anonymously?

84
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:28,739
Rym: Upload any image and tag it and it'll be there forever.

85
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:32,284
Scott: See this is really awesome But it's also really bad.

86
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:37,600
Scott: the reason it's awesome is because all those people who want to like put their avatar in a forum.

87
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:50,252
Scott: Or they want to link to an image But they don't want a hot link to someone else's server or they do hot link to someone else's server, and they get some bad image or They use stupid image shack, and then they go over the bandwidth limit.

88
00:06:50,673 --> 00:06:52,620
Scott: all this stupid shit is now over with.

89
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:53,664
Rym: I don't know about that.

90
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:55,350
Rym: I don't think that's really the intent of this.

91
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:57,900
Scott: I know, but that it does solve that problem.

92
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,686
Rym: Regardless I doubt it does.

93
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:03,760
Rym: I'll bet there will be some sort of hot linking prevention in the future to keep the bandwidth from exploding.

94
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:04,984
Scott: Then what's the point?

95
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:17,480
Rym: the point is to upload things that aren't censored that whatever you put up There is gonna stay up there, so if you put up a picture of Muhammad and sure enough There's a tag Muhammad, and it is nothing but derogatory pictures of Muhammad

96
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:25,626
Scott: Well, I think the problem with that is that of course it's all gonna be nasty nasty prong that no one wants to see Except the people putting it there.

97
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:34,135
Rym: well the thing is I looked at it, and I decided all right I'm flipping through the slash comments and someone links to it and what they link to is the Digimon tag.

98
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:35,680
Rym: now the Digimon tag.

99
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:36,365
Rym: This is.

100
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:40,026
Rym: these are the first images I saw on This Pirate Bay thing.

101
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:43,958
Rym: it was nothing, but Digimon pornography.

102
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:50,400
Rym: in fact It was all Digimon pornography of one specific animal from Digimon.

103
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:53,695
Scott: Well, I mean one specific Digimon one specific Digimon.

104
00:07:54,338 --> 00:08:00,419
Scott: ah I went to the Pokemons, and there was like a Pidgeo doing something, and it wasn't pretty well.

105
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:10,089
Rym: So of course I immediately noticed the lolcat tag, and I've realized that I I love lolcats And sometimes I forget how much I love lolcats.

106
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,641
Scott: Lolcats are awesome with their Monorails.

107
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:17,793
Rym: the thing is I like the idea of a repository in the world.

108
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:26,679
Rym: you can anonymously put pictures or Information or anything out there for the whole world to see with no possible chance of anyone getting back to you anyone punishing you.

109
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:31,380
Rym: This could be a great thing for oppressed people like people in China or Albion.

110
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:34,370
Scott: People in China are gonna be able to get to this site.

111
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,220
Rym: Let me tell you yeah, but still I like the idea of it.

112
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:49,640
Rym: The problem is it's already full of spam and porn and I'll bet within a few more weeks The child porn that is going to be attempted to be uploaded by it will in and of itself bandwidth wise bring it down

113
00:08:50,202 --> 00:09:05,160
Scott: most likely, but I think that what they should have done is they as Being an uncensored image thing is kind of while I admire that and a sort of agree that it needs to exist It's gonna be really difficult to filter out bad images.

114
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:18,160
Scott: It's not like filtering out bad text which you can actually do programmatically like someone in order to filter out bad images Like child porn and any other illegal images because I think what they say that anything illegal in Sweden would be taken off.

115
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,211
Rym: Yeah, it's not a free-for-all.

116
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,120
Rym: I found this kind of funny.

117
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:26,904
Rym: They said oh, this is gonna be an uncensored repository of images, but don't upload anything That's illegal in Sweden.

118
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:27,907
Rym: are we gonna take it down.

119
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:31,480
Scott: Yeah, they gotta have some freaking army of people looking at stuff and taking it.

120
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:40,243
Scott: It's not gonna be easy but I think they should have just tried to solve the image shack problem because that's a problem that is still plaguing the internet and No one solved.

121
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:50,260
Scott: I mean we they jump straight to the YouTube solving the problem for videos and Libs didn't solve the problem for audios, I guess but no one remembered to solve the problem for images.

122
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:53,392
Rym: You realize that in terms of avatars linking to images.

123
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:55,500
Rym: There are a lot of solutions.

124
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:58,914
Rym: Most of them work really well and people who don't most of them kind of suck.

125
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:06,431
Rym: people like oh Frickin bandwidth limits and they only suck because people try to use them for things They were not intended for.

126
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:11,199
Rym: if you want to host I mean there are ways to host images that cost trivial amounts of money.

127
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:13,373
Scott: See what it needs to be free.

128
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:22,360
Rym: YouTube is free And if the way to host images is not free But Scott there's money in YouTube because there are ways to generate advertising revenue from something like YouTube.

129
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:28,420
Rym: There's no way to generate advertising revenue from a site that serves nothing but hotlinked images.

130
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,736
Scott: Does the bay image seem to be making money from advertising revenue?

131
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:33,686
Scott: hell no So they don't.

132
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:35,274
Rym: they're not gonna allow hot linking.

133
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:38,359
Rym: if they do all right now I'm certain they're gonna stop that right quick.

134
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:40,617
Rym: The reason YouTube works is that?

135
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:42,205
Rym: Wally can show you the thing.

136
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:46,299
Rym: it can also show you the related things or the ads and you want to go to YouTube.

137
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:47,360
Rym: people Go to YouTube.

138
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,491
Rym: No one's gonna go to a site that hosts a million twelve-year-old.

139
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:52,553
Rym: to put the reason you.

140
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:58,618
Scott: the reason YouTube got so big is Because people can embed the youtubes in their own page.

141
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:02,620
Rym: yes But still with the link back to YouTube and people have a reason to go to YouTube.

142
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:05,590
Rym: No one would ever go to a site that hosted people's avatars.

143
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:06,875
Rym: There's no reason to.

144
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:08,400
Rym: it's nothing but stupid avatars.

145
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:10,539
Rym: There's no way to make money off of that ever.

146
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:13,248
Scott: It's not about making money that the Pirate Bay.

147
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:14,654
Scott: were they making money on the Pirate Bay?

148
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,937
Rym: because if they don't allow hot linking this Thing will be okay.

149
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:17,845
Rym: they could.

150
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:25,460
Scott: they couldn't afford I don't think to see that without the Hot-linking and you know using it as an image host for images to post elsewhere on the internet.

151
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:27,040
Scott: I have no use for this site.

152
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,571
Scott: I can just go to Google Images to find an image if I want one.

153
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,640
Rym: this is so you can go and browse around it.

154
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,400
Rym: Besides I think this is in the end kind of a dumb idea, and it's gonna fail just for technical limitations.

155
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:42,440
Rym: But there's no reason to give free good hot linkable image hosting on the internet because there's nobody needs that.

156
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:43,891
Rym: But there's no way you can make money.

157
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:44,678
Rym: No one's gonna do it.

158
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,282
Scott: Why?

159
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:47,895
Scott: there's no good reason to make a Pirate Bay torrent tracker.

160
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,740
Scott: There's no way to make money.

161
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:56,757
Rym: Oh because the Pirate Bay torrent tracker Generates far less bandwidth than an image hosting site would in the end.

162
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,240
Scott: well It's regardless.

163
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:09,697
Scott: I think that while this is cool to look at maybe once if it's not useful as a place to host Images to use elsewhere on the internet which Rym seems to say it isn't because it shouldn't be.

164
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:10,500
Rym: that's not the purpose.

165
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,699
Rym: They very clearly the purpose was to have an uncensored place where people can upload images.

166
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,863
Rym: well Have them up there.

167
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:22,260
Scott: I think that's interesting and I applaud them, but I have no use for it, and I really don't care.

168
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,734
Rym: Yeah, but I didn't say it had a use.

169
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:25,860
Rym: it failed already.

170
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:30,462
Rym: But your idea is completely contrary to what anyone cares about with this I think.

171
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:35,360
Scott: but I think that's what would make it successful because if it was what I say it should be successful.

172
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,648
Rym: How they couldn't afford that no one can.

173
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:39,072
Scott: I don't see why they couldn't.

174
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,898
Scott: they seem to be able to affording the Pirate Bay.

175
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:50,888
Rym: the Pirate Bay is probably less bandwidth, and if you tried to host all the FARC images that get up there Or someone's forum avatar that gets seen a billion times Uh-huh, whatever.

176
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,559
Scott: We'll see in the end.

177
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:56,891
Scott: Meh, I'm not gonna go here really if the if it's not you.

178
00:12:56,911 --> 00:13:02,066
Rym: I went there once and I saw Pokemon porn and Digimon porn And it was somewhat inescapable.

179
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:07,158
Rym: in seeing that I I'm not gonna go back because I can go to a site like FARC to see locads.

180
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:13,095
Scott: Well, I just tested it and hot linking totally works, so now this site is useful.

181
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:14,520
Rym: I doubt is gonna stay that way.

182
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:15,310
Rym: That's just my guess.

183
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,648
Scott: well I think that that is how it's gonna stay.

184
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,180
Scott: because what's the point of image hosting if it says image?

185
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,360
Scott: Hosting if it's just an image gallery on their site?

186
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,368
Scott: That's not the same as image hosting.

187
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:32,300
Scott: you see what I'm saying hosting is when you host my image And I use it elsewhere.

188
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:38,382
Scott: So I have a feeling that it is gonna be hot linking and now image shack and all those people better run for cover because They're screwed.

189
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:45,349
Rym: because they made a big point about saying that it's uncensored and it's all tagged Both because I don't see that.

190
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,656
Rym: I just don't see it sticking around.

191
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:51,392
Rym: I don't see it being Available or able to deal with the bandwidth over time.

192
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:55,647
Scott: if they're able to deal with the Pirate Bay I think they can deal with some images.

193
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:56,349
Rym: We'll see.

194
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,316
Scott: they was they wouldn't do it, and they there goes.

195
00:13:58,356 --> 00:13:59,640
Scott: those guys know technology.

196
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:02,028
Scott: They wouldn't do it and allow the hot linking.

197
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:05,620
Rym: Scott you realize they also allow image files up to a hundred megabytes.

198
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:07,018
Rym: We'll see how long this lasts.

199
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:12,321
Scott: I guess we will see how long it lasts that that a hundred megabyte image file that got Plus.

200
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:14,691
Scott: it'll be popular and FARC would screw them over.

201
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,820
Rym: plus the fact that you know they say it's uncensored.

202
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,010
Rym: But that's absolutely not true according to the other things.

203
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,040
Rym: They said I just really don't trust this to be useful at all.

204
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:38,739
Scott: Yeah So basically my prediction if it doesn't work as a thing that beats out image shack and equivalents No one will care about it for very long And if it does then it will just replace all those things and but very few people actually go to the site.

205
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:39,985
Scott: because What do you want?

206
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:42,380
Scott: to just browse random images for this Google image search?

207
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:49,920
Rym: I point out that 4chan is extremely popular, and it's nothing but variously pornographic images and people browsing them and comment.

208
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,300
Scott: Yes, but it comes up in sort of like this time-based way as opposed to this just tag cloud.

209
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,292
Rym: That's a big mess, but for those people the tag clouds even better.

210
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,236
Rym: They click on lolcat.

211
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:00,060
Rym: They see their lolcat.

212
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:01,304
Rym: They click on Digimon.

213
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:03,552
Rym: they see their Digimon form the Digimon form.

214
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:10,834
Rym: they might they might have trouble hosting elsewhere, but they can't Comment on it, so I don't think anything that's ever been posted to.

215
00:15:10,854 --> 00:15:14,567
Scott: 4chan actually counts as a comment But it gets replied to with another image.

216
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:16,454
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time.

217
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:18,080
Rym: They're almost entirely unrelated.

218
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:27,417
Scott: I think what's gonna happen is all the images that you see on 4chan will be hosted on the bay image and linked into the 4chan In which case it just becomes 4chan without the comments, which I don't know.

219
00:15:27,437 --> 00:15:27,778
Rym: what that is.

220
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:33,055
Scott: I don't know what it is either, but well I guess it also has a different community than 4chan.

221
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:36,555
Scott: it has the entire Internets as opposed to the 4chan internets.

222
00:15:36,897 --> 00:15:41,635
Rym: one thing that got me I was surprised that I saw the wet like the link on slash down, and it wasn't.

223
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:44,184
Rym: oh, they're gonna do this It's oh, it's already up.

224
00:15:44,947 --> 00:15:46,050
Scott: Yeah that really got me.

225
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:46,492
Scott: It was like.

226
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:47,756
Scott: Oh, they couldn't do it.

227
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:49,161
Scott: Oh it exists there It is.

228
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,753
Rym: yeah, I just I don't think it's gonna last.

229
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,380
Rym: I think something bad is gonna happen to it.

230
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:53,741
Rym: I do

231
00:15:53,782 --> 00:16:06,300
Scott: think Steve Jobs got it right though, and you know he decided to start announcing Apple products Like right before they came out and announcing the iPhone way before it came out was a bad move But I guess he had to because he needed the FCC approval and all that jazz

232
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,682
Rym: I don't know.

233
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:14,656
Rym: What could have been interesting is if they just put the FCC thing in and Just refuse to say anything at all about the iPhone.

234
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:28,438
Rym: despite that That would be okay I guess cuz then basically without doing anything there would have been a Constant on not underground, but internet PR machine just working itself into a frenzy Waiting for him to acknowledge their their PR machine seems to be working just fine.

235
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:33,600
Rym: anyway iPhone's gonna do just fine despite the fact that I think it's kind of silly.

236
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:39,146
Scott: Regardless if I was a company of any sort I would announce things as They were ready and not before.

237
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,493
Scott: cuz I've learned that mistake already.

238
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:42,836
Scott: like a couple times the GeekNights like yeah We're gonna have a DVD.

239
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:53,070
Scott: Yeah From now on I'm only going to announce things if I'm holding if I'm ready to just push the button and make them go And that's the way it's gonna be right.

240
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,600
Rym: so what do you got for me in the news on this lazy Thursday?

241
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,708
Rym: Where I really want to continue playing Counter-Strike source.

242
00:16:58,989 --> 00:16:59,671
Scott: Yeah, well.

243
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:02,359
Scott: I've always said you know stuff about.

244
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,327
Scott: So you know the soldiers in Iraq.

245
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:07,536
Scott: if they disagree with the Iraq war what should they do?

246
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:08,078
Scott: bla bla bla right?

247
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,046
Scott: Well one guy in the army somewhere Now they even get a fig.

248
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:15,473
Scott: I can not even bother reading his name here.

249
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:27,240
Scott: basically he said Yeah, he went to his superior officer, and he said yeah I'm against the war and I'm no longer gonna play a combat role, and I'm no longer gonna protect corporate representatives.

250
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:28,686
Scott: Whatever he means by that all right.

251
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:32,019
Rym: I hate to say it, but this guy already sounds a little bit nutty.

252
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:33,494
Scott: That's not a little bit nutty.

253
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,400
Scott: But while I'm sort of on his side like yeah, I don't want to fight in that war either.

254
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:41,087
Scott: You know I can.

255
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:42,914
Scott: I can see where you're coming from.

256
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:46,087
Scott: you already Volunteered before.

257
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:54,030
Scott: you can't be forced into the US Army, so You changed your mind Kind of can't do that.

258
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,940
Rym: I want to join the army and go to college.

259
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,225
Rym: You know if there's a war you got a fight.

260
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:59,835
Rym: Yeah, whatever there won't be a war and then there is.

261
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:01,284
Scott: I didn't agree to This.

262
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:03,304
Scott: yes, you did Tough shit.

263
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:16,969
Rym: I'm generally of the mind that outside of extreme cases like if Genocide is about to occur or you're ordered to do something that is clearly Immoral and illegal like a boo grieve type stuff.

264
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,175
Rym: Yeah in any other situation.

265
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:31,572
Rym: I really don't think that members of the military of a sovereign nation should take it upon themselves to voice political or social opinion or Refuse officer are refused legal orders.

266
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:32,214
Scott: Yes, they.

267
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:32,415
Scott: so

268
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:53,760
Rym: while at that point That's what happened to Rome when the military starts becoming politicized, and I think one of the Biggest things that has made America not collapse over the last several hundred years well two or three hundred years give or take is That the military is by and large just done whatever it's been ordered even if what it was ordered to do Maybe say in the case of Iraq was stupid.

269
00:18:54,522 --> 00:19:09,363
Scott: Yeah, so as much as I'm against the Iraq war and I gotta feel bad for someone fighting it who doesn't want to be This guy's going to the military jail most likely and that's where he belongs and the court-martial Is in his future.

270
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:12,373
Rym: I can't say that I have that much sympathy for him sadly.

271
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:21,060
Scott: No, but at the same time People are basically saying, you know, he's taking an incredible risk blah blah blah, but other people get it already.

272
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,683
Rym: He's not new.

273
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,935
Rym: a lot of people have done this since the Iraq war started.

274
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:24,337
Scott: He's like.

275
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:26,204
Scott: they're like, oh no He's gonna be court-martialed.

276
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:31,620
Scott: and then all they say is let's make sure that they don't do anything illegal against him.

277
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:38,107
Scott: You know make sure they only give him what he deserves according to the military law and they don't you know secretly Kill him or something.

278
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:39,593
Rym: Yeah, they're gonna secretly kill him.

279
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:40,457
Rym: They'd get away with that.

280
00:19:40,477 --> 00:19:41,120
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure.

281
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,190
Scott: Well, they gotten away with a lot of other stuff, but they haven't.

282
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,356
Rym: we all know what's going on in that prison.

283
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:54,916
Scott: Oh See ya, I just thought it was interesting that you know people don't really notice when this happens so much.

284
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:56,100
Scott: and well here it happens.

285
00:19:56,181 --> 00:20:01,022
Scott: some guy in the military said I don't want to fight me more and What happens to you?

286
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:01,523
Scott: go to jail?

287
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:02,825
Scott: You can't do that.

288
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:10,760
Rym: things of the day.

00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:15,419
Scott: I got a thing of the day here and I don't before I tell you what it is.

290
00:20:15,842 --> 00:20:18,457
Scott: Let's let's do some drama acting here.

291
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:22,456
Rym: All right This is a lot like Dave and Joel a little bit a little bit a little bit cuz.

Rym: they haven't done that lately.

293
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:27,507
Scott: All right, so you begin praise Jesus.

294
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:30,223
Rym: you won't be saved without Jesus.

295
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:33,313
Rym: you have to start believing in Jesus to be saved.

296
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,419
Scott: Jesus will always be there for you.

297
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:39,614
Scott: Would it would it be so awful if we pushed her out when the doors open?

298
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:44,470
Rym: no, Jesus will save her The next one.

299
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:47,846
Scott: I think so, all right Paper beats rock BAM.

300
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:48,950
Scott: Your rock is blowed up.

301
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:50,374
Rym: BAM doesn't blow up.

302
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:51,679
Rym: BAM makes it spicy.

303
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,350
Rym: now I got a spicy rock.

304
00:20:53,391 --> 00:20:54,257
Rym: You can't defeat that.

305
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,224
Scott: So what this?

306
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:58,408
Scott: where these are from is?

307
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:01,056
Scott: there's a website called overheard in New York.

308
00:21:01,337 --> 00:21:05,271
Scott: calm and Basically what people do is they write there.

309
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:10,480
Scott: they write down things that they supposedly overheard people saying in New York.

310
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:17,609
Scott: So if you're sitting in a restaurant and someone near you has a funny conversation that you happen to overhear You type it into this website and there it is.

311
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:23,370
Scott: I'm pretty sure not all of these are true But regardless of that, I'm sure some of them are.

312
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:29,197
Scott: in fact, probably the majority are and this page I'm linking to you has the most popular ones.

313
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:32,613
Scott: and If you like the two things we just acted out.

314
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:34,120
Scott: that's the sort of stuff that's on this page.

315
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,029
Rym: It's kind of like a real-life New York City bash.org.

316
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:41,784
Scott: I was just gonna say it's like a bash.org IRL, dude I hit that so hard.

317
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:44,073
Rym: Whoever could pull me out would become the king of England.

318
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:45,799
Scott: That's my favorite line from the whole page.

319
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:51,099
Scott: Man I would totally hit that dude.

320
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:54,717
Scott: I would hit that so hard that you would be the king of England if you pulled me out.

321
00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:56,486
Rym: move nigga I'll cut you with my knife.

322
00:21:56,828 --> 00:21:57,331
Rym: Oh my god.

323
00:21:57,371 --> 00:22:03,010
Rym: He said the n-word knife *laughter* Supposedly on the Queen's Mount F train.

324
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,573
Scott: The best one.

325
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:04,055
Scott: Mother.

326
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:07,908
Scott: The mother says Don't you ever do that again and then slaps the kid.

327
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,520
Scott: and then the kid calmly says well, are you happy with yourself?

328
00:22:13,722 --> 00:22:20,980
Scott: That happened in Union Square Supposedly and oh the title is the Buddha was a tough kid to raise.

329
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:21,792
Scott: *laughter*.

330
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,359
Rym: That's the win.

331
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:30,020
Scott: Yeah, so if you want some I don't know good 10-20 minutes of humor depending on how fast you read and how long you laugh.

332
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:31,625
Scott: Check this page out.

333
00:22:32,147 --> 00:22:35,660
Rym: So my thing of the day is all over dig and it's in the forum and I think it's pretty good.

334
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,460
Rym: I just want to link to it because when I actually got around to watching it I really liked the little song and dance in the middle.

335
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:50,378
Scott: I did also like the song and dance and it was like one part of me was like I like that song and I like that dance but damn that's horrible.

336
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:55,483
Rym: Yeah I think the word we're looking for is macabre Perhaps perhaps.

337
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:57,128
Scott: I don't know if it really counts as macabre.

338
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,315
Rym: I think it's pretty macabre all things considered.

339
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:02,779
Rym: Yeah, it's definitely It's really a macabre.

340
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:07,817
Scott: Let's go look up what macabre actually means while you describe this video.

341
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:15,716
Rym: All right Well, I don't want to spoil it because you'll figure out what's going on pretty handily, but it's an awesome awesome Incredibly, okay.

342
00:23:17,102 --> 00:23:26,190
Scott: Um, okay just to show that how Rym correct how correct you are The I'm gonna read the three definitions of macabre.

343
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,671
Scott: Are you ready?

344
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:27,233
Scott: I'm ready.

345
00:23:27,313 --> 00:23:31,126
Scott: number one gruesome and horrifying Ghastly horrible.

346
00:23:31,548 --> 00:23:32,833
Scott: All right, it is those things.

347
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:41,200
Scott: Yeah - of Pertaining to dealing with or representing death, especially is grimmer or uglier aspect.

348
00:23:41,982 --> 00:23:43,787
Scott: I know you ready for number three.

349
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:54,379
Scott: I'm ready of or suggesting I can't of or suggestive of the allegorical dance of death.

350
00:23:57,701 --> 00:24:00,572
Scott: And that is exactly what this video is.

351
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,017
Scott: it is macabre definition.

352
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:05,652
Scott: number three Suggestive of the allegorical dance of death.

353
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:10,176
Rym: now I defy you Despite I mean this doesn't say a lot.

354
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:13,099
Rym: I mean the I guess the moral of this.

355
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:17,535
Rym: Well defense of what kind of person you are because you might think the moral is damn dead.

356
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:18,880
Rym: people dancing is awesome.

357
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:20,646
Scott: No, that's not what the moral is.

358
00:24:20,987 --> 00:24:24,540
Rym: Or maybe the moral is you know what it's worth any sacrifice for art?

359
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:25,804
Scott: No, that's not.

360
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:27,932
Scott: what the more not just watch it.

361
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:28,816
Rym: I really like it.

362
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:38,699
Rym: The animation is amazing Yeah and I defy you to watch it and not at least You'll be bobbing your head and kind of dancing with a guy or at least half in your foot I guarantee it.

363
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,630
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

364
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:41,576
Scott: the message though.

365
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:51,565
Scott: Is that You you know You don't these people they send people off to war as if they're trying to create a work of art with people's lives And that's that's probably not good.

366
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:53,753
Scott: and that's not good something like that.

367
00:24:53,853 --> 00:24:54,977
Scott: Yeah, right.

368
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:55,740
Rym: All right.

369
00:24:55,861 --> 00:25:00,480
Rym: So without further ado she was actually a man Rims gay.

370
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:07,940
Scott: That's not a spoiler It's not the point Charlie wins the chocolate factory at the end of this episode.

371
00:25:08,362 --> 00:25:09,486
Scott: We played the same closer.

372
00:25:09,526 --> 00:25:10,349
Scott: We plan every episode.

373
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:12,777
Rym: James Bond gets the girl in the end.

374
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:13,520
Scott: Sometimes he doesn't.

375
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:15,309
Rym: I think he almost always does.

376
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:16,396
Rym: Oh depends.

377
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:17,080
Scott: All right, not in the end.

378
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,120
Rym: How about just James Bond gets the girl at some point at some point?

379
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,170
Rym: He gets the girl like ten times private Ryan.

380
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:25,277
Rym: He uh, he makes it to the end.

381
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:26,060
Scott: Oh, does he?

382
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:28,607
Rym: It wasn't worth saying okay.

383
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:31,516
Scott: Well, I thought it was about saving private Ryan, right?

384
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:32,480
Rym: Yeah, so they win.

385
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:35,691
Scott: Oh it but isn't like a guy they're going to find and then save.

386
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:36,173
Scott: Yeah.

387
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,237
Scott: Yeah, so they find him.

388
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:40,119
Scott: Yeah, okay I thought he was one of those things that look for a guy.

389
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,023
Scott: Oh, not really there.

390
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:44,594
Rym: Jesus gets whipped the shit out of but then he comes back.

391
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:45,978
Scott: We know that one.

392
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:50,530
Scott: Yeah So a lot of people especially certainly greatest people.

393
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,454
Rym: Yeah, Rosebud was a slide.

394
00:25:53,056 --> 00:25:53,818

Rym: they especially in the model at O'Hare is a bitch.

398
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:17,166
Scott: in the modern times of the Internet's Spoilers have become more and more of an issue and a lot of people have different opinions on to how Spoilers should be dealt with.

399
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:22,828
Scott: a lot of people say, you know, ah, you know There's a satchel limitations on these things.

400
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:26,459
Scott: if it's older than like a few years and you didn't see it already tough shit.

401
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:30,692
Scott: and other People say oh, you should never spoil anything for everybody you ass.

402
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:33,200
Scott: and other people say and who cares?

403
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,447
Scott: It's your own damn fault.

404
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,857
Scott: You should have been listening.

405
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:45,439
Rym: Whatever I really have mixed feelings about it because on one hand it would Sudden me greatly if someone who had not seen cowboy bebop had the end ruin for them before they saw it.

406
00:26:45,861 --> 00:26:48,693
Rym: Like that would bother me and it really bothers me when people spoil.

407
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:51,717
Rym: things like that are in my presence Not just anime, but anything like that.

408
00:26:52,221 --> 00:26:59,668
Rym: But at the same time when those people were running around all over the internet spoiling the Harry Potter book before it came out That was awesome.

409
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:07,980
Rym: I couldn't help but laugh hysterically every time I ran into someone in counter-strike named OMG Snape or Dumbledore dies.

410
00:27:08,382 --> 00:27:09,267
Scott: Is that what is that?

411
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,654
Rym: or Snape kills Dumbledore?

412
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:11,398
Scott: That's what it was.

413
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:15,060
Scott: Yeah I remember on that day someone was playing counter-strike with that name.

414
00:27:15,502 --> 00:27:19,179
Rym: Remember very specifically, you know what multiple people were playing with that name that day?

415
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,824
Rym: I think there were servers.

416
00:27:20,864 --> 00:27:27,543
Scott: people are making user new accounts on sites like slash dot and Fark with that is the username It was.

417
00:27:28,306 --> 00:27:32,057
Rym: and while it might have been just as horrible as a spoiler for some reason.

418
00:27:32,078 --> 00:27:37,820
Rym: I found it hilarious Maybe because I don't care about Harry Potter maybe or maybe because people took it so seriously.

419
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:44,420
Scott: Yeah, I think generally the but my personal spoiler policy, right?

420
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,470
Scott: Is that I'm not gonna go spoiling something on purpose?

421
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,794
Scott: because what what's the point?

422
00:27:48,854 --> 00:27:54,327
Scott: Well, except for all the things we just spoiled Well, I mean, you know something You know that at like actively like.

423
00:27:54,428 --> 00:27:57,337
Scott: I know you haven't seen this and I'm gonna get you the odds.

424
00:27:57,397 --> 00:27:58,340
Rym: are we spoiled something for?

425
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,102
Rym: Someone just now.

426
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:08,994
Scott: Yeah, but I mean there's some stuff where it's like everyone knows like I Knew that Darth Vader was his father without even having seen Empire Strikes Back.

427
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:13,048
Scott: Yeah, even remember anyone, dude I don't even remember a point at which it was spoiled.

428
00:28:13,469 --> 00:28:16,740
Scott: It's just like I always knew like I always knew my name was Scott.

429
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:24,697
Rym: Well, I do remember the wonderful story Greg told us back in the day about how they came out of the.

430
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:37,649
Rym: it was that I think was the second episode of Star Wars like the new episodes yeah, and they're walking out and there's the line of people going in to see the second showing like the one right after the midnight showing and He just says kind of loudly man.

431
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:38,916
Rym: I can't believe they killed Yoda.

432
00:28:38,937 --> 00:28:39,520
Rym: That was crap.

433
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,827
Scott: This is this was Star Wars Episode 2.

434
00:28:41,827 --> 00:28:46,441
Scott: So if you're smart you realize Yoda dies in episode 6.

435
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:49,353
Scott: Yeah, so how could he possibly die in episode?

436
00:28:49,413 --> 00:28:51,100
Rym: So he says this, you know, I can't believe they killed Yoda.

437
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,702
Rym: That's crap.

438
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,872
Rym: and some guy in the lines like way to go asshole.

439
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:57,180
Rym: and then he stops and realizes what he's just said.

440
00:28:57,381 --> 00:29:03,842
Rym: Yeah, I just got eggs his head while the crowd starts flat pointing and laughing pointing laughing Laughing.

441
00:29:03,902 --> 00:29:16,460
Rym: is the awesome that that is perhaps the best kind of spoiler in the world because you get all of the shock and the humor of a spoiler Plus the humiliation of an idiot plus you didn't actually spoil anything.

442
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:28,529
Scott: Yeah, my feeling though more recently is that you know, okay a spoiler can potentially ruin someone's Potential experience of a work of art like six cents.

443
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:32,440
Scott: six cents can the movie can provide like how long is it?

444
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,278
Scott: Like a couple hours.

445
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:42,239
Scott: Well, unless you're smart unless you're smart But it could potentially provide a couple hours of pretty awesome entertainment with a with a very enjoyable shock at the end.

446
00:29:42,901 --> 00:29:48,435
Scott: But if someone tells you right what the shock at the end is then you are.

447
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:53,913
Scott: you basically lost all this potential Enjoyment you could have might have gained while watching this movie.

448
00:29:53,973 --> 00:29:57,967
Scott: and now basically like six cents I believe is a movie that you cannot watch more than once.

449
00:29:58,469 --> 00:30:00,696
Scott: it's basically not in no circumstance.

450
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:05,194
Scott: watching it a second time Would be any even close to as enjoyable as the first time.

451
00:30:05,314 --> 00:30:06,619
Rym: see I could actually disagree there.

452
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:13,759
Rym: Yeah because here's why when you watch through it the first time a lot of weird things happen and you might not remember them too clearly.

453
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:19,080
Rym: like If you didn't figure it out you get to the end and suddenly you figure it out the way they handle.

454
00:30:19,802 --> 00:30:39,513
Rym: Thus the spoiler at the end of that throughout the movie to make sure that it makes sense is Actually pretty ingenious at a lot of times and if you watch the movie again Or if you just figured it out and knew what was going on the whole time It's almost a different movie just because you're watching How like you you can't imagine how you didn't pick it up before.

455
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:40,116
Scott: Yeah, baby.

456
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,220
Scott: It's a different movie.

457
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:51,140
Scott: See, it's sort of like this this thing this sort of non-physical Like enjoy like specific enjoyment of a specific thing you could have attained has just been taken away from you.

458
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,746
Scott: Yeah, it's like an opportunity.

459
00:30:52,786 --> 00:31:01,948
Scott: cost has been snatched from your future and you can no law You know unless someone brainwashes you or you lose your memory You're pretty much never gonna get it.

460
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:05,078
Rym: But at the same time too as I talked about last night.

461
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:15,138
Rym: I Spoiled neon Genesis Evangelion one of my favorite anime ever Entirely on my own by myself because I was an idiot long before I watched the show.

462
00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:15,559
Rym: Mm-hmm.

463
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:22,680
Rym: So as a result, I watched the whole show Knowing how it ended and I saw it a lot differently as a result.

464
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,420
Rym: But I can't say that the way I saw it in the end actually hindered my enjoyment of it.

465
00:31:27,661 --> 00:31:30,780
Rym: But then again that might just be because of the direction Ava goes.

466
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:46,140
Scott: Well, that's what I. that's what the point I'm getting at Is that if your work of art, you know because any kind of work of art can have a spoiler, you know If your work of art Can it's possible for someone to not be able to enjoy it fully or in a certain way?

467
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,870
Scott: Because they know a certain piece of information.

468
00:31:49,352 --> 00:31:51,080
Scott: What does that say about your work of art?

469
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,480
Scott: It's only enjoyable for someone who doesn't know a certain piece of information.

470
00:31:54,804 --> 00:32:06,860
Rym: But at the same time I debate There's also the idea like you could spoil the end of cowboy bebop and all that takes away is the shock of all the things That go on but it still doesn't take away the journey or the experience.

471
00:32:07,081 --> 00:32:07,825
Scott: That's why I can't be.

472
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:10,559
Scott: bop is still watchable like 10,000 times and it doesn't suck.

473
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:11,403
Rym: But I can't.

474
00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:15,400
Rym: I can't think of too many things where the spoiler in and of itself entirely ruins it.

475
00:32:15,781 --> 00:32:17,487
Scott: There are some that ruin it.

476
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:19,234
Scott: Maybe not entirely.

477
00:32:19,254 --> 00:32:21,000
Rym: the only war I can do one complete.

478
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:23,275
Rym: I can think of one that would be the usual suspects.

479
00:32:23,436 --> 00:32:27,451
Scott: Yeah Kind of I really like watching the usual suspects like a hundred times.

480
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:30,281
Scott: I didn't figure that one out even why that was kind of Weird.

481
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:33,116
Scott: it was like the one movie Rym had never seen and I was like, oh my god.

482
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:36,229
Scott: Yeah But yeah, I can watch that like a hundred times.

483
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:48,212
Rym: our group has this problem where if there's it's not really a problem but whenever there's certain movies that each one of us has kind of up our bot like a stick and they're just always they're Bothering us if there's anyone in the world who hasn't seen these movies.

484
00:32:48,493 --> 00:32:49,898
Scott: Yeah, it's so you haven't seen that.

485
00:32:49,918 --> 00:32:50,500
Scott: sit down right now.

486
00:32:50,601 --> 00:33:02,498
Rym: So like I have my list and Scott has his list everyone We know as their list and pretty much if anyone in the room admits to have never not seen one of the movies on Anyone's list someone's on their way to blockbuster already, even though we hate blockbuster.

487
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:05,695
Scott: Yeah Yeah, but it's the only place to get a movie on short notice.

488
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:06,579
Scott: Well pirates Bay?

489
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:12,500
Scott: Well, I guess blockbuster can even be faster than pirates.

490
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,775
Rym: I think the real problem here is that it's you can't make spoilers.

491
00:33:16,815 --> 00:33:20,936
Rym: go away because think about it They I think about all the things you a spoiler does.

492
00:33:21,016 --> 00:33:27,436
Rym: it's basically You can really color someone's perception of something and it takes zero effort on your part.

493
00:33:27,516 --> 00:33:32,395
Rym: and yet it has this huge effect on a Person especially depending on the person in the movie and on the internet.

494
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:33,740
Scott: It's also not necessarily movies.

495
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,888
Scott: It could be video games comics novels.

496
00:33:35,988 --> 00:33:37,393
Rym: She's an esper.

497
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:45,463
Rym: Yeah, Scott Johnson our friend Scott Johnson famously ruined Probably the.

498
00:33:45,543 --> 00:33:48,395
Rym: I just wrote fantasy say yeah, we just spoiled it too, but you know what?

499
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:49,560
Rym: statute of limitations?

500
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:50,665
Scott: Yeah, I guess.

501
00:33:50,986 --> 00:34:00,224
Rym: but this was a while ago and even then I still felt statute of limitations but at the same time I'd always kind of avoided talking about the end of that game because I knew people hadn't played it and I kind of wanted him to.

502
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:08,130
Rym: and Scott Johnson just out of the blue is like well at the end blah blah blah when she's an esper and blah blah blah and She's an esper is like the middle of the game.

503
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:11,609
Rym: It's a little bit past the middle Yeah, but it's not like the the end.

504
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,041
Scott: and that's not the big thing at the end, you know It's.

505
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:15,389
Rym: I think it's more of a spoiler than the.

506
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:17,400
Scott: it is more of a spoiler than the end itself.

507
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,906
Rym: It's just whatever Final Fantasy.

508
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:20,130
Scott: Yeah, of course.

509
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:33,413
Rym: It's not like there wasn't enough foreshadowing for that But I just remember it turned out there was one person in the crew who had not played the game at that time and She turns around and flips ever living hell out on Scott.

510
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:34,978
Scott: Yeah, it was good times.

511
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:42,420
Scott: Yes Yeah, but basically my policy on spoilers is that you know, I'm not gonna go out of my way to spoil something.

512
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:47,120
Scott: But if I feel that, you know, this is something that everyone's seen I'm kind of come.

513
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,478
Scott: It's like if I'm comfortable just saying it in public.

514
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:56,159
Scott: good I'm comfortable just saying it like I'm comfortable walking around the street going Darth Vader's Luke's father or Rosebud was the sled.

515
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:57,687
Scott: Yeah, that's not a problem.

516
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:59,918
Scott: But saying other stuff is a problem.

517
00:34:59,938 --> 00:35:02,489
Rym: for a second I thought you were gonna spoil something big just to be funny.

518
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:04,035
Scott: No, I wasn't because it's not.

519
00:35:04,056 --> 00:35:05,060
Scott: I'm not comfortable saying it.

520
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,593
Scott: nah, and that's the point.

521
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:16,880
Scott: and When I'm just in you know a new situation or just in general I'll follow my own personal guide and if that happens to conflict with yours as just the tough shit.

522
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:22,992
Rym: But see the problem, but I was trying to allude to is that on the internet It takes no effort and yet you get all this result.

523
00:35:23,052 --> 00:35:33,940
Rym: It's a great way to grief people Especially people who might not take it so well and there's really absolutely no way to protect yourself from it Other than to watch as much media as you can as fast as possible.

524
00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:43,418
Scott: See so what I do on the internet is you know on the internet if you're commenting You're usually in a forum or on a blog or something and I tend to do the when in Rome.

525
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:47,869
Scott: on the internet You know depending on where I am I do what people in that place do.

526
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:50,900
Scott: so on FARC people spoil whatever they don't care.

527
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:56,139
Rym: So I do the same thing and actually there was a big uproar about the Harry Potter things on FARC.

528
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:06,087
Rym: Well, but total Farkers were mad that pretty much every single story submitted for a day and a half was just Dumbledore dies Dumbledore dies snake Dumbledore.

529
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:07,271
Scott: That's good stuff.

530
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:10,580
Rym: But the thing is they're also a lot of fake spoilers, which has made it even more hilarious.

531
00:36:10,943 --> 00:36:12,800
Scott: Yeah, and we'll talk about that in a second.

532
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:20,442
Scott: But also like on a forum like people tend to do the put the word spoiler in your you know Topic.

533
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:32,888
Scott: if you started the topic and you're making a comment use the hidden text and you know I do that, you know, cuz that's just whatever the people there do I'll do what they do and that way, you know No one can blame me for anything because that

534
00:36:32,908 --> 00:36:34,112
Rym: really seems following the rules.

535
00:36:34,213 --> 00:36:37,468
Rym: spoilers as far as I handle them it's any other.

536
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:41,208
Rym: it's another matter of social etiquette and It seemed it generally.

537
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:47,356
Rym: it's very crass to me or very Uncultured when especially at an anime club or an anime con.

538
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,240
Rym: It's just a good example.

539
00:36:48,363 --> 00:36:49,159
Scott: That's a really bad.

540
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:56,940
Rym: You can always tell the fanboys and the generally annoying people from the cool people Because the annoying people walk over and say like out of the blue.

541
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,410
Rym: It's like they almost like they're not trying to spoil things.

542
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,080
Scott: There's like they assume that you're because they're such nerds.

543
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:07,880
Scott: They seem to assume that like you've seen what they've seen that you're watching like episodes as there are they come up like man.

544
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,380
Rym: It was great when so-and-so died or God.

545
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:25,460
Rym: I remember when I saw someone taking a picture of a cosplayer and then some other cosplayer walks up wearing another costume and both characters that they were cosplaying as Happened to have been killed in their respective animes and the guy says the other man, isn't it great?

546
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:31,720
Rym: We're both playing characters who totally got killed in the middle of the anime and like ten people turned around and glared at them.

547
00:37:31,922 --> 00:37:41,363
Scott: It was great Good times, but yeah, one thing that there are things you can do when you accidentally spoil something for somebody to Recuperate.

548
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:43,148
Rym: well depending on the crowd.

549
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:44,211
Scott: It does depend on the crowd.

550
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:49,944
Scott: My favorite method though that I have to share with you is the doubt Creation method.

551
00:37:50,004 --> 00:38:00,858
Scott: for example, I will tell Rym a character X dies What or does character Y die as or does every character die?

552
00:38:00,898 --> 00:38:02,703
Scott: See I Probably in.

553
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:08,484
Scott: Rym knows now that in all likelihood character X dies because of the way it might you know The way I said it.

554
00:38:08,564 --> 00:38:09,410
Scott: it's kind of obvious.

555
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,054
Scott: In fact, it's 99% obvious.

556
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:25,660
Scott: But by saying those other things Rym or someone who wanted to at least depending on Rym wanted to or not He could in his mind Justify at least a small amount of doubt as to whether I actually just spoiled it for him or not.

557
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:34,480
Scott: So while watching whatever it is I just spoiled or reading it He could keep in his mind the slight question of is it gonna be character X or Y?

558
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,699
Scott: He'll probably be like I was probably X. Scott totally spoiled it for me.

559
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:40,093
Scott: And then when he gets to it and it is X it like yup.

560
00:38:40,114 --> 00:38:41,160
Scott: Scott totally spoiled it for me.

561
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:47,891
Scott: but that small amount of doubt leaves a small possibility of Getting the original experience.

562
00:38:48,113 --> 00:38:50,584
Scott: if you want it badly enough You can sort of you.

563
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:56,383
Scott: you can grab on to that and create more doubt in your mind that it wasn't actually Spoiled for you.

564
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:57,869
Rym: now, that's the immediate cover-up.

565
00:38:57,909 --> 00:39:00,499
Rym: Let's say that you just for whatever reason tend to spoil things.

566
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,680
Rym: often You're just not careful about it or you're worried about doing it in the future.

567
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:12,539
Rym: You can inoculate everyone, you know against it by just kind of randomly always making jokes and falsely spoiling things all the time.

568
00:39:12,921 --> 00:39:14,185
Rym: Yeah, how many people like.

569
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:17,617
Rym: they'll spoil anime randomly to kind of like yeah, everyone dies at the end of that.

570
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,388
Rym: Yep Yeah, they kill everyone.

571
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,819
Rym: Yeah main character dies.

572
00:39:22,161 --> 00:39:26,239
Scott: Yeah, so like whenever you watch a new show be like I heard about this show and main character dies.

573
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:27,846
Scott: Well, I heard about this show.

574
00:39:27,886 --> 00:39:28,850
Scott: No one dies at all.

575
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,460
Scott: But yeah, the whole world explodes and they'll fly off into space.

576
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:33,891
Scott: Yep, or yeah, I heard about this show.

577
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:35,900
Scott: the second character gets syphilis.

578
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:38,870
Rym: Now the funny thing is that the the everybody dies.

579
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:39,593
Rym: cliche at least.

580
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:41,780
Rym: anime came from the fact that there's a fairly killer.

581
00:39:42,021 --> 00:39:43,268
Rym: You know well-known.

582
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:45,459
Rym: I anime a couple anime but one in particular.

583
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:45,680
Rym: where?

584
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:49,840
Scott: Everyone actually does die and quite a few anime where everyone dies.

585
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,739
Scott: Well, yeah, at least almost everyone dies.

586
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:59,251
Rym: But if you if you tell someone that especially someone who hasn't seen anime or just in general They just don't even assume that that's a possibility.

587
00:39:59,452 --> 00:40:01,440
Rym: How many movies are there where everyone dies?

588
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:09,360
Rym: I mean even in Doctor Strangelove at least a few people survived.

589
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:17,948
Scott: Well, I guess it depends what you mean by everyone because this the everyone dies where the entire world and all humanity is gone Right, and then there's the everyone dies.

590
00:40:17,968 --> 00:40:18,249
Scott: We're like.

591
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,814
Scott: all the named characters die.

592
00:40:19,854 --> 00:40:28,271
Scott: So like Romeo and Juliet It's actually kind of fair to say everyone dies in a way, you know, but Benvolio doesn't die though No, but he's not everyone.

593
00:40:28,412 --> 00:40:31,403
Rym: Yeah He's not everyone.

594
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:32,987
Rym: he's a semi-major character.

595
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:34,592
Scott: you get my point though.

596
00:40:34,652 --> 00:40:35,956
Rym: Yeah Mercutio dies though.

597
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:37,520
Rym: Maybe he doesn't even.

598
00:40:42,545 --> 00:40:43,431
Rym: You see what I did there.

599
00:40:43,592 --> 00:40:46,385
Scott: I see what you did there Actually, it's funny.

600
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:49,560
Rym: Yeah part of the reason we thought about this was on the way to work.

601
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:58,100
Rym: I was listening to movies you should see and they spoiled something in seven when they were reviewing seven Which was a good review because seven is still a great movie and I really like it.

602
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:02,243
Scott: Yeah, seven is definitely a movie that's hard to spoil Not really.

603
00:41:02,263 --> 00:41:06,360
Scott: Ah, like you could tell what happens at the end, but it doesn't really ruin them experience.

604
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:07,712
Rym: Oh, no, that's not what they spoiled.

605
00:41:07,812 --> 00:41:08,700
Rym: what they spoiled?

606
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:12,000
Rym: Well, they kind of spoiled that but they spoiled one.

607
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:20,111
Rym: There's a shock scene in during one of the murders Investigations, ah, I think you know which one I'm talking about I know what you talk about and they ruined it.

608
00:41:20,393 --> 00:41:22,763
Rym: and then they basically said oh, we'll bleep it out later Don't worry about it.

609
00:41:22,823 --> 00:41:25,895
Rym: And I guess they forgot to ha ha so it's still in there.

610
00:41:25,915 --> 00:41:29,066
Scott: Oh Fun time.

611
00:41:29,469 --> 00:41:30,940
Rym: yeah, luckily I've seen that movie twice.

612
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:32,283
Scott: Yeah, I think.

613
00:41:32,344 --> 00:41:42,820
Scott: generally though what it all comes down to is if you're gonna Spoil things you need to like give a warning, you know That's all and then it's up to people whether they want to listen or not.

614
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:48,180
Scott: And if they listen and they get it spoiled then it's their fault and you don't have to feel like you did anything bad.

615
00:41:48,682 --> 00:41:55,315
Scott: And that's what we do on the podcast and that's what I do in regular life Like oh is everyone I'll be like, hey has everyone here seen this?

616
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:56,440
Scott: Okay, let's talk about it.

617
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,104
Rym: Yep, and you know what?

618
00:41:57,245 --> 00:41:58,653
Rym: That's just basic social etiquette.

619
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:02,856
Scott: Yeah but yeah spoiling is becoming a big problem.

620
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:11,593
Scott: because Well to see more people are seeing more media and they're communicating with more people at once in a more public and more difficult to avoid.

621
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:20,502
Scott: fashion and Information travels faster and more widely and et gets home, you know, yeah, it Marty McFly gets back to 1985.

622
00:42:20,502 --> 00:42:38,080
Scott: It's really hard to see all forms of art and experience them before Information about those works of art gets to your brain and on the internet It's getting to the point where there's no way to be careful other than not going to any websites.

623
00:42:39,102 --> 00:42:45,083
Scott: Yeah, I mean it even comes to things like not even works of art, but for example Like knowing the out.

624
00:42:45,123 --> 00:42:50,076
Scott: like I we don't have television here and it's not possible to watch sporting events live.

625
00:42:50,216 --> 00:42:51,600
Scott: very often Gandalf dies.

626
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:52,892
Scott: yeah, so

627
00:42:53,194 --> 00:42:53,558
Rym: when I

628
00:42:54,921 --> 00:43:06,660
Scott: When a sports event happens, right and I want to watch that sports event perhaps, you know on a delayed video or something like that You know Like watch a Formula One race the next day on the train and I don't want to know who won.

629
00:43:07,182 --> 00:43:15,850
Scott: I basically can't read the news or else I'll find out who won and I have to sort of not Take in any information watch it and then read the news.

630
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,076
Scott: Yep, and it's kind of sucky.

631
00:43:18,437 --> 00:43:20,185
Scott: It's really prohibitive I guess.

632
00:43:20,246 --> 00:43:22,000
Rym: luckily this is kind of sad.

633
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,720
Rym: But I think back and all the like all the media that I really would have cared about a spoiler.

634
00:43:27,243 --> 00:43:32,539
Rym: I mean there are some things a lot of anime in a few movies that if someone has spoiled them I would have been incredibly angry.

635
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:38,360
Rym: But I haven't seen anything in recent memory where having a spoiler or not having a spoiler would have mattered to me.

636
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:40,675
Rym: Yeah, so I feel like I'm immune.

637
00:43:41,058 --> 00:43:45,822
Scott: also I can't remember a time where something was spoiled for me like.

638
00:43:46,203 --> 00:43:57,157
Scott: I don't remember a single one I can and but also at the same time a lot of things have been spoiled like by myself because like the foreshadowing just tells me what to expect.

639
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:07,280
Rym: and then You know and I see it you were the one bitching at me when we were watching Gundam seed because I kept predicting what was gonna happen based on the opening animation and I was always right.

640
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:11,319
Scott: Yeah, I know you were right, but I also knew you were right cuz I had seen it.

641
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:18,040
Rym: Yeah But the fact that you know the opener to that anime spoils all the plot except for one thing.

642
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,420
Scott: But I was trying to do is I was trying to create the doubt to sort of prevent you from spoiling for you.

643
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:29,119
Rym: Ah, but see much like my arguments in a lot of philosophical realms I cannot abide in cognitive dissonance.

644
00:44:29,602 --> 00:44:36,272
Rym: So if I know something there is nothing in the world that can get me Even if I want to to pretend that I don't know it.

645
00:44:36,894 --> 00:44:38,220
Scott: Well, that's just your problem.

646
00:44:38,421 --> 00:44:41,160
Rym: Yeah, it was actually I'm reading but I watch Gundam seed.

647
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:50,754
Scott: I knew just as well as you did what all those openers alluding to but I purposefully said and it's just an opener They don't have to make the show the same as the ocean.

648
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:51,820
Rym: I don't have that ability.

649
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,362
Rym: It's funny cuz.

650
00:44:52,422 --> 00:44:56,936
Scott: actually it is true though that they could make the show different from the opener.

651
00:44:57,077 --> 00:45:00,137
Rym: that never happens It could I don't think it's ever happened.

652
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:01,594
Scott: I think.

653
00:45:01,695 --> 00:45:05,151
Scott: Oh Tana No, no, cuz you know horses.

654
00:45:06,115 --> 00:45:06,959
Scott: Um horses.

655
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:13,275
Rym: I win All right, so in shoujo kakumei Utena, which is one of my favorite anime series ever.

656
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:16,265
Rym: Don't don't The movie's crap.

657
00:45:16,808 --> 00:45:30,379
Rym: I just got to say that whenever I bring up this show But in the opener pretty much everything you see in the opener happens throughout the show and at the end of the opener there's the scene of the two main characters on armored horses wearing armor like flying up into the sky.

658
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:34,300
Rym: and We had a friend whose name was dammit Dwayne.

659
00:45:34,944 --> 00:45:46,119
Rym: Dammit Dwayne dammit Dwayne Dwayne like to smoke the pot a little bit to the watch to the point that None of his pot dealer friends would sell him pot because they thought he should stop smoking it.

660
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,443
Scott: He had some problems.

661
00:45:47,784 --> 00:45:51,856
Scott: for anyone who says, you know marijuana doesn't hurt you marijuana blah marijuana this right?

662
00:45:52,197 --> 00:45:53,020
Scott: You're probably right.

663
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,771
Scott: You know marijuana is probably not as bad as that smoking anything else.

664
00:45:56,912 --> 00:46:02,229
Rym: I think the difference is benefits one joint per Week versus one joint per.

665
00:46:02,389 --> 00:46:05,480
Rym: yeah, I don't know if you mean oak marijuana in quantity.

666
00:46:05,621 --> 00:46:06,765
Scott: I don't care what you say.

667
00:46:06,785 --> 00:46:09,615
Scott: You will turn into a complete useless dumb.

668
00:46:09,656 --> 00:46:10,820
Rym: It'll turn into dammit Dwayne.

669
00:46:10,961 --> 00:46:11,704
Rym: Yeah who provide?

670
00:46:11,925 --> 00:46:17,279
Rym: he was the best dungeon master in the world for 20 minutes And then it all went downhill from there.

671
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,755
Rym: But actually we heard he stopped smoking pot and he made something of himself.

672
00:46:22,056 --> 00:46:23,040
Scott: We'll see how true that is.

673
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,586
Rym: Yeah, how are we gonna find out?

674
00:46:24,606 --> 00:46:25,389
Rym: I don't know.

675
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:26,494
Rym: There's no way to find out.

676
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:27,940
Rym: I've cut ties to all those people.

677
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:28,758
Scott: I don't really care.

678
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:40,554
Rym: But anyway This kid was convinced that that scene in the opener where they get on the horses and fly into the sky Was gonna be in the movie because he'd seen the whole show and it wasn't in the show.

679
00:46:40,975 --> 00:46:44,819
Rym: and he knew because he's so much Smarter than everyone else that that's what was gonna happen in the movie.

680
00:46:45,831 --> 00:46:51,136
Rym: and He was so devastated when he saw the movie and that wasn't there like he cried.

681
00:46:51,457 --> 00:46:52,060
Rym: He just lost it.

682
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:02,139
Scott: That's not what I would cry over yeah, but that's what I figured the naked cars would have more of an effect But I don't know what kind of effect that was.

683
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:07,440
Rym: Cuz at that point when the naked cars come on screen, you can't think what the hell you just kind of roll with it.

684
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,809
Rym: At that point it was the weed crying.

685
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:12,807
Scott: Oh Yeah, so that's what we got to say about spoilers.

686
00:47:12,827 --> 00:47:16,417
Scott: got anything else, uh, not particularly spoilers are on the internet.

687
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:32,601
Scott: beware if a work of art can be spoiled so horribly that you know, there's no more enjoyment in it just because you know something then I Personally think that that work of art is inferior to say watchmen which can be spoiled but is enjoyable no matter how much you know About it.

688
00:47:33,003 --> 00:47:37,237
Rym: I don't know if watchmen were if what happens in watchmen had been spoiled for me.

689
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:39,125
Scott: Oh, yeah, it would suck I do not deny.

690
00:47:39,225 --> 00:47:41,780
Scott: but what I'm saying is that watchmen is superior.

691
00:47:42,143 --> 00:47:49,540
Scott: Let's say there was a work of art It was spoiled right and now you could not enjoy it period or you enjoyed it significantly less.

692
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,949
Scott: Watchmen in even if you know the spoiler.

693
00:47:53,170 --> 00:48:02,370
Scott: sure that decreases the enjoyment of the first reading But it's still stupidly enjoyable every time and thus gets respect Whereas something else would get less respect.

694
00:48:02,873 --> 00:48:08,175
Rym: and for a final spoiler I'm about to go play a bunch of counter-strike source because I kind of like it.

695
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:16,021
Scott: now that I've finally played it I'm gonna go read that giant like 600 page gunsmith cats omnibus volume 2.

696
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:16,965
Rym: So I'm holding out on that.

697
00:48:16,985 --> 00:48:17,969
Rym: I got other things to read.

698
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:22,444
Scott: Well, I also got gunsmith cats burst volume 1.

699
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:23,278
