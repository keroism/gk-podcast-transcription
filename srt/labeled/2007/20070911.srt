1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,170
Rym: So you might notice the lack of music lack of all the normal accoutrement of a GeekNights episode.

2
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:07,474
Scott: What does that mean?

3
00:00:07,895 --> 00:00:10,442
Rym: It means it's time for a GeekNights special.

4
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:11,927
Scott: Oh, man's right now.

5
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:13,832
Scott: I'm in Flushing.

6
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:16,540
Scott: well as when we normally would have been recording this.

7
00:00:17,323 --> 00:00:28,428
Scott: I'm in flushing New York at some baseballs Yep, and I am just home doing nothing probably playing bioshock Of course, you're probably listening to this the day after in which case I'm probably at work or who knows.

8
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:35,070
Rym: but yeah The point is I know we have a lot of new listeners And I just want to tell you all that this is not a normal episode of GeekNights.

9
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:42,225
Rym: It is a GeekNights special which is a code word for We're too lazy to do a whole show for whatever reasons or coming out some.

10
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:48,569
Scott: something ending with Z Is is what usually provokes a special busy lazy nosy?

11
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:54,064
Rym: Right so tonight we realized we haven't really talked about this.

12
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:54,767
Rym: I mean it's Tuesday.

13
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:55,450
Rym: It's gaming night.

14
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:12,238
Rym: We talked a lot about German board games and sometimes crappy American board games and video games all those things occasionally sport related things, but We haven't talked about something that a kind of game that we used to play a lot And we don't so much anymore, but I kind of want to.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,879
Scott: yeah the kind of game obviously is the card game now You know nowadays.

16
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:18,350
Scott: There's a whole lot of kinds of card games.

17
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,181
Scott: You know mad just collectible card games like Magic the Gathering.

18
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:28,146
Scott: There's non collectible card games like Guillotine yeah, but the great dal muti Lux or Chrononauts.

19
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:36,317
Scott: But we're talking about traditional card games that you play with a standard You know deck of playing cards.

20
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:39,488
Scott: you know the 52 card deck with the spades the diamonds the hearts.

21
00:01:39,508 --> 00:01:45,760
Rym: you know Euchre P-knuckle gin rummy Romy Michigan rummy.

22
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:50,058
Rym: Yeah Of course fish.

23
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:52,790
Rym: Yeah, I mean there's a lot of these games old maid old maid.

24
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,029
Scott: You actually play with an old maid deck.

25
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,774
Rym: It's bad.

26
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:56,626
Scott: you realize an old man with an old maid day.

27
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,721
Rym: while that is true You do realize that an old maid deck is just a normal deck of.

28
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:01,830
Scott: I know but an old maid deck is superior.

29
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:04,598
Scott: Yeah, so the game.

30
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:05,882
Scott: We want to talk about is perhaps.

31
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:09,526
Scott: We're not going to talk about why but well We're not gonna talk about the other card game.

32
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:11,615
Scott: We will Because someday.

33
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:20,510
Rym: today the thing the real issue here Is that card games are really on the decline and you don't see a lot of younger people playing these games that poker in the you?

34
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:23,870
Rym: yeah, but I'm not gonna talk about poker.

35
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:32,586
Rym: I don't want to anger anyone just yet But I'll say this we're talking about not poker in the popular games like that But trick-taking games, which is the majority of good card games.

36
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:37,410
Scott: well I don't know about they're not all good, but we're gonna talk about hearts.

37
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,190
Rym: Specifically what I would say is that trick-taking card games are they make up the body of them of good card games on average?

38
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:44,412
Rym: Yes

39
00:02:44,493 --> 00:03:02,700
Scott: in terms of games played Games that are popular and well known and have a long tradition that are played with a deck of playing cards that involve some measure of Thinking and strategy and skill in order to win as opposed to just luck or some outside Something outside the game like betting or

40
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:04,770
Rym: in the case of Euchre cheating.

41
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:14,055
Scott: Yes The trick-taking games like hearts and whist and spades and such are the best and of those I think hearts is the most enjoyable.

42
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:18,790
Rym: I think hearts is honestly probably the most experience with it's the most strategic, too.

43
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,941
Rym: I mean, I'm not gonna argue about the finer points.

44
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,289
Rym: or what about cribbage bridge or what about bridge?

45
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:24,630
Rym: bridge?

46
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,790
Scott: I think is technically, but I don't know how to play bridge and but from what I've heard bridges is a pretty good game.

47
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:36,194
Rym: Here's here's what I would say bridge is a really good really strategic Great game.

48
00:03:36,535 --> 00:03:38,301
Rym: the problem is bridge.

49
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:40,489
Rym: I think tries to do too much with it.

50
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:42,236
Scott: Yeah, I've seen those old people play.

51
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:45,850
Scott: they have like this big like plastic thing with flags and lights.

52
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,678
Scott: I don't know if there's lights, but it's got all this.

53
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:48,200
Rym: no lights.

54
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:50,510
Scott: It's got all this stuff outside of the cards.

55
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,837
Scott: It's like a bunch of extra stuff.

56
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,325
Scott: go well the thing is really complicated.

57
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:57,650
Rym: the reason car There's a looks complicated to kind of existed is that it was kind of a standardized thing.

58
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,613
Rym: you know everyone could get a hold or make or find a deck somewhere and People didn't.

59
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,280
Rym: really there weren't a lot of board games.

60
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,730
Rym: You could just buy especially not good ones anywhere.

61
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:12,490
Scott: Yeah, imagine if you had to buy You know like a different you know deck of cards for each game.

62
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,750
Scott: It's sort of like we went backwards in terms of you know technology in terms of games.

63
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,161
Scott: We used to have one set of cards And you played every game with the one set and that's all you needed.

64
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:25,201
Scott: now you got a freaking collect 10,000 cards to play one game.

65
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:26,890
Scott: so like money the wasting.

66
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:30,221
Rym: So as we had this you know standardized deck.

67
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:31,970
Rym: that kind of evolved over the years.

68
00:04:32,492 --> 00:04:35,361
Rym: People started making games that only required this deck.

69
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:36,264
Scott: I gotta say also.

70
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:38,270
Scott: I'm a fan of looking at really old decks of cards.

71
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,117
Scott: They're always cool.

72
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,570
Rym: I am also a fan of that.

73
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,590
Scott: I have a couple of really old decks of cards from foreign countries also awesome.

74
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:45,429
Rym: I have a really cool.

75
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:54,185
Rym: It's a set of cards from a old defunct brand of cigarettes that my grandpa had Awesome, and it's actually a leather case and there's two decks of cards in it.

76
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:54,767
Rym: It's really cool.

77
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:56,965
Scott: like Nintendo They used to make those playing cards.

78
00:04:57,126 --> 00:05:04,190
Rym: Yeah The real issue is that there's a certain level of complexity you can reach with such a simple deck.

79
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:11,350
Scott: You've got 52 cards with only four colors and 13 suits and maybe some Joker's and maybe some other like rule.

80
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,390
Scott: You know extra cards they throw in there that say like you know bicycle on them or whatever.

81
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:26,570
Rym: There becomes a point at which while you could make a better game the game becomes so Abstracted and so arbitrary and so limited by what the cards you're using you can't make a game.

82
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:36,537
Scott: I mean there are some games you could make with say 100 cards that you couldn't make 52 and you sure you can get two decks and stick them together But they're not 50 And not even that.

83
00:05:36,557 --> 00:05:43,030
Rym: just the fact that you're so limited in what you can do with just a deck of cards that I Think hearts is the perfect balance.

84
00:05:43,110 --> 00:06:00,023
Rym: and I think I would say that hearts is probably the perfect card game just in the terms of the fact that I Think it's as complex and as strategic and as interesting as a card game can be without hitting that Arbitrary or solved or ham-fisted or overly complicated with the material.

85
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:02,870
Scott: look at something like can ask to say can Asta is.

86
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:08,550
Scott: I don't know all the rules of can Asta, but it's played with two decks of cards like combined into each other.

87
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:20,002
Scott: It would probably be a better game if you just made a custom deck You know for it or like a pinochle would probably a better game if you just made a custom deck instead of using you Know a deck of cards with different amounts of things in it.

88
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:20,424
Rym: god.

89
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:21,830
Rym: I used to play pinochle in high school.

90
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:22,709
Rym: I'm done with that.

91
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,476
Scott: but hearts is where it's at.

92
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:26,241
Scott: hearts uses all 52 cards.

93
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,184
Scott: without Joker's.

94
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:31,870
Scott: all the cards are meaningful and There's a lot of stress if there's some luck going on.

95
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,390
Scott: You know if you have four hearts masters playing against each other.

96
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:38,590
Scott: It's gonna come down to what cards they get dealt mostly.

97
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,332
Scott: Yeah Well the deal

98
00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:59,710
Rym: with hearts is the deal with most card games and in fact most games that in the end eventually People are all equally skilled at the game or closely to equal scale and the only way to find out who's truly better is To keep playing and keep playing and keep playing press a and eventually Whoever is better will win a statistically significant percentage of the time.

99
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:09,470
Scott: Yep, but you can tell that it's still a meaningful game because even if you're really good at the game Someone who is really really good at the game will beat you every time or just about every time.

100
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,542
Rym: Yeah, I mean I played hearts a lot as a kid.

101
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,470
Rym: I played it in high school almost every day.

102
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:15,970
Rym: I played in middle school almost every day.

103
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,418
Rym: I played it with my family all the time.

104
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,026
Rym: hearts and Euchre were the big games.

105
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:23,549
Rym: we played Euchre because that's a really big game out in the Midwest not so much down here in New York.

106
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:30,430
Rym: No, I only seen it played a few times But when I grew up it was just hearts and Euchre and we take to every play hearts one day Euchre the next day.

107
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,317
Scott: Yeah, we were more big on the rummies in the gins But there was some hearts going on mostly.

108
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:42,124
Scott: the thing was is like every see hearts really got big once people started playing Microsoft hearts and then we played real heavy played hearts with actual cards.

109
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:55,737
Rym: Yep, but my dad I mean I played so much and no matter how good I got My dad always won like I'd win a game here and there but on average he would Most of the time win Game of skill.

110
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:58,628
Scott: if it was a game of total luck, then it would just be random.

111
00:07:58,648 --> 00:08:00,154
Scott: all the time You know, sometimes you win.

112
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:00,916
Scott: Sometimes I win.

113
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:01,337
Scott: who knows?

114
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:04,488
Rym: that's actually how we determine when a German board game is broken.

115
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:14,527
Rym: for our group of friends is when over a long period of many many plays The winners even out and every and no one has tried an innovative strategy in that time.

116
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:17,996
Scott: Yep So the way hearts works.

117
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:21,630
Scott: if you have never played it or if like you opened up Microsoft hearts and not had a clue what?

118
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,742
Scott: To do and didn't read the help.

119
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,106
Scott: It's pretty simple You deal out all the cards to four people so everyone has 13 cards.

120
00:08:27,193 --> 00:08:29,810
Scott: Then you sort of pass cards around the ones you don't want whatever.

121
00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:32,003
Scott: I'm not gonna bother getting too specific here.

122
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:40,049
Scott: and every turn Someone some beginning with the person who has the two of clubs you throws one card out Right and you go you had to throw it to the left.

123
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:47,470
Scott: So if I throw a card than the person my left does and then the person to their left and then the fourth person Well from here, it's basically it's a trick-taking game, which is a whole class.

124
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,962
Rym: I mean, there's all different other kinds of card games.

125
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:51,410
Rym: There's reflex games and whatever.

126
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:53,296
Rym: This is a trick-taking game.

127
00:08:53,497 --> 00:08:56,748
Scott: So the idea is that I'm gonna explain what a trick-taking game is.

128
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:57,430
Scott: I think tricks.

129
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:58,776
Rym: Well, what's the trick?

130
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:02,050
Scott: that's not the kind not the kind where you know, you turn you take you don't turn.

131
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:10,610
Rym: Yeah basically a trick-taking game is this class of games where generally Cards are laid out by players in some sort of clockwise order and you have to follow suit.

132
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,150
Rym: So if the first person plays a club then everyone else if they have a club has to play it now.

133
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,989
Rym: They can play whichever club they want, but they have to play a club now.

134
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:28,005
Rym: Different games have different rules for if you don't have a card of that suit But you play and then all of the cards laid out when everything's gone around.

135
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:32,108
Rym: whoever played the highest card Takes all of those cards and does something with them.

136
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:32,474
Rym: Mm-hmm.

137
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:38,170
Scott: And the idea is either you want to or don't want to take the cards depending and in hearts.

138
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:44,942
Scott: You generally don't want to take the cards But sometimes you might because it won't matter because depends what cards you take.

139
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:47,650
Scott: generally you don't want to take hearts.

140
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:54,195
Rym: yep, the gist of hearts is pretty simple everyone score starts out at zero and Getting points is bad.

141
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:57,005
Rym: And anytime you take a trick that has a heart in it.

142
00:09:57,426 --> 00:09:58,470
Rym: You get a point, right?

143
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,888
Scott: So let's say I put down the two of clubs.

144
00:10:00,294 --> 00:10:01,430
Scott: All right guy to the left of me.

145
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,290
Scott: He has the only wheels in one club in his hand the five of clubs.

146
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,093
Scott: He puts that down.

147
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:07,483
Scott: the next guy is a whole mess of clubs, right?

148
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:09,030
Scott: He puts down the party.

149
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,355
Rym: He puts down the highest club.

150
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,142
Scott: He's gonna put down the king of clubs, right?

151
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:14,330
Scott: The fourth person doesn't have any clubs.

152
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,194
Scott: It's like a miracle.

153
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,083
Scott: Mostly me and the guy across from me have him.

154
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:18,430
Scott: It's crazy situation, right?

155
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,020
Scott: So he throws down the ace of hearts.

156
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:24,692
Scott: So then the guy who put well, you can't do that That's right.

157
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,023
Rym: No, yeah, you can't know you can't play a point card on the first trick.

158
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:33,220
Scott: All right the first one, but anyway I thought you were going with the open rule, but doesn't matter.

159
00:10:33,662 --> 00:10:36,072
Scott: So he puts down the ace of hearts just for the example Right.

160
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:39,783
Scott: So now the guy put down the king of clubs is the highest of the suit.

161
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:42,393
Scott: that began the whole thing because clubs started The whole thing.

162
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,830
Scott: So this trick is a club trick and he put down the highest club.

163
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:49,303
Scott: So he has to take all four cards and one of them is a heart.

164
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:50,468
Scott: So he gets one point.

165
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,592
Rym: now Think about that.

166
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:55,890
Rym: Theoretically you could play like a five up to a diamonds the lowest diamond.

167
00:10:56,512 --> 00:11:02,690
Rym: But if no one else somehow had any diamonds and they all play hearts you play the highest diamond you take all those cards.

168
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:08,114
Scott: Yeah, so there's a lot of strategy and you start out with 13 cards and once you play one It's gone.

169
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:16,919
Scott: whether it ends up you might end up in your in front of you It might end up in front of someone else and you gotta you know sort of You know decide when you want to take a trick.

170
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,269
Scott: when you don't want to take a trick whose turn is it gonna be?

171
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:24,369
Scott: if so And so because someone so takes a trick then they're the one who has to play the next card to start off the next.

172
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:26,158
Rym: go Yeah, which can be good or bad.

173
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:27,585
Rym: Sometimes you want to be that person.

174
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:28,450
Rym: Sometimes you don't yeah.

175
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,369
Scott: So if your hand is full of certain cards You might want to take one trick that say doesn't have any hearts in it.

176
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:46,788
Scott: Right and then that means you get to start it off and if you set it up just right you can start it off And start it off and start it off and clear out a bunch of cars that aren't worth anything And then as soon as the iron is hot throw out cars that get sent to other people and go

177
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:47,189
Rym: ha ha ha.

178
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:47,954
Rym: Yep.

179
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:49,284
Rym: Now the way the game works.

180
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:54,150
Rym: There's another factor I'm gonna bring up in a second and that's kind of the really fun is the most fun part again.

181
00:11:54,391 --> 00:12:06,989
Rym: but the way the game ends up being set up is that each suit kind of has a different property like each suit ends up being Different because that every no matter what every game starts with whoever has the two of clubs has to play it.

182
00:12:07,432 --> 00:12:09,729
Rym: So clubs always get played first.

183
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:15,150
Rym: and There's kind of like this thing of you want to get rid of the clubs early and all sort of whatever.

184
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,469
Rym: I mean, I'm not gonna get into the deep strategies of this game.

185
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,946
Rym: Yeah diamonds in real like traditional hearts are the neutral suit because there's not.

186
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:24,190
Rym: they have nothing special about them.

187
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,214
Rym: They're just cards.

188
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:25,998
Rym: They're diamonds.

189
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:26,339
Rym: That's it.

190
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,263
Rym: You don't have to start with them.

191
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:28,227
Rym: You never forced to play them.

192
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:28,809
Rym: They're just there.

193
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:35,170
Rym: Yeah, though a lot of people play a variant where the jack of diamonds is special and gives you a negative 10 points or something.

194
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:35,935
Scott: I never heard of that.

195
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:37,164
Rym: a lot of people play hearts.

196
00:12:37,184 --> 00:12:37,848
Scott: that was BS.

197
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:42,407
Scott: The way the play hearts is the way Microsoft hearts plays hearts every other way is bullshit.

198
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:45,541
Rym: That's not gonna say Well, the thing is a three player.

199
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:47,510
Rym: hearts is just as good as for play.

200
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,082
Scott: Well, yeah, you know I'm talking about the rules of the game.

201
00:12:50,122 --> 00:12:53,711
Scott: Not the number of players, but Spades.

202
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:55,740
Rym: I haven't brought up spades here cuz you know hearts.

203
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:58,131
Rym: Oh hearts are just worth a point and all what you don't want to Take.

204
00:12:58,151 --> 00:12:58,432
Scott: hearts.

205
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:10,050
Scott: spades are normal except the queen of spades is worth 13 points, so if you'd end up taking the queen of spades in a trick, that's as bad as taking every heart.

206
00:13:10,993 --> 00:13:11,856
Scott: It really sucks.

207
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:14,043
Scott: So generally what happens is the Queen.

208
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,930
Scott: someone one person has the queen of spades.

209
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,963
Rym: Someone's always got it unless you play in the three or five player game.

210
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:20,590
Scott: Yes, so that person right?

211
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:27,210
Scott: They have to sort of fight - they have to play the card eventually because you keep going until everyone runs out of cards.

212
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:31,069
Scott: They have to play that card in such a way that someone else takes it.

213
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:39,710
Scott: But let's say for example Right the queen of spades is the only spade they have and someone else plays the five of spades as the opening card.

214
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:40,996
Scott: They have no choice.

215
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:44,210
Scott: They have to play the queen of spades and take it they or else they're cheating.

216
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:45,650
Scott: There's no other decision for them.

217
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:50,010
Scott: So they have to sort of keep track of what cards are out and set up a situation.

218
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,217
Scott: Maybe you know take another trick.

219
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:59,767
Scott: that's only worth two points on purpose so that they can get control of the game So that they can get rid of the Queen, you know take two to not take 13 later.

220
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:00,751
Rym: Yep.

221
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:02,296
Rym: Now this game as we've that's it.

222
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:04,945
Rym: That's the whole game and it seems very simple.

223
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:05,827
Rym: Very simple cards.

224
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:06,630
Rym: Very simple rules.

225
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:13,476
Rym: there's not much to it, but I will say that the depth of strategy is Somewhat staggering and it'll take.

226
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:14,841
Rym: I haven't solved the game.

227
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,186
Rym: I'm not I'm not an option.

228
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:17,934
Rym: I mean, I'm a very good hearts player I'm pretty good.

229
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:20,010
Rym: I really I mean Scott and I are both really good.

230
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,219
Rym: we played it a lot at RIT.

231
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:28,109
Rym: actually we were freshmen, but Well, I'm nowhere near optimal and I don't know if I'll ever get optimal because it's a difficult game to mostly.

232
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:33,788
Scott: There's one thing that I'm so far from being optimal at and that is the one rule is shooting the moon.

233
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:36,721
Scott: now The rule shooting the moon works like this.

234
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:38,850
Scott: Let's say you really suck ass.

235
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:41,079
Scott: Let's say you get the worst cards possible, right?

236
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:43,570
Scott: You have like you couldn't get worse cards.

237
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:53,885
Scott: Well, if you manage to somehow take every single heart and the queen of spades You took all 26 points in the whole game, right?

238
00:14:54,146 --> 00:14:54,869
Scott: You got them all.

239
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:57,617
Scott: You instead lose 26 points.

240
00:14:57,677 --> 00:15:01,948
Rym: well good the original rule as far as I've seen is everyone else gets 26 points.

241
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:03,602
Scott: Oh, it's either way.

242
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:04,270
Scott: It doesn't really matter.

243
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:12,212
Rym: It does matter because then as a variant was you can choose there I lose 26 or everyone else gets 26.

244
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:16,949
Rym: The reason being I don't think we really said the victory condition because you play you don't just play like one go.

245
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:25,789
Rym: Whenever is the most points wins you just keep playing and playing and playing Until someone anyone in the game reaches an arbitrary score like a hundred or five hundred.

246
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:32,150
Rym: and The moment someone crosses over that high score the game is immediately over and whoever has the least points wins.

247
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:43,739
Rym: so sometimes shooting the moon if you're playing with the strict old everyone gets 26 points could make you lose the game even though you played awesomely or Conversely, let's say we're playing the not conversely.

248
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:48,858
Rym: We're playing a game me and Scott and two other people and Scott's really sucking for some reason.

249
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:49,461
Rym: He's got 99 points.

250
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:49,924
Rym: 100 is the win.

251
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,859
Rym: Now say our friend Alex has eight points.

252
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:57,606
Rym: He's doing great and me and the other guy are.

253
00:15:57,727 --> 00:15:58,730
Rym: you know, we're in the middle somewhere.

254
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:04,670
Rym: No one wants Scott to take a trick because that ends the game and then Alex wins.

255
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,919
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of the a lot of the strategy.

256
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,767
Scott: the game comes in the long term.

257
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:09,430
Scott: play, right?

258
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:14,351
Scott: Like for example, let's go back to the guy who had the Queen of Spades in his hand and no other spades in his hand Right.

259
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:16,179
Scott: He's trying to get rid of that thing.

260
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:18,850
Scott: He doesn't want to take 13 points and he doesn't have the stuff.

261
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,050
Scott: He can't shoot the moon, right?

262
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:21,119
Scott: So he's got it.

263
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:21,989
Scott: put it on someone else.

264
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:24,670
Scott: But let's say there are three other players in the game.

265
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:27,503
Scott: One of them has like 99 points one of them is 75 points and one of them is two points.

266
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:33,639
Scott: Not only does he want to get rid of it But he wants to give it to the guy who has two points.

267
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,289
Rym: and the game is complex enough to where you can set up Strategies to do that.

268
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:38,997
Rym: I mean like think of this.

269
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:42,633
Rym: you get to you pass cards around a little bit and the rules are pretty much Every round.

270
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:48,597
Rym: you either pass three cards to the person on your left in front of you to the right or maybe you don't pass Any and you have to pass three if it.

271
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:51,948
Rym: lets you so say you've got the Queen in your hand.

272
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,574
Rym: now You have to think to yourself.

273
00:16:53,835 --> 00:16:55,542
Rym: All right, I have the Queen.

274
00:16:55,743 --> 00:16:59,189
Rym: you might think oh obviously get rid of it You don't get stuck with it, but not so fast.

275
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:02,804
Rym: If you have the Queen you have control over the Queen.

276
00:17:02,824 --> 00:17:06,950
Rym: well on a measure of control You have control as long as you were careful.

277
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,790
Rym: For example, let's say I have two diamonds and the Queen and a bunch of other cards, right?

278
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,805
Rym: So if I pass those two diamonds and some other card and I keep the Queen Huh?

279
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:27,743
Scott: Now I don't have any diamonds and you just wait because someone is really proud most likely 99% chance Someone's gonna put a diamond down and then you go Queen haha.

280
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:39,077
Rym: So the game tends to progress per hand as everyone's real cautious and people tend to try to Like a king and a seven.

281
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:48,370
Rym: I'm gonna play that seven because I'm worried the Queen might pop out but eventually the bitch comes and then Then the game just gets a lot faster and people aren't as worried.

282
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:55,422
Scott: The only one major flaw I find in hearts, but it's not specific to hearts It's a flaw in pretty much every trick-taking game with you know, Trump suits and what that.

283
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,690
Scott: what not is that app?

284
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:05,929
Scott: You're you're playing a game where basically it consists of playing 13 cards one at a time After you play about seven or eight depending on which cards they are.

285
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:11,110
Scott: It is usually the case that the rest of the round is just you know, a foregone conclusion.

286
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:14,530
Scott: Yeah, but it's like you get to a point and you're just like oh the rest of the tricks go to Rym.

287
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,150
Scott: You just give him all the cards and you don't bother but there's no more decision at the same time.

288
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:25,861
Rym: I like that because once there are no more decisions to be made among advanced players You just stop know how many points everyone got and play another hand.

289
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:36,010
Rym: because like Scott said the strategy the game Isn't directly in the play this hand as best as I can It's play the game over the long term as best I can.

290
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:47,350
Scott: I mean, yeah, I'll take tricks to prevent someone else from shooting the moon or I'll or sometimes I'll try to trick someone else into taking tricks, you know, like someone my guy my right is shooting the moon.

291
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:51,850
Scott: So I make a play such that the guy on my left is forced to take the trick with a heart in it.

292
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,597
Rym: I go ha ha ha.

293
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:56,577
Rym: or I know that the guy on there I'm pretty sure based on the cards the guy on the right gave me.

294
00:18:56,597 --> 00:18:58,622
Rym: because say he gave me a two and a four of.

295
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:07,470
Rym: So I'm pretty sure unless he's bluffing me that he just gave up all his time.

296
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,861
Scott: That's not a good bluff because you don't want to do that.

297
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:11,824
Rym: No better off.

298
00:19:11,844 --> 00:19:13,629
Rym: See this is another one of those games too where?

299
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,195
Rym: bluffing against novice players Only hurts you.

300
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:26,900
Rym: Yeah, but like if you're playing with four people who are all like super awesome at hearts Like seeing all right Scott just getting is just.

301
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,310
Scott: you know, you got a bluff with like a specific plan in mind.

302
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:34,350
Scott: Be like, uh-huh bluff him and that will throw him off.

303
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:42,363
Scott: No, you have to specifically be like, okay if I get rid of these two diamonds He'll think this and he'll play like this Which means I can do this with the hours that I have in my hand.

304
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:47,550
Scott: and if you don't have this specific plan Getting rid of like the two and the four diamonds if they're your only diamond is just crazy.

305
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:50,062
Scott: Well, if they're not your only diamonds, it's just stupid.

306
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:51,610
Rym: Yeah, but like here's a good strategy.

307
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:55,987
Rym: Let's say I've got a nice semi long run, but non-contiguous of die.

308
00:19:56,007 --> 00:20:04,517
Rym: I got a bunch of diamonds Six or seven of them and I only have one club and One let's say heart.

309
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:08,490
Rym: Yep, cuz even you still it's nice to not have any hearts unless you only have low hearts.

310
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,962
Rym: But alright, so what I want to pass?

311
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,569
Rym: you might think alright pass the club.

312
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:16,760
Rym: No, you don't want to do that because if you pass the club It's easy to get rid of that club.

313
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,910
Scott: you get rid of it on the first turn.

314
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,512
Scott: Well, not only that.

315
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:19,577
Rym: Alright, I give up the club.

316
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:21,465
Rym: now the first turn happens.

317
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:23,477
Rym: I don't have any clubs I gotta play.

318
00:20:23,517 --> 00:20:24,910
Rym: can't play a heart cuz it's the first turn.

319
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,826
Rym: You can't play a point card on the first turn because that kind of breaks the game.

320
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:29,494
Rym: Mm-hmm So great.

321
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:32,407
Rym: I have to reveal that I don't have any clubs immediately.

322
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:35,867
Rym: Yep Oh now everyone knows I don't have any clubs now.

323
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:41,630
Rym: either I have the Queen or I don't and one other player possibly to know if I have the Queen or not.

324
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:48,592
Rym: it's a game of knowledge and bluffing and skill and tactics and go and go and go and yeah plus remember you're at the Beginning of the round.

325
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:51,060
Scott: you usually pass some cards to someone.

326
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,644
Scott: so you know that.

327
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:53,888
Scott: let's say I get you think about.

328
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:55,334
Scott: you got to Think about it in two ways.

329
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,118
Scott: You got to think about it in.

330
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:58,369
Scott: Okay, I've got three spades here.

331
00:20:58,792 --> 00:20:59,938
Scott: I'll get rid of the three spades.

332
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:01,064
Scott: I'll pass them the guy on my right.

333
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:01,768
Rym: So that's super dangerous.

334
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,069
Scott: No, no, but I'll let the high spades right but you pass three spades to the guy on your right, right?

335
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,109
Scott: Not only do you now you just did a good move getting rid of all your spades say, right?

336
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:17,084
Scott: But at the same time you got to remember that guy has those three cards.

337
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:18,870
Scott: that way as you go around.

338
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,770
Scott: You know you think huh?

339
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,590
Scott: Well, well, this is a good card to play and you think that guy has those three cards.

340
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:26,499
Scott: Yeah, and you go and he plays one of them.

341
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,550
Scott: You got to remember say he has those two cards.

342
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,100
Rym: Yep, and you also have to remember and look.

343
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,650
Rym: All right, someone else gave me three cards.

344
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:35,901
Rym: What does that tell me about what he has?

345
00:21:36,323 --> 00:21:37,650
Rym: and then you also have to think?

346
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,302
Rym: What does my opponent to my left know based on the three cards?

347
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:42,366
Rym: I gave him.

348
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:46,984
Rym: Yep And the game is just fantastic and I really like playing it.

349
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:52,810
Scott: It's a pretty good game I gotta say and if you aren't playing hearts, you should probably a good place to play hearts.

350
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:56,603
Scott: actually, it depends on you know, if you play on Yahoo Games you could.

351
00:21:56,623 --> 00:22:00,098
Scott: there's a little Java thing that lets you play hearts against People and for free.

352
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,370
Scott: the problem is some of the people in the community.

353
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:07,669
Scott: You're kind of a but you can find some nice social games on there where the people aren't so and where there's.

354
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:15,628
Scott: you know They don't really care about the score and the bullshit and it's a. it's a good place to play hearts against Novices and people who are amazing and will kick your ass all the time.

355
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,150
Rym: Yep Now we've left a lot out in terms of stress.

356
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:19,419
Scott: Oh, you can talk about hearts like I.

357
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:27,795
Rym: just I just want to say die if anyone out there tries to say well you guys overlook the blah blah strategy or You guys were really like.

358
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:30,703
Rym: that was a really simplified and dangerous strategy.

359
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:45,236
Rym: It's a special member lazy busy nosy Yeah, but I mean we know the strategies of hearts pretty well, and if you want if you wanted us to we could probably Talk about almost all of them Maybe almost all of them.

360
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:46,662
Scott: I got a. I got a study some more.

361
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:48,250
Scott: I haven't played hearts in a good long while.

362
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:48,695
Scott: Maybe.

363
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:54,130
Scott: oh, it's a good idea though It's like I keep being bored at work playing flash games and the boss Microsoft our week.

364
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:58,726
Scott: I think no not Microsoft are saying you'll play hearts on Yahoo because I got Linux at work.

365
00:22:59,408 --> 00:23:01,175
Scott: Ah Maybe Microsoft hearts also.

366
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:02,883
Rym: who knows Microsoft hearts ain't so bad.

367
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:03,505
Scott: It's not.

368
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:04,088
Scott: it's pretty good.

369
00:23:04,128 --> 00:23:05,749
Scott: Plus they you know The one in Vista is pretty shiny.
