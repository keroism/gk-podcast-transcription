1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,286
Scott: It's Tuesday, March 27th.

2
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:12,671
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:14,958
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:17,859
Scott: tonight We talk about the amazing board game.

5
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:19,397
Scott: Amun Ray.

6
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:22,957
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:30,850
Rym: So of course over the weekend as we are often want to do the front row crew play Dungeons and Dragons.

8
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:36,330
Scott: Yep, we started a monthly game and I'm surprised that we're still keeping it up now.

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:49,675
Rym: Of course, the only problem with this is that as much as I love the front row crew I've basically determined Empirically mind you that our friends the front row crew as a whole are not in fact our friends the front row crew But are the Visigoths.

10
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:56,033
Scott: I don't know they might be some other type of goth or perhaps just plain old Huns.

11
00:00:56,414 --> 00:01:01,190
Rym: now they're not Huns because the Huns just ravaged and the Ostrogoths had this whole other thing.

12
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:06,330
Rym: But the Visigoths would overrun Roman territory, right and they liked what the Romans had.

13
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,790
Rym: They wanted to use the Roman roads and the Roman aqueducts and the Roman government.

14
00:01:10,212 --> 00:01:12,843
Scott: So I want to use Roman roads and aqueducts and government.

15
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:25,590
Rym: so they come in and they'd say alright We've conquered you ha ha and after a little bit of pillaging they'd settle down in the area Intermarry a little bit leave the social structure intact and while they would use the Roman roads and all that Roman infrastructure.

16
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:29,542
Rym: they wouldn't maintain it or take care of it and eventually it all collapsed.

17
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:38,270
Rym: so the front row crew comes in and To do a brief summary by the end of the weekend someone broke a glass and decided to not tell anyone.

18
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:43,110
Rym: I found it now fully intact yet shattered hidden behind a bunch of other glasses.

19
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:47,859
Rym: Someone ripped the handle out of the bathroom door.

20
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:51,409
Rym: it was kind of loose, but they ripped it like doubly out and bent it.

21
00:01:53,711 --> 00:02:01,630
Rym: And during the weekend an unnamed individual just about set fire to a hot dog by trying to cook it on high on a Teflon pan on an electric oven.

22
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,015
Rym: ah No one did their dishes.

23
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:08,580
Rym: there's a giant mess in the kitchen.

24
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:10,226
Rym: I found bits of food hidden everywhere.

25
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:15,109
Scott: It was generally awesome At least- do people do this in their own homes?

26
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:23,383
Scott: I wonder because I mean I go to other people's houses You know and I might use a cup and then put it in the sink and not wash it.

27
00:02:23,985 --> 00:02:30,430
Scott: I might I don't know Leave my stuff strewn about near my bag and then put it all back in my bag before I leave.

28
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:34,069
Scott: I might you know leave something somewhere and then put it back.

29
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:37,962
Scott: You know, but I don't break a glass and not tell anyone.

30
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:43,250
Scott: I don't break the handle on a door I don't set fire to hot dogs.

31
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,258
Rym: Well, I just remember.

32
00:02:45,298 --> 00:03:04,848
Rym: because way back after the New Year's party we commented to a few people just kind of like not even like girl you people but Someone broke this and someone broke that and we kind of tallied off all the things that have been broken in our House over the course of the several days and it was funny how almost all of our friends immediately Would get all defensive like well, it wasn't me.

33
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:08,162
Rym: Well, it wasn't me and each one of them individually said it wasn't them.

34
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:10,270
Rym: and yet somehow collectively the damage was done.

35
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:16,909
Scott: Yeah, it's like we made it very clear that we were making a general comment and not singling anyone out.

36
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,995
Scott: yet Everyone was super defensive like I didn't do anything.

37
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:20,717
Scott: It wasn't me.

38
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:25,346
Scott: I'm cool and it's like hey, maybe you're all uncool.

39
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:32,296
Rym: I Wonder either either one or more of our friends I mean we're even back in colony.

40
00:03:32,316 --> 00:03:40,017
Rym: when an unnamed individual broke all the eggs in the fridge I think and then put them back in the fridge That was particularly awesome.

41
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,289
Rym: Yes, at least no one peed on the floor this time.

42
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:48,766
Rym: Yes, so we're about halfway through cleaning up after D&D.

43
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,670
Rym: Maybe we should have it at the other geek house for once some one weekend.

44
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:55,138
Scott: Maybe we should.

45
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:57,008
Scott: of course they don't have room to play D&D.

46
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,098
Scott: Maybe we should rent a place out like a room somewhere.

47
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:03,830
Rym: Ah or a library or you just buy that house around the corner.

48
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,427
Rym: That's like twice as big as our house.

49
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:13,515
Rym: Of course None of that matters because as Scott is showing right now and I'm also showing we could wear shorts today because it was like 70 Degrees hot day.

50
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:17,209
Scott: I didn't actually wear shorts to work today because it wasn't that warm in the morning.

51
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:20,125
Scott: But when I got basically I was sweating all day.

52
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:21,170
Scott: I was sweating in the office.

53
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:24,238
Scott: I was sweating walking from the office to the subway.

54
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:26,906
Scott: I was sweating on the train home.

55
00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:33,510
Scott: I was sweating walking Basically from the train to the house except for when I was driving in the car with the windows open.

56
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:36,329
Scott: So when I got home, I immediately put the shorts on.

57
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:42,350
Scott: The only time that pants were correct choice of clothing was on the way to the train in the morning.

58
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:45,490
Rym: See, I really can't wear pants or shorts to work.

59
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:55,675
Rym: I have to wear not even business casual business professional But I always bring shorts and a t-shirt whatever and sandals or something and I usually change in the drive home in that I Can wear a Metroid shirt to work?

60
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:57,039
Rym: Yeah, I can.

61
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,070
Rym: I got to wear collared shirts occasionally ties and sport jackets.

62
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:07,703
Scott: Speaking of work this new work that I have, you know, it's got okay people They're not the awesomest nerds in the world and we're geeking out all the time.

63
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:08,587
Scott: But you know, they're cool.

64
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:14,672
Scott: They're not bad And they actually give me work to do and they care if I do it and they talk to me about the work and that That's.

65
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,149
Scott: that's pretty cool because I've never actually had that before Surprisingly enough.

66
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:20,701
Scott: However, there is still one problem.

67
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:22,189
Scott: They gave me the work.

68
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,066
Scott: They said I said, all right, is there a due date for this?

69
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:29,920
Scott: and they said oh And eventually they're like, all right April 1st, when's April 1st?

70
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,983
Scott: Rym Sunday?

71
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:35,816
Scott: Uh, I believe so I finished the work today.

72
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:38,568
Scott: So I got three days of.

73
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:49,590
Rym: yeah Yeah I have the opposite problem where I could finish the work immediately except that I either have to wait for someone else to do something Or it involves paperwork that no one will explain to me or tell me what to what it is.

74
00:05:49,690 --> 00:06:02,589
Scott: Yeah, at least so far all the works I've been doing have been sort of individual works but other people know about them so I can ask and get answers and they answer me because they're right there and They're not stupid and then I get the work done.

75
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:05,460
Rym: I should just be a freaking independent IT consultant.

76
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,010
Rym: I'd make a lot more money and I wouldn't have to rely on anyone.

77
00:06:08,832 --> 00:06:09,956
Scott: Do whatever you want, man.

78
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:12,745
Scott: I'll be good where I am now for at least a year.

79
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:13,307
Scott: Maybe more?

80
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:14,330
Rym: maybe I don't know.

81
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:15,715
Rym: I think the 10-week mark.

82
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:20,875
Rym: every 10 weeks that goes by every one of us gets a little bit more Unsettled by our jobs.

83
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:21,537
Scott: That is true.

84
00:06:21,577 --> 00:06:24,427
Scott: However, I was re-energized by the good weather.

85
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:26,433
Rym: Uh I feel great.

86
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,801
Rym: I'm wide awake like first time since I'm actually.

87
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:39,090
Scott: I'm actually thinking if I had managed to not quit the job I just had and Got through it until the spring then I probably would have not quit again until the winner when I felt shitty again.

88
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,723
Rym: It's like every winner I get all ahead and it's almost like I forget that there's a summer and then it's gonna come back.

89
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:46,615
Rym: Yeah, it's like during summer.

90
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:48,943
Rym: It's like wow these days could never end.

91
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:55,730
Rym: Let's pick up and move to the tropics, man You know, I would if it weren't for the fact that there aren't so many jobs for something like me at the tropics.

92
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:57,070
Scott: It's kind of weird.

93
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:03,170
Scott: It's like why did humans decide to build the great cities in places where the weather wasn't so great?

94
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:08,188
Scott: Built the New York City where Miami is the Miami where New York City is.

95
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,450
Rym: but no Remember it goes a lot further back in human history.

96
00:07:11,913 --> 00:07:21,330
Rym: I mean historically the cultures that ended up Militarily dominating the rest of the world go over and over again tend to come from the colder climates where maybe life was tired.

97
00:07:21,636 --> 00:07:22,289
Scott: That is correct.

98
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:30,070
Scott: However, if they were any smart people that were came from the colder climates They would have gone to the warmer climate and conquered it and live there instead.

99
00:07:30,258 --> 00:07:35,826
Rym: All right A lot of people did and those places ended up shitty for a lot of reasons because someone sucked along.

100
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:37,633
Rym: now part of it was Malaria.

101
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:41,130
Rym: a lot of those places had diseases that we didn't really have the technology to deal.

102
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,160
Scott: Well, we don't have the deal those diseases now.

103
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,642
Rym: Yes, we do.

104
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:45,330
Scott: We don't have to worry about them.

105
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,414
Rym: Yes, we do honey.

106
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:51,697
Scott: Only poor people have to worry about malaria, but there's a lot of poor people around there Are also.

107
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:52,930
Rym: malaria is not the only issue.

108
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,489
Rym: I mean Florida is great and all but there are a lot of fleas down there compared to up here.

109
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:58,513
Scott: That's true.

110
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:04,249
Scott: for one day conquer like a Caribbean island and build an awesome city on it.

111
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,928
Rym: Plus there are each there are in that city.

112
00:08:07,597 --> 00:08:08,550
Scott: Not right next to Scott.

113
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:14,210
Rym: I put forth another idea that areas in the tropics tend to get hit by more severe weather than say New York City.

114
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:15,934
Scott: Well hurricane sometimes.

115
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:16,616
Rym: Yeah.

116
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,160
Rym: Yeah cities wouldn't do so.

117
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,990
Scott: Well there you just build a hurricane proof city a hurricane proof city.

118
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:31,806
Rym: Yep, right anyway in the news and this is about as Vague and possibly untrue of news as I would ever put forth as news.

119
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:43,904
Rym: and I bring it up more because I want to talk About if these things happen and why they should happen as opposed to oh my god they are happening, but the news is broken that both guitar hero and Katamari are supposedly coming out on the.

120
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,655
Scott: we also Knights into dreams.

121
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:47,337
Scott: Yes.

122
00:08:47,397 --> 00:08:50,345
Scott: That one is like the chances of these things being true.

123
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:51,970
Scott: It's like Knights into dreams.

124
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:57,190
Scott: It's already at 90% because there's like a cover of a UK magazine that's got Knights on the cover.

125
00:08:57,694 --> 00:08:59,208
Scott: So that's probably true.

126
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:03,041
Scott: Guitar hero like 50 to 60 percent true.

127
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:06,434
Scott: Katamari maybe like 40 to 50 percent true I don't know.

128
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:09,010
Rym: I think Katamari has a big chance of coming over to the Wii.

129
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,216
Scott: Yes But I'm just talking about the right now.

130
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:15,070
Scott: how much faith you can put in believing it without looking like an idiot.

131
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:20,528
Rym: Well based on the evidence in terms of I see every reason why these companies should they all?

132
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:24,364
Rym: they should 100% and not even just for a oh to be nicer.

133
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:25,770
Rym: Oh for the fans, whatever.

134
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:38,381
Rym: but a lot of people who have PlayStation twos or You know more mainstream normal gamers or normal people out there seem to kind of assume that Everyone has a ps2 and everyone has these systems.

135
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:49,550
Rym: and as was illustrated in stark relief Over the weekend our friend Scott Johnson brought guitar heroes guitar heroes 2 and 2 guitars To our house and he pulls him out.

136
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,545
Rym: He's like look what I brought and we're like great hook up the ps2 and we'll go.

137
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:57,830
Rym: and he says I Didn't bring a ps2 and none of us had a ps2.

138
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:03,390
Scott: Yep, we might get one soon though because the slim ps2 is a lot slimmer than I thought it was.

139
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,450
Scott: Yeah, and I like we so far we've got a Mac Mini and a Wii under the TV.

140
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:11,030
Scott: So a slim ps2 is small enough that it can go next to those things.

141
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,327
Rym: Well, honestly, that's one reason why I don't want a ps3 because it's gigantic.

142
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:16,241
Scott: Yep It was only small.

143
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:17,289
Scott: things are going under the TV.

144
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,174
Scott: I found this amp.

145
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:21,410
Scott: it's gonna go and I finally, you know get back in financial straits.

146
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:26,164
Scott: It's actually bigger than any of the devices we have down there, but it's still really small.

147
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:28,130
Scott: But yeah, we're talking about the Wii.

148
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:37,350
Scott: I mean, it was just a story today that says that Nintendo might be holding back on the Wii's a little bit, you know, Ellie's GameStop seems to think so.

149
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,854
Scott: So who knows right?

150
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:45,275
Scott: but because they've met their projected, you know sales for Wiis In fact, they met it.

151
00:10:45,356 --> 00:10:46,482
Rym: I'm very they met it early.

152
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:47,770
Rym: They already hit six million.

153
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:50,289
Rym: So anything they make beyond that is beyond expectations.

154
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:55,410
Scott: So anyone who wants a we now will just buy one when it comes out when the quarter changes.

155
00:10:55,912 --> 00:11:00,750
Scott: So they might as well just hold those Wiis and then put those sales into the next quarters.

156
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,738
Scott: They can make sure they meet their projections then.

157
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:07,334
Rym: well also in terms of I mean people talk about not just the weed route But the game drought for the Wii.

158
00:11:07,796 --> 00:11:14,230
Rym: it seems very simple that right now people are buying Wiis on the merit of basically Wii Sports and Twilight Princess?

159
00:11:14,612 --> 00:11:25,109
Rym: Basically, yes, in fact mostly just Wii Sports Yeah and The while Nintendo if they were awesome would immediately start pumping out games that just made full use of the Wii.

160
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:25,530
Rym: or you know.

161
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:37,394
Rym: basically if they just listen to what we and probably Dave and Joel have to say about the Wii they just do that but financially sadly, they have no reason to because the Wii is making them as Goblins worth of money.

162
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:40,967
Scott: not only that that it's making them ask goblins worth of money.

163
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:46,433
Rym: I meant to say ask God I'm not sure why I said goblin but Too much D&D Cuz.

164
00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:47,478
Rym: I killed that goblin.

165
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:54,342
Scott: Yeah, not only is it making them as goblins worth of money But they might actually not make as much money by releasing a shit ton of games.

166
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:57,110
Scott: because the Wii right now is not really a risk.

167
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,837
Scott: It's a profitable game console.

168
00:11:58,877 --> 00:12:02,070
Scott: That's almost never happened ever and it's stupidly popular.

169
00:12:02,151 --> 00:12:04,989
Scott: It's not a risk to make one more Wii and sell it.

170
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,069
Rym: It also helps the Nintendo unlike every other game company pretty much ever.

171
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:12,924
Rym: As always I had this philosophy that they will make a profit on anything.

172
00:12:13,185 --> 00:12:23,090
Scott: if they can't make a profit on something They wouldn't even consider the idea making a game However, awesome that most people might think the game is, you know, even making another Mario game.

173
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,438
Scott: You got to think Super Mario Galaxy.

174
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,300
Scott: that's coming out, right?

175
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,090
Scott: That's actually a risk compared to the Wii.

176
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:35,790
Scott: So why would they make more games when their console is still going strong and selling like crazy?

177
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:39,382
Scott: It just doesn't make sense to start taking a risk when you're raking in the dough.

178
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:41,329
Rym: plus Nintendo has always done the thing of.

179
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:50,556
Rym: they Have like X games that pretty much everyone who has a Wii or a GameCube or whatever is going to buy and they spread Them out so that you never have to decide.

180
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:51,558
Rym: Oh shit.

181
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,530
Rym: Do I buy Twilight Princess or Metroid princess?

182
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,921
Scott: Yeah, I think what's gonna happen here is two things.

183
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:02,318
Scott: number one when the DS came out It was the same story.

184
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:04,030
Scott: there weren't games for a long time.

185
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:09,250
Scott: There's a few games at the start like Advance Wars and Mario whatever and then it was just drought.

186
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:15,010
Rym: Yeah, we both played our DS is non-stop for like a month and then I didn't really touch it for another five months.

187
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,181
Scott: Yeah, and now I look over there and I've got this.

188
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:18,890
Scott: I have a fistful of DS games.

189
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,250
Rym: I have a red solo cup that's just full of DS and GBA games that I play and I have like two GBA games.

190
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,187
Scott: So yeah, but I mean the DS is already like what two or three years old almost.

191
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:28,970
Scott: it's crazy, isn't it?

192
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,870
Rym: And the thing is the DS isn't even at its peak yet.

193
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,230
Rym: As far as I can see the DS is the steamroller of gaming.

194
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:36,186
Scott: So the same thing's gonna happen with the Wii.

195
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:40,770
Scott: right now It sucks because they're the games are not living up to the potential of the console.

196
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:50,450
Scott: There could be the greatest gaming experience in the universe on the Wii But there won't be for a few years because of business and we're losing out because of money.

197
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,195
Rym: Yeah Nintendo is smart because I get.

198
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:59,024
Rym: the moment the Wii curve starts to slack in and they have reason to They'll suddenly start ramping up the games.

199
00:13:59,346 --> 00:13:59,890
Rym: Yeah cover it.

200
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,982
Rym: So they'll make constant money right up to the end of the life.

201
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:06,513
Scott: by this time next year There's gonna be plenty of awesome Wii games you'll I guarantee.

202
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:10,349
Scott: at least almost 10 awesome Wii games will be out by this time next year.

203
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:18,710
Scott: and Not only that but unlike some other Nintendo systems like the GameCube the Wii is actually selling crazily.

204
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:30,910
Scott: Therefore a lot of people will have Wiis in their house if a lot of people have Wiis in their house and not so many people have ps3s and You make you're a game developer or publisher.

205
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:40,843
Scott: You're pretty much gonna be forced to at least make your games for the Wii and the 360 especially like that non Grade a top tier franchises.

206
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:42,210
Rym: I mean top tier franchises.

207
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:47,512
Rym: They don't have to worry about that as much because they know the hardcore fans will do whatever they need to do to get the Game.

208
00:14:47,853 --> 00:15:03,910
Rym: the game itself has this whole cache that comes with it But with lower quality lower tier third-party developers who maybe aren't well-known or games that aren't Some franchise that they know will sell you pretty much want to put it on the most popular system or as many systems as possible.

209
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:08,640
Scott: Yeah pretty much Because the Wii is actually selling compared to the GameCube.

210
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,690
Scott: you could ignore the GameCube because there weren't so many of them out there.

211
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:16,645
Scott: Publishers are not going to be able to ignore the Wii in the long run and no matter what.

212
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:24,918
Scott: even if people don't make games That take full advantage of what the Wii can do and live up to the full potential of the Wii They're still gonna make games and they're still gonna sell.

213
00:15:24,938 --> 00:15:30,439
Scott: there's plenty of good DS games out there that don't take full advantage of The DS that are selling just fine.

214
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,529
Scott: I mean that puzzle quest is all the rage right now.

215
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,699
Scott: Yeah, and apparently though the PSP version I heard is better.

216
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:38,006
Rym: Yeah, uh, the PSP.

217
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:39,490
Rym: I still don't really worry about it.

218
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,538
Scott: Oh, yeah, the PSP is still kind of crummy.

219
00:15:41,678 --> 00:15:45,914
Scott: But lately it's actually because they've been concentrating on games It's getting a little bit.

220
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:50,330
Rym: Sony did say that they're shifting a lot of resources toward the PSP to bolster it.

221
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,158
Scott: Yeah, and it it's sort of working.

222
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:54,750
Scott: I'm looking at the PSP game shelf and I'm going huh?

223
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,429
Scott: There's a few games there that no one knew about because no one talks about the PSP.

224
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,067
Rym: Yeah, but if I owned a PSP, I would have bought those games in a second.

225
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,333
Scott: Oh instantly I would have bought the puzzle.

226
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:10,843
Rym: in fact if a Mega Man game over there if a PSP were a Reasonable price I would probably purchase it and then buy all those games.

227
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:12,710
Scott: Yeah, it's getting less crappy.

228
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:14,869
Rym: The problem is I don't know what a reasonable price is for me.

229
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:19,738
Rym: I don't know if I'd pay more than a hundred bucks for a PSP because the games are good But they're not that good.

230
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:21,407
Scott: Yeah, the PSP was a hundred bucks.

231
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:21,949
Scott: I'd buy it.

232
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:26,468
Scott: I'm sure they'll eventually one day maybe like a PSP revision 2 or something.

233
00:16:26,508 --> 00:16:26,790
Scott: I don't know.

234
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:30,290
Scott: Anyway, yeah, so I got some board game news here.

235
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,989
Scott: Well, it's not really all of its not news, but it might be news to me and it might be news to you.

236
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:41,083
Scott: some guy on board game news comm Did an interview with the Rio Grande guy?

237
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:42,208
Scott: I'm not sure what his name is.

238
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,031
Scott: Let's see It's.

239
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:44,355
Scott: uh, it doesn't matter.

240
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:48,790
Scott: He's the Rio Grande guy, you know the company that prints all the awesome games in English in America.

241
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:51,822
Rym: Yeah, so what is he this company spokesman the CFO the white?

242
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:52,505
Scott: I don't know.

243
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:53,570
Scott: He might be the head guy.

244
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:54,859
Scott: I didn't bother to read it.

245
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,526
Scott: What's important are the questions He asked him and most of the questions are about games that are coming out.

246
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:00,109
Scott: You ready for this?

247
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:00,772
Scott: I'm ready.

248
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:05,762
Scott: Most of these are re-released games you see and not Not new games.

249
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:06,369
Scott: All right.

250
00:17:06,431 --> 00:17:07,650
Scott: So first of all lost cities.

251
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,132
Scott: Which is?

252
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:13,250
Scott: I played it lost cities like five times and it's a really good two-player card game.

253
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,483
Scott: It's just your deck of cards a two-player game.

254
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,670
Scott: There's some good strategy.

255
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,529
Scott: I don't know if it'd be fun infinity times, but it's a good game to own.

256
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:38,190
Scott: Well, there's gonna be a reprinting of it in Germany and they're changing like some art on it and the Rio Grande guy says yeah we're reprinting lost cities again - you know because they're reprinting it over there and I want to use the new art, but he doesn't like how the board and the cards aren't changed.

257
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:42,270
Scott: So it'd be like the old board and cards in a new box and he's like, oh that sucks.

258
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:47,150
Scott: So he's gonna try to get new board and cards to match the new box and reprint lost cities.

259
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:50,330
Scott: So if you think about lost cities, you should wait for the new reprinting.

260
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:56,470
Scott: also La cheetah or la sita or however, you want to say it is an awesome game.

261
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,730
Scott: I heard about but I was unable to buy and still am unable to buy because it's been out of print.

262
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,236
Scott: Well, they're gonna reprint it.

263
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:04,283
Scott: Oh, yeah, I'm getting that one for sure.

264
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:08,539
Scott: There's pretty much as soon as that's available I'm gonna pre-order it and get it is it's an awesome game.

265
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:09,683
Scott: power grid.

266
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:10,607
Scott: That's a famous game.

267
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:11,410
Scott: They're gonna reprint.

268
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,358
Rym: Surprisingly one I've never played.

269
00:18:13,378 --> 00:18:14,465
Rym: Yeah, I know all about it.

270
00:18:14,485 --> 00:18:15,390
Scott: I know all about it.

271
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:27,089
Scott: I watched a video at board games with Scott where board gate where that Scott that's not me Sat with the designer of the game who looked like a cool German guy and they talked all about it And I said that's a game for me and I still never played it.

272
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:32,990
Scott: Cartagena which is a game I've always wanted to play where you escaped from prison because you're pirates and you're in a prison.

273
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:42,750
Scott: They asked the guy if he has a preference For Cartagena to Cartagena second edition or the original and the guy said he hasn't played enough of them to know which one he likes.

274
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,374
Rym: The that's the one.

275
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:46,090
Rym: we have to end up going down that long corridor and get on the boat at the dock.

276
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:46,997
Scott: Yes, that's that one.

277
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:47,361
Scott: Okay.

278
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:47,502
Rym: Okay.

279
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,430
Rym: I know which game that is.

280
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,262
Scott: I kind of want to play that game - someone said it was crap.

281
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:51,785
Rym: Did they?

282
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:52,970
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

283
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,735
Scott: I looked at it.

284
00:18:53,977 --> 00:18:55,689
Scott: I want to play it but without paying for it.

285
00:18:56,433 --> 00:19:00,330
Rym: I don't remember who said it was crap, but I remember distinctly someone poo-pooing it a long time.

286
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:06,470
Scott: Well, if I ever see it at a convention, I'm playing it maybe a ConnectiCon or I'll definitely play it cuz I like the idea.

287
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:10,520
Scott: Yeah Yeah, here's the car gonna read this one at word for word.

288
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:12,910
Scott: any word on the Puerto Rico expansion?

289
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:15,789
Scott: Can you give us any hints about what will be expanding?

290
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,361
Scott: Andreas has given me no info yet.

291
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:18,824
Scott: Sorry.

292
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,330
Scott: Oh Well, there's gonna be a Puerto Rico expansion, but we don't know anything about it.

293
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:25,794
Rym: I'm not sure how I feel about that.

294
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:34,696
Rym: Puerto Rico is still as far as I'm concerned and I state this with all of my vigor Probably the best designed board game in the world.

295
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:45,408
Rym: Yeah, probably I I mean a game at best could be the equal to Puerto Rico in my eyes And I say that after having played it hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times.

296
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:48,570
Scott: Yeah That's about it for this fun little interview.

297
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:54,450
Scott: However, I do want to point out that the gathering of friends is going on soon or now or just now?

298
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,568
Scott: I don't I'm not quite sure.

299
00:19:56,171 --> 00:20:07,248
Scott: but for anyone doesn't know the gathering of friends is this invite only gaming con that lasts a whole bunch of days and All the who's who's in the awesome world of you know?

300
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:19,129
Scott: designer gaming and such go there and you can play games that aren't out yet and all kinds of stuff and Like only a few hundred people go and it's crazy and I've seen pictures of it and like woo.

301
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:21,676
Scott: But we aren't invited.

302
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:28,819
Scott: maybe one day we will be invited but probably not for a long time because we're not really Big members of that community so much.

303
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:31,630
Scott: We just are in the hobby without being in the community.

304
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:33,800
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people actually they ask us.

305
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:35,890
Rym: Oh, well, what's your name on board game geek or blah blah blah?

306
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:42,950
Rym: I have a name on board game geek, but I barely use it, you know, yeah and people like oh I'll buy those games from you But if I buy a game I'm keeping it forever.

307
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:47,885
Rym: There's only one game I've ever thought of possibly getting rid of and that's cuz it's crap.

308
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:49,390
Scott: Yeah, I gotta get rid of hell.

309
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,524
Rym: It's me Hell, this isn't that bad.

310
00:20:52,604 --> 00:20:53,530
Rym: It's just the rules are ambiguous.

311
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,901
Scott: Hell is could be fixed, but it's it's not.

312
00:20:57,002 --> 00:20:57,724
Rym: see we keep saying.

313
00:20:57,785 --> 00:20:58,387
Rym: Oh, we'll fix it.

314
00:20:58,407 --> 00:20:59,030
Rym: Oh, we'll fix it.

315
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,155
Scott: We got better things to do.

316
00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:17,379
Scott: Yeah, maybe what our old man will fix hell is play it once you'll die And then I'll sell it and then I'll die Or I'll die and then they'll sell it at my estate sale Things of the day.

317
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:24,500
Rym: So I very rarely see a picture that's so perfectly characterized as everything that I would have to say about a given situation.

318
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:27,799
Rym: But this picture pretty much sums up everything I have to say.

319
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:37,186
Rym: it shows what you can get for the same amount of money and on one side of the picture is a PlayStation 3 and one bottle of cheap beer.

320
00:21:37,748 --> 00:21:51,509
Rym: already on the left is an Xbox 360 and Several Cartons of beer more beer than any amount of humans could reasonably drink at a small party over several evenings.

321
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,970
Scott: a large amount and Both piles cost the same amount of money.

322
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,680
Rym: Yes, both files cost the same amount of money.

323
00:21:57,961 --> 00:22:06,766
Scott: So you could either get a ps3 and one beer or an Xbox 360 and a whole shit Ton of beer for the same amount of money.

324
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:14,023
Rym: see I kind of expected them to use weed in the picture except for the fact They probably would have gotten in trouble Probably.

325
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:18,851
Scott: Oh, you could probably get like a big-ass Potato sack full of weed.

326
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:24,620
Scott: I don't know how much we'd cause But I assume you could get like a potato bag full.

327
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:31,497
Rym: Of course, I always wonder because they show beer and it looks like it's Foster's which is Australian for piss water as far as I can tell.

328
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:34,940
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna have to try again with some real.

329
00:22:35,023 --> 00:22:47,610
Rym: Well, let's see They could probably get two or three cans of one of those fancy hoity-toity beers Even though that recent study showed that in double-blind trials people can't tell if you add vinegar to beer or not Even if it's fancy beer, I guess they should.

330
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,000
Scott: maybe I don't know but Guinness or something is Guinness.

331
00:22:50,383 --> 00:22:51,836
Scott: Oh, I don't drink beer at all.

332
00:22:52,903 --> 00:23:00,920
Scott: It seems to me from what other people say that you know Guinness is one of those, you know It's a brand of beer that's everywhere, but it doesn't suck that much.

333
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:11,022
Rym: Well, I generally like either really really really really dark heavy beer like a beer That would be a meal like I could drink it and my would be full for the evening or I like red strife Mm-hmm.

334
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:17,910
Rym: I really like red stripe, but I wonder what the equivalent amount of Mad train would be to this amount of Foster's.

335
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:24,215
Scott: Yeah, I wonder those night shift podcast guys They always talk about Steel Reserve, which is like the cheapest beer in the universe.

336
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,340
Scott: I wonder how much of that you could.

337
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:32,887
Rym: Well, there's always the local beers from back at RIT That genny genny stuff.

338
00:23:33,068 --> 00:23:33,510
Rym: Yeah.

339
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,880
Rym: Yeah, even though everyone actually drank lavat blue.

340
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:42,104
Scott: well that the Canadians drank the lavat blue and the Rochesterians drank the Genesee whatever.

341
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:42,466
Scott: Yes.

342
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:43,129
Scott: It's the Genesee.

343
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:43,651
Scott: It was made.

344
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:44,816
Scott: It's made in the area.

345
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,720
Scott: It's a local beer.

346
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,680
Rym: Yeah And also I'd like to point out to the person in the forums who thought that the chicken police was not a good thing.

347
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,413
Rym: One you can die on a fire and two that spider thing is ancient.

348
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:57,720
Rym: In fact, I buried it on dig for being old news.

349
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,409
Scott: Alright, so my thing today is a fun flash game.

350
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,131
Scott: It's fun.

351
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:06,239
Scott: Flash game will occupy exactly five minutes on your time.

352
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:09,187
Scott: What the fuck fungus festival?

353
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:15,667
Scott: No anyway, so, you know, I like to play a lot of flash games - you know Especially when I'm at work not working.

354
00:24:15,727 --> 00:24:18,296
Scott: I need something to cure my boredom.

355
00:24:18,497 --> 00:24:21,250
Rym: god damn it I don't know how you can be bored.

356
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,080
Rym: I would go read a book or go for a walk.

357
00:24:23,522 --> 00:24:27,900
Scott: I can't just sit there reading a book is then someone will say why are you reading a book online?

358
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,664
Scott: I guess I could.

359
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:33,200
Rym: I did that often actually when I worked at IBM and I had downtime.

360
00:24:33,762 --> 00:24:36,250
Scott: Anyway, this flash game is pretty cool.

361
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:41,085
Scott: It's actually on the Adult Swim website of all places Which I didn't realize had flash games.

362
00:24:41,186 --> 00:24:42,289
Scott: Maybe you'll have to go there more often.

363
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:46,630
Scott: This flash game is called five minutes to kill parentheses.

364
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:48,558
Scott: yourself Parentheses.

365
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:53,500
Scott: What happens in this game is you basically have five buttons?

366
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,820
Scott: You can push up down left right in space and you start out as an office worker.

367
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,861
Scott: You pick which shirt you're gonna wear and which pants you can aware and the choices aren't Diapers.

368
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:05,749
Rym: so what the pink one or the white one for the shirt?

369
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:08,460
Scott: pretty much white or blue and what shade of brown?

370
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:12,974
Scott: And there are some that are off-limits because they're casual Friday only.

371
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:15,851
Scott: maybe if you played the game on Friday you can choose those I don't know.

372
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:25,027
Scott: and You start off sitting in your little cubicle and this guy says if I get one more meeting invite I'm gonna kill myself.

373
00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:28,870
Scott: and he gets a meeting invite and he says that's it I'm killing myself.

374
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:42,379
Scott: and You walk around the office going up to various things Pushing the spacebar and then you when you go up to something to push the spacebar you will use it to kill yourself Or use it when whatever way it is used are there a lot of things?

375
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:50,633
Scott: There's a lot of things and you only have five minutes to do a hundred percent damage or else You don't kill yourself, and you don't die and you lose.

376
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:51,216
Rym: so the meetings.

377
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:51,880
Rym: in five minutes.

378
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,307
Rym: You're not dead you just go to the meeting.

379
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:56,100
Scott: I don't know, but you have five minutes to kill yourself.

380
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,844
Scott: That's how the game works.

381
00:25:56,864 --> 00:26:04,800
Scott: so like you go up to the stapler you push space you take the stapler And you'll whack yourself with it a whole bunch of times and there's blood everywhere, and it says like three percent damage.

382
00:26:05,262 --> 00:26:06,106
Scott: Staple something.

383
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:10,648
Rym: wow if I think about it if I had to kill myself in five minutes It wouldn't be easy.

384
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:17,740
Scott: without inflicting massive amounts of pain upon myself I would just get my car going really fast then get out of it and go under the wheels.

385
00:26:18,224 --> 00:26:19,659
Rym: How are you going to do that?

386
00:26:20,641 --> 00:26:21,260
Scott: What do you mean all right?

387
00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:26,735
Rym: Drive my car into something really fast that might not kill you and you might.

388
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:28,019
Rym: you'll probably lay there for a while going.

389
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:38,145
Rym: ow Oh, it might take you more than five minutes to die But a potato in the exhaust and sit in the car that takes more than five minutes Damn it plus.

390
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:39,250
Rym: We don't have a garage.

391
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,640
Scott: You just sit there until you're right out of gas.

392
00:26:43,183 --> 00:26:44,519
Scott: Maybe I'll just drink some gas.

393
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:49,500
Rym: You'd vomit and feel like crap and you probably wouldn't die at least not right away.

394
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:53,740
Scott: I'd had to go like stand a knife up on the ground and then jump out of the window and land on it.

395
00:26:53,921 --> 00:26:54,202
Rym: Why not?

396
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:57,620
Rym: if you're gonna use a knife that would hurt why not just cut yourself open?

397
00:26:58,265 --> 00:26:58,668
Scott: I don't know.

398
00:26:59,273 --> 00:27:09,031
Scott: it wouldn't be easy But pretty much it is a fun game because you're going around the office not only trying to do a hundred percent damage in five Minutes, but there's a lot of interesting things to do.

399
00:27:09,071 --> 00:27:13,507
Scott: like there's an elevator that goes to different floors And there are combinations you can do like.

400
00:27:13,547 --> 00:27:20,149
Scott: you can get the lighter and then the can of air and combine them to like burn Your face off and all sorts of interesting things.

401
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:29,440
Scott: you know and especially if you go to the second floor the first floor There's lots of weird humorous stuff, and it's it's sort of an exploration game in a way, but you only have five minutes.

402
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:36,222
Scott: You can't possibly explore everything in just one playthrough So you got to play it a few times if you want to see all the goods Does it?

403
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:40,077
Rym: I don't think it has my favorite method of suicide that a friend of ours always used to talk about.

404
00:27:40,137 --> 00:27:40,880
Rym: which one where?

405
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,279
Rym: You walk into pretty much the most crowded part of a major city that you can with a soapbox And you put it down stand up on it.

406
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:52,288
Rym: There's a trigger at your foot that is connected to the squibs around your neck And then you shout everyone everyone.

407
00:27:52,329 --> 00:27:53,153
Rym: could I have your attention?

408
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:56,737
Rym: get as big a crowd around you as possible And then yell tada and blow your head up.

409
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,377
Rym: Uh-huh, I really like that method.

410
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,664
Scott: Alrighty That's not a choice I don't think.

411
00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:04,680
Scott: but many of the choices are humorous.

412
00:28:05,322 --> 00:28:12,458
Scott: And it's also sort of humorous that like a lot of the ways you have of hurting yourself like Don't do nearly as much damage as they should.

413
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:18,160
Scott: Yeah, like he takes his face and puts it in a shredder, and it does like 3% damage even this blood everywhere.

414
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,674
Rym: It's like why if you really hard to get your face into a shredder.

415
00:28:20,915 --> 00:28:23,810
Rym: I know I don't get it I couldn't even stick my finger in your shredder.

416
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:29,694
Scott: Yeah, I'd like if you go in the bathroom There's like a clown in the in the stall for some reason and if you go in there.

417
00:28:29,715 --> 00:28:30,939
Scott: He'll beat the crap at him.

418
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:41,195
Scott: Like if you go to the second floor and try to go into this room like weasels will come out and bite you and You can put a pinata on your head and some guys will come and hit you with baseball bats.

419
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:42,440
Scott: It's it's a fun game.

420
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,182
Scott: It's worth playing.

421
00:28:43,443 --> 00:28:44,105
Rym: pinata is good.

422
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,649
Scott: Yeah play this game.

423
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:47,414
Rym: so speaking of games.

424
00:28:47,454 --> 00:28:54,637
Rym: You should play as opposed to I guess movies Where we're gonna talk about what I mean, it's definitely one of our top ten favorite games.

425
00:28:54,678 --> 00:28:55,300
Rym: We play it often.

426
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,043
Rym: We really like it.

427
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:58,311
Rym: Rainer Canizia's Amun Ray.

428
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:00,640
Scott: Amun Ray is a game about pyramids.

429
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:03,247
Rym: Yes, now before we need you.

430
00:29:03,488 --> 00:29:04,751
Rym: It's actually about bidding.

431
00:29:04,972 --> 00:29:05,353
Rym: Yes.

432
00:29:05,854 --> 00:29:07,639
Rym: We didn't even realize that when we first got it.

433
00:29:07,699 --> 00:29:09,014
Scott: No No, no, we didn't.

434
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:09,641
Rym: yes We've.

435
00:29:09,762 --> 00:29:11,871
Rym: we've learned much from this game over time.

436
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:18,940
Rym: unlike some games you figure them out right away And then it's just a matter of who has the optimal strategy quickest or who can read the other person better.

437
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:29,360
Rym: Amun Ray was one of those evolving games where as we played it over time We started realizing different things about it and the dynamics kind of pushed the game in totally different directions.

438
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,529
Scott: It didn't help that for a long period of time.

439
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:34,220
Scott: We were playing the game slightly incorrectly, which completely changed it.

440
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:41,173
Rym: Yes And then we fixed that and then we were still playing it incorrectly and then we fixed it and then we were still playing Incorrectly due to some ambiguity.

441
00:29:41,253 --> 00:29:46,978
Scott: They were small Ambiguities and incorrectness is but they existed and they did change the game significantly.

442
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,930
Rym: Yes However, even when we played it incorrectly it was.

443
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,058
Rym: it was such a good game that it still worked out.

444
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,144
Rym: it did Indeed worked out very well.

445
00:29:54,184 --> 00:29:56,571
Scott: In fact, alright, so this is how this game works.

446
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:57,072
Scott: I'm on ray.

447
00:29:57,433 --> 00:29:59,940
Scott: You've got this board full of provinces.

448
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:12,203
Scott: there's 16 provinces in ancient Egypt, right and You're gonna bid Money, you're gonna start with money and you're gonna get more money and you're gonna spend money a lot of it to get the province You want.

449
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:22,293
Scott: so in a four-player game or there'll be four provinces available and you're gonna get one and everyone's gonna get one and Then you build up the provinces and you do it two more times.

450
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:32,100
Scott: if you do it two more times in A four-player game then that's what for eight twelve provinces will end up getting bid but alright.

451
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:34,617
Rym: So everyone will get three provinces and you've built stuff on them.

452
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:35,602
Scott: Yes Here's the.

453
00:30:35,722 --> 00:30:37,850
Rym: here's the one trick of the game the thing cuz.

454
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:49,595
Rym: you know every game that we like always has that Oh Mechanic like Tigers and Euphrates had the your lowest color is your score Mm-hmm, and this game's thing.

455
00:30:49,635 --> 00:30:50,280
Rym: is that alright?

456
00:30:50,502 --> 00:30:51,876
Rym: So then you score everything you've got.

457
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:57,360
Rym: Then the Nile floods and all the farmers die and everyone loses all the provinces.

458
00:30:57,901 --> 00:31:03,506
Rym: But the pyramids everyone built remain and you play the whole game again Bidding on the same provinces.

459
00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:06,077
Rym: only now there's a bunch of stuff already on.

460
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:11,999
Scott: well pyramid Yeah, so it's like if you build a whole bunch of pyramids somewhere in the first half of the game.

461
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:26,209
Scott: You might have to pay a lot of money and bid a lot of money to get those pyramids back under your control in The second half or else you might have just bought a whole lot of pyramids for a lot of money and someone else takes Them away for very little money in the second half,

462
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:29,600
Rym: but at the same time you might not care about that depending on your strategy.

463
00:31:29,893 --> 00:31:33,329
Scott: Yep The other thing about this game is that there's this little meter.

464
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:40,620
Scott: it goes from one to four and in between every single round of play People sacrifice money to the gods.

465
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,719
Rym: Let's sacrifice them to our God.

466
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:52,436
Scott: And it's pretty fun to do this because you take an amount of money cards and you put them in your hand and you put Your hand out there And then once everyone's hand is out you turn your hand over and you reveal how much money you've got.

467
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:56,076
Rym: and it always goes like I'll go six and Scott will go negative three.

468
00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:07,700
Scott: Ah Yeah, basically you can either sacrifice to the gods in which case you give them money and they make things better or or Jack the gods you can take money from the temple.

469
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,813
Scott: You can steal three money from the temple and then you don't.

470
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:13,657
Scott: they don't make anything better for you But you get money.

471
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:25,802
Rym: But unlike other games the gods are real and I'm on right and they'll in fact Depending on how much is sacrificed at the end They'll be more or less flooding which means farmers generate more or less money and traders may or may not be able to get to The province

472
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:29,219
Scott: and temples are worth more or less victory points and all sorts of stuff.

473
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:40,700
Rym: Now beyond that the other key things about this game or that you'll buy resources behind farmers and bricks to build pyramids and Power cards which are we'll get to all that little cards that do stuff.

474
00:32:40,941 --> 00:32:51,839
Rym: Yeah, the thing is in every any given round you buy some amount of all three of these things But there's a little track that shows the effective diminishing returns of buying multiples.

475
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:57,599
Scott: Yep So on each turn you're gonna get a chance to buy power cards a chance to buy farmers and a chance to buy bricks.

476
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,187
Rym: and So bricks and pyramids are the same thing But if I buy one brick it cost one money.

477
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:05,376
Rym: if you buy two bricks it costs three three money.

478
00:33:05,437 --> 00:33:10,078
Rym: if I buy three bricks It costs six four it costs ten and it just goes up from there.

479
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:25,239
Scott: Yep So to buy three bricks in one turn cost six dollars But to buy one brick each turn for three turns costs three dollars You see because you only have to pay more for buying more of one thing at one time.

480
00:33:25,823 --> 00:33:28,200
Rym: Now this adds a very good mechanic to the game.

481
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:39,220
Rym: It prevents the common occurrence of someone just saves up a bunch of money and then blitzes somewhere because now The more you don't do in one turn the harder it is to do in any other turn.

482
00:33:39,762 --> 00:33:39,983
Scott: Yep.

483
00:33:40,304 --> 00:33:50,040
Scott: Also, there are a lot of ways to just get stuff like, you know There'll be a province on the board and if you buy that province you get a free power card or there's a mechanic where?

484
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:56,960
Rym: Depending on how much money whoever gives the most money to the gods gets three extra goodies never gives the second most Gets two extra goodies that sort of thing.

485
00:33:57,181 --> 00:34:06,380
Scott: So let's say I buy a place I bid to get a province that gives me a free power card And then on that same turn I buy two power cards, right?

486
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,399
Scott: So I got one power card and I bought two which cost three.

487
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:17,913
Scott: Normally, it would cost me six to buy three power cards in a turn But I paid three and got three power cards in a turn.

488
00:34:17,993 --> 00:34:19,320
Scott: I saved three money.

489
00:34:19,922 --> 00:34:23,636
Scott: Let's say I bought four power cards and I still got a free one, right?

490
00:34:23,656 --> 00:34:27,292
Scott: Well buying four Costs ten and what?

491
00:34:27,393 --> 00:34:28,860
Scott: buying five cost fifteen.

492
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:44,340
Scott: so getting one free one and buying four is like saving five dollars and by getting goodies beside in other ways besides buying them and Also buying them at the same time you can really get ahead in this game.

493
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:51,668
Rym: Now the other really interesting thing about this game and this is really the core before we talk more detail about the game is actually played By all appearances.

494
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:53,400
Rym: It looks like some kind of board game.

495
00:34:53,460 --> 00:35:01,372
Rym: Maybe you'll call it a building game or a resource management game or diminishing returns game But in the end once you're smart and you realize what's going on.

496
00:35:01,753 --> 00:35:03,780
Rym: This is primarily a bidding game.

497
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:09,320
Rym: It is a game where because in order to get properties you all bid on them and the mechanics of bidding are really really awesome.

498
00:35:09,814 --> 00:35:19,852
Rym: but knowing exactly how much things are worth and how much you're willing to spend on them and how much you should spend and how much other people are spending is Critical and in fact probably the primary factor.

499
00:35:19,893 --> 00:35:21,520
Rym: and who will or will not win this game?

500
00:35:22,044 --> 00:35:23,920
Scott: Yeah, I mean nothing really matters.

501
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,340
Scott: I mean, it's not hard to figure out how much stuff to buy or how much money to spend.

502
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,300
Scott: It's also not that hard to figure out how much to sacrifice to the gods.

503
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:36,040
Scott: What matters the most is what provinces you end up bidding on and winning?

504
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,179
Scott: That is the number one thing determining whether you will win or lose.

505
00:35:39,602 --> 00:35:48,000
Scott: Because for all the different stuff you can buy in this game There really aren't too many ways to get victory points and victory points are all that matters in winning.

506
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:54,913
Rym: Yep, the fact there are so few ways that you can have a turn where you can do a lot of stuff and yet None of those things will really generate you victory point.

507
00:35:54,953 --> 00:36:00,700
Scott: you can eat direct fashion You can play this whole game from beginning to end and feel like you're doing really great.

508
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:15,360
Scott: You know, you buy a shit ton of farmers you buy bricks you buy power cards you keep doing stuff You're getting lots of money and spending lots of money and all sorts of stuffs happening But in the end you might only get like a handful of victory points and you'd be like how the hell did that happen?

509
00:36:15,622 --> 00:36:18,919
Scott: Usually in most board games, you know If you're doing a lot of stuff.

510
00:36:19,301 --> 00:36:21,811
Scott: You're getting a lot of victory points pretty much no matter what.

511
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:24,200
Scott: and settlers the more you do the more victory points you get.

512
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:25,699
Scott: That's how the game works.

513
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:36,156
Scott: This is the only game where the victory you can do a lot and feel like you're and not actually get a lot of victory Points or you cannot do so much and somehow get a bunch of points.

514
00:36:36,216 --> 00:36:37,642
Scott: if you'd played smartly It's.

515
00:36:37,802 --> 00:36:38,545
Scott: it's really tricky.

516
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:42,339
Rym: now the the actual bidding mechanism and I want to talk about this because I think it's neat.

517
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:49,829
Rym: There'll be X number of provinces out there and what you'll do is you'll draw one card Randomly for each player in the game.

518
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:52,560
Rym: So if there's four players, there'll be four random things out there.

519
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:58,619
Rym: So the game is different every time you play it and not just in terms of what comes up But in terms of what order it comes up which can matter a lot.

520
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:04,700
Scott: Yeah, cuz some of the plate like remember you play three rounds and then there's a flood and then you play three rounds.

521
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:11,969
Scott: Some provinces if they come up in the first of three rounds are awesome And if they come up at the third round they suck.

522
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:21,020
Rym: so but yet this is all mitigated and balanced Automatically by the fact that the players decide what provinces are worth by bidding on them.

523
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:25,860
Scott: Yep, so if you're gonna get stuck with the sucky province, you're probably not gonna pay anything for it.

524
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:33,579
Rym: You'll just get it for free unless you were a total failure when it comes to intrigue second-guessing and valuation Yeah valuation is key.

525
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:38,100
Scott: You pretty much have to not know what the provinces are worth to buy something stupidly.

526
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:41,040
Rym: But the way the bidding works to say I started first it's just a two-player.

527
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,113
Rym: Well blue three-player game me Scott and Joey Jojo Shabbat.

528
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:46,125
Scott: ooh, Joey Jojo Shabbat That's so.

529
00:37:46,145 --> 00:37:46,672
Rym: we've got name.

530
00:37:46,712 --> 00:37:47,219
Rym: I have a height.

531
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,765
Rym: So we got three provinces out.

532
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:53,040
Rym: each province have a little card on it and it has numbers on it with spaces for the chicklets.

533
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,885
Rym: Everyone gets a little chicklet with their color.

534
00:37:55,006 --> 00:38:00,162
Rym: Yep, and it goes zero one three six ten fifteen 21 etc.

535
00:38:00,202 --> 00:38:03,044
Scott: Yep 36 I think is nice.

536
00:38:03,124 --> 00:38:08,203
Rym: and what you do is you bid how much you're going to bid by putting your chicklet on the amount Of money you were bidding.

537
00:38:08,424 --> 00:38:13,620
Scott: All right, so there's provinces a B and C and I really want province a. so I start the bidding.

538
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:14,123
Scott: Cuz I'm.

539
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:16,720
Scott: I go first because I'm the governor slash Pharaoh.

540
00:38:17,244 --> 00:38:26,960
Scott: I put my chicklet on the number three on province a. that means if no one out bids me and Decides they want to pay more than three for province a I pay three money and province a is mine.

541
00:38:27,341 --> 00:38:28,647
Rym: So then now it's my turn.

542
00:38:29,008 --> 00:38:31,960
Rym: I bid zero on another province because I really don't care.

543
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:34,106
Rym: I'm figure someone will outbid me whatever.

544
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:34,988
Rym: I'm up in the air.

545
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:38,016
Rym: Joey Jojo Decides he's gonna outbid Scott.

546
00:38:38,077 --> 00:38:39,141
Rym: He bids six on Scott.

547
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:41,290
Scott: Yeah, he wants a more than I want it.

548
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,209
Scott: So he's gonna put his chicklet on number six.

549
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:45,749
Scott: So he's gonna have to pay six money to get a now.

550
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,563
Rym: So now we keep going around the circle.

551
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:48,450
Rym: it gets back to Scott.

552
00:38:48,831 --> 00:38:53,590
Scott: I have to take my chicklet back because someone outbid me and I have to put it somewhere on another province.

553
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,090
Scott: I can't put it on the province.

554
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,293
Scott: I just took it away from.

555
00:38:56,674 --> 00:39:00,404
Rym: aside from special cards, which aren't that common whenever you're outbid.

556
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:04,317
Rym: You have to move to another province, which is Incredibly critical.

557
00:39:04,397 --> 00:39:06,150
Rym: you can plan intricate things.

558
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:12,528
Rym: Well, you'll bounce around or force other people to bounce around and raise the prices for everyone else And then get the last province for free in the end.

559
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:14,195
Scott: Yeah, it's really tricky.

560
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:18,610
Scott: cuz like, you know, if you want a province your instinct is just bid on it right away.

561
00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:27,269
Scott: But if someone out bids you you might have to remove your chicklet move it to another province and then if no one outbids you Again, you won't have a chance to move it back.

562
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:34,169
Scott: So sometimes if you know that someone else really wants another province Maybe you'll bid on that one very low.

563
00:39:34,491 --> 00:39:37,870
Scott: They'll outbid you and then you'll have a chance to move to the province you really want.

564
00:39:38,432 --> 00:39:39,999
Rym: I really like the way this goes.

565
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:42,690
Rym: It's not like other bidding games where you can bid an arbitrary amount.

566
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:46,449
Scott: Yeah, everyone just keeps bidding until whoever wants to pay the most gets it.

567
00:39:46,831 --> 00:40:06,141
Rym: I like how it forces a progression where each jump is a significant jump so you can't raise the bid by an insignificant amount which also prevents a lot of analysis paralysis because otherwise I Could account for all of my money and play very exactingly and bid Needly little exacting amounts and the game would take forever.

568
00:40:06,181 --> 00:40:08,170
Scott: Yeah, I'd be like, I'll pay four for that real big.

569
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:08,853
Scott: I've hit five.

570
00:40:09,214 --> 00:40:10,058
Scott: is it worth six?

571
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:13,090
Scott: Yeah, it's worth six and we just keep bidding back and forth.

572
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:25,230
Scott: so there's no bidding back and forth because you have to bid on something different when you get outbid and There's no thinking about one dollar differences because if I bid six your choices are to pay ten at least.

573
00:40:25,713 --> 00:40:28,010
Scott: So it's not a very difficult decision.

574
00:40:28,532 --> 00:40:35,480
Rym: so it comes down to where now when you bid any individual bid is a Momentous occasion and a big deal as opposed to a little deal.

575
00:40:35,861 --> 00:40:38,570
Rym: bidding is like moving in a board game as opposed to just bidding.

576
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,190
Rym: That's why it almost doesn't feel like bidding.

577
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:50,705
Rym: Also the fact that it's handled in this very very elegant way with moving these chiclets around going clockwise around the players Really makes it smooth and I very much like it.

578
00:40:50,946 --> 00:40:51,148
Scott: Yep.

579
00:40:51,208 --> 00:41:00,130
Scott: So eventually Because no matter what it's eventually Everyone is gonna be bidding on only one province and there won't be any conflicts or out bids or anything.

580
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:04,630
Scott: Everyone will claim that province for themselves and pay the amount of money they have bid.

581
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:09,610
Rym: So if you've got five players, it's also good to note that this is one of those rare good five player games.

582
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:14,427
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty much good with three four or five But the fact that it allows five is a big deal.

583
00:41:14,447 --> 00:41:14,750
Rym: Mm-hmm.

584
00:41:14,991 --> 00:41:18,289
Rym: And also that it allows five and yet doesn't suck with three or four.

585
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:25,489
Scott: It pretty much the game changes with different amounts of players But it's still great with different amounts of players sort of like Puerto Rico is.

586
00:41:26,052 --> 00:41:30,830
Rym: So then for each time you get a province you just buy power cards, which are like the stiffy cards and settlers.

587
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,383
Rym: they're just cards that do things like bonus points.

588
00:41:33,423 --> 00:41:40,110
Rym: if you have these provinces or Buy extra pyramid bricks for free or that sort of thing get a whole bunch of money.

589
00:41:41,092 --> 00:41:43,530
Scott: Some of them are like, you know, they modify the way you bid.

590
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:46,923
Scott: They let you bid on the same thing Even if you just got outbid on it.

591
00:41:47,124 --> 00:41:49,515
Scott: or you know There's a bid blockade where like.

592
00:41:49,595 --> 00:41:52,284
Scott: if you remember how I said the bidding goes three six ten.

593
00:41:52,726 --> 00:42:00,070
Scott: if I have the bid blockade Bidding card I could bid six use the blockade card and now you have to bid fifteen.

594
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:03,744
Scott: You can't bid ten because there's a blockade on the ten and I only have to pay six.

595
00:42:04,286 --> 00:42:07,638
Rym: now then you buy farmers Which is fun because the way farmers work is.

596
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:17,710
Rym: you put these farmers on the board in the provinces depending on how many farmer slots Are available on any given province and then they generate income for you based on how much money was sacrificed to the gods.

597
00:42:18,151 --> 00:42:34,022
Rym: which means the real fun of this game aside from the bidding is that in general the whole mechanic is that Some players will probably depending on what provinces they have have a vested interest in the gods being sacrificed to a great deal in Order to get more money from the massive numbers of farmers.

598
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:41,775
Rym: They have to get points from the pyramids Yeah, yet some players don't want the farmers to go up because they don't have any farmers They don't want anyone to make money from it.

599
00:42:42,216 --> 00:42:48,639
Rym: and some players in fact have a vested interest in the floods being low and the Gods being stiffed because they have provinces.

600
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:50,949
Rym: they get more money if the gods aren't around.

601
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:51,130
Scott: Yep.

602
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:57,630
Scott: So for example, let's say Rym has a province that has no farmers and all it has is eight money.

603
00:42:57,811 --> 00:42:59,830
Scott: No matter what this province makes eight money.

604
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:00,916
Scott: There is such a province.

605
00:43:01,076 --> 00:43:03,610
Scott: every turn that province will give eight money to Rym.

606
00:43:04,113 --> 00:43:10,408
Scott: I have a province that has five farmer slots So obviously I'm gonna try to fill it up with five farmers.

607
00:43:10,469 --> 00:43:17,670
Scott: now Let's say no one sacrifices anything to the gods and it they've gets stiffed a whole lot and we all just steal money from the temple.

608
00:43:18,352 --> 00:43:22,124
Scott: I'm only gonna get one money for each of those farmers and rims gonna get eight money.

609
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:23,368
Scott: cuz he gets eight no matter what.

610
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:32,993
Scott: now Let's say we sacrifice a whole bunch to the gods I might get two three or even four dollars for each farmer at the end of that turn after we Sacrifice.

611
00:43:33,455 --> 00:43:35,604
Scott: if I have got like five farmers that could be like $20.

612
00:43:35,604 --> 00:43:44,495
Scott: That's a lot Yeah, so obviously if I have a lot of farmers I'm gonna sacrifice to the gods a lot and if Rym has no farmers He's gonna try to fuck the gods.

613
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:51,102
Rym: now that coupled with all the other things that are affected by sacrifice to the gods You'll sacrifice very precisely.

614
00:43:51,122 --> 00:43:52,430
Rym: and it often comes to in fact the game.

615
00:43:52,470 --> 00:44:06,350
Rym: We just played of this right before we did the show I would have won except that on three occasions the bidding ended up being exactly One off or if I had put the one more up to the gods everything would have been wonderful.

616
00:44:06,912 --> 00:44:09,702
Rym: Yep, instead Alex won as he is often want to do.

617
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:10,244
Rym: Yeah.

618
00:44:10,264 --> 00:44:14,022
Rym: Yeah And another in terms of the bidding and all this.

619
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:15,469
Rym: keep talking about how there's money in the game.

620
00:44:16,051 --> 00:44:20,846
Rym: This game instead of using paper money or at something stupid just uses cards.

621
00:44:21,147 --> 00:44:24,783
Rym: all the stuff in the game Other than the bits you put on the board are cards.

622
00:44:24,803 --> 00:44:26,150
Rym: They're all the same size card.

623
00:44:26,371 --> 00:44:31,270
Rym: You just have a hand your power cards your money everything all of the same back and they're just in your hand.

624
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:32,555
Rym: No one can see what you've got.

625
00:44:32,635 --> 00:44:33,679
Rym: It's a very elegant system.

626
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:36,490
Scott: Yeah, I mean you can have a fistful of cards.

627
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:41,290
Scott: No one knows how many power cards you got unless they were counting versus how much money you've got unless they were counting.

628
00:44:41,591 --> 00:44:43,561
Scott: Because it looks like you just have a fistful of cards.

629
00:44:43,883 --> 00:44:45,330
Scott: that way you can sacrifice to the gods.

630
00:44:45,431 --> 00:44:46,769
Scott: People don't know what you're sacrificing.

631
00:44:47,531 --> 00:45:01,610
Rym: one thing I used to do when we played that I haven't been doing for a while and I'm not winning nearly as much as I used to now that I don't is I used to keep track of within about five like kind of vaguely how much money everyone had By counting their income and then I would bid accordingly.

632
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,563
Scott: I just kind of have a general feel for how much money people have.

633
00:45:04,603 --> 00:45:04,723
Scott: like.

634
00:45:04,764 --> 00:45:16,810
Scott: they have a lot of money because they have a Lot of farmers and the gods drawn three, you know, and oh, he doesn't have so much money because you know He had to fuck the gods and everyone else bid way up and he doesn't have any farmers, you know.

635
00:45:17,312 --> 00:45:20,590
Scott: And once I get that idea, I'll be like, okay, he bid three on that.

636
00:45:20,932 --> 00:45:23,509
Scott: There's no way that he's gonna pay more for that other thing.

637
00:45:23,831 --> 00:45:24,855
Scott: So I'll go over there.

638
00:45:25,136 --> 00:45:26,803
Scott: and this he can't afford it, you know.

639
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:35,755
Rym: now in terms of production Quality, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I Don't know how many times you said it.

640
00:45:35,796 --> 00:45:36,900
Rym: just ten but good God.

641
00:45:37,222 --> 00:45:38,969
Scott: I think you said it more times just now.

642
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,390
Rym: Anyway, the game is very high quality.

643
00:45:42,511 --> 00:45:47,942
Rym: All the pieces are very well put together even though the bricks now that we've played this game a gajillion times Are starting to chip up.

644
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:49,875
Rym: I think just from use Chipping up.

645
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:53,510
Scott: They just got like these weird color changes on and there's something weird happening to the bricks.

646
00:45:53,872 --> 00:45:55,301
Scott: But the pheromones are still awesome.

647
00:45:55,582 --> 00:45:56,810
Scott: The farmers are awesome.

648
00:45:57,151 --> 00:45:58,417
Scott: The cards are high quality.

649
00:45:58,437 --> 00:46:01,310
Rym: that comes with nice cardboard bits that stand up.

650
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:07,410
Rym: So when you pass the Pharaoh around he's this big guy with a whip and that Egyptian thing standing there like oh the crook.

651
00:46:07,872 --> 00:46:08,777
Scott: I think it's called a crook.

652
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:18,390
Rym: I don't know, you know that zebra Painted and the temple is very high quality and overall the production values of this game harken to the olden days where games were overproduced.

653
00:46:18,551 --> 00:46:21,604
Scott: Yeah, I mean this thing comes like a sack of plastic pyramids and bricks.

654
00:46:21,665 --> 00:46:22,267
Scott: What beats that?

655
00:46:22,508 --> 00:46:24,890
Rym: not much Yeah, I mean Dracula didn't even come with a sack.

656
00:46:25,412 --> 00:46:30,410
Scott: I know we had to go buy a sack for Dracula and it was a lot more money than Amun Ray is I think.

657
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:32,105
Rym: Yeah, of course, we got the cool flame sack.

658
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:32,630
Rym: So it's okay.

659
00:46:32,771 --> 00:46:35,190
Scott: Yeah, the flame sack is essential for a game of Dracula.

660
00:46:35,912 --> 00:46:46,490
Rym: But I mean in the end Amun Ray is a very very fun game and the only real problem I can see with it Is that for a beginner the first time player playing with experienced players?

661
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:51,570
Rym: They're pretty much gonna get almost no victory points lose horribly and feel bad.

662
00:46:52,611 --> 00:47:05,162
Scott: Yeah, but you know we had the advantage of playing inexperienced against inexperienced and learning together and With that experience in this game It's actually pretty interesting because there's just so many like.

663
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:19,162
Scott: it doesn't seem like there's so many different ways of going about it But there really are a lot of different things you can do in this game And you know at first some of them might seem like good ideas and then things you never even thought of are the really good Ideas and you were just playing like an idiot.

664
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:35,830
Rym: for example the game We just played it ended up through various means that Scott and Alex both had a vested interest in their not being farmers and not being money around and not being good big sacrifices to the gods and I ended up needing a whole bunch of sacrifices to the gods.

665
00:47:36,172 --> 00:47:39,026
Rym: So I was the odd man out and I got hurt by that.

666
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:39,549
Rym: pretty bad.

667
00:47:39,952 --> 00:47:51,863
Rym: But in the four or five player game it'll often be two against two and one guy who will play whichever side will help him out or Two against three or one against one against three or all sorts of really fun combinations.

668
00:47:52,004 --> 00:48:01,769
Rym: and while players generally don't Negotiate with each other very much There's very little meta play or deal making and there are no mechanics whatsoever in the game for that.

669
00:48:02,331 --> 00:48:12,782
Rym: Even though there's no rule as far as I can see specifically prohibiting it the game ends up having a lot of implicit Apple orange prisoners dilemma defection going on it has.

670
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:18,983
Rym: a lot of people will end up helping each other Not because they wanted to help each other but because they both had similar goals.

671
00:48:19,545 --> 00:48:20,288
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like.

672
00:48:20,348 --> 00:48:20,810
Scott: check this out.

673
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,239
Scott: Let's say you got three people right.

674
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,553
Scott: one guy has a problems with nothing No farmers.

675
00:48:24,955 --> 00:48:28,110
Scott: one guy has a problems with three farmers and one guy's problems is six farmers.

676
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:31,250
Scott: Obviously the six farmer guy wants a bigger sacrifice.

677
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,358
Scott: Obviously the no farmer guy wants a lower sacrifice.

678
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:38,150
Scott: the guy with three farmers a good sacrifice might help him.

679
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:43,430
Scott: So if he sacrifices a lot to the gods, he'll get some free goodies and he'll also get a bunch of money.

680
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:48,050
Scott: But he's also helping out the guy with even more farmers to get him get even more money.

681
00:48:48,572 --> 00:48:51,763
Scott: Now he also might want to if he screws the gods.

682
00:48:51,823 --> 00:48:52,947
Scott: Maybe he's losing something.

683
00:48:52,967 --> 00:49:01,818
Scott: He's not getting goodies He's not getting as much money as he could but he's sort of helping out the guy who was even less than him But he's also hurting the guy with more.

684
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,230
Scott: so, you know these in-between people who you know?

685
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:08,266
Scott: Maybe they have one province with a lot of farmers and one with not so many.

686
00:49:08,366 --> 00:49:12,740
Scott: or you know They're not all one-sided in how much how much they're gonna sacrifice.

687
00:49:13,142 --> 00:49:15,869
Scott: their decisions affect the game a great deal.

688
00:49:16,656 --> 00:49:37,950
Rym: Also, it seems funny though Inexperienced players while they're not going to win they will often decide the game when playing among experienced players Just due to the fact that they will cause situations where other players can profit and the game then becomes to a great degree Mess with the newbie and everyone's taking turns trying to manipulate the newbie in order to making it to make them win?

689
00:49:38,472 --> 00:49:49,999
Scott: Yeah, pretty much if I was playing against a noob and I thought they were stupid I would do the opposite of what they did because they would obviously do the best to help me doing the opposite of what they Did or I would try to.

690
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:56,950
Rym: I would try to position them to Say beat someone for most pyramids on one side, even though I know they're not gonna win from those five points.

691
00:49:57,011 --> 00:49:58,910
Rym: Yeah, totally prevent Alex from winning.

692
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:03,910
Scott: But if they're smart, I would try to do the same thing they were doing because I know they're not gonna win.

693
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:17,755
Scott: But if I got a lot of farmers and they got a lot of farmers Maybe they'll be dumb and sacrifice a whole bunch of the gods way more than is intelligent and then that'll help me out a whole lot and I'll be able to save money and get the same effect because they did The sacrificing.

694
00:50:17,796 --> 00:50:18,158
Scott: for me

695
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:34,676
Rym: this game's greatest strength I think is that despite the fact that the game setup and the way things come out is fairly random the game itself is very deterministic and To most importantly the game is self-regulating all the way through the bidding the diminishing returns Every factor in the game.

696
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:37,445
Rym: though what resources are on what provinces?

697
00:50:37,505 --> 00:50:49,090
Rym: now everything's balanced the game Self-balances to the point that there is nothing that can really throw the game out of balance No matter how crazy everyone playing is except getting all the rules wrong that that'll do it and do it a little bit.

698
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,264
Rym: But even then the game was surprisingly still well balanced.

699
00:50:52,766 --> 00:50:53,730
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of crazy.

700
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:58,570
Rym: I mean it's unlike Puerto Rico where if you screw up Puerto Rico the game just breaks down immediately.

701
00:50:59,033 --> 00:51:03,715
Scott: I think that this game really has going for is that you play most bidding games Like I don't know pizarro.

702
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:05,000
Rym: I like pizarro.

703
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,070
Scott: Yeah, but it's basically just bid on stuff.

704
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:18,109
Scott: You have money you bid on something you win stuff and then you know Whatever you win, whoever ends up getting the most stuff from bidding is the winner.

705
00:51:18,129 --> 00:51:19,373
Rym: Yep Well this game one.

706
00:51:19,654 --> 00:51:27,039
Rym: you're bidding against other people, but you're also bidding especially well in the second part of the game on things that have been modified.

707
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:37,916
Rym: so what you're bidding on is always changing and Some provinces are worth a lot early on or not worth a lot early on or they're worth a lot unless this other Provinces up for a bit at the same time.

708
00:51:38,017 --> 00:51:46,210
Scott: and not only are you bidding but after you bid you with the same money you Bid with you're gonna have to buy stuff to actually build out what you bid on.

709
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:57,715
Scott: So even if you buy the best thing you still have to have enough money left over to get you know To squeeze the juice out of the fruit you just bought and then you have to have it up left to maybe Sacrifice to the gods if you want.

710
00:51:58,076 --> 00:52:09,730
Scott: so it's like this three-stage thing that's repeated six times And the result it's a different game every time but it's still a deterministic game instead of being random.

711
00:52:10,051 --> 00:52:12,320
Scott: It's just you know, it's sort of like having a random dungeon.

712
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:14,870
Rym: It's the exact opposite of raw.

713
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:18,480
Scott: Yeah, pretty much the opposite of raw which is another game.

714
00:52:18,521 --> 00:52:22,092
Scott: that the only thing in common between that and I'm gonna raise the Egyptian Theme.

715
00:52:22,293 --> 00:52:23,237
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

716
00:52:23,298 --> 00:52:28,765
Rym: Yeah, I can't recommend this game highly enough And for the second night in a row, I'm going to bed.

717
00:52:28,785 --> 00:52:29,328
Rym: Me too.
