1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,128
Scott: It's Tuesday, June 12th.

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,332
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,540
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,324 --> 00:00:20,199
Scott: Tonight we review the crazy war game Twilight struggle.

5
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:41,430
Rym: Let's do this man, you know we've talked about this before but we were in Rochester over the weekend for a wedding which was awesome, but Millennium games in Rochester is still far and away the best gaming store I've ever seen or heard of in my entire life.

6
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:43,460
Scott: is it technically in Henrietta?

7
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:45,504
Rym: Yeah, it's in Henrietta.

8
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:46,768
Rym: I guess but it doesn't matter.

9
00:00:46,788 --> 00:00:48,514
Rym: It doesn't it's Rochester.

10
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:49,898
Scott: It's it's suburb of Rochester.

11
00:00:49,938 --> 00:00:50,440
Scott: is Rochester?

12
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:54,220
Rym: Yeah, it's like anime central was actually in Rosemont, but it's in Chicago.

13
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:58,099
Scott: Yeah, and penguin Khan is in Detroit even though it's in no.

14
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:00,368
Rym: well No penguin Khan advertised itself as no vi.

15
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:01,933
Rym: no vi is pretty separate from Detroit.

16
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:03,800
Scott: Anyway, it counts as Detroit.

17
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:05,931
Scott: Anyway, not really point is.

18
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:07,520
Scott: millennium is an awesome story.

19
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:12,260
Scott: Millennium games and hobbies is a store that it only sells games.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:23,918
Scott: I'm like a lot of other gaming stores which tend to be general nerdiness stores, you know They sell, you know all sorts of nerdy stuff including, you know, baseball cards comic books, you know toys.

21
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:31,572
Scott: millennium sells board games RPGs miniatures games and CCG's.

22
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:37,752
Rym: well They used to have back in the day a small Modeling and rocket section that looks like it disappeared.

23
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:39,339
Scott: Yeah that pretty much disappeared.

24
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:45,179
Scott: now They still have like, you know the paints and that sort of stuff for miniatures, but not so much the modeling action.

25
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:48,451
Scott: Yeah, millennium is just the awesomest store.

26
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:49,676
Scott: I mean, I don't know.

27
00:01:49,756 --> 00:02:01,140
Scott: I guess I went to that Complete strategist in New York City and they might have had a slightly better selection of the board games You know just because it was stacked from floor to ceiling with multiple copies of everything.

28
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:02,736
Rym: Yeah, they also had a lot of the old stuff.

29
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:06,149
Rym: I guess Yeah compared to what pretty much any gaming store has.

30
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:13,337
Scott: but millennium is just a better store in every way Mostly because it has room to walk around and look at things.

31
00:02:13,357 --> 00:02:23,260
Rym: plus it is Incredibly rare that I've ever walked into a millennium game Well the millennium games and not seen at least the game I wanted or if not the actual game.

32
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:24,954
Rym: I wanted another game worth buying.

33
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:30,662
Scott: Yep Yeah, I just I went into that store and since I'd been out of that store for so long I was.

34
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:34,840
Scott: it was like just like goddamn and I wanted to buy like six or seven games.

35
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:36,040
Scott: Yeah, make up my mind.

36
00:02:36,183 --> 00:02:40,679
Rym: So in the end, you know I was gonna buy one game and Scott had this one game and I got I guess he's the owner.

37
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,427
Rym: now I don't know what the guy's not the owner.

38
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:45,140
Scott: He's probably just like the you know, one of the managers.

39
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:54,360
Rym: Yeah, he's deaf because I see him there every time I go and this time Yeah I guess he recognized that we kind of brought this whole crew in with us and he ends up offering us the discount.

40
00:02:54,712 --> 00:03:00,772
Rym: Yep Which meant we just bought a bunch more games and then he happened to have La Cita's that we've been looking for forever.

41
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,215
Scott: Yeah, he's like.

42
00:03:01,236 --> 00:03:02,766
Scott: he's like, yeah Like we were.

43
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:10,935
Scott: just we were about to check out and he's like, yeah If there's any out of print games you want and I'm like, oh I remember an out of print game I want La Cita and he's like, you know, I got one in the back.

44
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:14,129
Scott: I got one in the back We opened it we were gonna play it, but we didn't play it.

45
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:16,780
Scott: So this is opened but effectively new.

46
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:20,834
Rym: So then he's like so, uh, how much should I sell it to you for?

47
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:23,785
Rym: and we're like, uh, I don't know We only see it on eBay.

48
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:27,541
Rym: So he looked on eBay and he saw that the going price was like $90.

49
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,374
Rym: so he offered us 45 bucks for it and I was opened and it's not gonna.

50
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:37,633
Scott: it's only $90 because it's Currently out of print and it's gonna be in print again soon.

51
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:39,580
Scott: So the $90 price is going to evaporate.

52
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:46,447
Scott: Yeah, well, we'll see when soon is - yeah, I heard it's gonna be pretty soon, but who knows with these things We'll see doesn't matter.

53
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:48,782
Scott: from what I know about La Cita It's good.

54
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:52,440
Scott: It's an awesome game, but I can't say that yet until I've played it even better.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,514
Rym: He started to realize cuz he's going around the store showing us like oh this game's good.

56
00:03:55,554 --> 00:03:57,382
Rym: This game's good and every game He said.

57
00:03:57,482 --> 00:04:01,858
Rym: our response was own it played it done with it or it sucks.

58
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:05,250
Rym: Yeah And eventually started realizing what our tastes were.

59
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,600
Rym: So finally we you know, we asked him about one game.

60
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:07,942
Rym: He's like.

61
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:11,100
Rym: that game will probably give you about 12 plays before you figure it out.

62
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,889
Rym: That game will probably give you about one play before you figure it out.

63
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,156
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, what do we buy?

64
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:17,060
Scott: We bought La Cita.

65
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:18,059
Rym: Yeah, we bought.

66
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:23,499
Scott: We bought the the goth game which we talked about in our gaming for hope episode.

67
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,246
Rym: Yeah I'm really looking forward to playing that.

68
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:26,451
Scott: give a full review of that.

69
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:28,540
Rym: Once we solve it Scott got a jumbo.

70
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,987
Scott: I got jumbo jumbo jumbo.

71
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:34,577
Scott: I think like one of the only two player games in the world.

72
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:35,379
Scott: That's gonna be good.

73
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:47,780
Scott: and I also got power grid which is a very very popular game and after reading the rules I can see why it is a very good game, but it is also not a game without its problems

74
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,572
Rym: like most games

75
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:49,874
Scott: yes,

76
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:56,340
Rym: and Scott got a little expansion that might make battle or slightly less painful and stupid.

77
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,560
Scott: Yeah, I got it's basically another board for battle or so that you can double the size of the game.

78
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:03,020
Scott: I think that might help a lot.

79
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:12,380
Rym: I think it'll help a lot because now there's room to maneuver other than Because the strategy in battle or that works best is pretty much line your guys up defensively and wait.

80
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:20,219
Rym: The other guy is either going to be forced to attack you and your strong position or also wait And then it's just a question of who has the most patience.

81
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:22,787
Scott: Well, you can just you can what you can do.

82
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:39,580
Scott: if you instead of waiting you can just keep manipulating your guys and rearranging them Until you're in an advantageous attack position, you know, oh Anyway, Oh Alex got tempest which is a game that I had seen and known about but I don't remember playing.

83
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:44,920
Rym: He is convinced that one of us played it with him, but I don't remember playing it.

84
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,199
Scott: I think I was playing another game while he played it.

85
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:52,660
Rym: I have definitely never played it and I'm pretty sure you and him did when I was out of town for something.

86
00:05:52,780 --> 00:06:00,648
Scott: Yeah, I recognize what the game looks like and I remember maybe being told the rules But I don't remember any of the rules.

87
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:11,917
Rym: Maybe this is like that time when for a long time It's not just Scott but much of the crew were Absolutely convinced that I had seen some of the second matrix movie with them.

88
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:12,820
Scott: You still haven't seen it.

89
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:25,045
Rym: Not only have I not seen the movie miss the 10-minute rave orgy at all But I think the reason people thought I'd seen it is that I could still make jokes about the rave orgy because I don't know I read the internet.

90
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:28,497
Rym: So I knew all about it and I knew not to see the movie.

91
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:35,880
Scott: and It's just sort of like for me going to see movies at the Tinseltown and Rochester just you know all through college.

92
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,640
Rym: Yeah, well you idiots all went to see the Dungeons & Dragons movie and I was the only one who said you know what?

93
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:42,105
Rym: I'm gonna pass.

94
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:45,134
Scott: I'm not going while that movie was ass.

95
00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:46,940
Scott: I think that was a worthwhile experience.

96
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:51,154
Rym: I just remember when you guys came back and I was like, so, uh, how was the movie?

97
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:54,665
Scott: and Pete said it was ass It was terrible.

98
00:06:54,685 --> 00:06:57,817
Rym: I was like, so you guys drove a half hour.

99
00:06:57,857 --> 00:06:58,740
Scott: It wasn't a half hour.

100
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,710
Rym: It takes at least 20 minutes to get there.

101
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,338
Scott: Well, you know, I forget how to get there.

102
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,700
Rym: now I remember I remember the back way go all the way around the left of the airport.

103
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:10,719
Scott: Yeah, I remember that part but I don't remember like the ending bit.

104
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:17,820
Rym: Anyway, the ending bit you see it's like a shining Miles into the distance because there's nothing else there.

105
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:24,120
Rym: It's literally like you take the highways through the open wilderness around an airport and there's no lights or anything.

106
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:28,697
Rym: And then in the distance, there's the shining beacon and it's the only lit up thing.

107
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:29,500
Rym: It's just this big movie.

108
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,884
Scott: Yeah, if we had a tinsel town, I'd probably go to the movies still but because all our movie theaters suck I'm not going.

109
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:41,139
Scott: well, we have some good movie theaters, but they're down in Manhattan Yep, and I'm not going because I need to get home and do this show.

110
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:44,836
Rym: Yeah, well anytime I'm there on a weekend, I tend to just if there's a good movie.

111
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:45,399
Rym: I'll go see it.

112
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:48,007
Rym: Yeah, I mean we saw paprika down there.

113
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,675
Scott: Yeah, that was movie worth seeing right?

114
00:07:50,935 --> 00:07:57,696
Rym: So in the news the Smash Brothers game coming out on the Wii because we need a new game for the Wii.

115
00:07:57,716 --> 00:07:59,763
Rym: the best game on the Wii right now Is crap.

116
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:01,208
Rym: I haven't even played any games in a while.

117
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:05,000
Scott: I haven't used the Wii in probably over a month at all.

118
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:15,620
Scott: I mean like maybe I'll beat that Super Paper Mario this week or the next week, but I Joke, I haven't really been playing video games at all.

119
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:27,055
Scott: I even stopped playing Pokemons for like since I turned it on the other day because you know Everyone was at the dim sum had Pokemon But I turned it on and the last journal entry was May 22nd.

120
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:30,840
Scott: Wow That's the last time I actually really played the Pokemon.

121
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,700
Rym: Actually, I was playing some Phoenix right on the train and I can now beat bionic commando in like 24 minutes without dying.

122
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:43,157
Rym: you should go for the world record might be a little more than that, but Under a half hour I can beat the game.

123
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:46,129
Rym: It's kind of scary because I play that game more than I play.

124
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,133
Rym: You know what.

125
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,618
Rym: that's the best game on the Wii.

126
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:51,792
Rym: right now It's not on the way because my I can't do the joke.

127
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:59,517
Rym: the last time I made the joke I said Soulcalibur 2 because that was the thing I played on the Wii the most and that's still the thing I played on the Wii the most.

128
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,340
Scott: in fact I think that everybody votes channel is still the best game by the way.

129
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,888
Rym: Yeah, but I haven't even played that in a while.

130
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:09,187
Rym: I I I guess two or three weeks ago I looked and there are like ten new things.

131
00:09:09,268 --> 00:09:10,452
Rym: I hadn't voted on any of them.

132
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:12,139
Rym: And yeah, I just gave up.

133
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:16,504
Rym: It's not worth it to boot the Wii in the time It takes to boot the Wii.

134
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:20,698
Rym: the Mac is already booted and I'm already watching someone get hit in the nuts on YouTube.

135
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:23,552
Scott: Yep So what's your news?

136
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:24,280
Rym: All right.

137
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:39,153
Rym: So anyway, this game's coming out, you know a game for the Wii and a lot of people have been wondering How it is going to be controlled because the Wii has you know, the innovative controller with the motion sensing but also as the classic controller, it also has the GameCube.

138
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:40,779
Rym: you can just plug a GameCube controller in.

139
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,874
Rym: and A lot of people really wondered how was this game gonna use the Wii stuff.

140
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:48,604
Rym: was the game gonna be GameCube classic?

141
00:09:48,624 --> 00:10:06,860
Rym: because when they first announced the game before Wii's even existed before anyone even seen a Wii People were debating and there was a rumor that the Smash Brothers game on the Wii was just gonna use the GameCube controller And that the GameCube controller was going to be like the standard controller for any game on the Wii that didn't use the special stuff.

142
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,900
Scott: Yeah, well Smash Brothers is one of those games where if they've changed like you think huh?

143
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,480
Scott: Well, how could you make a Smash Brothers game using the Wiimote intuitively?

144
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:28,325
Scott: Well, if you kept with the current Smash Brothers idiom, you know of a side view Platforming fighting knock the other guy off the edge game the Wiimote It's like you.

145
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:32,003
Scott: just you could use some gestures for some of the moves But that's really it.

146
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:43,380
Scott: you would have to change the game into some sort of Maybe first person or third quarter kind of you know still knock the guy off the edge fighting game But it wouldn't be like the previous Smash Brothers.

147
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:56,447
Rym: I mean I can picture ways of controlling a game like Smash Brothers with the Wiimote straight up And I think it could be interesting But it really wouldn't be Smash Brothers anymore, and I think a lot of people would just I mean look They.

148
00:10:56,588 --> 00:10:59,745
Rym: if they did something weird like that it'd be the same thing that happened with Wario.

149
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:16,845
Rym: people freaking loved WarioWare for the GameCube because it was just amazing multiplayer awesome and When they put it on the Wii they tried to use the Wii stuff And they didn't seem to understand what made WarioWare good and popular and as a result They made it really shit game.

150
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:23,760
Rym: if they did that with Smash Brothers people would try to play it go What the hell is this and they'd go back to playing the original Smash Brothers?

151
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:26,280
Scott: Yeah, well it seems that they definitely.

152
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:33,616
Scott: This the new Smash Brothers brawl is if you look at all these screenshots And there are some is still the same old side view.

153
00:11:33,636 --> 00:11:36,869
Scott: you know Platforming fighting knock the guy off the edge game.

154
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:43,272
Rym: and as far as the internet as reported there are four Possible control schemes all of which should theoretically be equal.

155
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:51,200
Rym: you can either hold your Wiimote sideways Hold the Wiimote up with the little nunchuck use the classic controller or use the GameCube controller.

156
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:56,218
Scott: I think the thing is I'm wondering what are people gonna do in tournaments?

157
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:01,580
Scott: because Even if the like the Wiimote nunchuck method is you know a good method?

158
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:05,652
Scott: It's not moving the Wiimote around with the motion sensor.

159
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:06,736
Rym: I don't know how you move.

160
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:22,290
Scott: well I know I'm not saying not how you move But you know moving the Wiimote physically with your hand to control anything is Not as precise as pushing a button and in a game like Smash Brothers Winning is all about having lots of precision.

161
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,281
Scott: you want to have the exact right move at the exact nanosecond You know.

162
00:12:26,743 --> 00:12:37,843
Scott: so having very precise moves and timing with the sort of you know loose imprecise control of this motion sensing Wiimote won't You're gonna.

163
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:39,492
Scott: I think you're gonna be at a disadvantage.

164
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:41,100
Rym: Well you see this is where I'm thinking.

165
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:41,944
Rym: I don't think.

166
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:47,658
Rym: even if you use the setup where you hold the nunchuck in the Wiimote I don't think the motion sensing is gonna be a part of it.

167
00:12:48,261 --> 00:13:01,699
Rym: or if it is it's gonna be incredibly minor like just activate shield if it's moving or something because My bet is that they just want it that way because you can use all the buttons on your one hand to make attacks And then use the other buttons and the control stick in the other hand to move.

168
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,059
Scott: Oh, we'll see.

169
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:11,152
Rym: I really don't think the motion sensing will be used in any mode except possibly the just holding it sideways because in that mode There's not enough buttons as far as I can tell.

170
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:24,391
Scott: I think they're definitely Gonna use it in some way And I definitely think most people are just gonna use the GameCube controller at least hardcore people are gonna use the GameCube controller So that they can have the the precision that they desire.

171
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:25,915
Rym: also the heavy rumble.

172
00:13:26,377 --> 00:13:27,259
Scott: yes the rumble.

173
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:28,945
Scott: I hope it better rumble.

174
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:33,703
Rym: get the GameCube controller to this day just has the best rumble of any controller I've ever used.

175
00:13:33,903 --> 00:13:35,188
Scott: yeah, it's rumble isn't me.

176
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,075
Rym: I mean ever the PlayStation DualShock.

177
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:38,319
Rym: It's like buzz.

178
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:39,809
Rym: Buzz.

179
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:43,066
Rym: it was always kind of the same buzz But yet the GameCube was just.

180
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:47,380
Rym: it had such control that a lot of games like you're idling your engine and the controller.

181
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,759
Rym: We're just kind of idle a little bit.

182
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,098
Rym: Just this very subtle, but that might also just been the way the developers chose to use rumble.

183
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,478
Scott: Yeah I have no idea, but I'm also I don't know how well the Xbox 360 controller rumbles.

184
00:13:59,518 --> 00:13:59,980
Rym: cuz I don't know.

185
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:02,010
Scott: If it doesn't rumble.

186
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,056
Scott: people would have said something.

187
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:03,900
Scott: it definitely rumble.

188
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,482
Rym: Maybe they did.

189
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:07,392
Rym: we don't really pay attention even though if I had free time.

190
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:14,673
Scott: I don't an Xbox 360 already yeah, but All right, so Smash Brothers brawl gonna have multiple control screams.

191
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:16,300
Scott: who knows which one will win out.

192
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,900
Rym: Yeah, all this really says to me is Nintendo has given up one more opportunity to fuck this up.

193
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:24,200
Rym: Yep, there aren't many opportunities left.

194
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:25,523
Scott: See yesterday.

195
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:32,339
Scott: I talked about Safari being for Windows which was announced at the worldwide apples worldwide developer conference.

196
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:40,639
Scott: I Couldn't really express how little I cared say yes me either But something else was announced at the worldwide developer conference.

197
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:42,975
Scott: ooh John Carmack was there.

198
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:46,057
Rym: I don't know how I feel about that.

199
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:53,580
Scott: Yeah Remember he showed off doom 3 on the Mac at a similar thing many moons ago like when the geforce 3 came out.

200
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:02,689
Scott: Yes, doom 3 geforce 3 and doom 3 were both shown for the first time at the same time on a Mac at I think a worldwide developers conference though.

201
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,176
Scott: I'm not sure by John Carmack.

202
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:07,293
Rym: so yeah, well I'm glad doom 3 was such a great game.

203
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,480
Scott: I was awesome.

204
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,405
Rym: Yeah, I mean it was so much.

205
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:14,657
Scott: the world would be totally different without doom 3 so much better than you know.

206
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:25,477
Rym: those other doom Games that I guess some people said might have been a little revolutionary in terms of yeah In those half-life games which completely dominated all FPS is forever.

207
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:29,200
Rym: Yeah now I mean I really wanted to stumble around in the dark with a flashlight.

208
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:45,880
Scott: Yeah, well anyway John Carmack showed off his new technology, which is called id tech 5. basically They've been making an engine in secret, and he showed off like something They threw together in like 10 days on this new engine, and it looked pretty good.

209
00:15:46,521 --> 00:16:06,344
Scott: basically the thing that he's promoting about this new game engine is that You no longer have the problem of you know All that without I guess having bajillions and gigabytes of memory Specific.

210
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:07,489
Rym: does it not use textures?

211
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,956
Rym: does it store textures different.

212
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:09,419
Scott: I don't know.

213
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:13,600
Scott: Okay, just give a little marketing bit.

214
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:25,250
Scott: but anyway The thing that he's really going after is that our people who are creating content like levels and maps and models and things Can change things on the pixel level with great ease.

215
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:36,660
Scott: so in theory with this new engine of his artists will be able to make Incredibly awesome game content with greater ease than ever before.

216
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:48,860
Rym: If that is actually true I'm kind of excited because I got to say I used to fiddle around a lot with doom and I made a lot of doom Levels and do modifications and all sorts of like weapon packs and whatever just for fun.

217
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:57,580
Rym: And I mean I really enjoyed it, and it wasn't that hard and obviously I was limited by the doom engine Which wasn't really the greatest most stellar thing out there?

218
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,639
Rym: But it was very easy to understand it and to manipulate it to the fullest that it could be used.

219
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:19,020
Rym: I Decided when you know half-life and quake and all those things were coming out that I wanted to continue my hobby and I realized that my hobby had become exponentially more difficult and Tedious and terrible and I gave up and I never bothered making levels for anything ever again.

220
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:25,099
Scott: I mean, it's like if I've AutoCAD or like even 3d studio max or any of those kinds of programs.

221
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:32,409
Scott: I actually kind of know how to use those and while I'm not the greatest at 3d art I can actually make or blender.

222
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,360
Scott: even I can make 3d models of things with the relative ease.

223
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:40,244
Scott: You know I don't make something that looks really pretty But I can make something.

224
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:52,284
Scott: the programs that you use to make say half-life levels God awful nightmarishly difficult to use nightmare difficult yes for Absolutely no reason.

225
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:56,356
Scott: why can't I just use AutoCAD to make a half-life 2 level it could make?

226
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:59,403
Scott: I could make one in like a day Just cuz.

227
00:17:59,604 --> 00:18:03,200
Scott: AutoCAD is actually easy to use once you learn how the hell it works.

228
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,893
Rym: Well the main reason is like in half-life 1 at least how maps are actually constructed.

229
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:22,135
Scott: We're not gonna talk about it, but So you make a thing that converts a sensible reasonable 3d model created by a human being Into your whacked-up crazy level format, that's not I wasn't.

230
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:25,775
Rym: that's not so trivial or so easy Especially back then when computers were slow.

231
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:25,876
Rym: yeah.

232
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:30,051
Scott: But regardless it sucks to make levels and things for game.

233
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:38,340
Rym: also the fact that much of it is scripting and not actually Designing the 3d part yeah, and John Carmack thinks he's gonna solve that with his new engine which looks pretty good.

234
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:43,900
Rym: Well John Carmack tends to oscillate between genius and idiot, so I'm not sure which side of the scale is on right now.

235
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:50,419
Scott: Yeah, but this engine is gonna be on the PC the 360 the ps3 and I guess the Mac also.

236
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:52,518
Scott: Why isn't it on the Wii?

237
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:53,862
Scott: Cry cuz the.

238
00:18:53,882 --> 00:19:00,760
Rym: we can't do it, but man as much as I love Nintendo I feel like Dave and Joel here just ragging on the Wii at every opportunity.

239
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:04,160
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna keep ragging on it until it has a game which I know well one day.

240
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:10,334
Scott: But we're gonna have to wait like six to twelve months Yeah, and then we will be like oh alright now the Wii is on the DS level.

241
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:11,980
Scott: It's just a matter of time.

242
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:13,537
Scott: I'm not you know too worried about.

243
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:26,407
Rym: yeah I mean I guess the only reason the DS didn't feel that way to me when I had it is that I never actually Played Mario 64. so I ended up playing Mario 64 and by the time I beat Mario 64 Wii games came out.

244
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:27,151
Rym: or God not.

245
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:28,699
Rym: Wii games DS games yep.

246
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:30,226
Rym: But I'm not that bad.

247
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:37,413
Scott: and the only thing that I'm weirded out about about this engine here Right is that pretty much any time anyone's ever made a game engine like.

248
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:48,760
Scott: I've read multiple interviews of the game engine makers And they say that when they make a new game engine they always Simultaneously make a game because how else would you know how good the engine is if you weren't trying to make a game on it?

249
00:19:49,001 --> 00:20:00,836
Scott: And when the act of making the game for the engine Whether it's a good game or not the act of doing that you know reveals all the problems in your engine as you go through and actually try to make a game on it.

250
00:20:00,857 --> 00:20:04,929
Scott: and Is Carmack making a game on this or not?

251
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:06,293
Scott: He didn't say he was.

252
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:10,820
Rym: maybe he's making not really a game But just a test case internally to test the engine?

253
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:11,745
Rym: I don't know.

254
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:17,952
Scott: I mean it's not like unless you make a full game You're not really gonna get the full effect, but at the same time.

255
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:27,735
Rym: I mean depending on your development cycle I wonder how important that is in the grand scheme compared to spending the money to make a game considering how well doom 3 did.

256
00:20:29,181 --> 00:20:34,115
Rym: Yes, yet the doom 3 engine was fairly robust, but who's using the doom 3 engine?

257
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,057
Scott: how many people bought it?

258
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,000
Rym: a lot of people?

259
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,037
Rym: Said they were going to and I don't know what came of that.

260
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,182
Scott: yeah See that's.

261
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:54,970
Scott: the other thing is that in let if your game you need a game to come out on the engine that blows everyone away so that Gamers will buy that game because you need in order to sell mods for a game you have to get gamers to buy the original game in the first place.

262
00:20:55,372 --> 00:21:09,460
Scott: and even if your engine is the most amazing and easiest to create mods and content for in the whole world if Gamers don't have the engine on their computers They're not gonna go out and buy Your game just to get the mod.

263
00:21:09,842 --> 00:21:13,745
Scott: You know it's like the game that had the game first and then once they have the game.

264
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:24,259
Scott: then they'll get all sorts of mods for it and right now half-life 2 and steam is the winner and They're gonna have to come out with some pretty fucking badass game for this engine or to push it.

265
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:28,566
Rym: Yeah, I guess we just don't know enough information So there's not really much we can say.

266
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:31,717
Scott: no I can say though one small bit is.

267
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:36,855
Scott: I heard a rumor Which is probably true that Capcom is gonna be putting stuff out on Steam.

268
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:45,838
Scott: That's the high quality things of the day.

269
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:57,310
Rym: So in the trend of having friends give us things the day because otherwise we just do whatever is on the top of dig Our dear friend I do showed me this a while ago, and it's finally a Tuesday where I can talk about it.

270
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:07,004
Rym: Monkeys at least bonobos, which are some of my favorite kinds of monkeys are Smarter than a lot of people seem to give them credit for.

271
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:07,970
Scott: I don't know.

272
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,068
Scott: I knew they were smart one of the smartest types.

273
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,643
Rym: well Would you have expected that they'd be smart enough to be pretty good at miss pac-man?

274
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:15,350
Scott: you just got to move a sticker ad they?

275
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,095
Scott: Could definitely do that.

276
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,349
Scott: they move their banana and their own sticks around plenty.

277
00:22:20,311 --> 00:22:35,709
Rym: But at the same time would you think they'd be smart enough to not only play miss pac-man reasonably well But to figure out to avoid the ghosts and then to figure out that the power pellets turn the ghost blue And then to figure out that you can eat the blue ghost, but not the non blue ghost.

278
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:44,970
Scott: yeah Well, I mean if you have any sort of cognition You could definitely tell right away that your stick is controlling the pac-man and then from there the other stuff sort of follows.

279
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:53,330
Scott: It's a pretty intuitive game and the colors are very Contrasting so you don't need like ultra awesome vision to sort of figure it out.

280
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,270
Scott: I mean at the same time did they figure out like how to get higher score?

281
00:22:57,411 --> 00:23:00,547
Scott: And you know like did they wait for all the ghosts and then eat them all?

282
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:03,981
Scott: or Are they you know trying to eat all the pellets?

283
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,150
Scott: are they using the warps on the left and the right?

284
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,475
Rym: Strategically that um I don't.

285
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:18,989
Rym: I think the point is more that a non-human is able to figure out the generic general endgame or goal of a video game.

286
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:22,880
Scott: You know most humans can barely even play pac-man.

287
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,127
Rym: that well, so well actually it wasn't.

288
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:26,310
Rym: pac-man is miss pac-man.

289
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:28,076
Rym: I much prefer it.

290
00:23:28,357 --> 00:23:32,354
Scott: Yeah, I do as well, but I must say these bonobos You it's.

291
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:35,870
Scott: I don't think it's fair to say they play pac-man as well as a human.

292
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,120
Scott: I think they play pac-man better than most humans.

293
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:40,410
Scott: most humans can't play pac-man for crap.

294
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,735
Scott: They just they don't know what the hell to do.

295
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,619
Scott: I just watch the video.

296
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:45,390
Rym: It's really interesting to watch this monkey.

297
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:49,969
Rym: Get really into this game and get very frustrated when he gets eaten.

298
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:51,435
Scott: Yeah, it's.

299
00:23:51,637 --> 00:23:52,968
Scott: it's pretty frustrating when you get eaten.

300
00:23:55,391 --> 00:24:00,165
Scott: Pac-man says no, I got pac-man's especially the first pac-man.

301
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,035
Scott: I hate it when I get eaten than at the most man I still have a burning desire.

302
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:04,260
Rym: That's the best game on the Wii.

303
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,529
Rym: I really think yeah, all right.

304
00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:11,673
Scott: So Rym knows from trying to eat lot He's trying.

305
00:24:12,055 --> 00:24:15,190
Scott: there was a time when Rym was trying to eat many proteins like more.

306
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,073
Rym: I'm still trying to.

307
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:24,430
Rym: I forced myself to eat protein constantly more protein than I would otherwise want to eat and One way to do this to eat those nasty protein bars.

308
00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:35,690
Rym: Yes For some reason some reason any thing that ever claims to be a protein supplement that isn't just meat in and of itself or possibly Nuts tastes like the inside of an asshole.

309
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:37,618
Scott: Protein is not tasty.

310
00:24:37,699 --> 00:24:39,145
Scott: only fat and sugar are tasty.

311
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:40,110
Rym: protein is tasty.

312
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,703
Rym: Well meat is tasty and meat has a lot of protein in it.

313
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:46,738
Scott: Yes, but for me Meat is not tasty because of the protein.

314
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,063
Scott: meat is tasty because of the but.

315
00:24:48,123 --> 00:24:50,070
Rym: yet the meat does not taste like ass.

316
00:24:50,351 --> 00:24:53,102
Rym: Well, the meat the protein bar tastes like ass.

317
00:24:53,464 --> 00:24:54,990
Rym: Why can't I have a meat candy bar?

318
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,828
Rym: I know you're gonna say jerky, but I can't eat that much jerky in one day or I start to feel a little ill.

319
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:05,409
Rym: Yeah Anyway, and I learned this when I ate a bunch of jerky that I found a few days ago.

320
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:10,187
Scott: Yeah, and also Rym and other people tend to really be like in the Red Bull these days.

321
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:11,070
Scott: you like the Red Bull.

322
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:20,326
Scott: Uh, I drink about one Red Bull a day on average Too many but my boss also drinks a Red Bull a day, uh, you know or more it's almost.

323
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:28,587
Rym: it's kind of bad because Red Bull does have a very noticeable effect on my alertness and awakeness and ability to concentrate and all those things.

324
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:34,750
Rym: and I Get that like I start feeling like if I'm playing counter-strike that I should drink a Red Bull right before.

325
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:47,992
Scott: Well funny you should say that because this company here has come out with a new product called Headshot as in the gamer energy bar Huh?

326
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:56,966
Scott: It is a candy bar called headshot with a picture of a sniper crosshair on it and It is a guarana infused energy bar.

327
00:25:58,212 --> 00:26:00,862
Scott: It's a candy bar, but it's got the Red Bull stuff in it.

328
00:26:00,882 --> 00:26:02,126
Rym: Well, which red does it have?

329
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:03,010
Rym: glucose in it?

330
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,541
Scott: I don't know as opposed to full ingredients, but it has guarana.

331
00:26:06,902 --> 00:26:08,508
Rym: That's that's just kind of like caffeine.

332
00:26:08,688 --> 00:26:12,389
Scott: Yeah, and Suppose they say it tastes good.

333
00:26:13,232 --> 00:26:19,130
Rym: Well, I point out that the guy who invented that cocaine drink also said that it tasted good.

334
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,069
Scott: That is why I'm saying they said it.

335
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:29,240
Rym: However, I also point out that when that guy was on TV, I might have been on The Daily Show or something I remember and he goes to like he drinks his own drink.

336
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:31,026
Rym: He winches a little bit.

337
00:26:31,528 --> 00:26:47,425
Scott: So Yeah, so if Anyone out there goes like a LAN party or some sort of game center and you see the headshot candy energy bar Try one out and tell us how it goes.

338
00:26:47,465 --> 00:26:47,746
Rym: Yes.

339
00:26:47,947 --> 00:26:54,991
Rym: I'm interested But at the same time I'd rather just drink a Red Bull that need any sort of energy bar because I don't trust that at All.

340
00:26:55,474 --> 00:27:06,750
Scott: yeah, but this might be good because if we start heavy, you know It seems like every energy thing is always a beverage like this big action going on in the beverages and there's not so much action Going on in the food, you know what?

341
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:11,530
Rym: I bet the main reason is it is very easy to mix a Red Bull with vodka.

342
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:16,444
Rym: It is not so easy to make an energy bar with vodka.

343
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:17,849
Scott: You just put whipped cream on it.

344
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:19,727
Rym: It's not gonna be good.

345
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:24,690
Scott: Okay, that's the end of things of the day, all right.

346
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:29,370
Rym: So we're kind of probably be a little bit brief about this just because we haven't played the game a lot.

347
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:37,885
Rym: But at the same time I don't see us playing it much anytime soon And I really want to at least talk about our experiences thus far before we forget.

348
00:27:38,106 --> 00:27:38,307
Scott: Yes.

349
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:43,463
Rym: So Last time I was in Rochester of many moons ago.

350
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:45,790
Rym: I picked up Twilight Struggle.

351
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,519
Scott: Yeah, basically, this is a game.

352
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:59,171
Scott: That is a two-player Cold War war Strategy simulation game and I had seen the old guys at Moz play it a lot and it was like one of their most favorite Games.

353
00:27:59,954 --> 00:28:03,546
Scott: and it was you know the sort of game that a crazy old war gamer would like.

354
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:04,689
Scott: I could tell from looking at it.

355
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:12,897
Scott: But because it was the sort of game a crazy old war gamer would like I was sort of turned off to it But it began over time.

356
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,483
Scott: I sort of warmed up to it thinking.

357
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:16,730
Scott: Hey, maybe that is the two-player game.

358
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,329
Scott: That's actually good because we really need to play our game.

359
00:28:19,691 --> 00:28:25,270
Rym: Well when I was in Rochester, I happen to see it there and I've been 50/50 on buying it if I ever saw it.

360
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,668
Rym: Anyway, yeah, so I see it and I think from the side of thing.

361
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:36,260
Rym: All right Time to make this 50/50 arbitrary decision as to whether or not I'm going to spend $65.

362
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,605
Rym: what the?

363
00:28:37,972 --> 00:28:39,197
Scott: It is an expensive game.

364
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,787
Rym: It cost the same as Zelda 2 when it came out.

365
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:42,853
Rym: Yeah It's actually.

366
00:28:42,874 --> 00:28:45,110
Rym: I think I paid 70 for Zelda 2 so it's not that bad.

367
00:28:45,190 --> 00:29:01,830
Scott: Yeah, these I've noticed that the war games and the sort of serious historical games cost a lot more money like German games cost like 40 bucks and Like American games cost like 10 bucks, but the super war games that always cost a lot of money.

368
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:26,150
Scott: They're super expensive mostly because they come with big maps and all sorts of like Detailed text and giant rule books with lots of words and lots of cards and lots of bits and you know stuff that we're a German Game, you know, it comes with a lot of wooden cubes but they're just colored cubes and this comes with like Little chits with text on them and different text on each and every one and that's kind of complicated printing going on.

369
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:31,050
Rym: Yeah, but so then I pull the box out and I see the cover art and the cover art is really nice.

370
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:32,957
Rym: I really like the cover art to this game.

371
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:33,780
Scott: It is pretty cool.

372
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,956
Rym: I don't think they could have had better art at all It's just it's perfect.

373
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:40,549
Rym: It is definitely a gestalt of what this game is.

374
00:29:41,472 --> 00:29:44,102
Rym: So pretty much that sold me on it and I bought it.

375
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,370
Scott: it's also rated very highly on board game geek.

376
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,421
Scott: It's eight point three out of ten, which on board game geek is huge.

377
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:50,424
Scott: That's like people.

378
00:29:50,585 --> 00:29:52,572
Scott: that means that people love this game Yep.

379
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:57,268
Rym: Now, uh, I like the game quite a bit more than Scott and Alex do.

380
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,550
Scott: yeah But I think Alex actually likes it a little bit less than me.

381
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:05,965
Scott: Like I don't like the game so much as a game but sort of at playing.

382
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,830
Scott: it is fun for a while.

383
00:30:09,092 --> 00:30:11,740
Rym: The continuum is I'm slightly positive on it.

384
00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:14,950
Rym: Scott is neutral and Alex is slightly sour on it.

385
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:16,655
Rym: Yeah, and I don't think he's gonna sweeten.

386
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,120
Scott: I don't think he's gonna sweeten either.

387
00:30:18,562 --> 00:30:38,005
Rym: now the game is ostensibly a simulation of the Cold War given the idea that all of the ideologies and all of the theories and all of the political ideas from the Cold War are actually true meaning Domino theory is real and the world really did work that way.

388
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:39,425
Rym: all that stuff Yeah.

389
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:45,929
Rym: So it's kind of like taking the Cold War at face value Being in that time period believing these things to be true.

390
00:30:46,472 --> 00:31:05,541
Rym: It tries to simulate not so much the historical reality of the Cold War but the kinds of decision-making and the kinds of Feelings and the tension and the brinksmanship of the Cold War and it also tries to be an asymmetric Good two-player game and I'm not sure if it succeeded.

391
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:08,450
Rym: I really am not sure how I feel about this game.

392
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:10,938
Scott: Yeah, basically the way the game works is.

393
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:14,470
Scott: you have these cards and there's you know, three part.

394
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:39,808
Scott: There's the early cards which are sort of the cards that represent events that happened early in the Cold War the middle cards that represent events that happened in middle of the Cold War and the late cards that happen represent events that happen late in the Cold War and You deal out these cards to both players and some cards are for the Soviets and some cards are for the US and some cards Are for both and every card is a number on it and every card also has a historical event.

395
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:42,698
Scott: now Basically, you might get the other guys card.

396
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:45,448
Scott: So if I'm the US I might have a fistful of Russia cards.

397
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:45,850
Scott: Who knows?

398
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:48,417
Rym: The second game of this I play.

399
00:31:48,437 --> 00:32:00,099
Rym: Well, like yeah the third game whatever the one game I played with Alex I drew all Russia cards and you were the US and Alex drew all Russia cards.

400
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:02,910
Rym: not so good for the US and it was awesome.

401
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:08,024
Scott: Yeah So but on your turn what you do is you take a certain number of at.

402
00:32:08,044 --> 00:32:15,929
Scott: you take turns playing cards and when you play A card you can either play it for the event that's on it or you can play it to just.

403
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:18,710
Scott: you know Do stuff on the board based on the numbers.

404
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,296
Scott: So it has a number like four.

405
00:32:20,618 --> 00:32:23,570
Scott: you can do four things on the move guys around the boards.

406
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:28,450
Rym: yeah, the cards are numbered one through four and Generally the higher the number the better the event.

407
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,990
Rym: So it's definitely a trade-off and the number is just how much you get to influence the board.

408
00:32:33,091 --> 00:32:34,830
Rym: We're not really gonna talk about the details this game.

409
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:35,913
Rym: Yes It's really complicated.

410
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:44,190
Scott: basically want to move numbers around the board to take over more countries in different areas Like aha, I have the majority of the spots in Europe.

411
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:48,325
Scott: That's more points for me and aha I have more places in.

412
00:32:48,547 --> 00:33:01,450
Rym: you know Asia kind of conquered and you're just increasing influence and on different countries and things Yeah, and inciting coups in places and bringing DEFCON down engaging in military actions and all sorts of stuff all sorts of cold war stuff.

413
00:33:01,651 --> 00:33:12,922
Scott: But basically what you're doing is you're playing cards either to make historical events happen which the what happens is written on the card or To just do standard moves and let.

414
00:33:13,143 --> 00:33:14,970
Scott: I can even use the other guys cards.

415
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:16,025
Scott: Of course, you're gonna have to.

416
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:22,710
Scott: you know If you draw Soviet cars near the US you would play say a Soviet card and I would use the number two to do two.

417
00:33:23,412 --> 00:33:28,110
Scott: But because I played the Soviets card and I'm the US the event still happens.

418
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:36,798
Rym: Well see to actually explain what Scott like how that actually works is if you play a card that has your own event on it So I'm the US I play a card with the US.

419
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,590
Rym: I have to choose to either do the number or the event.

420
00:33:39,693 --> 00:33:40,308
Rym: I don't get both.

421
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:51,046
Rym: But if I play my opponent's card for the number on it, I guess I could play it for the event But you wouldn't want to because they're always bad Always for you and always good for the other person.

422
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:56,710
Rym: Mm-hmm Then you play it you get the number but the event happens no matter what and it happens immediately.

423
00:33:57,272 --> 00:34:01,230
Rym: So you kind of get this game where you have a set of cards and events?

424
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:08,010
Rym: So, you know to what extent you can influence the game and what things are on the horizon as far as you can plan for.

425
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:22,370
Rym: but at the same time so like maybe you'll have to play a card with the number three because you really need to do those three actions somewhere and You can take the calculated risk of allowing your opponent's action to happen Like you can plan for that event and act accordingly.

426
00:34:22,998 --> 00:34:34,672
Rym: but at the same time There's also the other player who has their own hand of cards and you have to kind of predict what they're going to do And try to figure out what cards they might be holding based on the actions They're taking.

427
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:37,926
Rym: based on the actions you're taking which cup is poisoned.

428
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:38,649
Rym: I don't know.

429
00:34:38,956 --> 00:34:48,630
Scott: Yeah a lot of the game is it seems like In advanced play a lot to in order to win if someone the other guy knows what the cards are in the deck.

430
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:54,250
Scott: Like he's studied all the cards or he's played it so many times that he knows what most of the important cards are or what?

431
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,135
Scott: All the cards are.

432
00:34:55,155 --> 00:34:59,942
Scott: they're gonna be at a significant advantage Regardless of their strategy because they'll be like, aha.

433
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,490
Scott: I see what he just did there.

434
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,068
Scott: he's probably got this card, so I'll do this to foil him.

435
00:35:04,088 --> 00:35:07,446
Scott: and That's a big part of the game.

436
00:35:07,466 --> 00:35:07,527
Scott: Yep

437
00:35:08,384 --> 00:35:25,204
Rym: I mean I think part of the reason that it's hard to say if we like this game or not is that I Get the sense that the majority of the good part of the game can only be had between two experienced players of the game because it's kind of like if you're playing chess with an idiot.

438
00:35:25,565 --> 00:35:28,076
Rym: where say you set up some sort of Complicated.

439
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,836
Rym: I'll put this piece out But it's actually a faint.

440
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:31,820
Rym: and what didn't you have?

441
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,770
Rym: this whole layered plan of you know?

442
00:35:34,111 --> 00:35:37,670
Rym: A smart player wouldn't do this because plus you plan on the other person being smart.

443
00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:43,570
Rym: But if someone's never played the game before you might bluff or do something interesting and they won't even see it.

444
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:49,910
Rym: I'll just kind of blunder through the game and As a result all the strategic planning just kind of goes to hell and the game's not fun anymore.

445
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:58,730
Rym: Yeah, and between two novice players you haven't played the game enough So you can't really formulate a real good strategy.

446
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:05,800
Rym: You can't really bluff effectively because you can't know if your opponent would even recognize what you were doing at all.

447
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,010
Rym: bluffing or not bluffing and It's just the game doesn't flow too.

448
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:15,390
Rym: Well, it also didn't help that Scott didn't look at the list of cards so we often didn't know what cards were coming up when.

449
00:36:15,853 --> 00:36:23,810
Rym: Well, you know it's just that You're putting all your influence in Africa, and then eventually I point out that Africa can't be scored until the mid game.

450
00:36:24,111 --> 00:36:28,350
Rym: Yeah, yeah stuff like that, but you're like yeah, I took over Egypt, and I'm like yeah, good luck with that.

451
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:29,253
Rym: You can have it.

452
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:31,701
Scott: I think Egypt's actually Middle East in that game.

453
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,006
Rym: I'm not sure about it doesn't matter.

454
00:36:33,046 --> 00:36:33,869
Scott: It doesn't matter either.

455
00:36:34,895 --> 00:36:56,750
Scott: My basically the main problem I have with the game is that at least for us who are people who don't know all the cards and haven't studied the Game extensively and such it seems like Whether you do well or poorly Depends almost entirely on who who gets what cards if I am the US and I draw a fistful of US cards.

456
00:36:57,093 --> 00:37:00,879
Scott: I'm going to get way ahead Even if I try to fuck up.

457
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:11,106
Rym: see now you like no matter what I do while I thought that the game is a very interesting mechanic where The score is zero and the score can go toward the US or toward Russia.

458
00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:12,030
Rym: I think this is really cool.

459
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:25,410
Rym: so if I score five points it moves five toward Russian victory and if Scott scores three moves three toward US victory and At the end of the game whoever has the most points on theirs well, which whoever has the marker on their side anywhere wins.

460
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:35,919
Rym: Also, there's a fun mechanic where if you get the marker all the way to the end of your side the game ends immediately And you immediately win no matter what.

461
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:36,582
Scott: yep,

462
00:37:37,285 --> 00:37:53,410
Rym: and the first game we played That's how the US won, but and in the second game when I played with Alex We had this horrible situation where every single card benefited him and screwed me And he had like 15 points after the first couple rounds, and I had almost nothing on the board.

463
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,173
Rym: I was totally fucked.

464
00:37:54,936 --> 00:38:04,090
Rym: it seems like they chose the number of points to absolute victory very well Because since it's an asymmetric game, and there's a limited number of cards, and it's a known quantity of cards.

465
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:12,189
Rym: the game tends to even itself out and Scott Alex did really well and did like started controlling everything and got all these points.

466
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:18,790
Rym: but Then the tide turned because now there's only good cards for me left in the deck for a while.

467
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:23,749
Rym: And it's more a matter of you have to manage your cards to make the most out of what you've got.

468
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:30,130
Rym: and No matter how good a run of luck you have I don't think there are many runs of luck that will just win you the game.

469
00:38:30,772 --> 00:38:33,965
Scott: Yeah, but it does seem like you know it depends.

470
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:41,544
Scott: You're doing well Depends a great deal on more on the cards rather than See anything else like I just said.

471
00:38:41,644 --> 00:38:42,490
Rym: I really don't think so.

472
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:52,460
Rym: I think the game is set to where it Balances out in the end almost no matter what and it's more a matter of how you use the cards you get and how you Plan like say I have the crap hand.

473
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:57,015
Rym: my game now is not you know Win or do it.

474
00:38:57,055 --> 00:39:02,030
Rym: my game now until I get better cards is how do I control this situation?

475
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:10,430
Rym: How do I put this bad situation to be as little harm to me as possible like how do I mitigate the damage and hold?

476
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,861
Rym: Until my string of luck come?

477
00:39:12,921 --> 00:39:22,230
Scott: yes, well, I think what it is also Is that you know certain events on certain cards are more or less powerful depending on the current situation in the game?

478
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:26,350
Scott: Yeah, like you have a card where right now this card doesn't do much for you.

479
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,668
Scott: but if you had the card say a turn ago, you could have kicked some ass with it.

480
00:39:29,688 --> 00:39:35,464
Scott: and You know it's not really up to you whether you get this card last turn or this turn.

481
00:39:35,544 --> 00:39:41,090
Scott: so it's sort of obvious that Okay, you know this turn this card doesn't do much for me.

482
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:45,468
Scott: so I'll use it for the number and you know because it's not the event isn't so useful for me.

483
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:51,729
Scott: or Aha this card would be really good for Rym if it happened now, so I'll space race this one.

484
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:56,707
Scott: and You know this card is usually good for Rym, but right now.

485
00:39:56,787 --> 00:39:57,450
Scott: It's not so good.

486
00:39:57,611 --> 00:39:59,881
Scott: You know it doesn't help him as much as it normally could.

487
00:40:00,243 --> 00:40:03,819
Scott: so I'll let him use this one right now So it doesn't get used later when it's more dangerous.

488
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:04,100
Rym: I don't know.

489
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,260
Rym: while the game is not the greatest game I really think you're underestimating the tactical depth.

490
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:16,127
Scott: That's in there see but most of that tactical depth is You and the other guy have to know what all the freaking cards are.

491
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:31,489
Rym: yeah Well the other interesting thing is that if you know about the cold war The game is pretty intuitive because you kind of know like what parts the world were unstable generally when and what kinds of things happen when and you can really plan ahead a lot better.

492
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:35,472
Rym: and Scott really didn't know much about the cold war so he didn't really Like.

493
00:40:35,492 --> 00:40:41,509
Rym: he didn't take advantage of the fact that France could very easily sway toward communism in the early game and things like that.

494
00:40:42,494 --> 00:40:45,710
Scott: Yeah, it's because I I know a lot of people out there.

495
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,142
Scott: They really like those games that have real history.

496
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:49,568
Scott: like you're playing rare or tycoon.

497
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,197
Scott: We had maws and this one guy was actually just.

498
00:40:52,538 --> 00:41:01,892
Scott: he was more interested in like what kind of train was drawn on the level Up card, and you know the history of that kind of train engine than the actual game That was going on.

499
00:41:01,932 --> 00:41:04,299
Scott: and I'm not that kind of person like.

500
00:41:04,499 --> 00:41:08,230
Scott: I'm perfectly happy playing a game if it's historically inaccurate.

501
00:41:08,371 --> 00:41:12,276
Scott: It just like aliens and space monsters I really don't care like.

502
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:18,494
Scott: the theme is nice to look at and nice to maybe like add some role-playing type fun like yar The cold war.

503
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:23,950
Scott: you're evil Russian something something blah, but I don't really don't care about the history.

504
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:26,510
Scott: I care about the strategy of the game itself.

505
00:41:27,232 --> 00:41:27,995
Rym: Here's the other thing.

506
00:41:28,275 --> 00:41:32,950
Rym: you even the card list was there and even without the card list you didn't plan ahead.

507
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:41,026
Rym: When we played the game you pretty much played each turn as though it were an independent thing in and of itself and there was Absolutely, no forward planning at all.

508
00:41:41,388 --> 00:41:41,610
Rym: well

509
00:41:41,851 --> 00:41:59,150
Scott: That's also because like it seems like when I play the game even if I'm trying to think of forward planning it's like I look at my hand and I look at the board and It seems like the best plan long-term or short-term is to use the cards in my hand in the best way possible.

510
00:41:59,471 --> 00:42:04,370
Rym: Well, there's no best way possible because you like the ops you can put influence somewhere on the board.

511
00:42:04,812 --> 00:42:06,884
Rym: You can put the influences just about anywhere.

512
00:42:07,145 --> 00:42:07,970
Rym: Where are you going to put them?

513
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:36,269
Rym: You got a plan ahead and the two times I played the game I planned like where I was going to expand to a good like two turns in advance And I only altered that if the situation absolutely forced me to because I'd made a mistake And while Alex completely dominated me for the early part of the game with that run of luck But by the end of that while he had a lot of victory points I controlled every single part of the board and if the game had continued, I really think I was going to win.

514
00:42:37,591 --> 00:42:41,110
Rym: However, I conceded defeat because here's my real gripe about the game.

515
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:56,890
Rym: I mean, I really think you underestimate the tactics and I think you give the game less credit than is due though I'm not saying that the game deserves Great amounts of credit because the real problem is quite simply that this game should be a video game as a board game.

516
00:42:56,972 --> 00:43:12,990
Rym: It's crap because as a result a lot of the game mechanics that could be interesting are really dumbed down and simplified to be able to be done with counters and markers and dice and You spend so much time just manipulating physically all these pieces all over and keeping track of all these numbers.

517
00:43:13,693 --> 00:43:22,690
Rym: If the game were a PC game, I probably played a lot but the fact that I have to do all this Constantly on my own and if I make any mistake the game's fucked and there's no way to fix it.

518
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:36,950
Scott: You have to quit because of all these cards like there are cards that come out and sort of have lasting effects on the game and like you have to remember those effects and Like doing one thing like makes like three different like exceptions to the rules count.

519
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:41,113
Scott: Yeah, like like and if you look at the instruction book It's it's.

520
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:45,770
Scott: it's labeled like five dot one five dot one dot one five dot one dot two.

521
00:43:45,931 --> 00:43:50,648
Scott: Each rule is a separate numbered item in this book and it goes on for like.

522
00:43:50,688 --> 00:43:55,285
Scott: it's a big book with lots and lots of these rules in it and each one is important.

523
00:43:55,305 --> 00:44:08,750
Scott: and if you forget just one You've ruined the entire game and it's very difficult unless you play very slowly and methodically To make sure that you do everything perfectly and manipulate every piece without messing up.

524
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:14,943
Rym: I just want to point out that of all the times we've played this game Rym screwed the game up zero time.

525
00:44:15,063 --> 00:44:16,350
Scott: you screwed the game a little bit.

526
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:25,908
Rym: No, yeah, and because you see the thing that you accused me of screwing up How come the exact same thing happened to you when you played against a different thing?

527
00:44:25,948 --> 00:44:26,530
Scott: that happened?

528
00:44:28,111 --> 00:44:33,469
Rym: You not drawing enough cards the only times the game screwed up for games that Scott was involved in.

529
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:43,600
Rym: Anyway, but the point is the real problem with the game aside from that is that it's tries to sit like the one cool Thing is that nuclear war is not the goal.

530
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:45,390
Rym: nuclear war immediately ends the game.

531
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:50,330
Rym: Whoever caused the nuclear war to happen loses, but the game doesn't have any brinksmanship.

532
00:44:50,631 --> 00:44:53,282
Rym: There's almost no reason to go toward nuclear war.

533
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,050
Rym: There's no tension in the game.

534
00:44:55,571 --> 00:45:04,204
Rym: It's so like methodical and calculating the way you play that you never really get the sense that you're actually anywhere close to a nuclear war.

535
00:45:04,224 --> 00:45:10,350
Rym: and in fact You can only really have a nuclear war if you are stupid and you just stupidly make a mistake.

536
00:45:11,313 --> 00:45:26,923
Scott: Yeah, it seems like I like when games have many different avenues to victory like, you know civilization You can if you play Civ 3 or Civ 4. you can win by war by a space shuttle by Culture by all sorts of things right in this game.

537
00:45:26,963 --> 00:45:29,269
Scott: You can win by making the other guy nuclear war.

538
00:45:29,913 --> 00:45:43,090
Scott: victory points all sorts of conquering all of Europe many different ways to win but Most of those ways to win are sort of these flukes that don't really happen unless someone really screws up.

539
00:45:43,712 --> 00:45:49,209
Rym: Actually, I think they can all happen pretty readily except for the nuclear war.

540
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,890
Rym: one Nuclear war is the only one that can really happen by accident.

541
00:45:53,211 --> 00:46:00,750
Scott: Yeah, but it seems like most of the game is concentrated on the victory points and the rest is sort of like these side Like, you know special case.

542
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:01,152
Scott: Well, like

543
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:17,709
Rym: I was saying the game should be this kind of brinksmanship game But there's no real brinksmanship in the game because the only stakes involved in brinksmanship at all because coups kind of suck are simply Oh, no, I have to engage in a military action because Scott engaged in a military action.

544
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:20,338
Rym: Otherwise, I'll lose a point or two.

545
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:23,127
Rym: and oh no is the DEFCON went down to three?

546
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,110
Rym: whoopty shit.

547
00:46:24,935 --> 00:46:26,890
Scott: Yeah, it's just gonna go back up again next.

548
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:30,430
Rym: Yeah, I mean it got down to two a couple times and there was no fear.

549
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:30,821
Rym: There was.

550
00:46:30,882 --> 00:46:32,749
Rym: no Are you gonna head it?

551
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:36,825
Rym: Because you can't screw that up unless you're really dumb or not paying attention.

552
00:46:36,885 --> 00:46:44,409
Rym: and in the end I like the game more than Scott and Alex But I don't have time to play it and I don't think I'm ever gonna really pick it up again.

553
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:50,650
Scott: Yeah, I mean not only is the game not so amazing, but you play it with two people.

554
00:46:50,731 --> 00:46:52,026
Scott: It takes forever to set it up.

555
00:46:52,512 --> 00:47:00,998
Scott: It's like read this book like you have to put exactly this number of pieces in these places and then you have to The board is really flimsy.

556
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:08,325
Scott: Yeah, the board like I know it the Moz guys They have this big piece of clear plastic They put on top of the board and that helps out a lot.

557
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:17,084
Scott: because the board It kind of bends and it punch and you're only putting these little tiny pieces of cardboard on it So they don't hold they don't weigh the board down.

558
00:47:17,145 --> 00:47:18,070
Scott: So it never gets flat.

559
00:47:18,371 --> 00:47:19,998
Rym: Also, that's the easiest way to screw up the game.

560
00:47:20,018 --> 00:47:21,284
Rym: If you just sneeze it's over.

561
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:22,147
Rym: You can't fix that.

562
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:25,985
Scott: Yep, and There's just so many that's like I don't know.

563
00:47:26,146 --> 00:47:26,850
Scott: Yeah, it really needs.

564
00:47:27,674 --> 00:47:30,869
Rym: The game has to be a video game or else it's just not worth it.

565
00:47:31,411 --> 00:47:34,910
Scott: Yeah, you know when you play Civilization 2 and you double-click on a city, right?

566
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:44,669
Scott: and you see like all the different meters with different numbers on them like you making this many grain this many this and All these things the game sort of calculates for you and you just look at to get the.

567
00:47:44,709 --> 00:47:58,930
Scott: you know This this visual aid to show you what's going on in this game All that that sort of level of complexity is there but you're managing it with your hands and math in your head And it's not visually there for you all the time.

568
00:47:59,051 --> 00:47:59,213
Scott: Well,

569
00:47:59,253 --> 00:48:10,985
Rym: I mean the game takes a long time to play But if I didn't have to manipulate like I looked at all the time I spend manipulating Versus the time I spend taking my turn You could knock off a game of this in less than an hour if it was a video game.

570
00:48:11,427 --> 00:48:12,130
Scott: Oh, absolutely.

571
00:48:12,673 --> 00:48:15,470
Rym: But no, it takes several hours to actually play the game with the pieces.

572
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:19,430
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's like deciding what to do takes like two seconds.

573
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:21,582
Scott: The part that takes a long time is okay.

574
00:48:21,602 --> 00:48:22,587
Scott: I decided what I'm gonna do now.

575
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:24,597
Scott: I gotta roll this dice now.

576
00:48:24,657 --> 00:48:25,421
Rym: I got I now.

577
00:48:25,642 --> 00:48:26,124
Scott: now I got.

578
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:27,410
Scott: no sometimes you roll dice.

579
00:48:27,591 --> 00:48:30,079
Rym: You said well, you only roll die in that game.

580
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:31,604
Rym: You roll one die, whatever.

581
00:48:31,945 --> 00:48:33,450
Rym: and then I said roll this dice.

582
00:48:33,771 --> 00:48:34,875
Scott: Anyway, then you got.

583
00:48:34,895 --> 00:48:36,341
Rym: if you what is you should have said these dice.

584
00:48:36,722 --> 00:48:38,268
Scott: then you got to do some master period.

585
00:48:38,288 --> 00:48:38,791
Rym: it'd be kind of.

586
00:48:40,071 --> 00:48:41,394
Scott: Then you got it.

587
00:48:41,574 --> 00:48:42,756
Scott: then you got to do some math.

588
00:48:43,157 --> 00:48:43,999
Scott: then you got to.

589
00:48:44,419 --> 00:48:58,450
Scott: you know Take a piece of cardboard off the board put a piece of cardboard on the board then flip those pieces of cardboard over and then Look at neighboring pieces of cardboard that all look the same and have little tiny numbers that are different and then it it takes forever.

590
00:48:59,531 --> 00:49:05,829
Scott: All I want to do when I play a game is spend all my time making decisions and that's all I should have to do.

591
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:08,865
Scott: I shouldn't have to do much more than that now granted.

592
00:49:08,885 --> 00:49:12,320
Rym: The game is still Easily two or three times better than battle are.

593
00:49:12,661 --> 00:49:21,588
Rym: so as a two-player game if you need Kind of like battle or I can't stand battle or it's just it's so it's drivel.

594
00:49:21,728 --> 00:49:22,853
Rym: I'm sorry You suck.

595
00:49:23,014 --> 00:49:23,779
Rym: The game is just.

596
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:25,750
Rym: there's no substance to it whatsoever.

597
00:49:26,933 --> 00:49:28,970
Scott: This game just like pretends to have substance.

598
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,356
Rym: No, I this game has a lot of.

599
00:49:30,998 --> 00:49:33,589
Rym: this game has a lot more tactical depth than you give it credit for.

600
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:34,713
Scott: no I don't think so.

601
00:49:35,536 --> 00:49:37,322
Scott: I think all the tactical depth is just.

602
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:39,370
Scott: you know, what the cards are.

603
00:49:39,732 --> 00:49:41,989
Rym: No a lot of it's still knowing what the cards are.

604
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:52,730
Rym: It's a game of knowledge more than it's a game of no because once you know the cards and your opponent knows the cards it Becomes a game of bluffing and second-guessing and planning ahead and it's still a strategic game.

605
00:49:52,973 --> 00:49:53,909
Scott: Yeah, I don't think so.

606
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:58,610
Rym: In fact, if the game were easier and quicker to play I'd play it a lot more because I do enjoy it.

607
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:00,439
Rym: Like I said, I have a somewhat positive view of it.

608
00:50:00,922 --> 00:50:02,550
Scott: Yeah, you do I disagree.

609
00:50:02,851 --> 00:50:10,594
Rym: Yeah, well if you want to play a really simple crappy entirely non skill based game Is for you.

610
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:15,310
Scott: battle or I think is is skill based and you it's just the level of skill is low.

611
00:50:15,651 --> 00:50:16,573
Rym: Yes, low.

612
00:50:16,915 --> 00:50:19,242
Rym: so low to be effectively meaningless.

613
00:50:19,402 --> 00:50:23,558
Rym: No, no battle or is not a game of Be better at it.

614
00:50:23,638 --> 00:50:24,362
Rym: It's a game of.

615
00:50:24,664 --> 00:50:25,730
Rym: don't screw it up.

616
00:50:26,611 --> 00:50:28,317
Scott: Hey, it's just an easy game.

617
00:50:28,377 --> 00:50:29,701
Scott: It's not a no skill game.

618
00:50:30,263 --> 00:50:31,387
Rym: It doesn't take much skill.

619
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:34,625
Scott: I gotta say It's a no skill game.

620
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:35,350
Scott: is like Candyland.

621
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:39,610
Scott: There is no skill battle or if someone had no skill they would lose every time.

622
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,978
Scott: It's just the required level of skill.

623
00:50:42,018 --> 00:50:43,804
Scott: to be the master is not much.

624
00:50:44,126 --> 00:50:48,261
Rym: if all you've got left Is that it doesn't have no skill then?

625
00:50:48,281 --> 00:50:49,545
Rym: I think I've won that today.

626
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:50,810
Scott: It's not a no skill game.

627
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,015
Scott: It is a game of skill line.

628
00:50:52,095 --> 00:50:54,345
Rym: It is a minimal skill game.

629
00:50:54,465 --> 00:50:58,009
Rym: It is a mostly die-rolling luck based game.

630
00:50:59,072 --> 00:51:00,460
Scott: Now the luck isn't that big?

631
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,104
Rym: Yes, it is.

632
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:06,002
Scott: Like it's also There's other luck in Twilight struggle besides just what cards you get.

633
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:08,109
Scott: that is bitten me multiple times.

634
00:51:08,672 --> 00:51:12,630
Rym: Yeah, well part of it is that you tended to take risks that weren't worth it.

635
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:18,400
Scott: Well, that was in like one time I played and your next time I played I would have like a huge advantage And it would still ruin me.

636
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,670
Scott: Yeah stupid dice.

637
00:51:20,171 --> 00:51:20,592
Rym: Well, that's just.

638
00:51:20,672 --> 00:51:24,603
Rym: any game that has dice is fundamentally in most cases pretty broken.

639
00:51:24,643 --> 00:51:34,390
Scott: I'd say yeah, but I just kind of hate how You know it rolling the 1d6 and then even though you had a huge advantage you still got beat back.

640
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:38,906
Rym: But at the same time you still get all the military points for it.

641
00:51:38,946 --> 00:51:39,850
Rym: So it still works out.

642
00:51:39,991 --> 00:51:41,302
Rym: It's not like it's a wasted turn.

643
00:51:41,322 --> 00:51:46,048
Scott: Yeah Anyway, Twilight struggle is the sixth most popular game on board game.

644
00:51:46,068 --> 00:51:46,289
Scott: geek.

645
00:51:47,311 --> 00:51:49,140
Rym: Where's a battle or on that list now?

646
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:50,145
Scott: I have no idea.

647
00:51:50,225 --> 00:51:51,150
Rym: I think it's been dropping.

648
00:51:51,372 --> 00:51:53,607
Rym: It used to be pretty high and then people actually played it.

649
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:56,571
Scott: It's number Number.

650
00:51:56,632 --> 00:51:57,334
Rym: what seven?

651
00:51:57,675 --> 00:51:58,076
Rym: All right.

652
00:51:58,176 --> 00:51:58,497
Rym: All right.

653
00:51:58,598 --> 00:51:59,922
Rym: It's got some time to fall still.

654
00:52:01,005 --> 00:52:01,787
Scott: Oh, there you go.

655
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:07,125
Scott: Yeah We got game six and seven, but yeah, so number six.

656
00:52:07,186 --> 00:52:08,250
Scott: I'm working each wild struggle.

657
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:10,197
Scott: I'm not the biggest fan.

658
00:52:10,257 --> 00:52:12,568
Scott: Rym likes a little bit, but he doesn't like to play it.

659
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:14,962
Rym: But just if I wanted to be a video game.

660
00:52:15,284 --> 00:52:18,481
Rym: if I had free time I'd say we make it into a video game just so I could play it.

661
00:52:18,923 --> 00:52:19,164
Scott: Yeah.

662
00:52:19,627 --> 00:52:21,292
Scott: Oh well Definitely.

663
00:52:21,332 --> 00:52:25,190
Scott: I don't think I think it'd be worth it to buy this game and play it if it was cheaper.

664
00:52:26,572 --> 00:52:29,564
Rym: Yeah, I might be willing to sell it to anyone out there for like 45 or 50 bucks.

665
00:52:29,584 --> 00:52:32,858
Scott: Yeah It's in like almost perfect condition.

666
00:52:32,879 --> 00:52:33,662
Scott: We barely played it.

667
00:52:33,883 --> 00:52:35,450
Rym: It's pretty much in perfect condition.

668
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,180
Scott: Yeah, I mean the pieces are punched out and that's it.

669
00:52:38,501 --> 00:52:40,850
Rym: I think the Castro card has a little bit of a nick on it.
