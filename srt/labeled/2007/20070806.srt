1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,405
Scott: It's Monday, August 6th.

2
00:00:11,906 --> 00:00:12,528
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,754
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:18,959
Scott: Tonight, we teach you how to sniff the packets.

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,368
Rym: Let's do this!

6
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:36,090
Scott: So my old job, they made me take, I guess, in accordance with some sort of law, this sexual harassment test.

7
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:52,404
Scott: And basically all it does is it's a- it's a test you take online, and it gives you a bunch of information and it asks you ten questions to make sure you understand what is and what is not sexual harassment and what to do when you see sexual harassment, etc, etc, etc, right?

8
00:00:52,826 --> 00:01:07,362
Scott: And I don't know why, you know, I don't mind this test so much in principle, but why do they have a test for sexual harassment and not for any other sort of harassment or anything else that you can- you're not allowed to- you know, why don't they have a test for all the other things you're not supposed to do in the workplace?

9
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:08,387
Rym: Like smoke weed?

10
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:08,910
Scott: Yeah.

11
00:01:09,532 --> 00:01:12,380
Rym: I'll wager that it comes down to liability and nothing more.

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,644
Rym: They can say- Pretty much.

13
00:01:13,944 --> 00:01:18,804
Rym: If there's any sexual harassment going on in the company, they can say, "We trained all of our employees.

14
00:01:18,884 --> 00:01:19,608
Rym: We did our duty.

15
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:19,970
Scott: You came to

16
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,030
Scott: us.".

17
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,550
Scott: But what if- what if there's, I don't know, something else going on in the- in the company?

18
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:26,609
Scott: They don't have a training video for that.

19
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:31,150
Rym: I think most of those other things end up being criminal as opposed to just a civil lawsuit.

20
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,491
Rym: Yeah.

21
00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:35,890
Scott: But anyway, the one I took in my previous company was a very simple test.

22
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:45,542
Scott: It basically said this- it basically instructed you and just told you the company's policy straight up, you know, it's so that you couldn't interpret it on your own.

23
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:47,630
Scott: It told you the correct interpretation of it.

24
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,590
Rym: What could the policy be other than don't sexually harass people?

25
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,483
Scott: Well, it was stuff like, "Is it okay to ask someone on a

26
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:54,744
Scott: date?".

27
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:55,970
Scott: And the answer is yes.

28
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,624
Scott: And they're like, "Is it okay to ask someone on a date again after they said

29
00:01:59,684 --> 00:01:59,865
Scott: no?".

30
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:01,190
Scott: And the answer is no, you know?

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,134
Scott: So it's stuff like that.

32
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,520
Scott: It's like, "Can you kiss

33
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,083
Scott: someone?".

34
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:05,087
Scott: You know, "Can you hug

35
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:05,610
Scott: someone?".

36
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,259
Scott: You know, "What's okay and what's not

37
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:07,601
Scott: okay?".

38
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:09,190
Scott: It tells you where the line is, basically.

39
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:26,990
Rym: You know, it just- it always worries me that the fact that these sort of things are somewhat necessary means that there are people out there, people who are otherwise functioning in society, who don't know that, who can't understand that it's not okay to just, I don't know, randomly open mouth kiss some random person at work.

40
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,112
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

41
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:31,862
Scott: So, the one I took in my old company wasn't so bad.

42
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,850
Scott: It took me five minutes, and I got it all right.

43
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,057
Scott: And it was simple, and to the point.

44
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,890
Scott: So, the company I work for now didn't really have one set up.

45
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,549
Scott: So they, you know, they went online, and there's a bunch for them, you know, to choose from.

46
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,667
Scott: For, you know, they can- the company goes online, and they find a test, and they say, "Okay, we'll use this test for our

47
00:02:49,687 --> 00:02:50,088
Scott: employees.".

48
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:57,010
Scott: So I don't know what the hell one they fucking picked out, but it took, like, over two hours watching all these bullshit videos.

49
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:03,490
Scott: And not only that, but I had to take the test at the end two times, because the questions were bullshit answers.

50
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,257
Scott: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

51
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:08,430
Rym: So you, uh, you failed the sexual harassment test.

52
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,012
Scott: Okay, well, no, no.

53
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:09,756
Scott: You ready for this?

54
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:10,721
Scott: Okay, wait, wait, wait.

55
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,550
Scott: Okay, so it shows a video, right?

56
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,469
Scott: And it doesn't say anything about the video, it just shows a video of someone sexually harassing someone, right?

57
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,910
Rym: [laughter] - And then- - I just find that the idea of that funny.

58
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,070
Scott: Yeah, well, two actors pretending to sexually harass one, and the other one's the victim, I guess.

59
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:37,429
Scott: Anyway, then, it shows- the question on the screen says, "Which of these are prohibited by your company's sexual harassment

60
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:37,850
Scott: policy?".

61
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,231
Scott: Right?

62
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:44,250
Scott: And there's a list of choices, and all of them are prohibited by the company's sexual harassment policy.

63
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:50,690
Scott:  It's like, groping, uh, you know, unwa- you know, uh- - Surprise sodomy.

64
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,115
Scott: Yeah, stuff like that, right?

65
00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:56,210
Scott: So I'm like, I click "All," and it says, like, three of them are wrong.

66
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,750
Scott: And then a voice comes- whenever you get something wrong, a voice comes into your head and tells you, sort of, why you were wrong.

67
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:03,757
Scott: And he's like, "You were wrong.

68
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:05,906
Scott: The guy in the video did not do three of

69
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:06,368
Scott: those.".

70
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,759
Scott: And I'm like, "You didn't ask me what the guy in the video did.

71
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:13,168
Scott: You just said which of these are prohibited by the company's

72
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:13,670
Scott: policy.".

73
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:26,210
Rym: That seems to be a very large problem in society as a whole, that a lot of times when people want to test people, if you're smarter than the person who wrote the test, you end up getting things wrong because the person who wrote the test is stupid.

74
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,410
Scott: And that's exactly what happened to me, and I had to basically take it twice.

75
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:35,269
Rym: It's like that old question you had, I think, in elementary school about which one of these has the most friction, and one of them was an F1 car.

76
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,882
Scott: Yes, yes, okay, so, this is a great story.

77
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,370
Scott: I don't know if I've told it on the show before.

78
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,229
Rym: Whatever, tell it again.

79
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,639
Scott: In fourth grade, right, we were learning about friction, right?

80
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:47,730
Scott: Base- not, you know, coefficients of friction and such, but just, you know, friction.

81
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:53,050
Rym: Speaking of coefficients of friction, why did the cat fall off the slanted tin roof?

82
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:56,590
Scott: Uh, I know this joke, just tell the answer.

83
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,990
Rym: I'm not gonna tell the answer, just keep going.

84
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:06,470
Scott: Okay, alright, so, um, right, they were teaching us about friction, and they told us, you know, when things rub together, they get hot.

85
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,030
Scott: Certain things, when they, you know, rub together, it's what slows you down, et cetera, et cetera, right?

86
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,717
Scott: And they sort of told us, you know, they were teaching it.

87
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:25,046
Scott: so basically, you know, without going into any details at all, uh, you know, that basically they were teaching it wrong, 'cause it was so simplified.

88
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:26,510
Scott: So simplified it was incorrect.

89
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:40,450
Scott: And they told us, you know, ah, something that's all bumpy will have more friction, which I guess is, you know, in most cases, like a big bumpy thing, you know, like you put chains, you know, you put chains on your tire in the winter to get more friction, which is true.

90
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:51,270
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, smarter people or people who know more about physics know that, say, if you take metal and you polish it enough and it gets too smooth, it actually ends up having more friction.

91
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,170
Scott: Exactly.

92
00:05:52,631 --> 00:06:03,230
Scott: So, one of the questions in the book, the science book in fourth grade, when I was in fourth grade, I guess that must have been in 1980, who knows, I don't even know, right?

93
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,132
Scott: Maybe early 90s.

94
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:11,519
Scott: The question was, which of these two tires is better for a race car, right?

95
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:20,130
Scott: And obviously, they had told you already that more friction was better, which I didn't, you know, I didn't know back then I was in fourth grade, I wasn't that smarter than everyone else.

96
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,212
Scott: I said, okay, more friction is better.

97
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,434
Scott: Which of these two tires is more friction?

98
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:27,257
Scott: And there was a picture of a dirt bike tire.

99
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:29,880
Scott: And there was a picture of a race car tire.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,130
Scott: And I said, huh, I know from what I've been taught that the bumpier spoked dirt bike tire has more friction and therefore should be faster.

101
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:44,894
Scott: But I also know that race cars use race car tires.

102
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,516
Scott: This is a trick question.

103
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:48,578
Scott: And in fourth grade, this was my thinking, right?

104
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:53,042
Scott: But I was like, there must be some reason race cars use race car tires.

105
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:54,223
Scott: that I don't know.

106
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:56,065
Scott: I don't know how to make a race car.

107
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:57,766
Scott: I'm just a fourth grade kid.

108
00:06:58,087 --> 00:07:01,690
Scott: I'm going to pick the race car tire because I think this is some sort of trick question.

109
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,255
Scott: You know, the obvious answer, you know, according to what I've been taught in this class is the dirt bike tire.

110
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:10,078
Scott: But race cars use the race car tires.

111
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:10,839
Scott: That's what I'm picking.

112
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:12,080
Scott: That must be the right answer.

113
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:22,350
Scott: And now I'm smart enough in this day and age to realize because the race car tire heats up, it gets all sticky and a slick tire is awesome for going around a racetrack.

114
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,994
Rym: Normal coefficient of friction.

115
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:30,190
Rym: racing slicks when they're heated up properly are actually adhering themselves to the track like glue.

116
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:30,750
Scott: Yes.

117
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:34,596
Scott: So I was correct in choosing the race car tire.

118
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:36,619
Scott: I mean, you don't see race cars going around.

119
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:41,607
Scott: I mean, if dirt bike tires with bumpy bits on them were better, you'd see F1 cars using them.

120
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:43,550
Scott: You better bet your ass they would be using them.

121
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,535
Rym: That's the ticket next year.

122
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:45,521
Rym: We're going to have Schumacher.

123
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,245
Rym: He's going to be back.

124
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:47,110
Rym: He's going to have a dirt bike.

125
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,691
Scott: I'm sure.

126
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:49,654
Scott: So I chose that.

127
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:56,283
Scott: And of course, the teacher's manual disagreed with me and I complained and I didn't complain enough.

128
00:07:56,303 --> 00:08:01,190
Scott: I kind of wish I would have complained more and learned in fourth grade that sticky tires are awesome.

129
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:05,670
Scott: Instead of learning much later, like in 10th grade, that sticky tires were awesome.

130
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,830
Rym: Instead, all you really learned is that you were smarter than your educators.

131
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:12,376
Scott: And I'm smarter than the sexual harassment test at work.

132
00:08:12,736 --> 00:08:18,846
Scott: I don't feel bad because my other smart co-workers who are also smart had the same problem I did.

133
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:21,350
Scott: And I don't know what the stupid co-workers did.

134
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,030
Rym: So you're sure, absolutely sure, that you know how to not sexually harass someone at work?

135
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,410
Scott: I was about to sexually harass you, but someone would just put it on the gay evidence pile.

136
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:39,121
Rym: So anyway, in the news, a lot of our friends might have noticed and maybe some of you listeners that I'm not on AIM anymore.

137
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,730
Rym: In fact, I haven't been on instant messenger, you know, AOL instant messenger for a long time.

138
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,299
Rym: Part of that's because I don't spend a lot of time sitting in front of my computer anymore.

139
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,307
Rym: And part of that's just because I really don't like AIM.

140
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:51,210
Rym: I never have.

141
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,236
Rym: I've hated it from the moment I started using it.

142
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:58,290
Rym: And every day I was waiting for the time when I could just give it up and give the finger to everybody.

143
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,232
Rym: And you know what?

144
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:00,795
Rym: That day came a couple months ago.

145
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:08,230
Rym: And the reason is, I prefer Jabber or Google or some sort of open or semi-open or trustworthy network.

146
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:15,430
Rym: And the real issue here, a lot of people don't realize that when you use AOL instant messenger, you don't have control over anything.

147
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,814
Rym: They own your screen name.

148
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:19,302
Rym: All your chats go through their servers.

149
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:20,386
Rym: They can do whatever they want.

150
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:21,650
Rym: They can log everything you say.

151
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,810
Scott: Well, Google actually does log everything you say.

152
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,010
Rym: Oh yes, but the thing is, I want them to.

153
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,110
Scott: So it's not that much different.

154
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:33,750
Rym: I guess the real difference is theoretically you could use a Jabber server on your own, and no one could log it but you and the person you're talking to.

155
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,012
Scott: Yep, this is correct.

156
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:38,421
Scott: If we wanted to, I could point our DNS address.

157
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:40,887
Scott: See, before we were using our own Jabber server.

158
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,130
Scott: Separate, not using Google.

159
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,752
Scott: But it was a pain in the ass.

160
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:54,730
Scott: So I used, I pointed our DNS over at Google so that Google would now provide our Jabber server via Google Chat, which is much more convenient for us since we use Google for domains.

161
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:06,370
Scott: But if we needed to avoid Google and not have Google record our conversation, we could theoretically, actually not theoretically, very really, is that how it's said?

162
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:06,928
Rym: Ah, whatever.

163
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,490
Scott: Point our DNS back at our own Jabber server and avoid Google.

164
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,337
Rym: But besides all that, I just, I never trusted AOL.

165
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:18,130
Rym: I don't think any sane person who knows anything about the internet has ever trusted AOL.

166
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:20,374
Rym: I don't trust Microsoft either.

167
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:28,410
Rym: And a lot of our friends when we tried to push them toward Jabber or Google or anything other than AOL Instant Messenger, they'd always really resist or get angry.

168
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,253
Rym: Or, "Well fine, I just won't chat with you

169
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:30,674
Rym: anymore.".

170
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:33,220
Rym: And whenever we'd say, "Oh, but AOL could do bad

171
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:33,620
Rym: things."

172
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,527
Rym: They always say, "Oh, well they never will.

173
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:37,789
Rym: No one would ever do anything like

174
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:37,990
Rym: that.".

175
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,394
Rym: Well, MSN started doing that.

176
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:50,350
Rym: MSN currently, as far as it appears, and there seems to be a lot of evidence for this, is secretly censoring things that go through the MSN network.

177
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:55,403
Rym: So if you chat and say certain things to people, the messages just don't get sent.

178
00:10:55,423 --> 00:10:56,465
Rym: You don't get an error message.

179
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:58,030
Rym: The message just doesn't get there.

180
00:10:58,711 --> 00:10:59,035
Rym: Aha.

181
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,370
Scott: What kind of things are they censoring?

182
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:07,370
Rym: Well, right now it looks like they're mostly censoring things that might appear to be in some way a link to some sort of malware.

183
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:15,150
Rym: So if you send, for example, the string .info or .scr, your entire message will be blocked.

184
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:16,148
Rym: Uh huh.

185
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:19,627
Rym: Or gallery.php, profile.php.

186
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,470
Scott: But what if I'm linking you to my actual gallery or to my actual profile?

187
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,017
Rym: Oh, well the answer to that is simple.

188
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:26,661
Rym: Fuck you.

189
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:28,330
Rym: No, it's not getting through the network.

190
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:29,053
Scott: Huh.

191
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:30,177
Scott: Yeah.

192
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:33,690
Scott: Sounds like MSN is just the best IM network ever.

193
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,820
Rym: Granted, I have never known an intelligent person who used MSN.

194
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,530
Rym: I'm sure they're out there, but I've never personally known one.

195
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:47,530
Scott: The only people I've known to use MSN that had an excuse were basically people whose job it was to deal with lots of idiots all around.

196
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:56,490
Scott: So they would use Trillion or something like that and have shit work accounts on a bunch of IM networks just to communicate with these people for work purposes.

197
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:56,675
Scott: Ah.

198
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:02,910
Scott: But I've never known anyone who actually uses MSN with all their friends who was also cool and smart.

199
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:18,710
Rym: But what this really illustrates is the idea that instead of patching actual security holes in their operating systems or actually dealing with these problems, Microsoft decides that they know better than you and they just censor things without telling you to protect you from yourself.

200
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:26,089
Rym: Because remember, it's not like you could send someone text like blahblahblah.info and break into someone's computer through MSN.

201
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:34,830
Rym: The problem is someone might send a URL and the person on the other end might open that URL and then click yes to the dialog box that comes up.

202
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,269
Rym: And MSN decides that they're not willing to give you the opportunity to click on that box.

203
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,033
Scott: So awesome.

204
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:45,270
Scott: So, anyone out there who's using MSN, I don't know why.

205
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:46,689
Rym: Yeah, there's really no reason.

206
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:48,956
Scott: Google Chat exists now.

207
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:50,179
Scott: Jabber is free.

208
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:54,590
Scott: I mean, sure, your friends might not all be using it.

209
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,373
Rym: But you know what?

210
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:57,730
Rym: Google Chat interoperates with Jabber.

211
00:12:58,216 --> 00:12:58,547
Scott: Yeah, it does.

212
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,730
Rym: You can talk to anyone on Jabber through Google.

213
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:10,850
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I don't understand why people aren't, I mean, even if you're not ready to jump ship completely off AOL because you're not going to be able to talk to your family or something, right?

214
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:17,170
Scott: At least get an account on something else, Google Chat or Jabber or something and slowly migrate.

215
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,825
Scott: You don't have to jump all at once, but move away from it.

216
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:21,970
Scott: You know it's no good.

217
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,273
Scott: You know why?

218
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:27,210
Scott: I mean, you don't have to run away and just drop it, but slowly move out.

219
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:29,530
Scott: Sort of like we're supposed to be moving out of Iraq.

220
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,086
Rym: Yeah.

221
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,890
Rym: Honestly, I didn't care about this news that much because, like I said, no one really uses MSN, at least no one's smart.

222
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:47,270
Rym: But I'm not going back to AIM, so if anyone out there has been trying to get a hold of me on AIM and wondered how come I'm never online anymore, I don't even have an AIM client right now.

223
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:48,569
Rym: I'm done with that shit.

224
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:50,474
Scott: Awesome.

225
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:53,070
Scott: All right, I'm still using AIM, but I'm moving people out.

226
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,570
Rym: Well, I realized that the only people I talked to on AIM were my family.

227
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,250
Scott: Oh, and if you have a Gmail account, you have Google Chat, whether you know it or not.

228
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,945
Scott: You see that thing on the left-hand side that lets you chat with people?

229
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:03,670
Scott: That's Google Chat.

230
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:08,400
Scott: You can actually connect to that with an AIM client that supports Jabber.

231
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,250
Scott: You don't have to open a web browser and visit your Gmail to use that.

232
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:25,050
Rym: I just remember one day I looked at my AIM contact list, and I looked in the other hidden category of all the people I don't talk to, and I realized that there were like 400 people on that list, and I didn't know who any of them were.

233
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,925
Scott: Yeah, I cleaned out my AIM, and there was a whole mess of people.

234
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:28,650
Scott: I didn't know who they were.

235
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:34,855
Scott: There were also people that I really- And I was like, "Who are

236
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:35,056
Scott: you?".

237
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:37,065
Scott: And some of them were like, "I don't

238
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:37,306
Scott: know.".

239
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:37,909
Scott: I deleted them.

240
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:47,229
Rym: See, I learned not to do that, because the last time I tried to ask people who they were, I ended up having to talk to people I knew in high school, and it was mostly-

241
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,990
Scott: I knew that these people were mostly random internet people I talked to once, so it was safe.

242
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,850
Rym: Talking to people I went to high school with made me realize that most of the people I went to high school with didn't go anywhere.

243
00:14:57,556 --> 00:14:57,928
Scott: Pretty much.

244
00:14:58,491 --> 00:14:59,714
Rym: And lead kind of sad lives.

245
00:14:59,955 --> 00:15:05,930
Rym: And the rest of them were all nerds from DDR Freak who were trying to ask me at some point how to build a DDR pad.

246
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,490
Scott: Were they still DDR Freaks?

247
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:08,926
Scott: Yes.

248
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:09,458
Scott: Wow.

249
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,881
Rym: They're like, one of them was like, "Man, you never got back with

250
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:12,982
Rym: me.".

251
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:14,428
Rym: I'm like, "Dude, that was three years

252
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:14,729
Rym: ago.".

253
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:15,693
Scott: Wow.

254
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:16,536
Scott: Yeah.

255
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:18,030
Scott: I wouldn't even remember.

256
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,836
Rym: See, the moral of that story is simple.

257
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:24,826
Rym: If you ever thought, "Hey, I should post on the DDR Freaks forums," don't.

258
00:15:25,387 --> 00:15:25,848
Rym: Just don't.

259
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:26,510
Rym: Stay away.

260
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:27,969
Rym: Those people are weird.

261
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:29,610
Scott: Unless you're a super DDR Freak.

262
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,402
Rym: Even if you are, stay away.

263
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:32,369
Scott: Those people are weird.

264
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:34,009
Scott: Maybe you're weird.

265
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:37,130
Rym: You're probably not listening to GeekNights, then.

266
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:45,045
Scott: Alright, so Dell is offering the Ubuntu's on some of their machines, and it's getting pretty popular.

267
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:47,310
Scott: I don't know how well it's selling, but it's definitely good.

268
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:55,670
Scott: And if I had to purchase pre-built computers, I would very much now consider Dell just not having to pay the Windows tax is pretty big for me.

269
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:56,004
Scott: No.

270
00:15:57,251 --> 00:15:58,635
Scott: Anyway, and Dell isn't so bad.

271
00:15:58,655 --> 00:16:04,090
Scott: I mean, if you're a super nerd and you need the perfect machine, they're not going to give it for you at the right price.

272
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,230
Scott: But otherwise, not so bad, as they used to be, anyway.

273
00:16:08,911 --> 00:16:22,050
Scott: So, Lenovo, having to, I guess, compete on some level, decided, along with Novell, that they're going to sell Thinkpads, not any of their other stuff, but the Thinkpads with the SUSE Linux.

274
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:23,570
Rym: That's pretty hot.

275
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,546
Scott: The enterprise desktop, because apparently a lot of, because that is a business laptop.

276
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:29,750
Scott: You don't see the Thinkpad.

277
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,050
Scott: If you go to the Lenovo website, it says consumer business.

278
00:16:33,251 --> 00:16:39,870
Scott: And while nerds might realize that if you want a quality laptop, you click on business even if you're just a schmuck at home and they'll still sell you something.

279
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,990
Scott: Consumers will always click on consumer and get a piece of shit laptop.

280
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,950
Scott: But businesses will click on business.

281
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,316
Scott: And apparently, businesses want Linux.

282
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:55,010
Scott: And the best Linux that's aimed at businesses is SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop.

283
00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:01,750
Scott: And they're going to sell Thinkpads that have Sled, that's S-L-E-D, Sled, pre-installed.

284
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,829
Rym: See, I find this interesting because, remember, Lenovo used to be part of IBM.

285
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,069
Rym: And then that whole wing was sold.

286
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:15,550
Rym: And actually, up until when I left IBM, the companies were, while they were technically separate, they were still effectively together.

287
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:20,210
Rym: We had internal people from both sides and it was this big kind of mishmash.

288
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:28,730
Rym: I'm not sure how far apart they finally pulled, but back then there was an official IBM Red Hat Enterprise Linux that we used on all the laptops.

289
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:30,496
Rym: And it was the official one.

290
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,050
Rym: And that was what you used if you wanted to have Linux on a Thinkpad.

291
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:37,410
Rym: I'm really surprised that Lenovo went with a non-Red Hat solution.

292
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:47,449
Scott: Yeah, I'm thinking, it seems like there's this whole bunch of companies, IBM, Lenovo, Novell, Xandros, sort of.

293
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:54,290
Scott: It's like a separate corner from the Microsoft, Apple, Google corner, you know, of technology.

294
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,330
Scott: Sort of like the old guard, in a way.

295
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,270
Rym: Like if you go to one of those weird companies that has Novell anything.

296
00:18:00,594 --> 00:18:01,664
Scott: Like the company I work for.

297
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,232
Scott: Oh, Sun also.

298
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:11,110
Scott: Why doesn't this old, like everyone always talks about, you know, some of the new guard companies, Microsoft, Google, like buying up Sun or something like that, right?

299
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:25,310
Scott: I always wondered why doesn't IBM, Sun, you know, Novell merge to sort of become up, you know, to get up and compete with these new guys who are all big and in the business as opposed to sitting on their, you know, in the darkness.

300
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:37,030
Rym: I think part of the reason is they either all compete with each other directly with equivalent products or compete in such different and varied markets that there's really, the overlap just doesn't exist for them to make any business sense.

301
00:18:37,391 --> 00:18:38,010
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

302
00:18:38,411 --> 00:18:44,250
Rym: Like IBM merging with another company doesn't make much sense because IBM has its hands in a whole bunch of different pots.

303
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:54,650
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, look, Google and Microsoft, at least they don't merge, but they buy up companies that do things they do because maybe those companies do something better, you know.

304
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:59,950
Rym: I think IBM internally is convinced that no one does anything it does better than it.

305
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,549
Scott: That's why they're, you know, just so hip and cool and everyone loves IBM.

306
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,350
Scott: You know what?

307
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,945
Scott: IBM is selling this awesome new phone that people are willing to pay $700 for.

308
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:10,690
Rym: The thing is, remember, that's not IBM's market.

309
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:23,610
Rym: IBM's market is this whole, I mean, a lot of people out there, a lot of our friends work in IT or CS and whatever, but you always hear the buzzword enterprise and how like there's this whole different world and all the software is different and everything's weird.

310
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:27,690
Rym: And a lot of people are refreshing into college think, oh, that word enterprise is just bullshit.

311
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,590
Rym: It's not any different.

312
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,289
Rym: That's just an excuse to sell people more expensive things.

313
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:45,930
Rym: And while that is true, about 75 percent of the time, the fact remains that just because of the sheer scale of it, that whole market is like this this unchartable, unfathomable, stupid world that you don't want to ever get involved in.

314
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:47,749
Scott: Yep, yep, yep, yep.

315
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:52,550
Scott: So, yeah, you can now get a ThinkPad with Linux if you are savvy, I guess.

316
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,030
Scott: I don't know.

317
00:19:53,411 --> 00:20:04,230
Rym: I find it funny, too, that the company I work for now and other companies I've interacted with, they either don't know what Linux is or they still brush it and Google and all these things off as just flash in the pan crap.

318
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,450
Rym: And they talk about how Novell is the future or Windows architecture.

319
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:09,649
Scott: Novell is all Linux-y, though.

320
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,810
Rym: No, but Novell Windows is the future.

321
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:17,070
Rym: And they're actually worried about the fact that Novell is kind of dropping away from this Windows boat.

322
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,830
Scott: What the hell are these guys?

323
00:20:19,413 --> 00:20:20,070
Scott: Even better, I don't know.

324
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:21,050
Scott: Do these guys use computers?

325
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:22,748
Rym: Mostly, no.

326
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:24,630
Scott: Do they use, like, telephones?

327
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:42,230
Rym: Even worse, I really don't get all these people in companies who... The company will use Novell to do their networky stuff in a Windows network when every single thing that they're using it for was already done natively by Active Directory that they already paid for because they already have Windows.

328
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:43,710
Scott: What are they doing?

329
00:20:44,154 --> 00:20:44,606
Scott: I don't know.

330
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:46,450
Scott: I don't know.

331
00:20:47,255 --> 00:20:48,890
Rym: I really hate being in IT sometimes.

332
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:55,290
Scott: Basically, I think a lot of that kind of stuff actually is because you have a guy who knows nothing about IT, right?

333
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,109
Scott: A vendor from Novell comes in and says, "Hey, stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff,

334
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:00,350
Scott: stuff.".

335
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,363
Scott: And the guy says, "Well, what did this do for me?

336
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:03,149
Scott: Why is it worth my

337
00:21:03,189 --> 00:21:03,370
Scott: money?".

338
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,809
Scott: And the guy says, "Well, it does this, it does this, it does this, it does this, it does

339
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:06,930
Scott: this.".

340
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:08,888
Scott: And those are all things he needs to do.

341
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,210
Scott: And he doesn't realize that Windows does that already on its own.

342
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:15,070
Scott: And he's sold because he needs something that does that.

343
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,390
Rym: I think it's far simpler than that.

344
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,909
Rym: I think it's just the sunk cost fallacy.

345
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:26,830
Rym: They already went into that boat for whatever reason, and now they can't justify the expense of getting out of the boat, and they can't justify the loss of all the capital they've sunk in that boat.

346
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:28,530
Rym: And thus, the boat sinks.

347
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,150
Scott: That is the case for people who haven't done it yet, but I'm talking about the initial doing.

348
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,528
Rym: I don't know if anyone new does it.

349
00:21:34,452 --> 00:21:36,790
Rym: It might just be all these old stupid companies.

350
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:38,610
Scott: I think that new people do do it.

351
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:40,409
Rym: I just can't fathom that.

352
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,629
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

353
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:42,948
Scott: Okay, so.

354
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:51,449
Rym: Things of the day.

355
00:21:52,173 --> 00:22:05,585
Rym: Alright, so on the Bacon Report, there's a video from Fox News, and this video is basically a Fox News reporter lending a lot of credence to the idea that "OMG aliens, government conspiracy, blah blah

356
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:05,927
Rym: blah.".

357
00:22:08,218 --> 00:22:09,509
Scott: You know, I realized something today.

358
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,330
Scott: There was actually a picture on the net today.

359
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:23,170
Scott: It was a really blurry picture of what appeared to be a new iMac, because I think you may know that Apple is supposedly coming out with new iMacs soon, right?

360
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,410
Rym: Alright, I have a new idea.

361
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:37,010
Rym: The next time we think Apple's going to announce a product, let's take a black piece of cardboard, make it real shiny with some lacquer, put some LEDs in it, move it around, and take a really blurry picture of it.

362
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,249
Scott: We can just take a normal picture and apply a blurry filter to it.

363
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,030
Scott: But the point is that it seems like, obviously, this is not real.

364
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,150
Scott: The thing that the Apple iMac this person posted a picture of was not true.

365
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:49,010
Scott: It was a hoax, right?

366
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,130
Scott: But by making the picture blurry, right?

367
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,467
Scott: It sort of gave the viewer, like even me, for the first second.

368
00:22:56,507 --> 00:23:02,550
Scott: when I looked at it, my initial reaction was it was a covert picture taken with a cell cam, right?

369
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:03,528
Scott: Or something like that.

370
00:23:04,012 --> 00:23:12,310
Scott: And it sort of gives it validity in a way that it's blurry, when the reality is it's blurry because it was hoaxed and they're covering up their poor Photoshop job.

371
00:23:12,772 --> 00:23:16,210
Scott: So the alien pictures are always blurry.

372
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,290
Rym: Now here's the thing that I find interesting.

373
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,988
Rym: One, when I was a little kid, I did believe that there were UFOs in town.

374
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,069
Rym: I also did.

375
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:29,570
Rym: Now the reason is I'd sit there at night at my grandma's house reading Fate magazine because she had a bunch of them lying around.

376
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,350
Scott: I read a bunch of crazy crap and I saw a bunch of crazy crap on TV.

377
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,250
Rym: And on TV all the time on Unsolved Mysteries.

378
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,110
Scott: And various other shows.

379
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,590
Rym: Unsolved Mysteries alone, that show probably tainted my childhood.

380
00:23:42,475 --> 00:23:43,446
Rym: That show just messed me up.

381
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:48,710
Scott: Yeah, I'm glad I'm corrected and I still don't believe that show.

382
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,190
Scott: But think about it, when we were kids watching that, adults are watching that, believing it too.

383
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:58,130
Rym: I know, but when I was a kid, you know, it'd always be like, there was a serial killer and he killed a bunch of kids.

384
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:03,870
Scott: This one that really scared me was like, there was a hotel and George Washington's ghost is there and he kills people.

385
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,267
Rym: He's coming, he's coming, he's coming.

386
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:12,070
Rym: But I used to believe, because why would the TV lie?

387
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,350
Rym: Why would this man, who looks very intelligent on the TV, talking about this?

388
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,370
Rym: I mean, look, he's got evidence.

389
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:20,849
Rym: Look at all these blurry photos that people took.

390
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,875
Rym: Now, how come?

391
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:27,070
Rym: in the last 50 years no one's ever taken a single non-blurry photo of a UFO?

392
00:24:27,571 --> 00:24:28,930
Scott: We have HD cameras.

393
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:34,490
Scott: My digital camera is like, what, six or five to seven megapixels?

394
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,330
Scott: I don't even remember how many megapixels there is.

395
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:41,490
Rym: And I saw a seaplane flying over the Hudson and I went, oh, cool.

396
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,890
Rym: And I went and snapped and took a picture of, you know what?

397
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,108
Scott: With your cell cam?

398
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,750
Rym: With my cell cam while I was hanging from a cliff.

399
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:48,878
Rym: And you know what?

400
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:50,330
Rym: It came out fine.

401
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:52,330
Rym: You can see that it's a biplane.

402
00:24:52,831 --> 00:24:55,390
Rym: Maybe if I applied a Gaussian filter, I could say it was a UFO.

403
00:24:56,101 --> 00:24:56,310
Rym: Yeah.

404
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,210
Rym: With wings and a propeller and seaplane legs.

405
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:10,170
Scott: So, what it comes down to is people are taking blurry pictures these days and they're somehow believing them and they're still believing them.

406
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:16,610
Scott: And I think all we need to do to clear up this alien UFO bullshit, because there are no aliens and there are no UFOs visiting Earth.

407
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,737
Scott: Well, yeah, odds are.

408
00:25:18,777 --> 00:25:24,530
Rym: there's probably some form of life of some kind, whatever you might define life out there in the universe somewhere.

409
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:30,030
Scott: Some sort of biological, possibly carbon-based organism out in the universe somewhere.

410
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,210
Scott: Whatever, besides Earth.

411
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,230
Rym: Some sort of self-organizing system.

412
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:33,617
Rym: Yes.

413
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:40,229
Rym: However, there are not little green men in saucers coming to Earth and abducting cows to implant into people or whatever they do.

414
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,750
Scott: No, there most definitely are not.

415
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,709
Rym: Now, I mean, the people who believe these things just...

416
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:47,789
Scott: Crazy hicks.

417
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,890
Rym: Yeah, but that's not the problem.

418
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:57,930
Rym: The fact that a news station, not even Unsolved Mysteries, which, while it acted like it was serious, it wasn't really serious.

419
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,509
Rym: This is the news!

420
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:04,570
Rym: The news should not just be giving any sort of airtime to these nutjobs.

421
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,230
Rym: And let me tell you, the guy that they interview on this is quite a nutjob.

422
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,409
Scott: Super nutjob.

423
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:21,610
Rym: However, to Fox's credit, the guy who is interviewing him, while he definitely played the sensationalist bullshit card and definitely lent a lot more credulity to this man than he deserved.

424
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,008
Scott: Credence.

425
00:26:22,651 --> 00:26:23,730
Rym: I wanted to say credulity.

426
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:24,270
Rym: Well, you're right.

427
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,529
Rym: Because I already said credence before.

428
00:26:25,812 --> 00:26:26,250
Scott: That's fine.

429
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,390
Scott: He was very credulous.

430
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:27,870
Rym: Yeah.

431
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:29,489
Rym: And credulity is a word.

432
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,249
Scott: No, it's not.

433
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:30,704
Scott: Yes, it is.

434
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:33,289
Scott: I guess it's a cromulent word.

435
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,430
Rym: It is perfectly cromulent.

436
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,830
Rym: Anyway, there is one moment where this guy... The Fox News guy must know that this is bullshit.

437
00:26:40,991 --> 00:26:41,868
Rym: He's just doing his job.

438
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:48,050
Rym: Because after the crazy guy goes on this long rant about how the governments are covering it up, and they're going to release, and blah, blah, blah.

439
00:26:49,712 --> 00:26:54,129
Rym: The Fox guy has this smirk that he had for just a second, and then he quashes it out.

440
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,086
Rym: And then he asks, trying not to laugh, "So, uh, how do we know

441
00:26:58,126 --> 00:26:58,268
Rym: this?".

442
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:03,010
Rym: And the crazy guy stops for a second and basically says nothing.

443
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:03,750
Rym: Yep.

444
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,109
Rym: He basically says, "Well, if you pay attention like I do, you just, you know.

445
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:08,589
Rym: It's all out there.

446
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:09,465
Rym: You just got to pay

447
00:27:09,485 --> 00:27:09,670
Rym: attention.".

448
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:23,170
Scott: I think what we need to do is we need to make a law that... Well, first of all, we need to make a law that says if you're going to put a camera on any flying thing, a helicopter, a plane, whatever, it better be a damn super awesome HD camera.

449
00:27:23,532 --> 00:27:27,369
Scott: that won't be, like, and if something is bright, because it's always a bright light.

450
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:33,530
Scott: It has to have that, you know, auto-dimming kind of thing where you can still see what it is, even if it's got a bright light on it, right?

451
00:27:34,313 --> 00:27:35,670
Scott: My old cell phone had that.

452
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:42,350
Scott: You'd shine it at, like, your lamp, and it would be bright for a second, and then it would get dim, and you could actually take a picture of the light bulb pointing the camera at it.

453
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,190
Scott: So if my old cell phone can have that, so can the cameras on a 747.

454
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,148
Rym: You know why this wouldn't work?

455
00:27:48,671 --> 00:27:57,426
Rym: Because then, when we have a million pictures of car headlights and stars and gas balloons and whatever, all the alien nudge-obs are just going to say, "Well, you haven't taken pictures of any

456
00:27:57,487 --> 00:27:57,609
Rym: aliens.".

457
00:27:57,771 --> 00:27:59,649
Scott: And that is why I have a second plan.

458
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:10,950
Scott: The second plan is we get together a collection, and we purchase the highest quality digital SLR cameras on the market, the Nikon, D80, whatever they are, right?

459
00:28:11,372 --> 00:28:15,010
Scott: And we donate them to all the big UFOlogist people.

460
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,470
Scott: Just donate them to them.

461
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,350
Rym: You know what'll happen?

462
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,389
Rym: They're just going to take blurry photos.

463
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:34,430
Rym: [laughter] I mean, these people are either scammers or a little bit brighter than the people who get a picture of a dust mote floating in the flash and think it's a ghost.

464
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,169
Rym: Or, sorry, sorry, a psychic orb.

465
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:38,742
Scott: Okay, so...

466
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,950
Rym: But that's not my thing of the day.

467
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:42,150
Scott: Oh, my God.

468
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,310
Rym: My thing of the day is the bacon report because it has the best sight design I've ever seen.

469
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:56,206
Rym: There's a permanent graphic on the right that is a picture of bacon, and on the top, the text is "nom nom nom," and on the bottom of it, it is "om nom nom

470
00:28:56,307 --> 00:28:56,528
Rym: nom."

471
00:28:57,834 --> 00:29:01,250
Rym: And at the bottom of the site, there's a permanent graphic of a suitcase made of bacon.

472
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:03,828
Rym: That is my thing of the day.

473
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,110
Rym: All right.

474
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,910
Rym: Irrespective of what happens to be on the site to which I am linking.

475
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:10,250
Scott: Um, nom nom.

476
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,690
Rym: Nom nom nom nom.

477
00:29:11,772 --> 00:29:12,610
Scott: Nom nom nom nom.

478
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:13,550
Rym: I kind of want some bacon.

479
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:16,747
Scott: I don't really want any bacon, but I guess if you want bacon...

480
00:29:17,351 --> 00:29:19,230
Rym: Well, we let that Stu Leonard's bacon go bad.

481
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:20,990
Rym: We only ate two of the three packages.

482
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,370
Scott: Oh, two out of the three is not bad.

483
00:29:23,632 --> 00:29:24,729
Scott: Only one package going bad.

484
00:29:25,673 --> 00:29:26,869
Scott: Next time, I'll only buy two packages.

485
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,730
Scott: All right, check this out.

486
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,569
Scott: It's real simple.

487
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,189
Scott: I'm checking it.

488
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,529
Scott: It's a real simple thing of the day.

489
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:35,756
Scott: You remember what the Internet was like in, say, 1997?

490
00:29:35,756 --> 00:29:36,030
Rym: Awesome.

491
00:29:36,173 --> 00:29:36,949
Rym: There were no ads.

492
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:40,529
Rym: Every website was functional, unless you went to Geocities.

493
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:41,264
Scott: Right.

494
00:29:41,811 --> 00:29:43,009
Scott: You know what Dig is like right now?

495
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:44,088
Rym: Yeah, I do.

496
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,292
Scott: All right, imagine if Dig was in 1997.

497
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:47,726
Rym: You know what?

498
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,289
Rym: Functionality wouldn't really be diminished.

499
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:54,750
Scott: No, so here is a Photoshop I get, or it's probably not a Photoshop.

500
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,010
Scott: A guy, I think, did this with HTML, which wouldn't be too hard.

501
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,543
Scott: I could do it.

502
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:00,330
Scott: And then took a screenshot of it.

503
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,310
Rym: I'll bet he used tables.

504
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:02,250
Scott: Yeah, there are tables.

505
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:08,150
Scott: And he basically made a mock-up of what Dig would have looked like in 1997, complete with hilarious headlines.

506
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:22,610
Rym: You know, it says a lot that while Dig looks a lot... I mean, now we have, like, Ajax and things, and we can do fancy stuff, and while the faster computers and faster network did make even if a site is functionally good, it can be functionally good and pretty at the same time.

507
00:30:22,731 --> 00:30:29,828
Scott: I would read some of these headlines, but now that I think about which ones to read, it would be hard to resist reading all of them, so you can read them on your own.

508
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:30,928
Scott: But think about this.

509
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:39,450
Rym: The fact that while websites have gotten better looking, the most functional websites are still the websites from 1997.

510
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,330
Rym: Text links.

511
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,330
Scott: And Google.

512
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,127
Rym: And Google.

513
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,110
Rym: Granted, Google hasn't changed much, pretty much ever.

514
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:46,750
Scott: Nope, nope, not really.

515
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,310
Scott: But they're not as old as 1996.

516
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:56,949
Rym: Man, there was a time when Yahoo-- I used Yahoo because their little search site where you had the little thing you typed the stuff in looked a lot like Google does now.

517
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,929
Rym: It was kind of empty, and it just worked.

518
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:06,609
Scott: Yeah, I used to use Alta Vista and Web-- I used to use WebCrawler a lot because their website was really slick, but their search results were kind of bad.

519
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:14,229
Rym: Yeah, thing is, though, when I think back, it's hard to imagine actually using anything but Google, even back before I knew Google existed, even back before Google did exist.

520
00:31:14,774 --> 00:31:21,250
Scott: Well, I think what it was is that Google was-- Yahoo worked in the olden days because it was a manually set up directory.

521
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,550
Rym: And there weren't that many websites.

522
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:28,748
Scott: And there weren't that many websites, so-- Remember all those-- Yahoo never gave you 404 links or anything like that, even though it did.

523
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:29,668
Rym: All the time.

524
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:36,310
Scott: Yes, but it was vastly superior to the other sort of automatic spidered search engines.

525
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:41,287
Rym: I mean, that was a time when you could go to-- Well, I don't even know if Borders and Barnes & Noble were like they are now back then.

526
00:31:41,855 --> 00:31:45,590
Rym: But you go to a bookstore, and they'd have yellow pages of the Internet.

527
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,948
Rym: And they'd list a good percentage of the websites out there.

528
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:50,629
Scott: I think that's enough of that.

529
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,910
Scott: We could do a whole show on old search engines.

530
00:31:54,632 --> 00:31:54,906
Rym: Uh-huh.

531
00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:07,270
Rym: Right, anyway, so tonight, we haven't done any of those how computers work or explained it in a while, and we realized that one thing we haven't talked about that I know a lot of you are interested in is very simply packet sniffing or packet capturing.

532
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,248
Scott: All right, do you remember back when you were talking about some networking, I forget which show it was.

533
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,031
Rym: We

534
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:30,030
Scott: talked about how when you're trying to send packets, right, especially to people on the exact same LAN as you, right, you're basically sending the packets to everyone, but only the people who have the correct IP or MAC address pay attention to those packets, and everyone else ignores them.

535
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:55,217
Scott: So if Rym has MAC address 1, and I have MAC address 2, and Joe Bob has MAC address 3, and I want to send something to Rym, I go, I send the packets out, and they go to everyone, Joe Bob, Rym, Mary Sue, everyone gets the packets, but because the packet says, "I am for MAC address 1," which is Rym, Rym is the only one who actually gets it, and everyone else's network card says, "Get the hell out of here.

536
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:56,284
Scott: You're not my number.

537
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:56,687
Scott: Stay

538
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:56,990
Scott: away.".

539
00:32:57,432 --> 00:33:03,030
Scott: And that way, you feel like you're sending packets to one person when you're actually sending them to everyone.

540
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:16,070
Rym: Now, the way that worked, I think we talked about it briefly, was just that the destination address is just a bunch of 1s and 0s, and those 1s and 0s are converted into electricity via the Manchester encoding mechanism and sent out to the whole place.

541
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:28,948
Rym: They're sent out on every wire, and every network card gets them, turns them into 1s and 0s, does some binary math with its own address, and if they match, then it passes the packet on to higher-level stuff, and if it doesn't match, it ignores it.

542
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,990
Rym: Now, you might be thinking, "What if I were evil?

543
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:36,628
Rym: What if I made a special network card that accepted any

544
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:37,010
Rym: packet?".

545
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,434
Scott: Guess what?

546
00:33:38,978 --> 00:33:40,370
Scott: Every network card can do that.

547
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:41,710
Rym: Well, well, well, not really.

548
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,230
Scott: I've never met a network card that couldn't.

549
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:52,170
Rym: Not so much nowadays, but back in the day, especially with Token Ring, but also with Ethernet, see, the issue is, it's called promiscuous mode.

550
00:33:52,570 --> 00:34:00,570
Rym: Normally, a network card is in non-promiscuous mode, where it only sees packets that are directly addressed to it or a broadcast, and otherwise, it can't see anything, can't do anything.

551
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,308
Rym: Your computer can't even tell you that a packet came in.

552
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:09,109
Rym: If a network card is in promiscuous mode, it'll see every single packet on the network, no matter what.

553
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:14,750
Rym: Back in the Token Ring days, network cards could always, by default, go into promiscuous mode.

554
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:21,050
Rym: Many of them were physically disabled from being able to do so for security reasons before they were shipped to consumers.

555
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:22,610
Scott: Well, that's Token Ring, though.

556
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:24,650
Rym: It works in the same principle.

557
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:25,327
Scott: I know, I know.

558
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:37,429
Rym: And also, there were network cards that, whenever they went into promiscuous mode, would, by some mechanism, send out packets or something to warn the network that, "Hey, I'm listening, I'm listening,".

559
00:34:37,931 --> 00:34:44,349
Rym: and a lot of intelligent networking equipment back in the day would see that and say, "Hey, hey, hey," and immediately shut down that link.

560
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:49,688
Rym: However, such things are much rarer now than they used to be.

561
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:57,810
Scott: Basically, nowadays, if you have a network card, you can put it in promiscuous mode with the right software and see the packets, and no one will know.

562
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,350
Rym: Now, think about how trivial this is.

563
00:34:59,471 --> 00:35:06,850
Rym: All the packets go to everyone, so basically, on any given LAN, barring anything like switches, I can look at the traffic everyone's got.

564
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:20,510
Scott: So if you go to a LAN party and they bring a hub, not a switch, a hub, it has to be a hub, and it's like a 50-port hub and everyone plugs into it, and you open up your packet sniffer, you can see everything everyone's doing.

565
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:26,730
Scott: So let's say someone logs into their email and they didn't encrypt their email password.

566
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:27,542
Rym: Via, say, SSL.

567
00:35:28,555 --> 00:35:30,650
Scott: You just saw their email password.

568
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:31,908
Rym: It's just right in there.

569
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:32,515
Scott: It's there.

570
00:35:32,535 --> 00:35:33,450
Scott: It's in plain text.

571
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,989
Scott: You can see it with your eyeballs.

572
00:35:35,632 --> 00:35:39,010
Scott: If I showed you how this works, it's so stupidly easy.

573
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,906
Scott: If you have the software installed, you literally push a button, and there it is.

574
00:35:45,111 --> 00:35:47,190
Scott: Oh, look, email, password, username.

575
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:47,777
Scott: There it is.

576
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,488
Scott: Oh, look at that.

577
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:53,169
Scott: And then you could go and log in and read their email, and there's nothing stopping you.

578
00:35:53,470 --> 00:36:11,750
Rym: Now, there was a time when this was a significant security risk for networks because there was a time when Ethernet was all hub-based, and in fact, generally, all Ethernet networks and companies and wherever were one gigantic broadcast domain, meaning every packet went to everyone on the network no matter what.

579
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:18,950
Scott: So you had, say, 1,000 computers, and if you turned on your packet sniffer, you'd probably crash your computer because there's just so many goddamn packets.

580
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:29,110
Rym: See, the thing is you wouldn't because we had some packet sniffers that were "portable" at IBM that we used just because we had them, and we didn't have any good laptops laying around to use for this purpose.

581
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:32,969
Rym: They were bigger than my current PC.

582
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,270
Rym: They weighed about 90 pounds.

583
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,483
Rym: I think they were 286s.

584
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:38,287
Rym: Oh, wow.

585
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,690
Rym: They had these displays.

586
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,970
Rym: They were kind of like an old gas plasma in theory.

587
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,129
Rym: I don't even know how they worked, but they were orange and weird.

588
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:54,309
Rym: And basically, they ran a special version of DOS that had a packet sniffer on it, and you put gigantic network cards in it, and you could sniff networks.

589
00:36:54,997 --> 00:36:56,190
Scott: Yeah, but with special hardware.

590
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:08,249
Scott: I mean, if you took a normal consumer 286, and you ran the equivalent of some packet-sniffing software on it on a network of 1,000 computers, your RAMs would be the full very soon.

591
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,750
Rym: But then again, there wasn't generally that much traffic on those networks.

592
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,330
Rym: That is true.

593
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,290
Rym: Those networks were generally slow and full of collisions.

594
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,890
Scott: Yeah, but it would be pretty bad.

595
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,349
Scott: Much worse than it would be today.

596
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:25,830
Rym: But also along those lines, the security threat was mostly that a lot of software was poorly written, and people didn't worry about security.

597
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,810
Rym: Everything was in clear text, and passwords were just on the network all the time.

598
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,310
Scott: Well, because no one had the CPU power to encrypt.

599
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:43,290
Scott: I mean, even if you were smart enough to write your software securely that encrypted all the outgoing traffic, the CPU, it would take you like five minutes to send a part of an email.

600
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,150
Scott: It would be ridiculous.

601
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:48,822
Scott: And not only that, but let's say you were even smarter, and you said, "Let's switch the

602
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:49,186
Scott: network.".

603
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:51,470
Scott: You couldn't afford switches in those days.

604
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:55,850
Rym: Well, basically the best you had were there were bridges, which were kind of like a switch with only two ends.

605
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:02,730
Rym: And you'd stick them between big boundaries of the network to try and partition the network and block some of that unneeded traffic.

606
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,310
Rym: But even then, you could get a lot of passwords.

607
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:10,345
Scott: Yeah, I mean, even if you put a bridge on like every office, you've got like 100 people in your office on 250 port hubs.

608
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:11,873
Scott: That's it.

609
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:14,670
Scott: It's enough to get a lot of sensitive information.

610
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:20,510
Rym: Now, a lot of people tried to come up with ways to detect sniffing and somehow eliminate it.

611
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:24,209
Rym: Because, like I said, a lot of network cards would warn the network that they were in promiscuous mode.

612
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:29,529
Rym: It wasn't that hard to make a network card that just didn't warn the network back then.

613
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:30,354
Scott: You know what?

614
00:38:30,415 --> 00:38:33,250
Scott: If you get a network card now, it probably doesn't warn the network.

615
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,517
Rym: Well, usually not.

616
00:38:34,941 --> 00:38:35,930
Rym: Almost never, in fact.

617
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:47,310
Rym: But even back then, with physical means, you could make devices that could listen to the network but physically could not transmit on the network, or software-wise just knew not to ever send stuff out.

618
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,470
Scott: Yeah, I mean, think about it.

619
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:55,429
Scott: When you look at the network cable, right, some of those pins are the in-pins that get the data, and some of those pins are the out-pins.

620
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:00,910
Scott: What if I just made a network cable that didn't have the out-pins, and I plugged it in, and I went in promiscuous mode?

621
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,550
Scott: Now I can see everything, and no one knows I'm there.

622
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:07,690
Rym: The thing is, that only worked with the old, you know, the T-connector kind of Ethernet networks.

623
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:12,730
Rym: Because with Ethernet as we use it now, the link light wouldn't come on, and you wouldn't get any connection at all.

624
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,417
Rym: I know.

625
00:39:13,498 --> 00:39:14,050
Scott: I'm just saying.

626
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:18,429
Rym: There are ways to do it, but it requires somewhat complicated and intelligent electronics.

627
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:26,737
Rym: Now I'm not going to get into the really interesting parts, because they're kind of esoteric, but the point is, if you've ever wondered what packet sniffing was, that's it.

628
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:27,550
Rym: It's really that simple.

629
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:43,550
Rym: Nowadays, it's really not useful from a hacker, cracker, whatever, get people's passwords perspective, because one, networks are almost always fully switched, and two, you really don't have access to large broadcast domains or anything these days.

630
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:50,070
Scott: Yes, if you wanted to sniff someone for, you know, bad purposes these days, it's quite difficult.

631
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:53,590
Scott: For example, at our house, we have switches and we have a router.

632
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:57,570
Scott: So basically, if you sniff, you'll see your own traffic.

633
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,710
Scott: You won't see anyone else's traffic whatsoever.

634
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,749
Rym: Well, you'll see all the broadcast traffic on the network, which can tell you a lot.

635
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:04,260
Scott: Yep.

636
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:16,070
Rym: Because, for example, even if something like two computers are talking to each other on a dedicated switch link separate, and the same network, the initial package they send, the ARPs to figure out who's where, are broadcast.

637
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:24,290
Rym: So I can compile a database of which PCs are where and who has what IP addresses and all sorts of fun information, even though I don't see the actual traffic that's being sent.

638
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:37,689
Scott: Another thing you could do, let's say if you can compromise the physical security, you could say get a hub, go to where the router is, plug your hub in there, and then sniff on that end, and that, you know, that won't be as, it won't be the same.

639
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:38,667
Rym: That wouldn't really work.

640
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:41,890
Scott: It would help, you could see all the stuff that's going in and out of the network.

641
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,150
Scott: You just couldn't see, like, you know, who's it going to if you're on the other side of a net.

642
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:59,030
Rym: Well, there's more trouble than that, because the moment you introduce a hub, I don't want to get into all the technical details, but basically hubs eliminate the idea of full duplex, which is trivially detectable and will cause an immediate degradation in performance.

643
00:40:59,150 --> 00:40:59,930
Rym: You'll be caught immediately.

644
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:04,130
Scott: Yeah, but I'm just saying, it would be a way that you could sniff a whole bunch of action.

645
00:41:04,373 --> 00:41:04,849
Scott: Not really.

646
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:09,370
Rym: A much better way would be to compromise the switch of the router, and then replicate a port.

647
00:41:09,411 --> 00:41:09,970
Scott: That's not easy.

648
00:41:11,154 --> 00:41:12,190
Rym: It's a lot easier than you think.

649
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,650
Rym: A lot of people use default passwords.

650
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:15,510
Scott: Yeah, it's still not easy.

651
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:15,825
Scott: Anyway.

652
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,468
Rym: It's much easier than physically compromising it and installing a hub.

653
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:21,410
Scott: Not if you're at some LAN party and you're sneaky.

654
00:41:21,891 --> 00:41:25,650
Rym: If you're at some LAN party, it's physically easier to compromise the switch of the router.

655
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,709
Scott: Anyway, so, how do you packet sniff, and why would you want to in this day and age?

656
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:41,070
Rym: Well, the primary use of packet sniffing, and a lot of you IT junkies and people who want to get into computer science or IT should know about this, is for network troubleshooting or firewall design.

657
00:41:41,371 --> 00:41:45,569
Scott: Yep, let's say I'm sitting around, and something's weird's going on.

658
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:50,830
Scott: Like, maybe I realize that maybe someone's doing something bad or trying to attack my computer.

659
00:41:51,732 --> 00:41:59,570
Scott: I turn on my packet sniffer, and I put some filters so that I don't see every packet, but only the packets I'm looking for, and I just sit there and watch for a few minutes.

660
00:42:00,071 --> 00:42:05,830
Scott: And then I read through, and I look at the packets, because they're pretty easy to read, and I say, "Hey, look at that packet.

661
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:13,668
Scott: That came from this computer I'd ever heard of, and it's coming into my computer on this weird port, and it says weird stuff in

662
00:42:13,689 --> 00:42:13,729
Scott: it.".

663
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,890
Scott: Or maybe I see, "Hey, my computer sent out this packet.

664
00:42:17,011 --> 00:42:17,878
Scott: What's in that packet?

665
00:42:17,939 --> 00:42:19,170
Scott: It looks like an email packet.

666
00:42:19,591 --> 00:42:21,310
Scott: Why does it say something about Viagra?

667
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:23,284
Scott: My computer's sending spam.

668
00:42:23,425 --> 00:42:23,909
Scott: Oh, no, it's...".

669
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:31,830
Rym: Or say my network is just slowing down, and my router and my switches and everything are really having a hard time keeping up, and the network's just getting saturated.

670
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,244
Rym: "Ha, I wonder what's going

671
00:42:33,366 --> 00:42:33,406
Rym: on.".

672
00:42:33,911 --> 00:42:35,021
Rym: Fire up the packet sniffer.

673
00:42:35,162 --> 00:42:35,970
Rym: Start poking around.

674
00:42:36,551 --> 00:42:39,189
Rym: "Hey, Scott's computer's sending out a lot of runts.

675
00:42:39,772 --> 00:42:40,589
Rym: I wonder what's going on.

676
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,706
Rym: It looks like his network card is

677
00:42:41,747 --> 00:42:41,950
Rym: failing.".

678
00:42:42,652 --> 00:42:43,280
Scott: It could be.

679
00:42:43,503 --> 00:42:43,969
Scott: It could be.

680
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,489
Scott: So, how do you do it?

681
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:51,208
Rym: Well, download a program called Wireshark, install it, and run it.

682
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,448
Scott: That's pretty much it.

683
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:56,930
Scott: I mean, the program used to be called... There are a lot of other packet-sniffing programs out there.

684
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:57,790
Rym: Don't bother with them.

685
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,890
Scott: None of them matter.

686
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:03,270
Rym: Well, I will say NetX-Ray is really nice, but NetX-Ray costs money.

687
00:43:03,691 --> 00:43:04,710
Rym: It's not worth the money.

688
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,490
Scott: So, there used to be a program called Ethereal.

689
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:08,930
Rym: Not Ethereal.

690
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:10,155
Scott: Yeah.

691
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:12,729
Rym: I had an argument with a coworker about that.

692
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:13,510
Scott: It is pronounced Ethereal.

693
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,730
Scott: If you pronounce it any other way, you're wrong.

694
00:43:16,773 --> 00:43:29,990
Scott: That program still exists, but the people who originally worked on that program, all the developers on that project, moved on to a different project, which is now called Wireshark, which is basically the new Ethereal.

695
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:32,470
Scott: And Ethereal, basically no one's working on it.

696
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,030
Scott: It's old and busted, and Wireshark is the new hotness.

697
00:43:35,472 --> 00:43:36,769
Scott: And Wireshark is free.

698
00:43:37,271 --> 00:43:38,848
Scott: You can just go and get it and use it.

699
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,690
Rym: Runs on Windows, runs on Linux.

700
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,350
Scott: It runs on every major OS.

701
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,950
Scott: You install it, you run it, you can sniff the packets.

702
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,410
Scott: That's all there is to it.

703
00:43:47,072 --> 00:43:53,010
Scott: To get usefulness out of it, you sort of have to know about IP and stuff like that, but it's not complicated.

704
00:43:53,770 --> 00:44:02,829
Rym: Well, actually, if you want to learn a lot about how networking works, one thing you can do is packet-sniff and just look at the packets and try to piece together what's going on.

705
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,349
Scott: Yeah, for example, turn your computer on.

706
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:07,530
Scott: Install Wireshark.

707
00:44:07,931 --> 00:44:09,750
Scott: Don't do anything with the network at all.

708
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:10,530
Scott: Don't do anything.

709
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:12,910
Scott: Open Firefox, open Wireshark.

710
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,770
Scott: Set Wireshark to sniff the packets.

711
00:44:15,271 --> 00:44:20,970
Scott: Then visit one website and then tell Wireshark to stop sniffing the packets after you've finished visiting the website.

712
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,909
Scott: Now look at the packets that Wireshark sniffed.

713
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:32,823
Scott: You'll see exactly how your computer contacted the web server, asked for the web page, how the web server told you, "Hi, I'm here.

714
00:44:33,165 --> 00:44:34,150
Scott: Here's your web page.

715
00:44:34,332 --> 00:44:34,877
Scott: Are we done?

716
00:44:34,897 --> 00:44:35,523
Scott: Yes, we're done.

717
00:44:35,603 --> 00:44:35,866
Scott: Okay,

718
00:44:35,947 --> 00:44:36,169
Scott: cool.".

719
00:44:36,411 --> 00:44:46,350
Scott: You can see the web page in the packets, how the actual HTML and all the images themselves got sent to you via packets, and you can learn a lot just by looking at it.

720
00:44:46,611 --> 00:44:48,410
Rym: And it's not that hard to figure out what you're looking at.

721
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:52,590
Rym: I mean, you're going to see the to address, an IP address, the from address, an IP address.

722
00:44:52,892 --> 00:44:54,267
Rym: It'll look up names of things for you.

723
00:44:54,571 --> 00:44:55,710
Scott: You'll see the actual HTML.

724
00:44:55,891 --> 00:44:57,930
Scott: You'll see words like HTTP GET.

725
00:44:58,851 --> 00:45:01,050
Scott: It's not like hidden secret information.

726
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:01,978
Scott: It's ASCII text.

727
00:45:02,038 --> 00:45:03,430
Scott: You can read it with your eyeballs.

728
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:04,010
Scott: It's English.

729
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,670
Scott: Most of what you're getting sent is text in English.

730
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:13,648
Scott: It's not like encoded into some weird... Unless it's encrypted, like you try to visit your bank's website, this isn't going to work.

731
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:16,730
Scott: But if you visit Google, it's going to work really nicely.

732
00:45:17,953 --> 00:45:19,168
Rym: Right, so that's pretty much it.

733
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,090
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what else to say.

734
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,928
Rym: Well, I have a bunch of interesting things I can say about packet sniffing.

735
00:45:24,394 --> 00:45:27,230
Rym: Some of it's a little esoteric, but I think you'll all find this interesting.

736
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:27,906
Rym: Alrighty.

737
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:33,830
Rym: One, you might be thinking, "Alright, Rym and Scott, but I thought you said that pretty much all modern Ethernet networks are fully switched.

738
00:45:34,271 --> 00:45:35,549
Rym: So how would packet sniffing work?

739
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,303
Rym: Because you're only ever going to see traffic from

740
00:45:37,323 --> 00:45:37,686
Rym: yourself.".

741
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:44,790
Rym: Well, one, in most modern networks, a network technician, if they need to do any troubleshooting, can do something called port replication.

742
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:53,805
Rym: And basically, you can take a port on the switch and have it mirror another port on the switch, maybe the port where the server that you're trying to troubleshoot the trouble is.

743
00:45:54,730 --> 00:46:02,468
Rym: So then, I can packet sniff the conversation between two computers while I am not on their actual switch segment and then troubleshoot from there.

744
00:46:03,476 --> 00:46:04,070
Scott: That's pretty cool.

745
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:12,490
Rym: However, a nice little warning is that port replication actually is very resource intensive for a lot of older switches.

746
00:46:13,151 --> 00:46:22,330
Rym: And a lot of people who use it indiscriminately or leave ports forwarding in this manner all the time will actually substantially degrade the performance of their networks.

747
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:26,409
Rym: This happens often when you have a network that is run by some guy who has a CCNA.

748
00:46:26,691 --> 00:46:31,550
Scott: It sounds to me like the kind of thing you would do only when there's trouble and then you undo it when there's no trouble.

749
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:36,227
Rym: Two, let's say I work for, I don't know, a big company, let's say IBM.

750
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:39,450
Rym: And let's say I got this remote site somewhere in Connecticut.

751
00:46:39,894 --> 00:46:46,429
Rym: that's got a bunch of computers at it and I got a bunch of computers here, servers and then servers on both ends and workstations on both ends.

752
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:49,730
Rym: And I have a bunch of traffic going between these two sites.

753
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:58,650
Rym: But I want to protect my real IBM network from this outside vendor network that I don't trust fully because it's not my company.

754
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:00,050
Rym: I can't fully trust what's out there.

755
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,750
Rym: I don't have control over the IT situation.

756
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:04,527
Rym: So I want to build a firewall that only lets the traffic through.

757
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:04,990
Rym: that I want.

758
00:47:05,811 --> 00:47:13,149
Rym: I could read the documentation for every single piece of software and every single client and write a gigantic set of filters that would take forever.

759
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:27,750
Rym: Or I could sniff that link for, say, a week straight and then do some statistical analysis on that data, figure out from that all the different traffic patterns and then semi-automatically generate my firewall rules.

760
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:29,480
Rym: Yeah.

761
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,850
Rym: That saved me so much time.

762
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:33,643
Rym: Good God.

763
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:41,728
Scott: Yeah, because you would just look, you know, if you know that there's nothing hokey and scary going on right now, you can look and see what's going on.

764
00:47:42,471 --> 00:47:50,541
Scott: And let's say during normal, non-evil traffic patterns have people on ports 80 and 20/20 and 22 and 15 and nothing else.

765
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:56,449
Scott: Then you could just say, "Hey, firewall, block every port except those four

766
00:47:56,489 --> 00:47:56,670
Scott: ports.".

767
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:04,889
Scott: And then nobody is going to complain that their stuff isn't working and pretty much anything evil is going to be blocked out.

768
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:05,787
Rym: Right.

769
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:10,569
Rym: So let's say I'm one of the more nefarious types and I'm trying to break into a system.

770
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:15,190
Rym: Now, say I compromise some guy's computer on a food company.

771
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:17,830
Rym: I get some guy to download my stupid porn bot.

772
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:18,707
Rym: Through AIM.

773
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,190
Rym: Yep, through AIM and I break into his computer.

774
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:25,530
Rym: So now I have owned this guy's box and I don't want to spam or anything.

775
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,410
Rym: I want to do some uplink action and bust up this whole company's network.

776
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,370
Rym: So I just start running my packet capturing program.

777
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:33,249
Rym: All right.

778
00:48:33,632 --> 00:48:34,890
Rym: I'm not going to see all the traffic.

779
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:39,189
Rym: I might see this guy's stuff, but this is some low-level idiot in the receiving area or the mail room.

780
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,410
Scott: Yeah, I already have his computer.

781
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:41,749
Scott: What's his password going to get me?

782
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:42,867
Scott: The computer I've already got?

783
00:48:43,552 --> 00:48:43,870
Scott: Useless.

784
00:48:44,092 --> 00:48:45,830
Rym: I don't need to sniff his packets to get his password.

785
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:47,169
Rym: I've already installed a keylogger.

786
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,670
Rym: I know the passwords to every credit card he's ever owned.

787
00:48:50,114 --> 00:48:50,609
Scott: Ah, awesome.

788
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:51,888
Rym: So I don't need to worry about that.

789
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:57,470
Rym: But now I'm running my packet sniffer and I don't see the traffic a lot, but I see a lot of the ARP requests.

790
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:02,670
Rym: I see a lot of the stuff that the Cisco routers and switches send around to figure out what's on the network.

791
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:11,930
Rym: Over time, I can build from all of this indirect information a large database or map of a lot of the equipment that's out there on the network.

792
00:49:12,392 --> 00:49:18,090
Rym: And as a result, I can start to figure out what things out there I might be able to compromise next.

793
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:23,809
Scott: And if you can compromise a router or a switch, you are in the business, as they say.

794
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:28,470
Rym: Maybe I'll start seeing all the SNMP community strings because those pretty much aren't encrypted.

795
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:38,810
Rym: And from there, I can start getting all sorts of information and you hop and hop and hop until eventually you get to a computer that's on some sort of management network and then you just own everything.

796
00:49:38,991 --> 00:49:46,330
Scott: Or you get some sort of computer that has a database full of valuable information worth millions, and then you send a note with some ransom.

797
00:49:47,254 --> 00:49:49,090
Rym: All right, now let's say I'm in a hurry.

798
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:51,770
Rym: Let's say I don't have the time to take 20 on this roll.

799
00:49:52,211 --> 00:49:53,609
Rym: I've got to get some information quick.

800
00:49:54,312 --> 00:49:55,589
Rym: And I want to sniff the whole network.

801
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,090
Rym: But I can't sniff the whole network because the network switched.

802
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:04,770
Rym: All right, I can do things to switches to make them forget their tables of which host is where.

803
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:14,529
Rym: Because you see, if a switch gets a packet and they know where the destination of that packet is, they just send that packet out the port where they know the PC or those PCs are.

804
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:39,469
Rym: If a switch doesn't know where a PC is, either because that PC is not in its database or it's seen that PC in two different places in too short a span of time so it doesn't know where it is, or the database internally that it uses got so big that it started dropping entries, then it sends it out all parts because it always errs on the side of get the data where it's going as opposed to drop the data that I don't need to send.

805
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:47,110
Rym: Say I flood a switch with a bunch of random crap to make it forget the things it actually knows.

806
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:53,130
Rym: Now I put it in flooding mode for just about everything, and now I can sniff the network as though that switch were a hub.

807
00:50:53,914 --> 00:50:55,109
Scott: Oh, I got to learn how to do that.

808
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:56,899
Rym: It's really trivial to do.

809
00:50:56,919 --> 00:50:58,930
Rym: I could write for you a Python script that would do it.

810
00:50:58,990 --> 00:50:59,690
Scott: Oh, that's awesome.

811
00:50:59,872 --> 00:51:00,448
Rym: It's really cool.

812
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:03,950
Scott: Does it work on all switches, or would a fancy switch know better?

813
00:51:04,151 --> 00:51:10,189
Rym: Some switches can detect things like this, but there's not a lot they can do to prevent it.

814
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:20,146
Scott: Well, wouldn't a switch that's super expensive and has a lot of memory and a crazy powerful CPU, even if you flooded it, it would still be able to handle it, so it wouldn't bother to--.

815
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:23,069
Rym: All right, well, for a crappy switch, you just flood it, and then it can't remember anymore.

816
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:24,850
Scott: Yeah, our switch would definitely forget real quick.

817
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:31,010
Rym: But for an intelligent switch, you have to be more clever because remember, like I said, and we talked about this in the show we did about networking.

818
00:51:31,694 --> 00:51:32,470
Rym: I think we did, at least.

819
00:51:33,072 --> 00:51:37,110
Rym: A switch knows where the hosts are based on where packets come from.

820
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:44,471
Rym: If it sees a packet from Bob come in on port 8, it knows that Bob is on port 8, and it only sends stuff for Bob to port 8.

821
00:51:44,471 --> 00:52:05,589
Rym: If I can just send stuff from a bunch of addresses that I make up so I can send packets that look like they're from Bob from the port I'm on, now the switch has seen Bob from two different ports, and it doesn't know what to do because now it thinks there might be a loop in the network or something, so by default it's gonna start flooding more and more traffic over more and more ports just to cover its ass.

822
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:07,788
Scott: Or maybe it'll just send--.

823
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:11,010
Scott: If something comes in for Bob, it'll send it to you and Bob.

824
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:12,729
Rym: No, switches don't do that usually.

825
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:14,370
Scott: Ah, 'cause that would be really tricky.

826
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:20,790
Scott: 'cause then you could get just the one person that you know is on the switch and get them onto your port and then see their traffic.

827
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:28,609
Rym: I mean, I guess theoretically that's possible, but that is dangerous because part of the reason switches do it the way they do it is to make sure that there aren't network loops.

828
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:38,630
Rym: Network loops are mostly taken care of by something called the Spanning Tree Protocol, but all that junk, the details beyond what I've just said are I think well beyond the scope of this episode.

829
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:51,921
Scott: Yes, the point is packets on the internets get sent around and they bounce around in a lot of different places, and if you have a network card connected to the right place, you can see any packet that goes by, even if it's not a packet.

830
00:52:51,941 --> 00:52:55,468
Scott: that's for you, and it's trivial to do-- It's not for you.

831
00:52:55,711 --> 00:53:03,610
Scott: It's trivial to do with freely available software, and it is useful to do this for troubleshooting as well as malicious purposes.

832
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,830
Rym: Now, I've got one more interesting-- And educational purposes.

833
00:53:07,211 --> 00:53:16,269
Rym: That I might find this interesting, and after I go through all the questions, I'll decide whether or not to answer them now or see if any of you know the answers, or maybe you can come up with the answers.

834
00:53:17,051 --> 00:53:27,470
Rym: And I'll tell you that all of these questions were questions that were asked of me during my course of study at RIT, and I eventually-- So RIT is going to sue us for giving away free RIT applications by proxy?

835
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:32,470
Rym: I effectively answered all these questions on my own, and if you can answer these questions, just think about it.

836
00:53:32,811 --> 00:53:38,690
Rym: You'll learn a lot of insight into how networks work, and it's kind of a lateral thinking logical puzzle.

837
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:44,350
Rym: So say I set up a sniffer that doesn't do the warn the network thing or anything.

838
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:45,970
Rym: It doesn't do anything weird.

839
00:53:46,634 --> 00:53:47,809
Rym: It just sniffs the network.

840
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:54,809
Rym: How could Joey Jojo Shabadoo, the system administrator, detect that I am sniffing his network?

841
00:53:56,792 --> 00:53:57,949
Rym: Can you think of any answers, Scott?

842
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:58,847
Rym: I'll just do this with you.

843
00:53:59,452 --> 00:54:00,030
Scott: I'm thinking.

844
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:08,970
Rym: Usually we're talking about programming or Web 2.0 stuff that I don't know a lot about, and Scott's always punting me with the CS knowledge, but every now and then we delve into the IT territory.

845
00:54:09,471 --> 00:54:10,129
Scott: All right, so let's see.

846
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,210
Scott: How would I know that someone's sniffing?

847
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:16,670
Scott: Well, does the sniffing, the fact that he's doing that, impact his performance in any way?

848
00:54:16,931 --> 00:54:19,190
Rym: It does not impact the performance of the network in any way.

849
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:20,210
Rym: I'm not flooding switches.

850
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:22,988
Scott: What about the performance of his networking, specifically?

851
00:54:23,991 --> 00:54:25,068
Rym: Not in a way you could detect.

852
00:54:26,654 --> 00:54:30,250
Rym: I mean, computers are fast enough now to where that's not going to be an issue at all.

853
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:34,670
Rym: You could run a packet capture 24/7 on a gigabit link with little trouble.

854
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:35,749
Scott: All right.

855
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:40,726
Scott: Well, what if perhaps I could create some sort of fake traffic?

856
00:54:42,471 --> 00:54:43,630
Rym: All right, now you're thinking.

857
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,888
Rym: That's in fact exactly how you do it.

858
00:54:46,692 --> 00:54:58,930
Rym: What you do, if you're really worried about sniffing or you suspect that someone is sniffing your network, is that you have addresses that are sending data out, but they're not sending data to anyone in particular.

859
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:04,790
Rym: No one who is not shady or a piece of networking equipment will ever see this data.

860
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:13,110
Rym: And furthermore, no one is ever going to ARP for or do a DNS lookup for any of these IP addresses.

861
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:23,570
Rym: So if you see someone who suddenly starts looking up the IP addresses and names of those special things, that can set off all sorts of warning bells that someone is sniffing the network.

862
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:24,889
Scott: Oh, maliciously.

863
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:29,809
Scott: I mean, if they sniffed and never did anything about it, they just sat there sniffing, you wouldn't see them.

864
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:40,430
Scott: But if they actually, they would see this fake traffic going around to like IP address something something 100, and then they would start to investigate machine number 100, which is just a fake machine.

865
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:41,970
Scott: It might not even be an actual machine.

866
00:55:42,312 --> 00:55:44,490
Scott: It might just be a piece of software pretending to be a machine.

867
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:52,222
Rym: Not only that, but a lot of people sniffing, if they're not careful, their PC, because it sees this information coming in, or the sniffing software they're using.

868
00:55:52,262 --> 00:55:58,230
Rym: if they set the options wrong, will just DNS lookup all the things it sees to get more information about the network.

869
00:55:58,832 --> 00:56:05,430
Rym: And as a result, suddenly, Joey Joe's computer is hitting the DNS server for a million different IP addresses.

870
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:26,990
Scott: And your DNS server is smart enough to say, you know, you program it in such a way to say, "Hey, if anyone is looking for the names of these IP addresses or the IP addresses of these names, or if anyone tries to do any of this stuff, if anyone tries to connect to this machine, which isn't a real machine, send me an email that tells me that and tells me who it is.

871
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,144
Scott: That way I can go and arrest

872
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:28,326
Scott: them.".

873
00:56:29,612 --> 00:56:30,649
Rym: And that's pretty much it.

874
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:35,610
Rym: Everything beyond that is, I think, really too technical for the scope of this particular show, like I've already said.

875
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:40,250
Scott: So, don't go packet sniffing on networks where you're not in charge.

876
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:52,630
Rym: Yeah, if you work at a company, even though you're not likely to get anything useful out of it, you probably shouldn't packet sniff without the express permission of the IT people, or you're probably going to get in trouble.

877
00:56:53,031 --> 00:56:55,730
Scott: If you're caught, which is, I don't know how likely it is, depending.

878
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:58,290
Scott: I mean, working in a small office, probably not.

879
00:56:58,671 --> 00:57:00,930
Scott: However-- But it's not a good idea.

880
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:12,030
Rym: One thing you can do to avoid 99% of the possible detection, you can sniff in non-promiscuous mode, and then you will, in fact, only see the traffic that is going to you and from you.

881
00:57:12,372 --> 00:57:12,983
Scott: That is true.

882
00:57:13,003 --> 00:57:13,350
Rym: You can't do that.

883
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:17,348
Rym: And all the broadcast traffic and a lot of the bibby-doos and things, depending on how the switches are set up.

884
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,434
Rym: But anyway-- I just like saying

885
00:57:19,495 --> 00:57:19,858
Rym: "bibby-do."

886
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:21,350
Rym: I've been wanting to say it the whole time.

887
00:57:21,511 --> 00:57:24,990
Scott: On your home network-- Bridge Protocol Data Unit or something like that.

888
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:31,270
Scott: On your home network, where there's no chance of you doing anything bad or that could get you in trouble, download Wireshark.

889
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,210
Scott: You should probably link to it in the notes there.

890
00:57:33,271 --> 00:57:33,809
Scott: I think I will.

891
00:57:34,111 --> 00:57:36,029
Scott: And download it and try to run it.

892
00:57:36,713 --> 00:57:39,550
Scott: This documentation, if you can't figure out how to use it, it's pretty easy.

893
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:44,790
Scott: And look at packets on the internets and learn things by looking at them.

894
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:45,830
Scott: They're not complicated.

895
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,660
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

896
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,300
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

897
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:09,220
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com, where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

898
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:15,439
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week, covering four different brands of geekery.

899
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,539
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

900
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,120
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

901
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,760
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights.

902
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:26,100
Rym: And Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

903
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:31,619
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com.

904
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:34,599
Scott: Or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

905
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,160
Scott: Just click the link that says "send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

906
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:43,619
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

907
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:47,000
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website, which has everything.

00:58:54,140 --> 00:59:00,160
Scott: This means you can do whatever you want with it, as long as you give us credit, don't make money, and share it in kind.

910
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:04,460
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

911
00:59:04,902 --> 00:59:08,000
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
