1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,078
Rym: It's Christmas Eve 2007.

2
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:12,599
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,026
Rym: I'm Scott and this is geek nides.

4
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:20,970
Rym: tonight in the Christmas spirit We talk about time synchronization among disparate computer clocks.

5
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:32,927
Rym: Let's do this So 4 a.m.

6
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:38,760
Scott: Oh The time when the worst things in the universe can possibly happen.

7
00:00:38,963 --> 00:00:42,509
Rym: We'll probably link to it But there was this TED talk about how 4 a.m.

8
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:46,040
Rym: Is pretty much the worst possible time in the world.

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:53,368
Rym: And I kind of agree because you know I think about it, and if I if I wake up if I stay up until one two Three o'clock, it's awesome.

10
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:53,790
Rym: It's man.

11
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,680
Rym: I stayed up till three o'clock last night.

12
00:00:56,027 --> 00:01:00,958
Scott: I don't know I. actually my feeling is more that like three or three thirty is like the worst time.

13
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:03,553
Scott: like Four is like people are almost gonna.

14
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:04,559
Scott: Maybe wake up if they're.

15
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:07,972
Rym: That's the worst thing cuz I have a crazy early job.

16
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:08,394
Rym: You know what.

17
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:15,720
Scott: I wake up at 445 Yeah, but like three three is like you should have been in bed now and no one's waking up now.

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,228
Scott: It's like that time when you know the highest percentage should be sleeping And that's why I think three is the worst and not four.

19
00:01:22,288 --> 00:01:32,600
Rym: but apparently art people in art and literature think four is the worst And I agree with them because I remember we were in college And we'd stay up like I used to go to bed around midnight.

20
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:38,741
Rym: Ish when I was in high school that just seemed like That was as late as you stayed up and staying up later than that was always kind of silly I mean.

21
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:41,940
Rym: granted I could sleep in class, so it's not like I had to worry.

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,914
Rym: But at the same time just I didn't stay up later than that.

23
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:53,073
Rym: and then in college You know we all hung out and every night as we were hanging out We'd end up staying up later and later and later, and oh man.

24
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:53,936
Rym: It's one o'clock.

25
00:01:53,976 --> 00:02:02,872
Rym: and then a few months later oh, man, it's two o'clock and then two o'clock felt like one o'clock used to and Right around when we hit 3 a.m.. It was like all right.

26
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:04,440
Rym: That's the end of this.

27
00:02:04,702 --> 00:02:05,389
Scott: That's what I say.

28
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,480
Scott: cuz three is the worst three.

29
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,525
Rym: No three is the worst.

30
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,288
Rym: three is the limit.

31
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:15,252
Rym: staying up until three in the morning is The end point where staying up that late could have been something awesome.

32
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:16,796
Scott: no for me now.

33
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:19,287
Scott: It's like 2 a.m.. It's like all right I'm going to bed.

34
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:22,787
Scott: if I go to bed late It's gotta be somebody at time between two and three.

35
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:23,308
Scott: if it's three.

36
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:23,930
Scott: It's it's over.

37
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:29,027
Rym: That's just because you're an old man was yeah I'm sure you see if you stood.

38
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:39,259
Rym: it is possible where if you stayed up until 3 a.m.. Doing something That you had an awesome night if you stayed up until 4 a.m.. Doing something you had a shitty night.

39
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,139
Rym: odds Are I think it's a statistical correlation things that keep you up?

40
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:51,861
Rym: Until 3 a.m.. Are less likely to be shitty than things that keep you up till 4 a.m I still think the worst time is sometime around 3 30.

41
00:02:51,861 --> 00:03:04,004
Rym: Now cuz that's leading up to it 3 30 is when you go to sleep after staying up till 3 a.m.. No Anyway, but so at 4 a.m.. This morning 45 minutes before I wake up to go to work.

42
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:12,920
Rym: I'm awakened to the sound of and my brain is also awakened horribly.

43
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:13,601
Rym: Now.

44
00:03:14,163 --> 00:03:19,098
Rym: you never had that situation where you wake up and your brain isn't quite sure what the hell's going on like.

45
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,166
Scott: I was quite Sure, what was going on almost immediately now?

46
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:27,079
Rym: I was too after about five seconds, but only because I'd been primed by events prior.

47
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:44,059
Rym: oh But you know sometimes you wake up to an unexpected stimulus like you're laying in bed, and you hear Something and you think it's your alarm clock, but no it's your cell phone, so you're hitting your alarm clock And it doesn't turn off and then you realize it's your phone.

48
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,031
Rym: Yeah, it's happened a few times, so I'm laying there in bed going.

49
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:49,355
Rym: What's that noise?

50
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:50,740
Rym: What's that noise?

51
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,980
Rym: Why can't I read my alarm clock?

52
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,092
Rym: It's it's not on where to go and then wait a minute.

53
00:03:57,434 --> 00:03:59,180
Rym: power outage UPS.

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,920
Rym: Yep, so I crawl out of bed, and I sit in the air on and I try to turn on my monitor.

55
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:06,353
Scott: Why won't it turn out?

56
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:07,160
Rym: Oh wait?

57
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,580
Rym: I only plug the computer into the UPS cuz I don't plan for the power going out out.

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,376
Rym: I plan for the power blipping like when the air conditioning comes on.

59
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:19,069
Rym: yep Because we're very geeky and a very non geeky house.

60
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,677
Rym: There's like one circuit in this house.

61
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:22,579
Scott: It's like three.

62
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:24,386
Rym: Barely okay.

63
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:28,100
Rym: if I vacuum downstairs the lights upstairs dim and my UPS goes.

64
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:32,012
Rym: Yeah, yep, so I just turn.

65
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:39,140
Rym: I hit the power button on the front of my PC thinking all right I hope I told it to gracefully power off and not ungracefully power off.

66
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:43,619
Scott: Yeah, I just freaking pushed all the buttons on all the UPS is to shut them up.

67
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:46,499
Rym: I I at least gracefully powered down my PC.

68
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,124
Scott: I really don't care.

69
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:53,519
Rym: I did a little bit because I already corrupted my NTFS partition with this these shenanigans earlier.

70
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:56,311
Scott: You see that's shitty ass NTFS.

71
00:04:56,331 --> 00:04:56,974
Scott: What can you expect?

72
00:04:57,034 --> 00:04:58,320
Rym: Yeah, it all started?

73
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:00,936
Rym: You know we got this mixer, and I'm setting it up over the weekend.

74
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:01,460
Rym: the new xenix.

75
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:09,538
Rym: I'm all excited about it, and I'm twiddling knobs and going testing one two three testing one two three and then my computer crashed and I couldn't make it boot.

76
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:15,059
Rym: and The only thing that had been happening at all recently were problems with UPS is.

77
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:20,560
Rym: So I had taken my computer off the UPS to do full testing and I hadn't put it back on the UPS.

78
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:24,839
Rym: And then the power went out a bunch of times and it fucked up my NTFS.

79
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:29,133
Rym: Hey, I don't know why I was booted into Windows, but I don't know why either.

80
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,860
Rym: I wasn't gonna play a steam game.

81
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,095
Rym: I have time for that nope, but yeah yesterday.

82
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:37,905
Rym: There was a a Thunderstorm in the winter.

83
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:46,220
Scott: well it was snowing and then the snow stayed around It was cold, and then it rained way too much, and it winded way too much.

84
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,251
Scott: And there's a little bit of thunder and lightning, but not much.

85
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:50,582
Rym: see it only rained a little bit I wasn't.

86
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:51,285
Rym: it wasn't.

87
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:51,667
Rym: oh no.

88
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:51,948
Rym: It's good.

89
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:52,491
Rym: It's raining.

90
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:52,852
Rym: It was like.

91
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:56,912
Rym: Oh, it's sprinkling and it's uncharacteristically warm kind of like last year's.

92
00:05:56,973 --> 00:06:04,031
Rym: we go grocery shopping and And Don't bring umbrellas Partly cuz the Internet's down unrelated to all that.

93
00:06:04,473 --> 00:06:06,620
Rym: so we couldn't check the weather other than to look outside.

94
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:08,860
Rym: And I didn't expect a thunderstorm.

95
00:06:09,961 --> 00:06:12,049
Scott: No, but we got at the grocery store man.

96
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,495
Scott: There was a lot of rain coming down.

97
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:14,780
Rym: It was raining.

98
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:16,773
Scott: Yeah, so there were there a few like.

99
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:17,700
Scott: there weren't power.

100
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:23,665
Scott: I guess it was a power outage, but very short power outages like off on Off on.

101
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:26,355
Rym: I think the best part is we're trying to play dune through all this.

102
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:31,695
Rym: the power keeps going out And of course there's no flashlight anywhere near us.

103
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:36,900
Rym: so the power is out And I stand up ready to hurt myself stumbling through the house looking for a flashlight.

104
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,208
Rym: And the power came back on.

105
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:39,134
Rym: so I found a flashlight.

106
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:40,040
Rym: power goes out.

107
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,992
Rym: I turn the light on look at the dune board.

108
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:42,958
Rym: power comes back on.

109
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:50,485
Rym: So we're sitting there and the power is on and we're just looking at each other and meanwhile my Harkonnen are poised to destroy The benna guesser hit.

110
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:53,600
Rym: yeah great for the second time because the two-player game is broken.

111
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:55,187
Scott: Super broken that two-player.

112
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,693
Rym: You know the two-player dune game is.

113
00:06:56,714 --> 00:06:58,140
Rym: I'll tell you how it works.

114
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,887
Rym: It's called the Harkonnen win.

115
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:05,740
Scott: I don't know there's some other guys in there, but no one else has that much of a front game advantage.

116
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:10,219
Scott: That's true, and it's it's very difficult for one person to hold them off.

117
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:16,000
Rym: Yes, but uh so the power is on and we're sitting there is looking at each other with the fly.

118
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:23,600
Rym: I have the flashlight in my hand and I turn the flashlight on and at that second the power goes back.

119
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,672
Rym: yep, so I'm sitting there with a flashlight on and we're both thinking it's not Nintendo.

120
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:33,804
Rym: logic dictates that if I turn this flashlight off the Power will come back on.

121
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:38,740
Rym: and sure enough power came back on just as I turn the flashlight off.

122
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:42,059
Rym: Anyway, I'm pretty sure that flashlight was controlling the power.

123
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,094
Scott: Yeah, but the power came back on and it stayed on and then we went to bed.

124
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:45,496
Scott: and then at 4 a.m.

125
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:48,102
Scott: I see thing.

126
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:59,280
Scott: I recommend buying a UPS for your computers or whatever because if the power is not super awesome in your house You know then what's gonna happen is the power will go off on and your computer will go what the fuck and get screwed up.

127
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,212
Scott: But you have a UPS.

128
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:00,739
Scott: you'd be okay.

129
00:08:00,942 --> 00:08:07,400
Rym: There's no reason to get a big UPS because and not even to plug your monitor into it because if the power is going off for more than a blip you're fucked.

130
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,425
Rym: Anyway, you're not gonna be home.

131
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,028
Rym: You don't care.

132
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:19,840
Rym: It's and also I know that when I was a kid I never had to deal with this because I all the power lines where I lived were underground and at RIT We never had to deal with it because we had a power substation on campus.

133
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:23,219
Rym: The power went out like once and when it went out it went out for a long time.

134
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:30,380
Scott: Yeah, but when I lived in Connecticut, the power lines weren't above ground and there wasn't a substation either But the power was much higher quality.

135
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,188
Scott: So if it went out it was out and it was on.

136
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:33,590
Scott: it was on.

137
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:33,731
Scott: there.

138
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,220
Scott: wasn't this like power dimming or you know Sort of sort of running out or turning off for a second?

139
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:39,642
Scott: It was just.

140
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:41,932
Scott: either it was working great or it was not working at all.

141
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:52,018
Rym: But yeah, it was a windy yesterday - Crazy windy kind of scarily windy like I'd be sitting here and the front door would suddenly be ripped open as hard as it could.

142
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,412
Rym: bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang.

143
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,424
Scott: I hate that front door.

144
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:58,756
Rym: Yeah, we should probably fix it.

145
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,498
Scott: Anyway, my guess is that all these power out, you know short power outages.

146
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:08,708
Scott: I think the power guys went out to work on the on the wires or something And of course they chose 4 a.m.

147
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,239
Scott: Because sure enough when that power went out see my clock was on the UPS.

148
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:20,750
Scott: So while the UPS was screaming that the battery was in use the clock said 4 a.m Exactly, and I'm like, there's no way the power would go out at 4 a.m.

149
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,215
Scott: Exactly the guys.

150
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:23,760
Scott: there has to be guys working on it.

151
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:32,700
Rym: well, the thing is I remember it was two years ago and I was here alone for some reason and I was sitting in my room and I see a bunch of flashing lights.

152
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:55,939
Rym: I look outside and I see the power company and they're like they're doing something and then and they're over at the other end of the street and I see him up on the pole working and then they go further up the street to the next out pole and This is the pole that is but like the main pole for our street and they go up there and I'm thinking I sure hope They don't turn the power off on me and then immediately the power went off.

153
00:09:56,622 --> 00:10:03,288
Scott: Yeah, I was watching those guys and basically there's like on that one pole There's this switch and it's literally just like this lever.

154
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:09,979
Scott: and they pulled the lever out with this big long wooden stick and they pulled Lever out and it turns the power off on the whole street.

155
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:16,652
Scott: And then when they were done working, they plug the lever back in and I was like fuckers You're just controlling the whole power for the whole street here.

156
00:10:16,813 --> 00:10:17,898
Scott: Yeah, not even warning us.

157
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:20,070
Rym: now The best thing is powers out.

158
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:26,300
Rym: I once I'm awake enough I realized to turn off my fucking UPS and go back to bed and I hear that Scott's done the same.

159
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:29,139
Rym: But I still hear UPS going off.

160
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,787
Scott: That was the the hallway one.

161
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:32,590
Rym: Yeah, cuz.

162
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,814
Rym: then I thought oh, wait a minute.

163
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,840
Rym: That's the UPS for the networking equipment.

164
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:39,045
Rym: Hey Scott will deal with it.

165
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:39,668
Rym: I went to sleep.

166
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,662
Scott: Yeah, I had a hard time going to sleep after You.

167
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,370
Rym: I had to be up in 45 minutes.

168
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:46,978
Scott: Well, you should have stayed up.

169
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,590
Rym: No, no.

170
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:50,508
Rym: well, the best part is.

171
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:53,726
Rym: then I get up and I go to the train but Holiday schedule.

172
00:10:53,746 --> 00:11:00,637
Rym: the train didn't come when I thought it was gonna come I knew it was a holiday schedule and then to make today just like extra awesome.

173
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:01,520
Rym: I'm at work.

174
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:09,940
Scott: There's like ten minutes before I'm gonna go home cuz I'm working a half day And of course another isn't because you had the train wasn't gonna come at the normal time.

175
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,095
Rym: Well ten minutes before I catch that train like I'd planned it all.

176
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:13,457
Rym: I didn't care.

177
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:14,724
Rym: I took a long launch I dealt with it.

178
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:22,359
Rym: Hey, and uh, I Fucked something up and something's crashed and I know it's a race against the clock to get this thing going before I can go home.

179
00:11:23,902 --> 00:11:30,040
Rym: That was awesome, yeah, yeah, I'll tell you this VMware ESX server not the most well documented thing.

180
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:37,646
Scott: No, usually those proprietary things documentation can't be supposed to be like enterprise awesome Which means it's not.

181
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:40,320
Scott: it's documented even less because they want you to pay them to take care of it.

182
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:46,100
Rym: Yeah, it's like that time way back at IBM when I we had redhead enterprise support theoretically.

183
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:50,837
Rym: So I called redhead to try to get some support and that didn't end.

184
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,040
Rym: Well, nope Alright, that's enough of our personal lives.

185
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:58,480
Scott: So yesterday I go to the grocery store right right when it was crazy raining.

186
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:02,700
Scott: I needed some shampoo, so I bought some shampoo or what I thought was shampoo.

187
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:11,747
Scott: So in the shower today, I tried to use it first shower in three days, you know, it's vacation and The shampoo doesn't shampoo like.

188
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:15,639
Scott: I can't get it to go in my hair like it just won't move.

189
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:19,158
Rym: it won't Water water if I you sure it was shampoo.

190
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:22,151
Scott: No, when I look at the bottle it said condition.

191
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:23,678
Scott: I was like fuck no one.

192
00:12:23,698 --> 00:12:28,940
Rym: I Contend that you might have been doing it wrong because conditioner goes into your hair easy.

193
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:32,353
Scott: It didn't go into my hair very and easily at all.

194
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:33,960
Rym: kind of conditioner you use it?

195
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,302
Scott: I don't know.

196
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:36,071
Scott: you try it and tell me if there's something wrong with it.

197
00:12:36,534 --> 00:12:36,916
Rym: Screw you.

198
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:37,418
Rym: I use vo5.

199
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,445
Rym: I'm not using that fructose BS.

200
00:12:39,786 --> 00:12:40,488
Scott: It smells like fruit.

201
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:41,331
Scott: That's the reason I bought it.

202
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:44,400
Rym: Yeah, you know what my vo5 smells like lavender.

203
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:45,244
Rym: That's bad.

204
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,993
Rym: I like the smell of lavender.

205
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:48,500
Scott: Well, see that's because you are a fruit.

206
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,744
Scott: I just like to smell like fruit.

207
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:50,828
Rym: I also have one.

208
00:12:50,848 --> 00:12:52,434
Rym: It's chamomile and lavender.

209
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:56,204
Rym: Okay, that's even worse and I have that pomegranate Mango body wash.

210
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:56,886
Scott: Oh, that's okay.

211
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:57,267
Scott: That's fruit.

212
00:12:57,468 --> 00:12:58,531
Rym: I stopped using that though.

213
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:00,257
Scott: You guys stopped using the fruit.

214
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:03,869
Rym: Well, I got lavender Notes the trend bad.

215
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:04,271
Scott: Okay.

216
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:06,416
Scott: Anyway, so Yeah.

217
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:08,700
Scott: So I read the directions.

218
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,946
Scott: I've never used conditioner on my life and nor did I want to put it in your hair rinse it out That's what I figured.

219
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,440
Scott: and it says shampoo first then do it.

220
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:25,568
Scott: So I'm like aha because I know sometimes when you shampoo two times the second shampooing is like much different, you know Because the oil is all out of your hair.

221
00:13:25,628 --> 00:13:28,320
Scott: So the chemical thing happens more easily.

222
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:34,320
Scott: So I say okay So I take the last of my old shampoo and I shampoo and then I try to conditioner just to see how it goes.

223
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:35,677
Scott: See if it's bullshit or not.

224
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,974
Scott: conditioner Still a pain in the ass to get it in my hair.

225
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:40,980
Scott: It just doesn't do its thing.

226
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:42,887
Rym: I contend that you were doing it wrong.

227
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:45,858
Rym: conditioner is a wonderful thing is not?

228
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:46,400
Scott: it didn't work.

229
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,625
Rym: So I'll tell you what.

230
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:48,670
Rym: just to compare.

231
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:50,720
Rym: cuz I don't want to put that fructose crap in my hair.

232
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:54,432
Rym: You can try my nice conditioner once just a little bit.

233
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,618
Scott: I don't know I'm not gonna smell like lavender.

234
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,000
Scott: Fuck that.

235
00:13:57,343 --> 00:13:58,499
Scott: What's wrong with lavender?

236
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,247
Scott: It's it sucks.

237
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:01,537
Scott: It smells like shit.

238
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:11,265
Scott: So, uh, yeah the conditioner still wouldn't go in my hair in any non Irritating way.

239
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:13,396
Scott: so I rinsed it out and I was just and I went.

240
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:14,040
Scott: I comb my hair.

241
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:15,506
Scott: My hair was no different than it ever is.

242
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:16,912
Scott: I'm like, it's fucked shit.

243
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:17,555
Scott: He's useless.

244
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:18,660
Scott: He doesn't even do anything.

245
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,720
Rym: Conditioner is usually meant for people with long hair so you can untangle it and such either way.

246
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:32,726
Scott: I I got a bottle of conditioner if anyone wants it only used once and right times Right and I went to the store today and I bought some shampoo.

247
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,809
Scott: That's actually shampoo.

248
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,757
Rym: So to talk about technology a little bit.

249
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,784
Rym: I Need a laptop.

250
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:42,280
Rym: I've been needing one pretty much ever since I had money for seven years again.

251
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:46,580
Rym: No, I didn't have money seven years ago since they existed and I didn't really need a laptop back then.

252
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,425
Rym: I mean, you always needed one.

253
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:54,034
Rym: You know it when I was at RIT one I could get a computer pretty much anywhere on campus that I needed.

254
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:58,359
Rym: and if I really needed a laptop I could go to the library and just get a laptop.

255
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,610
Scott: Yeah, those weren't the yeah plus.

256
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:05,504
Rym: remember when I worked for ITS they gave me that Gateway Awesome tablet.

257
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:08,015
Rym: you barely used it because I didn't need a laptop.

258
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:09,020
Rym: I had no reason to use it.

259
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,286
Scott: I think you have a problem.

260
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:18,007
Rym: I never really needed a laptop because anywhere I was gonna compute I had a computer and My commute was a car.

261
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:20,360
Rym: So it's not like I was gonna use the laptop in the car.

262
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:20,781
Rym: That's good.

263
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:21,925
Rym: That's an awesome thing to do.

264
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:24,653
Scott: cops do it and they shouldn't be should be.

265
00:15:25,435 --> 00:15:27,200
Scott: so, uh, they do better policing.

266
00:15:28,106 --> 00:15:28,378
Rym: Yes.

267
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:41,235
Rym: So now that I have a train commute a full long train commute in the city And now that I need to do more GeekNights work it and I have tons of money now It's time to get a laptop and I like Scott's laptop and I looked in.

268
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:46,813
Rym: I can get Scott's laptop But a lot faster for about the same that he paid now a little faster.

269
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:50,731
Scott: Well two cars instead of one Yeah, but that only helps you so much.

270
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:52,100
Scott: It's not like it's double powerful.

271
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:55,791
Rym: Well, it's double powerful if you do certain very specific things.

272
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:58,500
Rym: Yeah, but um, it's a good deal good price.

273
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:00,127
Rym: I I was gonna buy it.

274
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:01,132
Rym: I just decided screw it.

275
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:01,614
Rym: I got money.

276
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:02,759
Rym: I'm buying it right now.

277
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:06,793
Rym: That's about when the pot with the internet went out So I didn't buy it.

278
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:13,046
Rym: So now I'm looking at Fujitsu's new Possibly pen rain laptop.

279
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:14,452
Rym: that's gonna come out in January.

280
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:16,680
Scott: Maybe it's one of those who knows.

281
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:19,169
Scott: Well, I kind of thing if it comes out.

282
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:20,354
Rym: I'm getting this one instead.

283
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:20,996
Rym: Yeah.

284
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:24,049
Scott: Well, you know that There's like Mac world, whatever.

285
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,370
Scott: I don't know.

286
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:31,720
Scott: It's soonish and you know There's all those rumors of 12 and 14 inch MacBooks and things which could also be pen rain possible.

287
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:34,979
Rym: I know cuz this is I understand for the first time ever.

288
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,738
Rym: what kind of person would ever be excited about when Apple is gonna announce something?

289
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,191
Rym: because if You don't care or you already have an iPod.

290
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,155
Rym: You don't need a new iPod.

291
00:16:44,176 --> 00:16:45,552
Rym: You don't need a new Apple thing you don't care.

292
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:50,960
Rym: but I'm in the market for a laptop and I can see what Apple offers.

293
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:57,413
Rym: but I know That if you're gonna buy an Apple thing You might as well wait until the next Apple thing comes out and then buy it.

294
00:16:57,493 --> 00:16:59,842
Scott: because the thing is we were most excited about That stuff.

295
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:03,900
Scott: or people already have their Apple stuff and they just want to buy the newer one.

296
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:08,520
Rym: See, I don't get that I don't get that but I am excited to have something that works.

297
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:09,664
Scott: What do you need something else for?

298
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:19,520
Rym: I am excited about the next Apple thing just because they might announce a product I want in which case I'll just buy it or they might not and if they don't I'll probably buy this laptop.

299
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:23,579
Rym: And if they don't and this laptop is not what it appears to be or doesn't come out in time.

300
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:28,594
Rym: I'm gonna buy Scott's laptop only with the dual core and with a little camera in it.

301
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:30,359
Rym: Yeah, maybe hot pink.

302
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:31,647
Scott: I don't think you want.

303
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:33,317
Scott: the pink one doesn't come with a dual core.

304
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:34,864
Rym: No, it doesn't But it's pink.

305
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:36,309
Scott: that's you can get.

306
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:38,879
Scott: you can get that pink laptop and your lavender conditioner.

307
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,270
Rym: now I'm gonna get the black laptop.

308
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:42,520
Scott: Yeah, that's right alright.

309
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:50,719
Scott: So yeah In China, you know the people in China and the government and the giant communist bureaucracy of Sun.

310
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,407
Rym: Oh, I know you're gonna talk about.

311
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:54,940
Scott: you know about that right the the communist bureaucracy.

312
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:56,620
Rym: Are you gonna talk about the fraud website?

313
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:58,304
Rym: Maybe all right, let's go.

314
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:04,159
Scott: basically they're corrupt as any giant bureaucracy of course has corruption.

315
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:18,500
Rym: now I contend it is my personal opinion based on what little arguable knowledge I have about world affairs is that China is not the most corrupt in rapidly industrializing power in the world.

316
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:25,270
Rym: I think that India's and Pakistan civil infrastructure are far more Talking about the amount relative to other countries.

317
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,696
Scott: I'm talking about the absolute value.

318
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:36,208
Scott: there's a lot of corruption Absolute value parentheses corruption Exactly.

319
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:48,189
Scott: and China has of course a. What any corrupt giant behemoth bureaucracy does when there's a problem is create another bureau To uh to solve the problem.

320
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:50,860
Rym: So someone else to bribe in the chain of bribery, right?

321
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:57,231
Scott: So there's a. there's a National Bureau of corruption prevention the NBCP.

322
00:18:58,114 --> 00:18:59,899
Rym: I really want to work there, right?

323
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:05,758
Scott: They were set up on September 13th, and the Minister of supervision is the head of it.

324
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:19,076
Scott: His name is Ma Wen or maybe it's her name I don't know And the bureau has been entrusted to collect and analyze information from the banking land use medicine adult Telecommunication sectors among others and share with prosecuting organs courts and police.

325
00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:19,578
Scott: All right.

326
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:27,380
Scott: So this NBCP set up a website where people can go and report corruption.

327
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:35,429
Scott: ha in the government, huh yeah, and Let me first of all the news story.

328
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,275
Scott: Is that so many people want to report corruption?

329
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:38,219
Scott: the website broke down.

330
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:44,477
Scott: The number of visitors is very large and beyond our expectations.

331
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:44,818
Scott: he said.

332
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:48,043
Scott: Okay, as of 4 p.m.

333
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:54,263
Scott: Yesterday visitors had left 22 pages of messages in the guest book You know.

334
00:19:54,585 --> 00:20:02,571
Scott: while many of them referred to report specific cases of official corruption Those were redirected by the webmaster other sites such as ministry supervision.

335
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:09,350
Scott: others made calls for the strengths of the government's anti-corruption efforts and Comments about the head for special attention be given to cases blah blah blah.

336
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:12,480
Scott: the corruption problem in China is a fatal illness.

337
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:15,433
Scott: Establishing more institutions will not solve the problem.

338
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:28,540
Scott: one comment read ha I Just think that when you look at all the pieces of this story It like it comes together to be like so many from so many hilarious angles, you know, it's like there's corruption.

339
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:32,620
Rym: So they make another government organization and then a bunch of people report corruption.

340
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:37,400
Scott: In so much corruption people report to that government organization and the government nation.

341
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:40,268
Scott: It's so clumsy bureaucracy.

342
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:46,607
Scott: nous fails to get the website up because it's so corrupt and They think it's probably corrupt itself.

343
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:47,589
Scott: Who knows it is just.

344
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,535
Scott: it's just so terrible and it's the.

345
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:58,559
Scott: I think this is the shining One greatest example that I've ever seen of what happens with a giant giant bureaucracy of corruptness.

346
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:02,813
Rym: I guess that's why Soviet communism didn't do so.

347
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:03,114
Rym: Well.

348
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,177
Scott: Yeah, it's something else.

349
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:05,080
Scott: I noticed about this.

350
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:12,218
Scott: There's something I from looking at a bunch of different communism's, you know, Soviet Russia Cuba North Korea,

351
00:21:12,258 --> 00:21:12,440
Rym: right

352
00:21:13,163 --> 00:21:26,300
Scott: They all have something in common in that they try to build Great projects usually buildings or other pieces of infrastructure like bridges or things like that And they always seem to not finish them like in Cuba.

353
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:32,497
Scott: There's some buildings that were like big and fancy buildings, but they are unfinished in Soviet Russia big fancy things unfinished.

354
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:40,782
Scott: in North Korea They got the biggest baddest fanciest unfinished things you've ever seen and China.

355
00:21:40,923 --> 00:21:52,520
Scott: here you go this website sort of a big fancy unfinished thing and It seems like communism is like if you want to have a country full of big projects that don't get completed.

356
00:21:52,943 --> 00:21:55,360
Scott: But you know that if they were completed would be awesome.

357
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,494
Scott: Communism's the best way to do that.

358
00:21:58,555 --> 00:21:59,139
Scott: as far as I can

359
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:19,398
Rym: See I'm a big fan of public works and that sort of thing in infrastructural investments and I think the majority of Western history has shown that civilizations who invest in civil infrastructure tend to do better off in the long run as long as they don't invest in it to the detriment of other more important things

360
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:20,402
Scott: Food.

361
00:22:20,944 --> 00:22:27,205
Rym: Yeah, maybe or maybe trying to invest in civil infrastructure when you don't have anything to invest in the first place That's also bad.

362
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:28,551
Rym: imagine if the u.s.

363
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:30,640
Rym: Invested in civil infrastructure on that scale.

364
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:36,340
Scott: Haha, yeah, I don't want to have a bunch of unfinished buildings around it or like half bridges.

365
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:38,604
Rym: We'd probably finish it all.

366
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:43,417
Rym: but the thing is we'd pry of 70s syndrome where everything built in the 70s is ugly.

367
00:22:43,437 --> 00:22:45,922
Scott: Yeah It's true.

368
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:50,820
Rym: Anyway, speaking of overly corrupt evil dictatorships and such.

369
00:22:51,465 --> 00:23:03,880
Rym: I'd like to talk a little bit about our friends in Australia Because Australia's government is really kind of I don't know eerie to me and I generally am afraid of how often Fascist they seem to be when it comes to it technology issues.

370
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,780
Scott: It's so weird because Australia is like this totally backwards and forwards place simultaneously.

371
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:10,515
Scott: It's like in half of everything they do.

372
00:23:10,535 --> 00:23:18,539
Scott: They're awesome and they got cool people and it's a wonderful semi tropical place with beautiful buildings and wonderful things going on and it seems great.

373
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,380
Scott: and Then you look at the other half and it's like this horrible fascist place with these draconian laws and big brother and scariness.

374
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:27,592
Rym: Well, I think what it coming.

375
00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:29,040
Rym: I had a friend who was Australian.

376
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,963
Rym: He explained it to me.

377
00:23:30,003 --> 00:23:31,649
Rym: thus in Australia.

378
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:34,298
Rym: The government is incompetent when it comes to anything modern.

379
00:23:34,318 --> 00:23:38,079
Rym: They don't get it They just they can't deal with it and they freak out moral whatever about everything.

380
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:42,900
Rym: But at the same time the majority of us Australians just completely ignore what the government says.

381
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:44,930
Rym: So it all works out.

382
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,633
Rym: Mm-hmm But Australia is at it again and I'm not.

383
00:23:48,653 --> 00:23:50,000
Rym: I don't need to talk about this much.

384
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,736
Rym: That's why I felt it was okay to go on forever about.

385
00:23:53,078 --> 00:23:57,371
Rym: you know The meaningless minutiae minutiae of our lives and the power outages.

386
00:23:57,992 --> 00:24:17,618
Rym: the ACMA the Australian Communications and Media Authority Has decided that the government has to force all websites or web providers that have mature content either for 15 plus or 18 plus to Verify the ages of people who will see this content.

387
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:20,229
Scott: Oh Unenforceable laws.

388
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:21,379
Scott: you are always hilarious.

389
00:24:22,323 --> 00:24:24,811
Rym: Point the first this is impossible and stupid.

390
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:25,874
Rym: point the second.

391
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:27,560
Rym: This is impossible.

392
00:24:28,307 --> 00:24:28,892
Rym: Point the third.

393
00:24:28,952 --> 00:24:29,740
Rym: This is stupid.

394
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:38,388
Rym: there is no way they can enforce it without making a registry of everyone and given it like making a Some sort of standard way of verifying age.

395
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:44,649
Rym: and then you basically just be giving the government this gigantic Database of every person and a bunch of data about them.

396
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:48,201
Scott: and even then what if I use someone else's computer when they're not Looking?

397
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:48,983
Rym: Oh snap.

398
00:24:49,084 --> 00:24:51,270
Rym: Oh snap, and uh, what about?

399
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:54,400
Rym: I don't know a website in China the u.s.

400
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,405
Scott: Brazil?

401
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:58,700
Scott: hey, you're Australian laws don't mean anything to my website.

402
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:04,960
Scott: In fact, I should make a website and just put like one porn one porn photo on like a page hidden on the website.

403
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:05,831
Scott: You say up there it is.

404
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:09,391
Rym: I'm breaking laws I I don't get you Australia.

405
00:25:09,672 --> 00:25:10,940
Rym: Why don't you just vote these people out?

406
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:14,980
Scott: Yeah, I mean if the people are all cool and whatnot and they ignore the government.

407
00:25:15,101 --> 00:25:16,892
Scott: Why don't you mean you're voting there, right?

408
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,284
Scott: It's not a you know Dictatorship or anything.

409
00:25:19,324 --> 00:25:23,700
Scott: vote away these people vote new people who are cool and not stupid who know about computers.

410
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:33,478
Rym: Anyway, it is time for things of the day.

411
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:35,200
Scott: You ever seen that movie?

412
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,030
Scott: Ghostbusters, uh, mayhaps mayhaps, you know that scene.

413
00:25:40,091 --> 00:25:47,480
Scott: early on the movie were in the hotel and the dye in the fancy dining room and You know does that trick where he pulls the tablecloth out from under all the dishes.

414
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,075
Rym: you know, I think of all the scenes in that movie.

415
00:25:50,095 --> 00:25:52,566
Rym: that is actually My favorite scene.

416
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:55,457
Rym: you think so because I mean the movie's going on.

417
00:25:55,498 --> 00:26:01,077
Rym: It's a good movie It's really funny, but just that scene they're uh, they're in this fancy room and they're.

418
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:08,548
Rym: they basically destroy everything in the room on purpose because it's fun and They're just such jackasses.

419
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,914
Scott: Let's go watch it.

420
00:26:10,537 --> 00:26:11,160
Rym: I think we should.

421
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:22,759
Scott: Anyway That scene is funny because he does the tablecloth trick and just guts all the dishes all over the floor instead of pulling the tablecloth out from under the dishes without them moving which is where you're supposed to do.

422
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:24,329
Scott: and You know the reason.

423
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,038
Scott: that trick works.

424
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:26,504
Scott: Physics learn it.

425
00:26:27,246 --> 00:26:28,369
Scott: So here's a guy.

426
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:33,862
Rym: Well, it doesn't always work as I I proved to my parents Really?

427
00:26:34,103 --> 00:26:34,465
Scott: Yes.

428
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:35,047
Scott: Good job.

429
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:36,793
Rym: I was a little kid.

430
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:38,540
Rym: I'll tell that story another time.

431
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:39,967
Rym: You know, I don't need to tell the story.

432
00:26:39,987 --> 00:26:40,591
Rym: it's pretty simple.

433
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:41,596
Rym: you can guess what I did.

434
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:42,380
Rym: I was like eight.

435
00:26:42,822 --> 00:26:46,099
Rym: I said hey mom watch this and I broke a whole bunch of dishes.

436
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,279
Scott: You need to do it really quickly.

437
00:26:49,882 --> 00:26:51,429
Rym: Oh, I did it as quickly as an eight-year-old.

438
00:26:51,449 --> 00:26:54,924
Rym: can you realize I didn't even get it all the way off the table Uh-huh.

439
00:26:55,288 --> 00:26:56,297
Rym: My arms weren't long enough.

440
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:04,500
Scott: Anyway, this guy he he sits he's there He's got a table with tablecloth and a bunch of dishes and he's gonna do the trick.

441
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:09,219
Scott: He pulls the tablecloth out from under right and you think oh man, this is such an old lame trick, whatever.

442
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:13,109
Scott: and Then he doesn't do it and he goes through.

443
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,619
Scott: what I can only say is the best build-up.

444
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:24,660
Scott: Basically, he has his lame trick But he makes it unlame by building up to it in this crazy way and it makes you the way he does.

445
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,080
Scott: It makes you really really really want to see him do this lame old trick that you already know what's gonna happen.

446
00:27:30,423 --> 00:27:39,185
Rym: you know, it's kind of like a. He talked a lot about how to make people Really get into a magic trick especially if it's dangerous.

447
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:50,315
Rym: and the trick is and you see a lot of street performers doing this and Actually, I'll warn you once you know that people do this It actually takes away a lot from future performances of you know, death-defying things.

448
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:55,590
Rym: if you do a trick That's very difficult to do but looks like it's easy to do then.

449
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,753
Rym: No one's impressed at all.

450
00:27:56,853 --> 00:27:59,139
Rym: magicians are but no one else is.

451
00:27:59,441 --> 00:28:00,770
Rym: No, no audience gives a shit.

452
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,039
Rym: they think wow that looked really easy.

453
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:08,619
Rym: Now if you do something that looks incredibly difficult to do even if it's really simple people are super impressed by that.

454
00:28:09,381 --> 00:28:12,033
Rym: Yep, so a technique that a lot of you magicians.

455
00:28:12,073 --> 00:28:18,571
Rym: I almost said musicians use is they'll build up a trick by making it look really dangerous.

456
00:28:18,932 --> 00:28:40,420
Rym: and even I've seen some like jugglers with knives and things Screwing it up a couple of times and like bailing out at the last second be like, oh, well Let me try that again or like almost fucking up or just acting like like screwing up on purpose to make it seem like it's This crazy thing that if they pull it off It's the most amazing thing in the world and it just builds up the suspense and the suspense and the spent.

457
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:41,565
Rym: Is he gonna do it?

458
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:42,489
Rym: Is he gonna do it?

459
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,223
Rym: and then you do it and even if it's something lame people just eat it Up.

460
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:45,774
Rym: Mm-hmm.

461
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,439
Scott: so this guy builds up this incredible amount of suspense and in a wonderful way to the pulling the tablecloth trick.

462
00:28:51,459 --> 00:29:00,798
Scott: and Then he does one more thing which is even better than that that you didn't see coming the whole time and that's why he's awesome And I saw it coming about 15 seconds before he did it.

463
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,706
Scott: Yeah It's good stuff.

464
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:03,750
Rym: He's pretty funny.

465
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:08,543
Rym: Yeah, so, uh Chernobyl Don't go there.

466
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:15,404
Rym: Actually much of the area is kind of safe and there I meant, you know, don't go in there Don't go into block four.

467
00:29:15,484 --> 00:29:21,680
Rym: Yeah, so, uh, this is really old and some of you may have seen it But if you haven't this is kind of fascinating.

468
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:36,077
Rym: This is an old BBC Horizon documentary about the scientists who had been toiling inside Chernobyl and studying it and basically trying to figure out Where all that nuclear fuel went after it blew up because no one knew.

469
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:36,880
Rym: we didn't know where it went.

470
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,246
Rym: We couldn't find it all do?

471
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:39,049
Scott: they have cancer.

472
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,078
Rym: a lot of them have died.

473
00:29:41,159 --> 00:30:00,220
Rym: actually Yeah, don't go there, but at the same time this is from 1996. this is like 11 years old, but this documentary is frightening and fascinating and I think the thing that it's very I don't know Inspirational get at the same time horrifying is when they explain what the bio robots were.

474
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,749
Rym: Essentially This was you know This was a disaster of unprecedented proportions and the u.s.

475
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:09,033
Rym: And everyone in the world tried to help.

476
00:30:09,053 --> 00:30:15,625
Rym: and they were trying to use robots because basically there's this big smoldering pit of radioactive death and Strewing around.

477
00:30:15,685 --> 00:30:24,364
Rym: it was radioactive material and they had to get all the radioactive material back into the pit before they could seal it all up and the robots failed.

478
00:30:24,424 --> 00:30:33,292
Rym: they could not push it in with mechanical means and they eventually They decided that the only thing they could do was to use bio robots.

479
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:43,420
Rym: now a bio robot is a very brave human volunteer and They were only allowed to go into this area for one minute or less at a time.

480
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:52,860
Rym: these were military volunteers who basically were briefed and they show you one of their briefings an actual briefing from this unit and It's fright.

481
00:30:52,960 --> 00:31:01,434
Rym: I mean these people basically had to run into a radioactive area with minimal protection and Shovels and just throw as much of this crap into a hole as they could.

482
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:02,920
Scott: why didn't they have more protection?

483
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,232
Rym: because it was Soviet Russia.

484
00:31:05,253 --> 00:31:28,080
Rym: and the other frightening thing is the BBC is there and they're documenting, you know, all the modern efforts in 1996. and When you look at what the Western reporters are wearing for safety equipment Versus what the Russians are wearing and it's not even what the Russian government gave them It's what they were using on their own because they're nuclear scientists and they were smarter than the Russian government.

485
00:31:28,942 --> 00:31:39,959
Rym: I mean the the BBC people are wearing respirators and actual shielded equipment and these scientists are basically duct-taping plastic around their legs And they were in cloth filters.

486
00:31:40,823 --> 00:31:42,971
Rym: Uh-huh, it's uh, it's frightening.

487
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:45,180
Rym: I could go on and on about Soviet Russia.

488
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:52,145
Scott: But then again, I actually you know, there's no question that radioactive stuff is is, you know Horrible and deadly and such.

489
00:31:52,165 --> 00:31:58,747
Scott: but I actually read this study that was somewhat recent and it talked about how radio Radiation horrible and deadly.

490
00:31:58,787 --> 00:32:03,082
Scott: Yes, but not quite as horrible and deadly as we thought, you know It's like.

491
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:10,680
Scott: it's like if there's a piece of plutonium like, you know Maybe sitting in a parking lot You can like sort of run by it really quick and you probably won't get cancer.

492
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,300
Rym: Yeah, it just depends on how much of a dose you get and that's heavy.

493
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,620
Scott: But then again, if you take some plutonium and you sort of play catch with it, you're in trouble.

494
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:20,396
Rym: Well, it also depends on if it's in the air is dust.

495
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:25,059
Rym: because yeah Yep alpha emitters can burn you at close range, but they can't really hurt you beyond that.

496
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:28,396
Rym: But if you inhale alpha emitters, you basically are dead.

497
00:32:28,436 --> 00:32:29,300
Rym: There's nothing that can be done.

498
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:39,808
Scott: basically They examined like you know Statistics and stuff from all these different instances of people being exposed to radiation throughout history and tried to figure out you know Were people really getting cancer?

499
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:41,376
Scott: were they really getting deformities?

500
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:42,040
Scott: were that you know?

501
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,865
Scott: And yes, they were.

502
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:45,029
Scott: but it wasn't.

503
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:51,575
Scott: like anyone who like, you know stood near it for a second was doomed It was like, you know, well, it depends on what the sources it does.

504
00:32:51,615 --> 00:32:52,760
Scott: It depends on many factors.

505
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:53,041
Scott: but

506
00:32:53,081 --> 00:33:08,720
Rym: I mean there there were a lot of accidents even in the US but more so in actually in World War two era Germany and in the Soviet Union where they would Accidentally have a critical mass and someone would be standing too close to it and there be a flash and then feel fine.

507
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,225
Rym: And then two days later, they just die.

508
00:33:10,246 --> 00:33:14,200
Scott: Yep, but then again, you know, that's something there's a critical mass or something going on.

509
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,997
Scott: Well, yes, if there's just like a rock of uranium sitting there you can sort of like, you know Fool around with it a little bit, you know, hold your guy I can count in here and go.

510
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:23,639
Scott: he Just don't do it for like, you know days.

511
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:34,400
Rym: Well, what one thing it does come down to is that generally the more radioactive something is the less time It's going to spend in that ultra radioactive state because it is emitting energy.

512
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,156
Rym: It's not like you're just emitting nothing and it stays radioactive forever.

513
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:42,640
Rym: Yep So theoretically the more dangerous waste is the less time it will spend being dangerous.

514
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:45,475
Rym: But that's all relative and we all show about that.

515
00:33:45,495 --> 00:33:46,380
Scott: Yeah less time.

516
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,516
Scott: So this one has a half-life of a year and that was a half-life of two years.

517
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:50,159
Scott: great.

518
00:33:50,802 --> 00:34:04,579
Rym: But the the end thing here is that you should watch this documentary because it's fascinating and frightening And it also is very inspirational because one thing I can say Chernobyl was the worst nuclear accident in the history of humanity and

519
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,273
Scott: They handled it with basically no resources and lots of incompetence and a lot

520
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,400
Rym: of people were harmed very seriously by this.

521
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:18,672
Rym: but at the same time we've learned a lot and It's almost impossible If not impossible for modern reactors to have a problem.

522
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:25,580
Scott: even close to this magnet and thinking about Chernobyl Which is a shitty-ass reactor had this problem only because people were incredibly stupid.

523
00:34:25,821 --> 00:34:36,260
Rym: Well, it was a combination of people doing things without following proper safety protocol coupled with the fact that the reactor was designed Very poorly and the failure mode was explode.

524
00:34:36,862 --> 00:34:40,954
Rym: Modern like pebble bed reactors the failure mode is fizzle out and just sit there.

525
00:34:40,974 --> 00:34:42,900
Scott: All right, so your computer there, right?

526
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:43,745
Scott: It's got a clock.

527
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:46,280
Scott: All right, you ever wonder how that clock works?

528
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,650
Scott: So I'll tell you how that clock works.

529
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:53,056
Scott: on your motherboard There's basically a wristwatch equivalent of a wristwatch and there's a battery.

530
00:34:53,297 --> 00:34:53,958
Scott: and that's it.

531
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,613
Rym: Well, I mean it depends your computer.

532
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:59,420
Scott: It might be slightly better than a wrist.

533
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,600
Rym: Well, no your computer with that little wristwatch that is only used really when the computer reboots or is turned off.

534
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:07,489
Rym: Yep, it lets the computer when it's off.

535
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:12,691
Rym: There's a little battery in there and it keeps track of the time To within only a resolution of I think one second.

536
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:13,092
Rym: Yep.

537
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:27,800
Scott: I mean, it's basically it's not too accurate It just it just keeps the time and when you turn your computer on your operating system like Windows or Linux or whatever Mac Looks at that wristwatch equivalent and sees what time it is and it starts keeping track of time itself.

538
00:35:27,941 --> 00:35:32,880
Scott: So now when your computer's on and you're using it your Pentium chip or whatever is keeping track of the time.

539
00:35:33,544 --> 00:35:46,215
Scott: And then when your computer you turn it off and you shut it down It writes the time back It tells it sets the wristwatch equivalent again to whatever time it thinks it is because it's probably more correct than the wristwatch Which is kind of shitty.

540
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,543
Rym: Now this is okay.

541
00:35:48,603 --> 00:35:54,368
Rym: But what if you want your computer to actually I don't know Keep track of time all the time?

542
00:35:54,428 --> 00:35:58,564
Rym: you want to know that your computer will always have the right time and always have good Accurate time.

543
00:35:58,604 --> 00:36:02,100
Scott: Well, you can get one of those things where you know, it's you don't have those atomic clocks.

544
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:12,133
Scott: So it's not actually an atomic clock in your house, but you know, the the National Institute of Standards and Technology Broadcasts on radio waves the time in it with a special protocol.

545
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:22,000
Scott: so you can buy a clock that reads those radio signals from the air and Synchronizes itself to the atomic clocks and you could get something like that in your computer.

546
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,680
Scott: So your computer will always have a good time because it listens to the radio now out.

547
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,684
Rym: There's a problem with that.

548
00:36:26,744 --> 00:36:31,000
Rym: Those signals are actually kind of inaccurate and not that useful.

549
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:32,325
Scott: Well, that's true.

550
00:36:32,485 --> 00:36:37,102
Scott: But I mean for a computer who really cares if you have that exact a time You don't need any.

551
00:36:37,183 --> 00:36:38,749
Scott: that exact the time do you?

552
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,497
Rym: well one a lot of people do.

553
00:36:40,557 --> 00:36:43,420
Scott: but before we go I want to talk about the people that do all right.

554
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:52,776
Rym: well before we get to that those clocks are actually not super accurate and that kind that time is mostly used by like Wall clocks that you don't want to have to set the time for.

555
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:58,458
Scott: yep It's not something you can rely on if say, you know to launch the space shuttle at the right time.

556
00:36:58,478 --> 00:37:04,023
Rym: now Most people don't really care as long as like they look at their computer clock as long as it's relatively accurate They don't care.

557
00:37:04,043 --> 00:37:18,774
Rym: and even further a lot of people if you want to set the time They just go into like the gnome thing or in Windows and they click some checkbox that says Keep my time up to date and maybe they put in a name of a server or something and a lot of times There's a default there and they never think of it beyond that.

558
00:37:18,794 --> 00:37:25,700
Scott: Yep, and You know some people, you know, unlike you or me they need to have exact time.

559
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,514
Scott: Why would you need exact time on a computer?

560
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:34,698
Rym: Well for one This is the easiest one and this is one I think everyone can understand because even if you're not a big computer guy It's really useful.

561
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:39,102
Rym: There's something in your computer called the log Log.

562
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:41,431
Rym: keeps track of what your computer's done in Windows.

563
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:42,355
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about it.

564
00:37:42,395 --> 00:37:43,600
Rym: It can get can die in a fire.

565
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,871
Rym: It's the most useless goddamn Pete whatever.

566
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:52,900
Rym: anyway in Linux There's logging and we should do a show about that because a lot of people don't know how to rotate logs.

567
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,109
Scott: Yeah, let's do a show on logs.

568
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,560
Rym: Yeah, but anyway.

569
00:37:56,121 --> 00:38:13,088
Rym: so any time something goes wrong with your computer anytime anything happens in your computer it may or may not make a log entry and If your time is inaccurate Let's say your computer is 10 minutes fast and your computer's logging and going on and the one day you decide oh crap I'm gonna set my computer clock, right?

570
00:38:13,148 --> 00:38:15,517
Rym: So you set it now for 10 minute.

571
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:20,500
Rym: now for 10 minutes It's a logging things in the past.

572
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:28,600
Rym: So it's trying to put log entries in before other log entries and all sorts of bad shit can happen when that happens.

573
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:37,029
Scott: Yeah or Like you might have a file on your computer and the file says I was let I was created at 10 o'clock and I was Last edited at 1030. you.

574
00:38:37,612 --> 00:38:46,253
Scott: but then you realize oh shit My computer's messed up and you set the clock to 950. then you try to edit that file and it says This file was created in the future.

575
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:47,017
Scott: What the fuck.

576
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:56,534
Rym: or Say you have a thing that automatically back stuff up based on timestamps or Always gets the newest version of a file and puts it somewhere like an r-sync kind of deal.

577
00:38:57,437 --> 00:39:00,771
Rym: if your time Changes it might put a file.

578
00:39:00,832 --> 00:39:02,338
Rym: You don't want where it shouldn't be.

579
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:09,444
Scott: Yeah Let's say you write a script and it says if the file on the server is newer than the file on my computer get The file from the server.

580
00:39:10,187 --> 00:39:12,415
Scott: Oh, oh the clock on your computer is fast.

581
00:39:12,515 --> 00:39:12,656
Scott: Now.

582
00:39:12,716 --> 00:39:13,780
Scott: It's not gonna work properly.

583
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,953
Scott: You're gonna write over the server with a bad file.

584
00:39:15,973 --> 00:39:16,858
Scott: You're gonna lose data.

585
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:17,139
Scott: Oh, no.

586
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:29,047
Rym: or if you're using a Fancy authentication like if you're using Kerberos authentication or like Windows Active Directory stuff if the time isn't reasonably accurate Between all your servers and clients.

587
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:31,173
Rym: You just won't be able to authenticate.

588
00:39:31,193 --> 00:39:33,140
Rym: You'll have all sorts of problems.

589
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:36,356
Scott: It'll say hey, you can't log in your time is all screwed up.

590
00:39:36,396 --> 00:39:37,040
Scott: I can't trust you.

591
00:39:37,402 --> 00:39:38,447
Scott: You can't even tell time.

592
00:39:38,487 --> 00:39:39,553
Scott: How do I know you're even a computer?

593
00:39:39,734 --> 00:39:44,845
Rym: Yeah tell ten times It's all ten times now even beyond that A lot of people.

594
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:51,198
Rym: this was a big problem in the 486 days and the Pentium one days where Your computer clock would always just get off for like 10 or 15 minutes.

595
00:39:51,561 --> 00:40:05,180
Rym: And even if you didn't have any of those other problems It was always kind of a pain in the ass to have to keep setting your computer clock and just always knowing that your computer Clock which is supposed to be a billion times faster than that alarm clock on the floor.

596
00:40:05,643 --> 00:40:07,699
Rym: The alarm clock was always a lot more accurate.

597
00:40:08,702 --> 00:40:11,073
Rym: You always had to keep setting it and people always used to complain.

598
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:14,808
Rym: Yeah, my computer's shitty The clock is always all off and there.

599
00:40:14,908 --> 00:40:23,479
Scott: it's even worse when you're someone who actually needs precise time Like what if you're a stock person, you know the market the market has the correct time or what?

600
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:34,500
Scott: If you work at a school the school has this, you know time when the bell is gonna ring And if you're a teacher and the clock you're using is off you're gonna go shit And you're not gonna teach your class at the correct pace.

601
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:47,294
Rym: Actually when I was in middle school that happened once because there was a master clock and it controlled all the slave clocks in the Mm-hmm and some kid for a prank on April 1st Reprogrammed the master clock to run backwards.

602
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:48,140
Scott: Oh, man.

603
00:40:48,803 --> 00:40:53,305
Rym: and it was possibly the most epic thing ever because the Basically it had.

604
00:40:53,606 --> 00:40:55,835
Rym: it had like start the bell at this time.

605
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:58,664
Rym: stop the bell at this time so it's going backwards.

606
00:40:58,905 --> 00:41:04,216
Rym: it would get the stop event right and Then it would get the start event and it wouldn't stop for another 45 minutes.

607
00:41:06,203 --> 00:41:08,458
Rym: It took him an hour to figure out what happened and fix it.

608
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:11,326
Rym: Two years later a kid was much cleverer.

609
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:13,453
Rym: He basically just set the clock.

610
00:41:13,653 --> 00:41:20,360
Rym: He set the clock like five minutes ahead Every period so we all got out of school like 45 minutes early.

611
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:24,700
Scott: Alright, so the bottom line is people need to have accurate time in their computers.

612
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:27,273
Scott: Some people need hideously accurate time in their computers.

613
00:41:27,373 --> 00:41:28,680
Scott: And how do we do this?

614
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,165
Scott: Well, there's a simple way.

615
00:41:30,606 --> 00:41:37,200
Scott: the simple way is this you have one computer connected to an atomic clock with perfect time And then we're not gonna talk about how atomic clock clocks work.

616
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Scott: All you have to know is that they're atomic and they have perfect time now not just atomic clock.

617
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:42,060
Rym: You can actually do this.

618
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:47,840
Rym: You can buy devices that are like they connect to the GPS network and listen to that or they get the time from somewhere.

619
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:55,820
Scott: There are many methods of getting highly accurate time but atomic clocks with you know Degrading radioactive materials in them are the best so far anyway.

620
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:59,960
Scott: So let's say we have a computer connected to the atomic clock directly with a wire.

621
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:03,400
Rym: Actually, I'll just tell you they don't do it based on the degradation so much as the oscillation.

622
00:42:04,323 --> 00:42:08,760
Scott: But that computer has perfect time because it's connected directly to an atomic clock.

623
00:42:09,061 --> 00:42:13,060
Rym: Well perfect time in so far as the atomic clock is correct as far as far as humans have.

624
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:14,811
Rym: Actually, this is important.

625
00:42:14,831 --> 00:42:19,032
Rym: We should talk about this because Time is an arbitrary thing.

626
00:42:19,072 --> 00:42:19,836
Rym: We've made up.

627
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:21,081
Rym: Yes, it is so.

628
00:42:21,161 --> 00:42:32,220
Rym: as a result ho-hum the absolute real work like the time the actual time is Something arbitrary and we can't actually be accurate to the absolute time.

629
00:42:32,521 --> 00:42:37,595
Rym: We can approach the time much like you approach the limit of an equation in calculus.

630
00:42:38,457 --> 00:42:48,754
Rym: Anyway, so it's I'll get to that more when we talk about these protocols because Synchronizing time is something that no one really cares about except one guy.

631
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,279
Rym: Yes, and apparently me.

632
00:42:50,862 --> 00:42:55,550
Scott: Alright, so we have a computer connected directly to a per Effectively perfect clock.

633
00:42:55,832 --> 00:42:57,180
Scott: that computer has perfect time.

634
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:04,127
Scott: Alright now I want my computer to have perfect time and I can't afford one of those perfect clocks to connect it to nor Can I fit one in my house.

635
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,260
Scott: nor would anyone let me because it's radioactive.

636
00:43:07,241 --> 00:43:07,863
Scott: So what do I do?

637
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:12,539
Scott: Well, I go on the internet and I tell my computer to ask that computer what time it is.

638
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:15,391
Scott: So my computer goes hey perfect clock computer.

639
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:15,953
Scott: What time is it?

640
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:17,721
Scott: And that computer says 1030.

641
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:20,028
Scott: Then my computer says okay 1030.

642
00:43:20,028 --> 00:43:23,700
Scott: Guess what that is not going to be horribly perfect.

643
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,919
Scott: I mean, that'll be pretty good, especially if I ask that computer often what time it is.

644
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:33,920
Scott: Well, the problem is it takes time for my question to get from my computer to that computer.

645
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,325
Rym: Oh, it's not just that the problem.

646
00:43:35,425 --> 00:43:39,760
Scott: Oh, I know worse is the problems are real bad, but we're talking about just the beginning problems.

647
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:40,163
Scott: All right.

648
00:43:40,304 --> 00:43:45,309
Rym: This is the first toe in the pool of Let's say my computer every hour just says all right.

649
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,497
Rym: I'm gonna make my time be whatever the atomic clock says.

650
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:53,011
Rym: so Basically every hour my time shifts by some arbitrary amount.

651
00:43:53,051 --> 00:44:02,460
Rym: that could be a large amount depending on how accurate my computer's clock is And we get all the same log problems if I'm doing it manually Yep, and also, you know, you got this big delay.

652
00:44:02,902 --> 00:44:09,590
Scott: So the time I'm asking for the answer I might I might get could be 30 seconds off could be a minute off It could be like an hour off.

653
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,260
Scott: I might ask you get the answer way later.

654
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:19,179
Scott: Who knows it's totally not accurate at all with this crazy Unreliable internet in between me and the very reliable computer with the good clock.

655
00:44:19,842 --> 00:44:21,769
Rym: So there is in fact a protocol.

656
00:44:22,151 --> 00:44:27,225
Rym: This is the world standard basically for distributing time among Computers.

657
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:30,746
Rym: it is called the network time Protocol.

658
00:44:30,826 --> 00:44:33,020
Scott: now gee, that's a creative name there.

659
00:44:33,321 --> 00:44:47,740
Rym: I am somewhat intimately familiar with the network time protocol because I was basically the only person Who was stupid enough to sit down and read all this bullshit and figure out how it worked back at IBM And make a network time protocol in architecture.

660
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:48,422
Scott: Look at you.

661
00:44:48,924 --> 00:44:52,678
Rym: and then I get to my new job and they say all blah blah blah NTP.

662
00:44:52,718 --> 00:44:55,186
Rym: and I said, oh I kind of know some NTP.

663
00:44:55,828 --> 00:44:59,340
Rym: and then I'm doing the same thing here and I know a lot about NTP.

664
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,211
Scott: It's gonna become an NTP specialist.

665
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:14,991
Rym: Well, let me put it this way NTP is probably one of the oldest oldest old school protocols for anything Network wise that is still in use.

666
00:45:15,372 --> 00:45:16,697
Scott: It's pretty crappy and old.

667
00:45:16,938 --> 00:45:21,660
Scott: It's not crappy That's why it works, but it's crappy and its implementation is from a user perspective.

668
00:45:21,982 --> 00:45:24,920
Rym: Well, the thing is from a from a computer perspective.

669
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,677
Rym: Well, I'll get to that.

670
00:45:26,241 --> 00:45:27,464
Rym: You see the net.

671
00:45:27,504 --> 00:45:44,260
Rym: to sum this up because I could go on forever about this the network time protocol was basically written developed Implemented by and is to this day maintained by one guy a man named David L Mills And he's a professor at University of Delaware.

672
00:45:44,721 --> 00:46:05,019
Rym: David L. Mills is also famous for I believe making the first ever FTP Yeah, implementation For making the exterior gateway protocol Yep And that's according to Wikipedia and because I remember this from my history of computing class at RIT The fuzzball router which was basically one of the first routers.

673
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:10,560
Scott: This guy is a pretty important not so well known computer guy.

674
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:12,624
Scott: Maybe we should try to interview him or something I kind of want to.

675
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,700
Rym: I I have I have indirectly spoken with him in the past.

676
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:17,759
Scott: He's definitely one of those old Unix Santas.

677
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,939
Rym: Yes, he's also into ham radio, which is definitely indicative of what kind of person he is.

678
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:22,106
Rym: Yep.

679
00:46:22,661 --> 00:46:31,473
Rym: Now he cared unlike most other people about how accurate the time is and not just you know Is the time the same as the time on that other computer?

680
00:46:31,494 --> 00:46:32,820
Rym: because you can do that in a million ways.

681
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,320
Rym: You can just say I want my time to be the same as that computer.

682
00:46:36,922 --> 00:46:41,700
Rym: But what if you want your time not just to be accurate but to be verifiably accurate?

683
00:46:41,781 --> 00:46:50,800
Rym: Now this is the idea Like that you could use the clock for science Or that it's not so much that your time it's the difference between precision and accuracy.

684
00:46:51,072 --> 00:46:56,540
Rym: Yep And you can have something that is precise and you can have something that is accurate.

685
00:46:57,224 --> 00:47:03,020
Rym: But you can have something that is very accurate but it's not very precise And you can have something that is very precise but it's not very accurate.

686
00:47:03,557 --> 00:47:06,920
Rym: Yep And verifiability matters to a lot of people.

687
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:20,900
Rym: What if you're in some sort of government military thing And you need to be able to not just say what time it is But you need to be able to say that I am confident to within this percentage That the time is this accurate?

688
00:47:20,982 --> 00:47:31,260
Rym: You know like statistics You want to be able to go to an auditor or go to a report and say I can vouch mathematically that the time was accurate to this degree at this time.

689
00:47:32,823 --> 00:47:34,840
Rym: And that's kind of recursive like the rocket equation.

690
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:37,019
Rym: The time was accurate to this degree at this time.

691
00:47:37,382 --> 00:47:38,995
Rym: But how do I determine that time?

692
00:47:39,116 --> 00:47:47,100
Rym: oh snap And basically the method of doing that is incredibly obtuse.

693
00:47:48,162 --> 00:48:11,320
Rym: You see if you ever think oh I just want my time to sync up to another computer And you think oh I'll just run NTP and it'll just work Well you're in for a. you're in for a journey You're in for an epic quest to go through the fact that the documentation for the network time protocol Has effectively not changed since it was written by David L Mills And in fact I believe he still maintains the official NTP website.

694
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,760
Scott: You should write RIMS better than David Mills NTP documentation.

695
00:48:15,182 --> 00:48:25,720
Rym: You see I'm not going to get into all this but NTP is complicated Suffice to say Well mostly because NTP doesn't just keep you know clocks accurate.

696
00:48:26,182 --> 00:48:36,140
Scott: It's a system by which every computer in the world that's connected Could theoretically in a distributed fashion all help each other to keep correct time.

697
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:47,539
Rym: So to sum it up really really really lightly And it may be someday we'll do a few a show just on NTP As opposed to on time sync in general because I think I could fill a whole hour with this.

698
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:56,557
Rym: Basically what you have is you have the root source which is like NIST And then you have a stratum one source And the stratum will go up.

699
00:48:57,041 --> 00:49:01,620
Rym: So stratum one is like the NIST computer that's connected to the NIST atomic clock.

700
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:06,764
Rym: Then you have stratum two devices which are like NTP.pool.org Those people.

701
00:49:06,804 --> 00:49:17,119
Rym: that's like an open source time pool And then your computer would be stratum three let's say Because it connects to the pool and the pool connects to NIST And this looks at its atomic clock.

702
00:49:17,724 --> 00:49:28,740
Rym: You can't query the atomic clock directly because You're not there Yes and you shouldn't query the the stratum one NIST server directly Because everyone in the world's trying to look at that thing.

703
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:33,473
Rym: And if you if your piddly little network keeps hammering this thing They're just going to block you.

704
00:49:33,494 --> 00:49:33,999
Rym: they don't care.

705
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:35,183
Scott: So you

706
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:49,860
Rym: want to and also it's not really that useful to query that thing Because the way NTP works is that even though you're you know Four five six stratoms away from the atomic clock The NTP system is such that you can still say that your time is verifiably accurate.

707
00:49:50,650 --> 00:50:00,711
Rym: And in fact even very far away from the stratum zero atomic clock You can guarantee that your clock will be accurate to within 100 milliseconds or so Which is good enough for 99 of human beings.

708
00:50:02,721 --> 00:50:04,919
Scott: Yep even military people are just fine with that.

709
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:06,760
Rym: Uh well yeah it depends.

710
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:07,399
Rym: And scientists?

711
00:50:08,007 --> 00:50:09,482
Rym: Well again it depends It does.

712
00:50:09,663 --> 00:50:18,840
Scott: I'm sure the people would say the hadron collider need better time But maybe the guy in his lab you know timing his uh incubating uh flu is fine.

713
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:33,660
Rym: But the way NTP works in a very very uh simply described way Is that instead of just changing your clock on intervals It will use a bunch of math to figure out how different it is from whatever your time source is.

714
00:50:34,142 --> 00:50:40,220
Rym: And also it'll try to figure out if you have multiple sources Which of those sources is the most likely to be accurate.

715
00:50:40,884 --> 00:50:51,139
Rym: And then from all this information it'll figure out who wants to sync to And it'll make sub tick like these gradual changes to your clock over time To keep it always accurate to within a certain degree.

716
00:50:51,921 --> 00:50:57,640
Rym: It'll add fractions of time so small that your logger would never even be able to tell the difference.

717
00:50:58,562 --> 00:51:02,000
Rym: So as a result your computer cannot tell that the time is changing.

718
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:20,060
Scott: Yep like if your computer let's say your computer's a minute slow right It won't just add a minute of time to your computer It'll add like a fraction of a second and then add another fraction of a second And then maybe a little while later add another fraction of a second And it'll make your computer slightly faster and faster and faster until it has the right time.

719
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:28,479
Scott: And then if your computer's running say you know your computer thinks one second is this long But really a second is a little bit longer than that.

720
00:51:28,982 --> 00:51:32,640
Scott: It'll just add that little bit of a second every every second or so.

721
00:51:32,761 --> 00:51:36,127
Scott: And then you you know every hour whatever And your computer from you.

722
00:51:36,147 --> 00:51:41,480
Scott: look if you looked at your computer's clock and sat there watching it You would never know that the time was changing.

723
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:50,854
Scott: It'd be like one two three but portions of a second would be being added and subtracted From that clock all the time or pretty frequently.

724
00:51:50,954 --> 00:51:52,360
Scott: so the clock was always accurate.

725
00:51:53,681 --> 00:52:06,299
Rym: So to skip over all the details beyond that I am going to do a show on this in the future If you're interested because I think the world needs a simple explanation of how to Test and query and use NTP because it's easy to make it run.

726
00:52:06,982 --> 00:52:11,060
Rym: It's hard unless you read the documentation to know if it's working properly.

727
00:52:11,582 --> 00:52:20,809
Scott: Windows if you want to have if you want your computer to sync up you go to date and time And you there's a button that's like synchronize with my time with internet servers And Ubuntu does the same thing.

728
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:23,486
Scott: you say synchronize my time with internet servers And that's it.

729
00:52:23,506 --> 00:52:23,811
Scott: you're done.

730
00:52:23,831 --> 00:52:25,344
Rym: hooray Now that'll work.

731
00:52:25,424 --> 00:52:33,960
Rym: okay but if you really want to have a good set of time what you really should do Is basically on a linux server and you can run NTP on windows and it works just fine.

732
00:52:34,341 --> 00:52:37,552
Rym: But on linux just edit the file it's etc.

733
00:52:38,053 --> 00:52:38,996
Rym: and then NTP.conf.

734
00:52:41,081 --> 00:52:42,265
Rym: It's pretty simple.

735
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:51,560
Rym: just look at it and there'll be a directive like in there you'll see The word server a space and then just a DNS name of an NTP server.

736
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:56,454
Rym: What you want to put there is something like NTP.pool.org NTP1.pool.org.

737
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:12,104
Rym: Put a bunch of NTP pool whatever servers I'll probably link to something that explains this And then make sure by whatever means you do on your linux distribution that NTPD is running And that's it.

738
00:53:12,486 --> 00:53:15,056
Rym: and you might wonder but how is it working?

739
00:53:15,076 --> 00:53:15,839
Rym: is it working well?

740
00:53:15,879 --> 00:53:16,140
Rym: is it doing?

741
00:53:16,502 --> 00:53:19,719
Rym: Don't worry about that it's working just don't just just go with it.

742
00:53:20,861 --> 00:53:28,860
Scott: Yeah the worst is when you know you think it's working but like you know it's running yet somehow Your computer's clock is just completely batshit crazy.

743
00:53:29,302 --> 00:53:34,686
Rym: Well actually the thing that'll cause that most often is if you Are dual boot between windows and linux.

744
00:53:34,887 --> 00:53:38,860
Rym: yeah because you see the hardware clock will save it.

745
00:53:39,221 --> 00:53:43,819
Rym: You'll basically save the time to your hardware clock when you shut down the computer.

746
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:48,113
Rym: Windows and linux will save it in a different format.

747
00:53:48,173 --> 00:53:55,575
Rym: windows will save it in the local time And unix will save it in uh Greenwich mean time universal time yep.

748
00:53:56,176 --> 00:54:01,420
Rym: so as a result if you boot Between windows and linux oftentimes the clock will just go ah shit and go all over the place.

749
00:54:01,942 --> 00:54:10,320
Rym: Now the way around that is basically if you're dual booting you should probably just tell linux To save everything in local time because you're not going to change windows's mind.

750
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:15,989
Scott: Yeah I think Ubuntu uses local time but something like Gentoo might not unless you can.

751
00:54:16,049 --> 00:54:18,300
Rym: definitely doesn't you have to configure it properly.

752
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:23,946
Rym: Yeah well yeah I'm pretty sure Ubuntu does because I've rebooted into windows and I haven't had a Problem when I came back into linux.

753
00:54:24,046 --> 00:54:29,211
Rym: yep yeah beyond that if you have questions about this You can just post in our forum and I'll answer them all.

754
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:35,537
Rym: but uh beyond that if you want to hear How NTP really works or how to use all those don't try to read the NTP website.

755
00:54:35,597 --> 00:54:36,882
Scott: good god just start Yourself.

756
00:54:36,963 --> 00:54:38,089
Rym: if you really want to know let me know.

757
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:38,934
Rym: we'll do a show about it.

758
00:54:38,974 --> 00:54:49,932
Rym: but basically there's NTP queue and there's NTP DC and they both do the same thing kinda and there's NTP stat which is Probably the easiest one to use but at the same time it's not the greatest tool.

759
00:54:49,992 --> 00:54:56,291
Rym: and uh but yeah I guess the moral here is that magic just to tell time.

760
00:54:56,792 --> 00:55:12,076
Rym: the moral here is that sometimes things that You would think should be simple and easy you know synchronizing a clock to another thing Are actually behind the scenes incredibly complex because there's all these factors that If you just thought about it on a superficial level you wouldn't think about.

761
00:55:12,096 --> 00:55:26,788
Rym: you wouldn't think About the logs or the file creation dates being out of sync because these are all very Like minutia details problems but yet they're very very important and a lot of people don't realize That a lot of things in computing are like that.

762
00:55:26,808 --> 00:55:31,951
Scott: yep and that's what separates the high quality Computer people from the low quality computer people.

763
00:55:31,991 --> 00:55:41,237
Scott: you'll see someone who thinks about those Things you know will go to change something on a server and they'll think about it and they'll Figure out every possible side effect and then when they change it nothing will go wrong.

764
00:55:41,257 --> 00:55:44,273
Scott: yet Someone else will go and just change something on a server.

765
00:55:44,293 --> 00:55:46,203
Scott: then all these side effects happen and There's a problem.

766
00:55:46,224 --> 00:55:52,965
Rym: they can't figure it out and then they find it later they go oh and then you Get those posts and forums like uh why my logs back date.

767
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:54,488
Rym: i use ntp.

768
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:04,504
