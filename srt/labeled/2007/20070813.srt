1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,499
Scott: It's Monday August 13th.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,622
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:16,248
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,570
Scott: anonymity's on to Internet's.

5
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:25,377
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,759
Rym: So I realized something just now that I never really thought about before.

7
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:36,119
Rym: you know We always have you know an anecdote or something interesting at the start of the show.

8
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:41,173
Rym: well This weekend we mostly just relaxed and last weekend.

9
00:00:41,193 --> 00:00:42,536
Rym: We also just kind of relaxed.

10
00:00:42,596 --> 00:00:44,060
Rym: so nothing crazy happened.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,760
Rym: We didn't go anywhere, and we kind of didn't do anything interesting enough to warrant this sort of leader.

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,984
Rym: Hey, how's your day bit?

13
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:52,469
Scott: I got a haircut.

14
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,660
Scott: my hair is they're shorter and more comfortable.

15
00:00:56,283 --> 00:00:57,206
Rym: You also got your bike.

16
00:00:57,427 --> 00:00:58,974
Rym: well you tried to get your bike fixed.

17
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:08,086
Scott: well basically my bike You know it's in perfect working order except There's a crack in the frame and the guy at the bike shop was really like There's a tiny crack in the frame.

18
00:01:08,126 --> 00:01:09,731
Scott: you probably shouldn't ride that at all.

19
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:11,657
Scott: and he's kind of right.

20
00:01:11,777 --> 00:01:12,159
Scott: kind of.

21
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:15,914
Rym: He's right in the sense that if it weren't Scott.

22
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:17,320
Rym: I'd say you should throw that bike away.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,720
Rym: It's dangerous, but Scott rides really leisurely, and he doesn't really push the bike.

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,010
Rym: It's not like he's gonna suddenly worst case the bike.

25
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,680
Rym: you just kind of sag down and Scott would come to a stop and go oh Yep, so and everything else works.

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,267
Scott: You know the gears and the brakes and all that business and the guy was like yeah If you want me to you know I want.

27
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:47,891
Scott: basically it was out in the in in the winter Outside because we don't remember to put it inside and I had it under a tarp which wasn't good enough apparently And that's how I got sort of rusty and slightly damaged.

28
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:52,447
Scott: and all I need is you know to like replace the brake and the gear Cables and tighten them up and whatever.

29
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,316
Scott: and the grips the hand grips on the handlebars are all sticky So you just need to replace those with ones that aren't sticky.

30
00:01:58,497 --> 00:02:05,274
Rym: yep now I mean, I'm kind of a bike guy, and I could do this for Scott, but One thing I learned as a kid is that while

31
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:05,536
Scott: it is

32
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:12,520
Rym: very Simple to do these things in terms of you know what you have to manipulate It really sucks to do it just in general.

33
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:17,575
Scott: It's also very difficult to get it in done in such a way where it's like new.

34
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:19,400
Scott: it's always slightly ghetto.

35
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:26,490
Rym: Well partly because I don't have all the right tools like I don't have the mount for the bike so I can just mount it Up and spin the gears and twist the little calibrate you bid.

36
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,380
Rym: so it's kind of like I know how to change my oil.

37
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:34,034
Rym: It's not worth the time it takes to change my oil to change my oil.

38
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:35,539
Rym: I'll pay the valvoline guy yep.

39
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:44,440
Scott: So he was like yeah something something And I think he he said it was gonna be $100 just for the tune-up and stuff just to discourage me from using the bike.

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,050
Scott: Anymore that is possibly to try to sell me a new one.

41
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:54,560
Rym: that is almost certainly true because the last time I was there I was charged like 40 bucks for exactly what you asked for on a much more complicated bike.

42
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,189
Scott: Yeah, so I figure what I'll do is all you know.

43
00:02:58,209 --> 00:02:59,151
Scott: I don't ride that much.

44
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:06,293
Scott: I'll ride this thing around whatever not too hard and Maybe I'll take it to Wildwood put it out to pasture.

45
00:03:06,513 --> 00:03:08,019
Scott: Maybe I'll sell it buy a new one.

46
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:09,589
Rym: Wildwood I think is a good place to put it.

47
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,920
Rym: It'll have a good retirement thing.

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,589
Scott: Yeah, maybe I could get a hundred bucks for it.

49
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,660
Scott: Maybe I mean every other part on it is fine.

50
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,559
Rym: I don't know.

51
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:28,284
Rym: I'd be leery about selling that to anyone even telling them that there's something wrong with it because No one who know understands how dangerous that is would buy it and the only people who are left are people who don't really understand That that's dangerous.

52
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:30,231
Scott: Yeah, maybe like next year.

53
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:35,635
Scott: I'll just bring it to Wildwood leave it there Use it there cuz that's just the thing is.

54
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:37,779
Scott: like it Wildwood I have a desire to bike a lot.

55
00:03:38,162 --> 00:03:41,297
Scott: Like if I had it there, I'd probably bike up and down the boardwalk with it all the time.

56
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,553
Rym: god I remember I biked up and down the boardwalk once or twice in all these years, and it was fantastic.

57
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:52,940
Scott: Yeah, it's straight flat Slightly bumpy good traction lots of things to die.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,583
Rym: Well what it was?

59
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:57,200
Rym: it was that mom go real fast way back when I lived there with Scott for that month.

60
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,288
Rym: Not this Scott the other Scott those Scott.

61
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:04,729
Rym: you were here there for what like two weeks or so a while a while but it was just me and Scojo and his dad.

62
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:17,160
Rym: and we just lived there at the beach house for a while and I had All of my worldly possessions except my furniture in my car all of them as in You could only see out of half of the windshield and part of the driver's side window.

63
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:17,673
Rym: That was it.

64
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:25,459
Rym: The car was totally full and I had stuff on the roof and I had stuff on the back and I had my bike with Me on a bike carrier barely hanging on.

65
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:30,719
Rym: So, of course, I rode that bike as much as I could in Wildwood because I never brought a bike there again.

66
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:32,940
Scott: Yeah, I just wonder how I'm gonna get it there.

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:40,680
Scott: Basically, we'd have to go to Wildwood with only two people and my car and not so much other stuff besides my bike.

68
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:45,883
Rym: We could do it with three people if we disassembled your bike the rest of the way It's still.

69
00:04:46,184 --> 00:04:47,027
Scott: it's a pain in the ass.

70
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:58,819
Rym: then if like you mean Emily go down later and like at the end of summer we Could do it then very difficult and or we could just bite the bullet and buy a bike carrier That isn't shitty or take two cars.

71
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,029
Rym: That would.

72
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,380
Rym: my car is not going anywhere.

73
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:08,250
Rym: Yeah, I mean, let me put it this way selling my car to anyone because Emily actually asked a while ago Hey, I need a car when you get a new car.

74
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,094
Rym: I'll buy your old car.

75
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:16,220
Rym: I Would feel about as comfortable selling my car to anyone as Scott should feel selling his bike to anyone.

76
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:17,489
Scott: Yeah, what do you do?

77
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:18,980
Scott: The bike was cheap.

78
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:23,254
Scott: I bought it cheap and I got a whole bunch of use out of it when it was new.

79
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:23,315
Scott: it

80
00:05:23,676 --> 00:05:34,193
Rym: does say something though in That if you are serious about something and you want to buy a piece of equipment that lasts Spend the money and get exactly what you want because I've been using and

81
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:43,844
Scott: if you're not serious about something And you're gonna leave it out in the winter You probably shouldn't spend too much money on it because you're not gonna take care of it because you don't care as much and it's Gonna break.

82
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:46,060
Rym: Yeah, I mean think you spent a couple hundred bucks on that.

83
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,113
Rym: Imagine if you'd spent eight hundred bucks on it and then it broke like that.

84
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:54,040
Scott: if I spent eight hundred bucks on it I would never have left it outside even in the greatest summer day in the universe.

85
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:58,704
Rym: So, but I mean look I spent that much money on my boy I didn't.

86
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:00,060
Scott: my sort of a two-way deal.

87
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:11,497
Scott: Whereas if you care more you should spend more but also if you spend more if you care about money And you're not just a stupidly rich person with money to burn You're going to care more as a result of your spending more.

88
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:18,387
Rym: man I was so careful with that bike when I was a kid and I first got it, but you know 13 years later I just leave it outside.

89
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:19,272
Rym: I haven't.

90
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:20,640
Rym: I've never replaced the chain.

91
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,595
Scott: I think your deal is the same deal you had with your DS.

92
00:06:23,635 --> 00:06:24,660
Scott: is you wanted a DS light?

93
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,303
Scott: So you let you.

94
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:27,354
Scott: you treated the DS like shit till it broke.

95
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:28,400
Scott: and you know, you want a new bike.

96
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,773
Scott: So you're waiting for your bike to die.

97
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:32,040
Scott: So you have an excuse to buy a new one.

98
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,480
Rym: See the thing is I don't I actually take care of that bike.

99
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,473
Rym: It's one of the few things I really take care of.

100
00:06:36,513 --> 00:06:37,319
Rym: not like my car.

101
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,920
Scott: Yeah, I take you're much more expensive car that you finally paid off.

102
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:47,100
Rym: I've spent a lot more time working on and repairing my bike than even mechanics have spent on my car.

103
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,760
Scott: Yeah, but think about the the trouble you've had with that car.

104
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,011
Rym: It was repoed and had nothing to do with the car.

105
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:57,148
Scott: that I do with the back went through all that shit for that car And now you're just like ah, fuck it.

106
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:57,611
Scott: You know what?

107
00:06:57,692 --> 00:06:58,960
Rym: I didn't go through that for the car.

108
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,136
Rym: I went through that because society requires that I own a car.

109
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:08,400
Rym: Yeah The car I mean, you know, you could say oh everything has a spirit and I I should love my car.

110
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,444
Rym: I put effort into that carpet.

111
00:07:09,464 --> 00:07:09,766
Rym: No fuck.

112
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:11,915
Scott: No, you shouldn't you're crazy.

113
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:15,955
Scott: It has no feelings Right.

114
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:21,097
Rym: Wow, I guess that boring thing about your bike was actually a pretty good opening bit.

115
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:23,827
Scott: well You know, there was nothing else happened this.

116
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:24,710
Rym: what else do we do?

117
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:25,674
Scott: Nothing we.

118
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:27,320
Rym: I played some vidya game.

119
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:29,955
Scott: I beat like two levels in Paper Mario.

120
00:07:30,257 --> 00:07:33,996
Rym: I caught Some Pokemon played some Mario strikers.

121
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:41,326
Scott: I Watched some FPS with Emily Alex and Scott the next Horatio hornblower The next one that I've never seen.

122
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:50,377
Rym: God the short story here is simply that we like Horatio hornblower And we watch it kind of like as this event among the group You know yelling and screaming and cheering and just enjoying it.

123
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:58,333
Rym: And all these years I've only seen up to a certain point and I've never five episodes Yeah, and no one in our crew was seen past that point.

124
00:07:58,574 --> 00:07:59,960
Scott: So we got to watch the sixth episode.

125
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,964
Scott: Let's watch it today.

126
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:02,531
Rym: I don't know I got stuff to do.

127
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:03,375
Rym: We know you don't.

128
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,089
Rym: I gotta watch gang kotsuo But you could find out what happens.

129
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:07,900
Rym: I know but I kind of want to hold off.

130
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:09,957
Scott: What do you want to hold off for laudanum?

131
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:16,280
Scott: See there are situations in lives where you can't hold out a lot of addiction you'll go crazy.

132
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:19,028
Rym: I'm not gonna give a specific start thinking lamps have feelings.

133
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:24,525
Rym: There is one kind of thing one action you can take in life Occasionally something I enjoy.

134
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:31,263
Rym: that if you build up and build up and just let the event as they build it up for years Yeah, and you know what?

135
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,510
Rym: I've learned that there's no limit to how much.

136
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:34,373
Scott: there is a limit.

137
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,964
Scott: certain things pretty much built up to The max.

138
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,419
Rym: no because it was built up to the man charge.

139
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,113
Scott: If you push the button again, it will be released.

140
00:08:42,173 --> 00:08:43,460
Scott: You cannot charge it up anymore.

141
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,779
Rym: I think I can charge it up a little more.

142
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,585
Scott: You can't charge it up ten more.

143
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:57,213
Rym: if we watched the last episode that we just watched again with a group of people Then we would enhance the experience by bringing more people in a folder.

144
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,380
Scott: that would just create another feeling of frustration.

145
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,956
Rym: It would fill up a different meter if you couldn't tell I was trying to make a sexual metaphor here.

146
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,000
Scott: god too bad.

147
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:06,987
Scott: Let's talk about technologies.

148
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:13,235
Rym: Alright, I'll do my news first because I don't have much to say about it And Scott's news is much more important.

149
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:13,818
Scott: Uh-huh.

150
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:23,113
Rym: So there's this article on slash shot that was actually in PC world about how OMG vista takes your high-quality HD content and fucks it.

151
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:25,640
Scott: and oh this is so terrible.

152
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:32,660
Scott: Oh vista the worst thing ever You know, I used Vista for two weeks because it came with my laptop And of course, I don't use it anymore.

153
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:37,740
Scott: But when I used it, it was just normal windows with some fancy stuff on it.

154
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,530
Scott: There wasn't anything weird going on that.

155
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:41,060
Scott: I noticed it was just windows.

156
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:45,140
Rym: Well, the thing is I'm not going to speak from a point of authority because I don't know a lot about Vista.

157
00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:46,259
Rym: I don't really care about it.

158
00:09:46,701 --> 00:10:00,539
Rym: I only use XP because it's easier to install XP with my legitimate license than it is to install Windows 2000 with my also legitimate license that certain people Accidentally stole from me and never gave back.

159
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:09,580
Scott: Yeah, and meanwhile As much as we're super Linux users, we have a 2000 license and an XP license and a vista license and they're all legitimate.

160
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:12,406
Rym: We're just not pirates anymore.

161
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:13,007
Rym: What can I say?

162
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:15,315
Rym: Yeah, I like to play steam games.

163
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:16,940
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't quite work.

164
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:20,111
Scott: I've suddenly been playing a lot of steam suddenly.

165
00:10:20,332 --> 00:10:22,600
Rym: We'll talk about that tomorrow, but yeah, oh, man.

166
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:30,540
Rym: But this article as far as I can tell is pretty much just FUD fear uncertainty and doubt.

167
00:10:30,703 --> 00:10:31,459
Rym: It's just bullshit.

168
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:45,000
Rym: I mean while it is true that Vista has a bunch of DRM stuff in it and HD content that is flagged in a certain way or in a certain format Will be downgraded if you put it over an interface like DVI that isn't set up for encryption.

169
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:47,627
Scott: Yeah You need the HDMI that has the.

170
00:10:47,847 --> 00:11:09,040
Scott: so that way basically what they're trying to prevent with this DRM technology is it's Technologically feasible for someone to say put a DRM DVD in their DVD player play it But then take the video output cable from the DVD player Put it into another the input on a recording device and record it at that point.

171
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,228
Scott: So what they do is that's why HDMI exists.

172
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:18,620
Scott: HDMI isn't really any better than component video or DVI But DVI plus bullshit.

173
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:25,639
Rym: It's kind of like if you had a standard like I don't know the little headphone jack used for audio And then you just put a little bit of feces on the end of it.

174
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:26,869
Rym: Yeah doesn't enhance this.

175
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,080
Rym: all it does is cause trouble.

176
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:40,580
Scott: It just encrypt it makes it encrypted so that if you have a DVD player and you use the HDMI cable It's actually sort of impossible because of encryption without some sort of you know decrypting key.

177
00:11:41,142 --> 00:11:45,660
Scott: Of course, we have those but to record from the HDMI cable.

178
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:54,340
Scott: The only way it works is if you plug it into an HDMI Compatible monitor and then it will play at the full HD resolution.

179
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:59,259
Scott: Otherwise if the player recognizes that you're not using HDMI, it won't do HD.

180
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,420
Scott: It'll do some lower quality because that way you can't steal the HD content.

181
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,358
Scott: You can only steal the low res content.

182
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:12,820
Rym: now This guy seems to be making the point that all HD content is hurt in this way by Vista.

183
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:29,200
Rym: But I'm generally of the impression now, correct me if I'm wrong internet but I think that the only time Vista will downgrade the quality is if the content you were trying to play is In some way encrypted in DRM by the person who made it in the first place.

184
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,401
Rym: yeah,

185
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:51,065
Scott: I mean if I download an x-vid that's at a ludicrous resolution and I play it with like VLC or M player or maybe even Windows Media Player and I have the right codex and I full screen it On my HD screen or my computer monitor and I have just a VGA cable or a DVI cable It's gonna be HD.

186
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:53,230
Scott: I think yes, I think so.

187
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:55,996
Rym: I'm pretty sure that this guy's full of crap.

188
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:56,557
Scott: Yeah.

189
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:12,193
Rym: Oh Well, yeah, so just as much as I am generally indifferent to Windows and now I generally prefer Linux It does bother me sometimes that people who are pro Linux or pro open source get a little bit Sensationalistic about oh my god Microsoft is how evil.

190
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:14,299
Rym: so evil and it's not always true.

191
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:22,458
Rym: Granted they did bow down and let this DRM stuff get into Windows But at the same time there's a very easy way to circumvent all of this DRM.

192
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:24,225
Rym: It's very simple.

193
00:13:24,265 --> 00:13:26,874
Rym: And in fact all of you can do it no matter what your technological skill.

194
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:30,042
Rym: don't buy DRM content.

195
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:40,746
Rym: if something's DRM and you want to watch it don't watch something that isn't DRM or go on the bit torrents and get the same thing without DRM on it.

196
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:41,449
Scott: Yeah.

197
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:42,756
Scott: Yeah Okay, right.

198
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:44,729
Rym: So, uh in the big news.

199
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:46,904
Scott: So back in what year?

200
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:49,434
Scott: 2003?

201
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:51,605
Rym: I think we were still at RIT.

202
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:55,697
Rym: It was a long Time ago, I hadn't even worked at IBM.

203
00:13:55,737 --> 00:13:55,958
Rym: yet

204
00:13:56,098 --> 00:14:11,969
Scott: back in the days before dig way back back in the day Slashdot was synonymous with technology news and we would basically We just reload slash dot like 20 times a day Maybe 20 times an hour if you're really bored because that was the only place where the news was

205
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,190
Rym: at.

206
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:16,523
Rym: I really only went to two websites back then slash dot and Fark and penny arcade.

207
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:18,690
Rym: Well, I don't have webcomics as websites.

208
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:20,330
Scott: Penny arcade is different.

209
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:27,550
Scott: But anyway, yes It was all about slash dot in those days and slash dot had a lot of news stories that would recur.

210
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:48,115
Scott: They would come up often as new developments came out and one of these news stories was about SCO a company called SEO and I'm not gonna tell you all the details because you can get every detail down to every single thing that ever happened in the court at Grok law as well as other websites, but basically SEO is a company.

211
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:59,009
Scott: It was a company that made some Unix's kind of and the company really didn't do that much other than Make some business deals and sue people.

212
00:14:59,732 --> 00:14:59,932
Scott: so

213
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:18,930
Rym: in addition to all that what I mean the real crux of the issue was that a lot of people contributed a lot to Unix back in the day and the actual State of who contributed what and who had rights over what was really kind of murky Yep, and as a result opportunist idiots like yet.

214
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:30,585
Rym: Well, maybe not idiots because I think a lot of them made a lot of money off of this Decided that hey because of this murky legal crap Let's sue people who use Linux which is based on Unix for a lot of money.

215
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,010
Scott: It's not even based on Unix.

216
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:36,483
Rym: Well, the thing is what they actually sued over was hey, you're using Linux.

217
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:38,690
Rym: Well that infringes on all of our Unix stuff.

218
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:41,401
Scott: That's not really what they sued over so much.

219
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:43,370
Rym: I what specifically did they sue over?

220
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:54,792
Scott: They basically said, you know back in the day they licensed Unix right from I guess no valor AT&T or someone or Bell lab Who knows?

221
00:15:54,892 --> 00:15:58,063
Scott: I guess no one's really sure who owns the Unix really.

222
00:15:58,364 --> 00:16:00,050
Scott: and that's what this court case is all about.

223
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,809
Scott: So they said we own Unix.

224
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,653
Scott: Anyone Unixing?

225
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:04,555
Scott: we own you.

226
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:06,080
Scott: You can't be Unixing.

227
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,369
Scott: We're Unixing and they sued like, you know, no val and IBM and such.

228
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:11,713
Scott: and How many years later?

229
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:15,163
Scott: but at least four years possibly more than four years later.

230
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:15,966
Scott: the court.

231
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:22,577
Scott: This is the news by the way the court finally said Novell owns Unix not you.

232
00:16:23,018 --> 00:16:24,582
Scott: they just licensed Unix to you.

233
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:27,230
Scott: you you're allowed to use Unix.

234
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,677
Scott: Well, the thing is you anyone.

235
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:40,310
Rym: it got really more weird because SEO I mean the people there must have known that this was a crap fraudulent case Because they basically sued but had no evidence and then over the course of the court case.

236
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:43,709
Rym: They kept trying to force IBM to provide evidence to them.

237
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:48,110
Rym: So they'd say like yes somewhere in their code is our code.

238
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:51,168
Rym: Tell them to give us all their code so we can find it.

239
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,621
Scott: Yeah, how do you know it's there if you haven't seen it?

240
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:57,149
Rym: and they'd say oh we know we know it's there.

241
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,195
Rym: Yeah, and it just got crazier and crazier and crazier.

242
00:17:01,276 --> 00:17:07,358
Rym: They were talking about suing everyone who's ever used a Star nix or anything and they were just going all over the place.

243
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:16,231
Rym: Everyone's getting nutty anything with nix in it and even worse the the I mean the amount of money that they sued IBM for was Staggering.

244
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:19,182
Scott: well the amount of money they were attempting to sue I've.

245
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:20,185
Rym: well they did sue.

246
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:21,089
Rym: they just lost.

247
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:26,704
Scott: Yeah, they very much the amount of money you're suing for determined after this winner or loser.

248
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:27,185
Scott: Nah.

249
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:33,203
Rym: No, it's kind of like how Bill Clinton was impeached, but he was not kicked out of office.

250
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:34,670
Rym: He was impeached.

251
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:42,369
Rym: However, all right, but the thing is when the news first broke way back They were like SEO is suing IBM.

252
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:51,990
Rym: Ha this isn't gonna last long because anyone who knew anything about technology knew pretty much immediately That it was completely fraudulent and not true and that there's no way they could win.

253
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,469
Scott: No, none of it was true pretty much at all.

254
00:17:55,052 --> 00:18:09,489
Scott: and over the years there was so many different FUD stories about this court case like oh Well, if this hat this is just Microsoft trying to make people feel Unsafe about using Linux to make it sort of a legal gray area.

255
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:15,727
Rym: A lot of people thought that Microsoft was secretly funding SEO and while they might have been it doesn't really matter.

256
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:35,126
Scott: Yeah, and Basically this tiny little shit court case by this crazy back-of-the-middle-of-nowhere company turned into like this huge thing for the whole open-source world and it went on for years and people kept paying attention to it until People stopped reading slash dot and then people stopped caring about it because they stopped paying attention to it.

257
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:36,210
Rym: because I've forgotten about it.

258
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,770
Scott: The only reason people paid attention to it is because slash dot wouldn't shut up about it and everyone read slash dot.

259
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:45,270
Rym: Well, the funny thing was in the real world like people every now and then the news would come off and people would care.

260
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:54,008
Rym: but the only reason this case took as long as it did was that Everyone who knew about technology knew it was crap and could just snap their fingers and say wow I'm done with that.

261
00:18:54,471 --> 00:19:01,250
Rym: But the legal system had not a single person involved in it who knew enough to succinctly explain what was going on to a judge.

262
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:12,199
Scott: Yeah I remember how people used to talk about SEOs just trying to get bought by IBM and then IBM didn't buy them IBM, to their credit And they wanted to like maybe like, you know What's it called?

263
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,787
Scott: They wanted to Settle?

264
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,121
Scott: Yeah, settle and not.

265
00:19:16,444 --> 00:19:17,230
Scott: that didn't happen either.

266
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,887
Rym: See, luckily they miscalculated because I did work at IBM for a while and I liked working there.

267
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:37,290
Rym: and all I really want to say Is that IBM does not take shit lying down and as a corporation if someone causes them grief And it's big enough and it's malicious I get the impression that IBM would actually spend more money to destroy them.

268
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:39,358
Rym: Then they would have to spend settling with them.

269
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:42,430
Rym: They would rather destroy their enemies than pacify them.

270
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,829
Rym: Haha, and when SEO went up and bit their toe IBM just stomped on them.

271
00:19:47,371 --> 00:19:54,709
Scott: Yep, so basically this bullshit where for years and years and years and years and years we've known that It's all bullshit.

272
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,650
Scott: Finally the court said SEO you got nothing and they got nothing.

273
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:09,210
Rym: now the thing is I think a lot of people made a lot of money off of this because the Stock and SEO went up and up and up when they first made these lawsuits and then anyway down and down and down and down.

274
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:17,930
Rym: But it kind of leveled off and every now and then it would get a surge as SEO would say something people who didn't know About technology would say oh they're gonna win that case now and then they're gonna be gigantic.

275
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:25,359
Rym: But now down the shitter pretty much the day as soon as the announcement was made in the courts SEO stock dropped almost nothing.

276
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:27,950
Rym: Yeah, it just plummeted straight down.

277
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:31,370
Rym: I'd laugh but I don't care anymore.

278
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:37,010
Rym: It's kind of like finding out that Carthage finally fell 20 years after it happened and not caring.

279
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:37,452
Scott: It's like.

280
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:38,315
Scott: I knew it's like.

281
00:20:38,677 --> 00:20:45,129
Scott: I knew that this was bullshit five four or five years ago And now it's just finally proven me right and that's that's it.

282
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:58,030
Scott: So I'm sure you can read all the actual details of this on grok law and Wikipedia And if you just search on slash that for SEO or a billion other sites and get all the details.

283
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:06,360
Scott: But like there's a crazy guy who's in charge of SEO who is involved in a bunch of other like, you know Sue companies that exist only for suing.

284
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:11,942
Scott: he has said some interesting things Crazy Mormon or something or a scientist.

285
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:13,409
Scott: I'm not sure which one I don't know.

286
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:16,350
Rym: I'd make a penny arcade kind of joke about dogs and orgasm.

287
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,029
Scott: He's a crazy guy and he had some crazy people with him.

288
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:32,977
Rym: and I think the funniest part is when I worked at IBM one day I was like so I SEO haha and No one in the company that I had talked to and I talked to a lot of people Had any idea that the case even existed.

289
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:34,441
Rym: that's how little IBM cared.

290
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:38,116
Rym: like no one even knew it was happening except their legal department Yep,

291
00:21:38,805 --> 00:22:01,660
Scott: but yeah What it comes down to is just that you know people paid attention in the geek Tech community to this story so much that all these crazy details and speculations things came out of it most of which are just black Speculation speculation and so now this story sort of inflated to this giant monster because all the details were Exposed and they went down to the very last grain of salt.

292
00:22:02,202 --> 00:22:07,250
Scott: and now it's over and we never had to think about it again Let alone, you know talk about it again.

293
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:14,912
Rym: Well, I do know this that this is proven one thing Duke Nukem forever is going to come out as is Team Fortress 2 Supposedly.

294
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:16,522
Scott: well, I know Team Fortress 2 is coming.

295
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:17,246
Scott: Okay, right.

296
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,140
Rym: Well, yeah, there's all that marketing video and they keep saying it's coming.

297
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:24,050
Rym: but they they had a lot of marketing videos a long time ago.

298
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:33,229
Rym: They said it was coming things of the day.

299
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:45,670
Rym: So way way back we did a show about shaving and the fact that Scott and I both shave not with you know Modern crap, whatever Gillette whatever razors, but we shave with 1950s style safety razors.

300
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,086
Rym: You know the big T things with an actual razor blade in it and a badger hair brush and the little.

301
00:22:50,106 --> 00:22:52,510
Scott: not a straight razor Not a ledge razor.

302
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:54,962
Rym: The thing is I mean I don't same thing.

303
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:56,730
Scott: John Wayne shaved with it was good enough for him.

304
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,495
Scott: It's good enough for you.

305
00:22:57,737 --> 00:23:08,290
Rym: cuz about we don't do this for any like Oh I like the antique way of doing things or any nostalgia for the past because straight razors Really suck to use and are really hard and really dangerous.

306
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:13,650
Rym: But the Mach 3 and all that shave pretty craftily and they're stupidly expensive.

307
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:19,010
Scott: Even more important than the razor is the the cream and the method of applying the cream.

308
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:20,530
Scott: Yeah, we're not gonna do another shaving it.

309
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:20,806
Rym: No, no.

310
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:28,490
Rym: But all I want to say is once we started shaving I guess the old-fashioned way with an actual brush and hot water and lather.

311
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,177
Rym: It was like night and day.

312
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:32,145
Scott: go listen to the old shaving episode.

313
00:23:32,306 --> 00:23:33,190
Rym: I think it's a pretty good show.

314
00:23:33,392 --> 00:23:39,929
Rym: it was a good show, but Finally I was poking around and I noticed a video of called the joy of shaving.

315
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:55,009
Rym: and If any of you still doubt our method of shaving and the way we do it and how it's so awesome Just watch this video and if you like the idea of what that guy did if you can imagine What shaving via that method felt like?

316
00:23:57,315 --> 00:24:02,443
Rym: I'll just leave it at that All right, so so Hulk Hogan.

317
00:24:03,065 --> 00:24:05,555
Scott: Hulk Hogan was my man Back when I was a kid.

318
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:06,560
Scott: He was the man now.

319
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:07,385
Rym: He's alright.

320
00:24:07,686 --> 00:24:10,358
Scott: He's not so bad I mean, he took a bunch of Royds.

321
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,306
Scott: He knows he took a bunch of Royds.

322
00:24:12,346 --> 00:24:13,350
Scott: He doesn't take him anymore.

323
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:19,250
Rym: I remember he's not a you with him on channel 1 TV that propaganda ad machine for middle schools.

324
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:24,435
Rym: And I remember that they only asked him one question if you went bald Would you wear a wig?

325
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,424
Rym: and he said no, I would not.

326
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,570
Rym: I think wigs are stupid.

327
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:32,390
Scott: Yeah, and now he knows it bald and he only has hair growing in the sides in the back and stuff.

328
00:24:32,611 --> 00:24:34,940
Rym: Yeah, the thing is it makes him look a little bit majestic.

329
00:24:35,221 --> 00:24:36,265
Scott: Yeah, I think that's his.

330
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:38,713
Scott: that's that's the Hulk style Hulkamania.

331
00:24:38,773 --> 00:24:38,934
Rym: Yeah.

332
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:45,650
Rym: So anyway, he's an alright guy, you know He's better than the macho man Randy Savage or the ultimate warrior.

333
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,016
Scott: He's much better than the ultimate warrior.

334
00:24:47,056 --> 00:24:50,430
Scott: Randy Savage is also kind of cool, but not as cool as Hulk Hogan.

335
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,334
Scott: No, not as cool as all.

336
00:24:51,354 --> 00:24:52,780
Scott: good, you know, he's not insane.

337
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,350
Scott: He's not a genius, but he's alright.

338
00:24:55,491 --> 00:25:00,030
Scott: He's not evil or anything and he I guess he does good things and he wasn't stupid and he didn't waste all his money.

339
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:04,107
Rym: Yeah, he's not on the Magic Johnson level but he's definitely a pretty good guy.

340
00:25:04,147 --> 00:25:08,263
Scott: all things considered Yeah, he's alright as far as famous people go, especially pro wrestlers.

341
00:25:08,484 --> 00:25:13,018
Scott: Anyway, it's all Kogan Not too bright when it comes to the computers.

342
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,670
Scott: not not a man of machines never would have guessed.

343
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:19,129
Scott: No, so this is a video of it.

344
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:24,650
Scott: I guess his son trying to teach him how to use the old AOL instant messenger.

345
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,694
Scott: Pretty funny.

346
00:25:26,714 --> 00:25:31,430
Scott: I the only question is like how does he like he types with like one finger, right?

347
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,696
Scott: But it's sort of like how does he do that?

348
00:25:33,757 --> 00:25:36,986
Scott: I mean, it's like how does strong bad type with boxing glasses.

349
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:41,142
Scott: fingers are so big They must need like a special Hulk keyboard.

350
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:42,670
Scott: I don't know how he does it, but he's doing it.

351
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,311
Rym: You know I just.

352
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:51,591
Rym: that's actually kind of a valid question because when I did meet Magic Johnson, he could have picked me up by my head Easily.

353
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:53,337
Rym: his fingers were gigantic.

354
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:54,621
Rym: I can't imagine him typing.

355
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:55,645
Rym: I'm looking at my keyboard.

356
00:25:55,906 --> 00:25:57,069
Rym: His finger is bigger than a key.

357
00:25:57,676 --> 00:25:58,689
Scott: Yeah, I don't know how it's done.

358
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:05,430
Scott: So watch this video and look closely at his Hulk hands and see how he types on a laptop keyboard.

359
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:09,830
Rym: So a while ago as you all know, we were at Otakon the anime convention.

360
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:31,606
Rym: We're not going to talk about that today because it's not anime day None of you probably care, but at that convention our friends Pete and James James having a fancy video camera he wanted to play with and Pete being well reckless and crazy decided that they wanted to go to the 4chan panel and Record a little documentary kind of as a joke about these, you know weirdos in 4chan.

361
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:32,750
Scott: Oh, that's a smart move.

362
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:44,760
Rym: Well Pete came back a little bit shaken like actually a little bit shaken not jokingly and then he showed us the video and We basically as a group came to the conclusion that you couldn't.

363
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:49,428
Rym: I mean it's not quite as funny and just oh, haha Look at those guys.

364
00:26:50,112 --> 00:26:59,300
Rym: there's actually kind of a serious point here about the future of the internet and anonymity and internet culture and people culture and hive-minds and emergent behavior and all these things.

365
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,167
Rym: and it was kind of frightening.

366
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:12,470
Rym: the fact that 4chan just a bunch of weird kids yelling stuff at an anime convention when viewed through the eyes of the researcher Actually illustrates a lot of very important points about socialization.

367
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:23,881
Scott: Yeah, I kind of wish I was some sort of Anthropologist or something because then I'd go there and it'd be like, oh see this is you know Like that and this is like that but sadly some nerd.

368
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:29,643
Rym: the only things we can really say are words We learned in ghost in the shell we can talk about second-order simulacra.

369
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:31,609
Scott: Yeah, cuz I know what that is.

370
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,114
Rym: It's actually pretty simple.

371
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:36,024
Rym: It happens in almost in both ghost in the shell standalone complex.

372
00:27:36,124 --> 00:27:38,070
Scott: I probably understand the concept.

373
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:41,330
Scott: I just don't know what concept it is that those words represent.

374
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:43,164
Rym: Well think about the plot.

375
00:27:43,185 --> 00:27:43,630
Rym: but anyway.

376
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:48,730
Rym: So we want to talk a little bit about anonymity and places like 4chan or whatever exchange.

377
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:49,452
Scott: Well, there's.

378
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:51,378
Scott: there's two things you got to take into account here.

379
00:27:51,418 --> 00:27:51,800
Scott: There's the.

380
00:27:52,241 --> 00:27:55,150
Scott: there's the technology of anonymity, you know.

381
00:27:55,251 --> 00:28:07,302
Scott: and then there's the sort of psychology of anonymity both on the internet because I don't know how to deal with anonymity elsewhere other than the Internet's because well you Can wear a mask all the time and not carry ID, I guess I guess.

382
00:28:07,362 --> 00:28:11,977
Scott: but when it comes to the technology of anonymity There's pretty much two different levels.

383
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:15,310
Scott: There's are you a hundred percent guaranteed anonymous?

384
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,160
Scott: there is no way anyone could possibly find out who you are who did that.

385
00:28:19,742 --> 00:28:32,606
Scott: and then there's you're basically anonymous where Sure, they could technically find out if they jump through a lot of technological hoops But they effectively no way of proving who you are now what they basically break down to.

386
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:36,570
Rym: I mean you can call these Absolute anonymity and trust-based anonymity.

387
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,950
Rym: Yeah now trust-based we should talk about first because that is the vast majority of anonymity on the internet.

388
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:55,430
Rym: Yeah, like, you know all those places where you can go through an anonymizer So people can't see where you're coming from on a website or you go through a proxy just so people can't track you or you Log into a site like FARC, but you didn't link your real name or anything to it.

389
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:00,550
Rym: So it's just like jahar 4 7 8 and no one knows that is actually Rym from GeekNights.

390
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:12,924
Rym: While you're anonymous Functionally as far as anyone who accesses that site or whatever is concerned You had to trust someone along the way Because you can't really get anywhere on the internet without an IP address.

391
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:25,104
Rym: and while there are varying Levels of how close they could track you down the fact remains that there is a point along the way where you had to trust someone Enough to use them as your anonymity broker.

392
00:29:25,545 --> 00:29:31,364
Scott: pretty much the way it works Right is let's say you're on the internet and your computer has a real IP address.

393
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:33,150
Scott: right one computer one IP address.

394
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:34,590
Scott: You're on the real internet, right?

395
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,094
Scott: So you go to a website.

396
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:42,437
Scott: that website knows your IP address, even if you encrypt all the traffic You're not encrypting the IP addresses.

397
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:45,950
Scott: The router needs to read those so it can send your packets the right way.

398
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:49,090
Rym: So if you want to go through one of those anonymizers, all right.

399
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,303
Rym: Now the website doesn't know but the anonymizer knows.

400
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:55,554
Rym: they know where you went and who you are Things.

401
00:29:55,754 --> 00:30:09,028
Scott: the way those things work is basically there's a computer out there and you connect to that computer and so to like a hundred other people or a thousand other people and then that computer goes to the website for you and then gives you the website.

402
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:13,780
Scott: so now You basically you can be effectively anonymous.

403
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:23,784
Scott: because if the website says hey who posted that they go and they find the IP address of Some computer somewhere and they say we don't know it could have been any of these thousands of people We have no idea.

404
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:26,240
Rym: granted You have to trust that person perfectly.

405
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:32,266
Scott: because yeah that computer in the middle of nowhere Might just you know be logging your IP address and it might tell them.

406
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:34,898
Rym: and then all you know That things being run by the FBI.

407
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,043
Rym: It's really no way to know.

408
00:30:36,063 --> 00:30:38,617
Scott: There's no way to know at all Absolutely none.

409
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,046
Rym: and with websites or anything.

410
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:40,630
Rym: It's the same way.

411
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,030
Rym: You know, I set up for an account on slash dot infarct, but they know what IP addresses I come from.

412
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:49,104
Rym: In fact over time they probably have a list of all the different IP addresses I've come from.

413
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:57,130
Rym: they could probably figure out Just by looking at the history of me accessing FARC with my account where I work where I live where I go on vacation.

414
00:30:57,615 --> 00:30:59,070
Scott: You might be thinking you're real clever.

415
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:05,770
Scott: You might go to like a public library or some other publicly accessible computer log in and post stuff on the internet somewhere.

416
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:06,713
Rym: Alright, well one.

417
00:31:06,733 --> 00:31:15,104
Rym: a lot of those places make you log in with a student ID or a library card ID Or there's a camera and they can say this is posted this around this time.

418
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,830
Scott: Let's see who is sitting there at this time.

419
00:31:17,472 --> 00:31:18,355
Scott: Look it was Scott.

420
00:31:18,737 --> 00:31:22,210
Rym: There he is on the camera and you think oh, I'm behind a net in a big corporation.

421
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,033
Rym: They can't find me.

422
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:24,057
Rym: Well, guess what?

423
00:31:24,438 --> 00:31:31,543
Rym: They can figure out the corporation and from there they can say Alright corporation who has who is accessing this site?

424
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,430
Rym: We know you keep logs to prevent porn.

425
00:31:34,073 --> 00:32:12,224
Scott: So unless you know that you are behind something where there is sufficiently a large number of other people and That the thing you are behind is You trustworthy and actually making you anonymous and that along the way There is at least one point at which no logs are kept and there is no way to recover any logs and no one will talk It's really hard to actually be for real a hundred percent anonymous because if someone goes through all the trouble They can retrace every step and find you because you need and or that at least they can find Your real IP address and then at that point it's not too hard to find you from there.

426
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:12,665
Rym: now.

427
00:32:12,725 --> 00:32:25,629
Rym: the few ways to get effectively true Anonymity are to either compromise someone else's computer and do it very well To the point that you erase all traces of you being there or at least all the logs of where you came from.

428
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:29,130
Scott: Yeah, so I hack into someone else's Windows crap computer.

429
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:42,450
Scott: I use that as my go-between and then I Leave and I make sure that even if someone gets a hold of that crap computer or someone at the ISP takes a look There's no way absolutely no way they can figure out.

430
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,473
Scott: I was the one who did it.

431
00:32:43,855 --> 00:32:50,481
Rym: another way is to compromise on a more broad sense Jen certain parts of the Network internet talking protocols.

432
00:32:50,521 --> 00:32:52,370
Rym: I'm not gonna go into tech detail at all about this.

433
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:52,892
Rym: Yeah If you

434
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,966
Scott: own some if you own some big router or

435
00:32:55,389 --> 00:33:05,190
Rym: not Even that if you can compromise or there's shady things you can do at various levels depending on What you're trying to access where you can spoof or make it look like you're coming from somewhere else than you really are.

436
00:33:05,711 --> 00:33:08,902
Rym: But even then that's very difficult doesn't always work very well.

437
00:33:09,324 --> 00:33:11,030
Rym: And even then you might leave traces behind.

438
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:14,619
Rym: Currently the the best way for normal people to get.

439
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:22,224
Rym: true anonymity is to use someone else's unsecured wireless access point While you're on it to not do anything that could link back to you.

440
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:23,550
Rym: So don't check your email.

441
00:33:23,911 --> 00:33:24,955
Rym: Don't visit the websites.

442
00:33:24,975 --> 00:33:25,778
Rym: You normally visit.

443
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,183
Rym: don't log into your myspace.

444
00:33:27,444 --> 00:33:28,970
Rym: Don't look at your friends myspace.

445
00:33:29,232 --> 00:33:31,769
Rym: Don't google for anything that in any way could link back to you.

446
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:37,728
Scott: Don't run any services on your machine that someone might be able to detect and find out what computer you are using.

447
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:43,304
Rym: and Make sure that there's no cameras around and no one can see you accessing that thing.

448
00:33:43,324 --> 00:33:43,364
Rym: So

449
00:33:43,986 --> 00:33:57,522
Scott: it's pretty hard to be actually anonymous, but you can be pretty much anonymous because like if I just go to 4chan and I post something or if I just go To slash that make an account and post something No one fucking knows and no one's gonna bother to look.

450
00:33:58,085 --> 00:34:02,260
Scott: I could I could go on Slashdot or dig and make up an account and post something.

451
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,926
Scott: That's like fuck fuck fuckity.

452
00:34:03,966 --> 00:34:07,616
Scott: Fuck your mother sucks and No one's gonna know what.

453
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:09,303
Scott: they're not gonna know who posted that.

454
00:34:09,362 --> 00:34:10,969
Scott: they have no idea that Scott from GeekNights.

455
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:16,190
Scott: no clue and they're never gonna because it'd be so much effort to figure that out and Dig.

456
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:19,042
Scott: it probably figured out pretty easily, but they're not even gonna bother.

457
00:34:19,263 --> 00:34:20,909
Scott: It's just not gonna happen now.

458
00:34:21,313 --> 00:34:33,721
Rym: I have a lot of things to say about Absolute anonymity particularly if it were ubiquitous and easy and things related to along those lines terrorism and Global nations that have nothing to do with.

459
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:38,279
Rym: I don't know location or anything like that But I think that's really beyond the scope of this right now.

460
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:38,560
Rym: Yes.

461
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:45,440
Scott: I think what we have to go venture into is John Gabriel territory here now socially.

462
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,603
Rym: We'll leave all the tech aside.

463
00:34:46,683 --> 00:35:06,710
Rym: We could go into more specifics another show someday, but Generally, there's a lot of writing and literature about the idea of anonymity and a lot of this came out in the early days of the Internet when Sociologists were looking at how people react and how people write and how people interact with each other When they're anonymous or when they can be anonymous.

464
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:21,860
Scott: Well think about back in the day before the Internet's what anonymity was all about usually when someone Wanted to write like a book that they might get in trouble for or when someone wanted to do something without getting any recognition, you know.

465
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,310
Scott: or when someone Maybe did like did something great, but they didn't want to get all the credit for it.

466
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:31,982
Scott: They wanted to stay you know hiding and they didn't want any attention from anybody.

467
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:45,890
Rym: or in like small group theory and collaboration Theory in these social situations and studies where they looked at ideas of if people are collaborating Openly versus if people are collaborating in a way where you can't know who proposed what idea.

468
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:55,913
Rym: And there's a lot of effects where some people who might have been more reluctant to voice their opinions will suddenly voice them more often And some people might say less because they don't want to do something They won't get credit for.

469
00:35:55,973 --> 00:36:00,450
Rym: and there's a fascinating field of study that again is a little bit beyond the scope of this show.

470
00:36:01,015 --> 00:36:02,369
Scott: The point is is that people?

471
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:06,621
Scott: Mostly want to be anonymous when they don't want.

472
00:36:06,922 --> 00:36:15,029
Scott: they want to avoid positive or negative Attention they want to send things out and they want to avoid things coming back to them.

473
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:20,970
Rym: Now a lot of times this just ends up being something like trolling or unpopular opinions.

474
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:30,744
Scott: Yes, but other times it can actually be serious like I want to make a charitable donation But I do not want anyone to know it was me or I am posting from North Korea.

475
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:35,600
Scott: Get me out of here house But I don't want to be killed within the next 10 minutes.

476
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,342
Scott: Seriously.

477
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:36,864
Rym: It sucks.

478
00:36:37,245 --> 00:36:38,148
Scott: Yes, it does.

479
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:46,630
Scott: All right So you get on this internet where suddenly even it's pretty hard to become not anonymous.

480
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:55,756
Scott: I mean, you're always gonna be not technically a hundred percent, you know anonymous, but it's pretty hard to avoid the effective anonymousness.

481
00:36:55,856 --> 00:37:02,170
Scott: as far as you know socializing and Communicating on the internet is concerned in a practical everyday sort of sense.

482
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:05,590
Rym: In fact, I think for this discussion, we actually have to break it up into three terms.

483
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:12,570
Rym: I mean on one hand there's absolute anonymity and on the other hand, there's verifiable identity, but then there's the middle ground.

484
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:13,442
Rym: I don't know what I call it.

485
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:18,490
Rym: I don't know Attributed anonymity where you are not linked to your persona.

486
00:37:18,872 --> 00:37:21,990
Rym: No one knows that shez are is Rym from GeekNights.

487
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:26,710
Rym: But at the same time on Farker slashdot shez are is a valid account.

488
00:37:27,051 --> 00:37:32,230
Rym: And if someone posts from shez are people are 99% sure that that was actually that guy talking.

489
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:33,827
Rym: So they don't know who it is.

490
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:43,284
Rym: But they can link all the things that one person says together and as a result that online identity can have its own Opinions and its own view from other people.

491
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:48,363
Scott: Well, I think what that is Is that when you say you write a book say by anonymous, right?

492
00:37:48,784 --> 00:37:52,704
Scott: That's sort of like, okay We don't have no idea who wrote this book.

493
00:37:52,986 --> 00:37:53,670
Scott: We have no clue.

494
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:57,325
Scott: It could have been you know there even if there's another book also by anonymous.

495
00:37:57,385 --> 00:37:57,707
Scott: We don't know.

496
00:37:57,747 --> 00:37:58,470
Scott: it's the same person.

497
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,902
Scott: We have absolutely no clue.

498
00:38:00,184 --> 00:38:00,950
Scott: We can't do anything.

499
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,530
Scott: All we can do is guess based on the contents of the book itself.

500
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:08,830
Scott: But if a book is say by I don't know shez are that's like a pen name?

501
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:12,190
Scott: No one knows your physical real-world identity.

502
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:25,709
Scott: But you have created this new proxy identity that instead of you personally You know Rym were receiving the credits or the negative impact and you know Feedback from whatever you've put out.

503
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:29,081
Scott: You're able to put out through a proxy sort of in the same way.

504
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:40,239
Scott: you use an internet proxy to put out and the receiving goes to the proxy and you can sort of choose to when stuff is received by the proxy whether to Take it to yourself or to leave it out.

505
00:38:40,259 --> 00:38:49,218
Rym: There's on the proxy level now even here I think there's a lot of fascinating discussion about how a lot of people have very different online Personas from what they have in real life.

506
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:57,463
Scott: or people have multiple online personas in different places Like on Facebook, they have sort of like a nice guy and on Craigslist They have a wheeler dealer and on eBay.

507
00:38:57,483 --> 00:39:07,390
Rym: They have a wheeler dealer Yeah, and then on slash dot they're just sort of a nerd or well in the realm I had you know, my main guy Alison Dar who was an elf and he was all cool or whatever.

508
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:16,341
Rym: But then I had a cute who was a girl who existed solely to scam pimply nerds out of valuable magical items Uh-huh, and then give them to the guy.

509
00:39:16,884 --> 00:39:17,587
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

510
00:39:17,627 --> 00:39:21,215
Scott: Yeah That's sort of sexist but whatever.

511
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:24,806
Rym: well the thing is it was mostly guys playing that game.

512
00:39:24,826 --> 00:39:26,190
Scott: Yes, it was mostly practical.

513
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:28,919
Rym: I mean even World of Warcraft is pretty popular today.

514
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:30,404
Rym: It's really popular and it's kind of.

515
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:40,600
Rym: it's a lot of women playing Yeah, but back in the day like in the first couple MMOs there were like five girls total Yeah, but or like on Fark.

516
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:43,690
Rym: I'm an asshole on Fark pretty much a hundred percent.

517
00:39:43,851 --> 00:39:46,119
Rym: I post only when I'm going to anger someone.

518
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:49,754
Scott: Yeah, that's a whole nother topic of discussion of Anonymous.

519
00:39:49,774 --> 00:39:53,750
Scott: missus you gender and race and all those sorts of things just sort of go away.

520
00:39:53,871 --> 00:40:05,947
Rym: Yeah In fact, I know multiple women who post with generic gender neutral or even masculine screen names Just to avoid all the crap that comes when OMG a girl is in our forums.

521
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:06,729
Rym: I shall hit on her

522
00:40:07,636 --> 00:40:20,350
Scott: but at the same time it sort of Perpetuates the impression that there's not so many women and I think if more of them posted, you know, like yeah We're a whole bunch of women people would say oh there are a whole bunch of women like, you know about half the Internet's.

523
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:22,603
Scott: Stop their bullshit.

524
00:40:22,765 --> 00:40:39,530
Rym: in general I mean people treat the things that men say and women say oftentimes differently and the internet is an exception to that in that you can't really know if someone's actually a woman or a man and a lot of times someone with a neutral or Opposite screen name will be treated very differently from how they might have been treated in real life.

525
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:47,010
Rym: Mmm be interesting I have noticed that because I once used a screen name that was kind of gender on gender neutral.

526
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:59,230
Rym: But I learned from talking to people in South America of all things This is back in the ICQ days that a lot of people thought it was a feminine name and a lot of people thought I was A girl, uh-huh, and there I wasn't intending that there was no way.

527
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,736
Rym: I mean, it's not like I use.

528
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:03,688
Scott: a lot of people think you're a girl anyway, so it's not.

529
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:07,050
Rym: you know Well now that I got rid of the mustache, I guess and the neck beard.

530
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,810
Rym: But I think that is again a whole topic for another show.

531
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:21,280
Scott: It seems like this whole show is just saying wow, look at all these really interesting, you know Intellectual discussions you can have about anonymity.

532
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,968
Scott: It is such a vast and complicated thing.

533
00:41:24,008 --> 00:41:35,109
Rym: Look at it Ooh, hence I want to narrow it down to a very specific kind of anonymity the kind that Pete and James saw with their own eyes at Otakon the 4chan world.

534
00:41:35,852 --> 00:41:40,669
Rym: I mean, I'm gonna explain very briefly how 4chan works because I know a lot of people hear about it.

535
00:41:41,152 --> 00:41:50,830
Rym: It's kind of like this murky part of the internet that they avoid Full of penis girls and scariness if they even know that and not that many people go there except the people who are kind of into It.

536
00:41:51,452 --> 00:42:01,682
Rym: basically it is a site where not only are you anonymous in the sense that your screen name is not Actually linked to your real identity in any way that users can get to.

537
00:42:02,244 --> 00:42:03,629
Rym: it goes one step further than that.

538
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:08,030
Rym: You cannot prove that you are you and you can post as anyone.

539
00:42:08,512 --> 00:42:21,170
Rym: people who post and put their name or something are generally looked down upon and they even have a system that was built in where you can use a hash to prove that you were The same person and those people are universally despised.

540
00:42:22,046 --> 00:42:32,404
Scott: Yeah generally the way 4chan works is you can type in any username you want just about every time you post and That's the username that'll show up and no one knows who's who.

541
00:42:32,485 --> 00:42:34,030
Scott: and that's sort of the way they like it.

542
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,836
Scott: They don't want anyone to know who it was.

543
00:42:35,937 --> 00:42:39,550
Scott: So, you know all those dick girls could be one guy.

544
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,618
Scott: It could also be a thousand people.

545
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:42,582
Scott: You have no idea.

546
00:42:42,863 --> 00:42:43,506
Rym: So think about.

547
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:44,289
Scott: they don't want to know.

548
00:42:44,951 --> 00:42:49,043
Rym: This is a community where people are contributing content and interacting.

549
00:42:49,063 --> 00:42:51,290
Scott: They could just one guy, but no, it's probably not.

550
00:42:51,533 --> 00:42:52,689
Rym: We know it's at least two guys.

551
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:54,193
Rym: Yeah but think about it.

552
00:42:54,233 --> 00:43:08,690
Rym: people are talking to each other submitting content creating content creating meta content based on that content having Social relations all these things and yet they've removed any sort of anchor point into as to personality.

553
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:09,794
Rym: There's no more.

554
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:14,290
Rym: I am an individual talking to this individual and this third individual is commenting.

555
00:43:14,731 --> 00:43:18,884
Rym: It is I am throwing with no possible chance of attribution.

556
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:20,328
Rym: No one will ever know what works.

557
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:23,356
Rym: Retribution Attribution also, I've had attribution.

558
00:43:23,396 --> 00:43:24,981
Rym: but I guess retribution is also true.

559
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:27,950
Scott: Yeah any sort of asterix fusion.

560
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:30,598
Rym: There aren't so many.

561
00:43:30,618 --> 00:43:32,530
Rym: I don't know if you get ablution.

562
00:43:33,513 --> 00:43:35,753
Scott: That's not uh That's blue.

563
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:36,536
Scott: It's not view.

564
00:43:36,556 --> 00:43:38,042
Rym: Ah, I guess you're right.

565
00:43:38,062 --> 00:43:38,845
Scott: It has to be fusion.

566
00:43:39,387 --> 00:43:59,745
Rym: No butions Anyway, so you throw these ideas out there and people respond to them But you can't know who's actually responding and you're basically stripped of all sense of identity and kind of subsumed by this Massive anonymous blob that ends up having almost emergent behavior.

567
00:43:59,785 --> 00:44:01,650
Rym: Like it almost has a mind of its own.

568
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,479
Rym: You're not a person anymore.

569
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,450
Rym: You're just a neuron in the 4chan brain.

570
00:44:05,671 --> 00:44:16,876
Scott: Well, I think what it is is that you know when people You know act normally in life when they're not anonymous in any way they have Inhibitions that prevent them from doing certain things.

571
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:22,993
Scott: they have filters on things they intake and things they put out and they're not just gonna Do whatever.

572
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:36,860
Scott: but when you're somewhere like 4chan and this is no chance of anything everyone just lets a hundred percent completely loose and it's a hundred percent honest and No one gives a shit about anything.

573
00:44:37,222 --> 00:44:56,508
Scott: So you're gonna get like the most natural of instinctual reactions and Such, you know biological urges and things all coming out in Writing and imagery and sometimes audio and maybe even video but rarely now as we started thinking about this looking at 4chan.

574
00:44:57,672 --> 00:44:59,018
Rym: 4chan because it's 4 channel.

575
00:44:59,058 --> 00:45:00,765
Rym: It's not like 4chan like a little cute thing.

576
00:45:00,805 --> 00:45:01,830
Rym: At least that's what I've been told.

577
00:45:02,652 --> 00:45:15,718
Rym: It kind of puts it in a frightening new light because if that is the emergent behavior of the collected Unconscious or the collected unbridled inhibitions of the people on the internet That kind of says a lot about humanity

578
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:19,790
Scott: or at least the humanity that speaks English and is on the Internet.

579
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:24,127
Rym: So or at least at least the humanity that has decided that they want to be a part of this.

580
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:24,750
Rym: anonymous.

581
00:45:24,951 --> 00:45:29,082
Scott: I'd like we'd have to set up fortunes and like get I guess other people on them.

582
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:42,839
Scott: because even though right 4chan is anonymous We kind of know that it's mostly You know anime fans high school young college type people Mostly males in the US granted.

583
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:47,475
Rym: I think a lot of that is just due to the fact that older people Just aren't hip to it.

584
00:45:47,516 --> 00:45:51,269
Rym: I mean, I think I'm above the age where I could have gotten into 4chan.

585
00:45:52,532 --> 00:46:09,210
Scott: I 4chan is good for you know, occasionally like it's sort of like this world where I kind of understand what goes on there But I don't enjoy going there and occasionally funny pictures pop out of it and I enjoy looking at them and Sometimes not so funny pictures pop out and I don't want to look at those

586
00:46:09,431 --> 00:46:22,007
Rym: I look at kind of like the the high culture in France where they have like the super fancy fashion show where women wear like boat anchors and like crazy things that no human being could possibly wear as high fashion.

587
00:46:22,469 --> 00:46:25,024
Rym: and then People who are more reasonable see hey, huh?

588
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:38,690
Rym: They're inspired by that and they make something and then that becomes the high fashion for normal people and then it filters down and filters Down and filters down and eventually a knockoff of a knockoff of a knockoff is in Walmart for $5.95.

589
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:40,135
Rym: Yeah, and I fee.

590
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:44,570
Rym: I see a lot of internet jokes and internet me shirt with a picture of an anchor on it.

591
00:46:44,652 --> 00:46:50,045
Rym: Yeah But you see a lot of these internet memes that get big if you trace back their origins.

592
00:46:50,486 --> 00:46:51,910
Rym: a lot of them came from 4chan.

593
00:46:52,495 --> 00:46:54,290
Scott: Yeah, I mean lolcats.

594
00:46:55,153 --> 00:46:58,503
Scott: And if they didn't completely originate in 4chan, 4chan made them big.

595
00:46:59,165 --> 00:47:04,450
Rym: and while not just 4chan I mean something awful is kind of like the exact opposite of 4chan in that regard.

596
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:10,474
Rym: It's kind of like if 4chan is evolution then something awful is intelligent design Something like that.

597
00:47:11,095 --> 00:47:12,319
Scott: I mean something awful.

598
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:14,827
Scott: people sort of know who you are, you know, it's not.

599
00:47:14,887 --> 00:47:15,970
Scott: it's not super anonymous.

600
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:17,977
Scott: It's just as anonymous as every other site.

601
00:47:17,997 --> 00:47:21,370
Rym: people there take attribution and they try to make memes.

602
00:47:22,037 --> 00:47:29,284
Scott: 4chan it just happens Yeah And it's sort of tough because something awful does seem like when they produce product like.

603
00:47:29,505 --> 00:47:31,450
Scott: it is more amusing more often.

604
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:41,641
Scott: but 4chan is sort of like this pit where there's a whole bunch of excess stuff in there and Sometimes interesting things can come out of the excess stuff.

605
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:44,450
Scott: Even if the excess stuff itself is not what you're looking for.

606
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:46,897
Scott: It's almost like I bet there's something awful.

607
00:47:46,937 --> 00:47:51,520
Scott: people go and look at the 4chan and then they make their stuff based on what they You know.

608
00:47:51,561 --> 00:47:54,400
Scott: see there it's like you go and you wait in a pool for a while.

609
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:59,884
Scott: you come back and you pick some leeches off and then You find you got a quarter stuck in your toe and you're like, ah, there it is.

610
00:48:00,205 --> 00:48:01,631
Rym: Ah, got it See the.

611
00:48:01,732 --> 00:48:15,670
Rym: I mean the really fascinating thing to me is that 4chan very often illustrates the principle of emergent behavior Very directly and if you think about it when you're when someone's on 4chan They're not engaging in a continuous thread of conversation as one being.

612
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:28,407
Rym: What they're doing is they're seeing the current state of the 4chan world as a snapshot and they are basically making a one-off Decision of what to contribute to that exact snapshot or what to take away.

613
00:48:28,427 --> 00:48:49,054
Rym: Ah true yeah, and as a result this kind of emergent behavior where things become popular or not popular or morph or become Self-referential not based on the decision of any one person but based on the collective Unconscious and undecided decision of the masses like people don't decide Seeking fuck.

614
00:48:49,074 --> 00:48:50,239
Rym: Yeah is gonna become our thing.

615
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:51,042
Rym: It just happens.

616
00:48:51,383 --> 00:48:53,330
Rym: No one person thought that's gonna become the thing.

617
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:54,693
Scott: Yeah It's like undig right.

618
00:48:54,713 --> 00:49:02,402
Scott: you actually have a system of voting where technically everyone votes and if enough people dig something it comes and rise to the top and that's supposed to be.

619
00:49:02,443 --> 00:49:06,817
Scott: that's sort of like institutionalized what you what what you know.

620
00:49:07,097 --> 00:49:11,370
Scott: 4chan is without any sort of software to back it up and dig.

621
00:49:11,731 --> 00:49:21,090
Scott: You know someone with a bunch of friends dig something and then all those friends see it on their RSS feeds and they dig it And then it gets a little boost so it gets a little bit of exposure.

622
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:27,850
Scott: So enough other people see it and they dig it and then it's on the front page Whether it's actually something the community really likes or not.

623
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:35,606
Scott: You should see how many things get to the front page and then get a zillion berries because once it's on the front page all These other people see it and then they all get rid of it.

624
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:38,841
Rym: like me Yeah, Barry's like ten times the things he digs.

625
00:49:38,901 --> 00:49:43,216
Scott: Yes, but meanwhile and fortune There's no software backing up.

626
00:49:43,256 --> 00:49:43,938
Scott: What's popular?

627
00:49:43,978 --> 00:49:44,439
Scott: What's not?

628
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:50,034
Scott: there is no, you know person with a bunch of friends getting all their friends to do Something there's no scheming.

629
00:49:50,476 --> 00:49:53,667
Scott: It's some guy puts a picture up of seeking and it says fuck.

630
00:49:53,707 --> 00:49:54,269
Scott: Yeah on it.

631
00:49:54,771 --> 00:50:00,064
Scott: Okay, a guy put a picture up then some other guy says seeking fuck.

632
00:50:00,104 --> 00:50:02,270
Scott: Yeah, was it the same guy or was it a different?

633
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:03,295
Scott: Guy, I don't know.

634
00:50:03,315 --> 00:50:04,280
Scott: There's no way to know.

635
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:11,705
Scott: it could have been one guy saying seeking fuck Yeah the whole time but it's it's on there a lot a lot of people or you.

636
00:50:11,725 --> 00:50:16,947
Scott: supposedly more than one person is saying seeking fuck Yeah and a lot of threads all of a sudden.

637
00:50:16,967 --> 00:50:25,976
Scott: and Then you realize when you go to the 4chan panel at Otakon when a hundred people or more are chanting Seeking fuck.

638
00:50:25,997 --> 00:50:27,884
Scott: Yeah seeking fuck.

639
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:35,350
Scott: Yeah seeking fuck Yeah, that it became popular on its own without any software or anything like that.

640
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,415
Scott: It just did it.

641
00:50:36,455 --> 00:50:39,450
Scott: was it caught on like fire catching on wood?

642
00:50:39,952 --> 00:50:48,490
Rym: I mean once James and Pete get this documentary fully together I'm sure we're gonna figure out a way to get it out to you people Because you can probably some sort of YouTube and the experimental feed.

643
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:51,380
Rym: I imagine you can see this happening in real time.

644
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,090
Rym: because remember the people going to the 4chan panel.

645
00:50:54,090 --> 00:51:00,060
Rym: they're all 4chan people or people like Pete, but most of them are 4chan people and They don't know each other.

646
00:51:00,382 --> 00:51:01,530
Rym: They can't know each other.

647
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:01,671
Rym: Well,

648
00:51:01,711 --> 00:51:04,209
Scott: some of the people know each other, you know, like if you bring your friends at the 4chan

649
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:08,089
Rym: Well, yeah, but at the same time like they don't know each other on 4chan No

650
00:51:08,251 --> 00:51:15,001
Scott: I mean the person sitting next to you in that line could be like the guy who posts every penis girl on all of 4chan.

651
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:21,833
Rym: you have no way of knowing and These people and Pete said this and watching the video I start to agree with it They don't.

652
00:51:21,973 --> 00:51:27,449
Rym: a lot of them don't just go to 4chan and these things because it's funny or they like to look at these penis girls or whatever.

653
00:51:28,212 --> 00:51:33,290
Rym: They go because they almost worship the idea of anonymity and they they're serious about it.

654
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:38,125
Rym: The idea of being anonymous is so liberating that and I'm dead serious.

655
00:51:38,205 --> 00:51:39,690
Rym: It's like religion for some of these people.

656
00:51:39,911 --> 00:51:42,069
Rym: Yeah, and when I say some I mean a significant number.

657
00:51:42,371 --> 00:51:47,410
Scott: Well, I mean you look at the way they behave in the line, right and basically there's a lot of mumbling.

658
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,350
Scott: Well, it's not mumbling, but it sounds like mumbling.

659
00:51:49,410 --> 00:52:09,270
Scott: it's a lot of talking and people are saying things to each other and Occasionally someone says something that catches fire and before you know it half the line is chanting it Right and then it sort of dies out as people get tired of it And then everyone's talking and eventually someone says something that catches on and everyone chants it and then they get bored of it.

660
00:52:09,631 --> 00:52:10,695
Rym: No one was directing this.

661
00:52:10,735 --> 00:52:12,200
Scott: No one knows who started it.

662
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:13,083
Scott: No one.

663
00:52:13,123 --> 00:52:22,397
Scott: No one was directing it saying, okay guys Let's do this chant now because you if you did that people just like boo sit down, you know But everyone's talking to each other.

664
00:52:22,417 --> 00:52:26,210
Scott: There's a lot of talking, you know, probably don't ever even met the people you're talking to.

665
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,174
Scott: They're all strangers.

666
00:52:27,636 --> 00:52:28,721
Scott: You don't know who they are.

667
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:30,750
Scott: Really you might recognize them if you see them again.

668
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,538
Scott: some of them are in costume guy wearing a v-mask.

669
00:52:33,899 --> 00:52:39,661
Scott: a lot of people wearing v-masks a guy with a v-mask and he has Bracelets that say epic fail on them.

670
00:52:39,702 --> 00:52:40,566
Scott: You don't know who that is.

671
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:42,935
Scott: That could be me It's not me, but it could have been.

672
00:52:43,096 --> 00:52:45,021
Rym: but you know, they're a four-channel, you know who.

673
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:48,978
Rym: it isn't me, but that's a Clever cover story.

674
00:52:49,058 --> 00:52:52,356
Scott: Yes, but I mean Shit like that goes down.

675
00:52:52,396 --> 00:52:55,426
Scott: they behave in the line the same way.

676
00:52:55,667 --> 00:53:06,217
Scott: the website works And I the thing is they don't even say alright guys We're gonna go to the line for 4chan panel or we're gonna go to the 4chan panel and behave The way we're gonna mimic 4chan.

677
00:53:06,398 --> 00:53:07,221
Scott: They don't think that.

678
00:53:07,702 --> 00:53:08,405
Scott: it just happens.

679
00:53:08,846 --> 00:53:09,789
Scott: That's just the way it is.

680
00:53:10,351 --> 00:53:20,050
Rym: There was no pre meditation and any other crowd of people even if they have a sink a like purpose Like if you went to a fart party or whatever and lined up or a slash-dot gathering or a lug.

681
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:33,285
Rym: It'd be really hard to get a group of people standing in line for an event like that to yell anything without some sort of Active director some sort of Mover that pushes the crowd into a direction and the crowd being willing to submit to that.

682
00:53:33,746 --> 00:53:58,804
Rym: in this no one was moving No one was pushing and ideas just coalesced Independently and I think the anonymity and the fact that these people are so into it caused I mean this crowd because of who they were and what they cared about even though they didn't all know each other and in any real Capacity things could catch on and die out so much more quickly than they do among normal people because these people totally give themselves up to the anonymity.

683
00:53:59,327 --> 00:54:06,670
Scott: and while You know on a community like 4chan these things happen and in a community like slash-dot or dig these things don't happen so much.

684
00:54:07,332 --> 00:54:11,749
Scott: If you look at the internet as a whole the internet as a whole is just like the 4chan.

685
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:14,480
Scott: It's the macrocosms and the microcosm.

686
00:54:14,661 --> 00:54:16,670
Rym: I think 4chan is just a lot faster.

687
00:54:17,072 --> 00:54:20,870
Rym: It converges quicker onto an ideal, but then it discards that ideal just as quickly.

688
00:54:21,111 --> 00:54:23,884
Scott: But you know if you have a microcosm of anything, that's what happens.

689
00:54:23,945 --> 00:54:25,090
Scott: It's just a lot more efficient.

690
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:34,450
Scott: You know if you had a universe in a jar You could probably see the beginning and the end of the universe of that little tiny universe Within the beginning and the ending of the universe that we live in true.

691
00:54:34,811 --> 00:54:40,970
Scott: So if you have a 4chan in a bottle and you're living in a giant 4chan that's bigger and slower.

692
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,790
Scott: You can sort of see the past in the future in your little jar.

693
00:54:45,111 --> 00:54:51,170
Rym: I just find it fascinating how absolutely quickly a crowd of 4chaners can come to a consensus as to what?

694
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:53,178
Rym: Obscenity to scream at any given moment?

695
00:54:53,218 --> 00:54:55,547
Scott: yeah, I mean plus if you look here look at the internet as a whole.

696
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:56,792
Scott: right the internet Is a whole.

697
00:54:57,073 --> 00:54:59,280
Scott: rumble rumble rumble rumble slash.

698
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,350
Scott: no news groups rumble rumble rumble rumble slash.

699
00:55:02,471 --> 00:55:05,324
Scott: peer-to-peer rumble rumble rumble rumble.

700
00:55:05,364 --> 00:55:09,601
Scott: dig YouTube myspace rumble rumble and it'll be something else.

701
00:55:10,163 --> 00:55:11,507
Scott: it just stuff comes and goes.

702
00:55:11,567 --> 00:55:12,390
Scott: just the same way.

703
00:55:12,772 --> 00:55:15,148
Scott: People are chanting stuff, and then they're not chanting stuff.

704
00:55:15,831 --> 00:55:22,110
Scott: Everyone's anonymous and this big internet see and different things come and go and yep, that's how it goes down 4chan.

705
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,193
Rym: It's just lower level.

706
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:24,156
Rym: It's the next step.

707
00:55:24,176 --> 00:55:33,030
Rym: beyond that it's kind of the next progression, and I I don't know I really can't let myself be subsumed by this kind of anonymous idea.

708
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,596
Scott: Maybe I have better things to do.

709
00:55:34,677 --> 00:55:38,050
Rym: well not even that even if it were on a more philosophical or larger scale.

710
00:55:38,652 --> 00:55:43,089
Rym: I'm too proud of a person, and I'm too self-determined to let myself be subsumed by that.

711
00:55:43,189 --> 00:55:56,508
Rym: yeah But at the same time Peter the guy who was there recording all this with James he ended up joining in and yelling with them and Afterward he said that he really couldn't help it, and he is just as strong-willed as we are.

712
00:55:56,649 --> 00:55:59,401
Scott: yeah Well, I mean I probably would have yelled like see King fuck.

713
00:55:59,441 --> 00:56:03,300
Scott: Yeah, I mean back in the high school days We used to have some fun chanting action.

714
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,125
Scott: You know chanting is fun.

715
00:56:04,145 --> 00:56:05,050
Scott: You go to baseball game.

716
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,036
Scott: You say you know let's go ahead.

717
00:56:06,136 --> 00:56:09,636
Rym: It's like that scene in a dead Poets aside Walking he tells.

718
00:56:09,717 --> 00:56:12,090
Rym: he tells the class just walk around in the courtyard.

719
00:56:12,233 --> 00:56:22,780
Rym: That's your assignment And they're all just kind of walking around and over time they end up kind of walking in a line And then they start marching in a line, and then they start marching in a circle very militaristic And then he's like.

720
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:23,650
Rym: I think you've learned the lesson.

721
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:31,390
Scott: So anything else we got to say about this besides an obligatory John Gabriel mention?

722
00:56:32,113 --> 00:56:35,990
Rym: I think that's pretty much it mainly just because we're gonna have to do more shows about this in the future.

723
00:56:36,031 --> 00:56:46,873
Rym: We've already gone a little long Shitcock so penny arcade has summed up one of the biggest failings of anonymity in all the world and Fortune-chan we

724
00:56:46,913 --> 00:56:49,078
Scott: talked about this before we have I'm sure fortune

725
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:55,739
Rym: mitigates this by being so anonymous that it doesn't matter and Other things don't deal with it very well.

726
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,670
Rym: counter-strike does not deal with it very well.

727
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:58,311
Scott: No, it doesn't.

728
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:09,381
Rym: but basically penny arcade made a comic entitled John Gabriel's greater internet fuckwad theory and I Proposed that this is internet fuckwad law.

729
00:57:09,501 --> 00:57:10,586
Rym: That's what I was about to say.

730
00:57:10,646 --> 00:57:11,610
Rym: This is not a theory.

731
00:57:11,911 --> 00:57:14,786
Rym: This is a law of the interaction of human beings.

732
00:57:15,148 --> 00:57:28,541
Rym: yep normal person plus anonymity plus audience equals Total fuckwad, and it's a picture of a nice guy.

733
00:57:28,581 --> 00:57:29,966
Scott: fuck water, so I forget these.

734
00:57:30,006 --> 00:57:31,230
Rym: total fuck wad is a total fuck.

735
00:57:31,371 --> 00:57:42,810
Rym: It's a picture of a nice guy plus You know a question mark anonymity plus an audience, you know an audience and the total fuck wad image It's just a guy yelling shit cock and his face is all mangled.

736
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:51,238
Rym: And if you've ever played counter-strike while no one may have actually said the word shit cock to you You know exactly what that word means.

737
00:57:51,278 --> 00:57:52,543
Rym: you know what shit cocking is.

738
00:57:52,884 --> 00:57:57,245
Rym: if someone says someone was shit cocking me You can imagine what kinds of words they were saying.

739
00:57:57,265 --> 00:58:00,850
Scott: yep Basically someone's anonymous.

740
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:05,763
Scott: So they can say something to you, and you'll have no idea who said it.

741
00:58:06,204 --> 00:58:08,170
Scott: They're gonna say something shit cocky.

742
00:58:08,573 --> 00:58:12,316
Scott: That's that's how people are Except for very few people.

743
00:58:12,897 --> 00:58:13,138
Rym: yep.

744
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:13,880
Rym: I will.

745
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:20,221
Rym: while I don't shit cock I have on occasion anonymously trolled people on some websites.

746
00:58:20,481 --> 00:58:25,462
Rym: while I am NOT a regular shit cockery I've done it in an ironic sense.

747
00:58:25,563 --> 00:58:39,709
Scott: I'll admit that I have Shat cocks in the past, and I probably will shit more cocks in the future mostly playing counter-strike Maybe maybe playing some other games or possibly not even playing games at all.

748
00:58:46,381 --> 00:58:48,968
