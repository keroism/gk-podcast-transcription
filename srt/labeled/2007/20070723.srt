1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Rym: Welcome all of you new listeners from ConnectiCon and Otakon.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,900
Rym: Before we get any further, I just want to point out that this is not a normal episode of GeekNights.

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:09,366
Scott: No, it is not.

4
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:13,549
Scott: It is nothing like our normal episodes, and you can listen to this if you want.

5
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:18,880
Scott: It's probably going to be entertaining in some small way, but you should not judge our show based upon this episode.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,944
Rym: Or even pretty much anything you hear this week, because in fact, we're out of town.

7
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:25,560
Rym: Con season's over for us until December.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,588
Rym: So we're relaxing and planning the future of GeekNights in Wildwood, New Jersey.

9
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:39,053
Scott: And we recorded a bunch of little things in advance, or acquired them in advance, and we are playing them for you this week via the magic of computers.

10
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:39,960
Rym: And the internet.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,070
Scott: So these are recorded at least a week ago, and you're just listening to them now, so don't judge us on these.

12
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:54,210
Rym: Yes, if you want to hear what GeekNights is really about, just go to the website www.frontrowcrew.com Which you should have already been to.

13
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:56,384
Rym: They might have just gone to iTunes, it's hard to say.

14
00:00:56,927 --> 00:01:04,531
Rym: But listen to any episode, any one that does not have the word "special" in the title, because "special" is code.

15
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:07,938
Rym: speak at GeekNights for "Rym and Scott are out of town and too lazy to do a

16
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:08,119
Rym: show.".

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,840
Scott: And while you're at it, try to pick an episode with a topic you care about.

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,909
Rym: Yeah, and just real quick, I'll let you know that GeekNights is actually four different late night shows.

19
00:01:16,372 --> 00:01:20,775
Rym: Monday nights are science, technology, computing, all that sort of stuff, Linuxes, Ubuntu's.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:31,196
Rym: Tuesdays are gaming, so like German board games, or I guess we don't want to offend that nerdy guy from Connecticut, so tactical euro based games.

21
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:31,960
Scott: I don't know.

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,971
Rym: Yeah, and video games and all that stuff.

23
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:38,219
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, the one you probably care about the most, and manga and comics and all that.

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,515
Rym: And Thursdays are pretty much just whatever else we want to talk about, kind of the op-ed, Rants and Raves.

25
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:45,140
Scott: Yep.

26
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:50,280
Scott: So, today we're just gonna talk about a little tiny thing and get this over with.

27
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:55,609
Scott: So, I was looking around the room for something to talk about, and I said, "Hey, Rims got a mouse there.

28
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:57,117
Scott: Let's talk about computer

29
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:57,378
Scott: mice.".

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,379
Rym: See, Scott and I differ on mice in one way, though we also agree on another thing very much, and I'm just gonna get this straight out.

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,100
Scott: Okay, well first of all, mice that are not USB suck.

32
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:07,826
Scott: Yeah.

33
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:10,348
Scott: Second of all, mice that are not optical suck.

34
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:18,233
Rym: Third, tracked balls are awesome for very specific things like Rampart, or if you have carpal tunnel, they otherwise suck.

35
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:18,739
Scott: Yes.

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,211
Scott: People who talk about tracked balls like they're so much better, it's like, "Whatever, dude.

37
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:23,676
Scott: You got a

38
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:24,000
Scott: problem.".

39
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,636
Rym: They're not as bad as those Dvorak people.

40
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:26,858
Rym: Yes.

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,665
Scott: Tablets are okay as a pointing device, but they're not mice, so they don't count.

42
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:42,540
Rym: Now, the real big thing I want to get out there is that you pretty much should be using your mouse at the highest sensitivity you can bear, because one, that'll prevent carpal tunnel as far as I can see, because you're not moving your wrist hardly at all.

43
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:48,779
Rym: I mean, I flick my fingers, just my fingers, a half an inch, and I can cover my entire screen pretty much.

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,260
Scott: Yes.

45
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:58,860
Scott: Mouse sensitivity is basically if the mouse says I moved an inch, then that moves the arrow on the screen a certain distance on the monitor.

46
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:11,580
Scott: If you have low sensitivity, then moving the mouse an inch will move the arrow on the screen an inch, which means you have to pick up the mouse and move the mouse around a whole lot in order to move the arrow on the screen around a whole lot.

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,540
Rym: Also, if you got to move it slowly like that, you're going to be turning your wrist and twisting your wrist and moving your wrist.

48
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,460
Scott: And you're going to be using your whole arm to move that.

49
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,600
Rym: You shouldn't be moving your wrist when you're using a mouse.

50
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,980
Rym: You're going to hurt yourself if you keep doing that.

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,620
Scott: If you turn your sensitivity way, way up, right?

52
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,382
Scott: Sure.

53
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:32,058
Scott: At first, it might feel like the mouse is out of control, because you move it even a little bit and the arrow flies all over the place.

54
00:03:32,118 --> 00:03:32,540
Scott: out of control.

55
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,935
Scott: You can't aim at anything, but...

56
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
Rym: Increase it gradually and you'll get used to it.

57
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,519
Scott: If you practice with it, you can just use your thumb and your pinky to move the mouse in millimeters.

58
00:03:42,882 --> 00:03:46,120
Rym: And yet you still have the fine control due to things like acceleration.

59
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,340
Scott: Yes, you have precision control over the arrow on the screen while barely moving your hand at all.

60
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:53,959
Scott: And that's the way I say it should be.

61
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,979
Scott: And you should learn to do that.

62
00:03:55,581 --> 00:03:56,980
Rym: But anyway, we're not going to talk about that.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,800
Rym: You don't need a lecture from us on that topic.

64
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,459
Rym: You need a lecture from us on a bunch of other topics.

65
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:06,120
Rym: So there's only one kind of mouse that I will use and I can't stand any other mouse.

66
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,460
Rym: Mice have to be the standard mouse size or smaller.

67
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:12,340
Rym: And they got to have two buttons and a scroll wheel in the middle.

68
00:04:12,726 --> 00:04:13,579
Rym: And nothing else.

69
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:20,260
Scott: I need a mouse with more buttons and I need a mouse with wireless.

70
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,560
Scott: And I need a mouse with the fanciness and the comfort of the hand.

71
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,600
Rym: See, the problem is a lot of cheaper wireless mice.

72
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,240
Rym: There's a tiny delay that just bothers me.

73
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,660
Scott: That's a cheap wireless mouse.

74
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,520
Scott: You got to get a high quality wireless mouse or it's not worth it.

75
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,316
Rym: See, now I don't mind the thumb button so much or even the pinky button, but...

76
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,119
Scott: The pinky button is no good.

77
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:46,340
Rym: I think the real problem for me is that any mouse that has all these things, it's like all modern fancy mice have this big hump in them, especially the wireless mice.

78
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,398
Rym: They stick the batteries in there.

79
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:51,000
Rym: And I don't like the palm of my hand to touch my mouse.

80
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,878
Rym: It really bothers me.

81
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:53,260
Scott: Oh, I don't know why it bothers you.

82
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,120
Scott: I like the mouse.

83
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:01,340
Rym: I touch my mouse at any given time with all my fingers, like the tips of all my fingers and no other part of my body ever touches the mouse.

84
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,060
Scott: See, I like the mouse to feel like a glove on the bottom of my hand.

85
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,120
Scott: Like if they made a mouse like finger grooves.

86
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:08,338
Scott: No, that's bad.

87
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,360
Rym: Because if the mouse is touching the palm of your hand, you cannot prevent yourself from moving your wrist back and forth at least a little.

88
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,457
Scott: Yeah, I can.

89
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:16,198
Rym: How?

90
00:05:17,503 --> 00:05:18,719
Scott: It just slides on my hand.

91
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:20,878
Rym: I'm not seeing it.

92
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:22,719
Scott: I don't know what your problem is.

93
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:23,240
Rym: I don't know.

94
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,280
Rym: I think you use mice weird.

95
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:25,220
Scott: I mean, I don't know.

96
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,180
Scott: I think you use mice weird.

97
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,900
Rym: I use mice in the most possible, awesome way you could use them.

98
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,174
Scott: No, no.

99
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,080
Scott: But anyway, I have the Logitech MX1000 and I think it's a pretty awesome mouse.

100
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:40,120
Rym: I have these... Well, there used to be back in the day, there were like two Logitech mice that were optical.

101
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:43,020
Rym: There was the normal one and the slightly fancier one.

102
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,239
Rym: And I bought the slightly fancier one.

103
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:44,958
Scott: Let's talk a little bit here.

104
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,477
Scott: My original mouse that I had... Well, okay.

105
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,480
Scott: I first had an IBM whatever, right?

106
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,480
Scott: And I had like a Mac mouse with one button.

107
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,199
Scott: That doesn't count.

108
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,860
Scott: The first mouse I bought was a three button, no wheel, Logitech Wingman gaming mouse.

109
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:04,720
Scott: It was a wired USB mouse with a ball, but the ball was like double sized for precision gaming.

110
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:07,340
Scott: And that was the height of mouse technology in those days.

111
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:09,280
Scott: It was such the height of technology.

112
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:12,620
Scott: That the mouse cost $50 and came with a free game.

113
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,100
Scott: That was awesome.

114
00:06:16,563 --> 00:06:20,340
Scott: Then I moved on to Logitech optical mice, two buttons and a wheel.

115
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:23,380
Scott: And then I moved on to the MX1000 that I have today.

116
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:27,380
Rym: I've been using the same mouse since 1999.

117
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:27,470
Scott: Wow.

118
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,140
Rym: And I'm still using it right now.

119
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,480
Scott: I think you bought a new version of the same one, right?

120
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,860
Rym: No, I bought a new keyboard.

121
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,939
Scott: I thought you bought the same mouse just again.

122
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:38,860
Rym: No, I actually, what I did do, I don't remember that.

123
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,320
Rym: I remember buying the same mouse to use on another computer.

124
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,120
Scott: I think you bought that.

125
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,720
Scott: I think that isn't the same mouse, but it's the same model.

126
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:48,499
Rym: I'm not sure because it's pretty beat up.

127
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,520
Rym: I don't remember buying a new one, but I might've even forgotten.

128
00:06:50,760 --> 00:07:01,620
Rym: But yeah, I do remember that I use the same keyboard from like 1996 up until my junior year of RIT where one day while I was playing tribes, it just stopped.

129
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:03,696
Scott: Well, the reason I liked the MX1000.

130
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,940
Rym: No, it wasn't even tribes.

131
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,760
Rym: It was like Counter-Strike.

132
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,260
Scott: The reason I like the MX1000 is first of all, you can just charge it in a cradle instead of batteries, which is nice.

133
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:13,020
Rym: I hate batteries.

134
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,600
Rym: At least I don't like batteries.

135
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,940
Scott: If I'm going to get a wireless mouse, it better not have batteries.

136
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,500
Scott: Well, actually the wireless mouse that goes to my laptop has batteries, but that's obvious.

137
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,160
Scott: That's different.

138
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:21,780
Scott: That's different.

139
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:30,100
Scott: Two, you can move the scroll wheel left and right for some horizontal scrolling action, which you can actually get used to.

140
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:30,777
Scott: It's pretty nice.

141
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:37,700
Scott: Third, it has these extra buttons on it, but the extra buttons aren't clumsy and they actually click solidly.

142
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,700
Scott: And when I'm playing an FPS, I can actually get a lot of extra functionality out of them.

143
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,300
Scott: And some of them are, you know, I can push some of them simultaneous with other buttons.

144
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:51,620
Scott: So like I can use, you know, a button on the keyboard to say jump.

145
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,480
Scott: Normally I can move that to the mouse.

146
00:07:53,841 --> 00:08:01,980
Scott: And now I've got an extra keyboard button within reach and I can do a lot more FPS controlling with moving my hand around the keyboard a lot less.

147
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,679
Scott: I keep my hand in the same spot and I can do a lot more things.

148
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,319
Rym: See, now I think this might be why we have different tastes in mice and why I don't need the extra buttons.

149
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:17,099
Rym: The way I set my hands on the keyboard, I have never in all the FPS I've ever played, not had a key ready to go.

150
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,280
Rym: And I actually, I can do all the things I need to do simultaneously as it is.

151
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:31,200
Scott: So in some FPS is, you know, I can do that even if I have, you know, a one button mouse because I just need the one button to shoot and I've got buttons for everything else, you know, on the keyboard.

152
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,580
Scott: But some FPSs are really complicated and sometimes I want buttons to do crazy things.

153
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:40,679
Scott: And sometimes it's not an option without extra buttons on the mouse or moving my hand around.

154
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,940
Scott: Like FPS, especially FPS with inventories with full of items.

155
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,420
Rym: Yeah, but even then I think part of that is that you put your hand over by the arrow keys.

156
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,699
Scott: No, I put it by the WASD.

157
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:51,157
Rym: Oh, the WASD.

158
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:52,659
Rym: But there's plenty of buttons there.

159
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:53,658
Rym: What's wrong with you?

160
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:54,878
Scott: I need more buttons.

161
00:08:55,124 --> 00:08:55,840
Rym: There's plenty of buttons.

162
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,780
Rym: I've never run out of buttons.

163
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:05,680
Scott: The other thing is that a lot of the buttons I would like to use are, you know, too far away from the WASD or they screw up because gaming is in Windows.

164
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,879
Scott: Like the window key fucks everything up and the alt key fucks everything up.

165
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:09,779
Rym: Alt doesn't.

166
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,359
Rym: I don't have any problems with that.

167
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:11,717
Scott: I do.

168
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,338
Scott: I have problems pushing alt in.

169
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:15,380
Rym: I use alt to duck.

170
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,000
Rym: I've used alt to duck for as long as there's been ducking in FPSs.

171
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,300
Scott: I use a lot more keyboard shortcuts than you and a lot of them are global keyboard shortcuts.

172
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:26,158
Scott: So I can't use those buttons in FPSs.

173
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,900
Rym: But you play FPSs in Windows.

174
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
Rym: Why would you have those shortcuts in Windows?

175
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:30,180
Rym: You never use Windows.

176
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,539
Scott: I use Launchy in Windows.

177
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,270
Rym: Yeah?

178
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,280
Scott: Yeah, so I can't push like alt and space at the same time and stuff like that.

179
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,319
Scott: And you'd be surprised that actually comes up.

180
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:39,577
Rym: You know what?

181
00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:41,680
Rym: I don't have Launchy on my PC at home.

182
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,879
Rym: I only have it on the PC at work because I only boot into Windows to play FPSs.

183
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Rym: I never run anything but Steam.

184
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,456
Scott: I use Launchy to launch my FPSs.

185
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,140
Rym: But I just, Steam starts when I boot.

186
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,060
Rym: Basically, Windows is not Windows.

187
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:54,319
Rym: Windows is just Steam.

188
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,639
Rym: When I boot, Steam starts.

189
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:56,616
Rym: And that's it.

190
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,940
Scott: Even so, I need lots of buttons.

191
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,219
Scott: Especially, like if I'm playing Tribes 2, I need lots of buttons.

192
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,580
Scott: And I like to put some buttons on the mouse.

193
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,079
Scott: I put jump and duck on the mouse.

194
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:05,960
Rym: I don't know.

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,860
Rym: I put move forward on the mouse and shoot.

196
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:08,700
Scott: Oh god.

197
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,320
Scott: I put move forward on W.

198
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,420
Rym: See, move forward, I use the same setup.

199
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,380
Scott: And then like, that's the other thing.

200
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,899
Scott: I use like Q to go fast.

201
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,900
Scott: And then like Tab to walk slow.

202
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,240
Scott: And then control.

203
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,857
Rym: Remember, control is like path lock.

204
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:26,099
Rym: We need to do a show on the setups we use in FPSs.

205
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:26,755
Scott: I think we do.

206
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,080
Rym: Because I really want to talk about the merits of mine.

207
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,000
Rym: I've got a pretty good system.

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,739
Scott: But think about that though.

209
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,120
Scott: FPS is the most important factor in deciding what mouse we buy.

210
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:35,539
Rym: You know what?

211
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,140
Rym: It was always that way.

212
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,120
Scott: Because without FPSs, I can use a two button scrollie wheel and I'm done.

213
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,740
Rym: Before FPSs, I didn't even notice what kind of mouse I had.

214
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,233
Scott: Yeah.

215
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,638
Scott: But yeah, computer mice.

216
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,380
Scott: Optical is important.

217
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:48,060
Rym: Whatever.

218
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:49,380
Rym: This wasn't the best episode.

219
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:49,879
Rym: No, it wasn't.

220
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,337
Rym: What do you want?

221
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,019
Rym: We're on the beach.

222
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,639
Rym: In fact, we're probably playing a video game at the beach right now on our DSs.

223
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,419
Scott: And those DSs don't have mice.
