1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,569
Scott: It's Wednesday January 17th.

2
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,559
Rym: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:19,577
Scott: Tonight we discuss our favoritest manga ever sanctuary.

4
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:22,277
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,902 --> 00:00:29,960
Rym: So we've been talking a lot about the upcoming Katsucon and how we're going to be having a GeekNights' extravaganza.

6
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:32,499
Scott: Yeah, when is this Katsucon?

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:33,581
Rym: Why?

8
00:00:33,621 --> 00:00:36,322
Rym: it's February 16th through 18th 2007 2007 what?

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,123
Scott: Where is it?

10
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:43,439
Rym: Well, it's at the Omni Shore hotel in Washington DC.

11
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:48,935
Scott: Oh, so anyone who is on the East Coast can come to Katsucon pretty easily.

12
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:54,096
Rym: now as we've said before I've been to Katsucon for many years and it's one of my favorite cons.

13
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:54,900
Rym: I have a good time there.

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,562
Rym: I always have.

15
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:59,558
Scott: I've heard many stories of Katsucon and I know all about it, but I never been.

16
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:04,194
Rym: yes You've heard some very high-class stories from Scott Johnson and mines adventures.

17
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:08,692
Scott: Oh, oh, I must say Definitely is very ritzy.

18
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:10,300
Scott: It would be the words you describe.

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,552
Rym: Well, actually the thing is they moved from Crystal City to this Omni Shore hotel.

20
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:33,440
Rym: So the Crystal City was okay, but Compared to what most hotels that host anime cons look like the Omni Shore Um is actually pretty ritzy and when I first walked in Thursday night last year All I could think was there are about a thousand breakable expensive things within reach right now.

21
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:43,620
Rym: There's shit low-hanging chandeliers, there's vases on mantles everywhere Fancy stuff all over the place really expensive-looking leather couches everywhere.

22
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:48,980
Scott: You know if you want to know about last year's Katsucon both us and anime world order have episodes about it.

23
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:59,817
Rym: in fact last year's Katsucon was probably one of the most important moments in anime podcasting history for that is when I Rym of GeekNights met Darryl Sarat of Darryl Sarat Incorporated.

24
00:01:59,998 --> 00:02:03,929
Rym: and Isn't it Sarat, you know, he says Sarat.

25
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:05,193
Rym: everyone else says Sarat.

26
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,180
Rym: I take that as a sign, huh?

27
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,691
Rym: Strange, I mean no one calls me de Castor because it doesn't.

28
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:14,560
Rym: oh, yeah, I know but no one might call you de coaster.

29
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,935
Rym: No, no one's ever mispronounced my last name.

30
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:19,766
Scott: Yeah That's because it's pronounced the way it looks.

31
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:20,528
Rym: Yeah.

32
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,511
Rym: Yeah, though.

33
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:25,387
Rym: Once I was asked if I was Hispanic to which I said no That's da Costa.

34
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:28,537
Rym: Yeah No, I think I'm kidding now.

35
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:34,480
Rym: They were trying to guess what Hispanic country I was from and I was like, I'm Belgian.

36
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:41,178
Rym: But anyway, we met and as a result, we know about anime world order and they know about us.

37
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:47,720
Scott: Yeah Well, I knew about animal order before but I didn't listen to it cuz I didn't trust any of those anime podcasts.

38
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,908
Rym: I thought I still don't trust most anime podcast.

39
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:52,276
Scott: Yeah, totally but I trust them.

40
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:57,235
Scott: now I get kinda And I trust some other people, you know our people everywhere.

41
00:02:57,255 --> 00:02:58,239
Scott: all our people know who they are.

42
00:02:58,582 --> 00:03:00,676
Rym: Yeah, but regardless Katsucon is a great con.

43
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:05,379
Rym: believe me We were probably going to have some sort of pregame for Katsucon since we're going in force this year.

44
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,776
Scott: Yeah, we'll try to one and a half to two episodes on plus.

45
00:03:08,796 --> 00:03:17,562
Rym: there's a good chance We'll be putting up some content throughout the weekend since we'll basically have all of our equipment set up in the gaming room for the Entire con.

46
00:03:18,184 --> 00:03:23,660
Scott: also if all goes well, we'll probably be creating content like for Katsucon.

47
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:28,980
Rym: Yes, we may be running our famous anime match game, which was very much well received at city con.

48
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:37,299
Scott: So if you want the the full GeekNights action You pretty much have to go to Katsucon because if they're gonna let us go all out We're gonna go all out.

49
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:45,433
Rym: We may even have some of the earliest earliest vestiges of swag in the tiniest of quantities Which you will only be able to get if you see us at Katsucon.

50
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:46,257
Scott: Well, yeah.

51
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:51,503
Rym: Yeah Granted every word I said should be taken literally Mm-hmm.

52
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:57,748
Rym: Now also the news here is not that we're gonna be doing crazy stuff at Katsucon or that Katsucon is awesome Or that you should go.

53
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:18,660
Rym: the news here Which is nothing to do with any of you is that despite the fact that they've said that the Omni Shore Motel where Katsucon Is situated has been sold out for quite a while now Either that is not true or I'm the luckiest Goddamn guy in the world because I was able to acquire through various means a room at this hotel throughout the entire convention.

54
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:19,783
Scott: Awesome.

55
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:29,739
Rym: now as a result The rest of the front row crew may indeed have to find their own accommodations because I'm not cramming 20 or 30 people into a one-bed room.

56
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:35,884
Scott: Yeah Plus we're gonna bring a lot of shit with us and we're gonna have a lot of stuff to do and not so much time To hang out.

57
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:40,005
Rym: So yeah see in the front row crew generally for conventions We tend to plan it all.

58
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:49,537
Rym: we tend to get the hotel take all the money make the reservations make the travel plans Wake everyone up take make everyone get out of the room collect the keys dole the keys out blah blah blah.

59
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:57,528
Rym: and You know This is probably gonna be the first con where a lot of people are going where I'm just tossing my hands in the air and I'm Taking care of me and GeekNights.

60
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,360
Scott: Yeah, we just have too much GeekNights stuff to do that.

61
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,680
Scott: We can't take care of anyone else besides ourselves at this convention.

62
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:08,240
Scott: Yeah, I mean not only that but other conventions where we do a lot less we can help other people out.

63
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:14,879
Rym: We might not even have a chance to actually hang out much in the traditional way We do cuz we're pretty much gonna be running events the whole con.

64
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:20,780
Scott: Oh unless you know people come to our events, which I'm sure they will or yeah come hang out in the video game room.

65
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,640
Scott: But yeah, I just hope there aren't too many real.

66
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:27,697
Scott: Yeah, I hope that Kazuka doesn't have too many good events that I want to go to.

67
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:30,498
Scott: Oh, no Yes, I won't be able to go to them.

68
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:33,747
Scott: I'll probably end up going to like the dealer's room.

69
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:35,854
Scott: Maybe like once late Sunday.

70
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:36,115
Scott: Yes.

71
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:36,516
Scott: Sure.

72
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,138
Scott: Their dealer's room.

73
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:37,800
Scott: Isn't that amazing?

74
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:46,175
Rym: Anyway, I imagine Scott and I will be pulling shifts where one of us will be wacky radio guy in the gaming room while the Other one goes and does, you know con stuff.

75
00:05:46,457 --> 00:05:48,385
Scott: Yeah We'll see how it goes.

76
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:48,968
Scott: It should be fun.

77
00:05:49,530 --> 00:06:03,430
Rym: Yeah, though speaking of anime news that isn't related to Katsucon There was an article recently that got dig up about how some anime clubs of aimed at teenagers high school kids and communities are Flourishing in libraries now.

78
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,880
Scott: This is something we've known about for a long time.

79
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,040
Rym: Yes, the new is not news that this is happening that anime clubs are springing up all over.

80
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:12,180
Scott: It is news that someone wrote a newspaper article.

81
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:15,106
Rym: Yes The mainstream news has picked this up.

82
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:21,589
Rym: anime clubs at local libraries and Alex lodges and whatnot are starting to get noticed by normal people.

83
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:29,257
Rym: in fact It's getting to the point that many libraries because most libraries now have a wide selection of older DVDs for people to check out I think is wonderful.

84
00:06:30,108 --> 00:06:35,260
Rym: They're adding anime To the libraries because there is such a demand and it draws a lot of kids.

85
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:44,780
Rym: In fact, it draws a lot of people in in general and there are stories about libraries that have Practically doubled their takeout rate just by adding a mildly extensive anime library.

86
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:47,710
Scott: There are also a lot of libraries adding manga.

87
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:59,166
Scott: I mean, you know those posters they read on them Well, they constantly make more of those and they get more famous people to make them and such one of them has art from of Things Cantarella on it.

88
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:00,940
Scott: that was on anime news network a week few weeks.

89
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:07,482
Rym: Wow, if you're going for the 14 to 22 year old female shoujo demographic Mm-hmm.

90
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:11,135
Scott: Just get a big ol read poster with a picture that cantarella guy.

91
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:15,748
Rym: Yeah, Cesare Borgia Yeah, my favorite Pope and you can put that.

92
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,320
Scott: you can actually buy that poster at the library Association website.

93
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:22,940
Scott: Yeah, but I think they also have bookmarks.

94
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:23,923
Rym: I guess this is.

95
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:27,895
Rym: I mean, this is definitely not a sign to say that anime is now 100% mainstream.

96
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:34,520
Scott: blah No, it's a sign that libraries are suffering and anime and manga are a way to help the libraries out.

97
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:34,863
Scott: Well, I

98
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:50,400
Rym: think it's also a sign that Anime while it is not mainstream This is definitely one of those tiny junctures where if you tanning 20 years from now you look at the history of anime in America We're in one of the eras where one of those tiny little junctures one of those little boosts before another plateau comes.

99
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:55,302
Rym: I think if this trend continues, we're gonna see a lot more Anime.

100
00:07:55,683 --> 00:08:01,080
Rym: anime related Banga Japanese related things being used in educational capacities.

101
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:09,499
Scott: I think what it is is that libraries have been places where people can get access to information to entertainment, you know for free.

102
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:19,919
Scott: and Anime and manga are like, you know of all the possible types of entertainment we have now, you know We have pop music and movies and all this stuff.

103
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:27,420
Scott: Anime and manga are sort of a little more intellectual than you know, the other types of entertainment don't get us wrong.

104
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:30,471
Rym: I mean that is definitely a generalization.

105
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:38,207
Scott: Oh, yeah, there's plenty of dumbass mug Naruto and Dragon Ball if I know means intellectual.

106
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:50,720
Scott: but on the whole, you know, there tends to be sort of this, you know Like culture about it, you know It's like if you read anime and manga while you're cultured and libraries are all about making people more cultured.

107
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:56,400
Scott: So and you know kids like it and libraries are all about getting kids into the library as much as possible.

108
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:59,811
Scott: So anime and manga the libraries like it the kids like it.

109
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:01,015
Scott: It all works out good.

110
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:01,898
Scott: Everyone saves money.

111
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:02,420
Scott: Everyone's happy.

112
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:11,748
Rym: I think it's also a sign of generally a trend that despite how the anime industry is doing which for many reports not so well Anime in terms of popularity.

113
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:13,695
Rym: I think is doing wonderfully.

114
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:15,080
Rym: In fact, it's growing rapidly.

115
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:23,840
Scott: And yeah, I mean, there's a lot of people who aren't necessarily in our anime fan group But like, you know, they'll just be some guy, you know, he watches sports.

116
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:29,819
Scott: He watches, you know, the the non anime and Adult Swim and you know, maybe watches some.

117
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,576
Scott: You know some spike TV once in a while, you know, he's looking through the channels.

118
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,600
Scott: He'll stop on an anime.

119
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:36,911
Scott: You know, it's there.

120
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:41,897
Scott: not a lot of people out There aren't anime fans now like we are we're you know, we watch the anime.

121
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:42,600
Scott: we know about them.

122
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:44,650
Scott: You watch old giant robot shows.

123
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,740
Scott: they don't care about watching whole series.

124
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:54,329
Scott: I don't care about watching every anime there is or knowing about all of them, but Anime isn't some scary thing.

125
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:55,514
Scott: They're not gonna watch anymore.

126
00:09:55,574 --> 00:09:57,040
Scott: It's like hey, there's an anime cool.

127
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:11,620
Rym: Yeah, plus I mean these clubs are sprouting up and I know anime world order talked a lot about how they think anime clubs seem to be dying, but I Guess it's a regional thing because up here these clubs are springing up practically everywhere at a fairly rapid clip.

128
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:14,936
Scott: I think it's just these style of anime clubs that is.

129
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:15,800
Scott: you know, we're dying.

130
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:18,470
Scott: It's like the old style of anime club is going away.

131
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:19,936
Scott: The new style is doing well.

132
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:23,280
Rym: Yeah, well I'm cuz up here I mean for the last five to ten years actually.

133
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:33,985
Rym: Yeah About the last ten years now a lot of the big anime clubs are definitely not Like the old big anime clubs used to be but as a result due to the fact that the fan base is bigger These clubs are even bigger.

134
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:38,620
Scott: Yeah, it's tough to have a special interest club for something that is widely available.

135
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:46,360
Scott: It's like you can't have I don't know a Harry Potter Club on campus because only the crazy Harry Potter fans will come.

136
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,867
Scott: And what are you gonna do there?

137
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:50,800
Scott: Hey, you got to have a club about something.

138
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:56,320
Scott: That's you know, if it's just a club of consumption and nothing else you need to have that club.

139
00:10:56,841 --> 00:10:59,350
Scott: You know do something besides the consuming.

140
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:06,234
Scott: if everyone can consume it or the thing they're consuming has to be rare Yep, or if it's not rare you can also add rarity or add.

141
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:09,480
Rym: I hate to use business terms But there's a value add.

142
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:16,120
Rym: I mean if you're just say clubs just shows anime and that's it every week that show some anime Great, you can get anime anywhere.

143
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:25,959
Rym: So all you got to do is have the value add of watching anime in a crowd is always better than watching it alone Especially if it's a funny anime or a giant robot anime.

144
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:30,559
Scott: You're reading Harry Potter, you know doesn't add anything when there's some fangirl next to you.

145
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:38,604
Rym: however also reading Harry if you like Harry Potter and you get a bunch of people who love Harry Potter and you all go to watch a Harry Potter movie together.

146
00:11:39,226 --> 00:11:40,390
Rym: That's a value add now.

147
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,440
Rym: You'll all yell and scream when Snape does something wonderful.

148
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:44,910
Scott: I guess all right.

149
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,139
Rym: What do you mean you guess?

150
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,419
Rym: Don't pretend that your like of Japanese cartoons is somehow superior to someone else's like of American movies.

151
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:57,980
Scott: You're allowed to not like Harry Potter, I'm just yeah, I'm just saying I don't like Harry Potter.

152
00:11:58,221 --> 00:11:59,105
Rym: I know see here's the thing.

153
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:00,792
Rym: I like the story of Harry Potter a lot.

154
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,580
Scott: No, I really kind of don't know.

155
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,410
Rym: I like the story.

156
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:04,240
Rym: I like the characters.

157
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:11,202
Rym: I think the movies are kind of lame and I really absolutely hate the novels because the writing to me is just Horrible.

158
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:14,916
Rym: I can't stand the way that I just think the whole idea is sort of it's like.

159
00:12:15,077 --> 00:12:15,820
Scott: it's a good idea.

160
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,609
Scott: It's like a kid in the wizard school.

161
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,000
Scott: Just like Naruto is a good idea kid in the ninja school.

162
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:21,143
Scott: Ah, so genius.

163
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:31,635
Scott: then we need to make kid in the pirate school next but it's just so played out that sort of story That I'm just kind of yeah, I don't think it's that played out especially in cinema.

164
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:33,080
Scott: I think it's played out for me.

165
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,984
Scott: Yeah, I guess I agree in movies is not played out But for me it is.

166
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:41,688
Scott: we had the same argument the other day about how I just read so many books like that when I Was a kid that I'm just like whatever.

167
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:43,620
Rym: Well, we were arguing over the weekend about dragons.

168
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,131
Rym: It's like Oh dragons are totally played out in fantasy.

169
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:48,100
Rym: And then the answer was maybe in fans.

170
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,086
Scott: I guess I wasn't there for that.

171
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:51,580
Rym: I know you weren't okay, but not in fantasy movies.

172
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,209
Rym: How many dragon movies have there been in recent memory that it?

173
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:54,751
Scott: that is true.

174
00:12:54,771 --> 00:12:59,285
Scott: There are not enough dragons and movies except for Dragonheart yeah and rain of fire.

175
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:00,428
Scott: Oh, that doesn't count.

176
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:01,711
Rym: that movie can die in a fire.

177
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:02,553
Scott: Okay.

178
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:05,059
Scott: Anyway, so I got a news.

179
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:14,162
Scott: Everyone knows that in Japan, you know The manga typically comes in the big foam books every week and they they're like two bucks and it's awesome Mm-hmm.

180
00:13:14,664 --> 00:13:26,160
Scott: Well get and that's pretty sad because in this country, you know, you can get a comic book Which is maybe 32 pages and eight of those pages are ads and it's three dollars and change and it comes once a month.

181
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:33,222
Rym: Yeah, but they'll argue it's all shiny and glossy and has 16 million colors Right.

182
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:34,648
Scott: Well, that's not what they say.

183
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,077
Scott: that what they actually say is not.

184
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:37,600
Scott: you know?

185
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,113
Scott: Oh our comics are better and worth this money because they're in color.

186
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:42,987
Scott: what they say is no one would buy it if it wasn't in color.

187
00:13:44,062 --> 00:13:45,553
Scott: That's what they say Wow.

188
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:51,898
Scott: Anyway In Japan get ready for some sadness because well sadness for the u.s.

189
00:13:53,101 --> 00:14:06,999
Scott: There's going to be a new manga magazine called comic ganbo ganbo and it's going to be Distributed at 30 different Tokyo area train stations and there's gonna be a hundred thousand copies and they're gonna be free.

190
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:17,499
Scott: ha now I imagine it's not gonna be as big as like a big fat shonen jump and I imagine it'll be loaded with ads and It'll probably be on cheap paper and black and white and all that.

191
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:21,160
Scott: But it's gonna have more than 24 pages of comic content.

192
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,329
Scott: That's I mean, it doesn't.

193
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,608
Scott: I'd haven't read that anywhere It's just a guess but it's got it.

194
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:28,300
Scott: this because no one else had even bother picking it up.

195
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,208
Rym: Yeah, putting out that small amount of content.

196
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:35,720
Rym: I mean I could distribute a one-page flyer around beacon, but yeah exactly.

197
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:37,664
Scott: So it's gonna.

198
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:46,739
Scott: it's they're giving away things that are have more content than American comics Which cost three dollars or maybe even four dollars for free in Japan.

199
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:53,100
Rym: You know Japan just gets all the breaks except for DVD prices, I think yes it evens out.

200
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:54,424
Scott: I think this is just.

201
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:59,519
Scott: you know, I mean if there wasn't a wake-up call to the American comics industry before this is it?

202
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:10,648
Scott: I mean, come on You're trying to compete not with piracy free but with legitimate free And you're losing and you're charging more.

203
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:15,985
Scott: you have a worse product for more money than what someone else is doing for free Legally.

204
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:16,530
Scott: yeah,

205
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:25,647
Rym: I mean I remember a while ago We had the news of you know top selling books and top selling print items and manga sells real freakin well, that's

206
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:41,520
Scott: like if I was trying to sell a DVD for $30 that had a half-hour single episode of a TV show on it and Some other guy was selling a VHS with a five-hour movie for $2, which one am I gonna buy?

207
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:43,366
Rym: Yeah, meanwhile it could be.

208
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:49,250
Rym: I mean it's like there's the reverse wake-up call in Japan of just the fact that DVDs there cost more than my soul.

209
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,380
Scott: and yeah, it's totally backwards.

210
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:51,902
Rym: They wonder.

211
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:56,880
Scott: they wonder movies and TV over here the wind and in Japan comics of the wind.

212
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,844
Scott: I think we need to trade.

213
00:15:58,205 --> 00:16:01,920
Scott: we'll give you all our cheap DVDs and you give us all your cheap comics.

214
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:04,908
Rym: Yeah, I'm real down with that.

215
00:16:05,068 --> 00:16:15,739
Scott: I need a big old cultural exchange going on Things of the day.

216
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:20,058
Scott: Actually found this thing just recently and it's pretty damn awesome.

217
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:20,600
Rym: Oh, really?

218
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:27,620
Scott: So there's a guy in a DJ competition and well, I think we've said before what we think about the two turntable DJs.

219
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:29,643
Rym: Yeah in general.

220
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:33,394
Rym: I'm not that impressed with most to tear turn to turn tabling.

221
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:38,307
Rym: Yeah, I mean I'd much rather hear Pre-created well done techno.

222
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:45,560
Scott: I mean the thing is, you know to turntable mastering is quite a skill that takes a you know Great deal of effort and time and it is respectable skill.

223
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:52,160
Scott: However, it's not really useful skill because you can accomplish generating the same sound or better with a lot less effort.

224
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:56,980
Scott: It's like people are doing things the hard old-school way just to be cool.

225
00:16:57,604 --> 00:17:05,421
Rym: I mean of all the clubs or dances or whatnot I've gone to pretty much the best one is just played good techno that I already knew about or even techno I didn't.

226
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:06,606
Rym: just basically albums.

227
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:07,648
Rym: they beat mix them together.

228
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:16,819
Scott: Yeah instead of having some records with some It's not really necessary to you know, mix things live between two turntables.

229
00:17:17,464 --> 00:17:17,969
Rym: Yeah, of course.

230
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:18,674
Rym: now there's the video DJ.

231
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,989
Scott: It's a skill that I can respect but it's not really.

232
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:28,012
Scott: it's like you can just mix it up at home on your computer and play It for me and I'd like that just as much because it would sound better.

233
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:28,515
Rym: Yeah.

234
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:28,817
Rym: Yeah.

235
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:29,218
Scott: Yeah.

236
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,970
Scott: Anyway, this guy though demonstrates his mad DJ skills.

237
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,060
Scott: He's got you know, he's got two discs - not discs.

238
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:41,795
Scott: He's got two vinyls spinning around playing this nice hip-hop beat and he's do.

239
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:43,420
Scott: he's in a DJ competition.

240
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,564
Scott: He's got a win right?

241
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:46,390
Scott: So he's got 30 seconds left.

242
00:17:46,872 --> 00:17:49,140
Scott: He takes off one of the you know, the vinyls.

243
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,169
Scott: He's got the other ones still going.

244
00:17:50,189 --> 00:17:51,239
Scott: he puts a new one on there.

245
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:55,112
Scott: He gets them all lined up without making anything sound stupid.

246
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:59,298
Scott: If you listen to both of these records going around It's just a really good hip-hop beat.

247
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:00,683
Scott: Groovin to it.

248
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:10,579
Scott: then he stops him and he kind of alternates between the two on like these few notes and he Basically plays the Imperial March.

249
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:24,860
Scott: If you don't know what the Imperial March is get the hell by alternating and you know scratching between notes on these two different records and everyone in the whole club or wherever he is starts going.

250
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,468
Rym: It's pretty well done it's pretty good.

251
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:36,379
Scott: I mean I was just watching it and I knew what it was and Ram is on the other side of the room not looking and he says is that the Imperial mark?

252
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:39,633
Scott: Yeah, that's what that is.

253
00:18:41,402 --> 00:18:48,534
Scott: And hey, let's go with the records and the hip-hop beat comes back and you're like, whoa You found a hip-hop beat that contains the notes at the Imperial March.

254
00:18:48,555 --> 00:18:49,719
Scott: That's pretty cool.

255
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:52,271
Rym: Well, there aren't so many notes in the Imperial March.

256
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:55,787
Scott: I know really analyze it I know but it's still.

257
00:18:56,269 --> 00:19:02,320
Scott: it took some practice and it took some Foresight to even think to do that in the first place.

258
00:19:02,702 --> 00:19:13,259
Rym: Well, anyway, as I promised I have a rather Japanese thing of the day Definitely better than the thing of the day from two days ago, even though those competitions in Japan are now my favorite sport.

259
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:15,588
Rym: Second only to hockey.

260
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:17,200
Scott: I was gonna say what the fuck hockey?

261
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:19,793
Rym: Well, see when I say favorite sport and I don't say hockey.

262
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:21,080
Rym: I think the hockey's implied.

263
00:19:21,842 --> 00:19:24,357
Scott: Well, some people you know, maybe this is the first episode they don't know.

264
00:19:24,377 --> 00:19:27,654
Rym: no No, I'm just talking about in general in life in the world.

265
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:28,980
Rym: The hockey is implied.

266
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:30,733
Rym: You just you don't even have to mention the hockey.

267
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:31,600
Rym: it is understood.

268
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:34,227
Scott: There's a lot of people who don't understand hockey.

269
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:36,132
Rym: No people in their hearts.

270
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:38,338
Rym: They know and they're lying to everyone and themselves.

271
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,735
Scott: Okay Yeah, or maybe they're just from below the Messier line.

272
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:42,519
Scott: They don't know what hockey is.

273
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:55,860
Rym: so a while ago Scott had a thing of the day which was a Japanese prank from some Japanese TV show where To to summarize very briefly people would go into what looked like a public restroom a porta-potty an attempt to urinate.

274
00:19:56,721 --> 00:20:04,919
Rym: While this happening a little countdown would start next to him and there's a hidden camera and they turn and look and think wow I wonder what those green lights mean.

275
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:15,099
Rym: I wonder where it'll happen when that red one lights up and then the roof would open and the entire thing would Launch up and put them on display for all the world to see.

276
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:17,230
Scott: It was pretty hilarious.

277
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:24,300
Scott: it was so hilarious I couldn't believe it and it's the kind of awesome prank you can't do in the United States because it just gets sued.

278
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,243
Rym: Yeah in the America.

279
00:20:25,263 --> 00:20:29,980
Rym: if you did that the first thing people say was I'm suing whoever's responsible for this in Japan?

280
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:33,115
Rym: People's first priority is getting their pants on.

281
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:33,879
Scott: Hey, yep.

282
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:37,791
Scott: So we thought what could possibly be better than that?

283
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:41,444
Rym: Well, let's say you're at a ski lodge You know, you're at a ski resort.

284
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:42,187
Rym: you're skiing.

285
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:46,500
Rym: you're out on the mountain way out in the middle of nowhere up at the top.

286
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,414
Rym: You've been skiing all day.

287
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,376
Rym: Now, let's say you see a nice wooden spa and you wonder what it is.

288
00:20:51,396 --> 00:20:52,220
Rym: you go in it's free.

289
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,367
Rym: It has a little room where you can take off all your stuff.

290
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:56,273
Rym: It's really warm and heated inside.

291
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:59,584
Rym: There's massage chairs Inside of it.

292
00:20:59,845 --> 00:21:01,653
Rym: You can put a little money in and they'll massage you.

293
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:02,980
Rym: there's a steam, you know, nice little thing.

294
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:04,926
Rym: So, oh, that'd be great.

295
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:07,518
Rym: I think now if I was skiing I would love something like that.

296
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,550
Rym: So, you know, you sit down and you don't know.

297
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:15,109
Rym: there's a hidden camera and you sit in this little chair and you're ready to go Turn on a little massage and you lay back.

298
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:22,079
Rym: You've just got a towel over your naughty bit, if anything And a little countdown goes down to your right, but you don't even notice it.

299
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:29,866
Rym: And then suddenly without warning the wall behind you opens up and the chair Catapults you out naked into the snow.

300
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,433
Rym: the chair then immediately retracts into the building.

301
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:36,145
Rym: the wall seals back up and you there is no Evidence that it ever opened.

302
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:39,763
Rym: you're now naked in front of a crowd of people in a pile of snow on the top of a mountain.

303
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:40,827
Scott: oh shit.

304
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:54,558
Scott: Even though I've watched seems that all these pranks are pretty much taking people in the situations Which they would comfortably get naked and then launching them outside of those situations without putting their clothes on.

305
00:21:54,939 --> 00:22:00,760
Rym: now It was funny on its own But then they had to go like they do with the previous thing one step further.

306
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:03,105
Scott: So went one step further.

307
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:07,519
Rym: now the one step further is perhaps one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

308
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,759
Rym: It's I'd say top 50 mostly because there's so much build up.

309
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:30,785
Rym: so the guys sitting there and then his friends watching him and then the cherries and just starts turning around like rotating to face the wall and you see he's saying something to his friend and his friends like her and they're both like what's Going on and then before they can react that the thing he had a rocket lights off on it And it launches him on.

310
00:22:30,845 --> 00:22:38,610
Rym: effectively a snowmobile sled naked down the mountain at incredibly high speed Naked in a chair with a rocket on it.

311
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:38,850
Scott: Well.

312
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:39,974
Scott: What looks like a rocket.

313
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:41,660
Scott: I don't think it's actually rocket propel.

314
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,443
Rym: No, I think it's just.

315
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:44,572
Scott: I think it's just like propelled by.

316
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:47,866
Scott: you know some sort of Tires or something.

317
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:49,071
Rym: it's still going pretty fast.

318
00:22:49,131 --> 00:22:50,155
Scott: It's going pretty fast.

319
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:51,500
Scott: It's got to be dangerous.

320
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:56,560
Rym: Oh, you should have seen the absolute look of horror and terror on the guy's face.

321
00:22:56,821 --> 00:23:00,233
Scott: Yeah, they must have tested that a couple times to make sure it wouldn't kill anybody.

322
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:05,654
Rym: of course the worst thing was the one where The chair would like flip out and dump you in the snow and then flip back in.

323
00:23:06,096 --> 00:23:07,260
Rym: one guy was laying over the towel.

324
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,440
Rym: So it flips him out and he falls into the snow and his towels kind of laying on the corner of it.

325
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:14,910
Rym: He turns around and his first instinct is to grab the towel.

326
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:21,617
Rym: the moment he reaches for it the chair goes back up with His towel and takes it back into the building Wanted.

327
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:31,560
Rym: So if you were a fan of pranks or naked people or Japan or snow I can't recommend this thing of the day enough.

328
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:53,944
Rym: So speaking of things that we can't recommend enough we have delayed Reviewing this manga for a long time Partly due to the fact that we didn't feel we could do it justice in the early days of GeekNights Partly because as soon as I looked at this manga again I had a burning desire to read it which is bad because I have more important things to be doing than rereading things I've already read.

329
00:23:54,386 --> 00:24:03,470
Rym: Yeah, it's part of the reason why I haven't read it again Despite a great desire, of course now that I've got a bunch of it piled up in front of me I've been reading random pages and I can't stop.

330
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,076
Rym: I might end up reading some of this tonight.

331
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:07,003
Rym: Oh No tonight.

332
00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:09,693
Rym: We're going to talk about in both of our opinions.

333
00:24:09,753 --> 00:24:11,840
Rym: Probably one of our favorite manga ever.

334
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:17,860
Scott: Also, it's arguable one of the best manga ever one of at least one of the best ones that we have access.

335
00:24:18,242 --> 00:24:25,874
Rym: Yes, I mean I could never say that any one manga was the best manga But this is this is not on the Kira Phoenix level.

336
00:24:25,975 --> 00:24:28,785
Scott: It's like on the level right under that It is definitely in the running.

337
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:31,153
Rym: It is in the top ten in my easily.

338
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:35,102
Rym: So we are going to talk about Sanctuary.

339
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:40,760
Scott: now, I don't think it's really fair for us to talk about sanctuary without saying it's out of print bitches.

340
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:46,146
Rym: We got it all and you don't you know how hard it was to get all of this How many years we searched.

341
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:49,396
Scott: well, I think what it was is someone mentioned sanctuary.

342
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:56,040
Scott: they said hey, you know There's this manga out there where one guy's a yakuza and one guy's a politician, you know.

343
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:02,918
Scott: And we all we knew is hey, there's a manga where that's the story and for years We never really came across it or anything, you know.

344
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:07,580
Scott: And then it's sort of boiled up into the spotlight and we eventually got issue one.

345
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,385
Scott: Where do we get issue one?

346
00:25:08,446 --> 00:25:10,439
Rym: for the thing is the year before we got it?

347
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:16,948
Rym: I had read issue one in the manga library of a convention And that is all that they had had.

348
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:21,824
Scott: and then that's how I discovered Phoenix in the Otakon Manga library.

349
00:25:21,925 --> 00:25:24,215
Rym: Yeah, so to anime cons keep the manga libraries.

350
00:25:24,235 --> 00:25:25,280
Rym: They definitely serve a purpose.

351
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:30,940
Rym: Yeah, so I'd read it and it was amazing and I didn't know there was 12 volumes of it.

352
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,537
Rym: I thought it was gonna be like a two or three volume little thing because it didn't seem like it could go.

353
00:25:34,597 --> 00:25:35,240
Scott: aren't there nine?

354
00:25:35,762 --> 00:25:37,168
Scott: How many are there 12?

355
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:37,549
Scott: Oh, wow.

356
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,080
Rym: There are 12 volumes of sanctuary, okay.

357
00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:47,898
Rym: So we all we became desperate Scott and I and the rest of the front row crew and started trying to get a hold of the other 11 volumes.

358
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:50,292
Scott: We eventually got a couple of the volumes.

359
00:25:50,855 --> 00:25:51,620
Rym: It was not easy.

360
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:52,444
Scott: No, it wasn't.

361
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,095
Scott: and you know, they belong to Rym, which I guess sir.

362
00:25:55,316 --> 00:25:58,369
Rym: Yeah, I own Sanctuary and you and all the good board games.

363
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,998
Rym: I owe a lot of the good manga.

364
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:03,359
Scott: Yeah I own lots of good manga - you do anyway, we.

365
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:12,770
Scott: Eventually when I was working in the city I started going to Midtown Comics every day and I noticed that Midtown Comics on the wall of manga They had sanctuary.

366
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,440
Rym: Yeah, they host all of it.

367
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,617
Scott: They had almost all the sanctuary that we didn't already have except for what volume?

368
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:20,460
Rym: for volume three.

369
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:21,879
Scott: It was like volume three.

370
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,245
Scott: So me and Rym in red.

371
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:23,927
Scott: one and two.

372
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:27,580
Scott: Rym had bought four through twelve and we didn't have three.

373
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,987
Rym: I wouldn't even look at the covers of them.

374
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:32,755
Rym: I was so afraid of ruining something also me.

375
00:26:33,397 --> 00:26:37,719
Rym: and then finally We got a whole and it was through Alex of the missing one.

376
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:42,219
Scott: Yeah, I don't know how or who got it, but someone I'm pretty sure Alex got issue three.

377
00:26:42,864 --> 00:26:44,398
Rym: Scott ended up paying for it.

378
00:26:44,922 --> 00:26:45,968
Rym: Even though I own it.

379
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,159
Rym: the deal was because he paid for it.

380
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,332
Rym: The only thing that he I had to do was let him read it first.

381
00:26:52,055 --> 00:26:53,240
Scott: Is that what I really do that?

382
00:26:53,743 --> 00:26:54,738
Scott: Yeah, because you paid for it.

383
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,940
Rym: No You did because then you read all the rest of sanctuary and you were pretty much one volume ahead of me the whole time.

384
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:02,389
Scott: Three is mine bitch.

385
00:27:02,631 --> 00:27:03,094
Rym: No, it's not.

386
00:27:03,134 --> 00:27:03,879
Rym: You said it was mine.

387
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:06,125
Scott: Remember that you trade.

388
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:07,168
Rym: you said very clearly.

389
00:27:07,188 --> 00:27:08,874
Scott: Yeah, I don't even remember paying for.

390
00:27:08,914 --> 00:27:09,898
Scott: I remember you paying for.

391
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:12,509
Scott: you said I mean I remember just me reading it first.

392
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:18,725
Rym: I may have paid for it, but I but Whatever.

393
00:27:18,745 --> 00:27:19,952
Scott: I just remember reading it first.

394
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,460
Scott: I don't remember paying but whatever.

395
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:25,577
Rym: Yeah, you you paid for it and you read it before me and then you just you have no idea.

396
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:26,300
Rym: You have no idea.

397
00:27:27,282 --> 00:27:29,580
Scott: Yeah, I remember I was desperate to read it first.

398
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:35,405
Scott: So I read number three first and then I burn through the rest of it because I didn't want Rym to hold me back by Holding on to an issue that I need.

399
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:38,580
Rym: in fact you read it at the shore to the exclusion of shore activities.

400
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:43,838
Scott: Oh, no that I think sanctuary and it can beat shore activities or is the least equivalent.

401
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:48,310
Rym: Yes So before we talk, I mean we're gonna review sanctuary.

402
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,073
Scott: Let's talk about.

403
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:53,020
Scott: let's not before we talk about what's in the manga Let's talk about some of the meta information.

404
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:01,665
Rym: Yes, because sanctuary is kind of the tip of the iceberg of this whole other world of manga that many of you have probably never Seen yes.

405
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:07,760
Scott: Well, the first thing you have to know about sanctuary is That there is also an OAV and that is not what you want.

406
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,979
Rym: Yes, if you see a VHS tape of sanctuary avoid it like a lens.

407
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:12,140
Rym: min.

408
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,368
Scott: Well, we have it and it's actually a pretty faithful Animation of the first couple volumes.

409
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:20,560
Rym: Yeah, but it's like every OAV from a manga.

410
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,549
Rym: It's a bunch of scenes that you'd like to see animated animated.

411
00:28:23,689 --> 00:28:27,560
Rym: Okay, and if you haven't read the manga, it's totally useless.

412
00:28:27,743 --> 00:28:34,560
Scott: it is pretty useless if The only purpose of the OAV is people who have read and enjoy the manga can now see the beginning of it animated.

413
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,464
Scott: That's all it does.

414
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:37,653
Scott: Yeah, there's really no point in watching it at all.

415
00:28:37,894 --> 00:28:39,299
Rym: And in fact, the voices are pretty bad.

416
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:46,260
Scott: Yes, the second thing you have to know about sanctuary is that there are a lot of things out there especially comics called sanctuary.

417
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,471
Scott: I think there's even a Jesus comic called sanctuary.

418
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:50,200
Scott: There is an American Jesus comic.

419
00:28:50,622 --> 00:28:53,518
Scott: That's not what you want that that's really not what you want.

420
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:58,179
Scott: What you want will be a black book with a picture of a guy on it.

421
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,960
Scott: You're probably pointing a gun at you or wearing a white suit or you know looking all badass.

422
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:06,468
Rym: Yeah, these things are big and black.

423
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:10,240
Scott: Yeah, they're bigger than your old than the current manga because they're so old.

424
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,107
Scott: I mean when were the one of these things published?

425
00:29:12,328 --> 00:29:12,810
Scott: freaking.

426
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:18,524
Scott: so the first printing of these things was in 1995. that's pretty crazy when you think about it.

427
00:29:18,544 --> 00:29:21,149
Rym: Yeah back then I had never seen a manga.

428
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:26,755
Scott: Yeah, and Apparently there were printings as late as 2003, you know, what was that?

429
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:28,420
Scott: the seventh printing in 2003?

430
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,471
Rym: Yeah, I mean this thing was wildly popular.

431
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:32,461
Scott: Yeah, the fourth printing was in 99.

432
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:36,398
Scott: So I'm guessing they had a printing a year, you know, maybe they skipped a year or two.

433
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:49,420
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, it doesn't look like other mommy open it up and there's no magical things fighting what it doesn't read right to left Because it was printed before Americans decided they wanted to read manga right to left, but that doesn't matter.

434
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:51,714
Scott: What else about it?

435
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:56,659
Scott: Oh, yes now Sanctuary is written by a man of many names.

436
00:29:57,244 --> 00:29:59,380
Scott: His real name is Yoshiyuki Okamura.

437
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:11,440
Scott: The name that you will see on the cover of sanctuary at least the printings that we have is show Fumi Mura But the name he mostly goes by is but on son, which is the name he gave himself.

438
00:30:12,222 --> 00:30:17,780
Scott: He named himself after Charles Bronson, I know Charles Bronson is a famous guy, but I don't know anything about him.

439
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:19,279
Scott: What do you know about Charles Bronson?

440
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:27,000
Rym: Well Charles Bronson's way of growing in a mustache was imitated by Okamura according to the trivia on Wikipedia.

441
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,040
Scott: Oh really?

442
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:35,280
Rym: But anyway, you might remember this man from such wonderful works as Hokuto no Ken Fist of the North Star.

443
00:30:36,441 --> 00:30:46,596
Scott: Yes, this is the guy who wrote Fist of the North Star the guy who wrote strain Which is pretty similar to sanctuary You know, this guy is written all sorts of good action stuff.

444
00:30:46,696 --> 00:30:47,640
Rym: Fist of the Blue Sky.

445
00:30:48,262 --> 00:30:51,174
Scott: Well, I don't think he actually wrote the Fist of the Blue Sky manga.

446
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:52,559
Scott: He advised on it.

447
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:54,387
Rym: Yeah, well it is listed as one of his works.

448
00:30:54,568 --> 00:30:54,829
Scott: Yes.

449
00:30:55,351 --> 00:31:03,149
Scott: Now the artist for sanctuary is Ryoichi Ikigami who is one of my favorite artists.

450
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:11,083
Scott: now Ryoichi got Ikigami also did the art for strain, which I just mentioned Samurai Crusader and Crying Freeman.

451
00:31:11,684 --> 00:31:15,433
Scott: Crying Freeman as you know was written by Kazuo Koike.

452
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,298
Rym: See it all comes together.

453
00:31:17,318 --> 00:31:18,220
Scott: It all comes together.

454
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:31,686
Scott: This is big chain of these same, you know, Bronson, Kazuo Koike Ikigami and some other guys and they all work together to create this body of manga Which is all the good stuff.

455
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:35,559
Scott: the stuff that we like was all made by these same group of guys.

456
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,308
Scott: Yep Different combination.

457
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:38,978
Rym: There are a lot of different ways to categorize this.

458
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:47,800
Rym: a word You might hear a lot to refer to this kind of manga would be Seinen Which generally means manga targeted to men our age.

459
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:53,560
Rym: It's kind of I mean, there's Jose which I got a hold of some crappy Jose a long time ago and learn what the word meant.

460
00:31:54,444 --> 00:32:03,100
Rym: I guess you could kind of say that shoujo and shounen are Kind of the lesser not really lesser but the younger equivalents of Jose and Seinen.

461
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:07,493
Scott: Yeah, Seinen is the manga that Riven's got like.

462
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:12,740
Rym: yes if it were made in America They would probably call it adult manga or something along those lines.

463
00:32:13,381 --> 00:32:24,928
Scott: Yeah, I mean whereas shounen usually involves like little kids with superpowers fighting Seinen usually involves yakuza and politicians Being awesome and killing and raping.

464
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:37,940
Rym: Well, I mean, let me here's how sanctuary is built in the first volume Sanctuary an Erotically charged saga of political corruption the yakuza underworld and two handsome ruthless men.

465
00:32:38,742 --> 00:32:39,584
Scott: That sounds awesome.

466
00:32:39,845 --> 00:32:42,734
Rym: That is exactly what sanctuary is all about.

467
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,880
Rym: That is exactly what GeekNights is all about.

468
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:54,300
Scott: Yeah, I mean there's a lot of manga out there in this same sort of genre But because of the anime culture United States not too much of this comes over here.

469
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:56,820
Rym: I mean, I guess in anime more than manga.

470
00:32:57,343 --> 00:33:09,557
Rym: I don't know why but it seems like the manga market has been generally run by the generally generic Shoujo type stuff and the very, you know million volumes of fighting whatever manga.

471
00:33:09,577 --> 00:33:15,900
Scott: Yeah I mean, this is the kind of stuff that they tried to bring over when manga was still new in this country.

472
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,366
Scott: I mean 95 people.

473
00:33:17,406 --> 00:33:22,385
Scott: this is over 10 years ago that this stuff was coming over, you know No one cared about flipping or anything.

474
00:33:22,445 --> 00:33:25,997
Scott: and well, it was the awesome stuff and then it didn't sell.

475
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:29,640
Scott: so well back then Because the timing is wrong not because the content was wrong.

476
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,820
Rym: Yeah, we could go into great detail about the anime and manga industry back there.

477
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:39,165
Scott: Yeah, they changed the timing and the content and they thought that the content was so they haven't gone back to the old content Whatever.

478
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:46,540
Rym: Well, there have been a lot of forays back into this territory bit by bit and I think we're gonna see a lot more of this stuff coming over in the next.

479
00:33:46,781 --> 00:33:49,471
Scott: Well dark horse has always been good about bringing over the good stuff.

480
00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:51,740
Scott: I mean, they're bringing over MPD psycho pretty soon.

481
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,310
Rym: Yeah, there's all you know, like the Viz signature series.

482
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:54,732
Scott: Yep.

483
00:33:55,214 --> 00:33:55,535
Scott: All right.

484
00:33:55,736 --> 00:33:56,700
Scott: So what?

485
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,707
Scott: Is sanctuary actually about?

486
00:33:59,068 --> 00:34:06,514
Rym: well the plot the basic plot and once again We are not going to spoil anything because woe betide anyone who spoils this manga for anyone.

487
00:34:06,835 --> 00:34:16,304
Rym: Mm-hmm is about two men One of whom has taken the high road and one of whom has taken the low road and their goal is to change the world And remake Japan.

488
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:19,980
Scott: Yes, one of them is named Hojo.

489
00:34:20,981 --> 00:34:22,306
Rym: He has taken the low road.

490
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,674
Rym: He has decided to join the Yakuza.

491
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:25,717
Rym: join the underworld.

492
00:34:25,757 --> 00:34:26,420
Rym: He's a criminal.

493
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:27,664
Scott: He's not just joining.

494
00:34:27,704 --> 00:34:30,072
Scott: The underworld is gonna take over the underworld.

495
00:34:30,213 --> 00:34:32,420
Scott: He's got to be on top of the bottom.

496
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:36,980
Rym: There is probably one of the best scenes in this entire manga.

497
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,774
Rym: Well, that's hard a heady statement considering how many so many good see it's.

498
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:42,239
Scott: every volume is like five of them.

499
00:34:42,822 --> 00:34:49,775
Rym: It's one of the best scenes in the early part of the manga Where one of the older Yakuza guys flashes back to when Hojo tried to join the Yakuza.

500
00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:50,780
Scott: That's my favorite scene.

501
00:34:51,684 --> 00:34:53,279
Rym: I think I can spoil this one scene.

502
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:58,413
Rym: Okay, just just to express to you how absolutely badass this character and his manga is.

503
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:00,940
Rym: This is a punk kid out of high school.

504
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,587
Rym: He's dropped out of high school and he's come to this Yakuza guy Asking him to join his little gang.

505
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:08,756
Rym: The Yakuza guy is a hardcore criminal.

506
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:09,880
Rym: He looks at this kid and laughs.

507
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,276
Rym: What the hell you think you could just join the Yakuza out of school.

508
00:35:13,317 --> 00:35:14,905
Rym: blah blah blah You're not tough.

509
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:17,520
Rym: and he takes out a knife and puts it on the table.

510
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:22,158
Rym: And he says if you're serious take that knife and stab it through your hand.

511
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:31,420
Rym: now This is all part of a flashback where in the modern time the same Yakuza guy is doing the same thing to some punk kid off the street and the kids scared like.

512
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:33,036
Rym: And he doesn't do it.

513
00:35:33,763 --> 00:35:44,292
Rym: But then he thinks to himself there was only one man whoever and it cuts back to this and Hojo without blinking grabs the knife and stabs it through his hand and into the table.

514
00:35:44,855 --> 00:35:54,956
Scott: and he goes and Seeing no one has ever done that before because you're not really supposed to stab your hand You know, it's just a scary punk kids away from joining the Yakuza, you know, the guy goes.

515
00:35:55,297 --> 00:35:56,100
Scott: doesn't that hurt?

516
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,866
Scott: He's like it hurts like hell.

517
00:35:58,006 --> 00:36:01,640
Rym: He says quote it hurts so much I could cry and he's looking up.

518
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,400
Rym: This is like the signature thing of this manga is no one ever looks right at someone if they're a badass.

519
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:12,599
Rym: They always kind of look down but then their eyes are up and you get a full page spread of this.

520
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:15,703
Scott: It's so badass Ever.

521
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:23,625
Rym: I mean everything is so absolutely dramatic in this manga, but yet it's not cheesily dramatic It's intensely dramatic.

522
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:26,855
Scott: It's like every time one of those full pagers comes along.

523
00:36:27,136 --> 00:36:27,697
Scott: You just like.

524
00:36:27,717 --> 00:36:38,240
Rym: yeah I mean I tend to just blow through manga But sanctuary is one of those few things that gives me pause and when I come to one of those spreads I just kind of admire it for a while.

525
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,880
Scott: Yeah, it's like I tend to rush through just to get to the next one and then it I stop.

526
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:43,086
Scott: It's like a speed.

527
00:36:43,126 --> 00:36:45,759
Scott: It's sort of like this little way for it's like oh my god.

528
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:46,322
Scott: Oh my god Oh my god.

529
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:47,187
Scott: Oh my god.

530
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,179
Scott: Here's comes the climax BAM.

531
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:51,974
Scott: But the thing is I started speeding up again in more.

532
00:36:52,014 --> 00:36:57,480
Rym: in typical manga The climax would be like they beat the guy in the fight or a thing happens.

533
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,731
Rym: But a lot of the climaxes in this aren't a thing happens.

534
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:06,746
Rym: They're like someone decided to do something or Conversation and like.

535
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:13,879
Rym: it's hard to explain without reading it But there'll be a climax an absolutely intense climactic moment where nothing happens.

536
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:18,632
Scott: And but usually it's something nothing physical happens.

537
00:37:18,652 --> 00:37:21,666
Scott: Yes, someone decided something Yes, or like.

538
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:27,108
Scott: there'll be you know some large Physical thing like on the verge of half.

539
00:37:27,348 --> 00:37:29,896
Rym: Oh, I know exactly what you're thinking about

540
00:37:30,036 --> 00:37:47,274
Scott: and you'll be like, oh my god It's like of a bomb is falling towards the ground right and you're like, oh my god Oh my god is a bomb coming towards the ground and instead of having the explosion be the great the great like finishing move It's actually there's not an explosion and that's the finishing move and you go.

541
00:37:47,314 --> 00:37:49,020
Scott: Oh my god, there wasn't an explosion.

542
00:37:49,823 --> 00:37:54,180
Rym: Now I remember first president of Japan did that pretty well in one particular scene.

543
00:37:54,662 --> 00:38:01,938
Scott: Yeah, it's like they give you the explosion of you know Finalizing suspense without having it the explosion in the story.

544
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:13,980
Scott: It would be like if if you were watching a fight in Naruto and then all of a sudden Naruto and whoever he was fighting said, alright, let's let's chill and let's make a little let's just make peace and Duke it out.

545
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,746
Scott: You know, we'll we'll just agree to.

546
00:38:16,108 --> 00:38:17,733
Scott: you know disagree agree to now.

547
00:38:17,774 --> 00:38:21,389
Rym: that might sound lame just oh whatever But you've got to read this manga.

548
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:23,098
Scott: Holy shit, if you can find it.

549
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:30,940
Rym: Well, if you happen to live near us and you're really really nice to us We might be willing to let you read it under supervision.

550
00:38:33,204 --> 00:38:34,478
Rym: This stuff doesn't leave my house.

551
00:38:36,162 --> 00:38:36,844
Rym: This are Eagle.

552
00:38:36,864 --> 00:38:37,787
Rym: Yeah.

553
00:38:37,808 --> 00:38:41,400
Scott: Well Eagle we can get it's not Eagles out of print also, but you can get copies of it.

554
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:44,550
Rym: Yeah, well you especially if you go for the non super volumes.

555
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:56,770
Rym: Yeah sanctuary is pretty difficult to get but anyway You've got this Yakuza guy whose goal is to take over the Yakuza become the dawn of all the Yakuza in Japan And not just that but all of East Asia.

556
00:38:57,331 --> 00:38:58,415
Scott: now, you've got this other guy.

557
00:38:58,455 --> 00:39:02,105
Scott: his friend Asami Asami is a politician.

558
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:03,370
Rym: He stayed in school.

559
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:04,975
Rym: He became a political advisor.

560
00:39:05,035 --> 00:39:11,499
Scott: He works for a member of the diet yep, and his goal is to become the Prime Minister of Japan.

561
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:23,080
Rym: and The funny thing is there's a really really good scene where he has to do something horrible Not horrible like shoot somebody cuz he's not a criminal but you want to spoil him.

562
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,860
Rym: I'm not gonna spoil this okay, but he has to do something pretty horrible in order to get the favor of this senator.

563
00:39:29,162 --> 00:39:36,380
Scott: Well, yeah, basically he's talking to this other D It was much more important than he is like a senior guy and he's just a junior whatnot?

564
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,891
Rym: He's not even on the D. He's just an advisor.

565
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:40,820
Scott: Yeah, and he's trying to move up in the ranks.

566
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:45,857
Scott: So the guy says, you know the senior guy who controls his fate says do this horrible thing.

567
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:50,075
Scott: and he says You know normally you wouldn't do such a thing.

568
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,000
Scott: It's it's so horrible.

569
00:39:51,103 --> 00:39:56,376
Scott: but he says This isn't even close to anything as horrible as anything Hojo has had to do in the Yakuza.

570
00:39:56,677 --> 00:39:58,223
Scott: and he does it without Hesitation.

571
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:00,391
Rym: and then that's an awesome scene.

572
00:40:00,672 --> 00:40:06,819
Rym: then it cuts to Hojo right after that Living it up as the Yakuza awesome dude with wine and women.

573
00:40:10,564 --> 00:40:11,879
Scott: It's quite the hilarity.

574
00:40:12,645 --> 00:40:17,130
Rym: Now you might wonder you know Why would this be considered adult if it's just some Yakuza story?

575
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,294
Rym: I've read Yakuza stories before.

576
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:19,920
Rym: this is just a particularly well-done one.

577
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:26,257
Rym: Aside from the fact that sanctuary pulls no punches and does not like the camera never leaves the action.

578
00:40:26,317 --> 00:40:37,526
Rym: if something happens You see it no matter how horrible it may be but not in the fist of the North Star people exploding way, but in a very realistic and Disturbing because it could be real way.

579
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:52,154
Scott: Yeah, it's like there are lots of scenes of sex or rape or Murder and all sorts of very adult and serious things But they're not portrayed in a perverted way or a pornographic way.

580
00:40:52,174 --> 00:40:53,758
Rym: They're not even in a gratuitous way.

581
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:55,003
Rym: Yeah Mr.

582
00:40:55,023 --> 00:41:03,900
Scott: Tokai, okay, they don't put extra blood and guts in there to make you go Oh, and they don't put you know extra hot women's to make you get off or anything like that.

583
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,992
Rym: It's that was an interesting way of putting that.

584
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:09,026
Scott: Yeah, it's just Normal, it's like wow.

585
00:41:09,126 --> 00:41:11,514
Scott: Yeah, that's what they would look like if they did it.

586
00:41:11,614 --> 00:41:13,380
Scott: That's what it would look like if that guy got shot.

587
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:21,880
Rym: That's what would happen if you smash you guys face in with a glass bottle and then beat him Yeah, and Yakuza smash people with glass bottles and beat them.

588
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:28,160
Scott: It's not any sort of you know, like extreme unnecessary violence with chainsaws or anything silly like that.

589
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:42,889
Rym: Yeah, there's perhaps only one gratuitous thing in the entire manga and it's almost a running gag but yet on the grander scale when you read the manga you kind of realize near the end that it really isn't and you realize What that character was actually all about and then it's almost touching.

590
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:49,329
Rym: However, I say almost because he's still raping people God, there's just one character.

591
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:49,389
Rym: Mr.

592
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:49,912
Rym: Tokai.

593
00:41:49,992 --> 00:41:50,052
Rym: Mr.

594
00:41:50,113 --> 00:41:55,033
Scott: Tokai Is so awesome now also so horrible.

595
00:41:55,093 --> 00:41:56,620
Rym: you will not approve of what he does.

596
00:41:56,901 --> 00:42:06,019
Rym: He is a despicable horrible person and yet at the same time It's almost funny the way he leads his life and I really don't want to ruin it.

597
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:15,020
Scott: Anyone that can make me like any manga in which there's a horrible rapist that I pretty much recognize as a bad guy.

598
00:42:15,484 --> 00:42:16,896
Scott: Yet I'm on his side.

599
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:19,547
Scott: You got they got to be doing some magic there.

600
00:42:19,768 --> 00:42:23,560
Rym: see this is a manga where you're on the good guys's side the whole time.

601
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,899
Rym: There's well, I guess relatively the good guys.

602
00:42:26,381 --> 00:42:36,995
Rym: There is never a doubt in your mind that they are right and you're with them a hundred percent and yet at the same time You feel for everyone they're up against because every time they're up against someone.

603
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:40,105
Rym: They're not just some faceless villain They're not just some stupid.

604
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,900
Rym: I would rule the world or I will stop these people for no good reason.

605
00:42:44,622 --> 00:42:49,420
Rym: They all have very good reasons for what they're doing well at least very justifiable reasons for what they're doing.

606
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:53,754
Scott: That's one thing that a lot of these manga by all these guys have in common.

607
00:42:53,794 --> 00:43:02,962
Scott: that is really beginning to bother me and a Lot of other media maybe because I've been spoiled by reading things like sanctuary, you know It is really made apparent to me when I recently Watch.

608
00:43:03,002 --> 00:43:07,461
Scott: I went to my parents house and there was happened to be this old movie on TV a great movie called M It's.

609
00:43:07,562 --> 00:43:09,920
Scott: it's a very old awesome movie by Fritz Lang.

610
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:15,016
Scott: But the one thing wrong with the movie is that it was like, why don't you do this?

611
00:43:15,437 --> 00:43:16,300
Scott: Why don't you do that?

612
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,005
Scott: It's like people didn't do the smartest thing They possibly could.

613
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:22,540
Scott: the same thing happened to me when I was playing Resident Evil 4.

614
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,259
Scott: I was like, why didn't you just shoot the guy right there?

615
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:29,491
Scott: You you know, where was that helicopter hours ago?

616
00:43:29,772 --> 00:43:32,720
Scott: You know, this is really no one is doing the smart thing.

617
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,329
Rym: Yeah, I mean forget the president's daughter.

618
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:36,280
Rym: You just nuke this place from orbit.

619
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,109
Scott: Exactly, you know people were not making smart decisions.

620
00:43:40,189 --> 00:43:47,659
Scott: people were not acting in their own best interest or in the very lot of things People did and that were totally did not make sense at all.

621
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:53,698
Rym: Yeah, I mean if you're watching a character that's dumber than you and you figure something out that they could have done better That's one thing.

622
00:43:54,202 --> 00:43:58,920
Rym: But if the character is portrayed as smart and then they just do a stupid thing because that's the only way the plots gonna work.

623
00:43:59,602 --> 00:44:00,406
Rym: I can't deal with that.

624
00:44:00,426 --> 00:44:03,217
Scott: Yeah, I think another manga that recently that gets this right is Death Note.

625
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:09,420
Scott: Yes Where every character who is smart there aren't really any stupid people, you know.

626
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,380
Scott: And if they are stupid they pretty much their stupidity is exposed immediately and they just die.

627
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,745
Scott: They're probably they're probably a henchman.

628
00:44:14,765 --> 00:44:18,900
Rym: Yeah, actually if you like Death Note, I think you'll really like sanctuary because it's the same deal.

629
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:24,800
Rym: There's a lot of talking a lot of planning ahead a lot of very smart people at odds.

630
00:44:25,021 --> 00:44:30,420
Scott: Yeah, and you have all these really smart badass people and they just get more smarter more smarter.

631
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,750
Scott: They just get smarter and more badass as the manga goes along.

632
00:44:34,232 --> 00:44:34,533
Scott: and they're.

633
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:50,636
Scott: some of them are in conflict and some of them are you know in cooperation and all of them do the smartest thing and the best thing they possibly can at any one moment to achieve their goals and Repeat repeat repeat repeat and the excitement is all about seeing how it goes down

634
00:44:51,017 --> 00:44:51,640
Rym: even better.

635
00:44:52,101 --> 00:45:01,189
Rym: And I love this so much about this manga is that not only do they always do the smart thing but many times Characters did something I didn't even think of.

636
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:02,112
Rym: they outsmarted me.

637
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:02,734
Rym: Yeah.

638
00:45:02,895 --> 00:45:04,320
Scott: I mean, that's why I like it so much.

639
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,544
Scott: Is that I'm so outsmarted.

640
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:07,149
Scott: It's like what's he gonna do now?

641
00:45:07,169 --> 00:45:14,154
Rym: Oh shit, and it's not like oh shit Kamehameha, man, man, man, the super double attack.

642
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:18,310
Rym: It's like oh shit He just put a bunch of Yakuza on a boat and sent him there.

643
00:45:18,832 --> 00:45:23,610
Scott: There's one part in the manga where You don't know which part I'm gonna say.

644
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,180
Rym: I think I know what part you're gonna say.

645
00:45:25,481 --> 00:45:29,774
Scott: Well, there's one part cuz it does deal a lot with politics in addition to the Yakuza.

646
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:33,140
Scott: and there's one part where this lady beset Who's some American?

647
00:45:34,181 --> 00:45:37,340
Scott: She's some American like foreign policy lady or something?

648
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:45,378
Scott: I forget exactly what she is and she comes over and she's pissed that Japan won't let America sell American cars in Japan.

649
00:45:45,398 --> 00:45:49,379
Scott: and She gets dealt with in a way.

650
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:57,431
Scott: Yes I don't want to spoil how she's dealt with but Almost everyone gets dealt with.

651
00:45:57,773 --> 00:46:05,397
Rym: but then the other thing is People lose and people win and while everyone's smart someone still has to win and characters die.

652
00:46:05,457 --> 00:46:06,660
Rym: people die all the time.

653
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,041
Rym: It's as realistic I mean.

654
00:46:09,182 --> 00:46:17,408
Rym: if this world were realistic a world where Yakuza are like this and politicians are like this Then the events here are effectively a documentary.

655
00:46:17,729 --> 00:46:22,420
Scott: Yeah, I mean the other thing is not everything always turns out in a predictable way.

656
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,103
Scott: It's like okay.

657
00:46:23,223 --> 00:46:25,875
Scott: There's a Yakuza boss and he's infringing on some territory.

658
00:46:25,895 --> 00:46:27,100
Scott: I'm just making shit up right now.

659
00:46:27,281 --> 00:46:28,326
Scott: I don't remember this in the manga.

660
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:35,340
Scott: Yeah, and you know normally would and aha He killed the other Yakuza boss and took his territory killed the other Yakuza boss took his turn.

661
00:46:35,363 --> 00:46:36,825
Scott: well sometimes that are.

662
00:46:36,845 --> 00:46:47,792
Scott: the Yakuza boss makes an alliance and sometimes the you know The other politician decides to go along with it and maybe sometimes the guy decides to go along with it But he's secretly against it.

663
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:56,760
Scott: any you know Agrees to an alliance and then does some evil or maybe the guy acts like he's against it But he's really for it, and they keep surprising you left and right.

664
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:07,260
Scott: But it always makes sense and whenever anyone does something out of the ordinary or unexpected It's always explained and the motivation always works and the decision always works.

665
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,999
Rym: There's never a point where you think why did that character do that?

666
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:12,528
Rym: Yeah, or you think why did he do that?

667
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:15,138
Rym: and then you realize oh because he's smarter than I am.

668
00:47:15,158 --> 00:47:18,912
Scott: yep What else is there to say about sanctuary besides how awesome it is?

669
00:47:19,073 --> 00:47:20,920
Rym: yeah like in terms of the understated climax.

670
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:27,600
Rym: I was just flipping through the second volume again And there's a really important scene where this politician comes home to his house.

671
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:43,520
Rym: He sees his wife and blah blah blah And then he walks into the dining room after his wife said there's a guest and there's a two-page spread Which they usually reserved for like huge huge huge moments and all it is is Hojo and his assistant Sitting very quietly at a day on a dining table.

672
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:48,660
Scott: Well because what that what that two-page spread is really saying is hey you have a guest.

673
00:47:49,081 --> 00:47:51,610
Scott: I wonder who my guest is the Yakuza boss.

674
00:47:51,951 --> 00:48:01,228
Rym: not only that but this Yakuza boss is here Not as any gesture of goodwill, but to show me that he could come and do anything He wanted to my family if I crossed him.

675
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:01,709
Scott: Yes.

676
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,954
Scott: He knows where I live.

677
00:48:03,235 --> 00:48:04,239
Scott: He knows who I am.

678
00:48:04,642 --> 00:48:11,750
Scott: He knows everything about me in my in my house Already kills my wife and my family drinking my juice.

679
00:48:12,111 --> 00:48:12,411
Scott: Yep.

680
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:14,677
Scott: He's in your base right now.

681
00:48:14,697 --> 00:48:18,286
Scott: He's saying hello And you're still alive.

682
00:48:18,848 --> 00:48:22,240
Rym: and of course not to this won't ruin anything by saying names.

683
00:48:22,321 --> 00:48:33,739
Rym: But if you read this manga and get a hold of it Isao is a name that you will know very well and Ichijima is a name that will be dear to your heart for the rest of your life.

684
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,855
Scott: Ichijima is perhaps the best character in there except for Hojo who's just awesome.

685
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:47,358
Rym: Yeah, not to discount Tokai or the police chief who is as awesome as you call the police chief for the police woman both of them.

686
00:48:47,498 --> 00:48:49,605
Rym: Yeah Pretty much every character.

687
00:48:49,946 --> 00:48:51,291
Rym: Yeah, except this guy.

688
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:52,314
Rym: I'm looking at right now.

689
00:48:52,354 --> 00:48:53,097
Rym: We just got killed.

690
00:48:53,618 --> 00:48:55,583
Scott: Oh and Toshiro.

691
00:48:56,277 --> 00:49:04,545
Rym: Oh Toshiro is my favorite character just for the fact that there's one scene early on where he he joined the Yakuza and He's a young guy.

692
00:49:04,585 --> 00:49:06,573
Rym: He has a young beautiful wife and he has a kid.

693
00:49:07,115 --> 00:49:10,040
Rym: and one day Hojo just asks him Why do you want this life?

694
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,368
Rym: What do you want for your kids?

695
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:13,199
Rym: and he looks out the window and there's all these?

696
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:20,379
Rym: Businessmen normal businessmen walking through the streets and he basically says I want him to live a life unlike them.

697
00:49:21,664 --> 00:49:22,590
Rym: Their eyes are dead.

698
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,040
Rym: They've got one foot in the grave.

699
00:49:24,441 --> 00:49:25,825
Rym: How could anyone become that way?

700
00:49:26,086 --> 00:49:31,120
Rym: and there's this beautiful conversation that encapsulates everything that I think is awesome about anything ever.

701
00:49:31,986 --> 00:49:37,540
Scott: You know that line in Snow crash that's like every 20 year old guy wants to be a badass.

702
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:46,219
Scott: If only he could go to a monastery and you know study kung-fu and become a badass If only something he could become the you know, the biggest badass in the whole world.

703
00:49:46,761 --> 00:49:51,396
Scott: Reading sanctuary for 20 something year old guys is the realization of that fantasy.

704
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,948
Scott: Yeah That's what it is.

705
00:49:53,968 --> 00:49:58,148
Scott: It's like look at these guys They're the badasses.

706
00:49:58,168 --> 00:50:06,020
Rym: and he's reading about badasses and you go Even worse despite the fact that you know The Yakuza aren't really like this and you know that politics doesn't work like this.

707
00:50:06,522 --> 00:50:14,108
Rym: When you listen to listen to when you read these speeches that these characters give and the things that happen You think for every now and then for a second?

708
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:15,973
Rym: Why don't we just do that?

709
00:50:16,455 --> 00:50:18,280
Rym: Why doesn't someone just do that?

710
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:20,118
Rym: That's the way the world should be.

711
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:38,810
Scott: Well, I think a lot of the moral of sanctuary that appeals so much to us young kids is like, you know something they say very often throughout the manga is like, you know, 99% of you know, everyone in the diet is over the age of 50 something something They're all a bunch of old geezers run in the country blah blah blah.

712
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:41,800
Rym: They hold power only so that they can continue to hold power.

713
00:50:42,321 --> 00:50:43,846
Scott: Yeah, it's like we're young people.

714
00:50:43,867 --> 00:50:45,351
Scott: We want to change something.

715
00:50:45,693 --> 00:50:47,298
Scott: Here's all our awesomeness, etc, etc.

716
00:50:48,723 --> 00:50:56,319
Scott: You know and that stuff that anyone who's 20 something years old or even teenager can get way behind In like yeah, fuck those old people.

717
00:50:57,562 --> 00:51:01,120
Rym: But there's a lot more to it than that and we really can't say more without ruining this.

718
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,727
Rym: I don't want to ruin a. there a lot of.

719
00:51:02,747 --> 00:51:05,719
Scott: there are a lot of morals of the story that come in at the end.

720
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:14,492
Rym: Yeah, and and we say morals because I guess like eska flown a is a good example of an anime That is this there is not just one moral or one theme.

721
00:51:14,794 --> 00:51:16,340
Rym: This manga is about a lot.

722
00:51:17,002 --> 00:51:27,929
Scott: Yeah, it's like each volume is like each segment of the story comes around you'll learn something new or they'll try to tell you something new and then at the end There is an ending at the end that ties everything together.

723
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:29,514
Rym: a very well executed one.

724
00:51:29,574 --> 00:51:36,350
Scott: I might add an unexpected one alright, so Sanctuary is one of our favorite manga ever.

725
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:43,780
Scott: if you are a human being who enjoys reading manga You probably should read it if you can get a copy of it, which is not easy.

726
00:51:44,122 --> 00:51:46,918

731
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:05,260

732
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,891

00:52:08,951 --> 00:52:14,954

00:52:15,236 --> 00:52:16,120
Scott: It's just kind of different.

735
00:52:16,581 --> 00:52:21,715
Scott: It's the story about a guy in like Southeast Asia doing some stuff.

736
00:52:21,796 --> 00:52:26,811
Scott: I'm not gonna talk about it much now But yeah, there's a lot of manga like this and they're all awesome.
