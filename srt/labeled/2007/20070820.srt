1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,228
Scott: It's Monday August 20th.

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,232
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,500
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:19,719
Scott: Tonight we discuss why streaming audio is not what it used to be.

5
00:00:24,352 --> 00:00:25,387
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:36,839
Rym: You know after all the harping we did the visigoths came this weekend and aside from a little bit of mess in the kitchen They didn't really destroy the house.

7
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:37,782
Scott: I think that's cuz.

8
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:44,100
Scott: we harped on them incredibly to not visigoth and they visigoth much less than previous times.

9
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:47,120
Scott: I would say they were not visigoths, but perhaps some other type of God.

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,090
Rym: Well, the thing is I'm really proud of him because nothing was broken.

11
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,040
Scott: This is the first time nothing was broken that we know of.

12
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,540
Rym: I have yet to find anything broken.

13
00:00:55,741 --> 00:01:01,679
Rym: It is so far the first time we have ever had a Dungeons & Dragons weekend in our house where something of ours did not Get broken.

14
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:05,483
Scott: Awesome, but yeah It would.

15
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:08,600
Scott: it wasn't perfect though, so we can still do better next time guys.

16
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:09,222
Scott: Yeah,

17
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:30,955
Rym: it was a good old weekend at D&D in and rock climbing and all that even though I gotta say it's kind of funny that we're a group of people where we'll play D&D for like six hours and Then the end of the session will basically be an hour-long arguing match about the nature of role-playing which ended up being The entire front row crew pretty much screaming at Scott and him yelling back at us.

18
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,160
Scott: Yeah, what do you want from me?

19
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:33,909
Rym: It was all in good fun.

20
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:38,110
Scott: Yeah Arguments probably just as fun as D&D game anyway.

21
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:38,733
Rym: Yeah.

22
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:39,517
Scott: Yeah.

23
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:40,260
Scott: All right.

24
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,188
Scott: So you're just moved to tech news or what?

25
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:45,858
Scott: I mean, I'm so kind of bled.

26
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:49,879
Rym: I don't know Why why you like this a lot on Mondays and Tuesdays and Wednesdays?

27
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,480
Rym: Every day no, no, no, we sit down to do the show and then you're like, yeah, I don't care about it.

28
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,970
Scott: It's been feeling kind of blessed since last Thursday.

29
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:58,633
Scott: I don't know why.

30
00:01:58,813 --> 00:01:59,818
Rym: I don't know you're bored.

31
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:00,380
Rym: Are you sick?

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,460
Scott: Are you tired when all the above?

33
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,865
Rym: Why we got plenty of sleep?

34
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:07,934
Rym: yeah kinda yeah sorta.

35
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:09,056
Rym: what have you been doing in there?

36
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:10,060
Scott: I don't know.

37
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,029
Scott: All right.

38
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:15,303
Rym: So all right captain What's your news then?

39
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:20,899
Scott: So last see August 16th, I think so that was Thursday and August 16th.

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,874
Scott: Skype Screwed up like whoa, it's it's not working for almost anybody.

41
00:02:27,934 --> 00:02:32,673
Rym: You've noticed we haven't done many interviews lately So I haven't even had a Skype box ready as I didn't even notice.

42
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:41,066
Scott: I didn't notice either cuz I've stopped logging into Skype on a regular basis and I only log into it now and I'm actually gonna use it so sort of like.

43
00:02:41,648 --> 00:02:53,684
Scott: I didn't know it was down other than the stories on the internet and podcasts who use Skype exclusively complaining they couldn't record over the weekend and Originally people were like, oh Skype is down.

44
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:54,206
Scott: Oh shits.

45
00:02:54,427 --> 00:02:57,360
Scott: then people said Russian hackers took down Skype.

46
00:02:58,102 --> 00:03:03,196
Rym: Did people say that or did dig say that there's a big difference between people and dig?

47
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:15,976
Rym: dig people like I said, there's a big difference between people and and now Apparently, I mean if guy if dig represents people that Ron Paul is like the dictator of the world.

48
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:16,076
Scott: Yeah.

49
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:18,026
Scott: All right, so Skype.

50
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:28,156
Scott: the company says as of like today That the reason that Skype went down is because of Microsoft's patch Tuesday.

51
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:36,380
Scott: now if you don't know Alright every on the second Tuesday of every month is black Tuesday because that's when all the windows updates come out.

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:04:02,353
Scott: So if you can find a bug or a security hole in Microsoft Windows or office or anything Unlike the second Wednesday of the month immediately after black Tuesday You're gonna be able to use that exploit and so is everyone else for an entire month Unless it's some crazy super insane exploit that's ruining the internet in which case Microsoft might work faster than a month but most likely it's gonna take a month for them to get around to fixing it.

53
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:15,649
Rym: the side effect of all this is that partly because of the security problems they keep cropping up and partly because they get released on one day and partly because a lot of IT departments Really don't understand how to actually update machines.

54
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:27,080
Rym: So they'll just let all their windows boxes automatically get these updates on Tuesday and Microsoft is not known for thoroughly testing what its updates might do to people's windows box.

55
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:42,065
Scott: so the alternative to doing the Tuesday thing is to manually go and get every individual hotfix for every Individual bug from the MSDN and that unless you're a system administrator for some giant network, and that's your only job You're not gonna do that.

56
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:43,068
Scott: That's just not gonna happen.

57
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,831
Scott: Nor should it.

58
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,980
Rym: Well, there are a bunch of ways you can do it.

59
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:52,369
Rym: I mean the real problem is a lot of these patches are not super tested or not exactly like.

60
00:04:52,610 --> 00:05:09,260
Rym: they'll often fix a problem and cause another problem and 99% of these problems are not going to cause any issue for anyone Unless you happen to be using X processor and you happen to be using Y program and Z program at the same time And you happen to be a werewolf and happens to be a full moon.

61
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:10,918
Scott: All right Now wait check this you ready.

62
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:21,739
Scott: Skype doesn't say as you would think as soon as you hear Oh patch Tuesday's killed Skype you would think oh, well Obviously something in the patches made Skype not work.

63
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:23,504
Scott: All right The software would crash.

64
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:25,029
Rym: because well, wait a minute.

65
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,458
Rym: if Skype wasn't working in Windows because of patch Tuesday What about all the Linux people in the Mac people?

66
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:31,966
Rym: Working for them.

67
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:33,840
Scott: No wasn't huh?

68
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:43,540
Scott: No, wait, so and also if it was a problem on patch Tuesday, right with those patches How come Skype didn't stop working until Thursday or Friday?

69
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,170
Rym: Well, a lot of that people don't often get the updates right away at home.

70
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:53,376
Scott: because apparently what happened is because you know Skype No one's actually a hunt other than the people who make Skype.

71
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:54,240
Scott: It's closed source.

72
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:59,034
Scott: We're not a hundred percent sure exactly how it works like a hundred percent.

73
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:01,762
Rym: the rationale for this is pretty straightforward Actually one.

74
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:10,620
Rym: they wanted to be proprietary because Skype actually wants to make money off all that crap and to they make it kind of Secret in a because they've set it up to where.

75
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:17,659
Rym: Often it'll just make it through firewalls and it'll just kind of get out to the internet and a lot of things like net.

76
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,983
Rym: Just don't stop it.

77
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:24,640
Rym: and the way to do that is to do some somewhat shady or strange things.

78
00:06:25,103 --> 00:06:27,100
Scott: I don't think that's the motivation for keeping it secret.

79
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,899
Scott: I think the motivation for keeping a secret is keeping people from getting free phone calls.

80
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:37,880
Rym: Yeah, but basically all that stuff can be solved with their server things which mediate all the conversations.

81
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:42,326
Scott: But Skype says according to Skype I don't know how much I believe this right.

82
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:44,555
Scott: is that because Skype is so peer-to-peer?

83
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:45,700
Scott: because it is it's peer-to-peer?

84
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:54,339
Scott: Yeah, when you Skype you're not only you know Not only are you skyping to the people that you're skyping to but it's sort of also skyping to some other people's.

85
00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:01,100
Scott: you know It kind of uses people's computers in a way to help the Skype network grow and make sure your packets get there on time.

86
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:02,178
Scott: And all that jazz, right?

87
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:12,560
Scott: not only is Skype peer-to-peer, but What happened on patch Tuesday is everyone had to reboot their computers?

88
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:23,385
Scott: Because they got patches from Microsoft and thus all these Skype clients that were just sitting online went offline and some of them didn't start up again.

89
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:33,914
Scott: and some of them did some of them didn't and as There were less and less people on the Skype network But more and more of those people were using it.

90
00:07:34,356 --> 00:07:35,380
Scott: It sort of broke down.

91
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:45,640
Scott: so basically what they're telling us is that There need to be people signed into Skype and not using Skype in order for other people using Skype to make calls.

92
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:50,700
Rym: Well, if that's the case then fuck Skype, I'm not gonna leave the Skype client open talking my bandwidth.

93
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:51,340
Rym: Yeah

94
00:07:51,902 --> 00:08:04,800
Scott: But so when a bunch of people sign off a Skype and then a bunch of people sign back in suddenly when you know the automatic starts up That sort of did a little denial of service on their server of all these people trying to log in at once

95
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,300
Rym: I'm still dubious of that because patch Tuesdays happen often and this is the first time this has happened

96
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:11,189
Scott: I know but that's what they say.

97
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,094
Rym: I call bullshit.

98
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:13,380
Scott: I also call bullshit.

99
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,276
Rym: I call bullshit on Skype and I call bullshit on Russian hackers.

100
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:21,776
Scott: Yep Skype is totally making up something here and it doesn't.

101
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,100
Scott: it doesn't smell like roses.

102
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:32,740
Rym: I mean theoretically it could be possible for a Windows update to cause a problem Whereby Windows machines would send data to the Skype servers in a way that caused a problem.

103
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:48,115
Rym: But the odds of that are pretty damn low and someone would have noticed Mm-hmm, because if honestly if I couldn't get Skype to work and I needed it I'd open up the ethereal and start looking at packet or the wire shark and I'd start poking around at it and looking at my Firewall logs and my nets and everything and

104
00:08:48,638 --> 00:08:50,043
Scott: yeah Basically, they.

105
00:08:50,144 --> 00:08:55,359
Scott: the only other thing they say is that the issue has been identified within Skype and I guess they fixed it.

106
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:57,450
Rym: maybe Yeah, whatever.

107
00:08:57,471 --> 00:09:05,803
Rym: Yeah It is my opinion that Skype just screwed up and they're trying to cover up for it by blaming the big old bad Microsoft.

108
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:10,180
Rym: and not that I love Microsoft but a lot of people blame them for a lot of things that you really.

109
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:15,528
Scott: It's not always their fault Yeah, but so Skype it had a problem in it.

110
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:19,620
Scott: It went down a little cover-up action and it's back up now.

111
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:20,685
Scott: What you gonna do?

112
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:22,756
Scott: There's no real alternative.

113
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:23,259
Scott: so much

114
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:43,659
Rym: So as you all know I used to work at IBM and one thing that was kind of cool about IBM is that there was a lot of community service and Things that we could do in the company that weren't our job But yet we could do them on company time and be paid just as much for them and a lot of it was like donations and charity work and community service stuff.

115
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:50,659
Rym: and There was an article on dig today about one of these things and I remembered it because I've actually done this a couple times And it was kind of cool.

116
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,200
Rym: So I want to talk about it a little bit because it brings up a lot of issues.

117
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,406
Rym: But IBM has this program called excite Exploring interest in tech site

118
00:09:58,426 --> 00:09:59,430
Scott: like the website and

119
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,159
Rym: engineering like ex dot I dot T dot E

120
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:03,283
Scott: Okay,

121
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:27,229
Rym: and what it is is they get schools like schools for young kids not super young kids, but you know Like adolescent kids girls only to get the day off of school or the week off of school Come to whatever IBM site is near their school and have female engineers and female Scientists and female computer technicians and male ones who just know about stuff and also because there aren't that many women in Engineering anyway, maybe

122
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:28,699
Scott: that's why they're doing something like this.

123
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:30,585
Rym: well that is exactly why they're doing it.

124
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:41,609
Rym: but basically we'd set up science experiments and fun stuff and Try to come up with ways to get these kids to basically show kids like this that you know What physics is actually kind of cool.

125
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,354
Rym: check it out liquid nitrogen.

126
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:45,180
Rym: check it out exploding sodium.

127
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:47,331
Rym: Check it out pine box derby cars.

128
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:48,939
Scott: Oh, yeah pine box derby cars.

129
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:52,407
Rym: and Some people argue on the internet.

130
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:54,755
Rym: There's the flame war happens every time there's stuff like this.

131
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:56,100
Rym: that oh, it's sexist.

132
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:57,920
Rym: But I'm actually the opposite mind.

133
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:10,939
Rym: I think that programs like this in general not just the ones that are we have to get women into the sciences But just the trying to get any kid interested in anything that is in any way productive Especially when they're young is a good thing.

134
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:15,960
Scott: Well, I think that generally we have this problem where obviously look at the statistics, right?

135
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:19,611
Scott: There are less girls interested in science now than the guys.

136
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:19,972
Scott: that's just.

137
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:21,136
Scott: that's how it is now.

138
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:22,220
Rym: it's always been that way.

139
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:29,627
Scott: Well, no You look at like the early days like computer science to go to like those old univac computer labs and there are a lot more Ladies there percentage-wise.

140
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:32,139
Rym: Um, there are now, you know the reason for that, right?

141
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:51,254
Rym: It basically came down to the fact that most of the telco switching operator type people who ended up working with early computers happened to be women because that was a job that women did and Most of the other people who ended up working with computers early on were Secretaries and all the people who generally were women who did that kind of work and

142
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:56,270
Scott: I mean there were a lot of women Programmer computer scientists early on because

143
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,799
Rym: they got into that but there were a lot more men.

144
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:02,411
Scott: Anyway, the point is that we don't know why.

145
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:06,405
Scott: it could be some sort of genetic thing It could be a biology thing.

146
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,651
Scott: It could be a psychology thing.

147
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:09,560
Scott: It could be an environmental thing.

148
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:13,479
Rym: Mine that is pretty much entirely societal that's my guess.

149
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:18,458
Scott: It looks like a lot societal to me because other countries don't have this problem as much as we do like.

150
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:19,000
Scott: look at India.

151
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,235
Scott: You got just as many women doing the computer thing as the guy is the guys.

152
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,104
Rym: Yeah, and also to be honest I mean I've worked.

153
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:27,140
Rym: the women in the tech fields are just as confident as the men.

154
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:28,979
Rym: It's not like it's any different at all.

155
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,264
Scott: Yeah I had a lot.

156
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:36,640
Scott: actually a lot of my CS teachers in college were female and Didn't really think anything of it and they knew more than I did.

157
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,429
Scott: This way they were the teacher and I was paying.

158
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:40,700
Rym: but there's a much greater thing than this.

159
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:41,740
Rym: I want to mention that one.

160
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:47,875
Rym: Just you gotta get kids interested in science at all because kids generally these days aren't interested in these people.

161
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:49,660
Scott: people aren't interested in size?

162
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,740
Rym: Well, yeah, but I don't know how because it's really cool and I maybe I mean maybe kids who don't get like.

163
00:12:57,081 --> 00:13:07,380
Rym: Oh books are crap and they don't want to read them and they don't want to be at school book Read a book read a book They don't think about the fact that you know, what black holes and all that business are kind of cool and scary.

164
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,650
Rym: Wouldn't you like to know more about black holes and space stuff?

165
00:13:11,473 --> 00:13:12,416
Rym: I know her science.

166
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:13,359
Rym: or blowing things up.

167
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:20,600
Scott: or When I was a kid, we used to go to Science Museum like every year with school and Science Museum is always cool.

168
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:29,072
Rym: Science museums were like the best things ever when I was a kid even though all the exhibits like a zillion of them everywhere Every exhibit you could touch was always broken because kids just destroy.

169
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:33,788
Scott: only some of them were broken at the good science museums The fancy big ones the the stuff wasn't broken.

170
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:35,635
Rym: Well, I went to the Detroit Science Museum.

171
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,623
Rym: while it's big and fancy Things got broken.

172
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:42,735
Scott: often good science museums equal the Boston Science Museum high quality.

173
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:48,193
Rym: the Natural History Museum Oh the National History Museum is the only reason and they go there anymore.

174
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:49,940
Scott: Liberty Science Center high quality.

175
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,422
Rym: I've been.

176
00:13:50,502 --> 00:13:53,653
Rym: I've spent many hours in that museum and I've looked at most things.

177
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:55,520
Scott: They've got it Liberty Science Center.

178
00:13:55,821 --> 00:13:57,127
Scott: I heard from one of our listeners.

179
00:13:57,207 --> 00:14:03,408
Scott: actually it just reopened like I went to it when I was younger and I guess it closed which I didn't realize.

180
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:08,246
Scott: and I guess it just reopened which I didn't even realize was closed and You should go there.

181
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,180
Scott: You can actually see the Statue of Liberty from it.

182
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:22,280
Rym: It's in New Jersey and it's a really cool science museum of awesome, but on a broader scale It seems like there are some companies like and what I'm talking about mega corpse like the big iron companies.

183
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:37,440
Rym: it seems like a lot of the very large tech companies end up doing a lot of community service and a lot of Projects that aren't going to make money for the company But they're gonna do some good somewhere and a lot of outreach and I don't see that in a lot of other industries.

184
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,339
Scott: Oh, how many other industries have you worked for?

185
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,563
Rym: just read and think.

186
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:54,718
Rym: like I read I look around the internet and I see like there's always the press release of this company's doing This and this company's doing this and maybe just because the tech companies are more hip to the internet So they have better internet PR and there's more press about the things they do.

187
00:14:55,781 --> 00:15:02,332
Scott: Probably is it because if you look around Basically all big companies have sort of been sold on?

188
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:04,660
Scott: this idea may be true to some point.

189
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:12,905
Scott: I don't think it's entirely false that you have to sort of do all these goodwill charity sorts of things to get better public Opinion of your company.

190
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:15,720
Scott: so big companies doing that stuff all over the place.

191
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,746
Rym: But it's only like the super.

192
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:22,100
Rym: I mean little companies do a lot of local stuff and super big companies do a lot of stuff.

193
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:29,202
Rym: And I really like it because it wasn't just oh they're doing good for the community From a purely just money-grubbing Standpoint.

194
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:32,673
Rym: it really improved the morale at IBM when we did stuff like this.

195
00:15:32,954 --> 00:15:41,340
Scott: the fact that I guys you get to do something It's not work Yeah, but the game is doing anything that wasn't work during work time and morale would have been improved just as much.

196
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,819
Rym: But I I feel like if companies if they do this I mean if they just let me go home morale would go up.

197
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:49,878
Rym: but if they let me do this morale goes up just as much.

198
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:52,507
Rym: and They still get my Google.

199
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,174
Scott: lets you do whatever you want 20% of the time.

200
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:56,704
Rym: Yeah Though I got to say.

201
00:15:56,986 --> 00:16:05,614
Rym: by the same token my current company, which is not as big as IBM I mean, it's still like a big enterprise, you know IT whatever but it's not nearly as big as IBM.

202
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:12,610
Rym: the idea the sheer I Possibility of me being paid for a minute of work.

203
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:15,840
Rym: That is not a billable hour that is going to generate revenue.

204
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,771
Rym: It's not even laughable.

205
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:24,667
Rym: like they can't comprehend that Yeah, what they do every year is hey Donate a bunch of your check to charities.

206
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,071
Rym: Here's the form to fill out.

207
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:28,479
Rym: Yeah IBM is like this.

208
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:32,640
Rym: Friday We're all gonna go to inner-city schools and teach kids about science.

209
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,934
Scott: Well, cuz I the thing is is you know, IBM just has so much money.

210
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:40,794
Rym: Yeah, whatever I almost feel like we should get back to I don't know.

211
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:42,200
Rym: It's a really complicated idea.

212
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,340
Scott: I think it's like it does feel when companies do do that sort of thing.

213
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,820
Scott: I see the value and improve improving employee morale and the value in improving public opinion of the company.

214
00:16:52,322 --> 00:16:55,840
Scott: But it feels kind of like your company does something bad.

215
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:59,640
Scott: So you're doing something good separate from what you normally do to cover up for it.

216
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,820
Scott: What would be better is if the thing your company did?

217
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:04,907
Scott: It's your main thing.

218
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:05,832
Scott: your company did like.

219
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:20,570
Scott: if you're a company that makes shoes Let's say if the making of shoes itself was a good thing and was awesome And you didn't have to do other good things on the side if your main goal of your company was good and awesome You wouldn't have to separately do other charity.

220
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,760
Rym: It's hard to say what the main idea is.

221
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,148
Rym: I mean, what's IBM doing?

222
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,940
Rym: They're making technology and selling it to people.

223
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:32,098
Scott: That's that's actually the topic of Douglas rush coughs latest book that companies don't know what they do anymore.

224
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:32,840
Scott: They don't do anything.

225
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:37,192
Rym: Uh, the thing is I don't think that's true for IBM.

226
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:39,320
Rym: Just I mean my experience is working there.

227
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:46,060
Rym: It's IBM is like a million tiny companies all stuck together, but all the different parts know exactly what they're doing.

228
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:53,200
Scott: Yeah, but other companies I've worked generally talking about companies that like, you know outsource absolutely everything and then what does the company do?

229
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:04,620
Rym: Well, you know That's really no different than like Scott and I always think hey we should open it to Bella sub shop because we know it'll make a lot of money out here because there's There outside of Manhattan and like the Bronx like actually down in the city.

230
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,333
Rym: There is no good place to get a submarine sandwich down here.

231
00:18:08,373 --> 00:18:10,160
Rym: Not where I live fucking anywhere.

232
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:11,707
Rym: Subway we've looked.

233
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:14,320
Rym: we can drive up the road like 20 subways.

234
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:21,569
Scott: I get a generic boring delis that all have the same Boar's head meat and to be a quiz nose It's just a slightly more expensive subway.

235
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:21,950
Rym: Yep.

236
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,916
Rym: It's not like it's a good subway with a toaster.

237
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:32,580
Rym: Yeah, pretty much I think they give you a little bit more meat, but whatever it still crack It does taste better though, but I don't want to run a subway or about de Bella's or anything.

238
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,567
Rym: I don't want to manage it.

239
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:35,379
Rym: I don't want to have anything to do with it.

240
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:37,105
Rym: So what if I had money?

241
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:46,600
Rym: if I had money to invest I would buy the rights to a subway franchise I'd hire workers and hire a manager to run it and I just take all the profits.

242
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:48,991
Rym: Yeah, that's no different than these companies.

243
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:51,020
Rym: What am I contributing to the world at this point?

244
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,435
Rym: All I contributed was I had a bunch of money in the first place.

245
00:18:54,776 --> 00:18:58,999
Rym: That's all I did Yep, and I get to benefit from that pretty much forever.

246
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:06,336
Rym: Yeah And a lot of companies like Scott saying and well I guess Douglas Rushkoff is saying do the same thing outsource everything and then what do you do?

247
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:07,160
Rym: make money?

248
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,193
Scott: And he says they should concentrate on the thing they do.

249
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:14,331
Scott: if you're a company that makes shoes You should try to make better shoes more efficiently.

250
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:19,240
Scott: if you're a company that makes sandwiches You should try to make better sandwiches more efficiently.

251
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,490
Scott: And if you do that, everything will be awesome.

252
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:33,514
Rym: The thing is don't worry about that other bullshit I gotta say most companies I've worked for when I I like I'll write a full-on business proposal Like if we did this we could save all this money.

253
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:34,920
Scott: and that's what Doug wants you to do.

254
00:19:35,164 --> 00:19:35,900
Rym: And you know what happens?

255
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,240
Rym: I give it to my boss and he says hmm and he gives it to his boss who never looks at it.

256
00:19:39,882 --> 00:19:40,284
Rym: And that's it.

257
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:44,380
Rym: They got they got to read this book, but they don't care because they get paid.

258
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:45,926
Scott: I know that's the problem.

259
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:47,031
Rym: Everyone just gets paid.

260
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:49,140
Rym: All right, I don't know.

261
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:54,279
Rym: I guess I brought this up because I think it's cool and because I did it and I really enjoyed it.

262
00:19:54,903 --> 00:20:00,600
Rym: I almost if if I could make the kind of money I make an IT I'd really like to be just like a high school teacher.

263
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:12,927
Scott: Yeah, high school computer my the best job in the world would be like summer camp director person but the problem is that job not enough with the money and Summer only.

264
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,799
Scott: so yeah, what you gonna do?

265
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:24,998
Rym: But I spent an hour just teaching a group of like 14 to 15 year old girls What it's like to be an IT guy or an IT girl I guess and what you do in IT what my job is like.

266
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:29,876
Rym: granted I lied because I said that the job is rewarding and really fun and you get to do cool stuff.

267
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:30,840
Scott: Why did you do that?

268
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,305
Scott: You should've been honest.

269
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:36,763
Rym: Well, I I was somewhat honest Uh-huh.

270
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:45,500
Rym: The thing is I wasn't gonna come and say you sit in a cubicle all day Designing networks and then other people take those network designs and make them broken and stupid.

271
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:48,972
Scott: Why not?

272
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:50,580
Scott: See you ruined it.

273
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,531
Scott: You would have been the best person that they were sitting there all bored Like oh these old guys going blah blah blah.

274
00:20:56,792 --> 00:21:00,028
Scott: you would have come in and been like, yeah, it sucks Don't work here.

275
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:00,814
Scott: and they would've been like dude.

276
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:01,620
Scott: This guy's awesome.

277
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:04,912
Rym: See they actually really liked what I talked about because I mostly just sold anic.

278
00:21:05,253 --> 00:21:10,920
Rym: the thing is I didn't talk a lot about What it's actually like to be an IT guy other than the lie that it's really really fun.

279
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:18,312
Rym: I spent most of the time talking about the funny things that happen in the labs with computers and Like all the things computers can do and I should care about computers.

280
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:18,633
Rym: Yes.

281
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:20,220
Scott: That's good stuff to talk about right there.

282
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:24,240
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I guess I could give the whole speech right here, but that's all right, I don't know.

283
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,189
Rym: I brought this topic up.

284
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,199
Rym: I have a lot to say about it.

285
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:28,268
Rym: I didn't really cover in depth anything.

286
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:32,402
Scott: I had to say let's do that for a show next Monday what it's like to be Whatever.

287
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:33,770
Rym: I can do that right now.

288
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:34,394
Rym: Let's do it.

289
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:35,260
Rym: It's really unrewarding.

290
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,374
Rym: It's if it weren't for the fact that I make piles of money.

291
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,419
Rym: I wouldn't do it.

292
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,020
Rym: Yeah, it's it's literally the only reason I go to work is because there's a gigantic check waiting for me.

293
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:46,743
Rym: Yeah, I can.

294
00:21:47,085 --> 00:21:51,618
Rym: if I spend an hour doing something I hate I can at least think wow I made like 40 bucks just now.

295
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:56,179
Rym: That's the only thing that makes me go to work.

296
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:06,028
Rym: Anyway, it's time for things of the day.

297
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,260
Rym: So you might think Oh rims just linking to another stupid cat video.

298
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,815
Rym: It's probably one of those cats with extra fingers, which is what I thought it was.

299
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:14,980
Rym: So I was sitting there.

300
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,480
Rym: We're hanging out, you know weekend and I thought you were gonna do the the cats with the the box.

301
00:22:19,761 --> 00:22:22,217
Rym: I wanted to because that's really cute, but I'm saving that.

302
00:22:22,237 --> 00:22:22,640
Rym: All right.

303
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:29,599
Rym: However, if anyone there's a video of a bunch of cats playing with a box and It's mesmerizingly cute, but that's not my thing of the day.

304
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:39,290
Rym: So I see this video the cat with hands and I assume alright It's gonna be cats doing things with their paws like hey It's gonna be really cute and I ignore it.

305
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,299
Rym: and then later we have people over and I just click on it like alright Let's watch this.

306
00:22:42,381 --> 00:22:47,193
Rym: We got nothing else to do Because that seems to be what the front crew devolves to as the night goes on.

307
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:52,219
Rym: no matter what we just sit there Watching videos on the internet until there are none left.

308
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:54,247
Rym: Usually it's the game of peep.

309
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:57,960
Rym: someone will say like read a book read a book and someone will go what?

310
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,705
Rym: Oh, you've never seen blah.

311
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:04,635
Rym: and then we all watch it and anytime there's one person who hasn't seen a given thing We all watch it.

312
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,568
Rym: But I click on this.

313
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:09,120
Rym: and it's not just a cute video about cats.

314
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,312
Rym: In fact, it is a really fucking creepy video about a cat.

315
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:15,057
Scott: It's a it's a short movie.

316
00:23:15,097 --> 00:23:15,920
Scott: It's like a short film.

317
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,067
Scott: It's like a few minutes long.

318
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,074
Rym: Just watch it.

319
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:18,819
Rym: It's really cool.

320
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:20,300
Rym: It's really weird.

321
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:29,310
Rym: You'll probably predict what's going to happen at the end about 30 seconds before it happens Unless you're an idiot, but what you gonna do?

322
00:23:29,571 --> 00:23:32,978
Scott: the thing I want to really point out really hard to make something That's unpredictable these days.

323
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:35,932
Rym: The thing is it's really what I like about it.

324
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:39,156
Rym: And this is the cut of one of those few things It's really I love craft in.

325
00:23:39,237 --> 00:23:46,519
Rym: well, no It enters that that plateau of the weird or the shallow weird Canyon or all the different whatever that thing is where something's?

326
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,850
Rym: Realistic enough but not realistic enough.

327
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:51,035
Scott: You mean the Uncanny Valley?

328
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,319
Rym: Yeah, that's what I was thinking of.

329
00:23:52,741 --> 00:24:03,900
Rym: Okay, because the the little kid in the flashback park is realistic But really creepily realistic and he's kind of just the way it's animated sort of like a puppety clay.

330
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:07,454
Rym: He's like a really intense shaking puppet and that's one of the.

331
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:10,814
Rym: that really unnerves me when I see that It didn't know me that much but it was.

332
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:11,460
Scott: it was kind of weird.

333
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,419
Rym: I just kind of get shuddery when I see things like that.

334
00:24:13,963 --> 00:24:20,214
Scott: Uncanny Valley is when like if you try to make a CG woman But you don't make her so perfect that no one can tell.

335
00:24:20,234 --> 00:24:27,780
Scott: but you also You don't make her so CG that it's obvious that she's CG and it's sort of like not quite human.

336
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:35,712
Scott: It's like this uncanny valley where they look uncannily realistic But obviously not real and then it kind of weirds people out.

337
00:24:35,832 --> 00:25:00,860
Rym: There's actually a psychological theory that the reason Humans react to things that are so close to real but a little bit off is that it's kind of a defense mechanism against sickness And abnormal members of our species and that if someone's really sick or deformed or has a mutation or anything is wrong with them There'll be a little bit off There'll be something wrong with them and that sense of wrongness might be what we feel today like a vestigial survival instinct.

338
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:18,500
Rym: So I like how you know, if you've never seen someone with like elephant Titus or gangrene You'd be kind of like are also how humans tend to have a very strong uncontrollable aversion Reaction to anything that looks like yellow and puffs or anything that looks organic and rotting.

339
00:25:19,021 --> 00:25:24,676
Rym: But yet we don't have the same aversion instinct to chemical looking things or glowing dangerous looking cuz.

340
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:32,513
Scott: back in the caveman days anyone who didn't have that aversion got sick and died and only the people did have the aversion stuck around and made babies and I

341
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:41,719
Rym: T where they showed us pictures of things and we had to react immediately as to how how scary it was to us.

342
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:47,438
Rym: and By and far things that were organic were a lot scarier than things that were dangerous and chemical looking.

343
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,475
Rym: Yep But anyway, I digress check this out.

344
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:51,239
Rym: That's all I got to say.

345
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:54,299
Scott: So do you remember like when you were in school?

346
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,760
Scott: Did any of your science teachers have like glass jars with like some water and a piece of seaweed in them and that and it?

347
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,396
Scott: Like you were wondering hey, what the hell is that?

348
00:26:03,242 --> 00:26:07,436
Rym: We had a brain in my high school human brain like I just remember for some reason.

349
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:13,400
Scott: I don't remember specifically But I do remember there being like glass jars with some water and like a piece of seaweed in them.

350
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,604
Rym: I don't remember that at all.

351
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:29,540
Scott: Anyway, what those are if you wanted to know it's a biosphere in a jar and you can make one and it's pretty cool because you get a Jar with some water and a seaweed and maybe like I don't know a shrimp or a sea monkey or maybe nothing.

352
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:45,341
Scott: Maybe some rocks and a in a picture a plastic skeleton or a plastic pirate or something and you can get stuff to live in a jar that you put like on the windowsill in the Sun for a very long time possibly Forever's.

353
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:49,600
Rym: well, I've seen a lot of those things where they're sold in a store like a pre-made one.

354
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,624
Rym: It's like a glass sphere and there's some brine shrimp and a little bit of yeah Some kind of plant.

355
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:56,340
Rym: you got to put it in the Sun and all that business that well like that stuff.

356
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:04,578
Scott: Well make magazine which is possibly the only magazine that might still be worth buying even though if anything this tells you anything I still haven't bought it yet.

357
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:10,920
Scott: But there's a video that says how to make a tabletop biosphere and I think I might do this.

358
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:12,827
Scott: The thing is that the problem is here.

359
00:27:12,908 --> 00:27:20,219
Scott: right if you already have say a fish aquarium You already have everything you need to make this and you'll barely use any of it.

360
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:29,959
Scott: If I want to make this I've got to go to like the fish store and buy like, you know Those chemicals they use on the water and stuff like that, which is enough to make like a thousand of these.

361
00:27:30,503 --> 00:27:32,499
Rym: Luckily, there's a fish store right up the road.

362
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:39,140
Scott: No But I mean saying like I'm gonna have to the smallest amount I can buy is enough to make like a thousand biosphere.

363
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:42,819
Rym: We can always go to a store where they use that stuff anyway and just say hey, I'm making a biosphere.

364
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:45,334
Rym: If I give you five bucks, can I borrow this?

365
00:27:45,395 --> 00:27:46,240
Rym: much of all these things?

366
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,675
Scott: I think I just might also buy a fish in a bowl.

367
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:52,834
Rym: Ah Actually if you're ever out, I mean there's some of these around.

368
00:27:52,874 --> 00:27:58,573
Rym: but down in the Bronx I don't know if it's still there but at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the lobby.

369
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:01,881
Rym: There's a gigantic one of these Uh-huh.

370
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:08,720
Rym: It's like four feet in diameter and it's just this big glass sphere and there's actually a really cool kind of Carl Sagan cosmos.

371
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:10,408
Rym: We're all star stuff.

372
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:11,915
Rym: Check it out evolution thing there.

373
00:28:11,935 --> 00:28:13,382
Rym: That's really cool Nice.

374
00:28:13,523 --> 00:28:16,196
Rym: and in the middle of it is this gigantic little biosphere.

375
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:20,937
Scott: All righty You sure it's not just an aquarium, but it's actually yeah, I'm sure cuz there's a big thing about what it is.

376
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:23,103
Rym: explaining it Pretty cool.

377
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,247
Rym: Yeah, and it's very.

378
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:26,877
Rym: it was when I last saw it very pointedly in the Sun.

379
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,314
Scott: Ah That's that's necessary for the biosphere without the Sun.

380
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:34,060
Scott: It'll just be like CB dies and you're done for right?

381
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:41,660
Rym: So well if you might have noticed we do a podcast and the podcast is not streaming to you live over the internet.

382
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:43,759
Scott: Well, basically what happened here?

383
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Scott: The reason for this episode is that we did a podcasting panel at Connecticut Which I got to admit wasn't the greatest podcasting.

384
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,035
Rym: Well part of that was we didn't really care.

385
00:28:53,055 --> 00:29:03,360
Rym: and well I think the real issue was that the entire audience already knew what podcasting was But didn't want to do podcast themselves and they couldn't tell us what they wanted.

386
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,140
Rym: Like they couldn't even tell us why they came to the panel.

387
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:09,080
Rym: Yeah, so we just kind of told stories and messed around on in the front for an hour.

388
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:16,420
Scott: Some guy was like hey talk about you know internet radio and streaming radio and we're like, you know, we said hey, that's irrelevant.

389
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:18,139
Scott: Now that's there's no reason for that.

390
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:25,245
Scott: You know it only has one or two purposes and then they're they're slowly going away and they're gonna go away big time and He was kind of grumbly.

391
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:38,420
Scott: and then afterwards he came on our forum and he was super grumbly and made a crazy Batshit argument and everyone was you know, yelling at him and it was pretty much everyone versus him And he didn't counter anyone's points whatsoever.

392
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,525
Scott: So we're lazy.

393
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:44,058
Scott: We'll do a Monday show to talking about the streaming internet radio.

394
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:44,460
Scott: Why not?

395
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,560
Rym: Yep, this is I guess the one small drawback of being really active in the forums.

396
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:51,580
Rym: Is that if there's a really big conversation in the forums?

397
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,978
Rym: You're basically going to get the text version of GeekNights about that topic whenever we finally do it on the show.

398
00:29:57,219 --> 00:29:59,559
Scott: Yeah That's all right.

399
00:29:59,853 --> 00:30:10,940
Rym: also I used to have an idea when we first did this show that I would never say something in the forum if I was gonna talk about it in the show and the forums were just gonna be a Community and a breeding ground for me to get ideas for the show.

400
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,875
Rym: But now I can't know if I see an argument in the forums.

401
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:15,779
Rym: I can't just ignore it.

402
00:30:16,262 --> 00:30:23,539
Scott: Yeah, I got to go in there and fuck people up all right, so Streaming internet radio started at least for me.

403
00:30:23,841 --> 00:30:27,440
Scott: I mean, I'm sure technologically it started in some labs people figuring stuff out.

404
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Scott: But it really started for consumers with real player real audio.

405
00:30:32,224 --> 00:30:35,762
Scott: The way this worked was pretty much the same The.

406
00:30:35,822 --> 00:30:40,199
Scott: the principle behind it was even though the technology behind it was a lot shittier than it is now.

407
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:42,226
Scott: The principle behind it was the same.

408
00:30:42,647 --> 00:30:46,620
Scott: you have a digital audio file, you know, I guess in a real format.

409
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:46,961
Scott: I guess.

410
00:30:46,981 --> 00:30:50,508
Scott: now people use mp3 or ogg formats or you know the same formats.

411
00:30:50,528 --> 00:31:00,187
Scott: you download and Instead of letting you download the file you save it and play it whenever you want like you do with the podcast or an iTunes Music song or something like that.

412
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:07,060
Scott: They send it to you slowly not slowly But at a rate equal to the time it takes to play.

413
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:08,870
Scott: So let's say you have an mp3 that's 128 kilobits per second.

414
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:22,300
Scott: well If I send you over the internet 128 kilobits of data every second and you play it as it comes in You can hear the mp3 as you download it immediately.

415
00:31:22,783 --> 00:31:35,480
Scott: so if I talk into this microphone right now and I have a Computer that turns that into an mp3 as fast as it possibly can and sends it to you as fast as it possibly can You can hear what I'm talking in relatively real time.

416
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:36,142
Rym: Now.

417
00:31:36,202 --> 00:31:56,516
Rym: back then this served a lot of different purposes compared to what that sort of thing would serve nowadays or even a few years ago because back then you couldn't really have sound on a web page other than like a MIDI file and as a result if you wanted to play an audio clip for someone They had to download it and they had to download the whole thing before they could listen to on a

418
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:56,696
Scott: 14-4 modem

419
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,425
Rym: And they didn't want to save that file.

420
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:04,100
Rym: They wanted to listen to it once on their tiny-ass hard drive with their tiny-ass computer speakers.

421
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:08,440
Rym: They wanted to listen to it once because it was part of the content you were giving to them at that moment.

422
00:32:09,242 --> 00:32:16,586
Scott: Or they wanted to listen to the radio when the radio was bad, you know, or in the radio safety the analog You know terrestrial radio is sucking.

423
00:32:16,928 --> 00:32:28,739
Rym: they could listen to the terrestrial radio from around the world on their internet Even though you couldn't really do that in the early days of real audio, but you could kind of do it In the earliest days of real audio, all it was was alright.

424
00:32:29,341 --> 00:32:42,320
Rym: I can go to this website and oh they have clips from I don't know Les Miserables like 14-second clips and instead of Downloading the thing for you know a minute and then listening to it you hit play and then you could just listen to it.

425
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,244
Rym: Pretty much right then.

426
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:50,980
Scott: also it was used early on to give you previews of CDs You were gonna buy so you'd go to like CD now, which I don't think exists anymore.

427
00:32:51,462 --> 00:32:55,040
Scott: I think it got eaten by Amazon and Amazon and you say huh?

428
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,286
Scott: Do I want to buy this CD?

429
00:32:56,427 --> 00:33:08,299
Scott: and since you couldn't download mp3s really in those days You would go and click and say let me hear part of that first track or let me hear that's you know Hit single and it would start playing it for a few seconds like 30 seconds or so.

430
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:21,879
Rym: Now this kind of streaming is still really important to the internet today because we consume a lot of media That we don't want to keep on the internet not in real time not live But just there's a file out there like on YouTube and I want to watch it.

431
00:33:22,343 --> 00:33:27,349
Rym: I don't want to have to download the whole thing before I watch it I want to start watching it, but let it download in the background things like that.

432
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:29,957
Rym: And that is most things.

433
00:33:29,997 --> 00:33:30,920
Rym: just do that nowadays.

434
00:33:31,062 --> 00:33:41,380
Rym: It used to be a big deal back then But now like if you click on the mp3 link in our show on the website It'll probably just start playing in your browser long before it's downloaded.

435
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:44,960
Scott: Yeah, unless you right-click on it and say save as and then you'll download it.

436
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:51,500
Rym: Yeah, and that's not really what we're talking about because that is so ubiquitous that it's not even an interesting technology anymore.

437
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,465
Rym: It's not anything special.

438
00:33:52,505 --> 00:33:55,118
Rym: That's just the way you can download files.

439
00:33:55,198 --> 00:34:00,620
Rym: now It has to do with the way headers are and players are smart enough to figure out what the data is supposed to be.

440
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,428
Rym: in All that business and UDP that we're not gonna get into right.

441
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:18,670
Scott: what we're talking about is a technology that is actually pretty old and is now mostly unchanged and It's basically most of it is based on shoutcast Which is a thing that the winamp guys kind of know.

442
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,480
Rym: soft it really whips the llama's ass, right?

443
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:29,844
Scott: And what it is is you have a server a shoutcast server and whoever's running the shoutcast server can put mp3s into it.

444
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:36,594
Scott: they can put ogg into it and I think you can just plug a microphone into it and talk and They basically they're sort of like a DJ.

445
00:34:36,636 --> 00:34:36,897
Scott: They're a DJ.

446
00:34:37,621 --> 00:34:50,080
Scott: They set up music or audio and they put it into the server and you connect to the server with your shoutcast Client and the server sends you the audio that's currently being put into it in real time.

447
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:56,130
Scott: So if you stop and come back five minutes later You just missed five minutes of whatever was going on on that server.

448
00:34:56,531 --> 00:35:00,323
Rym: now on one hand when this first was able to be done On the internet.

449
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:03,318
Rym: It was really cool because all right now I can listen.

450
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:03,640
Rym: course.

451
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,675
Rym: It was cool in the same way that when multimedia computers came out.

452
00:35:07,258 --> 00:35:11,592
Rym: Oh shit I just watched a two-second video of Martin Luther King on my computer.

453
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:12,354
Rym: That was awesome.

454
00:35:12,595 --> 00:35:13,257
Scott: It's the same reason.

455
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,320
Scott: Microsoft in Carta.

456
00:35:14,443 --> 00:35:15,000
Scott: Oh my god.

457
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,320
Scott: I just saw like five minutes of Star Wars and incredibly low the resolution on my computer.

458
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:22,737
Rym: And when I say low resolution, we're talking like a hundred by a hundred.

459
00:35:22,918 --> 00:35:28,380
Scott: Yeah So the thing is it did and still does serve a few purposes.

460
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:35,368
Scott: the reason it was it was kind of popular not super popular but kind of popular was that You didn't have many ways to get.

461
00:35:35,528 --> 00:35:39,559
Scott: I mean mp3s were around but they weren't so easy to download with the ship modem.

462
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:49,153
Scott: and Because mp3s while low quality weren't no one was making them at stupidly low quality but streaming audio in those days was stupidly low quality.

463
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:55,076
Rym: part of the reason for that was just that Modem sucked that and it took a while to make an mp3.

464
00:35:55,418 --> 00:36:03,240
Scott: back in the day It was not trivial to make an mp3 file Yeah, and people didn't have the hard drive space to hold mp3s for a lot, you know or a lot of them.

465
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:08,460
Scott: So you would go to a website and you'd say you'd figure out what genre of music you liked.

466
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:13,353
Scott: You'd click a button and Winamp would just start playing that genre of music.

467
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,880
Scott: You didn't have control over exactly what song.

468
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:18,720
Scott: You couldn't really pause and come back to it.

469
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:24,925
Scott: It was pretty much just the radio but it was better than the radio because you could choose What you wanted and you did.

470
00:36:24,945 --> 00:36:28,274
Scott: there weren't commercials really and you know the terrestrial radio.

471
00:36:28,314 --> 00:36:33,619
Scott: the signal would might not be coming through Perfectly and the audio quality be kind of shady.

472
00:36:34,963 --> 00:36:44,120
Rym: You had the same problem with streaming audio back then and that the audio would often just cut out for a while and rebuffer and The server would go down with too many people connected and all sorts of crap.

473
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,486
Scott: Yep But it did have the advantage over.

474
00:36:46,527 --> 00:36:50,480
Scott: the main advantage over radio is that you could click a button and get techno coming right in.

475
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,335
Scott: You still can to this day and there was no techno on the rail radio.

476
00:36:54,817 --> 00:36:55,600
Scott: It just doesn't happen.

477
00:36:55,941 --> 00:37:03,342
Rym: Now, of course when the mp3 bust happened meaning when the RIAA and all those people suddenly realized wait a minute There's an internet.

478
00:37:03,362 --> 00:37:12,433
Rym: We better put a stop to this basically Napster kind of put down the shoutcast a bit Yes, and then the RIAA put down both the shoutcast and the naps.

479
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:14,520
Scott: They didn't really put down the shoutcast so much.

480
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,485
Scott: Yeah, they did is they sort of?

481
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:33,408
Scott: the problem is is that legally speaking they they've been pushing legislation and have pushed legislation in the past that forces the internet radio stations to be treated differently than terrestrial radio stations and they have to pay Royalties for every song they play.

482
00:37:33,689 --> 00:37:41,060
Scott: whereas usually radio station like terrestrial radio stations Get paid by record companies to play certain songs as opposed to others.

483
00:37:41,682 --> 00:37:48,632
Scott: It's the opposite with the internet radio or the internet radio station has to pay the record company all these royalties Most of which don't go to the actual artists.

484
00:37:48,954 --> 00:37:49,678
Scott: blah blah blah.

485
00:37:49,758 --> 00:37:50,080
Scott: It sucks.

486
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:59,028
Rym: Well, that's not really the issue because the thing is a lot of the you know shoutcast or whatever streaming audio stations back then Were just guys running them without any.

487
00:37:59,089 --> 00:38:05,206
Rym: they didn't care know about the law and they just played the music they liked and the RIAA Yeah those guys got shut down.

488
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:17,800
Rym: so internet radio was started appearing run by the corporate types and a lot of actual radio stations started streaming stuff and just paying the royalties and it was basically just the radio but on your computer.

489
00:38:18,301 --> 00:38:20,407
Scott: Yep, and I mean people.

490
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:22,673
Scott: there are people out there and there is a use.

491
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:25,340
Scott: I sometimes occasionally use streaming audio.

492
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,086
Scott: For example, I'm at work.

493
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:32,699
Scott: My iPod is full of podcasts or maybe it doesn't have that much music on it Or maybe I've listened to all the music on it.

494
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:42,088
Scott: I'm sitting at work or I'm sitting somewhere where there's an internet connection and I want music but the FM radio sucks balls And I just want to listen to music.

495
00:38:42,108 --> 00:38:43,172
Scott: I don't care what music.

496
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:51,220
Scott: I just want to pick a genre and go and It's useful for that purpose, but it really doesn't have too many other useful purposes that I could think of.

497
00:38:51,422 --> 00:38:52,920
Scott: I mean, do you use it for anything?

498
00:38:53,261 --> 00:39:13,220
Rym: Well, I mean the only thing I would use it for is like Scott said the music thing because if I just suddenly want to listen to some music Unless I have a bunch of music on my iPod or something I'm just out somewhere or even if I'm at my computer and I want to just try out a bunch of new music or see What new things I can find I don't particularly feel like going out and downloading something just to see if I like it or not.

499
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,800
Scott: I don't know particularly feel like digging through my mp3 is trying to make a playlist and deciding.

500
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,645
Scott: It's a lot easier to just not decide and say give me music in this genre And I'll if it's no good.

501
00:39:23,685 --> 00:39:24,588
Scott: I can just push stop.

502
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,210
Scott: Yeah.

503
00:39:25,712 --> 00:39:25,913
Rym: Yeah.

504
00:39:26,154 --> 00:39:32,378
Scott: So in that case, I really don't mind internet radio And I think that it's just a nice button that I can click on to make background noise at any time.

505
00:39:32,558 --> 00:39:48,099
Rym: now granted There's an issue now with internet radio in that basically because the the content producers of the big, you know RIAA types have decided that they're afraid of this kind of streaming because people might rip the stream and get their MP3s without having to pay.

506
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:58,240
Rym: They're basically trying to destroy it by making the licensing fees So absurd that no one but them could possibly run an internet radio station and make money.

507
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,273
Scott: Some people still be able to run them, but only people with money it would.

508
00:40:02,513 --> 00:40:08,974
Scott: amateurs will not be able to play RIAA music on them without paying the big bucks.

509
00:40:09,014 --> 00:40:09,476
Rym: now granted.

510
00:40:09,697 --> 00:40:16,193
Rym: I am of the mind It's not a very popular opinion on the internet that that's perfectly fine and they should make the royalties a billion dollars for all.

511
00:40:16,254 --> 00:40:27,015
Rym: I care because if The market will decide and if they decide to make their music so expensive for people to play All the amateur DJ's out there are just gonna use non RIAA music.

512
00:40:27,496 --> 00:40:30,673
Scott: and while that's awesome And I think that that's pretty cool.

513
00:40:30,713 --> 00:40:31,840
Scott: I totally like that action.

514
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,883
Scott: It's right up my alley.

515
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:46,769
Scott: when you look at the numbers right on all the listeners of internet radio stations People are listening to like the genre stations like hits of the 70s hits of the 80s, you know metal Hits, well, I can't say they're listening to.

516
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:48,594
Rym: I actually at IBM and at my work.

517
00:40:48,675 --> 00:40:50,320
Rym: I end up just dealing with computers.

518
00:40:50,361 --> 00:41:00,533
Rym: I run into a lot of people you know who installed internet radio whatever on their computer and they listen to it a lot and I talked to him a lot about That way before we did podcasting or anything and those generally.

519
00:41:00,554 --> 00:41:07,406
Rym: a lot of the people who listen to those things Don't know anything about Mp3s or they don't understand.

520
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,534
Rym: all they know is I want to listen to the radio.

521
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:11,220
Rym: I don't get radio inside.

522
00:41:11,663 --> 00:41:14,260
Rym: My friend told me I can go to the whatever and listen to the radio.

523
00:41:14,642 --> 00:41:16,590
Rym: I clicked on it and I listen to the right at RIT.

524
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:22,399
Scott: when I worked in that office as a part-time job the boss would just go to that and click on a genre and just listen.

525
00:41:22,419 --> 00:41:28,712
Scott: and If they start here and weird Creative Commons, you know They're not gonna have a stations like a Creative Commons.

526
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:31,564
Scott: blah blah blah and there's all these songs The person's never heard.

527
00:41:31,584 --> 00:41:33,272
Scott: they're gonna be like what the fuck is this shit.

528
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:39,534
Scott: and you look at the listenership on Existing stations that play only Creative Commons and free type awesome music.

529
00:41:39,995 --> 00:41:43,807
Scott: and while I might listen to those stations The actual listenership is pretty low.

530
00:41:43,867 --> 00:41:54,040
Scott: because I think my guess and I think it's a pretty educated guess The people who are savvy enough to know that that's a cool station to listen to are savvy enough to get podcasts.

531
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:56,840
Scott: They're not gonna bother with the streaming radio business.

532
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,926
Rym: well I think part of it is it really.

533
00:41:58,946 --> 00:42:16,954
Rym: it still doesn't matter because if people want to listen to like the normal whatever Corporate RIAA music and that all those radio stations get added or Stupefied or destroyed by the fact that the content producers want to make the royalties huge That's a market that's destroying itself and I don't really care.

534
00:42:16,974 --> 00:42:19,438
Rym: Yep, if they want it They're gonna have to pay for it.

535
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:25,296
Scott: The point I'd like to make though is that people who are savvy people understand how this stuff works.

536
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:27,666
Scott: people will understand what a pot You you provide.

537
00:42:27,686 --> 00:42:28,691
Scott: you listen to a podcast.

538
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:30,019
Scott: you understand a podcast, right?

539
00:42:30,922 --> 00:42:36,440
Scott: This stuff is not something you this could go away entirely and you probably wouldn't even blink.

540
00:42:36,782 --> 00:42:49,320
Rym: I mean think about it for especially for things like talk radio Which is what most podcasts are these days and what a lot of the popular radio was to among geeks like us Just a talk show that isn't just Howard Stern talking for eight hours straight.

541
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:52,220
Rym: You don't really want to jump in in the middle and then leave in the middle.

542
00:42:52,641 --> 00:43:04,913
Rym: You don't want to miss whatever they're talking about because if you get out of your car to get gas or because now you're at Work and you got to miss like the four hours while you're actually doing work before you can listen again Streaming anything like that.

543
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:05,659
Rym: It's just stupid

544
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:30,256
Scott: I think actually is that a lot of those radio shows like Howard Stern are designed in such a way where you would listen when you get into your car and stop listening when you get out exactly matter and that's sort of changing as people try to listen to the entire things from beginning to end like their episodes and That sort of format doesn't really work so well when someone's listening to your entire show.

545
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:39,806
Scott: and now people are podcasting making shows that are designed for you to listen to the entire thing and not designed for you to listen in and then cut out and listen and cut out.

546
00:43:40,188 --> 00:43:45,811
Scott: and they're giving you the freedom to listen to Only the episodes you want only the parts of the episodes you want.

547
00:43:46,092 --> 00:43:50,203
Scott: fast forward rewind stop play pause It.

548
00:43:50,223 --> 00:43:56,914
Scott: they're getting carried around with you wherever you want Listen to it on any device you want in all sorts of formats.

549
00:43:57,256 --> 00:43:58,240
Scott: send it to your friends.

550
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:01,274
Scott: They can listen to it to eat like, you know, you won't be like.

551
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:02,580
Scott: hey listen to Howard Stern yesterday.

552
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,424
Scott: You hear that funny joke?

553
00:44:03,484 --> 00:44:04,188
Scott: No, I didn't hear it.

554
00:44:04,288 --> 00:44:05,253
Scott: Oh, I guess you missed it.

555
00:44:05,494 --> 00:44:05,917
Scott: No here.

556
00:44:05,937 --> 00:44:06,600
Scott: I'll play it for you.

557
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,486
Scott: It's on my iPod.

558
00:44:07,506 --> 00:44:09,460
Scott: we can listen to it till the end of time.

559
00:44:10,143 --> 00:44:12,212
Scott: Once you have that you don't go back.

560
00:44:12,593 --> 00:44:14,060
Scott: the same reason why you get a TiVo.

561
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,873
Scott: You don't go back to just watching shit on cable.

562
00:44:17,275 --> 00:44:18,360
Scott: It just doesn't happen anymore.

563
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:19,625
Scott: TiVo game over.

564
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,036
Scott: when they get Netflix blockbuster is done.

565
00:44:22,297 --> 00:44:38,382
Rym: now some somewhat misinformed people try to make the argument that if someone's not willing to make time out of their day to listen at a designated time to a stream to hear something then they obviously don't care about that and The very clear rebuttal that is again like Scott said TiVo.

566
00:44:38,703 --> 00:44:41,711
Rym: the people who buy TiVo's watch more TV than anyone.

567
00:44:41,752 --> 00:44:48,840
Rym: they love TV and they watch more TV Because now they don't have to schedule their lives around the stupid TV schedule.

568
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:52,080
Rym: They watch exactly what they want whenever they want and they skip the ads.

569
00:44:52,842 --> 00:44:53,464
Scott: I don't understand.

570
00:44:53,504 --> 00:45:07,048
Scott: So if someone is not willing to suffer and pay a higher price, it's basically like saying Hey, I'm selling this DVD for 20. if I raise the price to 30 and you don't buy it You must just not love it as that much.

571
00:45:07,189 --> 00:45:08,313
Scott: so you don't really like it.

572
00:45:08,734 --> 00:45:09,698
Scott: I was willing to pay 20 for it.

573
00:45:10,521 --> 00:45:16,204
Scott: I like it that much, you know, it's like if someone isn't entirely devoting their whole life to something They don't like it at all.

574
00:45:16,264 --> 00:45:16,907
Scott: that it's.

575
00:45:16,987 --> 00:45:18,132
Scott: it's not an all-or-nothing thing.

576
00:45:18,553 --> 00:45:20,160
Scott: people like something a certain amount.

577
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:31,318
Scott: some people like something enough to where they're willing to Cancel the rest of their lives at a particular moment in time to watch it Like someone likes the Super Bowl enough that they will schedule their whole day around it.

578
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:41,994
Rym: great at least I can say that for sports and Live events like the first time a human lands on Mars or whatever things anything that's Happening in real time.

579
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:46,070
Rym: that matters in real time and it matters if you know about it in real time.

580
00:45:46,654 --> 00:45:48,249
Rym: Streaming is still really important for that.

581
00:45:48,682 --> 00:45:53,310
Scott: Yeah But internet radio streaming isn't gonna matter for those sorts of things.

582
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:57,805
Scott: TV still handles those and while I'd like to see TV go away.

583
00:45:57,825 --> 00:45:59,430
Scott: I don't see it going anywhere.

584
00:45:59,952 --> 00:46:04,530
Rym: Yep, and even for radio, I mean if you want to listen to the sports game, let's do it on the radio.

585
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:07,624
Rym: You're not gonna get streaming radio in your car over the internet.

586
00:46:07,725 --> 00:46:14,550
Scott: Actually, there is one thing I would if there was a way for me to like stream audio or video of live sporting events on the internet.

587
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:18,650
Scott: I am willing to pay a small amount for that service.

588
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,230
Rym: I would actually quite a bit to be able to stream in high-definition hockey games over the internet.

589
00:46:23,411 --> 00:46:24,715
Rym: Well, I'd pay a lot of money for that.

590
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:31,090
Scott: Google video is putting hockey games up, but they were in low resolution and They were after the game.

591
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:40,550
Rym: So I already knew what the score was after the game is fine for me because I don't bother reading the score I know but it's live is just Something else, but I just want I mean for hockey.

592
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:41,516
Rym: I just want to see the game.

593
00:46:41,556 --> 00:46:47,346
Rym: the problem is and I would rather see it live The real problem was the resolution because hockey at low resolution.

594
00:46:47,487 --> 00:46:48,190
Scott: You can't see the puck.

595
00:46:48,511 --> 00:46:53,530
Rym: I mean hockey on normal resolution on HDTV is the bare minimum.

596
00:46:53,891 --> 00:47:00,150
Scott: Yep, the thing is I'm willing to pay for probably hockey f1 and baseball if I at least Mets baseball.

597
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,118
Rym: The problem is they actually majorly.

598
00:47:03,158 --> 00:47:08,151
Scott: baseball does offer that they charge a fuck ton of money for it more than I'm ever willing to Pay.

599
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:10,499
Scott: good God, I'd pay like five bucks for the season.

600
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,606
Scott: There's selling like a zillion.

601
00:47:12,646 --> 00:47:13,750
Scott: don't make a look up what it is.

602
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:14,519
Scott: I'm not gonna bother.

603
00:47:14,681 --> 00:47:15,410
Scott: it's a lot of money.

604
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:20,589
Scott: I've looked it up before unless it suddenly dropped in which case I don't know but it's a lot of money.

605
00:47:21,432 --> 00:47:23,440
Scott: I could get cable television for that money.

606
00:47:23,781 --> 00:47:26,330
Scott: Why would I bother paying for streaming audio?

607
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:33,875
Rym: and plus I mean you look at all the radio stations that offer bits of their content as podcasts like Penn Radio or NPR or the BBC.

608
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:41,270
Rym: a Lot more people from all the statistics that get published Listen to the podcast then bother listening to the radio.

609
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:45,584
Scott: The other thing is that when you're broadcast in other an advantage for the person broadcasting.

610
00:47:45,604 --> 00:47:47,210
Scott: when you put a podcast out.

611
00:47:47,691 --> 00:47:59,886
Scott: You don't know exactly how many listeners there are but you know about for example, you won't know that you have exactly 1032 listeners, but you will know that you had between a thousand and fifteen hundred.

612
00:48:00,368 --> 00:48:07,550
Scott: when you do Terrestrial radio, right, you know Jack shit, cuz you're going on Nielsen ratings draw crap.

613
00:48:07,945 --> 00:48:37,350
Rym: Yeah If you look up sometime how the radio ratings work and that is probably the reason that most radio sucks I mean think we live in New York City where but right here We get so many radio stations that if you just turn on your radio with a normal antenna And you don't skip like to the stations that are coming in the strongest, but just skip megahertz per megahertz Every single step of the way is a clear as day radio station and most of them are playing the exact same music.

614
00:48:38,173 --> 00:48:38,475
Rym: Not like.

615
00:48:38,495 --> 00:48:38,917
Rym: they're not like.

616
00:48:38,937 --> 00:48:41,650
Rym: they're the same station, but they're all playing the same kind of music.

617
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:45,130
Rym: They're all the same genres of music and it's just all kind of crappy.

618
00:48:45,484 --> 00:48:51,966
Scott: Yeah You're not gonna find Unless you go to the way ends of the dial at the weird times any sort of weird music.

619
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:54,669
Scott: or you know the kind of stuff That's commonplace on the Internet.

620
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:59,935
Rym: My favorite thing is if you're driving somewhere in the middle of nowhere like like 3 in the morning Turn on a.m.

621
00:48:59,975 --> 00:49:02,990
Rym: Radio and you're gonna find some crazy guy talking about something crazy.

622
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:08,074
Scott: You're not gonna find Derek the Bandit Sound Republic with South African Psychedelic trance.

623
00:49:08,094 --> 00:49:09,421
Rym: see honestly, that's the other thing.

624
00:49:09,461 --> 00:49:10,949
Rym: while I can see you know.

625
00:49:11,211 --> 00:49:14,445
Rym: Oh, just hit an internet stream and get some music genre, whatever.

626
00:49:14,465 --> 00:49:21,176
Rym: I Can't really do that in my car and the technology to let me do that in my car is still a long way off for The price I'm willing to pay.

627
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:28,590
Scott: yeah while streaming radio has that purpose, you know And it's good in an office or in your room when you're bored time-shifted media has the same thing.

628
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:32,623
Rym: There's genre podcasts that are just all the music you want all the blues.

629
00:49:32,663 --> 00:49:33,646
Rym: you want all the techno.

630
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:34,890
Rym: you want all the rock.

631
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:37,182
Scott: You want all the classical you want.

632
00:49:37,262 --> 00:49:38,830
Scott: and if it's in a podcast?

633
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:42,850
Scott: Well, you can just load up your iPod with a bunch of episodes of that podcast.

634
00:49:43,412 --> 00:49:44,216
Scott: Let's do it in the car.

635
00:49:44,236 --> 00:49:44,799
Scott: Let's say it.

636
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,290
Scott: It does everything streaming radio does and more.

637
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,878
Scott: So why do we need the stupid streaming?

638
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,829
Scott: It's just it's sort of redundant now.

639
00:49:51,351 --> 00:50:05,503
Rym: Also streaming is really at this point beyond the reach of amateurs in the sense that if you get at all popular You're totally screwed because the amount of bandwidth it takes to stream audio Will pretty much crush any consumer level connection.

640
00:50:05,543 --> 00:50:10,410
Scott: if you have more than a handful of listeners Yeah, I mean you need to it for every listener.

641
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:13,864
Scott: Like let's say you're doing 128 kilobit per second mp3.

642
00:50:14,266 --> 00:50:15,210
Scott: You have two listeners.

643
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:20,022
Scott: That means you need enough bandwidth to send out 256 kilobits of data every second.

644
00:50:20,463 --> 00:50:22,088
Scott: Let's see you have a thousand listeners.

645
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:23,594
Scott: Oh crap.

646
00:50:23,776 --> 00:50:36,739
Rym: now theoretically with IPv6 and fancy networking things There are ways around that where you send one packet out and then routers send it to all the people who want it But none of that works in practice.

647
00:50:36,879 --> 00:50:38,384
Rym: the way you would want it to know.

648
00:50:38,866 --> 00:50:54,810
Scott: and the thing with a podcast Is while I still have to pay bandwidth because if a thousand people download my 50 megabyte mp3 as a thousand times 50 megabytes But it doesn't matter how fast they get it because they're not listening to it until it's done.

649
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:57,870
Scott: So if it's kind of slow, that's okay.

650
00:50:58,553 --> 00:51:01,550
Scott: Also, they don't do it all at once.

651
00:51:02,014 --> 00:51:03,770
Scott: They do it at different times.

652
00:51:03,878 --> 00:51:06,837
Scott: Sure a lot of people are gonna Automatically download it when you put it up.

653
00:51:07,258 --> 00:51:19,190
Scott: a lot of people are gonna tend to download it when they get home from work Or when they wake up in the morning, but it's not all at once and that makes a tremendous Difference like a ludicrously tremendous difference.

654
00:51:19,693 --> 00:51:26,322
Scott: So, you know if at the time when a bunch of people are downloading it It'll be slower and the time when a few people are downloading be faster.

655
00:51:26,342 --> 00:51:27,587
Scott: Hooray, whatever.

656
00:51:27,607 --> 00:51:32,310
Rym: Yeah I don't know why we did a show selling podcasting to people who are listening to a podcast.

657
00:51:32,431 --> 00:51:33,817
Scott: Yeah, that kind of it's kind of silly.

658
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,264
Rym: We used to have a lot better to do.

659
00:51:35,285 --> 00:51:38,368
Scott: I'll be honest Yeah, and I just kind of wanted to.

660
00:51:38,449 --> 00:51:48,286
Rym: you know We had an argument an argument that and I'm gonna say this pretty much openly and straight up We won that argument without taking a single point of damage.

661
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:52,741
Rym: if this was burning wheel We did not lose a single point of the body of our argument.

662
00:51:52,762 --> 00:51:54,648
Rym: In fact, somehow we gained point.

663
00:51:54,668 --> 00:52:08,999
Scott: Yeah streaming audio Kind of go in the way the dodo bird podcasting while not Guaranteed to be this lock in to the new media hedge a hegemony Hegemony hegemony.

664
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:23,130
Rym: I actually don't know how to pronounce that word Is probably not like the end solution to this but at the same time Even if the internet were ubiquitous and everywhere and your car stereo could just stream audio till the cows come home.

665
00:52:24,013 --> 00:52:28,454
Rym: I love the fact that I used a phrase till the cows come home in reference to very high technology I know.

666
00:52:28,998 --> 00:52:32,810
Rym: but even in that sense Why would someone bother streaming?

667
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:38,592
Rym: When they can just time shift and listen to the exact show they want to in their car and pause it when they get out Yeah,

668
00:52:38,934 --> 00:52:45,940
Scott: and I know people are gonna say oh well you're you can grab the streaming audio and save it and blow But that's not something the average consumer can do.

669
00:52:46,101 --> 00:52:47,124
Scott: and why bother?

670
00:52:47,285 --> 00:52:48,530
Scott: why go through the extra effort?

671
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:56,196
Rym: I mean we and while we could offer the shows live periodically and we're thinking about doing that over Skype to see if people want To just listen to a raw GeekNights.

672
00:52:56,698 --> 00:52:58,444
Rym: That's not it's.

673
00:52:58,544 --> 00:53:01,836
Rym: we would do that because we wanted to for fun Not because it would help us in any way.

674
00:53:01,857 --> 00:53:04,990
Rym: We're not gonna gain listeners or get anything out of doing that.

675
00:53:05,113 --> 00:53:05,749
Scott: And think about it.

676
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:11,350
Scott: Would you live if you could only listen to GeekNights at say five o'clock at night every or you know?

677
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,350
Scott: I guess it's a late show eleven o'clock at night Monday through Thursday.

678
00:53:15,074 --> 00:53:16,602
Scott: How many times would you listen?

679
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:17,890
Scott: how many times do you listen now?

680
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:22,310
Scott: And how many times would you listen if it was eleven o'clock at night Monday through Thursday?

681
00:53:23,171 --> 00:53:40,770
Rym: And also as my final point to just hammer this down the person who made this little shitstorm of a crappy argument against us I would just like to say that we have a Solid four figures worth of listeners very solid and he has a solid one figures worth of listeners.

682
00:53:41,471 --> 00:53:43,455
Rym: Also, that wasn't just his listeners.

683
00:53:43,495 --> 00:53:44,778
Rym: That was the most listeners.

684
00:53:44,818 --> 00:53:45,780
Rym: He'd ever had at once.

685
00:53:46,631 --> 00:53:49,449
Scott: Also, it seems that he's now listening to the show.

686
00:53:49,751 --> 00:53:50,617
Scott: So we win.

687
00:53:50,677 --> 00:54:01,910
Rym: for someone who's not a fan of the podcast There's a possibility that he is smart and he is doing what we have done with other Crappy podcast in that we make fun of them or we try to start an argument with them.

688
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:02,552
Rym: we didn't.

689
00:54:02,592 --> 00:54:11,070
Rym: we don't do this recently, but we used to and then they get mad and say something about it and link to us and Then all their listeners listen to us and just keep listening.

690
00:54:11,532 --> 00:54:15,730
Rym: That might be what he's trying, but I don't think his cunning plan was thought out the way he thought it was.

691
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,218
Scott: Well, you just gave him the cunning plan.

692
00:54:17,278 --> 00:54:19,410
Scott: So if he doesn't take advantage of it as a tool.

693
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:22,482
Rym: Well, we never linked to him and he never even really linked to himself.

694
00:54:22,622 --> 00:54:23,465
Rym: So yeah.

695
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:24,529
Scott: Oh, well, whatever.

696
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:28,022
Rym: Granted if even a fraction of you guys actually listen to him.

697
00:54:28,123 --> 00:54:29,929
Rym: I guarantee it would take a server down like that.

698
00:54:30,231 --> 00:54:36,357
Rym: Yeah, all right audio not the greatest and before we go any further I don't have music ready for it.

699
00:54:36,438 --> 00:54:39,270
Rym: cuz I haven't really bothered and I don't want to steal music.

700
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:40,316
Rym: I know a lot of podcasts.

701
00:54:40,336 --> 00:54:42,770
Rym: just take music they like and put it in their show.

702
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:45,363
Rym: But we try to be you know, somewhat legal and legit here.

703
00:54:45,384 --> 00:54:47,566
Rym: I Got a geek bite for you.

704
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:51,626
Scott: I don't know if that's the best music.

705
00:54:51,686 --> 00:54:55,984
Rym: No problem But it's kind of like the music we used to do when we first did the show.

706
00:54:56,045 --> 00:55:00,564
Rym: remember that the Original GeekNights opening theme don't tell people they don't know about that.

707
00:55:00,584 --> 00:55:01,769
Rym: I'm not gonna tell him what it is.

708
00:55:02,152 --> 00:55:04,430
Rym: I'm just gonna tell him that the opening theme used to be different.

709
00:55:04,712 --> 00:55:07,287
Rym: It did and if they know where to look they can probably hear it.

710
00:55:07,548 --> 00:55:19,410
Rym: Yeah anyway, our friend Kate decided that we had to watch this one day and She described it and she showed us the cover and all we could think and I'll admit we were totally wrong on this.

711
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:30,250
Rym: This is gonna be some crap like Jane Eyre kind of Oh Nobles and people talking to each other in the 1800s about the estate and whatever will I do if I have to marry that?

712
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:31,173
Rym: Dreadful, mr.

713
00:55:31,213 --> 00:55:31,655
Rym: Simpson.

714
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:39,263
Scott: That's what I thought it was gonna be and thus while we watched the early parts of it I was busy reading some Tezuka manga, which I luckily had on hand.

715
00:55:39,323 --> 00:55:40,326
Rym: I believe it was Oda Kira.

716
00:55:40,366 --> 00:55:46,488
Scott: He don't really was But when I finished it before this show finished and thus I was saved.

717
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:48,882
Rym: now The thing is we decide.

718
00:55:48,923 --> 00:55:50,752
Rym: we watched it because you know We well.

719
00:55:50,852 --> 00:55:55,304
Rym: while it sounded like something we would hate we trusted her and we watched it.

720
00:55:55,846 --> 00:55:58,473
Rym: and all I want to say is Throw out anything.

721
00:55:58,514 --> 00:56:04,734
Rym: you would think about something like this and I'm gonna tell you straight up that this is one of the funnier things I've seen in my life.

722
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:06,620
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty goddamn funny.

723
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,908
Rym: I'm not maybe not top 10 but top 50 easily.

724
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:12,358
Rym: This is this is Horatio level of enjoyment here.

725
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:15,066
Scott: It is somehow there's something about it.

726
00:56:15,206 --> 00:56:19,190
Scott: where it is It's so it's based on novels, right?

727
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:24,447
Rym: it's sort of an the same based on a pretty damn good novel - from I look it's it's.

728
00:56:24,868 --> 00:56:35,690
Scott: it's a 17 slash 1800s historical fictional but realistic miniseries of television movie things.

729
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:41,530
Scott: So it's very similar to Horatio and it gives me the same level almost the same level enjoyment.

730
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:44,830
Scott: It's not quite as good as a ratio, but it's the same type of enjoyment.

731
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:47,708
Rym: Though it seems like a lot of these British kind of say what it is.

732
00:56:47,749 --> 00:56:48,533
Rym: yet No we haven't.

733
00:56:49,017 --> 00:57:01,043
Rym: they have this formula of set up a situation where you like some characters and don't like some other characters and things build up and things build up and You kind of know how it's gonna end, but you don't know the details.

734
00:57:01,324 --> 00:57:15,365
Rym: So it's not the end that matters it's the journey and then there will always be the point where everyone gets exactly what they deserve in the most epic and Hilarious and wonderful and satisfying possible way you could ever have it be.

735
00:57:15,485 --> 00:57:16,227
Rym: that's what I love.

736
00:57:16,288 --> 00:57:17,030
Scott: I love that action.

737
00:57:17,251 --> 00:57:18,458
Scott: I've been right up my alley.

738
00:57:18,478 --> 00:57:20,390
Scott: That's like 11 pins knocked down.

739
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:30,860
Rym: Nor if we even if we did a whole show atheist, oh my god.

740
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:36,909
Rym: Just there if we talked about Tom Jones, the reason we're not doing a whole Tom Jones by the.

741
00:57:36,929 --> 00:57:40,470
Rym: yes This is an adaptation of Henry Fielding's Tom Jones.

742
00:57:40,651 --> 00:57:44,102
Scott: I'm linking to the exact not Tom Jones with the giant penis.

743
00:57:44,202 --> 00:57:46,550
Scott: No, not that Tom Jones the rake.

744
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,058
Scott: It is the story.

745
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:50,412
Scott: Tom Jones of the giant penis is also a rake Yes,

746
00:57:50,814 --> 00:57:57,121
Rym: but it is the story of a young man who is a ladies man But he's also a really nice guy and you're really

747
00:57:57,141 --> 00:58:00,192
Scott: like the Tom Jones lounge singer with the giant penis Who's a rake

748
00:58:00,312 --> 00:58:04,587
Rym: and he likes a girl and the world just pisses on him,

749
00:58:04,888 --> 00:58:05,069
Scott: but you

750
00:58:05,109 --> 00:58:05,430
Rym: know what?

751
00:58:05,831 --> 00:58:11,688
Rym: He never loses his optimism and let me tell you there are some funny fucking scenes in this show.

752
00:58:11,908 --> 00:58:14,950
Scott: Good God The best is with the pistol.

753
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:15,852
Scott: That is the.

754
00:58:15,933 --> 00:58:17,397
Scott: that is the highlight of the whole show.

755
00:58:17,557 --> 00:58:24,016
Rym: and the second best moment is the duel with the same dude Who is in the pistol scene?

756
00:58:24,036 --> 00:58:25,120
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

757
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,850
Rym: I'll ruin this scene this one scene to give you an idea.

758
00:58:28,452 --> 00:58:33,010
Rym: So there's this guy and you'll know him when you see him because you're gonna hate this character.

759
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,093
Scott: He's an ass like.

760
00:58:34,274 --> 00:58:39,970
Rym: this character has no redeeming qualities, especially when you get to watch the rape of the Sabines.

761
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:54,648
Rym: And then he doesn't like this guy who is like the most awesome guy ever who's basically all alternates between drunken and raging and sometimes crying.

762
00:58:54,669 --> 00:58:59,141
Scott: and He is like the most loving angry drunk.

763
00:58:59,463 --> 00:59:01,470
Rym: and you really feel for this guy and he's hilarious.

764
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:07,510
Rym: But this evil guy is so just Francine empty pansy and he gets insulted.

765
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:07,953
Rym: So he's like.

766
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:16,389
Rym: I think I would like that kind of guy well Any kind of saunters over and pulls out this tiny little white glove and kind of like pops him in the face with.

767
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:25,350
Rym: he's like My honor and the guy just looks at him smiles hauls up and punches him across the room.

768
00:59:26,054 --> 00:59:27,907
Scott: It's quite the hilarity now.

769
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:35,079
Rym: The only reason we're not doing a show about it is that it would be nothing but us Recounting hilarious scenes and laughing at each other for like an hour.

770
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:37,185
Scott: Hey, this thing starts off.

771
00:59:37,246 --> 00:59:46,867
Scott: and like a little village in England somewhere, you know, there's sort of like hanky-panky going on, but he really likes one girl, but he's still hanky-panky.

772
00:59:47,449 --> 00:59:49,713
Scott: and then Craziness in London.

773
00:59:49,773 --> 00:59:52,762
Scott: OMG and oh god it pretty much won.

774
00:59:52,842 --> 00:59:57,156
Rym: if you liked Horatio hornblower at all You'll like this just as much.

775
00:59:57,498 --> 00:59:57,719
Rym: Oh, yeah.

776
00:59:57,819 --> 00:59:58,362
Rym: I'm serious.

777
00:59:58,442 --> 01:00:03,726
Scott: Even if you only like to ratio for the boats This has no boats and the Navy is in it slightly.

778
01:00:03,847 --> 01:00:05,973
Rym: Yes Pardon me, sir.

779
01:00:05,993 --> 01:00:09,021
Rym: Have you ever considered a career in his majesty's Navy?

780
01:00:09,702 --> 01:00:11,347
Scott: Well, yes, I gotta go.

781
01:00:11,447 --> 01:00:20,550
Rym: Yeah but Even if you've never won you should watch Horatio hornblower because goddamn and you should also watch this.

782
01:00:21,113 --> 01:00:22,663
Rym: I can't recommend this enough.

783
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:25,639
Scott: Good God Yeah, nice geek.

784
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:28,676
Rym: But also it's like 36 bucks on Amazon.

785
01:00:28,817 --> 01:00:30,926
Rym: Oh sweet, and I'll point I might just buy it.

786
01:00:30,986 --> 01:00:31,829
Rym: I'm thinking of buying it now.

787
01:00:32,091 --> 01:00:32,996
Scott: I don't really want to watch it.

788
01:00:33,217 --> 01:00:35,430
Rym: Oh, maybe I kind of want to own it to lend to other people.

789
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:37,604
Scott: I kind of want to get it to get some clips out.

790
01:00:37,624 --> 01:00:39,848
Rym: Oh That'd be some good audio.

791
01:00:41,531 --> 01:00:46,933
Rym: But and also I just want to point out there's no Amazon refer or anything in the link I'm making.

792
01:00:46,993 --> 01:00:50,230
Rym: so it's not like we're trying to make money off of telling you to buy this stupid thing.

793
01:00:50,695 --> 01:00:58,850
Scott: Yeah other people, you know Whenever you go to a blog and they link to Amazon If you actually click on that link and buy the thing on Amazon that blog gets money.

794
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:04,410
Scott: So instead you should go to Amazon directly and search for whatever it is.

795
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:05,515
Scott: They were trying to sell you.

796
01:01:05,636 --> 01:01:08,410
Rym: and then the thing is I wouldn't be above doing that.

797
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:15,390
Rym: But if we ever talked about something on the show and link to it like that We would tell you openly that we did that in the link.

798
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:18,965
Rym: We would also say this is a refer link that will make us money.

799
01:01:18,985 --> 01:01:21,088
Rym: You would never lie We would never hide it.

800
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,770
Scott: But yeah other blogs are just linked to things on Amazon and not say it's a referral link.

801
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:25,355
Scott: It just kind of.

802
01:01:25,698 --> 01:01:27,030
Scott: you know, here I'm linking to Amazon.

803
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:32,169
Scott: You don't realize it because you don't look at that incredibly complicated URL and you don't understand what's going on.

804
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:34,156
Scott: But yeah people make money off of that.

805
01:01:34,397 --> 01:01:36,002
Scott: Amazon gives the money to sell books.

806
01:01:36,062 --> 01:01:38,330
Scott: So seriously, we're not making money from Amazon.

807
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,630
Scott: We're just trying to tell you to go buy this because it's awesome.

808
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:46,834
Rym: we stayed at their house a lot later than we'd planned on just to watch the rest of it and It was worth it.

809
01:01:47,276 --> 01:01:51,350
Rym: there the scene it's like the climax is at the end the yelling and screaming.

810
01:01:51,611 --> 01:01:53,358
Rym: It was Horatio level and the pistol.

811
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:54,262
Rym: aha the pistol.

812
01:01:54,443 --> 01:01:56,110
Scott: It was funny cuz the pistol was so small.

813
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:57,093
Scott: It was so perfect.

814
01:01:57,394 --> 01:02:01,285
Scott: Also the facial expression so perfect in like the first time being so perfect.

815
01:02:01,466 --> 01:02:09,910
Rym: the show like goes in the direction You're like, alright I see the plot of this show and then someone fucking dies and the plot is not what you expected at all.

816
01:02:10,312 --> 01:02:11,035
Rym: And it's just great.

817
01:02:11,618 --> 01:02:12,302
Scott: It's the best.

818
01:02:12,402 --> 01:02:13,507
