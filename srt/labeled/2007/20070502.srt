00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,407
Rym: It's Wednesday May 2nd.

2
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:12,330
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,872 --> 00:00:15,560
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:26,238
Rym: Tonight we preview darker than black Romeo and Juliet rocket girls and perhaps one of my favorite shows ever sighs and Jotaro.

5
00:00:28,643 --> 00:00:29,678
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:33,939
Rym: Well, I found a blackberry.

7
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:35,947
Scott: You found a blackberry.

8
00:00:36,188 --> 00:00:45,574
Rym: well pretty much whenever I drive home instead of taking the train I always drive past breakneck Ridge, so Invariably I climb it real quick and then climb back down and get on my way and go home.

9
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:49,630
Rym: and while I was climbing I saw what looked like a little DS case or something.

10
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,704
Rym: so huh, and I look over there and sure enough There's a blackberry.

11
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:58,336
Scott: well usually when you turn a blackberry on it'll say this blackberry belongs to so-and-so.

12
00:00:58,437 --> 00:00:59,279
Scott: we live at so-and-so.

13
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:00,505
Scott: Does it say that?

14
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:05,337
Rym: I haven't looked at it at all other than that I saw it has a bunch of really lame messages in it.

15
00:01:06,262 --> 00:01:07,707
Scott: What variety of blackberry is it?

16
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:09,173
Scott: what color is it black?

17
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:10,538
Scott: okay, so it's the.

18
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:12,083
Rym: it's that guy I don't know or care.

19
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:14,330
Scott: It's green color or black and white color?

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,614
Rym: all right doesn't matter.

21
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:16,257
Rym: It does.

22
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:17,180
Scott: it doesn't matter at all.

23
00:01:17,882 --> 00:01:19,246
Rym: It has no bearing on the story.

24
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:24,767
Rym: the point is I found some dumbass his cell phone who lost it on the mountain Very low on the mountain.

25
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:27,380
Rym: I might add like sitting openly in the middle of the trail.

26
00:01:27,702 --> 00:01:29,979
Rym: I don't know how you could drop something that big and heavy and not notice.

27
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:34,340
Rym: Yeah, uh, but I guess I'll have to contact him somehow and give it back to him.

28
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,179
Rym: Maybe I'll get some sort of reward like I gave that kid who found my cell phone way back in the city.

29
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:41,448
Scott: Well, what about your cell phone?

30
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,777
Rym: Oh you mean my smashed cell phone?

31
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:45,490
Rym: Yeah that one I smashed it.

32
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,359
Rym: good job.

33
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:53,080
Rym: You realize that cell phone has been smashed crushed dropped or immersed in water like 20 times in recent memory alone.

34
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,105
Scott: Yeah Well you got to stop doing that.

35
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:58,277
Rym: if I go climbing or biking or running I bring a cell phone.

36
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:01,998
Rym: that way if I hurt Myself I can call the police or the ambulance or whoever to come get me.

37
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:06,300
Scott: You can still like strap it to yourself in such a way that it does not get smashed.

38
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:09,074
Rym: Where am I gonna stress say I'm climbing where am I gonna put it?

39
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:10,199
Scott: well like for the iPod?

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,559
Scott: They have like those little wrist armband things.

41
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:15,750
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna put a cell phone there plus it would get smashed.

42
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:16,473
Rym: You can't climb.

43
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:23,303
Rym: I bang my arms into rocks all the time Alrighty yeah Plus.

44
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,040
Rym: the cell phone is over three years old beating the hell out of anyway.

45
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:30,640
Scott: So and my cell phone that was three years old is still working.

46
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,187
Scott: I just stopped using it cuz it was old.

47
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:34,116
Rym: Yeah, I still have my original cell phone.

48
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:34,739
Rym: It still works.

49
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,329
Rym: fine I just oh it does it.

50
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,638
Scott: Yeah, it does.

51
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,565
Rym: yeah It's right over there.

52
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:42,500
Rym: You can charge it up and still use it to call the police or something if you want.

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,709
Scott: Yeah, I don't think you can make regular calls.

54
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,397
Scott: and isn't the screen broken and only the outside screen?

55
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:49,199
Rym: everything else is fine.

56
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:51,749
Scott: The outside screen is the most important part.

57
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,920
Scott: I use my cell phone more as a clock that has a phone.

58
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:58,489
Rym: Anyway alright alright, so what do you have in the news gun?

59
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:05,390
Scott: well if you weren't paying attention to the Internet's there was the gigantic news and it was so gigantic.

60
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,353
Scott: you basically conquered dig like a Goliath or a Cyclops or something probably Cyclops.

61
00:03:11,635 --> 00:03:11,936
Scott: I don't know.

62
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:18,667
Scott: basically There's a key an encryption key that can decrypt HD DVD movies.

63
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:26,280
Scott: so if you had this key and you wrote a piece of software using this key You could take an HD DVD movie and do anything you wanted with it.

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,252
Scott: You can make copies you could put it on the bit Torrance whatever.

65
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:30,974
Scott: It doesn't matter.

66
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:47,000
Scott: so of course this key is Technically DMCA not okay, and the people who you know are in charge of maintaining this key the AACS Went around and they found people posting this key on the internet, and they said hey don't post that key.

67
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:53,607
Rym: Well the problem is the key is actually a very short is Relatively easy to remember number.

68
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:55,795
Rym: It is just a number and that's it.

69
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:56,237
Scott: Yeah.

70
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:57,180
Scott: It's just a number.

71
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,885
Rym: It's trivial to just type it anywhere.

72
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:10,368
Scott: yep, so what happened is early in the day yesterday people You know on dig would just post the number in a comment on a story that had nothing to do with it And the people would bump the number up.

73
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:21,269
Scott: and then some people would submit stories to dig And they would say they would put the number as the subject and the content and they would link to a page that had the Number and so on and so forth.

74
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:27,232
Scott: and dig started out by saying all right listen We can't do anything illegal if you want us to still exist.

75
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:28,496
Scott: We're a very small company.

76
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:29,720
Scott: They're a very big company.

77
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,200
Scott: We're gonna get in trouble, so we're gonna have to get rid of these stories.

78
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:43,088
Scott: That was a bad move by dig because as anyone could notice within a few hours Every story on dig was the number.

79
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:47,660
Scott: the entire front page was covered with the number and nothing else.

80
00:04:48,242 --> 00:05:00,760
Scott: Whether dig was gonna get destroyed by being sued by Under the DMCA for allowing this number to be posted on their site Was not an issue because dig was now useless because there was no news on the front page.

81
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:02,125
Scott: There was just this number.

82
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:06,200
Rym: well unless you went to any other category where then this number wasn't there and dig was normal?

83
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:08,913
Scott: Yep, but you know no one goes to the I do.

84
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,260
Rym: I don't go to the front page.

85
00:05:10,784 --> 00:05:13,424
Scott: Oh really I go only to the front page But I have it sorted.

86
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:18,134
Scott: so like only some categories appear on the front page and some don't I filter out the categories I don't like.

87
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:20,760
Rym: no I just if I want to know news about a given category I go to it.

88
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,100
Rym: I didn't even notice the stupid front page key business whatever.

89
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:34,375
Scott: Anyway, even if you didn't notice it on the front page on the right side of dig where it says top 10 in all topics It was covering that entire thing was all stories about this key.

90
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:35,620
Rym: I don't know on one head.

91
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:39,420
Rym: I don't think this is really unexpected or particularly important or interesting.

92
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,794
Rym: it's just that's what nerds and geeks do.

93
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:47,584
Rym: if they feel threatened and The way to fight back is something that you can do easily online They'll do it.

94
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:55,299
Rym: so if you have a den of geekery or nerdery like dig Where most people know what this key is and know exactly what's going on?

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,860
Rym: They're definitely gonna just post as much as they can and cause as much trouble for everyone who's trying to hide it as possible.

96
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:05,590
Scott: Yeah, I'm not saying that it was unexpected But I think it shows that.

97
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:14,240
Scott: now look here is a real example Where people's on the internet with the civil disobedience coming on strong and actually getting something done?

98
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:20,360
Scott: And now all the regular news media and everyone is taking notice like oh shits look at those people are doing.

99
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:32,380
Rym: I think the relevant quote someone pointed this out on dig in fact and it was from an old show I used to like called news radio and the quote is basically Trying to take something off the internet is like trying to take pee out of the swimming pool.

100
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,443
Scott: That's a good one.

101
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:37,490
Rym: I mean there's really no way to keep this key.

102
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:47,918
Rym: people already registered domain names that have the key And the key can be incorporated into an ipv6 address straight up.

103
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:51,948
Rym: yeah Yeah, so there's already stickers and t-shirts.

104
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:53,994
Scott: so what dig eventually did?

105
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:55,880
Scott: is they said all right apparently?

106
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,653
Scott: One of the stories involving this key was the most dug up story ever.

107
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:01,055
Scott: I got like.

108
00:07:01,396 --> 00:07:02,078
Scott: I dug it even.

109
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:05,608
Scott: it was like 20,000. it was a ridiculous number of do.

110
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:09,738
Rym: I actually went in and dug every single story that had the key once I figured out What was going on?

111
00:07:10,702 --> 00:07:13,192
Scott: I only dug a few of the biggest ones just because I didn't want to.

112
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:20,198
Scott: some of the lower ones are crappy or linked to Bad stuff, so I didn't want to pump them up, but Eventually dig said all right.

113
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:27,985
Scott: we can't we don't have the manpower to go around deleting all these stories with the key and Apparently use guys.

114
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:37,800
Scott: you users of dig have decided that you would rather see dig fight and die Then censor all these stories, so we're gonna keep them up, and that is what they did.

115
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:47,194
Rym: I don't think it's gonna matter because Regardless of what happens it's there's no way they can see and D And then follow through everyone who's posting this key.

116
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:48,400
Rym: it would cost more.

117
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:54,506
Rym: It would basically cost an infinite amount of money because this key has appeared Everywhere on the internet.

118
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:58,279
Scott: yep, and the question is what they even sue dig at all will even try.

119
00:07:58,299 --> 00:07:59,386
Rym: well They even think about it.

120
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:01,380
Rym: They have many bigger fish to fry right now.

121
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:01,943
Scott: Well the only.

122
00:08:02,103 --> 00:08:18,600
Scott: I think actually there is a possibility that this outright You know the the outrage of the users on dig and the fact that the regular news media took notice of it might attract Attention to dig as one of the sites that disobeyed the C&D whereas other sites disobeying it might not get in trouble.

123
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:22,094
Rym: Well, it wasn't just dig because slashdot had a much more.

124
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:23,760
Rym: I mean slashdot is generally.

125
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:31,280
Rym: I don't want to say people on slashdot are smarter or more erudite or anything like that But it is definitely a different kind of site.

126
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:37,506
Scott: I think just what it is is that the only people who are still on slashdot right all the dumb people have left Slashdot.

127
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:39,827
Scott: so now it's only Some smart people.

128
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:47,820
Rym: actually the other day because I haven't posted in a while But I used to have this game that I played for the longest time and the game was literally how many?

129
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,103
Rym: Plus fives?

130
00:08:49,203 --> 00:08:52,838
Rym: can you get in a row without anything less than that in between?

131
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:53,079
Rym: yeah?

132
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,876
Rym: I once filled my entire slashdot history with plus five.

133
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:56,520
Rym: He's not lying.

134
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,011
Rym: I saw it, and I started up again.

135
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:00,840
Rym: I haven't posted on slashdot in like a year.

136
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:01,704
Rym: So I post.

137
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:04,838
Scott: I've been actually slash dotting a little bit more recently lately.

138
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:07,012
Rym: well I saw a thing about AMD.

139
00:09:07,072 --> 00:09:09,585
Rym: someone was like is Apple gonna buy AMD?

140
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:11,593
Rym: and I was like no that's crazy and stupid.

141
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:12,677
Rym: the fuck's wrong with you.

142
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:13,300
Scott: That's right.

143
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:15,420
Scott: I saw that headline as well.

144
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:23,560
Rym: Yeah I got my plus five and then I remembered that when GeekNights first started a Decent number of you came from slashdot post because my signaling to us.

145
00:09:24,144 --> 00:09:26,177
Rym: So I think I'm gonna start posting my plus fives again.

146
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:30,840
Scott: actually It's like I've always been subscribed to the slashdot RSS feed for as long as it's existed.

147
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:34,580
Scott: You know and that's how I read it ever since RSS existed and was useful.

148
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:45,080
Scott: You know I just look at the headlines and slash dot and if there was an interesting story I'd click on it, and I noticed that in the past few weeks I've been ending up on slashdot more often than I have in weeks prior.

149
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:52,600
Scott: I think the editors at slashdot have gotten smarter And they've realized the kinds of stories that you know people want to read nowadays.

150
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,025
Scott: They're not the kind of stories that they would have read in say 2002.

151
00:09:57,025 --> 00:10:07,300
Rym: at least the formula for making a plus five comment has not changed a Science to get plus five comments the same formula on dig even to get a bunch of thumbs up.

152
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,586
Rym: So it's a different.

153
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:13,960
Rym: like it's a different formula the post that would get you the ups on Slashdot will not get you the ups on dig and vice versa.

154
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:18,300
Scott: I think it will it just it depends a dig has a lot more.

155
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:25,460
Scott: It depends a lot more on the timing of your post and the the noticableness of it based on its formatting and such like that.

156
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:36,171
Rym: Anyway, not to get on a long rant about slashdot dig and all that but the article on slashdot talking about this issue Had no you know it wasn't in the title.

157
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:38,500
Rym: people weren't really posting all over the comments so much.

158
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:40,245
Rym: But there's a tagging data.

159
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:44,778
Rym: You can tag stories and immediately the story was tagged with none other than the key.

160
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:53,159
Scott: I have a feeling this key is gonna become a category on some blogs out there.

161
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:58,360
Rym: Well I noticed someone may or may not have posted it in our forums.

162
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:07,038
Scott: You all know it is our policy to never delete a post ever Yep, and I don't think we're gonna get to cease and desist and if we do that'll be awesome.

163
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:08,860
Scott: if we do I'm gonna do a Cory doctor.

164
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:09,845
Scott: Oh, did you know he did?

165
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:12,560
Rym: did you just post the cease and desist that has the number in it?

166
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,704
Scott: That's exactly what he did.

167
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:17,198
Scott: he took the number off and he put up the cease and desist PDF that had the number in it.

168
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:22,236
Rym: I just we can't get into it cuz it's not that kind of day.

169
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:22,758
Rym: It's Wednesday.

170
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:25,858
Scott: Yep Well, I only said this on Wednesday cuz it had to do with HD DVD.

171
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:34,548
Scott: So a reminder again anyone who thinks about watching anime or anything on DVD because you really need all those HD's to make your animes look better.

172
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:42,740
Scott: I know right, but anyone's thinking about it now You can decrypt that shit and make copies and watch it on whatever doesn't matter anymore.

173
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:58,147
Rym: So many of you may or may not be fans of the right honorable Lord going a guy Going a guy going a guy famous for being the king of various things Cutie honey devil man Messenger a getter Robo.

174
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:00,533
Rym: well at the Napoli comic-con in 2007.

175
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:01,416
Rym: We have Napoli isn't Italy?

176
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:07,194
Rym: Yeah, Wow, you know, wait, wait Naples or I don't know.

177
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:08,157
Rym: I don't know anything about Italy.

178
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:09,020
Rym: I know about old Italy.

179
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,240
Rym: I don't know about modern Italy.

180
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:17,441
Rym: There are however anime cons in countries other than the United States and Japan Unbelievable.

181
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:28,314
Rym: so at this con he had got a very interesting cool interview and Someone has decided to translate it transcribe it and put it on the internet.

182
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:30,300
Rym: It is highly worth a read.

183
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:34,460
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of funny cuz it's like what the interview was conducted in Italian.

184
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:42,229
Scott: So you got the questions translated from Italian and then the answer is translated from the translator Translating from Japanese to Italian.

185
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:46,819
Rym: Well, I think one of my favorite answers He gave is that when they asked what he's working on now?

186
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,660
Rym: He said he's working on four kinds of stories two of which are manga about samurai set in medieval, Japan.

187
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:55,904
Rym: Two of them.

188
00:12:56,286 --> 00:12:59,500
Scott: Wow, I guess the other two must be violent sexy robots, right?

189
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:04,820
Rym: I'm not even gonna comment on what kinds of things going guy might actually be putting into his manga.

190
00:13:06,122 --> 00:13:06,988
Rym: It's a pretty cool interview.

191
00:13:07,008 --> 00:13:08,819
Rym: I'm not gonna go through it much but check it out.

192
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:14,220
Scott: And apparently anime news network says Napoli comic-con, but the actual interview says Naples comic-con.

193
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:34,050
Rym: so last night I was complaining when I do my things the day about how everything worth seeing on the internet is on dig and I generally anything I pick whether it's on dig or not will be on dig by the time we do the show about it.

194
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:40,550
Scott: well I think that was not true last night because dig was just a sea of numbers and nothing interesting.

195
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:48,590
Rym: But I mean in general Most of what is important on the internet to people like us is on dig slash dot FARC and gadget.

196
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:54,403
Rym: There's a list of websites and between them they cover talking 99% of everything we care about.

197
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:58,218
Rym: that is correct But every now and then a little gem slips through the cracks.

198
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,749
Rym: who for whatever reason go to places other than we go on the internet?

199
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:04,519
Scott: Ah, so they're very strange people.

200
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:11,692
Scott: they go to strange places places that we would not even dare to go even if we knew they existed such as 4chan or Deviantart.

201
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:15,929
Scott: well Deviantart's not so bad, but I don't go there live journal myspace etcetera.

202
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:27,369
Rym: So I could describe my thing of the day which last night our friend I do Message me and demanded that it be a thing of the day and was shocked at the fact that I didn't know about it.

203
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,157
Rym: Uh-huh, and I found further investigation.

204
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:33,487
Rym: It was in fact submitted to dig almost a year ago.

205
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:37,690
Rym: Oh But it never got dug up so I never would have seen it.

206
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,189
Scott: That's very strange because this is the kind of thing that would be dug up if people noticed it.

207
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,930
Rym: Yeah, and I saw a lot of knockoffs that are actually pretty bad by different people.

208
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,401
Rym: But this is the original all I can really say about it.

209
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:50,183
Rym: He's coming.

210
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:50,965
Scott: He's coming.

211
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:55,480
Rym: He's coming coming Ways, uh, I'm not even gonna try to quote it.

212
00:14:55,982 --> 00:15:07,912
Rym: suffice to say it is a Rappish kind of video about George Washington that is entirely historically accurate 30 dicks It's.

213
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:11,230
Rym: it's pretty much a straight-up history of George, Washington.

214
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,750
Scott: Yes, all you people from other countries can learn about the father of the United States.

215
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,043
Rym: I mean we used to debate about oh could anyone beat Chuck Norris.

216
00:15:20,424 --> 00:15:23,236
Rym: I think we found the answer George Washington first.

217
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:30,330
Rym: Chuck Norris in George Washington wins, maybe maybe I'm not gonna do it justice if I try to make jokes from it or quote it.

218
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:33,150
Rym: All I can say is one the song is going to be stuck into your head.

219
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:34,298
Rym: You won't think it will.

220
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:35,890
Rym: you'll listen and think yeah, that was funny.

221
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:37,900
Rym: And then the next day you'll be humming it.

222
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:39,005
Scott: watch it two times.

223
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:39,910
Scott: Then it'll be really be stuck.

224
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,040
Rym: It's just it's in my head right now.

225
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,970
Scott: It's in my Washington, Washington.

226
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:48,340
Rym: All right All right, he's coming.

227
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,043
Rym: he's coming.

228
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:57,129
Rym: so I Got something that I saved the children, but not the British children.

229
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:02,559
Scott: so Man, we're gonna be quoting that for a bunch of episodes to come.

230
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,930
Scott: So anyway, I found something that's pretty cool.

231
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:10,808
Scott: You know how people always find like knockoff toys and they're hilarious cuz like lol.

232
00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:11,290
Scott: Look at that.

233
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,330
Scott: It's a dragon ball toy, but the colors are wrong and it says dragoon ball.

234
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:22,669
Scott: Or you'll see like I don't know A ninja turtle and it's like a frog.

235
00:16:22,991 --> 00:16:36,410
Rym: well Emily and I were in Manhattan way back in Chinatown and she found these wooden slipper clog things That had Naruto characters very poorly painted on them in entirely the wrong colors.

236
00:16:38,153 --> 00:16:40,350
Scott: Understand how these people get the colors wrong.

237
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:46,060
Scott: I mean I could get it if you got the shade wrong like oh I use the wrong shade of blue or the wrong shade Of orange.

238
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:48,998
Scott: Yeah, but Yeah, what the fuck is up with?

239
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:52,850
Scott: like the green pikachu's it's like or maybe just not have yellow paint.

240
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:56,704
Rym: Maybe they do that and then they say no, it's the original character.

241
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,090
Rym: See yeah, it's not the same.

242
00:16:58,311 --> 00:16:59,416
Rym: It's not the same.

243
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:02,150
Scott: so this is a knockoff that I found today.

244
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:04,910
Scott: I don't think it's on dig but it is on some gaming blog.

245
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,074
Scott: I think that I found it on.

246
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:09,665
Scott: and what this is apparently in Korea China.

247
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:10,529
Scott: I'm not quite sure.

248
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:12,893
Scott: It's difficult to say.

249
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:21,355
Scott: there is a game a PC game called power Mon plus and it is pretty much a direct Pokemon ripoff.

250
00:17:21,535 --> 00:17:22,739
Scott: like directly.

251
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:25,306
Scott: it's the same font for the logo.

252
00:17:25,707 --> 00:17:27,894
Scott: Pikachu is there It's just Pikachu.

253
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,600
Scott: the jigglypuff is there.

254
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,250
Scott: I see Eevee I see meows I see Oddish.

255
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:34,576
Scott: It's a direct ripoff.

256
00:17:34,616 --> 00:17:39,710
Scott: However, the important thing to note about power Mon is that there are multiple power Mon games.

257
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:42,189
Rym: Wow, it must have made some money.

258
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:47,830
Scott: It's a knockoff franchise that seems to be continuing and able to put out more than one product.

259
00:17:48,692 --> 00:18:05,330
Rym: See while I have somewhat complicated views on some piracy and that sort of thing There's a big difference between copying someone's DVD ones or blatantly outright ripping off an extremely popular and nationally renowned property.

260
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:12,570
Scott: Yeah, I also say that this is not cool, but it is cool to look at the screenshots in this game because they're hilarious.

261
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:17,345
Scott: Oh my god, you got this Pikachu that's like totally demented and has a neck.

262
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:25,950
Scott: Pikachu doesn't have a neck people Alright and he's throwing baseballs and ice cubes and bubbles and his frogs and it's like some side scroll and shit.

263
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:30,064
Scott: And there's a Pikachu with wings flying around like an angel Pikachu.

264
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:30,485
Rym: That's right.

265
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:31,910
Rym: You you don't know shit about Pokemon.

266
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,214
Scott: You know shit about Pokemon.

267
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:39,475
Scott: Oh, yeah, apparently this PC game power Mon plus plus Requires weight plus plus?

268
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:40,097
Scott: I don't know.

269
00:18:40,217 --> 00:18:43,687
Scott: It's it's the word plus followed by the plus symbol requires windows.

270
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:47,750
Rym: That's incorrect That's just yeah, that's not you don't do that?

271
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:53,884
Scott: Yeah Apparently requires a hundred and thirty three megahertz processor 32 megs of RAM Windows XP and it came out in 2001 from ID soft.

272
00:18:56,952 --> 00:19:08,267
Scott: Not only not only did they rip off the gate the license for the property of their game that they made But the name of the company is a ripoff of a company in the US that makes games.

273
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,336
Rym: Wow They still make games.

274
00:19:10,757 --> 00:19:13,328
Scott: I don't ID that like in the US.

275
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:15,616
Scott: Yeah Yeah, they make cell phone games and things.

276
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:17,201
Scott: I think they they.

277
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:21,095
Scott: they got someone else to make quake for yeah I just realized they may.

278
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:23,646
Scott: I think most recently they made the doom cell phone RPG.

279
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:24,690
Rym: I was just thinking about it.

280
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,710
Rym: I realized that they pretty much fell off my radar a long time.

281
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,570
Scott: Well, it's mostly cuz they didn't do anything for a long time and then doom 3 was not so hot.

282
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,689
Rym: Nah, hell actually I didn't even think quake 3 was so hot.

283
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,392
Scott: No me either.

284
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:37,798
Scott: but Carmack is.

285
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:40,930
Scott: he's got good ideas and how to make a lot of money and he's making moves.

286
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:42,699
Scott: So watch it watch out.

287
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,930
Scott: He's gonna cut pull something out of the Hat any year now.

288
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:49,855
Rym: So now that Washington's out of the way, yeah Washington all right.

289
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:54,488
Scott: last week we talked to you about four new anime from the new anime season.

290
00:19:54,508 --> 00:19:59,547
Scott: in this week We have four more new anime from the new anime season.

291
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:03,569
Scott: actually one of them I think is from last year something again.

292
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:09,930
Scott: It doesn't matter when they're from there for very recent anime that you probably have not seen or heard of.

293
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:17,389
Scott: And we are going to tell you based on one episode of watching what we think some of them might be.

294
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:21,822
Rym: okay I'm actually considering watching more of at least one of these shows.

295
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:22,224
Rym: Yep.

296
00:20:22,745 --> 00:20:25,213
Rym: See if you can guess which one I'll give you a hint.

297
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:27,442
Rym: It's not the last one.

298
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:27,864
Rym: We're gonna.

299
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:29,209
Scott: yeah, we'll do that one last.

300
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:31,056
Rym: actually I kind of have an idea to watch.

301
00:20:31,177 --> 00:20:40,070
Scott: all of that if there's ever says there's 11 episodes It's all you okay, so the first show we will talk about is Romeo X Juliet.

302
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:43,800
Scott: It is a TV show based on yes, Romeo and Juliet.

303
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,849
Scott: Well, well, yeah, and it is a gonzo show.

304
00:20:47,069 --> 00:21:00,349
Rym: All right Well you say based on and as far as I can see The level of based on this is that the main characters names are Romeo and Juliet and there is a character named Benvolio and there are Capulets and Montagues.

305
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:02,274
Scott: and There's a guy.

306
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:06,369
Scott: there's a character William Shakespeare in the story, but they call him wheelie.

307
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,723
Scott: Yeah wheelie and that's about it.

308
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:11,994
Scott: Everything else is just Fantasy.

309
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:14,106
Scott: now this flying horses and shit.

310
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:14,810
Scott: It's out of control.

311
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:19,190
Rym: It's actually really well animated and pretty cool from the way it began.

312
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,823
Rym: So the opening song it borders on the cheesy just a little bit.

313
00:21:22,843 --> 00:21:24,830
Scott: Yeah, I think it is cheesy.

314
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:31,783
Rym: The show is very much symphonic rock music playing at all times very whimsical very Oh, it's a light-hearted fantasy.

315
00:21:31,843 --> 00:21:37,370
Rym: Look people draw swords But no one's dying except when there's major plot things going on and a whole bunch of people are dying.

316
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:39,709
Rym: But you can tell when those things are gonna happen or not?

317
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:44,230
Scott: Yeah, and we haven't even seen any of those things happen because you only watched one episode now.

318
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,367
Rym: It begins with the Capulet family in their floating castle.

319
00:21:48,407 --> 00:22:01,034
Scott: in the sky being it seems like there's a whole town like a whole city or the whole world is on a floating rock and there's big And there's nothing else.

320
00:22:01,214 --> 00:22:10,170
Rym: so the patriarch of the family is being murdered by the Montagues or systematically killing Everyone in the castle in order to ensure that the bloodline is destroyed.

321
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:23,999
Scott: yeah, basically the Montagues are genociding the Capulets and then you know even after and that's in the past and even when they're Done with that in the present time of the show They're still running around looking for Capulets to genocide.

322
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:34,410
Rym: because you see it turns out that someone awesome saves a young girl named Juliet Ah, really and some other girl and then they grow up a little bit, but she has to hide her identity.

323
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:39,190
Rym: They have to hide the fact that she's a Capulet because there's a death warrant out on anyone with Capulet blood.

324
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:43,444
Rym: In fact, they execute people who they suspect of having Capulet.

325
00:22:43,464 --> 00:22:45,470
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like a witch hunt for Capulets.

326
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:54,859
Scott: of course in the real Romeo and Juliet, it was sort of a Hatfield and McCoy kind of deal and not so much a Jew and Nazi kind of deal.

327
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:55,080
Scott: Yeah.

328
00:22:55,783 --> 00:23:03,330
Rym: Now the thing is if it weren't Nominally based on Romeo and Juliet if it were just a show that had some other theme it'd be okay.

329
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,755
Rym: It's a pretty good show so far.

330
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:06,260
Rym: It's not a great show.

331
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,825
Scott: It's it's definitely an average show.

332
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:09,210
Rym: I mean little above average.

333
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,861
Scott: I think it's got some fun fantasy.

334
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:12,170
Scott: It's got some good animation.

335
00:23:12,753 --> 00:23:14,261
Scott: Some of the character designs are cool.

336
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:15,889
Scott: Some of the character designs are not cool.

337
00:23:16,572 --> 00:23:19,344
Scott: voice acting is pretty average, but I think I'd like.

338
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:22,944
Rym: I Think the story it's there is pretty interesting.

339
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:23,790
Rym: I like the setting.

340
00:23:23,953 --> 00:23:24,769
Rym: I like all that.

341
00:23:25,392 --> 00:23:48,570
Rym: What I don't like is that one they pull some kind of your tennis shenanigans where the main character s you know Juliet Dresses up as a boy and Furthermore dresses up as the red whirlwind who's basically the Scarlet Pimper now going around saving people and all this time She has short hair and looks like a boy, but whenever she puts down a dress out of nowhere these long flowing locks appear.

342
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:55,950
Scott: Yeah, I could understand if she was hiding the hair like in down the back of her shirt or something like that But you can clearly see she's not hiding the hair.

343
00:23:56,011 --> 00:24:00,718
Scott: She's got hair that is cut short And then it magically elongates.

344
00:24:00,878 --> 00:24:03,405
Scott: and now I can buy the flying horses.

345
00:24:03,606 --> 00:24:04,809
Scott: right just because.

346
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:07,039
Scott: well There are some biological flying horses.

347
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,370
Rym: I kind of like them just because they're different from what you would expect.

348
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:15,124
Scott: They're really shaggy and lanky yeah But there isn't any magic in the show as far as I've seen.

349
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:16,810
Rym: so you can't in the floating castle.

350
00:24:17,312 --> 00:24:21,810
Scott: Oh, yeah, but I mean if you're gonna pull this hair appearing out of nowhere.

351
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:25,410
Scott: You better show me some other magic somewhere else, or I'm not gonna buy it.

352
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:28,247
Rym: I think it's pretty safe to say that there's more magic in this show.

353
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:30,176
Scott: yeah But it's like all right.

354
00:24:30,216 --> 00:24:34,596
Scott: so far the only magic is hair out of nowhere uh-huh.

355
00:24:35,972 --> 00:24:48,490
Rym: So I guess the end result here is that the show is called Romeo and Juliet as far as I can tell For no reason other than to call it Romeo and Juliet, and it's so loosely based on it that it's almost laughable.

356
00:24:48,811 --> 00:24:49,816
Rym: Yeah, however.

357
00:24:49,836 --> 00:24:56,538
Rym: I see a potential for a pretty good show because Spoilers for Romeo and Juliet they both die.

358
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:02,349
Scott: yeah, if they end this and they don't die That's kind of silly.

359
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:18,470
Scott: But but if they do and the show is set up as it is if it keeps going in its current direction And that current direction somehow ends with them both dying That's pretty crazy because that means that the in-between has to exist which is a place where a good show lives.

360
00:25:18,871 --> 00:25:26,410
Rym: Yes, just if they have the guts to end this as a tragedy the way it should be Then this show is probably gonna be worth watching.

361
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,488
Rym: However, if it does not end that way the show is probably not worth watching.

362
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:33,210
Scott: well It's gonzo, so you never know what they could do.

363
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:35,915
Rym: Damn you gonzo.

364
00:25:36,055 --> 00:25:37,059
Scott: Damn you all right.

365
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:43,669
Scott: the next show I want to talk about is sort of this Happy silly show that we watched called rocket girls.

366
00:25:44,911 --> 00:26:02,140
Scott: Basically the premise of this show is you have a space program a Japanese space program that's on some island out in the middle of nowhere and They're trying to send rockets into space But they suck like they had a rocket that could go pretty high and it worked But it wasn't powerful enough to really get into space.

367
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:02,641
Rym: Yep.

368
00:26:02,722 --> 00:26:02,842
Rym: No.

369
00:26:02,902 --> 00:26:04,548
Rym: It's a silly group of scientists.

370
00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:06,355
Rym: It's not Generally very.

371
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:10,030
Scott: it's one of those sort of character groups where you know sort of like the tank police.

372
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,240
Scott: So there's one of everybody or pat labore where there's one of.

373
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,103
Scott: you know, this is the.

374
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:19,319
Scott: this is this character in this character In this character, it's one of those goofy camaraderie shows.

375
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:31,811
Scott: Yep, which we really like usually I do usually like those and You know now they're trying to develop a more powerful rocket that can actually get to space but it's hella unreliable and it explodes and it sucks and It's.

376
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:40,014
Scott: it's pretty funny watching them like bet on whether the Rockets gonna make it and watching the island the native islanders like going Hooray a fireworks show.

377
00:26:40,114 --> 00:26:40,656
Scott: Hooray.

378
00:26:40,676 --> 00:26:41,519
Scott: I don't.

379
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:53,842
Rym: I think the best part about the show is there's all these interactions between the scientists people I mean, there's the main character girl, but whatever about her Yeah I'll talk about her in a second and The one scientist girl who runs the whole like science program thing.

380
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,770
Rym: there is always testing and doing experiments on the astronaut.

381
00:26:57,111 --> 00:27:02,910
Rym: Yeah, there's one astronaut and the astronauts this really cool guy and she basically tortures him constantly.

382
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:08,730
Scott: Yeah, he was in like, you know the Centrifuge the centrifuge simulator thing.

383
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:13,806
Scott: He was in the centrifuge and she turned it up too high and he's like.

384
00:27:13,907 --> 00:27:18,882
Rym: I saw you You know like with your gleeful smile and she's like damn.

385
00:27:18,922 --> 00:27:21,390
Rym: I should have expected a fighter jet pilot to pick that out.

386
00:27:21,771 --> 00:27:30,190
Rym: Yeah, yeah, and there's a lot of fun animosity there, but then they start to realize that alright We got to use the smaller rocket, whatever.

387
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:36,430
Scott: Yeah, they had to use the smaller rocket because the big rocket is unreliable And if they don't get into space by the end of the year they lose their funding.

388
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:40,749
Rym: So the best part of the whole first episode happens when they decide this.

389
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,849
Scott: Yeah, so the the guy who's in charge decides All right If we're we're gonna do this.

390
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:54,290
Scott: The only hope is to use the old rocket that we know works But isn't strong enough and somehow reduce the amount of weight we put into space so that we can still make it.

391
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,966
Rym: So he turns to the scientist woman and says so how much weight do you think our astronaut can lose?

392
00:27:59,247 --> 00:28:08,259
Rym: and she has their evil grin and looks at him and The best part of the episode she pretty much backs up like oh no Oh no, and he runs out of the room.

393
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:08,800
Rym: anything.

394
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:19,690
Rym: All right, and this evolves into a rather Extended scene that involves him not just running away, but stealing an armored car Crashing through the gates and trying to get off the island.

395
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:25,430
Scott: Okay Now he's driving this very armored Humvee very quickly away from the space base, right?

396
00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:35,330
Scott: They chase him with a helicopter and they shoot missiles at him like a fully armed Anti-tank helicopter comes after him and is shooting him with rockets and missiles.

397
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,681
Rym: And the thing is he'd rather die than stop that car.

398
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:38,444
Rym: So he keeps going.

399
00:28:38,826 --> 00:28:39,650
Scott: He just keeps going.

400
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:43,518
Scott: It's pretty hilarious now But the show is actually about that's sort of.

401
00:28:43,578 --> 00:28:47,630
Scott: the main deal is that this is girl and she's a girl who lost her father.

402
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,484
Scott: I think her father must have been a space research.

403
00:28:49,504 --> 00:28:52,650
Rym: Oh, it doesn't matter It's the flimsiest excuse for a plot ever.

404
00:28:53,072 --> 00:28:56,690
Rym: They wanted to make a show about little girls who are also astronauts.

405
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:14,150
Scott: Yep So the girl ends up on the island and while that guy that the astronaut is running away this girl ends up Getting into his armored car and in the end they say they they catch the you know Astronaut guy and the girl is with him and the head of the space program goes, huh?

406
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:16,969
Scott: How much do you think that little girl weighs?

407
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,710
Scott: dumb dumb dumb.

408
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:21,430
Rym: It's such a flimsy premise.

409
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,675
Scott: It's so flimsy.

410
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:32,913
Rym: and the best part is there's two other girls that you can obviously Tell just from the way they're animated and the fact that the camera focuses on them that they are going to be the other two Rocket girls.

411
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:34,678
Rym: There's the native girl who's cute.

412
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:38,050
Rym: And then there's the Chinese restaurant girl who's obviously cute.

413
00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:41,142
Scott: Yep, three cute girls going into space.

414
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:45,238
Scott: funny space program camaraderie Comedy whatever.

415
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:52,669
Scott: it's a light-hearted Silly not very deep show with some comedy and probably some cute girl fanservice.

416
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:55,300
Scott: That's pretty much all there is to it.

417
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,346
Scott: It's just one of those.

418
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:56,910
Rym: It's alright.

419
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,270
Rym: I don't regret that I watched the first episode.

420
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:04,716
Rym: I could see myself watching the rest of it someday when I've gone through all of my cue But I really have no interest in watching.

421
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:10,310
Scott: Yeah, I mean if I really need a cheap, you know Sort of like some giggles I would watch this show.

422
00:30:10,932 --> 00:30:19,037
Scott: I would actually recommend this show highly to say an anime club because if you watch it at an anime club It would pretty much make everyone go.

423
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,100
Rym: Yes.

424
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:23,110
Rym: This is definitely one of those benefits from a crowd shows.

425
00:30:23,391 --> 00:30:31,129
Scott: It's not something you would actually watch seriously But if you have a giant auditorium full of anime fans turn this on and everyone will laugh their heads off.

426
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,475
Rym: So moving on cuz.

427
00:30:33,495 --> 00:30:34,239
Rym: I want to get to this show.

428
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:36,870
Rym: This is probably actually the best show in the lot.

429
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:41,130
Rym: Well best in terms of goodness not best in terms of most memorable.

430
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:49,228
Scott: Yes, now the show is darker than black and it's sort of a supernatural fight not so much fighting but action show.

431
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:55,610
Scott: and The first thing I want to tell you about in this show is the opening song because I learned something from this opening song.

432
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:56,649
Rym: What did you learn?

433
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,484
Scott: Well, first of all, let's talk about the music in general before we talk about anything else.

434
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,833
Scott: The music is by yoko kana Of course.

435
00:31:03,114 --> 00:31:03,716
Scott: Whoo-hoo.

436
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:06,306
Scott: That's awesome because yoko kana rules, right?

437
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:07,510
Rym: But you know what?

438
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:15,224
Rym: I just realized that despite having done GeekNights for however many 300 something episodes I don't think any of our listeners know about yoko kana in a box.

439
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:16,410
Scott: No, probably not.

440
00:31:16,731 --> 00:31:19,139
Scott: Anyway, anyway, the music is by yoko kana.

441
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:25,479
Scott: The opening song is by a band called Abingdon boys school a bi?

442
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,543
Scott: ng don.

443
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,430
Rym: now I'll say that I really like the opening song.

444
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:36,947
Scott: It's a really good opening song, but it sounded so familiar and I was like Sounds like either TMR or lark on CL, but I can't tell it was.

445
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:42,864
Scott: you know I can hear a j-rock and a lot of j-rock sounds similar, but this is a really familiar j-rock.

446
00:31:42,925 --> 00:31:50,905
Scott: Well lo and behold The front man for this band Abingdon boys school is Takanori Nishikawa.

447
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:52,750
Scott: Who's the TMR guy?

448
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:56,524
Scott: Apparently he's not doing the TMR anymore.

449
00:31:56,545 --> 00:31:57,229
Scott: now he's doing this.

450
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:03,056
Scott: I also found out that the band is named after Of course the Abingdon school.

451
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:09,170
Scott: the Abingdon school is the all-male school where the British rock band radio head was established.

452
00:32:09,692 --> 00:32:11,239
Scott: So that's kind of weird.

453
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,988
Scott: That's like if I named my band like strawberry fields.

454
00:32:16,872 --> 00:32:18,637
Rym: It's not a bad name for a band actually.

455
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:21,125
Scott: Yeah, but you're totally like if you're.

456
00:32:21,285 --> 00:32:27,710
Rym: if you're a Beatles cover band, that's okay But otherwise no no, in fact, I think if you're a Beatles cover band you have less of a right to do that.

457
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,565
Rym: You gotta be like some weird off-center punk noise band have a name like that.

458
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:33,187
Scott: That's no good.

459
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:38,141
Scott: Anyway, yeah so you got a show already without knowing anything else about the show.

460
00:32:38,462 --> 00:32:46,464
Rym: that is yoko kano music and also has Awesome j-rock opener and the show definitely has high production values really well animated.

461
00:32:46,885 --> 00:32:48,630
Rym: the character designs are pretty solid.

462
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:57,136
Rym: Actually like all the characters we've seen so far they remind me quite a bit of the characters from licensed by royal one guy.

463
00:32:57,196 --> 00:32:59,507
Scott: does the other people sort of remind me of?

464
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,898
Rym: What do they remind you of?

465
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:04,350
Scott: I don't know sort of like something in between.

466
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:08,210
Rym: There's a little bit of read or die there - yes a little bit of read or die.

467
00:33:08,892 --> 00:33:11,201
Scott: One character looks like Roy Mustang with a mask.

468
00:33:11,663 --> 00:33:12,466
Rym: I like that mask.

469
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:13,610
Rym: It's like that Sailor Moon mask.

470
00:33:13,771 --> 00:33:18,128
Scott: It is a cool mask and I don't know it's sort of it's.

471
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:18,891
Scott: it's cool.

472
00:33:19,052 --> 00:33:19,977
Rym: either way I can't.

473
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:36,869
Rym: we're not gonna talk about the plot of the show because part of the problem is that this show does a very good thing in one way and that it has a very interesting setting and they explain a lot of the setting to you pretty much right away because there's a lot to get out of the Way and they seem to really want to get to the meat of the show very quickly.

474
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,957
Rym: Yeah, unlike a lot of crap anime.

475
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:41,045
Rym: They don't do it in the slipshod way.

476
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:41,748
Rym: You might expect.

477
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:47,020
Scott: Yeah Basically, some of it is stereotypical Like there was an incident in the past.

478
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:50,307
Scott: that's mysterious and you don't learn about it Even though everyone else knows about.

479
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:57,256
Rym: yes And now the city is surrounded by this wall and the sky is fake and there's the truth is on the other side of the wall But no one can get out.

480
00:33:57,437 --> 00:33:58,624
Scott: No one knows it's out there.

481
00:33:58,664 --> 00:33:59,570
Scott: There's something out there.

482
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:05,012
Rym: I like how they show that though how you look at the sky and then you realize that half of it looks like it's painted The wrong color.

483
00:34:05,032 --> 00:34:05,814
Rym: Yeah.

484
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:06,115
Scott: Yep.

485
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:14,020
Scott: Yep, and they make some you know metaphors and they're trying to be meaningful because there's one character who looks through Telescope and they're like, hey all the stars are fake.

486
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,425
Scott: Why are you looking at that telescope?

487
00:34:16,268 --> 00:34:19,849
Scott: And it's like He's looking at a telescope with the fake sky.

488
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:27,431
Rym: The coolest thing about this show so far is that there are these two groups of people who seem to have powers Contractors.

489
00:34:27,754 --> 00:34:30,407
Rym: there are a lot of jokes not getting into that and dolls.

490
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:33,001
Rym: Yep Now there's all typical anime kind of names like.

491
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:36,739
Rym: we're gonna call them things like this But it actually means something.

492
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,589
Scott: the contractors are really cool.

493
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:43,010
Scott: Yeah, they're people who have powers and do jobs and fulfill contracts.

494
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:49,730
Scott: But whenever they fulfill a contract like they don't say this outright, but you just see it with a show They have to do something.

495
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:57,849
Rym: I think it's more that they make a deal in order to get a power and in return for getting the power They have to pay a price after the fact.

496
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:04,310
Rym: It's not that they're on contract to do something really it's that they paid the price of having this contract.

497
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:15,110
Rym: It's like selling your soul to the devil and then the devil gives it back to you after you I don't know break your ring finger or stack a bunch of pebbles in a specific intricate pattern on a table.

498
00:35:15,394 --> 00:35:19,221
Scott: yeah, and Then you have these other people with powers who are dolls.

499
00:35:19,302 --> 00:35:19,543
Scott: which are?

500
00:35:19,663 --> 00:35:28,484
Scott: they describe them as mediums You know like psychic mediums like the girl in Phoenix Wright or whatever, you know They channel powers from somewhere else or something.

501
00:35:28,524 --> 00:35:39,750
Scott: It's they don't really explain it very well but they they're dolls and they're mediums and they're the other group of people with powers and of course there are people with no powers and They're sort of tied up fighting over.

502
00:35:39,892 --> 00:35:40,649
Scott: You don't know what.

503
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:47,210
Rym: The show at least for the first episode has some pretty good action scenes and it starts pretty much right off with all the business.

504
00:35:47,591 --> 00:35:49,399
Scott: Yeah, I mean they just get right to it.

505
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:54,057
Scott: There's like a new guy comes to town and right away He's involved in some craziness.

506
00:35:54,097 --> 00:35:59,919
Scott: Like you see this guy come to town and he has sort of like this Crazy old landlord lady who's a.

507
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:02,970
Rym: oh, yeah, the main character is actually just some like high school punk kid.

508
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:04,441
Scott: Yeah, he's some high school punk kid.

509
00:36:04,502 --> 00:36:05,570
Scott: He comes in from another.

510
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:06,953
Scott: Oh, right.

511
00:36:07,294 --> 00:36:08,136
Scott: That's kind of weird.

512
00:36:08,176 --> 00:36:09,861
Scott: Like they were like, huh?

513
00:36:10,423 --> 00:36:11,346
Scott: I just realized something.

514
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:12,710
Scott: the guy's kind of foreign, right?

515
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,354
Scott: Maybe he's he's mr.

516
00:36:14,434 --> 00:36:15,818
Scott: Lee and he's something right?

517
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:19,468
Scott: He's foreign, but he came to a city with a wall around it.

518
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:20,290
Scott: Huh?

519
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,394
Scott: That's interesting.

520
00:36:21,795 --> 00:36:22,197
Scott: I don't know.

521
00:36:22,398 --> 00:36:23,723
Scott: is the whole is there like other?

522
00:36:23,743 --> 00:36:25,410
Scott: how big is this wall?

523
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,255
Scott: How big an area does it surround?

524
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:29,944
Rym: Well, the first episode doesn't reveal much of that.

525
00:36:29,985 --> 00:36:40,590
Rym: It just kind of reveals the basic setup Yeah, but it's also Starts out with two totally different threads that come together by the end of the first episode and that's the direction The show is obviously going to go in from that forward.

526
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,210
Scott: I liked how when he first showed up at his apartment, you know, they introduced the funny landlord lady.

527
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,810
Scott: But then they're like, oh he has the mysterious female neighbor, right?

528
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:55,250
Scott: Then they immediately show you why the female neighbor is mysterious and they immediately bump into each other instead of holding that off.

529
00:36:55,471 --> 00:36:56,134
Scott: So, you know like huh?

530
00:36:56,154 --> 00:36:58,746
Scott: I wonder about her and then you should bring her back.

531
00:36:58,786 --> 00:37:00,495
Scott: in the third episode You forget who she was.

532
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:02,505
Scott: This is mysterious female neighbor.

533
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:03,389
Scott: There she is.

534
00:37:03,953 --> 00:37:05,023
Scott: This is why she was mysterious.

535
00:37:05,044 --> 00:37:05,629
Scott: the end, you know.

536
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,741
Scott: And that way you didn't forget about her when they finally brought her into the plot.

537
00:37:08,781 --> 00:37:16,429
Rym: like happens quite often in many shows the show Starts out dark gets light-hearted for a little bit and then gets dark again and then gets really dark.

538
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:19,900
Scott: Yeah, the characters I like best in the show are actually the police.

539
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:23,010
Scott: I guess they're the police or the FBI or equivalent.

540
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:24,189
Rym: It doesn't really matter.

541
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:41,910
Scott: It doesn't really matter the law enforcement Agency and you know some of the characters in this law enforcement agency are stereotypical But they're pretty funny and some of them are really cool and the one girl who seems to be smart and the police is pretty Cool, and she's always like right up in the business and on top of everything which is not so typical.

542
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:47,309
Scott: Usually police are bumbling or falling way behind or something like or have tanks or have tanks.

543
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:49,719
Rym: Yes I think this show is worth watching.

544
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:53,173
Rym: I'm definitely gonna check out at least a few more episodes Episodes.

545
00:37:53,193 --> 00:37:53,959
Scott: you just got to watch him.

546
00:37:54,201 --> 00:37:55,270
Rym: So I'm feeling it.

547
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:58,890
Rym: I'm feeling it more with this than I have with just about any other show that's come out recently.

548
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:14,354
Scott: Yeah, it definitely has the potential to be quite awesome and to have some cool Action, and maybe if the plot goes in interesting places If actually I'd say it's the second most the show that I like the most because that bokurano with the with the robot I'm really liking that.

549
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:17,468
Rym: I really like bokurano - and I've only seen one episode.

550
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:24,075
Rym: Yep Emily's seen more and all she has said is that it's very sad Very sad.

551
00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:26,990
Scott: Oh, maybe this will be my cool action show and that'll be my said.

552
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:34,607
Rym: Balance out, but if you want a cool action show probably the best action show to come out in a long time Is this last one?

553
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:40,262
Rym: government crime Investigation agent Zai Zen Joe Taro.

554
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:40,984
Scott: Oh god.

555
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:41,506
Scott: Okay.

556
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:43,010
Rym: You want to say in Japanese?

557
00:38:43,851 --> 00:38:44,834
Scott: I'm gonna try.

558
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:50,670
Rym: I kaku kenryoku hansa kyosei tori shimari kansai Zen Joe Taro.

559
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:52,619
Rym: Yeah, it's just the sea kanji.

560
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,909
Scott: It's it's the show with the long name.

561
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:56,593
Scott: now This show.

562
00:38:56,733 --> 00:39:02,354
Scott: you probably haven't heard of it because the name is long and no one can even tell you the show exists because the name Is so long.

563
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:07,950
Rym: Well, we were going to tell you about this show But I think I'm gonna have to take a quote from upside.

564
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:13,010
Rym: I used to link to a lot and I just kind of forgot about so recently but bossy gossy bakahatsu anime blog.

565
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:16,110
Rym: They tend to review anime pretty well.

566
00:39:16,191 --> 00:39:18,758
Scott: Yeah there it's a really good anime review site and they get.

567
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:27,630
Scott: they always get lots of screenshots from the anime they review and sometimes videos and It's actually I'd say it might be the best anime reviews on the net.

568
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:31,770
Rym: I only stopped linking to him because their server was slow as shit, but they seem to have fixed that.

569
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,212
Scott: That's good.

570
00:39:32,232 --> 00:39:36,130
Rym: And of course their tagline is because sometimes buses explode.

571
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:41,769
Rym: Yeah, so what they had to say about this anime is the following not gonna say the name again.

572
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:46,950
Rym: Zazen Jotaro's claim to fame is that it's quote that one anime with a freaking long name.

573
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:55,190
Rym: I haven't seen anyone write about this anime and I wondered why it Became pretty apparent after watching about one minute of the anime.

574
00:39:55,832 --> 00:40:09,449
Scott: all right now Zazen Jotaro if you are someone out there who is entertained by Go Go 13 Then you will be entertained by at least one episode of Zazen Jotaro.

575
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:12,998
Scott: now Zazen Jotaro, he's no Duke Toga.

576
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:16,487
Scott: No, but he's just about as close as you can get.

577
00:40:16,507 --> 00:40:27,340
Scott: he's pretty much If you'd replace the fucking and the killing of Duke Togo with saying da bomb with saying da bomb Da bomb and spending money.

578
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,070
Scott: You've got size and shorter.

579
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:42,170
Rym: all right Zazen Jotaro is probably the manliest man in all of anime and I say this because This is a man who when he has to steer his car, I'd Scott say you're a normal person you want to steer your car.

580
00:40:42,531 --> 00:40:43,294
Scott: What do you do?

581
00:40:43,515 --> 00:40:44,418
Scott: I turn the wheel.

582
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:47,610
Rym: Well, uh, that's not good enough for Zazen Jotaro.

583
00:40:48,052 --> 00:40:56,464
Rym: You see when a badass a manly badass wants to steer his car He shoots the goddamn steering wheel and does that work.

584
00:40:56,725 --> 00:40:58,290
Rym: that works perfectly?

585
00:40:59,511 --> 00:41:00,997
Rym: That's what this show is.

586
00:41:01,017 --> 00:41:04,330
Rym: The thing is I don't think it's a parody.

587
00:41:04,892 --> 00:41:06,801
Rym: I don't think they're making fun of anything.

588
00:41:07,183 --> 00:41:08,750
Rym: I think it's actually straight up.

589
00:41:09,072 --> 00:41:11,629
Scott: I think it is straight up which is kind of weird.

590
00:41:11,851 --> 00:41:16,670
Rym: So it starts with a fighter jet and a bunch of people in a control tower at an airport.

591
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:19,335
Rym: Yeah And they're like who could that be?

592
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:29,113
Rym: because this fighter jets coming and then Zazen who is flying this fighter jet has hacked the radar Screen terminal in the control tower to say hey It's me.

593
00:41:29,536 --> 00:41:33,878
Rym: and then post a stupid picture of himself Stabbing his fingers and being all awesome.

594
00:41:34,379 --> 00:41:37,430
Rym: He then ejects from the plane and parachutes to the airport.

595
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:40,590
Scott: Basically, there's a guy named Zazen Jotaro.

596
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:52,678
Scott: He's supposedly been dead for a few years But really he is awesome and alive and his current occupation is like government crime Investigation agent.

597
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:54,789
Rym: it's hard to say what his job is.

598
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:04,057
Scott: It's a government crime investigation agent, but you see he has his credit card designers gold card And he has basically infinite money.

599
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:06,503
Scott: That's his superpower is infinite money.

600
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,850
Rym: Yeah, Batman has biological webs.

601
00:42:09,552 --> 00:42:11,959
Scott: Superman Batman has biological webs.

602
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:12,741
Rym: No, not that man.

603
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:13,684
Rym: I guess I meant spider-man.

604
00:42:13,884 --> 00:42:15,589
Scott: spider-man's webs aren't biological.

605
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,252
Rym: Yes They are.

606
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,276
Scott: he invented them.

607
00:42:17,417 --> 00:42:18,401
Rym: No, that's BS.

608
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:19,907
Rym: I like the ones from the movie.

609
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:20,590
Scott: You're stupid.

610
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,397
Scott: anyway Zazen Jotaro has infinite money.

611
00:42:25,698 --> 00:42:29,610
Scott: He also has the power of the Zayner's Club credit card.

612
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:36,110
Scott: He also has the other superpower of make the Navy SEALs appear whenever he wants.

613
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:41,150
Rym: Oh my god, that's probably the point at which you realize just exactly what this show.

614
00:42:41,213 --> 00:42:44,361
Scott: No I realized exactly what the show is about 30 seconds in.

615
00:42:44,602 --> 00:42:50,149
Scott: well soon as he jumps out of the plane and says Dabam there's the scene when he gets attacked by those three Friars.

616
00:42:51,212 --> 00:42:52,781
Scott: that's just random and stupid.

617
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:59,349
Rym: that scene or perhaps the Stupidest method of trying to assassinate someone ever where they have the four trucks box him in.

618
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,662
Scott: Yeah, he's driving down the highway in his awesome sports car.

619
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:11,450
Scott: four tractor trailers box him in He takes his gun and he shoots at the four corners of the roof of his sports car without looking without looking.

620
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:15,922
Scott: He just kind of you know reaches behind himself while always looking forward at the road and driving.

621
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:18,670
Scott: then he ducks his head down low.

622
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:27,169
Scott: So he's looking at the girl, you know, his head is below the you know The door of the car and he drives right under one of the trucks and the roof of the car gets ripped off.

623
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:32,190
Scott: Meanwhile, the trucks go off a cliff and he stops on the edge of the road and he's like, oh, yeah.

624
00:43:32,551 --> 00:43:35,686
Rym: So in the last bit now keep in mind that there's absolutely no story.

625
00:43:35,887 --> 00:43:39,847
Rym: No, no, no It is literally just seen seen seen seen.

626
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:43,478
Scott: It's basically watch Zazen Jotaro be a badass.

627
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:46,044
Scott: watch Zazen Jotaro be an even crazier.

628
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:48,370
Scott: badass watch him be an even crazier.

629
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:53,851
Rym: So eventually this Japanese government, whatever Yakuza really you don't know what he is He's.

630
00:43:54,072 --> 00:43:55,998
Scott: he calls himself an elite of Japan.

631
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:00,975
Rym: So he corners eyes and he's got a bunch of guys with guns and he's like, ah You'll be abandoned.

632
00:44:01,236 --> 00:44:04,590
Rym: the Japanese government would never abandon me because I'm a member of the elite.

633
00:44:05,212 --> 00:44:06,176
Rym: They won't abandon me like.

634
00:44:06,196 --> 00:44:07,963
Rym: they abandoned people like you you commoner.

635
00:44:07,983 --> 00:44:15,730
Rym: and then just then One of the guys cronies gets a phone call and then the guys like we're not protecting you anymore.

636
00:44:16,151 --> 00:44:19,541
Rym: The Japanese government called you're no longer a member of the elite.

637
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:22,510
Rym: They've abandoned you and Zazen's like see what I mean.

638
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,680
Rym: Haha, I'm Zazen Jotaro.

639
00:44:25,223 --> 00:44:26,610
Rym: So the guy goes nuts and pulls a gun.

640
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,253
Rym: It's like oh well I'm gonna shoot size that.

641
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:40,310
Rym: and then in what is perhaps the second worst moment in the history of animation The Navy SEALs as far as I can tell all of them Swing around the top of the roof of this building.

642
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:51,436
Scott: Well, if they appear the same way bad guys appear in Hogan's Alley like whoop and then from behind the Navy SEALs appear the most poorly drawn Helicopters I have ever seen.

643
00:44:51,597 --> 00:44:53,363
Scott: I could draw a better helicopter.

644
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:57,519
Scott: the helicopter and chop lifter for the Atari 2600 looks better than that helicopter.

645
00:44:57,539 --> 00:44:58,222
Rym: I think you mean for the 7800.

646
00:44:58,222 --> 00:45:02,821
Scott: It doesn't matter the 2600 helicopter looks better.

647
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:08,404
Rym: bossy gossy bakahatsu has a Really good screenshot of just how bad these helicopters.

648
00:45:08,444 --> 00:45:09,288
Scott: Oh, do they really?

649
00:45:09,448 --> 00:45:16,650
Rym: Yes Man they're so poorly done Like they would be okay in a show like Lupin.

650
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:23,228
Rym: Yeah, I guess they're okay here too because this is perhaps one of the worst things I've ever watched.

651
00:45:23,248 --> 00:45:24,050
Scott: There's the helicopters.

652
00:45:24,393 --> 00:45:26,369
Scott: Oh my god, they're so poorly drawn.

653
00:45:27,112 --> 00:45:30,902
Scott: But yeah thing with this show is that everything is poorly drawn.

654
00:45:31,022 --> 00:45:39,270
Rym: Everything is poorly animated character designs are inconsistent The animation is shoddy inconsistent poor bad shitty.

655
00:45:39,932 --> 00:45:41,940
Scott: There's no music to be heard.

656
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,358
Rym: that the voice acting is da bomb Blah blah blah zai ten so Jotaro.

657
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,569
Rym: Oh blah blah blah zai zai and whatever credit card.

658
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:51,848
Rym: Zayna's Club.

659
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,859
Scott: Blah-blah-blah gun blah blah blah elite blah blah blah.

660
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:57,443
Rym: the camera angles don't make sense.

661
00:45:57,503 --> 00:45:58,546
Rym: The proportions are off.

662
00:45:58,867 --> 00:46:02,426
Rym: they use overlays constantly and stupidly.

663
00:46:03,275 --> 00:46:04,770
Scott: Pretty much everything in the show.

664
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:12,839
Scott: Yeah, there was the part where like all the guns appear from like all sides of the screen except the top part of the screen And then they waggle and then they wiggle her out.

665
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:15,509
Scott: There's like two or three scenes that are like that.

666
00:46:16,395 --> 00:46:22,250
Scott: Now I thought the animation was bad, you know And I realized the encoding of the show that we watched was a bad encoding.

667
00:46:22,651 --> 00:46:28,168
Scott: So and the screenshots of the show on Basu Basu got to like whatever are much better.

668
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:35,505
Scott: Let's say it Basu Basu Baku Hatsu Yes, are much better than looking than the video that we watch.

669
00:46:35,525 --> 00:46:38,410
Rym: Well, I think part of the regardless They're still terrible.

670
00:46:38,732 --> 00:46:40,849
Rym: You see you look at these screenshots and you think all right.

671
00:46:41,393 --> 00:46:44,050
Rym: The show looks actually pretty well drawn compared to a lot of anime.

672
00:46:44,391 --> 00:46:47,703
Rym: The thing is all those screenshots don't really actually move.

673
00:46:48,145 --> 00:46:49,570
Scott: Yeah, I think that's another part of it.

674
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:51,738
Scott: Is that the animation is really terrible?

675
00:46:51,798 --> 00:46:57,276
Scott: So even though an individual frame might look okay I mean none of them look great, but they'll look okay.

676
00:46:57,857 --> 00:47:03,233
Scott: any two frames in sequence will be all terrible and it's just God It's.

677
00:47:03,374 --> 00:47:07,152
Scott: it's worse than like some college student animation projects I've seen now.

678
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:12,829
Rym: if I ran an anime club still I would probably show this on April Fool's Day.

679
00:47:14,033 --> 00:47:21,148
Scott: Probably This is a show that no one's heard of and it's definitely falls into the category of so bad.

680
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:24,260
Scott: It's good However, however be warned.

681
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:27,050
Scott: This is basically the limit of so bad.

682
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:30,462
Scott: It's good it if it gets any more bad.

683
00:47:30,482 --> 00:47:31,867
Scott: It's not good anymore.

684
00:47:31,927 --> 00:47:32,670
Scott: It's just bad.

685
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:35,664
Scott: In fact, it's so bad that it's only good once.

686
00:47:35,704 --> 00:47:40,870
Scott: if you watch it twice It'll just be so bad the second time around because it skips through.

687
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:44,282
Rym: I mean, it's well beyond the just kind of mediocre and it is outright bad.

688
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:49,910
Rym: Yeah, but when he says to bomb It's just so says the bomb.

689
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,847
Scott: You gotta play him saying to bomb in the show.

690
00:47:52,867 --> 00:47:54,535
Rym: now I'll just let them watch this video.

691
00:47:54,555 --> 00:47:56,662
Rym: cuz without the video you don't get the full effect.

692
00:47:56,963 --> 00:48:07,646
Rym: cuz literally it zooms in on him and he looks at the camera and he says Duh bomb and then snaps his fingers and points him as you're like, hey, I'm so cool.

693
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,781
Rym: You're not so cool I'm Zazan Jotaro.

694
00:48:11,043 --> 00:48:11,968
Rym: You can die in a fire.

695
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:18,189
Rym: Look at me in my credit card and my fancy sports car that I shoots shoots more than once.

696
00:48:19,012 --> 00:48:30,320
Scott: Yeah, it's so weird because you know some of the best shows and manga out there are basically stories of incredible Manly badasses that do all sorts of badass things.

697
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:36,030
Scott: However, there's a point at which you become so badass That you just become comedic.

698
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,872
Scott: There's nothing.

699
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:47,244
Scott: there's really no difference between this and say gogo 13 or crying Freeman or sanctuary Except that this takes the badassness to a much higher level.

700
00:48:47,444 --> 00:48:53,369
Scott: they purposefully make scenes Where Zazan Jotaro can do things that are more badass than any?

701
00:48:53,810 --> 00:49:00,150
Scott: Anime or manga character has ever been before and that makes it silly when really it's the same exact thing.

702
00:49:00,591 --> 00:49:02,658
Scott: It's just more badass and therefore humorous.

703
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,562
Rym: See the thing is though.

704
00:49:03,943 --> 00:49:07,298
Rym: It's so poorly animated I really can't.

705
00:49:08,102 --> 00:49:09,330
Scott: it is bad in every way.

706
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,460
Rym: I still would rather watch Hokuto no Ken than this.

707
00:49:12,781 --> 00:49:13,323
Scott: I agree.

708
00:49:13,363 --> 00:49:15,510
Scott: I would much rather watch Hokuto no Ken than this.

709
00:49:15,771 --> 00:49:16,438
Scott: I mean, it's so good.

710
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:21,430
Scott: No, no Ken is Is entertaining and ironic fashion.

711
00:49:21,832 --> 00:49:25,830
Scott: This is entertaining just because you look at how bad it is and you go.

712
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:28,618
Scott: I can't believe someone made a show this bad.

713
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:29,441
Rym: Oh my god.

714
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:31,989
Rym: I really feel bad for whoever did this show.

715
00:49:32,853 --> 00:49:36,070
Rym: This is this is I said it's based on a manga.

716
00:49:36,231 --> 00:49:39,001
Scott: I'm kind of curious to see what the VON manga looks like.

717
00:49:39,121 --> 00:49:44,770
Rym: see there's a chance that the manga is okay And this is just an adaptation, but I can't see that hat.

718
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:47,350
Scott: I'm pretty sure this is a direct adaptation for the manga.

719
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:51,004
Rym: This does have a lot of the tropes of those geeky guy kind of manga.

720
00:49:51,024 --> 00:49:57,929
Rym: We like it's not a geeky guy No, it's you know, but it has a lot of the things in it that you would expect to see in a sanctuary.

721
00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:02,450
Rym: Yep Yep, but they're just so dumb and poorly executed.

722
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:10,866
Scott: Because basically what it does is it gets rid of all those Political talking scenes and those you know, why is someone doing this scene?

723
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:19,066
Scott: and it gets rid of the plot surrounding the action and it just has Incredibly badass action scene incredibly badass action scene one after the other.

724
00:50:19,086 --> 00:50:21,314
Scott: yeah on stop I mean nothing in between.

725
00:50:21,334 --> 00:50:25,650
Rym: look sanctuary has some awesome action scenes and this is a manga I'm talking about.

726
00:50:26,071 --> 00:50:33,042
Rym: But the most in the most climactic moments and the most tense moments in that entire manga Were when someone just said something.

727
00:50:33,344 --> 00:50:38,649
Scott: Yeah, and then everyone said You could watch this show with no sound and would be the same.

728
00:50:40,272 --> 00:50:42,529
Rym: They're pretty much just saying his name over and over again.

729
00:50:43,152 --> 00:50:48,675
Scott: You only have to listen to the parts where he says duh, but you can watch that on the link So it doesn't even matter.

730
00:50:48,856 --> 00:50:51,828
Scott: Yeah, so I don't recommend you actually watch this show.

731
00:50:51,888 --> 00:50:54,565
Scott: if you do I recommend you watch only one episode.

732
00:50:54,605 --> 00:51:02,770
Rym: for the sake of humor I recommend that everyone watch this first episode because this will inoculate you to all sorts of bad anime out there.

733
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:03,252
Rym: Perhaps

734
00:51:03,434 --> 00:51:18,730
Scott: and I do recommend everyone whether you like anime or not Go to the link for that We are putting up on the site at front recruit calm and in the middle of that page of vasugasu bakuhatsu calm You will find a video of him saying to bomb and you should watch that.

735
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:23,290
Scott: It's like 30 seconds of your life and it's worth it because that tells you everything you need to know about the show.

736
00:51:23,652 --> 00:51:30,625
Rym: See while he's such a badass in the context of the show I don't think you could take out either Chuck Norris or George Washington.

737
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:31,890
Scott: No, I don't think so.

738
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:34,639
Rym: Okay, Scott's watching him say to bomb again.

739
