1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,089
Rym: It's Wednesday, June 13th.

2
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:13,172
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:15,880
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:22,420
Rym: Tonight we talk about one of our favorite manga Eagle making of an Asian American presidents.

5
00:00:24,343 --> 00:00:25,378
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,604 --> 00:00:36,650
Rym: You know it's kind of scary, but I'm feeling slightly more and more like a semi-legitimate journalist the longer we do this.

7
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,594
Scott: What do you mean legitimate?

8
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:49,866
Rym: well as in you know long ago before we were internet famous if I had any sort of Problem or difficulty or anything with anyone out there in the world other than asking them.

9
00:00:49,886 --> 00:00:50,970
Rym: You know hey, what's up?

10
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:55,875
Rym: I really had no recourse, and I just had to let things go Now.

11
00:00:55,915 --> 00:01:08,050
Rym: last week we went on a little bit of a rant about the difficulties We've had talking to Otakon and within an hour of uploading the show More than one staffer emailed us and answered most of our concerns.

12
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:10,742
Scott: Why didn't they do that before?

13
00:01:10,762 --> 00:01:18,209
Rym: I don't know they're having some trouble But it looks like everything's back in order and a lot of the things that hadn't been announced yet will be announced shortly.

14
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:21,227
Scott: actually Yeah, it's still definitely too late.

15
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,373
Scott: I mean it.

16
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:34,789
Scott: I mean it's not too late like oh no the con is doomed too late but is definitely you know beyond the deadline of Announcing who's got what panels and when and that kind of business see.

17
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,270
Scott: luckily It's really you know this stuff like four months in advance.

18
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:39,277
Rym: Luckily normal people do.

19
00:01:39,598 --> 00:01:45,319
Rym: we don't because we have pretty much a loadout of ten or so panels We can do pretty much on 24 hours notice.

20
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:50,436
Scott: Yeah, it still kind of sucks though and Hopefully it will not happen again.

21
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:52,263
Scott: Yeah, well it looks like any con.

22
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:53,848
Rym: It looks like everything's going okay.

23
00:01:53,869 --> 00:02:02,858
Rym: so far though I did very specifically now And I think to the right people offer to have myself and Scott and the rest of our crew Handle the panels for Otakon next year.

24
00:02:02,898 --> 00:02:05,790
Rym: We'll see if they follow up on that because they haven't answered me yet.

25
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:08,138
Scott: Yeah, the thing is if they let us do it.

26
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:16,385
Scott: It'll be a question of are they going to say Here's what you have to do do exactly this or do the panels the way you want?

27
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:22,318
Scott: because if they just let us do the Panels the way we want it'll be awesome, but if they make us do with the Otakon way It won't be as awesome.

28
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:23,650
Rym: I don't know what you mean by the Otakon way.

29
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,843
Rym: It seems like every panels person handles it differently.

30
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:28,909
Rym: the only real Concern is that you have to deal with.

31
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:32,143
Rym: You have to put in all the industry and the guest panels and all those things.

32
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:33,569
Rym: then you fit the fan panels around that.

33
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:36,650
Rym: other Than that you can pretty much I'd assume pick wherever you want.

34
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,375
Scott: Yeah, it just you know.

35
00:02:38,777 --> 00:02:43,010
Scott: it seems like Otakon is a convention at least from my perspective.

36
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:53,847
Scott: That is a lot more group decision-making whereas some other cons are sort of Delegating the decision-making and then people can do as they wish with the power granted to them.

37
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:54,750
Rym: see I don't know.

38
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,388
Rym: Yeah, I did get the impression that the panel's person was at least somewhat independent in years past.

39
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:04,050
Rym: yeah Yeah, but but at least in the very least we can't really reveal anything.

40
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,703
Rym: But remember one of the questions we had was so what's the musical act?

41
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:09,850
Rym: why has no to can't say anything about the musical act?

42
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:13,609
Rym: I really want to know because the musical act is often the highlight of the con.

43
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:25,663
Rym: for me I just that's the kind of thing I really love and We can't really say who partly because we don't really know, but it looks like from a confirmed source They're going to have two musical acts this year.

44
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:38,648
Rym: They had two musical acts last year Yeah, but they're gonna have two again this year and from what they say it looks like it's something that not everyone is probably going To expect but the words I expect it to be quite lovely are in here.

45
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:41,235
Rym: I'm really excited.

46
00:03:41,276 --> 00:03:44,369
Scott: I gotta say I don't know I don't I don't know.

47
00:03:45,134 --> 00:03:47,910
Scott: We'll have to see what it is before I can say whether I'm happy about it or not.

48
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:48,712
Scott: I don't just.

49
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:51,441
Scott: I can't get excited about these mystery things anymore.

50
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:54,370
Scott: There's a good rant someone had recently on a blog.

51
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,549
Scott: They were like stop with the fucking countdowns.

52
00:03:57,031 --> 00:04:03,750
Scott: You know people go out, and they're like they make a website like coming soon this thing and then they'll have a timer.

53
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:05,117
Scott: You know what that says.

54
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,710
Scott: all you're saying is this thing is going to happen.

55
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:09,701
Scott: You're not giving out any information at all.

56
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:11,270
Scott: you're basically saying nothing.

57
00:04:12,273 --> 00:04:16,165
Scott: Either say something or get off the freaking soapbox, but that's a basic PR.

58
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:17,890
Rym: I mean say you're running for I don't know.

59
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,834
Rym: It's relevant tonight.

60
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:21,565
Rym: president of the United States right now.

61
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:29,829
Rym: if you just one day Announce I'm running for president you get a big press brouhaha, and then that's it and you disappear from the limelight.

62
00:04:30,732 --> 00:04:45,090
Rym: But if you follow the elections and the primaries and everything you'll notice that most candidates first They'll announce their intention to put together an exploratory committee to consider the possibility of being president.

63
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:51,428
Rym: Then they'll announce that the explore the exploratory committee is going to be created a week from X day.

64
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:53,836
Rym: Then they announce it was created.

65
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:55,582
Rym: then they announce it's working.

66
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:58,150
Rym: then they announce that they're going to make an announcement.

67
00:04:58,612 --> 00:04:59,775
Rym: Then that announcement.

68
00:04:59,796 --> 00:05:02,745
Rym: they usually announced that they've decided whether or not they're going to run.

69
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:08,859
Rym: then they announce the day They're going to say if they're gonna run or not and then Eventually they might say they're going to run.

70
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:19,090
Scott: some of them haven't really said it yet this this time around see But you can still maintain that you know build up of slowly releasing information and having many announcements.

71
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:23,049
Scott: But I mean you could still do that.

72
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:27,630
Scott: But actually say something each time like let's say I'm putting out a video game, right?

73
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:32,430
Scott: I can come out like a year before the game is gonna be released and say I'm going to make this game.

74
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:35,950
Scott: Then the next week I could say the game is going to be in this genre.

75
00:05:36,513 --> 00:05:49,130
Scott: And then the next week I can say the game is going to be on these systems and I won't have some stupid countdown where I just say nothing and Waste everyone's time and attention and you know such with nothing.

76
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:56,990
Scott: But I can still by withholding information saying things fewer things over a period of time get the same PR effect.

77
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:59,920
Scott: But not be annoying with a stupid.

78
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:01,064
Scott: it's a clock.

79
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:02,850
Scott: yeah, I have a clock in my house.

80
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,512
Scott: Thank you very much.

81
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:06,181
Scott: get away that there's better news for me to read.

82
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:09,774
Rym: see well like take the example of Smash Brothers the new Game coming out on the way.

83
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:16,901
Rym: if I were Nintendo how I would have done this countdown is n Weeks before the game is going to be released or maybe n days.

84
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:19,470
Rym: it depends probably weeks as long as I get the schedule down.

85
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:25,330
Rym: And being the number of characters in the game exactly I would have revealed one character.

86
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:30,490
Scott: I would have done maps before that I would have done maps and then characters.

87
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,125
Rym: You know that really what you should do is just go pixels.

88
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:42,830
Scott: ah Have this big Screenshot and each day one pixel of the screenshot appears one random one.

89
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:45,699
Rym: Yeah Or actually I'd make it a dynamic ajaxi.

90
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:55,204
Rym: real-time like every minute a pixel appears And it's just a big image, and then once one picture is done Another picture starts up, and you keep the archive all the old pictures.

91
00:06:55,224 --> 00:06:56,570
Rym: you got to do something clever like that.

92
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:59,218
Scott: Yeah, something that actually gives information.

93
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:00,983
Scott: I don't care if you're withholding information.

94
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:06,162
Scott: I don't care if you're releasing information Artificially slowly for marketing purposes.

95
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:07,407
Scott: that's expected.

96
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,110
Scott: It's sort of necessary.

97
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,378
Scott: Just don't make an announcement.

98
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:11,980
Scott: That's nothing.

99
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,723
Scott: don't make these.

100
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:14,850
Scott: announcement that you're going to make an announcement.

101
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:16,054
Scott: Don't do that.

102
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:17,679
Scott: don't say nothing.

103
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,133
Scott: say at least something so that I didn't waste my time Reading whatever.

104
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:23,237
Scott: the thing you just said is.

105
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:24,421
Scott: that's all I ask.

106
00:07:24,783 --> 00:07:26,830
Scott: you know when you say something make it worthwhile.

107
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:29,790
Rym: But in the very least to reign this back over to Otakon.

108
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:42,350
Rym: Ever since our little rant we talked to some people at Otakon and for all of you who are wondering there It is very very likely that we are going to be doing a decent number of panels and shows at Otakon.

109
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:46,566
Rym: We obviously we don't know for sure yet, but it looks pretty good.

110
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:52,235
Scott: Yeah, so for anyone out there Let's let's do a quick rundown here On Let's see hold on.

111
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:53,361
Rym: I gotta fill up the calendar.

112
00:07:53,402 --> 00:08:02,030
Scott: Yes on June 23rd we are most likely going to be at the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art Arts Festival.

113
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:05,363
Scott: We are not going to be doing anything there except attending.

114
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:06,749
Scott: the same way you will be attending.

115
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:07,814
Scott: Yes Oh, we're not.

116
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:14,001
Scott: we're really basically going to be incognito though if enough of you're not incognito We're just walking around from table to table going.

117
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:14,765
Scott: OMG.

118
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:15,609
Scott: You make that comic.

119
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:16,759
Scott: OMG You make that comic.

120
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,729
Scott: OMG your comic is well.

121
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:27,370
Rym: I just realized that if we were webcomic artists we could probably get away with that because just walking around No one's gonna recognize us unless we put our pictures online or go to cons a lot, but we're podcasters.

122
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:33,547
Rym: It wouldn't be too hard to find us at a con because we're usually doing exactly what we're doing right now just in person.

123
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:43,549
Scott: Yes Then in July, I'm not gonna bother saying the dates But we're going to Connecticut where we will be doing God some stupid number of shows.

124
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:47,790
Scott: We're gonna get to Connecticut late Friday night But we will remain there for the entirety of the con.

125
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:57,450
Rym: Basically if you want to see us do live shows Connecticut's where you want to be because we're doing most of the events we've gotten put together for this entire year at Connecticut.

126
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,210
Scott: Yep, then we're going to anime next but I don't know how much we're going to anime next because as far as I know We're not doing anything.

127
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:14,396
Rym: We complain about Otakon partly because we care a lot about Otakon and while I like anime next I'd never gone to it until Last year and it wasn't really big on my radar But I respect it as a con.

128
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,350
Rym: at least Otakon got back with us at all.

129
00:09:17,872 --> 00:09:18,734
Scott: Yeah, anime next.

130
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:19,818
Scott: just didn't anime.

131
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:24,970
Rym: next just ignored all my emails and eventually I just said alright fine screw it I'm not doing shows for you.

132
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:35,030
Scott: If I go to anime next I'll probably pick one day of the con probably the Saturday or the Sunday and go Just that day probably because that is a day that'll have events that I'm interested in.

133
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,060
Rym: Yeah, well we did that last year with Katsu.

134
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:38,830
Rym: We just kind of wandered around and had fun for the day.

135
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,500
Scott: Yeah, yeah, we'll probably.

136
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,075
Scott: it'll probably be more fun this year Even if it is the.

137
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:47,374
Scott: even if they ran the exact same con this year as they did last year I think it'd be more fun.

138
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:50,023
Scott: Just because it'll have things like pokemons and such like that.

139
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:50,946
Rym: Ah pokemons.

140
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:52,010
Rym: I better finish training.

141
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:53,636
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

142
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:55,082
Scott: No, I'm not even gonna bother her.

143
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:57,290
Scott: It's not yeah, but then Otakon.

144
00:09:57,551 --> 00:10:07,793
Rym: Well, once we know exactly what we're doing at the con, we'll keep you guys appraised Yeah, and then in December the New York anime festival in the city where we're doing So.

145
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:09,178
Rym: we're kind of doing the game shows.

146
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:12,870
Rym: we're doing a ConnectiCon but bigger faster and more intense.

147
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:16,630
Scott: Yeah, we don't know yet either a hundred percent, but we know that we're doing them.

148
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,869
Rym: We just don't know how would the size of the venue will be doing them in?

149
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:29,367
Rym: Because part of that hinges on how well the new event goes at ConnectiCon where they're graciously allowing us to beta tested and then In February next year Katsu.

150
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:40,169
Rym: Oh, man I gotta say I can't tell you what's going on at Katsu con next year other than that The staff of Katsucon is already putting a lot of thought and effort into what's going on at Katsucon next year.

151
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:52,400
Scott: Katsucon went from a con that I know that's you know over there in DC and I know about it And I heard good things about but never bothered with - oh That's the con.

152
00:10:52,541 --> 00:11:01,039
Rym: suffice to say There is an event that we are nominally planning that may or may not involve anime world order Despite the fact that we have not told them.

153
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,568
Scott: We'll see if they actually show up.

154
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:08,150
Rym: Yeah Less - yeah, or no, I think Daryl was at the one - ago you met him.

155
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:16,778
Rym: Yeah, that's what I was in a drunken stupor and I met him while he was interviewing people and I was like I'm a podcaster - yeah Well, we can't plan an event with them.

156
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:17,400
Scott: They don't show.

157
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:17,922
Scott: Yeah.

158
00:11:18,103 --> 00:11:21,256
Rym: Well, the thing is we haven't even talked to them yet So they're Gerald's fucking me.

159
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:21,738
Rym: listen to this.

160
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:23,586
Rym: be like what we're doing at Katsucon.

161
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:24,550
Rym: Ah shit.

162
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:34,090
Rym: But yeah, if this event which I think is going to go through goes through Saturday night at Katsucon is gonna be one fucking thing a fucking thing.

163
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:37,241
Rym: It's something I actually proposed to Otakon and kinetic.

164
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:46,886
Rym: on ConnectiCon it was too late to put it together Otakon It's too late for us to put it together So I rescinded it, but I think we can have it together by February and I think it's gonna be pretty hot.

165
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,467
Scott: Yeah.

166
00:11:48,209 --> 00:12:01,046
Rym: All right In the news Otakon they just announced that one of the guests is going to be Mario Asaka the Chobits director and a bunch of other stuff.

167
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:04,120
Rym: Nana Go look at the anime news network.

168
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,005
Rym: There's a crazy list.

169
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:09,223
Rym: as always They get the big name awesome guest and probably fun to see the panel.

170
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:12,590
Scott: Yeah, I don't know I'm not too excited about the guest.

171
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:19,356
Scott: I mean, I like Nana and I like some of the shows that this person is direct a mermaid scar Card capture Sakura.

172
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,002
Rym: Oh god gunslinger girls.

173
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:21,564
Scott: Yeah.

174
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:22,567
Rym: Oh god.

175
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:28,773
Rym: Yeah So it's like probably a cool monster Storyboarded monster.

176
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,957
Rym: Yeah, but that still matters.

177
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:38,670
Scott: Yeah, I think while I like some of those works a great deal I don't really don't know how interesting it's gonna be to see this person and most likely I'll won't go see them.

178
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,839
Rym: Wow, you're just the cynical convoy tonight.

179
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:42,626
Scott: Well, I think about yeah last Otakon.

180
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,254
Scott: I didn't see Anybody last year.

181
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:49,270
Rym: Yeah, honestly, the only reason I didn't go to many events know to come last year was I was too busy.

182
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:52,530
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's like the con is entertaining enough.

183
00:12:53,312 --> 00:13:03,788
Scott: You know with the music acts and the alleys and the dealers and the us doing stuff that I don't really need to go See like the industry panel with the guests like this.

184
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:08,190
Scott: Well for you other people out there who are not me This is awesome.

185
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:14,231
Scott: If you especially if you like these shows you can go meet the person who is probably the biggest part in making them and learn Something.

186
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:16,555
Rym: well, typically I like these sorts of things.

187
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:17,317
Rym: When is the show?

188
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:17,878
Rym: I like that.

189
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:24,907
Rym: I actually have a question about Sadly the director some of the directors I would really like to Touch in some way.

190
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:28,520
Rym: I don't come to the US so often or at least don't come near me.

191
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:29,404
Rym: They're all.

192
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:31,154
Rym: they're all hang out in the west coast at those cons.

193
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:36,930
Scott: We don't go to All right, so check this out, I don't know.

194
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,912
Scott: did we talk about this?

195
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:40,660
Scott: or to just every other podcast talk about the nymph et manga?

196
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:46,220
Rym: Actually, I don't know if it came up, but I totally forgot or didn't know or didn't talk about this.

197
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:47,204
Rym: No idea what it was.

198
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,087
Scott: Okay to sum it up.

199
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:50,898
Scott: There's a manga that's basically about.

200
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:56,760
Scott: I guess It's about like an eight-year-old girl who sexually harasses her like 30 year old teacher and it's just a pedophile manga.

201
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:58,105
Scott: It doesn't have any it's.

202
00:13:58,246 --> 00:14:01,720
Scott: it's not like some things that have fanservice like ghost in the shell.

203
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,240
Scott: Yeah has fanservice and nakedness and lesbians, but it's not a perverted manga.

204
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:09,120
Scott: It's mostly you know a sci-fi kind of thing.

205
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,388
Rym: So I'll give it one out because I have.

206
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:12,452
Rym: no I don't know anything about it.

207
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:14,540
Rym: Is it Lolita?

208
00:14:14,962 --> 00:14:16,651
Rym: Is it art or is it just porn?

209
00:14:16,852 --> 00:14:18,299
Scott: It's just poor God.

210
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:22,193
Scott: Nymph et is does no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

211
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:24,440
Scott: So you ready to appeal to pedophiles?

212
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,198
Scott: No, but that's what I hear from every possible person Knows anything about it and every place on the internet says that.

213
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:35,697
Rym: okay So what you just said is some guy on the internet told me watch all we know.

214
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:36,500
Rym: This is Hamlet.

215
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,347
Scott: No, it's not.

216
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:45,956
Scott: No, it's pretty much the worst thing ever and Basically They're gonna make an anime of it this summer, right?

217
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:48,902
Scott: Oh god No way it gets worse than that It could.

218
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:53,700
Scott: you didn't think it could be worse than making an anime of a pedophile manga with no redeeming.

219
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,219
Rym: Well, I can't imagine his license for release in the u.s No.

220
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:59,750
Scott: No Well, actually the manga that's that was the news.

221
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,200
Scott: was that last week or a couple weeks ago.

222
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,925
Scott: Is that the company putting out in the

223
00:15:04,046 --> 00:15:04,407
Scott: u.s.?

224
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:06,674
Scott: Is you know facing some trouble and whatever?

225
00:15:06,814 --> 00:15:08,138
Scott: Oh, I wonder why.

226
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,406
Scott: anyway Here's the worst news ready.

227
00:15:11,229 --> 00:15:22,678
Scott: one of the episodes in the anime that they've made is unerible for Reasons unsaid but easily implied probably full of naked little girls and pedophile.

228
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:24,064
Scott: in this I'm guessing What about you?

229
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:24,889
Rym: I don't know.

230
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,269
Rym: I'd assume that it has a Grand Moff Tarkin doing something.

231
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:37,000
Scott: Okay, I mean obviously They're going to take this unerible Episode and which I don't yet to be a sick person to make something like that in the first place.

232
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:37,542
Rym: So what are they?

233
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:37,723
Rym: gonna?

234
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:41,280
Rym: take a boat and just row it out there and then broadcast it back to Japan illegally?

235
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:51,857
Scott: Nope, they're going to put it on a DVD and if you buy the fourth volume of the manga You're going to get this DVD with the unerible episode.

236
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:52,399
Scott: Wow.

237
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:58,919
Rym: So basically if you buy all the manga you get the child porn surprise at the end.

238
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:10,680
Scott: Yeah Now see, um I don't want people to be confused here because a lot of people seem to be confused about this position that we have When it comes to things like this, you know, I'm not pro censorship.

239
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:18,639
Scott: I think people have the freedom of speech and freedom of press and freedom of art expression and they should be able to make this sort of thing if they want to.

240
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:30,534
Scott: Yeah, read this sort of thing if they want to and I will never advocate, you know the government preventing anyone from reading purchasing or you know Erring any of these sorts of things.

241
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:39,913
Rym: however, well The only line I have when it comes to art is if the creation of the art is Demonstrably harmful Limitations you put on free speech.

242
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:44,960
Rym: Yeah I mean if if power word kill worked that word would be banned.

243
00:16:45,331 --> 00:16:55,063
Scott: Yeah I mean if there was some magical spell a Video in which someone says the magical spell and that summons a demon I would not allow that video to be distributed because that would Bring many demons into the.

244
00:16:55,264 --> 00:17:01,220
Rym: of course, you know the world that video would be on YouTube more than any other video regardless.

245
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:08,992
Scott: Regardless my opinion is that if you are someone who makes reads well, I guess if you read it, you're not necessarily.

246
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:15,874
Scott: but if you enjoy or Gain entertainment from this sort of work in any way.

247
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:20,477
Scott: You are a sick disgusting worthless.

248
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:25,817
Scott: This disgusting human very bad.

249
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,751
Scott: I would have No qualms about killing you.

250
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:31,886
Scott: in fact, I would think you were so That it's okay to kill you.

251
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:34,416
Rym: I thought you I thought try gun made you a pacifist.

252
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:34,978
Rym: What's the turnaround?

253
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,526
Scott: They're not a human.

254
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,300
Scott: if you're like this, you're not human.

255
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,803
Scott: I can kill.

256
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:43,107
Rym: that's dangerous talk because that I don't want to spoil anything But I don't think it's.

257
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:45,476
Scott: it's dangerous talk to see someone who likes nymph.

258
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:46,340
Scott: it is not human.

259
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:54,408
Rym: I was just gonna go so far as to say that they're pretty creepy and I probably wouldn't want to engage in Conversation or share a bus stop with them.

260
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,637
Scott: If you don't want to be hyperbolic then yeah.

261
00:17:56,657 --> 00:18:10,700
Scott: Well, yeah But if I don't want to be hyperbolic Regardless if you like an infant you're a sicko and I don't want to talk to you I don't even like see you don't don't tell me that you like it because you're sick.

262
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:14,471
Rym: I'm just waiting for the first post in the forums.

263
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:14,994
Rym: I read it.

264
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:16,060
Rym: Oh my god.

265
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:23,692
Scott: Well, it seemed like I could understand if you just read it like cuz if someone read it out of curiosity to find out Like what the hell was going on?

266
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:29,700
Rym: I could understand that It's kind of like watching MD Geist or Odean despite being told not to exactly exactly.

267
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,740
Scott: Well, it's the matter of if you read it and then you read volume 2 or if you read it.

268
00:18:34,962 --> 00:18:35,891
Scott: I was it you think.

269
00:18:35,972 --> 00:18:38,245
Scott: oh that looks interesting I think I think now.

270
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:48,940
Rym: now to paraphrase the words that were spoken by the official Giving the wedding we went to the previous weekend with great power comes great responsibility.

271
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,491
Rym: Now You're all out there and you're all listening to this and you now know the name of this.

272
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:57,619
Rym: this work and I. the word work Is definitely in quotes?

273
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:03,415
Rym: We all know that our favorite anime podcast out there is anime world order.

274
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:07,351
Scott: they review anime and Manga, they know all about this nymph ed thing.

275
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:09,120
Scott: Well, I've been talking about it as well.

276
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,578
Rym: Perhaps they need some sort of campaign to get them to review it.

277
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:14,787
Scott: Just send them a bunch of copies.

278
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:17,175
Scott: that way at least perverts won't be able to buy it.

279
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:18,320
Scott: It'll be in good hands.

280
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:21,260
Scott: I mean sure the company that prints it will get money.

281
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:24,800
Scott: But they already got the money because they sold it to the store.

282
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:26,429
Scott: You see they don't get paid when you buy it.

283
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:28,259
Scott: they get paid when the store buys it.

284
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:32,096
Rym: But now you're not punishing the store for buying it.

285
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:39,538
Rym: That's true But even so in fact, if anything all you're doing is all you're doing is punishing Daryl Surratt for existing.

286
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:40,220
Scott: That's fine.

287
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:51,780
Scott: Then you're actually, you know doing it for a good cut Things of the day.

288
00:19:52,423 --> 00:20:02,000
Rym: so there's been a lot of talk in the anime world recently about a Concept or an art style or genre or whatever you want to make it out to be called super flat.

289
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:10,206
Rym: Uh-huh, and it seems like every person I run afoul of on the internet has a different idea of what super flat is Or what super flat means.

290
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:11,956
Scott: it seems to be one of those things.

291
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:12,238
Scott: where?

292
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,234
Scott: People some people seem to know it when they see it, but there isn't

293
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:17,460
Rym: a much like pornography

294
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:27,160
Scott: yes, but there isn't a strict definition like this is what super flat is and this is what it not is and People have a hard time if you say hey, what's super flat?

295
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,954
Scott: No one could just say what it is in simple terms there.

296
00:20:30,014 --> 00:20:33,300
Scott: It's always kind of vague Like is it a style of animation?

297
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:38,555
Scott: Is it a you know, I don't know some new art wave movement.

298
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:39,980
Scott: What exactly is it?

299
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,364
Scott: Nobody can really say.

300
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:50,780
Rym: well, I can say what it is now because it is I'm pretty well I can say by showing because I know when I see it partly because it's called super flat.

301
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:57,340
Rym: Aha, hi everyone there you go and a lot of people seem to link to this as kind of iconic of super flat.

302
00:20:57,701 --> 00:20:59,990
Rym: But then again, that's just what the internet says.

303
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,752
Rym: What does it know?

304
00:21:00,772 --> 00:21:02,760
Scott: it knows everything duh?

305
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:26,159
Rym: It was actually Emily who showed me this and it's really really cool Regardless of super flat if you care or not watch this video Which I guess is meant to sell Louis Vuitton goods But kind of gives me the impression that if you run afoul of these goods you will be eaten by a psychedelic monster and sent to a fantasy land where monsters will steal your cell phone.

306
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:31,476
Scott: and Yeah, so five thousand dollar handbags only exist in anime world.

307
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:32,700
Rym: I'm not sure.

308
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:34,287
Rym: Just watch it.

309
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:41,259
Rym: I I'm not sure how to explain it other than that it's really pretty and it's kind of weird and it's really well done.

310
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,694
Rym: and It's about all I can say about it.

311
00:21:44,714 --> 00:21:51,724
Scott: All right well, I think it's time for yet another thing of the day from the wonderful world of Japanese television.

312
00:21:51,945 --> 00:22:04,819
Rym: Oh Japanese television that has given us such wonderful shows as guy trying to pee gets Lofted out of the urinal or guy trying to pee gets shot down a mountain on a sled or guy trying to pee gets pulled Out to sea by a boat.

313
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:13,060
Scott: well Japanese television the infinite font of things of the day has provided one more thing for us to laugh at.

314
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:15,871
Scott: Basically, what they done is they set up a challenge.

315
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:23,160
Scott: the challenge consists of a giant I want to say treadmill, but it's more like a big conveyor belt like, you know those things at airports.

316
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:26,795
Rym: Yeah that when no one's looking I run down as fast as I can.

317
00:22:27,117 --> 00:22:28,985
Scott: I'd run down as fast I can when people are looking.

318
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,840
Scott: well, usually when people have them at casinos, huh?

319
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:34,105
Rym: They didn't have them at the casino.

320
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:34,547
Rym: we went to.

321
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,454
Scott: yeah, they did where remember we used it?

322
00:22:37,076 --> 00:22:40,080
Scott: no, it was there I don't remember it at all in a little tiny hallway.

323
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,481
Scott: You know what?

324
00:22:40,622 --> 00:22:43,491
Rym: My memory is too clouded by all the money I want.

325
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:44,654
Scott: that much money.

326
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:49,509
Rym: compared to how much money I came with I'm doubled my money and then you spent it at the bookstore.

327
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,696
Rym: No, no, I didn't spend that money.

328
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:52,800
Rym: the bookstore spent other money.

329
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:54,089
Scott: Yeah that money.

330
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:54,613
Scott: I'm sure.

331
00:22:54,633 --> 00:23:06,253
Scott: anyway they said of this giant conveyor belt really big and On the side of it there are like these four little platforms and each platform has I guess a cookie on it or something like.

332
00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:18,347
Scott: one has a glass of water one has a glass of water and a cookie I think and they put someone on the treadmill and they have to run from one end of the treadmill to the other and Also eat all the cookies and drink the water.

333
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:24,913
Scott: and if they fall down or if they fail to eat the cookies or whatever They're done and they lose.

334
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:26,040
Scott: but not only that.

335
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:30,200
Scott: Something interesting happens to them when they lose and I'll let you see that for yourself.

336
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:34,394
Scott: The thing that bothers me about this particular challenge is I do not.

337
00:23:34,494 --> 00:23:39,659
Scott: while it is very entertaining and amusing I am under the impression that it was not completely fair.

338
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:49,900
Scott: well, I think that they were controlling the speed of the treadmill manually and Basically as people, you know got close to victory.

339
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:53,277
Scott: They would turn it up more and more and more to make sure that nobody won.

340
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:53,800
Rym: granted.

341
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:58,200
Rym: That's really the only way to run something like this if you want if you made it fair.

342
00:23:58,663 --> 00:24:01,740
Rym: You really missed out on a golden opportunity It is true.

343
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:04,340
Scott: But I do think what they should have just done is okay said.

344
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:06,671
Scott: This is the level that we will set it at.

345
00:24:06,731 --> 00:24:11,180
Scott: set it at a high level that you know Maybe only a really awesome person could accomplish.

346
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,240
Rym: I see you're assuming the same every time that this was intended to be a test of skill.

347
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:21,140
Rym: You see I'm of the mind more and more that Japanese game shows are not game shows.

348
00:24:21,481 --> 00:24:23,109
Rym: They don't the people on the show.

349
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,154
Rym: that doesn't.

350
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:25,280
Rym: they don't matter at all.

351
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:29,799
Rym: They are basically just saps and they exist solely to entertain me.

352
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:31,885
Scott: That may be true.

353
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:40,599
Scott: But at the same time, I think it's sort of you know It entertains me more when it's a fair competition and the people still get fucked.

354
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:49,073
Scott: then if it's a designed to fuck them and they get fucked because you know, it's like They're all day designed to get fucked it's not so funny.

355
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:50,218
Scott: Oh they suck.

356
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:51,363
Scott: Haha They suck.

357
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:55,640
Rym: so a funny moment one is when you realize that at the other end of the treadmill is a pool.

358
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,771
Rym: I was gonna are you gonna keep it secret?

359
00:24:57,892 --> 00:24:59,480
Scott: I hit it, but now it's it's not hidden.

360
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:01,740
Scott: Oh, well, I guess they bail at the treadmill.

361
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,756
Scott: Then the treadmill pushes them into a pool and they go sploosh - the black dude is awesome.

362
00:25:06,877 --> 00:25:07,920
Scott: The black dude is my hero.

363
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:10,290
Scott: He's gigantic - and they?

364
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,620
Scott: how do these Japanese people even expect to be able to win this?

365
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,765
Scott: They're tiny tiny legs.

366
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:17,080
Scott: only the black guy with the giant legs can possibly have a chance and even he.

367
00:25:17,522 --> 00:25:21,360
Rym: I'm not gonna spoil what happens at the end, but suffice to say it's a closely run affair.

368
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,569
Scott: He's also the only person who knows how to run me.

369
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:28,206
Scott: one thing the Japanese people have the tiny legs But they don't even know how to run.

370
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:29,270
Rym: No, the one guy did.

371
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,600
Rym: just the last person ran really oddly.

372
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,990
Scott: I don't know what is up with these people who don't know how to run ready.

373
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:51,356
Scott: Here's Scott's guide how to run ready Move your legs back and forth as quickly as possible Extend them as far as possible lift your knees as high as possible Bend your freaking elbows and swing your arms in time.

374
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:52,640
Rym: Not how you run.

375
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,874
Rym: That's actually a pretty piss-poor way to run.

376
00:25:54,894 --> 00:25:55,780
Rym: That's kind of inefficient.

377
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,320
Scott: But what these people who like they walk with their art they run with their arms like straight at their sides not moving.

378
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:05,335
Scott: They don't bend their knees at all and they just kind of waggle their legs back and forth.

379
00:26:05,796 --> 00:26:06,800
Scott: Those people are fucked up.

380
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,010
Rym: They didn't learn there a Seinfeld about that.

381
00:26:09,392 --> 00:26:11,099
Rym: She just doesn't move her arms.

382
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:14,355
Scott: Yeah, people just don't know how to move it up.

383
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:20,640
Scott: motor skills That's like the most basic skill before even literacy moving your body in the proper fashion.

384
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:26,417
Rym: now I think in the trend of how I started talking about this they missed one final golden opportunity.

385
00:26:26,698 --> 00:26:31,517
Rym: now if The final bit of the challenge had been in fact a urinal.

386
00:26:31,537 --> 00:26:32,511
Scott: Yeah Yeah.

387
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:46,220
Rym: So we brought out the US presidential elections rather serendipitously for tonight We're going to talk about probably our second favorite manga of all the second favorite manga of all time.

388
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:53,228
Rym: Well in the in the in this kind of the two manga that are like this that we have It's the top 10 manga of all time for sure.

389
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:55,960
Rym: It's definitely number two because I love it.

390
00:26:56,222 --> 00:27:04,570
Rym: I don't think it's quite as good as sanctuary But yet at the same time I hadn't read it in a long time and when I pulled it out to flip through it Before we did the show.

391
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:07,350
Rym: I Remembered how freaking awesome it was.

392
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,300
Rym: Yeah, I mean, it's I don't want to read it again.

393
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:16,180
Scott: It's not as awesome as sanctuary Phoenix Buddha Akira, whatever but after all those this is the number one.

394
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,044
Scott: You've got left.

395
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:24,940
Rym: So tonight we're going to talk a bit about Eagle which Well Eagle colon the making of an Asian American president.

396
00:27:25,482 --> 00:27:32,605
Rym: You see Eagle is much like sanctuary only without the eroticism and Without the Yakuza.

397
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:37,720
Scott: Yeah, and without the violence it has some violence, but not much very little very little violence.

398
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:49,325
Scott: it's pretty much just take the politicking and the human drama aspects of sanctuary and spread them out over 2,000 pages and You've got Eagle now.

399
00:27:49,445 --> 00:28:01,512
Rym: Eagle is basically the story of a young man named Takashi Joe whose mom died and he works for some newspaper in Japan and for various reasons he ends up getting the shot of a lifetime

400
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:02,295
Scott: to head

401
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:14,700
Rym: over to America and cover for Japan the presidential campaign of Senator Yamaoka who is a Japanese American Democratic senator who is running for president?

402
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,396
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty cool right there.

403
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:20,589
Rym: and Suffice to say all is not as it appears.

404
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:32,540
Rym: for their hintings that perhaps his mother was murdered and didn't just die of her own accord and Perhaps there are sinister things going on and perhaps reveal any of them would be a huge spoiler.

405
00:28:32,913 --> 00:28:39,080
Rym: Yes and perhaps in fact The man the senator has a link to the young Takashi Joe.

406
00:28:39,462 --> 00:28:43,740
Rym: That may or may not be true or may or may not be apparent or may or may not be important.

407
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:54,140
Scott: Yep, it's all sort of the manga tends to carry you along with a lot of things like tossing out these possibilities All over the place about all sorts of different things.

408
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:10,533
Scott: it sort of feels a lot like a presidential campaign in a way which where there are many rumors and rumors and hints of information and then oh the actual information comes out dumb dumb dumb and then they do it again and again and again and again for many many many pages until it's over.

409
00:29:10,894 --> 00:29:25,379
Rym: now much like if Sanctuary were true I would have joined the Yakuza as soon as I was able to get to Japan and if Horatio Hornblower were true I would have somehow constructed the time machine to go back in time and be some sort of seaman in the Navy.

410
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:30,174
Rym: if Eagle were actually a portrait of how American elections work.

411
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:31,920
Rym: I would be a politician.

412
00:29:32,662 --> 00:29:34,367
Scott: I would also maybe be a reporter.

413
00:29:34,768 --> 00:29:39,300
Rym: Yes, either one because apparently reporters and politicians are all consummate badasses.

414
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:43,092
Scott: Yep, well, let's talk about the meta of this for a second.

415
00:29:43,193 --> 00:29:51,516
Scott: All right, it's made by Kaiji Kawaguchi the story and the art by one man and one man alone the way manga should be.

416
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:56,900
Rym: it was nominated for not One not two not three not five but for Eisner Awards.

417
00:29:57,441 --> 00:29:58,183
Scott: That's quite a.

418
00:29:58,223 --> 00:30:04,620
Rym: many eyes are a best new series best continuing series best writer artist best US edition of foreign material.

419
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:15,187
Scott: Yep, they actually this year they changed the best US edition of foreign material award and they have two of them now this best US edition of foreign material and Best US edition of foreign material Japan.

420
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:17,656
Scott: only because the Japan just kept winnings.

421
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:18,479
Scott: They split it off.

422
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:35,707
Scott: Basically this guy Kaiji Kawaguchi Went all around the US on this big trip Researching like how our politics worked in our country and all sorts of things in Preparation to write this manga and he wasn't.

423
00:30:36,088 --> 00:30:42,453
Scott: it said that he was inspired to create the manga after watching some Documentary about politics or something.

424
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:42,755
Scott: I forgot.

425
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:56,420
Scott: I don't know but if you look and you read this manga it becomes immediately obvious to anyone who knows anything about the United States that this is a Parody I guess of the 2000 presidential election in the US.

426
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:02,540
Rym: Yes, it is definitely Al Gore who is the front-runner Democratic candidate.

427
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,303
Scott: Yeah, he's made.

428
00:31:03,343 --> 00:31:08,000
Scott: they call him Al Noah and they have one of the campaign advisors.

429
00:31:08,221 --> 00:31:14,168
Scott: it's George tuck based on dick tuck and I think the basic guy he gets.

430
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:22,865
Rym: he has these long conversations over the phone with Someone he obviously respects and trusts who gives him a political advice named just bill and

431
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:33,155
Scott: bill happens to be from Arkansas and he's also the current president and He has some scandals and he has a wife named Ellery and

432
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:34,179
Rym: Ellery.

433
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,545
Scott: Yeah It's sort of obvious.

434
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,270
Scott: It's sort of supposed to be obvious.

435
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,840
Scott: It's just avoiding I guess libel and lawsuits and things like that.

436
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:49,231
Rym: Yeah, well also Well, that way they get a lot of the setting of American politics.

437
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:59,000
Rym: at the same time all the events from American politics Don't end up overshadowing what's really going on because this is not about Al Gore versus George Bush.

438
00:31:59,442 --> 00:32:18,274
Rym: it's about the primaries and Al Gore and This Japanese American senator and all the other Democratic candidates all vying for the presidency for the nomination And then the presidency which that part is actually not really quite as Climactic as the primaries are.

439
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:30,700
Scott: yeah the basically the thing starts out like as the primaries are just beginning like people are just deciding if they're gonna run or not and they goes as Far as it goes because we're not gonna spoil how far it goes.

440
00:32:31,463 --> 00:32:35,479
Rym: Now there's some things that this has in common with sanctuary a lot of things.

441
00:32:36,484 --> 00:32:37,790
Rym: The art is similar.

442
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,040
Rym: I think it's a little bit simpler, but I also really like it.

443
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:49,655
Rym: It's kind of charming and it definitely it's almost nothing but inspirational close-ups of characters talking Almost nothing pretty much every single panel.

444
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:50,760
Scott: not every single panel.

445
00:32:50,780 --> 00:33:01,000
Scott: but most panels are like they really highlight the person's faces and Kawaguchi is really good at drawing like these powerful faces that stand out, you know.

446
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,200
Scott: So you just want to look at him and they're like BAM, you know.

447
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:15,543
Scott: It's like someone's face just sort of like explodes with like the radiant light coming from it in every single panel Like someone gets up behind a podium to make a speech and it's like their head is glowing and someone looks at someone with Like a look.

448
00:33:15,603 --> 00:33:17,432
Scott: that really means something that you don't.

449
00:33:17,593 --> 00:33:26,319
Scott: you don't need to put words around You know, you don't need to make them say something to get the meaning across because of the way he gets the expressions with the eyes You know and stuff like that.

450
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:33,160
Scott: So it's really just panels of faces for the majority of the art and I don't really have problem with that.

451
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:50,065
Rym: yeah, plus if you flip through whenever there are people in the background or extras or just other people around and If they're ever close up in scene many times They'll all have unique faces and be very specifically drawn differently from people around them instead of just you know Faceless people in the background.

452
00:33:50,306 --> 00:33:52,816
Scott: Yeah, all the non faces are sort of drawn.

453
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:58,000
Scott: I guess normally I mean the proportions of the bodies are pretty accurate and you know, you don't go.

454
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:06,308
Scott: Hey, why is that guy arm half as long as the other arm and stuff like that, but it's not particularly Striking in any way.

455
00:34:06,328 --> 00:34:08,119
Scott: It's it's pretty standard stuff.

456
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:12,675
Rym: But you know another thing that really makes it similar to sanctuary is the look.

457
00:34:12,695 --> 00:34:15,409
Scott: there's an ad for sanctuary in the back of this Volume of Eagle really?

458
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:28,303
Rym: Yeah Wow But anyway there in sanctuary there was definitely this trend where anyone who opposed the main characters would eventually either die or Join them.

459
00:34:28,844 --> 00:34:30,690
Rym: there seems to be this whole thing of like.

460
00:34:31,031 --> 00:34:40,187
Rym: anyone who's smart will join the good guys in their quest and it's very difficult for smart people to Deal with fighting against the main characters.

461
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:45,020
Rym: and that sort of thing happens a lot in the early parts of both Eagle and sanctuary.

462
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:50,677
Scott: Yeah, there's a great part where one of my favorite parts is when Yamaoka goes to Texas.

463
00:34:51,400 --> 00:35:06,237
Scott: Oh He's not very welcome and he goes to like you know a saloon where he's not very welcome because of his a gun control policy and then he pretty much Does awesome stuff to rally these cowboys and I won't say any more than that.

464
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:17,820
Scott: Yes I really don't want to ruin anything about this and I think it's good that I haven't read it very recently otherwise I can't ruin it because I barely The fact that I remember that scene says a lot because I don't remember many of the scenes.

465
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:21,973
Scott: I remember the basic plot and these scenes that struck me particularly.

466
00:35:22,113 --> 00:35:24,400
Rym: I remember when what I thought was the climax happened.

467
00:35:24,503 --> 00:35:30,340
Rym: I thought okay I know what's going on and then the manga did a 180 and then I remember sitting there thinking what the fuck?

468
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:41,183
Rym: Yeah, and then when I when they ended and I actually read the end I was quite surprised I'm not gonna say anything But there's there was.

469
00:35:41,403 --> 00:35:50,840
Scott: there is a big twist at the very very end of Eagle that I did not see coming But it makes perfect sense and it's pretty awesome.

470
00:35:51,261 --> 00:35:54,009
Scott: and I think without that this manga would be half as good.

471
00:35:54,029 --> 00:36:05,270
Scott: and It's it makes it worth reading the whole thing Even though I think the earlier part of the manga has a lot more meat than the later volumes except for the explosive ending.

472
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:17,437
Rym: Now luckily while it's very deep politics I mean, there's a lot of talk about specific parts of the primaries or press relations and all these very very Deeply involved in politics things.

473
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:20,528
Rym: and yet you don't need to know a lot of politics to get it.

474
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:33,510
Rym: Because whenever it's kind of like when you watch a show like ER where there's a lot of buzzwords and jargon and Even if they're used correctly and even if you don't really know what they mean all the ER use medical terms correctly sometimes.

475
00:36:34,353 --> 00:36:36,309
Scott: Yeah, and CSI is real detective work people.

476
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:38,010
Rym: I guess hornblower is a better example.

477
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:43,310
Rym: But you'll get the sense that you know what's going on and with the context you'll figure it all out.

478
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:43,855
Rym: There's really.

479
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,510
Scott: it's very accessible.

480
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:51,650
Scott: You can understand what's going on without being a political expert and for in fact without knowing anything about US politics.

481
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:52,510
Scott: I mean, this is a manga.

482
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:58,830
Scott: This is made for Japanese people who know a lot less about American politics than even like an American high schooler is supposed to.

483
00:36:59,432 --> 00:37:04,090
Scott: So it's it's not hard for you reading this translated into English to know what's going on

484
00:37:04,613 --> 00:37:27,510
Rym: But sadly the one thing that doesn't really bother me But definitely colors my perception of reading this is that it feels like it was written From the perspective of someone who saw events happening and understood how things work in politics But didn't really understand how things really work because it's so idealistic and it's so yes This good person will prevail.

485
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:33,348
Rym: Yes it if you give a good speech and you're passionate then people will care and it seems to.

486
00:37:33,368 --> 00:37:35,856
Rym: I Wish American politics were like Eagle.

487
00:37:36,136 --> 00:37:39,607
Scott: Oh god, you don't know how much I wish American politics are like Eagle.

488
00:37:39,627 --> 00:37:43,793
Scott: cuz I'll be the president Book right here.

489
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:44,876
Scott: that tells me how to do it.

490
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:49,370
Scott: All right, so if you want to get Eagle, it's not I'm not sure.

491
00:37:49,451 --> 00:37:50,099
Scott: I'm pretty sure.

492
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,541
Scott: it's not in print I'm pretty sure of that but it is also not hard to find.

493
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:57,550
Scott: I actually see this a lot more often than I see sanctuary now.

494
00:37:58,272 --> 00:38:12,670
Scott: It's printed by Viz back in the day and it reads left to right which is fine because you know sure I'd rather have it be right to left and I'd rather have but Was supposed to be facing the rising Sun but now he's facing the setting Sun.

495
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:15,629
Scott: Yeah, and I'd rather have it.

496
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:20,442
Scott: You know keep sound effects intact, but really there aren't that many sound effects.

497
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:25,448
Scott: So it's not you know, it's not the action book here It's mostly a political talking book.

498
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:31,155
Scott: But there's this printed as far as I know Eagle in two different formats.

499
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:34,584
Scott: in one format consisted of many smaller books like.

500
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:42,750
Scott: the books were maybe like I don't know 20 or 30 pages big and They're like 30 something of these books.

501
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:52,430
Scott: They're a whole bunch of them and you'll know if you see one because it'll say Eagle and it'll be about a centimeter thick Maybe or maybe even less than that don't buy those now.

502
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:54,067
Scott: You mean you might be able to get them all?

503
00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:05,332
Scott: but because they're kind of like I see random ones all over the place and I'm sure if I had bought everyone I've ever seen In my life that now I would have them all or close to all of them and it probably could have picked up the missing Ones online.

504
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:07,919
Scott: but who wants 30 little tiny books?

505
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:22,389
Scott: because this later printed the entire thing in five giant books that are very relatively easy to find cheap especially at cons because people don't respect this manga and they put it on the discount rack.

506
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:27,090
Scott: and I even see them at New York comic book stores all the time and online.

507
00:39:27,371 --> 00:39:32,529
Scott: I see them on Amazon and places all the time and you can just get them for like less than 20 bucks each.

508
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:33,373
Scott: five Giant books.

509
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:36,673
Scott: you can have all of Eagle all 2,000 pages for under $100.

510
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:38,200
Rym: I I can't stress enough.

511
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:46,893
Rym: if you at all have any interest in this Find the first one somewhere and read it and if you like that I guarantee you'll like the rest because it only gets better from There.

512
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,450
Scott: yeah, you're buying a giant book.

513
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:56,044
Scott: So, you know buy just one to see if you like it first because while we think it's awesome I don't think everyone would think it's awesome.

514
00:39:56,084 --> 00:39:58,194
Scott: If you like the naruto Communist yes.

515
00:39:58,254 --> 00:40:01,205
Scott: Yeah, if you like naruto and that's like your favorite thing ever.

516
00:40:01,286 --> 00:40:02,370
Scott: I don't know if you're gonna like Eagle.

517
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,002
Scott: It's sort of the exact opposite.

518
00:40:05,022 --> 00:40:10,289
Rym: I Don't know because this one fight does take most of the manga.

519
00:40:13,137 --> 00:40:18,680
Scott: It's a lot of Well, his voting rating is over 9% 9%.

520
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,279
Scott: Yeah Yeah, he's up in the polls.

521
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:23,066
Scott: He's down in the polls OMG.

522
00:40:23,107 --> 00:40:23,870
Scott: He gave a speech.

523
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:27,385
Scott: He had to eat two dinners and all the two dinners in one night.

524
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,550
Rym: That was one of the best scene.

525
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,039
Scott: That was all that I love that scene.

526
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:30,703
Scott: That was awesome.

527
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:32,813
Scott: two dinners in one night You're not?

528
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:43,730
Scott: I mean you think it's badass when I don't know someone pilots a robot with one arm and destroys an entire Battleship and loses their own physical leg and saves their best friend from dying But then the best friend dies.

529
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,055
Scott: Anyway, you think that's badass?

530
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:56,105
Scott: or you think it's badass when like Ken churro like punches a thousand times You have not seen someone eat two five-course meals in one night?

531
00:40:56,386 --> 00:40:57,790
Scott: that is the most badass.
