1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,172
Rym: It is Thursday November 29th.

2
00:00:11,192 --> 00:00:16,372
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,412 --> 00:00:18,780
Rym: for some reason we talk about musical instruments.

4
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:25,378
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:35,210
Rym: So this is probably germane more to uh I don't know GeekNights Tuesday rather than GeekNights Thursday.

6
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:42,710
Rym: But I like to point out that Scott and I together played go against each other for the first time about 15 minutes ago.

7
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:46,642
Scott: Well we sort of played it sort of off the cuff like you know.

8
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:47,545
Scott: it's a pretty simple game.

9
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:57,870
Scott: you take turns putting you Know your colored guy on the board and when you surround the other guy you get his stuff sort of like Othello or Tron in A way in a really abstract way.

10
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,075
Rym: But that's I don't.

11
00:00:59,115 --> 00:00:59,215
Rym: the.

12
00:00:59,617 --> 00:01:02,186
Rym: the deal is we've been for you Thursday.

13
00:01:02,226 --> 00:01:02,788
Rym: people don't listen.

14
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:02,909
Rym: to.

15
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,190
Rym: Tuesday.

16
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:16,109
Rym: We're uh kind of into really hardcore You know German style brains banging against other brains kind of games not like chess But more like Puerto Rico or D. Ma care or D. Seidler for Catan.

17
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:39,169
Rym: anyway, we We were done with a lot of these games at least the two and three player versions of these games because Scott And I live together for a long time, and I think we have finished to the point of not being able to enjoy any further or gain any sort of intellectual stimulation from Any two-player game we've ever played.

18
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:46,147
Scott: So of course you know people will say and some mostly rightly so that go is like the be all end.

19
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:47,190
Scott: all of games like.

20
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:59,479
Scott: It's perfect information It's wholly abstract And it is so many different possible moves and patterns that a computer can't possibly Figure it out because it's so complex now.

21
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,428
Rym: I'd always been leery partly because RIT.

22
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:05,963
Rym: I didn't have to worry about go because there were still German games.

23
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:06,605
Rym: I hadn't played.

24
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,408
Rym: that might have been good.

25
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:08,887
Rym: now I've played them all.

26
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:10,877
Scott: Yep, granted.

27
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:20,399
Rym: We if we had more people living here we'd probably be okay because I don't think we've solved for player T and E or Four or five player k-lists or any of those.

28
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,205
Scott: yeah, it's just like two and three player games.

29
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:23,390
Scott: We're running out.

30
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:26,162
Rym: I'll tell you all a little thing about games in general.

31
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:41,321
Rym: Just because you know you're not Tuesday listeners, maybe Two-player games are very difficult to make With any sort of staying power because they basically break down into randomness or a Predetermined victory condition yeah, or rock-paper-scissors.

32
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:49,850
Scott: It's like think about it every two-player game You've ever played right that you could ever think of unless it's some kind of sport right like boxing.

33
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:59,240
Scott: Say it all it comes down to either rock-paper-scissors Memorization luck something along those lines.

34
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,029
Scott: It's never like strategy or anything like that.

35
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:05,760
Rym: It might be strategy until you solve the game.

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,482
Rym: I mean checkers.

37
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:15,010
Rym: you can place checkers tactically and strategically Unless you know the game perfectly and then you can just play perfectly and no matter what always make the good decision.

38
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:25,172
Scott: I guess maybe those miniatures war games like maybe Warhammer But then it's got some randomness in there with the dice action going on that evens out and while those games would probably solve Our problem.

39
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:28,643
Rym: Do you think we have the time to play a game like that?

40
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:29,245
Rym: I want to.

41
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:31,693
Scott: I love we can't even play like Battle lore.

42
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:48,395
Rym: I love games where I have a million fiddly miniatures And I pull out a laser pen and some measuring tape and give my skirmishers in order to go into the woods and wait while Scott's columns of Celiel troops are marching in from the north, but I Don't have time for that.

43
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,089
Rym: Maybe if I had a basement, and I could leave it set up and no job.

44
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:59,845
Scott: Oh, you know what if we whenever we build you know geek house version 2 the thing is most of the fun I get from those games is setting up and moving the dudes around.

45
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:05,409
Scott: I would be Better-served just had it with a basement buying a shit ton of Legos and not playing a game.

46
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:13,830
Rym: Well see the other problem is while those games are really fun You're probably better off just playing a computer simulation of war at that point yep.

47
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:24,628
Scott: So I don't want to talk too much about go now because we're complete doofuses with it, but And in the future there will be lots of go talking going on.

48
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:30,590
Scott: perhaps Go talking that go fanatics will be pissed off, and maybe we should watch a car no go.

49
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,120
Scott: I mean I've seen like four episodes.

50
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:33,490
Rym: I kind of like to car or no go.

51
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,524
Scott: It's not like Akagi because no I'm saying maybe we should watch it to learn something.

52
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:38,808
Rym: Yeah, maybe we should.

53
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:45,470
Rym: you know There's something to be said there for making shows that are educational and are entertaining.

54
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:51,700
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you're street as a kid yeah If you really think about it there aren't too many things that it's.

55
00:04:52,001 --> 00:05:01,810
Scott: usually when someone tries to be educational they fail Entertainment or when they try for entertainment They don't do any education, and it's very rare that something succeeds at doing both.

56
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:04,590
Scott: You know despite many people trying to do both.

57
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:10,170
Scott: And I think a car no go is one of the best successes perhaps the top ten of those of all time.

58
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:15,590
Scott: I mean it must teach some go and It's also entertaining.

59
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:21,405
Rym: But to put it really really briefly our first foray into go Scott's played go a couple times before.

60
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:29,872
Rym: I played half of a game Of go once and then I was distracted by some emergency at some anime club function I played.

61
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,723
Rym: I had to go be the president and stop it.

62
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:32,850
Scott: at RIT.

63
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,530
Scott: I played a few maybe a handful of games of go with people who actually knew what they were doing.

64
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:40,229
Scott: Actually like a few I played a few games with someone who?

65
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:45,470
Scott: Knew knew slightly more than me, but you know I still wasn't like a master.

66
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:52,982
Scott: and then I played against some people who were like go nut cases and I lost every time, but I wasn't frustrated because I lost.

67
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:56,398
Scott: I was frustrated cuz they didn't know why I lost and because it Wasn't fun.

68
00:05:56,661 --> 00:06:11,930
Rym: see I have two Ideas, and I'm not sure how I feel about go because on one hand Despite really liking these kinds of games You know abstracted or semi abstracted games of tactics and strategy and patterns the thing is I'm not a fan of perfect information games.

69
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:16,002
Rym: Well the problem is that like chess.

70
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:21,702
Rym: people always bother me and give me shit about the fact that I don't like the game of chess at all and I never have.

71
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:23,390
Rym: I played it a lot as a kid.

72
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:25,497
Rym: I I'm okay at it.

73
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:29,450
Rym: one of my friends was he wasn't like a grandmaster or anything, but he was like a master.

74
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:30,175
Rym: He was ranked.

75
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:32,090
Rym: He was awesome at chess.

76
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:36,030
Rym: He was kind of a savant at chess, and I don't think I ever beat him.

77
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:56,829
Rym: But I played chess against him all the time And I basically came to the conclusion that the reason I didn't like chess was that it was The game had because of the manner and I guess depth of abstraction it basically seemed to come down to the complex Memorization of patterns and that mattered a lot more than any tactical or strategic thought.

78
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:01,317
Scott: yeah It's like you couldn't sit there and sort of Figure your figure out how to solve it.

79
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:07,056
Scott: the same way you figure out say a block puzzle in a Zelda game Or you know some.

80
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:08,098
Scott: you know that kind.

81
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:12,390
Rym: that's the kind of thinking or even the tactical situation in a war.

82
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:18,750
Scott: Yeah, it's like huh well if I move this over here Then I'll you know she it chess isn't like that chess.

83
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:25,028
Scott: I mean, I guess you could think about chess in that way But you will lose to someone who just memorized every possible pattern.

84
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:30,250
Scott: well I guess let me put a ghost feels a lot like chess only with a lot more possible patterns.

85
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:33,570
Rym: Oh, well, so uh what do you got in the news all right?

86
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:48,001
Scott: So if you are someone who still watches television right and you don't just get your TV shows on DVD or something I mean, I guess that's okay for people who have a lot of time and not much to do And they just want to watch some video, and

87
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:49,349
Rym: you should at least have a TiVo.

88
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:50,254
Rym: I mean God.

89
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:53,270
Scott: hey you should at least have a TiVo or a DVR of some sort.

90
00:07:53,531 --> 00:08:04,586
Rym: I would say that if you are a fan of television like you like television shows And you have cable not having some sort of DVR That's like being a crackhead and not owning your own crack pipe.

91
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:05,430
Scott: wait a minute.

92
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,818
Scott: He was that a thing of the day once.

93
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,729
Rym: I hope it was all right.

94
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:10,937
Rym: I'll search if it wasn't Monday.

95
00:08:11,138 --> 00:08:11,961
Scott: You're a crackhead.

96
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:14,290
Scott: Why don't you have a crack pipe seriously?

97
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,988
Rym: You think that'd be the one thing you'd own?

98
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:23,650
Rym: anyway like being a painter and Having watercolors, but not owning any other kind of paint.

99
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,489
Scott: Yep, now pretty much.

100
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:32,581
Scott: I've looked into DVRs a little bit and from what I can tell TiVo is Sort of the best one sort of.

101
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,130
Scott: you know it's got the best interface.

102
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:45,474
Scott: That's that it's seemingly, and you know they have a good You know channel guide and everything like that and a lot of people have TiVos are really happy with TiVos and big fans of Them and they work.

103
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:51,924
Scott: and if I if I was TV watching Maybe I'd have an HD TV, and I'd probably have an HD TiVo also.

104
00:08:52,647 --> 00:09:02,549
Scott: the only problem I have with TiVo and the reason I would never get one right now is because You have to buy the TiVo itself, and then you have to pay TiVo a monthly fee.

105
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:07,670
Rym: Right for the TiVo to keep working well, you know there's a lot of reasons for that.

106
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:17,224
Rym: I mean the main reason why people use services like this is because you get the TV listings Yeah, integrated, which is not always the easiest or freest thing to do.

107
00:09:17,244 --> 00:09:26,199
Scott: no no no but Basically the the problem I have with TiVo is that you buy this box and you pay this monthly fee And you're sort of stuck with TiVo.

108
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:28,190
Scott: the company can just like take your TiVo away.

109
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,890
Scott: They they have all sorts of control over the box itself like you can't do like anything you want with a TiVo.

110
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:35,588
Scott: You can only do what they want the TiVo to do.

111
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:42,009
Rym: I mean remember all the problems about how they take away like the 30-second skip so people can't skip ads as easily.

112
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:52,378
Rym: and Yeah, to me 30-second skip on a DVR is probably the most important function more important than TV listings Right, so you know something.

113
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,364
Scott: if I was gonna get a DVR right now.

114
00:09:54,565 --> 00:10:05,130
Scott: I would opt to get something like Microsoft Media Center, which the only problem with that is it's not free or Myth TV, which the only problem with that is it's hard to get TV listings for it that are free.

115
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,915
Scott: At least you can't.

116
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:07,910
Rym: a lot of people have trouble setting it up.

117
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:15,244
Scott: Yeah but I would just use not myth or which just sets it up automatically and then I would pay for the TV listings only and I'd be all set to go.

118
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:16,352
Rym: well Yeah But you're smart.

119
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:21,591
Scott: and the thing yeah the thing with that is it's so much better than TiVo because you mean the interface isn't as Good.

120
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:33,288
Scott: but you have a computer connected to your television and that computer just has some software on it that happens to do DVR stuff and it's actually also a computer that you can do whatever the hell you want with.

121
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:43,150
Rym: and Whereas the TiVo is a computer that can only do one thing which is sort of like, uh, yeah Remember that guy at Dragon Con who had his myth TV set up with pretty much every ROM ever?

122
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:48,245
Scott: Yeah, basically his TV was every arcade game ever and the TV shows you record.

123
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:50,070
Rym: you might be thinking Rym and Scott.

124
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,698
Rym: He didn't have every arcade game ever.

125
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:53,065
Rym: I defy you to find something.

126
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:54,130
Rym: He didn't have good God.

127
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,970
Rym: Well, because they're 40,000.

128
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,850
Scott: Well, because I was like because unlike in Mame Mame has a list of supported games.

129
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,189
Scott: Like if you download Mame and run it, it'll list out all the games that it can run.

130
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:09,150
Scott: It's the multiple arcade machine emulator.

131
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:15,710
Scott: There's a list is a known list of which arcade machines are emulated and what games are built on those machines.

132
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:22,378
Scott: And if you get a game for Mame that game lights up and says you can play me now and there are torrents of every game.

133
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:28,688
Scott: Anyway anyway This might change soon and this is important stuff.

134
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:35,630
Scott: Nero a closed source software company, but a company that I don't really hate so much because they make high quality software.

135
00:11:36,152 --> 00:11:38,981
Scott: They make high quality software for Linux at a reasonable price.

136
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:40,386
Rym: Yeah, I mean you might know them from.

137
00:11:40,526 --> 00:11:47,350
Scott: Nero burning ROM Pretty much make the best CD DVD burning software out there and they make a bunch of other software.

138
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,090
Scott: That's sort of a but you know, they just attach it to their CD burning software.

139
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,896
Scott: I guess some of its okay like the stuff that makes DVD and CD cover art and whatnot but most of its just direct.

140
00:11:56,936 --> 00:12:11,910
Scott: they throw in there to you know, sell you more direct, but They made a deal with TiVo and in the next version of Nero supposedly There's going to be a DVR software that has the TiVo interface like and they're gonna pay TiVo for this.

141
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:39,107
Scott: So ha what's gonna happen is you take a computer plug it into your TV and your cable box or your satellite Whatever and then you install Nero on there and then in that you have a computer that you control that happens to run TiVo, but Nero's providing it and I imagine it's gonna have all sorts of cool functionality such as I don't know download a show record it burn it to DVD with Nero etc.

142
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:39,267
Scott: etc.

143
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:42,470
Scott: and That would probably be worth it.

144
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:49,368
Scott: And I think if someone was like a super TiVo fan It might be in their best interest to stop paying their.

145
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:53,350
Scott: you know I guess maybe you'll still have to pay some someone for TV listings or something.

146
00:12:53,633 --> 00:13:02,224
Scott: I don't know how that's gonna work specifically But I think the best option of the future for DVR might be get a computer Get Nero on there with the TiVo.

147
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:08,978
Scott: that's part of the Nero TiVo Nero PC DVR Acronym acronym words that end in O.

148
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:11,790
Rym: Yeah, because people are really gonna just figure that out and know what to do.

149
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,619
Scott: Yeah, I know right, but it does seem like it's.

150
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:14,900
Scott: it's.

151
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:17,650
Scott: it's the best option for the consumer or at least it's gonna be.

152
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:19,370
Scott: Yeah, the thing is to see how much it costs.

153
00:13:19,895 --> 00:13:25,021
Rym: I would I mean even if I had a lot of free time I've really gotten beyond the point of needing to.

154
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:25,984
Rym: I mean things come out.

155
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:26,687
Rym: I want to see him.

156
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:27,590
Rym: I want to see shows.

157
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:35,830
Rym: I want to see movies, but I No longer care about seeing them When they come out or as soon as they come out because I've still got a backlog of things to watch.

158
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:43,704
Scott: I've got like a whole bunch of years left in my life and Right now I'm young so I don't have a lot of young time.

159
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:44,830
Scott: I got plenty of old time.

160
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,605
Scott: So got to spend the young time wisely doing stuff being productive in some.

161
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,330
Rym: yeah, like playing a plastic guitar.

162
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:56,855
Scott: exactly You Can have a real plastic guitar.

163
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,102
Scott: it wouldn't sound too great, but I imagine you could.

164
00:13:59,162 --> 00:13:59,724
Scott: you could make one.

165
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:01,810
Rym: I play guitar hero acoustically.

166
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,735
Rym: You didn't see that episode.

167
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:06,166
Rym: Did you know it up South Park?

168
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:07,130
Rym: Yeah, it's okay.

169
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:10,299
Rym: Yeah, okay, it makes the point that I would probably make.

170
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:14,913
Rym: and yeah anyway, so there's this article on slash shot I just linked to.

171
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:15,917
Rym: I've looked at it.

172
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:28,590
Rym: Finally because I saw it this morning and it was about Social networking and Facebook in my space and how it might get destroyed by something or other and I Thought the article based on these slash dot comments was gonna say a few things.

173
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:35,397
Rym: I actually read the article just now and I had to throw out pretty much everything I was gonna say because the article doesn't even get that far.

174
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:35,819
Rym: Yeah.

175
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:37,424
Rym: Oh even better.

176
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,130
Rym: I just realized it's by Cory Doctorow.

177
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:41,389
Rym: Yeah, I didn't even notice.

178
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:47,930
Rym: Okay, but anyway the title is how your creepy ex co-workers will kill Facebook.

179
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,590
Rym: All right, and it says in a whole bunch of words.

180
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:53,618
Rym: it seems like the gist is very simply.

181
00:14:54,381 --> 00:15:01,546
Rym: the problem with social networking is that you can't refuse if someone else wants to be your friend not up.

182
00:15:01,586 --> 00:15:12,204
Rym: let me finish and Therefore you'll have a bunch of people who are not your friends on your friend list and that causes all sorts of problems now one You can easily refuse.

183
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:15,383
Scott: Yeah For a while for a long time.

184
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:19,884
Scott: I was just Refusing most people who wanted to be my friend like on Facebook.

185
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,270
Scott: Like I don't use Facebook.

186
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:28,842
Scott: I signed up for it when it was new right way back and I just never used it because it never Really improved my life or did anything for ya.

187
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:29,384
Rym: I couldn't.

188
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:35,710
Rym: when you signed up for Facebook I think I was already at IBM maybe but I just never used it.

189
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:42,743
Scott: But I would get emails whenever anyone like friended me or messaged me or something Usually on my birthday cuz Facebook apparently told everyone when it was my birthday.

190
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:44,470
Scott: So I would go into Facebook.

191
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:54,610
Scott: I would you know, whatever messages it sent me I would handle those messages and usually it was people who wanted to be my friend people I didn't know who wanted to be my friend and I would just say no, I don't know who you are.

192
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:55,613
Scott: Why are you friending me?

193
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:56,276
Scott: You're not my friend.

194
00:15:56,316 --> 00:15:57,179
Scott: You're a stranger.

195
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:06,890
Scott: and I thought recently I was thinking you know Maybe the reason that these social networks are not useful to me and I'm getting no use out of them.

196
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,095
Scott: Cuz I don't friend anybody.

197
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:08,577
Scott: it's like.

198
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:11,950
Scott: isn't the point to make a network of people by friending them and then it becomes useful?

199
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,652
Rym: So we'll see.

200
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:22,267
Rym: if I if we go back though remember before Facebook or any of that there was Orkut Yeah and we all signed up for Orkut our little front row crew and a lot of people at RIT.

201
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:33,387
Rym: we knew and we actually used it a lot and I remember like the first time when someone I didn't really know But they seem to be a friend to someone I knew and they wanted to be my friend.

202
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:42,690
Rym: and I was like, you know I'm gonna go beyond using this as my kind of Personal forum to talk with my friends and schedule events and all that fun stuff and share pictures.

203
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:47,185
Rym: I'm gonna make a new friend and I said yes, you can be my friend.

204
00:16:47,205 --> 00:17:08,510
Rym: and Then the next day I wake up I'm about to skip class and play Counter-Strike and I go to Orkut and I had like 400 Portuguese spam messages from friends of friends of friends of friends of friends and I learned that day that Friending people you don't know and social networking is probably the stupidest thing you could ever do in your entire life

205
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:08,932
Scott: Right.

206
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:11,344
Rym: So recently sort of getting in cars with strangers.

207
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:14,582
Scott: Yeah So recently I said, you know what?

208
00:17:14,643 --> 00:17:18,378
Scott: I'm gonna try it, you know You know people have been talking and I'm gonna.

209
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:19,763
Scott: I'm gonna friend anyone who has.

210
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:23,925
Scott: so I put out a message and I said hey I've been having a policy of not friending people.

211
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:26,607
Scott: I don't know Social networks have been useless to me.

212
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:31,050
Scott: I'm gonna friend anyone who asks and I've been friending everyone who asks and you know what?

213
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,523
Scott: The social networks are no more useful to me than they were before it.

214
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:36,230
Scott: It's just completely a waste of time.

215
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:37,449
Scott: It doesn't do anything for me.

216
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:43,590
Rym: I think they're because this article kind of complains about social networks and I don't really want to talk so much about this article.

217
00:17:43,650 --> 00:18:00,843
Rym: but just in general a lot of people hate on social networking and they give a lot of reasons like people will stalk you or Kids will put their information up online or like this one says if your boss demands to be your friend It's very awkward and dangerous to say no and it's hard to like.

218
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:07,530
Rym: it's a social taboo to say No When someone wants to friend you even though I think anyone who feels that way has got serious problems.

219
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:13,573
Scott: I do if you put value in whether someone says yes or no to friendship on Facebook.

220
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:15,783
Scott: you got a problem, but I mean like.

221
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:18,104
Scott: maybe if Rym wouldn't want to be my friend I'd be like what the fuck.

222
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:21,990
Rym: but Yeah, but it see I can see where the social awkwardness might come.

223
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:26,789
Rym: Let's say for example, we had a friend in the crew Joey Jojo Shava.

224
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:28,913
Scott: do Joey Jojo?

225
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:33,250
Rym: and you know, we hang out with Joey Jojo, but we're not super friends with Joey Jojo.

226
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,584
Rym: We had a lot of people like that at RIT when we were freshmen.

227
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:52,769
Rym: like the crew We like we all met the front row crew But there were like 30 other people and all the different clubs that we all kind of knew and they were all kind of our Friends, but they weren't super our friends and over time We weren't really that much hanging out with them because a lot of them we didn't really like so much like it's not like.

228
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,674
Rym: oh They were bad people.

229
00:18:53,714 --> 00:18:56,750
Scott: We just they're just you know, they're people that you know, you know their face.

230
00:18:57,071 --> 00:19:00,987
Scott: You maybe know their name your their acquaintances, but they're not like your friends.

231
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,552
Scott: You don't hang out with them You don't call them up.

232
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:03,556
Scott: You don't go to their parties.

233
00:19:03,596 --> 00:19:09,157
Scott: You just you see them around especially, you know co-workers and fellow students And stuff like that.

234
00:19:09,217 --> 00:19:10,203
Rym: You're like at our idea.

235
00:19:10,223 --> 00:19:10,525
Rym: Let's see.

236
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:11,390
Rym: There was duck boy.

237
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,902
Scott: Yeah, they're people you see and people you know, but they're not your friends.

238
00:19:14,962 --> 00:19:17,410
Scott: You don't have any emotional attachment to them.

239
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,797
Scott: Now imagine you don't trust them.

240
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:21,742
Rym: Well, there was also that Steve.

241
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:26,317
Rym: Yeah now imagine if someone out there Let's say I'll use myself.

242
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,606
Rym: I'm I think I'm cool with this group of people like.

243
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,510
Rym: I'm friends with this guy.

244
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:30,833
Rym: Oh, man we're friends.

245
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:44,589
Rym: and you know that scene in a lot of movies or TV shows where like the guy who's kind of awkward or not really the real friend gives someone a ride home and then the guy like goes into his house and the friends standing outside like so, uh You want to do something?

246
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:46,835
Rym: I'm kind of busy.

247
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:48,581
Rym: Ah, maybe some other time.

248
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,729
Rym: Yeah, maybe some other time.

249
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:54,543
Rym: click It's the same situation someone yours.

250
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:55,447
Rym: You're not really friends with.

251
00:19:55,507 --> 00:20:03,630
Rym: it's like hey You want to be my friend on Facebook and saying no is basically telling them in no uncertain terms that you're not really my friend.

252
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:16,216
Scott: Well, I think the problem there right is that in person right like a lot of people like fanboys like super fanboys You know with social basically lacking social Skills completely right?

253
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:16,980
Scott: They don't.

254
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,413
Scott: it's sort of like this huge gray scale Like they don't like.

255
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:24,366
Scott: you can like brush someone off, but then they won't feel like they're brushed off.

256
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:28,452
Scott: and there's all these social You know Like.

257
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:29,054
Rym: nah, man.

258
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:30,579
Rym: Sorry, I'm busy blah blah blah.

259
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:31,582
Rym: Maybe some other time.

260
00:20:31,622 --> 00:20:32,886
Rym: Hey, sorry got her.

261
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:34,130
Rym: anime Club was a good example.

262
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:34,918
Rym: I was the president.

263
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:38,088
Rym: my job After a showing was to pretty much

264
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:38,852
Scott: Mingle

265
00:20:38,892 --> 00:20:54,648
Rym: around be visible talk to everyone in the club make everyone feel like they were my friend whether they were or weren't and Scott could tell and all my real friends could tell when I was Genuinely talking to someone and when I was fake talking to someone as in these like I'd haha.

266
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:55,210
Rym: Yeah, that's great.

267
00:20:56,874 --> 00:21:03,190
Scott: When you're in person talking to someone there's so much subtlety and complexity to a social situation.

268
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:09,773
Scott: It could turn out all sorts of ways, but when you bring it down to friend or not friend It's sort of like.

269
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:11,219
Scott: you can't be subtle about it.

270
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:11,922
Scott: You can't be.

271
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:13,387
Scott: there's no delicacy.

272
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:16,864
Scott: There's no nothing like that, so it's just flat-out.

273
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:19,292
Scott: you are my friend or You're not.

274
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:24,590
Scott: instead of like, you know, the the relationship you had, you know, which was hey, what's up?

275
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:25,419
Scott: It's not like.

276
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:26,209
Scott: you're my enemy.

277
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:27,876
Scott: But what choice do I have?

278
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:37,310
Rym: either you're my friend or you're not and some things like I think or cut had an acquaintance Level and all these levels of friendship, but then how come he's a friend and I'm an acquaintance?

279
00:21:38,012 --> 00:21:48,450
Rym: Of course the answer that is anyone who says that you probably didn't actually want to hang out with in the first place and you're Off when they stop talking to you, but actually my new my new thinking is this on the social networks, right?

280
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,559
Scott: We use Google for domains, right?

281
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,177
Rym: So all the front row crew people still my thunder I was gonna say almost the same thing.

282
00:21:56,217 --> 00:22:01,216
Scott: We go ahead we chat with each other on our own Semi private I am Network.

283
00:22:01,677 --> 00:22:03,101
Scott: We email each other.

284
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:04,304
Scott: We calendar each other.

285
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:04,966
Rym: Not just that.

286
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:06,530
Rym: we have our own forum.

287
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,251
Rym: I mean you guys use the front row crew forums and I really like our forums like.

288
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:12,646
Rym: I hang out with all of you on that forum and I really like it.

289
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:19,050
Rym: but The crew itself we have kind of a secret internal forum where we also use that forum for our own business.

290
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,995
Rym: Don't ask to be on we're not gonna give you an account.

291
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:29,504
Scott: But yeah, but I mean basically it's we already have Google for domains and a forum You know for our group of friends.

292
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:30,930
Scott: It's we have a group of friends.

293
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:36,310
Scott: This is like, you know a whole bunch of us the front row crew and we all have good things that we use already.

294
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:40,230
Scott: And I feel like if I didn't have those things I'd be all about the fan.

295
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:46,690
Scott: Facebook does those things also so I'd probably be using that, you know to schedule events or to talk.

296
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,444
Scott: You know invite people to things and all that kind of thing.

297
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:58,370
Rym: if you have a wide, you know Especially if you're coming out of college you have dozens and dozens and dozens of friends Hopefully even more and you all kind of get spread out maybe little clumps around the country.

298
00:22:58,491 --> 00:23:00,490
Rym: But you want to stay in touch and do stuff.

299
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,970
Rym: But how annoying is it to have to call people to stay in touch with them?

300
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,320
Rym: We're like, oh, we're all gonna have a party in December.

301
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:10,522
Rym: Well, I gotta call bill and Bill's got to call Joey Jojo Shabba do.

302
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:32,605
Rym: and By having this kind of social network situation It's a great way to use technology to coordinate among friends without having to put forth effort that if life gets Difficult or you don't have time you might not have time to do and then you lose touch with people that you didn't want to and If we didn't have our own social network already, we'd be all about the Facebook.

303
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:34,908
Rym: Yeah, not the myspace I guess just for me.

304
00:23:35,090 --> 00:24:00,673
Scott: I see that there has uses but doesn't have any uses for me and I also see a lot of people lately are Using it basically for promotional purposes and it's not always big companies doing marketing It's you know some guy with his blog, you know, he might use his Facebook quote legitimately But he also uses it to try to like push a blog story he wrote or something and I don't know if there's anything good or bad about that, but That's not

305
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:01,095
Rym: what

306
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:01,436
Scott: you know.

307
00:24:01,456 --> 00:24:07,989
Scott: if it's really a closed circle of friends who are you know You're you're real friends and you're just doing your stuff that friends do.

308
00:24:08,773 --> 00:24:15,762
Scott: That kind of stuff doesn't go down there really and that's why I kind of like Not using some social network like that.

309
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:17,570
Scott: That's all connected with a billion people.

310
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:18,576
Rym: I think the real issue.

311
00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:27,170
Rym: all the people who complain about social networks Complain about not so much the technology because they come they're really complaining about the fact that people use them.

312
00:24:27,873 --> 00:24:38,199
Rym: I don't want to say wrong, but a lot of people use social networks in ways that I feel personally are Counterproductive not possibly the best use of your time.

313
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:43,178
Scott: a lot of you like sit there and like they just sit on Facebook for a long time doing I don't know what like.

314
00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:47,798
Rym: it's some sort of video game or something or people who There's so many of these kids who date like.

315
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,067
Rym: how many friends they have is such a big deal.

316
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:59,630
Rym: and look at you see a lot of like 12 13 year old punk kids in Facebook or myspace and they have like 100,000 friends and their friends all have a hundred thousand friends and they're just trying to make this number go up.

317
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:10,470
Scott: There's really some sort of psychology in this of the software and I think that's what we really have to study is like the psychology of how people interact with because really all you're doing there might not be.

318
00:25:11,254 --> 00:25:16,690
Scott: Imagine if you're sitting at Facebook and it was exactly the way it is But on the other there were no actual real people using it.

319
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:36,649
Scott: It was just it's just you interacting with this, you know interface on a computer screen and there's a psychology to that that I think Gets people doing weird stuff When you study that Things of the day.

320
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:51,988
Rym: So, uh, I saw something today something bad Very bad real bad Disgusting, uh, let me put it this way this video is not that thing because I'm not gonna.

321
00:25:52,129 --> 00:26:01,756
Rym: I would never make something like that my thing of the day, but This video has a little bit of merit and basically I assume they got this grandmother's permission ahead of time.

322
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:05,226
Rym: like all right grandma We're gonna show you something disturbing.

323
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:07,071
Rym: Are you prepared to watch something disturbing?

324
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:08,555
Rym: How bad could it be sunny?

325
00:26:08,956 --> 00:26:10,179
Rym: Well, you're about to find out.

326
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:15,692
Scott: There's this new video going around the Internet Relatively new at least as far as I can tell.

327
00:26:15,793 --> 00:26:16,940
Rym: as in I didn't know about it.

328
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:23,140
Scott: I discovered it some listener sent it to me But I was at work and I turned it on and the first thing I saw in the video was some lesbian.

329
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:25,799
Scott: So I turned it off and then I was like what the hell's up with this.

330
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:28,311
Scott: I'm at work, dude, and he's like, oh, it's just the new.

331
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:29,496
Scott: it's basically the new goat.

332
00:26:29,516 --> 00:26:30,360
Scott: see the new tub girl.

333
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,660
Scott: You know you you saw those horrible pictures on the internet in the olden days.

334
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:39,945
Scott: Well, it's only a matter of time before there was a horrible video and here is the new Trump card.

335
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:42,097
Scott: as far as disgusting things on the internet go now

336
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:58,810
Rym: my thing of the day is a grandmother watching this thing and reacting to it and I Think I have to warn you about one thing one You might get the impression from watching the grandmother that it can't be that bad.

337
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,932
Rym: She's just a grandmother.

338
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:07,244
Rym: I Think I'm desensitized to Everything.

339
00:27:08,187 --> 00:27:09,812
Rym: I've never seen something more disgusting.

340
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:32,818
Rym: I don't recommend you watch it but yeah watch this grandma because there's one funny thing I can say is that hearing this music and kind of just the Background noise of that video just hearing that while the grandmother watches is in and of itself Hilarious and lends a very almost sinister quality to what might be going on on that screen.

341
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,103
Scott: Yeah It's like this.

342
00:27:34,123 --> 00:27:37,780
Scott: This is actually so disgusting that you don't want to watch it.

343
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,180
Scott: Like you can look at goatse and it's disgusting but you'll be alright.

344
00:27:41,441 --> 00:27:43,789
Rym: I mean there is something to say for desensitization.

345
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,820
Rym: I mean, yeah, I remember the first time I saw goatse.

346
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,514
Rym: I was in a Usenet or something somewhere and someone was like bla bla bla bla bla bla bla.

347
00:27:51,554 --> 00:27:52,136
Rym: goatse.

348
00:27:52,176 --> 00:27:53,460
Rym: someone else's like link.

349
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:54,246
Rym: What's this?

350
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:55,739
Rym: goatse and someone else like here it is.

351
00:27:55,983 --> 00:27:56,557
Rym: I was like, huh?

352
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,259
Rym: I wonder what that is click and it was awful and I didn't know what to do.

353
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:04,038
Rym: It was there looking at me and I was looking back at it.

354
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:07,130
Rym: I had stared into the abyss and the abyss had stared back at me.

355
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,856
Scott: and now goatse whatever.

356
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:09,860
Rym: goat sees nothing.

357
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:11,491
Rym: I could have a poster of.

358
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:18,215
Scott: goatse it wouldn't bother me Right, but this this new video relatively new video is just it's me.

359
00:28:18,275 --> 00:28:22,287
Scott: it has raised the bar on Disgusting and disturbing things on the internet.

360
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:31,350
Rym: I applaud you disgusting people for having done this but at the same time I think it's a bar that I hope is never raised higher.

361
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:32,634
Rym: But sadly I know will be.

362
00:28:32,655 --> 00:28:34,219
Scott: would you rather have not seen it?

363
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:35,269
Rym: You know what?

364
00:28:35,574 --> 00:28:37,829
Scott: Cuz I Avoid watching it.

365
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,300
Scott: I think I'm going to succeed on one end.

366
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:48,024
Rym: I thought I should avoid it But then I decided that it was intellectual curiosity in the sense that people are really making a shitstorm about how bad this is.

367
00:28:48,365 --> 00:28:55,638
Rym: and people made the same shitstorm when goatse and lemon party and tub girl and all those kind of horrible things were found by the internet.

368
00:28:55,658 --> 00:29:01,335
Rym: and This time the shitstorm is justified both in a metaphorical and a literal sense.

369
00:29:01,676 --> 00:29:12,680
Scott: Good God Yeah, but I take the the idea that rather than ever watch the disgusting thing itself Which I'm going to try to avoid doing because I really I mean I was listening.

370
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,893
Scott: I basically Rym was watching and I was just covering my eyes and listening.

371
00:29:15,933 --> 00:29:16,696
Rym: Let me put it this way.

372
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,553
Rym: I Am pretty cool-headed like there's not much people who know me.

373
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,560
Rym: that can I guess get my goat?

374
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:36,006
Rym: there's not much that'll cause me to scream or lose my temper or Get frightened or anything or startled or anything, but I was watching and I was thinking to myself I'm gonna sit here stoically and watch this.

375
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:37,289
Rym: How bad could it be?

376
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:39,775
Rym: and I could not help from saying.

377
00:29:39,795 --> 00:29:43,586
Rym: Oh my god Yeah, and then followed by that.

378
00:29:43,928 --> 00:29:44,630
Rym: Oh my god

379
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:59,612
Scott: Yeah, so if Rym Rym was act based on what I heard Rym said I knew this is probably something I wanted to avoid and I think the your best bet is to just watch People watching it to sort of get the idea of the terribleness

380
00:29:59,793 --> 00:30:02,040
Rym: kind of like when that guy showed Ron Jeremy goats.

381
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:12,420
Rym: You don't want to see goatse but seeing Ron Jeremy first looking at it and trying to figure out what it is and then Backing away in horror as he realizes what it is is priceless.

382
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:19,019
Scott: Yeah, so just watch this grandma watch the disgusting video and never watch the disgusting video yourself if you can help it.

383
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,660
Rym: However, I guess if something worse comes out I don't know.

384
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:32,250
Scott: Maybe maybe that if there if of a worse video comes out and you and you say that the the newer video is worse I will watch this this one that is new now.

385
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:35,120
Rym: So you're gonna stay out one step say one step behind.

386
00:30:37,262 --> 00:30:43,799
Rym: Well, I guess the same rule applies to a video cards and microprocessors as it does to disgusting videos something like that.

387
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:50,360
Rym: Alright, I remember way back when we were in college and we thought that but hot dog was the most disgusting thing ever made.

388
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,860
Scott: You know, I didn't think but hot dog was so disgusting was more humorous.

389
00:30:53,462 --> 00:30:56,031
Scott: I only thought sort of an x-rated Monty Python kind of way.

390
00:30:56,232 --> 00:31:04,704
Rym: I guess the only reason I didn't think it was funny I mean, I guess I could see it being funny if I knew it was faked or at least if the second half of it Was faked.

391
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:08,100
Scott: Oh all I remember was a butt and a hot dog coming out of it.

392
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:11,432
Rym: I think you forget the second half where someone eats a hot dog unawares.

393
00:31:12,014 --> 00:31:13,580
Rym: I thought that that's not cool.

394
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,214
Scott: Yeah, I thought that that was just a guy eating a separate hot dog and was edited.

395
00:31:17,897 --> 00:31:18,660
Rym: See that's the thing.

396
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:29,004
Rym: I hope it's that way that video is really funny if it's that way But if that is not in fact a cheap edit and that they did in fact feed that hot dog not cool Dude,

397
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:30,496
Scott: not cool at all

398
00:31:31,484 --> 00:31:31,927
Rym: Alright, so

399
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:39,880
Scott: whenever I can't find a thing of the day There is one thing in the world that I can always rely on to provide an incredibly humorous thing of the day.

400
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,520
Rym: Why would this be none other than the broadcast television of the great nation of Japan?

401
00:31:46,522 --> 00:31:47,979
Scott: Have you listened to GeekNights before?

402
00:31:49,162 --> 00:31:49,618
Scott: All right.

403
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:56,160
Rym: So, uh, what elaborate prank did the Japanese people beset upon some poor foreigner this time?

404
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:56,805
Scott: How did you know?

405
00:31:56,825 --> 00:31:58,720
Scott: was elaborate playing pulled out of order?

406
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:00,323
Rym: I don't know.

407
00:32:00,343 --> 00:32:04,599
Scott: a guess a hunch maybe a notion a because that's what it always is.

408
00:32:05,702 --> 00:32:07,600
Rym: Sometimes they get Japanese people All right.

409
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,459
Scott: So, you know, there's a sport of basically speed walking and I know a lot of people are like a speed walking.

410
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:13,884
Scott: stupid Bla bla bla screw you.

411
00:32:13,945 --> 00:32:14,949
Rym: it's good exercise.

412
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:20,209
Rym: It's really hard and it's while it's boring to watch It's not nearly as boring as NASCAR, right?

413
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:22,197
Scott: So basically what speed walking is?

414
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:28,235
Scott: if you don't know If you need to know what the word speed walking I'm gonna actually get tell you specifically it's.

415
00:32:28,295 --> 00:32:29,620
Scott: it's not just speed walking.

416
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:29,962
Scott: You see

417
00:32:30,164 --> 00:32:30,768
Rym: well it is I

418
00:32:31,212 --> 00:32:31,876
Scott: know but when

419
00:32:31,897 --> 00:32:32,219
Rym: a person

420
00:32:32,962 --> 00:32:51,160
Scott: When a human being runs right the the gate of a human being while running There is a point at which both feet are off the ground You're basically launching yourself into the air with one foot landing with the other foot launching yourself into the air again And it you know, it's sort of like, you know horses have different gates like a trot and again

421
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:55,854
Rym: Horses have a walk trot gallop and humans have walk skip run.

422
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:57,720
Rym: I'm not gonna get into skipping.

423
00:32:58,162 --> 00:32:59,186
Scott: Let's do a show on skipping.

424
00:32:59,246 --> 00:32:59,869
Rym: I think we should.

425
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:02,600
Rym: yeah, because right skipping gets a bad rap.

426
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:05,050
Scott: It does awesome, right but run.

427
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,944
Scott: basically you're in the air completely You might you're.

428
00:33:07,964 --> 00:33:10,060
Scott: basically you could even say you're jumping right?

429
00:33:11,785 --> 00:33:15,860
Scott: Walking Never when you're walking are both feet off the ground.

430
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:23,679
Scott: Simultaneously only one foot is off the ground at a time and you go one foot off the ground both feet on the ground one Foot on the ground both feet on the ground, right?

431
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:38,019
Scott: So speed walking is going as fast as you can But you always have at least one foot touching the ground always and when they when people do speed walking competitions They have like Pete judges watching their feet to make sure that always one foot is on the ground.

432
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:40,028
Scott: It's a really or else you're cheating.

433
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,277
Rym: It's really good exercise if you care.

434
00:33:42,297 --> 00:33:49,420
Scott: Yep Anyway, they have some like world champion speed walking guy from Latin America somewhere.

435
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,905
Rym: You sure he's not from Spain.

436
00:33:51,266 --> 00:33:52,069
Scott: He might be from Spain.

437
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:54,316
Scott: He speaks Spanish Portuguese something like that.

438
00:33:54,778 --> 00:33:55,400
Scott: I can't really tell.

439
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:55,842
Scott: I'm sorry.

440
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:56,766
Rym: I watched it once.

441
00:33:57,107 --> 00:34:03,154
Rym: my guess is that he is Spanish from the nation of Spain But I am probably wrong and I apologize.

442
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:03,918
Scott: I have no idea.

443
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:05,263
Scott: He's Hispanic.

444
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,830
Scott: so he the guy.

445
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:11,100
Scott: they bring him to Japan and they don't set this up in the video.

446
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:26,708
Scott: but apparently like he had watched some TV show like they had had a TV like I guess a closed-circuit TV like and they Tricked him into thinking that there was a prison nearby and that some dangerous Shinsengumi had broken out of the prison and

447
00:34:26,748 --> 00:34:30,360
Rym: they were going around killing people and they had all these extra security guards.

448
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,404
Scott: I saw the event.

449
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:35,906
Scott: they bring him to this track and they have him go around the track speed walking and you know He's going.

450
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:42,728
Scott: and they have these Samurai actors Shinsengumi guys and all these cops and his police.

451
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,346
Scott: and so they were wondering.

452
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:54,339
Scott: the question here is if you scare the Speed walking champion guy will he run or will he walk?

453
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,360
Rym: When Scott showed this to me and I'm watching all I could think was all right.

454
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:06,026
Rym: Is the guy Going to actually be afraid or not?

455
00:35:06,548 --> 00:35:07,771
Rym: and that just comes down to.

456
00:35:08,152 --> 00:35:11,240
Rym: does he know that samurai don't really exist anymore?

457
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:15,938
Rym: Has he ever watched Japanese television or does he know anything about Japan?

458
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:22,620
Scott: Yeah So basically he goes around the track the samurai come out and they cut down some guards or pretend to cut down.

459
00:35:22,681 --> 00:35:23,572
Rym: Well, it's so clever.

460
00:35:23,592 --> 00:35:24,180
Rym: It starts out.

461
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,420
Rym: We're like they walk out like ah, and they kick down like this trash can and make a bunch of noise.

462
00:35:28,621 --> 00:35:29,464
Scott: They're pretty good actors.

463
00:35:29,926 --> 00:35:36,330
Rym: and you see the guy Turner like he hears the noise and the video like he looks back a little bit And he sees some commotion and looks forward again.

464
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,434
Rym: cuz he's got to keep his pace.

465
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:40,466
Rym: It's kind of hard to speed run and Then he'd walk.

466
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:41,272
Rym: the speed walk.

467
00:35:41,353 --> 00:35:43,767
Rym: Yes speed running Slow running.

468
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:45,320
Scott: Yeah, we should have the slowest running.

469
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,575
Scott: You have to take both feet off the ground with every step, but you can't.

470
00:35:49,595 --> 00:35:50,920
Rym: was a Calvin and Hobbes about that?

471
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:52,959
Rym: I believe Hobbes just started going backwards.

472
00:35:53,616 --> 00:36:02,300
Scott: Oh Anyway, I would just stand there with one foot on the ground and one foot off the ground and be like I'm still taking my first run step here.

473
00:36:02,681 --> 00:36:15,040
Rym: but the moment when I like the moment of truth in this video as I'm watching it and Scott's just watching me watch it because You know that the greatest pleasure in the world after already experiencing something is watching someone else experience the exact same thing.

474
00:36:15,522 --> 00:36:17,289
Rym: That's why I can watch you 10 a thousand times.

475
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:18,474
Rym: I always show it to someone new.

476
00:36:18,835 --> 00:36:31,732
Rym: Yep, but He turns around a second time to see the guard being cut down by the Shinsengumi in epic fashion and At that moment you can see his face and Scott.

477
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:33,338
Rym: What was the expression on his face?

478
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:33,699
Rym: Was it?

479
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,947
Rym: Haha, they're playing a joke or was it?

480
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:36,750
Rym: Oh my god.

481
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,594
Rym: I'm going to die.

482
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:39,100
Scott: I think it was oh shit.

483
00:36:39,885 --> 00:36:41,396
Rym: The guy was afraid he he.

484
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:45,618
Scott: Yeah, he was actually afraid of getting killed by these samurai.

485
00:36:45,638 --> 00:36:47,987
Scott: So You can watch the video for yourself.

486
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:49,935
Rym: it's uh epic.

487
00:36:50,196 --> 00:36:51,160
Scott: I think it's a funny video.

488
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:57,893
Rym: It's not as good as perhaps my favorite video ever which is Yordle going on top of the building while someone's using it.

489
00:36:58,436 --> 00:37:01,227
Scott: That's a good one But I actually that's my second favorite.

490
00:37:01,267 --> 00:37:06,024
Scott: my number one low ski slope is in in the sauna and then up You're outside in the snow.

491
00:37:06,044 --> 00:37:13,127
Rym: I think the best part of the sauna one was that oh, no, you're in the snow naked But the wall goes right back up.

492
00:37:13,588 --> 00:37:17,180
Rym: so you look around and you're just some idiot who's out naked in the snow.

493
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:19,006
Rym: There's no explanation for that.

494
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:21,757
Rym: someone walking by wouldn't think oh he got pranked.

495
00:37:21,777 --> 00:37:22,640
Rym: Well, I guess he's in Japan.

496
00:37:22,722 --> 00:37:23,700
Rym: They think well he got pranked.

497
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:28,518
Rym: Someone normal walking by would think wow that guy's naked and outside on a mountain.

498
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:29,060
Scott: What the fuck?

499
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,707
Scott: I just got there's nothing.

500
00:37:30,868 --> 00:37:31,753
Scott: I gotta say this again.

501
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:34,666
Scott: I don't know how many times I'm gonna say this There's nothing more in this world.

502
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:50,360
Scott: Probably not much more that I want more more More than Then for someone to do a Japanese style prank show in the United States and to have a fat and dignified person get caught in It.

503
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,105
Rym: that reminds me of an email.

504
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:54,586
Rym: We just got.

505
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,789
Rym: I think I'll use that as a geek back next week.

506
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:57,469
Scott: Go for it.

507
00:37:58,312 --> 00:38:06,389
Rym: But also I would just like to note kind of a rhetorical question What does it say about Japan as a nation and as a people?

508
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:26,082
Rym: Where in wherein their television will go to such lengths to find Someone who is world famous in a sport who is a foreigner discover whether or not they know if samurai exist or not and Then fly them to Japan With no goal at all other than

509
00:38:26,142 --> 00:38:28,610
Scott: I think he might have been there for some speed walking competitions.

510
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:31,680
Rym: Maybe maybe not maybe not.

511
00:38:31,901 --> 00:38:32,664
Rym: I would believe.

512
00:38:32,885 --> 00:38:36,077
Rym: I wouldn't faze me at all If there was no purpose to this.

513
00:38:36,237 --> 00:38:40,030
Rym: they had flown him out just to prank him that I would believe it.

514
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,626
Rym: But I don't think it's true, but just the sheer level of preparation.

515
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:44,570
Rym: My head is off.

516
00:38:45,612 --> 00:38:46,602
Scott: Yes quite so.

517
00:38:46,622 --> 00:38:46,663
Scott: so.

518
00:38:48,931 --> 00:38:49,994
Scott: So what are we talking about?

519
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,180
Rym: I think it was musical instruments.

520
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:55,890
Rym: Okay, maybe we should talk about why we're talking about musical instruments.

521
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,698
Rym: Saxophones see tubas are nice.

522
00:38:57,979 --> 00:39:00,370
Rym: I like sousaphones, but tubas are much superior.

523
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:11,030
Scott: Well, I think I can explain the musical instrument show by telling my personal history of musical instrument playing Which is which isn't too long unlike rims, which is much longer, but it does lead up to something very important that.

524
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:18,069
Rym: Actually, I kind of feel like it'd be cool If all of you kind of I don't know joined in with us on this, but we'll get to that at the very end.

525
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:24,483
Scott: Alright, so I was a little kid and when you're a little kid musical instruments you had a toy xylophone.

526
00:39:24,503 --> 00:39:30,750
Scott: I had a Harmonica like it one the kind that has two rows of holes one on top of the other and then I basically couldn't play it.

527
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,950
Scott: When I was a kid my favorite one move it back and forth.

528
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:39,016
Rym: I had a toy trumpet that had some buttons and all you had to do was blow into the mouthpiece and it made it Like a recorder sound.

529
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,890
Scott: I had a record when I got to like fourth grade.

530
00:39:42,091 --> 00:39:48,030
Scott: Well, actually, you know in elementary school There was a band but they're like ten kids in it because I think you had to pay a ludicrous amount of money.

531
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:49,946
Scott: I couldn't even figure out how to get into it, right?

532
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:55,339
Scott: Because You know the school wasn't paying for bands anymore.

533
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:03,050
Scott: and I think event by the time I was done with elementary school There was no more elementary school band, you know a few schools pay for musical instruments.

534
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:13,125
Scott: I mean you could join the band, but you gotta buy your trumpet, you know We had music class in elementary school But it was basically like this There's like some bongos and like a crappy little kids xylophone and maybe those.

535
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:14,370
Scott: what are those like little?

536
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:21,706
Scott: It's not like a harp but it like it lies flat and it's got a lot of strings but glockenspiel No, it's like a little tiny one for kids.

537
00:40:21,968 --> 00:40:24,481
Scott: Oh Xylophone no, it's strange.

538
00:40:24,782 --> 00:40:25,365
Scott: It's strings.

539
00:40:25,586 --> 00:40:26,510
Scott: Oh pluck the strings.

540
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:30,904
Rym: But it's like it's a little higher a lute a banjo a guitar.

541
00:40:30,924 --> 00:40:32,730
Scott: I'm maybe is it a clavichord?

542
00:40:33,252 --> 00:40:33,854
Rym: Doesn't matter.

543
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:34,516
Scott: I don't know.

544
00:40:34,577 --> 00:40:38,250
Scott: but you know, you know, I would just play little instruments in the class or whatever.

545
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,093
Scott: What you know what?

546
00:40:39,113 --> 00:40:40,036
Rym: I didn't even get instruments.

547
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:45,598
Rym: my music classes in elementary school consisted of either a horrible she-bitch of a nun Yelling at us.

548
00:40:45,658 --> 00:40:51,036
Scott: It's not a clavichord Scott was.

549
00:40:51,077 --> 00:40:52,429
Rym: Wikipedia equals win.

550
00:40:53,441 --> 00:41:03,517
Rym: but Or when I finally got to you know A public elementary school where I didn't have a nun yelling at me all the time for asking questions Like how come God doesn't do this?

551
00:41:03,637 --> 00:41:05,985
Rym: or what about Darwin, but I digress.

552
00:41:06,226 --> 00:41:06,466
Scott: Okay.

553
00:41:06,486 --> 00:41:07,470
Scott: I'm trying to figure out what it is.

554
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:12,850
Scott: It's like a harpsichord, but it's like you could sit on your lap and there's no keys to sit the strings.

555
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,861
Scott: You just hit him with your fingers Scott a harpsichord has keys.

556
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:20,729
Rym: That's like I know but a mental part of our Looks like it looks like a harpsichord string.

557
00:41:21,531 --> 00:41:25,656
Rym: That's like saying a guitar just like a piano but instead of keys You just kind of stick your hand.

558
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:27,306
Scott: anyone knows this instrument is just tell me.

559
00:41:27,347 --> 00:41:32,649
Scott: but anyway All right, so that and they also made us play the recorder and everyone had to buy a recorder.

560
00:41:32,669 --> 00:41:38,050
Rym: Oh Recorders that most wonderful of it actually kind of like the recorder and I would always play.

561
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:39,229
Rym: Oh, I like recorders.

562
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:47,610
Rym: I don't like being in fifth grade 40 kids who all have recorders and there's no teacher in the room or there's a substitute teacher wearing earplugs.

563
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:49,310
Scott: Yeah, and you know what?

564
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,175
Scott: I learned how to play on the recorder.

565
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:55,448
Rym: do hot cross bun was that hot cross bun.

566
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:57,195
Scott: I learned I learned Something.

567
00:41:57,215 --> 00:42:05,679
Scott: hot cross bun Like every toy instrument I had because that's pretty much ours I can tell the easiest song to play.

568
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:13,212
Rym: and who could forget the flute?

569
00:42:14,036 --> 00:42:15,241
Scott: oh yeah all right.

570
00:42:15,262 --> 00:42:17,351
Rym: so we're trying to play a song on one of those doesn't happen.

571
00:42:17,572 --> 00:42:20,722
Scott: no it's like clowns use it.

572
00:42:20,742 --> 00:42:28,454
Scott: so I started actually playing an instrument for reals in fifth grade when I went and took guitar lessons for reals like at the YMCA.

573
00:42:28,474 --> 00:42:36,075
Scott: so I went to the YMCA and there are a whole bunch of kids and this one guy taught everyone how to play guitar and I was one of like the three kids who didn't suck royally.

574
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:48,939
Scott: so we eventually they moved you know he taught the whole mess of kids at one hour and then he taught me and the two other kids who didn't suck in like the second hour you know and then eventually those two kids who are they also didn't suck.

575
00:42:48,979 --> 00:42:57,607
Scott: I don't know what happened to them but I eventually like took private lessons with the guy at the local YMCA and I was playing this guitar that my grandparents had in their basement like forever.

576
00:42:58,029 --> 00:42:59,478
Scott: it's like it came from like Mexico.

577
00:42:59,498 --> 00:43:00,644
Scott: it was like one of those you know.

578
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:04,408
Scott: you know the kind of acoustic guitar that a Mexican guy plays in Mexican restaurant.

579
00:43:04,428 --> 00:43:05,011
Scott: you know that's.

580
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:16,323
Scott: that's what it sounded like and I was okay at it but I never really practiced it and I would just go to the lesson every week you know and I would be better at it each week from the lesson.

581
00:43:16,383 --> 00:43:26,988
Scott: but I wasn't practicing or trying to get better or anything and you know I I didn't really appreciate it or enjoy it as much as I you know as I should have I guess so.

582
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:37,998
Scott: in sixth grade when there was actually a band in school to join I joined the school band because the other choices they only had three choices which is music theory band and chorus and I wasn't gonna sing.

583
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,249
Rym: well you had to pick a music of some kind.

584
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:41,375
Scott: I had to pick one of the three.

585
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,523
Scott: that's great.

586
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:48,699
Scott: actually I think that more schools should do that yeah and music theory was basically the cop-out joke for people who didn't want to actually do anything.

587
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,361
Rym: oh man cuz music theory in my high school was oh my god middle school.

588
00:43:53,381 --> 00:44:01,614
Scott: this is middle school is middle school and music theory was basically you know get to play with keyboards and MIDI kinda and not really.

589
00:44:02,076 --> 00:44:10,593
Scott: so I took band and I played the clarinet because guitar was not an instrument in the band right and you know I kind of like the klezmer action.

590
00:44:10,634 --> 00:44:14,260
Scott: that's that's why I chose that more than the other things plus the clarinet was cheaper than some of the other.

591
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:18,884
Scott: I guess drums are the cheapest but I actually wanted to do something that took more skills.

592
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:25,072
Rym: drums are the cheapest in that all you need to practice especially the school provided the drums.

593
00:44:25,092 --> 00:44:26,219
Scott: so you just have to buy drumsticks.

594
00:44:26,561 --> 00:44:27,446
Rym: that's why it was the cheapest.

595
00:44:27,547 --> 00:44:30,866
Rym: also they were to made you buy a practice pad which is great ten bucks.

596
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:36,092
Rym: yeah it's a little pad and you can play like a snare drum on it but you're not gonna make a lot of noise.

597
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:37,901
Rym: make your mom kill you exactly.

598
00:44:38,002 --> 00:44:41,500
Scott: so I played the clarinet and I was actually not too bad at it.

599
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:50,199
Rym: you know I was what now clarinets a good choice because if you want to be all cool with it it's not a far cry to go from clarinet to soprano saxophone.

600
00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:51,745
Rym: well which is awesome.

601
00:44:51,885 --> 00:44:52,708
Scott: I should.

602
00:44:52,748 --> 00:44:54,175
Scott: I could have just chosen saxophone right.

603
00:44:54,215 --> 00:44:56,086
Rym: no you don't want it all the kid.

604
00:44:56,146 --> 00:44:58,721
Rym: it seems like a lot of people who get into music with their kids.

605
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:03,909
Rym: they're like they look and they don't think about what they'd actually want to play or what they'd be good at.

606
00:45:04,251 --> 00:45:12,650
Rym: they think about what looks cool and what looks cooler than either a gigantic tuba that's bigger than you or maybe a drum set even though to give you a drum.

607
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,090
Scott: so why is it always that the really like tall people who play the trombone?

608
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:23,229
Rym: I don't get it you know what I'll get to that because there are there's in people who play music not just in like high schools and whatever that I know.

609
00:45:23,249 --> 00:45:26,913
Rym: a lot of you are in high school in college and playing in bands but even out in the real gig.

610
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:32,002
Rym: in world there's kind of stereotypes about who plays different instruments and I don't know if it's.

611
00:45:32,182 --> 00:45:38,638
Scott: I think this is psychology of it like personality and you look at the instruments like the way they look appeals to a certain personality.

612
00:45:38,678 --> 00:45:47,876
Scott: so when you aren't already a musician and you're thinking about and you're thinking about becoming one you look at the instruments and different looks and sounds of different instruments appeal to different types of see.

613
00:45:48,198 --> 00:45:49,325
Scott: I don't know because it makes sense.

614
00:45:49,345 --> 00:45:52,158
Scott: that's just my the other my other.

615
00:45:52,338 --> 00:46:07,623
Rym: it might be a kind of self-perpetuating cycle where the people who get kids into music and the people who know music and teach music the way they teach different instruments appeal to different kinds of people more due to the instruction and the culture could be possible too.

616
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:10,356
Rym: but everyone wants to play the goddamn saxophone.

617
00:46:10,556 --> 00:46:12,123
Scott: yes there are a lot more sack.

618
00:46:12,424 --> 00:46:20,066
Scott: if the band teacher had chosen like I need this many this and this many this and this many this to get the best sound which we did there would have been a far fewer.

619
00:46:20,106 --> 00:46:22,378
Scott: sad as middle school there had been far fewer sex.

620
00:46:22,419 --> 00:46:23,384
Rym: I'm talking about middle school.

621
00:46:23,665 --> 00:46:31,386
Rym: okay you realize pretty much everyone wanted to play the saxophone in my middle school and they said they're only going to be 12 saxophone players.

622
00:46:31,648 --> 00:46:33,294
Rym: we are going to choose based on it.

623
00:46:33,795 --> 00:46:35,601
Rym: well I'll get to that anyway.

624
00:46:36,103 --> 00:46:41,066
Scott: so I played the clarinet and I played the clarinet for three years and I didn't really practice it.

625
00:46:41,186 --> 00:46:51,837
Scott: but despite my almost complete lack of practicing I was able to play all the songs for all the concerts and I was one of the like top three clarinet people in the middle school and in high school.

626
00:46:51,957 --> 00:47:05,117
Scott: the first year sort of by momentum I kept playing but I didn't want to join the marching band and they basically came down to the middle school and they were like join the marching band and I was like uh and I you know I thought about it.

627
00:47:05,137 --> 00:47:08,920
Scott: I was like I don't want to do that right now I'll go to high school and I'll play in the.

628
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:11,617
Scott: you could play in the concert band which is basically more of this.

629
00:47:11,757 --> 00:47:25,840
Scott: you know the same thing only you know in high school with the high school people and I'm like if I want to do the marching band I'll just start in the second year whatever right and in high school I just sort of got really disinterested entirely.

630
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:36,245
Scott: I was like oh yeah I don't really care so much about this anymore and I was still like one of the top five people in the concert band with the clarinet and there's reasons for that.

631
00:47:36,406 --> 00:47:42,733
Scott: yeah because I actually you know I knew how to read music and play it and I played well and I tried.

632
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:45,686
Scott: it just didn't practice in my spare time or enjoy it very much.

633
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:55,771
Scott: so I didn't join the marching band and after my first year of high school playing the clarinet I gave up the clarinet and then I didn't play a musical instrument for a while.

634
00:47:56,032 --> 00:47:58,161
Scott: and the problem was right.

635
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:06,915
Scott: is that in my later high school years like starting in 11th and 12th grade I realized I had made a miscalculation earlier in my life?

636
00:48:07,457 --> 00:48:11,854
Scott: oh yes you see remember in fifth grade I played that guitar with that guy.

637
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:13,884
Scott: I know I was not appreciating very much.

638
00:48:14,627 --> 00:48:18,165
Scott: and then in sixth grade I picked up the clarinet instead and I dropped the guitar.

639
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:21,138
Scott: and then by ninth grade I was not appreciating that either.

640
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:34,957
Scott: but starting around 11th grade I started to appreciate the guitar a lot more but I did not know how to play it anymore and I thought well all those awesome guitar people they've been playing since they were like three.

641
00:48:34,977 --> 00:48:36,445
Scott: what's the point?

642
00:48:36,485 --> 00:48:38,576
Scott: even starting now I can't even afford a guitar.

643
00:48:38,978 --> 00:48:42,614
Scott: that old one was like piece of shit and the neck is all warped and whatever.

644
00:48:42,735 --> 00:48:45,967
Scott: and it's I don't have time for it's not gonna happen.

645
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:57,817
Scott: even though I was sort of basically I didn't really have the urge to start playing the guitar even though I thought it would be fun to like have an electric guitar with the distortion all up and start you know just hitting the strings to make it go down.

646
00:48:57,998 --> 00:48:58,701
Scott: I thought that'd be cool.

647
00:48:58,721 --> 00:49:02,356
Scott: but other than that I didn't really want to learn or have time or care.

648
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:06,714
Scott: but I was sort of sort of sad that I lost the opportunity to.

649
00:49:06,734 --> 00:49:12,618
Scott: I was I kept thinking like man if I had not stopped playing the guitar I'll be badass right now.

650
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:24,426
Scott: damn it yeah because even people and this is like think about it if I hadn't stopped ever right now like the podcast would be like opening and closing with Scott rocking out I'd be like the only reason.

651
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:30,078
Rym: it's not Rym on a trumpet it's just that I haven't played the trumpet much in the last I don't know three years.

652
00:49:30,138 --> 00:49:33,094
Scott: yeah I mean I was really good at learning musical instruments.

653
00:49:33,154 --> 00:49:42,130
Scott: I had a skill I wasn't like a you know sort of a awesome kind of gonna be the best in the world you know Steve Vai kind of amazingness.

654
00:49:42,472 --> 00:49:45,106
Scott: but I was good at learning musical instruments and playing them.

655
00:49:45,126 --> 00:49:51,417
Scott: I just didn't enjoy it so much when I was young so I gave it up and then I was upset later that I gave it up.

656
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,337
Scott: so recently I've been thinking you know I don't get to tell my story.

657
00:49:55,498 --> 00:49:57,995
Scott: oh you want to tell your story first I do and then and then I'll do the.

658
00:49:58,035 --> 00:49:58,982
Rym: recently I think we should.

659
00:49:59,002 --> 00:50:00,593
Rym: we want to end on the the important part.

660
00:50:00,714 --> 00:50:03,249
Rym: okay cuz the important part is kind of cool all right.

661
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:04,174
Scott: so tell your story.

662
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:06,488
Rym: we've gone on a while because we talked a lot in the beginning.

663
00:50:06,508 --> 00:50:07,071
Rym: that's fine.

664
00:50:07,131 --> 00:50:07,755
Rym: so I'm gonna give up.

665
00:50:07,775 --> 00:50:11,076
Rym: whatever people enjoy this episode I think yeah I think they will but I'm still.

666
00:50:11,479 --> 00:50:28,816
Rym: I'll qualify all this by saying that I'm going to give a very abbreviated history because unlike Scott it's not just that I was really into music or I was good at it or anything but I was into music to the point that I was very close to going to school for music and be a professional musician.

667
00:50:29,218 --> 00:50:47,305
Rym: instead of going into computers I had a full ride to Arizona State and a couple other places with band scholarship whatever and I was pretty much 50/50 computers trumpets and I kind of chose to go to RIT and I kind of chose to do IT and all that stuff kind of on a total whim.

668
00:50:47,325 --> 00:50:48,148
Rym: uh-huh.

669
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:59,064
Rym: but to skip all my early childhood where you know my parents bought me a million million instruments and I had a harmonica and I had a recorder and I had an ocarina and I had a little electric keyboard a Casio and

670
00:50:59,105 --> 00:51:02,182
Scott: then I had a little tiny electric keyboard too but I couldn't play for shit.

671
00:51:02,282 --> 00:51:04,455
Scott: actually we had a real piano in my.

672
00:51:04,475 --> 00:51:06,043
Scott: we still have that piano in my house.

673
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:14,140
Scott: it's not a grand piano it's the stand-up tall kind that you always see in saloons and I think my grandmother bought it like a zillion years ago.

674
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:25,986
Scott: well I guess not a zillion but you know 50 years ago did they either paid $50 or like $500 for I think was $500 for that piano way back which is a ludicrous price for a piano.

675
00:51:26,006 --> 00:51:27,592
Scott: of course I think these are like.

676
00:51:28,014 --> 00:51:32,734
Rym: you know how much pianos cost a lot yeah which is why it was a great price.

677
00:51:32,795 --> 00:51:34,023
Rym: okay ludicrous isn't good.

678
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:35,592
Rym: for some reason I was thinking ludicrous of course.

679
00:51:35,712 --> 00:51:40,072
Scott: I think those are like 1960s dollars or not maybe even 1950s I don't know.

680
00:51:40,152 --> 00:51:41,538
Scott: but we still have the piano.

681
00:51:41,558 --> 00:51:42,422
Scott: it's still in tune.

682
00:51:42,844 --> 00:51:50,641
Scott: my brother took piano lessons and then he stopped too and he was in the marching band whatever but they don't care brother suffice to say I really like.

683
00:51:50,681 --> 00:52:01,853
Rym: I played the piano a lot and by playing the piano even my grandma had this old Hammond organ and I had a Casio keyboard and I just sit there kind of banging on it and trying to make it sound good and

684
00:52:02,275 --> 00:52:04,326
Scott: I could never make my little Casio keyboard sound good.

685
00:52:04,568 --> 00:52:06,016
Rym: well it didn't for a long time.

686
00:52:06,036 --> 00:52:16,934
Rym: but I kind of taught myself music by ear and I started like I didn't know any words for two terms forward but I knew the difference between major keys and minor keys and I'd kind of figured out a lot of it on my own as a kid.

687
00:52:16,974 --> 00:52:32,580
Scott: see at when I learned to play musical instruments basically all I did was I was I taught myself to look at musical notes you know musical score and translate that into the you know movements of my hands and mouth or whatever to actually make that music play.

688
00:52:32,621 --> 00:52:36,498
Scott: I never understood or learned the music theory or any of that.

689
00:52:36,598 --> 00:52:39,776
Scott: majors minors that stuff still completely eludes me I don't get it.

690
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:46,331
Rym: see I started I never tried to learn I never understood it and I think that for most people to be to become great as opposed to just good.

691
00:52:46,391 --> 00:52:58,762
Rym: that is beyond a requirement not just to know it but to I would say start with that at least a basic understanding of being I mean I guess there's talent in skill and I think you can get skilled.

692
00:52:58,802 --> 00:53:03,080
Rym: you can probably be the best instrument player in the world on all skill or all talent.

693
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:15,576
Rym: but I feel like having the talent or even building up the skill first of being able to kind of hear and play by ear and just understand what sounds good and what doesn't even if you don't necessarily understand why.

694
00:53:15,617 --> 00:53:21,746
Rym: but just knowing kind of intuitively what will sound good will make you a much better musician in the long run.

695
00:53:21,787 --> 00:53:22,952
Scott: yeah I had nothing.

696
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:38,070
Scott: all I could do is look at notes on paper or look at some sort of you know thing on you know some sort of symbology and then you know figure out which you know mechanics that I had to perform to make that turn into music.

697
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,096
Scott: and that's all I ever learned.

698
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,102
Scott: but I was really good at it.

699
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:43,480
Rym: yeah but I mean I dabbled in the piano and I still dabble.

700
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,514
Rym: I consider myself a mediocre piano player at best.

701
00:53:46,936 --> 00:53:49,947
Rym: I would say so well I can play by ear I just I can't.

702
00:53:50,408 --> 00:53:55,593
Rym: I don't have piano skill I have music skills so I know what chords I know what melody or I know what I want.

703
00:53:56,055 --> 00:54:04,567
Rym: but basically I had my left hand just kind of bangs itself against the keyboard ineffectively but my real instrument that.

704
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:11,324
Rym: the reason I really got into music was that you know fourth grade fifth grade it's time to pick an instrument going to the band because it's.

705
00:54:11,746 --> 00:54:15,690
Rym: it was pretty much a foregone conclusion for my parents that I was going to join the band in school.

706
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:18,235
Rym: so we had Mr.

707
00:54:18,275 --> 00:54:32,069
Rym: Danforth who was this ancient, gigantically fat man who was a professional musician for most of his life and was in the military band and fought in World War II I'll get to why that was important and he wore.

708
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,193
Rym: every time we had a concert.

709
00:54:33,213 --> 00:54:39,398
Rym: I remember he wore a tuxedo that was perhaps one second at any time from exploding.

710
00:54:40,181 --> 00:54:42,030
Scott: is that why you always see that joke on Looney Tunes?

711
00:54:42,191 --> 00:54:47,800
Scott: like the guys were in the tux the conductor and like the front part just like rolls up like this guy.

712
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,385
Rym: was that guy awesome?

713
00:54:49,546 --> 00:54:51,452
Rym: but he taught in a very old school way.

714
00:54:51,473 --> 00:54:56,409
Rym: very lives very this kind of like Prussian military band style.

715
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:57,776
Rym: but he came to our elementary school.

716
00:54:57,796 --> 00:54:59,304
Rym: he's like are you kids?

717
00:54:59,746 --> 00:55:08,625
Rym: we're gonna figure out what instruments you're good at and then if you want to join the band I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna play and you had to apply to play an instrument.

718
00:55:09,087 --> 00:55:21,625
Rym: so pretty much the people who he based on his years of experience thought would be the best at X instrument would be the ones playing X instrument and you had no say at all other than you kind of had like a second choice.

719
00:55:21,686 --> 00:55:31,500
Rym: but if you wanted to play the saxophone and he already decided that six other kids were better at the saxophone than you you weren't gonna play the saxophone no matter what your parents yelled and screamed about mm-hmm.

720
00:55:32,002 --> 00:55:37,130
Rym: and I had this realization because he brought one of every instrument and one of every mouthpiece.

721
00:55:37,451 --> 00:55:42,632
Rym: he passed them all out and I had a clarinet read and I went and nothing happened.

722
00:55:43,195 --> 00:55:44,482
Rym: he didn't really tell us what to do.

723
00:55:44,502 --> 00:55:47,396
Rym: we just kind of wanted to see who could figure it out intuitively.

724
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:54,752
Rym: give you a trumpet mouthpiece and I thought I have a trumpet at home that toy trumpet because I was a little kid and I blew in it and it went.

725
00:55:54,772 --> 00:55:58,783
Rym: yep that wasn't what I had to do.

726
00:55:58,803 --> 00:56:09,791
Rym: no and basically no one made any noises except some squeaking awful awful noises from the saxophone mouthpieces and two people broke oboe reeds before he stopped handing those out.

727
00:56:10,654 --> 00:56:18,225
Rym: so then he explains how to play them all and we pass them all around again and I wasn't able to make anything sound except the trumpet.

728
00:56:18,346 --> 00:56:22,543
Rym: I made a trumpet buzz it went and it sounded kind of like a little fart.

729
00:56:23,205 --> 00:56:29,156
Rym: and then after we did all this he administered all these tests where we had to listen to two notes and say if they were different.

730
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:35,293
Rym: basically he was testing to see if any of us had perfect pitch and if you had perfect pitch you were guaranteed a spot in the band no matter what.

731
00:56:35,715 --> 00:56:37,322
Rym: and then from there he kind of.

732
00:56:37,624 --> 00:56:43,089
Rym: he basically tested us to see who would be a good musician and he wouldn't let anyone else join the band.

733
00:56:43,813 --> 00:56:50,930
Rym: yeah and then we had to rank what instruments we wanted to play and he matched that up based on how good he thought we were and some other factors.

734
00:56:51,111 --> 00:56:59,103
Rym: and my logic for playing the trumpet was very simple being a fourth grader or fifth grader I forget which might have been fifth grade he's.

735
00:56:59,244 --> 00:57:08,257
Rym: I said to myself all right saxophone has like 40 buttons trombone has no buttons but it's not discreet and I'm worried by that.

736
00:57:08,277 --> 00:57:10,786
Rym: off tube is too big.

737
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:12,251
Rym: all those things are too big.

738
00:57:12,573 --> 00:57:14,079
Rym: that trumpet only has three buttons.

739
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:15,103
Rym: how hard could it be?

740
00:57:15,123 --> 00:57:22,987
Rym: yeah so I wanted to be a trumpet player and that is what began my illustrious career.

741
00:57:23,689 --> 00:57:27,183
Rym: now the funny thing is I learned later after a few weeks.

742
00:57:27,746 --> 00:57:38,208
Rym: one day he went around the room and he talked about how the old school away like how when he was a kid you know in like 1700 how you would decide who would play an instrument.

743
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:46,800
Rym: and he went down the line of trumpet players and he pointed at us one by one and he's like trombone clarinet trombone.

744
00:57:47,703 --> 00:57:50,315
Rym: you wouldn't be in a band you'd be an English trumpet player.

745
00:57:50,415 --> 00:57:50,918
Rym: what's that mean?

746
00:57:50,938 --> 00:57:51,964
Rym: it means you'd be bad yeah.

747
00:57:52,748 --> 00:57:55,685
Rym: and he said like three of us would be trumpet players and I was one of them.

748
00:57:56,289 --> 00:57:58,967
Rym: and then he did the same thing for the saxophones the tubas and everything.

749
00:57:59,007 --> 00:58:01,398
Rym: and then at the end he started explaining why.

750
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:13,537
Rym: and basically being good at a brass instrument and this seems to be fairly true comes down a lot to not necessarily practice or skill or talent.

751
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:16,268
Rym: but what kind of lips you were born with?

752
00:58:16,288 --> 00:58:17,213
Scott: well couldn't you?

753
00:58:17,314 --> 00:58:18,522
Scott: that's something I never understood.

754
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:20,816
Scott: it's like okay obviously better lips.

755
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,612
Scott: you know different kind of shape you're better at playing the instrument.

756
00:58:23,692 --> 00:58:27,556
Scott: it's more than just you make a different mouthpiece that would accommodate different lips.

757
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,672
Rym: see you can and that you're all sorts of kinds of mouthpieces.

758
00:58:30,933 --> 00:58:42,892
Rym: the problem is there's trade-offs in both directions and if you have quote-unquote crappy lips for playing the trumpet or the trombone you can still make a trombone make a trombone noise but it's not gonna sound good.

759
00:58:42,912 --> 00:58:50,932
Rym: it's gonna be bad tone usually and you can try to train yourself but if your lips aren't thick enough or whatever you're probably gonna hurt yourself.

760
00:58:50,973 --> 00:59:05,767
Rym: there are a lot of people who play the trumpet or some instrument and they cause permanent nerve damage or otherwise damage themselves from playing an instrument just because their lips weren't strong enough or thick enough or whatever to deal with the insane amount of pressure they were applying.

761
00:59:06,249 --> 00:59:11,453
Rym: and they were applying that pressure because they didn't have the whatever to actually do it properly.

762
00:59:11,493 --> 00:59:26,193
Rym: they couldn't make a proper embouchure and I guess you could try to make some fancy sort of mouthpiece or some special instrument but there are reasons why that doesn't work so well and I should probably skip all that because I could go on for hours about the theory of making a proper trumpet embouchure.

763
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:27,540
Rym: all right I'll say.

764
00:59:27,701 --> 00:59:30,798
Rym: however that is very similar to the proper embouchure for an oboe mm-hmm.

765
00:59:30,918 --> 00:59:33,170
Rym: surprisingly but yeah skip a whole bunch.

766
00:59:33,913 --> 00:59:43,565
Rym: I was real good at the trumpet real good I got to high school and I went to a high school that was different from the high school I should have gone to because my family moved so they wouldn't let me play the trumpet.

767
00:59:43,585 --> 00:59:46,764
Rym: there were already like 30 trumpet players because we were a really big marching band.

768
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:51,769
Rym: so I had to play the mellophone which is basically a bastardized French horn that you.

769
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:58,186
Rym: that kind of looks like a flugelhorn that you play in a marching band even though cool people can march with a French horn but you probably shouldn't.

770
00:59:58,206 --> 01:00:01,299
Rym: anyway I'll skip all that and I was real good at it.

771
01:00:01,962 --> 01:00:08,124
Rym: and then after that you know marching season ends and we have to audition to join the band again.

772
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:14,098
Rym: it's not just like a lot of schools kind of like my middle school was I guess I was lucky where if you want to be in the band you're in the band.

773
01:00:14,158 --> 01:00:23,239
Rym: no you had to audition and if you weren't good as in pretty damn good you were in the concert band which basically meant you're not going anywhere.

774
01:00:23,299 --> 01:00:25,330
Rym: you're gonna play kind of crappy music forever.

775
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,515
Rym: people get a credit and that's it.

776
01:00:27,237 --> 01:00:39,698
Rym: or the symphonic band which was the real band or the wind ensemble which was the really real band that went all over the country and by all over the country I mean pretty much to like five different places and Toronto.

777
01:00:39,758 --> 01:00:44,264
Scott: yeah see our high school had all sorts of different bands like they had the symphonic band and the jazz band and whatever.

778
01:00:44,345 --> 01:00:48,284
Scott: right but all like the symphonic band was pretty much the marching band.

779
01:00:48,324 --> 01:00:59,119
Scott: people sit down and do a concert for part of the year when it's not marching band season and the jazz band was the guys in the marching band who think they're really cool also do a jazz band part of the year.

780
01:00:59,139 --> 01:01:00,888
Scott: you know it was all the same people.

781
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:03,159
Rym: our high school jazz band played gigs for money.

782
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:06,172
Scott: yeah ours they all just did concerts at the school.

783
01:01:06,694 --> 01:01:07,559
Scott: you know whatever.

784
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:11,177
Rym: actually we did a lot of concerts at like local venues as real event.

785
01:01:11,197 --> 01:01:11,740
Scott: they might date.

786
01:01:11,921 --> 01:01:15,784
Scott: I mean they went around and did stuff but I don't really know about it cuz I wasn't paying attention to them.

787
01:01:16,187 --> 01:01:17,654
Rym: yeah but there was.

788
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,177
Rym: there's a lot of.

789
01:01:18,197 --> 01:01:20,954
Rym: I mean Michigan and the Midwest are really big on marching band.

790
01:01:20,995 --> 01:01:23,330
Rym: like marching band is a big deal for a lot of people out there.

791
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:26,001
Rym: so I was hardcore into the marching band.

792
01:01:26,423 --> 01:01:36,031
Rym: and there's also a lot of non marching just competition like the MSBOA and all these sorts of people would compete all over the place in music and there's similar things in most states in the country.

793
01:01:36,052 --> 01:01:38,812
Rym: there's probably similar things all over the world and all over everywhere.

794
01:01:39,314 --> 01:01:44,739
Rym: but I played this kind of easy song my freshman year in high school with two other trumpet players.

795
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:53,409
Rym: the three of us were pretty much to quote our band director the only people who actually had a chance of being professionals in the whole school not counting the drummer but that's it.

796
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,896
Rym: that's a whole fun story mm-hmm.

797
01:01:55,620 --> 01:02:01,190
Rym: and we played this thing called buglers holiday which is a fun little song that a lot of trumpet players play when they're young.

798
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:04,765
Rym: and we played it in a little competition and we were freshmen.

799
01:02:05,126 --> 01:02:07,195
Rym: and this guy walks in after.

800
01:02:07,215 --> 01:02:19,293
Rym: we're just kind of practicing in the room before and he introduces himself as kind of a recruiter for the University of Michigan and he's looking for people to give scholarships to to come play in the marching band and full rides.

801
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:24,094
Rym: and when he found out that three of us were freshmen he basically said holy shit.

802
01:02:24,495 --> 01:02:27,243
Rym: yeah here's my card.

803
01:02:27,303 --> 01:02:29,911
Rym: call me back in a few years and we'll talk all right.

804
01:02:30,493 --> 01:02:34,150
Rym: and yeah I'll just stop there because this is probably kind of boring.

805
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,658
Rym: I keep skipping things as a result.

806
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:38,635
Rym: I'm probably telling the boring parts but I was super into music.

807
01:02:38,877 --> 01:02:44,890
Rym: I was super good at the trumpet and I got to find some videos of like the marching band stuff or some of the solos or fun things I did.

808
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:48,763
Rym: but suffice to say I chose computers instead of music.

809
01:02:49,205 --> 01:02:50,449
Rym: and here I am right.

810
01:02:50,469 --> 01:02:56,389
Scott: so today the situation is such that well I'm basically not playing any music.

811
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:59,703
Scott: I like music you know kinda and not like super.

812
01:02:59,743 --> 01:03:04,747
Scott: music like Rym is like 10 times more music than I am but yeah I'm more music than the most people I know.

813
01:03:04,767 --> 01:03:08,613
Rym: yeah I mean you don't sit down in front of the piano every day and try to learn how to play it better.

814
01:03:08,854 --> 01:03:11,325
Scott: no but you know I like it and playing it.

815
01:03:11,526 --> 01:03:19,994
Scott: I guess I appreciate it more now than I did then and I'm still kind of upset that I didn't keep playing the guitar since fifth grade because I'd be super rocking out right now which I would totally like.

816
01:03:20,135 --> 01:03:22,147
Scott: and guitar hero doesn't help that at all.

817
01:03:22,247 --> 01:03:23,554
Scott: it in fact hurts that a lot.

818
01:03:23,574 --> 01:03:27,692
Scott: so I said you know what if I would have started playing in fifth grade.

819
01:03:27,913 --> 01:03:29,361
Scott: right that would've been what fifth grade.

820
01:03:29,643 --> 01:03:31,351
Scott: and now I'm in what the the 12 13 14.

821
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:32,213
Scott: I'm in the 19th grade.

822
01:03:32,253 --> 01:03:42,465
Scott: so it is only like maybe 15 years or so of you know maybe 14 15 years now granted you're discounting the whole.

823
01:03:42,746 --> 01:03:45,502
Rym: well brains change as you get older harder to learn things.

824
01:03:45,643 --> 01:03:49,724
Scott: I am discounting that but basically the equivalent of playing for those 14 years.

825
01:03:49,784 --> 01:04:02,678
Scott: well if I start playing now right I'm 25 by the time I'm like 40 I think I could be rocking out don't you god of rock ever or anything.

826
01:04:02,698 --> 01:04:04,747
Scott: that's pretty much a foregone conclusion.

827
01:04:04,787 --> 01:04:13,192
Scott: but I could be playing songs and then you know having fun and doing cool stuff at least entertaining friends and people on the internet and making music for the show or whatever.

828
01:04:13,273 --> 01:04:15,302
Scott: so I said hey that's not too bad.

829
01:04:15,844 --> 01:04:16,909
Scott: but then I looked on the internet.

830
01:04:16,929 --> 01:04:19,541
Scott: I said you know what guitars are expensive.

831
01:04:20,184 --> 01:04:23,619
Scott: I mean you could buy like a cheap piece of shit nylon string whatever.

832
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,271
Scott: but if I'm gonna do something I'm gonna do it for real.

833
01:04:26,493 --> 01:04:29,750
Scott: you know I'm not gonna do something half-ass or crappy it's I'm gonna do it.

834
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:30,332
Scott: I'm gonna do it.

835
01:04:30,473 --> 01:04:43,893
Scott: and I kind of wasn't sure that if I bought a guitar that I would actually practice I felt like I'm gonna go online and I'm gonna buy some like $200 guitar and an amp and whatever and it's gonna sit there on a little stand.

836
01:04:43,933 --> 01:04:46,306
Scott: that cost me 30 bucks or I don't know how much stands cost.

837
01:04:46,748 --> 01:04:47,773
Scott: it's gonna sit in my room.

838
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:48,537
Rym: I've got a stand.

839
01:04:48,557 --> 01:04:49,100
Rym: you can have it.

840
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:49,904
Scott: a guitar stand.

841
01:04:50,426 --> 01:04:51,673
Rym: well no I've got a music stand.

842
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:52,639
Scott: I have a guitar stand.

843
01:04:52,840 --> 01:05:04,676
Scott: probably music stand even more money right and I'm gonna buy some book that tells me how to play or something or watch who knows and it's gonna sit there and I'm not gonna do it and I'm gonna look at it every day.

844
01:05:04,736 --> 01:05:13,002
Scott: sit in my room some awesome guitar you know and I'm not gonna play it and I'm just gonna feel really bad about spending a lot of money on something I don't use and it's gonna suck.

845
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:15,172
Scott: so I said you know what I got a better idea.

846
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:23,748
Scott: yeah I went and I said well is there some way that I can sort of prove that if I buy the guitar I will actually practice it?

847
01:05:23,768 --> 01:05:29,590
Scott: because if I can prove to myself that if I bought one I would actually learn it then I buy one.

848
01:05:30,172 --> 01:05:32,182
Rym: well you've been playing the plastic guitar quite a bit.

849
01:05:32,584 --> 01:05:34,231
Scott: yeah that helps a little bit.

850
01:05:34,272 --> 01:05:41,043
Scott: yeah maybe if there was a piece of software like guitar hero but it actually taught you how to play real guitar.

851
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:44,543
Rym: yeah you realize something like that is the holy grail of making infinite money.

852
01:05:44,563 --> 01:05:45,769
Scott: well there makes.

853
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:48,185
Scott: I think there's some project to make something like that for the piano.

854
01:05:48,205 --> 01:05:52,446
Rym: yeah people have been trying that forever and it's never really been successful or good.

855
01:05:52,626 --> 01:05:59,498
Scott: yeah but anyway I need to prove to myself that I would actually practice before I would go and spend the money on the guitar.

856
01:06:00,302 --> 01:06:07,170
Scott: so I was trying to figure out what to do to do that and sort of the solution sort of came to me through multiple means.

857
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:09,604
Scott: basically I listen to this podcast the Roadhouse.

858
01:06:09,624 --> 01:06:11,253
Scott: I actually pay for this podcast.

859
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:16,800
Scott: it's like 20 bucks a year something and I get no ads in it and I get an extra song every week which is awesome.

860
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:38,317
Scott: but it's blues music and I like these blues music and I'd probably play blues guitar if I got a guitar and I was listening to blues music and I heard a guy playing the harmonica not too uncommon in the blues music the harmonica and typically a blues instrument more than anything else and I it sort of dawned on me hey harmonicas are cheap really cheap.

861
01:06:38,818 --> 01:06:41,667
Scott: it's like you could get one for like three dollars.

862
01:06:41,687 --> 01:06:44,516
Scott: I could play the harmonica.

863
01:06:44,536 --> 01:06:51,004
Scott: I know how to play instruments where you blow into them and it can't be that hard right I mean well.

864
01:06:51,626 --> 01:07:01,888
Scott: so I said you know what I I'm gonna go and do some research on harmonica play and on YouTube I found this video that basically convinced me and I should we link to the video?

865
01:07:01,909 --> 01:07:02,693
Rym: I think we should.

866
01:07:02,714 --> 01:07:03,701
Rym: there's this cool guy.

867
01:07:03,801 --> 01:07:05,251
Rym: send it to me again cuz I don't have the link.

868
01:07:05,332 --> 01:07:13,823
Scott: it's a cool guy on YouTube and his YouTube name is night train James which is a cool name and he used to be a marine and he learned to play the harmonica when he was in the Marines back in the day.

869
01:07:13,883 --> 01:07:15,894
Scott: and he seems like a pretty cool guy.

870
01:07:16,014 --> 01:07:22,324
Scott: and is this little video convinced me cuz I was looking up like which harmonica to buy and everything and all that stuff.

871
01:07:22,365 --> 01:07:28,095
Scott: and this video told me what to buy and everything and convinced me that playing the harmonica was gonna be a good test.

872
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:32,816
Scott: so I went out and I bought a harmonica exactly the one this guy told me to.

873
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:36,596
Rym: yeah well beyond that Scott basically came to me and said watch this video.

874
01:07:37,078 --> 01:07:38,304
Rym: and I said okay and I watch it.

875
01:07:38,324 --> 01:07:40,633
Rym: then he's like let's learn how to play the harmonica.

876
01:07:40,854 --> 01:07:45,352
Scott: yep so we bought harmonicas and I convinced Rym to get one.

877
01:07:45,413 --> 01:07:46,499
Scott: I convinced Alex to get one too.

878
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:50,660
Scott: I don't know he's playing it but and I got it and I started trying to learn it.

879
01:07:50,720 --> 01:08:01,772
Scott: I'm not I can't actually play it super good yet but I have played like simple songs you know like camp town races and you I haven't heard you I can play can tell will you play something for our listeners?

880
01:08:01,993 --> 01:08:07,881
Scott: no no no I'll play some because I learn also figured out that listening to harmonica's live is painful.

881
01:08:08,162 --> 01:08:12,787
Rym: it's not painful if you're far away or it's part of a band or and I don't find it that painful.

882
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:14,013
Rym: I think you're just not your father's.

883
01:08:14,094 --> 01:08:16,285
Scott: it bothers me at least at least when you play.

884
01:08:16,366 --> 01:08:17,813
Scott: the noise it makes is bothersome.

885
01:08:17,934 --> 01:08:21,170
Scott: nah I guess it was also bothersome when you played the trumpet.

886
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:22,336
Scott: so maybe it's just Rym.

887
01:08:22,376 --> 01:08:24,548
Scott: playing musical instruments of any kind bothers me.

888
01:08:24,568 --> 01:08:27,263
Scott: I think what whether he's doing well or not it's just.

889
01:08:27,384 --> 01:08:29,495
Rym: I think what has to do with it is how loud it is.

890
01:08:29,837 --> 01:08:30,479
Scott: something like that.

891
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,421
Rym: I mean my trumpet with like the super silencer mutant is still kind of loud in this house.

892
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:37,532
Scott: so basically here's the thing.

893
01:08:37,612 --> 01:08:44,808
Scott: I'm playing the harmonica and I'm putting some amount of my time as much time as I feel like I haven't heard you play the harmonica in a while.

894
01:08:44,828 --> 01:08:50,624
Scott: I've been playing it just when you're not there when it's unlike you I play instruments with no one's around so I don't bother anybody.

895
01:08:50,684 --> 01:08:58,923
Scott: but when I get home before you when you're not here when I was always here over Thanksgiving I was home for like two days alone over the one weekend.

896
01:08:59,225 --> 01:09:00,996
Scott: there were other times when I'm home and no one's here.

897
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:07,392
Rym: so the last time you played the harmonicas over the weekend yeah I've actually been playing it pretty much every single day since we bought him.

898
01:09:07,513 --> 01:09:11,679
Scott: well obviously this is why you were much more the music than me because you have much more of the practice.

899
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:12,243
Scott: motivation.

900
01:09:12,363 --> 01:09:12,524
Scott: yeah

901
01:09:12,545 --> 01:09:26,617
Rym: well part of it too and Scott actually didn't believe me but I did try to learn the harmonica as a kid and I own a harmonica maybe two I don't remember if that was mine or my brother's yeah and I was awful at it like really awful cuz I didn't get lessons or anything really.

902
01:09:26,657 --> 01:09:28,265
Rym: I just tried to learn lessons.

903
01:09:28,305 --> 01:09:28,828
Scott: now you're lying.

904
01:09:28,889 --> 01:09:29,934
Rym: I try to learn from a book.

905
01:09:30,316 --> 01:09:30,678
Scott: uh-huh.

906
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:32,225
Scott: you said you got lessons before.

907
01:09:32,246 --> 01:09:34,174
Rym: well I got lessons from a book uh-huh.

908
01:09:34,656 --> 01:09:42,755
Rym: anyway I was awful at it and I gave it up pretty much right away and I never got past going bitty bitty bitty bitty bitty bitty up and down in harmonica.

909
01:09:42,774 --> 01:09:48,060
Scott: that I was able to do that when I was like three and I had a harmonica that somehow made its way into my toy closet.

910
01:09:48,421 --> 01:09:56,513
Rym: but it's actually it's really really easy to play the harmonica at least to play simple songs and play almost anything.

911
01:09:56,553 --> 01:09:58,623
Rym: on a diatonic harmonica ten hole diets.

912
01:09:58,643 --> 01:10:07,449
Rym: yeah if you know about music if you know music theory and you know what you what sound you want to make and you know why you want to make those sounds it's so easy to play.

913
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:07,952
Rym: the harmonica.

914
01:10:08,012 --> 01:10:14,188
Scott: thing is it's only got ten holes which is like 20 notes but then you can bend to get a few more notes but there aren't really.

915
01:10:14,228 --> 01:10:18,929
Scott: there are a lot of songs that you sort of can't play on the at least a C key harmonica.

916
01:10:18,969 --> 01:10:21,905
Scott: you need to get harmonic is in other keys to play other songs.

917
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:24,115
Rym: yeah but at the same time you can play a lot.

918
01:10:24,196 --> 01:10:26,084
Scott: you can play a lot you can play enough.

919
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:27,430
Scott: so here's the thing.

920
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:31,110
Scott: I'm gonna keep playing the harmonica you know basically as much as I have been.

921
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:48,150
Scott: and if I'm still playing it and I'm still harmonica ing like a year from now or you know and I feel like I've actually learned it and like I could play video game songs on it or whatever and I'm not comfortable just like whipping it out and playing a song or whatever then I'll buy a guitar.

922
01:10:49,370 --> 01:11:02,231
Scott: otherwise I realize that I'll just probably I'll consign myself to do the fact that I while I might like to play a musical instrument and like the idea of it I will never actually invest the amount of time into it to make it worth it

923
01:11:02,713 --> 01:11:02,934
Rym: and

924
01:11:03,075 --> 01:11:03,517
Scott: I'll give up.

925
01:11:03,758 --> 01:11:07,697
Rym: our real goal now is to get good enough to play a lot of really geeky music.

926
01:11:07,918 --> 01:11:08,803
Scott: that is my goal.

927
01:11:08,823 --> 01:11:09,908
Scott: that's pretty much my line.

928
01:11:09,968 --> 01:11:10,632
Rym: how cool would that be?

929
01:11:10,652 --> 01:11:18,469
Rym: you're walking around some anime con and you see a bunch of guys just rocking out on blues versions of some anime song in the artist's alley.

930
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:20,657
Scott: if I reach that point I'll buy a guitar for sure.

931
01:11:21,842 --> 01:11:23,207
Rym: so uh gonna practice.

932
01:11:23,668 --> 01:11:25,984
Rym: yeah I gotta play something for there are for our listeners.

933
01:11:26,145 --> 01:11:26,971
Rym: I know they want to hear it.

934
01:11:27,292 --> 01:11:32,693
Rym: well they could stuff but they want to hear it they want to play harmonica and record it.

935
01:11:32,713 --> 01:11:35,007
Scott: you need like that little ball microphone thing don't?

936
01:11:35,027 --> 01:11:35,651
Rym: what do you think?

937
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,121
Rym: that ball microphone thing is Scott?

938
01:11:37,242 --> 01:11:38,852
Scott: it's a special microphone for harmonica's.

939
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:45,678
Rym: uh-huh yeah no yeah yeah actually Scott our microphone right here is great for recording harmonica.

940
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:46,965
Rym: remember the microphones.

941
01:11:47,005 --> 01:11:48,793
Rym: we use our instrument mics.

942
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:52,005
Rym: you can mic pretty much any instrument with this.

943
01:11:52,025 --> 01:11:55,602
Scott: yeah whatever I'm not playing right now wait till I get better.

944
01:11:55,642 --> 01:12:07,524
Rym: so all right all right but yeah my entreaty to all of you is that if you're cool at all you should buy a 10-hole diatonic key of C harmonica.

945
01:12:07,564 --> 01:12:09,150
Rym: Lee Oscar I think is the one that we bought.

946
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:10,800
Scott: yeah you can also buy I don't know.

947
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:14,541
Scott: there's like three or four different companies that make them by the Lee Oscar.

948
01:12:14,561 --> 01:12:14,964
Rym: what is that?

949
01:12:15,004 --> 01:12:17,415
Scott: the Hauner the Hauner Marine Band is the other one.

950
01:12:17,455 --> 01:12:24,408
Scott: you can get Hauner H o h n er marine band 10 and I think we as long as it's a 10-hole diatonic key of C harmonica.

951
01:12:24,629 --> 01:12:25,353
Scott: that's what's important.

952
01:12:25,695 --> 01:12:35,852
Rym: I think we should all learn the harmonica together and then whenever there is any crowd of GeekNights listeners much like if there's ever a crowd of one two three four five six seven eight nine or possibly ten naked men.

953
01:12:35,872 --> 01:12:40,128
Rym: a heap of trouble is sure to come about for all concerns.

954
01:12:40,248 --> 01:12:49,003
Scott: I can also play doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-dee but I can't play the solo part where they're like going doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

955
01:12:49,023 --> 01:12:49,505
Rym: I can't do that.

956
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:53,550
Rym: We should have some dueling harmonicas perhaps at the New York Anime Festival.

957
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:54,895
Scott: no I don't know.

958
01:12:54,935 --> 01:12:56,020
Scott: maybe how about Katsu-Kan?

959
01:12:57,004 --> 01:12:57,967
Scott: that's a better chance.

960
01:12:58,249 --> 01:12:59,414
Rym: Think we'll have something for katsuka.

961
01:12:59,434 --> 01:13:02,489
Rym: remember we're doing a late show at Katsucon.

962
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:03,575
Scott: yeah that'd be a good time.

963
01:13:03,716 --> 01:13:04,944
Rym: we should bust out the harmonicas.

964
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,598
Scott: then we should have some sort of dueling nerd harmonic.

965
01:13:07,638 --> 01:13:07,839
Scott: let's.

966
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,588
Rym: uh let's commit to that now on the air.

967
01:13:09,749 --> 01:13:10,573
Scott: no why not?

968
01:13:10,673 --> 01:13:12,402
Scott: and I committing ultimate I'll commit.

969
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:16,923
Scott: the whole point of this is to determine if I am at the committing ability.

970
01:13:16,943 --> 01:13:17,646
Scott: I'm not gonna.

971
01:13:18,028 --> 01:13:24,176
Scott: if I was gonna commit now I would be like buying a Stratocaster online or something not a Telecaster I don't know.

972
01:13:24,236 --> 01:13:24,860
Scott: I have no idea.

973
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,347
Scott: I just name of a guitar.

974
01:13:26,407 --> 01:13:26,950
Scott: I know what the.

975
01:13:27,372 --> 01:13:29,381
Scott: I wouldn't even know what guitar to buy it after research.

976
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:31,229
Scott: that too all right.

977
01:13:31,249 --> 01:13:32,534
Rym: yeah we went on long.

978
01:13:32,554 --> 01:13:33,659
Rym: that's all I got.

979
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:34,663
Rym: it's Thursday.

980
01:13:34,683 --> 01:13:36,730
Rym: I need some sleep and I made dinner.

981
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:36,991
Rym: yet.

982
01:13:37,231 --> 01:13:38,252
Scott: yeah let's go eat.
