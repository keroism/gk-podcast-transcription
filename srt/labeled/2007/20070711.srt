1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,708
Rym: It's Wednesday July 11th.

2
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:12,972
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,273 --> 00:00:15,720
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:16,622 --> 00:00:18,599
Rym: Tonight we begin convention season.

5
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:25,386
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,557 --> 00:00:33,799
Rym: Well, there's no more denying it It is fully 100% con season.

7
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:44,542
Rym: Scott and I are not going to have a moment's rest Until the Monday after Otakon when we wake up on the beach and do not leave it For about nine days or so.

8
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:46,030
Scott: give or take yes something like that.

9
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:50,930
Rym: I might leave the beach after a couple of days to go play some DDR, but then it's right back to that Beach.

10
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:55,490
Scott: Yep, also might go away from the beach to just throw some money down a toilet.

11
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,050
Scott: Oh, yeah, I also come back.

12
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,470
Rym: Well the last time we threw money down that toilet a whole bunch of more money came back.

13
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:08,930
Scott: Well, you know it wasn't my fault that someone clogged up the toilet And all this other money someone else threw down there shoved right back up and into my wallet.

14
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,390
Rym: I gotta say anecdotal evidence doesn't mean much.

15
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,790
Rym: but from the perspective of the experiences of myself and Scott gambling is Awesome, and I'll just give you free money.

16
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,878
Scott: Well, I think I don't need to do.

17
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:21,370
Scott: we don't need to do a whole episode about this.

18
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:23,277
Scott: No, we have one thing to say about gambling.

19
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:26,890
Scott: gambling in a casino is no different than playing an arcade.

20
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:35,360
Scott: You spend money to get entertainment and then the entertainment is quick and over, you know It's like putting 50 cents in a time crisis machine.

21
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:38,890
Scott: isn't really that different from putting 50 cents in a slot machine?

22
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:41,991
Rym: Well, unless you're playing gigawing because then you can play for like an hour I know.

23
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:46,045
Scott: but the you know, the the time the entertainment you're getting is much less.

24
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:48,877
Scott: but the chance of winning money You know if you like that's.

25
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:50,867
Scott: if that entertains you then that's oh, man.

26
00:01:51,712 --> 00:02:01,390
Rym: I just to this day and this has been a fantasy of mine as a kid Imagine a real arcade with real games where somehow no one will ever allow a game of skill to award you money.

27
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:03,303
Rym: I know I know but I can dream.

28
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:07,962
Rym: Yeah, I can dream Yes, but anyway cuz let me tell you Rampart world champion.

29
00:02:07,982 --> 00:02:15,250
Scott: Oh, yeah the key to a casino is You have to assume that any money you gamble at a casino is gone.

30
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:16,214
Scott: You're just spend.

31
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:17,942
Scott: it's like spending money on time crisis.

32
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:18,766
Scott: You spent the money.

33
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:19,710
Scott: It's never coming back.

34
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,899
Scott: That's how you have to assume.

35
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,270
Rym: when I was a kid and I went to the arcade I had my five dollars are usually more like two dollars.

36
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:26,356
Rym: Yeah, and I put it in.

37
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:28,830
Rym: I get my tokens and I had to spend all those tokens.

38
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:33,859
Scott: So when you go to a casino you do the same thing You're putting money you turn the money into chips.

39
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,224
Scott: That money is gone.

40
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:36,790
Scott: Pretend the money's never coming back.

41
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:45,129
Scott: Then you go and play games with your tokens chips until you're done having fun or until you run out of tokens and chips.

42
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:51,651
Scott: and Then if you have any left over the casino just happens to be nicer than the arcade and they let you turn it back into Money.

43
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:53,097
Scott: now arcade doesn't?

44
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:53,318
Scott: that's.

45
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:54,041
Scott: that's how it works.

46
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:57,537
Rym: If you feel the urge to go buy more chips Hit yourself.

47
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:58,603
Rym: just hit yourself.

48
00:02:58,683 --> 00:02:59,830
Scott: You never buy more chips.

49
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,035
Scott: Let's like you go to the arcade.

50
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,110
Scott: you put a 20 in the change machine and you don't get any more.

51
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:05,635
Scott: Same thing at the casino.

52
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:09,990
Scott: you take $200 and you say this $200 is going away and never coming back.

53
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:15,190
Rym: Now by the same you never put any more in if you get ahead by an amount of money.

54
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:25,395
Rym: That would be nice if you had yeah say a jackpot I. just if you get ahead to the point where getting that amount of money suddenly in cash would be a a Significant boon to your life.

55
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:27,161
Rym: Hey, fuck immediately.

56
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:27,402
Scott: Yes.

57
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:28,365
Scott: Hey lose it all.

58
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:30,989
Scott: I just won ten grand That could pay off my car.

59
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:38,948
Rym: I will cash out now and not continue playing any games because the odds are always in the casinos favor if you have a good luck streak.

60
00:03:39,732 --> 00:03:41,939
Rym: The odds are that will not continue.

61
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:47,270
Scott: because I'm if you just sit in the casino and play forever You will eventually lose everything.

62
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:52,108
Rym: That's why rich people gamble because if you have a lot of money to gamble you can ride out the bad luck.

63
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:52,750
Rym: and then when?

64
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,907
Rym: You have good luck Once you break even or get above you cash out as soon as you've broken even or gotten above.

65
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:03,128
Scott: Yep Of course a lot of you know, eventually you just won't get a good luck streak and you lose all your money.

66
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:04,415
Scott: Yep That's why I got us.

67
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:09,002
Scott: That's why guys who run casinos are loaded Man, we should run a casino.

68
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:09,830
Scott: We should anyway.

69
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,911
Rym: So so we've talked about this a couple of times in the last week or two and I like to bring it up one more Time.

70
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:21,550
Rym: we have already got two fine upstanding gentlemen who are going to hopefully put on one hell of a show for us.

71
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:25,925
Rym: We've got some guest hosts for next week for the Wednesday night show two weeks from now.

72
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:27,190
Rym: All right two weeks from now, right?

Rym: Yeah, we have this other con ConnectiCon this weekend.

75
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:39,808
Rym: Yes, but yeah Our tradition starting last year was to get guest hosts of high caliber and high quality to do the show for us.

76
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,240
Rym: last year We had our Richard and Allison from movies.

77
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,849
Rym: You should see and they did a bang-up job.

78
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:49,350
Rym: This year we've got two unnamed individuals for whom I have nothing but the highest of esteem.

79
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:51,576
Scott: Well, I didn't give it away at all.

80
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:55,668
Rym: It could be Darryl and Gerald and not Clarissa because I said gentlemen.

81
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:59,019
Rym: Yeah Yeah, cuz I didn't say there wasn't a lady.

82
00:04:59,039 --> 00:04:59,842
Rym: Yeah.

83
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:02,230
Rym: Yeah, it's definitely anime world order.

84
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,143
Rym: I can tell you that it has nothing to do with karate or yeah.

85
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:06,765
Rym: Yeah.

86
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:08,270
Rym: Oh, I guess I ruined it there.

87
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:09,074
Scott: Yeah, you did.

88
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:09,838
Rym: You know what though?

89
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,977
Rym: an ulterior motive and I'm gonna be Forthright and tell you all my ulterior motive.

90
00:05:15,238 --> 00:05:16,863
Rym: All right now they can't back down.

91
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,710
Rym: Oh now they can't back out.

92
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,735
Scott: Yeah, I did.

93
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:25,429
Scott: while I am looking forward to what they come up with I did have a feeling that they would not come through and end up.

94
00:05:25,611 --> 00:05:28,289
Scott: You know cuz I mean how long did it take them to do the valiant denims?

95
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,355
Rym: See I told them though.

96
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,823
Rym: They all they have to do is record the show.

97
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,130
Rym: They don't have to edit it at all.

98
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,094
Rym: I'll take care of all that.

99
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:34,418
Rym: All right, even better.

100
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:39,098
Rym: I know that they would have come through eventually because they're that way They'll always finish what they started.

101
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:40,848
Rym: eventually might take a year or two.

102
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:54,810
Rym: Yep Oh, well, so my last call if any of you out there now when I say any of you, you're all welcome to try but Seriously, we mean people who have podcast or audio experience or you think you can do a really good job with this.

103
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:06,289
Scott: yes, if you think you want to make a Monday Tuesday or Thursday episode of GeekNights and You want it to go up in the feed of GeekNights as you know the episode for two weeks from now?

104
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:14,690
Scott: Tell us don't go and make one and then send it to us because you might say no ask us first And then we'll tell you if you should make one or not.

105
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:21,083
Scott: Yes, if I guess you're free to make one if you want to but I don't want anyone to like do work and make an Episode and then us not use it.

106
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:21,829
Scott: That'll be kind of sad.

107
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,401
Rym: Yeah, now if you don't hear from us the answer was probably no.

108
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:28,390
Rym: that's just because we don't have time to check our frickin email.

109
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:29,809
Rym: Anymore good God you people.

110
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:33,570
Rym: The forums are beyond my control at this point.

111
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:40,218
Scott: Yes, if you sign up for the forum and you didn't get an email that said welcome to the forum Just come back to the forum and sign in.

112
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:40,820
Rym: Yeah.

113
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:44,030
Rym: Yeah, but we water is poison has been a moderator now for a while.

114
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:44,970
Rym: He's doing a great job.

115
00:06:45,091 --> 00:06:48,437
Rym: We're probably going to need some more Moderators because this is just getting nuts.

116
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:53,529
Rym: but don't ask because if you have to ask you're not gonna be a moderate and I think we Need a secretary to read our email to us.

117
00:06:53,750 --> 00:07:00,410
Rym: Maybe maybe but however if we say no or we don't respond that in no way means that you were bad people.

118
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:03,582
Rym: In fact to the few submissions we've gotten already.

119
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:05,710
Rym: All I want to say is try next year.

120
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:09,042
Rym: All you got to do is have a year of experience and you'll probably be good enough.

121
00:07:09,223 --> 00:07:09,424
Scott: Yep.

122
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:11,110
Rym: It's just a matter of experience.

123
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:15,770
Scott: Yeah, we don't want to put like, you know, so like memory we did that worst podcast episode.

124
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:16,996
Rym: Yeah, we wouldn't let.

125
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,705
Scott: what was that terrible terrible podcast?

126
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:19,469
Rym: what anime Paul's?

127
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:23,541
Scott: The one with the little kids, oh that one.

128
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:25,908
Scott: yeah, we don't want that to go in our feet.

129
00:07:25,948 --> 00:07:29,390
Scott: I mean More power to you doing that kind of thing.

130
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,330
Scott: I mean, it's awesome that you you know care about us so much that you'll make a nice episode.

131
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,397
Scott: But yeah, we have standards.

132
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:38,748
Rym: Yeah, and I don't really mean to rag on anime Paul's you guys are cool.

133
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:42,510
Rym: It's just that You guys have been coming up in our forums a lot lately.

134
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:48,189
Scott: Is that people just keep mentioning them when they were probably one of the least worst even though in fact You still made the worst?

135
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:49,032
Rym: I would just.

136
00:07:49,072 --> 00:07:54,828
Rym: I would contend that anime Paul's is better than a full majority of podcasts in the world.

137
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:58,456
Rym: Probably Sadly podcasts are usually not that good.

138
00:07:58,657 --> 00:07:59,961
Rym: Yes, but I digress.

139
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:06,085
Scott: so that means they're in the top either in the top 51% Of podcasts which is bad because 90% of podcasts suck.

140
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,721
Rym: Anyway, oh, yeah times.

141
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:11,407
Rym: one other little quick thing.

142
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,190
Rym: I just want to get this out.

143
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,290
Rym: I'm not doing a news tonight partly because I'm really tired and partly because I have a really tired.

144
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:24,661
Rym: I have a very fancy new piece of equipment that we got air freighted overnight to us for Connecticut and Otakon And I really want to push all these buttons.

145
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:28,158
Scott: There aren't too many buttons on it I know but each one of them does a lot.

146
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,750
Rym: Yeah, they feel good when you press them, too.

147
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,982
Rym: They have that little funk of a high-quality device.

148
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:33,385
Rym: Uh-huh.

149
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:36,379
Rym: Anyway, so uh a while ago.

150
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,604
Rym: We did our show on Ava.

151
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:46,581
Rym: We reviewed Ava despite all inclinations that we probably shouldn't tackle something like that and We said we're gonna do a final thoughts episode complete with spoilers.

152
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:49,696
Rym: and I figured this time unlike with other shows We've spoiled.

153
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:51,070
Rym: I want to give you some time.

154
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:52,429
Rym: We're not gonna do this for a month or two.

155
00:08:52,530 --> 00:09:01,624
Rym: So if you want to hear our final thoughts on Ava and you don't want to have to skip an episode of GeekNights sometime In September or October, I'd recommend watching Ava in the next few months.

156
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:03,270
Scott: Yeah, I gotta watch it again.

157
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,775
Scott: I haven't seen it in years.

158
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:06,420
Rym: I've seen it a good five times.

159
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,603
Rym: So I think I'm good.

160
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:08,646
Scott: two times maybe.

161
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:13,485
Scott: I think yeah The second time and all of those are freshman year at RIT, so I haven't seen it since 2000.

162
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:16,628
Rym: Wow God I think we did watch it twice at RIT.

163
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:20,224
Scott: I know I watched it once by myself and then once with everyone else.

164
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:21,610
Rym: we marathoned it at RIT.

165
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,776
Rym: I didn't stay for the whole thing.

166
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:24,565
Rym: Ah, I just subbed for someone.

167
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:25,470
Scott: I didn't do that.

168
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:26,957
Rym: Anyway, that's my news.

169
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:35,795
Rym: GeekNights stuff and to anyone who comes to the cons We're gonna talk about I'm gonna have something really fancy and I'm gonna be carrying it around and babying it and shoving microphones in People's faces.

170
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:36,320
Scott: great.

171
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:40,453
Rym: It's gonna be grand All right, so What?

172
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:51,410
Scott: two weeks ago was anime Expo and for those of you who do not know Anime Expo is the biggest anime convention in North America outside of Japan.

173
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:56,990
Scott: I think they claim to have 40,000 plus people in attendance, but we're not sure how they count those numbers.

174
00:09:57,453 --> 00:10:00,090
Scott: So, you know, it could be that includes dealers.

175
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:03,464
Scott: It could be they count people for three days if they come for the whole week.

176
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:04,690
Scott: Well, actually it's a four-day con.

177
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:10,969
Scott: So, you know that that immediately adds because they have the Thursday only people coming in and stuff like that, right?

178
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,082
Scott: But anyway, it is the biggest con regardless of the accuracy of their attendance numbers.

179
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:17,268
Rym: granted Otakon is clear and far away.

180
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:18,292
Rym: number two It's not like.

181
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:21,763
Scott: there's any contention and I have never been west of Michigan.

182
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:22,526
Scott: I have

183
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:23,710
Rym: never been west of Chicago

184
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:36,329
Scott: yes, so neither of us have ever been to anime Expo and everything we know about it is from what we read of people's testimonies who have gone there and Things we read on the internet about the convention, that's all we know about it.

185
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:44,760
Rym: Yep this year's been a little bit of an exception just in that there was a lot of anime Expo news leading up to the con and I read it all and I was actually excited about it.

186
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:52,010
Scott: Yes, see our prior to this year Our general opinion of anime Expo was that it was a very industry convention, which is true.

187
00:10:52,291 --> 00:11:00,470
Scott: it is a very industry convention and we tend to more like the Fan-run conventions than the industry convention, you know Otakon, KatsuKan.

188
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:07,230
Scott: Yes, that's why we tend to not like comic conventions because comic conventions are very industry but like mocha is very not industry.

189
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:08,422
Scott: That's why we like it so much.

190
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:14,410
Scott: So You know cuz also when you go to an industry con we could probably do an episode about industry for his fan cons.

191
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,193
Rym: Yeah, let's do that.

192
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:15,755
Scott: All right.

193
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:22,424
Scott: Well, we'll not talk about it then but our general opinion of anime expo Is that a it's big it's industry.

194
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:24,675
Scott: We don't really care about it This year.

195
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:37,090
Scott: looking at all the press releases from anime Expo online I actually thought maybe they were gonna clean ourselves up, you know Maybe they were gonna be pretty awesome this year because the programming they had lined up on paper was awesome.

196
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:44,483
Scott: They had that skin concert with I talked that was a news a few weeks ago Yeah, Yoshiki and gacked in the same band and it was crazy.

197
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:46,310
Rym: That's just that's absolutely unbelievable.

198
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:53,822
Scott: That's pretty much as big as the world premiere of a brand new band with like two of the biggest Rockstars in Japan in the same band.

199
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:55,150
Scott: That's just craziness.

200
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,260
Scott: So they had that.

201
00:11:57,601 --> 00:11:59,410
Scott: they also had a whole bunch of other stuff.

202
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,990
Scott: There was like multiple concerts and and all sorts of other crazy awesome events.

203
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,646
Scott: I'm not even gonna list him because you can just go read the press releases.

204
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:07,270
Scott: anime Expo.

205
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:11,754
Scott: But I was very like I if anime Expo was closer I would have just gone.

206
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:15,230
Scott: be just for the programming that they said they were gonna have I would have as well.

207
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:27,578
Rym: I mean, it doesn't draw me as hard as Pax does but that's because Pax is very special in that It's really I mean while it is nominally the penny arcade expo, it's really the Rym has a nerdgasm Expo pretty much every year.

208
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:29,927
Rym: I look at packs and I just yearn for it.

209
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:37,010
Rym: Yeah Yeah, the best most enticing programming of any convention, you know for the cost of this Marantz one of us could have gone.

210
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:38,622
Scott: Yeah, that's that's cool.

211
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:44,021
Scott: Yeah, so Apparently according to the Internet's again because it's all I know about anime Expo.

212
00:12:44,342 --> 00:12:46,269
Scott: So this could be completely wrong, but I doubt it.

213
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:52,481
Scott: Anime Expo did have all this awesome programming but they had big problems.

214
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:53,048
Scott: this year.

215
00:12:53,210 --> 00:13:05,850
Rym: apparently these reports are Quite a bit more widespread than what you would normally get at a con because every anime con ever in the feedback and all the con Reports there's always that small percentage of people who bitch about everything.

216
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:11,786
Scott: Yeah Like oh the cosplay was not judged according to these exact rules that I wanted it to be judged by.

217
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:21,123
Scott: or the elevators were too Small for my bountiful body yes, or this panel ran five minutes short or my panel was.

218
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:27,330
Scott: we had to wait ten minutes before we could go in because The voice actors before us had a crowd around them and they would not disperse.

219
00:13:27,451 --> 00:13:28,395
Rym: I love the people who are.

220
00:13:28,435 --> 00:13:31,410
Scott: I can't get into this panel because I didn't wait in line early enough.

221
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:36,387
Rym: My favorite people are the people who complain about the AMV's over which the con has almost no control.

222
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:38,703
Rym: Yeah Well, I'm almost no control.

223
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:44,790
Scott: There's one thing they could do The best from the worst but they if the if the best are still crap, what can they do about it?

224
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,941
Scott: Yeah, not have AMV's more than what would people complain about?

225
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:50,290
Rym: the people who complain about the freaking weather?

226
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,110
Rym: What do you think Otakon is gonna do about the fact that it's hot in Baltimore in August?

227
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,550
Scott: Yeah, are they gonna move the convention to a different time of year?

228
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,701
Scott: Maybe when you're in school and you can't go you punk kids.

229
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:05,675
Rym: No, we'll just move up to Michigan granted It's still there.

230
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:08,364
Scott: Oh, so everyone will just complain about it being freezing cold.

231
00:14:08,484 --> 00:14:10,887
Scott: or oh, it's not far away from my house I can't go.

232
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:12,370
Scott: Yeah.

233
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:21,033
Scott: Anyway, despite the if you'd subtract all the people who complain about any convention no matter what anime expos seem to seems to have had Huge problems.

234
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:26,030
Scott: that awesome concert we talked that I just talked about was delayed for multiple hours.

235
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:35,239
Scott: people had to wait in line outside not being able to enjoy any other part of the convention because they had to wait in line for Multiple hours before they could get in to see this concert.

236
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:39,821
Scott: and Some people reviewing the concert said while it was pretty awesome.

237
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:42,970
Scott: It wasn't super awesome, and it wasn't super long either.

238
00:14:43,071 --> 00:14:45,070
Scott: It was kind of not so long.

239
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,735
Scott: Yeah, you wanted a concert to be.

240
00:14:46,895 --> 00:15:01,287
Rym: meanwhile back at Otakon when Lark came not only did they do a complete full Just straight-up set at a concert like any arena concert and a gigantic encore, but everything happened pretty much right on schedule Yep, but that's kind of comparing apples and oranges.

241
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:18,830
Scott: Yep but also a lot of other things at this convention were constantly being canceled and delayed and moved around and We're not talking about just one concert It's it seems like the vast majority of the big events were canceled and moved and changed and delayed.

242
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:23,950
Rym: Not just that but a lot of people complain that almost all the panels got moved around or canceled or delayed.

243
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,106
Scott: Yeah, the biggest one at least the one that had the biggest talk going on about it.

244
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:30,109
Scott: Is there someone named?

245
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,670
Scott: Halkomomoe, I don't know if I'm saying it right, but apparently she's like the queen of Akihabara or something like that.

246
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:37,462
Rym: Oh, I forgot

247
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:55,390
Scott: about that I'm not exactly sure but what the story is is that she was very upset with how you know This is a Japanese guest and she was very upset with how you know her interactions with the convention staff and they basically You know weren't meeting her needs and and she like posted on her blog that she was upset.

248
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:00,590
Rym: There's something something and then obviously her PR wrangler got a hold of her and told her to retract it.

249
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,075
Scott: Yeah, but and whatever.

250
00:16:02,557 --> 00:16:17,730
Scott: but the thing is is that basically she had to choose on like like one day of the con whether she basically had to decide between having her concert or Doing all her other events instead of just as scheduled doing all her events and her concert.

251
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:26,147
Scott: So she canceled all her appearances For one day of the con and only did the concert and didn't do anything else that she was going to do.

252
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:31,849
Scott: and she was All like apologizing to the fans and being like I will do my best in this concert for you.

253
00:16:32,531 --> 00:16:34,819
Scott: These evil con staff fucked me over.

254
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,682
Scott: I hate them.

255
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:36,886
Scott: people were crying.

256
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:47,210
Rym: Yeah Yeah, see it's really hard to say how much of that might be a pampered guest verse I mean, I don't know anything about very hard to tell from a blog post across the world.

257
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:55,655
Scott: You know if this is a pampered guest who is upset or if con logistics dictor over or a combination or who knows what.

258
00:16:55,916 --> 00:17:09,184
Rym: one thing I find interesting is that I was poking around in the Anime Expo forums and there's a lot of outcry there and people demanding answers and demanding an explanation and all sorts of things and I couldn't find many if Any responses from the staff.

259
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:09,950
Rym: in fact?

260
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:17,612
Rym: There's a bunch of people trying to get together To go over to where the staff is located where their place of business is and knock on the door and try to get an Answer.

261
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:24,770
Rym: Oh, I don't know if the responses are official somewhere else But I got the impression that the staff was kind of hiding from the con.

262
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:29,310
Scott: I don't know, you know impressions on the internet don't tell us anything.

263
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,545
Scott: I have no idea what the reasons were for all these problems.

264
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,490
Scott: I don't know who to blame.

265
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,869
Scott: I don't even know any of the staff.

266
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:36,154
Scott: I don't know anything.

267
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:40,890
Scott: but I do know is that the con had major problems with a lot of events.

268
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,080
Scott: that is absolutely true.

269
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:53,735
Scott: that is what happened and I thought poorly of Anime Expo before and I still think poorly of them no matter how awesome their programming is and they're Not doing too much to fix that.

270
00:17:54,095 --> 00:18:01,461
Scott: and if someone across the country who's never been to your con and it's someone who likes cons Thinks poorly of your con.

271
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:02,929
Scott: That's pretty poor.

272
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:07,907
Rym: Meanwhile, I got to say I'm more and more impressed with Katsucon every year.

273
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:11,719
Rym: Oh, yeah It's fast becoming my second favorite or favorite con.

274
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,210
Scott: Katsucon was very awesome and I only went to one of them.

275
00:18:15,491 --> 00:18:23,402
Rym: Yeah, I've been to three and I will admit though on the second Katsucon I went to I achieved for about six hours epic level drunkenness.

276
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,165
Scott: Whoa.

277
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:25,870
Rym: It was quite an experience.

278
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,181
Scott: I think that's Katsucon's thing though.

279
00:18:28,503 --> 00:18:29,910
Rym: It is that's why I like Katsucon.

280
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,937
Rym: There's a lot more people my age.

281
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:37,317
Rym: I can go to a bar and just chill with a bunch of older anime fans But it's not a hentai con.

282
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:39,485
Rym: no, it's not like that Rhode Island things gonna be.

283
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:40,730
Scott: yeah, we'll see about that.

284
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,902
Rym: I have high hopes for that.

285
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:46,740
Scott: I just I My cynicism low expectations, but a lot of hope.

286
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:50,490
Scott: cynicism greater than optimism exactly at least for that.

287
00:18:57,251 --> 00:18:58,857
Rym: things of the day.

288
00:18:58,877 --> 00:19:03,953
Scott: a long time ago, I had a thing of the day, which was Miotd.com.

289
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:09,767
Scott: it's a website that is mecha image of the day and every day they have a mecha image and it's.

290
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:11,151
Scott: it's a really awesome Site.

291
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,162
Scott: I subscribe to the RSS feed and it's really good.

292
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:21,523
Scott: Well, my thing of the day today is a Particular image from the mecha image of the day on July 9th.

293
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:28,110
Scott: They put up this picture and it's a picture I feel like I've seen before But I'm not sure where I've seen it before it.

294
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:35,409
Scott: I'm sure some nerd out there can tell me but this image is a mashup a really good mashup that looks a lot like.

295
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:53,990
Scott: Basically it combines like a Hildebrandt brothers Star Wars movie poster with a picture of a bunch of nerds in the front row of a concert and Star Wars and a concert where the Star Wars characters are Making a rock band of themselves and it's if you like Star Wars at all.

296
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,935
Scott: This is something to see.

297
00:19:54,996 --> 00:19:57,490
Scott: but my only question is why is this a mecha image of the day?

298
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:02,228
Scott: I mean sure the droids are back there and Darth Vader's there, but it's not a mecha image.

299
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:02,710
Rym: You know what?

300
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,594
Rym: I don't think it matters.

301
00:20:03,674 --> 00:20:04,337
Scott: It doesn't matter.

302
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,326
Scott: Every geek should see this picture.

303
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:09,541
Rym: That's the three things I will point out about this picture that are awesome.

304
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:10,124
Rym: Number one.

305
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:11,530
Rym: Darth Vader is awesome.

306
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:12,956
Scott: It is always awesome.

307
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:18,737
Rym: number two Han Solo the way he is Engaging the crowd is awesome.

308
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:19,559
Scott: He's always awesome.

309
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,710
Rym: Yeah, and number three notice the guy in the audience with a lightsaber.

310
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,346
Scott: Yep Basically, if you're a geek of any kind, it's just a picture you need to see.

311
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:30,933
Scott: that's why it's a thing of the day Right.

312
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:33,390
Rym: So, uh, imagine a Zerg rush.

313
00:20:34,072 --> 00:20:34,393
Rym: Okay.

314
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:34,854
Rym: All right.

315
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:43,298
Rym: Now imagine a Zerg rush where the target is not a human or a Terran or whatever, but Some poor kitten.

316
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:45,570
Rym: that's a pretty scary image, isn't it?

317
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,357
Scott: I mean one Zerg can kill a kitten.

318
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:53,861
Rym: one Zerg could take both of us out from this room Handily, that's why I'm so afraid of real-world Starcraft.

319
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:58,837
Scott: Yeah, but remember if real-world Starcraft happens We'll have all those Terran equipments watch.

320
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:00,322
Rym: We don't we're just normal people.

321
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:01,466
Rym: the Terrans come from space.

322
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:07,442
Rym: Yeah Yeah, instead of the zombie apocalypse who's no different than alien?

323
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:09,830
Rym: no, yeah, you know what that would also kill us?

324
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:11,019
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

325
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:16,681
Scott: I think I could take alien cuz I've As long as I had those equipments, you know, as long as you don't.

326
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:19,110
Scott: yeah, I played enough natural selection.

327
00:21:20,272 --> 00:21:23,090
Rym: The problem is we don't have those machine guns that have a billion bullets.

328
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:24,214
Scott: That's what we.

329
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:25,538
Scott: if there's aliens we'll have those.

330
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,542
Scott: that's how it works.

331
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:37,509
Rym: All right, so now take you have flamethrowers I've just given you but replace the Zerg with eight an enormous number of Corgi puppies and it is one much safer.

332
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:39,955
Rym: They're much easier to take out.

333
00:21:39,995 --> 00:21:43,749
Rym: but I got to say this is one of the most adorable things I've ever seen.

334
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:45,635
Scott: Yeah, it was all right.

335
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:48,927
Scott: The thing I don't like the problem is they don't zerg rush enough.

336
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:52,526
Rym: It's just yeah It devolves into just puppies playing and then puppies sleeping.

337
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:57,890
Rym: you can skip all that But the first bit you might think that's just like two or three puppies and that cat just looks mildly annoyed.

338
00:21:58,232 --> 00:22:01,890
Rym: Just wait for it and watch until the cat gets away and you don't really need to watch the rest.

339
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,456
Scott: But not the best animal video.

340
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:05,764
Scott: not as good as turtle attacking cat, but I don't know.

341
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:06,286
Rym: I like.

342
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:09,138
Rym: I like this more than turtle But that's just because you like turtles more than me.

343
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,570
Scott: Yeah, it's not so not as good as rabbit attack snake.

344
00:22:12,051 --> 00:22:14,920
Rym: No, it's not because that is still the baddest ass rabbit ever.

345
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:19,123
Rym: Yeah, like a rabbit that lives in a lion's den Why do you like that turtle?

346
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:21,960
Rym: It's not you I don't like to do.

347
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,889
Rym: Oh random cute animal.

348
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:28,249
Rym: But this one was particularly cute and the fact that they called it a zerg rush meant that I had to talk about it.

349
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:31,350
Rym: Okay, so it's con season.

350
00:22:31,453 --> 00:22:39,891
Rym: like we said we're not gonna rest until The Monday after Otakon and then none of you are going to hear a peep out of us until the Monday after the Monday after Otakon,

351
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:46,890
Scott: so we're gonna spend this episode telling you what cons we're going to here and what we're doing at those cons.

352
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:50,179
Rym: I guess we'll go in chronological order sounds good to me.

353
00:22:50,520 --> 00:23:01,432
Scott: So this weekend this weekend as in July 13 14 15 we are going to be at Connecticut 2007.

354
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:04,101
Rym: Connecticut is located at the what Hartford Convention Center.

355
00:23:04,322 --> 00:23:06,770
Scott: I think that's if it didn't move willing to the website.

356
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,049
Rym: I'm sure you can find it.

357
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:15,399
Scott: I've got a convention center on Columbus Boulevard in Hartford, Connecticut on July 13 through 15th 2007. now

358
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:30,323
Rym: we are going to be there Friday But we're pretty much going to have a few drinks with friends and go to bed The reason being that over the course of Saturday we are doing six live shows and then on Sunday We are doing a seventh and that is the minimum that we will be doing at this con.

359
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:32,009
Rym: There's probably going to be more.

360
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:45,073
Rym: Yeah, this will be a big test of our voices because for those of you who saw us at Otakon last year by Sunday We had lost our voices to the point that we had to medicate and I point out that Scott doesn't fucking take Medicine ever.

361
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:52,010
Rym: well halls doesn't really count so much as we took the mentholated halls and we took far more than a doctor would have Led us probably.

362
00:23:52,592 --> 00:23:56,625
Rym: Yeah, we had to drug ourselves to be able to do the let the panel on Sunday.

363
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,048
Rym: We had lost our voices so badly Yeah, and now we're doing seven.

364
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,324
Scott: Okay, so which seven are we doing?

365
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:04,350
Scott: Let's open up the cons kid.

366
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:12,869
Rym: well mostly pretty much all day Saturday if you want to have a GeekNights event, we're either gonna be in a panel or Outside of a panel preparing for another panel.

367
00:24:13,471 --> 00:24:18,410
Rym: We're doing a podcasting and internet radio on Saturday from 12 30 to 1 30 in panel 2.

368
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:18,873
Rym: I don't we need to.

369
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:19,960
Rym: we don't need to say where they all are.

370
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:21,028
Scott: No, we don't need to say where they all.

371
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:22,275
Scott: you'll see The con schedule.

372
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:24,950
Rym: Yeah, suffice to say we've done this panel like three or four times.

373
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,960
Rym: There are in fact two or three examples of it in the feed already.

374
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:30,690
Rym: We're doing it partly because they were interested in it.

375
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:38,470
Rym: They haven't had anything like that before at Connecticut And I think Connecticut's probably a good match for it because there's probably a lot of people there who are really interested in podcasting.

376
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,354
Rym: I don't know a lot about it.

377
00:24:39,736 --> 00:24:39,917
Scott: Yep.

378
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:48,250
Rym: Oh, we're doing the how to run an anime club right before that Yep Which we have run along with our friend Scott Johnson the legendary Scott Johnson as featured in new type.

379
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:58,110
Rym: We've been running this for like five or six years that pretty much every freaking con Yep, so if you want to know how to run an anime con or not an anime con anime club We run this everywhere.

380
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:02,833
Rym: It's mostly for people who haven't seen this panel already Yep.

381
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:12,410
Scott: All right after the podcasting internet radio panel that we're doing An hour and a half after that or so, we're gonna do the anime match game for two hours.

382
00:25:12,631 --> 00:25:16,725
Scott: It's gonna be like the deluxe anime match game of super awesome at all time.

383
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:21,002
Rym: Not only is this gonna be awesome Not only did I write twice as many questions.

384
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:29,270
Rym: Not only did I get rid of the crappy questions Not only did we add so much to this, but we have got a lineup of celebrity guests from the con.

385
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:32,942
Scott: Yep, yes, whoever is the best guess at the con is who we're gonna get.

386
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:34,046
Rym: so we're not gonna.

387
00:25:34,086 --> 00:25:35,796
Rym: it's not gonna be the usual Alright.

388
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:41,563
Rym: so Scott's on the panel along with Dave and Joel and whoever we could drag up five minutes before the con.

389
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:43,270
Rym: Yeah, this is gonna be some awesome guests.

390
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:50,535
Scott: Yeah These are gonna be like guests of honor at the con or official guests of the con are gonna make up our panel at the match Game worst case.

391
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:53,750
Rym: it's gonna be a bunch of cool webcomic artists, which is always hilarious.

392
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,126
Rym: Yes, so Scott Scott and I will probably take turns sitting as these six panelists.

393
00:25:58,146 --> 00:25:59,210
Scott: Yeah, so we always seem to do.

394
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,376
Rym: That's always hilarious.

395
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:02,689
Scott: Yes, but this will be something you do not want to miss.

396
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:08,850
Scott: In fact looking at the schedule like it completely dominates everything running concurrent with it.

397
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:20,328
Rym: So yeah plus we've run this a lot over the years and I think this is going to be the best one because we have prepared more for this anime match game than we have for enemy Any anime match game we have ever run?

398
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,082
Rym: Partly because we're not running it at Otakon like we'd are offered to.

399
00:26:24,423 --> 00:26:26,350
Rym: so we're gonna use all the Otakon awesome here.

400
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:26,872
Scott: Yep.

401
00:26:27,674 --> 00:26:29,159
Scott: All right shortly after that.

402
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,270
Scott: We're gonna do the challenger on fire beta test.

403
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:35,204
Rym: Yes, I noticed this is also in the big panel room.

404
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,550
Rym: So this should be awesome.

405
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:39,201
Rym: We're not sure how this is gonna work and I haven't finished it yet.

406
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:46,490
Scott: Yeah, basically challenger on fire It was the thing of the day a long time ago some Japanese game show where you have to name a hundred anime characters.

407
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:59,038
Scott: Well, we wrote a piece of software there so that we are would be able to run this game in some in the best fashion we can without our own custom studio and We're gonna try to run this game.

408
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:00,284
Scott: This is gonna be a beta test though.

409
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:01,350
Scott: We've never done this before.

410
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:02,740
Scott: We don't know how it's gonna work.

411
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,170
Scott: We don't know how to run it smoothly.

412
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,126
Scott: Yeah, we're basically gonna practice running it to see.

413
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:10,850
Scott: you know Try to figure out how to make it work at other cons in the future.

414
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:19,190
Scott: So if you want to be a part of a first ever con event that will possibly become a very popular con event in the future.

415
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:21,316
Scott: This is something you don't want to miss.

416
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:21,778
Rym: Yep.

417
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:26,410
Rym: Kinetic con has been very gracious in allowing us to test this So I'm really looking forward to it.

418
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:37,304
Rym: I think we're gonna get a lot of good feedback and it'll be fun because think of this Either we're gonna run it awesomely and you'll all love it or We're gonna totally fuck up and you'll get to laugh at us for an hour straight.

419
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:37,785
Rym: Yep.

420
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:39,170
Scott: I'm glad it's only an hour.

421
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,630
Rym: Yeah, yeah, cuz I don't know how many of these I'm gonna finish by then.

422
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,734
Rym: I got a lot of work to do still.

423
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:47,870
Rym: Yep, partly because of my odd emergency room adventure over the weekend.

424
00:27:48,411 --> 00:27:50,397
Rym: Anyway, then later on that night.

425
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:55,572
Rym: We don't have all the details yet, but we're going to be running guest interviews Ourselves.

426
00:27:55,592 --> 00:28:01,220
Rym: so there's gonna be guests of the con who normally when a con guest has a panel They just kind of sit there and wing it.

427
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,190
Rym: or maybe they have someone from the con try to guide him.

428
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:05,680
Scott: Well, we're gonna do or they have people from the audience.

429
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,230
Scott: That's the same dumbass questions over and over what we're gonna.

430
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,940
Scott: How did you become a voice actor?

431
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:11,207
Scott: How do I become a voice?

432
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:12,751
Rym: What's your Inspiration?

433
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:16,222
Rym: probably the crappest question you can ever ask anyone at a con ever.

434
00:28:16,442 --> 00:28:18,429
Scott: What's the favorite thing you've ever worked on?

435
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:20,338
Scott: Yep What are you working on now?

436
00:28:20,358 --> 00:28:20,378
Scott: I?

437
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:26,307
Rym: Like to see the weird question, I like to see the questions where the guy goes what.

438
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:28,054
Scott: yeah Those are my kind of quest.

439
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:28,315
Scott: Yes.

440
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:31,949
Rym: But anyway, we are going to be setting up and it's not our panel.

441
00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:32,950
Rym: Really We're just the moderators.

442
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:44,310
Rym: we're going to be interviewing some of the guests of the con in front of everyone and Probably recording these for posterity and hopefully our goal is that we can guide these interviews into being awesome.

443
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,122
Rym: We want to bring out the shine of these guests.

444
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:54,217
Scott: This is not a panel for us So imagine if you listened to like an episode of GeekNights where we had a celebrity guest like the and we interviewed Them all awesomely right now.

445
00:28:54,277 --> 00:28:57,350
Scott: This panel is basically gonna be that only live and in person.

446
00:28:57,892 --> 00:29:03,590
Scott: So if you like listening to an episode of GeekNights where we cleverly and awesomely interview a celebrity guest

447
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:07,383
Rym: I'd like to point out particularly the Luke Crane interview creator of burning wheel

448
00:29:07,423 --> 00:29:12,910
Scott: because they haven't done too many interviews even though I got really good at them all of a sudden while interviewing Luke Craig.

449
00:29:12,974 --> 00:29:19,030
Rym: Yes It was really amazing because Scott had never really interviewed someone like that before and he went from suck to awesome in about two questions.

450
00:29:19,413 --> 00:29:26,646
Rym: And the rest of that thing is Scott did a really freaking good job And I really I've listened to that episode twice twice because I enjoy it.

451
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:27,910
Scott: Yeah, it's a good episode.

452
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:34,730
Rym: It's also because I was actually pretty drunk while you guys were doing the interview So I was pretty much just sitting there watching the levels the whole time.

453
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:38,914
Scott: Yeah, I'm not saying but if you want to hear some of that kind of awesome This is a panel to go to.

454
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:48,407
Rym: so after that kind of late night also on Saturday We are running the beta version of gecky guy putting the man back in manga.

455
00:29:48,427 --> 00:29:52,109
Scott: Oh, yeah We've been thinking about doing this panel for a long time.

456
00:29:53,531 --> 00:29:56,101
Scott: It's an actually what probably our only panel.

457
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:58,330
Scott: that's actually an anime manga panel.

458
00:29:58,491 --> 00:30:07,977
Rym: Yes, and I will point out we'll talk about this in a bit But this is our prime time event at Otakon and we're running it at Otakon with None other than Gerald from anime world order

459
00:30:08,018 --> 00:30:08,980
Scott: Gerald Rathcole

460
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:15,350
Rym: who assures us that while we're gonna coordinate the whole panel He has something special lined up for the last 10 minutes.

461
00:30:15,812 --> 00:30:18,830
Rym: Oh, man, and he's hinted at what it is, but I'm really looking forward to it.

462
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:24,130
Rym: I think I know what it is, but oh man, so at ConnectiCon it's not gonna be that exact thing.

463
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:25,058
Rym: We're not gonna have Gerald.

464
00:30:25,118 --> 00:30:27,073
Rym: I don't think he wants to fly up for this But I don't.

465
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:29,328
Scott: yeah, he's not gonna come from Florida to ConnectiCon.

466
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,822
Rym: Basically, if you've listened to our show at that rink eating long enough.

467
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:34,806
Rym: I like ConnectiCon.

468
00:30:34,826 --> 00:30:36,833
Rym: it's actually bigger than you'd think Yeah, but it's not.

469
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:40,104
Scott: it's it's too small to be worth coming from Florida for.

470
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:46,330
Rym: yeah, I'm not gonna lie to you But anyway, what we're gonna be doing is kind of our half of this panel.

471
00:30:46,652 --> 00:30:49,970
Rym: We're not gonna do the kind of 18 plus super crazy humor.

472
00:30:50,030 --> 00:31:02,970
Rym: We're gonna do just more of a half history of manga half what this geeky guy is and more importantly We're just gonna talk about all those Genres of manga and all those manga that are out there that you probably haven't read that are probably really up your alley.

473
00:31:03,432 --> 00:31:12,590
Rym: A lot of people maybe not you because you listen to our show and anime world order and you know all about this But there's a lot of people who don't realize that there's manga other than pretty boys and pretty girls and show Joe.

474
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:16,635
Scott: yeah, I mean you go to the bookstore and Basically what happened in the u.s.

475
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:25,270
Scott: And manga I just knew this really quickly is This is I'm gonna probably say the same stuff again at the at the actual panel is that they originally brought manga to the u.s.

476
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:35,743
Scott: you know you know all the crazy violent stuff the stuff that went along with the anime and Viz did it actually first and Dark Horse soon after and Most of it was ignored.

477
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:36,830
Scott: It didn't sell very well.

478
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,970
Scott: It sold to the comic crowd a bit and it didn't make a big splash.

479
00:31:41,454 --> 00:31:46,597
Scott: So they only kind of kept doing it you know at a very slow pace and in the comic book in the u.s.

480
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:55,590
Scott: comic book format and such and Then someone decided they're gonna bring over some show Joe in the digest format namely Tokyo pop and as you know it exploded.

481
00:31:56,094 --> 00:32:05,215
Scott: The thing is people realizing that hey We can make a lot of money by bringing show Joey and shown and jump type stuff shown in fighting stuff Over to the u.s.

482
00:32:05,395 --> 00:32:07,864
Scott: In this format and make a lot of money off of it.

483
00:32:07,924 --> 00:32:09,650
Scott: and there's so much stuff in that format.

484
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:16,530
Scott: They don't even bother to bring over anything else unless you know Because they can make plenty of money with just bringing over the same old stuff.

485
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:23,579
Scott: The end result of this is they'll go to the manga section of the bookstore and they think that manga is Girly-girly and shown in fighting and nothing else.

486
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:23,840
Rym: Yep.

487
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:36,364
Rym: The true end result is that awesome manga I forget the name of it But Emily told me about it is by the same guy who did eagle and there's some natural disaster that splits Japan in two And it's nothing but politicians and Yakuza arguing and looking dramatic.

488
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:38,030
Rym: That's so up my alley.

489
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,713
Rym: I could cry.

490
00:32:38,974 --> 00:32:51,572
Rym: the fact that that kind of manga almost never gets released over here is Probably one of the biggest tragedies of the manga industry in the u.s Yes, so we are going to tell you about as many of the manga or you know We're.

491
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:55,470
Scott: I think we'll go in depth on a few of them But maybe we'll probably mention a whole bunch of others.

492
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:01,132
Rym: We're gonna talk a lot about the history of manga and Tezuka and where the term gecky guy kind of came from and all that Stuff.

493
00:33:01,192 --> 00:33:08,829
Scott: Yeah, you probably heard at an anime world order if you listen to them This panel isn't so well isn't for people who listen to podcasts for people at the con who you know.

494
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,595
Scott: Yeah, I put the man back in their manga.

495
00:33:10,776 --> 00:33:14,066
Scott: Yeah, cuz basically the man back in their manga.

496
00:33:14,247 --> 00:33:15,290
Scott: the read manga.

497
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:24,809
Rym: Part of the reason we named it what we did is for the ironic tongue-in-cheek Nature of because we expect a lot of people to come in expecting something very different from what we're going to do.

498
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:32,310
Rym: Yep, however, I will note that at Otakon they're going to get half of what we're going to do now and half Exactly what they expected.

499
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:41,369
Scott: But that's why that's gonna be 18 plus and that is why this Saturday at ConnectiCon is gonna be crazy because we're doing all that in one day.

500
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,012
Scott: We're going.

501
00:33:42,032 --> 00:33:44,941
Rym: we're doing 12 solid hours of entertainment.

502
00:33:45,342 --> 00:33:46,245
Rym: Wow from 1230 p.m.

503
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:47,851
Rym: Until 1130 p.m

504
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,113
Scott: Wow,

505
00:33:50,434 --> 00:34:06,966
Rym: and then if we survive because remember the one cool thing about ConnectiCon are the awesome after parties and I might have to not go to them even though I know of some really cool ones, but Anyway, if we survive Sunday morning, we're running a panel on German board gaming.

506
00:34:06,986 --> 00:34:09,233
Scott: Yep, basically the panel We're just gonna.

507
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:09,835
Scott: we're gonna?

508
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:10,658
Rym: no we're not.

509
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:11,159
Rym: No, we're not.

510
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,713
Rym: we're gonna croak miserably into microphones Cry.

511
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:25,341
Scott: we're gonna attempt to tell people who don't know anything about German board games and if only played Monopoly and such About the wonderful world of you know, Euro board gaming.

512
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:30,150
Scott: and it just so happens that ConnectiCon has an excellent gaming room But you can go and play these games.

513
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:39,670
Scott: So hopefully we'll be able to convince a whole bunch of people who don't who say German board game That sounds interesting and then we'll be able to convince them to go and play them right after the panel.

514
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,926
Rym: ConnectiCon has better gaming content than a lot of gaming cons.

515
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:43,730
Scott: It sure does.

516
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:54,821
Rym: In fact, I'd go so far as to say ConnectiCon is half gaming con And I'm probably gonna give away a board game or two because I happen to have a few board games laying around that are either Unopened even though they're awesome because I already own them.

517
00:34:54,841 --> 00:34:56,487
Scott: or that you don't want or that I don't want.

518
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,755
Rym: Yep I'll make it very clear which is which.

519
00:34:59,036 --> 00:35:03,430
Rym: yeah, so thus ConnectiCon this weekend is going to be awesome.

520
00:35:03,551 --> 00:35:04,888
Rym: If you were fans of us, yep.

521
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:12,046
Rym: However, if you want to hang out with us I will warn you that we will probably not have time to say hi at ConnectiCon.

522
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,290
Scott: no, probably not.

523
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:18,170
Scott: I mean maybe Friday night depending on when we get there, which I imagine might be 9 10 ish something like that.

524
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,830
Rym: Yeah, give or take we're probably gonna show out of bed get our badges and go straight to freakin sleep.

525
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:28,321
Scott: Yep, and Sunday after the German board gaming panel, you know I don't know how long we're gonna hang around.

526
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:29,730
Scott: We'll see what our plans are.

527
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:35,030
Rym: Yes, because you realize that pretty much right after ConnectiCon we have not a single moment of rest.

528
00:35:35,372 --> 00:35:37,890
Rym: And then we're gonna be at Otakon ready to run.

529
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:42,423
Scott: Basically three days of work after ConnectiCon is over and then leave.

530
00:35:42,443 --> 00:35:43,486
Scott: don't go to Otakon BAM.

531
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:44,770
Scott: It's gonna be that crazy.

532
00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:53,031
Rym: so, uh Otakon I'm not gonna get into the issues that they had with panels But partly due to the fact that we're friends with a few people on the staff Yes,

533
00:35:53,071 --> 00:36:03,250
Scott: we'll see how this turns out and I'm tell I guarantee you despite our favor for Otakon and our enjoyment of it We will not be dishonest in our reporting if things go poorly.

534
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:10,970
Rym: However, we did despite the snafu of panels managed to secure four panels at Otakon as well as an artist alley table.

535
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:17,889
Rym: Now one of them is gonna be with all the other Podcasters because I submitted it and they apparently also wanted to submit it.

536
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:20,810
Rym: So I basically rolled them both into one and then handed it back over to them.

537
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,059
Rym: But it's no big deal.

538
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,410
Rym: It's gonna be all our friend podcasters.

539
00:36:23,511 --> 00:36:26,389
Rym: We're gonna sit around and shoot the shit in front of a crowd for a while.

540
00:36:26,973 --> 00:36:29,366
Scott: Yeah, that'll probably be an off-the-cuff kind of panel.

541
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:30,090
Scott: be a lot of fun.

542
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,162
Scott: You know, if you like anime podcasters, there will be a lot of anime podcasters.

543
00:36:34,202 --> 00:36:36,770
Scott: They're talking about anime podcasting.

544
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,270
Scott: Yeah, possibly other anime manga topics.

545
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:42,663
Rym: We did this almost exact panel at sitcom and I recorded it.

546
00:36:42,964 --> 00:36:48,490
Rym: the recording was unusable But now we have the Mirand so we're probably gonna get an awesome recording of it.

547
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,161
Scott: Yep, so this will.

548
00:36:50,322 --> 00:36:55,389
Scott: even if you don't show up at Otakon You'll probably still be able to hear that panel on the internets in someone's feed.

549
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:57,174
Scott: Yep Maybe not ours, but someone's now.

550
00:36:57,214 --> 00:37:04,708
Rym: the second panel that we are responsible for but we are not actually running is a panel entitled kendo exclamation point.

551
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:09,204
Rym: Basically, our friend katsunori Matsushita is a yondan.

552
00:37:09,244 --> 00:37:10,187
Rym: I believe a yondan.

553
00:37:10,387 --> 00:37:12,755
Rym: I don't know how to say Alright, let me put it this way.

554
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:16,466
Rym: He is a badass motherfucker when it comes to kendo.

555
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:17,690
Rym: He's a certified instructor.

556
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:20,482
Rym: He was the friend the kendo club at RIT.

557
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:22,389
Rym: He trains in kendo.

558
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:30,349
Rym: Last year there were some kids playing with bokuto and shinai outside of Otakon and they were trying to spar with each other And it was kind of dangerous.

559
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:33,679
Rym: so katsu walks over and says can I spar?

560
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:36,755
Rym: and the guy says sure you ever done this before?

561
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:42,622
Rym: and katsu says once or twice and I'll find the pictures whenever I get a chance to post him up.

562
00:37:42,682 --> 00:37:44,410
Scott: We got to get a video the next time.

563
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,087
Rym: There are two frames of interest.

564
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:50,482
Rym: frame Number one is katsu standing there and the other guy looking very aggressive trying to hit katsu.

565
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:58,966
Rym: The second frame is a shinai one Nanometer away from this guy's eyeball and the guy screaming like a girl and falling over.

566
00:37:59,447 --> 00:38:00,350
Scott: katsu didn't even hit him.

567
00:38:00,851 --> 00:38:05,987
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's really awesome when you see him swing the stake because it's like the other guys.

568
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:14,209
Scott: they sort of you know They don't know how to really sword fight or kendo or anything, you know They they just kind of you know feel like they're mimicking movies or whatever.

569
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:23,463
Scott: And katsu just swings the stick really hard and really fast and he moves right in on you Like wicked fast like he's standing there and the next second.

570
00:38:23,523 --> 00:38:25,510
Scott: He's like swung the stick five times in your face.

571
00:38:25,812 --> 00:38:28,029
Rym: We have both tried to fight with katsu and it doesn't end.

572
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:33,912
Scott: well Yes, but standing off to the side and watching it there is not much that is as amusing I believe.

573
00:38:33,953 --> 00:38:34,534
Rym: the question.

574
00:38:34,555 --> 00:38:38,689
Rym: the guy that he owned asked afterward and I quote what is he?

575
00:38:40,703 --> 00:38:46,703
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so so if you want to learn about kendo a relative I mean, he's not the kendo master of the world.

576
00:38:46,844 --> 00:38:54,730
Scott: his dad is yeah But he's effectively a kendo master of some level far beyond the vast majority of kendo people in the world.

577
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,499
Rym: So he's gonna talk about the history of kendo.

578
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,790
Rym: He's gonna talk about the techniques and all that and the schools.

579
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:07,590
Rym: He's probably gonna demonstrate a bunch of training and a bunch of moves and most importantly Safety because a lot of kids hurt themselves with their stupid swords that they don't know how to use at the con.

580
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,918
Scott: Yes, and it's gonna show you how to be less stupid.

581
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:16,770
Rym: if the con will allow it at the end of the panel There's a good chance that katsu and I will end a long-running feud.

582
00:39:17,151 --> 00:39:22,106
Rym: The longest story short is that katsu was the president and ruler of the RIT kendo club.

583
00:39:22,146 --> 00:39:24,692
Rym: that we all found it a bunch of Us not me.

584
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:31,023
Rym: Yeah, not not Scott but a bunch of the rest of us in some political subterfuge at the at RIT.

585
00:39:31,063 --> 00:39:38,550
Rym: I Awesome because I felt a lot like sayonji and all that business from utana.

586
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:44,070
Rym: It was an honorary position that technically was supposed to go to the most skilled person in kendo.

587
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:45,650
Rym: So the president was elected.

588
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,885
Scott: You know the person who ran the president and the vice president be the same person.

589
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:52,090
Rym: if that were the case Then the vice president be the second best person.

590
00:39:52,230 --> 00:40:05,349
Rym: Okay, but due to the fact that I founded the club along with all of them for a good year I was the vice president because the rule was you have to challenge the vice president and I never showed up to the kendo club practices.

591
00:40:06,931 --> 00:40:16,610
Rym: so, uh, that was a dishonor that has been lingering for a long time and Katsu a long time ago challenged me for the title and I have yet to fight him.

592
00:40:16,811 --> 00:40:25,250
Rym: So if the con will let us and if they won't we'll probably do not some sort of liability insurance action Yeah But if they won't we'll probably do it at some point in our travels.

593
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:28,482
Rym: Katsu and I will have a short sparring match to demonstrate.

594
00:40:28,522 --> 00:40:33,316
Scott: basically Rym will hold the stick up in the air Drop the stick and run away.

595
00:40:33,336 --> 00:40:35,202
Rym: I can't run faster than him.

596
00:40:35,243 --> 00:40:36,286
Rym: That's my only power.

597
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:37,230
Rym: It's my secret attack.

598
00:40:37,431 --> 00:40:39,802
Scott: Well, you can run fast to them as long as you turn around.

599
00:40:40,144 --> 00:40:41,892
Scott: if you're sort of standing there He can like.

600
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:43,537
Scott: he shuffles really quick.

601
00:40:43,577 --> 00:40:44,781
Scott: That's like the sword shuffle.

602
00:40:44,922 --> 00:40:58,724
Scott: It's kind of surprising like you blink and he's right there Yeah, but like actually running like, you know in a marathon not so much but standing flat-footed and then suddenly being like 10 feet Forward like like snap you're 10 feet forward.

603
00:40:59,026 --> 00:41:01,415
Scott: It's like whoa, it's like Pretty cool.

604
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:03,430
Rym: So then we're not running it.

605
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:09,410
Rym: But again, this is one that I've spoken on pretty much every Otakon I've ever been to is the how to run an anime club.

606
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:16,890
Rym: we're usually Scott sits in the front of the room and Corrects people who make mistakes and answers questions kind of willy-nilly and I said I'll probably just sit there going?

607
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,760
Scott: Ah, I won't even be there.

608
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,530
Scott: who might sit at the artists alley you are?

609
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,590
Rym: You should probably go because I really want to send our reporters out to report on all the other panels.

610
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:31,197
Rym: Yeah, because I we need some ammo for our proposal a modest proposal to Otakon But it's usually a good.

611
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:35,390
Scott: I really don't want to go to a lot of those panels though We need to send other people to get report.

612
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:44,709
Rym: I know I mostly want to spend my time like I usually do in the live-action video room Yep, but our friend Scott Johnson runs this every year and it's usually a pretty good panel.

613
00:41:45,992 --> 00:41:49,569
Rym: It wasn't great last year, but there were issues and I think it'll be a lot better this year.

614
00:41:50,213 --> 00:41:57,686
Scott: Yep, so if you care about running anime clubs This is pretty much the premier how to run an anime club panel ever so you should go to it now.

615
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,833
Rym: last and most Awesome.

616
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:03,810
Rym: We are running gecky guy putting the man back in manga.

617
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:08,170
Scott: All right, we talked about this already cuz we're running at ConnectiCon but we are running it at Otakon.

618
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:15,927
Rym: We are running it at Otakon as far as I can see on Friday night from like midnight to 1 in the middle of the panels and it's gonna be 18 plus.

619
00:42:17,254 --> 00:42:19,151
Scott: Oh man, sorry for you under 18.

620
00:42:19,151 --> 00:42:26,815
Rym: Yes This is gonna be one of those because we realized that at Otakon the 18 plus primetime panels are Standing room.

621
00:42:26,936 --> 00:42:28,447
Rym: only hundreds of people turned away.

622
00:42:28,689 --> 00:42:33,309
Rym: Yep So we kind of wanted this panel to be 18 plus even though it didn't really need to be.

623
00:42:33,691 --> 00:42:36,564
Scott: However, we could have easily made it not 18 plus.

624
00:42:36,725 --> 00:42:37,750
Scott: we're doing that at ConnectiCon.

625
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:41,783
Rym: However, the fact that Gerald from anime world order is involved.

626
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:43,970
Rym: I think by Fiat makes it 18 plus.

627
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:50,487
Scott: Also the fact that you know be by making it 18 plus be intent, you know, but we didn't have to.

628
00:42:50,909 --> 00:43:01,604
Scott: we just Intentionally put some 18 plus stuff in there Which I think will not diminish the content of the panel because we will keep that content there But we will add extra content.

629
00:43:01,644 --> 00:43:03,192
Scott: That will be Humorous.

630
00:43:03,573 --> 00:43:07,004
Rym: in fact, I'm gonna let you all in on a secret because our audience is not you.

631
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,582
Rym: our audience is people who don't know About this stuff.

632
00:43:09,907 --> 00:43:23,090
Scott: Yes most of the I gotta be honest a lot of the reason we're running so many panels at cons is To tell everyone who comes to our panels and enjoys it They should fucking listen to GeekNights because it's just like coming to our panels every day four times a week.

633
00:43:23,512 --> 00:43:32,190
Scott: So we're gonna pull an Ava and if they're willing to pay money to go to a con to listen to our panel Then they'll sure as hell download a free mp3 four times a week to listen to our panel.

634
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:36,150
Rym: What we're gonna do is pull the bait and switch the panel.

635
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,730
Rym: Look, it's gonna be 18 plus putting the man back in manga.

636
00:43:40,091 --> 00:43:45,205
Rym: People are gonna expect something horrible because the panels going at the same time are all hentai panels.

637
00:43:45,385 --> 00:43:46,990
Rym: Yep, or yaoi or whatever.

638
00:43:47,411 --> 00:43:51,790
Rym: Yep, so we're gonna be in the sea of yaoi and hentai and all these 18 plus people.

639
00:43:52,232 --> 00:43:57,090
Rym: So they're gonna come in expecting the kind of thing that you get from an 18 plus panel and they're gonna get that.

640
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:09,381
Rym: But they're also gonna get a good half of the panel is going to be very informative And we're going to try to trick them in and then teach them about Real manga and history of manga and Tezuka and all that stuff

641
00:44:09,462 --> 00:44:13,213
Scott: and hopefully industry people will be there Recognizing that.

642
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:15,078
Scott: look see how crowded this panel is.

643
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:17,385
Scott: there is a demand for the manly mangas.

644
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:18,930
Scott: freaking bring them over here.

645
00:44:19,672 --> 00:44:22,041
Scott: You could probably get them real cheap because no one else wants them.

646
00:44:22,522 --> 00:44:24,690
Rym: I will point out we are not actually sexist.

647
00:44:24,811 --> 00:44:37,642
Scott: However, putting the man back in mom I think we're gonna have a big disclaimer at the beginning of this panel even at ConnectiCon because we're gonna say a lot of sexist things Just because a lot of the gecky guy is sexist and pretty horribly.

648
00:44:37,702 --> 00:44:38,143
Rym: That's.

649
00:44:38,484 --> 00:44:46,350
Scott: but while I disagree with the sexism It's entertaining and that's sort of one of the things that makes me like those sorts of mangas.

650
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:51,990
Scott: Yeah, it's like how I can like Death Note, even though I can't agree with Death Note at all.

651
00:44:52,632 --> 00:45:02,102
Rym: I think what the moral is going to be is do not come to our 18 plus gecky guy panel if you are easily Offended by the knowing it by the ranch as know-it-all something.

652
00:45:02,122 --> 00:45:03,606
Rym: Holy Daryl Surratt anything.

653
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:04,830
Rym: Yeah, Daryl Surratt.

654
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,330
Rym: Yes, if you're offended by Daryl Surratt do not come to our panel.

655
00:45:08,511 --> 00:45:10,804
Scott: Yeah, at least not a gag that one come to the other one.

656
00:45:10,865 --> 00:45:11,690
Rym: Yes come to the other ones.

657
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:15,042
Scott: Also at Otakon we have a table in the artists alley.

658
00:45:15,303 --> 00:45:17,390
Scott: it's a table in the way back near the bathroom.

659
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:20,410
Rym: We actually traded with someone else who practically begged us to move.

660
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,257
Scott: Yes, but they were also near the bathrooms.

661
00:45:22,738 --> 00:45:25,950
Scott: all our friends who have tables are spread out all over the artists alley.

662
00:45:26,032 --> 00:45:26,628
Scott: I looked at the map.

663
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:35,509
Scott: So we're not gonna have like a podcast alley within the artists alley or anything like that, which is sad Maybe next year, but there will be things to do at our table.

664
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:37,316
Rym: Yes All I'm going to say basically

665
00:45:37,557 --> 00:45:55,670
Scott: what we're gonna do is when we're not at an event or running an event We will be at the table and possibly we're gonna try to arrange it so that most of the time at least one of the front row crew will be manning the table and You can come to the table to get you know, talk to us or meet people or hang out or whatever.

666
00:45:56,171 --> 00:46:06,340
Scott: we're also at Otakon going to arrange an informal meetup at some point probably like last year and More information on that once the Otakon schedule comes out and we know what time we should do that.

667
00:46:07,342 --> 00:46:16,483
Scott: I Supercons This week is the last week of episodes of GeekNights.

668
00:46:16,543 --> 00:46:30,406
Scott: next week is gonna be like three episodes Maybe and the week after that for specials and we need people to You know make episodes of GeekNights to fill in that week of four specials or else you're gonna get Episodes you're gonna get last year last year.

669
00:46:30,627 --> 00:46:33,623
Rym: Yes Granted some people really like those episodes.

670
00:46:33,643 --> 00:46:35,090
Scott: Some people did like those episodes.

671
00:46:35,352 --> 00:46:35,776
Rym: You know what?

672
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:41,470
Scott: I like it poked in the eye - yes They like the episodes that someone else made for us more than they like those episodes.

673
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:47,246
Rym: Yes, and I just want to say again that Richard and Allison from movies You should see did a really good job and they're really cool people.

674
00:46:47,427 --> 00:46:48,911
Scott: Yep We'll see.

675
