00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,999
Rym: It's Wednesday January 3rd.

2
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:15,030
Scott: I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:21,338
Rym: Tonight we finally get around to talking about an absolutely fantastic anime project.

4
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:25,888
Rym: blue cheek you SOS Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:30,724
Rym: So it's anime day and nominally manga and comics day.

6
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:33,976
Scott: Whoo Took long enough to get to this day.

7
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:34,658
Rym: Yeah.

8
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:36,805
Rym: Well, we only didn't even do a Monday show this week.

9
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:37,488
Scott: Nope.

10
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:41,289
Scott: Nope I didn't do a Monday show the week before either.

11
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:44,458
Scott: Just all about not doing Monday shows.

12
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:45,260
Scott: That's fine.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,487
Rym: Cuz I got a good idea for Monday show for next week.

14
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:50,017
Rym: No, really Yeah, I think we're gonna have a pretty good.

15
00:00:50,157 --> 00:00:52,910
Rym: We're gonna get back on track starting next week with Mondays.

16
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:55,475
Scott: I think you might be shit talking.

17
00:00:55,575 --> 00:00:56,037
Scott: We'll see.

18
00:00:56,277 --> 00:00:56,679
Rym: We'll see.

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,290
Rym: We'll see what it's like Monday night when we're sitting around doing pre-production.

20
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:02,118
Scott: We will see what it's like.

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,809
Scott: Yeah, I cut myself with a box cutter today.

22
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:07,979
Rym: Why like we in some sort of box cutter fight?

23
00:01:08,139 --> 00:01:11,589
Rym: maybe maybe I was all right who won the box.

24
00:01:14,352 --> 00:01:20,450
Rym: In other news I have conquered the potato guns that con bad and I know God for us.

25
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:21,775
Scott: Oh, yeah, they gave us.

26
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:25,047
Scott: we got potato guns as gifts and potatoes randomly.

27
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:30,621
Rym: Yes, and You know clown pistols are well and good until you've had a potato gun.

28
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:33,590
Rym: Yeah that doubles as a one-shot water pistol.

29
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:39,998
Scott: Yeah, I mean and I tried to use it and it didn't work quite intuitively But it I thought it was all.

30
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:43,330
Scott: it's just a shitty $1 potato gun for the dollar store, but no metal.

31
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,016
Scott: It's a really good potato gun.

32
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:47,465
Scott: That's actually shoots potato pretty well.

33
00:01:47,505 --> 00:01:48,589
Scott: You just have to know how to use it.

34
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:55,432
Rym: Yep The trick is to jam the thing into the potato and then twist it off to the side to get a full-spud loadout Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:58,701
Scott: I still wish you had the kind of potato guns that shot whole potatoes.

36
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,068
Rym: We could make one in about 45 minutes.

37
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:03,219
Scott: We need some PVC pipe.

38
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:14,435
Rym: We need some PVC pipe and some ether That's right, or possibly some butane if we're wusses, we should make potato light bulbs also Right, so what's wrong?

39
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:19,889
Rym: potato light bulbs, I can't think of anything wrong with potato right bulbs, that's right That's right.

40
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:33,505
Rym: so in Useless and tossed aside anime news and I'll mention this only briefly only because I saw it and I couldn't believe it Airgear one of the worst shows to come out in recent memory.

41
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:35,230
Scott: that I mean that show with the rollerblading.

42
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,396
Scott: Yeah, well the the roller flying.

43
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:38,219
Rym: Yeah hard.

44
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:45,800
Rym: Here's the take the the fighting this of bleach But remove all the characters and everything interesting about it.

45
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:54,269
Scott: then take Dragon Ball Z and remove everything at all Except for the fighting and then wait, so wait see me Dragon Ball Z in its purest form.

46
00:02:54,449 --> 00:03:01,710
Rym: Yeah Yeah, and then take initial D and remove everything but the races and when I say everything I mean including the people talking during the races.

47
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:06,786
Rym: Uh-huh, and you get air gear a steaming pile of something horrible.

48
00:03:06,806 --> 00:03:08,130
Scott: You have to add rollerblades also.

49
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:09,961
Rym: They're not even really rollerblades.

50
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,510
Scott: They're like roller things.

51
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:11,932
Rym: You know what?

52
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:12,895
Rym: There are the roller.

53
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:15,184
Rym: break your neck because that couldn't happen in the real world.

54
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:15,806
Rym: That's right.

55
00:03:15,826 --> 00:03:18,138
Scott: work you die And it's exactly right.

56
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,930
Rym: All right, not only is this show crap.

57
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:27,226
Rym: I don't remember if we reviewed it or if we just said it sucked But well get a whole show on it saying it's a. I think we did.

58
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:27,989
Rym: it got picked up.

59
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:30,923
Rym: It's gonna be released in February by a DV.

60
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:33,793
Scott: Wow, okay.

61
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:40,210
Scott: So wait, they could pick up air gear perhaps one of the assets shows ever but they couldn't pick up.

62
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:44,364
Scott: I don't know What show are we watching Nana?

63
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:46,512
Scott: Yeah, Nana Let's see.

64
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:46,913
Scott: What else?

65
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:48,738
Scott: He know Tori's not on DVD.

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,481
Rym: Yeah.

67
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,145
Rym: No, but air gear is coming out.

68
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:52,028
Rym: So it's all okay.

69
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,263
Scott: great it's.

70
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,197
Rym: It's rated MA.

71
00:03:56,217 --> 00:03:57,182
Rym: I mean the show is not.

72
00:03:57,524 --> 00:03:58,267
Rym: I figured it first.

73
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:11,322
Rym: All right They're just targeting that, you know, nine to fourteen year old crap show demographic, which apparently is very profitable Mm-hmm, but the show is rated MA and it's got a lot of Nakedity in it.

74
00:04:11,707 --> 00:04:12,793
Scott: Yeah I thought he lit.

75
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:17,829
Scott: the dude lives in a house with a bunch of girls and he lusts after that one really awesome girl.

76
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:18,387
Scott: Who's better?

77
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,728
Scott: Roller flying than anyone else?

78
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,772
Rym: Yeah, this show is not good news, no, it's not and despite being not good news it got picked up Correct.

79
00:04:29,114 --> 00:04:32,349
Rym: I could talk more about it, but I think it stands on its own.

80
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:38,130
Scott: If I'm ever a bajillionaire, I'm gonna buy all the anime companies and only license the good shows.

81
00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:41,650
Rym: Yeah, remember how we were bitching about how the anime industry is secretive.

82
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:46,110
Rym: Yep, and then anime world order before that was bitching about the anime industry was secretive.

83
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:50,426
Rym: Well, they've been bitching again about how they anime industry is secretive.

84
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:58,250
Rym: great and I'm gonna bitch about it now to continue the cycle because I want to know what rationale they had to pick up this show.

85
00:04:58,614 --> 00:04:59,388
Rym: Who's gonna pay?

86
00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:05,190
Rym: $29.98 a DVD for four episodes of poorly animated kid rollerblading?

87
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:09,002
Scott: That's a good question because I don't know anyone like that.

88
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:10,990
Rym: I really want to know is this gonna be profitable?

89
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,223
Rym: I want to know if the show makes money, but there's no way to know.

90
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:15,066
Rym: I can't know.

91
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:18,289
Rym: there was absolutely No way for me to know if the show is successful or not.

92
00:05:18,662 --> 00:05:19,610
Scott: Nope But you know what?

93
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:26,310
Scott: I do know is that there are companies like vertical who are publishing high-class stuff like Buddha and ode to kirohito.

94
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:30,830
Scott: That not too many people read yet somehow they're very profitable.

95
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:36,150
Scott: So why cannot a TV do the same thing and publish the high quality high brow stuff?

96
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:42,510
Rym: That not too many people watch yet is somehow profitable cuz they probably spent like 14 million dollars on this air gear license.

97
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:45,698
Scott: I think what's happened is this could be true.

98
00:05:45,758 --> 00:05:46,360
Scott: I'm not sure.

99
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,130
Scott: is that maybe Japan has realized maybe that we're not?

100
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,150
Scott: They're not as dumb as we think they are because we always say all those Japanese don't understand the American anime industry, right?

101
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,696
Scott: Yeah Maybe the Japanese.

102
00:05:57,877 --> 00:06:18,010
Scott: when the first in when people went over there to try to license anime for the first time Those are super super super nerdy guys, right and Japan was probably like my Japanese animation industry was like hey These American anime industry guys are so dumb We can rip them off and they've been ripping us off for years and years and years and years.

103
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:24,667
Scott: American anime industry is just so dumb and so stupid though all those anime executives in the u.s.

104
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:25,630
Scott: Don't know shit.

105
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:31,030
Scott: that's why they keep dubbing things poorly and Paying too much for licenses from Japan.

106
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:33,112
Rym: Solved it.

107
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:35,719
Rym: They're probably sitting around in their secret space.

108
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:49,744
Scott: like we have faith that someone who's an executive must be a smart person Someone who's in charge of a big company that makes a lot of money that you know Does all this stuff and is still in business and still profitable must be a smart person.

109
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:51,590
Rym: SEO is still in business.

110
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,994
Scott: Yeah I think.

111
00:06:53,215 --> 00:07:06,790
Scott: I think it's becoming more apparent that a significant possibility that the people in charge of the anime companies in America are just all complete idiots every last one of them and Japan knows it and that's why it sucks for us.

112
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:11,110
Rym: We get a lot of feedback for the show and I can't wait to hear the feedback from that statement.

113
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,417
Scott: I can't wait either.

114
00:07:12,437 --> 00:07:22,009
Scott: so I said it cuz we I. I'm not saying it's true I'm saying it is a distinct possibility because anyone who licenses air gear and thinks it's going to sell.

115
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:25,770
Scott: I Couldn't come up with another reasonable conclusion.

116
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:33,850
Rym: What I wonder and I mean there are shows that are not good that make a lot of money And I wonder if these shows are profitable.

117
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:39,928
Rym: What if air gear makes them so much money that they had no choice but not to license it?

118
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:52,910
Scott: then I don't know what to say about American anime fans because you know Even though I know what to say about American though American anime fans right tend to kind of like shows like Naruto and bleach and these kind of crap fighting shows.

119
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:58,130
Scott: They tend to also dislike the same, you know, it's like everyone sort of agrees on what the crap is.

120
00:07:58,472 --> 00:08:01,369
Scott: You don't see air gear fans at the cons, you know.

121
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:06,710
Scott: And when you start bringing up good stuff, you know people all teens tend to agree on a lot of the good stuff.

122
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,485
Scott: Oh, yeah, even the even the Naruto and I was hanging out at an amazement.

123
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:11,630
Rym: There was a crowd of Naruto.

124
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:16,890
Rym: I was trying to quiet them down because they were making a ruckus at like 4 in the morning in the middle of the con.

125
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:27,061
Rym: They we started talking about anime and they all obviously very much like Naruto and they all also very much Understood that cowboy bebop was probably the best anime thing ever made.

126
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:27,763
Rym: Hmm.

127
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:28,485
Scott: So yeah.

128
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:31,841
Scott: Yeah speaking of cons Anime, it's the new year.

129
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:32,847
Rym: That was a very nice segue.

130
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:43,620
Scott: Yeah fair It's the new year and anime cons comm which is your number one site for anime con information has released their Year in review of anime cons.

131
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,684
Scott: It's pretty good article.

132
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:46,170
Rym: You probably want to read the whole article.

133
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,500
Rym: We're not obviously gonna comment on the whole I don't know.

134
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:56,769
Scott: they talk about stuff like how you know Clamp showed up to anime Expo and how anime next also made manga necks, etc.

135
00:08:57,111 --> 00:09:00,490
Rym: How Otakon and Katsucon both had artists alley controversies.

136
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,080
Scott: Well, no, they're talking about the Katsu.

137
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,030
Scott: if they were talking about Katsucon talking about the last Katsucon They only talked about the Otakon artists alley controversy.

138
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:14,250
Rym: Well, no, they mentioned Katsucon and the upcoming controversy because they've announced for Katsucon the new rules.

139
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,777
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but they don't talk about.

140
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:17,747
Scott: it's mostly about last year.

141
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:18,049
Scott: Yeah.

142
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:25,569
Scott: Yeah Anyway in this article is a list of the ten largest anime conventions in North America.

143
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:35,246
Scott: According to that cons reported attendance, so The thing is is you know, depending on how a specific convention counts their attendance.

144
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:35,908
Scott: I'm looking at you.

145
00:09:35,988 --> 00:09:36,710
Rym: anime Expo.

146
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:39,910
Scott: Yeah, we don't actually know how any cons report their attend.

147
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,010
Rym: Well, we know how Otakon and Katsucon a lot of those cards count them though.

148
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,330
Scott: Yeah, we're pretty sure we know but we're not a hundred percent sure.

149
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:57,606
Scott: so a lot of the numbers could be off but With the best estimates that are available to us These are the ten largest anime conventions in North America last year number one.

150
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,392
Scott: I'll start at the top Why not?

151
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:05,270
Scott: is anime Expo with forty thousand something people total and thirty two thousand?

152
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:08,440
Scott: Well about thirty three thousand of which actually paid to get in.

153
00:10:09,162 --> 00:10:11,028
Scott: about seven thousand people went for free.

154
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:19,730
Rym: eight thousand people yeah, I mean that in could that'll include like staff and Panelists dealers the dealers the artists alleys the guests.

155
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:20,533
Rym: Well, it depends.

156
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:23,829
Rym: some cons charge dealers to get into the con in addition to having.

157
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:25,740
Scott: yeah I don't know if they count as paid or not.

158
00:10:26,424 --> 00:10:33,980
Rym: I don't know tough call These are fuzzy numbers, but considering that I've been to many small not many But I've been to enough of these cons to where I think the numbers are accurate enough.

159
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:34,502
Scott: Yep.

160
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,251
Scott: Anime Expo is still huge Otakon.

161
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:43,372
Scott: it's estimated that there were about thirty three thousand total and about 22,000 paid.

162
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:50,009
Scott: Wow According to that estimate ten thousand people at Otakon getting free including us.

163
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:54,403
Rym: Yeah, Otakon does seem to be very liberal in its letting people in free.

164
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:56,710
Rym: I mean I've paid for one Otakon in my life.

165
00:10:57,252 --> 00:10:58,458
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

166
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,710
Rym: But then again, we've done stuff at every Otakon.

167
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:09,587
Scott: I know the question is it's like should Otakon keep letting all these people in free or Are there people getting in free that should be paying what?

168
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:14,763
Scott: That's a pretty big discrepancy between the total people there and the number of people paying.

169
00:11:14,823 --> 00:11:25,477
Rym: what Otakon should do very simply like a third Of the con is there for free is vet out somehow the quality of the panelists so that the people they're letting in free are Definitely worth.

170
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:33,614
Scott: Yeah, but if there's 10,000 total and 23,000 paid members The panelists are such a small portion of those 10,000 free.

171
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:33,854
Rym: now.

172
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:39,752
Rym: because remember think about how many panels there are and multiply that by four and then count all the dealers who pay For a table.

173
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:43,182
Scott: anyways, the dealers gotta pay like 750 bucks for a table.

174
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,064
Scott: a lot.

175
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:48,557
Scott: You know, if you don't make up like $750 and selling shit.

176
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,830
Scott: It's not a good deal to go to Otakon as a dealer.

177
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:58,870
Rym: Anyway, I don't know if I was the dealer I wouldn't go to Otakon just for the fact that the competition in the Otakon dealers room is fierce.

178
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:05,170
Scott: Yeah, I would go and buy spot in the dealers room of Otakon not to be a standard anime merchandise dealer.

179
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:12,449
Scott: But to do some other sort of dealing like, you know if I was another con or You know just a pimp GeekNights.

180
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:17,743
Scott: We've very much considered that it's not worth 750 though, not yet.

181
00:12:17,883 --> 00:12:19,610
Scott: Not yet artist Sally's much cheaper.

182
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:21,421
Scott: Okay, next comes a con.

183
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:23,352
Scott: I don't know where that is, but they had 12,500 people.

184
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:24,138
Scott: I think it's a Texas, right?

185
00:12:26,172 --> 00:12:26,966
Scott: I'm not quite sure.

186
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,210
Scott: It's been surprising that a con that I don't even know where it is is the third biggest.

187
00:12:31,732 --> 00:12:35,266
Rym: Of course right after that is anime north with pretty much the same number of people.

188
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:35,768
Scott: Yeah.

189
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:37,855
Scott: Oh, yep Akon's in Dallas.

190
00:12:38,277 --> 00:12:40,790
Rym: Yeah, we have a decent number of friends who go to anime north.

191
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:45,225
Scott: Yeah, anime north's in Canada and you know, I didn't think that that many people went to.

192
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,133
Scott: I thought it was a middling size Con.

193
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:48,961
Scott: apparently it's much larger than I thought.

194
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:50,710
Scott: it's like whoa, maybe we should head out there.

195
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:53,901
Scott: Yeah, the only problem in Montreal or is it in Toronto?

196
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:55,667
Rym: It's uh, it's in Ontario.

197
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:56,229
Rym: I'm pretty sure.

198
00:12:56,489 --> 00:13:04,780
Rym: yeah I honestly don't remember because every year I thought I'll go to anime north and I'd look and Another con would coincide with it to say in Toronto.

199
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:07,127
Rym: I don't want to go to Toronto me either.

200
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:10,497
Scott: Okay anime central still big.

201
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:19,550
Rym: and the thing is anime central doesn't look like it's grown very much because it I don't think it was Much smaller than that years and years ago when I used to attend on a regular basis.

202
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:22,500
Scott: Well, I think that cons are pretty much sort of.

203
00:13:22,922 --> 00:13:25,270
Scott: we're not gonna see a lot of con growth anymore.

204
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:33,549
Scott: You know, it's I mean unless you put there aren't too many places left for cons to be big That there isn't a con already.

205
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,710
Scott: Yeah, in fact a lot of cars aren't too many people who would go to cons that aren't already going to come.

206
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:44,950
Rym: Well part of it's that a lot of cons are in places where they get a lot of people and they would continue to grow.

207
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:52,744
Rym: But they can't fit more people where they are and there's no suitable venue near enough to where they currently are to keep most Of those people around.

208
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:59,930
Scott: yeah I'm pretty sure that every convention venue for anime cons in North America is already being used.

209
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:03,767
Scott: I think we're nearing like the What's it called?

210
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,535
Scott: terminal velocity of Con growth.

211
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:13,299
Rym: Well keep in mind once a beacon builds the con center on the waterfront We're gonna have to start see if they actually do that.

212
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:17,857
Rym: There aren't any anime conventions in Middling downstate New York yet.

213
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,350
Scott: Yeah that it would be a good place, but there's no venue.

214
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,487
Rym: Well, we got a way for that venue to be built.

215
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:28,747
Scott: Yep All right next comes fan of a con which I've heard the name and they estimate 10,000 people.

216
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:31,019
Scott: That's pretty good too.

217
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:32,408
Scott: There's a kind of didn't hear of.

218
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:32,710
Scott: I don't know.

219
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:34,361
Scott: I'd be on a click to find out where it is.

220
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:35,650
Rym: anime weekend, Atlanta.

221
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,002
Scott: That's anime world orders favorite con had about 9,000 people.

222
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:41,230
Scott: All right, so it's a half an Oda con.

223
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:42,433
Scott: It's not so bad.

224
00:14:42,474 --> 00:14:49,777
Rym: next anime Boston is another one that I've always wanted to go to but it always either conflicts with another con Or conflicts with another con.

225
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:51,904
Scott: Yeah, I don't know anime Boston.

226
00:14:51,964 --> 00:14:53,710
Scott: Oh, you know, it seems like a big con.

227
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:58,470
Scott: It seems like it's worth going to but it always conflicts with something.

228
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:01,044
Scott: I don't know what the timing of it is, but it's pretty bad.

229
00:15:01,185 --> 00:15:02,089
Scott: They should try to move it.

230
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,556
Scott: I think they would probably get more.

231
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:08,581
Scott: they probably be able to get over that 10,000 maybe like 15,000 Sakura con.

232
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:12,879
Scott: they said 8300 total 7,500 estimated paid.

233
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,005
Scott: doesn't Sakura con in Seattle.

234
00:15:15,306 --> 00:15:16,430
Rym: I think it's out in Washington.

235
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:18,725
Scott: Yeah, I think that's competing with the packs.

236
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:26,770
Scott: Yeah as basically competing with packs sort of for the North Pacific Coast Convention crowd.

237
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:33,555
Rym: Yeah Anyway last and certainly not least the con that we will be talking about a lot in weeks to come because we are going to be Doing awesome things at it.

238
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:33,936
Rym: katsu.

239
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:34,398
Rym: Con.

240
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:36,788
Scott: Yeah, we're going to katsu con the 10th biggest con.

241
00:15:36,808 --> 00:15:40,662
Scott: apparently 6,400 people estimated about 6,000 paid.

242
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:40,983
Scott: All right.

243
00:15:41,485 --> 00:15:50,170
Rym: Yeah, and so we're gonna be in When like a month the weekend around February 18th, I think 18th is the Sunday when we'll be driving back home.

244
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:56,910
Scott: Okay, so that weekend katsu con we're gonna be there doing more than we have ever done at any convention ever.

245
00:15:57,411 --> 00:16:02,548
Scott: Yeah, except I think yeah, I think katsu cons problem is they say katsu con.

246
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:09,050
Scott: in the article It says how katsu con used to be keeping pace with Otakon because it is in a relatively similar geographic location.

247
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:22,090
Scott: I think the problem the reason katsu con hasn't been growing is because the hotel and transportation situation in DC is pretty difficult Whereas in at least in Baltimore, there's a bunch of hotels all around the convention center.

248
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:22,584
Rym: Well, they're.

249
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:31,510
Rym: I mean I've gone to several katsu cons and there I think a lot of reasons why katsu con is not growing that much anymore And why in fact, it seems to be kind of stagnant not that it isn't a good con.

250
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,086
Rym: But yeah, DC really just kind of sucks to travel to.

251
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:37,677
Rym: I mean It's difficult to fly there and get to the con.

252
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:41,230
Rym: the hotel fills up and you got to get shoved into some overflow hotel somewhere.

253
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:43,990
Rym: The Metro is not terribly useful.

254
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:50,610
Rym: The hotels are so expensive that it cost me a lot more money to go to katsu con than it does to go to Otakon.

255
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:58,630
Rym: Yeah quite a bit more Yeah, and also the vibe of katsu con is very different from other cons.

256
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,590
Rym: The crowd tends to be older tends to be a lot more people our age there.

257
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:15,990
Rym: there's a lot more drinking a lot more older people walking around talking quietly about anime and There's really not so much of a young kid family-friendly presence that a lot of other cons seem to exude.

258
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:19,606
Scott: They also talk about the lack of growth of Otakon.

259
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:27,647
Scott: like compared You mean Otakon did grow but compare usually Otakon grows tremendously and this year they only grew by a little bit and didn't reach their cap.

260
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:31,401
Scott: and they have a separate article about why that isn't such.

261
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:41,870
Scott: and I'm really starting to think that One big barrier to a lot of cons growing any further is the fact that hotel and transportation situations are kind of difficult.

262
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:43,640
Scott: Yeah I mean we're tired of dealing with it.

263
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:44,365
Rym: Otakon.

264
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:54,726
Rym: last year every hotel in the city was sold out like months and months and months before the con and I bet there's a lot of people who probably wanted to go to Otakon but couldn't get a hotel and just gave up.

265
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,450
Scott: and There's a lot of people who would go to Otakon because it's fun time.

266
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:09,628
Scott: They're not saying it's not a fun time or that they don't want to go but it's just not worth even if they get a hotel room and it's just such a hassle to do it and Get there and transport that it's not worth it.

267
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:15,170
Rym: Of course Those people should listen to our three-part series on how to attend anime cons to learn that that's not true.

268
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,336
Rym: You can go to cons very easily if you plan a little bit.

269
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:22,913
Scott: Yeah, but you know, there's not enough smart people - You don't need to be smart.

270
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:36,857
Rym: You just need to listen to GeekNights that that would be smart though Things of the day Hot damn.

271
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:46,120
Scott: So, you know all those videos that like the stop-motion things you see where people jump take a picture jump Take a picture and then eventually, you know, it looks like they're flying around on their knees.

272
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,460
Scott: There's been a lot of them on YouTube lately or the ones where you know.

273
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,000
Scott: They take a picture of him standing then standing a little bit to the right and then he slides around.

274
00:18:55,141 --> 00:19:12,798
Scott: Well, this is nothing new Like I thought it was something new when I saw it, you know about a couple years ago on the Internet's, you know with the famous And Yeah, well apparently some guys in 1952 or 53 beat him to it if I may.

275
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:13,100
Rym: yes

276
00:19:13,782 --> 00:19:38,240
Scott: It was some Canadian that like the national Canadian film, whatever it's called made a video in 1952 in cut while and I guess not a video a film in 1952 in color with a story of these two guys who were neighbors and they fight over this flower that grew You know right between their properties and such, you know, and it's got this message of love thy neighbor and whatnot.

277
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:46,506
Scott: But the point of it is it does the cool stop-motion stuff that everyone has been doing recently on YouTube that they seem to think Is so awesome, you know these.

278
00:19:46,526 --> 00:19:50,560
Scott: they do the whole jumping up and down thing and they do some other stuff, too.

279
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:56,229
Scott: That's a lot more creative and interesting than what anyone else has done At least when anyone else has done recently that I've seen.

280
00:19:56,249 --> 00:19:58,378
Rym: this is definitely worth watching it.

281
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,543
Scott: Plus it was 1952 people.

282
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:03,492
Scott: you are not original nor creative.

283
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:20,698
Rym: Well by that logic I mean Right, so over the weekend the party one of our dear friends Lisa showed us a video that her brother had done and this video is now currently on YouTube.

284
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,800
Rym: and Normally, we wouldn't have such an incestuous linking for a thing of the day, but this is pretty damn funny.

285
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:37,790
Scott: Yeah, usually, you know some kid makes a video for a school project or whatever and sometimes they're okay and sometimes they're kind of Lame, but this is actually pretty good.

286
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,980
Scott: I mean it's about lucid dreaming and coca puffs.

287
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,828
Rym: Yeah, I don't really want to ruin it.

288
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:59,920
Rym: But suffice to say the operative point here is that Whenever someone is killed in this dream or whenever there is blood instead of actual blood or gore Appearing it is replaced by cocoa puffs which can be eaten to induce a state not unlike the quickening from Highlander.

289
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,042
Rym: awesome, and I don't know.

290
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,487
Rym: I just watched this video.

291
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:08,938
Rym: It's like 10 minutes long and I guarantee it's worth laughing at.

292
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,146
Scott: yeah I mean I laughed a few times.

293
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:14,140
Scott: I thought it was gonna be lame or whatever and it wasn't really lame.

294
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:18,020
Rym: I remember what time when you didn't kill your friends and eat their cocoa puffs.

295
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:26,220
Rym: Yeah So tonight we're going to talk about something that I can't believe we haven't talked about.

296
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,879
Scott: well, I think we were going to talk about it and then we held off for a week.

297
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:34,240
Scott: and What happened was you just never ended up actually making a show about it.

298
00:21:34,642 --> 00:21:39,187
Rym: Yeah, cuz I thought back I could practically remember talking about it But now we never.

299
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:44,660
Scott: we might have mentioned it in passing But we clearly did not have an episode on it where we talked about it in enough detail.

300
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,092
Scott: Talked about on the forums though.

301
00:21:47,132 --> 00:21:50,720
Scott: So people on the forums You probably know about this already.

302
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:57,700
Rym: Yeah This is something special and I really think that everyone out there who is that any way shape or form a fan of anime or?

303
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,662
Rym: Science fiction will want to see this Okay.

304
00:22:00,682 --> 00:22:04,674
Scott: Well first off there was this guy named Shigeru Komatsuzaki.

305
00:22:04,694 --> 00:22:11,647
Scott: now, he's sort of an important guy basically way Back in the day like the 40s.

306
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:16,660
Scott: He was a famous Japanese science fiction illustrator and model designer.

307
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:21,945
Rym: Now he has worked on such notables as Thunderbirds Atragon.

308
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,980
Scott: Yeah, he did a lot of shit.

309
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:34,952
Scott: basically Atragon was this boat with a big drill on the front that could fly and shoot and it was sort of crazy and It was his famous science fiction novel.

310
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:41,179
Scott: I don't know if he wrote the novel, but he Definitely illustrated the Atragon and designed the ship and all that sort of stuff.

311
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:44,978
Scott: And that novel had a lot of things based on it.

312
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:45,420
Scott: a lot.

313
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:53,698
Scott: there was a live-action movies Atragon which because of marketing reasons were merged with the kaiju universe of Godzilla.

314
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:55,147
Rym: and Now think about that.

315
00:22:55,207 --> 00:23:02,740
Rym: in America when they want to market something They always add like a product that they can sell like when Home Alone 2 came out they added that talk boy thing.

316
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:06,080
Rym: They always have some sort of product tie-in for marketing or like a little kid.

317
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:10,554
Scott: So rather than take the great sci-fi story of Atragon just make a live-action movie.

318
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:12,380
Scott: They made a kaiju movie.

319
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:16,998
Rym: What does that say about Japan when if you want to alter something for marketing you add kaiju to it?

320
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:19,391
Scott: Yep anyway, that's what they did.

321
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:25,080
Scott: and There's an anime Atragon, which is a two-part OAV called super Atragon.

322
00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:31,731
Scott: We watched this after Otakon a couple years ago Because somewhat Scott Johnson bought it for cheap in the dealer's room.

323
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,898
Rym: Scott Johnson bought a DVD for cheap.

324
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:35,319
Scott: gee When does that happen?

325
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:36,882
Scott: I don't know what.

326
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:40,660
Scott: wait wait as he does he not bought a DVD for cheap in the last five seconds.

327
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,483
Scott: That might be a record.

328
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:46,960
Rym: We have it on good authority that the source material for super Atragon is very very good.

329
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,137
Scott: Yeah, apparently this the original novel of Atragon is awesome.

330
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:51,900
Scott: Really awesome.

331
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,937
Scott: But I can't find it in English or I would buy it and read it now.

332
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:59,363
Scott: the anime The two part OAV of super Atragon Not so great.

333
00:23:59,543 --> 00:23:59,965
Scott: Not good.

334
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:00,868
Scott: No, no.

335
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:01,812
Rym: It starts out.

336
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:03,800
Rym: actually it starts out really really good.

337
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,249
Rym: It has so much potential.

338
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,819
Rym: It looks like it's gonna be so cool.

339
00:24:07,544 --> 00:24:16,040
Rym: And I mean it starts out with like nuclear bomb going off like Hiroshima time and then crazy stuff happening and aliens in the sea and submarines.

340
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:29,760
Rym: But I guess the OAV cut all everything that was good out in order to make the adaptation from the novel and what we had left was mediocre animation and a long Meandering plot that doesn't really go anywhere.

341
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:41,940
Scott: But you can tell when you're watching super Atragon that whatever this was based on wherever they got The ideas for this particular, you know, it's the way they tell the story in super Atragon that sucks.

342
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,218
Scott: But you can tell that the original story that they are telling you was good before they told it.

343
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:52,460
Scott: Yes It's like some guy trying to tell you about something awesome that happened, but he doesn't know how to speak.

344
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:54,159
Scott: That's what super Atragon is.

345
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:57,009
Scott: Anyway way back in the day.

346
00:24:57,732 --> 00:25:04,996
Scott: This guy made some Illustrations called earth SOS and they were pretty cool illustrations.

347
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:07,505
Scott: I'd like to see them Just now.

348
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:10,998
Scott: well, not just now but when July.

349
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:22,289
Scott: I think Yeah in July of 2006 through December 3rd 2006 some people because Come on Tzuzaki died, I think in late 2001 early 2002.

350
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:22,790
Scott: Yeah, not too long.

351
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,312
Scott: He was 85 though.

352
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,319
Scott: So, I mean, come on, you know get the guy credit.

353
00:25:30,341 --> 00:25:37,262
Scott: They decided to make a six-part OAV based on the earth SOS Illustrations.

354
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:44,283
Rym: this is called predictably enough project blue earth SOS orange pen project blue cheek you SOS.

355
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:49,160
Rym: if you can't figure out what the word cheek you means I suggest you stop listening to our show.

356
00:25:50,770 --> 00:26:04,603
Scott: all right project blue earth SOS is kind of difficult for us in the English-speaking world to see because well only one episode has been translated and put on the internet as far as I can tell yeah And a few of our friends.

357
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:11,126
Rym: we haven't tried but other people have looked around for Roz and not really found much of anything Outside of the first episode.

358
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,793
Scott: Yeah, it's a six-part OAV.

359
00:26:13,336 --> 00:26:26,600
Scott: It was on TV I don't know but you know They put them all on TV one at a time and I think it's done now, but It's got to be on DVD at some point and when that happens, we'll eventually see it.

360
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:30,956
Rym: I guarantee this is gonna come over to America in some way shape or form.

361
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:36,099
Rym: if nothing else It'll get released on DVD in Japan and then the fansubbers will make quick work of it.

362
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:46,286
Rym: Yeah, now we can't talk a lot about what goes on in the show because in the first episode It's basically a lot of build-up a lot of setting Everything call the puzzle piece.

363
00:26:46,306 --> 00:26:56,818
Rym: character introductions set up you're introduced to all the characters and then at the end of this first episode All hell breaks loose and then the show begins in earnest and that is right when the closing credits start.

364
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,792
Scott: Yep It's freaking awesome.

365
00:26:59,872 --> 00:27:00,556
Scott: Holy shit.

366
00:27:01,018 --> 00:27:06,092
Rym: I The basic premise here is that now well first off the style.

367
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,016
Rym: the style is really cool.

368
00:27:08,117 --> 00:27:22,180
Scott: It's kind of a mix between futurism and Read or die plus Encyclopedia brown plus at your God and you get this show and you get this show.

369
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:29,267
Scott: It's if you've watched read or die not the TV series the original OAV and yeah The TV series can die in a fire.

370
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:42,040
Scott: You like that kind of style where you know there's people doing all kinds of high action stuff with fancy gadgets and Technologies, but there's also this sort of old style at the same time.

371
00:27:42,642 --> 00:27:43,646
Scott: That's what actually good.

372
00:27:43,766 --> 00:27:47,180
Scott: that's not what actually guys that's what project blue earth SOS is.

373
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:53,197
Rym: I mean the setting the way it's set up It's kind of like the future as it was probably imagined by people in the 50s.

374
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,477
Scott: Well, I think it's based on a guy's illustrations from the 40s.

375
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:04,880
Scott: So he was drawing what he thought the future would look like which means he was including the technology from his time.

376
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:05,746
Scott: You know, it's.

377
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:09,785
Scott: it's what this guy thought the future would look like The way the anime is done.

378
00:28:09,825 --> 00:28:15,040
Rym: I thought there's a lot of aesthetic liberty taken and it definitely they're going for the retro future.

379
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Rym: Look, I mean part of the opening is that there's this new maglev train using a special g-reactive engine.

380
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,610
Rym: It's like the future of transportation and energy.

381
00:28:25,514 --> 00:28:26,959
Rym: It's a maglev train.

382
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:30,651
Rym: maglev Future future maglev awesome.

383
00:28:31,194 --> 00:28:39,580
Rym: all the reporters lined up Documenting this are using old-style cameras with flash bulbs like old flash bulbs.

384
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:51,655
Rym: So the guy holds up the stick and it goes poof and they they're recording on to reel to reel film not digital Recorders or anything like that and then it like it shows a shot of the city and they're all.

385
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:57,140
Rym: there's all these elevated trains going Around but the elevated trains have propellers on the front pulling them.

386
00:28:57,401 --> 00:29:02,643
Scott: Yeah, this guy's at one point they sit down to watch a movie to learn Oh, that's the best part.

387
00:29:03,164 --> 00:29:18,029
Scott: the butler pushes a button and down from the ceiling this automatic lowering thing Pulls down a reel to reel video projector with the film already loaded and then you get this grainy Flickering thing that they all watch.

388
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:19,898
Scott: meanwhile, they have hover cars.

389
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:23,410
Rym: Hover cars that look like 1950s car.

390
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,699
Scott: Yeah hover cars, but the controls are like 1950s buttons.

391
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:44,166
Rym: I think the other one of my other favorite parts is when there's a car chase a really well done and quite interesting car chase where the hover car at one point she the person driving it needs to turn around and spin and do something cool and proceeds to work the clutch and shift gears.

392
00:29:44,427 --> 00:29:50,760
Rym: and I really wonder what the hell she was doing shifting gears on a thing that has no possible.

393
00:29:52,364 --> 00:29:53,588
Rym: I can't imagine what that did.

394
00:29:54,190 --> 00:30:01,613
Scott: I don't know either but it's you know, it seems silly But when you actually watch it, you don't really know.

395
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:03,420
Scott: it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb.

396
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:06,676
Scott: It's just this really awesome read-or-die kind of style.

397
00:30:06,716 --> 00:30:10,247
Scott: That's very Awesome, especially if you're an anime fan.

398
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,556
Scott: if you're an anime fan, you'll just watch this single.

399
00:30:12,596 --> 00:30:12,997
Scott: Holy shit.

400
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:15,045
Scott: It's all awesome Holy crap, awesome.

401
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:15,266
Scott: Awesome.

402
00:30:15,306 --> 00:30:15,467
Scott: Awesome.

403
00:30:15,487 --> 00:30:16,972
Rym: Even if you're not an anime fan.

404
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:27,130
Rym: I mean, this is the kind I remember way way back I showed my dad a read-or-die and he thought it was pretty badass even though you know It's kind of weird and you really really wouldn't think that.

405
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:35,500
Rym: I guess non anime fans would like that sort of thing But there's a certain level of that kind of aesthetic beyond which even normal people will love this.

406
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,303
Scott: I think it's just.

407
00:30:36,764 --> 00:30:50,320
Scott: it just feels really fun to watch all this stuff because you have that like the bright colors and You have some sort of familiarity with this old technology While at the same time you go ooh and aah at this fancy future sci-fi shit.

408
00:30:51,027 --> 00:31:01,419
Rym: I mean while they're doing you know There's the reporters with their flash bulbs and this maglev train and then one of the main characters Billy Kimura Kimura comes down out of the sky on this crappy jetpack.

409
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:05,003
Scott: Yep Good times.

410
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:20,130
Rym: So the actual plot is that scientists in 1995 have developed this G reactive engine Which they're not really very detailed on what this G reactive engine is at all and it requires people is fuel something like that.

411
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:29,020
Rym: I Get the impression that it's more just very high technology like something beyond what humans would normally be capable of.

412
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,696
Scott: Yep, but they've got this thing and they test it out on a fighter jet Which is where you test out all new engines.

413
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,251
Rym: now We're gonna spoil the first five minutes because this is we can't.

414
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:43,300
Rym: we don't want to spoil the awesomeness that happens later But we have to spoil something or there's really nothing we can say.

415
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:49,580
Rym: Yeah, so they're testing this awesome reactive engine and this jet takes off and it goes crazy crazy fast.

416
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:56,284
Rym: It's a total success like mach 13 14 15 21 22 23 Stupid fast.

417
00:31:56,645 --> 00:31:58,149
Rym: So the test is a success.

418
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:11,613
Rym: before the test pilot can come back this weird Rainbow glow appears and before anyone knows it the ship and all the stuff Disappears, yep, so the react and right before the guy disappeared.

419
00:32:11,654 --> 00:32:13,600
Scott: He was like UFO Oh God.

420
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:19,556
Rym: So now this reactive engine has disappeared and everything associated with it and the research scientists are sitting there going.

421
00:32:19,576 --> 00:32:23,041
Rym: Ah Fuck.

422
00:32:23,683 --> 00:32:25,649
Rym: so then fast forward there.

423
00:32:25,689 --> 00:32:27,977
Rym: They've got this maglev train the G reactive engine.

424
00:32:28,137 --> 00:32:28,960
Rym: They know it's a success.

425
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,321
Rym: yeah, the

426
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:31,546
Scott: show takes place like five years after that

427
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:40,819
Rym: and they're about to debut the first maglev G reactive train and Obviously something happens at this point or else there wouldn't be a show

428
00:32:41,381 --> 00:32:41,522
Scott: Mm-hmm

429
00:32:41,903 --> 00:32:46,799
Rym: not really gonna ruin any more than that other than that a dog climbs up a ladder faster than a human could.

430
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:53,959
Scott: That was a good part when the dog went up the ladder, I mean the characters are all young and awesome.

431
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:55,805
Scott: Lotta breast.

432
00:32:56,368 --> 00:32:58,298
Scott: Yeah, there is a character named.

433
00:32:58,338 --> 00:33:05,839
Scott: Dr breast and he has a daughter who is like eight and her name is Lotta breast l o TTA space BR ESD.

434
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:15,045
Rym: now I know that the Japanese people are overall a very intelligent people and there's no doubt in my mind that that was fully Intentional there.

435
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,453
Scott: It has to be intentional.

436
00:33:16,493 --> 00:33:17,660
Scott: There's no way that I can.

437
00:33:18,642 --> 00:33:21,976
Rym: The little girl's name is Lotta breast her older sister.

438
00:33:22,076 --> 00:33:22,960
Scott: It's not her sister.

439
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,734
Scott: It's like this girl who like hangs out with her what I like her nanny or some whatever.

440
00:33:27,774 --> 00:33:31,526
Rym: the woman who she is often with Is could be described as smoking.

441
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:32,228
Scott: Yeah.

442
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,873
Scott: Oh, I mean for an anime character.

443
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:34,073
Scott: Sure.

444
00:33:34,535 --> 00:33:35,036
Rym: Well, yeah.

445
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:40,759
Rym: Yeah, obviously I preferred two-dimension to women.

446
00:33:42,128 --> 00:33:52,440
Rym: Good luck with it Yeah, but we've also got penny Carter who was kind of this Vagabond smart kid who has his dog Washington Washington being the best character.

447
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:54,046
Scott: It's actually penny Carter.

448
00:33:54,327 --> 00:34:03,900
Scott: is this sort of poor or he's not poor but he's an MIT Graduate and he's sort of like the lone hacker where the dog right and he's real smart and he gets shit done.

449
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:11,360
Scott: Meanwhile, you also have Billy Kimura who is like a mega zillionaire kids you and he's also really smart.

450
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:22,560
Scott: So you've got like two encyclopedia Browns with the same goals Competing to see who does it first and one of them's like just some poor smart kid and one of them's a rich smart kid.

451
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,815
Rym: Now add to that effectively penny from Inspector Gadget.

452
00:34:26,217 --> 00:34:30,487
Rym: Yep, and A bunch of other super badass people.

453
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:32,094
Rym: I can't say anything more about that.

454
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:32,676
Scott: You know, it is.

455
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:35,906
Scott: it's like penny Carter And also he has a dog.

456
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:38,554
Scott: He's like the male penny from Inspector Gadget.

457
00:34:38,755 --> 00:34:41,697
Rym: Yeah, except everyone's badass There's no non badass.

458
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:44,362
Scott: What's?

459
00:34:44,402 --> 00:34:53,576
Scott: his name is not so much bad, I don't know how much Captain Clayton I don't know how much of a character he's gonna be long-term I don't know how much either but Captain Clayton is sort of not a bad.

460
00:34:53,596 --> 00:34:54,300
Scott: Oh, you know who else is?

461
00:34:55,202 --> 00:35:00,718
Rym: Those two guys who get axed who got axed those guys who get shot by that thing halfway through the show.

462
00:35:00,738 --> 00:35:01,360
Rym: Okay?

463
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:03,549
Rym: Those guys were not so badass.

464
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:04,835
Scott: They weren't real characters though.

465
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:05,578
Scott: They didn't have names.

466
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:09,160
Scott: No No, anyone with the name is at least kind of badass.

467
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,972
Scott: I mean Captain Clayton is at least smart a little bit But everyone else is just super awesome like haha.

468
00:35:16,153 --> 00:35:17,559
Rym: and they're super awesome in the reader.

469
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:17,920
Rym: die way.

470
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:24,097
Rym: This is the kind of show where if you show to a crowd of people there will be regular and periodic yelling shouting screaming and cheering.

471
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,146
Rym: Mm-hmm, you know guys will get trapped and the army guys yelling at him and then the army guy gets distracted for a second Cuts back.

472
00:35:31,428 --> 00:35:32,374
Rym: the two chairs are empty.

473
00:35:32,394 --> 00:35:33,139
Rym: The crowd goes nuts.

474
00:35:33,662 --> 00:35:36,454
Scott: Yeah, you know now that I realize that this came from a trigon.

475
00:35:36,494 --> 00:35:42,539
Scott: I see a lot of similarities, you know the there's the UFOs kind of thing, but no one really knows about it.

476
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:48,200
Scott: and You know, there's the big ships of mystery and there's a lot of similarities.

477
00:35:48,582 --> 00:35:51,916
Rym: There's a lot of mystery that's probably going to be revealed as the show goes on.

478
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:56,572
Rym: Mm-hmm I mean, they really lay it on pretty thick too with that green-haired girl.

479
00:35:57,175 --> 00:35:58,740
Scott: Oh man that they lay it on heavy.

480
00:35:59,261 --> 00:36:01,067
Scott: It's like whoo, here's a green-haired girl.

481
00:36:01,127 --> 00:36:03,875
Scott: She appears mysteriously before two characters.

482
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:04,657
Rym: Oh, don't forget.

483
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:05,780
Rym: She says something cryptic.

484
00:36:06,002 --> 00:36:07,997
Scott: She says something cryptic and then disappears.

485
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,878
Rym: That one thing to be said about this show is that each episode is 45 minutes long.

486
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,880
Rym: So it goes longer than what you'd expect from but there's only six episodes.

487
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:24,203
Scott: So it's kind of like getting six mini movies because the first episode in itself I watched it.

488
00:36:24,644 --> 00:36:30,144
Scott: you could have told me that that was an anime movie or something like that and I would have believed you Totally well.

489
00:36:30,164 --> 00:36:35,279
Rym: plus it it'll play out like a 13 episode show probably in terms of the amount of plot in it.

490
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,951
Rym: Because while it's 45 minutes, that is an action-packed 45 minutes.

491
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:40,492
Rym: They don't.

492
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,217
Rym: you will never get bored watching this.

493
00:36:42,718 --> 00:36:49,660
Scott: Mm-hmm It's so sad because you know when it comes to new anime, there is not a great quantity of it.

494
00:36:49,901 --> 00:36:51,146
Rym: Well, I mean, what are we watching right now?

495
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:51,969
Rym: We're watching Nana.

496
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:52,491
Rym: Yep.

497
00:36:52,772 --> 00:36:54,740
Scott: There's Death Note, but we read the manga already.

498
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:57,659
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna watch like five key episodes from Death Note and that's it.

499
00:36:57,881 --> 00:36:59,837
Scott: But we'll see how much time I have to watch it.

500
00:37:00,842 --> 00:37:07,140
Scott: The Kemo Nozomi whatever is kind of okay But we have to see where that goes and you have to wait for it to come out or whatever.

501
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,729
Rym: Yeah, pretty much the previous set of TV shows.

502
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,773
Rym: We haven't watched yet.

503
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,500
Rym: So we're not even looking at what's coming out now?

504
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:14,552
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing coming out now.

505
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:15,819
Scott: We have to wait for a new season again.

506
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:18,430
Scott: It'll be a few months and then there'll be more anime.

507
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,474
Rym: Yeah, maybe we'll catch up.

508
00:37:19,896 --> 00:37:21,605
Scott: Maybe we will catch up Maybe not who knows?

509
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:22,712
Rym: of course catch up.

510
00:37:22,732 --> 00:37:27,987
Rym: We're also currently watching A standalone complex second gig finally.

511
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:35,569
Scott: Yep, but I mean of all the newer anime, you know this came out in 2006. this is the thing to be most excited about.

512
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:38,520
Scott: it's probably the best anime of the past year or two hands down.

513
00:37:38,801 --> 00:37:40,066
Rym: I'm real excited about this.

514
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:41,673
Rym: I mean pretty much.

515
00:37:41,774 --> 00:37:43,280
Rym: Nana is what brought my favorite show.

516
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:48,200
Scott: It's like I watch Nana, you know, and I like it and it's good, but I'm not excited about it.

517
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,625
Scott: I'm not like oh Nana.

518
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,508
Scott: I can't wait for more.

519
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,315
Scott: This is like I need to have this now.

520
00:37:52,636 --> 00:37:53,138
Scott: Where is it?

521
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:53,720
Scott: What the fuck?

522
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,065
Scott: I want to buy a DVD.

523
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:56,591
Scott: here is $50.

524
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:57,113
Scott: Where is it?

525
00:37:57,354 --> 00:37:57,796
Scott: You're dumb.

526
00:37:57,836 --> 00:37:58,840
Scott: Why did you not give it to me?

527
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:03,300
Rym: Yeah, I guess what I could say just for mostly for the benefit of people who might be listening.

528
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:12,089
Rym: I don't know months or years from now from the archives if you see project blue earth SOS in DVD form No matter what it costs.

529
00:38:12,129 --> 00:38:13,757
Rym: There is no reason not to buy it.

530
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:21,240
Scott: Yeah, I mean if there's a Japanese if you speak Japanese you should just buy the region 2 DVD.

531
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:25,072
Scott: Yeah, right now if you can play it, there's really no reason not to.

532
00:38:25,092 --> 00:38:30,475
Scott: I mean, there's the only hesitation I have is that we've only seen the first 45 minute episode.

533
00:38:30,495 --> 00:38:31,440
Rym: You're worried at my gonzo.

534
00:38:31,941 --> 00:38:41,620
Scott: Well, it does take a strong turn at the end of the first episode and I imagine that turn Leads into the plot of the remaining five episodes.

535
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:47,797
Scott: So it could be that after it takes that turn the show is not as good.

536
00:38:47,817 --> 00:38:48,860
Scott: I highly doubt it.

537
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:51,838
Rym: Yeah, cuz I mean it would be so hard to screw it up.

538
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,489
Rym: Chevalier kind of did that course.

539
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:56,800
Rym: I only saw two episodes, but Chevalier the first episode.

540
00:38:56,961 --> 00:39:00,760
Rym: I was so pumped about this show that had everything cool in the world in it.

541
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:04,111
Rym: And then the second episode was like a rock falling into a well.

542
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:05,175
Scott: No, that sucks.

543
00:39:05,897 --> 00:39:06,640
Scott: That sucks real bad.

544
00:39:07,422 --> 00:39:12,477
Scott: I didn't think it the Chevalier was that bad, but it definitely well, it's falling to a well.

545
00:39:12,497 --> 00:39:13,360
Rym: It didn't hit the bottom yet.

546
00:39:13,762 --> 00:39:15,651
Rym: Yeah for all I know it might recover.

547
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:17,380
Rym: It might just be one bad episode.

548
00:39:17,461 --> 00:39:20,744
Rym: They might have just made the second episode Accidentally crappy.

549
00:39:21,246 --> 00:39:22,411
Scott: that is possible.

550
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:23,857
Scott: I don't know.

551
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:26,727
Scott: anyway Project blue GQ.

552
00:39:26,927 --> 00:39:28,794
Scott: SOS is the awesome anime.

553
00:39:29,215 --> 00:39:30,600
Scott: You need to see it there.

554
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:41,019
Scott: you know, I noticed that pretty much like the science fiction anime tends to be the awesome and also the animes that are based on Novels as opposed to manga tend to be pretty strong also.

555
00:39:41,722 --> 00:39:45,980
Scott: Maybe that's just because novels in Japan are more serious and we like more serious anime.

556
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,980
Scott: You know in manga tends to be not always as serious.

557
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,494
Rym: Well, there's a lot of serious mom.

558
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:57,134
Scott: there is serious Mom doesn't get released in the US and it doesn't get turned into anime as often.

559
00:39:57,175 --> 00:40:01,928
Rym: God every time I go to Akino Kunia There's that wall of manga for me.

560
00:40:02,229 --> 00:40:06,179
Rym: It's nothing but Yakuza and politicians and more Yakuza.

561
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,314
Rym: Yep, and it's all in Japanese and no one translates it.

562
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:15,120
Rym: Yep No one makes anime and I would I'd love to just learn Japanese to read it all.

563
00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:20,459
Rym: But I flipped through a couple of them and there's more kanji than I could ever learn in the rest of my life.

564
00:40:22,786 --> 00:40:25,504
Rym: I'm having enough trouble with Basic grammar here.

565
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:26,206
Rym: Yeah.

566
00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:32,887
Scott: Well, here's an awesome awesome science fiction anime appeals to all ages Kicks ass.

567
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:41,175
Scott: there's a lot of fun a lot of colors High quality brand new and of course in closing take that Daryl Surratt.

568
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:42,740
Rym: Where were you reviewing this show?

569
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:50,953
Scott: The they probably either didn't know about it, which I doubt or They didn't see enough of it to talk about it, but they didn't even mention it at all.

570
00:40:51,013 --> 00:40:51,856
Scott: So what?

571
00:40:51,876 --> 00:40:53,670
Scott: maybe they haven't seen it Who knows?

572
00:40:53,691 --> 00:40:54,218
Rym: I don't know.

573
00:40:55,422 --> 00:40:57,153
Scott: We should have done this show a long time ago.

574
00:40:57,173 --> 00:41:00,376
Scott: We just I don't know why we It's like we saw it.

575
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,320
Scott: We mentioned it on the forums because it was so good and then we just never did an episode.

576
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:06,840
Rym: I guess I just assumed that we'd done an episode.

577
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:14,666
Scott: I also did but I just started our website for the word project and I don't see anything that includes this up this show.

578
00:41:14,746 --> 00:41:15,811
Rym: but think about what that says.

579
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:21,212
