1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,119
Scott: It's Tuesday January 30th.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,190
Scott: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:19,361
Scott: Tonight we review WarioWare smooth moves.

4
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,010
Rym: It's a wee Wario.

5
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:23,687
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,664
Rym: Well, I dutifully did my civic duty and reported to jury duty today.

7
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,149
Scott: Did you do any jury-ing?

8
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:32,275
Scott: Any nullifying?

9
00:00:32,637 --> 00:00:35,310
Rym: Well, you see it was not as painful as I expected.

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,322
Rym: I'll tell the whole story on Thursday.

11
00:00:37,362 --> 00:00:39,921
Rym: when we talk about jury duty Is that what we're talking about Thursday?

12
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:41,010
Scott: because they never had jury duty?

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,279
Scott: I don't know if it's a good for a whole show if I've never.

14
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:46,371
Rym: I've got quite a bit to say about how jury duty Went.

15
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:48,316
Rym: okay, and it's not over yet.

16
00:00:48,356 --> 00:00:53,490
Rym: You see the trials that came up were large long trials.

17
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:56,478
Scott: So you didn't get to go to the nice traffic court.

18
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:59,730
Scott: you had to go to the serious criminal bad thing court.

19
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:01,786
Rym: So what what ended up happening?

20
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:02,210
Rym: was you know?

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,724
Rym: They have a thing where hey if you this would be a hardship to you.

22
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:05,528
Rym: fill out this form.

23
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:10,310
Rym: Sign a statement swearing that it'll be a hardship, and we'll figure something out.

24
00:01:10,812 --> 00:01:14,545
Rym: So I told him what my job is and they said oh you can go home.

25
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:16,552
Scott: Yeah, all right What time was that?

26
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:17,254
Rym: well?

27
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:21,266
Rym: They might make me come back not tomorrow, but maybe Thursday for like.

28
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:22,490
Scott: are you gonna go to work tomorrow?

29
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,259
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna go to work tomorrow, and I will see but theoretically Just because of the line of work.

30
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:28,741
Rym: I'm in.

31
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:30,770
Rym: I can't be called up for jury duty.

32
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:38,248
Rym: No, that's good and apparently even if I don't have to go in the rest of the week I'm ineligible for jury duty for another six years from this point.

33
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:39,954
Scott: Oh six years is pretty good.

34
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:48,343
Rym: watch six years from now like immediately jury duty, and if I'm still an IT worker in Hospitals I probably just won't get to serve on a jury again.

35
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:50,553
Scott: Yeah, but if you're doing that in six years I don't know.

36
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:52,324
Scott: is that what you want to be doing in six years.

37
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:58,913
Scott: Hey if I'm the boss Alright, if you're the boss, that's cool, then yeah, I could deal with but if you still got your same job in six years It's no good.

38
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:02,190
Rym: I probably won't have my same job in a year and a half.

39
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:06,081
Scott: I might not have my same job in weeks.

40
00:02:06,362 --> 00:02:07,787
Rym: Yeah, aren't you interviewing with Google?

41
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:11,629
Rym: No Yeah, barely you're talking to a Google guy.

42
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:18,752
Scott: It's this one person from Google who seems that it seems like this is person at Google and their job is to go around the Internets.

43
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:23,510
Scott: all right finding people who might be able to work at Google who haven't applied to work at Google.

44
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:25,337
Scott: Aha so they look for like.

45
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:37,293
Scott: they'll go to forums and look for people giving tech advice or they'll go to the look at resumes just posted in places and They'll look at open source projects and things and they'll say hey Here's someone.

46
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:38,840
Scott: have they applied to work at Google?

47
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:39,563
Scott: they haven't.

48
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:41,090
Scott: we should talk to them, huh?

49
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,737
Scott: And apparently she said it's.

50
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,250
Scott: it was like the subject line of the first email.

51
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:46,680
Scott: They send out a form letter.

52
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,810
Scott: because I searched for the form letter And I found this same person sending the same form letter to everyone.

53
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:55,407
Scott: She just changes the line that says where she found out about you.

54
00:02:55,427 --> 00:03:01,090
Scott: yeah, and It was like Google is impressed with your resume, and it was my old resume.

55
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:02,236
Scott: So I sent the new one.

56
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:04,830
Rym: love Google's impressed with your old resume.

57
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:05,435
Rym: I know it's.

58
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:09,890
Scott: this is one person whose only job It is is to seek out people who haven't applied to Google.

59
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,236
Scott: I think you know.

60
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:13,365
Scott: of course they probably hire a few people this way.

61
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:14,570
Rym: no I can tell you what's going on.

62
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:15,996
Rym: I see what's going on here.

63
00:03:16,337 --> 00:03:19,230
Scott: Google is amassing its resume database.

64
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:26,569
Rym: Google is getting basically dossiers on every single tech worker in the United States and possibly the world.

65
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,530
Rym: and Then when they build Skynet, that's why they want a million.

66
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,425
Scott: That's why a million people apply to work at Google and only five thousand actually get hired.

67
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:39,709
Rym: when they build Skynet They know exactly who needs to be on their side or gone.

68
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:43,141
Scott: It could be that's all it is.

69
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:43,805
Rym: you know it.

70
00:03:44,026 --> 00:03:44,870
Scott: It's got something to do it.

71
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:54,050
Scott: But no she actually wants to talk to me on the phone and yeah, but yet I'm talking about other jobs, which are basically the same as my job only different places.

72
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:57,981
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty much gonna go into those like all.

73
00:03:58,122 --> 00:04:00,789
Scott: ass ish cuz I'll be like yeah, what are you gonna do for me?

74
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:01,834
Scott: That's right.

75
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,089
Scott: I already got a job.

76
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:05,036
Scott: Offer me some shit.

77
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:10,110
Rym: I imagine cuz usually when I apply to a job I never really say like I don't demand a salary right away.

78
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,629
Scott: I usually just say oh, I never say like a specific salary or anything.

79
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:15,196
Rym: well But I rarely.

80
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:18,552
Rym: the most I ever did was say you'd have to pay me at least X Mmm.

81
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:20,680
Rym: If I were in your position.

82
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:28,966
Rym: I would probably say something like I need XY and Z alright or and if you can't tell me that that is a possibility.

83
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:30,270
Rym: There's no point in us continuing.

84
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:32,959
Scott: Yeah, well you know I always wait for them to ask.

85
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:33,822
Scott: you know I like cuz.

86
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:36,797
Scott: I even like if I just go in and say That and then leave.

87
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:38,009
Scott: that's kind of a waste of my time.

88
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:43,430
Scott: I'd like to at least you know find out about companies and see what I would probably do is I'd ask ahead of time.

89
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:51,026
Rym: You know before I interview whoever whatever recruiter I talked to I just asked him can this company offer me at minimum the following otherwise.

90
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:52,190
Rym: We're wasting both of our time.

91
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:53,519
Scott: Well, it's not a recruiter.

92
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:54,989
Scott: I'm actually talking to someone at the company.

93
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,563
Scott: Yeah, I like to go and see what companies are doing.

94
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,809
Rym: recruiter at the company.

95
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:01,984
Scott: Yeah, I just like to go see what companies are like.

96
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:03,350
Scott: you know walk around offices.

97
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:03,652
Scott: Oh,

98
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:16,627
Rym: yeah, but what if you talk to him ahead of time, and they say yeah Regardless we're not prepared to pay more than $70,000 a year for our position at that point You know if that's the salary you weren't looking for there's no point in talking to the people at the company

99
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:18,417
Scott: unless I want to go See what their company's like.

100
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,390
Rym: why would you want to do that if you already know?

101
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:20,873
Rym: They're not gonna.

102
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:21,780
Rym: Give you the job you want.

103
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:23,110
Scott: all corporate espionage.

104
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:25,554
Rym: What are you gonna?

105
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:29,284
Rym: Do after having seen the inside of some PR HR guys office?

106
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:30,206
Scott: I like.

107
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,964
Scott: I like offices uh-huh.

108
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:40,890
Rym: So you don't like urban exploration or crawling around in subways yet you like going to generic offices.

109
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:43,717
Scott: I don't know.

110
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,925
Scott: I like that's like.

111
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,536
Scott: I like going to staples What you?

112
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:48,583
Scott: are you looking at me funny?

113
00:05:48,603 --> 00:05:48,623
Scott: I?

114
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:52,258
Rym: I don't get you sometimes weirdo.

115
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:53,221
Scott: You're weird.

116
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:58,880
Scott: anyway in the news We gotta talk about gaming for the rest of the show in the news.

117
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:00,546
Rym: There's news on the Wii now.

118
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:03,034
Scott: oh Right right right?

119
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:05,724
Scott: that the the news channel on the Wii.

120
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:09,490
Rym: yeah, it came out a day early Which I didn't notice or care.

121
00:06:09,691 --> 00:06:13,871
Scott: I didn't even know it was coming into like a second before it showed up, and then it was like oh there It is.

122
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:15,499
Rym: well the thing is right away.

123
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,503
Rym: You notice that one it.

124
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,749
Rym: You can't really customize it.

125
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:21,028
Scott: Yeah, it's not like the Weather Channel where you say all right?

126
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,190
Rym: Oh, you mean the useless Weather Channel that always tells you the weather at midnight.

127
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:30,567
Scott: I know the Weather Channel be more useful if it would update the weather more often, but it doesn't.

128
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:34,540
Rym: it's not that it updates Infrequently it's that no matter when you look at it.

129
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,810
Rym: It only ever gives you the temperature for midnight.

130
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:39,910
Scott: Yeah, if you're looking for current temperature the weather thing is no good.

131
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:44,210
Scott: It's only good for like the five-day forecast, but even then it's kind of a see.

132
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:46,120
Rym: I only want the Wii to tell me the weather.

133
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:46,462
Rym: now.

134
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,930
Rym: if I'm looking for the forecast I'll be going to no a gov anyway.

135
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:53,359
Scott: Yeah, definitely more accurate than the weather that the Wii gets.

136
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,488
Rym: but the Wii news channel is basically just the AP wire.

137
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:59,197
Scott: yep It's just the Associated Press.

138
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:09,810
Scott: pretty much almost every story from the Associated Press in the past X-period of time like day or so and You know the only really cool thing about is you can go around the globe looking at news stories.

139
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,319
Scott: So you know it's like I don't you?

140
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,950
Scott: when I read my Google Reader in my RSS feeds I'm usually not getting the normal news, so this Wii news makes it pretty easy to read normal news story.

141
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,395
Rym: What do you mean?

142
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:22,850
Rym: the normal news like the news?

143
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,590
Scott: That's on TV and in newspapers like why opposed to on slash down on dig see I read Google news.

144
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,192
Rym: So I know what.

145
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:33,770
Scott: I also read Google news, but you know sometimes it doesn't give you like what what doesn't it?

146
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,074
Rym: Give you it all.

147
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:45,589
Scott: well the other thing is my Google news is customized to only give me like three stories In the like national international news section and only three stories in the national news section.

148
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:47,269
Rym: well Why don't you just expand that?

149
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,541
Scott: Because then it it's kind of annoying.

150
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:52,550
Rym: instead you're gonna go to the Wii every day.

151
00:07:52,853 --> 00:07:57,728
Scott: Yeah, I don't go to the Wii every day But if you know from sitting at the Wii and I got nothing to do click on news channel see what's going on.

152
00:07:58,693 --> 00:08:00,081
Rym: Well, I guess part of the problem is I never.

153
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:01,630
Rym: it's not like I have idle time ever.

154
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,379
Rym: It's not like I'm sitting in a living room thinking.

155
00:08:03,761 --> 00:08:05,590
Rym: What could I do with my free hours?

156
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:06,755
Scott: Well, it's like you know.

157
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:08,970
Scott: sometimes you sit down you want to play a video game.

158
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,935
Scott: You're not sure which one.

159
00:08:10,176 --> 00:08:11,061
Scott: while you're thinking about it.

160
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:12,710
Scott: You can read a couple news stories.

161
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:15,190
Scott: It's actually pretty fun the way you read news on there.

162
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,343
Scott: It's actually like it's decent to read and browse the news on the screen.

163
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:21,008
Scott: It's it's a good interface thing.

164
00:08:21,148 --> 00:08:28,278
Rym: yeah, though I imagine if we get the Wiimote working exactly the way we want with the Mac It'll more and more eliminate the need to use the Wii for any of that.

165
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:32,789
Scott: yeah, yeah, oh well so check this out on.

166
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:40,523
Scott: I think next week or early in February the first week in February I'm pretty sure Diddy Kong raising DS is coming out all right.

167
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:47,690
Rym: I've never actually played a single Diddy Kong or game or a game that included any of those characters other than Donkey Kong.

168
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,764
Scott: Yeah, well Diddy Kong showed up in Donkey Kong Country remember.

169
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:52,150
Rym: I never played those games.

170
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:54,861
Scott: Donkey Kong Country was a good classic SNES game.

171
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:56,970
Rym: that was pretty much that in fact.

172
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,690
Rym: I remember specifically that game came out not too long after I had migrated almost entirely to PC gaming.

173
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:04,581
Scott: No, wow that was way long ago.

174
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:05,849
Rym: I was PC gaming.

175
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:10,350
Rym: wait I remember when I got Nintendo Power I still used to think that my PC was a better gaming platform.

176
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:20,993
Scott: anyway For the n64 there was a game called Diddy Kong racing, and you know it got played up You know bigger than anyone expected But it still wasn't.

177
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:23,302
Scott: you know it wasn't as big a smash as Mars at.

178
00:09:23,342 --> 00:09:25,570
Rym: that game was like the boat and the airplane.

179
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:35,630
Scott: It's actually when you look at it with you know you take away the fact that the characters are characters that no one knows about Because they're Diddy Kong characters as opposed to Mario characters.

180
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:39,766
Scott: It's actually a better racing game than Mario Kart 64 ever was.

181
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:40,890
Scott: you know I was always.

182
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:43,339
Scott: I was skeptical when I first played it for the n64.

183
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,110
Scott: you know I'm like Diddy Kong racing.

184
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:46,929
Scott: Give me a break.

185
00:09:47,372 --> 00:09:52,215
Scott: And then I played it and I'm like oh you can be a plane or a boat and a car and race them all against Each other.

186
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:53,690
Scott: that sounds ludicrous.

187
00:09:54,071 --> 00:10:01,150
Scott: It's a. it's actually really works so well because it's even and it's actually a racing game even though it has the items.

188
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:06,429
Scott: It's more of a racing game whereas Mario Kart is more of a random item crap game.

189
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,988
Rym: well No Mario Kart for the DS.

190
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:09,896
Rym: There's pretty much no randomness in it.

191
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,524
Scott: there is the most the least random.

192
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:14,290
Scott: Mario Kart is the Game Boy Advance one.

193
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:17,383
Scott: But Diddy Kong Racing is actually a really good racing game.

194
00:10:17,424 --> 00:10:24,547
Scott: the theme of it is just one No one knows about because no one cares about Diddy Kong, huh, but Diddy Kong Racing DS seems to be everything.

195
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:27,982
Scott: Diddy Kong Racing for the 64 was well.

196
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:29,570
Rym: I want more racing games for my DS.

197
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,599
Rym: I mean I like Mario Kart, but it's played out.

198
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,502
Rym: I beat it.

199
00:10:33,643 --> 00:10:34,365
Rym: I'm done with it.

200
00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:49,026
Scott: the Wi-Fi is dead Yep, but Diddy Kong Racing is gonna have one thing that Mario Kart DS Every racing game recently severely lacks and that is a custom track editor Uh-huh much better than the one in the original excite bike.

201
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:50,091
Rym: so wait Can I just?

202
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:56,090
Rym: I mean basically my dream editor would be I have a pallet a blank thing and I can just draw a track.

203
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:57,880
Scott: That's what you do got to.

204
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,510
Scott: just take the stylus and you draw.

205
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:06,084
Scott: You know let you draw the track the shape of it And then you race on it and there's a limit to how long the track can be.

206
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:07,128
Scott: and you know you can.

207
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:10,303
Scott: you might Accidentally draw an invalid track, and then it'll.

208
00:11:10,443 --> 00:11:10,865
Scott: then it won't.

209
00:11:10,926 --> 00:11:11,810
Scott: let you race it.

210
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,111
Scott: It's like.

211
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:13,297
Scott: no your track is invalid.

212
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:13,659
Scott: fix it.

213
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:25,459
Rym: kind of like the other day when I was at the supermarket Self-checking out and I signed my name And it sat there for a while hung and it turned out that it couldn't figure out my signature And it didn't think that it was a real signature.

214
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,343
Scott: wait, but haven't?

215
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:27,970
Scott: we filled it in before and it's worked.

216
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:29,576
Rym: It depends on where you go.

217
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:29,857
Rym: some.

218
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:37,500
Rym: they actually look at it and apparently according to the cashier It was annoying because it rejects about 90% of signatures.

219
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:39,170
Scott: really where was this?

220
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,417
Rym: Some grocery store in yawkers.

221
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:44,110
Scott: Oh, they must have a weird new thing at that grocery store.

222
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,759
Rym: Well, I think they tried to up security.

223
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,910
Rym: I think they enabled some sort of secure bit.

224
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:49,988
Scott: No, they should turn that secure bit off.

225
00:11:51,293 --> 00:12:06,419
Scott: Anyway, yeah, so here's a video of the track editor and Diddy Kong Racing DS so you can see if you think it's cool and You know if you're someone who was playing Mario Kart DS And maybe you're done with it, or you know it's gone out of style Diddy Kong Racing DS.

226
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,109
Scott: I guarantee you at all the conventions this year This is gonna get some mad wireless multiplayer action.

227
00:12:11,551 --> 00:12:12,073
Scott: It's better.

228
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:13,578
Scott: you might want to get yourself a cap.

229
00:12:13,618 --> 00:12:17,170
Rym: well considering a DS is being sold every 60 seconds in the u.s.

230
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:17,633
Rym: Currently.

231
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:26,858
Scott: yeah, yeah things of the day.

232
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:30,420
Rym: So we all love Mortal Kombat.

233
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:33,179
Scott: What well about you?

234
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,631
Scott: But I only really like Mortal Kombat 2.

235
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,405
Scott: Mortal Kombat 1 is sometimes fun But it's not very good.

236
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:43,591
Rym: Mortal Kombat 1 was a was a good game only From the perspective of a 13 year old boy.

237
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:53,660
Scott: Yeah, and Mortal Kombat with numbers greater than 2 or just painful I mean God, but it is a 3d Mortal Kombat.

238
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:54,605
Scott: No one played.

239
00:12:54,665 --> 00:13:01,580
Rym: you remember when Mortal Kombat 3 the arcade game came out Which is pretty much right at the like the ass end of the arcade era?

240
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:04,028
Scott: Yeah, I mean Mortal Kombat 2.

241
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:07,339
Scott: You know well even Mortal Kombat 1 had what they call.

242
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,067
Scott: is the That the palette swaps or whatever?

243
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:12,852
Scott: yeah, it's the same character.

244
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:13,814
Scott: Just a different color.

245
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:15,017
Rym: Oh scorpion.

246
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:20,035
Scott: ah Smart score yeah, and Mortal Kombat 2 took it a little bit further.

247
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:25,395
Scott: They had sub-zero Yeah, but Mortal Kombat 3 you think they would have learned their lesson.

248
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:31,560
Scott: No they went even crazier And there are just all these characters that were the same exact thing with a different color.

249
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,254
Rym: So what a rainbow coalition of scorpions, so they were different.

250
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,880
Scott: They had these spiky predator masks.

251
00:13:37,103 --> 00:13:47,660
Rym: I don't know who they were But really I do remember that When I went to my old arcade tilt when I was a kid Mortal Kombat 3 was the hot hot hot game And there'd be this crazy crowd of people around it.

252
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:51,894
Rym: You could never play because it was that that was like the hot game and people.

253
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:55,850
Scott: where I was Mortal Kombat 3 was never The hot game was Mortal Kombat 2 was the hot game.

254
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:01,840
Scott: people would line up and one guy who knew to do how to do Some combos would stand there for a long time playing for free and everyone else's money.

255
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:10,899
Rym: well the arcade always had like the newest newest game to come out and A million super super old games that were actually also for sale.

256
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:24,440
Scott: Yeah, before arcades died you know when like Super Street Fighter 2 turbo was a new game and when Mortal Kombat 2 was a new Game the arcade was hopping really hopping like crazily the one in the mall.

257
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,155
Scott: They always had the greatest new games.

258
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:26,700
Scott: It was crazy.

259
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:28,126
Rym: Hey, at least we got Wildwood.

260
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:32,663
Rym: the arcades there on the boardwalk are more hopping than any other arcades I've ever been to.

261
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,196
Scott: Dave and Busters is and Jillian's and places are kind of hop.

262
00:14:36,236 --> 00:14:37,180
Rym: Jillian's aren't happen.

263
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:38,189
Scott: No, it depends.

264
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,340
Rym: Jillian's are lame.

265
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,100
Scott: It depends on which one you go to but if you go there at the right times that there are people there.

266
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:45,351
Rym: Yeah, yeah, not like the boardwalk.

267
00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:47,200
Scott: No, it's a different crowd.

268
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:54,341
Rym: But anyway, we also love Street Fighter 2 and Street fall the Street fighters except Street Fighter 1.

269
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:59,200
Scott: Yes, Street Fighter 1 is good for looking back on but you don't want to play that game.

270
00:14:59,281 --> 00:14:59,905
Scott: There's nothing to it.

271
00:14:59,925 --> 00:15:05,360
Rym: You realize when Street Fighter 2 came out I'd never heard of or even known that a Street Fighter 1 it exists.

272
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,194
Scott: I knew that one must have existed, but I never played it.

273
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:09,420
Scott: No, and I played it once.

274
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:12,052
Rym: I thought it was like Goonies - where there was?

275
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:20,820
Rym: there wasn't really a Goonies one I mean there was in the arcade and there might have been one for the NES But no one had ever played it Goonies - came out and that was the first Goonies game as far as anyone knew.

276
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:21,704
Scott: Yeah, I went.

277
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:25,100
Scott: I actually played Street Fighter 1 once in an arcade.

278
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:35,156
Scott: It was the version where there's just one button, you know and you depending on how hard you push the button It's either light or hard kicking and punching and it's not fun.

279
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:36,180
Scott: It's a bad game.

280
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:42,260
Rym: Well, uh, what if you were to combine these two and say have scorpion fight ryu?

281
00:15:42,802 --> 00:15:48,723
Scott: Well, everyone's always wanted that but you know because those are the only two fighting game franchises We can't combine.

282
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,970
Scott: all we have is Capcom vs.

283
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:52,596
Scott: SNK and Marvel vs.

284
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:53,880
Scott: Capcom and stuff like that.

285
00:15:54,261 --> 00:16:00,423
Rym: Well, not only did someone make a video that does it very well, but they made this video Cinematic quality.

286
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:03,332
Rym: this is an epic knockdown.

287
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:12,560
Rym: drag them out right out of they live Fight to the bitter end between ryu and scorpion and I got to say it's actually pretty cool and I'd recommend you watch it.

288
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:28,726
Rym: I'm not gonna ruin who wins But it plays out like any fighting scene in any movie you've ever seen where one guy's getting the crap kicked out of him but then the tide turns and the other guys getting the crack kicked out of him and then it comes down to the bitter wire and They both have and they know how to start

289
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:34,245
Scott: off using the wussy punches and then by the end it is using all special moves And fireball fireball fireball.

290
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:38,660
Rym: There's this one part where ryu throws like hadoken at an angle from the wall.

291
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,697
Rym: He's in the air then he drops down and throws another one in slow motion and it's really cool.

292
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:44,580
Scott: Yeah, it's good stuff.

293
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:47,000
Scott: You can actually do that in some of the newer street fighters.

294
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:50,832
Rym: Yeah See even they don't ask me how he was doing stuff that I'd never seen.

295
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:51,373
Rym: ryu do?

296
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:54,990
Rym: I know how to do a spinny Kick and an uppercut and a hadoken.

297
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:02,114
Scott: That's those are his basic three moves anyway, so You play board games and doesn't it kind of suck?

298
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:03,340
Scott: good board games take too long.

299
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:07,558
Rym: That is the primary reason I don't go to Mars on a regular basis.

300
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:13,116
Scott: Yeah Well, what if you played a board game for five hours, so that suck I'd kill myself.

301
00:17:13,396 --> 00:17:14,420
Scott: What if it was ten hours?

302
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:15,922
Rym: I'm already dead.

303
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,205
Rym: So I guess I'd rot some.

304
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:24,108
Scott: what if it was 42 hours and 48 minutes such a thing could never be Well to win.

305
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:33,560
Scott: I guess winning it's not really a prize But to qualify for entry into the Guinness Book of World Records for longest board game ever played a longest board game marathon.

306
00:17:34,523 --> 00:17:40,456
Scott: these German guys There are four of them they played Carcassonne for 42 hours and 48 minutes.

307
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:48,548
Scott: I don't know what expansions they had or what combination of expansions they had But they definitely had that.

308
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,250
Scott: there's no way.

309
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:54,770
Scott: when you look at the pictures of how big this board is at the end There's no way that they could have done.

310
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,894
Scott: It was just one set.

311
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:57,380
Scott: They definitely had multiple sets.

312
00:17:57,683 --> 00:18:02,474
Scott: There's no other explanation for it but I don't know how many meeples they had each like.

313
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,578
Scott: did they modify that?

314
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:12,546
Scott: because Eventually, you're just gonna lay them all out as farmers or you just have to farm basically never because you know that eventually there's gonna Be a bigger farm somewhere.

315
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:15,880
Scott: So you just wait for it and eventually you'll put a guy in it.

316
00:18:16,003 --> 00:18:23,466
Scott: See now it's not worth it for anyone to put two guys into it because they can always put two guys into two other farms that no One else can compete with.

317
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:31,638
Rym: you know what I would have done if I was there in this game Mm-hmm every tile I got I would have put on one side of the board in a long chain just to fuck it.

318
00:18:31,658 --> 00:18:33,586
Scott: Oh That's if you can.

319
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:36,699
Scott: you might have to do like two separate chains just so that you'll always be.

320
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:43,219
Rym: Oh, yeah But I would just pick one side and whenever possible build as far as I can toward one player who was annoying me.

321
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:47,334
Rym: I've done that before in other games at Carcassonne.

322
00:18:47,374 --> 00:18:51,256
Rym: if I'm winning or something I'll just start building towards Scott just to make him shift back a little.

323
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:53,288
Scott: yeah Yeah, it's a good move.

324
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:55,580
Scott: But no they made a giant Carcassonne board.

325
00:18:55,681 --> 00:19:01,671
Rym: They played Carcassonne for 42 hours and 48 minutes, you know Normally if someone doesn't take their turn we get a little lacrosse.

326
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:10,055
Rym: if I was playing that Lay let level of board game and someone didn't make their turn in I don't know three seconds.

327
00:19:10,597 --> 00:19:11,780
Rym: I'd probably just kill him.

328
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:16,360
Scott: Yeah, I would really want to know what the requirements were for this to qualify as the Guinness.

329
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,434
Scott: I mean, what if I took one turn and then Rym took an hour on his turn?

330
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:21,217
Scott: Yeah, we could.

331
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:22,140
Scott: does that count?

332
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:23,465
Scott: I mean, we're still playing.

333
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:25,876
Scott: just Rym, you know didn't take his turn.

334
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:26,740
Rym: Yeah, we're playing chess.

335
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,760
Scott: We've been playing chess for the last 10 years and Carcassonne is a game that can theoretically go on forever.

336
00:19:31,902 --> 00:19:40,500
Scott: I mean, you know Did they just figure out like how many tiles per minute and then start with that many tiles in order to make the record time?

337
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:43,814
Scott: Or did they just keep adding tiles to the game when they really?

338
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:44,999
Rym: you know, I don't know.

339
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,144
Rym: Well, it's your thing of the day.

340
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:50,120
Scott: So the onus is it doesn't say anything and I can't find any information.

341
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:51,932
Scott: And if there is information, it's in German.

342
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:53,100
Scott: So it's not helping me out.

343
00:19:53,321 --> 00:19:57,620
Rym: Oh, well, at least we just played a normal sane game of Carcassonne.

344
00:19:58,703 --> 00:20:01,572
Scott: I thought I was gonna win but you built two giant castles.

345
00:20:01,873 --> 00:20:05,003
Scott: one of them had the cloister not the cloister the Cathedral.

346
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,388
Rym: Yeah the suicide bit.

347
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,215
Rym: Yeah, see I will.

348
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:17,192
Rym: I always win Carcassonne Yeah, but usually I do with farming but this time because we're playing with three people and it's not like playing with a bunch Of our other friends who wall.

349
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:18,000
Rym: I mean, they're smart people.

350
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,818
Rym: They just don't play board games as much as we do.

351
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:25,456
Rym: I was playing against Scott and Alex who are pretty much the people who if anyone's gonna beat me at this game It's one of them.

352
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:33,761
Scott: I wondered see I think The only reason I lost is because you jumped into my farm at the last second when I had no time to possibly defend it Further.

353
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:34,805
Rym: that was my plan.

354
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:40,666
Rym: I know I realized that later you put that big farmer in and I thought wow That's the only farm in the game.

355
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:41,671
Rym: That's worth a goddamn.

356
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:43,540
Rym: I'll just jump in at the end in time.

357
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,960
Rym: See actually that's what I did to the whole game.

358
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:59,140
Rym: I also tied Scott on a big city and I tied Alex on a big city and I just king made back and forth back And forth taking points for me points for them one for you one for me And then in the end I'd done that more times than anyone else.

359
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,320
Scott: Yeah, I had thought about putting another farmer in that farm for a while.

360
00:21:03,621 --> 00:21:04,365
Scott: I should have done it.

361
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:05,793
Scott: if I had I probably would have won.

362
00:21:05,894 --> 00:21:08,645
Scott: but oh well Carcassonne crazy try.

363
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:14,100
Scott: if you want to see the biggest set of tiles you ever seen good guy out It's pretty crazy.

364
00:21:14,563 --> 00:21:28,387
Rym: But I know you've all been waiting for us to talk about not a board game but a video game because we know that Wario where smooth moves is out and everyone has had a chance to play it at least everyone cool and In a word underwhelmed.

365
00:21:28,868 --> 00:21:34,634
Scott: Well, I think it's uh, it's definitely better than Most of the other Wario games.

366
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:35,238
Rym: I don't know.

367
00:21:35,318 --> 00:21:40,840
Rym: I think On a raw scale the game cube Wario where is the best Wario where ever made?

368
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:50,560
Scott: Well the thing you got to understand right this what this for Wario games that Wario where game Wario where touched Twisted the Wii one right there the game cube Wario.

369
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,365
Scott: Where is sort of this odd game?

370
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:56,336
Scott: and that it's the same exact game as the original Wario?

371
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,780
Scott: where for the Gameboy Advance?

372
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,956
Scott: It's the exact same game.

373
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:02,714
Scott: Only they added a little bit of multiplayer a little bit.

374
00:22:02,734 --> 00:22:04,380
Rym: They actually added quite a bit of multiplayer.

375
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,820
Scott: They added let's see what there's like nine ten little multiplayer games on there something like that.

376
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,840
Scott: Yeah, all right, and they added a bunch of little multiplayer games and they ported it over to the game cube instead of the Gameboy Advance.

377
00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:22,960
Rym: Yes Thus transforming Wario where from in my opinion a worthless game into one of the greatest party?

378
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,899
Rym: multiplayer games ever made.

379
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:27,389
Scott: Well, you know the thing about the original Wario.

380
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,280
Scott: where is it's meant to be sort of like a crack you can play.

381
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,184
Scott: No, it's not crap.

382
00:22:31,345 --> 00:22:34,600
Rym: I'm gonna come out and say it that game is worthless.

383
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:40,720
Scott: I think it's only worthless to you because the situation in which that game is played does not exist for you.

384
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:44,031
Rym: Oh, you mean you have time to kill and you're bored.

385
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,420
Rym: So you just want to play a mindless nothing game.

386
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:48,489
Scott: It's like hey, I got five minutes to do nothing.

387
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:50,397
Scott: I'll play a little bit of Wario where it's quick.

388
00:22:50,617 --> 00:22:53,108
Scott: It's fun You know, it's not too hard.

389
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:55,017
Scott: You can turn it on turn it off without caring.

390
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:55,398
Scott: There's.

391
00:22:55,438 --> 00:22:58,735
Scott: no you know It's not a game You got to play for a long time or think a lot about you.

392
00:22:58,775 --> 00:22:59,479
Scott: just you know.

393
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:01,399
Scott: Move your hands around and think a little bit.

394
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:04,640
Rym: Yeah, but even if that is I mean people are free to like that sort of thing.

395
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,787
Rym: But that doesn't really.

396
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:10,252
Rym: it doesn't make it a good game overall It just makes it a game that fills a very specific niche.

397
00:23:10,493 --> 00:23:10,614
Scott: Yeah.

398
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:15,035
Scott: Well, it is fun You know to especially if when there's ever there's new games in it.

399
00:23:15,156 --> 00:23:16,020
Scott: That's what makes it fun.

400
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:23,313
Scott: It's like, you know, if it's a new Wario where it's fun If it's the same old games mini games or micro games that everyone to call them.

401
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:29,132
Scott: if you've played the micro games before Like okay, I've threaded the needle ten times in my life.

402
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:31,300
Scott: It's not fun to thread the needle anymore, you know.

403
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,692
Scott: So Wario where games tend to get played out very quickly.

404
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:36,780
Rym: see but that's the beauty of the GameCube one.

405
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:48,920
Rym: It never got played out because no matter what if you sit down Adding multiplayer to something so simple and adding it as elegantly as they did makes it just basically an infinitely replayable party game.

406
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:49,522
Rym: Mm-hmm.

407
00:23:49,822 --> 00:23:51,528
Rym: I mean the intensity of our Wario.

408
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:54,396
Rym: our matches rivals even our Mario parties.

409
00:23:55,038 --> 00:24:01,320
Scott: I must agree Yeah, I'm not arguing against you on this that you know, of course Wario where multiplayer is the shit-off.

410
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:04,109
Scott: And you know, all I want is what.

411
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:12,880
Scott: there's tons and tons of Wario where multiplayer for the ultimate hotness But there is merit to the single-player Wario where even if it has no place in the life of Rym.

412
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:21,640
Rym: Yeah I guess my problem is that The GameCube Wario where was an amazing game and in a way in many ways it changed the way we play games as a group.

413
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:26,640
Rym: Are the front row crew Wario where it became this party game that just got whipped out constantly.

414
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:30,692
Scott: Yeah, I think the real advantage it has over something like Mario Party.

415
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:50,580
Scott: right Mario Party was a great party game except All you really wanted to do was play minigames with people, you know you wanted to play your dungeon duos and your dominations and your Can cans and everything but there was such this long Periods of not doing anything and watching animations between those minigames that it's sort and it took an hour.

416
00:24:50,720 --> 00:25:07,092
Scott: It's like oh god Wario where you've got the same multiplayer minigame action But it takes like five minutes and it's really fast paced and you play a lot of minigames and you get all the fun Of a whole Mario Party and that takes an hour squished into like five minutes.

417
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:08,255
Scott: and that's either.

418
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:10,261
Scott: the multiplayer is freaking awesome Yep.

419
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:11,426
Rym: Well, there's different philosophies.

420
00:25:11,446 --> 00:25:19,937
Rym: I mean what Mario Party is definitely a. we're gonna sit down Socialize yell have fun and interact for an hour around Mario Party.

421
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:20,700
Rym: Wario.

422
00:25:21,423 --> 00:25:23,832
Rym: We're playing WarioWare with each other.

423
00:25:23,852 --> 00:25:24,575
Rym: Mm-hmm.

424
00:25:25,138 --> 00:25:25,640
Scott: That's for sure.

425
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:30,533
Scott: Anyway, but yeah WarioWare smooth moves is the latest installment, you know, we had.

426
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:32,880
Scott: we already talked about what the other Wario was.

427
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:42,860
Rym: Yeah, now basically if you played WarioWare touch for the DS, this is the exact same game Only it uses the wiimote instead of using the stylus.

428
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:53,048
Rym: I mean the minigames are different obviously But in terms of the way you unlock things the kinds of things you can unlock the kinds of modes you can play in The games are 90% identical.

429
00:25:53,288 --> 00:25:53,569
Scott: Of course.

430
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:56,640
Scott: It has, you know a different set of games, but that's about it.

431
00:25:56,941 --> 00:25:58,712
Rym: Yeah, I mean the characters are mostly the same.

432
00:25:58,752 --> 00:26:00,000
Rym: They added a couple characters.

433
00:26:00,462 --> 00:26:03,458
Rym: They took some characters from touch that weren't in the other Wario's.

434
00:26:03,821 --> 00:26:06,680
Scott: Yep, some characters that you've seen before aren't around anymore.

435
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:10,474
Rym: But it's basically the game of play a small subset of these micro games.

436
00:26:10,755 --> 00:26:19,380
Rym: if you beat enough of them it unlocks Another subset of the micro games and eventually you'll unlock all of them along with a bunch of chinchy chinchy Extras that really don't take you anywhere.

437
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:24,614
Scott: Yeah, and it's like, you know, the single-player would be a lot cooler if there was.

438
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:25,817
Scott: you could beat it in.

439
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:34,579
Scott: you know If it took more than a day to beat it I mean I literally sat down started playing and the only reason I didn't beat it in one day is because I just didn't want to.

440
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:41,183
Scott: It would have taken me literally like I played it for the first day and I just beat it beat it beat it beat it Beat it beat it beat it.

441
00:26:41,203 --> 00:26:42,489
Rym: Hell we got the game.

442
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:43,334
Rym: We put it in.

443
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:44,520
Rym: I end up playing a little bit.

444
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:47,017
Rym: I beat half the game in like 20 minutes.

445
00:26:47,602 --> 00:27:13,700
Scott: Yeah, now there are you know Even if you beat the game in quotes and unlock everything in the whole single-player mode and then unlock everything in the multiplayer mode There is still some micro games that you are still not available and you have to play the single-player, you know It's the correct modes on the single-player enough to get those mini micro games to appear so that kind of Makes you play the single-player enough so you can get all the games to show up now.

446
00:27:13,961 --> 00:27:19,500
Rym: Well, I'll put aside the multiplayer for a bit and look at just the actual gameplay because there are two really important things about Wario.

447
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:33,297
Rym: Where one is that, you know You can play it with the Wiimote and this is really the first game to show off in full glory how the Wiimote works because Wario where smooth moves is Excellent from a gameplay perspective.

448
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:47,220
Scott: Yeah I mean if you think about the way monkey ball minigames use the Wiimote, which is based which is not at all 180 degrees The Wiimote actually works in Wario where Wario where is as good as monkey ball is bad.

449
00:27:47,621 --> 00:27:52,260
Scott: Yeah, I mean what basically what happens is the game teaches you these stances, right?

450
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,222
Scott: And the first one is the remote control and the guy, you know It's pretty cool.

451
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,406
Scott: when they introduce a new stance.

452
00:27:57,446 --> 00:28:04,832
Rym: a guy always comes out and says something like like a cool breeze on a summer's Night, so too will you understand the blah blah blah.

453
00:28:05,073 --> 00:28:05,273
Scott: Yep.

454
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:07,080
Scott: Yep, and he teaches you a new stance.

455
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,267
Scott: So the remote control stance.

456
00:28:08,307 --> 00:28:10,159
Scott: you hold the Wiimote like a remote control.

457
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:11,865
Scott: and If when is it?

458
00:28:11,925 --> 00:28:14,520
Scott: when you're about to play a micro game any micro game?

459
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,171
Scott: The game tells you which stance you should be in.

460
00:28:17,372 --> 00:28:23,979
Scott: so it might say okay for this game Get ready hold it like a remote control and you hold it like a remote control and then the game starts.

461
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:29,435
Scott: now Just cuz you're holding it like a remote control doesn't mean you're gonna be moving it the same way.

462
00:28:29,495 --> 00:28:36,700
Scott: some remote control games require pointing Some require moving it left and right up and down pushing a button not pushing the button, you know.

463
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:38,420
Scott: So it could often be deceiving.

464
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:45,209
Scott: You know, you're holding it like a remote control you expect to move it in a certain way and then nope You actually had to move it in a different way.

465
00:28:45,229 --> 00:28:47,300
Rym: Yeah that tripped me up on a couple of minigames.

466
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:53,820
Scott: yeah, there was the what the flip one where it gives you like a Pancake on a spatula and I keep trying to flip it up in the air.

467
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,420
Scott: But no you're supposed to rotate and just flip it down onto the pan and I go.

468
00:28:58,701 --> 00:29:00,226
Scott: I messed it up so many times.

469
00:29:00,487 --> 00:29:02,493
Scott: I just flipped the pancake onto the wall now.

470
00:29:02,554 --> 00:29:04,460
Rym: There are a lot of forms.

471
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:07,715
Rym: I can't tell you how many there were offhand, but I mean there's the mohawk.

472
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:14,823
Rym: you hold it over your head My favorites pie the big cheese where you hold it at your hip and you stand there laughing like a CEO I don't know.

473
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:19,200
Scott: I really kind of like the the sketch artist one and the thumb wrestler one.

474
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:22,449
Rym: Ah the thumb wrestler not used very often but used to great effect.

475
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:26,420
Scott: Yeah the oh, I also like the the driving one the courier.

476
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,974
Rym: Yeah, actually there's one of the boss stages.

477
00:29:29,994 --> 00:29:35,252
Rym: cuz you know all these warrior war games They have boss stages, which are if the games are micro games.

478
00:29:35,312 --> 00:29:37,520
Rym: The boss stages are essentially minigames.

479
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:41,874
Scott: Yep, and well, they're really just micro games that last more than five seconds.

480
00:29:41,894 --> 00:29:43,520
Scott: They last maybe 30 seconds.

481
00:29:44,661 --> 00:29:54,800
Rym: But there's one where you just drive a car through the woods and the way you control the car Gave me such a hard-on for a Wii racing game other than excite truck like a straight-up.

482
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:59,896
Scott: Actually that boss stage controls the driving better than excite truck does.

483
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:01,280
Scott: it's pretty crazy.

484
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:12,513
Scott: It's really great like you're just driving casually through the woods on a normal road in a normal car and The Wiimote makes an amazing steering wheel that's like perfect in every way.

485
00:30:12,714 --> 00:30:18,336
Scott: and this little Wario boss game Oh, the other great boss stage is the Star Fox one.

486
00:30:18,618 --> 00:30:25,340
Rym: Yeah Oh, I want a Star Fox game and not some sort of weird adventure around and collect the doodads star.

487
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,060
Scott: Well, there was a GameCube one and a DS one whatever.

488
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:31,049
Rym: Those are all using a Wiimote to control.

489
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,940
Rym: any sort of free space shooter is going to usher in a new era.

490
00:30:35,123 --> 00:30:35,979
Rym: I look forward.

491
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:42,060
Rym: My speculation here is that you know, they're talking about a Star Wars game lightsaber control.

492
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:44,447
Scott: Well, there's gonna be rogue squadron ring.

493
00:30:44,768 --> 00:30:45,209
Scott: No doubt.

494
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,897
Rym: Yeah any kind of free pay free space shooter?

495
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:50,860
Scott: Oh Rogue squadron isn't really a free space.

496
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:54,655
Rym: That's why I said specifically free space shooter and I just kind of ignored my.

497
00:30:54,696 --> 00:30:55,760
Scott: I might get rogue squadron.

498
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:58,129
Rym: Anyway, who knows Scott Johnson will get it.

499
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,832
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

500
00:30:58,852 --> 00:30:59,193
Scott: That's true.

501
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:00,940
Rym: We'll just have to wait until it's 20 bucks.

502
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,823
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

503
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,006
Scott: That's about worth 20 bucks.

504
00:31:03,046 --> 00:31:07,379
Scott: It's not definitely not worth 50 unless there's a super a supreme drought of games.

505
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:15,166
Rym: Anyway, but they the L I mean when they first announced WarioWare for the Wii which we knew was gonna come and you couldn't not Make a war.

506
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,649
Rym: I knew we were gonna buy it But I wondered how are they gonna handle the Wiimote?

507
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:24,129
Rym: because you could deal with in any sort of way and I think this form Idea and also the way they prevent presented.

508
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:24,530
Scott: Yeah.

509
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:28,544
Scott: Imagine if the mini gate the micro games are just like, okay Thread the needle.

510
00:31:28,826 --> 00:31:29,589
Scott: Well, what do you do?

511
00:31:29,629 --> 00:31:31,900
Scott: Do I told the wiimote like this and move it to the left?

512
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,855
Scott: Do I you know hold the wiimote like this and move it that way?

513
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:35,760
Scott: it would be impossible.

514
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:46,920
Rym: But also they iconify all of them into very easy to reference very quick pictures that not only are a picture of you Holding it correctly, but the name will remind you anyway.

515
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:54,563
Rym: So they kind of flash it like do the mohawk and then the minigame starts and the timing is just Absolutely.

516
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:54,884
Rym: Perfect.

517
00:31:54,904 --> 00:31:59,300
Rym: You have exactly enough time to put the wiimote in whatever configuration and go unless you're playing.

518
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,023
Scott: What's the mode?

519
00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:04,100
Scott: the thrilling mode where it doesn't tell you the stance and you have to figure out you to remember the stance?

520
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,554
Scott: Because you already did the game before.

521
00:32:05,574 --> 00:32:09,140
Rym: yeah Now I'll actually note that after having played most of the game.

522
00:32:09,522 --> 00:32:11,880
Rym: That mode is no different than any other mode.

523
00:32:11,944 --> 00:32:15,887
Scott: Yeah If you've played enough of the WarioWare, you know Stances for most of the games.

524
00:32:16,188 --> 00:32:22,278
Scott: the only time it'll trick you is if it's a game you haven't played before and I don't think that mode gives you games you haven't played before.

525
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:26,637
Rym: well It does me because you unlocked some games that I hadn't seen while I wasn't home.

526
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:32,019
Rym: Oh I went to play it and this guy appears on a pole rope and I don't know what's going on.

527
00:32:32,644 --> 00:32:33,570
Scott: And yeah, that's a good one.

528
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:34,356
Rym: Yeah, it is a good one.

529
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:37,540
Rym: Anyway Well, yeah, the control is absolutely superb.

530
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:43,078
Rym: The minigames aren't actually as crazy as the games from WarioWare and the GameCube.

531
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:43,680
Rym: That is true.

532
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:51,260
Scott: Is that the in the other WarioWare games maybe not so much touched but the twisted and the original WarioWare?

533
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:57,440
Scott: The themes of the micro games are sort of way out there and wacky certainly in a chromatic kind of way.

534
00:32:57,722 --> 00:33:04,616
Rym: I mean, there's the anime girl with a Booger coming out of her nose that comes down and snatches your little dude off the ground.

535
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,077
Rym: Yeah.

536
00:33:05,097 --> 00:33:20,583
Scott: Oh, yeah that one Wow, or probably the most or there was like, you know, the human looking Koopa and Mario that fight, you know It all sort of had this kind of air of you know kind of weird Japanese Grungy styling.

537
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:25,360
Rym: Yeah, also perhaps the most disturbing game which I would basically call it the rape metaphor.

538
00:33:26,022 --> 00:33:26,724
Scott: Which game was that?

539
00:33:26,844 --> 00:33:36,881
Rym: where it shows a nose in the middle of the screen and there's four players with fingers pointed at it And then text appears and the text is a single word that says Inserts.

540
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:42,260
Rym: Oh, yeah that one and then it spins around while you try to shove your finger into the nose before someone else.

541
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:44,999
Scott: Yeah, or the capitalism game?

542
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,247
Rym: Capitalism must crush capital.

543
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:54,219
Scott: Yeah, the games in this WarioWare tend to have a lot more broad appeal in their theme.

544
00:33:54,681 --> 00:34:08,699
Rym: However, it's like everyone can kind of relate to the games and the style the visual style of the games more easily Because this was a WarioWare that was made for the Wii as opposed to taking Gameboy games and putting them in a container on a GameCube.

545
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:16,620
Rym: The games are extremely beautiful or extremely ugly on purpose, but the animations and everything in the game is absolutely phenomenal.

546
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:26,975
Scott: Yeah, everything actually looks really shite, you know bright shiny not so nice colors You know, it's as quality is like a cartoon you would watch on TV.

547
00:34:27,176 --> 00:34:27,337
Rym: Yep.

548
00:34:27,397 --> 00:34:28,300
Rym: The music's really good.

549
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:30,286
Scott: Oh, the music is so awesome.

550
00:34:30,327 --> 00:34:34,120
Scott: Like when I'm standing there in between minigames, I cannot help but dance.

551
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,940
Scott: It is actually impossible to not dance no matter what level you're doing.

552
00:34:38,261 --> 00:34:42,272
Scott: There's always you know, the little music between the minigames and you just dance.

553
00:34:42,532 --> 00:34:47,690
Rym: Oh hell the opening song after it's a Wii Oh Wario is just fantastic.

554
00:34:47,731 --> 00:35:01,795
Rym: I could disco dance to that all night long You know and I'm playing the disco stage with Jimmy T or Jimmy P. Yeah, I just danced the whole time I can't stop and actually When Jimmy has his cats and they do the thriller dance with him.

555
00:35:01,895 --> 00:35:04,388
Scott: I know it's not the thriller dance But well, it's a dance.

556
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:06,020
Rym: It alludes to the thriller dance.

557
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:06,708
Rym: It does.

558
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:10,151
Rym: Yeah, I guess it's more like funky cat.

559
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:10,532
Rym: Maybe

560
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:26,320
Scott: all of the you know Cuz whenever you're about to play a new stage in the single-player There's the pre stage video in a little FMV that tells the plot And in quotes and then there's a little video after you beat the stage that shows you the resolution of that plot.

561
00:35:26,683 --> 00:35:28,618
Scott: Yeah, they're all really good.

562
00:35:29,381 --> 00:35:31,168
Scott: Usually they're kind of a or they don't?

563
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:33,799
Scott: you know, I think of the original warrior where they didn't even really exist.

564
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:37,094
Scott: But now they're all there and they're all kind of awesome.

565
00:35:37,395 --> 00:35:38,480
Scott: You know, you want to see what happens?

566
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,004
Rym: My favorite one is still Ashley.

567
00:35:40,024 --> 00:35:43,936
Scott: Yeah, I think Jimmy P is always gonna be the best seconded by Mo.

568
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,120
Rym: No, Ashley is great.

569
00:35:45,201 --> 00:35:46,960
Rym: Just I mean, it's a run-of-the-mill whatever.

570
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:53,569
Rym: But at the very end when she succeeds and doing the thing and then it cuts to her face And then she does that tiny little smirk.

571
00:35:54,273 --> 00:35:54,514
Scott: Yeah.

572
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:55,378
Scott: Yeah, that was great.

573
00:35:55,438 --> 00:35:55,760
Scott: It's good.

574
00:35:55,981 --> 00:36:00,200
Rym: It's good, even though they didn't have her funny song from the DS game.

575
00:36:00,401 --> 00:36:03,986
Scott: No, the DS game actually has a funny song and in the Wii game She doesn't.

576
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:11,200
Rym: but yeah If we're talking about the single-player just why are you aware as a single-player game or even as a single-player?

577
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,642
Rym: Pass the controller around.

578
00:36:12,683 --> 00:36:13,846
Rym: who can get the high score?

579
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:14,888
Rym: who can unlock things?

580
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:16,854
Rym: game a plus.

581
00:36:17,495 --> 00:36:19,220
Rym: Yes, wonderfully executed.

582
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:21,791
Rym: There is not a single minigame micro game.

583
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:22,594
Rym: That doesn't work.

584
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:23,940
Rym: They all function.

585
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,660
Scott: Well, one of them I thought didn't work, but if you ever think it doesn't work It's actually because you don't know how to hell to do it.

586
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:34,560
Rym: Yeah Luckily they have the temple of form where you can go in and play any one minigame on all three.

587
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:39,345
Scott: Yeah So like if you're playing and a new minigame comes up a micro game and you can't beat it You just go.

588
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:40,299
Scott: what the hell am I supposed to do?

589
00:36:40,623 --> 00:36:47,820
Scott: You can go to the temple of form Select it and just keep playing it over and over again until you figure out how it works playing and that's pretty cool.

590
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:54,567
Scott: It's also pretty cool because if there's a game that you like and it only showed up once and it never gets to show Up, you can go and play it on purpose.

591
00:36:54,768 --> 00:36:55,009
Rym: Yep.

592
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:57,680
Scott: I can also see how many games you have yet to unlock.

593
00:36:58,661 --> 00:37:00,067
Rym: Sadly, we don't have so many more.

594
00:37:00,529 --> 00:37:00,810
Scott: Yeah.

595
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:01,333
Scott: Well, they're.

596
00:37:01,413 --> 00:37:03,020
Scott: they're like three or four per stage.

597
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,364
Scott: We don't have so far now.

598
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:19,980
Rym: if they had had even half the multiplayer experience that the game key warrior were head I would have rated this game the best multiplayer game Currently available for the Wii possibly going to be one of the greatest of all time for the Wii.

599
00:37:20,202 --> 00:37:21,030
Scott: Yeah, I mean it has.

600
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,162
Scott: the multiplayer is Average.

601
00:37:23,523 --> 00:37:26,392
Rym: Oh, it's kind of and it's so underwhelming don't?

602
00:37:26,432 --> 00:37:26,853
Rym: we can't.

603
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:31,688
Rym: even I can't mitigate this with well But it's I mean at least I.

604
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:35,840
Scott: the only thing I can say about the multiplayer is it's there it works.

605
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:36,322
Scott: See

606
00:37:36,603 --> 00:37:54,699
Rym: it seems and Scott mentioned this when we were playing the game that we expected the GameCube game which was great and I have a feeling and well Scott brought this up first that the Nintendo and the people who designed WarioWare didn't realize that the multiplayer Aspects of the GameCube one is what made it so amazing for so many people.

607
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,128
Scott: Yeah I just think you know.

608
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:57,960
Scott: think about all the WarioWare games.

609
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:07,260
Scott: They've come out with the original Game Boy one completely a single-player experience Twisted single-player experience touched a single-player experience entirely, right?

610
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:13,240
Scott: The GameCube one was just an odd game out that they just poured it to the GameCube for the sake of it.

611
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,517
Scott: I don't even know why they did that.

612
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:16,720
Scott: me You know, it was a Game Boy game.

613
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:21,320
Scott: But I guess they just needed a WarioWare game on the GameCube so that they could cover all the systems.

614
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:23,340
Scott: Yeah, they just ported the original one.

615
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,280
Scott: I guess it also, you know, you could use the Game Boy to play it with the link cable.

616
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:32,380
Rym: I should look at the credits and see who's lacking or who's different between all these games.

617
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:36,600
Scott: So when they came out the Wii one what you know, of course there had to be multiplayer.

618
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:39,102
Scott: They would have been completely stupid Just not have any.

619
00:38:39,544 --> 00:38:47,731
Scott: but you know to put the most effort into that what was primarily a series of single-player Games, I guess they just didn't realize that.

620
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:50,100
Scott: you know, the multiplayer is what everyone really wanted.

621
00:38:50,682 --> 00:38:52,969
Rym: So the multiplayer has a number of.

622
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,140
Scott: the thing is though is like when you watch the ads for WarioWare.

623
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,860
Scott: They always show like a whole bunch of people enjoying it together.

624
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:12,460
Rym: It seems like well if you really look it looks like the way this game is designed because when you're playing even the single-player Between sets of like 20 it'll tell you it'll give you a pose and there's a lot of poses in the game.

625
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,913
Rym: It'll be like pose like this and it doesn't score.

626
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,180
Rym: you doesn't know if you do it or not.

627
00:39:16,842 --> 00:39:25,380
Rym: it seems like the game is designed with Japanese sensibilities for one person's just playing and Everyone else is being entertained by watching them play.

628
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:43,160
Scott: Yeah I mean if you're a normal non geeky people and you actually do with this game tells like if you get normal people to play This and normal people to sit around it'll probably entertain the hell out of them because they're like, oh my god Someone's doing something silly lol, but for geeks it's like no we all need to play this at the same time.

629
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:46,287
Scott: We take it completely seriously And we're gonna see who's the best at it.

630
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:49,924
Rym: god damn know even if it only had round robin Which it does.

631
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:55,227
Rym: cuz if you look at the GameCube one, a lot of people were saying Oh, it doesn't have simultaneous multiplayer.

632
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:55,809
Rym: That's shite.

633
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:01,608
Rym: But if you look at the GameCube one, there was almost no Multiplayer simultaneous action.

634
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:04,660
Scott: I mean, yeah, I mean it the even in the disco game, right?

635
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,808
Scott: Which is the most simultaneous game for the multiplayer for a multiplayer option?

636
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:11,260
Scott: on the GameCube WarioWare?

637
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:17,175
Rym: No It wasn't the most multiplayer one was the turtles because it had the four player game between every set.

638
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:18,279
Scott: I guess I guess.

639
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:22,425
Scott: but even So most of the time, you know It was one person play a game.

640
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,376
Scott: if they win they get ahead if they lose they fall behind.

641
00:40:25,697 --> 00:40:28,989
Scott: and then you know There would be some interlude that involved four people.

642
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:32,529
Scott: the disco game was usually you play a game now You play a game.

643
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,360
Scott: now you play a game.

644
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:33,581
Scott: All right.

645
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:34,548
Scott: Now everyone play a game.

646
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:46,634
Scott: now just you play a game, you know there wasn't a whole lot of everyone playing at the same time, but The the way they did that where at least one everyone has their own controller.

647
00:40:46,654 --> 00:41:11,026
Rym: You're sitting there with your controller and While they weren't a huge part of it Like they were interspersed within other games the four player games that they had in the GameCube one were for the most part Fantastic or at least silly enough to still be fantastic yeah, and the fact that there was periodic multiplayer and It weren't round robin passing it around and everything mesh so well made it great.

648
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:20,689
Rym: Not only is there no simultaneous multiplayer at all Zero in WarioWare smooth moves, but you can't even use more than one.

649
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:21,250
Rym: we mode ever.

650
00:41:22,223 --> 00:41:26,760
Scott: Yep, if you're playing, you know Let's say the angel game which is just round robin.

651
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,566
Scott: everyone plays a game one at a time.

652
00:41:28,606 --> 00:41:29,449
Scott: if you lose you're out.

653
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,493
Scott: if you win you stay in.

654
00:41:30,894 --> 00:41:35,230
Scott: you have to pass the wiimote to Whoever's turn it is and they only get it.

655
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,959
Scott: not only that but they only give you so much time to do it.

656
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:42,480
Scott: No, if you're actually playing with 12, I'd like to actually try to play this to 12 people in one room.

657
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:45,420
Scott: Oh, how would you pass the wiimote to the right person every time?

658
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,909
Scott: I mean and what if I'm trying to beat save Rym?

659
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:53,839
Scott: if I if I just played a game and now it's rims turn I'll just hold on to the wiimote and hand it off to him late and he'll die.

660
00:41:54,241 --> 00:41:59,478
Rym: See again Japanese sensibilities that this game does not have asshole safeguards in it.

661
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,972
Scott: Nope It's it's not.

662
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:08,220
Scott: you know The multiplayer is not constructed to be an actual competition of who knows these micro games and who can do well at them.

663
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:14,639
Scott: It's constructed to just be let's all look silly playing micro games and it's not really a game now.

664
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:18,297
Scott: granted Let's the weed tells people to do silly things and everyone laughs.

665
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:23,460
Rym: granted You don't need the asshole protection if you actually have friends who aren't just horrible people.

666
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,900
Scott: Yeah, I mean I might do that once but I'm not gonna do that most of the time.

667
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,385
Rym: Yeah, or not?

668
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:29,000
Rym: if we're having a semi serious game?

669
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:33,336
Rym: Yeah, but the fact that you have to pass the wiimote now, this would be fine.

670
00:42:33,657 --> 00:42:34,059
Rym: Normally.

671
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:35,406
Rym: All right I just passed the wiimote.

672
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:37,880
Rym: Not only does the aim tell you to use the strap.

673
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,252
Scott: Yeah, it's so contradictory.

674
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:44,191
Scott: use the wrist strap But you didn't give me enough time to take the wrist strap off.

675
00:42:44,272 --> 00:42:48,547
Scott: pass it and have someone else put the wrist strap on Before the game starts, that'd be okay.

676
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,253
Rym: That's just you know Nintendo covering their butt.

677
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:57,700
Rym: There is one micro game One where you have to just let go of the wiimote and let it fall on the wrist strap.

678
00:42:58,001 --> 00:43:03,200
Rym: You can't win it if you don't have the wrist strap on but you can't play multiplayer with the wrist strap.

679
00:43:03,301 --> 00:43:05,520
Rym: And yes, that game is in the multiplayer.

680
00:43:05,687 --> 00:43:05,919
Rym: Yes

681
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:19,031
Scott: I've managed to cheat that game a couple times by when not wearing the wrist strap by just Dropping the wiimote and then catching it like a foot lower Yeah, or by I would play I would have a wiimote with the wrist strap on it But I wouldn't be wearing the wrist strap.

682
00:43:19,373 --> 00:43:27,026
Scott: I would drop the wiimote I'd let go and then I grabbed the wrist strap with my fist and then it would yank on the wiimote and I'd win that Game, but it's totally hit or miss.

683
00:43:27,247 --> 00:43:28,352
Scott: It is totally hit or miss.

684
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,220
Scott: There's no way I can guarantee to win that game.

685
00:43:30,562 --> 00:43:35,627
Scott: how can they reasonably expect you to pass a wiimote and Apply the wrist strap properly.

686
00:43:35,648 --> 00:43:36,471
Scott: It's just insane.

687
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:38,280
Rym: They missed out on so many opportunities.

688
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:41,899
Rym: They have this telephone game where the phone rings and you pick it up and it says something in your ear.

689
00:43:42,682 --> 00:43:52,840
Rym: they could have made games where four wiimotes and four people hear four different things or You know say there's like ten different colors or who can pick up the phone the fastest.

690
00:43:53,372 --> 00:43:57,229
Rym: Yeah There was so much potential that they missed out on now.

691
00:43:57,711 --> 00:44:01,340
Rym: that alone would not have failed the multiplayer because the passing around works.

692
00:44:01,441 --> 00:44:11,660
Rym: Okay, and playing the bomb game or the angel game It's not that big a deal to pass the wiimote around other than losing the fun psychological factor and losing the simultaneous multiplayer.

693
00:44:12,664 --> 00:44:26,721
Scott: on top of all that Aside from the fact that most of the multiplayer modes are utter shite Yeah, I mean the only two multiplayer modes that are worth playing more than a couple times are the angel mode Which is just round-robin survival and the bomb mode Which is.

694
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:30,735
Scott: you get to choose which form the next person is going to have to do.

695
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:35,374
Scott: so I can say aha Rym Let's see you do a mortar and pestle game and then Rym goes.

696
00:44:35,414 --> 00:44:35,755
Scott: I did it.

697
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:39,806
Scott: Let's see you do A remote control game etc.

698
00:44:39,826 --> 00:44:40,287
Scott: Etc.

699
00:44:40,448 --> 00:44:42,052
Scott: And when someone loses, they're out.

700
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:46,127
Rym: Yeah, every multiplayer mode is Single elimination.

701
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:50,785
Rym: Yep, which really ruins a lot of the fun I mean the disco mode.

702
00:44:50,805 --> 00:44:54,535
Scott: in the original the GameCube one was three times losing.

703
00:44:54,896 --> 00:44:58,146
Scott: so that if you play multiplayer It's like you play you play you play someone loses.

704
00:44:58,307 --> 00:44:58,648
Scott: It's over.

705
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:02,360
Scott: Well, the running one is not single elimination, but that one's crap.

706
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:14,040
Rym: Anyway, yeah The running one was really cool up until you end it and then it goes to the like the second half of the running game Which is 100% random mitigated slightly by your score from the previous one.

707
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,705
Rym: It's just nothing.

708
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:16,580
Scott: Yep, but it's pretty bad.

709
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,980
Rym: So the only two games were the crowd for the angel game in the bomb game.

710
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:20,369
Scott: The darts are pretty bad.

711
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:21,859
Scott: you play them once you figure it out.

712
00:45:22,181 --> 00:45:23,183
Rym: I this is sad.

713
00:45:23,524 --> 00:45:37,593
Rym: while monkey ball for the Wii is one of the worst games I've ever paid money for Mm-hmm, and while I'd throw it away if it weren't for the fact that I want to get some of my money back Yeah, the darts the one thing that monkey ball did.

714
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,140
Rym: Okay are better than the darts in Wario.

715
00:45:40,881 --> 00:45:50,897
Scott: Yeah, the darts in Wario where it seems to be like you just aim it and then you shake the reed You just snap the remote, you know quickly and shortly and then the dart will go right where you aimed.

716
00:45:51,158 --> 00:45:51,619
Scott: and that's it.

717
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:01,646
Rym: I'm gonna be slightly lower than where you aimed but to bring the expectations and my satisfaction level even lower Let's look at the two micro god multiplayer games that work.

718
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,873
Rym: the bomb game cool idea.

719
00:46:03,893 --> 00:46:09,960
Rym: if you Pat you pick, you know It tells you who's up next and you pick what form you want them to have to use.

720
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,896
Rym: I already said this and buy up and every time a form is used it gets harder.

721
00:46:13,378 --> 00:46:15,386
Rym: All right That's a really cool mechanic.

722
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:16,510
Scott: the game constantly gets faster.

723
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:19,480
Rym: No matter what you can only use that mechanic in the bomb game.

724
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,239
Rym: there's no option to use it in any other style of multiplayer.

725
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:28,335
Rym: and The only thing the bomb game does is whoever messes up a minigame they lose.

726
00:46:28,516 --> 00:46:29,860
Rym: everyone else wins games over.

727
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:34,497
Scott: Yeah, it's not like let's say there's five people playing the bomb game one person loses.

728
00:46:34,557 --> 00:46:35,199
Scott: Everyone else wins.

729
00:46:35,802 --> 00:46:36,385
Scott: Shouldn't it be?

730
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:39,478
Scott: keep going until everyone blows up except one guy.

731
00:46:39,498 --> 00:46:41,147
Rym: now They do that in the angel game.

732
00:46:41,368 --> 00:46:43,338
Rym: The angel game is last man standing wins.

733
00:46:43,399 --> 00:46:45,366
Rym: great But you can't do the cool.

734
00:46:45,406 --> 00:46:47,252
Rym: pick the form thing from the bomb game.

735
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,680
Rym: It's just single elimination with no options.

736
00:46:50,001 --> 00:46:57,340
Scott: Yep, it gets faster and faster every round, but you can't choose forms or it's just it randomly selects a game that you've played before.

737
00:46:57,531 --> 00:47:04,360
Rym: Yeah So while the bomb game would be better You can never play it with someone who isn't as good as you or else it just ends right away and it's not fun.

738
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:05,544
Scott: And what's the other?

739
00:47:05,665 --> 00:47:07,070
Scott: what's the fourth one the one on the right?

740
00:47:07,211 --> 00:47:10,880
Scott: Well, there's the pump-it-up game that oh, yeah That one doesn't really make sense.

741
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:19,832
Scott: I mean in the original in the old Wario where there was a game where you would inflate a balloon and whoever was playing a micro game when the balloon exploded would lose.

742
00:47:19,892 --> 00:47:25,597
Rym: and that's still the truth in this game and it was Simultaneous all the other three people could pump up the balloon while they were playing.

743
00:47:25,618 --> 00:47:31,380
Scott: Yep So I'd be playing micro games while other three people are pushing a as fast as they can to pump up a balloon.

744
00:47:32,481 --> 00:47:37,460
Scott: Now it's like you pump it up and then I start playing because you hand the wiimote to me.

745
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,143
Scott: It's like it doesn't?

746
00:47:38,203 --> 00:47:38,745
Scott: it doesn't?

747
00:47:38,966 --> 00:47:43,439
Scott: it doesn't work out because you can't really tell like, okay I just pumped it a whole bunch.

748
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:44,925
Scott: When does that count?

749
00:47:45,266 --> 00:47:53,819
Scott: you have to calculate like when the pumping you want it to explode, you know You might pump it up a whole bunch and then when you get the wiimote It'll explode and it kind of sucks.

750
00:47:54,522 --> 00:47:58,777
Scott: The other way where it's simultaneous, you know when you want to pump it whenever you can.

751
00:47:59,018 --> 00:47:59,660
Scott: end of story.

752
00:47:59,964 --> 00:48:04,037
Rym: It makes it's a lot more fun yeah, and basically it just comes down to.

753
00:48:04,057 --> 00:48:18,160
Rym: I mean I would give Wario Ware touch for the DS a C+ just because it's a good game very well executed But the lack of multiplayer basically renders it almost worthless and it has almost no replay value once you've played it through.

754
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:18,864
Scott: Yeah, it's.

755
00:48:18,984 --> 00:48:21,740
Scott: it's basically, you know, a lot of the things with the Wii.

756
00:48:22,182 --> 00:48:24,172
Scott: It's like everything for the Wii is great.

757
00:48:24,252 --> 00:48:29,407
Scott: everything that they have made is great But it's still Disappointing all the things they have not made.

758
00:48:29,728 --> 00:48:33,157
Scott: the Wii is supposed to be a huge party system compared to the 360 and the PS.

759
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,149
Rym: Yeah, and yet there's no good party game.

760
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:41,209
Scott: Oh, there isn't a party game out and they're probably you know That raven grab as I've heard but whatever.

761
00:48:41,229 --> 00:48:43,638
Rym: Well, I'll try just get that cuz I'm hurting here.

762
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:48,622
Scott: Yeah, and There's no party games and let's see What else.

763
00:48:48,722 --> 00:48:52,841
Scott: the virtual console could be 10,000 times more awesome than it is But it isn't.

764
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,511
Scott: there could be a million awesome Wii channels, but there aren't.

765
00:48:57,033 --> 00:48:59,600
Scott: it's like why are they going so slow?

766
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:13,313
Scott: they just open up the can and let people make you know, all sorts of crazy shit for the Wii and Everyone would be happy holding back and not You know taking advantage of the full potential of this amazing system.

767
00:49:13,513 --> 00:49:21,560
Rym: I can tell you why it's going so slow one They're selling wheeze faster than they can make them anyway, and they're selling games in crazy quantities.

768
00:49:21,701 --> 00:49:23,639
Rym: The Wii is making money hand over fist.

769
00:49:24,101 --> 00:49:28,960
Scott: It's like they're not interested in doing better than they have to in order to sell stuff.

770
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:36,187
Rym: so I imagine the moment we sales start slackening or the moment the Release cycle of games start slowing down.

771
00:49:36,628 --> 00:49:40,740
Rym: They'll start bit by bit incrementing the level of quality to keep people like us interested.

772
00:49:41,164 --> 00:49:41,548
Scott: I don't know.

773
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:42,559
Scott: We'll see what they do.

774
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:46,396
Rym: I mean the DS is just now really starting to hit its stride.

775
00:49:46,556 --> 00:49:48,263
Rym: when it first came out It was the same deal.

776
00:49:48,584 --> 00:49:50,271
Rym: the DS had so much potential.

777
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:51,616
Scott: We're about to enter another DS.

778
00:49:51,796 --> 00:49:54,669
Scott: Glut actually Yeah, but I think it's like the end of the world.

779
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:57,887
Rym: until the Pokemon games come out the first year the DS There was.

780
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:02,292
Rym: I mean it was a good system But there was so much it could have been doing that it just wasn't.

781
00:50:02,312 --> 00:50:04,422
Scott: there's still a whole bunch of the DS could be doing That.

782
00:50:04,442 --> 00:50:10,700
Rym: it isn't yeah, but bit by bit It's starting to figure itself out and I think the DS is gonna have a really really long life cycle.

783
00:50:11,263 --> 00:50:16,452
Scott: Yeah, I definitely get a DS is gonna hang around for a while But you know it's like when we first got the DS.

784
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:17,778
Scott: We were seeing games like.

785
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:20,275
Scott: you know What's it called the Kirby's?

786
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,825
Scott: Canvas curse right you know.

787
00:50:22,906 --> 00:50:29,807
Scott: and now the stylus is mostly being used for games like Phoenix Wright and Hotel dusk which is fine.

788
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:30,611
Rym: Those are the kind of games.

789
00:50:30,671 --> 00:50:35,129
Scott: I want I like those games, but it's you know It's like all the you know potential of the DS.

790
00:50:35,169 --> 00:50:38,200
Scott: It's Wi-Fi and it's stylus and all that stuff.

791
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,053
Scott: You know hotel dust could have been just doesn't even need the stylus.

792
00:50:42,394 --> 00:50:45,344
Scott: You know it's like come on people They're very.

793
00:50:45,364 --> 00:50:45,927
Scott: they're not taking.

794
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:48,058
Scott: the microphone on the DS doesn't get used for shit.

795
00:50:49,064 --> 00:50:49,949
Scott: The what else?

796
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:51,920
Scott: on the DS the Wi-Fi is barely used.

797
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,880
Scott: I mean Tetris is the last game to make use of the Wi-Fi in any reasonable good way.

798
00:50:56,482 --> 00:50:57,809
Scott: You know I don't know.

799
00:50:57,969 --> 00:51:00,280
Scott: It's just sad that these things could be awesome.

800
00:51:00,603 --> 00:51:07,800
Scott: They have been used in awesome ways But it doesn't really stick because no one keeps hammering it with the full potential.

801
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:14,259
Rym: I think the other problem is that a lot of the people in Nintendo They make a game and it sells really well.

802
00:51:14,761 --> 00:51:18,914
Rym: I don't think they realize that if they'd made the game a little bit better.

803
00:51:18,934 --> 00:51:20,880
Rym: It would sell so much more.

804
00:51:21,563 --> 00:51:25,360
Scott: Also, or the people you know the other thing is that they made a game a little bit better.

805
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:32,777
Scott: It would not only sell so much more But the price would stay up for longer on the shelf because people would just keep playing the game.

806
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,484
Scott: for you know I mean WarioWare.

807
00:51:34,504 --> 00:51:36,652
Scott: I don't see us playing this game of you know.

808
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:40,727
Scott: six to twelve months from now It's probably just gonna sit there not being played.

809
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,740
Rym: however what I do see us doing is playing WarioWare for the Gamecube forever.

810
00:51:45,062 --> 00:51:53,495
Scott: Yep, exactly, and you know that's gonna sell You know copies of WarioWare for the Gamecube down the road, so I guess come on Nintendo.

811
00:51:53,957 --> 00:51:55,080
Rym: Give us a dev kit.

812
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,806
Scott: Goddamn, yeah, I think that's the real problem.

813
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:00,415
Scott: that this shit goes down is because Nintendo is just so.

814
00:52:00,796 --> 00:52:03,960
Scott: you know they promised hey We're gonna make it cheaper to make Wii games.

815
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:04,562
Scott: And it's true.

816
00:52:04,944 --> 00:52:12,820
Scott: if you want to develop games of the Wii you don't need as much money as you would need To develop 360 games or ps3 games because the dev kit is cheap.

817
00:52:13,403 --> 00:52:16,540
Scott: The thing is they don't give the dev kit to just anyone with enough money.

818
00:52:16,944 --> 00:52:25,911
Scott: They check you out And they very restrictive and who they give it to and who they don't give it to for you know corporate secret Intellectual property reasons.

819
00:52:25,931 --> 00:52:26,759
Scott: they don't want you telling.

820
00:52:26,779 --> 00:52:29,292
Scott: well I think it's also the secret of the Wii dev kit.

821
00:52:29,433 --> 00:52:30,720
Rym: Nintendo is very much.

822
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,599
Rym: I mean even way back back when they used to be sued for antitrust stuff all the time They were very much.

823
00:52:36,102 --> 00:52:40,740
Rym: They wanted to make sure that the games that came out on their systems met their standards of quality.

824
00:52:41,163 --> 00:52:43,280
Rym: And they were and I can understand that well.

825
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:51,459
Rym: They were so afraid of any non gamer Seeing a bad game and thinking poorly of their console as a result.

826
00:52:51,499 --> 00:53:06,293
Scott: well it was mostly people like coming out with Tengen games and stuff because when you if you want to make a Gamecube game or a DS game or a Xbox game you have to pay Microsoft or Nintendo or Sony a license for you know your game.

827
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:08,560
Scott: That's why that Nintendo seal of quality is there.

828
00:53:08,941 --> 00:53:19,240
Scott: That's why you know if you're 360 game if you want there you to have a game Published for the 360 in those little 360 DVD cases that works you have to pay Microsoft money.

829
00:53:19,561 --> 00:53:21,471
Scott: And that's how they make most of their money.

830
00:53:21,852 --> 00:53:24,404
Scott: when you sell a video game console You know you don't.

831
00:53:24,565 --> 00:53:26,954
Scott: it's Microsoft doesn't make enough first-party games.

832
00:53:27,256 --> 00:53:28,019
Scott: You know they what they make.

833
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:28,280
Scott: halo.

834
00:53:28,782 --> 00:53:29,385
Scott: That's about it.

835
00:53:29,747 --> 00:53:32,539
Scott: You know all these third parties pay Microsoft money.

836
00:53:33,402 --> 00:53:39,480
Scott: So if you have people like Tengen just making games for the NES without paying fees to Nintendo.

837
00:53:40,144 --> 00:53:42,900
Scott: That means that now Nintendo can't make money.

838
00:53:44,002 --> 00:53:49,520
Rym: So except at least Nintendo also makes a huge profit on the Wii itself and on all the accessories.

839
00:53:49,761 --> 00:53:51,229
Rym: Yeah, see Nintendo.

840
00:53:51,491 --> 00:53:53,966
Rym: We said this last week to Nintendo.

841
00:53:54,268 --> 00:54:06,122
Rym: they make a lot of great things and Despite the fact that we just spent a while bashing Nintendo They're far and away doing better than Sony and Microsoft in my book in terms of quality games and potential and yeah Everything.

842
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:09,657
Rym: but primarily they want your money, and they'll do anything to get it.

843
00:54:09,717 --> 00:54:14,312
Scott: and currently They don't have to do all these things that we complain about.

844
00:54:14,352 --> 00:54:18,525
Scott: they don't have to meet their full potential in order to get your Money, I mean, so why should they?

845
00:54:18,545 --> 00:54:19,971
Scott: it's like a communist.

846
00:54:20,072 --> 00:54:21,237
Scott: I don't have to work on the farm.

847
00:54:21,277 --> 00:54:22,080
Scott: I get paid anyway.

848
00:54:22,242 --> 00:54:23,760
Rym: Here's what I would have done if I was Nintendo.

849
00:54:24,201 --> 00:54:28,875
Rym: I would release the current WarioWare as is because look we bought it.

850
00:54:29,296 --> 00:54:30,660
Rym: every gamer bought it.

851
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:33,412
Rym: They made had money over it hand over fist.

852
00:54:33,954 --> 00:54:37,608
Rym: all the people who don't want to buy Wario Where they're buying wheeze just to play Wii Sports.

853
00:54:37,648 --> 00:54:38,712
Rym: They're making money off of them.

854
00:54:39,394 --> 00:54:43,004
Rym: They'll release another Wario game Years from now.

855
00:54:43,064 --> 00:54:47,600
Rym: yeah, and it'll have what we want because now we've been burned we won't buy another Wario.

856
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,827
Scott: That's a very optimistic outlook.

857
00:54:49,947 --> 00:54:50,228
Scott: I'm not.

858
00:54:50,248 --> 00:54:51,553
Scott: I don't know if I'm so optimistic.

859
00:54:51,613 --> 00:54:57,759
Rym: It's such a cynical optimistic outlook though It's like Nintendo conspired to force me to buy a crap war.

860
00:54:57,799 --> 00:55:02,956
Scott: yeah But I'm talking about the fact that you believe that they're eventually going to meet the full potential.

861
00:55:03,658 --> 00:55:04,561
Scott: I'm 50/50.

862
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:06,527
Rym: I think the full potential.

863
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:16,134
Rym: I think they're gonna release a WarioWare in a year or two that will have Enough more multiplayer to trick us into giving another Wario game a chance.

864
00:55:16,515 --> 00:55:18,321
Scott: Yeah, my I'm 50/50.

865
00:55:18,321 --> 00:55:19,565
Scott: I think that they're probably just.

866
00:55:19,685 --> 00:55:23,780
Scott: they're not gonna do any more than they have to to keep selling stuff.

867
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,104
Scott: You know all that.

868
00:55:25,144 --> 00:55:25,867
Scott: They're not gonna.

869
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:28,476
Scott: You know if people keep buying virtual console games.

870
00:55:28,496 --> 00:55:29,479
Scott: They're not gonna lower the price.

871
00:55:29,499 --> 00:55:37,827
Scott: if They don't need to put out you know free demos of virtual console games to trick you into buying them Right out then they're not going to.

872
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:41,698
Scott: you know if they're not gonna put out original content on the virtual console.

873
00:55:41,718 --> 00:55:44,448
Scott: if they don't have To they're not gonna put out more channels.

874
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:50,472
Scott: if they don't have to they're gonna do only what they have to Just to get money, and they're not gonna do anything.

875
00:55:50,693 --> 00:55:52,340
Scott: There's a chance of not being profitable.

876
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:59,549
Scott: You know if they spend a bajillion dollars making a new we channel and only Thousand people get it there.

877
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:00,914
Scott: They're not gonna take a risk on that.

878
00:56:01,376 --> 00:56:02,219
Scott: I think that's how it's gonna go.

879
00:56:03,064 --> 00:56:05,197
Rym: Oh, well, yeah, I think we've ran it enough.

880
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:13,429
Scott: yes So Wario aware if you feel like micro games a lot if you like you know Warioware touched and Warioware Twisted and all that.

881
00:56:13,952 --> 00:56:15,320
Scott: you'll like this Warioware.

882
00:56:15,802 --> 00:56:16,845
Scott: You might like it more.

883
00:56:16,946 --> 00:56:20,899
Rym: if you like the GameCube Warioware stay the hell away from.

884
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:28,638
Scott: yeah If you're looking for mostly multiplayer, and you don't really give a crap about single-player This is not worth the $50 that they're charging for.

885
00:56:28,698 --> 00:56:29,944
Rym: it's worth Maybe 10 bucks.

886
00:56:30,104 --> 00:56:34,260
Scott: yeah wait a long time for it to be used and get it for 10 bucks.

887
00:56:34,681 --> 00:56:41,883
Rym: Oh, and as a quick little aside here you might remember that I gave kind of a preview about Castlevania portrait of ruin mm-hmm And I was.

888
00:56:42,204 --> 00:56:44,778
Rym: I mean it wasn't the greatest game, but I definitely said it was worth getting.

889
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:49,479
Rym: yep I retract that this game could die in a goddamn fire.

890
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:52,091
Rym: whoa Good happen there.

891
00:56:52,111 --> 00:57:00,490
Rym: I almost Upon reaching a certain point in the game discovering what I had to do in order to be allowed To play the rest of the game.

892
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:02,000
Rym: it was horseshit.

893
00:57:02,382 --> 00:57:05,939
Rym: I almost just took the game out and said screw it not worth it not gonna play the rest.

894
00:57:06,602 --> 00:57:12,660
Rym: Wow the only game I've done that for ever other than what I almost did with portrait of ruin was Princess Peach.

895
00:57:13,161 --> 00:57:19,658
Rym: Nah, when yeah, you know go you didn't get all the toads better go back And I just took the game out and that was the end.

896
00:57:20,464 --> 00:57:23,060
Scott: Yeah, I don't I never really do that with games.

897
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,227
Scott: I mean you just kind of yeah give up.

898
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:34,540
Rym: you have got to cast a spell that you can find in a secret area Of the game on a specific boss But the boss has to be in range and your partner has to cast it.

899
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:45,094
Rym: You can't control your partner while you're casting it and the spell takes like a minute to cast and if anything touches her Or she goes too far away from you or off the screen or you die.

900
00:57:45,194 --> 00:57:45,836
Rym: It doesn't work.

901
00:57:46,418 --> 00:57:56,745
Rym: Wow Scott Scott was actually in the room while I was trying to beat it and the conversation was basically me going fuck Fuck and I turned the DS off.

902
00:57:56,785 --> 00:58:10,200
Scott: I'd reset it fuck reset fuck reset god damn it reset reset For like a half hour and of course, there's no way to know that you have to do this without looking at a fact online.

903
00:58:10,461 --> 00:58:14,059
Rym: Yeah, well granted if you find the secret spell it's pretty obvious what to do.

904
00:58:14,501 --> 00:58:18,620
Rym: Oh, okay, cuz the spell cures vampirism and then you fight a vampire.

905
00:58:19,021 --> 00:58:24,200
Scott: So but is finding the secret spell arbitrary or is there like hints that say hey the secret spell over there?

906
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,945
Rym: No, there's no hint that there's a secret spell.

907
00:58:26,065 --> 00:58:35,040
Rym: really there's an all the way hint where another guy contracts vampirism And she's like there's probably a spell that could undo this but no hint as to where it would be hidden.

908
00:58:35,482 --> 00:58:45,060
Rym: Okay, and you have to turn into a frog and run into this little corridor and run oh and you'll find it like hidden in The corner, you know, I'm not gonna start another rant now, but arbitrary stuff in games pisses me.

909
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:50,440
Rym: It wasn't as arbitrary as the side quests in Crystal Chronicles, which we're just so not worth.

910
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:52,180
Scott: No, that was the most arbitrary thing ever.

911
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:57,423
Scott: Oh, no, the most arbitrary thing ever would be the stuff in ogre battle 64.

912
00:58:57,423 --> 00:59:03,178
Scott: You never played that but I know anyway, no, that's why people learn something from the Zelda games.

913
00:59:03,238 --> 00:59:05,128
Scott: in the Zelda games Nothing is arbitrary.

914
00:59:05,411 --> 00:59:06,660
Scott: It's all right in your face.

915
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,186
Rym: Yeah, if you can't figure out a puzzle.

916
00:59:08,427 --> 00:59:10,977
Rym: the answer is to step back and look cuz you're just not miss.

917
00:59:10,997 --> 00:59:11,740
Rym: you're missing something.

918
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,407
Scott: Yep in in other games.

919
00:59:13,447 --> 00:59:16,540
Scott: It's like yeah that perfectly normal looking wall.

920
00:59:16,801 --> 00:59:28,078
Scott: There's no way you could have known but if you hit it with this item that you only have one of in the entire game It'll crumble and behind it There's another item that you can use somewhere else to get another secret which leads you to the secret ending.

921
00:59:28,118 --> 00:59:30,246
Scott: It's like You didn't give me a hint.

922
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,672
Scott: You didn't put a crack in the wall.

923
00:59:31,933 --> 00:59:33,500
Scott: You didn't have a character say, huh?

924
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,120
Scott: There's something funny about that wall.

925
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:37,787
Scott: If only I had an X to use on the wall.

926
00:59:38,028 --> 00:59:47,157
Rym: at least at least if you get past that bullshit in Portrait of ruin it looks like the rest of the game is a really good game.

927
00:59:47,177 --> 00:59:49,084
Rym: Uh-huh, okay So it's worth it.

928
00:59:49,405 --> 00:59:52,396
Scott: Just is it worth the full price right now of what 30 35 dollars?

929
00:59:54,281 --> 00:59:56,190
Rym: It could be it's it's not.

930
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,697
Scott: if you really like Castlevania.

931
00:59:57,757 --> 00:59:58,420
Scott: You should definitely go.

932
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:07,900
Rym: Yeah, if you played Castlevania DS and you're just itching for more gotten by it There's no reason not to yeah, but if you didn't if you haven't played Castlevania DS yet, don't even look at this game.

933
01:00:08,242 --> 01:00:08,888
