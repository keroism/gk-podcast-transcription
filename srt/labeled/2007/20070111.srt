00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,228
Scott: It's Thursday January 11th.

2
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:18,393
Scott: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight geek Thunderdome.

3
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:21,937
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:37,060
Rym: So a little while ago and what is a semi-rare occurrence in the geek house meaning This is the first time it's happened in a long time We had some non geeks in the house while we were here and there's not much you can do with non geeks.

5
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:38,246
Rym: I mean, they're cool people.

6
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:40,680
Rym: I know from IBM and I had a lot of fun with the people at IBM.

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:50,439
Rym: I mean, I was probably all things considered one of my favorite jobs ever other than obviously when I worked for the government which was super awesome because you didn't have to do any work and they paid you a lot of money.

8
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:54,092
Rym: and If no one cared about the well, it was great.

9
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:56,060
Rym: just hanging out, but you know, I had fun there.

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,787
Rym: But hanging out with non geeks.

11
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,634
Rym: I mean, it's not like the bad people.

12
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:00,016
Rym: What do you?

13
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:01,100
Rym: what can I say to him?

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,203
Rym: What joke can I make?

15
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,577
Rym: it's always not awkward, but there's always this kind of disconnect.

16
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:06,440
Scott: Yeah, it's like, huh?

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,144
Scott: What can I say?

18
00:01:07,446 --> 00:01:11,668
Scott: Well, I can't say you can't hold ten Pokemon Yeah, or we were watching.

19
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:13,999
Rym: we showed him some cowboy bebop, which they kind of liked.

20
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:15,104
Rym: I mean everyone.

21
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:20,910
Rym: I've never met someone who I've shown cowboy bebop to who didn't like it and they They would just wouldn't be humans if they didn't like it.

22
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:21,212
Scott: Yeah.

23
00:01:21,252 --> 00:01:22,157
Scott: Yeah, but

24
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:28,108
Rym: like There's a joke about big O and I you know I make the joke about big O and because

25
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:39,219
Scott: it is a scene in episode 3 where Faye looks at her Well, not her watch but this bracelet and she pushes a button on it and then she says show time We're like big O. and they totally were like why?

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,726
Rym: Though to their credit there was.

27
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:52,260
Rym: they were reminded of Star Wars and they made a fairly pertinent Star Wars joke They did to which I made an equally pertinent Star Wars joke and they laughed at it, which was good.

28
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:55,237
Scott: Yep, who knows if they actually realized it was a Star Wars.

29
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:55,740
Rym: No, they did.

30
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,046
Rym: There's no way they didn't.

31
00:01:57,528 --> 00:02:00,079
Rym: unless it was I can't imagine what else that could have been from.

32
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:01,425
Scott: Just let you just laugh.

33
00:02:01,446 --> 00:02:03,876
Scott: when someone says something cuz you know, you're supposed to you know happens.

34
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:04,640
Scott: You do that a lot.

35
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:07,304
Rym: Well, I What are you doing?

36
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,574
Rym: a social situation where you're hanging out with someone.

37
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:10,479
Rym: you have nothing against them.

38
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,280
Rym: They're a cool person, but you just have almost nothing in common with him like anything.

39
00:02:14,943 --> 00:02:15,144
Scott: That was.

40
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:19,000
Scott: the other thing is that we're like, alright, we're eating dinner where you got Chinese food in the living room.

41
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:20,187
Scott: What do we watch?

42
00:02:20,248 --> 00:02:21,093
Scott: we got to watch something?

43
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,260
Scott: Well, we don't have television.

44
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:29,420
Scott: We don't have a movie is too long because we got to get these people out of our house pretty soon So we can do the show so we don't want to borrow him.

45
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,100
Rym: I mean nothing's worse than going to someone's house and they try to show you something.

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,870
Rym: That's two hours long that they like that.

47
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,855
Rym: You really don't care about.

48
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:36,680
Scott: Yeah, so we're like, huh?

49
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,241
Scott: What do we got?

50
00:02:37,602 --> 00:02:46,179
Rym: cowboy bebop was the only thing we had that was the closest thing to something a normal person might enjoy That is even anywhere near our house.

51
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:58,899
Scott: Yeah, so it's like we hang out with all these geeks and people all the time and you know Everything seems kind of on the level and as soon as someone who's even slightly normal comes into the fold It's like whoa, it's like what do you say?

52
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:02,360
Scott: It's like the same way they must feel if we go to their house and they're like, whoa.

53
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:04,488
Scott: Yeah, it's mad.

54
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:09,692
Rym: like any time we started talking about a geeky thing They just kind of get quiet and anytime they were started talking about.

55
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:11,600
Rym: I don't know something real in the world.

56
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:13,692
Rym: We were just like, uh, yeah.

57
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:15,040
Rym: Yeah, how about that weather?

58
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,146
Rym: Talked about the weather like four times.

59
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,535
Scott: All right, so it's Thursday.

60
00:03:20,555 --> 00:03:25,740
Rym: It is Thursday We'll get to the show in a bit, but we don't really care about the news.

61
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,973
Rym: So he just kind of picked some random stuff out there on the internet.

62
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:33,860
Scott: Yeah, I picked your standard Fark style injustice story and I picked it.

63
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:42,213
Rym: Well, there was another one that I almost talked about but I decided that too much injustice zombies something Mmm, yeah swallow joke.

64
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:42,876
Scott: Yep.

65
00:03:43,178 --> 00:03:43,379
Rym: Yeah.

66
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:49,140
Rym: So instead I just wanted to talk about Cedar Point and coincidentally they've re-begun construction.

67
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:54,682
Rym: Yes, re-begun on Cedar Point's new roller coaster the maverick Uh-huh.

68
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:56,609
Rym: Now I didn't care at first.

69
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:58,495
Scott: When's the last time we rode a roller coaster?

70
00:03:58,536 --> 00:03:58,937
Scott: Wildwood?

71
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:03,716
Rym: God at Wildwood We paid like eight bucks each to ride this chintzy little wooden roller coaster.

72
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,519
Scott: It was pretty good though.

73
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:05,405
Scott: Well, here's the thing.

74
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:07,400
Scott: Mostly because I hadn't had a roller coaster in a while.

75
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,970
Scott: Yeah It's like having chocolate after not having chocolate for a month.

76
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:16,220
Rym: I'll say this it was a piss-poor roller coaster And as far as even as far as wooden coasters go it was pretty low on the scale.

77
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:26,128
Rym: It was probably the worst wooden coaster I've ever been on But I hadn't been on a roller coaster since the last time I went to Cedar Point Which was when I was in high school.

78
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:28,297
Rym: No, no, no, it was after my freshman year of college.

79
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:29,120
Rym: I went one more time.

80
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,871
Rym: So that was a pretty fantastic roller coaster all things considered.

81
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:35,820
Scott: Yeah, the last roller coaster I went on before that one.

82
00:04:36,422 --> 00:04:42,445
Scott: Yeah, the last time I went on a roller coaster before what the great white in Wildwood Oh God was.

83
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:47,081
Scott: I went on the Superman at Six Flags New England in the summer of 2001.

84
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:51,876
Rym: While I'm generally down on a lot of non-seater point places the Superman gets respect.

85
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:52,980
Scott: It was pretty good.

86
00:04:53,060 --> 00:05:02,102
Scott: It's actually that is also like the biggest and baddest roller coaster I've been on mostly because I don't go in upside downy ones was yeah Why what?

87
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:06,620
Rym: upside downy roller coasters are the second best kinds of roller coasters now?

88
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,824
Scott: I prefer it.

89
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:09,188
Rym: it goes in this order.

90
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:18,875
Rym: the standard three Hill is the best roller coaster as far as I'm concerned Followed right away by upside downy followed by wooden followed by well from there.

91
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:20,580
Rym: We have to argue semantics.

92
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:30,860
Scott: I'm a big fan of Wooden roller coasters But as long as they're like newer wooden ones like the ones that go digga digga digga And they're all shaky not so good.

93
00:05:31,402 --> 00:05:40,159
Scott: But there's some like the Cyclone or the Gwazi that are the high quality stuff And it's a nice smooth ride and real fast and real fun.

94
00:05:40,822 --> 00:05:44,838
Scott: I'm also a fan of you know stuff like the Superman which is badass.

95
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,184
Rym: see now Here's the semantics.

96
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:47,449
Scott: there's a lot of action.

97
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,840
Scott: You know I don't like to have it like a long stretch.

98
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:51,940
Scott: It's got to be left right up down.

99
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:53,985
Rym: See hands down.

100
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:54,969
Rym: the best roller coaster.

101
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,459
Rym: I've ever been on is still the Millennium Force at Cedar Point.

102
00:05:58,262 --> 00:06:00,528
Rym: That's a pretty damn fantastic roller coaster.

103
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:02,153
Scott: It might be it's my style too.

104
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:02,474
Scott: It goes.

105
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,223
Scott: It's not upside down upside down It's real fast.

106
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:06,026
Rym: It's super fast.

107
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:10,541
Rym: There's a lot of up and down a lot of left and right some tunnels a gigantic Hill.

108
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:11,926
Scott: that's just oh god.

109
00:06:12,187 --> 00:06:13,752
Rym: You can see Canada from that hill.

110
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:14,796
Scott: yeah, well.

111
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:15,860
Scott: It's pretty close to Canada.

112
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,005
Rym: No, it's not like.

113
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,150
Scott: I don't know it would.

114
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,286
Scott: one thing if the roller coaster was in Louisiana and you could see Canada.

115
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:27,080
Rym: no it's in northern, Ohio, but you can see Canada due to a technicality because there's this island.

116
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:40,823
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but dude I built this roller coaster in The you know Baja, California, and you could totally see Maine from there at the top Right.

117
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:42,008
Rym: so fun fact for the day.

118
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:43,576
Rym: well one this roller coaster.

119
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:46,340
Rym: to get back on topic I was really unimpressed with it.

120
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,745
Rym: I thought why is Cedar Point building?

121
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:48,769
Rym: this would intimate.

122
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:51,780
Rym: even make a roller coaster this tiny because it's like a hundred feet tall.

123
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:53,420
Rym: Then I looked at it.

124
00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:01,279
Rym: I finally saw a picture of it and Basically they took the second good part of the Millennium Force Which is going real fast close to the ground left and right twisty.

125
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:07,120
Rym: And they made a whole roller coaster like that with some magnetic launches in the middle not just in the beginning.

126
00:07:07,904 --> 00:07:08,487
Scott: It's one of those.

127
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:13,456
Scott: you know you're going you're going surprised you're going faster You're going real fast real close to the ground.

128
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:19,344
Scott: on this one I kind of wish someone make a roller coaster where the whole thing was constantly Accelerating.

129
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:21,555
Scott: you who with magnetic force until the end.

130
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:22,540
Rym: that'd be pretty cool.

131
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:33,160
Scott: Actually, you just constantly going faster even going uphill like you go down a hill then you start going up But you're going faster than you were going down And then when you get to the top of that hill and go down you're going even faster.

132
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:35,999
Scott: It just gives like a hundred miles an hour you go.

133
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,151
Rym: Oh, God some face flies off someday.

134
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,740
Rym: We got to make a trip to Cedar Point one final time.

135
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,825
Scott: We should you know we should do.

136
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:45,680
Scott: we should make a roller coaster that doesn't go up and down.

137
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:53,850
Scott: It's just a big ring just a horizontal ring not a vertical one and you go around in a circle But you go around in a circle at like 300 miles an hour.

138
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,074
Scott: I got ridiculous.

139
00:07:55,315 --> 00:07:56,640
Rym: I did that at space camp.

140
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,926
Rym: It's not fun.

141
00:07:57,946 --> 00:07:59,293
Scott: That's gotta be fun.

142
00:07:59,313 --> 00:07:59,353
Rym: No.

143
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:01,386
Rym: It's not fun It hurts.

144
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,665
Rym: you feel like you're gonna vomit But you can't.

145
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:05,719
Rym: it feels like someone has their fist in yours.

146
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,673
Scott: well You know how they made like they used to have the upside down ones that were a perfect circle And then they made the ones that were sort of like.

147
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:12,619
Scott: you know the little loop.

148
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:15,555
Scott: Yeah, and the loop doesn't make you bargo, but the circle does.

149
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:18,329
Scott: oh, yeah Maybe there's a way you could do that on the ground.

150
00:08:19,013 --> 00:08:20,320
Rym: no the issue was the g-forces.

151
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:23,994
Rym: They spin you around and you can't.

152
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:28,496
Rym: you'd barely breathe And it just sucks and you get off and everyone else is like isn't it awesome.

153
00:08:28,536 --> 00:08:32,714
Rym: I can't wait for my turn and you just say Good luck with that.

154
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:36,289
Scott: That's all you but didn't you see the video?

155
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,998
Scott: I am interested in that Japanese coaster though.

156
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,347
Rym: Oh, yeah We'll save that for a thing of the day.

157
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:44,019
Rym: or maybe when we talk about roller coasters didn't we already?

158
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,057
Rym: yeah I don't know.

159
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,478
Scott: I'll tell you wait until we actually go to an amusement park which we plan to do for years and still haven't done.

160
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:56,320
Rym: yeah someday We're gonna go to a real roller coaster park like either a really good Six Flags or cedar point.

161
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:02,900
Scott: They pretty much Six Flags, New England because that's the best place within reach or cedar point because that's the best place slightly out of reach.

162
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,248
Scott: Yeah, I mean if we go to a water park.

163
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:08,479
Scott: We'll either go to Six Flags, New England because it's within reach.

164
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:08,780
Scott: see this.

165
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,700
Scott: I love litter bond, which is out of reach.

166
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,140
Rym: I love roller coasters, but I don't love them enough to put significant effort into getting to them anymore.

167
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:20,190
Rym: Yeah, cedar point is worth the 60 bucks to get into me.

168
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:22,980
Rym: It is not worth going to Ohio from here.

169
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:30,111
Scott: You know what they should really do is like instead of having amusement parks You know, I mean like come here and there are a bunch of rides.

170
00:09:30,713 --> 00:09:33,809
Scott: Why can't there just be like I go down the street I see a supermarket.

171
00:09:34,193 --> 00:09:40,220
Scott: I see a blockbuster I see a roller coaster And then if I want to ride the roller coaster, I walk up and I pay five bucks and I ride.

172
00:09:41,184 --> 00:09:45,339
Rym: well where I grew up in Michigan, there was lakeside mall.

173
00:09:45,359 --> 00:10:09,576
Rym: and inside of lakeside mall in the middle of this two-story mall one section was blocked off all like the whole two stories vertically and where the store would be there was big glass window going all the way up and down and Inside of there was a small water park with a. The slides went like around the malls that had Ferris wheels.

174
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:10,880
Scott: real fancy Ferris wheels?

175
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:13,487
Scott: No No I've been to malls with carousels.

176
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:20,400
Rym: real fancy care thing had a water park with water slides where the tubes Were like kind of it like they ended here in this big pool.

177
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:27,650
Rym: You can see people like come in and there's like a translucent one that went across the top and they went around other parts of The mall I guess in the back substructure or whatever.

178
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:29,277
Scott: dude if I'm ever see.

179
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:29,880
Scott: that's one thing.

180
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,689
Scott: They're building like bigger and bigger malls trying to compete with the Mall of America Like they're doing something in Syracuse or the giant mall.

181
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:38,660
Scott: and what a lot of places are trying to build giant malls.

182
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:43,603
Scott: Right, none of these giant malls have a monorail Monorail monorail.

183
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:44,366
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

184
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:44,727
Scott: Okay.

185
00:10:44,888 --> 00:10:50,670
Scott: Alright, so so I got their standard story of modern injustice.

186
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,199
Rym: ah Injustice, I know thee well.

187
00:10:53,783 --> 00:11:02,523
Scott: There is a substitute schoolteacher in Connecticut Probably near Eastern Connecticut in near Norwich because the Norwich newspaper is reporting on it Right now.

188
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:06,820
Scott: this teacher has been found guilty of exposing children to porn.

189
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:08,445
Scott: They are going to be sentenced.

190
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:12,799
Scott: The maximum sentence is 40 years in prison, but they probably won't get the maximum sentence.

191
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:20,520
Scott: Anyway, the defense says it was a case of spyware on the school machine that the teacher didn't like.

192
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:30,839
Scott: You know open some porn and show it to kids like hey kids check this out That she was just using a computer and there's a bunch of pop-ups that happen to have porn and kids saw it.

193
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:33,547
Scott: The school did not have did have.

194
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:34,048
Scott: they did.

195
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:41,819
Scott: they had content filtering software, you know to filter out porn But the license was expired, huh?

196
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:50,929
Scott: according to another article Computer expert Herbert Horner who I trust who performed a forensic Examination of the computer for the defense.

197
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,234
Rym: All right, he had a class on that.

198
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,024
Scott: cops who took it said Amero might have.

199
00:11:55,164 --> 00:12:02,427
Scott: Amero is the guilty person may have been redirected to the sexually oriented sites through a Hairstyling site accessed from the computer.

200
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:06,419
Scott: He said the site allowed spyware to be downloaded onto the computer which allowed the pop-ups.

201
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:11,479
Scott: According to one source only one source So who knows the trial judge?

202
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:17,920
Scott: Was seen falling asleep during proceedings and made comments to the jury that she wanted the case over by the end of the week.

203
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:27,160
Rym: now I would hope I wish that I didn't believe that outright but I've been to some trials where the judge obviously didn't give a shit.

204
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:33,517
Scott: It was also reported that the judge attempted to pressure the defense into an unwanted plea deal in place of a trial.

205
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:41,800
Scott: the defense attorney Moved for a mistrial shortly before closing arguments Friday based on reports that jurors had discussed the case at a local restaurant.

206
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:49,380
Scott: The detective in the investigation admitted there was no search made for adware which can generate pop-up ads.

207
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:51,306
Scott: Was justice done here?

208
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:55,100
Scott: a bad spot just that you can read the article that there's only like one sentence left.

209
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:04,260
Scott: All right, while oh and then the local newspaper is like Yeah, the local newspaper is kind of against this defendant.

210
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:06,208
Scott: They're like, this is bad.

211
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:07,573
Scott: You shouldn't be showing porn to kids.

212
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:09,200
Scott: We need to you know, all right.

213
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,497
Rym: So we're not arguing that showing porn to little kids is a good thing, especially in school.

214
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:21,340
Scott: Well, I mean I Personally do not have a problem with little kids seeing naked people or naked people doing it.

215
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:24,918
Scott: You know if I had kids and they saw porn I'd be like man that I would be like.

216
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:25,320
Rym: that is porn.

217
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,853
Scott: Oh, but but at the same time it's a public school in a public school.

218
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:31,597
Scott: You cannot show kids prawn.

219
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:32,460
Scott: That's not cool.

220
00:13:32,662 --> 00:13:34,340
Scott: It's obvious why it's not cool.

221
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:50,200
Rym: No It seems like this whole issue comes down to the fact that not a single person involved From the defendant to the school to the judge to the jury to the prosecutor to anyone Knows a single good goddamn thing about technology.

222
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:57,319
Scott: the only person who seems to understand about technology is this computer expert Herbert Horner who performed a friend's examination for the defense.

223
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,945
Scott: and Why that you know.

224
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,472
Scott: that didn't help convince the jury.

225
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:02,893
Scott: I don't know.

226
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:08,899
Rym: see this is part of the reason why more and more I want to go into law school since I already have a degree in IT.

227
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,396
Rym: I'd be that lawyer who knows about tech and could explain it to people in ways.

228
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,380
Rym: They could understand.

229
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,445
Scott: Yeah, see now here.

230
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:20,765
Scott: I think the problem when you know when I look at this big picture here is First of all the judge.

231
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,300
Scott: I don't know if I should trust that one source with the reporting on the judge.

232
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:31,859
Rym: there's a story about a judge falling asleep in trial or Like saying something like let's just fry this guy and go home like every week.

233
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:38,160
Scott: Yeah, so I'm willing to believe it but I can't just believe it right out without without some more evidence.

234
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:47,339
Scott: However, I'm pretty sure that the problem here was the jury just not understanding because the jury says well This person had porn on the screen.

235
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:50,799
Scott: Kids saw it the person was using the computer.

236
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:54,540
Scott: Yeah, that they don't understand anything more than that.

237
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:57,560
Rym: Yeah, I mean seriously what if the same situation happened?

238
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:04,080
Rym: But it was some kid in the local high school who hacked in and used some sort of screen control thing and popped up a boob.

239
00:15:05,582 --> 00:15:07,388
Rym: Now what it was on the screen.

240
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:10,560
Rym: send him to jail mark him as a sex offender then cut off his ball.

241
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,407
Scott: All right high school kids This is what you got to do.

242
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:15,587
Scott: if you got a teacher you don't like Right go and like.

243
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:17,977
Scott: use their computer and install VNC server on it.

244
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:25,680
Rym: Oh Scott Do you know how many times in my high school someone would make pornography suddenly appear at a whole bunch of pieces?

245
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:31,092
Scott: then Go and connect to that computer and how many of those times I was involved.

246
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:49,162
Scott: open up the most porn you can possibly find like make a website that opens up like automatically with pop-ups a bunch of other porn sites and Then make your teachers go to it while you're looking alright while someone else is looking like you gotta have a tag team where your friend is sitting with the teacher and you Connect to the computer.

247
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:52,329
Scott: make the porn open up and then the kids gotta be like, huh?

248
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,164
Scott: Why are you looking at porn?

249
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:58,200
Scott: OMG and then have that kid report the teacher and you can get rid of the teacher?

250
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:02,139
Rym: Yeah, I'm really glad that our legal system allows this to happen.

251
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:05,431
Rym: Yeah, I'm real glad that this is an option to me.

252
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:06,454
Scott: another thing.

253
00:16:06,474 --> 00:16:18,980
Scott: I just want to point out really quickly This is yet another reason on the heaping pile that No public education system should be permitted to use non free open source software, etc.

254
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,825
Rym: Yeah, this couldn't happen in Linux.

255
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:25,379
Scott: if it was a Linux machine, which would have saved the school system a lot of money.

256
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:27,792
Scott: Then kids wouldn't be able to look at porn.

257
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:29,200
Scott: teachers wouldn't be able to look at porn.

258
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,106
Scott: There'd be no proprietary software.

259
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:33,735
Scott: So the content filtering license could not have expired.

260
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:35,260
Scott: There would be no spyware.

261
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:37,552
Scott: No one could have even done this by accident.

262
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:39,200
Scott: it there would be no question.

263
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:46,565
Rym: yeah, it'd be obvious that the teacher had to have done it on purpose at that point or someone had hacked in and Extraordinarily set them up.

264
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:51,835
Scott: Yep, if I ever have kids and send them to school, you know how I could tell the good schools They'll be running the edge.

265
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,139
Scott: Ubuntu.

266
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,913
Scott: I don't think Ubuntu Ubuntu.

267
00:16:57,121 --> 00:17:01,014
Scott: How do you say edu boondoo edu boondoo edu boondoo?

268
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:01,576
Rym: I don't know.

269
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:04,306
Rym: I kind of like edu boondoo Yeah, but it's education.

270
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:05,632
Scott: So it should be edu boondoo.

271
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:07,640
Rym: It could be yeah, I don't know.

272
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,271
Rym: I like saying boondoo anything before.

273
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:09,954
Rym: that is fine.

274
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:20,519
Rym: Ah zoo boondoo Things of the day.

275
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:27,163
Rym: So we've linked to various owned videos over the year and change Can ever get it.

276
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:35,477
Rym: didn't we blink to the owned compilation at one point that we did and that was every decent owned video We've ever seen like we decided at that point that we never needed to link to one again.

277
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:36,040
Rym: That was it.

278
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,073
Rym: That was the most owned you could ever see without I don't know crying or killing yourself.

279
00:17:40,856 --> 00:17:42,000
Scott: I'm surprised I'm still here.

280
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,600
Rym: So then we were joking about because we saw this video a while ago of a guy.

281
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:56,760
Rym: It looked like an owned video like this guy was gonna get creamed by a car and there's some crazy miracle Totally survives with out of scratch like he's just fine.

282
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:07,817
Rym: and Then you know one time we saw this video of this kid on a skateboard and he's he's about to get hit by a bus And he totally pulls it off and doesn't die and he's just fine and he has his look on his face of oh shit.

283
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:08,519
Rym: Whoa.

284
00:18:09,582 --> 00:18:18,639
Rym: So we joked about hey wouldn't it be great if someone made an anti owned video of a bunch of people who almost get owned but totally get away with It and everything's just happy and awesome.

285
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:19,919
Rym: Someone made that.

286
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,288
Scott: They did and I like how.

287
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:28,880
Scott: I've seen some of these videos before but not all of them But I'd like to point out that half of them involve world rally cars.

288
00:18:29,403 --> 00:18:38,800
Rym: Yeah, a little note if you're ever at a world rally I know it's cool to stand in the corner right in front of where the cars come right where the cars will crash.

289
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,060
Scott: Well, I mean, it's not really if you're at a rally race.

290
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,540
Scott: I mean these cars are driving down a hill usually and it's all windy roads.

291
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,806
Scott: So it's not like a racetrack.

292
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,660
Scott: There's a circle where you can sit and the cars keep coming by.

293
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:56,900
Rym: It's like initial D. You got to stand at the corner like the critical corner and you look down the hill as the cars come right at you.

294
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:04,200
Scott: Then you get out of the way and the cars you watch the car go around the corner and then you chase the car down The other side as it goes away.

295
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:05,066
Rym: There's no safety.

296
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:09,666
Rym: like some people are smart and they stay back a bit but a lot of people just stand like right there.

297
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:17,046
Scott: a lot of you will run out into the road that they get out of Maximum time watching the car.

298
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:19,233
Rym: These people are colloquially referred to as idiots.

299
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:23,192
Scott: They are indeed see an initial D. There's much better to watch the rally on television.

300
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,459
Rym: Yeah, or just watch initial D.

301
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,210
Scott: No, just watch initial D. I mean, there's play initial D.

302
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,840
Rym: There's no the initial D arc or to drive in the rally.

303
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,884
Scott: That's really the best way.

304
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:33,274
Rym: We got to talk about the initial D arcade game someday.

305
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:34,538
Rym: Okay, cuz that was okay.

306
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:45,973
Rym: Anyway, so all these people totally don't get owned and it's really amazing cuz every time you think wow That guy's about to die and then something crazy happens and he's totally okay.

307
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:51,699
Scott: It's a anti snuff videos the noss noss funds.

308
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:55,015
Rym: Well, they call it luck people.

309
00:19:55,357 --> 00:20:01,732
Scott: Yeah Look like look like look like owned.

310
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:03,578
Rym: talk like not owned.

311
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:04,159
Scott: All right.

312
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:11,460
Scott: So I'm pretty sure most people who would listen to GeekNights are aware of the concept of hot linking.

313
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:15,454
Scott: But because I'm not a hundred percent sure that everyone is aware.

314
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:17,160
Scott: I'm going to explain it to you very quickly.

315
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,226
Scott: Let's do Dave and Joel style.

316
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:18,990
Rym: Do a little roleplay.

317
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:20,660
Rym: I'll be the webmaster and you be the punk kid.

318
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,262
Scott: Well, no, no.

319
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:22,807
Scott: Okay, so what?

320
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:24,231
Scott: I'm just gonna explain it.

321
00:20:24,352 --> 00:20:24,933
Scott: Okay.

322
00:20:24,953 --> 00:20:25,114
Scott: Okay.

323
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:26,137
Scott: You got a web page.

324
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:28,707
Scott: Don't want to larp it And you end.

325
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:43,117
Scott: when you go to a web page It sends you some HTMLs and in those HTMLs are some lines that say hey go get this picture Get this gift from that website and get this JPEG from that website and then it will get those JPEG.

326
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:44,461
Scott: your web browser will see That.

327
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:51,440
Scott: get the JPEGs and the gifts and maybe the ping pictures grab them from those other websites and then load them on the page.

328
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:58,780
Scott: Now usually what you do is you put your HTMLs on your web server and you put your pictures on your web server.

329
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:08,220
Scott: Then you know everything that when someone visits your website Everything they need to see comes from your web server with the bandwidth that you are paying for.

330
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:14,800
Rym: Now some people do things like you'll have a website and say you have really really high content like crazy images.

331
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:18,051
Rym: Maybe you'll have all the images hosted on another server you own somewhere.

332
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:19,536
Rym: Mm-hmm stuff like that.

333
00:21:19,676 --> 00:21:20,800
Rym: Yeah, they can point anywhere.

334
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:25,374
Scott: Yep, so what happens is let's say I've got a website and on the website.

335
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:29,465
Scott: I've got a picture of Cute kitten.

336
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:30,309
Scott: a cute kitten.

337
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:33,162
Scott: someone else makes a website, you know They make.

338
00:21:33,303 --> 00:21:37,360
Scott: they just want to make a website and they decide that they want a picture of a cute kitten on their website.

339
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:47,438
Scott: Now what they should do is they should go to my website Get the picture of the cute kitten put it on their web server and then make a web page.

340
00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:49,163
Scott: that way They could.

341
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:55,960
Scott: there's no technological thing stopping them from just having the picture from my website load on their web page.

342
00:21:56,161 --> 00:22:07,180
Scott: So whenever anyone visits their web page on their web server That person ends up downloading a picture from my website using my bandwidth and that's generally not cool.

343
00:22:07,884 --> 00:22:20,142
Scott: Now there are a lot of stories on the web this week about people who would do the thing that most people do and that's if someone tries to Hotlink an image from your web server Which they shouldn't do.

344
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:27,503
Scott: you replace it with goatse or porn or something that says pun diamond thief bla bla bla bla bla Etc.

345
00:22:27,826 --> 00:22:29,620
Scott: to make those people look bad because you know.

346
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,120
Scott: So let's say someone links to your picture of a cute kitten on their website.

347
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:34,714
Scott: Then they go and look at their website and all of a sudden.

348
00:22:34,734 --> 00:22:36,937
Scott: Oh, it's goatse awesome.

349
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:49,970
Scott: Now my thing of the day is a screenshot of a gmail of A guy and let me read just a little bit of this Hello, I must say I'm quite upset.

350
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:52,620
Scott: Oh, by the way, the punctuation and spelling and grammar is horrendous.

351
00:22:53,661 --> 00:23:00,080
Scott: I have been using images from your website on my website for a long time now and suddenly they are gone and I am concerned.

352
00:23:00,584 --> 00:23:05,880
Scott: I am using my website to build up my business Which is not easy and you change the location or deleted them or something.

353
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:19,159
Scott: My concern is that if you do not upload the images again I might have to contact my lawyer as I am using these images for the purposes of advertising And this sudden change without warning means I have to find where you have moved them to and get them working again.

354
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,285
Scott: Would you do such a thing?

355
00:23:21,305 --> 00:23:25,240
Scott: I am an honest businessman and small business like mine never get respect.

356
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,031
Scott: I hope you realize it took me a long time to find images.

357
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:28,734
Scott: I liked now.

358
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,140
Scott: I have to find your images again.

359
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:31,966
Scott: Please put them back right away.

360
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:34,676
Scott: I don't think you want me to call my lawyer about this.

361
00:23:35,098 --> 00:23:35,640
Scott: Please contact.

362
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:36,730
Scott: I just read the whole email.

363
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,060
Rym: Oh, well, all right I think it's safe to assume and correct me if I'm wrong.

364
00:23:42,261 --> 00:23:49,071
Rym: I don't know if this is an ordinary claim or an extraordinary claim But I don't think that kid has ever even seen a lawyer.

365
00:23:49,492 --> 00:23:51,920
Rym: No, no, let alone has a phone number.

366
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:52,966
Scott: I don't think it's a kid.

367
00:23:53,086 --> 00:23:54,393
Scott: I think this is actually.

368
00:23:54,574 --> 00:24:03,131
Scott: if this email is real Oh, no it's probably like some 40 year old guy with it's probably like some small business owner who doesn't know shit about technology.

369
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:09,576
Scott: and You know, I mean if people in this world are illiterate like they can't read or bright.

370
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:12,686
Scott: We don't give them jobs They don't run businesses.

371
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:16,098
Scott: They're basically like second-class citizens, but they did it to themselves.

372
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:16,680
Scott: So it's fair.

373
00:24:17,062 --> 00:24:18,916
Scott: I mean, you can't do much if you can't read or write.

374
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:20,367
Rym: Yeah, I mean I'm gonna hire someone.

375
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:21,294
Rym: I don't care how cool they are.

376
00:24:21,314 --> 00:24:23,286
Rym: if they can't read There's no job.

377
00:24:23,326 --> 00:24:26,180
Rym: I could have them do other than possibly cleaning the bathroom, right?

378
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:29,279
Scott: So it's come to know couldn't read the cleaner instructions.

379
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:37,730
Scott: It's come to the point where technological literacy is just as important as plain old Reading and writing literacy.

380
00:24:37,871 --> 00:24:45,930
Scott: if you don't know how to use computers If you don't if you're so stupid that you would write this email You are no better than someone who cannot read or write.

381
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,979
Scott: as far as I am concerned in this modern society.

382
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,681
Rym: now It's not quite at that point yet I don't get

383
00:24:51,701 --> 00:24:52,484
Scott: in there give

384
00:24:52,524 --> 00:25:07,250
Rym: I mean in ten years someone who can't use a computer or doesn't understand at least the bare bare basics of basic basic basic basic simple internet concepts and computer concepts is Not gonna get very far in anything.

385
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:12,167
Rym: no and the problem is well, I mean even now I couldn't imagine I wouldn't hire someone for anything.

386
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:12,468
Rym: I did.

387
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:13,834
Rym: who couldn't use a computer.

388
00:25:13,854 --> 00:25:14,457
Rym: Nope.

389
00:25:14,658 --> 00:25:18,228
Rym: Not at all Because I also wouldn't hire anyone who couldn't type properly.

390
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:19,231
Scott: That's also true.

391
00:25:19,913 --> 00:25:28,483
Scott: Yeah, if someone sent me something with this grammar and spelling There's no way they'd be hired ever even for like the lowliest job like crap secretary No way.

392
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:32,777
Rym: Well, especially secretary since their primary job is to write things for you.

393
00:25:32,937 --> 00:25:33,479
Scott: I know I know.

394
00:25:35,081 --> 00:25:36,790
Scott: Anyway, this is just hilarious.

395
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:38,560
Rym: That's what if their job was to make typos?

396
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,480
Rym: What if you were hiring them to write poorly and you needed that poor writing output as fast as possible?

397
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,819
Scott: Then I would know to go and hire this guy.

398
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:50,039
Scott: He looks like he could use a job because there's no way his small business is doing very well.

399
00:25:50,581 --> 00:26:00,271
Rym: So I'm kind of excited about what we're gonna do in a moment on the show Really, and I believe I'll let Scott Introduce it because he's the one who gay came up with the thing.

400
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:02,500
Rym: What were your how the way we are going to handle this?

401
00:26:02,884 --> 00:26:09,200
Scott: Alright well We were gonna do first, you know, we were thinking everyone wants the zombie episode.

402
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,369
Scott: But no, we're not gonna do the zombie episode.

403
00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:13,760
Rym: You'll get the kids on the episode when you least expect it.

404
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,693
Scott: Yes, someone else made a suggestion that we should do like what if we had a time machine?

405
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:19,880
Rym: Well, that's the crab people idea.

406
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,334
Scott: Yeah, that's the crab people idea.

407
00:26:21,354 --> 00:26:21,980
Scott: I was like, huh?

408
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:26,139
Scott: I don't know if we want to talk about what if we had a time machine, but what if?

409
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,649
Scott: Yeah, but what if that's?

410
00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:30,713
Scott: that's pretty popular.

411
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:33,985
Scott: Nothing gets geekier than going what if I mean remember all those x-men.

412
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:34,809
Rym: what if comics like?

413
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:36,756
Rym: what if the x-men were all vampires?

414
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:37,399
Scott: Yeah.

415
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:38,464
Scott: Yeah Well, it was Marvel.

416
00:26:38,504 --> 00:26:39,832
Scott: What if actually whatever like?

417
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:41,138
Scott: what if spider-man was gay?

418
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:45,050
Scott: No, no, he just makes you gay with his dance.

419
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:46,213
Rym: Yeah, he's not gay.

420
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:47,698
Rym: He just dances in a gay gay way.

421
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:48,120
Scott: That's right.

422
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,413
Scott: So, you know, I was thinking about that for a while.

423
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:51,936
Scott: I was like, huh?

424
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:52,338
Scott: What if?

425
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:52,700
Scott: what?

426
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,990
Scott: What if we had a million dollars?

427
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,160
Scott: No, it's not such a good episode.

428
00:26:55,462 --> 00:26:58,640
Rym: What if there was a draft and then no one wants to hear our plans to go to Canada?

429
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:00,930
Scott: I thought of the geekiest nerdiest thing ever.

430
00:27:01,091 --> 00:27:03,039
Scott: What do all geeks and nerds always discuss?

431
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,179
Rym: Goku could totally beat up the Hulk.

432
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:09,809
Scott: Yeah, what if so-and-so fought so-and-so?

433
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:12,556
Scott: and then I remembered something else.

434
00:27:13,238 --> 00:27:21,057
Scott: in some forums I frequent they have Thunderdome where what they do is they pick someone and then they say, all right, we're gonna have.

435
00:27:21,078 --> 00:27:27,613
Scott: you know I don't know the Hulk fight Optimus Prime Optimus Prime's good.

436
00:27:27,694 --> 00:27:35,300
Scott: Yeah, totally wins But yeah, and then they go, okay and everyone votes and whoever wins stays in and the other person is out.

437
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:36,526
Scott: it's Thunderdome.

438
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,457
Scott: one man enters one man leaves.

439
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:41,832
Scott: so as Thursday is random geek talk.

440
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:46,893
Scott: There's nothing geekier than Doing Thunderdome and I think it's gonna entertain you.

441
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,560
Scott: it's gonna be a lot of fan service.

442
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:51,532
Rym: So I drew the short straw meaning I get to pick.

443
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:53,420
Scott: the first person said you wanted to go first.

444
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,293
Scott: You didn't draw a short straw in my head.

445
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:56,240
Rym: I drew the short straw.

446
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,379
Rym: There was only one straw and it was already in my hand.

447
00:27:58,501 --> 00:27:58,840
Scott: All right.

448
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:16,185
Scott: So Rym is gonna pick someone and then I'm going to pick an opponent and we will then discuss and agree Eventually agree upon who would win in a fight with no weapons in a Coliseum that they cannot leave and also no hazards or traps and Yeah or items.

449
00:28:16,305 --> 00:28:20,296
Rym: In fact, we'll assume that it occurs in effectively like a football stadium.

450
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:20,757
Scott: Yes.

451
00:28:20,858 --> 00:28:21,760
Scott: It's a football stadium.

452
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,827
Scott: There's grass and dirt.

453
00:28:22,888 --> 00:28:27,651
Rym: There's a force field so you can't leave it But it scales to be as big as whoever needs to be there.

454
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:34,829
Scott: There are no items or weapons and There's sunlight because I know that affects some people.

455
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:35,271
Rym: Yep.

456
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:36,194
Rym: It's earth.

457
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:37,599
Rym: It's not a yellow Sun.

458
00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:40,974
Scott: What else what else could possibly affect the deal?

459
00:28:40,994 --> 00:28:44,171
Rym: Ah Gravity's normal airs normal standard earth.

460
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:45,959
Scott: You can't run out of air.

461
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,640
Scott: You Don't get any tools unless they're like part of you.

462
00:28:50,761 --> 00:29:00,307
Scott: so for example Lion-o would have the sword of thunder and panthro would have his nunchucks and optimus prime would have a laser gun But spike spiegel wouldn't just have a gun.

463
00:29:00,748 --> 00:29:00,949
Scott: No.

464
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:05,446
Scott: No, he wouldn't because that's not part of spike spiegel, but Lupin would have a gun.

465
00:29:05,566 --> 00:29:09,319
Scott: Yes, and so would James Bond would have a Walter PPK or even G.

466
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:11,066
Rym: again Who would have possibly the same gun?

467
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:14,680
Scott: Yes, and you know go among would have his sword, but you couldn't be like.

468
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:17,593
Scott: Oh, well going on could go get an anti-tank rifle.

469
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,040
Scott: No, he couldn't he only has that sword.

470
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,399
Rym: No, the only other thing we have to bring up is that sometimes people playing this game suck at it.

471
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:31,663
Rym: You see I'm going first so I can't be like the Hulk Juggernaut God Galactus yet.

472
00:29:31,924 --> 00:29:37,220
Scott: See the thing is if we just tried to win that's no fun because I just be like, oh, I don't know.

473
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,748
Rym: Yeah, it's a lot more like hunkbag.

474
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:40,960
Rym: You're trying to make it last as long as possible, right?

475
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,299
Scott: So to make this more entertaining we got to start small.

476
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:48,900
Scott: So I decide I've been keeping a secret what he's gonna start with but he thinks it's a really great idea.

477
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:50,548
Rym: I think it's a great place to start.

478
00:29:50,608 --> 00:29:53,120
Rym: It's a good starting point cuz it's someone that I could beat up.

479
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:53,884
Scott: All right.

480
00:29:54,046 --> 00:29:59,086
Rym: All right, so glass Joe From Mike Tyson's punch-out.

481
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:00,691
Scott: You're gonna pick glass Joe.

482
00:30:00,752 --> 00:30:01,775
Rym: I'm going to glass Joe.

483
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:02,457
Rym: He's my man.

484
00:30:02,577 --> 00:30:04,003
Scott: You're going with glass Joe You know what?

485
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:07,100
Scott: I could say little Mac because that would just be I win.

486
00:30:07,521 --> 00:30:10,189
Rym: Yeah, you could also say the Kaiser and you would just win.

487
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,835
Scott: but I'm gonna pick something funnier.

488
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:14,584
Scott: Oh Gabby Jay Gabby Jay.

489
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:19,259
Scott: Gabby Jay beat glass Joe in one fight one time.

490
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:22,348
Scott: Therefore Gabby Jay is the winner.

491
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:23,451
Rym: the fight already happened.

492
00:30:23,993 --> 00:30:26,600
Scott: Plus Gabby Jay is like a few years younger than glass Joe.

493
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:27,950
Scott: I think all right.

494
00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:30,224
Scott: Mm-hmm That ends that one.

495
00:30:30,525 --> 00:30:32,092
Scott: All right, he's gonna fight Gabby Jay.

496
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:33,819
Rym: see now I'm on this trend.

497
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,020
Rym: now I keep going with boxers or something, but no I got to do something different from that.

498
00:30:37,723 --> 00:30:39,188
Rym: I'm gonna have to go with Mario.

499
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,056
Scott: Mario Mario vs.

500
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:41,578
Scott: Gabby Jay.

501
00:30:41,598 --> 00:30:42,020
Scott: That's tough.

502
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,493
Scott: Yeah, cuz because I was pretty tired, you know Mario can't get any items.

503
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,422
Scott: So if you just said Mario didn't say Super Mario Oh shit.

504
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:50,445
Rym: No, therefore.

505
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:55,160
Scott: It must be the Mario from the original Mario Brothers and not Super Mario Brothers.

506
00:30:55,722 --> 00:30:56,707
Scott: All he can do he can't.

507
00:30:56,727 --> 00:30:57,390
Scott: there's no items.

508
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,273
Scott: He can't hit the POW.

509
00:30:58,796 --> 00:30:59,720
Scott: All he can do is jump.

510
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:05,078
Scott: He can hit Gabby Jay from under maybe but how's he gonna get under the boxing ring and hit him from under.

511
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,544
Rym: see here's What he might be able to do.

512
00:31:06,805 --> 00:31:07,849
Rym: he runs up to him.

513
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:12,224
Rym: Gabby Jay has trouble punching him because he's so freakin tiny It's true.

514
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,460
Scott: It's pretty inaccurate with his punches.

515
00:31:14,681 --> 00:31:16,854
Scott: And then he John the only one worse than him is glass Joe.

516
00:31:17,196 --> 00:31:21,679
Rym: and then he jumps Straight up and hits him in the chin with that brick breaking head of his.

517
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:27,660
Scott: Yeah, the thing is that'll kill you in the original Mario Brothers if you touch the other opponent with your head.

518
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:28,924
Scott: Yeah, they hit him from under.

519
00:31:28,984 --> 00:31:30,188
Rym: it might be a double suicide.

520
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,356
Scott: I think I don't know.

521
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:33,279
Scott: It's this tough call.

522
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:36,513
Scott: here I'm leaning a little bit towards Gabby Jay.

523
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:37,980
Rym: Yeah, I think Mario is gonna die.

524
00:31:38,222 --> 00:31:39,980
Scott: So you're gonna have to come back with Super Mario.

525
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:45,160
Rym: I'm gonna let him die and come back with Super Mario from Super Mario Brothers one with a fire flower power.

526
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:49,172
Rym: Well, so he just stands at the other fireballs at Gabby Jane.

527
00:31:49,192 --> 00:31:49,834
Scott: He has no chance.

528
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:50,979
Rym: Gabby Jay turns into.

529
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:51,770
Rym: I don't know Goomba.

530
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:53,063
Rym: Alright, I can white.

531
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:57,879
Scott: so Gabby Jay is down because he got hit with the fireballs and I caught Rym on a technicality.

532
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,528
Scott: one point Yeah one point for Scotty Scott.

533
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:04,000
Scott: so I could pick someone else in the Mario universe like Koopa.

534
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,660
Scott: But no one could beat Mario with firepower because firepower beats everything.

535
00:32:09,284 --> 00:32:11,151
Rym: Well, except the hammer suit, huh?

536
00:32:11,191 --> 00:32:11,793
Scott: So, let's see.

537
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:13,700
Scott: Let's say we're gonna stick with the video game.

538
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,525
Rym: Yeah, cuz I can jump.

539
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:16,095
Rym: I can break bricks with my head.

540
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:16,920
Rym: My head's real strong.

541
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:19,440
Scott: Yeah, I gotta pick something harder than bricks.

542
00:32:20,821 --> 00:32:22,078
Rym: Nothing's harder than bricks.

543
00:32:22,946 --> 00:32:24,318
Scott: Who can withstand fire?

544
00:32:25,881 --> 00:32:29,740
Scott: Aha I will pick fireman from Megaman one.

545
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:37,274
Scott: it's a tough call because Freaking Mario gets punned by fire and fireman is pretty much immune to fire.

546
00:32:37,294 --> 00:32:38,899
Scott: You just got fire coming out of his head.

547
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:42,408
Scott: Mario tries to jump on fireman.

548
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:43,492
Scott: He'll burn his feet.

549
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:45,057
Scott: You can't beat fireman.

550
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:46,966
Scott: He's a robot Alright, what is he gonna do?

551
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,475
Scott: shoot fireballs at him jump on him?

552
00:32:48,495 --> 00:32:49,200
Scott: There's no bricks.

553
00:32:49,904 --> 00:32:52,058
Scott: What can Mario do against fireman from Megaman one?

554
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:54,460
Rym: Well, he keeps shooting fireballs at him.

555
00:32:54,460 --> 00:33:01,502
Scott: Hopefully he'll eventually get too hot and I know it does so little damage and you need to hit fireman so many times like 50 Times.

556
00:33:01,884 --> 00:33:03,912
Scott: fireman would only need to hit Mario two times.

557
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:07,108
Scott: fireman shoots a lot of fire But fireman is not that mobile.

558
00:33:07,148 --> 00:33:09,240
Rym: He's used to working in a really jumps all around.

559
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:12,500
Rym: Yeah, he's used to working in a really small room with a bunch of walls right there.

560
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,006
Rym: What's he gonna do in an open field?

561
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:17,620
Scott: What's Mario gonna do an open field when there's fire being shot all over the place?

562
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,303
Scott: He can't dodge.

563
00:33:18,323 --> 00:33:19,388
Scott: He can't jump very high.

564
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:20,293
Rym: He can jump.

565
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,720
Scott: is that the mobility of Megaman?

566
00:33:22,141 --> 00:33:24,188
Rym: He can just more mobility than Megaman.

567
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,760
Rym: Mario can jump higher faster further with greater effects.

568
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,531
Scott: But the thing is even Megaman fighting against fireman.

569
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:32,700
Scott: First of all, he's Megaman has better weaponry.

570
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,800
Scott: He's got like bubble shots and whatever water guns he needs.

571
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,739
Scott: I see he's got Iceman's weapon in Megaman one right to help him beat fireman not true?

572
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,210
Scott: and Megaman also can take a lot more than two hits.

573
00:33:43,351 --> 00:33:48,252
Scott: and you will take two hits fighting fireman And it only takes two hits to take Mario out.

574
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:48,774
Scott: That's right.

575
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:50,320
Rym: I think Mario would lose that fight.

576
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,004
Scott: I think he would.

577
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:52,894
Scott: he would need a star then he could win.

578
00:33:53,337 --> 00:33:56,392
Rym: All right Oh, well in that case since I'm looking at it right here.

579
00:33:56,412 --> 00:33:57,819
Rym: I'm gonna jump a bit.

580
00:33:58,243 --> 00:34:00,058
Rym: I have to jump a bit to make this awesome.

581
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:06,820
Rym: Edward Alaric from Fullmetal Alchemist would totally kick fireman's ass into the ground without a second thought.

582
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:10,812
Scott: Somehow I think that's true because he would just Trent Trent.

583
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:13,161
Scott: I mean fireman's not a human He's a robot.

584
00:34:13,362 --> 00:34:17,516
Scott: so you could totally just use the alchemy on fireman and just discombobulate him and it's over.

585
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:19,264
Rym: or you could just surround Him in an ice cube.

586
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:22,620
Scott: he could drop a rock on him surround transmute some water into ice.

587
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:23,063
Scott: You know what?

588
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:23,610
Rym: I would do know.

589
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,277
Rym: here's what he's gonna do.

590
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:29,659
Rym: He's gonna stand at the far end of the football field transmuting dirt into Megaman pellets and throwing them.

591
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,552
Scott: But Megaman pellets are made of energy not dirt.

592
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:33,295
Scott: It's tough.

593
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:39,397
Rym: Um, he turns Plasma with his alchemy and people from World War one, I guess.

594
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:40,060
Scott: okay.

595
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,359
Scott: So who can beat Edward?

596
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,587
Scott: Eric I might have to try a few that can't beat him cuz he's pretty powerful and I don't just want to jump way up To someone I know can beat him guaranteed.

597
00:34:49,628 --> 00:34:51,134
Rym: Plus I got a fetish sitting right here.

598
00:34:51,194 --> 00:34:53,543
Rym: I got a little Edward Alaric Holding him.

599
00:34:53,563 --> 00:34:55,188
Rym: He's got his little knife thing.

600
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:58,040
Rym: Let and his hair is kind of discolored to turn green.

601
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:04,069
Scott: I don't know why do I want I could go back to video games But I think I'm gonna try something else.

602
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,593
Rym: We got to hurry this up.

603
00:35:05,634 --> 00:35:06,797
Scott: We do have to hurry this up.

604
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,989
Scott: All right M bison.

605
00:35:09,798 --> 00:35:11,449
Rym: Oh Now this one will take some debate.

606
00:35:11,529 --> 00:35:12,857
Scott: This one will take some debate.

607
00:35:12,937 --> 00:35:19,300
Rym: on one hand We have M bison a train fighter with the cheapest freaking move in any fighting game ever.

608
00:35:19,862 --> 00:35:34,420
Scott: Yeah, I mean even if Elric can do some transmuting right and he can do it pretty fast So that I'm having to draw symbols and whatever M-bison can just get like Psychokinetic energy out of nowhere all the time and fly back and forth real fast before Ed has even a chance to do anything.

609
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,584
Rym: No, I mean watch the anime.

610
00:35:35,744 --> 00:35:40,980
Rym: Ed can totally just transmute things like that without a second thought doesn't need circles or anything.

611
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:42,164
Scott: Yeah, but think about this.

612
00:35:42,204 --> 00:35:44,051
Scott: remember in Street Fighter 2 the bonus stage.

613
00:35:44,412 --> 00:35:49,055
Scott: if it's even if it's a big metal car M Bison can punch the car into smithereens.

614
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:49,759
Scott: What's he gonna do?

615
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,722
Rym: You know what?

616
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:54,399
Rym: Ed could also punch the car into smithereens with a giant rock fist.

617
00:35:56,082 --> 00:35:56,905
Scott: It's a tough call.

618
00:35:56,966 --> 00:36:03,280
Scott: and also you've got two equal fighters roughly I said one of them with alchemy powers and one with psychokinetic powers.

619
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,600
Rym: I submit to you that M bison is no more tough than King Bradley.

620
00:36:07,521 --> 00:36:10,220
Rym: In fact, I think they fight in a very similar fashion.

621
00:36:10,821 --> 00:36:15,995
Scott: I do think they do as well because they're very similar as swords which are which give.

622
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:19,164
Scott: actually King Bradley would have an advantage over M bison with his swords.

623
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:24,120
Rym: Yeah, but then again M bison has his cheap cheap cheap moves.

624
00:36:25,703 --> 00:36:26,145
Scott: Well, you know what?

625
00:36:26,165 --> 00:36:27,409
Scott: Let's look at it this way right?

626
00:36:27,871 --> 00:36:29,075
Scott: can Ed beat Al?

627
00:36:29,216 --> 00:36:34,194
Scott: we got to use a third Like, you know, you got to make a triangle when you have a trot problem like.

628
00:36:34,314 --> 00:36:35,860
Rym: I don't think Ed now can beat each other.

629
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,508
Rym: I think they fight to a dead standstill when they actually fight.

630
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,756
Scott: Well could M bison beat out.

631
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:41,899
Rym: I don't know.

632
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:43,163
Rym: see, he might be.

633
00:36:43,223 --> 00:36:48,339
Scott: I don't think he could because M bison can only like really hurt you if you're a squishy human.

634
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:52,016
Scott: if you Tried to just you know, I mean he could punch a car to smithereens.

635
00:36:52,398 --> 00:36:52,800
Rym: Are you kidding?

636
00:36:53,822 --> 00:36:55,271
Rym: I was armor breaks all the time.

637
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:56,660
Rym: Yeah, maybe right through it.

638
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,200
Scott: So maybe M bison could beat out pretty easily.

639
00:36:59,381 --> 00:37:04,600
Rym: But I think that's only because Al is kind of weak against straight-up physical attacks of that nature.

640
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,100
Rym: Meanwhile Ed is just super badass.

641
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:12,295
Rym: I mean look at how many people's asses he kicks throughout that show not even counting the movie.

642
00:37:12,978 --> 00:37:15,388
Rym: Yeah How many amuncula does he fight?

643
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:16,693
Rym: I don't think M bison can beat him.

644
00:37:17,316 --> 00:37:29,360
Scott: plus when you're actually, you know I think I'm gonna have to concede that M bison would lose because if you look at some other guys in the street fighter people That would definitely lose to Ed like I don't know Chun Li God or Dal seen Honda.

645
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:37,179
Scott: those people can beat M bison if They're up to par because you could beat M bison in Street Fighter 2 with any of the characters if you're good enough.

646
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,622
Scott: and So yeah.

647
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,128
Scott: All right, so L would be.

648
00:37:40,288 --> 00:37:41,753
Scott: I mean Ed would beat M bison.

649
00:37:42,195 --> 00:37:42,737
Rym: Yes, he would.

650
00:37:42,998 --> 00:37:44,022
Rym: Oh hands down All right.

651
00:37:44,123 --> 00:37:46,277
Scott: Let's go back go back a bit.

652
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:52,265
Rym: Okay, I think Edward Elric is a consummate badass and unless you move into giant robot territory I think you're gonna have some trouble here.

653
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:55,020
Scott: All right, I'm gonna try one more outside of giant robot territory.

654
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,914
Scott: All right, and it go for light with his death note.

655
00:37:58,954 --> 00:38:03,253
Scott: He'll just write down Ed's name the end Whoo, but do they know who they're fighting?

656
00:38:03,294 --> 00:38:04,240
Rym: Does he know his name?

657
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,931
Scott: He's the famous full metal alchemist Edward Elric.

658
00:38:07,031 --> 00:38:08,016
Scott: Everyone knows who he is.

659
00:38:08,096 --> 00:38:09,020
Rym: We didn't set the parameters.

660
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,039
Scott: I mean, he doesn't know what he looked like.

661
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:15,960
Scott: But as soon as he sees him when they're in an arena, remember he would just see him right there.

662
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,422
Scott: He knows it.

663
00:38:16,442 --> 00:38:20,418
Scott: He looks like he knows who it is writes him down a little book game over.

664
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,174
Rym: Yeah Here's the problem though We didn't set.

665
00:38:23,236 --> 00:38:28,100
Rym: I mean What if these people are just transported suddenly into the arena to fight and they don't know who they're gonna fight.

666
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:30,754
Rym: So it comes down to if he knows his name or not.

667
00:38:30,795 --> 00:38:34,120
Rym: if light knows his name It's over because Ed can't react fast enough.

668
00:38:34,461 --> 00:38:36,510
Rym: But if he doesn't know his name, he dicked.

669
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:41,968
Scott: unless he trades the eyes with ryuk Okay, so he's not gonna trade the eyes.

670
00:38:42,008 --> 00:38:42,530
Scott: We know that.

671
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:50,598
Scott: Yeah, so the only question here right is is light smart enough to trick Ed into telling him his name?

672
00:38:50,618 --> 00:38:54,110
Scott: and Ed Ed is even cautious about that.

673
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:56,120
Scott: He doesn't know death notes or anything, right?

674
00:38:56,421 --> 00:39:01,960
Rym: Alright, I have to concede now because here's exactly what would happen light to be standing there Ed to be standing there.

675
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:08,440
Rym: It doesn't just attack people with a sucker punch and they always talk in the anime like well blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

676
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:14,140
Rym: And light, you know that motherfucker likes to talk and tell everyone to keep a plan before he enacts it.

677
00:39:14,943 --> 00:39:17,994
Rym: So they'll be standing there and light will be smart.

678
00:39:18,034 --> 00:39:24,020
Rym: He'll realize doesn't know this guy's name But while they're having their banter, he'll probably notice that this guy's short.

679
00:39:24,301 --> 00:39:29,379
Rym: He'll probably determine that a lot of his attitude comes from the fact that he's short and he's mad about it.

680
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,799
Rym: Mmm, that is a sore point for him.

681
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:36,916
Rym: so he'll say something dismissive like who's this pint-sized piece of shit?

682
00:39:37,398 --> 00:39:43,699
Rym: and then Ed Will in classic fashion say who are you calling a bitch size bean blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

683
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,100
Rym: I'm Edward.

684
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:45,286
Rym: I work the full-metal alchemist.

685
00:39:45,346 --> 00:39:49,029
Rym: I'm gonna beat your ass into the ground and while he's going on his tirade He'll just write his name down.

686
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:50,441
Scott: Yeah game over All right.

687
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:53,051
Scott: So now I'm gonna give you a hint on how to beat light.

688
00:39:53,532 --> 00:40:01,940
Scott: you need someone either Who is concealed such as being in a giant robot or something like that or someone with a secret identity?

689
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,205
Scott: Or else you're gonna have no chance.

690
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,222
Rym: Well, see I got two candidates here and one of them is clever and one of them is Cool.

691
00:40:07,242 --> 00:40:07,725
Rym: All right.

692
00:40:07,785 --> 00:40:09,093
Rym: I'm not gonna use either one yet.

693
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:13,069
Rym: I'm just gonna say that Roshach from the Watchmen.

694
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,100
Scott: Ooh, that is an excellent choice.

695
00:40:15,501 --> 00:40:23,207
Rym: Rajag would just walk over and snap at a light's neck without even thinking that is true and Light wouldn't know who he was.

696
00:40:23,528 --> 00:40:25,675
Scott: Roshank wouldn't Roshank?

697
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,726
Scott: whatever Roshak He wouldn't be able to do.

698
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:30,211
Scott: you know, you just beat him up.

699
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:31,978
Scott: light can't hold himself in a fight.

700
00:40:32,018 --> 00:40:42,920
Rym: very well that's all about the thinking and Look at the things that Roshak does in that comic Roshak could probably take like 40 bullets and be just fine.

701
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:49,948
Rym: Now my funny answer is Ryuk I'm not gonna talk about Elle cuz.

702
00:40:50,068 --> 00:40:50,711
Rym: we read the manga.

703
00:40:50,731 --> 00:40:52,480
Rym: we know exactly who would win that fight.

704
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:54,745
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, you know what?

705
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,050
Rym: I'm gonna go with Roshak cuz.

706
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,239
Rym: Roshak just walks over snaps his puny neck.

707
00:40:59,122 --> 00:40:59,845
Rym: That's the end of that.

708
00:41:00,106 --> 00:41:02,013
Rym: and now Roshak's got a fucking death note.

709
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:02,736
Scott: Yeah.

710
00:41:03,037 --> 00:41:03,820
Scott: Oh, no, it doesn't count.

711
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,845
Scott: I don't think he gets to keep it.

712
00:41:04,925 --> 00:41:05,206
Scott: Okay.

713
00:41:05,226 --> 00:41:06,552
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't work.

714
00:41:06,573 --> 00:41:07,276
Scott: bodies disappear.

715
00:41:07,316 --> 00:41:10,129
Scott: It's like do yeah He only gets the stuff that he comes with.

716
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:10,972
Rym: Well, no, I'm doing.

717
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:11,756
Rym: bodies didn't disappear.

718
00:41:11,776 --> 00:41:12,700
Rym: It's like early counter-strike.

719
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,698
Scott: No, the body the corpses are there, but all the items go away, you know, because no one has the.

720
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:19,126
Scott: you know They don't have inventories.

721
00:41:19,147 --> 00:41:20,880
Rym: We don't want to leave the corpses there because that won't end.

722
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,488
Scott: Well, not true true.

723
00:41:22,508 --> 00:41:24,860
Scott: Some people like are made of metal and that wouldn't work.

724
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,700
Rym: Well, yeah, or some people are swarms of things or some people are made out of poison.

725
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:36,071
Scott: alright, well Roshak's not gonna be too easy to get rid of because he's just a Man, and I just need someone stronger than he is.

726
00:41:36,272 --> 00:41:36,433
Scott: Yeah.

727
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:37,880
Scott: It's a pretty strong man, though.

728
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:44,361
Rym: Yeah, I mean the only person who really could fight him well on an even footing was I don't know Dr.

729
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,025
Rym: Manhattan.

730
00:41:45,366 --> 00:41:46,512
Scott: Yeah squishy.

731
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:47,880
Scott: We're not gonna go that big yet.

732
00:41:48,232 --> 00:41:49,645
Scott: Yeah I'm not gonna go that big yet.

733
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:53,037
Rym: or actually Ozzie Mandy is held off held him off in a fight.

734
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,047
Rym: memory tries to stab him With that fork and Ozzie man.

735
00:41:55,087 --> 00:41:56,013
Rym: He's just like punks him.

736
00:41:56,033 --> 00:42:00,689
Scott: Yeah All right, let's see who am I gonna pick?

737
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,254
Rym: Roshak's real strong.

738
00:42:02,274 --> 00:42:03,660
Rym: remember when he killed that guy in the prison.

739
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:05,886
Rym: He's locked in the room.

740
00:42:05,946 --> 00:42:07,052
Rym: The guy's coming to kill him.

741
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:08,640
Rym: He's just sitting there like you're gonna die.

742
00:42:09,162 --> 00:42:12,755
Rym: I'm gonna walk over there and kill you and the guy's like you're not gonna do that.

743
00:42:12,835 --> 00:42:14,405
Rym: and then he does it just like Dr.

744
00:42:14,425 --> 00:42:15,200
Rym: McNinja's dead.

745
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:16,925
Scott: Yeah, oh shit.

746
00:42:17,386 --> 00:42:18,310
Rym: Yeah, what if it was dr.

747
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,916
Rym: McNinja's dad versus Russia?

748
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:20,337
Scott: Maybe that's.

749
00:42:20,398 --> 00:42:25,460
Scott: I'll bring dr Minijan later, but right now I'm gonna bring in pan throw from the Thundercats.

750
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,654
Scott: So I mentioned before who's.

751
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:32,000
Scott: oh He's real strong and he's got nunchucks and he could just beat the shit out of Roshank in a straight fight.

752
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,900
Scott: Roshak in a straight fight and not a goddamn thing you could do about it, huh?

753
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:37,783
Rym: I don't know.

754
00:42:37,803 --> 00:42:38,345
Rym: I think it's still.

755
00:42:38,365 --> 00:42:45,391
Rym: I think in the end Roshak would lose because he is just a human and His pan throw is a real fast.

756
00:42:45,592 --> 00:42:46,797
Scott: He's a he's a cat person.

757
00:42:46,837 --> 00:42:48,343
Scott: He's a furry He's he's.

758
00:42:48,684 --> 00:42:49,488
Scott: I mean pan throw.

759
00:42:49,929 --> 00:42:52,460
Scott: I was thinking about using Mike Tyson, but I didn't want to go back to boxing.

760
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,070
Scott: But pan throw could probably beat Mike Tyson when you really think about it.

761
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,160
Scott: Yeah, and he's got nunchucks with cat claws on him.

762
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:04,232
Rym: However, someone very similar to pan throw is jet from cowboy bebop.

763
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:07,885
Rym: Ooh, they are similar and I think jet and pan throw Would be a knockdown.

764
00:43:07,905 --> 00:43:10,840
Rym: drag him out fight the likes of which we've only seen and they live.

765
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:12,228
Scott: That'd be a tough call.

766
00:43:12,248 --> 00:43:14,941
Scott: cuz nunchucks versus metal arm Mmm.

767
00:43:15,282 --> 00:43:17,569
Rym: Yeah jet is real freakin strong.

768
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:20,800
Scott: He is but I I think pan throw might still win that one.

769
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:27,808
Rym: I think path road win in the end, but he'd be bloody and And it'd be like the final like.

770
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:31,304
Rym: and then he's standing there barely alive Mm-hmm.

771
00:43:31,324 --> 00:43:32,709
Rym: So path row is still standing.

772
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,794
Rym: Yep now lion.

773
00:43:33,814 --> 00:43:35,420
Rym: I'll could just kill panther anytime he wanted.

774
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,765
Rym: So I'm not even gonna think about that.

775
00:43:37,086 --> 00:43:39,816
Rym: chitar would just seduce him and break his neck bond style.

776
00:43:39,836 --> 00:43:44,279
Rym: Mm-hmm James Bond would probably stand at a distance and shoot him a bunch of times.

777
00:43:44,842 --> 00:43:47,952
Scott: Oh, you're gonna do that, but wood bullets work is pants.

778
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,200
Scott: I mean James Bond throws not immune to bullets.

779
00:43:50,381 --> 00:43:52,750
Rym: No, but James Bond uses that tiny ass little pistol.

780
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:54,838
Rym: Those bullets probably wouldn't take Panther.

781
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:55,480
Scott: Oh, that is right.

782
00:43:55,581 --> 00:44:00,980
Scott: I have seen pan throw block Projectiles by swinging his nunchucks very quickly in a Michelangelo fashion.

783
00:44:01,301 --> 00:44:04,840
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's unless I use one of the James Bonds that has a rocket launcher.

784
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:06,527
Rym: He pretty much just has that little pistol.

785
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:06,989
Scott: Yep.

786
00:44:07,471 --> 00:44:08,375
Rym: Panther was tough to beat.

787
00:44:08,717 --> 00:44:09,420
Scott: He is tough to beat.

788
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,366
Scott: You're gonna have to start getting more superhuman here.

789
00:44:11,768 --> 00:44:14,456
Rym: Yeah, you know who could be pantro real easily though.

790
00:44:14,476 --> 00:44:16,944
Rym: Oh There's a lot of options here.

791
00:44:16,964 --> 00:44:20,374
Rym: I think von fon L even without his guy my laugh.

792
00:44:21,297 --> 00:44:23,314
Scott: Oh, I don't know who that is from eska flown a.

793
00:44:24,721 --> 00:44:27,431
Rym: You know the secondary main character.

794
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:28,837
Rym: Yeah von.

795
00:44:29,158 --> 00:44:36,063
Scott: All right Fon L confused me von fon L. Yeah, the main guy with the red shirt in the yeah How could you?

796
00:44:36,264 --> 00:44:39,960
Scott: eska flown is like one of the best and I remember that the last name threw me off.

797
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,886
Scott: You just said von.

798
00:44:40,926 --> 00:44:42,959
Scott: I'd be like, oh von from eska phony, right?

799
00:44:43,721 --> 00:44:48,415
Scott: Fon L. You said fon L. I was like von fon L. You know, I was like I was thinking of his one word.

800
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,406
Scott: like von fon L I was like what the fuck see.

801
00:44:50,447 --> 00:44:55,247
Rym: I learned from initial D that if you say someone's whole name Mmm, see von.

802
00:44:55,267 --> 00:45:02,800
Scott: I love to bring initial D into this but We already determined that M bison can punch cars to smithereens and he was way back.

803
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,476
Rym: So yeah, talk to me would just come with his car, but it wouldn't matter.

804
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:06,120
Scott: It wouldn't matter.

805
00:45:06,641 --> 00:45:10,722
Rym: So yeah, von fon L can pretty much kick anyone's ass with the sword He does.

806
00:45:10,762 --> 00:45:13,693
Scott: he has a sword and pan throws got nunchucks.

807
00:45:14,155 --> 00:45:18,417
Rym: It would be tough, but On kills dragons without a guy.

808
00:45:18,437 --> 00:45:19,622
Scott: my left That is right.

809
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:23,254
Scott: and the best pan throw can't even beat up mummies in the first episode.

810
00:45:23,434 --> 00:45:25,080
Rym: He was trained by barges.

811
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:27,286
Rym: Yep, what was that guy's name?

812
00:45:27,346 --> 00:45:27,767
Rym: Boggess?

813
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:28,690
Scott: I don't know.

814
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,673
Scott: I don't remember the guy's name.

815
00:45:29,873 --> 00:45:31,658
Rym: Anyway, he was trained by a consummate.

816
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:35,760
Rym: badass Kills a dragon in the first episode.

817
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:38,453
Rym: Panther has got no chance against that shit.

818
00:45:38,473 --> 00:45:43,449
Rym: Panther is not a dragon Alright, I was just a cat boy with an awesome voice.

819
00:45:43,469 --> 00:45:44,311
Scott: That's right.

820
00:45:44,813 --> 00:45:50,150
Scott: Who can beat the sword of Von L. That is a very quality sword.

821
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:55,105
Scott: We're gonna have to probably pick the greatest swordsman ever The greatest swordsman ever.

822
00:45:55,426 --> 00:45:57,070
Rym: yes, I can think of like five.

823
00:45:57,552 --> 00:45:59,397
Scott: there is only one greatest swordsman ever.

824
00:45:59,437 --> 00:46:00,580
Rym: You're stalling for time.

825
00:46:00,741 --> 00:46:02,187
Rym: Nope, I've already thought of it.

826
00:46:02,348 --> 00:46:05,020
Scott: Okay, who the dread pirate to Roberts?

827
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,936
Rym: Von might win just for the fact that he usually cuts through people's swords and then through the people.

828
00:46:14,377 --> 00:46:15,060
Scott: that is true.

829
00:46:15,461 --> 00:46:30,146
Rym: Von is just crazy fast and powerful and while the dread pirate is what probably the best swordsman ever He is human in the normal sense of the word, but he is so cunning and God, yeah, Von's not very smart.

830
00:46:30,427 --> 00:46:31,149
Scott: No, he's not.

831
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:34,680
Scott: he could totally fool him, but he's some cool trick about poison in a cup.

832
00:46:34,905 --> 00:46:35,399
Rym: Well, you know what?

833
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:42,540
Rym: Even if Von couldn't beat him Alan Shazar from the same anime would just kill him with the sword like that.

834
00:46:43,203 --> 00:46:46,800
Scott: Oh, yeah, Alan is almost as sword skilled.

835
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:50,173
Rym: Alan is smart against everything in the world except women.

836
00:46:50,534 --> 00:46:52,140
Rym: Whereby he acts like a jackass.

837
00:46:53,181 --> 00:46:55,768
Scott: Hmm, so I'm gonna take it up a notch.

838
00:46:55,808 --> 00:46:56,309
Scott: You're ready.

839
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:59,137
Scott: You're ready Alan Shazar right week against women.

840
00:46:59,337 --> 00:47:00,300
Scott: Yeah, we're going up.

841
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,231
Scott: We're gonna have to start using people with more powers.

842
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:03,297
Scott: Now you can use priss.

843
00:47:03,598 --> 00:47:08,251
Scott: No We're gonna use Makoto Kusanagi up.

844
00:47:08,573 --> 00:47:11,886
Rym: She wins she wins She's invisible.

845
00:47:12,128 --> 00:47:13,093
Scott: She's got guns.

846
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,806
Scott: She's Cyborg she's.

847
00:47:16,288 --> 00:47:16,850
Scott: you're done.

848
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:21,071
Rym: Not only you're gonna need to take it way up, but after you killed it She'd be like, why doesn't he have a cyber brain?

849
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:21,876
Rym: What's up with that?

850
00:47:22,037 --> 00:47:24,526
Scott: Yeah So you're gonna need to be like.

851
00:47:24,586 --> 00:47:26,615
Scott: we're already way above spider-man levels here.

852
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:33,218
Rym: We need to like, you know I mean the major can kill pretty much anyone in the ghost in the shell series.

853
00:47:33,439 --> 00:47:43,759
Scott: Yeah anyway, I mean I mean anyway, like she can only get really be stopped by tanks and People with like serious even people with serious battle armor can't beat her.

854
00:47:43,799 --> 00:47:48,660
Rym: now Bear in mind Scott said tanks plural because we know very well that one tank is no match for her.

855
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,025
Scott: Yeah, that's the end of the first movie.

856
00:47:50,085 --> 00:47:53,255
Scott: Yeah, like the one big tank doesn't win.

857
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:54,118
Rym: Not at all.

858
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:56,203
Scott: So Yeah.

859
00:47:56,424 --> 00:47:58,294
Scott: All right, you're gonna have to bring out something big now.

860
00:47:58,394 --> 00:47:59,540
Rym: fucking damn the major.

861
00:47:59,641 --> 00:48:03,120
Rym: I mean, I thought Oh Ellen Shazar in Scheherazade.

862
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:07,358
Rym: But no the major would just like punch through the front and rip his face off.

863
00:48:07,558 --> 00:48:18,240
Scott: Yep she wouldn't even think he tried to stand how even like An eight an Ava I was about to say Ava is a tough fight against the major.

864
00:48:18,381 --> 00:48:19,568
Rym: I don't know how you beat me to it.

865
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:25,100
Rym: I was gonna say an Ava I was gonna go there You're gonna go there cuz I first I was gonna go with a gassaraki.

866
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:32,100
Rym: But well who see the regular robots in gassaraki from the early part of the show the major which is destroyed.

867
00:48:32,361 --> 00:48:34,855
Rym: Yeah, I mean regular commandos can take those things out.

868
00:48:35,077 --> 00:48:38,631
Scott: Mm-hmm But a whole fleet of them, but I don't think we're gonna allow teams.

869
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:38,932
Scott: No team.

870
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:40,919
Rym: What about the the other?

871
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:46,968
Rym: Gassaraki from later in the show that the actual one Mmm, cuz that thing's organic and shit.

872
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,285
Scott: It is organic and shit and while she'd probably tear it up It might get her.

873
00:48:51,648 --> 00:48:52,313
Rym: but here's the thing.

874
00:48:52,575 --> 00:48:55,079
Rym: even if she beat it It would be that situation where she beats it.

875
00:48:55,381 --> 00:48:58,279
Rym: But all this left to her is like a torso and an arm and part of her head.

876
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:01,640
Scott: Yeah, does that who we gonna count as the winner in that case though?

877
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:02,204
Rym: I don't know.

878
00:49:02,224 --> 00:49:04,340
Rym: so I'm gonna go with the Ava because it's a more interesting argument.

879
00:49:04,884 --> 00:49:06,838
Rym: I also don't want to accidentally ruin gassaraki.

880
00:49:06,898 --> 00:49:08,465
Scott: Yes Well, here's the thing with the Ava.

881
00:49:08,526 --> 00:49:08,767
Scott: right.

882
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:12,160
Scott: if the Ava is up and about right?

883
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,872
Scott: She could probably hide from it being invisible until it runs on.

884
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:16,299
Scott: Ava can totally find it.

885
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:19,397
Scott: It's got scanning and shit and they've got crazy technology in nerve.

886
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:20,000
Scott: They know where it is.

887
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,770
Scott: They know when angels are coming from far away.

888
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:23,560
Scott: They can find one invisible cyborg.

889
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:30,970
Rym: Yeah, and Ava the Ava definitely comes with nerve though nerve can't isn't in the battle Nerve is in a separate screen talking to the pilot.

890
00:49:31,532 --> 00:49:32,918
Rym: I think it comes down to who the pilot is.

891
00:49:32,938 --> 00:49:41,597
Scott: No, no It doesn't has nothing to do with it So powerful with his giant guns that if it shot her and hit it would just win.

892
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:45,119
Scott: however Ava's only last for a few minutes.

893
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:47,887
Scott: could she avoid it until the power ran out?

894
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:52,299
Rym: or if the power were plugged in which could be feasible because the powers everywhere.

895
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,842
Scott: in Tokyo three, but we're not in Tokyo D. We're in a sealed Forcefield.

896
00:49:56,862 --> 00:49:58,911
Rym: the powers him even if the power were there.

897
00:49:58,951 --> 00:49:59,694
Rym: Here's my worry.

898
00:50:00,237 --> 00:50:05,180
Rym: while they're fighting She would like jump onto its leg and somehow get up there and mess up that power cable.

899
00:50:05,481 --> 00:50:08,318
Scott: She would get inside of it and shit ripping stuff apart.

900
00:50:08,358 --> 00:50:11,891
Rym: See though I don't know if she could cuz it's basically God kind of.

901
00:50:12,212 --> 00:50:13,857
Rym: yeah, it's it's part of God.

902
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:14,780
Rym: It's a piece of God.

903
00:50:14,841 --> 00:50:16,016
Rym: It's also Shinji's mom.

904
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:17,724
Rym: See here's the thing.

905
00:50:17,805 --> 00:50:20,719
Rym: if it's Shinji the Ava loses cuz she'll flash a boob.

906
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,871
Rym: Shinji will freak out the Ava will just sit there and then she wins.

907
00:50:24,493 --> 00:50:26,220
Scott: All right, so pick which Ava it's gonna be.

908
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,914
Rym: All right, it's Asuka in the movie where she's all pissed off.

909
00:50:29,176 --> 00:50:33,160
Rym: All right, but All right, so way or you know what you want to go all the way.

910
00:50:33,461 --> 00:50:35,353
Rym: It'll be one of those white things from the end.

911
00:50:35,373 --> 00:50:39,452
Rym: All right, one of those white It'll be Ava series with its giant giant sword.

912
00:50:39,512 --> 00:50:41,320
Rym: That's also the sphere of longanews.

913
00:50:42,781 --> 00:50:44,065
Scott: Those don't run out of power.

914
00:50:44,085 --> 00:50:46,913
Rym: She's fighting against what is effectively a tiny deity.

915
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:51,244
Scott: Well seeing as those don't run out of electricity She's got no chance.

916
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:53,412
Scott: Yeah, she could avoid it for a while.

917
00:50:53,653 --> 00:50:58,931
Scott: Maybe do some damage to it But eventually is just gonna just give her credit.

918
00:50:58,951 --> 00:51:00,235
Scott: It's gonna squish her under its boot.

919
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:01,800
Rym: She would hold out for a while.

920
00:51:02,283 --> 00:51:08,937
Rym: I mean, I've seen her fight some pretty dangerous things but these those Ava series from the end not I mean aside from being tiny deities.

921
00:51:09,398 --> 00:51:11,648
Rym: if you Put one through a meat grinder.

922
00:51:11,929 --> 00:51:13,737
Rym: It comes back in like 20 minutes.

923
00:51:14,118 --> 00:51:19,200
Scott: Hmm So I know I think we're scaling up a bit too fast because well, we're running out of time.

924
00:51:19,341 --> 00:51:20,465
Scott: So I'm running out of time.

925
00:51:20,606 --> 00:51:22,815
Rym: We've been talking about this for almost a half hour.

926
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:23,920
Scott: All right, let's see.

927
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,087
Scott: Then I got to go way big.

928
00:51:25,107 --> 00:51:25,449
Scott: you ready?

929
00:51:25,469 --> 00:51:30,350
Rym: All right, I'm gonna go For I mean, I got Ava series here.

930
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:36,431
Scott: I'm gonna go for oh What's that anime with the that was made by this.

931
00:51:36,632 --> 00:51:39,020
Scott: the slayers guys in space lost universe?

932
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,262
Rym: I never actually saw.

933
00:51:40,283 --> 00:51:42,370
Scott: lost me there, but they had a ship with the Jew gun.

934
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:50,035
Rym: Nothing's gonna beat an Ava but that Jew gun See while the Jew gun would probably take out your ordinary run-of-the-mill Ava.

935
00:51:50,496 --> 00:51:51,400
Rym: This is Ava series.

936
00:51:52,003 --> 00:51:53,250
Scott: I think that you gun would still win.

937
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:54,216
Scott: I mean it's in space.

938
00:51:54,256 --> 00:51:55,000
Scott: The thing can't get up.

939
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,524
Scott: Yes, it can.

940
00:51:55,585 --> 00:51:57,440
Rym: Ava series has the spear of longanews.

941
00:51:57,641 --> 00:52:01,900
Rym: They all do remember the episode where they throw the spear of longanews into space and take out that angel.

942
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,187
Rym: That's actually a space station.

943
00:52:03,448 --> 00:52:06,503
Rym: They just do that to that spaceship and that's the end I don't know.

944
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:09,012
Scott: but the space station gets shot off in the Coliseum.

945
00:52:09,032 --> 00:52:09,795
Scott: That's right.

946
00:52:09,815 --> 00:52:10,437
Scott: We're not in space.

947
00:52:10,457 --> 00:52:11,200
Scott: We're in a Coliseum.

948
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:12,404
Scott: No, no fine.

949
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:14,411
Rym: The spaces could be in space or real bombardment.

950
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,900
Rym: It doesn't matter cuz just it'll stand there.

951
00:52:17,241 --> 00:52:19,689
Rym: It'll throw the spear that turns into the spear longanews.

952
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:25,895
Rym: that thing can go into orbit from earth as we saw Go right through the space station turn everyone into goop.

953
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:29,982
Scott: All right Well, there's no way that that could be the most powerful thing There is.

954
00:52:30,002 --> 00:52:31,328
Scott: there's got to be something better than that.

955
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,840
Rym: I can think of one thing more powerful than that.

956
00:52:34,422 --> 00:52:35,144
Scott: I got something.

957
00:52:35,164 --> 00:52:35,546
Scott: you're ready.

958
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:36,509
Scott: Who's the name?

959
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:38,958
Scott: Who's that wizard from the forgotten realm?

960
00:52:39,138 --> 00:52:40,664
Rym: Oh shit What's his name?

961
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:42,009
Scott: Elminster Elminster?

962
00:52:42,029 --> 00:52:42,772
Scott: We'll go with him.

963
00:52:43,234 --> 00:52:49,755
Rym: He'll just cast hold monster Hold monster wouldn't work cuz you know that the Ava has one fuck of a saving throw.

964
00:52:50,217 --> 00:52:51,180
Scott: It does not matter.

965
00:52:52,022 --> 00:52:54,040
Scott: He's about like level 20 bajillions.

966
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,231
Rym: I forget the cannon level because it used to be.

967
00:52:57,291 --> 00:52:59,660
Rym: he was just effectively a tiny god.

968
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,920
Rym: But with the advent of third ed they gave him epic levels and they defined all that stuff.

969
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:08,598
Scott: Yeah, I mean he could just cast freaking disjunction on the lands of longanews or whatever.

970
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:11,538
Rym: All right Yeah, you would cast that but the explosion might kill him.

971
00:53:12,343 --> 00:53:14,258
Scott: No, cuz he would just teleport away somewhere.

972
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:25,527
Rym: no I think while he is super powerful and While he has the essence of the goddess mistra in him and he's the chosen mister and all that business He's also really really old.

973
00:53:25,587 --> 00:53:27,052
Rym: He's a frail old man.

974
00:53:27,072 --> 00:53:31,649
Rym: He is held together by magic and bits But he's got feats like quicken spell.

975
00:53:31,669 --> 00:53:34,080
Scott: the Ava couldn't even act before he dismantled it with magic.

976
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,207
Rym: Yeah, but think about how little damage those spells do.

977
00:53:36,227 --> 00:53:39,176
Rym: a 20th art a 20d6 fireball.

978
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,280
Scott: He could just cast wish.

979
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:42,827
Rym: You know wish isn't really that powerful.

980
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:46,080
Scott: it's powerful enough to get rid of any what bad one bad guy.

981
00:53:46,382 --> 00:53:48,840
Rym: No, cuz a wish alone does not destroy the tarrasque.

982
00:53:50,822 --> 00:53:52,151
Scott: This is okay.

983
00:53:52,393 --> 00:53:53,880
Scott: the tarrasque All right.

984
00:53:54,161 --> 00:53:55,167
Scott: You know what that?

985
00:53:55,187 --> 00:54:00,070
Rym: the reason I brought up the tarrasque is because the Ava series Could beat the tarrasque without even trying.

986
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:01,897
Scott: why not not even a chance.

987
00:54:02,058 --> 00:54:02,500
Scott: Are you kidding?

988
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:10,340
Rym: The Ava series is so powerful once again tiny God, you know The only way to destroy and as far as we know, there's no way to destroy it.

989
00:54:11,344 --> 00:54:12,433
Rym: You have to do something special.

990
00:54:12,453 --> 00:54:13,220
Scott: What are you talking about?

991
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,890
Scott: They like half of them got their heads smashed in by the other Ava.

992
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:16,654
Rym: Yeah, and you know what.

993
00:54:16,694 --> 00:54:18,080
Rym: they all came back.

994
00:54:18,402 --> 00:54:24,699
Rym: I just ruined part of the movie, but it doesn't matter cuz that movie sucks All right, they come right back.

995
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:29,859
Rym: You got to kill them with something special like the end of the world or some crazy thing the tarrasque.

996
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:34,842
Rym: All they would do again is beat the hell out of it and then stick it with the spirit long enough Okay.

997
00:54:34,862 --> 00:54:35,385
Scott: Well, you know what?

998
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:41,233
Scott: I was gonna go with the obvious, you know ace in the hole Which is always Galactus cuz he just eats the whole world and everything on it.

999
00:54:41,374 --> 00:54:42,479
Scott: Yeah, but I'm not gonna do that.

1000
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:43,331
Scott: I got a better right.

1001
00:54:43,351 --> 00:54:43,920
Rym: Where are you going?

1002
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,457
Scott: I'm going to get my buddy from the bottom of the ocean the great Cthulhu.

1003
00:54:48,657 --> 00:54:52,093
Scott: Fuck you I thought you could do Cthulhu six times.

1004
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:52,876
Scott: You don't mean shit.

1005
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:53,479
Scott: He come back.

1006
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,640
Scott: He might be dreaming for a while.

1007
00:54:55,841 --> 00:54:59,040
Scott: The battle might last a while while the Ava's wait for Cthulhu to come back.

1008
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,518
Scott: But when he does one tentacle and you're done, it's all over.

1009
00:55:03,443 --> 00:55:06,136
Rym: See now if there's a human piloting this then it'd be over immediately.

1010
00:55:06,176 --> 00:55:06,980
Rym: Just go insane and die.

1011
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:07,999
Rym: They'd see it and be like.

1012
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:14,880
Scott: Isn't the the Ava biological in some way it is wouldn't it go insane and die?

1013
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:19,373
Rym: No Because the Ava series remember is not it's got a dummy plug in it.

1014
00:55:19,574 --> 00:55:21,400
Scott: the dummy plug would go insane and die.

1015
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:22,304
Rym: See, here's the thing.

1016
00:55:22,344 --> 00:55:24,514
Rym: Remember it's not a human biological.

1017
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:25,680
Rym: It's a it's deific.

1018
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:36,214
Rym: So while it is definitely not as it might be marginally as powerful as Cthulhu might be close because Cthulhu is not Really a god, he's just a priest of a god.

1019
00:55:36,456 --> 00:55:37,319
Rym: who is that's.

1020
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:40,640
Scott: If Cthulhu goes down, you know where I'm going next, right?

1021
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:44,400
Rym: I know you're going next but here's the thing a fight between Cthulhu and an Ava series.

1022
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:53,324
Rym: I think they're on close to equal footing and as long as the person inside of Ava series or the dummy plug can resist Going insane and dying.

1023
00:55:53,344 --> 00:55:58,216
Rym: I think cuz remember nukes can't take out Ava's nukes can't take out angels.

1024
00:55:58,456 --> 00:55:59,860
Rym: This thing is an Ava angel.

1025
00:56:00,801 --> 00:56:02,707
Scott: Yeah, well is the thing you?

1026
00:56:03,008 --> 00:56:04,432
Scott: Cthulhu can't really be destroyed.

1027
00:56:04,472 --> 00:56:08,659
Scott: he'll keep coming back and every time he comes back He'll do a little more damage to that Ava.

1028
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,013
Scott: but I think even if the Ava takes out Cthulhu eventually it'll run down.

1029
00:56:12,093 --> 00:56:14,302
Rym: but I think this thing will keep coming back to because The thing is.

1030
00:56:14,563 --> 00:56:19,680
Rym: the only reason Cthulhu keeps coming back is because nothing conceived by man can destroy Cthulhu.

1031
00:56:19,821 --> 00:56:21,780
Rym: We can't fathom what would destroy Cthulhu.

1032
00:56:22,201 --> 00:56:27,300
Rym: It's like an ant and it bites me on the toe and I go stupid and I'll be back and I step on the air.

1033
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:31,693
Scott: I can't accept that Cthulhu would lose to your Ava series.

1034
00:56:32,034 --> 00:56:32,756
Scott: There's no way.

1035
00:56:32,836 --> 00:56:33,900
Rym: I don't know if it would lose.

1036
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:42,683
Rym: I think it would be like two minor gods fighting and while the Ava series might lose eventually I think it would lose in the end Which is what matters.

1037
00:56:42,763 --> 00:56:49,186
Rym: but once again the spear of longinus the fact that this thing is part deity and Cthulhu It's got that spear.

1038
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,331
Scott: that could be tough for Cthulhu.

1039
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:52,058
Rym: See that's the thing the Ava series.

1040
00:56:52,098 --> 00:56:54,811
Scott: but good Right, but is it good at handling the spear?

1041
00:56:54,852 --> 00:56:56,460
Scott: Cthulhu could block it with his tentacle.

1042
00:56:56,902 --> 00:56:58,550
Rym: I don't know if anything can block the spear.

1043
00:56:58,852 --> 00:56:59,636
Scott: He's got a tentacle.

1044
00:56:59,676 --> 00:57:00,480
Scott: He could totally grab it.

1045
00:57:00,802 --> 00:57:09,140
Rym: I mean, it's basically a piece of a deity Wielding the only thing that has ever killed a deity and it's fighting a priest of a deity.

1046
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,880
Rym: So I think you're gonna have to go to your Trump, which I have nothing to say against.

1047
00:57:12,442 --> 00:57:14,227
Scott: Oh, well, my Trump isn't gonna be what you think.

1048
00:57:14,247 --> 00:57:18,100
Scott: You thought I was gonna say something like Azathoth or Nyarlathotep.

1049
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,531
Rym: I expected Nyarlathotep.

1050
00:57:20,953 --> 00:57:26,016
Rym: I really expected Nyarlathotep But I'm not cuz he would just blink and the Ava series is gone.

1051
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:26,900
Scott: That is not where I'm going.

1052
00:57:27,061 --> 00:57:32,764
Scott: I'm going to the Flying Spaghetti Monster with his noodly appendage Actual deity.

1053
00:57:32,945 --> 00:57:36,420
Scott: all he would do was reach down with his noodly appendage touch it and it's gone.

1054
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,086
Rym: No, it wouldn't be gone.

1055
00:57:37,106 --> 00:57:37,652
Rym: It would convert.

1056
00:57:37,672 --> 00:57:38,237
Rym: it would join him.

1057
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:49,208
Rym: It would join him which the only being that is immune to being converted is a priest or a nun According to that Flying Spaghetti Monster game.

1058
00:57:49,228 --> 00:57:53,463
Rym: Yes, so it would turn into a pirate a tiny pirate That is right.

1059
00:57:53,985 --> 00:57:58,520
Scott: So cuz what in all the universe can beat the Flying Spaghetti Monster?

1060
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:58,781
Rym: All right.

1061
00:57:58,801 --> 00:58:02,733
Rym: So now we're asking what can beat a god in a in a world.

1062
00:58:02,753 --> 00:58:06,365
Scott: Oh, he's not easy Flying Spaghetti Monster But newly appendages.

1063
00:58:06,626 --> 00:58:09,739
Scott: I have a funny answer to what can beat him, but I want to see if you can.

1064
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,190
Rym: well That would be an Italian chef.

1065
00:58:11,392 --> 00:58:18,827
Rym: or yes All right, what is it Mario?

1066
00:58:18,847 --> 00:58:20,112
Rym: because they like it there spaghetti.

1067
00:58:20,373 --> 00:58:20,915
Scott: that is right.

1068
00:58:20,935 --> 00:58:22,180
Scott: so which one of those are you gonna go with?

1069
00:58:23,401 --> 00:58:27,915
Rym: See, I'm gonna go with the more fun round where the only reason it beats Ava series.

1070
00:58:27,936 --> 00:58:28,076
Rym: cuz.

1071
00:58:28,156 --> 00:58:29,501
Rym: Ava series is a piece of a God.

1072
00:58:29,541 --> 00:58:30,405
Rym: Cthulhu is a priest.

1073
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:32,374
Rym: Ava series is a mod like an angel.

1074
00:58:32,434 --> 00:58:33,338
Rym: It's a minor deific.

1075
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:36,119
Rym: being FSM is effectively a god.

1076
00:58:36,581 --> 00:58:43,027
Rym: so the only thing that could beat the FSM is a more powerful God and Yahweh for all is whatever.

1077
00:58:43,449 --> 00:58:44,695
Rym: isn't actually that great.

1078
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:45,720
Rym: He was just some mom.

1079
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,155
Scott: We've been talking about creatures of fantasy the whole time.

1080
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:58,095
Rym: So yeah But he's this minor Judaic God among all these other gods that the Jews worship and He just kind of had an arrogance complex and wanted to be the only one worshiped in whatever.

1081
00:58:58,516 --> 00:58:59,540
Rym: so he's not that great.

1082
00:58:59,863 --> 00:59:01,439
Rym: He just won by trickery and bullshit.

1083
00:59:02,546 --> 00:59:03,519
Rym: Who could beat the FSM?

1084
00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:08,174
Rym: I know Thor has a mighty appetite and Thor is a major deity.

1085
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:09,419
Rym: who's got that hammer?

1086
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:09,740
Rym: now?

1087
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,984
Rym: I'm not talking about Marvel.

1088
00:59:11,004 --> 00:59:15,198
Rym: whatever thought I'm talking about Thor but God it's the same Thor.

1089
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:19,163
Scott: actually The Marvel Thor is Thor.

1090
00:59:19,203 --> 00:59:22,834
Rym: all right if the Marvel Thor is Thor then how come there is ever a question?

1091
00:59:22,874 --> 00:59:28,019
Rym: how come there's ever an issue where Thor Disagrees with anyone and they are not turned into goo by his hammer?

1092
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,428
Scott: Because the problem is the way they do?

1093
00:59:30,508 --> 00:59:33,980
Scott: Thor is like Thor is doesn't have his own body.

1094
00:59:34,061 --> 00:59:36,099
Scott: He always possesses whoever picks up the hammer.

1095
00:59:37,302 --> 00:59:39,132
Rym: I'm not talking about Thor's avatar.

1096
00:59:39,394 --> 00:59:44,895
Scott: It's not Thor's avatar It's if you pick up the hammer the Thor possesses your body.

1097
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,120
Rym: That's what an avatar is.

1098
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:55,070
Scott: That's when a god possesses a physical body in order to but then your body is like transformed into Thor's body Which is the equivalent of as if Thor had his own.

1099
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:58,773
Rym: but it's not as powerful as the raw Essence that is Thor.

1100
00:59:58,813 --> 00:59:59,318
Rym: that it is.

1101
00:59:59,378 --> 01:00:05,920
Scott: no But only difference is that in the back of Thor's mind is that original person thinking on their own outside of Thor?

1102
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:08,012
Scott: It is Thor basically through and through.

1103
01:00:08,113 --> 01:00:09,320
Scott: no, but it doesn't really matter.

1104
01:00:09,641 --> 01:00:11,711
Scott: It doesn't matter because we're talking about Thor in general.

1105
01:00:12,093 --> 01:00:13,420
Rym: Yeah, you know what fuck Thor.

1106
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:15,586
Rym: We're going right to the top with Odin.

1107
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:20,040
Scott: Odin versus the Flying Spaghetti monster would just destroy him.

1108
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:24,159
Rym: He would ride sleep near into battle and fucking cream him.

1109
01:00:25,063 --> 01:00:27,592
Rym: There's no question that Odin would win that battle.

1110
01:00:28,014 --> 01:00:29,600
Rym: Odin is mighty badass.

1111
01:00:30,363 --> 01:00:32,230
Scott: Odin is a mighty badass course.

1112
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:38,800
Rym: the problem is if you know anything about Norse mythology You know exactly what can kill Odin, but I don't want to go that obvious route.

1113
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,020
Rym: Do you even know who kills Odin in Ragnarok?

1114
01:00:43,602 --> 01:00:47,852
Rym: Loki guessing Alright, so who do you think in every who you gonna have?

1115
01:00:47,872 --> 01:00:49,260
Rym: beat Odin, huh?

1116
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:54,207
Scott: Well Odin was in charge of an entire pantheon of gods Yeah, one of the best pantheons.

1117
01:00:54,327 --> 01:00:56,775
Scott: and he had a raven and he was missing an eyeball.

1118
01:00:57,217 --> 01:00:58,120
Rym: Well, he had two Ravens.

1119
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,448
Rym: Oh, yeah, you get immune and thought in memory.

1120
01:01:00,588 --> 01:01:00,990
Scott: That's right.

1121
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,113
Rym: And the Ravens are there.

1122
01:01:02,134 --> 01:01:06,360
Rym: Yeah, and you know, I mean he's Odin He's probably got like a thousand axes on him.

1123
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,110
Rym: Well, he's riding a horse with a bunch of.

1124
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:12,840
Scott: I think I'm gonna try a horizontal a horizontal move.

1125
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,152
Scott: I'm not gonna try to go up or down.

1126
01:01:14,172 --> 01:01:14,919
Rym: You're gonna say Poseidon.

1127
01:01:15,394 --> 01:01:22,257
Scott: No I'm gonna say Zeus Because Zeus is about equal in the power levels in charge of a pantheon, but he doesn't swing axes.

1128
01:01:22,277 --> 01:01:23,220
Scott: He throws lightning bolts.

1129
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,776
Scott: So what you gonna do?

1130
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:31,847
Scott: I think I really just safe in his cloud up in the sky throw in his lightning bolts and Odin be like fuck Fuck fuck.

1131
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:32,891
Rym: see here's the thing.

1132
01:01:32,951 --> 01:01:35,000
Rym: the gods are spawned by the beliefs of their believers.

1133
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:40,900
Rym: So they and since we're talking about the leaders of the pantheon which are effectively equal what this comes down to is which?

1134
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:47,340
Rym: Civilization and culture is more purely badass the Greeks or the Norse?

1135
01:01:48,402 --> 01:01:53,950
Rym: That is what this has come down to and I submit the Norse As much as I love the Greeks.

1136
01:01:54,352 --> 01:01:56,240
Rym: the Greeks got their asses kicked by the Romans.

1137
01:01:56,561 --> 01:01:59,193
Rym: They got their asses kicked by everyone.

1138
01:01:59,233 --> 01:02:00,559
Rym: they kicked each other's asses.

1139
01:02:01,363 --> 01:02:05,100
Rym: Granted the Norse were just consummate badasses.

1140
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:09,800
Scott: They were badasses, but they also got put in by the wussy English.

1141
01:02:10,622 --> 01:02:21,333
Scott: Yeah, yeah while the Greeks, you know while they were maybe punned by the Romans They were still around and Byzantine was mostly Greek as you know, mr.

1142
01:02:21,373 --> 01:02:22,115
Scott: Byzantine Emperor.

1143
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:25,425
Rym: Yeah, but it wasn't Greek like that Great.

1144
01:02:25,626 --> 01:02:37,673
Rym: there's a lot of different kinds of Greeks and by then it was Greek Christian, which is a totally different breed of Greek We're talking about like pre-hellenistic Greeks Mmm, very tough Dorian's and shit Illyrian and all that.

1145
01:02:37,693 --> 01:02:39,500
Scott: Yeah, so Greeks or Vikings?

1146
01:02:40,322 --> 01:02:41,712
Scott: Great, like I like Vikings.

1147
01:02:41,732 --> 01:02:42,900
Rym: Well, I don't want to say just Viking.

1148
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:45,490
Rym: I'm gonna go with Norseman in general because they weren't all Vikings.

1149
01:02:46,092 --> 01:02:48,060
Scott: So it's Hagar the horrible.

1150
01:02:48,961 --> 01:02:49,403
Rym: Remember.

1151
01:02:50,447 --> 01:03:00,468
Rym: the Norseman as people know them came way later than the Greeks So they had the advantage of better equipment in some cases But they were also more barbaric.

1152
01:03:00,589 --> 01:03:01,251
Rym: true true.

1153
01:03:01,271 --> 01:03:03,499
Scott: I don't know might flip a coin.

1154
01:03:04,101 --> 01:03:08,339
Rym: See the problem is I'm arguing mostly from the fact that I really like the Norse and I think they're cool.

1155
01:03:08,761 --> 01:03:11,932
Rym: Yeah, and you're arguing the fact that Zeus is awesome.

1156
01:03:12,033 --> 01:03:12,956
Scott: This is awesome.

1157
01:03:12,996 --> 01:03:13,960
Scott: Definitely more awesome than Odin.

1158
01:03:14,282 --> 01:03:15,672
Rym: Yeah, I'm surprised you didn't say Poseidon.

1159
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:16,800
Rym: You seem to always like Poseidon.

1160
01:03:17,141 --> 01:03:25,578
Scott: I do but I just don't think a guy with water is gonna beat a guy, you know He's also horses and like war all this other stuff Poseidon is really powerful.

1161
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:28,127
Scott: Yes He's also an ass jackass.

1162
01:03:28,287 --> 01:03:31,900
Scott: That's why I like him so much, but I don't think he's gonna beat Odin.

1163
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:32,959
Scott: I think it's gonna take Zeus.

1164
01:03:33,662 --> 01:03:41,108
Rym: See, I don't think the Greek pantheon could win because if it's between the leaders if we bring in the whole pantheon I mean look at this Ragnarok.

1165
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:44,520
Rym: The only thing that can beat the Norse pantheon is the Norse pantheon.

1166
01:03:45,222 --> 01:03:49,715
Rym: So if they if an outsider comes and see the Greeks would fight with each other constantly.

1167
01:03:49,815 --> 01:03:53,887
Rym: Athens and Sparta fought each other Pretty much to destroy all of Greece.

1168
01:03:54,408 --> 01:03:55,712
Rym: and just bullshit and bullshit.

1169
01:03:55,752 --> 01:03:56,875
Rym: and in fighting and whatever.

1170
01:03:57,376 --> 01:03:59,564
Rym: and when enemies came from the outside They'd squabble.

1171
01:04:00,248 --> 01:04:04,170
Scott: when enemies come from the outside Enemies don't come from the outside.

1172
01:04:04,211 --> 01:04:05,920
Scott: the Vikings take it outside on their own.

1173
01:04:07,103 --> 01:04:23,088
Rym: But if the Norse are about to have their Ragnarok and then Zeus and his Pissant army of Greek gods comes like we're gonna start shitting your little pantheon I think that the Giants and the AC and all of them the van They're just gonna come together.

1174
01:04:23,108 --> 01:04:24,693
Rym: None of that Ragnarok stuff.

1175
01:04:24,714 --> 01:04:26,379
Rym: They're gonna kick the Greek pantheon's ass.

1176
01:04:28,505 --> 01:04:28,646
Scott: See.

1177
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:41,540
Scott: the only thing I can say is that you know while Vikings were better than actual Romans in the real world Right when you look at the mythology the Greeks are much better at delegating powers to those below them.

1178
01:04:41,881 --> 01:04:45,054
Scott: They had Hercules they had in Herakles.

1179
01:04:45,074 --> 01:04:46,460
Scott: Yeah, they had Achilles.

1180
01:04:47,222 --> 01:04:53,900
Scott: They had all sorts of bad guys to like Medusa's and they had all kinds of clash of the titans shit going down.

1181
01:04:54,883 --> 01:04:57,911
Scott: Right the Viking gods they kept it all to themselves.

1182
01:04:57,951 --> 01:04:59,235
Scott: They didn't get the Vikings shit.

1183
01:04:59,656 --> 01:05:01,080
Scott: They didn't give them anything.

1184
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,900
Scott: They were just like yeah, we're all powerful and you're Vikings.

1185
01:05:04,121 --> 01:05:08,799
Rym: Yeah, but here's the thing every Norseman who died in battle was waiting in Valhalla.

1186
01:05:09,482 --> 01:05:14,600
Rym: So when the Greeks come how many Vikings do you think are standing there ready to fight along with the gods?

1187
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:21,139
Scott: yeah, and all those Vikings in Valhalla are still sitting around bored waiting and the Greeks are going.

1188
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,443
Rym: ah No, the Greeks are going.

1189
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:24,486
Rym: Oh shit the Romans.

1190
01:05:24,506 --> 01:05:26,009
Rym: Oh shit the Roman.

1191
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:27,834
Scott: Well who did better in the Olympics?

1192
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:29,418
Scott: Greece or Norway?

1193
01:05:29,438 --> 01:05:36,212
Rym: I Don't know Depends on when I mean in the old Olympics.

1194
01:05:36,352 --> 01:05:38,780
Rym: Well, I don't think the people from Norway were competing.

1195
01:05:39,882 --> 01:05:41,026
Scott: Oh, I wonder why that is.

1196
01:05:41,086 --> 01:05:42,350
Scott: Maybe they couldn't stand up.

1197
01:05:42,892 --> 01:05:45,020
Scott: Why did this turn into Greek verse Norway?

1198
01:05:45,801 --> 01:05:50,270
Rym: Oh, you know we have concluded Regardless of who would win the Greek pantheon or the Norse pantheon.

1199
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:50,872
Rym: We know this.

1200
01:05:51,434 --> 01:05:53,520
Rym: Odin and Zeus could beat class Joe.
