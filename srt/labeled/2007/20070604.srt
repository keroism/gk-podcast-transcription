1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,538
Rym: It's Monday June 4th.

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,541
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:15,350
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:21,590
Rym: Tonight we make our triumphant return with my new computer and media playing software.

5
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:36,190
Rym: Let's do this Back in business coming to you live from the depths of my brand new computer that finally freaking works.

6
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:39,483
Rym: I'm I'm really pleased with this thing.

7
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:45,003
Rym: It's I Don't think I can really describe it in any terms other than stupidly fast.

8
00:00:45,263 --> 00:00:47,450
Scott: Yeah, I mean I had that core to do at work.

9
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,636
Scott: That's still stupidly faster than any computer.

10
00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:55,216
Scott: I've ever used and this computer is even faster ran into a few problems Getting it going.

11
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:57,228
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about those in any great detail.

12
00:00:57,248 --> 00:01:03,929
Rym: eventually I'll try to a show about the ordeal of the new computer and the things that are taking us off about the computer industry right now.

13
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:18,184
Rym: But suffice to say the last problem that we had to resolve was that a lot of Podcasts use out there use a lot of different programs to make their little podcasts And I'm of the opinion that most of those programs suck.

14
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:20,010
Scott: Well, they suck for pod.

15
00:01:20,152 --> 00:01:21,110
Rym: Oh, yeah, they're great.

16
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,430
Rym: If you want to make techno you want to mix or master music you want to make an audio drama?

17
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:28,666
Rym: You want to make a music video anything like that?

18
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:29,110
Rym: They're great.

19
00:01:29,452 --> 00:01:44,177
Rym: yeah, if you want to record one or two channels of Talking and then process then yes And then process them directly and edit them directly and filter them and cut them up into you know Remove coughs and things like that.

20
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:46,970
Rym: now in that case there those programs are still okay.

21
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:53,574
Rym: They do those things, but if you also want to do it often and in a timely fashion They're not good at that.

22
00:01:53,755 --> 00:02:05,506
Rym: There's really only one program that's worth a dick and that's resound and are cool at it Or the old cool at it, but I guess audition cuz it is cool it yeah, but maybe that's so anything we've never used.

23
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:10,238
Rym: actually I When I in first installed windows I got a bunch of wares.

24
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:17,044
Rym: is just to look at all those proprietary Expensive audio things and the new versions of audition are kind of I don't like him.

25
00:02:17,064 --> 00:02:19,030
Rym: Yeah audition 1.5.

26
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,685
Rym: I liked a lot better, but it had less functionality than cool at it.

27
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,589
Rym: They took some stuff out.

28
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:26,844
Rym: Granted they took out some things that weren't so useful too.

29
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:33,869
Rym: So it wasn't just Yeah, I'm not gonna pretend that cool that it was like the end-all be-all but cool that it was a really good program.

30
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:35,695
Scott: the thing With resound is like, okay.

31
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:40,410
Scott: It's like the only program that does what we need, but it's an old and busted program.

32
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,675
Scott: It just barely works.

33
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:44,868
Scott: It's funny works enough that it beats everything else.

34
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:48,149
Rym: Yep I mean, it's kind of cluttered and it definitely looks old.

35
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:49,548
Scott: It looks like a piece of shit.

36
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:58,429
Rym: But because I think because the person who makes it it's maintained as far as I can tell by this one, dude He updated in January who's really into audio.

37
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:05,433
Rym: So this guy makes this kind of for fun and there's a lot of algorithms and filters and things That are in here.

38
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:13,962
Rym: just because he's playing around with audio and a lot of his experiments have ended up being very useful to me I think it just needs to be rewritten which I might do one day.

39
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:15,830
Rym: Yeah, I like to talk to this guy.

40
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,539
Rym: Actually, I should try to bother him.

41
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:18,725
Scott: You should try to contact him.

42
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:19,409
Scott: get him on the show.

43
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:20,677
Rym: I'd love to get him on the show.

44
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:24,232
Rym: I'd be like, I'm probably the only dude using your program Now.

45
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:26,843
Rym: I know other people are but I don't think anyone is podcast.

46
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:28,710
Scott: it's like no one's respecting the program.

47
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:34,070
Scott: It's like because I don't know if there must because remember we complained so much in that garage band episode.

48
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,270
Scott: We got the Mac how garage band sucked.

49
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:46,322
Scott: Well, apparently I'm checking out these other programs and that are similar in their functionality That a lot of people are using like Joe kosher and audacity and all such.

50
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:48,970
Scott: they're all the same as a garage band.

51
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,357
Scott: It's not garage band like.

52
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:52,970
Scott: maybe it is garage bands fault because maybe they're copying garage band.

53
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,270
Scott: But how do people consider that to be a good way?

54
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,230
Rym: I mean it is a good way if you're making one thing or you're making music.

55
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:07,970
Rym: But if you're recording, you know I should like say you did a show every night you did something constantly over and over and over again.

56
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:14,955
Rym: those those interfaces at their fundamental level are not as efficient as resound and cool edit.

57
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:21,822
Rym: in fact resounds even beaten cool edit in a lot of ways because you know It's had I don't know another eight years of development and it's free.

58
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:23,467
Rym: Yeah free helps a lot.

59
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:24,892
Rym: freeze good I don't know.

60
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,659
Rym: I think now that I have the new computer.

61
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:36,925
Rym: I'm probably going to make videos of Me editing the show in resound Compared to me editing the show in garage band and audacity and all these other programs.

62
00:04:37,186 --> 00:04:38,390
Scott: Yeah, get the eggs vid cap go.

63
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:45,949
Rym: Yeah I want to make like a comparison and put it on YouTube and see if there's something I'm missing or maybe Everyone else in the world is.

64
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:53,406
Rym: The rest of the world was gonna make a Napoleonic war analogy, but never mind I think the rest of the world just sucks it doing podcast editing and such.

65
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,493
Rym: Yeah All right.

66
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:58,762
Rym: Anyway, the computer's badass the heart.

67
00:04:59,002 --> 00:04:59,403
Rym: I love it.

68
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:01,990
Rym: That's all I can say took goddamn long enough.

69
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:05,769
Scott: It took me a while to figure I actually think there's the last thing Did.

70
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:19,149
Rym: The only thing that I had trouble with really like the biggest thing was that I mean when I name a computer It's always a big deal because I don't buy new computers often

71
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:20,374
Scott: Yeah,

72
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:27,764
Rym: and I didn't actually think about what I was going to name it for when I built the first computer I decided what to name it like six months before I bought it.

73
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:34,348
Rym: this one I'm sitting at the Windows install prop and it's what do you want to call your computer?

74
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:34,690
Rym: and I go?

75
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:47,800
Scott: crap Yeah, and basically we sort of we sort of fell into because you know You have to have a theme for naming like this computer lab is gonna be all Thundercats So this computer lab is gonna be all Douglas Adams.

76
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,770
Scott: So this computer lab is gonna be all Star Wars, right?

77
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,528
Scott: Yeah, well with our house.

78
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:58,290
Scott: We sort of didn't pick a theme and we just called our computers by our screen names and that was it.

79
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,093
Rym: Well, we'll go in order.

80
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,222
Rym: My computer was Chazar and Scott's was a fresh.

81
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:05,620
Rym: Yep, and our server was server Yep, and then we got the media PC.

82
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:05,942
Scott: We got them.

83
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:07,367
Scott: Oh, yeah the media PC.

84
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:07,990
Scott: What do we call that?

85
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,215
Rym: We called that div as well.

86
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:13,030
Scott: Oh, yeah, we called it div as in the little DVD player in penny arcade.

87
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:14,496
Scott: So that was an accurate name.

88
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:18,071
Scott: That is why we chose that name because it was accurate to the function Yep.

89
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:19,497
Rym: Also, we like penny arcade.

90
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:30,810
Rym: So yeah, and since the Mac Mini is in the living room now, we call that div Yep, and then we got another computer That's little and boxy and looks like a character from Ghost in the Shell and we had just been watching Ghost in the Shell.

91
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:32,220
Rym: So we called it Jameson.

92
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:34,954
Scott: Yep, just like CEO Jameson.

93
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:37,863
Rym: Yeah, who's my second favorite character in Ghost in the Shell?

94
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,970
Scott: and then I got a laptop recently.

95
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:45,854
Scott: So I called it Robita and I said I'm gonna start a Tezuka theme Yep, and I was gonna.

96
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:50,423
Scott: I was gonna name some other computers like denouba and hallelujah and all that stuff Yep.

97
00:06:51,052 --> 00:07:05,555
Scott: But then now that kind of breaks because we have div and we have all these other things and we realize that the theme of our computers is machines and robots from anime and manga and comics and Whatever video games.

98
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:11,430
Rym: so I thought about what I wanted to name this one and I put a lot of thought into it because I Didn't want to break from this theme because I like this theme.

99
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:17,512
Scott: Yeah, it's got to be some sort of robot or machine from something geeky if it's a video game anime Whatever.

100
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:20,750
Rym: and then I realized well Scott mentioned about he was saying a bunch.

101
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:27,275
Scott: I was just going through every frickin computer and robot from anime manga and comics Games I could think of.

102
00:07:27,536 --> 00:07:33,959
Rym: and the one that stuck the one that I think was perfect is a character from an anime that a lot of people out there haven't seen.

103
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:41,289
Rym: and just so happens that that character was a normal guy who Ended up transferring his intelligence or his soul into a ship.

104
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:47,728
Rym: Yep, and it works even better because he has a little sidekick that I can now name my iPod.

105
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:53,623
Rym: that oh That's clever, however, I had to look up what that sidekicks name was.

106
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,009
Rym: it wasn't as cool as I thought it was.

107
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,689
Rym: no It's not no no cuz I didn't know what its name was.

108
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:00,230
Rym: So I looked it up, but I'm kind of I used to do that.

109
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:03,129
Scott: I used to know the name and then I forgot it, but if you say it, I'll remember it again.

110
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:06,307
Rym: Yeah I'm gonna save that for anime day because no one today cares.

111
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:09,060
Rym: no Suffice to say it is a character from an anime.

112
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:14,390
Rym: if anyone out there can guess based on the nothing I've given you I'm pretty sure someone's gonna know it right away.

113
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:15,073
Rym: I hope so.

114
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:16,419
Rym: cuz we gave him pretty much.

115
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:17,303
Scott: Gerald knows it.

116
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:18,629
Rym: of course Gerald knows it.

117
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,740
Rym: Of course germs, but I thinking no it can't be that obvious.

118
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:23,727
Rym: No, it is that obvious.

119
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:27,904
Scott: Yeah, maybe If you you either know it or you don't it's either gonna be.

120
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:28,809
Scott: oh, that's what it is.

121
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:31,487
Scott: There's no one else who transferred their mind into into a ship.

122
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:38,049
Scott: Well, there are but it couldn't be that because whatever there's this one that's above all others.

123
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:45,773
Rym: Anyway, that's my news because nothing else in the world really happened as far as tech is concerned in my book because I haven't been On the internet.

124
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:49,570
Rym: I spent the last four days on this computer working on it and not reading Fark.

125
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:56,530
Scott: Yeah, well there are bigger tech news is than my tech news But this is the one that I can talk the most about even though I've talked about it on the show before.

126
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,601
Scott: Basically, there are some lobbyists out there in Washington.

127
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:04,090
Scott: I'm not sure if they're in Washington DC or in state.

128
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,114
Rym: There's lobbyists.

129
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:09,150
Scott: Yes in DC, I guess but they're good lobbyists for us.

130
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:23,512
Scott: Anyway, because what they want to do is they're trying to push laws in many states that will Mandate the use of open document format and other similar formats for Government stuff.

131
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:31,213
Scott: what this means is let's say you are I don't know the town clerk and You have the.

132
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:39,130
Scott: I don't know the Application for zoning change and it's a Microsoft document file.

133
00:09:39,731 --> 00:09:58,676
Scott: that means if somebody wants to access their government and Their democratic government and apply for a zoning change they need Microsoft Office a Proprietary for-profit paid-for program that you have to go out and get and pay money for.

134
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:05,159
Scott: that's basically the same As saying if you want to drive on the road that your tax money paid for you have to drive a Ford.

135
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:07,279
Scott: There's no other car will go on the road.

136
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:12,380
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I don't think we really need to explain to all of you why this is a big deal.

137
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:35,631
Scott: So the people who are pushing open document format are saying hey you need to make all sure all government digital Documents are in a format that anyone can use Freely without having to buy shit and also that the advantage of having a be in an open format is you know It's probably not gonna happen but on paper, you know the government Microsoft could like hold the government by the balls.

138
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:45,140
Scott: or you know in the future if Microsoft doesn't, you know make certain software then government documents will be lost or not unable to be accessed.

139
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:51,636
Rym: There's also a much more simple Motivation here once the government is using Microsoft Office stuff.

140
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:52,800
Rym: They're tied to that.

141
00:10:53,281 --> 00:11:04,500
Rym: So whenever a new version of Microsoft Office comes out once anyone upgrades Everyone has to upgrade because you all know that Microsoft Office very much likes to be incompatible with older versions of Microsoft Office.

142
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,557
Scott: Yep, so now the government has to keep spending money on Microsoft Office and give money to Microsoft forever.

143
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:10,520
Scott: and blabbity blabbity blah.

144
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:19,959
Scott: So this lobbyists that are on our side and they're pushing to get ODF pat that laws mandating open document format in many states.

145
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:30,040
Scott: meanwhile Microsoft and IBM have some lobbyists pushing from the other side and So far we've lost in six states.

146
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:33,978
Rym: Well, I think it doesn't help that we don't have as much money as them.

147
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:37,070
Scott: Well, we got something we're actually lobbying which is good.

148
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,652
Scott: We got a lot.

149
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:38,796
Scott: We got a bill written.

150
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:41,486
Scott: That's a step We got somewhere.

151
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:45,098
Rym: Yeah, but a lot of bills get written and a lot of bills appear out there.

152
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:47,724
Rym: It doesn't mean Yeah, yeah.

153
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:51,960
Scott: Anyway, there's one line from this little slash top blurb that I think is pretty funny.

154
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:59,783
Scott: It says there was heavy lobbying being done in private on both sides with one problem being the jargon laden Disinformation.

155
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:04,360
Scott: that committee members felt they were being fed by lobbyists for both IBM and Microsoft.

156
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:12,658
Scott: Although lobbyists would tell the committee one thing in private They got cold feet when asked to verify that information publicly under oath, huh?

157
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,960
Scott: In other words these IBM and Microsoft guys are basically lying lying and bullshitting to the congressman.

158
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,796
Scott: The congressman are smart enough to see through it, but they're still voting now.

159
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:26,900
Rym: There's the problem.

160
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,940
Rym: They're smart enough to see through that but they still don't understand the underlying issue.

161
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,126
Scott: I think that's the problem is.

162
00:12:33,146 --> 00:12:38,260
Rym: I doubt that any congressman involved actually has any idea of what the issue really is.

163
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:40,512
Scott: No, I think that there was one guy.

164
00:12:40,532 --> 00:12:43,162
Scott: I remember watching a Like.

165
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:52,818
Scott: it was like a c-span video from like a congrats US congressional committee meeting About like digital radio and HD radio stuff and the DRM and all that jazz.

166
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,733
Scott: and of course, you know The Ted Stevens was there and whatever.

167
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:59,751
Scott: but there was one guy One congressman on the side and he would like.

168
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:07,084
Scott: he was just sitting on the side somewhere and no one else was saying anything Except him Ted Ted Stevens and the people before the committee Talking about radio.

169
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:12,580
Scott: and this guy kept chiming in and he knew what was up and he was some congressman in the US government.

170
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,303
Scott: I don't know who he is.

171
00:13:13,363 --> 00:13:16,175
Rym: But I think the question the operative question is how old is he?

172
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:17,300
Scott: He wasn't too old.

173
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,412
Scott: He was 40 something maybe 30 something 40 something.

174
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,646
Scott: Ah Relatively young.

175
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:31,660
Scott: Yeah relatively not gray hair Yeah, but so if there's one in the federal government there's got to be at least one in each state.

176
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:41,458
Rym: I guess see the reason that one is not enough though I mean on one hand I this always bothers me and when I was younger I was always more and more outraged about this sort of thing than I am now.

177
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:57,375
Rym: and If I look back through history It seems like every bad thing our government in the United States does every time there's a problem with the government not Understanding something or not dealing with something properly the problem especially when it comes to social issues though.

178
00:13:57,395 --> 00:13:59,160
Rym: I think technology is also right up there.

179
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:07,500
Rym: Regardless of whatever happens or what lobbying is done or whatever laws anything the problem gets resolved as a direct correlation.

180
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:22,193
Rym: With old congressman dying and new congressman coming in and the generations changing hands It seems like every generation that gets into Congress fixes the problems that they cared about The previous generation when they were kids and Congress was bothering them.

181
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:24,862
Rym: They don't care about the new kids issues Mm-hmm.

182
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:26,990
Scott: I think that's gonna be a bigger.

183
00:14:27,091 --> 00:14:29,460
Scott: It was a big problem, you know, pretty much always.

184
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:38,220
Scott: but I think it's a bigger problem now because Things change so freakin fast and the government is just as slow as it was in 18.

185
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,015
Rym: Oh, yeah a long time ago.

186
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:42,447
Rym: in some ways I think it was a benefit because it did keep.

187
00:14:42,768 --> 00:14:47,328
Rym: the one nice thing about our government is that it's slow enough to keep bad Things from happening in a hurry.

188
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:58,375
Rym: Yeah, it keeps good things from happening in a hurry But as the world learned from Rome and the Byzantine Empire The more good things can happen in a hurry the more bad things can happen in a hurry.

189
00:14:58,516 --> 00:14:59,218
Scott: That is good.

190
00:14:59,278 --> 00:14:59,880
Scott: That is correct.

191
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:11,059
Scott: However, now bad things that are you know, of course bad things that aren't a result of laws But a result of the nature of the world are happening a lot faster than we can ever stop them.

192
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:29,779
Scott: So While We are not making bad things happen with Making bad laws and we're not making good things happen very quickly by making good laws and it's just going at the steady pace Bad things are happening and we're just on their own and not too many good things are happening on their own.

193
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:33,228
Rym: relative Well plus look how fast technology is advancing.

194
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:41,274
Rym: think about how different the world is and the internet is technologically From two years ago even two years ago.

195
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:42,760
Rym: The internet was a different place.

196
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:43,760
Scott: There was no YouTube.

197
00:15:44,162 --> 00:15:44,804
Rym: In fact think of this.

198
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:50,144
Rym: the internet has changed more in the last two years than it did in like eight years before that and the 16 years before that.

199
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:57,070
Scott: Yep, and the old fogies in Congress can't keep up and Eventually, it's gonna fuck us all.

200
00:15:57,271 --> 00:16:01,599
Rym: and it's not even really a question of the old fogies It's a question of society is getting to the point where?

201
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,840
Rym: Things change so rapidly that people you fall out of the loop like that in an instant.

202
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:14,231
Scott: I really think there's gonna be a point maybe later in our lives where There are gonna be people who can't keep up and people who can't.

203
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:19,407
Scott: and the people who can't are gonna start to look a lot Like cavemen to the people who can.

204
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,631
Scott: and we're really gonna.

205
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:27,370
Scott: it's sort of gonna be like Gundam with like new types and not New types in or you know, what do they call it?

206
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:30,420
Rym: Well, I guess one thing yeah that normals humans.

207
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,192
Rym: Yeah, humans and you didn't know the word for human.

208
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:33,312
Rym: No.

209
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:38,223
Scott: No the other word the the one that you don't call it New typing Gundam seed they call it a Coordinator.

210
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:40,671
Scott: Yeah, I think it's really gonna be like that.

211
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:50,259
Scott: where it's like there are people that are just Below others because they're in the society because they just can't interact with it because they don't know how.

212
00:16:50,620 --> 00:17:00,520
Rym: well I think it's going to be exactly the same as it is with literacy, you know At least in the Western world where currently being illiterate is a crippling handicap

213
00:17:00,862 --> 00:17:02,835
Scott: Yeah, and worse than not having any legs

214
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:20,771
Rym: and being Technologically incompetent or technologically out of the loop while bad and causes a lot of problems Does not remove you from society the way illiteracy does but it will yes I really think within I don't even say within our lifetime I think within the decade maybe maybe two decades,

215
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:26,694
Scott: but I think it's actually gonna be worse you see because Illiterate people can't read or write but you can still talk to them.

216
00:17:27,217 --> 00:17:27,980
Scott: They speak English.

217
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,265
Scott: We're gonna get to the point.

218
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:32,640
Scott: or they speak whatever language from whatever country they're from they can speak in here.

219
00:17:33,242 --> 00:17:41,333
Scott: I think it's gonna get to a point and maybe like, you know when we're 70 or 80 where you just can't even talk to them They're just they cannot communicate.

220
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:42,440
Rym: I'm starting to see that now.

221
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:48,592
Rym: I mean sadly, I don't talk to my family nearly as much as I would like to Because I just don't think to pick up a phone.

222
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:49,980
Rym: I'm just online all the time.

223
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:55,080
Scott: Yeah, I mean Pete my grandma keeps complaining like why don't you call me and then she IM is me?

224
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,271
Scott: But I hate to instant message her because she sucks at instant messaging.

225
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:58,853
Scott: It's painful.

226
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:00,720
Rym: or like look at businesses.

227
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,806
Rym: Here's a big example in my life.

228
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:14,717
Rym: as far as I can see if a place of business doesn't have a web presence if I Can't find them on the internet and I don't happen to pass by them on my way to somewhere else that I did find on The internet it doesn't exist.

229
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:22,326
Rym: there could be the best restaurant in the world in my town and I would never know it was there if it wasn't on the Internet or if I did.

230
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,819
Rym: I mean it's right now geeks like us.

231
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:25,551
Rym: You know the.

232
00:18:25,674 --> 00:18:40,974
Rym: you know There's the the curve of innovators early adopters and all that the long tail of people pick it up later the earliest adopters and the innovators right now that like the uber geeks and the people well beyond us because there are people well Beyond us in terms of adopting new technology super

233
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,360
Scott: beyond us mostly people with money.

234
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:45,080
Rym: They look at us the way we look at people who don't own computers.

235
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:59,146
Rym: Yep But people like us are starting to semi voluntarily cut ourselves off from a lot of the world Just by nature of the way we communicate and the way we interact and the way we live and What the way it works is.

236
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,276
Rym: society eventually always follows the early adopters.

237
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:03,039
Rym: It just takes time.

238
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:09,580
Rym: Eventually most of society is gonna be where we are and we'll be off somewhere stupid doing our own whatever technology crap.

239
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:16,000
Scott: But I think that the society always catches up with the early adopters at the same rate the rate of which people learn things.

240
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:20,920
Scott: But the early adopters are gonna go faster and faster and faster to accelerate faster and faster.

241
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,081
Scott: So

242
00:19:21,101 --> 00:19:42,260
Rym: I think what's gonna happen is we're gonna have a longer and a longer tail for a long time for at least the next decade where there's gonna be this long long gradient and Society is gonna keep getting more connected Until a point where I think what Scott brought up is gonna happen and I don't know where the line will be But there's eventually going to be a line where people are just outside of society.

243
00:19:42,804 --> 00:19:53,400
Scott: Yeah, we sort of like, you know I don't know people walking around Like hooked into cyberspace and then people walking around in the meat world and it's actually different.

244
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:54,280
Rym: What was it called?

245
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,301
Rym: Emily just told me about an anime that just came out that we got to check out Where.

246
00:19:58,683 --> 00:20:04,920
Rym: the idea is that the internet is everywhere now that there goes in the show not even not like that But there's transponders everywhere, right?

247
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:12,298
Rym: And if you put on glasses, you can just interact with this and see it so you can have a virtual Follows you around or yeah stuff like that.

248
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:12,921
Rym: They live.

249
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:24,344
Rym: so people who are in with this and where the glasses live in the same physical world as people who do not But actually live in an entirely different Effective world.

250
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:27,860
Rym: they're in a world that is completely alien to people who don't use this technology.

251
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:31,960
Scott: Yeah, and of course this all assumes that nothing crazy happens.

252
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:36,520
Rym: Yes, as long as there's no global thermonuclear war or a similar event.

253
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:44,983
Rym: Now my fear is that a lot of people might fall out of the loop just because the leaders of their countries are Holding them back.

254
00:20:45,064 --> 00:20:49,600
Rym: I mean, it's not any given North Koreans fault that they're out of the loop technologically.

255
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,259
Rym: No, it's not but there's no way they can get in the loop.

256
00:20:52,561 --> 00:21:01,500
Scott: But what might happen is their whole country will fall out of the world loop And it that's the end of the whole country right there or like large parts of Africa or even South America.

257
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:12,760
Rym: that's why I really it seems like education and the spreading of technology and Information and connectivity is the best thing we can do for nations that are having trouble outside of you know.

258
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:20,425
Scott: First obviously food and security and that's why they're doing that stuff for like the ol PCs and all that stuff Yep, or even Ubuntu.

259
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,334
Scott: Yeah, but they're not it's not they're not doing it.

260
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:25,080
Rym: So well, well, it's hard to do.

261
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:31,920
Rym: I mean How do you convince someone who is trying to get food to eat to live one more day that they should be on the internet?

262
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:43,108
Scott: Because if they learn how to use the computer they can you know right now They'll go five days hungry and then every other day for the rest of their lives They'll get twice as much food as they've had before.

263
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:47,965
Rym: the problem is I still think the immediate Maslow Opportunity cost is too great.

264
00:21:47,985 --> 00:21:48,748
Rym: for a lot of people.

265
00:21:48,768 --> 00:21:52,703
Rym: it is and I can't blame anyone but the leaders of their countries at this Point.

266
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:55,865
Rym: Yep, but that that To talk anymore about.

267
00:21:55,905 --> 00:22:00,400
Scott: then you could say that people in there in a country the population.

268
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,066
Scott: You can't blame the leaders.

269
00:22:02,106 --> 00:22:06,060
Scott: may even if the leaders like some monarch is the people could rise up and do something.

270
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:10,160
Rym: But and then if you go full circle the people can't rise up unless they're connected.

271
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,834
Rym: Otherwise, there's no way to organize but they can't.

272
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:13,739
Scott: people have done it.

273
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,520
Scott: You know there was rising up going on hundreds of years ago.

274
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,679
Rym: Rising ups were always due to people having some measure of secure connection to where they could organize it.

275
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:35,220
Rym: Yeah And that's actually being harder to do because a long time ago when there are revolutions in the US or in France or wherever The world there wasn't so much surveillance and it wasn't that hard to secretly put something together.

276
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:50,938
Rym: But now people who are in power have so much more power relative to people who aren't in power that it's so much more difficult to rise up against them except Geeks and people in the modern world because we have encryption that the government's can't keep up with.

277
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,332
Scott: Yep Yeah I guess if the actual leader of the country does is like.

278
00:22:55,452 --> 00:23:08,895
Scott: I was kind of assuming the whole country was technology Technologically deficient, but if you're a king with mad computers and all your people are peasants They're pretty much permanently oppressed I mean unless they physically run away and you didn't catch them.

279
00:23:09,176 --> 00:23:15,940
Rym: from what I read I am sure that the elite and the aristocracy and the government of North Korea are connected to the Internet.

280
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:20,652
Rym: Yeah, probably and know about the world, but because they have that power.

281
00:23:20,893 --> 00:23:23,580
Rym: There's no way anyone in their country could do anything.

282
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,080
Scott: Nope.

283
00:23:24,381 --> 00:23:24,681
Scott: All right.

284
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:33,050
Rym: I think we're done things of the day.

285
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:35,885
Rym: So we were talking over the weekend.

286
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:37,353
Rym: I'll get to it I'll get to it.

287
00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:40,090
Rym: scotch is a chin to bring this one up because this is a good thing of the day.

288
00:23:41,012 --> 00:23:55,559
Rym: We were joking about the tally of people we know who give us things of the day and the frontrunners are like Idaho gives us a lot and actually Emily gives us a lot and a few of the listeners send us some and we've got a General idea of who gives us good things of the day.

289
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:57,306
Scott: Most of them come from dig.

290
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:05,538
Scott: dig gives us Yes, but in terms of not actually humans who give us stuff Yeah, most of the time though it's us finding it on the internet but there are.

291
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:06,782
Scott: we do get them from people

292
00:24:06,943 --> 00:24:11,878
Rym: and luckily the ones we get from people are usually the good ones because they're not on dig or and

293
00:24:11,978 --> 00:24:20,690
Scott: also because if someone gives them to us like that and it's something it's Either we've already seen that or those are the aren't people who spend all day on the internet.

294
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:27,508
Scott: So when they find something it's because that's something kind of came around to them and their specific way which matters a lot.

295
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:28,370
Rym: because while?

296
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:33,350
Rym: We're connected to the slash-dot dig, you know the technorati of the world and all that?

297
00:24:33,992 --> 00:24:34,474
Rym: We're not can?

298
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:38,370
Rym: there are two communities on the internet that we are not connected to every other community.

299
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,319
Scott: We're not connected to who.

300
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,289
Rym: I'm connected to a lot

301
00:24:40,532 --> 00:24:43,615
Scott: Yeah, we're not connected to every community on the internet But to well,

302
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:57,858
Rym: but the ones that matter to us the ones that would give us things of the day Yeah, and and also the ones that are big Okay, and of the big ones we're not connected to the live journal community, which is like this insular Closed community of

303
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,622
Scott: people.

304
00:24:58,803 --> 00:25:00,250
Scott: It's not really inserting clothes.

305
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,049
Rym: Yes It's the God.

306
00:25:01,712 --> 00:25:04,700
Rym: Go in there the the inside jokes that spark.

307
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:10,289
Rym: like every now and then a joke pops out a live journal and it's usually really Funny or it's some kind of lolcat thing or whatever.

308
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:15,927
Rym: but they circulate in live journal for a long time before they ever make it to dig.

309
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:20,304
Rym: hmm and We miss out on a lot of those too long after the fact.

310
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:24,963
Rym: so Corbin Showed us this and I just come to get right to it.

311
00:25:25,445 --> 00:25:26,430
Rym: Should I just play the whole thing?

312
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,216
Scott: I don't know if you need to play the whole thing.

313
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:30,185
Rym: All right, uh, I'll sum it up.

314
00:25:30,627 --> 00:25:43,728
Rym: a guy Made a little song for his daughter who was frustrated with people She has to deal with at work and the song goes a little something like this About to whip somebody's ass.

315
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,887
Rym: About to whip somebody's ass.

316
00:25:53,748 --> 00:26:05,989
Rym: Oh If you don't leave me alone You're gonna have to send me home cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass.

317
00:26:12,012 --> 00:26:12,775
Rym: Really like it.

318
00:26:12,855 --> 00:26:13,698
Rym: I just it fits.

319
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:15,263
Rym: I feel good about that song.

320
00:26:15,564 --> 00:26:17,070
Scott: I feel real good about that song.

321
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,215
Scott: Awesome song.

322
00:26:18,255 --> 00:26:21,450
Scott: the guy's a musical talent and he recorded it pretty high quality.

323
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:24,570
Rym: Now that made me laugh a little bit of lolcat in me Yeah.

324
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:33,683
Rym: Then one thing led to another and an unrelated human being elsewhere in the world Took that and made a techno remix.

325
00:26:33,723 --> 00:26:35,430
Rym: That is actually pretty badass.

326
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:37,777
Rym: I'm not gonna play an example here.

327
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:38,520
Rym: Just listen to it.

328
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,704
Rym: It's really worth listening to.

329
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:41,190
Rym: I also know that's really.

330
00:26:41,692 --> 00:26:42,817
Rym: That's the kind of dance music.

331
00:26:42,857 --> 00:26:44,866
Rym: I like I like to dance to that stuff.

332
00:26:44,947 --> 00:26:46,915
Scott: Yeah, it's good music Alright, so I want to.

333
00:26:46,975 --> 00:26:49,968
Scott: I want to get this straight here cuz this is how Corbin tells me the story.

334
00:26:49,988 --> 00:26:54,000
Scott: you ready Guy makes song for daughter, right?

335
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:58,992
Scott: Probably heard that she was frustrated at work over the telephone Records.

336
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:01,842
Scott: song with microphone into computer.

337
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:03,930
Scott: put song on internet.

338
00:27:04,532 --> 00:27:06,360
Scott: People on internet find song.

339
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:11,599
Scott: some guy who makes a video podcast Found the song and played it on his show.

340
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:21,110
Scott: people who listen who watch that video podcast Right all over the world made remixes of the song and sent them back to the video podcast guy.

341
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:26,590
Scott: The video podcast guy then asked if they could find out where the original singing guy was.

342
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:27,737
Scott: They found him.

343
00:27:27,918 --> 00:27:28,925
Rym: in two days.

344
00:27:28,986 --> 00:27:38,430
Scott: two days The video podcast guy went to the guy who sang the song with a CD full of the remixes Interviewed him on the video podcast.

345
00:27:39,216 --> 00:27:41,130
Scott: They put the remixes up on the website.

346
00:27:41,972 --> 00:27:46,083
Scott: Some guy named Corbin saw it showed it to some people named Rym and Scott.

347
00:27:46,103 --> 00:27:55,124
Scott: people named Rym and Scott got it made an audio Podcast right put that on the internet and whoever you are is now listening to that.

348
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:59,735
Rym: and when you tell someone about this That how many layers is that?

349
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:03,023
Rym: the meta levels of this are astounding.

350
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,386
Rym: This is the world we live in.

351
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:09,493
Scott: It's basically almost Godlike omniscience.

352
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:10,858
Rym: I say this a lot.

353
00:28:10,878 --> 00:28:11,680
Rym: This has been one of the.

354
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:31,032
Rym: I have a few kicks lately and a bit but lately I really think about the fact that compared to the vast majority of Human beings that have ever existed as far as we know in the history of the planet Earth We right now myself and Scott and all of you listening are Gods.

355
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:34,044
Rym: compared to them we live out what we just did.

356
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:35,450
Scott: think about it for real.

357
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,855
Scott: Look at the bigness of it.

358
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:48,330
Scott: Like you look at the stars in space and you see you like you think about how it Ludicrously large it is with these stars billions of light-years apart and the light that took a billion years to shine down on you.

359
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:49,959
Scott: This is like one.

360
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,568
Scott: This is half a step under that.

361
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,512
Rym: Grock.

362
00:28:52,552 --> 00:28:54,959
Rym: the home is here grock the fullness.

363
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,343
Scott: Holy shit.

364
00:28:57,285 --> 00:28:58,910
Rym: I mean, what kind of world do we live in?

365
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:06,190
Rym: There's a good chance that at some point along that chain That audio went into space and came back from a satellite.

366
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:07,229
Scott: Think of that.

367
00:29:07,782 --> 00:29:19,062
Rym: Yeah So that is my thing of the day that we are at this moment compared to the vast host of humanity that has ever existed Living unto likened unto gods.

368
00:29:19,363 --> 00:29:27,881
Scott: and you know, we use that godlike power for singing about whipping people's asses About a do thing of the day.

369
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,367
Rym: Okay, that wasn't so great.

370
00:29:29,427 --> 00:29:29,769
Rym: Damn it.

371
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:35,450
Scott: So We talked about encryptions before one or two times.

372
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:38,506
Rym: I think we did a whole show on it semi recently David me.

373
00:29:38,606 --> 00:29:39,330
Scott: I don't really remember.

374
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:44,352
Scott: I don't remember if I've even talked about this thing on the show before but I searched and I'm pretty sure it wasn't a thing Of the day.

375
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:48,110
Rym: we did do a show on how encryption works on a basic level, right?

376
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,534
Rym: there is a Firefox

377
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:59,356
Scott: extension that I've been using for a while called fire GPG and GPG is basically can do privacy Guard I don't know exactly

378
00:29:59,457 --> 00:30:02,305
Rym: as the open source equivalent of PGP,

379
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:10,890
Scott: which is pretty good privacy and That allowed GPG is basically a program that lets you manage keys and encrypt things very strongly.

380
00:30:11,835 --> 00:30:15,777
Rym: Yep, and by encrypting this member that also includes Signing and signing.

381
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:16,561
Rym: so verify.

382
00:30:16,641 --> 00:30:18,430
Rym: even if you don't encrypt you can still verify.

383
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:29,110
Rym: I am the person who sent this within such an astronomical mathematical certainty that you can be guaranteed It's me or someone held the gun to my head and forced me to sign it for him, right?

384
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:45,610
Scott: Fire GPG is a Firefox extension that incorporates into GPG that allows you to encrypt decrypt sign and verify Text in any text box in your browser and also it integrates with Gmail.

385
00:30:46,172 --> 00:31:09,646
Scott: So what I can do is very easily in my Gmail I can write a Gmail I can click Encrypt and send and it will encrypt my Gmail and send it and then if the person on the other end has fire GPG and I encrypted it with their private key and their put they get it their public key and their fire GPG will automatically Decrypt it and if Google tries to read that email, they'll be like up.

386
00:31:09,707 --> 00:31:10,510
Scott: It's a garbled mess.

387
00:31:11,112 --> 00:31:16,450
Rym: Oh, well now anytime someone takes encryption and makes it trivial to use.

388
00:31:17,072 --> 00:31:27,452
Rym: That makes me happy because I am I used to be a proponent of open internet Mostly because I was in school and every time I had to deal with debugging a problem with an encrypted protocol It sucked.

389
00:31:27,974 --> 00:31:33,270
Rym: but in the real world, I want everyone to encrypt everything when at all possible.

390
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:39,947
Rym: Yep at least when it's in transit not so much on your own computer because I could go on and on about.

391
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:46,875
Rym: I'd like there to be archives of email for the future for generations to study and read and I could do a whole show on that.

392
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:58,243
Rym: but suffice to say I think it's a good idea for everyone to encrypt because encryption will always stay ahead of I guess Decryption that is not authorized barring

393
00:31:58,263 --> 00:32:00,387
Scott: the technological discovery Yes

394
00:32:00,951 --> 00:32:13,648
Rym: but if everyone encrypts even if the encryption is broken or breakable it makes it that much harder for Anyone with malicious intent or any government to put forth the effort to decrypt everything and snoop on all your data.

395
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:15,496
Rym: Yep They're really.

396
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:28,349
Rym: regardless whether or not you believe there's a right to privacy in the United States The fact remains that regardless of whether that right exists anywhere it is your duty to protect your privacy whenever you can by whatever legal means you have available

397
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:41,068
Scott: and Encryption is one of those means that is legally available to you and it up until very recently managing keys and encrypting and decrypting and signing and these things weren't easy to do.

398
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:45,349
Scott: like Sometimes they're easier than others and there are tools you could buy to make it easy.

399
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,877
Rym: Yeah but the easiest it was in high school.

400
00:32:48,037 --> 00:32:58,510
Rym: the best I got it was where I could tell it to automate I could encrypt whatever was In my clipboard, so I typed something put it in the clipboard run the program paste it back out send it.

401
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:02,910
Rym: Yeah, I sent it to had to copy it into the clipboard decrypt it paste it back out.

402
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,783
Scott: Generally, it's a pain in the ass unless someone else sets it up for you.

403
00:33:05,844 --> 00:33:10,490
Scott: now with fire GPG It's pretty freakin easy like damn easy.

404
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:17,569
Scott: So if you're thinking about you know, you know, I don't encrypt or sign all my emails, but sometimes they do.

405
00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:26,801
Rym: Yeah, and actually the only I used to always and the only reason I haven't is that my computer was kind of crappy And I didn't like compiling anything on it.

406
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:30,637
Rym: And now that I have a new computer I'm going to go full-on with my permanent.

407
00:33:30,978 --> 00:33:34,267
Rym: Well semi-permanent GPG signatures of varying lengths.

408
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:35,110
Scott: Sounds good.

409
00:33:35,653 --> 00:33:38,349
Scott: So fire GPG worth installing and setting up.

410
00:33:39,232 --> 00:33:49,595
Rym: So we were inspired to do this show after a conversation Scott had with our friend drag-and-drop over at anime world order a little while ago, yes, you see Someone was complaining.

411
00:33:49,615 --> 00:33:53,447
Scott: Well, actually I they were saying, uh, don't use VLC.

412
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:54,029
Scott: It sucks.

413
00:33:54,190 --> 00:34:03,929
Scott: and I Went and I told them well, yeah, I don't like VLC either I'm not a fan, but there's no reason it shouldn't work unless you fuck up.

414
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:10,409
Rym: Yeah, VLC while it does use a lot of resources it'll play just about any video with almost no effort.

415
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:15,585
Scott: Yep, it'll just might be slow and the interface is kind of cruddy, but it's not that bad.

416
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:16,710
Rym: I don't mind VLC at all.

417
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:17,869
Scott: Yeah, I'm not a fan.

418
00:34:18,652 --> 00:34:29,886
Scott: so I realized that there's a lot of different media playing softwares out there and you know You go and I use people's computers or I see people using their computers and everyone's using something different.

419
00:34:29,906 --> 00:34:35,842
Scott: some people using iTunes People using QuickTime People using Winamp people using widows media player.

420
00:34:35,862 --> 00:34:37,469
Scott: It's people using them play man.

421
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,802
Rym: There was a time when Winamp was the people and all.

422
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:43,551
Scott: yeah, there's people using foobar whatnot right?

423
00:34:43,972 --> 00:34:55,090
Scott: and all everyone uses something different and a lot of 90% of media playing programs suck and People got to learn not to use these crappy ones that they insist on using for whatever reason.

424
00:34:55,411 --> 00:34:58,910
Rym: Well first the brief 30-second history of media playing.

425
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:01,863
Rym: Alright, there was nothing for the longest time.

426
00:35:01,903 --> 00:35:02,546
Rym: There was nothing.

427
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:04,312
Rym: you just couldn't play media If you could.

428
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:08,345
Rym: it was some proprietary like a program that made media appear.

429
00:35:08,365 --> 00:35:12,221
Rym: Yep, then We had multimedia PCs.

430
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,110
Rym: media started appearing everywhere.

431
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:23,278
Scott: Your computer usually would come with a program or two and those programs would be able to play maybe an AVI Which is there was a QuickTime and Windows Media.

432
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:25,304
Scott: AVI's were sort of these competing formats.

433
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:27,150
Rym: Yeah, basically nothing was compatible.

434
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:29,499
Rym: It was almost and you could maybe play a wav file.

435
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:32,350
Scott: That was really short or an eighth file and that was about it.

436
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,809
Rym: Yeah, not that it mattered because you couldn't get any miles anyway.

437
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,999
Rym: Midi yes, I'm doing a show on MIDI.

438
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,589
Scott: Yep, and then win it.

439
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:44,529
Rym: Yep, basically mp3s came about and huh mp3s.

440
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,254
Rym: I wonder how I can play these.

441
00:35:46,635 --> 00:35:48,461
Rym: and then Nelsoft and Winamp.

442
00:35:49,002 --> 00:35:50,848
Scott: There was also real but real sigh.

443
00:35:51,028 --> 00:35:55,143
Rym: Oh god Yeah, I guess I skipped over that on a subconsciously on purpose.

444
00:35:55,304 --> 00:35:55,585
Scott: Yeah.

445
00:35:55,665 --> 00:35:55,926
Scott: Yeah.

446
00:35:56,127 --> 00:36:00,059
Scott: Yeah Real basically real player the original real player.

447
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:07,164
Scott: the idea of it was hey, let's stream video over 14 for modems So it would compress the hell out of video and audio.

448
00:36:07,184 --> 00:36:09,790
Scott: So the quality was Stupidly low.

449
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:18,123
Scott: I mean worse than any podcast you've listened to so bad and You could watch like a tiny tiny video of CNN headline news.

450
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,910
Scott: That was all jerky and low resolution.

451
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:25,545
Rym: I remember watching 30 seconds of Les Miserables and like a 60 by 60 window.

452
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:27,310
Rym: Yes, and that was awesome.

453
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:29,402
Scott: Well, I was in a 640 by 480 monitor.

454
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:30,267
Scott: So it wasn't so bad.

455
00:36:30,307 --> 00:36:32,956
Rym: It looked bigger Yeah, but it was still only 60 pixels.

456
00:36:33,017 --> 00:36:35,985
Rym: How much information is there in 60 pixels of video?

457
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:37,350
Scott: Yeah, and that's how it was.

458
00:36:38,192 --> 00:36:42,507
Rym: So, uh, well real just kind of that company was evil back then like they're.

459
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:44,333
Rym: oh, they're not as bad now But that was bad now.

460
00:36:44,414 --> 00:36:49,814
Rym: They were actually evil and we're trying to take over media on computers But we're not gonna get into that either.

461
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:50,436
Scott: No, we're not.

462
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:55,510
Rym: Winamp pretty much became the gold standard for a long time in media playing.

463
00:36:55,951 --> 00:37:01,106
Scott: Yeah, I mean it could play pretty much any audio file and then it started playing video really?

464
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:07,270
Scott: Well, yeah I mean even when when it was playing video there were other players to use as well.

465
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:19,910
Scott: But Winamp was just as good as the others because in those days like the early days of Divx and MPEG-4 Pretty much, you know, you had trouble with any player you chose and you know Winamp was just as good as the others.

466
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,338
Rym: Yeah, there were competing codecs competing formats.

467
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:25,910
Rym: They still are but back then there was no easy way to install them.

468
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:28,600
Scott: No, it wasn't obvious at least.

469
00:37:29,021 --> 00:37:34,461
Scott: Yeah, like I actually installed I think for a long time I used the Divx player from Divx.com.

470
00:37:34,581 --> 00:37:36,066
Scott: Yeah, which is terrible.

471
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:37,290
Rym: It is pretty terrible.

472
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:38,882
Rym: I gotta say it's horrendous.

473
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,547
Scott: No one should use it.

474
00:37:40,131 --> 00:37:49,470
Rym: So now recently it's not as big a deal anymore And it's pretty easy to get media playing to work as long as you know what programs to use and how to set them up.

475
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,775
Scott: Yeah, I mean a lot of people.

476
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:53,265
Scott: they use just Windows Media Player, which I guess it's.

477
00:37:53,366 --> 00:37:54,350
Scott: it's actually not bad.

478
00:37:54,570 --> 00:38:01,170
Rym: Yeah, I will admit if you're using Vista or modern XP Windows Media Player is not that bad for playing video.

479
00:38:01,431 --> 00:38:11,527
Scott: Yeah, and they use you know QuickTime iTunes on a Mac and then they install you know codecs like directly into their operating system that you know all the different players can take advantage of.

480
00:38:11,888 --> 00:38:20,970
Scott: they get like the CCCP thing they get all the codecs on Windows or whatever and VLC can also just play every freaking video and that works on Windows Mac or Linux.

481
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,860
Scott: so a lot of people use VLC, which I don't like.

482
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:25,005
Scott: it is it's a cry.

483
00:38:25,045 --> 00:38:33,810
Scott: think it's a bad interface and Generally an inefficient program, but it does work and can play it just about any video you've got.

484
00:38:34,252 --> 00:38:38,047
Rym: I don't really worry about efficiency unless I'm near the end of the life cycle of a computer.

485
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:44,150
Rym: Yeah Yeah, plus I mean my old computer M player couldn't even play most things properly just because it was so old and slow.

486
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:44,773
Scott: Yep.

487
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:46,219
Scott: Yeah, basically.

488
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:48,509
Scott: I want to talk a bit about M player.

489
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:52,681
Scott: M-player is the video player the media player.

490
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:58,800
Scott: actually as far as I'm concerned and far as many people are concerned M-player is primarily a Linux app, but it does go on.

491
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:01,389
Scott: we use it on the Mac and you can use it at Windows.

492
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:01,710
Scott: also.

493
00:39:02,691 --> 00:39:05,037
Scott: M-player can fucking play anything.

494
00:39:05,398 --> 00:39:06,842
Scott: god damn it can play anything.

495
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:10,110
Rym: not only that but it actually it's pretty simple to make it work.

496
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:20,086
Rym: It's not as complicated as you might expect But there's a lot of functionality just under the surface if you decide you actually want it But it's not in your way if you don't want it.

497
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:22,014
Scott: Yep It's like with M player.

498
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:22,495
Scott: you can.

499
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:29,545
Scott: you have the ability to like adjust the timing of subtitles if you want to But you don't have to and you won't even know.

500
00:39:29,606 --> 00:39:41,262
Scott: you can do that If you want to just watch videos and listen to music and player does that very easily and it does it with such Clockwork and perfect efficiency that just always works.

501
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:41,883
Scott: It's amazing.

502
00:39:42,204 --> 00:39:44,270
Rym: So Scott say you've got a Windows PC.

503
00:39:44,851 --> 00:39:50,850
Rym: How would you go about installing M player and getting it to play commonly found things on the Pirates Bay or anime ski?

504
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,740
Scott: Well first I would go to the M player website.

505
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,105
Rym: Isn't it M player org?

506
00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:57,774
Scott: It's M player HQ HU.

507
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:01,083
Rym: Oh Yeah, I've never actually been there.

508
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:11,170
Scott: I just go in the repositories Yes, and then I would go to the download page and the download page here says description M player 1.0 RC 1 Windows GUI.

509
00:40:11,772 --> 00:40:16,065
Scott: So I download that and I do the usual business just like it's a program.

510
00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:18,775
Rym: I'd install it now notice GUI It's not like.

511
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:20,060
Rym: it's some weird Linux.

512
00:40:20,482 --> 00:40:22,209
Rym: Oh, you gotta type commands to make it.

513
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:25,970
Scott: well You can also download M player 1 RC Windows, which does not have the goo.

514
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,241
Rym: Yeah, I'd recommend getting the GUI because I'm a Windows user.

515
00:40:29,322 --> 00:40:31,590
Rym: Yeah, or if you're anyone it's nice to have.

516
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:35,530
Scott: Yeah, the thing is I actually like it better without the GUI because it's really simple.

517
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:37,718
Scott: All I do is I find the file.

518
00:40:37,758 --> 00:40:44,950
Scott: I want to play and I say M player Space the file and I push enter and it plays.

519
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:46,598
Scott: That's all I got to do.

520
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:47,889
Scott: It can even play DVDs.

521
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:50,679
Scott: I watch DVDs on the train with M player on my laptop.

522
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:54,894
Scott: M player space DVD colon slash slash Chapter number.

523
00:40:54,914 --> 00:40:56,420
Scott: so chapter 4 and it plays.

524
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,047
Scott: chapter 4 the DVD ba-bam.

525
00:40:58,128 --> 00:40:58,509
Scott: There it is.

526
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:01,410
Scott: So then how do I go about getting the codecs?

527
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,783
Rym: I heard that nothing works unless I get all the like.

528
00:41:03,843 --> 00:41:04,929
Rym: fancy new Divx codecs.

529
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:11,519
Scott: well on the same page where you can download M player if you scroll down a bit, it says Binary codec packages, huh?

530
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:22,621
Scott: And there's a little thing there You can download the binary codec packages and install them and that will allow you to play 99.9% of videos and audios ever.

531
00:41:23,143 --> 00:41:25,530
Rym: So, uh, how do people have problems with this?

532
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:34,389
Scott: because people don't use M player and they use some other crazy video program or They have problems with their computer in general outside of their media player.

533
00:41:34,711 --> 00:41:50,555
Rym: And since a media player is sort of a finicky app in general Screwing up your computer with spyware or DRM or other is what I was waiting for you to say because most of the time when someone comes to us with a Windows media playing problem.

534
00:41:50,895 --> 00:41:56,910
Rym: It is probably actually a Windows spyware or Windows DLL or Windows broken problem?

535
00:41:57,132 --> 00:42:02,510
Rym: Yep, Macs are different But I don't know enough about doing all that on the Mac to really talk about it.

536
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:07,450
Scott: The most reason the most problem with Macs is that so many Mac programs just use QuickTime.

537
00:42:07,932 --> 00:42:13,210
Scott: So you kind of have to put stuff into QuickTime to make it do what you want, which is not obvious.

538
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:18,070
Scott: Like you get to go put some stuff in some library files somewhere and all that kind of jazz.

539
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:20,790
Rym: But you can always just run M player on the Mac.

540
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:32,022
Scott: The way we watch Anime on the Mac is I have M player and a little dock thing and I just find a video file and I drag it Onto the M player icon and let go and it plays every time.

541
00:42:32,223 --> 00:42:33,407
Rym: well nine every now and then.

542
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,812
Rym: well the one or two times It didn't work.

543
00:42:34,893 --> 00:42:37,022
Rym: Usually the file was actually broken or corrupt.

544
00:42:37,142 --> 00:42:38,870
Scott: Yeah, it wouldn't play in anything on any computer.

545
00:42:39,811 --> 00:42:47,664
Scott: The thing about M player that you gotta understand is actually one of the things I like the most about it Is that if you're not using the GUI version, it's all.

546
00:42:47,744 --> 00:42:49,130
Scott: it's all keyboard shortcuts.

547
00:42:49,715 --> 00:42:51,290
Scott: But the keyboard shortcuts are obvious.

548
00:42:51,431 --> 00:42:56,818
Scott: Like if you want to skip forward like one 30 seconds in the video You push the right arrow.

549
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,110
Scott: if you want to go back you push the left arrow.

550
00:42:59,933 --> 00:43:03,810
Scott: If you want to go like a minute ahead or back you push the up and down arrows.

551
00:43:04,452 --> 00:43:04,934
Scott: You cannot.

552
00:43:04,974 --> 00:43:09,449
Scott: you can do all this stuff to like go forward and back like with page up and page down like ten minutes.

553
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,438
Scott: and Unlike other, you know video programs.

554
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:20,079
Scott: So like you'll drag the little thing left and right and it sort of lags and You know, it skips around a bit.

555
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:20,742
Rym: It's instant.

556
00:43:20,762 --> 00:43:22,650
Rym: It's just BAM BAM BAM player is instant.

557
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,553
Scott: It's like BAM BAM BAM.

558
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:27,985
Scott: It just immediately jumps ahead and it's perfect with no skips.

559
00:43:28,146 --> 00:43:33,690
Rym: That's not just fast computer It's BAM BAM BAM for the most part even on my old computer.

560
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:41,241
Scott: Yeah that if you've got an old computer and like you're watching videos and it skips around a lot To try using like M player on Linux.

561
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:50,801
Scott: I can get a Pentium 3 450 450 megahertz people to play Brand-new high quality videos with M player.

562
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,770
Scott: It's it'll work without a lot of skipping at all.

563
00:43:53,790 --> 00:44:01,949
Scott: It'd be very watchable because I used to watch anime on a computer exactly like that back in the day When videos were actually even worse than they are now.

564
00:44:03,012 --> 00:44:07,200
Rym: So I should have no problem now and Sadly, well, I guess not sadly.

565
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,790
Rym: That's really all we have to say about that.

566
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:15,930
Scott: It's pretty straightforward use M player use M player and yeah video players is sort of a troubled thing.

567
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:21,654
Scott: You know, there's like so many different ones and there's a lot of spyware ones out there and yeah It's not as bad as it used to be.

568
00:44:21,674 --> 00:44:34,630
Scott: It's like everyone has these different preferences, you know for what software they use to play their media and I think there's really not too many of them that are actually good and I don't know why people are all using different things.

569
00:44:35,313 --> 00:44:47,115
Rym: I think part of it is people don't know and part of it is that there are a lot of Websites out there that trick you or try to make you think that you need their player to play certain things or that some things Are incompatible.

570
00:44:47,135 --> 00:44:48,990
Rym: there's a lot of fun about media players.

571
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:51,020
Scott: There is indeed a lot of fun.

572
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:53,793
Scott: Yep people like oh, yeah If you're having trouble.

573
00:44:53,973 --> 00:45:00,195
Scott: so because it'll generally happen is someone will find a file they can't play and they'll go somewhere and they'll say Hey, I can't play this file.

574
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:01,239
Scott: What should I do?

575
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,067
Scott: And someone always says oh use this player.

576
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:05,036
Scott: Oh use this player I don't have any problems with this one.

577
00:45:05,056 --> 00:45:06,984
Scott: Yeah, and they keep switching player.

578
00:45:07,025 --> 00:45:07,708
Rym: But here's the thing.

579
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:10,369
Scott: All right I have a problem on different codec packs.

580
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:16,534
Rym: I'm Wendy and I have my Windows PC and it's full of spyware and I can't play some video I downloaded.

581
00:45:16,876 --> 00:45:19,430
Rym: so I go and ask hey guys, I can't play this video.

582
00:45:19,611 --> 00:45:24,649
Rym: I'm using Windows Media Player and they say oh, well, it works fine if I play it in blah blah blah.

583
00:45:25,211 --> 00:45:27,438
Rym: So I download blah blah blah and it still doesn't play.

584
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,465
Rym: now the reason it doesn't play?

585
00:45:29,485 --> 00:45:31,050
Rym: because my computer's messed up.

586
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,910
Rym: There's nothing to do with what video player I'm using.

587
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:39,392
Scott: Yeah I notice a lot of people have like a whole bunch of different video players and audio players installed on the same computer and it's We do.

588
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:42,847
Rym: but that's just because we never bothered to delete all the ones we experimented with.

589
00:45:43,229 --> 00:45:45,860
Scott: Yeah No, I really only have well on the Mac.

590
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,547
Rym: Yeah, we have the QuickTime.

591
00:45:47,567 --> 00:45:49,475
Rym: We have the VLC We have the end player.

592
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:49,957
Scott: Yeah.

593
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:50,157
Scott: Yeah.

594
00:45:50,177 --> 00:45:52,628
Scott: Yeah, but you can't get rid of the QuickTime juice.

595
00:45:52,648 --> 00:45:53,170
Scott: There's an immediate.

596
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:53,693
Scott: I know.

597
00:45:53,994 --> 00:45:56,346
Rym: I just laugh about juice because I'm thinking about uninstalling it.

598
00:45:56,366 --> 00:46:02,979
Scott: Yeah Yeah, the other thing though is Nowadays people actually back in the day.

599
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:04,584
Scott: You didn't have a lot of media.

600
00:46:04,724 --> 00:46:06,730
Scott: You only had like a folder full of it.

601
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:13,750
Scott: So using directories and your file system as a way to organize your media was not a big deal because it actually worked.

602
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,638
Scott: You only had like a thousand songs.

603
00:46:15,678 --> 00:46:18,229
Scott: Maybe just organize them into folders and you're good to go.

604
00:46:18,882 --> 00:46:30,869
Scott: nowadays it's really necessary to have something that sort of manages your music or video library because you have so much stuff with such these giant hard Drives and there's not too many applications that do that very well at all.

605
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:35,907
Rym: Yeah, I mean iTunes does it better than most I'd say but I still it's not.

606
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:36,730
Scott: it does it it.

607
00:46:37,432 --> 00:46:40,362
Scott: iTunes does it in a way that actually works which is better than most.

608
00:46:40,543 --> 00:46:41,446
Rym: see that's the thing.

609
00:46:41,606 --> 00:46:46,129
Rym: iTunes doesn't do it in a Like but iTunes works and doesn't just crash halfway through.

610
00:46:46,692 --> 00:46:59,280
Scott: Yes on Linux pretty much like banshee can do it But banshee if you add more than like a hundred things to the library It becomes unstable and crashes and slows to the all the shit no matter what computer using I mean.

611
00:46:59,362 --> 00:47:19,471
Rym: sadly It's to the point where while I recognize that I need to organize my music in a better way because the way I do it Now is fine, but it's starting to be outstripped just by the sheer amount of media I have but I continue to put my new music into the same directory structure Which is fairly robust, but it's gonna run It's not.

612
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:23,226
Rym: it's not gonna extend forever because there's no better way for me to do it.

613
00:47:23,346 --> 00:47:26,135
Rym: I have too many songs Yep, and Linux.

614
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:32,733
Scott: the only thing that actually I think does a good job of it is Amarok mostly because it just doesn't crash and It actually is good.

615
00:47:32,793 --> 00:47:36,589
Scott: management uses real relational databases to tell her that stuff.

616
00:47:37,252 --> 00:47:41,030
Scott: But it's like a Katie EF and it's it's a little you know, it's not perfect.

617
00:47:41,151 --> 00:47:43,099
Scott: But the other problem is the best you can get.

618
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,621
Rym: a lot of people have a large Legacy collection of music that they've gotten from way back in the day.

619
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:52,955
Rym: There's no ID threes in that file names are wrong things are spelled wrong all sorts of.

620
00:47:53,537 --> 00:48:02,889
Rym: it's very hard to take an old set of mp3s and Without a lot of effort or crying put them into a new way of organizing them.

621
00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:06,410
Scott: Yep I mean there are things that'll help you out with that like music brains.

622
00:48:07,152 --> 00:48:10,183
Scott: But music brains isn't perfect and it basically it's.

623
00:48:10,364 --> 00:48:15,889
Scott: it's a tool that makes it easier to Like corral all your mp3s and such.

624
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:25,770
Scott: But it still requires a lot of manual labor and data entry and dragging and dropping and typing It just requires a lot less than doing every single song one at a time.

625
00:48:25,951 --> 00:48:33,863
Rym: so I think as a result a lot of people end up continuing to use their old structures just because They like like my mp3 collection.

626
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:39,630
Rym: if I import that into iTunes I can't find anything easily because I know where all the files are.

627
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:46,290
Rym: They're organized in a way that makes sense to me, you know, this gigantic nested collection of folders based on different whatever's.

628
00:48:47,131 --> 00:48:57,837
Rym: But in iTunes because there's no ID 3 data or anything The songs are just in this mishmash and without the file name structure and the directory structure I can't find the files.

629
00:48:58,118 --> 00:49:03,370
Rym: So as a result, I don't use iTunes to organize my old music But I'd like to use it to organize my new music.

630
00:49:03,914 --> 00:49:05,830
Rym: But then now I'm gonna have two different collection to music.

631
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:22,650
Rym: I think the only answer is to keep your legacy music separate and start fresh with your new music and wait and eventually You'll probably replace all your old music with better modern mp3s of the new stuff with all the data in the right places and once you reach that point just delete your old mp3 collection.

632
00:49:23,283 --> 00:49:32,159
Scott: But yeah There aren't too many programs besides iTunes and maybe I'd ever tried to do it with Windows Media Player and WinAmp does it now And when I'm

633
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,510
Rym: did it, okay, actually

634
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:44,381
Scott: Yeah When it does it does it an okay way and that it is really not too many programs that are good at managing a media Library, which is becoming a huge need of many people.

635
00:49:44,762 --> 00:49:47,569
Scott: that is not satisfied nearly as well as it should.

636
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:56,110
Rym: plus media library alone one thing cross-platform media library or media library on SAN or NAS.

637
00:49:56,531 --> 00:50:02,768
Rym: But then I want to access it from iTunes from my iPod and I also want to access it from my media player downstairs and my zoom.

638
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:09,250
Rym: At that point you got to use the directory structure to just so everything will work and then you're right back where you started.

639
00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:09,992
Scott: Yep.

640
00:50:10,233 --> 00:50:11,718
Scott: Yeah, it pretty much sucks.

641
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,644
Scott: Like because you've got an iPod.

642
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:18,748
Scott: You've got a computer a desktop You've got a laptop and you've got the music stored.

643
00:50:18,788 --> 00:50:23,425
Scott: and you know You don't want to copy every single song and every single video to every single one of those.

644
00:50:23,485 --> 00:50:24,870
Rym: Yeah hard drives aren't that cheap.

645
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:35,810
Scott: Yeah, so you want to have them all probably on the desktop or on maybe a server somewhere But you want to be able to search and play anything from the library from your laptop no matter where you are.

646
00:50:36,171 --> 00:50:40,906
Scott: You want to be able to sync anything to your iPod no matter which computer you plug the iPod into.

647
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:49,170
Scott: you want to be able To you know, listen to any song and watch any video from any computer and there's really not too many solutions for that.

648
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:54,689
Scott: I mean, there's a pro there's a thing on Linux the MPD the music player demon, but that's sorta.

649
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:59,103
Scott: It has the right design to do something like that, but it's not perfect.

650
00:50:59,846 --> 00:51:01,210
Scott: It doesn't solve all the needs.

651
00:51:01,331 --> 00:51:03,303
Scott: There really isn't anything that solves all these needs now.

652
00:51:03,766 --> 00:51:11,550
Rym: I mean for now I'm just gonna keep my directory structure which is half based on artist and then album but also half based on genre.

653
00:51:12,113 --> 00:51:15,570
Rym: Yep, which is kind of annoying but luckily I'm weird so I'm used to it.

654
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:20,269
Scott: But once you find whatever file you want to play and player plays it.

655
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:21,916
Scott: Yep And that's all.

656
00:51:21,956 --> 00:51:22,961
Scott: I think that's all we got to say.

657
00:51:22,981 --> 00:51:27,255
Scott: media players are crazy and Don't use a stupid one.

658
00:51:27,978 --> 00:51:31,069
Rym: Yeah, and in terms of just playing audio on Linux, I use xmm s.

659
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,579
Scott: Xms is old and busted.

660
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:35,690
Rym: I know it's old but it still kind of works.

661
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,719
Rym: It works Okay, and it's it feels like Winamp which I'm used to.

662
00:51:38,779 --> 00:51:43,880
Scott: I use Amarok because my media library is in it So I don't have to you know export or anything like.

663
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:50,170
Rym: the only reason I'm not currently using Amarok is because I didn't have a computer that I could easily install it on until now.

664
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:54,835
Rym: I think xmm s is gonna go the way of all the other things I was on installing.

665
00:51:54,855 --> 00:51:56,382
Scott: thing is those guys are working on.

666
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:04,930
Scott: there used to be beat media player But now they're actually working on BMP X and it looks like it's going to become the shit awesome.

667
00:52:05,356 --> 00:52:06,288
Scott: But it's not there yet.

668
00:52:06,952 --> 00:52:16,617
Scott: So you got to wait until BMP X is ready and then we can go to BMP X. Cuz I think in the end that will be the best choice But it's not right now.

669
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:22,170
Rym: and on that note I want to finish here Mostly because I want to get the show done on the new computer.

670
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:25,210
Rym: See how long it takes to edit which I think is gonna be a really pleasant experience.

671
00:52:26,111 --> 00:52:27,396
Scott: Gotta bet a lot earlier there.

672
00:52:27,877 --> 00:52:28,520
Rym: Not at all.

673
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,249
Rym: No, cuz I think I'm gonna reboot and play steam.

674
00:52:32,655 --> 00:52:33,789
Rym: I installed Def Con.

675
00:52:35,251 --> 00:52:43,597
Rym: Steam is bad because I can just click on games that I don't own and the games appear and the only thing that changes is A number goes up on my credit card.

676
00:52:43,758 --> 00:52:46,490
Scott: You can even get game demos without making the number go up.

677
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:51,830
Rym: I know I know but I can get games and also I can play counter-strike.

678
00:52:51,991 --> 00:52:55,725
Rym: And I guess I forgot that counter-strike is still a pretty damn good game.

679
00:52:55,745 --> 00:53:03,086
Rym: all things are not full ads Yeah, but luckily I can as long as I don't play on the most popular maps in the game.

680
00:53:03,106 --> 00:53:04,710
Rym: I won't see the ads.

681
00:53:13,631 --> 00:53:16,322
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

682
00:53:16,362 --> 00:53:18,370
