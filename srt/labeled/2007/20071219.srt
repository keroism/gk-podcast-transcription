00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,958
Scott: It's Wednesday December 19th.

2
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:12,821
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:14,768
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:18,323
Scott: tonight We review Essex County volumes 1 & 2 by Jeff Lemire.

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,382
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:31,550
Rym: Oh Snap Rym has new glasses.

7
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:35,439
Rym: Okay, that's that's all I got.

8
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:36,643
Rym: that's what happened to me today.

9
00:00:36,683 --> 00:00:38,830
Rym: I don't know what you did, but I got glasses.

10
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:40,095
Scott: I went to work.

11
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:40,817
Scott: I did work.

12
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:41,922
Scott: I came home.

13
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:42,966
Rym: see I can say one thing.

14
00:00:43,447 --> 00:00:45,155
Rym: over the weekend I thought oh man.

15
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:47,045
Rym: I'm gonna go get glasses.

16
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:47,950
Rym: There's gonna be that blizzard.

17
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:56,250
Rym: I'll go to the mall even though it's near Christmas You know Xmas when generally my policy is to not go within 10 miles of a mall until like January 10th.

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,619
Rym: But there's a blizzard.

19
00:00:58,639 --> 00:00:59,304
Rym: so I figure all right.

20
00:00:59,324 --> 00:01:04,384
Rym: I'll go up the road There'll be no one at the mall, and I can get some glasses and go to the GameStop.

21
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,452
Rym: Maybe play some DDR and Sure enough.

22
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:11,168
Rym: I was the only human being in that mall who was not a worker.

23
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:19,199
Rym: yep And the doctors who were supposed to give the eye exams also didn't bother to show up Would you probably not if I was a doctor.

24
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:22,590
Rym: so there you go, so I went back home pretty much soundly defeated.

25
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:25,297
Rym: Then I learned something today.

26
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:31,741
Rym: I tried to go get glasses like a pearl vision or lens crafters the place I've gone my whole life, and it was kind of a pain.

27
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:34,110
Rym: You know I'll come back in an hour make an appointment.

28
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:36,790
Rym: It'll take forever blah blah blah Insurance.

29
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:48,990
Rym: So I just said screw it I just went to this place right next to my work in New York and like 42nd Street And I was like I need glasses, and I walked out an hour later with two pairs of brand new glasses.

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,763
Scott: Yep, that's the thing about New York.

31
00:01:51,783 --> 00:01:56,309
Scott: You know back in the day They used to be customer service you'd go into a store and people would help you.

32
00:01:56,772 --> 00:02:00,690
Scott: You know with whatever you needed they would talk to you, and they'd be like selling to you like salesmen.

33
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:07,279
Scott: You know attending to your needs, and you know you know fanning you with fern leaves Putting grapes in your mouth.

34
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:08,789
Scott: You know in order to get you to give them money.

35
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:09,592
Rym: Yeah, you know what.

36
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:14,090
Scott: now you only get that in the big cities in the in the fancy stores or the semi fancy store.

37
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,010
Rym: I had two salespeople standing there handing me.

38
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,470
Rym: They don't even let me look at the glasses.

39
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:27,594
Rym: They'd hand me one and that I'd put it on me and then they'd tell me how they thought it looked and then they'd show it to me and I'm dead at it at it done and They didn't even pull the.

40
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:32,310
Rym: the more expensive ones are clearly superior because they handed me this Armani thing.

41
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:40,270
Rym: It's like it was like a thousand dollars just for this frame And they put it on me, and I'm like I don't know cuz I don't know I don't know fashion so much.

42
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:49,828
Rym: I look at glasses, and I can't really tell if they look good or not on me, so I need to ask other people And they're like no those don't look good on you at all, and I didn't get the stupid crazy expensive Armani's.

43
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:52,270
Scott: yeah Yeah, that's how it goes.

44
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,849
Scott: and that's I think what is the only advantage now that retail brick-and-mortar retail has over the internet.

45
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:04,870
Scott: because pretty much if I'm going to buy something at retail and It's not I'm not gonna get that great customer cervix experience.

46
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,170
Scott: I might as well buy it online like I want a great customer cervix cervix.

47
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:26,696
Scott: But you know if I go to say millennium games right even though the games cost more there than they do on the Internet's Someone's gonna be there to talk to me about games And they're gonna tell me what games came out recently which ones they think are cool And which ones they think are not cool, and if I think a game is cool They're gonna tell me about the game.

48
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:29,430
Scott: begin to know something about the game on the internet.

49
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:34,737
Scott: You know I have to go and I have to search for the game, and it's it's almost as good But not quite as good and the price is lowered.

50
00:03:35,138 --> 00:03:42,890
Scott: so if I go to say normal Joe Schmoe's game shop Joe Schmoe just sits behind the counter reading the newspaper.

51
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:44,434
Scott: I'm not gonna do that.

52
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:44,876
Scott: fuck that.

53
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:49,743
Scott: it's either the good customer service in the brick-and-mortar or the The Internet's.

54
00:03:50,047 --> 00:04:02,727
Rym: yeah And I kind of realized after I did this that I haven't really gone to Stores other than food stores in a long time and in fact we tried to order our groceries online And we live a little bit too far from New York City to get that service.

55
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:12,190
Scott: yep But yeah the only place to get decent customer service these days that I found is specialty or Semi specialty shops at minimum and mostly in New York City.

56
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:17,350
Scott: I mean every time I've ever bought something in a place in New York City that wasn't a chain or franchise place.

57
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:20,209
Scott: There's been excellent customer service in the old-fashioned way.

58
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:24,630
Rym: now I'm sure you know Chicago and LA have the same deal, but we're in New York, so we talk about New York.

59
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,778
Scott: Yeah I don't know how those other cities are.

60
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:30,674
Scott: the problem is I've been to too many cities like Hartford, Connecticut Where there are no stores.

61
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:34,187
Scott: well, it's just big office buildings from the ground up to oh god.

62
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:34,870
Rym: I love Connecticut.

63
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,990
Rym: That's what I mean.

64
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,207
Rym: I really really love Connecticut because the first time I went I realized that it's just a really fun laid-back con.

65
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:45,068
Rym: yeah, but We tried to walk out of that con to get some food.

66
00:04:46,110 --> 00:05:01,394
Scott: Because all that's in Hartford, Connecticut is first of all government buildings This is the capital city of Connecticut, but also office buildings for companies, but unlike, New York City Where let's say I own an office building and my company's in it right the bottom of that office building is gonna be all Stores and things like

67
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:01,716
Rym: every.

68
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,081
Rym: you know the building comes down.

69
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:06,274
Rym: It's a big skyscraper, and then the whole bottom floor It's just storefronts.

70
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:08,101
Scott: Yeah, I mean Empire State Building.

71
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,050
Scott: even the whole thing is storefronts except for the one spot That's the entrance to the Empire State Building.

72
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,106
Rym: Yeah, my building the Lincoln building has like these tiny little entrances in the four corners, and then just stores.

73
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:27,230
Rym: yep, but Go to Hartford and every skyscraper just comes all the way down to the street no doors No windows nothing just a wall, and then the door to the building and then a wall.

74
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,286
Rym: It was kind of like walking in a big empty building that didn't have a roof.

75
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:34,618
Scott: yep So there's too many cities like that.

76
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:36,346
Scott: so those cities don't have the customer.

77
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:37,310
Rym: Chicago's not like that.

78
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,659
Rym: I've been to Chicago a few times.

79
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,150
Rym: It's more like New York.

80
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,178
Scott: Yeah, I imagine Vancouver to be sort of similar.

81
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:43,363
Rym: Philly can't be like that.

82
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:44,950
Rym: I hear tell that Philly's pretty cool.

83
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,750
Scott: Yeah, Philly's got stores all right all right.

84
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:57,212
Rym: I'll go first so I don't have quite as much time to Poke around on the internet at my new job like I used to at say IBM, so I often find out about the news I don't know.

85
00:05:57,693 --> 00:06:01,687
Rym: five sometimes seven minutes after other people do.

86
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,430
Scott: how do you get by?

87
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,832
Scott: You know what?

88
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:07,909
Scott: if something happens that you like you know needs to happen in the next seven minutes like what?

89
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,799
Scott: Big buy something for a dollar.

90
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,930
Scott: you got seven minutes, then it'll be a thousand dollars.

91
00:06:13,091 --> 00:06:14,657
Rym: I highly doubt that'll happen in two.

92
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:17,086
Scott: if it does I knew I will products gonna release.

93
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:18,110
Scott: you got to run and wait in line.

94
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:24,450
Rym: If it does I have people like you who go omg omg in my Google chat anyway.

95
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:38,290
Rym: So uh I'm sitting there at work and Emily messaged me, and she says something to the effect of Satoshi khan is doing Batman to which I said that is probably going to be the second best Batman ever done.

96
00:06:38,592 --> 00:06:47,170
Scott: Well, I mean I heard back in the day You know when paprika was was newish that Satoshi khan's next thing was gonna be some sort of thing for the younger audience.

97
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:48,399
Scott: I was thinking uh you know.

98
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,822
Scott: so when she said he was doing a Batman I was like ah a Batman movie makes sense.

99
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:59,869
Scott: the kids can enjoy the Batman movie You know but it's certain court seemed kind of weird to me that he's making a Batman movie when?

100
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:06,993
Scott: There's a bat a live-action Batman coming out kind of soon ish, and I think there's a trailer now Yep, plus.

101
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:14,255
Rym: I mean the deal is that basically they're making you know this new Batman movie from Christopher Nolan's Batman As was kind of expected.

102
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:18,848
Rym: and uh they were gonna make some sort of Batman and matrix to go before it.

103
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,794
Scott: ah Batman a matrix.

104
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:25,989
Rym: so uh it sounds good to me six animated shorts that are going to be called Batman Gotham night.

105
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:37,765
Rym: Now the director that was named was somewhat Bruce Timm for the whole project, but according to sources here Satoshi khan is going to be the director of at least one of these segments.

106
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,265
Scott: ah So it is gonna be the Batman a matrix.

107
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:45,210
Rym: yep There's gonna be six of them, and it looks like the people they've got on board.

108
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:54,129
Rym: I mean Satoshi khan might only be doing one But I'm still really excited about this because they've got madhouse studio 4c in production IG, so they're all gonna be great.

109
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:59,543
Scott: see I Really, I think this is a good trend because you know wait you think about it.

110
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:27,790
Scott: if someone wants to make say a collection of Shorts right or a collection of animated shorts especially and sell them for money in the u.s.. That's kind of hard You know trying to sell something like memories You know in the u.s.. Not easy, which is sad because I like things like that a lot right but if you attach them somehow to some existing popular property like like the Topically or you know a timely fashion like is an a matrix like the matrix just came out.

111
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:41,568
Scott: Hey If we make we can make an anthology of animated things on a disk and sell it now because we just attach the matrix name To it and put it out with the regular matrix and people will buy it and they did and Doing the same thing with Batman.

112
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:50,773
Scott: I don't think you can go wrong And I hope they continue to do this for things that come out because I like Anthologies now.

113
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:53,505
Rym: I hope you all know who Satoshi khan is.

114
00:08:53,545 --> 00:09:01,877
Rym: I mean we don't just Constantly talk about how awesome we think this man is but he was the director of you know no How awesome he is.

115
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:04,449
Rym: I'm not sure I know how awesome Satoshi khan is.

116
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:06,076
Rym: He directed on.

117
00:09:06,116 --> 00:09:07,321
Rym: let's see perfect blue.

118
00:09:07,361 --> 00:09:11,493
Rym: paranoid agent paprika millennium actress Tokyo godfathers.

119
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,260
Rym: yes, that's the one I always forget.

120
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,003
Scott: That's the best one.

121
00:09:14,163 --> 00:09:14,464
Scott: it is.

122
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:15,669
Rym: no it isn't.

123
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:15,930
Rym: yeah.

124
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,002
Rym: Actually, I think perfect blue is my favorite.

125
00:09:20,122 --> 00:09:24,304
Scott: I think paranoid agent for glue one So I don't remember, but paranoid agent.

126
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:25,069
Rym: I think is the best.

127
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:27,300
Scott: I gotta tell you freak is the prettiest.

128
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:29,168
Rym: Tokyo godfathers is the funniest.

129
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:39,336
Scott: If you haven't seen plenty of actors Oh godfathers, or if you haven't seen anything's brought by Satoshi khan go get Tokyo godfathers on DVD now Because it's a holiday movie.

130
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:40,361
Rym: actually watch it.

131
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:49,169
Rym: if you're some geeky kid out there and you're gonna be with your family over the holiday and You want to geekify them a little bit, but kind of with a sucker punch.

132
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:53,123
Rym: Bring Tokyo godfathers because it's an acclaimed movie.

133
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:55,150
Rym: You can probably convince your family to watch it.

134
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:56,894
Scott: Holiday movie.

135
00:09:56,935 --> 00:09:59,970
Scott: it is definitely a Christmassy movie a very very much.

136
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,530
Rym: So I think we showed it as the Christmas showing at RIT anime.

137
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:07,590
Scott: I like how the movie especially and I got a record to do a show about Tokyo godfathers.

138
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,760
Rym: We will but not tonight.

139
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:09,750
Scott: Did we do one in the past?

140
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,531
Rym: Maybe I don't know if we did listen to that if we didn't remind us and we'll do it all right, but yeah It's.

141
00:10:15,872 --> 00:10:24,134
Scott: it's one of those good holiday movies where that's it happens to take place that all the events take place around the holiday season But there's no actual.

142
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:27,001
Scott: it doesn't actually deal with like any holidays directly.

143
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:30,530
Rym: Yeah, it's not like the Tokyo godfathers kidnapped Santa.

144
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:31,755
Rym: Yeah, it's up to you.

145
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:35,010
Scott: It's just in the holiday spirits and the holiday times.

146
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:38,643
Rym: It's also I guess I would call it one of those feel-good movies.

147
00:10:38,743 --> 00:10:39,867
Rym: Yeah, I mean, it's sad.

148
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:40,670
Rym: It's poignant.

149
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,124
Rym: It's very much a Satoshi khan film don't get us wrong, but it's very.

150
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:46,950
Rym: it's one of his more light-hearted works.

151
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:53,945
Scott: yeah, all right, so When you want to find lyrics to musics well, what do you do?

152
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:55,710
Rym: I used to go to Sailor Bacon.

153
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:59,153
Scott: Well, that's for you know, anime musics I never cared about.

154
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:08,630
Rym: I never looked up lyrics to any other song ever except once I looked up the lyrics to stairway Cuz I couldn't hear what the hell they were saying and I wondered uh, can't believe you don't know lyrics to stairway?

155
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,879
Rym: I know the lyrics now when I was a kid.

156
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,349
Rym: I wasn't sure what a bustle in a hedgerow was.

157
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:15,664
Scott: There's a bustle in your hedgerow.

158
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:24,170
Scott: Don't be All right, it's just exactly, all right, so Yeah used to go to the Sailor Bacon.

159
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,274
Scott: But you know those people.

160
00:11:25,314 --> 00:11:29,168
Scott: they protect their lyrics like with the copyrights and they're really anal about it.

161
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:35,444
Scott: cuz you know They want you to buy the album which is the lyrics printed in the little cover and sometimes lyrics I've been printed in there, you know?

162
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:42,089
Scott: or the worst thing I remember I got a Nirvana album way back or they want you to buy the sheet music That is the lyrics on it so that your band can cover it.

163
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:53,268
Rym: Well, the thing is actually what bothers me about the whole situation in general is that I can derive It's not like I'm recreating the whole work, but I can derive information about the word just because I'm a human being.

164
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:55,093
Rym: I can listen I can hear the words.

165
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:56,779
Rym: How come I can't transcribe them.

166
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,130
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of like how tablatures should be equally legal and free.

167
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,847
Rym: I mean if I listen to a song and figure out your chord progression, there's only so many chord progressions.

168
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:06,650
Rym: There aren't that many.

169
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:07,554
Rym: It's not like.

170
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:08,598
Rym: I can't figure it out.

171
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,848
Rym: You can't copyright a chord progression.

172
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:14,770
Scott: Yep All right, and copyright only prevents the copying.

173
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:15,634
Scott: I mean, it's one thing.

174
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:20,363
Scott: if I go to the store and buy your sheet music and photocopy it All right It's another thing entirely.

175
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:26,910
Scott: if I listen Figure out the notes on my own and then tell my friend what I found out and then play it.

176
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,464
Rym: That's I guess we need some DRM in music.

177
00:12:30,504 --> 00:12:31,690
Rym: make it so you can't hear the notes.

178
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:33,823
Rym: Ah, cuz then this won't be a problem anymore.

179
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:34,245
Scott: Good call.

180
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:34,628
Scott: Good call.

181
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:39,343
Scott: anyway Japan has actually found a solution to this problem that I think is high quality.

182
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:56,063
Scott: Oh, they have a website Annie Kashi JP and you can go to this website and you can search for artist song title anime series tie-in program or any phrase within lyrics and You can find lyrics to anime musics.

183
00:12:56,404 --> 00:13:02,970
Scott: if you type in the word Gundam It gives you a list of a hundred and sixty six songs that you can get the lyrics to on the site.

184
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:04,638
Rym: Now, is it just in Japanese?

185
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,603
Rym: Do they have the Romani?

186
00:13:05,643 --> 00:13:07,030
Rym: Do they have the English translations?

187
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:15,835
Scott: I'm gonna go right now because it doesn't say because what I need for karaoke, okay It's a Japanese.

188
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:18,929
Rym: so far I can't read hiragana that quickly.

189
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:21,369
Scott: So far, it's in Japanese great.

190
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:23,639
Rym: So I guess it's back to Sailor Bacon.

191
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,727
Scott: for me if Sailor Bacon still exists.

192
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:26,128
Scott: Let's see.

193
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:27,194
Scott: Hold on I'm gonna I'm gonna try.

194
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:37,844
Rym: I'm sure the spirit of Sailor Bacon lives on Regardless of whether or not the actual site that may or may not have been run by a man Named Sailor Bacon who may or may not have dressed up as a sailor sky.

195
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:50,780
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's in Japanese, but Regardless it is fully authorized by the Japanese Society for the rights of authors composers and publishers Which is the the people who you know manage the lyrics whatever.

196
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,200
Scott: so it's totally legal and this is exactly What they need to do in the US.

197
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,050
Scott: you want people to stop doing illegal?

198
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,929
Scott: Technically illegal things and you want to sort of put some control on it.

199
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:04,970
Scott: Then you have to offer something that is better.

200
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:05,652
Scott: You have to.

201
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:12,170
Scott: you know, it's possible to compete with bit torrents or you know, crappy lyrics fan-made lyric sites.

202
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,978
Scott: you just put up a quality lyric site.

203
00:14:13,998 --> 00:14:18,376
Scott: that's yours and people will go to that one instead and Japan did that in.

204
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:20,169
Scott: the US should follow suit if they're smart.

205
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,828
Rym: So things of the day.

206
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:35,460
Rym: if you kind of a short episode since you know The holidays are coming up and we're all exhausted and I really want to be rested.

207
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:43,590
Rym: So when the new mixer comes tomorrow, I can sit here in my room for the next four hours going Testing.

208
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:44,180
Scott: you mean you're gonna.

209
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:48,478
Rym: I'm gonna fiddle about.

210
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:52,631
Rym: I'm gonna fiddle about with knobs for like eight hours.

211
00:14:52,973 --> 00:14:54,500
Scott: Yeah Rym likes to fiddle the knobs.

212
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:59,074
Rym: Hey, the thing is when I first got my mixer, it only doesn't have so many knobs.

213
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:00,900
Rym: It has like 15 knobs.

214
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,084
Scott: How many knobs do you need?

215
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:04,270
Rym: there are like 70 knobs.

216
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:06,476
Rym: I can mess with on this new given knob fetish.

217
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:07,560
Rym: I like knobs.

218
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:09,697
Scott: Well, we have it people.

219
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:16,620
Rym: so My thing of the day in fact involves a knob great.

220
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:32,825
Rym: so I'm using this partly because I Don't know I have mixed feelings about this thing today because it's one of those top ten lists and It's done in a very kind of pedestrian radio void like and number ten is It's a screw attack one, right?

221
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:33,627
Scott: Yeah screw attack.

222
00:15:33,828 --> 00:15:35,714
Scott: They do all theirs in the same style.

223
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:37,740
Rym: So yeah, I just I don't like that style.

224
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,326
Rym: It's kind of this old-world thing.

225
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:42,156
Scott: Yeah, sometimes their top ten lists are good and sometimes not so good.

226
00:15:42,397 --> 00:15:44,884
Rym: Well this one Starts out strong.

227
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:47,793
Rym: The number ten is arguably one of the funniest ones.

228
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:59,313
Rym: Yep, and then pretty much like eight through three are Patently unfunny and then it suddenly gets funny at the end except number one wasn't so no number one wasn't so great But a couple of the other ones.

229
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:06,512
Rym: Yeah It's basically a Christmas themed the top ten hose.

230
00:16:06,812 --> 00:16:09,900
Rym: get it Santa Claus ho ho in video games.

231
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:12,836
Scott: Yet I could have thought of ten better hoes.

232
00:16:12,876 --> 00:16:21,131
Rym: Let me tell ya I definitely could have but watch it to the end because I think number two right around there There's a pretty good payoff and the first one they give you.

233
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:23,640
Rym: I don't know why I never noticed that.

234
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:33,853
Rym: I don't know why I never thought of that because I've seen all sorts of times where people like a website of check out these Unfortunate screenshots from video games, but never saw this one before.

235
00:16:34,214 --> 00:16:34,395
Scott: Nope.

236
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:37,007
Scott: I mean I think game I've never even seen before.

237
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,240
Rym: you've never seen that game before not really.

238
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,109
Rym: I mean, I've seen the glory holes in total recall.

239
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,637
Rym: Oh the glory holes, but this one was news to me.

240
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:44,737
Rym: Okay

241
00:16:46,561 --> 00:17:06,888
Scott: so I go to some other forums not many pretty much to one or two and One of them is the is the forums for the comic geek speak podcast where there's a lot of comic nerds who I you know They're well, I might disagree with them about many comic things because they're mostly underwear pervert fans across the board mostly not all of them You know, they're they're cool people in their forms.

242
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,480
Scott: Okay, I think it helps that and I don't go to all the threads.

243
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,692
Scott: I go to very few of the threads.

244
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:14,380
Rym: see my Scott and I have kind of different circles here.

245
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,060
Rym: Like I meet some of these people at comms like the comic geek speak people.

246
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:25,823
Rym: I meet a few of them and Every one of them I've ever met has been really cool and I remember they wanted to shake my hand when I finally read Frank Miller's Batman.

247
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:26,444
Rym: Yeah.

248
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:29,353
Rym: Yeah, the Dark Knight Returns not that other one that they.

249
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:30,758
Rym: they had a look of horror lot of.

250
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:34,387
Scott: there's a lot of Batman's that Frank Miller has written.

251
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:41,179
Rym: Yeah, and when I said I read Frank Miller's Batman They looked at me with this look of horror and they're like you Dark Knight Returns, right?

252
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:45,033
Scott: Yeah, because lately he's been second.

253
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:50,551
Scott: Okay anyway So one guy his name on that forum is dad Zorro.

254
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:55,807
Scott: All right, so him and his wife You know, they would go to the comic shop.

255
00:17:55,848 --> 00:18:04,279
Scott: I guess with the kids, you know, nice little fit comic family and The guys at the comic shop are apparently really nice to their kids and they appreciated that.

256
00:18:05,143 --> 00:18:09,060
Scott: So they made some gingerbread cookies to give to the guys at the comic book store.

257
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:15,959
Scott: But then they took some food, you know the frosting of different colors that you can just sort of decorate food with.

258
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,455
Scott: you know I guess you get at the cake decorating section of the.

259
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:25,900
Scott: you know the store there and They decorated these gingerbread man's to look like superheroes and some of them were done by the kids obviously.

260
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:29,628
Scott: So they don't look that high-quality But you can recognize which hero they are anyway.

261
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,760
Scott: and some were done by the mom or the dad and they're pretty high quality.

262
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,706
Scott: So you can look at those and they're high quality.

263
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:38,900
Scott: and yeah little underwear perfect gingerbread man's they're really cute and awesome.

264
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:40,891
Rym: I think Scott's favorite one was the Hulk.

265
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:50,347
Scott: There's that there's two Hulk ones There's the there's the first Hulk one though the one that is done by the parent obviously is Super cute and high quality.

266
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:50,769
Rym: I don't know.

267
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:52,053
Rym: I really like that Iron Man.

268
00:18:52,134 --> 00:18:53,760
Scott: I don't know why I don't like Iron Man.

269
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:55,652
Rym: I don't know why you don't like Iron Man.

270
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:56,457
Scott: I don't like Iron Man.

271
00:18:56,497 --> 00:18:56,840
Scott: He sucks.

272
00:18:57,662 --> 00:19:01,333
Scott: It's a stupid character even before recent events of Iron Man.

273
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,095
Rym: good song though.

274
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:03,880
Scott: Yeah, that's completely unrelated.

275
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:08,710
Scott: There's also two different Batman's this, you know The black and gray Batman and there's the blue Batman.

276
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,553
Rym: the blue Batman is.

277
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:11,620
Rym: I mean that Batman is my favorite Batman.

278
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:14,069
Scott: The blue Batman is is high quality also.

Scott: But yeah, check these out.

Scott: These people are pretty cool.

282
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:18,816
Scott: You should do similar things.

283
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:20,499
Scott: maybe anime character.

284
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,084
Scott: You know gingerbread.

285
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:23,127

Scott: They were awesome.

00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,664
Scott: Everyone else sucks I don't know.

290
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:35,800
Rym: or maybe we're thinking about making some cookies because actually Emily's going out of town.

291
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:38,919
Rym: I think everyone is going out of town to do what Xmas stuff?

292
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:40,044
Rym: Except us.

293
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:42,373
Rym: Scott and I always celebrate a Jewish Christmas.

294
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:44,120
Scott: I'm the Jew and rims the honorary Jew.

295
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:53,630
Rym: Yeah, so we maybe go to a movie get some Chinese food and we're probably gonna sit in the house recording like maybe My parents sent me a link to a YouTube.

296
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,652
Scott: that was pretty crappy, but it was a Jew kid You know, he was pretty actually good at singing in music.

297
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:00,160
Scott: But you know, he made a little music.

298
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:06,680
Scott: No, he made a little music video about you know a Jew going to eat Chinese food and watch movies on Christmas.

299
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:09,775
Scott: So maybe I'll make that my thing today tomorrow, even though it's not that great.

300
00:20:09,856 --> 00:20:14,678
Rym: It's still relevant Yeah, but if you guys can think of some gingerbread cookies, we should make.

301
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:20,340
Scott: yeah We generally I'm trying to because a lot of other people with podcasts and other internet creative people.

302
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,736
Rym: You want to be like those other people?

303
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:27,880
Scott: No, no But they seem to be very much more successful in getting their community to create more things.

304
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:34,125
Rym: I think the problem one is that we tend to not follow through on sending the prizes We're supposed to send.

305
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,140
Rym: we've got a growing list of we don't need prizes.

306
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:37,607
Scott: I mean like these comic guys.

307
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:42,808
Scott: right every month or so they say alright everyone We're gonna start a thread a fan art thread.

308
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:46,700
Scott: everyone draw animals and people just draw animals like crazy.

309
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,487
Scott: Let's say alright guys, we're done drawing animals.

310
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:51,580
Scott: draw guys with capes and they'll draw guys with capes.

311
00:20:51,681 --> 00:21:04,420
Rym: I think number two we very rarely will explicitly say do X for us and then follow up by reminding people and Make a specific thread in the forum that we look at and maintain and then we talk about on the show.

312
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,214
Scott: Yeah, I generally don't.

313
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:13,140
Scott: in general I know we're not gonna, you know, follow through on any of that business, but I want to stir up more creativity among the listeners.

314
00:21:13,682 --> 00:21:15,209
Scott: So stir stir stir.

315
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,559
Scott: do make things stir stir stir.

316
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:26,574
Rym: so I'll tell you this if anyone gives us a good idea for something to make out of gingerbread and To make at all make make foods that are geeky.

317
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,000
Rym: You know what people are gonna say.

318
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,450
Rym: They're gonna say make a podcast.

319
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:32,163
Rym: Yeah more podcast Videocast.

320
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,859
Scott: Oh, well, you want to get into the main bit here?

321
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:38,874
Rym: Yeah, well if you want your videocast hold out till Katsucon and I'll tell you more later.

322
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:40,380
Scott: Okay, right?

323
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,918
Rym: So in some strange turn of events, I don't know how this is happening, but it's kind of a miracle.

324
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,088
Rym: lately I've been reading a lot of comic books.

325
00:21:50,449 --> 00:21:51,051
Scott: Yes.

326
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:52,737
Scott: It's like wait a minute.

327
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:53,700
Scott: There's someone at the door.

328
00:21:53,961 --> 00:21:54,844
Scott: Let me go see who it is.

329
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:56,610
Rym: It's not opportunity.

330
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,874
Scott: No, no, it's death.

331
00:21:58,115 --> 00:21:58,677
Scott: No up.

332
00:21:58,938 --> 00:21:59,620
Scott: It's Satan.

333
00:22:00,424 --> 00:22:02,476
Scott: He says he needs to borrow your blankets.

334
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:05,085
Rym: Oh Joke about how hell freezes over.

335
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:06,630
Rym: that was that was clever.

336
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,034
Rym: That was new media.

337
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:10,380
Scott: Wait, wait, something just bumped into the window here.

338
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,483
Scott: Let me go see what it was.

339
00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:12,586
Rym: Oh flying pig.

340
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,308
Rym: It's still good.

341
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:17,340
Scott: I hear oh my it is indeed a swine with wings.

342
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:22,114
Rym: Yes See ya I could have gone one step further cuz now.

343
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:23,020
Rym: I used to live in Michigan.

344
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:25,727
Rym: Yeah, there is a town called hell in Michigan.

345
00:22:25,747 --> 00:22:40,589
Rym: And yeah, it's real cold there right now, but probably it's been cold there for a long time All right, so I read among other things like Frank Miller's Batman Dark Knight Returns these two comics There's gonna be more but it's

346
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,456
Scott: gonna be one more

347
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:45,551
Rym: Called uh, it's Essex County by Jeff Lemire.

348
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:46,614
Scott: He's Canadian.

349
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:52,271
Scott: I think I think The impression I get the impression he's a Canadian dude, I.

350
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:54,800
Rym: the reason I get that impression is that there.

351
00:22:55,503 --> 00:22:58,052
Rym: Well suffice to say I will talk about this.

352
00:22:58,092 --> 00:23:00,140
Rym: But the second one is about hockey.

353
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:01,378
Rym: The first one has hockey in it.

354
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:16,804
Rym: The second one is a hockey story in the sense that I don't think a human being could write us a story That involves hockey so true to the spirit of the people who like hockey who is not either Canadian or from Northern, Michigan Mm-hmm.

355
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:19,680
Scott: Well, at least they had to be above the Messier line.

356
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:24,352
Rym: Yeah minimum, but this is very very very inside.

357
00:23:24,392 --> 00:23:27,480
Scott: Yes, okay to give you to give you an introduction to these comics.

358
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,995
Scott: Remember, we're only reviewing volumes one and two out of three because the third one's not out yet Or at least I don't have it yet.

359
00:23:34,443 --> 00:23:43,508
Scott: And the back, you know every book lately on the back They will tell you like what genres the book is in and that helps the bookstores You know shelve the books properly.

360
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:45,035
Scott: on the back of this book.

361
00:23:45,076 --> 00:23:49,513
Scott: It's his farm life Slash hockey slash graphic novels.

362
00:23:50,115 --> 00:23:51,300
Scott: that sums it up.

363
00:23:52,301 --> 00:23:54,987
Rym: Farm life hockey graphic novels.

364
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:55,428
Rym: Yep.

365
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,275
Scott: Alright, so let's talk about volume one first.

366
00:23:58,295 --> 00:23:59,298
Scott: Alright, volume one is.

367
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:01,912
Scott: Give me a quick summary of the story.

368
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:09,340
Scott: as a young kid He lives on a farm in Essex County Canada, which is the area in between New York and Michigan.

369
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:13,160
Rym: Yeah, I actually have been through a lot of that area a lot.

370
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:17,371
Rym: I used to drive between RIT and Detroit on a regular basis.

371
00:24:17,552 --> 00:24:18,895
Scott: It's Hicksville, but it's Canada.

372
00:24:19,397 --> 00:24:25,776
Rym: Yeah, and This kid in fact that highway where the there's an there's a car accident in the second volume.

373
00:24:25,957 --> 00:24:26,900
Rym: I've been on that highway.

374
00:24:27,242 --> 00:24:28,410
Rym: It's a super dangerous highway.

375
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,899
Rym: There's car exits like that all the time.

376
00:24:30,742 --> 00:24:42,260
Scott: so the kid likes the superheroes and he wears the mask in the cape and he likes the comic books and he likes the hockey because You know what Canadian doesn't and he lives with his uncle in the middle of nowhere on a boring farm.

377
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:43,626
Scott: And he kind of hates his uncle.

378
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:45,353
Scott: and I feel bad for the uncle.

379
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:49,975
Scott: cuz the uncle is not such a bad uncle He's just doing the best he can, you know, given the circumstances.

380
00:24:49,995 --> 00:24:59,120
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time It's definitely not that kind of real hate It's more the the hate of an adolescent who is living with any adults.

381
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:06,003
Rym: Yeah Cuz you know kids tend to be really kind of dickish to adults and they just I guess they don't think about it until they Get older.

382
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:06,345
Rym: then they go.

383
00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:07,895
Rym: Ah, why'd I act that way when I was a kid?

384
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:21,195
Scott: Yep, and You know, so you have There's a good scene to show the kind of hate that's going on where the kid walks in and the uncles like hey the games On you want to watch the kids like no kid goes upstairs watches the hockey game.

385
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:23,342
Scott: That's that's the kind of hate We're talking about here.

386
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:28,516
Scott: So the kid meets this guy who is a little slow.

387
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:34,892
Scott: ish that he's a weird guy and he's sort of mysterious who works at the gas station and apparently the guy used to be a hockey player.

388
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:45,946
Rym: or You know that the reason they bond is that the kids really into these comic books and the guy is Also kind into comic books.

389
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:47,955
Rym: So he cuts the kid a deal and gives him a comic book.

390
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:48,678
Rym: He couldn't afford.

391
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:52,120
Scott: Yep And you know it it's it's good stuff.

392
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:55,340
Scott: You know what goes on here and it's very it's sort of slice of life.

393
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,064
Scott: You know in that same sort of feeling that goes on the tone of the book is very Slice of life.

394
00:26:00,104 --> 00:26:01,729
Scott: like here are people living their lives.

395
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,281
Scott: Here's stuff that happens, but it's not a slice It's.

396
00:26:05,461 --> 00:26:07,286
Scott: it's what is this kid's life?

397
00:26:07,507 --> 00:26:29,656
Scott: straight through you know from one point in time to another point in time and it shows the character development of this one kid mostly as he as he learns something and grows as a person a bit and It also sort of introduces you to the uncle and to the hockey playing guy who also live in the town and you know things About them which come into play in volume 2.

398
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,946
Rym: now It's pretty good.

399
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:39,319
Rym: It's not the best thing I've ever read though The first volume I kind of was left with this sense of I didn't get much out of it.

400
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,123
Rym: Like I see.

401
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,268
Rym: I see what they were going with it.

402
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,031
Rym: I see what they did.

403
00:26:42,092 --> 00:26:45,107
Rym: I see what the intent was I I get it.

404
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:46,737
Rym: I just didn't really feel a lot.

405
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:55,580
Scott: Yeah for me the first volume it like it does some clever stuff and it's going in the right direction But I don't think it comes on strong enough.

406
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,745
Scott: It feels kind of like.

407
00:26:57,187 --> 00:27:03,353
Scott: you know, they came up with an idea and they did it But they could have done it like more powerfully.

408
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:04,257
Scott: It's like yep.

409
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:04,920
Scott: There it is.

410
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,860
Rym: But then again that might just be because it's the first one.

411
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,503
Rym: There's a little.

412
00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:10,392
Scott: there could be an intentional setup like that.

413
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:16,555
Rym: because the thing is there's a thin thread linking the first one in the second one even though they're effectively completely separate.

414
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:22,077
Rym: and if you wanted to and Actually, if you're not sure if you'll like this stuff, I'd recommend just reading the second one for all.

415
00:27:22,097 --> 00:27:22,740
Scott: but how much is the second?

416
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,362
Scott: One cost there.

417
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:24,869
Scott: look in the back 15 bucks.

418
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:26,155
Scott: Yeah, the first one's 10 bucks.

419
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:27,220
Rym: I think it's worth it.

420
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,312
Rym: The second one is far superior.

421
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:30,680
Scott: The second one is far superior.

422
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,758
Rym: I mean granted when the third one comes out, we'll know if you have to have read the first one.

423
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:38,534
Scott: Yep Well, I do think that there is much that is added to the second one.

424
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:49,378
Scott: if you did read the first one Because when I was reading the second one like I was noted, you know I because I had read the first one I knew things and I kept trying to connect him and that sort of changed the way In which I read the second one.

425
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:53,593
Rym: Well, yeah, but you're trying to figure out who that guy is.

426
00:27:53,613 --> 00:27:56,364
Rym: because you're it starts you're like, oh, it's that guy then Wait a minute.

427
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:57,334
Rym: He doesn't look quite the same.

428
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:57,860
Rym: Huh?

429
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:01,615
Rym: Huh and then you figure out who that guy was.

430
00:28:01,655 --> 00:28:04,220
Rym: you'll know when you read it and That was good.

431
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:17,440
Scott: But yeah, the second one the second volume is a story of some other people who happen to also be in Essex County But it mostly tells the story of just a few of them and their professional or semi-professional hockey playing careers.

432
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,200
Rym: Well see if the first one's about this kid and the guys living with and the weird guy at the store.

433
00:28:22,682 --> 00:28:47,279
Rym: The second one is about two brothers who are hockey players and like the minor league whatevers, but it's told entirely from the perspective of one of the two brothers and It's told as a flashback reminiscence of this old deaf dumb Barely able to stand or think going senile and dying man Just kind of recounting his life to himself because no one else cares.

434
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:50,253
Scott: Actually the thing about it is like early on.

435
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:53,999
Scott: it shows you this is you know There's an old decrepit man who's you know?

436
00:28:54,281 --> 00:29:01,170
Scott: Angry at the world and he's gonna probably gonna die within the you know, not too long because he's so old Sitting on his porch or whatever, you know.

437
00:29:01,412 --> 00:29:06,531
Scott: last and living that is the final days Tell you reminiscing about his life and what went wrong and what weren't right.

438
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:12,913
Scott: and as he read he goes you know flashes back and you sort of forget that it was the this old man for it.

439
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:18,340
Scott: and you're just paying attention because the Flashback is like this whole story and then it goes back to the old man.

440
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:26,320
Rym: You're just like box but what it does and I thought this was very interesting Flashes back in little bits and little chunks and there's a lot of narration of him.

441
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,935
Rym: Just thinking like I did this.

442
00:29:28,036 --> 00:29:29,363
Rym: I did this why did I do this?

443
00:29:29,864 --> 00:29:43,382
Rym: and as it goes on the flashbacks are longer and I guess the lucid moments or the the present moments are shorter as the flashbacks recount his whole life eventually getting up to the point where now he's an old man and I don't know.

444
00:29:43,422 --> 00:29:49,800
Rym: the effect is really really immersive despite the art which we'll get to know that the arts it serves its purpose.

445
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:52,380
Scott: Yeah, it's it's it's a different it's a different style.

446
00:29:52,461 --> 00:30:02,840
Scott: but yes, the The thing I like about the second volume so much is that it's this guy the guy's story itself Has like everything that makes a story awesome.

447
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:09,020
Scott: It's got like, you know, the awesome hockey playing drama, but not the drama of actually the games of hockey.

448
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:16,376
Scott: But you know the sort of like that sideline drama, you know the in the locker room drama going on and it seemed it's so Human.

449
00:30:16,437 --> 00:30:18,730
Scott: the Description of the people's feelings.

450
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,300
Rym: That's a good way to describe it.

451
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,962
Rym: I mean the let.

452
00:30:20,982 --> 00:30:27,805
Rym: the dialogue is all very organic and realistic and it's you feel like you're reading an Actual account of someone's real life.

453
00:30:28,045 --> 00:30:28,487
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

454
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:29,590
Scott: this is how people do.

455
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:35,987
Scott: it's not you know, melodramatic or you know Sensationalized or anything like that.

456
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:36,589
Scott: It's very.

457
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:38,836
Scott: this is how it goes down with people.

458
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:41,144
Scott: It's very real like yeah That that's how you could.

459
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:47,846
Scott: you could imagine that if this is biographical or autobiographical even even though it's It's completely fictional.

460
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:51,160
Scott: It says that Allah is a fictional story.

461
00:30:51,901 --> 00:31:00,168
Scott: Taking place the tales from the farm is the first in a trilogy of graphic novels set in a fictionalized version of Lameer's Hometown of Essex County, Ontario.

462
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:02,640
Scott: So the guy who wrote this he's writing about his town.

463
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:04,229
Scott: So the setting is real.

464
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:09,029
Scott: front is the setting is autobiographical But the characters are made up and the stories made up.

465
00:31:09,831 --> 00:31:11,396
Rym: now in terms of the art.

466
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:17,511
Rym: The art is very Very minimalist and very sketchy and very inconsistent.

467
00:31:17,852 --> 00:31:20,380
Scott: Yeah, it's well, it's not so much inconsistent.

468
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:29,055
Scott: I mean you can always tell you know, unlike a lot of other very stylized, you know arts and comics You can always recognize which characters are which right after.

469
00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:35,466
Rym: well, let me put it this way You know, sometimes you watch an anime or read a comic and you see a character and you recognize them But they're a little off-model.

470
00:31:35,486 --> 00:31:43,160
Rym: it happens every now and then and like ghost in the shell even good anime They get off-model and sometimes they do it so badly that you're not quite sure which character it is.

471
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:44,180
Scott: Is it a new character?

472
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,860
Scott: Is it that character you just saw in the last page here?

473
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,900
Rym: The style is such that you can always tell who someone is mostly by the shape of their nose.

474
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:55,274
Rym: Yeah, but the noses are very important in terms of going off-model.

475
00:31:55,294 --> 00:31:56,819
Rym: There's really no model to go off of.

476
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,466
Scott: Yeah, it's it's very.

477
00:31:58,527 --> 00:31:59,993
Scott: it's a very sketchy kind of.

478
00:32:00,013 --> 00:32:06,369
Scott: I Really don't know how to what to compare it to Sorta a on flux II.

479
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,945
Scott: not really now It's very.

480
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:12,417
Rym: it's very sloppy but purposefully so.

481
00:32:12,437 --> 00:32:12,799
Rym: yeah.

482
00:32:13,282 --> 00:32:23,051
Scott: And he actually changes up the style at certain times like, you know There's parts where it sort of gets a little bit watercolor II and hazy During this flashback scene and there's another.

483
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:29,496
Scott: there's a bunch of pages in the first volume That where the kid drew a comic book and you're reading the comic book that the kid drew.

484
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:30,520
Rym: Oh, that was awful.

485
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:35,340
Rym: It's good, but it looks a lot like the kinds of things you see kids draw.

486
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:41,629
Scott: it looks a lot like the kind of things that I drew when I was drawing comic books and I was yeah aid and That's what makes it so real.

487
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,478
Scott: It's it's actually better than the comics.

488
00:32:43,538 --> 00:32:55,239
Scott: I drew it But it looks literally like some he drew like, you know with a pen some like yeah He must have had a fifth grader draw a comic book and then scanned it in because that's what it looks like.

489
00:32:55,822 --> 00:32:56,706
Rym: One thing I can say though.

490
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:59,480
Rym: That was a little it was that thing at first but then you get used to it.

491
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:06,024
Rym: It's almost like every character is a caricature in that there's really no perspective at all.

492
00:33:06,105 --> 00:33:20,420
Rym: you characters are always facing you pretty much no matter where they're facing and everyone's kind of standing like straight up and odd angles and There's really no sort of consistency in the scenes in terms of where things are placed, but none of that really matters.

493
00:33:21,023 --> 00:33:22,290
Scott: No, it really doesn't at all.

494
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:23,798
Rym: It's kind of like you look at it.

495
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:25,160
Rym: you think wow This is badly drawn.

496
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:33,816
Rym: But then you start reading it and the story is so strong and the art serves its purpose So well that you'll just completely forget and lose track of that and just suddenly you'll finish the story.

497
00:33:34,478 --> 00:33:41,564
Scott: a nice touch I thought with the printing of the book is that on the inside of the back cover it shows the back of a tops Hockey card.

498
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:50,739
Scott: because I have I have some cards from that series of hockey cards, you know like baseball cards But with hockey players on them where it's got like this skate and all the statistics are in the state.

499
00:33:51,354 --> 00:34:02,393
Scott: But Instead of you know having you know, the statistics in the state It's got like, you know, Jeff Lemire's information in inside this, you know, it looks like the back of a card But it's it's cool.

500
00:34:02,453 --> 00:34:04,732
Rym: I like that But I mean, I don't know what else.

501
00:34:04,873 --> 00:34:05,760
Rym: what else I can have to say?

502
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,342
Rym: I don't want to spoil anything at all because you know these are.

503
00:34:08,803 --> 00:34:15,228
Rym: each one of these is basically a standalone story that you can just read and I feel like you should just read it.

504
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,735
Rym: I do recommend these.

505
00:34:16,876 --> 00:34:26,331
Scott: this is definitely High quality high brow sort of non-underwear pervert Canadian comics Available from top shelf productions.

506
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:28,040
Scott: everything they make is highbrow and awesome.

507
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:35,120
Rym: Now if you're not sure if you like this, I really I personally recommend that you just pick up Essex County vol 2 ghost stories.

508
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:35,440
Rym: Yeah,

509
00:34:35,681 --> 00:34:54,860
Scott: I mean you will miss out on some things in vol 2 because you did not read vol 1 but you'll still get it and you'll know if you like it or not and you can always go and get vol 1 then read Vol 2 again and to get the correct experience, I guess and it's only gonna be three volumes So you're just you know one away from the finishing the whole deal.

510
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:59,432
Rym: Yep, and I gotta say at the end of ghost stories pages 218 and 219.

511
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:00,636
Rym: Let me see those pages.

512
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,674
Rym: That was when that happened.

513
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:09,795
Rym: Oh I didn't cry But I that really got to me because these the stories are really sad.

514
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:13,530
Rym: don't come into this expecting It's gonna be some happy fun slice of life.

515
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:20,051
Scott: No, remember these are people on a farm With drama and shitty lives, you know sad things happen.

516
00:35:20,071 --> 00:35:22,056
Scott: There isn't many happy times for these people.

517
00:35:22,116 --> 00:35:27,140
Scott: It's people, you know Recounting their their days and in a boring ass crap town.

518
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:31,420
Rym: Well thing is they recounted in a very realistic way like well in especially in ghost stories.

519
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:39,279
Rym: It's just an old man kind of having his entire life flash before his eyes and he remembers the good and the bad and it kind of.

520
00:35:39,882 --> 00:35:51,284
Rym: It kind of follows the way memory goes where the the big moments and the important Conversations and the things that mattered stand out and as a result he remembers them more and all the Everything in between.

521
00:35:51,324 --> 00:35:53,432
Rym: that isn't really good or really bad.

522
00:35:53,873 --> 00:35:55,800
Rym: Just kind of faded into the background of memory.

523
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,927
Rym: So it's very much like a trip through someone's mind.

524
00:35:58,309 --> 00:35:58,509
Scott: Yep.

525
00:35:59,152 --> 00:36:02,564
Scott: There's even points it where you know, cuz it's the guy, you know Recounting his stuff.

526
00:36:02,584 --> 00:36:03,086
Scott: There's some stuff.

527
00:36:03,106 --> 00:36:04,009
Scott: He just doesn't remember it.

528
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:05,655
Scott: He's like, yeah, this is all I remember from that.

529
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:08,906
Scott: Oh Is there anything else to say about this?

530
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:09,909
Rym: Not really?

531
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:13,140
Scott: No, what kind of person would like this you think?

532
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,320
Rym: Honestly anyone who likes hockey I'm serious not just you know, like oh, I'm a hockey fan blah.

533
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:24,500
Rym: But they're you know, those people who are hockey people, especially if they live north of the Messier line.

534
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:27,412
Rym: If you like hockey, you'll really like ghost.

535
00:36:27,493 --> 00:36:46,573
Scott: Yeah, whether you like comics or not but even if you don't like hockey if you like sort of really sort of mellow and Not heartwarming but Poignant I've been saying that word a lot There's not many other words sort of like, you know sort of like it's.

536
00:36:46,693 --> 00:36:54,823
Scott: it's not sad like, you know balling all over the place but it's sort of like calmly said like It's just this vaguely Hurtful.

537
00:36:54,863 --> 00:37:04,506
Rym: just that person like you see this person recounting the mistakes They made in their past and you know, it's a mistake and they know it was a mistake But it already happened.

538
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:07,519
Rym: and all they can do is tell you what happened because of that mistake.

539
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:11,072
Scott: Yep, and it's it just it sort of just goes down.

540
00:37:11,092 --> 00:37:16,068
Scott: if you like that kind of thing and you like comics These are worth reading very much.

541
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,936
Scott: So and you top shelf doesn't print stuff.

542
00:37:17,956 --> 00:37:18,599
Scott: That's not good.

543
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:48,420
Rym: Yep There's another part that really got me where the old man he's going through his things because he can't sleep and he he finds a book of photographs and newspaper clippings and letters from his brother and They pretty much just give you that entire photo book in the comic and you can just read through it and it's just the newspaper clippings and the actual letters and well actual in terms of the story and these actual photographs and They're really kind of sad and touching especially knowing what's going on in the story.

544
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:59,823
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty rough, you know and you sort of get the same feeling when you read that that the old man would get when he takes it out and looks At it and it's sort of like wow That's good Comicking when you can do.

545
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:08,840
Rym: this comic does a very good job of getting you to really empathize with the main character the old man Whichever character they want you to empathize with at any moment in time.

546
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:10,025
Rym: You're pretty much in this one.

547
00:38:10,045 --> 00:38:10,507
Rym: You follow.

548
00:38:10,527 --> 00:38:11,933
Scott: the old man is volume two.

549
00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:13,600
Scott: You're pretty much the old man the whole time.

550
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:14,825
Scott: Yeah in volume one.

551
00:38:14,845 --> 00:38:16,915
Rym: I felt bad for everyone.

552
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:18,080
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

553
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:22,574
Scott: Yeah, there's a thing about volume one is a slight ambiguity, but I want to spoil it.

554
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:23,658
Scott: So I'll ask you after.

555
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:26,769
Rym: but uh Yeah, oh, I know you're getting that.

556
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:28,256
Rym: Yeah, I wasn't sure either.

557
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:30,205
Rym: Yeah, okay I really don't know.

558
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:33,560
Rym: I think the third one is gonna wrap that up because I don't know what happened.

559
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,640
Scott: Well, I don't think I I don't know anyway, yeah, I don't want to spoil it.

560
00:38:37,922 --> 00:38:41,957
Rym: Maybe we'll talk about probably talk about it again Once the third one comes out at least to you know.

561
00:38:42,441 --> 00:38:45,820
Rym: Say if the first one mattered or if it tied together or what the end result was.

562
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,440
Rym: We're not gonna do some sort of final thoughts.

563
00:38:48,540 --> 00:39:11,419
Rym: this is what this symbolized and this is what I thought about when that happened, but I Really think this is a good book to read and especially I think that ghost stories is a good gift to get for I'm not gonna say this in a stereotypical way But an older person because it's definitely you know someone looking back at their life and I could see how someone who has lived a very long life would read this and

564
00:39:12,202 --> 00:39:12,483
Scott: Get it.

565
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:23,528
Scott: Yeah, this is not a bad comic to get some older maybe anti comic minded people to accept a comic as a Respectable form of artistic expression nothing else.

566
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:25,133
Rym: get this comic for your dad.

567
00:39:25,514 --> 00:39:26,718
Scott: Yeah, sure or your mom.

568
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:30,953
Rym: Yeah All right, I know it was a little bit of a short episode.

569
00:39:30,973 --> 00:39:31,455
Rym: but what do you want?

570
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:32,640
Rym: we're tired tired.

571
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:37,398
Scott: There isn't really that much to say without spoiling it and we want to do a review and not a plot synopsis.

572
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:42,156
Rym: tomorrow We'll be good because we're gonna our things of the day might turn into the whole show.

573
00:39:42,176 --> 00:39:44,134
Rym: Oh Great that.
