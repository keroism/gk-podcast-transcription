00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,686
Rym: It's Thursday, February 8th.

2
00:00:12,107 --> 00:00:15,636
Rym: I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:17,360
Rym: We talk about professionalism.

4
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:20,275
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,383 --> 00:00:29,216
Scott: Well today I woke up and When I got myself together at around I don't know nine.

6
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:30,260
Scott: I did my usual business.

7
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:33,069
Scott: I took the 1050 train to the city.

8
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:35,798
Scott: I got to the city like noonish.

9
00:00:35,819 --> 00:00:44,273
Scott: I Went in I saw the new office, which is all fancy And I said all right now that I've seen your new office, and it's all fancy.

10
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:46,319
Scott: I quit I'm out.

11
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:49,289
Rym: So how'd they take it?

12
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:54,297
Scott: they were just kind of like oh well you know Good luck.

13
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:57,119
Scott: Where are you working all right?

14
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,490
Scott: We still like you come back if you want.

15
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:05,501
Scott: Yeah, and that was it all right.

16
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,430
Rym: They make you sign any non-competes or anything.

17
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:08,254
Scott: I didn't.

18
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:10,244
Scott: I think I signed a non-compete when I got there.

19
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:11,933
Rym: ah See I would.

20
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:15,050
Rym: I don't think I would have taken a job that made me sign something like that in the first place.

21
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:16,970
Scott: Well, it wasn't a bad non-compete.

22
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:17,712
Scott: It wasn't like.

23
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:27,502
Scott: you know is one kind of non-compete that says let's say you're a plumber right and you work for someone plumbing There's a non-compete that says you can't plumb for anyone else.

24
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:28,546
Scott: It's like great.

25
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:40,530
Scott: Well now my only skill I'm not allowed to use anywhere, but here this non-compete was pretty much I couldn't work for a competing company, so I'm working for a company that provides small business services.

26
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:47,810
Scott: Well, I was until today, so I couldn't go work at another company that provides small business services.

27
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:52,245
Rym: Yeah, I just generally really don't feel comfortable signing agreements like that.

28
00:01:52,405 --> 00:02:00,190
Scott: when it got in regards to my employment I generally don't like you know signing a lot of kinds of agreements, and I'm hoping at the new place I'm not gonna have to sign so much bullshit.

29
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:03,330
Scott: I'm getting the feeling I won't because it's a private company and not a public company.

30
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:06,350
Scott: So they're not beholden to shareholders.

31
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:11,170
Scott: So they don't make you sign shit that you know they don't care about because who's who's gonna complain?

32
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:19,770
Rym: I just remember was funny that when I left IBM They made me sign a lot more stuff than when I got hired by IBM.

33
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:26,497
Scott: Yeah, all I had to do was I had to sign a thing that says yes They told me all these things like you know.

34
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:30,170
Scott: yes, I was informed that I can't talk about patents.

35
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,762
Scott: Yes, I was informed that I can't reveal trade secrets.

36
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:33,344
Scott: Yes, you know.

37
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,299
Scott: and then I had to say yes I gave back all this equipment.

38
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:48,684
Scott: Yes, okay, and then they were like They were like ten questions, and I could answer yes or no, and it was like you know Do you think you were managed well?

39
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:50,310
Scott: Do you think you know?

40
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,829
Scott: Was your job rewarding?

41
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:57,124
Scott: Etc etc, and I was just like yes, no, maybe you know CS.

42
00:02:57,145 --> 00:03:03,515
Scott: Yes most of them were yes actually Except the rewarding was no Not rewarding job.

43
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:03,936
Scott: Well.

44
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,079
Rym: I mean honestly.

45
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:11,678
Rym: I don't think I've ever had a rewarding job at least in terms of my career advancement Or my degree or the stuff.

46
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:14,730
Scott: I know or I'm good at and it's not not rewarding in money.

47
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,497
Scott: I mean the job I had until today.

48
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:17,902
Scott: the money was enough.

49
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:19,710
Scott: You know the people there.

50
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:20,413
Scott: They weren't the.

51
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:23,410
Scott: you know they weren't like my best friends, but they were all cool.

52
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:24,336
Scott: I couldn't.

53
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:26,190
Scott: you know you it'd be tough to ask for better.

54
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,942
Scott: You know considering all these people who complain about their evil boss.

55
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:31,574
Scott: Yeah, my boss Didn't.

56
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:34,250
Scott: I didn't do work for a whole year, and he didn't say anything.

57
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:34,874
Scott: That's you know.

58
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:36,785
Scott: and when I go to see him in the city.

59
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:39,899
Scott: He's always like hey What's going on happy to see me and all that.

60
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,714
Scott: yeah, so yeah, they're not bad people It's just.

61
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:46,343
Scott: I was tired of sitting in the middle of nowhere doing nothing.

62
00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:53,458
Scott: Yeah, I made that clear I gave back my laptop after erasing it and That's that.

63
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:58,629
Rym: yep well I guess now I better get a new job to keep up with the Joneses since now you make more money than me.

64
00:03:59,051 --> 00:03:59,914
Scott: Yes, I do.

65
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:06,750
Scott: I have a 35% more money than I used to be making at my new job Which I who knows when I'm gonna start it probably a few weeks.

66
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:10,607
Rym: Yeah, well plus your company apparently is paying for your two weeks, but you don't have to work.

67
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:16,206
Scott: Yeah I'm getting paid at my current job until the 15th, and I'm also getting paid for any vacation days.

68
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:33,389
Scott: I did not use and my insurances and my benefits last until the end of the month and Then this Cobra which can allow me to use them even longer if I need to because who knows at the new job usually Like your new benefits don't kick in for 90 days or some crap like that.

69
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:37,407
Scott: So I might have to use the Cobra to go to the dentist or something.

70
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:39,275
Rym: yeah Well actually my the job.

71
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:43,350
Rym: I got my benefits kicked in in me almost immediately like within two weeks.

72
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:48,889
Scott: Bing yeah at the car at the job that I just quit from the benefits didn't kick in was it 30 days?

73
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:49,854
Scott: six It was a while.

74
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:51,304
Rym: Yeah, well technically the company.

75
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:52,209
Rym: I'm working for now, too.

76
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:55,668
Rym: They originally you know you don't start a crewing vacation for the first 90 days.

77
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:57,976
Scott: Oh, I hate that,

78
00:04:58,076 --> 00:05:10,824
Rym: but I basically said I'm gonna take a bunch of vacation This month when I start with you, and then I'm gonna take a bunch of more vacation two months later, and they said well We'll just start a crew in your vacation now, and I said that's fine

79
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:11,669
Scott: all right.

80
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:19,197
Scott: Yeah other also because I just gave back my laptop to its Technical owners.

81
00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:20,142
Rym: now Scott's got this.

82
00:05:20,343 --> 00:05:21,770
Rym: I have to go buy one.

83
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:26,949
Rym: Scott's got some dead tree with some words printed on it that he's staring at in front of his microphone.

84
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:27,210
Rym: boom.

85
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,890
Rym: Yeah, yeah, hey at least he got the boom now, so now you can use that extra hand to hold that piece of paper.

86
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:35,641
Scott: Yeah, you know like the microphone boom.

87
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:39,496
Scott: I was like yeah, I don't need no stinking microphone stand You know whatever.

88
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:43,030
Scott: and then I was like all right, you know whatever we'll get one at RadioShack.

89
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:49,070
Scott: It was like 30-something bucks for the stand and the boom stick and this is my boom stick boom stick.

90
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:58,348
Scott: And you know I didn't realize this when I got it But the huge advantage of having the microphone on some sort of stand or boom is that both of my hands are free.

91
00:05:58,368 --> 00:05:58,449
Scott: when?

92
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:10,430
Scott: Podcasting up until yesterday I was podcasting with one hand on the microphone So now when I get a new laptop I can type on it and podcast at the same time.

93
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:14,260
Rym: Yeah Though I will see if you actually get that laptop in any reasonable span.

94
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,541
Rym: as we've discovered there aren't actually any easy ways to buy Good laptops anywhere.

95
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:20,970
Scott: Yeah, check this shit, right?

96
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:21,793
Scott: I want to get.

97
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:25,448
Scott: I looked I did research and I want decided I want this x60.

98
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:28,017
Scott: I'm still like this information.

99
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:44,770
Scott: I want to know to decide between the ThinkPad x60 and the x60 s but besides that on The Lenovo website I can get the x60 for like $1,800 and it comes with a core 2 duo and one and a half gigs of RAM and the better battery and all this stuff.

100
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:55,258
Scott: right if I buy that same thing for Newegg with half a gig of RAM so one-third the RAM and You know everything else.

101
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,626
Scott: note the small battery.

102
00:06:56,646 --> 00:07:00,701
Scott: It's $2,200 from Newegg the place that's supposed to be discounted.

103
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:01,765
Scott: What the hell.

104
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:03,210
Scott: it makes no sense.

105
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,816
Rym: I don't know when it comes to anything like that.

106
00:07:04,977 --> 00:07:10,078
Rym: if I can I try to just buy direct and I pay whatever the company That makes it would want me to pay.

107
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:12,129
Scott: I think I'm just gonna have to cave in.

108
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,928
Scott: I'll buy it from the Lenovo website and wait two weeks for the descended to me.

109
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:25,108
Rym: So anyway in the news people in our forums posted this we're talking about it, but CNN had this kind of skewed.

110
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:34,429
Rym: Oh No, the atheist segment not too long ago Great and the funny thing is the internet responded in kind.

111
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:39,570
Rym: now I've noticed over time that dig is very much generally pro atheist.

112
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:48,666
Rym: you can see that in any religion thread where generally atheist comments get dug way the hell up and Religious comments get dug away the hell down.

113
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:57,676
Scott: Yeah Well, I mean when you have a site that's editorial like most sites were prior to dig actually coming out and saying yeah We're actually gonna do that crazy idea.

114
00:07:57,716 --> 00:08:01,730
Scott: Everyone's been yelling about for ten years since slashdot started.

115
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:12,376
Scott: You know stuff that was super controversial like that or super one-sided would always kind of go and You know, it wouldn't get posted.

116
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:21,801
Scott: you wouldn't post a story on the front page of slashdot that was like there's no God but on dig, you know, there is a democracy there of some kind.

117
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:26,993
Scott: however, it may be swayed by Networks of people and Scheming.

118
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:27,737
Scott: well, it's not that.

119
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:33,590
Rym: it's just that there's a lot of atheists on dig And I think it's starting to come out that the internet as a whole has a lot.

120
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,770
Rym: I mean before like atheists weren't really prominent like they were just there.

121
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,765
Rym: you didn't know if someone was an atheist didn't care.

122
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:45,768
Rym: but More and more inflammatory things happen and dig reacts and you realize that the majority of the people there are atheists.

123
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:51,501
Scott: Well Atheists tend to be smart people So smart people the Internet's.

124
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:52,104
Rym: anyway.

125
00:08:52,124 --> 00:09:16,890
Rym: CNN did this thing and immediately there was a story on dig about it and it got a crazy number of digs and comments and the very first comment with a crazy number of up digs was basically a link to the CNN feedback thing and Apparently everyone on dig followed it because all the people who were on this segment Got all sorts of thousands and thousands and thousands of rather displeased emails and CNN got crazy complaints.

126
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:27,221
Rym: Now we don't know if CNN had planned this already or if they're just reacting or what but apparently tonight as we're doing GeekNights Richard Dawkins is going to be on CNN.

127
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,110
Scott: Oh, that's a funny coincidence.

128
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,073
Scott: You have there now.

129
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:38,682
Rym: someone in the forum suggested that maybe CNN did this on purpose and there's no way Anyone at CNN is that smart?

130
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,510
Rym: No, they didn't plan this.

131
00:09:40,811 --> 00:09:45,768
Rym: I imagine that there's a guy in charge of programming for whatever that night and he's sitting there and his aid comes in.

132
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:49,843
Rym: and Sir, we got a million complaints about that atheist thing.

133
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:55,027
Rym: What atheists think that thing we did Crap, we better do the opposite side of that thing.

134
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:58,301
Rym: get that Richard Dickens guy I keep hearing about in the news.

135
00:09:58,321 --> 00:09:59,024
Rym: He wrote some book.

136
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:02,173
Scott: Uh-huh Yeah, it just.

137
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:14,690
Scott: it pleases me to see that now the opinion of the Internet is starting to have some sort of effect like people Who are in the old media are starting to get it a little bit like the tiniest bit of getting it.

138
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:17,581
Scott: They don't have it by far but they're starting to get it.

139
00:10:17,762 --> 00:10:19,890
Rym: There's that newspaper guy who said yeah, you know what?

140
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,712
Rym: We might not be printed in for top five years I don't care.

141
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:26,587
Rym: and there was snakes on a plane which would never have happened without the Internet.

142
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:30,523
Rym: while it was bad At least they noticed that the Internet was there and they tried.

143
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:31,125
Scott: Yeah.

144
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:40,670
Scott: Yeah, whatever It's like we got the hook like it's starting to stab the tongue But we haven't hooked him and reeled him in yet when they're in my boat and I'm cooking him.

145
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:43,665
Rym: Then we'll be all set and then we'll see the juggernaut.

146
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:44,650
Rym: live-action movies.

147
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,069
Scott: Okay That movie be such a bitch.

148
00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:56,192
Scott: Okay alright, so I Don't know.

149
00:10:56,212 --> 00:11:06,195
Scott: we've talked about this before on the show But it's it's well known probably among most of our longer time listeners that we are Skeptical of things.

150
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:08,100
Rym: God Scott is skeptical of me.

151
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:14,730
Rym: when I come home and I tell him something like I had pizza for lunch Like what kind of pizza you didn't have a pizza?

152
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:18,564
Scott: Well, it's mostly I'll be skeptical and Rym exaggerate something like.

153
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:20,090
Scott: he'll say I had the best pizza today.

154
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,060
Scott: I'm like, no, there's no way you had the best pizza today.

155
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,485
Rym: No, cuz I had the best pizza.

156
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:27,250
Rym: I had that day that day whatever.

157
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:36,198
Scott: anyway, one thing that we are skeptical of is The belief that there are aliens Visiting us.

158
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:36,541
Scott: Yes.

159
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:36,985
Rym: Okay.

160
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:39,096
Rym: There we go Cuz you know Carl Sagan and all that.

161
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:44,335
Rym: it is totally within the realm that there is life out there somewhere in the billions and billions there probably is.

162
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:57,925
Scott: the odds are that out in the universe there is some sort of life other than human beings on some other Planet or maybe in between the planets or on a Sun or on a moon.

163
00:11:57,945 --> 00:11:59,610
Rym: good odds that there's intelligent life out there.

164
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:24,988
Rym: however based on all we know about the laws of physics and based on the fact that By and large the only people who claim to see UFOs are idiots of delusional and or drunken people or people who really have no credibility anyway, and also the fact that Despite the fact that we've got you know cameras everywhere now everyone has cameras high definition this and that.

165
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:28,520
Rym: and yet How come there really aren't any more UFO pictures?

166
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,799
Scott: Well, there are but all of them are incredibly blurry Or incredibly over.

167
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,985
Rym: there's the string.

168
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:35,949
Rym: Oh my god.

169
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:38,096
Scott: Yeah, I would believe it.

170
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:45,922
Scott: actually I kind of want to believe in aliens and stuff, but the evidence is so flimsy Good God when I was a little kid.

171
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:46,404
Rym: It's like.

172
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:57,058
Scott: it's like if It's almost as if like a three-year-old kid like pulls a prank to get his mom To believe that his brother did something bad.

173
00:12:57,158 --> 00:13:01,290
Scott: It's that much of a sham job yet all these people believe it.

174
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:07,794
Rym: you mean like my little brother when he would punch himself in the arm until he got a bruise and then yell for our Mother and she'd come in.

175
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:08,176
Rym: he'd yell.

176
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:15,069
Rym: He hit me and ah, ah The the absolute outrage that I would feel because there was nothing I could do.

177
00:13:15,612 --> 00:13:17,298
Rym: I mean I try to explain.

178
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,763
Rym: no he was hitting himself.

179
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:19,807
Rym: He was hitting himself.

180
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:20,650
Rym: I didn't do it.

181
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,470
Rym: There's no way any parents gonna believe that right?

182
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:33,289
Scott: So anyone who believes that there are gray men from Mars walking around and that Roswell was something other than a military project of some sort You're a nut job.

183
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:40,036
Rym: According to us see when I was a little and according to psychologists and psychiatrists when I was a little kid I kind of believe.

184
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:45,562
Scott: oh, I totally believe like when I was in middle school Watch all those shows like I read.

185
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:47,230
Scott: I totally watched all the same show.

186
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,895
Rym: I read Fate magazine and I watch.

187
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:52,226
Rym: I read a hundred and I watched unsolved mysteries.

188
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:57,602
Scott: my first website That I ever made had like a little section like ooh, they're aliens.

189
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:59,187
Rym: OMG what you're.

190
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:01,255
Rym: by the time I knew how to make a website.

191
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:02,359
Rym: I was well past that.

192
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:05,090
Scott: No, it was in my second website that section disappeared.

193
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:07,278
Rym: When did you make your first website?

194
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:10,310
Rym: Cuz that was must have been late middle school high school at the early.

195
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:13,375
Scott: I think it was like 1995 or six.

196
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:14,157
Rym: All right.

197
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:18,291
Scott: All right, and then I got made a new website in 97 98.

198
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:29,330
Rym: I stopped believing there were aliens and pretty much fifth or sixth grade when I started reading real newspapers And I kind of really didn't start believing in the aliens until like seventh or eighth grades.

199
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:35,715
Rym: Oh, I believe when I was a little little kid cuz I'd watch I'd watch unsolved mysteries and they'd be like so scared to watch Unsolved mysteries a little.

200
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:41,770
Scott: it wasn't until middle school and I was brave enough to watch unsolved mysteries that I believed See you were probably smarter.

201
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,558
Rym: I was more like Bill Cosby as a kid.

202
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:48,159
Rym: right watch the unsolved mysteries and I Wouldn't be afraid of it and I'd be fine.

203
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,525
Rym: My parents really you're gonna have nightmares.

204
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:52,037
Rym: You're gonna come crying You're gonna like no mom.

205
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:54,409
Scott: Unsolved mysteries is a scary show for a little kids.

206
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:57,767
Scott: But I was like there's one that was all about George Washington's ghost.

207
00:14:57,948 --> 00:15:00,775
Rym: Oh, yeah It didn't bother me at all.

208
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:14,990
Rym: Mm-hmm until you know, it's time to leave grandma's house, you know I'm sitting at grandma's house and there's the Grandma's house also cuz my grandma yeah But there was this giant window that went out to the like the back carport and this other giant window.

209
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:16,676
Rym: There are a lot of dark places.

210
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:20,570
Rym: my grandma's house cuz the house was gigantic and they didn't leave all the lights on.

211
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:22,725
Rym: So normally I'd be watching the show.

212
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:32,757
Rym: I'd be like, yeah And then after like the second child murderer mystery is talked about I keep thinking I see someone lurking outside But I'd be too afraid to act like.

213
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:35,469
Rym: I saw it cuz then they'd know I knew and then they'd get me.

214
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:39,636
Scott: I'm just glad that shows off the air Show the UFO and I'd swear.

215
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:49,690
Rym: one time we're going home from my grandma's house and I swear in the car next to us I saw the dude from the unsolved mysteries driving and he looked at me and I was like, oh crap.

216
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:51,850
Rym: And I told my mom and she told me to be quiet.

217
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,879
Rym: I'm so afraid you so my home and get me.

218
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,386
Rym: so my news cares about your news.

219
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:07,289
Scott: So apparently The are the military of Chile the country Chile in South America, Chile, Chile.

220
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:12,661
Scott: the military there Believes in UFOs and aliens and shit.

221
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,046
Rym: that doesn't surprise.

222
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:28,850
Scott: there was an international Ufology Convent conference of some sort and these big-name guys from the Chilean military came and did Presentations and stuff and they yeah, it was kind of crazy.

223
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:49,130
Scott: Here at the conference was retired official Armando Valdez who is noted for his involvement in one of Chile's first documented UFO abductions which became known as the Valdez case 77 wait Minute Valdez along with five members of an army patrol saw two bright objects descending from the sky.

224
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:50,694
Scott: They set out.

225
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,181
Scott: Oh Valdez set out alone to investigate.

226
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,746
Scott: according to the men simply vanished.

227
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:59,049
Scott: 15 minutes later They said he reappeared tried to speak and passed out.

228
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:05,729
Scott: The date on his watch had been advanced five days and he had a mini head about a week's growth of beard.

229
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:07,777
Rym: You know what now?

230
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:18,748
Rym: normally I'd say there's prior rational explanation but I'd go one step further and say that these guys just made that bullshit up to cover for something they were doing my Either that or they were all doing drugs.

231
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:20,935
Rym: No, it wasn't drug.

232
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:24,429
Rym: I'm almost certain that they made it up to cover up them not doing their job.

233
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,608
Scott: Who knows?

234
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,543
Rym: Either way, maybe I mean, I don't understand the rationale.

235
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:39,795
Rym: some of these people like if I actually saw An alien like if an alien came into my window and I saw one I'd tell everyone be like, yeah, but What would it take?

236
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:40,196
Rym: you can't?

237
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:41,642
Rym: I mean who would make that up?

238
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:45,776
Rym: who would sit down and I'm gonna act like aliens abducted me because that I think.

239
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:55,411
Scott: another problem is that you make up a story like this and you tell it to yourself and You tell it to your friends and you tell it to people so many times you end up believing it yourself that that's what really Happened.

240
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:57,518
Scott: because you you know that happened to me.

241
00:17:57,639 --> 00:17:59,726
Rym: who tells it in the first place.

242
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:00,890
Scott: I don't know man.

243
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,639
Rym: I mean, that's the logical leap there.

244
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,914
Rym: I can understand believe in your own lie Yeah.

245
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:13,606
Scott: Anyway, I'm just gonna say People are still crazy about these UFOs cuz I it is died down in recent years.

246
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,970
Scott: the craziness about UFOs.

247
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:23,210
Rym: it was much stronger in the 90s and Well, the 90s were that magical era where the internet existed, but it wasn't that widely available.

248
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:24,398
Rym: So there were still that.

249
00:18:24,881 --> 00:18:26,289
Rym: check out this picture of a UFO.

250
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:27,635
Rym: No one's debunked this.

251
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:32,673
Rym: check out this magazine that has all this evidence and you didn't have an internet to just go Obviously refute it.

252
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:34,779
Rym: So you'd say oh a scientific paper.

253
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:45,418
Scott: I have to believe that I remember one time I sent in like a Freedom of Information Act request for like Information about Roswell and stuff really?

254
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:47,264
Scott: Yeah, I might still have it somewhere.

255
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:48,549
Scott: what what they sent back?

256
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:52,729
Scott: It was just a bunch of papers with stuff blacked out.

257
00:18:54,112 --> 00:18:56,203
Scott: It wasn't very interesting or didn't?

258
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:57,107
Scott: nor did it make sense.

259
00:18:57,228 --> 00:19:04,099
Rym: see nowadays they'll send you a redacted PDF where you can just take the black bars away cuz they Remember that story.

260
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:13,004
Rym: Oh, yeah, that was funny Things of the day.

261
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:16,252
Rym: I now have to conclude my awesome rims.

262
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:18,658
Rym: Hitler was born to be alive theme week.

263
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,120
Scott: Oh Shit, I wonder what Scott's theme is gonna be next week.

264
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:22,782
Rym: I don't know.

265
00:19:22,943 --> 00:19:25,111
Rym: Scott gave me a preview and I'm not.

266
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:25,653
Scott: I don't know if I'm.

267
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:27,420
Scott: I haven't sold on that theme yet.

268
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,546
Rym: See, I'm not Totally worried.

269
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,780
Rym: I'm not thinking like Scott's gonna steamroller me.

270
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,414
Rym: But at the same time, I don't know if you can top.

271
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:37,860
Rym: Hitler was born to be alive week.

272
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:38,978
Scott: I don't know.

273
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:56,260
Scott: See the thing is while your theme itself in essence is high quality the actual things of the day Selected to support your theme while the first one of course embodied your theme entirely I don't know if all your things of the day are as Great as the idea that your theme project.

274
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,666
Rym: Well, the thing is the first thing.

275
00:19:57,686 --> 00:20:02,087
Rym: I mean anyone who hasn't listened to the rest of this week should look at all of my Things of the day this week.

276
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:04,140
Rym: The first one was probably my favorite.

277
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:08,940
Rym: It's what spawned at all that music video set to Hitler singing born to be alive.

278
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:10,470
Rym: That was boring.

279
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:15,692
Rym: But the thing is the the Hitler needs a car.

280
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:16,855
Rym: that isn't a rice car thing.

281
00:20:16,895 --> 00:20:18,540
Rym: I think was incredibly hilarious.

282
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:20,449
Scott: It was definitely the funny.

283
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,620
Scott: I don't know if it was incredibly hilarious.

284
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:31,045
Rym: it was the funny and the fact that we found that video of that kid dancing in that whatever thing to that other techno remix of That was all.

285
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:32,274
Scott: I enjoyed that one a lot.

286
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:33,100
Scott: just cuz I like this.

287
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,293
Rym: Yeah, I think the theme it wasn't so much the theme.

288
00:20:35,413 --> 00:20:36,520
Rym: Hitler was born to be alive.

289
00:20:36,641 --> 00:20:48,798
Rym: It was that by choosing the theme from that first thing of the day I ended up finding these weird funny things of the day that I never would have found otherwise Unless I was searching for this one weird thing.

290
00:20:49,921 --> 00:21:03,319
Scott: So rather than just accept what normally comes through the pipeline on dig as being popular and everyone's already seen it you Pick something and you search for that something and then you find the best stuff that comes up for that search.

291
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:11,494
Rym: now I remember I used to do that in the early days of Google video once the top of hon But you would always just search for puned or cool or funny or cat.

292
00:21:11,514 --> 00:21:13,562
Rym: Yeah, and then one day I thought you know What.

293
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:21,379
Rym: I wonder how I could find something awesome That no one else has already seen or something that just isn't in the internet presence right now.

294
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:28,103
Rym: so I searched for the word British and I found a bunch of funny stuff and I searched for a couple other random words and Found funny things.

295
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:42,597
Rym: In fact back when penny arcade used to have the awesome archive search that they since totally gimped I remember sometimes I type a random word in and it would give me a semi random sampling of penny arcades to read Yeah, those are the good days now books.

296
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:46,776
Scott: Yep Which are scary once you look inside it's certain pieces.

297
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:54,399
Rym: Oh, I was reading Oh the third penny arcade book has references to when the Xbox came out and I thought that wasn't that long ago was it?

298
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:58,500
Scott: It's only it's the third penny arcade book, right?

299
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,917
Scott: So the third year of penny arcade the Xbox one came out and you know what year.

300
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:06,744
Scott: that was 2002.

301
00:22:06,744 --> 00:22:08,069
Rym: you know what made me feel even older.

302
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:10,600
Rym: we're gonna do a show on this as soon as I convinced Scott to watch it.

303
00:22:11,022 --> 00:22:28,700
Rym: But I got a copy of this thing that I saw in 1993 on TV called wild palms, which was the science fiction kind of awesome made-for-tv movie in two parts and I just realized now that I finally after all these years got a hold of it again.

304
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:33,519
Rym: I want to see now if what I think of it is the same as what my 11 year old self thought of it.

305
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:35,589
Scott: Mmm, but we will find out next.

306
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:50,369
Rym: it turns out that it's set in the year 2007 totally out of the blue which made me at least it's no crystalis God But yeah, at least anytime I think I'm feeling a little old.

307
00:22:50,389 --> 00:22:59,434
Rym: I remember that old man Scott Johnson will always be older than us But anyway, I had a bunch of candidates for how to finish off.

308
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:00,860
Rym: Hitler was born to be alive week.

309
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:01,764
Rym: I have this.

310
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:08,919
Rym: there was this funny animation of Hitler singing in his bunker and There was this stupid rat music video to Hitler and all this stuff.

311
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:19,120
Rym: There was also and I realized that what I should do is I should you know, like a firework show Where they have you know little firework little firework and then they shoot a whole bunch off at once as the finale.

312
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:26,899
Rym: So what I got here are all the straight-up music videos to this song that are not jokes.

313
00:23:28,503 --> 00:23:43,328
Rym: these are actual music videos or Things that are what music videos were before MTV came, you know, just a video of the band playing of this song various techno remixes Perhaps my favorite other than the original.

314
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:44,512
Rym: let's talk about him in order.

315
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:46,980
Rym: There's the original the original video by Patrick Hernandez.

316
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:57,894
Rym: There are about 40 as far as I can tell different performances of him doing this song and I don't think he ever did another song Ever that he was a one-hit wonder.

317
00:23:57,934 --> 00:23:59,100
Scott: I'm sure that he had an album.

318
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:00,666
Scott: I'm sure we could get that album.

319
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:04,640
Rym: He also everything else in the album is probably crap doesn't look the way you think he would look.

320
00:24:05,141 --> 00:24:06,164
Rym: He's kind of scary.

321
00:24:06,184 --> 00:24:09,995
Rym: He has this weird kind of dance that all the videos of him.

322
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:11,660
Rym: He does the same dance with this cane.

323
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:12,368
Scott: That's it.

324
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,320
Scott: Looks like a child malaise.

325
00:24:15,242 --> 00:24:21,975
Rym: You don't realize how weird he says the word Bart until you listen to this song a bunch of times and then you see the shape of his mouth when he says it.

326
00:24:22,036 --> 00:24:26,820
Rym: and Also, it's just he's kind of weird.

327
00:24:27,462 --> 00:24:29,329
Scott: I don't know why it was a one-hit wonder.

328
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:32,300
Scott: people, you know, the song was good enough that they would tolerate it.

329
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,066
Scott: But everything else you're just like get the hell out of here.

330
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:37,759
Rym: So then there's this punk rock metal band.

331
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:46,072
Rym: Oh, I didn't listen to enough of them to figure out what genre they're actually in But they covered this song and I think what stands out the most.

332
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:51,291
Rym: aside from the fact that you know Bands like, you know the guar style of band.

333
00:24:51,331 --> 00:24:52,375
Rym: They have their face.

334
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:58,853
Rym: when they're playing that like Kind of face, you know that the scowl the whatever they're doing.

335
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,260
Scott: Yeah, most most metal bands have a face.

336
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:03,158
Rym: These guys have a diarrhea face.

337
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:12,240
Rym: Now more importantly what stood out more than anything was the fact that the guy has a base in the shape of a coffin.

338
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:15,172
Scott: That obviously I'm pretty sure he made it himself.

339
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:19,195
Rym: It's so lame and It's so tacky.

340
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:19,880
Rym: They're terrible.

341
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,771
Rym: Now the worst thing is if you watch this video look at the YouTube comments.

342
00:25:22,811 --> 00:25:23,634
Rym: the comments aren't.

343
00:25:23,995 --> 00:25:25,240
Rym: what the fuck is this band?

344
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,423
Rym: This is scary.

345
00:25:26,704 --> 00:25:30,619
Rym: The comments are yeah, that was from the coffin era of this band.

346
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,205
Scott: Wow If my band has a coffin era Just shoot me.

347
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:38,174
Rym: that could be awesome me in a cough.

348
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:39,280
Rym: That could be awesome.

349
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,039
Rym: However, this band not so much.

350
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:46,212
Scott: Imagine if like the second season of utensil was the coffin saga.

351
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:53,320
Rym: it pretty much was I know but I'm saying If they called it that you know what I wouldn't be surprised.

352
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,319
Rym: There are people who do because half of it is certain people talking to each other.

353
00:25:57,601 --> 00:25:59,700
Rym: Well coffins are being wheeled away in the background.

354
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:09,496
Rym: In fact, the the stock footage that they play during the elevator thing before the duel I know but wouldn't it be so much tackier than the black rose saga, which it is named.

355
00:26:10,018 --> 00:26:10,620
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

356
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,181
Scott: It's tacky.

357
00:26:11,242 --> 00:26:12,725
Scott: The name is tacky itself.

358
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:14,811
Rym: Yeah, but then there's cars.

359
00:26:15,192 --> 00:26:15,413
Rym: Yeah.

360
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:16,235
Scott: All right.

361
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:18,180
Scott: Anyway, I got a thing of the day, too.

362
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:19,285
Rym: Oh, do you?

363
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:23,206
Scott: yes, I don't know if I used it as a thing of the day even though I'm pretty sure I did.

364
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:27,787
Scott: there was a video of a Little midget kid in India.

365
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:28,930
Rym: Yeah, you say midget.

366
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:32,120
Rym: now Scott was like, oh Rym you remember this and I'm like.

367
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,600
Rym: I don't remember any video of an Indian guy dancing and Scott's like, yeah, I said it was a kid.

368
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:39,227
Rym: Yes, like he's this Indian kid dancing.

369
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:45,394
Rym: no, it's an Indian midget who happened to be a child at the time dancing Back when then you didn't know he was a midget.

370
00:26:45,414 --> 00:26:46,300
Scott: yet cuz he was still a kid.

371
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:47,905
Rym: No, we knew he was a midget.

372
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:48,829
Scott: We knew.

373
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:50,173
Scott: I thought he was just a small kid.

374
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:50,836
Scott: Wow.

375
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:51,538
Scott: Really?

376
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:53,860
Rym: Yeah No, it was obviously a midget.

377
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,378
Scott: Anyway, it's a midget kid and is a video of him dancing and it was all over the internet cuz he danced.

378
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,719
Scott: really well For a little midget kid, you know what that's like.

379
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:12,279
Rym: It's like if say one of our friends was killed by an apple a long time ago And instead of saying hey remember when so-and-so was killed by that Apple you said hey remember that Apple.

380
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:15,054
Rym: Anyway, okay.

381
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:23,477
Scott: Anyway someone as You know using the power of the internet, I guess Discovered what happened to this midget kid?

382
00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:33,065
Scott: Ooh He's now a midget choreographer in Bollywood and there's a video of him Teaching someone this dance.

383
00:27:33,105 --> 00:27:37,565
Scott: to do that They're gonna do in like a movie or a TV show or a commercial or whatever.

384
00:27:37,585 --> 00:27:38,850
Rym: They're doing well good on him.

385
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,469
Rym: I'm glad he made something of himself.

386
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:40,930
Rym: Yeah

387
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:55,770
Scott: I think it's pretty cool that you can go on the internet and see a video like oh my god There used to be this midget kid who danced really awesomely in India And now you can see that that midget kid is a midget choreographer in India and the world is one.

388
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:58,543
Rym: That is in fact the power of the internet.

389
00:27:59,488 --> 00:28:01,600
Scott: I You know, it also does awesome dancing.

390
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:03,148
Scott: I always loved watching people dance.

391
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:03,781
Scott: Yeah Yeah

392
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:16,409
Rym: If only I could get a hold of all the news like that whenever I wanted if only I had some sort of overlay Where I could see someone and like put a bookmark on him and then two years later Just hit the button and see what they've done.

393
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:24,273
Scott: Yeah I know if I was in some sort of lame story where there was a genie and I couldn't wish for all the really cool Smart wishes

394
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:27,985
Rym: you mean like more wishes and all the powers of a genie without any of the constraints

395
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:30,312
Scott: or being a wizard or anything Like that.

396
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:35,310
Scott: if I couldn't do any cool wishes and I had to do a lame wish I would definitely wish for dancing skills.

397
00:28:36,691 --> 00:28:41,746
Rym: You know those can be had with practice books and cool people telling you how to dance.

398
00:28:42,007 --> 00:28:42,709
Scott: I don't have the right DNA.

399
00:28:45,412 --> 00:28:47,023
Rym: See that's why we go to anime cons.

400
00:28:47,104 --> 00:28:47,889
Rym: is there we can be cool?

401
00:28:48,171 --> 00:28:49,981
Scott: I do not and I have some rhythms.

402
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,630
Scott: I have more rhythms than most people.

403
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,920
Scott: I mean I can play DDR and I don't mess up.

404
00:28:54,242 --> 00:28:55,989
Scott: see what I do not have enough rhythms to.

405
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:57,815
Scott: You know achieve the net.

406
00:28:57,835 --> 00:29:12,270
Rym: what I've learned in my years of dancing both at real clubs and at concerts and at anime cons of varying levels of nerdliness is that Unless you are somehow broken you can put forth a minimal dancing effort.

407
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,277
Rym: That is well above being ridiculed.

408
00:29:14,658 --> 00:29:16,786
Scott: You can definitely get above the ridicule level.

409
00:29:16,826 --> 00:29:18,090
Scott: I believe I'm above the ridicule.

410
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:18,872
Rym: Oh, yes, we both.

411
00:29:18,953 --> 00:29:26,325
Scott: in fact, however, I am NOT at the level of I could get a job Dancing for a DJ come.

412
00:29:26,386 --> 00:29:31,910
Scott: no, no I could make a video on YouTube of me dancing and people would think it was cool or I don't know.

413
00:29:33,695 --> 00:29:35,700
Scott: Numa that's not the same thing.

414
00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:39,290
Scott: I want you got to have people respect for the dancing and not for your fatness.

415
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,975
Rym: I know I am at least at the level.

416
00:29:41,055 --> 00:29:50,130
Rym: I'm not at the level where at any reasonable dance or dancing item I could actually be in the center of one of those circles and having people actually care.

417
00:29:50,251 --> 00:29:52,382
Scott: I don't want to get like be the center of attention.

418
00:29:52,402 --> 00:29:53,870
Scott: That's that's above my goal.

419
00:29:53,910 --> 00:30:04,109
Scott: my goal is to just you know, my dancing should get some level of Positive attention because it is pleasant to look upon me while I dance.

420
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:13,399
Scott: My face brings some pleasure to people to look upon it as opposed to just yeah, looky mighty Yes My favorite thing all I want out of dances.

421
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:16,070
Rym: if I'm dancing and someone else is dancing we make eye contact.

422
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:21,250
Rym: If they give me that nod of I approve of the fact that you exist in her dancing and I return that nod.

423
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:21,963
Rym: That's all I want.

424
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:23,575
Rym: That nod of.

425
00:30:23,616 --> 00:30:25,183
Rym: huh, we're dancing ain't it great.

426
00:30:25,564 --> 00:30:26,790
Scott: Yeah, I think that's the level I'm at now.

427
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,575
Scott: I want one step more course.

428
00:30:28,615 --> 00:30:33,810
Scott: I remember mind being the ultimate breakdancing God or anything, but I'm just you can't beat that kid.

429
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:35,056
Scott: No can't beat that kid.

430
00:30:35,257 --> 00:30:38,816
Rym: All right, but I do remember at a katsu kana while ago I was dancing with a friend of mine.

431
00:30:39,218 --> 00:30:39,861
Rym: You know hanging out.

432
00:30:39,901 --> 00:30:41,550
Rym: There's a bunch of funny starters about that.

433
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:48,719
Rym: We will tell him at katsu kana maybe but you know where he's dancing really well, and I'm thinking to myself wow He must actually know how to dance.

434
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,316
Rym: someone must have taught him god damn Halfway through 80s night.

435
00:30:53,336 --> 00:30:56,428
Rym: He leans over and says hey Rym am I dancing?

436
00:30:56,509 --> 00:30:56,890
Rym: Okay?

437
00:30:57,473 --> 00:31:01,114
Rym: I don't know if I know how to dance and I think I look stupid And I'm just like dude.

438
00:31:01,174 --> 00:31:01,516
Scott: that is.

439
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:06,675
Scott: the problem is that many people have the natural rhythm, but no one ever tells you Hey, you're dancing.

440
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:15,310
Scott: Well or anything like that, especially not Guys, if you're a guy well unless you're gay or something or you're just you know, not homophobic like us.

441
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:19,270
Scott: Well, I mean you'd have to ask like I wouldn't just say hey Rym you're dancing real.

442
00:31:20,232 --> 00:31:22,222
Scott: Because then Rym would say you know how I know you're gay.

443
00:31:22,242 --> 00:31:24,413
Rym: Yeah, I would but however You know how.

444
00:31:24,453 --> 00:31:26,564
Rym: I know you're gay is not an accusation of gayness.

445
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:27,870
Rym: It is merely an acknowledgement.

446
00:31:28,452 --> 00:31:31,520
Scott: I know, but I would still seek to avoid receiving that.

447
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,382
Scott: you know what I'm saying.

448
00:31:32,402 --> 00:31:37,138
Rym: I know you like to avoid receiving, but Exactly all right.

449
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,310
Scott: What are we talking about today in our main bits?

450
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:47,460
Scott: professionalism Professionally Professionalism professionalism as opposed to amateurism.

451
00:31:47,962 --> 00:31:50,935
Rym: well no you see we actually way back We did a show on.

452
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:54,290
Rym: either either we did a show or we said we were gonna do a show.

453
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:55,239
Scott: We don't remember.

454
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:56,390
Scott: That's how many shows we've done.

455
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,434
Scott: We don't remember.

456
00:31:57,454 --> 00:32:00,183
Scott: I have to tell us cuz we have no clue.

457
00:32:00,223 --> 00:32:02,352
Rym: God return independent to go good though They're like.

458
00:32:02,373 --> 00:32:03,160
Rym: did we talk about that?

459
00:32:03,241 --> 00:32:03,927
Rym: I don't know whatever.

460
00:32:03,947 --> 00:32:04,230
Rym: let's talk.

461
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:09,024
Scott: Yes, you've done three shows on why you should be allowed to smoke weed, but you won't.

462
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,709
Scott: it's do something else guys.

463
00:32:12,676 --> 00:32:15,635
Rym: But anyway we I'm just gonna assume we did one.

464
00:32:15,656 --> 00:32:19,673
Rym: we did a show on how to do a good panel at an anime con or any kind Of con.

465
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:20,438
Rym: did we?

466
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:22,109
Rym: or we said we were gonna do it?

467
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:23,294
Scott: I don't remember.

468
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:31,300
Rym: regardless during the planning of that we decided that the idea of professionalism is Worthy of a separate show in and of itself beyond that.

469
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:32,404
Rym: so here.

470
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:34,210
Rym: We are talking about professionalism.

471
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:43,130
Scott: Well, I think the reason that the professionalism is kind of important Is that it's sort of the foundation of most of our how to not suck shows.

472
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:49,229
Scott: It's like if you follow if you don't suck at being professional, then you will not suck at many other things.

473
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:49,510
Rym: yep.

474
00:32:49,610 --> 00:33:05,244
Rym: So before we continue as Scott was alluding to we really have to take care of the fact that we're not talking about this other totally different dichotomy of amateur versus professional which basically comes down to Paid to do it versus doing it for free or something along those lines.

475
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:07,169
Rym: that seems to be the demarcation most people make.

476
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,822
Scott: yeah We're not talking about official professionalism.

477
00:33:09,882 --> 00:33:15,730
Scott: We're not talking about the difference between NFL and NCAA where one's a pro sport in one's college sports.

478
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:22,130
Scott: We're not talking about the difference between how the Olympics only used to allow amateur athletes, and now it allows professional.

479
00:33:22,231 --> 00:33:30,024
Rym: Yeah, in fact if you want it if you want to get where we're using the word professionalism We are am an amateur podcast that is done professionally.

480
00:33:30,304 --> 00:33:30,706
Scott: That's right.

481
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:32,030
Rym: We are professional amateur.

482
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,485
Scott: We're using the other definition of professional.

483
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:39,650
Rym: now I guess we start this with the story because I remember way back RIT anime club.

484
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,540
Rym: You know we were I was just I was on the eboard.

485
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,968
Rym: I had just gotten in by Fiat.

486
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:45,670
Rym: I wasn't elected.

487
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,490
Rym: I was one of those like those presidents who never actually got elected.

488
00:33:48,891 --> 00:34:00,903
Rym: They just got appointed and then they were good enough that no one ever bothered to run against him since then because I never ran in my first two elections, but anyway I get on this board and you know we have some conflict with this other club.

489
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:01,727
Rym: that's causing trouble.

490
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:06,944
Rym: and We make the argument that well, they're just not being professional about this.

491
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:14,261
Rym: it had to do with a certain convention Mm-hmm, and you know we say to the you know the head of clubs Who's mediating this dispute that work?

492
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,050
Rym: They're not handling themselves in a professional manner?

493
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,953
Rym: We can't work with them.

494
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:20,344
Rym: and his response was this is a club in a school.

495
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:22,330
Rym: You shouldn't be professional about it.

496
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,255
Rym: There's no reason to be professional about it.

497
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:26,702
Rym: and that statement bothered me a lot.

498
00:34:26,862 --> 00:34:29,810
Scott: that would bother me as well a great deal.

499
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:39,554
Rym: You see all professionalism means without getting into specifics is handling yourself in a generally intelligent receptive Responsible manner respectful.

500
00:34:39,935 --> 00:34:41,038
Rym: Yes, that's it.

501
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:41,379
Rym: That's it.

502
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,902
Rym: respectable and respectful.

503
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:45,290
Rym: It goes both ways mostly the respectable.

504
00:34:46,492 --> 00:34:50,929
Rym: So to use you know the anime examples since we always tend to fall back on anime.

505
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,043
Rym: It seems to be one of our primary geekeries now.

506
00:34:53,063 --> 00:34:54,029
Rym: We devote a whole night to it.

507
00:34:55,150 --> 00:35:05,370
Rym: Panels at cons a Professional panel or a panel that is run in a professional manner is a good panel I'd say our panel, but I'll go with the OC remixes panel as an example.

508
00:35:05,732 --> 00:35:08,085
Scott: No, they were very professional with their panel now.

509
00:35:08,326 --> 00:35:08,930
Rym: What does that mean?

510
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,041
Rym: They came in they had a plan.

511
00:35:11,262 --> 00:35:12,550
Rym: they had all their stuff ready to go.

512
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,920
Rym: They knew what they were gonna talk about that all their props ready.

513
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:17,210
Rym: everyone involved in the panel knew their role.

514
00:35:17,874 --> 00:35:20,610
Rym: They started on time or as on time as you could start.

515
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:24,870
Rym: They finished on time and they put together a well-run presentation.

516
00:35:25,592 --> 00:35:28,603
Rym: They handled all eventualities in a professional manner.

517
00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:32,417
Scott: yeah while they are not professionals They are not an actual you know.

518
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:36,295
Scott: whereas say the ATV panel those people are professionals.

519
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:41,436
Scott: you know they do things in a professional way because They have their company.

520
00:35:41,536 --> 00:35:42,800
Scott: think that's the way they do things.

521
00:35:43,281 --> 00:35:53,170
Scott: if you do things in that way whether you're actually Quote professionals or not you know in the paid fashion you are doing things in a good way.

522
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:56,149
Scott: There's a reason that professionals do things that way.

523
00:35:56,731 --> 00:36:02,050
Scott: It's not because you know well all of a sudden when there's money and companies involved you have to do things a certain way.

524
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:04,026
Scott: But really you shouldn't do it that way.

525
00:36:04,348 --> 00:36:05,780
Scott: you know That's just the way you have to do it.

526
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,250
Scott: if you're being paid money now That's the way you're supposed to do things and doing it the other way is because you suck.

527
00:36:11,872 --> 00:36:15,224
Rym: So let's take an example from what was a really bad panel at Otakon.

528
00:36:15,244 --> 00:36:16,790
Rym: there was that old-school anime panel.

529
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:18,558
Scott: I did did I go to that one.

530
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,030
Rym: Yeah, we went to it, and we bitched about it, and then we left.

531
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,581
Scott: That was in a transfer.

532
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:28,379
Scott: Oh wasn't that Transformers panel Was panel before the old?

533
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:29,763
Scott: I don't even remember whatever.

534
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:30,305
Scott: you know.

535
00:36:30,325 --> 00:36:31,629
Scott: it was the one with space ghost.

536
00:36:31,669 --> 00:36:33,437
Rym: yes Yes, the crap panel now.

537
00:36:33,497 --> 00:36:35,225
Rym: This was a panel with four dudes.

538
00:36:35,586 --> 00:36:36,490
Rym: Maybe there's a girl there.

539
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:39,398
Rym: But these people didn't have a plan.

540
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:41,806
Rym: they didn't have any sort of preparation.

541
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:51,186
Rym: they started late They went long they floundered they obviously had not actually thought this through at all and as a result They put together a piss-poor presentation.

542
00:36:51,529 --> 00:36:52,460
Scott: yet They came up there.

543
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,670
Scott: all right this guy You know did his space ghost joke for like a few minutes and everyone I was just rolling my eyes.

544
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:00,863
Scott: And then they sat up there, and they were like hey guys.

545
00:37:00,924 --> 00:37:05,390
Scott: Yeah, we're supposed to do What old-school anime panel or something yeah?

546
00:37:06,233 --> 00:37:08,169
Scott: We're just four guys up here saying stuff.

547
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:11,138
Scott: we put together this short video.

548
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:12,684
Scott: that was the only preparation we did.

549
00:37:12,724 --> 00:37:13,266
Scott: let's watch it.

550
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:20,577
Scott: and If people scream when they see their favorite anime on this on the you know the video as is done at anime conventions Yeah, or any.

551
00:37:20,698 --> 00:37:30,773
Scott: and then when it was over You know they just let people in the crowd yell out questions, and then they just kind of answered him in their haphazard Dorky way.

552
00:37:30,893 --> 00:37:33,965
Scott: and then when their time was eventually up they were shoved out.

553
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:34,547
Scott: and that was it.

554
00:37:35,189 --> 00:37:44,111
Rym: yep I mean professionalism like we said it just comes down to not being dumb and planning ahead and Trying.

555
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:47,381
Scott: yeah, you don't try you will suck.

556
00:37:47,883 --> 00:37:55,510
Rym: now the scary thing is I you know I've worked for IBM, and I've worked for the company I work for now, and I work for mostly very large companies.

557
00:37:56,252 --> 00:38:05,865
Rym: And you'd think you know corporate America big business the big iron the real deal that everyone in an Organization like that who is an actual you know really like.

558
00:38:05,905 --> 00:38:11,663
Rym: not like the janitors and all that But the actual like the meat and potatoes and the managers and the executives.

559
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:18,630
Rym: managers the executives the technologists the Researchers the scientists all the people who do the things that make that company work.

560
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:23,509
Rym: you'd think you'd assume that they would all conduct themselves in a professional manner.

561
00:38:23,529 --> 00:38:36,045
Rym: and I have found in my years of working for various corporations and being in corporate America that by and large Very few people have the sheer ability to put forth even the facade of professionalism.

562
00:38:36,386 --> 00:38:37,690
Scott: Yeah something that always bothers me.

563
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:42,130
Scott: I think it really stands out in corporate like in the company email.

564
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:54,882
Scott: Yeah, I mean the company always send an email to anyone in my company right whether it's you know like the closest co-worker I just have to tell them you know hi How you doing, or what's the status of something even if it's real short?

565
00:38:55,423 --> 00:38:57,590
Scott: I write you know dear so-and-so.

566
00:38:58,053 --> 00:39:06,130
Scott: Yeah, thanks me You know I write it like it's a letter and I write check it for spelling and I put more than there.

567
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,420
Scott: I don't just shoot off a quick email in ten seconds.

568
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:10,410
Scott: I just can't bring myself to do that.

569
00:39:10,711 --> 00:39:11,615
Scott: I have to check it.

570
00:39:11,635 --> 00:39:12,881
Scott: the grammar has to be right.

571
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:19,449
Scott: I have to write out the entire words I have to put a little heading and a signature and the salutation and everything.

572
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:21,448
Scott: yep That's the way it has to be done.

573
00:39:21,891 --> 00:39:22,233
Rym: Yep, now.

574
00:39:22,253 --> 00:39:26,470
Rym: I mean depending if I'm I mean I can send a quick email in my private life to Scott.

575
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,799
Scott: Yeah, there's no problem with that now.

576
00:39:29,221 --> 00:39:35,555
Rym: and I but like GeekNights stuff, too If I respond to any email especially in a corporation I do the same thing as Scott.

577
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:43,585
Rym: you know my email is basically as far as I'm concerned a corporate memo Fully exemplifying everything that I am as a professional.

578
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:53,324
Rym: it reflects on me Just like I wouldn't wear a pair of black sweatpants and a stained Coffee shirt to a job interview or to a meeting with a client.

579
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:58,256
Rym: I'm not gonna put that persona In my corporate communications.

580
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,685
Scott: It's like if someone sent me an email like okay.

581
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:01,926
Scott: Thanks.

582
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:02,347
Scott: Bye.

583
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,078
Scott: Oh my god Right you did that work for me.

584
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:07,370
Scott: I would say I would not respect that person.

585
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,857
Scott: I think wow that person is a doofus.

586
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:11,108
Rym: that person obviously is not a professional.

587
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:15,949
Scott: yes So I wouldn't want anyone else to think of me in that way that I'm thinking.

588
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:30,509
Scott: you know I not in a corporate environment most of the time I don't give a shit what people think about me But when I want something from someone or if it's a person at a company And I'm dealing with them in a professional manner And I need to get an upper hand in some dealings.

589
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:41,489
Scott: Then I need to make them think that I'm professional and to look upon me You know to look up at me instead of down and therefore it is beneficial to write things in professional manner.

590
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:45,400
Rym: in fact That seems to be pretty much the most overall important thing of being professional.

591
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,250
Rym: a professionalism really just entails not taking things personally.

592
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,276
Rym: It's like you have your personal self.

593
00:40:51,336 --> 00:40:51,837
Rym: You're you.

594
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:56,190
Scott: you're the real you and the real me is like whatever dude fuck you.

595
00:40:56,452 --> 00:40:59,155
Rym: Yeah, but when you're being professional It's like a court etiquette.

596
00:40:59,175 --> 00:41:05,510
Rym: when you're in front of the king or whatever you're doing you put forth not so much a lie It's not like a fake mask.

597
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:09,030
Rym: It's just I am putting forth this persona.

598
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:14,730
Rym: That is my professional persona because I am trying to conduct business with you in the most efficient manner possible.

599
00:41:15,112 --> 00:41:18,430
Rym: I want you to think highly of me, and I hope that I will think highly of you.

600
00:41:18,912 --> 00:41:24,215
Rym: I'm putting forth the effort that I would expect you to put forth on whatever work You're doing for me and vice-versa.

601
00:41:24,255 --> 00:41:34,890
Scott: Yeah, what I'm acting professional obviously that's not my true inner self But I don't really think of it as lying because I do think that some forms of pretending to be someone else are lying.

602
00:41:35,402 --> 00:41:40,481
Scott: but When you're acting professional you're not going up to someone and saying haha.

603
00:41:40,622 --> 00:41:42,066
Scott: I'm not actually a doofus.

604
00:41:42,246 --> 00:41:43,430
Scott: I'm a professional guy.

605
00:41:44,054 --> 00:41:44,961
Scott: That's not what you're doing.

606
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:47,315
Scott: what you're saying is look I might.

607
00:41:47,415 --> 00:42:02,844
Scott: you know my true attitude might be completely different from what you're seeing now But I have the ability and the intelligence to act in a manner that is presentable and respectful and therefore I am worthy of respect no matter what my true opinions and ideals and attitude are.

608
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:06,458
Rym: see you can conduct yourself in a professional Manner and still totally suck.

609
00:42:07,001 --> 00:42:08,810
Rym: that is nothing to do with it, but true.

610
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:13,510
Rym: But if someone is unable now unwilling is another thing.

611
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:29,308
Rym: But if someone is unable to put forth that persona if someone is unable to check I mean if you misplace a preposition in an email that even a professional email That's not the biggest deal, but if you forget to capitalize the letter I multiple times in order

612
00:42:29,348 --> 00:42:31,050
Scott: to say What's what's your favorite?

613
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:34,364
Scott: Please advice please advice with an s?

614
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:37,758
Rym: ah or even please advise But they use it in the entirely wrong.

615
00:42:37,798 --> 00:42:39,003
Rym: what just anything like that?

616
00:42:39,445 --> 00:42:48,850
Rym: obviously it shows that While you are dealing with me in a professional manner you are not willing to put forth the trivial effort required to be professional about it.

617
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,116
Rym: Now if you're not willing to do that.

618
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,508
Rym: What else are you not willing to do for me?

619
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,310
Rym: Where what else are you going to fuck up?

620
00:42:57,332 --> 00:42:59,704
Scott: It's a. it's a wonder like so many people like.

621
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:04,117
Scott: they want things and They don't get them and they wonder why.

622
00:43:04,137 --> 00:43:10,676
Scott: and the answer a lot of times is you didn't you're not professional You're not acting like a professional.

623
00:43:11,057 --> 00:43:11,940
Scott: You know it's sort of like.

624
00:43:12,362 --> 00:43:18,650
Scott: you know is the old saying like if you act like You know you're worth a million bucks, then eventually you'll have a million bucks.

625
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:21,600
Scott: Yeah, that's not so true, but there's something to it.

626
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,563
Scott: You know if you go up.

627
00:43:22,985 --> 00:43:28,086
Scott: You know to say a Rock star or someone you want them to give you an autograph.

628
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:34,147
Scott: if you just go You're just a raving fan, and they don't care, but if you go up and they go hi.

629
00:43:34,248 --> 00:43:34,790
Scott: How are you doing?

630
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:44,707
Scott: My name is blah blah blah such-and-such you know and you act professional you can get their attention and get shit You want because you don't you stick out, and you're not a doofus.

631
00:43:44,727 --> 00:43:47,940
Scott: You're obviously Somewhat intelligent because you can do that.

632
00:43:48,221 --> 00:43:50,450
Rym: yeah, I mean we get into most cons.

633
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:52,450
Rym: We go to now free and we do all this stuff.

634
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:56,710
Rym: I mean I remember there's another podcast that I'm not going to mention because I don't like this podcast.

635
00:43:56,991 --> 00:44:07,221
Rym: But they were complaining last year that basically yeah, Otakon didn't give us a panel, but meanwhile us GeekNights We got a panel like that like hey Podcasting panel.

636
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:13,563
Rym: they said go nuts Yep, and it really comes down to the only reason we get all these things.

637
00:44:13,623 --> 00:44:20,407
Rym: aside from our vastly superior skill talent Intellect charisma and the fact that we are gods among men.

638
00:44:20,448 --> 00:44:26,410
Scott: yeah walking up We can't demonstrate any of those amazing things to the people that we want to give us a panel.

639
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:30,271
Scott: They don't know that we're geniuses, and we can't convince them Right.

640
00:44:30,812 --> 00:44:38,721
Scott: the only way for us to get a pet them to give us a panel is By acting like pros and pretending to be pros.

641
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,370
Rym: I mean working staff and stuff for various kinds.

642
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:49,178
Rym: I've seen the kind of proposals that Cons get for panels and they usually along the lines of One giant paragraph.

643
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,122
Rym: Oh my god.

644
00:44:50,363 --> 00:44:56,204
Rym: I want to run a panel about Blah blah and it'll be awesome, and I need some people to help me with it.

645
00:44:56,706 --> 00:44:58,070
Rym: and and and crap.

646
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:03,510
Rym: There's just this crap like barely legible barely understandable raving of a fan.

647
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,680
Scott: They put less effort into it than they put into like an instant message.

648
00:45:07,322 --> 00:45:34,974
Rym: and yet when we send a proposal like I sent our Proposals this year for what we want to do at Otakon to the panels coordinator I wrote a three-page document describing in exact detail The panels were willing to do and all that they will entail The other things we'd be willing to do if they asked that we could provide more detail upon Everything we need everything we would provide and then an entire resume of all the things we've done in the past all the things we Plan to do the things we're doing this year.

649
00:45:34,994 --> 00:45:39,986
Rym: I sent links to recordings of panels that are similar that we've done in the past.

650
00:45:40,788 --> 00:45:45,721
Rym: Oh Yeah, and when it I guess that's what real I mean everything we do.

651
00:45:45,741 --> 00:45:50,775
Rym: it sounds silly but everything we do if it's worth doing It's worth doing professionally.

652
00:45:51,156 --> 00:45:56,695
Rym: if we write if we decide that we're going to go to Greece We're actually thinking about going to Greece.

653
00:45:57,137 --> 00:45:58,401
Rym: You know how everyone knows we're gay.

654
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:01,954
Rym: Yeah sometime like maybe in the fall We're not sure when.

655
00:46:01,974 --> 00:46:11,047
Rym: we're just kind of a long-term plan to go on a big vacation to the whole Greco-Roman area Mm-hmm, and you would not believe the absolute level of planning that we're going to put into this.

656
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:17,250
Rym: if we actually do it Yeah, we put that same level of planning into what we're going to eat for dinner or when we're going to go to the mall.

657
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:18,172
Scott: Yep.

658
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:19,981
Rym: Now we might not plan it ahead.

659
00:46:20,021 --> 00:46:21,790
Rym: We might plan things at the spur of the moment.

660
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:27,473
Rym: I mean, it's not like we regiment our lives out say we're at a con and we decide hey, we're gonna do blah We just do it.

661
00:46:27,874 --> 00:46:31,606
Rym: But while we're doing it the whole time, we're planning we're planning ahead.

662
00:46:31,646 --> 00:46:32,970
Rym: We're coming up with contingency plans.

663
00:46:33,313 --> 00:46:34,909
Rym: We're handling it in a professional manner.

664
00:46:35,473 --> 00:46:41,161
Rym: So I guess if you want to get the things you want in the world Whenever you think something's worth getting.

665
00:46:41,222 --> 00:46:55,898
Rym: if you actually want something Try to approach it in a professional manner meaning in all of your communications Be careful about what you say, you know, actually look at what you wrote for more than a second spell check it Make sure it's got at least decent grammar.

666
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:57,663
Rym: Make sure it gets the point across.

667
00:46:58,225 --> 00:47:10,860
Scott: when you talk to people, you know Present yourself stand up straight walk up to them, you know, shake their hand, you know say things like hi I'm so-and-so and then you know, give them a professional pitch.

668
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,318
Scott: don't use words like like like, you know like like man I'm totally gonna do this shit for you.

669
00:47:16,338 --> 00:47:17,203
Rym: I got it.

670
00:47:17,384 --> 00:47:18,570
Rym: shit man shit.

671
00:47:19,612 --> 00:47:22,106
Scott: Yeah, I was wondering if I could do this panel for you.

672
00:47:22,146 --> 00:47:25,759
Scott: I have X You know credentials such-and-such.

673
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,864
Scott: Here's my business card.

674
00:47:26,924 --> 00:47:32,502
Rym: if someone sends you communication Actually read it and respond in kind with the information.

675
00:47:32,522 --> 00:47:33,665
Rym: They actually asked for.

676
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:37,830
Rym: you know, how often promptly See, this is the worst thing in all my jobs.

677
00:47:38,271 --> 00:47:47,790
Rym: it seems like most people in the corporate where I get these garbage emails from people and they don't even ask me for anything and Then a month later, they're like, hey do that thing and I'm like what thing?

678
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:51,710
Rym: Oh the thing I asked you to do and I say well when did you ask me to do that?

679
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:58,330
Rym: Oh in this email and I quote the email back at him usually copying their manager where in this email Did you ask me for anything?

680
00:48:00,471 --> 00:48:15,529
Rym: And the saddest thing is that I got a manager who's actually really smart in my current company and I usually copy him on stuff And he actually sent me a reply back kind of BCC saying that was a really good memo And I didn't know what to say to that.

681
00:48:16,052 --> 00:48:16,815
Rym: I mean at one point.

682
00:48:16,835 --> 00:48:18,302
Scott: it was like a really good memo.

683
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:20,150
Scott: every memo should be like that.

684
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:23,744
Scott: And if I was a boss of a company and every memo what?

685
00:48:23,764 --> 00:48:25,310
Scott: if you said one unprofessional memo?

686
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:28,260
Scott: You would be out the door on your ass so fast.

687
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:31,070
Rym: Well first I'd sit you down and ask so what why did you send?

688
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:35,625
Scott: Oh, yeah, I'd make sure to humiliate you before I put you out on the curb.

689
00:48:35,886 --> 00:48:37,010
Rym: I did that once at IBM.

690
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:40,623
Rym: I just I was dealing with this guy, and he was a total.

691
00:48:41,105 --> 00:48:46,969
Rym: the guy wasn't the brightest guy And he was in this other department and everyone in my department knew that he was not the best guy.

692
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:50,370
Rym: Eventually he sends me this terrible long correspondence.

693
00:48:50,491 --> 00:49:10,690
Rym: It looked like a fifth grader wrote it so I responded you know with the exact same request for information that I had made I don't know 10 or 11 times in the past and you know I copied in the email all the times I had asked and all the answers he'd given that didn't answer it and Furthermore I corrected all of the spelling or grammar in his emails to me in my reply.

694
00:49:11,371 --> 00:49:13,764
Rym: Yeah, I left IBM not too long after that.

695
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:15,878
Rym: I never really found I don't think he even noticed.

696
00:49:15,899 --> 00:49:16,704
Rym: to be perfectly honest.

697
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:23,596
Scott: no I think there's another component to acting professionally that we haven't touched on and that is Confidence.

698
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,690
Scott: like I went to a job interview.

699
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,322
Scott: You know I quit my job today, and I have a new job already.

700
00:49:28,784 --> 00:49:36,230
Scott: when I went to the job interview You know back in the day when I went to job interviews I was you know just like a nervous kid whatever like oh god am I gonna get hired?

701
00:49:36,871 --> 00:49:47,079
Scott: Went to this job interview, and I conducted myself in a professional manager manner Mr.. Manager yes with no nervousness at all.

702
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,527
Scott: I was just you know hey hello.

703
00:49:49,848 --> 00:49:50,350
Scott: How are you?

704
00:49:50,911 --> 00:49:53,414
Scott: Yes, that would be terrific Etc etc.

705
00:49:53,995 --> 00:49:57,346
Scott: and I got the job without any like that day.

706
00:49:57,386 --> 00:50:00,153
Scott: They're like yes, you have the job and It's why?

707
00:50:00,193 --> 00:50:03,566
Scott: because I was incredibly confident, and I was just like yeah, you're gonna hire me.

708
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:05,835
Scott: That's right That's what you're gonna.

709
00:50:05,855 --> 00:50:08,768
Scott: Do because I mean look how smooth I am that's right.

710
00:50:09,351 --> 00:50:21,208
Scott: I mean you know if you don't have that frame of mind then even if you try to act professionally You're gonna be kind of slow and off the mark and it'll come off as like What's wrong with this guy?

711
00:50:22,011 --> 00:50:23,498
Scott: It has to be so natural.

712
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,828
Scott: It's really you know there's something to it.

713
00:50:26,452 --> 00:50:32,969
Rym: Yep, I mean if you don't have the confidence in yourself to do something Why would you ever expect other people to have confidence in you to do that thing?

714
00:50:36,253 --> 00:50:38,430
Rym: And on that note I guess we're done.

715
00:50:38,991 --> 00:50:46,438
Rym: Stay tuned next week when we'll have a short week as we're going to Katsucon to in a professional manner help run the video game room.

716
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:54,126
Rym: oh one last thing professionalism Honesty yeah, I mean if someone that's probably the biggest thing.

717
00:50:54,146 --> 00:51:02,550
Rym: if you make a mistake At a job like say you mess something up Most people kind of try to hide it or try to pass off the blame.

718
00:51:03,112 --> 00:51:04,416
Rym: You've got to just be upfront.

719
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:11,703
Rym: be like as soon as you realize you made a mistake you send the memo out to whoever Cares saying the following mistake was made by me.

720
00:51:11,723 --> 00:51:13,650
Rym: Here's what I will do to rectify it.

721
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:18,649
Scott: Is there anyone that we can think of like a public figure who is just ridiculously professional ah?

722
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,510
