00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,448
Rym: It's Thursday September 20th.

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,311
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:15,784
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights Tonight.

4
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:24,362
Rym: how to not suck at going to college part 1.

5
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:25,378
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:30,225
Rym: Well today was awesome.

7
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:35,550
Rym: I go to get on the train and it turns out my train was canceled due to mechanical difficulties.

8
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:39,864
Scott: My train was also canceled for mechanical difficulties was Emily's.

9
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:41,690
Scott: it was the same train the same train.

10
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:47,270
Scott: So I just went home played like a round of tf2 then went back and took the next train.

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:47,732
Scott: I also.

12
00:00:47,772 --> 00:00:54,149
Scott: that was good for me because I forgot my iPod and I was able to go and retrieve it which is a big Help because I listened to a lot of stuff today.

13
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:58,970
Rym: My iPod is actually kind of useless on the way to work unless I Drive because I have the DVD player.

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,623
Rym: I'm just watching master Keaton, and I don't really need a podcast to listen to plus.

15
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:04,610
Rym: I listen to all my podcast.

16
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,765
Rym: I'm all caught up, and I can't find any new ones.

17
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:09,134
Scott: I like oh Okay, all right here.

18
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:09,596
Scott: We go you ready.

19
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,202
Scott: Here's an awesome podcast.

20
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:15,942
Scott: I just found uh-huh it's called Old-time radio sci-fi.

21
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:17,130
Rym: no you've told me about that.

22
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:24,734
Scott: Yeah basically the deal with this podcast is they have old sci-fi radio shows from back in the day and they just put them in a Podcast for you to get.

23
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:26,199
Scott: it's not perfect.

24
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:29,170
Scott: first of all it's done by those pod show people, and I don't like them.

25
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:53,553
Scott: They're no good, and I think what they're really just doing is taking all this old Material either from an archive or from the public domain I'm not sure if it's public domain or not and they're just sticking it up in a feed And they're not doing it very well because like for example one of the things I found in this feed that I really liked was like a radio drama of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth and Up there.

26
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:59,761
Scott: first they put up part one there's eight parts then they put up part two Then they put a part six and then they put a part seven interspersed.

27
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:07,955
Scott: as I'm not willing to put up with crap like that I listened to one and two and they were awesome, so I'm just holding off Until the rest is coming out.

28
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:14,750
Scott: actually I listened to seven by accident first because it was at the top of the feed And I just kind of got it, and it wasn't labeled properly.

29
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:20,450
Scott: But the stuff is actually really good And I like it a lot like I like it a lot more than I thought I was gonna like it.

30
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:22,350
Rym: Well, I used to listen to a lot of old radio dramas.

31
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:30,647
Rym: There's a radio station that actually had him on my drive home from work when I lived in the mountains from IBM And I listened to some radio dramas, but you know what.

32
00:02:30,788 --> 00:02:35,590
Rym: they were Contiguous and every episode was directly followed by the next episode.

33
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:38,700
Scott: Yeah, that would be nice, but yeah these are.

34
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:45,684
Scott: I thought you know I wasn't sure I would enjoy these and It's sort of like gives me the same feeling as like watching the Twilight Zone.

35
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:46,307
Scott: It's really cool.

36
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:47,833
Rym: Honestly I wish there would be.

37
00:02:47,913 --> 00:02:51,570
Rym: I mean there are fiction podcasts, and there are you know radio drama podcasts?

38
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,449
Rym: But there aren't that many and there aren't that many that are very good.

39
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,018
Scott: No, there aren't many that are very good.

40
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:58,464
Rym: I mean if anyone can recommend one.

41
00:02:58,484 --> 00:02:59,850
Rym: I'd be welcome to it.

42
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,405
Rym: I already know about escape pod and pseudopod and plus those just read stories.

43
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:06,240
Rym: It's not a radio drama It's just a reading of a story.

44
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,393
Scott: Yeah, that's why I say I don't it's.

45
00:03:08,453 --> 00:03:12,690
Scott: there's a big difference actually between like an audio book and a radio drama.

46
00:03:12,831 --> 00:03:20,250
Scott: It's totally different you know and if it's if it's an audio book I kind of don't like them that much because it's like there's a book and someone's reading it.

47
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,190
Scott: But if it's a radio drama the people are you know acting there?

48
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,690
Scott: It's it's like a play only you can't see anything.

49
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:29,321
Scott: It's a totally different thing and I like it a lot more.

50
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:33,730
Rym: though the thing is I've noticed in all the old radio dramas I've ever listened to the style of acting.

51
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,750
Rym: Maybe it's just because that was the style of acting back then because you hear it a lot in movies, too.

52
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:48,786
Rym: But the way people talk when they're expressing one emotion versus another is just like it's almost painfully Stereotypical yeah, like it really stands out.

53
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:50,012
Rym: It doesn't bother me It just it.

54
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,582
Rym: it really stands out, and I can't not notice it.

55
00:03:53,044 --> 00:04:01,147
Scott: another thing for me these Old-time radio sci-fi also, I tried to listen to old-time radio comedy, but it wasn't funny, but I did.

56
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:05,000
Scott: from both of these I managed to actually learn a lot about radio.

57
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,943
Scott: Just listening to it.

58
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:12,610
Scott: It's like ah such as What'd you learn nothing that is like you know like textbook knowledge?

59
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:34,955
Scott: But like just you know things I can hear like oh, I hear that that was clever, but like for example in the The Listens like a Jack Benny radio show right on the comedy one and the sponsor was Jell-o right and Jell-o had an announcement at the beginning of the show and they had an announcement after the show was over like you know by Jell-o, it's great for your family.

60
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:39,950
Scott: It tastes good blah blah blah right, but during the show the show was uninterrupted at all.

61
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:43,853
Scott: But they joked about Jell-o, and they made fun of the announcer and how y'all hit.

62
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:46,703
Scott: they're like ah that announcer always shut not talking about Jell-o.

63
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:47,426
Scott: He needs to shut up.

64
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:50,723
Scott: and It was really kind of clever advertising.

65
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:58,999
Scott: And I think you know like if they just took the ads off the beginning in the end and just you know did it that Way it's like you wouldn't even known there was an ad.

66
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,641
Scott: you just think that guy talks about Jell-o a lot And I don't think anyone would be fooled.

67
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:07,735
Scott: I don't know because they did it in a very Non fooling way.

68
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:17,650
Rym: no just the way our society especially people in our generation We're just so tuned to avoiding advertising that Anything that's in any way an ad just kind of stands out.

69
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:27,881
Scott: It wasn't intended to be but it was funny how back in the olden days of radio They tried to make the ad in obtrusive to the show and like the show was the focus And they were trying to think of this.

70
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:29,050
Rym: you went to advertising school.

71
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,706
Rym: They'd probably talk about how yeah, that was the old way before we discovered modern advertising techniques.

72
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:38,092
Scott: probably probably But you know it made me happier Right?

73
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:43,550
Rym: so this is all over the internet and people are expressing various levels of outrage, but apparently the Harvard bookstore

74
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,107
Scott: Supposedly like the one that like students go to to buy books

75
00:05:47,268 --> 00:05:47,911
Rym: yeah Yeah,

76
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:48,252
Scott: okay,

77
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:54,289
Rym: supposedly kicked someone out or some people out because they were writing down the prices of the books.

78
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,802
Rym: Uh-huh now the thing is they're perfectly within their rights to do that.

79
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:04,854
Rym: you can kick someone out of your store for any reason as Long as it's not a protected class such as Religion race.

80
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:08,343
Scott: well as long as you don't do it because they're a protected class.

81
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:19,590
Scott: for example if there is a you know a Black person an Asian person and a white person in my Hispanic person in my store I can't be like I'm kicking out the Asian you all Asians out.

82
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,327
Scott: You can't do that.

83
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:31,103
Scott: But if say a black person is you know being nice and a white person is harassing them because they're like a KKK guy I could be like all right I'm kicking you out of my store because you're making a scene I can't be like.

84
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:32,410
Scott: I'm kicking you out of my store because you're.

85
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:35,341
Rym: But people are saying oh the store can't do that.

86
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:36,084
Rym: It's an outrage.

87
00:06:36,124 --> 00:06:37,770
Rym: those stores are all ripoffs blah blah blah.

88
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,865
Rym: They are all ripoffs.

89
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:46,209
Rym: no It's not because the stores themselves aren't necessarily a ripoff because the margins on textbooks are really really razor-thin.

90
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:46,932
Scott: well It's not.

91
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:51,210
Scott: it's a. it's a combination of the store being a ripoff as well as the textbook.

92
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,970
Rym: Well the storage does the whatever it can because otherwise it wouldn't make any money at all.

93
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,894
Rym: It couldn't even exist.

94
00:06:56,054 --> 00:06:57,279
Rym: and you're paying the.

95
00:06:57,942 --> 00:07:03,553
Rym: when you pay the high prices at a textbook store Especially for the used books you're paying for the convenience You're not paying for anything else.

96
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:10,190
Rym: the actual ripoff is the fact that the eighth edition of a textbook is usually identical to the seventh edition.

97
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:15,070
Rym: But yet, it's a hundred and eighty dollars while the used seventh edition is five dollars.

98
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:20,070
Rym: But they'll always change a couple of the questions so that you can't actually do your homework from the seventh edition.

99
00:07:20,512 --> 00:07:28,330
Scott: This is why I think that they should not put Assignments in textbooks, but they they do it because they make money.

100
00:07:29,191 --> 00:07:42,125
Scott: But if I was a professor and I had the power to choose textbooks if I Liked a textbook because if you know the text in it, and I would never and I happen to have assignments I would never actually assign those assignments.

101
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:43,050
Scott: I would never make.

102
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:44,773
Rym: They don't even think that much.

103
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:47,618
Rym: It's not even that issue because I went to our a college.

104
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:56,850
Rym: You know we I went to a university and with one exception Never was I forced to buy a textbook that was actually useful to the class.

105
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,752
Rym: Anytime.

106
00:07:57,832 --> 00:08:08,130
Rym: a professor always has the list like you gotta buy this book in this book in this book and they do like One chapter from the book and you didn't even need to read it because he just gave all the information to you in the lecture.

107
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:19,130
Rym: Anyway, yeah, it wasn't in the lecture wasn't tested or anything and he'd say oh read these chapters of the book And then read these chapters and then read these chapters, and it never came up in class at all.

108
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:20,435
Rym: It was totally told.

109
00:08:20,455 --> 00:08:22,203
Rym: I told me to buy that book for no reason.

110
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:23,589
Scott: that is absolutely true.

111
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:27,848
Scott: Many oftentimes I would buy a textbook and never use it.

112
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:34,630
Scott: the only times I used a textbook were when I had say a math or physics class and I was assigned graded homework.

113
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,384
Rym: Oh see you forget that I had my no homework policy.

114
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:39,900
Rym: so even if that were the case I still did graded homework.

115
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,330
Scott: I didn't do non graded homework.

116
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,635
Rym: I didn't do graded homework.

117
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:46,370
Scott: some teachers would say read you know read these chapters.

118
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,989
Scott: I never read those chapters unless it was a literature class in which case I would get the book read it and keep it.

119
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,316
Rym: I Still didn't.

120
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:55,550
Rym: but that's because I had to read tree of red stars.

121
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:57,521
Rym: No, no, I never owned that.

122
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,110
Rym: I never read that book.

123
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,225
Scott: I took other literature classes like real ones.

124
00:09:02,305 --> 00:09:03,310
Scott: later with real books.

125
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:09,150
Rym: I didn't and honestly what I usually did because most classes the professor would assign the book or whatever.

126
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,430
Rym: But it didn't matter except in my PTC classes.

127
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:17,530
Rym: But it was just that they'd say we have to use the book and they'd refer to the book and that sort of thing.

128
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,182
Rym: But they'd always say you gotta buy this edition.

129
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:24,690
Rym: if I bought a textbook at all I always just bought the previous edition and dealt with it.

130
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:31,320
Rym: and if there were assignments I Paid someone in the class who was dumb enough to buy the book a dollar or two to let me copy the questions from his book.

131
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:40,910
Rym: Yeah or my favorite thing to do was to Buy the book and then return it for a refund within seven days after having Xeroxed all the assignments out of it.

132
00:09:41,434 --> 00:09:42,443
Scott: That's a good move too.

133
00:09:42,524 --> 00:09:48,625
Rym: or even better I'd go to the bookstore open it do the homework really quick in the bookstore and then close it and leave.

134
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:50,170
Scott: that also works.

135
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:54,925
Scott: Basically College textbooks are a ripoff all around.

136
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,773
Scott: they make you buy ones You don't need.

137
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,599
Scott: the bookstore has a huge markup.

138
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:01,549
Scott: the publisher charges way too much for them and keeps changing them.

139
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:14,181
Scott: It's it's just not good at all and you should do your best to do everything within your power to avoid spending and every save as much possible money on textbooks as you can.

140
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:19,420
Scott: if you absolutely need to have a book then Buy it like used at the biggest discount you can.

141
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:21,508
Scott: if you don't need the current edition get the old edition.

142
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:23,008
Scott: if you don't need The book don't buy the book.

143
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:30,150
Rym: Well, the most important thing is pay attention because if you ever have a professor who says yeah buy the previous edition of this book.

144
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:32,600
Rym: They're almost guaranteed to be a good professor.

145
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:35,110
Rym: and also watch out for professors who?

146
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,042
Rym: Tell you to buy specific books and don't do much with them.

147
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:44,529
Rym: a lot of times either They wrote that book or one of their friend professors wrote that book and they're making money off of it.

148
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:46,640
Rym: And that might sound evil and shady.

149
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,470
Rym: and you know what that happened a lot at RIT.

150
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:53,669
Scott: yeah, I think I took like two or three classes where a professor told me to buy their book.

151
00:10:53,689 --> 00:11:04,900
Scott: and You know the thing is I usually didn't but a couple times they'd be like yeah I know I'm telling you to buy my book So I'm just gonna give you all copies of it cuz I can.

152
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,801
Scott: cuz my book and I think one time They're just like yeah, I'm gonna make my book optional.

153
00:11:11,022 --> 00:11:17,828
Scott: Just you know cuz whatever I guess Whenever you have to take a class and oh one time one of the dudes books was a pamphlet.

154
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:18,410
Scott: so I bought it.

155
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:23,070
Rym: Just look at the what books are assigned and don't buy them right away.

156
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:30,328
Rym: Wait and try to figure out if you actually need the book or not because in all seriousness At least half the time you don't need that book.

157
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:36,470
Scott: Yeah, this is mostly for freshmen who always go in with their parents like and before school even starts.

158
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:40,850
Scott: You know when they're moving into the dorms they go to the bookstore and they buy every single book.

159
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:42,185
Scott: It says two on the list.

160
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,070
Rym: in fact I'm gonna give you all a little hint cuz I know your parents don't listen to GeekNights.

161
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:58,143
Rym: If you're going to college and your parents are going to buy your books for your first quarter or semester or whatever say yes Let them buy every single book even the optional book all the books you need.

162
00:11:58,183 --> 00:12:00,771
Rym: take the list of books that your professor said you Need

163
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:02,497
Scott: and get every one of them and

164
00:12:02,537 --> 00:12:06,450
Rym: then as soon as they leave return all the books except the ones you need

165
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:07,434
Scott: Exactly

166
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:17,369
Rym: now also the bookstore at any college is always gonna try to Take your books back like you bought a book for a hundred bucks And then at the end they say hey, we'll buy your used textbooks back and resell them.

167
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:22,232
Rym: They're gonna resell that book for like $90.

168
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:25,724
Scott: It's the same thing with selling blood is selling video games to GameStop.

169
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:27,610
Scott: All right used to give it to GameStop for ten bucks.

170
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,095
Scott: They sell it for ten bucks.

171
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:33,490
Rym: You realize most colleges are gonna give you like four dollars for your hundred dollar textbook.

172
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:39,568
Scott: This is why you go on Amazon or eBay and you sell it and you're not gonna be able to sell it.

173
00:12:39,588 --> 00:12:44,725
Rym: you go Find out when the next class of that is scheduled the next semester.

174
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:50,670
Rym: show up on the first day Outside the room and say here's the textbook 50 bucks that worked.

175
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,890
Rym: It's so wonderfully and I the school will try to stop you sometimes do it.

176
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,638
Rym: Anyway, it's totally worth it.

177
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,362
Scott: that works.

178
00:12:57,462 --> 00:13:02,342
Rym: if you're too lazy to eBay or Amazon Because you'll get better prices you'll get instant cash.

179
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:10,388
Rym: and if you're really clever What you do is stand by at the end of a semester the used bookstore thing because usually one.

180
00:13:10,408 --> 00:13:13,419
Rym: they'll have a bin Where you can throw the books that they're not gonna buy.

181
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,503
Rym: the scam there is.

182
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:16,250
Rym: they'll just take that bin and then sell those books.

183
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:28,289
Rym: Anyway, yep What you do is listen and as soon as they offer someone money for a book immediately say I'll give you 20 bucks for it Or I'll give you five bucks more or ten bucks more and just buy all the books and then resell them.

184
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:30,157
Scott: That's tough.

185
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:31,470
Rym: It's not tough at all.

186
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:38,901
Rym: the only problem is the bookstore is eventually gonna call campus safety and all you have to do is Leave and then come back as soon as campus safety is gone.

187
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:45,097
Rym: or get a friend to do it for you or sell them Just outside his site like around the corner Like as someone's walking up to sell the books.

188
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:49,494
Rym: just say I'll give you five bucks more than whatever they offer for every single book You try to sell.

189
00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:50,298
Rym: just come back to me.

190
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:56,746
Scott: You're gonna be like this illegal book dealer I know but it's it's sort of it's you know, you're gonna be like a guy with like a trench coat.

191
00:13:56,947 --> 00:14:04,358
Rym: I got textbooks But the thing is it's perfectly legal and actually a lot of bookstores are gonna try to lie to you and say that you can't resell the books.

192
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:08,090
Rym: a lot of Bookstores gonna lie to you and say that you can't use the old edition.

193
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,214
Rym: The professor's won't allow it.

194
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:17,589
Rym: if you ask a professor like if I did this once we had to get the eighth edition of some Bullshit public speaking book and we actually needed it because there were assignments in it.

195
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:23,011
Rym: So I asked the professor if I could get away with using the seventh edition and she thought for a minute and said you know What?

196
00:14:23,473 --> 00:14:25,341
Rym: yeah, probably I don't think anything changed.

197
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:28,460
Rym: and then the next week She tells the class.

198
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:38,570
Rym: Yes, so Rym over there cuz I my professors knew I was named Rym usually Said that the seventh edition is the same as the eighth edition and it's only ten bucks.

199
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:41,747
Rym: So go buy that one and if you bought the other book, I'm sorry return.

200
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:42,270
Scott: All right, let's done.

201
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,395
Scott: We're done with the textbooks now.

202
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,103
Rym: Well, it's kind of relevant to what we're doing tonight.

203
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:46,530
Scott: So are we gonna do that tonight?

204
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,554
Scott: I thought we didn't decide yet.

205
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:49,944
Rym: Well, I decided right now cuz it's kind of a anyway.

206
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:50,667
Rym: All right.

207
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,832
Rym: Yeah, we're lazy We're tired.

208
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:54,324
Rym: I want to eat and we weren't sure what we were gonna do the show on.

209
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:55,510
Scott: I do actual news now.

210
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:56,533
Rym: You got news.

211
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:57,477
Scott: I do have a news.

212
00:14:57,517 --> 00:14:58,280
Rym: What's it about?

213
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:14,815
Scott: Well, basically, this is lady who's in some Evil homeowners association and you know how much we hate homeowners associations because they are the living embodiment of evil And they just evil very specifically the kind of evil that like Alright, so the u.s.

214
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,603
Rym: Isn't faded foreign nations and there's genocide going on.

215
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:19,810
Scott: That's more evil than homeowners associations.

216
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:30,689
Rym: But what I was about to say is whatever I mean not from a real, you know human perspective or my personal perspective But from a has a chance to affect my life directly right now.

217
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:45,310
Scott: yeah, a homeowner's Association basically is a group of people that say we care more about money and Feeling good about ourselves and feeling powerful then we care about freedom and civil liberties and right and wrong.

218
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:57,010
Rym: Oh the way a homeowner's association works in the United States because a lot of people might not be familiar with this really simply is That they're usually attached to the deed of land that you buy and you can't opt out of it.

219
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:58,745
Scott: Or you can you can live somewhere else.

220
00:15:58,765 --> 00:15:59,350
Scott: That's your choice.

221
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:02,388
Rym: Yeah, your choices live somewhere else, but a lot of land in the?

222
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:02,730
Rym: u.s.

223
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:14,317
Rym: now if you want to buy a house on it, you have to agree to this homeowners association and everyone who lives in a certain area is bound by it and you have little elections to decide who in the community is going to run it.

224
00:16:14,397 --> 00:16:20,230
Rym: and you have a little board of directors and you all have to pay dues and basically Anything the board votes.

225
00:16:21,053 --> 00:16:28,410
Rym: You have to do if the vote board just decided to vote that all houses have to be painted pink If you don't paint your house pink you get fucking evicted.

226
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:30,215
Scott: Yeah, I mean you buy it.

227
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:36,253
Scott: This isn't like I'm renting a place and as a landlord this is I own the land I have a mortgage.

228
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:37,376
Scott: I own the house.

229
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:40,345
Scott: It belongs to me, but in order.

230
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:42,170
Rym: well, it belongs to the bank, right?

231
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,156
Scott: Well, okay.

232
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:44,286
Scott: I paid off my mortgage.

233
00:16:44,347 --> 00:16:44,589
Scott: I own.

234
00:16:45,911 --> 00:16:46,515
Scott: Let's say you do.

235
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:48,166
Scott: let's let's say you paid off the mortgage.

236
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:50,399
Scott: it doesn't matter I own the land in the house.

237
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:51,203
Scott: They belong to me.

238
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:56,770
Scott: I have the deed everything It's all mine, but when I bought the land, I was forced to sign a contract.

239
00:16:56,911 --> 00:16:58,928
Scott: otherwise, they would refuse to sell the land to me.

240
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:03,909
Scott: and when I signed that contract I agreed that I would do whatever the homeowner Association said.

241
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:11,755
Scott: and If they say paint my house pink and I don't they can kick me out of the house that I own Owning it belongs.

242
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:16,329
Scott: That's like if I came to you and I said, oh, that's a nice Computer you got there that you bought.

243
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:19,837
Scott: Yeah, too Even though you own that computer belongs to you.

244
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:23,609
Scott: when you bought it you sign this contract that says I can pee on it.

245
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:25,419
Scott: You have to let me pee on it.

246
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,143
Scott: You have to let me.

247
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:31,183
Scott: and basically The story here is that there's some lady who lives this.

248
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:33,130
Scott: actually stories like this happen every day.

249
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:37,370
Rym: But if you want to see him read far, yeah stories like this happen every single day.

250
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:46,769
Scott: but this particular one is in the Wall Street Journal and I think it's Pretty good because it's actually people standing up for themselves rather than just homeowners associations peeing on everybody.

251
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:54,036
Rym: granted There was a recent story where a homeowners association got sued by all the members of it and all All the members.

252
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:55,967
Rym: Well, not all the members less than the majority.

253
00:17:56,068 --> 00:18:08,349
Scott: Oh good But basically what happens is this lady set up a clothesline which is apparently banned in the vast majority of homeowners Because clothes lines make your area look very low income, you know.

254
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:11,320
Rym: How does someone not have a washer and dryer?

255
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,999
Rym: or you know, we have a washer and there's a dryer right there But I use a clothesline anyway, because I like to write.

256
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,830
Scott: so she set up a clothesline and the person next door was person.

257
00:18:23,154 --> 00:18:28,028
Scott: the person next door thought it was just temporary that you know because maybe the dryer broke or something.

258
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,439
Scott: and then The person kept putting it up.

259
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,370
Scott: and then they complained to the homeowners association.

260
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:34,917
Scott: and now the ladies having to fight.

261
00:18:35,017 --> 00:18:41,099
Scott: but she's apparently got a few friends in the homeowners Association because Person across the street is thinking about setting one up too.

262
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,430
Rym: Well, remember here's the modus operandi of a homeowners Association.

263
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:54,357
Rym: This is why it's so hard to fight them because you think all right They can't do anything too stupid because the majority of people in your little community have to vote and the majority of people living In a suburb can't be stupid.

264
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:55,985
Scott: Can they done done done one?

265
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:04,129
Rym: yeah, they're run by you and you get to vote but who has time to deal with that if they also have a job?

266
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:19,530
Scott: the Vast majority of people who are active in homeowners associations or even though they exist are old biddies and crotchety old men and People who care about their property value more than they care about anything else because there's just people who sit around taking care of their property.

267
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:25,835
Scott: I mean people who people are people who like the kind of person who would live in a house That's in the homeowners Association.

268
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:35,068
Scott: because I mean you go look at these houses and it's in a place where all the houses look the Same and they all have really well-tended lawns and they're all clean and they're all right Because that's what the homeowners Association makes you do.

269
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:44,038
Scott: so the person who likes who really cares about the fact that all the houses on the street look the same and look nice is The kind of person who's gonna move into this kind of place.

270
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:57,008
Scott: and thus if you aren't that kind of person and you move in You're surrounded by all these people who care about what your property looks like and they'll be upset If the other person's things don't match their things and that sort of thing and now to

271
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,845
Rym: mope because you know people who have lives don't bother with this because they don't care.

272
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:11,330
Rym: unless there's an egregious thing like When your neighbor scraps the 19th car in his front lawn I don't see a problem with the homeowners Association intervening at that point.

273
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:19,950
Scott: No, but if I have you know, if I decide that I'm gonna be you know, I'm a mechanic I like to work on cars and I have an old Camaro and I want to work on it in my driveway.

274
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:20,816
Scott: That's not.

275
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:22,670
Scott: you're not allowed to do that in most homeowners Association.

276
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,570
Scott: No, I'm not even allowed to own a car that's older than like this were over six years.

277
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:32,370
Rym: Even if this were actually a legitimate democracy It wouldn't be that bad because people should generally have the right to self-govern.

278
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:38,790
Rym: I think the issue is that you know, like I was saying most of the people are old biddies and crotchety But there's no minority rights in a homeowners Association.

279
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,955
Rym: Well, I was gonna get to that.

280
00:20:40,276 --> 00:20:44,429
Scott: if you are just captain interrupting tonight because you're taking so long here We got to get to the main bit.

281
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,565
Rym: You're the one who brought this news up, you know, and we've talked about this before.

282
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:48,590
Rym: I just won't say anything then.

283
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:49,534
Scott: All right, fine.

284
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:52,890
Rym: So the other inch I thought you were gonna stop if you're gonna go.

285
00:20:52,950 --> 00:21:09,130
Scott: I gotta say the last interesting thing that you've been preventing me from saying what's interesting because so far this is like every other homeowners story because Apparently there are laws in some states that set that put that Restrict certain things that homeowners associations are not allowed to ban.

286
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:17,218
Scott: For example in some states homeowners associations are not allowed to band like solar heating and solar electricity Generating equipment and things like that.

287
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:28,109
Scott: and this clothesline lady is claiming at some you know It's an environmental thing to use the clothesline because you're not using like dryers I think are like the third most electricity using things in houses and stuff like that.

288
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:33,777
Rym: Yeah, I mean even if you have a gas dryer they cost a lot of money to run Oh and a lot of power and energy.

289
00:21:33,817 --> 00:21:42,550
Scott: So in some states, I think two states Clotheslines you're specifically not allowed to ban them because they are solar energy like equipment.

290
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:44,329
Rym: So is this lady in one of those states?

291
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,835
Scott: No But she oh.

292
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:56,810
Scott: she's in one of those states where it's questionable and it's not Explicitly written that clotheslines are not allowed or you know not allowed to be banned But solar stuff is not allowed to be banned.

293
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:57,553
Scott: So she's got.

294
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:59,259
Scott: she might have to fight in court to say so.

295
00:22:00,022 --> 00:22:07,470
Rym: the clothesline is a solar equipment something You know, the moral is pretty simple, even though a lot of places you might want to move have homeowners associations.

296
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,857
Rym: Don't move where there's one.

297
00:22:10,058 --> 00:22:10,982
Rym: don't ever move.

298
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:17,103
Rym: while they can be used for good The majority of them are used for evil the evil of old bitty cat.

299
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:23,530
Scott: ladies unless you really you know Care more about what your neighbor's lawn looks like then you care about your freedom to do whatever.

300
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:29,992
Rym: Because it's not that if you have a job or something You're not gonna be able to participate in this stupid homeowners Association.

301
00:22:30,012 --> 00:22:39,307
Rym: because these people tend to set it up so that the meetings are always at like two o'clock on a Wednesday because they know All the real people can't show up because they have jobs or stuff to do.

302
00:22:39,327 --> 00:22:42,870
Scott: Yep Well, that's the other thing is they don't want those kind of people living there.

303
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,230
Scott: They want like, you know a nice typical American family.

304
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,084
Scott: Well, one person goes to work and one person stays home to go the homeowners.

305
00:22:48,184 --> 00:23:01,130
Scott: Oh, yeah, and you know 1.5 kids and two cars They don't want like two 20 year old guys who were a Commuting in Tekken and setting up all sorts of cables and wires and dishes and antennas and air hockey's in the basement.

306
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:01,838
Scott: They don't want that.

307
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:14,408
Rym: Oh, man Yeah Okay Anyway things of the day.

308
00:23:14,428 --> 00:23:17,260
Rym: I'll be real brief about this because I don't think much need to be said.

309
00:23:17,902 --> 00:23:23,557
Rym: The view is probably the most facile garbage talk show in the english-speaking world.

310
00:23:23,637 --> 00:23:24,560
Rym: I don't think anyone does.

311
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,156
Scott: I've only heard of it because people keep like saying stuff about it on dig.

312
00:23:28,477 --> 00:23:29,100
Rym: It's just it's.

313
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:31,060
Rym: No, it's for idiots.

314
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:36,000
Scott: All I know is that it's like a show with a bunch of ladies on in the morning talking about stupid shit.

315
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:38,207
Rym: but here's the thing this one.

316
00:23:38,247 --> 00:23:58,940
Rym: there's a woman on here who was a creationist and whatever and whoopi Goldberg is on and She is very delicately trying to put forth that maybe this woman hasn't quite thought her clever plan all the way through and aside from the fact this woman just keeps interrupting and Really just doesn't say anything worthwhile nor does anyone else sitting around this table except whoopi Goldberg.

317
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,360
Rym: But the woman in all seriousness did not know if the earth was flat or round.

318
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:06,424
Rym: Honestly didn't.

319
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:10,640
Scott: I saw him dig something today where like they were trying to cover up for her or something.

320
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,990
Scott: But it's obvious when you watch this video.

321
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:15,320
Scott: She does not know if the world is round or flat.

322
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,190
Rym: She starts acting like yeah, it's something I'd look up in a textbook.

323
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:24,955
Rym: and then everyone else starts getting these looks of And they start trying to dig into her.

324
00:24:24,975 --> 00:24:30,784
Rym: and She starts trying like she starts to realize that something's wrong something she just said is wrong.

325
00:24:30,824 --> 00:24:34,798
Rym: and she gets this flustered look on her face and she just starts spouting more and more drivel.

326
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:39,533
Rym: and This woman seriously did not know if the earth was round or flat.

327
00:24:39,914 --> 00:24:44,620
Rym: and if her kid asked her that question I she said I best be getting to the library.

328
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:55,620
Scott: Yeah, you hear kid probably come home from school and tell you what's what but this is you know This is just further a I guess supporting something that the view is terrible.

329
00:24:56,463 --> 00:24:59,955
Scott: Besides that is it something I've learned in recent years.

330
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:02,793
Scott: Is that you know, we always say Oh, most people are stupid.

331
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:07,316
Scott: blah, you know And you see like funny things were like some guy on a game show doesn't know if the world is.

332
00:25:07,437 --> 00:25:08,120
Scott: you know that the earth?

333
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,083
Scott: Revolves around the Sun.

334
00:25:09,123 --> 00:25:16,751
Scott: he says the Sun revolves around the earth or something like that, right and you say all these stupid people Famous people are just as stupid.

335
00:25:17,113 --> 00:25:17,977
Scott: just you know, I don't know.

336
00:25:17,997 --> 00:25:20,872
Rym: if she was famous She might have just been on and she's on a TV show.

337
00:25:20,912 --> 00:25:22,360
Scott: She's I guess famous enough.

338
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:25,820
Scott: She might not be super famous like, you know, I guess Steven Spielberg famous.

339
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:31,582
Rym: It's kind of like how a lot of actors get really into social activism even if they don't understand the issues They hand.

340
00:25:31,703 --> 00:25:36,161
Scott: but famous people are just as stupid as the rest of us don't Say.

341
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:37,204
Scott: I

342
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:55,437
Rym: would like to point out that despite the fact that the view is just a terrible show and nothing worthwhile has ever come out of it When this woman went beyond the like beyond the black of stupidity like beyond the edge of the stupidity universe Into the unknown void where they're there aren't be dragons because dragons are smarter than that.

343
00:25:55,498 --> 00:25:57,062
Scott: Yeah, there's There's.

344
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:58,209
Rym: it's where the front fell off.

345
00:25:58,229 --> 00:26:08,716
Rym: Yeah But everyone else on that table Obviously had this moment of while that woman's stupid even though they couldn't say it outright.

346
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:09,920
Scott: see that's the other problem.

347
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:11,840
Scott: Is that just in with television in general?

348
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,380
Scott: I guess also on a show that's watched by you know, stupid people stupid people and is like.

349
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:25,208
Scott: You know that that kind of show like a morning talk show is not the kind of show where people want like yelling and like Wow, you're dumb on it.

350
00:26:25,228 --> 00:26:26,376
Scott: You know, that's they save.

351
00:26:26,396 --> 00:26:29,345
Scott: that I do But they do.

352
00:26:29,406 --> 00:26:32,780
Scott: those shows are mostly saved for like the late-night Comedy Central types.

353
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,260
Scott: They're not the early morning network television types.

354
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:44,740
Scott: And I think that's a problem with television and a reason why there's a lot more is a lot less skeptical and Don't think about it this way.

355
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:51,462
Rym: You're you're a business and you want to put something on TV that's gonna get people who are up at whatever time to watch your Thing.

356
00:26:52,025 --> 00:26:54,540
Rym: so what will make people be more inclined to go?

357
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,828
Rym: Ah and keep watching and feel good about themselves.

358
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:05,235
Rym: some woo-woo psychic lady saying yeah And you know just talking about how she's a psychic and she found the kidnapped kid with her fave psychic powers.

359
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:07,852
Rym: or James Randi saying That's not true.

360
00:27:07,872 --> 00:27:08,358
Rym: and here's proof.

361
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,300
Rym: One's a lot more interesting even though it's completely made up.

362
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,920
Scott: Well, I think the difference is would you rather watch some people going chatty chatty chatty chatty chatty?

363
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,200
Scott: Like they're in a coffee shop, or do you rather someone going?

364
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,279
Scott: Wow, you are stupid and you should be going back to elementary school because you don't know if the earth is.

365
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:36,583
Rym: Whoopi Goldberg was making a very Diplomatic point and she was doing it in a very conciliatory manner and not just let loose and said wow You're a dumbass.

366
00:27:36,603 --> 00:27:37,767
Rym: well even that she didn't do that.

367
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:45,086
Rym: the fact that the the stupid indignant woman just kept interrupting her and wouldn't Even let her finish her very conciliatory Remark was quite.

368
00:27:45,568 --> 00:27:49,813
Scott: I think we just need some sort of thing where we can just say well You have to go back to elementary school.

369
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:50,539
Scott: You're not allowed to work.

370
00:27:51,122 --> 00:27:56,671
Rym: I am of the mind that anyone who wants further education of sir I mean obviously not everyone should get.

371
00:27:56,811 --> 00:27:57,817
Rym: you know medical training.

372
00:27:58,139 --> 00:27:58,899
Rym: now I'm done.

373
00:27:59,503 --> 00:28:06,098
Rym: I think any adult in this country should be eligible to get Basic schooling if I think they should be forced to get it if they need it.

374
00:28:06,941 --> 00:28:08,388
Scott: All right, anyway.

375
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:08,931
Rym: What do you got?

376
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,560
Scott: so you played the Oregon trails?

377
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,652
Rym: It's one of the my favorite games ever.

378
00:28:12,673 --> 00:28:13,479
Scott: you got dysentery.

379
00:28:14,222 --> 00:28:15,647
Rym: See it was always like the.

380
00:28:15,848 --> 00:28:18,135
Rym: you know your thing sank in the river.

381
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:21,808
Rym: you lost four Bullets and a hundred pounds of food.

382
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:30,300
Scott: and Billy right well that game You know you can set up emulators and play the Apple to version and there are ways to play that game still.

383
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:35,843
Scott: But it's not the easiest thing to get a hold of and get running on your system Especially not perfectly.

384
00:28:36,024 --> 00:28:45,331
Scott: and some guy made a remake of Oregon Trail in flash, but to bring it up to the modern times He he re-themed it, and he called it thule trail.

385
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:48,100
Scott: I guess the company is the thule company.

386
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,728
Rym: Oh, I know that company.

387
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:54,619
Scott: Yeah, whatever they make software I guess but it's bit It's a road trip.

388
00:28:54,881 --> 00:28:59,520
Scott: You know a modern road trip and like you to just to give you an idea the theme of the game is real quick.

389
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:20,320
Scott: Instead of going to the store to buy wagon wheels at the beginning of the game and you know oxen You go to Clem's mini-mart in Chicago And you buy magazines and games food and drinks music pellets and car parts And you choose instead of choosing like the type of wagon you choose like between the SUV the speed wagon or the sports car.

390
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:22,668
Scott: It seems you know it's.

391
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:32,477
Scott: it's got the same gameplay as the old Oregon Trail for the Apple - But it's got the re theming of modern times And I think it's pretty fun for anyone who looking for an Oregon Trail in flash.

392
00:29:32,658 --> 00:29:33,180
Scott: when huh?

393
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:45,567
Rym: So I was looking to see if I was sure cuz I didn't remember if it was thule or another company I was thinking of but according to Wikipedia here thule is also a title of an ancient possibly not having existed island Thule.

394
00:29:45,688 --> 00:29:53,373
Scott: yes, Sweden Sweden it says thule and then in like the L and the E sort of combined and it says Sweden in there I think it's a Swedish software developer.

395
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:57,770
Scott: ah Yeah, all right, it's thule trail calm all right, whatever.

396
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:03,433
Rym: It's not Cthulhu, so yeah, it's all Cthulhu based, Oregon Trail You're trying to get to really yeah, ooh.

397
00:30:03,513 --> 00:30:06,230
Scott: You're trying to get out Really really a trail.

398
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,779
Scott: It's got to be made.

399
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:13,120
Rym: It would be perfect if the map was just made up as you go and didn't actually go anyway.

400
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,732
Scott: Hey, the cult is five dollars to get across the burning sea.

401
00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:17,379
Rym: oh, but they hate you anyway.

402
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:20,652
Rym: Billy has dysentery.

403
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,640
Rym: Billy has died of insanity.

404
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:34,372
Rym: So Luckily I guess my news sparked a conversation along these lines, but tonight We're gonna begin another one of those long-running series that won't be updated.

405
00:30:34,472 --> 00:30:39,020
Scott: so I feel like we've done an episode or two of this before Especially in the early days of the show.

406
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,028
Rym: I think we've done this specific thing and we haven't.

407
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:43,920
Rym: I kind of want to break it up more into actual specific advice.

408
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,420
Scott: Yeah, it is often asked.

409
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:51,520
Scott: It's like one of the most common questions we get in emails and forums and things and a lot of people really suck at it.

410
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,480
Rym: So the question tonight is what is semprene?

411
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:59,643
Scott: Well you see In 1957 or 58 right?

412
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,395
Rym: The topic tonight is how to not suck at going to college part one.

413
00:31:07,415 --> 00:31:17,995
Scott: well mostly today We're gonna concentrate on the stuff before college from the time when you're just a kid in high school To the time where you say this is what I'm gonna do.

414
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:19,080
Scott: That's the stuff.

415
00:31:19,483 --> 00:31:28,640
Rym: Yep part of it's because a lot of people Particularly people from colleges are going to throw you a line and feed you one at the same time.

416
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:36,159
Rym: They're going to lie in any way they can to get you to go to their school Basically everything your high school tells you about going to college.

417
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:40,100
Scott: now They do have your your best interests at heart usually like your guidance counselors and stuff.

418
00:31:40,521 --> 00:31:44,755
Scott: But they don't know as much as they you know, it seems like they know.

419
00:31:44,796 --> 00:31:46,020
Scott: they just know a lot more than you.

420
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:47,869
Scott: So it seems like they know everything.

421
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:48,713
Scott: it is their job.

422
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,100
Scott: They must know they don't know shit.

423
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:51,160
Rym: I mean here's an example.

424
00:31:51,301 --> 00:31:57,749
Rym: I went to my guidance counselor who I'd never met when I was a junior in high school And I said high school guidance counselor.

425
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:00,300
Rym: I think I want to go into computers or music.

426
00:32:00,742 --> 00:32:01,507
Rym: What should I do?

427
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:03,700
Rym: and he said well if you want to go into computers?

428
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,220
Rym: You should go into a major called computer science so and go to like MIT or Caltech.

429
00:32:09,822 --> 00:32:11,992
Rym: I was like okay, and what about music?

430
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:13,318
Rym: He's like you don't want to go into music.

431
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:18,372
Rym: Not only that but that was the extent of his knowledge of everything I wanted.

432
00:32:18,392 --> 00:32:18,854
Scott: that was it.

433
00:32:19,095 --> 00:32:20,800
Scott: my guidance counselor was pretty similar.

434
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:24,454
Scott: I mean he didn't know about like smaller schools or any.

435
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:25,538
Scott: you know they don't really know.

436
00:32:25,618 --> 00:32:27,526
Rym: you have to do No, no he also of course.

437
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:28,089
Rym: He said well.

438
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:30,540
Rym: We'll go to U of M too because everyone went to U of M.

439
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:31,684
Scott: Yeah, but I mean like.

440
00:32:31,704 --> 00:32:35,639
Scott: they didn't know about schools like say Rose-Hulman or even CMU or not.

441
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,651
Rym: even then He didn't know that there were majors other than computer science.

442
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:40,620
Rym: think about this, and this is a problem.

443
00:32:40,801 --> 00:32:46,607
Rym: this is a huge problem in the computer industry because Computer science is not the major it used to be.

444
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:50,579
Rym: but I don't think anyone at the high school level knows that.

445
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,559
Rym: I mean I didn't know it when I was in high school and no one none of my teachers knew it.

446
00:32:53,962 --> 00:33:03,999
Scott: No one you think your guidance counselor knows the difference between IT Software engineering computer science electrical engineering computer engineering or micro electronic engineering applied networking.

447
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:06,171
Scott: now They're all super different.

448
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:07,540
Scott: they all super matter.

449
00:33:07,982 --> 00:33:16,560
Scott: But if you don't know that when you're in high school because your guidance counselor doesn't freaking know What do you got to do your own research, and you can't be relying on those guidance counseling yep?

450
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,304
Rym: I mean think about it.

451
00:33:17,385 --> 00:33:24,135
Rym: I went to RIT for an orientation thing and I was like yeah I want to be a computer science major, and they were like oh really coding coding coding coding.

452
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:27,567
Rym: I was like what about Networking and engineering?

453
00:33:27,587 --> 00:33:29,437
Rym: like oh, that's a different major that you've never heard of.

454
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:36,500
Scott: yeah So the first thing you have to do in high school before even thinking about college is what do you want to do?

455
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,754
Scott: I mean, maybe you want to be a mechanic or something like that you got.

456
00:33:39,774 --> 00:33:45,553
Scott: maybe you want to be a fireman Maybe you want to be you know an astronaut me because you're still in kindergarten.

457
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:45,854
Scott: now.

458
00:33:45,895 --> 00:34:00,020
Rym: more importantly when you think about what you want To do try not to think along the standard lines because there are a million awesome careers out there That no one's ever going to tell you about and you're gonna find out about him long after it's too late.

459
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,427
Scott: I know like since I've started working.

460
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:11,056
Scott: I see all these jobs about and I start to realize wow that's someone's job like Underwater welding or like dude you make so much money underwater.

461
00:34:11,076 --> 00:34:13,103
Scott: well super dangerous But you make so much money.

462
00:34:13,324 --> 00:34:18,766
Scott: if I own if only I'd known you know you could even like within Careers that are obvious.

463
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:19,934
Scott: like you think about teaching.

464
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:25,080
Scott: Oh, I don't want to be a teacher But then no one tells you oh you didn't even realize you could be a shop teacher.

465
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:27,340
Scott: Oh, I would totally be a shop teacher.

466
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:36,904
Scott: There's a zillion careers out there in the world and most of them You just won't even think about because they're sort of obvious, but non obvious They're hiding in plain sight.

467
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:41,897
Rym: a good example was printing like printing science and color science and all those things.

468
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:48,467
Rym: because I Didn't even think about that and I heard after I got to RIT Yeah, RIT has like a good program in that.

469
00:34:48,888 --> 00:34:53,882
Rym: now RIT has a world-famous program in that and you can make a zillion dollars Doing it.

470
00:34:53,902 --> 00:34:54,907
Scott: so what no one does.

471
00:34:55,047 --> 00:35:02,980
Rym: one of our friends one of my friends from high school actually went to RIT and went Into that major and I thought oh whatever printing something His job is awesome.

472
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:04,305
Rym: I would love to have his job.

473
00:35:04,346 --> 00:35:10,117
Rym: if I'd known that major was what I didn't know it was I would have gone into it and forget IT packaging science.

474
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,619
Scott: racecar driver.

475
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:14,691
Scott: Damn, racecar driver didn't think of that job.

476
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,377
Rym: Yeah, you realize that that's an option.

477
00:35:16,518 --> 00:35:18,063
Rym: seriously It's not like.

478
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:21,534
Rym: oh you like you might think about world-famous racecar driver.

479
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:26,878
Scott: It may be a little difficult, but Professional racecar driver making money definitely an option.

480
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:27,280
Scott: yeah.

481
00:35:27,582 --> 00:35:32,432
Rym: So if you think you want to do something even if it's out land It's just do some research and find out what it takes.

482
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:37,287
Scott: work in the air hockey Manufacturing factory, I don't think that's the greatest job.

483
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:38,630
Scott: No, but it could be a job.

484
00:35:40,322 --> 00:35:41,426
Scott: There are jobs out there.

485
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:46,180
Rym: there are there are two and there are exceptions to this and I've known some of them.

486
00:35:46,300 --> 00:36:01,384
Rym: So this is not 100% like Perfect law, but generally if you don't know what you want to do, and you don't have a clear plan forward You probably either shouldn't go to college right away It's.

487
00:36:01,404 --> 00:36:07,150
Rym: or if you go to college don't go to a major university Don't go to any don't do anything expensive.

488
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:07,412
Scott: like.

489
00:36:07,492 --> 00:36:16,730
Scott: if you don't know what you want to do either Go to your community college and just take classes that you think are fun and try to figure out what you want to do while you bide your time.

490
00:36:16,751 --> 00:36:22,876
Scott: or Maybe you know I mean a lot of people just went right into jobs without going to college.

491
00:36:22,957 --> 00:36:27,160
Scott: You know like Steve Jobs Yeah, Steve Wozniak or Bill Gates dropped out of college.

492
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:34,044
Rym: You know if you're gonna go to an expensive college like RIT or Caltech or Yale or something you better know what the fuck you're Doing before you go there.

493
00:36:34,204 --> 00:36:43,960
Rym: because and RIT this was so prevalent where someone RIT Someone would come to RIT and they'd go undeclared me or they'd go into a major and then realize they didn't like it.

494
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,700
Rym: Yeah, but usually because that's okay because you think you won't like it and that's at least a start.

495
00:36:47,781 --> 00:36:54,254
Rym: But a lot of people came to RIT Undeclared and RIT even acted like this is an option and they act.

496
00:36:54,274 --> 00:36:55,980
Scott: they did act like it was an option.

497
00:36:56,342 --> 00:36:57,247
Rym: It's not an option.

498
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,540
Rym: It's not so you show up, and you start taking class.

499
00:36:59,620 --> 00:36:59,841
Rym: It was

500
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:01,428
Scott: an option if you want to lose a lot of money

501
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:19,696
Rym: and the thing is at any like major University particularly in tech and science fields if you don't know exactly what you're doing And you don't plan out all the classes you're gonna take pretty much forever from the start The prerequisites and all the things that are gonna get in your way are gonna totally fuck you And you'll be there a lot longer than you expect.

502
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:28,720
Scott: yeah I mean if you go to RIT And you know exactly what you want to do and you stick with it the whole time and you were right that was what you Wanted to do five years, and you'll be okay.

503
00:37:29,242 --> 00:37:33,360
Scott: If you don't know what you want to do you might be there six years minimum probably seven years.

504
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:43,439
Rym: That'll basically cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars because a lot of those you know general non matriculated Whatever class is don't actually count for anything in a lot of majors nope.

505
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:51,060
Scott: So you got to figure out what you want to do in life And then before let's say you figure out what you want to do you decide I'm gonna be this I'm gonna be that.

506
00:37:51,461 --> 00:38:04,282
Scott: Well if you decide you want to be a doctor you have to go to medical school you have to get super good grades You're gonna spend like the next ten years of your life Being in hospitals and doctor schools and all sorts of stuff and you have to get ready and do that because that's the way to Be a doctor.

507
00:38:04,744 --> 00:38:05,827
Scott: if you're gonna be a mechanic.

508
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:13,920
Scott: go to the vocational school in your town learn to be a mechanic Get a job at like a firestone or something and be a mechanic.

509
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:15,171
Scott: You don't need to go to college.

510
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:19,896
Scott: why spend money Going to college getting drunk for five years when you didn't have to do that?

511
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:20,820
Scott: you could have gone right to work.

512
00:38:21,021 --> 00:38:24,040
Rym: Well the reason for that and I think this is probably the crux of the issue.

513
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:26,736
Rym: I've been saying that a lot lately in all our shows like this is the crux.

514
00:38:26,757 --> 00:38:27,320
Rym: This is the base.

515
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,986
Rym: This is the the important part.

516
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:35,958
Rym: yep anyway the crux of the issue is the college particularly University.

517
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:44,927
Rym: I Think the primary thing that I got out of college was not my IT knowledge or my computer knowledge or my PTC knowledge or anything I learned from the classes.

518
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:47,039
Rym: nope it was the college experience.

519
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:59,699
Rym: yep And if you go to a college and you fit like you're in a major and as long as you don't absolutely hate the major It's making your life miserable, but say you get two years into I don't know computer engineering you decide You don't really want to do it as a career.

520
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:04,939
Rym: It's generally not in your best interest to switch majors because then you basically have to start over.

521
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:15,059
Rym: However if you finish the major finish the degree at least you're gonna be able to get a job and more importantly you still get The full college experience, which is the important thing of going to college.

522
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:20,258
Rym: You'll learn a lot more about life and living and friendship and all that you know stuff.

523
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:22,608
Rym: Then you're gonna learn in your classes.

524
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:25,440
Rym: Yeah, and a lot of you learn stuff in my classes.

525
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:29,439
Scott: I mean some most of the class well some of the class yeah, but now that was worth it.

526
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:40,370
Rym: You know and if I didn't learn that it would have been sort of a waste to go and spend all that money like I'll Say this the things I did in the RIT anime club have affected my life a lot more than any class I took at RIT.

527
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:41,017
Scott: That's for sure.

528
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,355
Scott: So so you have to you know before you go to college.

529
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:45,938
Scott: you have to.

530
00:39:46,038 --> 00:39:46,259
Scott: you know.

531
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:50,700
Scott: It seems like a lot of people just go to college by default like they don't even think about it like after high school.

532
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,347
Scott: you Go to college.

533
00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:52,480
Scott: It's like grade 13.

534
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,395
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of the same thing that costs a lot of people like all right.

535
00:39:55,415 --> 00:39:57,889
Rym: I'm out of college get a job All right, I got a job time to get married.

536
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:58,151
Rym: all right.

537
00:39:58,171 --> 00:39:58,493
Rym: I'm married.

538
00:39:58,534 --> 00:39:59,540
Rym: gotta have kids all right.

539
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:06,409
Scott: Got to send the kids to college got a diner to retirement home after you graduate high school And you're 18 at least in the United States.

540
00:40:06,891 --> 00:40:09,200
Scott: You are now free to do as you please.

541
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,856
Scott: I mean if you want certain things you're going to have to do certain things to get those.

542
00:40:13,897 --> 00:40:16,419
Scott: like if you want to have a House you're going to need a job and money.

543
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:22,499
Scott: Which means you if you want to you know a certain kind of house in a certain place you might need a higher paying job And thus you might need college.

544
00:40:23,062 --> 00:40:26,837
Scott: But you have to figure out what you want and then figure out how to get it.

545
00:40:26,897 --> 00:40:32,820
Scott: and don't go Doing a college thing Unless you decide that's what you really want to do with your life for four years.

546
00:40:32,961 --> 00:40:44,220
Rym: Or if it's something you need to do yeah think about it this way If you're gonna go to college, and you know you're gonna pick a college, and I'll just think to yourself What do I actually want to get out of this and list everything?

547
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:51,640
Rym: I mean it might be degree and the experience of college, and that's fine Because maybe it's spend five years in a fret.

548
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:59,240
Rym: That's fine as long as you realize exactly what you were going to give up And what the opportunity cost is to get what you have decided you want.

549
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:03,560
Scott: Yep, now if you there's also a lot of other options you can consider.

550
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:07,822
Scott: Let's say you decide you really want to go to college and study Literature.

551
00:41:07,902 --> 00:41:14,934
Scott: right because you want to be like I don't know an English teacher or an author or like a book publisher or something like that A librator.

552
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:20,846
Scott: Right well you go to library science for that which is needs a master's degree, but You decide you want to do that.

553
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:21,971
Scott: That's what you really want to do.

554
00:41:21,991 --> 00:41:23,880
Scott: You know you worked in a library in high school.

555
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:24,768
Scott: You're all about the books.

556
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:27,398
Scott: so you go But you don't have a lot of money.

557
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:33,804
Scott: But you really want to get a degree from this really fancy school because that will let you get the job of the fancy library You really want to work at.

558
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:39,706
Scott: you can save a lot of money by going to community college for like two years then Transferring to the real college.

559
00:41:39,726 --> 00:41:42,540
Scott: I know a lot of people who did that and they ended up.

560
00:41:42,781 --> 00:41:44,589
Scott: You know they actually went to a community college.

561
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,680
Scott: They learned a lot there because they found a good one.

562
00:41:47,041 --> 00:42:00,800
Scott: They didn't spend much money there because it's super cheap they and in the end they basically got the degree from the better school, but only having to go for the bet to the better school for two or three years or two and a half years and They paid like half price.

563
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:02,486
Scott: It's like discount degree.

564
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:10,987
Rym: another way to go about this is now there's something else in some other places But in most of the United States, there's something called Advanced placement classes in high school.

565
00:42:11,087 --> 00:42:28,340
Rym: hmm it is in your best interest to take these classes and then take the AP tests even though They cost money because The vast majority of colleges in the United States will accept these as college credit for a lot of classes And you can basically get the same effect as going to community college in high school.

566
00:42:29,065 --> 00:42:38,340
Rym: I mean I went into RIT with 41 credits taken care of from the Tests that I took in high school and another eight from community college.

567
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:41,814
Scott: Yep, that's one of the only two things that actually matters in high school.

568
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:44,786
Scott: don't listen to anyone who tells you otherwise Yeah, your grades don't matter.

569
00:42:44,806 --> 00:42:47,660
Rym: well on getting like as long as you have a decent G.

570
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,829
Scott: Well the grades matter.

571
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:53,800
Scott: it depends what you want to do again If you want to go to Harvard you need that like 4.0 GPA or something.

572
00:42:54,142 --> 00:42:58,708
Scott: But if you decide that Harvard isn't for you that you not really need to go there You don't want to be like a Harvard lawyer.

573
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:01,224
Rym: if you want to go to RIT at 1.8 It's fine.

574
00:43:01,888 --> 00:43:06,129
Scott: if you just want to go to your state school You can get some C's and stuff in high school.

575
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:09,240
Rym: It depends like in Michigan actually University of Michigan.

576
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:10,791
Rym: It was super fucking hard to get in.

577
00:43:10,831 --> 00:43:12,059
Scott: couldn't you go to Michigan State though?

578
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:13,220
Rym: You could.

579
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:15,686
Rym: Michigan State just is awesome.

580
00:43:15,706 --> 00:43:16,731
Rym: My brother actually went there.

581
00:43:16,751 --> 00:43:17,093
Scott: All right.

582
00:43:17,234 --> 00:43:19,383
Rym: I'm just saying it was you know What actually I would say.

583
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:23,880
Rym: Michigan State was a much more fun campus though U of M was a much more serious business campus.

584
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:25,004
Rym: No, I don't know.

585
00:43:25,064 --> 00:43:25,907
Rym: I prefer the latter.

586
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:33,286
Rym: Anyway, well, you know, let's skip all it cuz that's actually a really important thing Even if you know you think all right I want to be a whatever.

587
00:43:33,346 --> 00:43:37,704
Rym: so I've got to go to Yale because Yale is the best school for that It does.

588
00:43:37,926 --> 00:43:44,800
Rym: if a school is good if good enough for something Then you don't need to worry about it because if you want to go to like the best school in the field.

589
00:43:44,962 --> 00:43:54,219
Rym: That's a whole different ballgame but Much more important than going to the good school in your major is going to a school that you're going to be able to live At and joy and prosper in for four or five years.

590
00:43:54,534 --> 00:44:04,659
Scott: Yeah If you end up like a lot of people Transfer from schools because they can't hack it like people who transfer out of RIT not because they want to leave but because they can't Deal with it or they get there and they don't like it.

591
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,186
Scott: That is not good.

592
00:44:06,266 --> 00:44:09,439
Scott: going from community college to real college because that was your plan is good.

593
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,860
Scott: Transferring between colleges because you got there and you didn't like it is bad.

594
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,865
Scott: That was poor planning.

595
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:16,819
Scott: It cost you a lot of money and it cost you a lot of time.

596
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:18,008
Rym: now We've got a case in point.

597
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:28,039
Rym: a lot of people, you know They want to be an IT major because they find out oh, yeah IT there's a lot of money in that and they don't have to code so much which is kind of a lie, but Alright, so I want to go to IT.

598
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:34,220
Rym: Oh, well the best IT school in the country nay the world is probably the Rochester Institute of Technology.

599
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,146
Rym: I should obviously go there.

600
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:44,840
Rym: That is when you want to stop and think about it because okay It's a great IT school, but there are other IT schools and every college campus is totally different.

601
00:44:45,506 --> 00:44:50,734
Rym: Even if you want to be an IT major RIT might not be the one of play the place you want to live.

602
00:44:50,935 --> 00:44:52,260
Rym: You might not enjoy RIT.

603
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:57,400
Rym: A lot of people don't like living at RIT and freak out and have to leave.

604
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,798
Scott: there are a lot of things that are different at a lot of schools that you know aren't obvious.

605
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:06,160
Scott: and Remember when you go to a school and the people there, you know, even the students, right?

606
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,988
Scott: They're trying to sell you the school.

607
00:45:09,048 --> 00:45:12,540
Scott: don't think that you're going to look to buy a school and they're just you know.

608
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,403
Scott: Being all honest.

609
00:45:13,724 --> 00:45:14,688
Scott: They have a school.

610
00:45:14,948 --> 00:45:17,016
Scott: you're going to pay them a zillion dollars if you go there.

611
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:18,160
Scott: They are salesmen.

612
00:45:18,441 --> 00:45:21,820
Scott: They are going to only tell you the good things and they're not going to tell you the bad things.

613
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:25,274
Rym: Yeah, if you show up at RIT for those parents weekends, like check it out.

614
00:45:25,294 --> 00:45:26,157
Rym: Your kids should come here.

615
00:45:26,198 --> 00:45:27,472
Rym: Check it out kids You should come here.

616
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:34,093
Rym: RIT Redoes the landscaping right before the parents come like they put in landscaping.

617
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:36,140
Rym: the campus looks beautiful for like two weeks.

618
00:45:37,043 --> 00:45:47,840
Rym: And then after the parents leave and you've committed and you've paid money and you're now at the school That landscaping all disappears and then the snows come and the snows don't stop and you're trapped.

619
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:49,428
Scott: This isn't just RIT there.

620
00:45:49,448 --> 00:45:50,554
Scott: We're not picking on RIT.

621
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:55,051
Scott: every example Every school has hidden secrets like that.

622
00:45:55,192 --> 00:45:59,468
Scott: things that you know, they might you know, tell you about them But they'll make them seem like good things.

623
00:45:59,508 --> 00:46:12,100
Scott: like they'll say RIT has this great quarter system But if you can't hack dealing with an entire class in ten weeks, you know and doing three freaking quarters a year They're calm quarters because the summer quarter.

624
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:19,809
Scott: But if you can't deal with three ten week periods of taking classes a year and a lot less Vacation than other schools that have semester systems.

625
00:46:20,392 --> 00:46:22,440
Scott: You're going to bomb at RIT.

626
00:46:22,601 --> 00:46:24,098
Scott: It'll be very unpleasant for you.

627
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:31,080
Rym: And also this campus does not look the way it normally does when you visited for some sort of orientation or pre weekend or whatever.

628
00:46:31,642 --> 00:46:36,160
Rym: So whenever you're thinking about a college very simply go to whatever event they you know.

629
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,460
Rym: Say like oh come and see the college on this day because they get a lot of information.

630
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:47,260
Rym: Go back to the college sometime in the middle of a quarter or semester like go midterms and go unannounced.

631
00:46:47,361 --> 00:46:53,920
Scott: Don't be like going to the admissions office being all like, you know, yeah I want to come for a tour and then they'll have someone guide you around.

632
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:58,340
Scott: No Just go to the school and just show up and we'll look around while people are taking.

633
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:08,360
Scott: Hang out in the quads go to the library go to the gym go to the coffee shop walk through Go anywhere that non students, you know can get around to without being suspicious.

634
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:13,140
Rym: So in the end, I mean we could go on about this forever and we're probably gonna do a lot more shows about.

635
00:47:13,261 --> 00:47:22,391
Rym: You know things like how to actually show up at college because you know a lot of people show up with like a UPS you Gigantic truck just full of crap that won't fit in the room.

636
00:47:22,451 --> 00:47:25,926
Scott: and some people show up and then over the years they get rid Of all the crap they realize.

637
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:28,260
Rym: but then some people show up like without bedsheets.

638
00:47:29,982 --> 00:47:33,114
Rym: Well, we can.

639
00:47:33,195 --> 00:47:34,560
Rym: that'll be an episode in of itself.

640
00:47:34,641 --> 00:47:36,298
Rym: But the moral of this one is pretty simple.

641
00:47:36,861 --> 00:47:38,205
Rym: Don't trust what anyone tells.

642
00:47:38,265 --> 00:47:45,829
Scott: you do your own research and do a lot of research into everything the school the major What you want to do with your life, etc.

643
00:47:46,391 --> 00:47:51,670
Scott: Don't don't like don't leave any stone Unturned don't do what Donny don't does.

644
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,620
Scott: and also it's good to know what you want to do.

645
00:47:54,741 --> 00:47:59,719
Scott: And you know, if you're having a hard time knowing what you want to do Well think about what you do all day if you just click on dig all day.

646
00:48:00,222 --> 00:48:04,036
Scott: Maybe you want to be like an internet sort of advertising bloggy person.

647
00:48:04,056 --> 00:48:05,240
Scott: Yeah, you can try to do that.

648
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:06,264
Rym: I cried her it.

649
00:48:06,505 --> 00:48:08,031
Rym: you don't have to go to college right away.

650
00:48:08,091 --> 00:48:10,200
Rym: It's totally okay to go to college a year later.

651
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:13,022
Scott: So Leo gay to college and you're like 30.

652
00:48:13,022 --> 00:48:15,251
Rym: It's totally okay to just work in game.

653
00:48:15,271 --> 00:48:17,240
Rym: stop the rest of your life so you can play your video game.

654
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,380
Scott: You can eventually be like a Gamestop regional manager pretty easily stuck with it.

655
00:48:21,801 --> 00:48:26,919
Rym: I mean if you do what you want or do what thou wilt and know how to do it.
