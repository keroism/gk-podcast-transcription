00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,059
Rym: It's Monday April 30th.

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:12,801
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:17,174
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights Tonight.

4
00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:18,402
Rym: we talk about all those 802 11 AB G's.

5
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:23,046
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:29,050
Rym: Well I'm back after an awesome weekend in Rochester going to Tara Khan.

7
00:00:29,673 --> 00:00:37,790
Scott: I didn't go because I didn't want to drive 10 hours for a one-day con And I think I went out on that deal because I did a lot of cool stuff here.

8
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,063
Rym: Yeah, but you know what I did a lot of cool stuff there.

9
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:41,130
Rym: I also got to go to millennium.

10
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:42,099
Rym: I got to buy.

11
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:46,150
Scott: so that's the only cool thing I didn't do but I did play a bunch of board games, so I'm all right.

12
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:48,050
Rym: I also got to meet some people from the forums.

13
00:00:48,392 --> 00:00:56,430
Rym: I'll talk more about all that on Wednesday when it's more relevant But everyone who met me at the con you guys were all awesome, and I had a good time all right.

14
00:00:56,854 --> 00:01:01,881
Rym: But and more relevant Rym news I've been trying to build my new computers.

15
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:08,473
Rym: I've been talking about a lot for a while and It's starting to prove more and more Problematic.

16
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,447
Rym: it seems like this time around as opposed to the last times.

17
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:13,430
Rym: I've built computers.

18
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:19,790
Rym: It's ever increasingly difficult to figure out if something is actually supported by Linux or not.

19
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:22,707
Scott: Yeah, I I don't know.

20
00:01:22,727 --> 00:01:27,564
Scott: man It's like any news stuff like if it's a new chip on a motherboard.

21
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:36,850
Scott: You know like they'll support the XP QRS Tu V 99 chip and then all of a sudden no motherboards will use that chip anymore.

22
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,170
Scott: They'll start using the XP something something a hundred and eleven chip.

23
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,995
Rym: But the 111 isn't supported.

24
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:48,910
Rym: unless you use this weird kernel patch or you use some development kernel that no one actually uses Or it's not supported at all.

25
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,710
Scott: You just wait for someone to write a kernel driver for it or you got to do something really funky.

26
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,958
Rym: I've had to do that more than one.

27
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:59,409
Scott: by the time they write the kernel driver There'll be another motherboard available that you could buy that instead.

28
00:01:59,972 --> 00:02:06,743
Rym: Yeah, so I'm still not sure what I'm gonna do because Every single motherboard I have decided all right.

29
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:08,389
Rym: This is a good motherboard.

30
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:18,106
Rym: I search on various forums mostly the Gentoo and Ubuntu forums and Without fail a bunch of people tell me all the things that don't work on the motherboard in Linux.

31
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:19,270
Scott: Just use Windows.

32
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:36,916
Rym: Yeah You know if I was a super gamer and I plan to primarily PC game and not primarily podcast I probably would just run Windows But it's honestly much better and much faster and much more reliable all told to use Linux for podcasting Just the way we do it.

33
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,109
Rym: and considering that we do four shows a week I think I found the most efficient way to get the shows up.

34
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:48,330
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, you don't need every single part of the computer to work perfectly to be able to podcast.

35
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:50,755
Scott: Yeah But the things that don't work I sound card.

36
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:56,690
Rym: the things that don't work are the onboard ethernets usually and the onboard serial ATA controller.

37
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:58,861
Rym: Yeah, that's annoying.

38
00:02:59,022 --> 00:03:06,670
Scott: the hard drives See throughout my Linux using years, you know, it's like the technology was always ahead of Linux, right?

39
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,914
Scott: So you would get like.

40
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,990
Scott: I had a Pentium 3450 and I had to use newer and newer versions of Linux.

41
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:18,950
Scott: I would switch distributions just because this distribution came with newer packages and therefore supported more of my hardware.

42
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:23,730
Scott: And then when I bought a new computer, I had to go again to the bleeding edge of Linux.

43
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,771
Scott: I couldn't just use Mandrake anymore had to use Gentoo because that was the most bleeding edge Linux that supported all the hardware I Had.

44
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:34,832
Scott: and then eventually, you know the bleeding edge of Linux got ahead of the hardware I had.

45
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:42,009
Scott: so I was able to use Ubuntu or some other distribution and all my hardware was still supported I didn't need to use the bleeding edge anymore.

46
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:53,716
Scott: but if I buy new hardware again all of a sudden my hardware will be ahead of Linux and I'll have to go back to the bleeding edge and use Gentoo or something in order to get all of it to work or as Much of it to work as possible.

47
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:56,066
Rym: I really don't want to use Gentoo again every time.

48
00:03:56,106 --> 00:04:04,510
Rym: I think yeah It is faster and I learn a lot and then I remember oh, yeah It's a giant pain in the ass and every time I do a major system update something breaks.

49
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:08,523
Scott: Yeah, the thing with Gentoo Linux is it's sort of like it doesn't work.

50
00:04:08,563 --> 00:04:10,210
Rym: Well, it does the thing with Gentoo Linux.

51
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:11,475
Scott: No, it works great.

52
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,250
Scott: Yeah, the thing about Gentoo Linux is a high effort high maintenance system.

53
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,370
Scott: You basically have to you know build this whole thing up.

54
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:27,270
Scott: It could take you a few days Even if you know what you're doing, if you don't know what you're doing You're just gonna fuck it up and in the end you get a really great product if you do it properly.

55
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,236
Scott: But it takes a lot of work.

56
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:34,089
Scott: Ubuntu takes no work and is almost as good but isn't as bleeding edge.

57
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:35,973
Scott: and Yeah, it's slower.

58
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:39,144
Rym: Well, see I only fucked up Gentoo once the very first time.

59
00:04:39,184 --> 00:04:40,890
Rym: I didn't do my network stuff, right?

60
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:47,308
Rym: So when I rebooted into my new kernel and all my new stuff I couldn't get on the network and I'd mess the kernel up and I just started over.

61
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,710
Scott: Yeah See I only messed up Gentoo.

62
00:04:50,091 --> 00:05:01,490
Scott: I messed it up a lot more than once but that's because I the first times I tried I was such a nub That like I would finish the install and little did I know that I had finished the install properly But there was no GUI.

63
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:06,630
Scott: So I thought I had not finished the install and I did it like three times perfectly fine.

64
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,217
Rym: Like why isn't there a mouse?

65
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:10,970
Scott: what's going on until eventually I learned something?

66
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,387
Rym: Yeah, and then you learned the other thing which is that it takes about forever to compile X.

67
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,119
Scott: Yes However, I imagine with the core to duo.

68
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:23,903
Scott: you see the amount of processor time It is taken to compile X has not increased.

69
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,590
Scott: X hasn't gotten that much more complex.

70
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:30,330
Scott: The compiler has only gotten more efficient and the chips have gotten a lot faster.

71
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:32,588
Scott: I imagine building Gentoo on a core to duo.

72
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:39,110
Rym: It might only take a day as long as the thing you're building it on fully is using your core to duo.

73
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:43,030
Scott: Well, that's why you have to change the options in the make.com to use the both cores.

74
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,688
Rym: No, I mean I'm seeing a lot of reports of people and I'm trying I'm still debating which motherboard to get where.

75
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:53,530
Rym: when they use The core twos they get seriously degraded performance in Linux depending.

76
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,750
Rym: It seems to be a motherboard issue and a chipset issue and not a chip issue.

77
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,581
Scott: Yeah, I can tell you that the Dell I have at work.

78
00:05:59,782 --> 00:06:01,610
Scott: The core to duo is in full effect.

79
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,356
Scott: It's totally rocks the house.

80
00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:05,242
Rym: Have you verified that with benchmarks?

81
00:06:05,302 --> 00:06:06,286
Rym: Are you just going based on?

82
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:07,189
Rym: it seems fast to me?

83
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:13,616
Scott: It's the fastest computer I've ever used in my life by a lot and I can look at the CPU Percentage meter and it's.

84
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:15,444
Scott: I can never even see a speck on it.

85
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:16,810
Scott: and when I'm doing crazy stuff.

86
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:18,898
Rym: And what have you done on this go crazy stuff?

87
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:21,870
Scott: Have you done like watching three youtubes while playing a flash game?

88
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,025
Rym: That's not so much and playing an mp3?

89
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:26,176
Rym: Jameson can pretty much do that.

90
00:06:26,617 --> 00:06:29,347
Scott: Yeah, my computer has a little hard time doing that.

91
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:30,090
Rym: Really?

92
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,453
Scott: Yeah, huh?

93
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:33,844
Scott: Mostly cuz my computer only has 512 megs of RAM.

94
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:38,948
Scott: Ah God even the computer laptop has a gig of RAM right here.

95
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:46,690
Rym: Did the computer the busted ass computer where the only moving part that still functions other than the hard drive is the barely spinning?

96
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,243
Rym: CPU fan has a gig and a half around it.

97
00:06:49,484 --> 00:06:53,204
Rym: I know I know Granted, I think some of that RAM stopped working a while ago.

98
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:53,446
Rym: Yeah.

99
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:56,118
Scott: Well Rym You'll be the guinea pig for the new computer.

100
00:06:56,138 --> 00:06:56,981
Scott: I will and I will.

101
00:06:57,102 --> 00:06:59,190
Scott: I will not buy anything you buy that sucks.

102
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:05,149
Rym: Yeah, I hate to say it but I think I'm just gonna bite the bullet and buy the Motherboard that I want based on how good the motherboard is.

103
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:10,890
Rym: I just got to decide if I'm gonna go with n-force which is expensive or the Intel which is better.

104
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,404
Rym: But I don't know how well it'll work in Linux and I think I'll just bite the bullet.

105
00:07:14,425 --> 00:07:15,750
Rym: in worst case Linux doesn't work.

106
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:23,570
Rym: So well, I'll run Windows until the Linux kernel catches up and I'll be stuck using Crapass audacity instead of awesome ReSound.

107
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:30,290
Scott: I think you'll be able to get Linux to work well enough to record an mp3 and use open a web browser.

108
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:35,490
Rym: The problem is if I'm gonna have to buy another network card just for Linux.

109
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:43,290
Scott: I don't think so because none of these motherboards everything If you get the n-force and the motherboard is actually using the n-force for the network card.

110
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:50,749
Scott: Then the network card will work and if you get a PCI sound card Which you were planning on doing anyway, or an external sound card or something then?

111
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,970
Rym: I'm assuming the onboard sound won't work because almost none of them work properly.

112
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,944
Scott: I mean the thing is the n-force ones work.

113
00:07:57,005 --> 00:08:02,770
Rym: I got one that works Yeah, but there's a lot of issues with them because some of the drivers and windows let you set parameters.

114
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:04,289
Rym: They're not easy to set in Linux.

115
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:23,730
Scott: This is why I learned the lesson long ago that if you want Anything in Linux in terms of sound other than just playing stereo sound out of one hole Just use the optical out and get some speakers that do the rest for you because the computer your Linux is not going to be Able to get the sound card to do all the surround sound shit.

116
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:34,065
Scott: You just want Linux to send the audio out and have your speakers or your receiver or some sort of External hardware amplifier to take care of everything because Linux isn't gonna do it.

117
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:35,350
Scott: It's just not gonna happen.

118
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:39,750
Rym: I think I'm just gonna bite the bullet buy a motherboard and I might be stuck running.

119
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:49,119
Rym: The thing is if I get stuck running Windows You can bet that I'm probably gonna spend a few weeks trying to compile resound in Windows Which would be a great success for the world.

120
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,329
Scott: Yeah, I think also, you know.

121
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,050
Rym: Also if anyone out there successfully compiles resound for Windows I will pay you a small song.

122
00:08:56,111 --> 00:09:00,436
Scott: I think if I do it in some sigma in action We'll see about or some VMware.

123
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:02,082
Rym: Yeah, I could do the VMware.

124
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:04,550
Rym: Yeah, but God maybe I'll do that.

125
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,079
Rym: I'll just run Windows and have an Ubuntu in a VMware.

126
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,830
Scott: The thing is we have legitimate copies of Windows XP.

127
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,709
Scott: I don't know if it's worth it to buy Vista upgrades at least not yet that I say.

128
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,757
Rym: no My reason is no.

129
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:25,410
Rym: game really takes advantage of DirectX 10. yet To DirectX 10. video cards are very expensive and not that much faster.

130
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:33,289
Rym: Yep, eventually games will take advantage of it and by then DirectX 10 will be cheaper card wise and by then I might as well just get Vista.

131
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:42,379
Scott: Yeah I think the point at which I'm gonna buy Vista is where like the moons have to align in such a way that a I'm Playing a lot of PC games which I can see.

132
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,446
Rym: I'm really feeling the PC game and coming back.

133
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:48,454
Scott: Yep be Not only The.

134
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:59,930
Scott: are there a lot of games that I'm playing that want the DirectX 10 But a lot of games that I want to play or I'm playing have to do pretty poorly in DirectX 9 in order for me to switch up.

135
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:08,325
Scott: I mean if the games you know would do better in DirectX 10 But are still perfectly playable with XP and DirectX 9 card, then I don't I'm not.

136
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:09,950
Scott: why bother I'm playing.

137
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:11,339
Scott: What do I care though?

138
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,930
Rym: I will say before we go on to the news.

139
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,834
Rym: I'll be quick on my news.

140
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:24,969
Rym: but a few tips for anyone out there who's thinking about building a computer now that we're at the kind of the Awesome plateau of super fast computers for relatively little money Which is gonna end around December when pen rid and all that starts coming out.

141
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:32,310
Rym: But one a lot of people buy RAM that has low cast latency and low refresh timing and things like that.

142
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:34,199
Rym: Now this isn't how fast the RAM is.

143
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,405
Rym: This is this other thing.

144
00:10:35,445 --> 00:10:36,389
Rym: not gonna get into what it is.

145
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:37,949
Rym: I could do a whole show on it.

146
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:49,581
Rym: It's kind of complicated But the thing is if you read the reviews on Newegg or you go to most sites that talk about computers they say Exactly what it is how it works and they say how important it is for performance.

147
00:10:50,223 --> 00:11:02,047
Rym: However, I was looking at benchmarks and Across the board without exception No one has demonstrated any difference in performance be whatsoever.

148
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:08,810
Rym: that was even close to statistically relevant in any difference in cast latency or memory timing.

149
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:09,592
Rym: Uh-huh.

150
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:10,635
Rym: It's total bullshit.

151
00:11:10,997 --> 00:11:12,461
Rym: buy RAM that has high timing.

152
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:13,545
Rym: It'll be a hundred bucks less.

153
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:14,969
Rym: It'll perform exactly the same.

154
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:17,115
Scott: Yeah See I always bought what.

155
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:23,134
Scott: my policy for buying RAM has always been determined how much RAM I want across how many sticks Regardless of anything else.

156
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:28,830
Scott: then find the cheapest RAM that is matches that size and number of sticks.

157
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:30,396
Scott: That is a brand name.

158
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:35,843
Rym: I recognize and trust because but you're forgetting two factors Cast latency and RAM speed.

159
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:36,467
Rym: he's got.

160
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:40,080
Scott: oh, yeah Okay I always pick the RAM speed also in addition to the side.

161
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:45,121
Scott: remember now most motherboards accept multiple speeds of RAM But you pick the highest speed that goes with your processor.

162
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:46,910
Rym: Yeah, and there is a performance difference there.

163
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:53,930
Scott: Yes in most cases if you pick your CPU and your motherboard then by you and you combine those two things It's easy to figure out.

164
00:11:53,972 --> 00:12:01,215
Scott: Oh This is the highest speed RAM I can get and then you get that speed no matter what but back in the day I paid Premium in fact on the computer.

165
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:06,347
Rym: I'm using here the old one for cast latency to ram which was ooh.

166
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:10,660
Rym: But Benchmarks show that there's no reason to care at all.

167
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,350
Rym: so don't listen to anyone who gives you computer advice on new egg.

168
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,270
Rym: They're all jackasses who don't know shit about Pokemon.

169
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:21,770
Scott: Yeah, if anyone knows more about gas latency and wants to dispute this oh go ahead.

170
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:25,170
Rym: I'd like to see you dispute it because I looked at a whole bunch of benchmarks.

171
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:27,236
Scott: I've never actually looked into it.

172
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:36,790
Rym: so because I had to see because the slightly better cast latency RAM was $115 more Wow and it was otherwise identical huh?

173
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:44,969
Scott: The only thing I really worry about with RAM is not how fast it is because you know if it's DDR 800 Is it really gonna get that much faster or whatever?

174
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,582
Scott: What I worry about is if the RAM is gonna go bad or not.

175
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:50,690
Scott: the worst thing is a bad stick of RAM.

176
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:52,902
Scott: I need a perfect stick of RAM that never breaks.

177
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:54,390
Scott: That's my number one worry.

178
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:56,680
Rym: Yeah, but all good RAM comes with a good warranty.

179
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:57,203
Scott: Yep.

180
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:57,625
Scott: That's true.

181
00:12:57,645 --> 00:13:00,210
Scott: I Just hate having to deal with warranties.

182
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:02,518
Rym: It's not so bad with RAM.

183
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:03,163
Rym: It's a tiny thing.

184
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,940
Rym: you ship it back in an envelope Yeah, and while I'm shipping it back.

185
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,710
Scott: I've got not so much RAM.

186
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:11,164
Rym: That's fine cuz I'm buying two gigs to start and I'm probably gonna get more later.

187
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:11,947
Scott: Oh god.

188
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:12,730
Scott: That's a lot of RAM.

189
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:12,877
Scott: Yeah

190
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:19,390
Rym: I want to be able to have the whole show in RAM along with all the Undo iterations and all the filters and all the things I'm running

191
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:20,112
Scott: All

192
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:26,489
Rym: right, plus my youtubes and my things of the day and my gigantic Firefox that always takes up all my RAM on Jameson.

193
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:30,009
Scott: Yeah, just why are they gonna fix that Firefox man?

194
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:33,330
Scott: You got to close it like once a day or else you run out of memory.

195
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:34,746
Rym: See, I don't get that problem anymore.

196
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:36,194
Rym: on Linux I just get the problem of.

197
00:13:36,575 --> 00:13:39,746
Rym: I have like 40 tabs open and they're all.

198
00:13:39,826 --> 00:13:40,950
Rym: they all have long histories.

199
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,090
Rym: Yeah, oh well, but yeah in the news.

200
00:13:44,533 --> 00:14:03,881
Rym: I think I've talked about this topic before but Basically a lot of court cases rely on eyewitness testimony in order to prosecute people and find them guilty and There have been a lot of stories recently pointing out the fact that in many cases Eyewitness testimony is often less reliable than physical evidence.

201
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:07,030
Scott: And I wait it's always a lesser liable than physical evidence.

202
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:24,927
Rym: Well get this there have been exonerations meaning people who were found guilty of a crime For various reasons and then later when they convince people to look at the DNA evidence They discover that it is 100% certain that the person did not commit the crime and that they were in fact innocent.

203
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:32,490
Rym: of these 277 percent were prosecuted and found guilty because of erroneous eyewitness identification.

204
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,036
Rym: Aha quote.

205
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:38,129
Rym: the vagaries of eyewitness identification are well known.

206
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:43,344
Rym: The Supreme Court even held that in in some old case about how quote.

207
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:47,229
Rym: the Annales of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identities.

208
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:59,949
Rym: Yeah, despite this Juries believe eyewitness testimony far more than they'll believe any other evidence including physical evidence DNA evidence Whatever stupid juries what the hell they know.

209
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:10,023
Rym: I can definitely see how that would be because you all remember my jury duty experience where I was basically told that My job was too important for me to ever serve on a jury.

210
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:15,039
Rym: and if my job My job is too important to ever serve on a jury.

211
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:23,470
Rym: I can't imagine what people are serving on juries in New York State people who Think eyewitness testimony is more reliable than physical evidence.

212
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:36,238
Rym: I also don't get the fact that judges and people seem to always Resist when someone's in jail and people are trying to get them to test DNA evidence that was never tested to see if the guy Was innocent, I just think two things.

213
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:43,169
Scott: number one if eyewitness testimony was enough to put someone in jail and how come aren't all these magicians locked up for cutting people in half?

214
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:46,557
Scott: and - That was dumb.

215
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:47,326
Scott: That wasn't dumb.

216
00:15:47,754 --> 00:15:53,806
Scott: Okay Anyway, and - we seem to see a lot of cases lately where DNA evidence is like up we were wrong.

217
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:55,515
Scott: the DNA shows You're wrong up.

218
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:56,019
Scott: We were wrong.

219
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,805
Scott: DNA shows you're wrong.

220
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,538
Scott: I'm not saying this is likely but what if?

221
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:02,589
Scott: what if all these DNA tests we've been doing wrong?

222
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:15,975
Rym: Well, you know, I still to this day very strongly stand by the sentiment that it's better to let one guilty man Well a thousand a million every guilty man go free than to get one innocent, dude Yep I mean if there's a whole jail.

223
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:24,590
Scott: imagine if there's one jail with every criminal in the world and in that jail There's one innocent guy and the only way there was no way to get him out.

224
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,750
Scott: You only had two choices either let everyone stay in the jail or let everyone out of the jail.

225
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:34,933
Scott: I would let everyone out of the jail every time no matter what and then I would start putting the guys back in But that's that's separate.

226
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:35,254
Rym: Luckily.

227
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,443
Rym: They'll probably facilitate the being put back in fairly quickly.

228
00:16:38,724 --> 00:16:43,393
Scott: Yes, because they're all crazy bad guys Alright, so what do you got?

229
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:48,489
Scott: Oh, so speaking of courts and things the Supreme Court is doing stuff.

230
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:51,901
Scott: Oh, really, but this time they're doing good stuff.

231
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:53,166
Scott: It's a it's a miracle.

232
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:54,250
Scott: I know it's it's kind of weird.

233
00:16:55,133 --> 00:17:00,630
Scott: You know how we always complain about how patents are all bullshit and like oh some guy patented a free energy machine.

234
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:04,077
Scott: Some guy patented Adding one and one.

235
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,349
Rym: some guy some guy patented the thing that I just had did.

236
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:11,339
Scott: Yeah, some guy patented something that's already existed for like a hundred years.

237
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:14,829
Scott: Amazon patented buying something with one click, you know stuff like that.

238
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:22,910
Scott: well, the Supreme Court has decided that It is now easier to fight a patent for being obvious.

239
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:34,286
Scott: you see the rules that you had to follow for arguing that a patent was obvious were kind of Rigid and narrow according to the court and they've said, huh?

240
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,877
Scott: we're gonna get rid of that bullshit.

241
00:17:37,298 --> 00:17:37,519
Scott: now.

242
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,889
Scott: if something's obvious, it's obvious.

243
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:53,409
Scott: and It's if you think that someone patented something that is obvious and you're infringing on that patent or have been accused of Infringing on that patent you have a much better chance of winning if their patent really is obvious and stupid.

244
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,350
Rym: now If this really comes to fruition the way it should I hate to say it.

245
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:04,150
Rym: I don't hate to say I'd love to say it but I think that almost every software patent ever will be overturned rapidly.

246
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,190
Rym: Yeah, I think it's just because the programmers they're all obvious.

247
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,283
Rym: It's very rarely to someone write a program and you would look at anything.

248
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:14,270
Rym: Wow, that's amazing.

249
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:15,409
Rym: I never would have thought of that.

250
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:27,389
Scott: Well, what it is is all the real inventions in software out, you know I'll computer algorithms and things are done by like professors and they were done long before Anyone was patenting software.

251
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:33,805
Scott: and When you write software nowadays 90% of the time you're not inventing some new algorithm or anything.

252
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,490
Scott: You're just piecing together.

253
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,410
Scott: You know Solutions to problems that already exist and you can go buy an algorithms book that has all these things like the shortest path algorithm.

254
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:45,882
Scott: You know Dykstra figured it out a long time ago.

255
00:18:45,902 --> 00:18:47,490
Scott: No one patented it.

256
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,474
Scott: He didn't patent it.

257
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:52,730
Scott: and now if you write a program you need to find the shortest path between two things in a graph.

258
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:54,839
Scott: You just implement the algorithm.

259
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,289
Scott: It's it's a doing and not a inventing.

260
00:18:57,731 --> 00:19:06,210
Scott: So if anyone tries to invent that stuff and patent it, sorry It's obvious because you can go to the bookstore buy a book that tells you how to do it.

261
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:12,490
Rym: But if someone like Dykstra existed today and did something like that, there'd be a patent and no one else could use it.

262
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,098
Scott: Yeah, I think that would be actually kind of fair though.

263
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:23,930
Scott: Like if there was no way of determining the shortest path No one knew how to do it efficiently and then someone actually came up with a brand new algorithm.

264
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:27,088
Scott: They did it and they didn't tell anyone and they patented it.

265
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:33,410
Scott: I would have a hard time arguing against that, you know, cuz plus in what like 14 years we can all use it anyway.

266
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:35,258
Scott: So it's not that big a deal.

267
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:38,030
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is how often does that happen?

268
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,644
Rym: I mean look at all the software patents or even a lot of technology patents.

269
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:43,150
Rym: They're obvious.

270
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:44,395
Rym: They're at one click.

271
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:51,619
Rym: you patent the idea of buying something with one click instead of two clicks Yeah, or four clicks the kind of stuff that's patentable.

272
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:57,132
Scott: and technology nowadays is like the design of the core to do a Processor.

273
00:19:57,273 --> 00:19:59,761
Scott: or you know certain aspects of the design that are.

274
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:04,868
Scott: you know new ways of getting more efficient Transistors and less heat and all that.

275
00:20:04,908 --> 00:20:08,604
Rym: Yeah Like if I design a new way of doing an old CMOS chip where it doesn't use.

276
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:10,732
Rym: it uses half as much power and is Fast.

277
00:20:11,153 --> 00:20:17,852
Rym: that's a lot different from I don't know clicking on something once and then writing a bunch of legalese around that Yeah.

278
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,718
Scott: Oh, well, it's good news.

279
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:28,458
Rym: Hooray things of the day.

280
00:20:29,554 --> 00:20:33,953
Scott: All right I was in the mood to see some funniness and I found me some college pranks.

281
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:38,259
Scott: now when I was in college It was something that would happen every year.

282
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:50,380
Scott: Invariably is that they would drop off a giant stack of phone books like a whole like three or four Pallets of phone books at the dorms and they wouldn't bother handing them out or putting one in every dorm room.

283
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,739
Scott: They would just leave the pallet of phone books sitting there.

284
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:58,520
Rym: Yeah, so you'd go into Gracie's like the big central place where people ate basically garbage every day.

285
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:05,094
Rym: We won't get into all the stories we have about that place But it was like the main common area where everyone every freshman would always meet.

286
00:21:05,114 --> 00:21:06,198
Scott: it was for the freshman.

287
00:21:06,238 --> 00:21:08,860
Rym: It was the common area Yeah, even though there was nothing in that building.

288
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,760
Rym: Yeah, it was just this big empty useless building other than the cafeteria.

289
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:19,480
Scott: But they leave multiple pallets stacked high with phone books like a thousand phone books on a pallet something ridiculous like that.

290
00:21:19,982 --> 00:21:21,974
Scott: And if you wanted a phone book you took one.

291
00:21:21,994 --> 00:21:24,043
Scott: if you didn't want one you didn't take one.

292
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:33,340
Scott: and for the most part people didn't want phone books because we had the Internet's and The phone company didn't seem to realize that no one used phone books anymore.

293
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:36,509
Rym: God, when was the last time I used a phone book for anything?

294
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:44,962
Scott: I actually kind of used the ones around here only because Dumbass local businesses don't put have websites so you had to say it.

295
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:51,765
Rym: but if a local business if I can't if I don't see them when I wander around and They don't have a website.

296
00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:55,700
Rym: I'll probably never find out they exist and I'm not even gonna bother looking for them.

297
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:02,560
Scott: Yeah, I generally what I'll do is if I've seen a place around You know and they don't have a website then I can get their phone number in the yellow pages.

298
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,891
Scott: That's pretty much the only circumstances which I'll use it.

299
00:22:05,072 --> 00:22:06,860
Rym: How often do you really call so a business?

300
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,448
Rym: I mean if I mostly restaurants, that's it.

301
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,136
Rym: Well, we don't even call restaurants only takeout places.

302
00:22:12,617 --> 00:22:13,099
Scott: Yeah, that's it.

303
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,909
Scott: Yeah, that's all I'm talking about man.

304
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:15,774
Rym: I miss RIT.

305
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:22,980
Scott: We just order pizza in a college town Everything has a website because the college town people are smart.

306
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,497
Rym: Yeah, we really got small especially when your college ends.

307
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:30,360
Rym: in IT I mean if we wanted food we could get the menus to every restaurant we cared about online.

308
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:35,292
Scott: I just had a website where we could in a few clicks Someone would be at our door with food.

309
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:39,516
Scott: even it was so good They would have been paid with a credit card, so we wouldn't have to give them anything.

310
00:22:39,636 --> 00:22:40,704
Rym: Yeah, no tip No nothing.

311
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:49,752
Rym: we could even save like Common meals that we were to order like the list of pizzas or the list of pitas or the list of whatever and just hit The button and then it would show up a half hour later.

312
00:22:49,772 --> 00:22:51,200
Rym: There are IRC channels.

313
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,650
Scott: You could type slash pizza and then pizza would show up.

314
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:56,040
Rym: I really miss RIT sometimes.

315
00:22:56,282 --> 00:23:06,519
Scott: oh, yeah, so I was missing that too and Apparently kids at other colleges have a similar situation where they get a bunch of phone books that they don't need.

316
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:11,372
Scott: and What the thing is kids at other colleges were smarter than we were.

317
00:23:11,593 --> 00:23:14,120
Rym: see we spent all of our time gaming.

318
00:23:14,481 --> 00:23:22,740
Rym: In fact, we spent the majority of our waking hours at RIT as a group the front row crew Gaming or watching anime gaming or watching anime mostly gaming.

319
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:38,760
Rym: So as a result while we would often late at night after we'd finished gaming and watching anime before we all went to bed So that we could get up early and skip class to play more games Yep, we would often talk about how we should pull a prank when we came up with some pretty grand pranks.

320
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:45,560
Rym: But the thing is we never implemented or even thought about actually implementing a single one of them because we didn't have time.

321
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,899
Scott: No, it wasn't because you didn't have time is because it was so much easier to just sit there and play a game.

322
00:23:51,623 --> 00:23:53,913
Scott: It was fun enough that we didn't need to go pull a prank.

323
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:57,964
Scott: if we did if we would have ran out of games to Play I'm sure pranks would have been imminent.

324
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:05,999
Rym: and the thing is most of the pranks that happen on RIT because pretty much everyone else on Campus was either a lot like us or they were frat people who drank all the time.

325
00:24:06,462 --> 00:24:10,260
Rym: So as a result, the pranks were always lame and or non-existent.

326
00:24:10,702 --> 00:24:13,755
Scott: Yeah, all righty is certainly no MIT when it comes to pranks granted.

327
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:14,478
Rym: I'm still proud.

328
00:24:14,498 --> 00:24:20,620
Rym: the one prank I wish I could have pulled off Giant clock tower on campus and you can see the clock all the way down the quarter mile.

329
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,859
Rym: There's a big thing the sundial know the actual clock not the sundial.

330
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:27,373
Scott: Oh the Ellington not the Ellington clock the.

331
00:24:27,493 --> 00:24:29,099
Rym: I already forget the names of all the dorms.

332
00:24:29,722 --> 00:24:30,787
Scott: I forget the name of the building.

333
00:24:30,827 --> 00:24:33,560
Scott: But yes that building the a building a giant dorm, right?

334
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:40,280
Rym: Yeah, there's a big clock on it and it was white hands with white little pips and then it was the RIT red brick background.

335
00:24:40,863 --> 00:24:49,079
Rym: I wanted to get up there because it wasn't hard to get up there and Paint the end of the minute hand so that it disappeared and there were just two hour hands.

336
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:53,550
Rym: That was my genius prank that I obviously never pulled off.

337
00:24:53,711 --> 00:25:02,840
Rym: obviously meanwhile the frat boys in their infinite wisdom I think the best prank they ever pulled off was they took a condom and they put it on top of the sundial.

338
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:05,328
Scott: Yeah, I think that was there before when I got to RIT.

339
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:06,211
Rym: I got refreshed.

340
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:06,934
Scott: I was there.

341
00:25:07,275 --> 00:25:12,851
Rym: really there were like five Condom ends around the bottom Tradition.

342
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:18,800
Scott: like you know Everyone has to put a condom on the sundial and if it blows away or gets taken off someone else's to replace it.

343
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,205
Rym: But you got to admit that's pretty sad.

344
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:22,413
Rym: That's barely even a press not even a prank.

345
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:23,015
Rym: That's nothing.

346
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:24,240
Scott: That's just it's basically nothing.

347
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,276
Scott: Yeah, so these guys I guess one of these is at Tufts, right?

348
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:29,080
Scott: These guys are Tufts.

349
00:25:29,844 --> 00:25:32,800
Scott: They got these phone books and they said hey, what do we do with these phone books?

350
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,382
Scott: I don't know.

351
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:43,092
Scott: and then one of their friends went away on a ski trip and he left his door Unlocked.

352
00:25:43,112 --> 00:25:46,402
Scott: that's an invitation for some guys in white sheets to come along.

353
00:25:46,883 --> 00:25:47,826
Rym: That's all I'm saying.

354
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:48,990
Rym: Oh the white sheets.

355
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:50,508
Rym: I forgot about ghosting.

356
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:53,276
Rym: There was one good prank at RIT.

357
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:56,826
Rym: Yeah, there was in fact now that I think about it.

358
00:25:56,866 --> 00:25:58,070
Rym: That's one of my favorite pranks.

359
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,380
Scott: Hey, we got to get a video of that.

360
00:26:00,782 --> 00:26:01,767
Rym: I don't know if there are any.

361
00:26:01,787 --> 00:26:02,189
Rym: I don't know.

362
00:26:02,912 --> 00:26:04,721
Rym: That might just be an RIT prank.

363
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:05,364
Scott: It might be.

364
00:26:05,404 --> 00:26:06,730
Rym: I totally forgot about that.

365
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:19,139
Scott: So these guys took these phone books and they went into their friend's room because he was away for the weekend skiing and they developed techniques for Tearing pages at a phone books at a rapid pace.

366
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:22,310
Rym: see this is brilliant because Scott had watched the video and he makes me watch.

367
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:22,431
Rym: It's.

368
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:24,830
Rym: I'm sitting there watching and I see they've got these phone books.

369
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,510
Rym: They're starting to like put them up on the walls hanging from the ceiling like pages.

370
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,930
Rym: They've ripped out and I get the impression they're gonna try to fill the room or something.

371
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:40,150
Rym: So I say to Scott so I says to him man if that was us We'd obviously have to come up with some sort of advanced technique to rip the phone pages.

372
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,420
Rym: And I say I say hold on hold on.

373
00:26:42,943 --> 00:26:48,370
Rym: and then the guy explains the technique They came up with after some trial and error to rip the pages out and it was a really good method.

374
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:59,868
Scott: Yeah They had a high quality technique for tearing lots and lots of pages out of the phone book Individually one at a time and they filled this kid's room above the waist level with phone book pages.

375
00:27:00,249 --> 00:27:01,648
Rym: now Think about that.

376
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:08,090
Scott: It's like 60 phone books each individual page torn out filling your entire dorm room.

377
00:27:08,692 --> 00:27:17,115
Rym: I kind of feel for the kid when he shows up cuz he opens the door and he's just like We think of that.

378
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,742
Rym: you spent a whole weekend skiing.

379
00:27:18,943 --> 00:27:21,716
Rym: you're tired you get back home You just want to go to bed.

380
00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:23,145
Rym: You got class the next day.

381
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:23,990
Rym: You probably got some homework.

382
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,636
Rym: You didn't finish.

383
00:27:24,938 --> 00:27:26,330
Rym: all you want to do is go to sleep.

384
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:29,324
Rym: Maybe play some counter-strike and masturbate.

385
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:31,456
Scott: No, I didn't want to play counter-strike I don't want to play Pokemon.

386
00:27:31,496 --> 00:27:31,919
Scott: at this point.

387
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:33,650
Scott: at the most it's gonna be Tetris in bed.

388
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:37,844
Rym: See if I were this guy in bed I would have just gone into the room and gone to sleep in the paper.

389
00:27:37,884 --> 00:27:38,990
Rym: That might have been really comfortable.

390
00:27:39,111 --> 00:27:40,457
Scott: That's what I would have done as well.

391
00:27:40,497 --> 00:27:43,872
Rym: And then the next day I would have killed every single person I knew.

392
00:27:43,932 --> 00:27:51,928
Scott: now the next day I would have just waited for the time to be right and moved all the paper into someone else's and Then locked my door.

393
00:27:53,102 --> 00:27:53,350
Scott: All right.

394
00:27:54,192 --> 00:28:01,530
Rym: So in the spirit of that it's just so happens that linked along in the related videos was yet another phone book prank.

395
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:03,830
Rym: Now this one was at some engineering school.

396
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,523
Scott: It was at VCU

397
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:25,990
Rym: and these were obviously some engineering students because they went the extra mile and they went about this in such a Methodical and precise way and they put such thought into it that while it's a pretty mean prank at the same time I would have paid a decent amount of money to see the aftermath of the prank, which unfortunately the video does not provide.

398
00:28:26,383 --> 00:28:37,561
Rym: Yeah Basically, they took the phone books and they put them together into like big Tetris block kind of things and they made segments that when put Together form a fairly thick wall wrapped in saran wrap.

399
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:40,489
Scott: So they made basically a wall of phone book.

400
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:41,797
Scott: Yes All right, what'd they do with it?

401
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:45,548
Rym: And it was in segments now also inside of.

402
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,350
Rym: One side of these segments was horrible pornography.

403
00:28:49,992 --> 00:28:56,938
Scott: I see you make a wall with porn on one side so you can you hide on the side without porn and then the other side Has porn and that's what the people you're pranking are.

404
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:58,584
Rym: So some kids in his dorm room.

405
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:09,650
Rym: Uh-huh, and they Secretly like obviously they're doing this very quietly They place the segments on the door like in the door frame outside the room and then seal it entirely with duct tape.

406
00:29:10,354 --> 00:29:11,724
Scott: Oh, so he can't get.

407
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:12,530
Scott: he opens his door.

408
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,970
Scott: He's just gonna see porn and a wall that he can't get out of his room.

409
00:29:16,151 --> 00:29:20,990
Rym: Yes a wall that will require a lot of body slamming if that's even going to do it to get out.

410
00:29:21,238 --> 00:29:26,206
Scott: Yeah Basically, they covered the thing with duct tape like a lot of pieces of duct tape from top to bottom.

411
00:29:26,507 --> 00:29:31,627
Scott: from the outside It looked like just a wall of duct tape, but there were actually phone books and then a door.

412
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,657
Rym: now How smart are these kids?

413
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:35,870
Rym: they actually and Scott pointed this out in the video?

414
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:45,770
Rym: They tore the duct tape at the proper lengths ahead of time in another room and walked over with him So you wouldn't have any hearing of the prank being set up from the people inside.

415
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,112
Rym: Yeah, cuz.

416
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:48,322
Scott: I mean if you're inside here rip rip rip.

417
00:29:48,362 --> 00:29:49,889
Scott: It's like who's duct-taping something out there.

418
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:50,452
Scott: Yeah, cuz.

419
00:29:50,512 --> 00:30:03,842
Scott: if he opened that door even once while they were doing this one body slam would have taken that thing off But as soon as they had all the duct tape on it would have taken multiple body slams perhaps perhaps two people kicking Rapidly and strongly man.

420
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:10,050
Rym: I just remember when I was there I maybe even a ram of some sort if I heard the slightest commotion in the hallway.

421
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:28,590
Rym: I've jumped out the door and I remember the one time I opened the door because I heard someone sound like someone's trying to crowbar a door open and sure enough Everyone else on the floor had gotten together and they decided for some reason that this one door that was near my room Had to be where the cable was and they wanted to get themselves free cable.

422
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:32,265
Rym: So they were crowbar and open the door to try to give themselves free cable.

423
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:33,309
Scott: Ah your dorm.

424
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:36,322
Scott: Oh, that's why I stayed in the drug-free dorm God.

425
00:30:36,362 --> 00:30:38,170
Rym: We got to do a show about our different dorms.

426
00:30:38,812 --> 00:30:41,240
Rym: I lived in fish and Scott lived in Peterson.

427
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:42,444
Scott: I lived in the good door.

428
00:30:42,986 --> 00:30:44,050
Rym: I everyone hung out.

429
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:48,319
Rym: I lived in the interesting dorm The interesting door.

430
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:59,308
Rym: Yes the much more entertaining dorm But the much less entertaining dorm to be in so alright in and of itself a good prank But a prank that's been done before with other implements not like a super original prank.

431
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:04,550
Rym: Yep They went one step further and they covered the inside of this wall.

432
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:06,441
Scott: This is the kind of thing I wouldn't have thought of.

433
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:07,890
Scott: we would have thought of the porn.

434
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,363
Scott: I wouldn't have thought of the next step with honey.

435
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:17,909
Rym: Oh Now not only do you have to body slam this thing repeatedly and continually because there's no other way you're gonna get out.

436
00:31:17,969 --> 00:31:21,130
Scott: if you Had a battering ram you'd be alright, but you don't have a battering ram.

437
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:21,612
Rym: I don't know.

438
00:31:21,752 --> 00:31:23,759
Rym: Frank had that didgeridoo a bit.

439
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:25,686
Scott: didgeridoo is not a battering ram.

440
00:31:25,746 --> 00:31:26,710
Scott: I think not even close.

441
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,242
Rym: I think a didgeridoo applied properly might just shatter.

442
00:31:30,282 --> 00:31:31,205
Scott: What's wrong with you?

443
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:32,690
Rym: Didgeridoos are solid wood.

444
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,455
Rym: They don't shatter.

445
00:31:33,495 --> 00:31:34,865
Rym: you can kill a man with the didgeridoo.

446
00:31:34,905 --> 00:31:35,590
Rym: I used to play one.

447
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,338
Scott: Alright you try to didgeridoo open our door.

448
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:42,270
Scott: I'll didgeridoo you and see if the which breaks first our front door.

449
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:51,168
Scott: I can't really do it with my hands But a battering ram is big and usually requires at least two people to operate.

450
00:31:51,489 --> 00:32:12,230
Rym: now I have a hunch cuz I. lately I've been watching a lot of pranks on YouTube and so is Scott and A lot of other things are appearing on YouTube that used to be isolated incidents in the world And I think that we're seeing the beginning of kind of a standalone cyclical self-fulfilling prophecy feedback loop kind of situation where YouTube exists.

451
00:32:12,954 --> 00:32:15,410
Rym: People do things to try to appear on YouTube.

452
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:21,110
Rym: People see these things get ideas and try to do more elaborate things in order to appear on YouTube.

453
00:32:21,912 --> 00:32:32,219
Rym: I think that prank technology is going to increase at a startling rate until eventually we're going to have the prank cold war Either that or like a prank arms race.

454
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:35,730
Scott: either that or pranks are just as prevalent as they have always been.

455
00:32:36,111 --> 00:32:41,989
Scott: But now since more people can be aware of them you it feels like there are more pranks than they used to be.

456
00:32:42,431 --> 00:32:45,010
Rym: See, but at the same time I mean how many people?

457
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,641
Rym: Reinvented the wheel over and over again coming up with pranks.

458
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:51,190
Rym: how many pranks exist only at one?

459
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,745
Rym: University because it's passed down from year to year.

460
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:55,693
Rym: now We're seeing all of that.

461
00:32:55,994 --> 00:33:01,046
Rym: pranks are unifying and I think pranks are going to start becoming very very intricate.

462
00:33:01,508 --> 00:33:08,849
Scott: I can tell you this If anyone needs to know phone book page tearing technique, they will never have to reinvent that ever again.

463
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:13,970
Rym: However now I feel it's my duty at some point to spread ghosting around the world.

464
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:16,041
Scott: Are you gonna tell people what ghosting is?

465
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:17,047
Scott: you're gonna let him hang?

466
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:25,686
Rym: I'm gonna let him hang partly because if anyone else out there who didn't go to RIT Knows what ghosting is and it is a dorm room prank.

467
00:33:25,706 --> 00:33:26,450
Rym: I'll give you that hint.

468
00:33:26,915 --> 00:33:33,378
Rym: I'm not gonna give you a prize or anything But then I'll know that at least someone else invented it Independently of whoever came up with it at RIT.

469
00:33:33,518 --> 00:33:36,226
Scott: and it does involve white sheets, which we talked about.

470
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:36,788
Rym: of course.

471
00:33:36,868 --> 00:33:38,117
Rym: ghosting Yes, boo boo.

472
00:33:40,691 --> 00:33:41,856
Scott: So I'm talking about today.

473
00:33:42,037 --> 00:33:45,350
Rym: Well, we had a bunch of things in the calendar, but it seems like Mondays and Thursdays.

474
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:47,849
Rym: We tend to ignore what's in the calendar and do something else.

475
00:33:48,714 --> 00:33:54,156
Scott: We also have the hardest time filling up the calendar on Monday and Thursday Tuesday and Wednesday.

476
00:33:54,457 --> 00:33:56,445
Scott: the calendar is quite full.

477
00:33:56,747 --> 00:34:02,890
Rym: Oh, yeah I mean cuz we don't watch anime every day and we don't constantly play video games and board games.

478
00:34:03,394 --> 00:34:05,249
Rym: We don't constantly buy board games.

479
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:09,380
Rym: God, we're probably gonna get to Twilight Struggle like next year at this point.

480
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:09,902
Rym: Probably.

481
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:16,686
Rym: All right, so Monday tech day We were gonna talk about CPU architectures, but that is a very dry topic.

482
00:34:17,007 --> 00:34:17,630
Scott: It's real dry.

483
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:28,509
Rym: It's like freaking bone dry and I wasn't sure I mean if you do that in layman's terms It becomes very simply there's x86 and there's power PC.

484
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:30,135
Scott: They're different.

485
00:34:30,516 --> 00:34:31,079
Scott: That's it.

486
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,324
Rym: Oh, Oh alpha.

487
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:37,389
Rym: Oh I can say what risk stands for as opposed to sisk and how it doesn't matter anymore.

488
00:34:37,571 --> 00:34:40,284
Scott: I could talk about pipelining but that might be too complicated.

489
00:34:40,324 --> 00:34:41,310
Rym: It is too complicated.

490
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:54,730
Rym: So we realized a lot of people have been asking about security and internet stuff and you really seem to like our layman series on Various things related to computers and we've wanted to do one on wireless security for a long time.

491
00:34:54,790 --> 00:35:01,735
Scott: In fact, that's been requested several times by different people because it's something a lot of people need to know nowadays And not too many people know.

492
00:35:02,055 --> 00:35:12,182
Rym: however nowadays talking about wireless security in and of itself is kind of difficult without You knowing at least basically how different wireless protocols work.

493
00:35:12,604 --> 00:35:14,890
Rym: So tonight we're kind of gonna do this.

494
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,313
Rym: We're not gonna go into like.

495
00:35:16,654 --> 00:35:23,112
Rym: well 802 11a uses the 5 gigahertz band area while B is the 2.5 gigahertz and all those Things.

496
00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:26,730
Rym: but it's kind of a who's who and what's what in the wireless world?

497
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:37,729
Rym: Mmm, because you know if you hear 802 11a to 211 B Bluetooth Y max and All these Apple Airport things but you don't really know what they do.

498
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:43,498
Rym: At least I know a lot of you don't know what they do or you just know that G's the new one and is the fancy one.

499
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:48,516
Rym: a is the one that was expensive and that might be all you ever heard Or you might not even know that much.

500
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:51,710
Scott: You just might be like guys a bunch of letters and I buy stuff and it works.

501
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,253
Scott: I don't care.

502
00:35:52,273 --> 00:35:54,223
Scott: Yep, or I buy stuff and it doesn't work.

503
00:35:54,344 --> 00:35:54,866
Scott: Why why?

504
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:01,490
Rym: Well, the other thing is that wireless internet is a relatively recent invention.

505
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,575
Scott: It's stupidly new.

506
00:36:02,796 --> 00:36:10,869
Rym: in fact when I when we were at RIT I took a class on wireless networking now 802 11 G didn't even exist.

507
00:36:10,929 --> 00:36:14,049
Rym: yet It was barely a pie-in-the-sky idea.

508
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:19,189
Rym: 802 11 B worked and was okay, but still had not reached its peak.

509
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:21,737
Rym: yet 802 11 a was still used.

510
00:36:22,158 --> 00:36:31,050
Scott: think about in the past, but six or so years we've gone from Wireless being this really you can get the internet without wires.

511
00:36:31,151 --> 00:36:38,390
Scott: You can connect computers together without wires or without Sitting them right next to each other and using infrared and actually get decent bandwidth.

512
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:42,869
Rym: God, if I just remember trying to send shit over infrared like that's insane.

513
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:45,619
Scott: and Now every laptop has it.

514
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:46,804
Scott: if your laptop doesn't have it.

515
00:36:46,844 --> 00:36:50,036
Scott: It's worthless and there's Wireless access everywhere.

516
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:51,020
Rym: every router has it.

517
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:59,369
Rym: In fact, I was driving on the throughway and Interstate 86 over the weekend to get to torque on and almost every rest stop had Wi-Fi.

518
00:36:59,912 --> 00:37:00,598
Scott: That's pretty cool.

519
00:37:00,638 --> 00:37:02,030
Rym: In fact, you know those blue sign?

520
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:08,370
Rym: Well in America, there's big blue signs on any major interstate that says what's at this exit or what's at this rest stop.

521
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:12,747
Rym: So, you know exactly where you can get gas where you can sleep or you can get a prostitute all those things.

522
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:16,902
Rym: Yeah, so Now I was because I haven't gone down the throughway in a while.

523
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:18,650
Scott: I haven't gone down there in a longer while.

524
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:23,470
Rym: They have a Wi-Fi sign on many of the exits and many of the rest stops do this.

525
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:27,493
Rym: Yeah It's a good time to be alive That way.

526
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:36,290
Scott: that's actually really helpful because how many times you've been driving on the road and then You know, you need to check something and you can't and you basically have to wait till you get where you're going.

527
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:40,224
Rym: Well only if you're a Visigoth, I mean remember when we drove to a penguin con.

528
00:37:40,505 --> 00:37:41,428
Scott: Well, that's that's.

529
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:43,235
Scott: yeah It's still beyond what we had.

530
00:37:43,316 --> 00:37:45,265
Rym: We drove to penguin con through Canada.

531
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:46,410
Rym: It was as Linux con.

532
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:54,338
Rym: We had someone in the car who had a cell modem and they connected to the internet with their cell phone Then from his laptop.

533
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:56,907
Scott: well from his cell phone to his laptop with Bluetooth.

534
00:37:56,927 --> 00:38:05,010
Scott: with Bluetooth He connected his cell phone to his laptop and thus allowing his laptop to go on the internet Through Bluetooth through his cell phone to the cell network.

535
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,099
Rym: Now he set up an ad-hoc wireless network.

536
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:20,710
Scott: in the claim of 802 11 B on his wireless card He allowed another person's laptop to connect to his laptop With the 802 11 then to the Bluetooth then to the cell phone then to the internet.

537
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:33,989
Scott: So we had an internet access point Laptops in a car driving internet with one cell phone driving through the wilds of Canada and Anyone driving nearby us could do the same thing.

538
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:38,245
Rym: Yeah, we even made a sign shoddily out a piece of paper that said free Wi-Fi.

539
00:38:38,285 --> 00:38:39,168
Rym: Here's the SSID.

540
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:42,260
Scott: Yep We had a little picture of tux - yeah granted.

541
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,869
Rym: We passed like one car in Canada.

542
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,730
Scott: So It was still pretty awesome.

543
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:57,437
Rym: So we say 802 11 a lot and you always hear 802 11 a b g 802 11 very simply Think of it as the catch-all.

544
00:38:57,557 --> 00:39:00,485
Rym: like 802 11 means wireless Ethernet.

545
00:39:00,786 --> 00:39:00,987
Scott: Yep.

546
00:39:01,247 --> 00:39:02,110
Rym: Think of it like that.

547
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,240
Rym: It doesn't matter because it's actually kind of complicated.

548
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,685
Rym: how these I triple-e standards work.

549
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:08,149
Rym: Yeah, and you really don't care.

550
00:39:10,712 --> 00:39:13,903
Rym: You care so much less than you might ever think you care.

551
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:15,810
Rym: I learned about this shit in college.

552
00:39:16,653 --> 00:39:20,970
Scott: All you got to know is that in a long time ago they invented something called 802 11.

553
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,139
Scott: It was a standard for wireless communications.

554
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:25,990
Scott: It was works like Ethernet kind of but it's wireless.

555
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,850
Scott: There's no wires and it was kind of crummy.

556
00:39:29,391 --> 00:39:30,073
Scott: But it worked.

557
00:39:30,675 --> 00:39:40,240
Scott: and since then they improved upon it and they improved upon it in ways that it was still 802 11 But it was actually useful and actually fast and actually awesome.

558
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:40,641
Rym: Yep.

559
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:41,302
Rym: Now think of this.

560
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:43,007
Rym: When do you think this was developed?

561
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,543
Scott: Ah 1997 or 98.

562
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:52,310
Rym: Well, it was in fact 1997. that is when the legacy call it legacy now and basically no one uses it.

563
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,235
Scott: No one ever used.

564
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:55,025
Rym: it was like one megabit per second.

565
00:39:55,045 --> 00:40:02,871
Scott: If you were lucky it No one used it except for like stupidly rich companies who desperately needed some wireless and that was the only option in 1997.

566
00:40:02,871 --> 00:40:07,089
Rym: In fact, the primary use of it was people who were working on the standard and companies who were interested in it.

567
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:23,278
Rym: Yeah, so around 1999 which is right before Scott and I and the whole front row crew just about went to college 802 11 a and 802 11 B appeared now, they were both very different and generally 802 11 a had Stupidly more bandwidth.

568
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:26,150
Rym: It was like 25 to 50 megabits per second.

569
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:31,748
Scott: It was really really fast, but in pretty much every other respect a sucked.

570
00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:33,836
Rym: Yep Now there's a lot of reasons for that.

571
00:40:34,137 --> 00:40:37,390
Rym: and then there's 802 11 B which had a lot less bandwidth.

572
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:39,310
Rym: It was like 5 or 10 megabits at most.

573
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:43,687
Scott: 802 11 B is slow, but in every other respect compared to 802 11 a it's awesome.

574
00:40:44,753 --> 00:41:00,210
Rym: now real briefly 802 11 a Probably would have done well because it was super high bandwidth and then B would have worked as and they kind of would have shared the the upon because they both had their different uses, but Basically 802 11 a because it used such higher gigahertz.

575
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:10,150
Rym: It was in the 5 gigahertz range give or take instead of the 2.5 gigahertz range So one you needed much faster chips to make signals in those ranges.

576
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:13,330
Rym: Those chips were a lot more expensive and a lot less efficient.

577
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:21,076
Rym: Thus 802 11 a equipment cost a crazy amount of money used a crazy amount of power So you couldn't even use it in a laptop.

578
00:41:21,117 --> 00:41:21,860
Rym: it drain the battery.

579
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:28,564
Scott: Yep, the 802 11 B sure It was slower, but you didn't have to use so much electricity to make the radio work.

580
00:41:28,604 --> 00:41:29,146
Scott: cuz think about it.

581
00:41:29,267 --> 00:41:31,579
Scott: all wireless stuff It's just radios.

582
00:41:31,962 --> 00:41:33,110
Scott: they're different radios.

583
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,858
Scott: They're not talking on the same frequencies.

584
00:41:34,918 --> 00:41:39,895
Scott: your FM radio and your AM radio or your PM radio But they're all just radios.

585
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:42,261
Scott: I mean Bluetooth is just a radio.

586
00:41:42,482 --> 00:41:43,905
Scott: your cell phone is just a radio.

587
00:41:44,106 --> 00:41:45,690
Scott: It's all radios everything.

588
00:41:45,952 --> 00:41:59,518
Scott: Yeah, some radios take a lot of electricity like oh I don't know the radio that sends TV signals that you can pick up with your antenna and watch and some radios are kind of weak like I don't know a Bluetooth radio, that's a weak-ass radio.

589
00:41:59,779 --> 00:42:06,890
Rym: and also remember because a lot of people don't seem to realize this But pretty much when you're sending data over some sort of wireless thing you're sending digital data.

590
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:12,070
Rym: But the data while it is digital data is being sent in an analog form.

591
00:42:12,421 --> 00:42:18,270
Scott: Yep Gotta convert it to analog send the analog radio signal and then convert it back to digital on the other end.

592
00:42:18,631 --> 00:42:21,870
Rym: The ways you do that are kind of cool and really technical, but maybe we'll get into that someday.

593
00:42:22,031 --> 00:42:24,090
Scott: Yeah, it's not really necessary to talk about that.

594
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:24,773
Rym: I want to talk.

595
00:42:24,853 --> 00:42:31,870
Rym: I took a whole class on it that I've never I've never in my life been able to apply the things I learned in that class because there's useless knowledge unless you're making radios.

596
00:42:32,331 --> 00:42:42,930
Scott: So if you have a high-powered radio to you can get high-powered bandwidth speed lots of range all sorts of good stuff But you're gonna drain your laptop battery in like five minutes.

597
00:42:43,171 --> 00:42:50,880
Rym: The other issue was that while 802.11a used so much more power even though that was mostly due to inefficiency It actually had substantially less range.

598
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:57,310
Rym: In fact, not only did it have fairly short range But it couldn't actually usually shoot through anything.

599
00:42:57,371 --> 00:42:59,792
Rym: So it was basically a line of sight It sucks.

600
00:42:59,993 --> 00:43:07,616
Rym: that has to do with the fact that the higher frequency a radio signal is the more likely it is to bump into things While it's going through matter.

601
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,769
Rym: That's the simplest way I can explain it without getting technical.

602
00:43:11,573 --> 00:43:15,649
Rym: So higher frequency signals are more likely to be blocked by things in the way.

603
00:43:16,031 --> 00:43:23,268
Rym: Thus 802.11a won't even make it through your door or won't even make it Into the bathroom or through the floor or through your desk sometimes.

604
00:43:23,388 --> 00:43:35,568
Scott: Yep Every other 802.11 that you're ever gonna deal with is the 2.4 to 2.5 gigahertz range Which is also where microwaves, cell phones, a lot of other consumer electronics are.

605
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:38,437
Rym: Cordless phones Man, you must make me feel old.

606
00:43:38,497 --> 00:43:45,550
Rym: The last cordless phone I owned was 900 megahertz Yeah, and in fact, it screwed up a 900 megahertz computer.

607
00:43:46,253 --> 00:43:55,790
Scott: Awesome So awesome Yeah, but generally when it the 2.4 gigahertz stuff has a much longer range it can go through a lot of things.

608
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:56,961
Scott: It can't go through everything.

609
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:59,576
Scott: It can't go through lead It can't go through water.

610
00:43:59,897 --> 00:44:03,389
Scott: very well at all, but it can go through a cinder block or two.

611
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,899
Scott: Yeah, it can go through your walls in your house.

612
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,216
Scott: Well enough, you know, it's not gonna go through three houses But it goes.

613
00:44:10,337 --> 00:44:13,150
Scott: you can put it upstairs and be downstairs and still get some access.

614
00:44:13,491 --> 00:44:22,089
Rym: Yep, well considering that 802.11b tends to get a lot of places you didn't expect it or want it to get Even though sometimes it often doesn't get to the one place you wanted it to go.

615
00:44:22,231 --> 00:44:27,810
Scott: Yeah It's kind of that's as do the pointing the antennas and positioning the access point in the correct way.

616
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,638
Rym: Now Scott said that water blocks it now.

617
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,350
Rym: I just want to point out because this this is something you know.

618
00:44:32,471 --> 00:44:33,274
Rym: Think about these things.

619
00:44:33,314 --> 00:44:35,063
Rym: This is how you can seem really smart.

620
00:44:35,143 --> 00:44:37,854
Rym: Even if you don't know a lot about something You're not that technical.

621
00:44:37,894 --> 00:44:40,704
Rym: but alright 2.4 2.5 gigahertz.

622
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:42,089
Rym: That's the range we're talking about here.

623
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:49,677
Rym: Scott said that water blocks and absorbs these signals a lot and I said that Microwaves work in that frequency range.

624
00:44:50,038 --> 00:44:50,781
Rym: now think about it.

625
00:44:51,223 --> 00:44:53,130
Rym: Why do microwaves work in that frequency range?

626
00:44:53,970 --> 00:45:00,490
Rym: Because water absorbs those frequencies and when they absorb anything you take the energy out of it and you get hot.

627
00:45:01,056 --> 00:45:02,148
Rym: That's how microwaves work.

628
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:09,650
Scott: Yeah They make the water go hot and that's why sometimes microwave food is mushy and sometimes microwave food is all dried out and bland.

629
00:45:10,023 --> 00:45:12,660
Rym: Yeah Sadly, we don't actually own a microwave.

630
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,947
Scott: We don't want to own a microwave.

631
00:45:13,987 --> 00:45:14,409
Scott: We don't need it.

632
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:19,880
Rym: Well, there's been a few times I've wanted it mostly when we have old Chinese food, but we've learned Yeah, and it works.

633
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:29,390
Scott: Okay also Microwaves, that's why they fry your brain because they zap all the water in your brain Whereas like cosmic ray from outer space just goes right through you and doesn't do anything.

634
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:37,414
Rym: Well, there is often the chance that I mean there are odds that a cosmic ray will hit the DNA in a cell and screw It up and make a cancer.

635
00:45:37,595 --> 00:45:40,765
Scott: Yeah, it could happen but most of the time pass right through you.

636
00:45:41,427 --> 00:45:43,816
Rym: Anyway, yeah That was an interesting tangent.

637
00:45:43,856 --> 00:45:47,410
Rym: Yes, we we actually we actually know very little beyond what we just said.

638
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,461
Scott: That's pretty much all we know about cosmic rays.

639
00:45:49,923 --> 00:45:58,910
Scott: So 802 11 B slower than 802 11 B. But I mean a B is slower than a but B doesn't take too much energy.

640
00:45:59,272 --> 00:46:01,690
Scott: Yeah, you can run it with like a cordless phone battery.

641
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,155
Scott: You can run it with a laptop battery.

642
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:07,430
Scott: The range is a little better than a. you can get like a hundred meters.

643
00:46:07,712 --> 00:46:08,296
Scott: It's pretty good.

644
00:46:08,437 --> 00:46:10,330
Rym: Yeah, as long as nothing is in the way and it's not humid.

645
00:46:10,611 --> 00:46:20,150
Scott: Yep, and you know people when 802 left B came around It was actually fast enough that you could browse the web on it and you could get it on your laptop.

646
00:46:20,451 --> 00:46:27,470
Rym: Hell you realize 802 11 B is much faster than many networking technologies were until relatively recently.

647
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:33,610
Scott: Yeah, I mean every old Ethernet used to be 10 megabits per second until they get T 100 which is 100 megabits per second.

648
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:39,774
Scott: 802 11 B was like 11 megabits per second if you're in got really good signal And it was all.

649
00:46:39,834 --> 00:46:40,918
Scott: it was five and a half.

650
00:46:40,978 --> 00:46:43,970
Scott: if you had a shitty signal that still worked actually would keep dropping.

651
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:46,543
Rym: The reason 802 11 B would still work.

652
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,030
Rym: just it would always slow down.

653
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:56,415
Rym: Whatever conditions were bad is that the protocol would generally add redundancy and do things where it would lower the overall bandwidth But increase the reliability.

654
00:46:56,696 --> 00:46:59,364
Rym: So the more interference you have the more the bandwidth drops.

655
00:46:59,866 --> 00:47:00,147
Scott: Mm-hmm.

656
00:47:00,448 --> 00:47:01,010
Scott: That's good stuff.

657
00:47:01,211 --> 00:47:09,217
Rym: Yeah, however, 802 11 B while it's great is actually in terms of internet time Extremely ancient technology.

658
00:47:09,558 --> 00:47:11,144
Rym: It was adopted almost immediately.

659
00:47:11,485 --> 00:47:15,508
Rym: It caught on like wildfire and It's kind of obsolete now.

660
00:47:15,924 --> 00:47:26,030
Scott: Yeah I mean pretty much every wireless card and wireless access point supports 802 11 B because that was the first Wireless internet that people used all over the place and coffee house and everything.

661
00:47:26,572 --> 00:47:34,598
Scott: but people stopped using it because they invented G which is Just like B in every possible fashion.

662
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:35,822
Scott: only it's better.

663
00:47:36,323 --> 00:47:36,544
Rym: Yep.

664
00:47:36,885 --> 00:47:50,498
Rym: It has more range more bandwidth It's backward compatible with B. Now sadly older 802 11 BG networks if there was any B in the traffic the whole network would slow down Because let's say you had a BG router.

665
00:47:50,558 --> 00:47:57,490
Scott: right it can handle Pete laptops with B and it can handle laptops with G. Right someone comes along with G. They connect to G speeds.

666
00:47:58,177 --> 00:48:00,735
Scott: Someone else comes along with G. They connect to G speeds.

667
00:48:01,277 --> 00:48:04,730
Scott: a third guy comes along and he's only got B because his laptop is old.

668
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:13,874
Scott: He brings everyone down to B. So now the 2g guys have to suffer at the B speed and because there's one B guy ruining the party that that was the way It was.

669
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:15,346
Rym: yeah, it's gotten better.

670
00:48:15,386 --> 00:48:15,769
Rym: since then.

671
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,016
Rym: G is well.

672
00:48:17,096 --> 00:48:25,084
Rym: one more things are using G instead of B and that Backwards compatibility issue has been mostly resolved except in old networks or old access points.

673
00:48:25,385 --> 00:48:27,250
Scott: Yeah, it's still not so great though.

674
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:32,369
Scott: You generally want to have everything BG and you want to keep the bees out as much as you possibly can.

675
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,937
Rym: of course That's how I live my life.

676
00:48:34,339 --> 00:48:39,800
Rym: I keep bees out of my house as much as possible Yeah But the like things like your DS or your.

677
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,990
Scott: we are still using B and there's not much you can do about it.

678
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:51,543
Rym: The only real problem with G is that it operates in the exact same frequency band as B. So the same interference problems apply.

679
00:48:51,663 --> 00:48:56,995
Scott: you can't go through water microwaves Bluetooth Some telephones.

680
00:48:57,336 --> 00:48:57,617
Scott: Yep.

681
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:00,626
Scott: So G is what everyone uses nowadays.

682
00:49:00,987 --> 00:49:01,830
Scott: It's pretty fast.

683
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:06,243
Scott: It's not stupid fast, but it's fast enough to do nice web browsing action.

684
00:49:06,424 --> 00:49:13,150
Scott: G is as fast as a wanted to be Yep, but now everyone's talking about N and is gonna be the new hotness.

685
00:49:13,231 --> 00:49:17,700
Scott: It's not here yet But it's coming soon and it's gonna be pretty sweet now.

686
00:49:18,061 --> 00:49:19,866
Scott: N is a little bit different.

687
00:49:19,886 --> 00:49:24,359
Scott: B and G is B and G. You're basically sort of the same exact principle.

688
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:29,449
Scott: only G is improved and as one more thing to the mix It has this thing called my mo.

689
00:49:29,992 --> 00:49:34,730
Scott: I'm not gonna go into detail about why mo is because I only understand a little bit myself.

690
00:49:34,911 --> 00:49:39,790
Scott: But what you do is you have a bunch of antennas instead of just one antenna.

691
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:42,519
Scott: You know just sending out a signal and receiving a signal.

692
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:47,298
Scott: you get a bunch of antennas and You sort of send out a whole bunch of signals.

693
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:53,579
Scott: and on the other end you have a whole bunch of antennas and they all Receive all these signals and then they add them together.

694
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:59,034
Scott: They do some crazy radio math and what that gets you is Stupid bandwidth.

695
00:49:59,074 --> 00:50:03,510
Scott: we're talking faster than a wire here like five hundred and forty megabits per second.

696
00:50:03,711 --> 00:50:08,870
Rym: Well, I'd say faster than a wire but gigabit Ethernet gigabit Ethernet rapidly becoming the standard.

697
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:13,283
Scott: It's about five times the speed of regular Ethernet and half the speed of gigabit Ethernet.

698
00:50:13,423 --> 00:50:14,707
Scott: That's pretty ridiculous.

699
00:50:14,747 --> 00:50:15,549
Scott: fast right there.

700
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:22,670
Scott: Secondly, the range is better than it is on a B or G or a. it's the best range you're ever gonna get.

701
00:50:23,111 --> 00:50:24,758
Scott: It's still 2.4 gigahertz though.

702
00:50:24,818 --> 00:50:27,730
Scott: So you still got the problems with the water and stuff, but that's not a big deal.

703
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:28,753
Scott: You're dealing with that already.

704
00:50:28,773 --> 00:50:29,215
Scott: who cares?

705
00:50:29,917 --> 00:50:33,650
Scott: and the last thing that end does is it takes the same amount of power.

706
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:38,686
Scott: Your laptop battery is not gonna drain any faster than it drains with B or G.

707
00:50:38,726 --> 00:50:40,070
Rym: It's gonna hot diggity day.

708
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:49,599
Scott: It's gonna drain at the same exact speed and you're gonna get ten times the data ten times the bandwidth Same battery life and is pretty hotness.

709
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:53,250
Scott: The thing is they haven't quite finished and yet.

710
00:50:53,611 --> 00:51:03,464
Scott: So there's some people that will sell you some end and like let's say you buy some end stuff from from Linksys and you buy an end card and an end router from linksys.

711
00:51:03,786 --> 00:51:04,569
Scott: It'll probably work.

712
00:51:05,172 --> 00:51:08,442
Scott: It probably won't work if you try to use it with a netgear end.

713
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:09,626
Scott: You gotta wait.

714
00:51:09,927 --> 00:51:13,338
Scott: don't buy end yet You gotta wait until everyone decides.

715
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:16,910
Scott: Okay, this is the standard for end and then all the end stuff will work together.

716
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:22,610
Rym: Yeah, because there was be stuff and G stuff that came out before the standard was finalized and then things changed a little bit.

717
00:51:22,951 --> 00:51:32,426
Scott: Yep, I mean G was like out and everyone was like we got G It's faster and better and it worked but it didn't work so well with the other people's G stuff.

718
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:33,730
Scott: everyone kind of you know.

719
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:42,636
Scott: they looked at the current working standard and they put out products before the standard was finalized and the standard changed a little bit and Some of the early products were not so great.

720
00:51:43,078 --> 00:51:43,940
Rym: You're probably wondering.

721
00:51:44,422 --> 00:51:49,080
Rym: All right, a b g n Didn't they skip a bunch of letters?

722
00:51:49,381 --> 00:51:50,950
Scott: No, they didn't skip a bunch of letters.

723
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:52,495
Rym: The thing is there.

724
00:51:52,656 --> 00:52:02,028
Rym: all those other letters stand for various aspects of the 802 11 standard group whatever and suffice to say the part that you didn't care about.

725
00:52:02,168 --> 00:52:05,464
Scott: and you know, You don't you don't have no idea how much you don't care.

726
00:52:05,485 --> 00:52:06,530
Rym: I'll give you an example.

727
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:17,950
Scott: 802 11 J is a specific extensions for Japan But 802 11 s is the extended service set mesh networking.

728
00:52:19,655 --> 00:52:20,186
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

729
00:52:20,691 --> 00:52:22,899
Rym: so those are things that you really don't need to worry about.

730
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:31,789
Rym: they're just think of them as kind of like standards that are just applied anyway, and AB and G and N are actual protocols that you will use.

731
00:52:32,371 --> 00:52:39,170
Scott: Yep, 802 11 P is wave wireless access for the vehicular environment such as ambulances and passenger cars.

732
00:52:40,931 --> 00:52:42,342
Rym: There's a list on Wikipedia.

733
00:52:42,403 --> 00:52:43,330
Rym: you can read about all this.

734
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,058
Rym: That's what I'm reading.

735
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,156
Rym: I'm not gonna read it to you All.

736
00:52:46,217 --> 00:52:55,111
Rym: in fact at RIT I was told by my professor in the wireless class that all those other letters are useless garbage that you'll never need to know About.

737
00:52:55,775 --> 00:52:56,981
Scott: uh, you know what all those letters?

738
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:58,870
Scott: they're useless garbage and you don't need to know about.

739
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:01,850
Rym: I guess unless you're working on the standard then you got to care about them quite a bit.

740
00:53:02,011 --> 00:53:05,756
Scott: Yeah, if you work for the IEEE then yes You need to know what all those letters mean.

741
00:53:06,197 --> 00:53:08,926
Rym: now when it comes to security you might have heard that there's.

742
00:53:09,308 --> 00:53:11,800
Rym: you hear WEP WEP and WPA.

743
00:53:12,751 --> 00:53:13,315
Rym: Those are the two.

744
00:53:13,335 --> 00:53:15,530
Scott: you might also hear some other words, but don't worry about them.

745
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:18,100
Scott: Yeah, basically, here's the situation.

746
00:53:18,602 --> 00:53:21,516
Scott: you're using wireless internets Right now.

747
00:53:21,938 --> 00:53:34,877
Scott: when you do important things on the internet Like check your email with Gmail or buy something from Amazon that little lock icon appears and your web browser is encrypting all the important Bits, however, none of the other stuff you're doing is encrypted.

748
00:53:34,997 --> 00:53:36,259
Scott: It's pretty much straight out there.

749
00:53:36,299 --> 00:53:45,686
Scott: if you visit Frontrecruit.com Anyone who has you know is on this can look at your if they had access to the wire that your computer is connected to The internet with right next to your computer.

750
00:53:45,987 --> 00:53:48,074
Scott: They could see that you visited frontrecruit.com.

751
00:53:48,134 --> 00:53:49,760
Scott: now take away the wire.

752
00:53:50,142 --> 00:53:52,453
Scott: You're just sending a radio signal over the air.

753
00:53:52,754 --> 00:53:56,170
Scott: anyone with a radio Can listen to the radio.

754
00:53:56,591 --> 00:54:09,840
Scott: if someone has a 2.4 gigahertz radio They can listen to what you're doing and they can plug that radio into their computer and see what you're up to Even though you're still doing your important business encrypted and they won't be able to figure out say your credit card number.

755
00:54:10,161 --> 00:54:14,060
Scott: They'll be like, oh you visited this website and then this website and then this website.

756
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:19,629
Scott: Oh and then I know his email address even though I don't know his email password and such and such and so on.

757
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:26,294
Scott: and you really don't want to use wireless if Everyone else and their mother can see everything that you're doing.

758
00:54:26,676 --> 00:54:27,420
Scott: That's not cool.

759
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:33,120
Rym: Furthermore these things also exist to keep other people from using your wireless and taking up your bandwidth.

760
00:54:33,624 --> 00:54:39,958
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you got a wireless network You sometimes you want to let everyone in the world use it, but sometimes you don't want anyone to use it.

761
00:54:39,978 --> 00:54:40,420
Scott: It's yours.

762
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,127
Scott: Why should anyone else have access to it?

763
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:45,018
Scott: You need a way to keep people out while keeping you in.

764
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:45,902
Rym: now We're not gonna.

765
00:54:46,002 --> 00:54:55,980
Rym: we're gonna go real brief about this and just explain that there are these two different ways of doing it and basically You only want to use one of them, but you're kind of forced to use the other one if you're a gamer.

766
00:54:56,181 --> 00:54:56,843
Scott: Yes, okay.

767
00:54:56,863 --> 00:54:57,805
Rym: So I'll talk about weapon.

768
00:54:57,825 --> 00:54:58,548
Rym: you can talk about WPA.

769
00:54:58,608 --> 00:54:59,169
Rym: All right.

770
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:03,664
Rym: WEP is the wire equivalent protocol I think it stands for.

771
00:55:03,684 --> 00:55:05,592
Rym: it doesn't matter cuz it meant they don't like.

772
00:55:05,712 --> 00:55:07,560
Rym: oh, it's equivalent security to the wire.

773
00:55:08,085 --> 00:55:16,692
Rym: basically, it's a system of Encrypting the traffic between you and your access point so that no one else can just kind of stiff it And it worked pretty well for a while.

774
00:55:17,175 --> 00:55:20,269
Rym: It is now Completely and entirely broken.

775
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:27,833
Rym: by just sitting there and watching someone else's traffic You can trivially and in a matter of minutes break the web key and read everything they do.

776
00:55:28,234 --> 00:55:37,300
Rym: WEP is entirely useless But it does keep the riffraff out because despite the fact that it's broken not many people know that they can break it.

777
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:41,820
Rym: Yes, and the people who do know that they can break it usually just want to get and look at some porn or something.

778
00:55:42,161 --> 00:55:47,299
Scott: Yeah, any geek knows that you can break WEP and let's say you secure your wireless access point.

779
00:55:47,319 --> 00:55:54,970
Scott: with WEP I can come along with two computers and I can have access to your network in maybe 10 minutes or so if there's a Lot of people using your network.

780
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,380
Scott: I don't even need two computers.

781
00:55:57,043 --> 00:55:58,006
Scott: One and I can use.

782
00:55:58,046 --> 00:56:03,267
Rym: I think there was a flaw where you could force routers to actually generate a Bunch of data and break.

783
00:56:03,348 --> 00:56:04,555
Scott: it was certain routers now.

784
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:05,299
Scott: They don't I don't know.

785
00:56:05,741 --> 00:56:08,690
Scott: The point is if you're using WEP encryption, right?

786
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:12,180
Scott: Yes, it will encrypt the traffic you send over the wireless and people.

787
00:56:12,381 --> 00:56:13,023
Rym: Yep, it is true.

788
00:56:13,043 --> 00:56:18,119
Rym: They had a 211 protocol itself breaks wet because it forces the router to send data out.

789
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:34,480
Scott: Yep, but people you'll be encrypted and people listening on the radio won't be able to easily figure out what you're saying but someone who knows what they're doing can get access to your wireless network and Figure out what you're saying and all sorts of stuff with relative ease.

790
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,949
Scott: They're just programs that do this.

791
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:39,470
Scott: any nerd knows how to use them but normal people don't know how to use them.

792
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:43,900
Scott: normal people think it's perfectly secure and Oh my god, it's better than nothing.

793
00:56:44,061 --> 00:56:51,970
Rym: It takes three seconds and three megabytes of RAM on a Pentium M 1.7 gigahertz to break WEP in the average case.

794
00:56:52,312 --> 00:56:54,439
Rym: Wow according to an article I'm looking at.

795
00:56:54,881 --> 00:57:00,660
Scott: Yeah, they keep developing new ways of doing it Like you used to take 10 minutes and then it took five minutes, you know, just kind of a game like how fast can I?

796
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:01,201
Rym: Break wet.

797
00:57:01,442 --> 00:57:07,340
Scott: Yeah, it's something that we know is broken, but it's better to put like the lock on our front door Rym, right?

798
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,960
Scott: Do you think someone who knew a lot about locks could pick that lock easily?

799
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:15,679
Rym: In fact, I could look on the internet and pick the lock to our house or any house in our neighborhood in about 15 minutes.

800
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,973
Scott: Yep, but would you rather have that lock or no lock?

801
00:57:19,415 --> 00:57:20,379
Scott: I'd rather have that lock.

802
00:57:20,841 --> 00:57:23,450
Scott: Yet WEP is sort of like the lock that everyone knows.

803
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:23,992
Scott: you can pick.

804
00:57:24,313 --> 00:57:28,038
Scott: sure if there's an expert burglar He's gonna come and get into your house.

805
00:57:28,441 --> 00:57:33,840
Scott: But for the most part it keeps people out of your house like the homeless bums walking up and down the road.

806
00:57:34,081 --> 00:57:40,606
Rym: It also gives you if you're this kind of person a tiny bit of legal leeway and that if someone is using your wireless Illegally.

807
00:57:41,009 --> 00:57:47,000
Rym: you can argue that You did not give them access because you would clearly encrypted your channel and not given them the code.

808
00:57:47,823 --> 00:57:49,931
Scott: We are not lawyers though, so I don't know how well that stands up.

809
00:57:49,971 --> 00:57:52,320
Scott: considering another recent case of craziness.

810
00:57:52,521 --> 00:57:54,451
Rym: Oh, don't get me started on the freaking wireless.

811
00:57:54,531 --> 00:57:56,220
Rym: Yeah, I could do a whole show on that.

812
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,928
Scott: Yeah, you could do a whole show on a lot of things.

813
00:57:58,088 --> 00:58:00,600
Scott: Yeah, I could alright, so that's wet wet.

814
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:17,229
Scott: the thing about problem with WEP is that you can either configure your router to use WEP or use something else and The Wii and the DS and other similar game consoles and things use WEP only they don't support like the DS Especially only supports wet right.

815
00:58:17,631 --> 00:58:25,879
Scott: so if you want to use your DS with your Wi-Fi You can either use WEP or use nothing you can't use what I'm about to talk about which is WPA.

816
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:33,428
Scott: WPA is superior to WEP in every possible fashion is two more than X. It is so much better than WEP.

817
00:58:33,588 --> 00:58:34,392
Scott: It is ludicrous.

818
00:58:34,813 --> 00:58:38,609
Scott: basically if you use WPA No one can break into your network.

819
00:58:39,352 --> 00:58:41,260
Scott: No one can get in unless you give them the password.

820
00:58:41,461 --> 00:58:43,327
Scott: That's pretty much how it works and not only that.

821
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:47,180
Scott: but your password isn't some you know hex number.

822
00:58:47,341 --> 00:58:52,043
Scott: That's only you know using zero one three or six seven eight nine ABCDEF.

823
00:58:52,344 --> 00:58:53,066
Scott: it's a password.

824
00:58:53,207 --> 00:58:54,892
Scott: you can make it a giant passphrase.

825
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:55,594
Scott: you could make it.

826
00:58:56,015 --> 00:59:03,220
Scott: you know my monkey's uncle GeekNights in the house one one three exclamation point and that could be the password to get into your wireless network.

827
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:07,244
Scott: the encryption of WPA is Full-on encryption.

828
00:59:07,284 --> 00:59:09,210
Scott: that is very difficult to break.

829
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:12,239
Scott: that would take a bunch of supercomputers a very long time to figure out.

830
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:19,589
Scott: The problem with WPA is if you turn that on you can't also have WEP so your DS Can't get on your Wi-Fi.

831
00:59:19,629 --> 00:59:21,419
Scott: That's the only reason we don't use WPA.

832
00:59:22,182 --> 00:59:27,100
Scott: Also, not every wireless card works with WPA old busted wireless cards.

833
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:31,280
Scott: They might need a newer firmware or something like that in order to use WPA.

834
00:59:31,481 --> 00:59:33,347
Rym: There are multiple ways to use WPA.

835
00:59:33,427 --> 00:59:34,973
Rym: most consumers just use something.

836
00:59:35,013 --> 00:59:35,514
Rym: PSK.

837
00:59:35,535 --> 00:59:46,577
Rym: you might have heard that acronym stands for Pre-shared key where there's a passphrase like Scott said a key and everyone who uses your network you have to share in the Sharon Shared the key with them ahead of time.

838
00:59:46,758 --> 00:59:55,219
Rym: yep You can also use this cool X kind of server thing that does that for you in a cool and complicated way But that's really only used in businesses.

839
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:00,462
Scott: Yeah, there are lots of enterprise WPA's and other sorts of WPA's But those are.

840
01:00:00,502 --> 01:00:03,571
Scott: the only difference between them is how people get the password.

841
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:07,205
Scott: or maybe it's a fact or maybe everyone has their own password.

842
01:00:07,225 --> 01:00:08,895
Scott: it just gets crazy.

843
01:00:08,935 --> 01:00:12,889
Scott: the point is WPA is secure wireless networking.

844
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:15,155
Scott: that is ludicrously difficult to break.

845
01:00:15,597 --> 01:00:26,620
Scott: if you use WPA Your wireless network is secure And you can sleep easy if you don't have a Nintendo DS or some other web only device that you were using on your wireless network.

846
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:29,639
Scott: I suggest you use WPA and nothing else.

847
01:00:30,101 --> 01:00:34,558
Scott: Unless you want to have your network open then use nothing because if you're gonna have it open just have it open.

848
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:35,381
Scott: don't bother With anything.

849
01:00:35,482 --> 01:00:40,036
Rym: remember the advantage of an open network is that when the RIA comes calling you can't.

850
01:00:40,076 --> 01:00:41,380
Rym: they can't prove at all.

851
01:00:42,003 --> 01:00:43,712
Scott: Someone tried that and it didn't work recently.

852
01:00:43,913 --> 01:00:45,120
Rym: well it depends on how you argue it.

853
01:00:45,401 --> 01:00:46,184
Scott: I guess I don't know.

854
01:00:46,305 --> 01:00:48,896
Rym: cuz at most you're guilty of violating the terms of service.

855
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:53,766
Rym: Yeah, we're not lawyers Yeah, but from a technical standpoint I could not prove who did it.

856
01:00:53,986 --> 01:01:05,340
Scott: from a technical standpoint if your wireless network is open to the world and anyone can connect Then nobody can prove that you know who is actually doing the traffic that goes over your network.

857
01:01:05,501 --> 01:01:10,060
Rym: However, that is usually a violation of the terms of service of just about every ISP in the United States.

858
01:01:10,361 --> 01:01:15,120
Scott: Yep, actually there are some ISPs doing some weird things recently, but then I could talk about that.

859
01:01:15,461 --> 01:01:17,345
Rym: Yeah, now real real quick.

860
01:01:17,646 --> 01:01:23,520
Rym: your Bluetooth is just a really short-range really low bandwidth way of connecting little peripherals to other things.

861
01:01:23,841 --> 01:01:30,970
Scott: yep, Bluetooth is a weak tiny radio and They use it to connect a cell phone to a computer a cell phone to a headset.

862
01:01:31,633 --> 01:01:35,610
Scott: There are lots of Bluetooth profiles and things that let you do weird things with Bluetooth.

863
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:41,226
Scott: You can use A2DP to send stereo audio over Bluetooth to a pair of stereo headphones.

864
01:01:41,266 --> 01:01:49,527
Scott: You can use a Bluetooth DUN to turn a cell phone into a modem and then your computer thinks it's a modem.

865
01:01:50,008 --> 01:02:00,197
Scott: you can use Bluetooth pan the personal area network where you can actually make a network of computers an IP network with IP addresses that are all Connected by Bluetooth.

866
01:02:00,479 --> 01:02:02,090
Scott: It's a bunch of stuff you can do with Bluetooth.

867
01:02:02,572 --> 01:02:16,929
Scott: It's just a nice weak low powered radio to connect things that are close to each other Very close to each other like in the same room wirelessly and not so quickly but quickly enough to say use a mouse or a keyboard or listen to music.

868
01:02:17,129 --> 01:02:20,983
Rym: and Yeah RFID a lot of people talk about that's actually really different.

869
01:02:21,224 --> 01:02:24,940
Scott: RFID really has nothing to do with this But it's something wireless that people hear about.

870
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,729
Rym: people don't seem to really understand it.

871
01:02:27,251 --> 01:02:27,934
Rym: I mean all it is.

872
01:02:27,974 --> 01:02:29,521
Rym: it's a passive kind of thing.

873
01:02:29,561 --> 01:02:31,650
Rym: We have a chip that isn't powered or anything.

874
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:43,870
Rym: It's just a chip sitting there and it has a circuit in it that if you hit it with a certain kind of radio Wave that radio wave Provides power to activate it and then it broadcasts a little bit of data that you then read.

875
01:02:44,412 --> 01:02:47,582
Scott: Like if you had you can make a radio without a battery.

876
01:02:47,622 --> 01:02:50,271
Scott: just the volume is really low and you can barely hear what's going on.

877
01:02:50,632 --> 01:02:56,029
Scott: because the only power that's going into the radio is the power of the radio signal itself and then you add a battery.

878
01:02:56,130 --> 01:03:02,323
Scott: when You have a battery in your you know, FM radio All you're really doing with that battery is amplifying the signals that you can hear it.

879
01:03:02,584 --> 01:03:03,387
Scott: That's all it really does.

880
01:03:04,049 --> 01:03:07,220
Scott: So RFID doesn't really care about amplifying.

881
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:09,050
Scott: you just shoot a radio signal into it.

882
01:03:09,371 --> 01:03:13,187
Scott: That's enough power to make the RFID send back the ID.

883
01:03:13,328 --> 01:03:17,941
Rym: that's inside All right, and I'm done talking about that.

884
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:19,245
Rym: So I gotta go get a sheet.

885
01:03:19,265 --> 01:03:24,504
Rym: I think I'll have some Ghosts might be popping her in the Scott's room and some short orders.

886
01:03:24,544 --> 01:03:38,126
Scott: Yeah, there's a bunch of other wireless Technologies like satellite stuff and like point-to-point microwave links and all sorts of ridiculous things out there but these are the ones you really have to know about and the ways to keep them secure.

887
01:03:38,146 --> 01:03:41,893
Scott: that you have to know about that you're going to encounter and That's about it.

888
01:03:42,295 --> 01:03:45,890
Rym: We'll talk about security sometime in the future probably when we can't come up with a better Monday.

889
01:03:46,171 --> 01:03:51,692
Scott: Yep, and if you have any questions and like how to set up a home network, maybe that's a separate episode Maybe not.

890
01:03:51,933 --> 01:03:52,254
Scott: I don't know.

891
01:03:52,615 --> 01:03:53,940
Rym: Yeah, or you can ask in the forums.

892
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:56,329
Rym: Yeah, Scott will tell you to google it.

893
01:03:58,190 --> 01:03:59,211
Scott: That's pretty much how it's gonna go.

894
01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:08,660
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
