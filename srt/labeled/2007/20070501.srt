1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,557
Scott: It's Tuesday, May 1st.

2
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:12,661
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:15,370
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:16,174 --> 00:00:20,065
Scott: Tonight we review an awesome board game called Vinci.

5
00:00:23,162 --> 00:00:23,893
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:37,540
Rym: So since I was in Rochester for the weekend I did get a chance to go to millennium games the pretty much undisputedly best gaming store in the United States.

7
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:39,720
Scott: There might be a better gaming store somewhere.

8
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:45,926
Scott: I mean like I went to the complete strategist in New York City and Sure, they have more games total.

9
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:46,428
Scott: I guess.

10
00:00:46,688 --> 00:00:47,972
Scott: and the games they have?

11
00:00:47,992 --> 00:00:50,960
Scott: they have more copies of them than millennium does.

12
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:53,790
Scott: But really millennium is a better store overall.

13
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:57,805
Scott: They have a wider variety of types of games And they have a gaming

14
00:00:57,885 --> 00:01:05,229
Rym: store that is full of people from when it opens early in the morning until when it closes late at Night every single day no matter what and it

15
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:19,298
Scott: only sells games not like the local dragon's den, which is okay But it's also a comic book store and a video game store and an airsoft store And an everything geeky store whereas millennium is just a gaming store and nothing else.

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,640
Rym: well I was there and of course every time I go to Rochester I buy board games because while I can buy them online buying them at millennium is always the best deal.

17
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:28,520
Rym: There's no shipping.

18
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:29,865
Rym: It's just perfect.

19
00:01:29,905 --> 00:01:32,294
Rym: plus the people there know a lot about games.

20
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:36,770
Rym: if I walk up and say hey How's such-and-such they know everything about it?

21
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,990
Scott: Yep also buying board games in person is Especially if you've never played the game before.

22
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,135
Scott: it's sort of a must.

23
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:47,092
Scott: you don't buy a game You've never played or looked at before on the internet.

24
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,386
Scott: Just looking at pictures on board game geek That's not enough to decide.

25
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:55,579
Scott: you either have to play it and then buy it online or read the rules And then buy it on or something.

26
00:01:56,023 --> 00:02:05,040
Scott: But if you're in person with the game in a box You can tell from the box and from board game geek with you know you can tell if that's something you're worth buying right now.

27
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:07,470
Rym: Well I did pick up.

28
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:08,215
Rym: it costs a lot.

29
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:08,616
Rym: it was 60 bucks.

30
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:14,080
Rym: I hope it's worth it, but I figure I would pay a lot of money for a good two-player game.

31
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:18,174
Rym: Yeah, you might have heard about our troubles of finding two-player games that don't suck after off.

32
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,904
Scott: hellis hell It's the worst game.

33
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:21,948
Rym: It wasn't the worst game.

34
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:22,511
Rym: I played.

35
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:23,394
Scott: what worst game.

36
00:02:23,414 --> 00:02:24,719
Scott: if you play I can think of a few.

37
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,003
Rym: Candyland's pretty bad Monopoly's pretty bad.

38
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,691
Scott: Oh that the unspeakable game for the Gamecube.

39
00:02:32,092 --> 00:02:33,275
Rym: Oh that one.

40
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:43,100
Rym: yeah that one, but yeah I got Twilight struggle which is a really different kind of game from the kind of games We normally play and I'm not gonna get in any detail.

41
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,134
Rym: We're gonna review it once we've played it which might be a while because it's a complicated game.

42
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:55,231
Rym: Yeah, it's basically an abstracted historical pseudo-simulation of the entirety of the Cold War.

43
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:55,773
Scott: yep.

44
00:02:56,215 --> 00:03:04,300
Scott: however whereas other games You know lean more towards the simulation of history this game goes that way, but it leans back never.

45
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:11,700
Scott: It never abandons its gameness, and it's also a card war game as opposed to a miniatures war game.

46
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,440
Rym: So it's basically an asymmetric card based war game for two players.

47
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:22,891
Scott: Yep, and there are apparently a lot of games like this, but according to everyone who likes these kind of games This is the one.

48
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:27,514
Rym: yes partly Because it doesn't take eight hours to play like some of the other ones do.

49
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:33,388
Scott: yep if this one is good I'll buy Shifting Sands, which is a similar game in the way It works.

50
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:37,475
Rym: also I got to say the cover art sold me on it even if I didn't know anything about this game.

51
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:40,928
Rym: the cover art just so Perfectly says everything this game is about.

52
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:44,400
Scott: I think the only if this game lives up to my expectation.

53
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,567
Scott: I think the only disappointment will be that it's only a two-player game Because it's the kind of game like yes.

54
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:51,590
Scott: We have a two-player game.

55
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,192
Scott: No.

56
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,400
Scott: It's only two-player, and it's so great.

57
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,734
Scott: Why can't we enjoy it with more than two?

58
00:03:56,976 --> 00:03:57,660
Scott: the one cool thing?

59
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,053
Rym: I want to point out though is that it's a game that involves the Cold War.

60
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:02,840
Rym: you know the possibility of nuclear war.

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,760
Rym: Anytime there's a game that involves nuclear war there's always the point at which all the nukes get launched, and it's awesome like civilization.

62
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:12,213
Scott: Yeah, I got the nukes nuke nuke nuke nuke nuke nuke nuke nuke.

63
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:13,440
Rym: yep, or I've got the nukes.

64
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:14,765
Rym: There's a bug in the game.

65
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:19,613
Rym: I now have a thousand fortified nukes sitting off the coast of Europe Just waiting for Russia to start.

66
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:20,178
Scott: shit yep.

67
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:23,345
Rym: But in this game There's DEFCON levels and all that.

68
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:29,446
Scott: if you reach DEFCON 1 and nuclear war breaks out pretty much Which is guaranteed at you have found one.

69
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:33,440
Rym: the game ends and whoever started the nuclear war loses regardless.

70
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,126
Scott: It's not whoever started.

71
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:36,973
Scott: no new whoever causes the nuclear.

72
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:37,274
Rym: well.

73
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:38,378
Scott: That's not what the rule is.

74
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:38,980
Scott: I read the rest.

75
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:47,160
Scott: It is actually if it's your turn and the nuclear war starts, so let's say I yes however the way events work.

76
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:51,095
Rym: If it's your events then it's now effectively your turn.

77
00:04:51,115 --> 00:05:03,806
Scott: while it happens however let's say I do something and You have a decision whether to you know nuclear war should start or not because it rests some based on some other factor whether the DEFCON level will decrease.

78
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:08,823
Scott: then you might force it to decrease because you know it's my turn and Then nuclear war breaks.

79
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:16,857
Rym: from what I read any case where you can force it to decrease would almost every time if not every single Time be when you were phasing and then you would lose.

80
00:05:16,877 --> 00:05:17,863
Scott: well I don't know.

81
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:24,296
Scott: we're gonna have to play this game a few times to get all the but think it's not like other games where Nuclear war is the end like you're waiting for it.

82
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:24,920
Rym: you expect it.

83
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,999
Rym: It's the fun part of the game.

84
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,032
Rym: It's nuclear war and to be avoided is the end of the game.

85
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:32,929
Scott: cuz you failed you lost the cold And that's only one of the ends of the game.

86
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,220
Scott: all the other ends of the game are much more preferable.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:48,080
Rym: However, I'm thinking what we should do is every time we play this game if there's a nuclear war we should just play DEFCON And then declare we gotta wait for new PCs to play DEFCON any day any day, I think tonight's the night.

88
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,180
Rym: I think I've hammered out all of my long-standing issues with buying a new computer.

89
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,022
Scott: Well, we'll see.

90
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:58,136
Rym: but in actual news Nintendo's been doing pretty well with this whole Wii thing.

91
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,400
Scott: Yeah, that's kind of weird.

92
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,239
Scott: They've been doing so well, but they haven't been selling any games have they?

93
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,860
Scott: well I mean they sold five hundred thousand pokemons, but other than that not too many games.

94
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:13,970
Rym: Nintendo hasn't been making very many games And I think the reason is they haven't needed to.

95
00:06:14,351 --> 00:06:30,439
Rym: because in the previous year the fiscal year Nintendo's profits Profits operating profit not revenue not but straight-up profit jumped a hundred and fifty percent and they made almost one Trillion yen, that's like eight billion US dollars.

96
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:35,220
Scott: It's still not Bill Gates level of money, but that's pretty big money.

97
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:37,069
Rym: Remember that's profits.

98
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:39,240
Rym: their revenues are insane.

99
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:41,190
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of sad.

100
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,960
Scott: It's like, you know the company Above and be all other things is trying to make profit, right?

101
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,940
Scott: But they're also a company that makes entertainment for people and the people like the entertainment the company produces.

102
00:06:53,462 --> 00:07:00,430
Scott: But if the company is profiting they will see less and less reason to take risks and make more interesting Entertainment for the people.

103
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:05,940
Scott: so in a way Them profiting is good for us because they will still be around to make more entertainment.

104
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:09,640
Scott: Oh, but it's bad because they're not making enough.

105
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:15,660
Rym: I have to make a little Clarification because I'm actually looking at a different article from what I read before and the other article was a little confused.

106
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:20,555
Rym: They made a trillion or a trillion yen in revenue and they made 226 billion yen in profit.

107
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:23,750
Rym: Uh-huh, which is still a lot.

108
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:27,360
Scott: That's still a lot of fucking money Yeah, and they've sold to date.

109
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:35,127
Rym: Well in the last year alone 23 million DS units and 123 million software units.

110
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:39,840
Scott: Yeah, see I can only think that like if they weren't profiting they'd be gone.

111
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,780
Scott: There wouldn't be any Nintendo action, right?

112
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:53,319
Scott: But if they were profiting just a little bit, all right or just enough but not crazily like they are profiting then They'd be putting out all kinds of awesome games to try to make more money.

113
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:57,899
Scott: But now because the profits are crazy, we're gonna see a game trout for about a year.

114
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:04,886
Rym: But they sold just shy of six million wheeze and they expect to sell Another 14 million next year.

115
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:07,113
Scott: They've sold at least a million pokemons.

116
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,600
Scott: I mean they pre-ordered half a million pokemons.

117
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:27,784
Scott: Yeah, like a quarter million pokemons in the US alone not counting the Japanese pokemons and that's just one game one game Good God, well for the current fiscal year the company has forecast sales of 22 million more DS's and 130 million more.

118
00:08:27,864 --> 00:08:33,460
Scott: they think it's all 22 million more DS's than have already been sold in this fiscal year alone.

119
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,140
Scott: Oh my god All right.

120
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:42,500
Scott: If anyone is still has their doubts about the DS being the king and the we just being kind of air for the year to come You're wrong.

121
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:50,200
Rym: So despite the fact that Nintendo has made these record profits and these record revenues in these record sales They're predicting a better fiscal year next year.

122
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:55,005
Rym: They're predicting sales to increase Increasingly, you know why?

123
00:08:55,045 --> 00:08:58,560
Scott: because they'll actually have some goddamn games next year to freakin sell.

124
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:03,218
Rym: Well, the thing is the Wii is still selling pretty much on the virtue of we bowling.

125
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:04,774
Scott: Yep That's pretty much all.

126
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,804
Scott: it sell it All right now.

127
00:09:06,227 --> 00:09:08,020
Scott: and Zelda and Zelda and Zelda.

128
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:13,900
Rym: But I think now anyone who wanted like was buying a Wii for Zelda has a Wii and I think most of the people who?

129
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,219
Rym: Are buying wheeze are those you know non gamers who?

130
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,660
Rym: Wii Sports is amazing and they want to get it and it's cheap and it's cool.

131
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,020
Rym: And now they're suddenly into gaming and they'll be satisfied for a long time.

132
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,960
Scott: Yes, it seems like a lot of people are like really happy with their virtual console action.

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,486
Scott: I'm like virtual who's a lot of people are dumb enough to buy all those things mean virtual console money reportedly has gone down But there's still.

134
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:37,613
Scott: it's still crazy high.

135
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:38,880
Scott: how many people are buying those games?

136
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,454
Rym: Well because the it's almost a hundred percent profit.

137
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:42,540
Rym: you already own the property.

138
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:53,965
Scott: It doesn't take much to pour higher to college-aged cheapo Programmers to make sure the game works in the emulator on the Wii and then you put it up on the website And you know what.

139
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:59,196
Rym: considering that they know exactly how the Nintendo worked I don't think it was hard for them to make a Nintendo emulator.

140
00:09:59,216 --> 00:09:59,780
Rym: That was perfect.

141
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:06,508
Scott: I'm pretty sure they already had some lying around because most you know when you play like a GameCube game like for example sonic mega collection.

142
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:14,195
Scott: right sonic mega collection for the GameCube is Basically a bunch of Sonic the Hedgehog games one two three spin ball Sonic and Knuckles etc.

143
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:15,880
Scott: and it's on a GameCube disc.

144
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:17,179
Scott: You know what's on that disc?

145
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,620
Scott: Basically the ROMs of those Sonic games and a Genesis emulator.

146
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:22,803
Scott: That's what's on that disc.

147
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:28,880
Scott: like Midway arcade classics to the head rampart was basically maim on the disc with a rampart ROM.

148
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:30,445
Scott: That's all those things are.

149
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:36,644
Scott: so it's not too hard to put the emulator in this console and then Download the ROMs.

150
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:40,416
Rym: all right, there's a lot of numbers here, and it doesn't even matter.

151
00:10:40,436 --> 00:10:41,580
Rym: so don't even worry about the numbers.

152
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,459
Rym: I said because the point is Nintendo is doing so stupidly well that they could just cancel the Wii.

153
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,843
Rym: right now They could just say all right.

154
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:49,685
Rym: We's done.

155
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:52,695
Rym: No more games, and they still made out like bandits.

156
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:59,634
Scott: Yep all right, so Speaking of consoles the Xbox 360. you know that elite thing that they came out with.

157
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:01,940
Scott: it's the basically the best Xbox elite.

158
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:06,859
Scott: it has a bigger hard drive it has a HDMI hole right and it's black.

159
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,485
Scott: Apparently, it's not so hot.

160
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:11,049
Scott: it costs more than the premium.

161
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,757
Scott: It does have a bigger hard drive, and it is black.

162
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:23,340
Scott: the HDMI According to reports of people just you know subjective You know just people saying what they're all opinion.

163
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:30,839
Scott: Well, you should actually say some guy on the internet says some guy on the internet says the HDMI doesn't look any better than the Not HDMI on the premium.

164
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:42,780
Scott: this thing Is not the greatest buy because it doesn't really offer you anything above the premium Xbox 360 other than increased cost Black plastic and a bigger hard drive, but the black plastic yeah.

165
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,689
Scott: I know well if the bigger hard drive is enough for you.

166
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:52,012
Scott: if the smaller hard drive of the premium was keeping you down And you've got money to burn you really play your Xbox a lot.

167
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:55,263
Scott: you buy the elite and you use the HDMI Which doesn't offer anything.

168
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:56,627
Scott: you buy this thing.

169
00:11:56,928 --> 00:12:03,039
Scott: well now you got to take all your data from your old Xbox hard drive and move It to the new Xbox hard drive.

170
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:07,455
Scott: You can't just take the old Xbox hard drive out and put it in the new Xbox.

171
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:10,024
Rym: that would kind of defeat the point of Having the bigger hard drive.

172
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:14,540
Scott: well not only that but you know it does your old hard drive.

173
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,987
Scott: It's not encased in the black plastic.

174
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:17,877
Scott: It's white, so it's not gonna look too good.

175
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,380
Scott: ah Not only that but all this stuff on your Xbox hard drive is DRM to hell.

176
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,499
Scott: They can't just let you just copy it from one drive to another.

177
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,185
Rym: Drm everybody's friend.

178
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:31,515
Scott: Yeah, I mean it would be easy enough.

179
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:32,358
Scott: I mean it's a USB hard drive.

180
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,520
Scott: I'm pretty sure you could just plug it into your computer and copy all the data from one drive to another.

181
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:38,663
Scott: But this DRM.

182
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:41,031
Scott: so that wouldn't work because you can't copy data.

183
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:44,000
Scott: if you copy it then the DRM locks in and now nothing works.

184
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:53,900
Scott: So if you buy an Xbox 360 elite if you want to transfer your data from your old hard drive to your new hard drive You have to get the Xbox 360 data migration kit.

185
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:57,452
Rym: I like how they say if you want like there are people who don't want to yep

186
00:12:58,014 --> 00:13:07,673
Scott: to get the kit you have to print out a PDF Fill it out with all sorts of numbers from like you know I guess your serial number of your Xbox 360s and stuff like that.

187
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:09,560
Scott: mail it to Indiana.

188
00:13:10,184 --> 00:13:12,800
Scott: They will decide if you should receive a kit or not.

189
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:18,018
Scott: I assume they probably will most of the time and then they will mail you your kit for free.

190
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:18,943
Scott: at least It's free.

191
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:20,754
Rym: decide if I need a kid or not.

192
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:21,498
Scott: yeah, huh?

193
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:35,798
Scott: So Just to let you know if you're thinking about replacing your premium with an elite Which is a stupid waste of money which it wouldn't be a waste of money if the elite at least had Wi-Fi or something But it doesn't even have that it has nothing.

194
00:13:35,838 --> 00:13:36,020
Scott: basically.

195
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,796
Scott: Then you're gonna need to fill out this form and mail it because it says on the form.

196
00:13:41,816 --> 00:13:42,960
Scott: That's a limited time offer.

197
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:45,940
Scott: It's subject to product availability and subject to change without notice.

198
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:49,311
Scott: So this offer might not last very long.

199
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,665
Scott: if you wait too long to buy your elite You might be SOL.

200
00:13:52,705 --> 00:13:59,639
Scott: you might have to pay some money to get the kit or they might not have make kits anymore And you'll have to buy one on eBay from someone for any ludicrous price or who knows.

201
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:12,256
Scott: Just to let you know you people there with your DRM's and your 360 things of the day.

202
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:32,537
Rym: For the last several weeks I've been really trying to have things today that aren't just on dig and I've realized now that That is basically becoming impossible because one either Everything good is already on day I mean anything that is on dig and gets near the top is probably a candidate for being thing of the day Especially if it's a video because that's already like the top 1% of the internet.

203
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:33,943
Rym: But to

204
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:34,725
Scott: any

205
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:40,379
Rym: time I put forth all the effort to find something out there that didn't make it to dig yet It makes it to dig

206
00:14:40,903 --> 00:14:41,204
Scott: Long

207
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:45,879
Rym: before I get a chance to use it as a thing of the day Thus defeating the point of finding it ahead of time.

208
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:53,299
Scott: Yeah I mean a lot of the stuff I find something in the morning to use as a thing of the day that night It's gonna be on dig sometime during the day.

209
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:54,758
Scott: There's there's no way around it.

210
00:14:55,382 --> 00:15:02,099
Scott: And if I find something right before the show by the time you listen to the show You'll see it on dig the next day.

211
00:15:02,622 --> 00:15:04,996
Scott: So unless I make the show I find a thing of the day.

212
00:15:05,016 --> 00:15:08,207
Scott: unless the thing of the day Appears on the internet at like 9 p.m.

213
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:11,236
Scott: I put it in the show and then you listen at midnight.

214
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:14,566
Scott: even then 5050 shot it's gonna be on dig.

215
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:16,132
Scott: So what can we do about it?

216
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:16,814
Rym: Thus?

217
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:18,420
Rym: I'm not even gonna try anymore.

218
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:25,348
Rym: I just I'm gonna use whatever I saw like the original theme of you know things of the day The coolest thing I saw in the last 24 hours.

219
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:28,005
Scott: Yeah, whatever it happens to be.

220
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,530
Scott: We don't care where it comes from.

221
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:34,131
Scott: if it ends up being shit on dig that everyone's seen It's too bad.

222
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:34,679
Scott: That's what we're doing.

223
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:35,543
Rym: Yeah because you know what.

224
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:42,733
Rym: now think of it this way the three of you who complained that all of our news and things of the Day are just farks slash dot dig one.

225
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:44,160
Rym: We don't provide news.

226
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,020
Rym: We provide commentary on news so you can die in a fire.

227
00:15:47,441 --> 00:16:00,138
Rym: See even though you might have already seen the video of the guy getting hit in the nuts or the other guy getting hit in The nuts or the guy falling and then getting hit in the nuts We provide commentary on the video of the guy getting hit in the nuts.

228
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,079
Scott: Oh, man I totally didn't see that that guy was gonna get hit in the nuts.

229
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:07,733
Scott: That was probably the worst hit in the nuts I've ever seen.

230
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:10,100
Scott: I mean you think the testicle like went right back up to where?

231
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:11,023
Scott: I don't know.

232
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:16,018
Rym: Oh, but look at the video it links to at the related videos that guy gets hit in the nuts twice.

233
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:25,139
Rym: Oh Now that aside my thing of the day I had something else like I often do and then I saw this and I thought I was gonna click on it.

234
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,026
Rym: Decide wow, that guy's crazy.

235
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:28,973
Rym: not even bother talking about it and move on.

236
00:16:29,414 --> 00:16:31,120
Rym: It's a long video - it's about eight minutes.

237
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,874
Rym: But I'd recommend you watch the whole thing and it's kind of complicated how I feel about this video.

238
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:36,816
Scott: Basically.

239
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:37,859
Rym: It's a crazy guy.

240
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:41,069
Scott: It's definitely a crazy guy there is no doubt about it.

241
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:49,120
Scott: this guy that crazy like remember the pedophile in Australia Oh god, no, no, not that crazy, but he's definitely a crazy middle-of-the-woods guy.

242
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,880
Rym: He's lucid in the very least and he is intelligent.

243
00:16:52,241 --> 00:17:03,140
Rym: He reminds me a lot of the people who form the Michigan militia and live in the wilds of Michigan Just waiting for the day when they can rise up and restore patriotism and the Constitution.

244
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,792
Scott: Reminds me just like the crazy old man who lives down the road.

245
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:07,220
Scott: He yells at kids to get off his lawn.

246
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:08,428
Scott: That's pretty much what he is.

247
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:10,339
Rym: Well, I knew a lot of people like that in Michigan.

248
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,640
Rym: We're just like this guy, you know get off my property get off my property Constitution.

249
00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:18,911
Rym: But the guy definitely rants in that little bit out of it.

250
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:22,460
Rym: probably really was trying to hide something kind of person.

251
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:24,795
Scott: Yeah, I'm I'm betting 90%.

252
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:25,560
Scott: he's hiding something.

253
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:26,949
Rym: I wouldn't be surprised.

254
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:32,900
Rym: if the follow-up to this is yeah They got a court order and bodies as far as the eye can see brass murder.

255
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,934
Scott: It could be it very well could be but that's not the point.

256
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:37,180
Rym: but the situation.

257
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:52,720
Rym: Then the reason I find it so interesting is that there are three actors in this situation actor number one the main character the Unseen voice behind the camera the crazy guy basically a crazy middle-of-the-woods guy who they was on my property.

258
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:53,770
Rym: I has my rights.

259
00:17:54,133 --> 00:18:01,339
Rym: that kind of person Yep, the kind of person who knows and has memorized every law that will ever help them get away with something shady.

260
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:17,080
Rym: Actor number two the stupid police officer who's not entirely stupid, but he spends most of the video mouth-breathing Obviously not fully understanding what's going on and obviously not wanting to be involved.

261
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:28,910
Rym: Yep, and then actor number three the angry frustrated and yet somewhat not understanding possibly of the law Federal or state bureaucrat whatever.

262
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:29,312
Scott: Yep.

263
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:31,500
Scott: She's some health inspector lady of some sort.

264
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:34,340
Scott: She's trying to inspect this guy's property.

265
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,219
Scott: She tried to inspect the property before and he didn't let her on the property because doesn't have to.

266
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:47,103
Rym: Now the situation is basically that she'd come and tried to inspect his property and she said I'm from the government You have to let me on.

267
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:52,118
Rym: and the guy who obviously knows his rights said, where's your warrants?

268
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:54,324
Rym: Yep Where's your court order?

269
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:56,249
Rym: Where's some sort of document?

270
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,037
Scott: while he's a crazy guy probably hiding something.

271
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:02,407
Scott: He's right Crazy guys aren't always wrong.

272
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:06,060
Rym: Yeah, I mean the woman didn't have a court order or anything.

273
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:14,756
Rym: So unless there's some crazy law in this state that allows this or something We don't know about and if there is such a law, it's probably an unconstitutional law.

274
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:15,218
Scott: We'll see.

275
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:15,720
Scott: We'll see.

276
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:16,643
Rym: We don't really know.

277
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:21,140
Rym: No, but the point is that this woman didn't seem to have any sort of backing on her side.

278
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:28,460
Scott: I mean the guy is like could have been like imagine if some state health inspector Right has the state health inspector badge like our friend Pete, right?

279
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:30,268
Scott: What if they just show up at your house?

280
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,000
Scott: Like how do they know she's even on the job?

281
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,319
Scott: This is even assignment.

282
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,900
Scott: She could just be someone who has the job of inspector with a badge using it to sneak onto your property.

283
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:54,105
Rym: Well, actually when I worked for the feds back in hot like right after high school my first job I had it wasn't a metal badge but I had a badge that said that I was a federal employee and blah blah blah and I Totally could have scammed people into letting me do so.

284
00:19:54,165 --> 00:19:55,247
Rym: all sorts of things with that.

285
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,390
Rym: Yeah, I was a jackass.

286
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:03,390
Scott: Yeah, so without a warrant or something I don't think that he should have to let her on his property no matter how crazy or nutty he is.

287
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:04,550
Rym: I wouldn't have let her on my property.

288
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:12,663
Rym: I also would not have little thing is if she had come back with an argument along the lines of like Here's the law that says I have the right to come on your property.

289
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:14,090
Rym: It is a section blah, whatever.

290
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,338
Scott: Oh, here's a court order signed by a judge.

291
00:20:16,418 --> 00:20:18,184
Scott: Here's a warrant for searching.

292
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,950
Rym: then I would have let him on and this.

293
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:26,690
Rym: This guy probably would have to yeah, or he would have gone nuts with the shotgun, but we're not sure I don't know because he didn't go nuts of the shotgun in the video.

294
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,550
Scott: So I don't think he was ever gonna go nuts of the shotgun.

295
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:33,510
Scott: He was going nuts of the video camera, which is pretty good because that means he's not that crazy.

296
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:34,395
Scott: But the.

297
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:46,507
Rym: basically the woman is saying I'm allowed to be here I'm allowed to trespass and look at your shit and the guys saying according to this specific law that I've memorized and this part of the Indiana State Constitution that I also have memorized

298
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,054
Scott: and the federal Constitution of the United States of America, you do

299
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:50,876
Rym: not have this right.

300
00:20:51,056 --> 00:20:51,517
Scott: you do not.

301
00:20:51,878 --> 00:20:55,109
Rym: and the police officer is trying to convince the guy.

302
00:20:55,169 --> 00:21:01,960
Rym: the police officer seems to know that He doesn't have the right because one the cop is smart and dumb at the same time.

303
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,040
Rym: I point out that the cop very pointedly does not step on the guy's property.

304
00:21:07,189 --> 00:21:13,372
Scott: Yes You might not realize but in most states The there is like a certain number of feet varying by town or state.

305
00:21:13,392 --> 00:21:17,087
Scott: wherever you live in from the street That is not your property.

306
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:19,839
Scott: For example, for example, my parents house, right?

307
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,905
Scott: Their house borders Street.

308
00:21:22,005 --> 00:21:23,349
Scott: their driveway touches the street.

309
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:28,379
Scott: the grass that is within 10 feet of that Street belongs to the town.

310
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:35,268
Scott: so at one point in time there was a tree on that part of the Property that was dead and gonna fall over.

311
00:21:35,689 --> 00:21:39,240
Scott: the town had to cut it down for free because it was on the town's property.

312
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:44,580
Scott: However, if the town decides to make the street wider not much my parents can do about it.

313
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,100
Scott: Also, my parents are responsible for mowing that grass.

314
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,740
Scott: You can't just not mow it or else the town comes and yells at you for not maintaining the property.

315
00:21:52,033 --> 00:22:04,099
Rym: Yep I knew a lot of people who had property where they basically have a gigantic yard But half of the yard was in a federal or a state easement and the deal was basically they get to use the property do Whatever they want with it and a lot of cases they could even fence it in.

316
00:22:04,502 --> 00:22:06,520
Rym: They just weren't allowed to build anything on it.

317
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,948
Rym: And if they did that's fine that your mailbox can go there But the state could tear it down if they ever wanted to.

318
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:15,720
Rym: yep, and my grandparents had a. it was a military thing.

319
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:24,999
Rym: Cuz there's a military base nearby Where the government could at any time if they wanted to it was already in all the deeds and all the land Build a road that went between all these houses where they lived.

320
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,289
Scott: Yeah, so this cop despite saying a lot of stupid things.

321
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:36,160
Rym: He doesn't leave the easement and he is very smart Yes, and the woman seems to be like well you gonna help me and the cops like you're on your own lady.

322
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:38,030
Scott: Yeah, it's like I'm not like.

323
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,598
Rym: I'm not gonna stop you, but I'm not gonna.

324
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:47,524
Rym: But the thing is the cop keeps trying to convince the guy with the argument of if you got nothing to hide Just let her in.

325
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:48,809
Rym: cuz you got nothing to hide.

326
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,535
Rym: and while the guy's crazy.

327
00:22:50,795 --> 00:22:52,160
Rym: He responds to that aptly.

328
00:22:52,743 --> 00:22:55,054
Rym: Yeah, and we don't need to talk about this anymore.

329
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,240
Rym: Just watch the video.

330
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:11,400
Rym: It's kind of fascinating because the interaction of the stupid cop the woman who didn't have all her papers in order and the crazy yet Lucid freedom guy is really this intricate dance that probably is going to end in some sort of fun follow-up on FARC.

331
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:19,360
Scott: Yeah It's just so weird to watch something with a crazy guy and I'm usually would be against the crazy guy and this health inspector lady.

332
00:23:19,742 --> 00:23:24,080
Scott: I imagine she is inspecting something and it's probably a violation and I would want that violation.

333
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:26,453
Scott: Yeah, cuz the guys like guys obviously up to no good.

334
00:23:26,514 --> 00:23:27,620
Rym: I'm just moving dirt around.

335
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,200
Rym: I'm just moving dirt around and I keep thinking yep mass graves.

336
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:35,660
Scott: Yeah, this guy's doing something bad on his property and this lady's gonna find out and get him and that's what she should do.

337
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:41,031
Scott: but at the same time You can't go on the dude's property without a warrant.

338
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:41,975
Rym: plus this hell.

339
00:23:42,176 --> 00:23:43,160
Rym: how smart is this guy?

340
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,780
Rym: He makes a point of getting them to present their badges and names and he refers to the officer by name.

341
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:53,200
Scott: Yeah pointedly so it's all recorded and he's got the comes out with a video camera.

342
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,625
Scott: He's he's he's not like.

343
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:58,459
Scott: it's not even like one of those low-res and he's pointing the camera in the wrong place.

344
00:23:58,499 --> 00:24:01,328
Scott: videos It's like he's got everything that you need to see covered.

345
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:02,813
Rym: You mean like all those videos of.

346
00:24:03,254 --> 00:24:04,779
Rym: oh, I captured a video of a UFO.

347
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:13,588
Scott: Yeah, I imagine that his video is gonna hold up in court and all those pictures that the health inspector lady took are not going To be allowed to be submitted as evidence.

348
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,980
Scott: So that's just my guess as a non lawyer.

349
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:18,060
Rym: Well, we have a lot of lawyer listeners.

350
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:29,440
Scott: So if any of you lawyer listeners are also residents of Indiana If you can shed some light on this or you know Look it up in your law database what the law is in Indiana for health inspectors coming on your property.

351
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,327
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

352
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:35,362
Rym: I kind of side with the crazy guy just because I Mean the cops.

353
00:24:35,382 --> 00:24:39,140
Rym: I was like just be polite and the guy makes a point of I don't have to be polite.

354
00:24:39,602 --> 00:24:44,020
Scott: Yeah, I mean he starts out a little bit polite, but then you know, he's he's sort of crazy.

355
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:46,660
Scott: So he's as polite as a crazy guy can be I imagine.

356
00:24:47,242 --> 00:24:50,958
Rym: Yeah, he's less crazy than a lot of people I've seen in the Bronx every day.

357
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:53,169
Scott: Yep All right, so my thing of the day.

358
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:55,220
Scott: I have for you a video game.

359
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,367
Scott: Would you believe that a whole video game?

360
00:24:57,387 --> 00:24:58,069
Scott: Uh-huh.

361
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,236
Scott: In fact, it's a free video game.

362
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:01,360
Scott: You could download and play.

363
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:02,082
Rym: Oh, where's that?

364
00:25:02,423 --> 00:25:04,450
Scott: No, I tried to play it in wine.

365
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,152
Scott: It didn't work.

366
00:25:05,413 --> 00:25:06,957
Scott: So if you got windows you can play this.

367
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,960
Scott: I Rebooted to play it and I'm glad I rebooted to play it.

368
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,031
Scott: I actually rebooted to play it like a couple weeks ago and I forgot about it.

369
00:25:14,754 --> 00:25:17,799
Scott: The game is called acid bomb to Rearm.

370
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:19,347
Rym: Was there an acid bomb?

371
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:19,769
Rym: one?

372
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,578
Scott: there probably was I think there was.

373
00:25:21,598 --> 00:25:24,742
Rym: I mean It's like when I was a kid and we always saw Street Fighter 2.

374
00:25:24,742 --> 00:25:27,012
Rym: No one really had ever seen Street Fighter 1.

375
00:25:27,012 --> 00:25:28,980
Rym: So as far as we were concerned there never was one.

376
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,006
Rym: It just started with two.

377
00:25:30,046 --> 00:25:30,570
Scott: Well, there was.

378
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,053
Scott: you've seen it.

379
00:25:31,093 --> 00:25:32,119
Rym: I know I've seen it now.

380
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:33,825
Rym: In fact, we you ran a tournament.

381
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:49,317
Scott: I did anyway as there was an acid bomb one that I never played and I know nothing about acid bomb 2 is It's an independent kind of fun unique sort of video game and that it combines pycross and minesweeper.

382
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,960
Scott: Basically, you have this grid right and some of the squares on the grid might have bombs and the rest are just blank.

383
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,100
Scott: You don't care about them, right?

384
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:11,543
Scott: So there's some weird shape and you have a crosshair and the crosshair is a vertical bar that's completely across the whole top straight from top to bottom of the whole map and Left and right from all the way to the left all the way to the right and you can aim it at any square You want.

385
00:26:12,146 --> 00:26:14,660
Scott: let's say you aim it at the top left square, right?

386
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:21,600
Scott: Now that's going to obviously cover the up and down row that is on the left and the horizontal row that is on the top.

387
00:26:22,201 --> 00:26:37,260
Scott: the game will tell you a number the number of bombs that are covered by the widths and lengths of this crosshair and You move the crosshair around watching that number change as you move it and you have to figure out where the bombs are.

388
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:43,720
Scott: Aha, it was actually really fun and they threw in a lot of curveballs and a lot of different sort of levels.

389
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,651
Scott: Like there were biological levels and there were.

390
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,314
Scott: there were levels.

391
00:26:47,354 --> 00:26:48,800
Scott: like you you you know a minesweeper.

392
00:26:48,921 --> 00:26:50,715
Scott: You can put a flag to say this is not a bomb.

393
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:51,219
Scott: This is safe.

394
00:26:51,684 --> 00:26:53,019
Scott: There are levels so they don't let you do that.

395
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:56,400
Scott: There are levels where like more bombs will appear if you wait too long.

396
00:26:56,862 --> 00:27:00,460
Scott: There are all kinds of cool things and the game started out easy and fun.

397
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:06,760
Scott: It quickly got more challenging and I got like 80% of the way to the end and then I stopped.

398
00:27:07,202 --> 00:27:14,573
Scott: But if you have windows and you have a free half hour You should download this and play it cuz it's better than mine.

399
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,580
Scott: sweeper and pie cross combined.

400
00:27:16,962 --> 00:27:18,390
Rym: What about World of Warcraft?

401
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,100
Rym: How does it compare to World of Warcraft?

402
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:29,260
Scott: It's not even the same genre But it's definitely more worth your time to spend a half hour playing this than to spend a half hour in Azeroth.

403
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:29,944
Rym: Oh, okay.

404
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,273
Rym: Just wanted to make sure.

405
00:27:31,354 --> 00:27:34,321
Scott: yeah, that's definitely So.

406
00:27:34,843 --> 00:27:42,819
Rym: talking about board games like as we've been back into board gaming a lot and we've been playing a lot of our board games Entirely to death to the point that they're not fun anymore.

407
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:50,000
Scott: Yeah, it's at the point in which you have to buy expensive board games Which we're not sure if they're good or not in order to just take a chance cuz we need a game real bad.

408
00:27:50,261 --> 00:28:00,259
Rym: What we really need to do is just get more people to move in with us because we've played out all the two-player games and all the three-player games and Once we get another person we can play out all the four-player games.

409
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:06,000
Rym: However, the game we're about to talk about Vinci is a three to six player game.

410
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:12,380
Scott: Yeah, we actually talked about this game once before in an episode of GeekNights But it was an episode where he talked about a whole lot of crap.

411
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:18,940
Scott: So we're gonna concentrate now on the whole game of Vinci and go into the details that we probably missed in that other episode.

412
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,408
Scott: Of course, I didn't re-listen to that other episode.

413
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:25,080
Scott: So I have no idea how much we talked about Vinci, but I don't care either.

414
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:28,089
Rym: That's fine because Vinci is still one of my favorite games.

415
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,915
Scott: Vinci is a damn good game.

416
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:32,479
Rym: It's in my top 10 or 15 easily.

417
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:36,529
Scott: Yeah, I say top 15 definitely 10 maybe.

418
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:46,547
Rym: well partly because a lot of my games that would be in there I've decided or discovered that they are flawed or I've otherwise solved them and once the game is solved It's really not fun anymore.

419
00:28:46,608 --> 00:28:51,820
Rym: like settlers is a great game But I can't put it in my top 10 because it's not a great game anymore.

420
00:28:52,662 --> 00:28:54,988
Scott: So Vinci is a civilization game.

421
00:28:55,128 --> 00:28:58,917
Scott: You've got Europe and the surrounding bits mostly Europe.

422
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:10,315
Scott: Yep, and overtime civilizations rise and fall and they rise and they fall and Some are big and some are small and some last a long time and some last not so long.

423
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:16,573
Scott: and some are really good at Mounting and some are really good at fighting and some are really good at farming and whatever.

424
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:24,719
Scott: and over the course of this game each player Build civilizations and then lets them go in order to build newer civilizations.

425
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:41,897
Rym: now I think this is a really cool mechanic where you build a civilization and it has powers whatever and you move around the board in a Deterministic taking things from other players or from barbarians way and then Whenever you think your empire has either been totally butt-fucked by someone which happens fairly often

426
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:44,586
Scott: pretty often in Everyone's good at playing or

427
00:29:44,626 --> 00:29:50,185
Rym: it's peaked or whatever reason you choose not to just get rid of it and start a new one But to decline it.

428
00:29:50,526 --> 00:29:53,940
Rym: it falls into decline much like the Roman or Byzantine empires, right?

429
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,188
Scott: So let's say I don't have any special things right.

430
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:00,866
Scott: I build an empire that is ten countries large ten Areas on the map large.

431
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:04,680
Scott: I'm getting ten points a turn from that without anything special, right?

432
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:07,146
Scott: So I decide you know what?

433
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:10,980
Scott: There's not really any way that I can expand this empire, you know.

434
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:16,480
Scott: It's because nothing increases in military might over time except medicine except medicine.

435
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:29,000
Scott: If unless you have medicine You're pretty much your strength of your civilization does not increase it can only you just use the power that it has to Expand over the course of a few turns and then you just can't expand anymore.

436
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,393
Scott: You can move around but you can't get any bigger unless you have medicine.

437
00:30:33,754 --> 00:30:35,640
Scott: So the sieve has reached this max.

438
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,128
Scott: I got ten spaces.

439
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:37,892
Scott: It can't get bigger.

440
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:47,740
Scott: I say alright, I'm declining I put little Crumbling pillars and all those ten spaces and that's place still gets me ten points because it's still ten spaces that belong to me.

441
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,712
Rym: Yep, but now you can't do anything with it.

442
00:30:49,753 --> 00:30:50,799
Scott: I can't do anything with it.

443
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:53,780
Scott: It's just a. it's just a bunch of stuff on the board that gets me points.

444
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,508
Scott: It doesn't do anything much like the later Byzantine Empire.

445
00:30:56,588 --> 00:31:00,800
Rym: It exists slow solely to be slowly picked apart by all the other players.

446
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:07,177
Scott: Yep, everyone else will pick it apart But you hope they pick it apart less quickly because you're still getting points from it.

447
00:31:07,217 --> 00:31:07,920
Scott: Just not that many.

448
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:14,940
Scott: Meanwhile after I decline that Empire I make a new civilization that hopefully will get me many many points.

449
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:21,744
Scott: Hopefully it will get me many many points while the old one still exists so that I can get a whole lot of points For both at once.

450
00:31:22,025 --> 00:31:34,579
Rym: so the game goes around where each player will get an empire build it interact with all the other players and then everyone chooses in a cycle when to decline and start new empires and Sometimes a bunch of people all decline at once.

451
00:31:34,941 --> 00:31:37,649
Rym: Sometimes one guy just gets screwed and has to decline early.

452
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,000
Rym: Sometimes one guy just does really well in declines of his own volition.

453
00:31:41,883 --> 00:31:42,813
Rym: Actually, it's really funny.

454
00:31:42,853 --> 00:31:51,112
Rym: several times We basically you really get into this game with a theme because you know, you see oh Those are obviously the fins or ah, that's the Romans.

455
00:31:51,152 --> 00:31:53,440
Rym: just the way the board sets up for the powers they ever way.

456
00:31:53,500 --> 00:32:01,187
Scott: I mean if some guy starts his civilization coming in on England and then he takes over France it's like ha ha ha ha ha ha as

457
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,292
Rym: opposed to ha

458
00:32:02,312 --> 00:32:03,899
Scott: ha ha ha ha yes,

459
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:12,399
Rym: but Many times we end up having a dark age where suddenly it'll go around and everyone will decline and the entire board just falls into darkness and decay.

460
00:32:13,402 --> 00:32:15,035
Scott: It's fun quite fun.

461
00:32:15,256 --> 00:32:23,620
Rym: Yeah granted We really get into our board games But I think that anyone who enjoys board games really and truly enjoys them gets into games like that.

462
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,815
Rym: You have to have your little sticks your little playing around and that's what German board gaming is about.

463
00:32:27,896 --> 00:32:30,265
Scott: a guy wrote an article recently Saying y'all got a brick.

464
00:32:30,446 --> 00:32:33,640
Scott: Yeah, he's like what's the difference between abstract games and euro games?

465
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,280
Scott: He's like pretty pictures painted on the on the board, you know.

466
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:42,340
Scott: And the thing is while I'm usually the kind of person who says it's all about the gameplay.

467
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,649
Scott: The theme is whatever when you play a German board game.

468
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:57,818
Scott: It's not so much the theme itself that makes the game better It's it's the fact that the way the players interact with the theme to add another layer of entertainment above the gameplay itself.

469
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:04,200
Rym: and Every gaming group seems to have its own little bits and its own little inside things or ways they get into games.

470
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:12,580
Scott: Yeah I mean range from just Calling the pieces of the game pieces from other games like a different name than what it's supposed to be called.

471
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:14,595
Scott: Like imagine if you're playing I don't know.

472
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:15,300
Scott: Let's think of an American.

473
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,852
Rym: Well, it's like you're playing Monopoly and you don't call it boardwalk.

474
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:19,474
Rym: You call it.

475
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:21,020
Rym: I don't know something else.

476
00:33:21,281 --> 00:33:24,654
Scott: Yeah, or you don't call it, you know free parking.

477
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:26,280
Scott: you call it the car crash.

478
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,012
Rym: We tend to go around in a cycle like in Puerto Rico.

479
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:30,880
Rym: There's a governor and an ammon ray.

480
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,120
Rym: There's the Pharaoh but we tend to call the governor the Pharaoh and the Pharaoh the governor.

481
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:39,860
Scott: Yeah, we just are like in in El El Grande.

482
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:43,840
Scott: There's a guy who's the king but you just call him the penis cuz it looks like a giant penis.

483
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:45,840
Rym: Well, it looks like a very small penis.

484
00:33:45,961 --> 00:33:49,340
Scott: Yes, but it's like, you know, and we're not allowed to touch the king in El Grande.

485
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,980
Scott: So you say don't touch the penis and I love such a penis under any circumstance.

486
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:55,889
Rym: The thing is people don't get that rule no matter how many time.

487
00:33:55,909 --> 00:34:01,365
Rym: whenever we're playing with someone always tries to do something with the penis And it's always like.

488
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:03,954
Rym: it was the only rule you had to remember.

489
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:05,420
Rym: Yeah, it was the first one.

490
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:07,409
Scott: So in Vinci there's quite a bit of that.

491
00:34:07,449 --> 00:34:23,454
Scott: because when you get a new civilization basically there's a bag and the bag has little chits in it and on each chit is a civilization trait such as livestock breeding or field general or fortification agriculture something like that.

492
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:29,445
Scott: and you draw these out of the bag in sets of two and each set of two is a civilization.

493
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:33,650
Scott: and when you get a new civilization You pick one of the available sets of two.

494
00:34:34,132 --> 00:34:37,739
Scott: if it's been sitting out there for a while You can just take it without any worries.

495
00:34:38,165 --> 00:34:41,369
Scott: If it's a new one You kind of have to pay victory points to get it.

496
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,179
Scott: this gives you sort of a bit early in the game.

497
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:54,440
Scott: It adds a little randomness but later in the game it evens out because now Civilizations that nobody wanted are now very enticing because you might even get points just for taking them.

498
00:34:54,701 --> 00:35:11,191
Rym: It's very much a well-constructed built-in balance system because the powers that Civilizations can get are definitely not all equal and civilization combinations can be stupidly powerful or Stupidly useless, but you can.

499
00:35:11,472 --> 00:35:18,396
Rym: the game will always increase the incentive Continuously to take a bad civilization and in the end it's not that bad.

500
00:35:18,437 --> 00:35:20,266
Rym: because alright So I've got.

501
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:31,280
Scott: you'll have a choice between taking a badass civilization but having to pay 10 victory points to get it before someone else does or Taking a shitty civilization that's been sitting there since the beginning of the game.

502
00:35:31,642 --> 00:35:35,620
Scott: But if you take it you get 10 points, that's a tough call right there.

503
00:35:35,861 --> 00:35:48,620
Rym: It also adds a lot of strategy where you might want to decline But you don't want any of the civilizations out or what I do often is there's a civilization you want But it's too far out on the track and too expensive.

504
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:51,979
Rym: You only got to wait for other people to decline before you can get it.

505
00:35:52,361 --> 00:35:54,320
Rym: But you got to hope that no one just pays the price.

506
00:35:54,581 --> 00:35:56,795
Rym: But then again if they do pay the price then you get some victory points.

507
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:57,640
Rym: You don't care anymore.

508
00:35:57,942 --> 00:36:00,600
Scott: Yep, it's really a tough balancing act.

509
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:08,760
Scott: But anyway, each civilization has these traits and these traits, you know Put slight modifiers and how that particular civilization is going to work.

510
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:18,147
Scott: It determines how much the military might of the civilization how far it can expand how quickly it can expand and In what ways it can expand.

511
00:36:18,187 --> 00:36:19,372
Scott: for example astronomy.

512
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:29,827
Scott: if your civilization has astronomy You can just expand all over the place because you can take the water for free because you can navigate whereas people without astronomy Can't really go over the water that much

513
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:30,630
Rym: at all

514
00:36:31,312 --> 00:36:36,416
Scott: and they have to basically keep conquering adjacent land Civilization countries not civilization.

515
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:53,033
Scott: Yeah so these traits add a lot of fun to the game because you get let's say you get barbarians and Mountaineering and you start in much prefer barbarians Barbarians, yes, and you start in Norway you go.

516
00:36:53,193 --> 00:36:53,977
Scott: Hahaha.

517
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:54,800
Scott: We are to Viking.

518
00:36:54,941 --> 00:36:59,179
Scott: Hahaha, we get you we crush you from the north and it is quite fun.

519
00:36:59,681 --> 00:37:04,115
Rym: I think the best description of all the powers is the barbarian one because it gives you a lot of guys.

520
00:37:04,576 --> 00:37:07,524
Rym: and the description is Barbarians have no special powers.

521
00:37:07,765 --> 00:37:09,048
Rym: There are just a lot of them.

522
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:09,830
Rym: Yep.

523
00:37:11,053 --> 00:37:18,240
Rym: I The board is a lot like risk, in fact, it's almost exactly like without dice though.

524
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:22,072
Rym: Yeah, I'm the board not think I'm saying the board very specifically.

525
00:37:22,112 --> 00:37:22,734
Rym: I said the board.

526
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:23,737
Rym: All right, wait a minute.

527
00:37:23,757 --> 00:37:24,018
Rym: Listen.

528
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:31,060
Rym: Yeah Anyway, so the board is a lot like risk and you have your little tokens that you put on the territories.

529
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,760
Rym: How many guys you have there, but when you want to conquer a place it is straight-up deterministic.

530
00:37:36,142 --> 00:37:46,370
Rym: It costs you X guys and by cost I mean you have to put X guys down on that place in order to take it and you can expand to your heart Content until you run out of guys for that round.

531
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,100
Rym: then you pick all your guys up and reconsolidate however you want.

532
00:37:49,481 --> 00:37:51,226
Rym: So no because it's really simple.

533
00:37:51,307 --> 00:37:52,229
Rym: basically it costs.

534
00:37:52,590 --> 00:38:10,460
Rym: in order to take a place you have to have two guys there minimum plus one for every guy the opponent has there plus any Modifiers like if it's a mountain or a forest which are harder to take or it has a fortress there minus any other modifiers Like if you have weapons or you're attacking from the mountain and all sorts of things like that.

535
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:16,260
Rym: And if you put the number of guys down, that's it and you took it and the other person has to take their guys up.

536
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:19,008
Scott: Yeah If they had one guy there that guy dies.

537
00:38:19,108 --> 00:38:23,705
Scott: if they had two guys there one guy dies and the other guy they get to Put in one of their other places.

538
00:38:23,965 --> 00:38:27,777
Scott: Yeah, if there are three guys there one guy dies pretty much always.

539
00:38:28,078 --> 00:38:28,720
Scott: one guy dies.

540
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:30,759
Rym: Anytime you take an opponent's place.

541
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:39,988
Rym: One of the pit guys that they have left there is lost from their army or their civilization Forever until they decline and pick a new one.

542
00:38:40,249 --> 00:38:43,017
Rym: now think you'll start with maybe I don't know 12 14 guys total.

543
00:38:44,581 --> 00:38:47,248
Rym: Unless you have medicine you'll never have more than that.

544
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:54,229
Rym: every time you lose a territory your civilization has been irrevocably weakened Yep, and it's never gonna get stronger.

545
00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:55,915
Scott: medicine is the only exception.

546
00:38:55,955 --> 00:39:02,075
Scott: if your civilization has medicine It increases by one guy every turn just one.

547
00:39:02,095 --> 00:39:03,860
Scott: that might seem pretty good.

548
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:13,077
Scott: You have a civilization that grows in a game where civilizations can only shrink and it can help But if your civilization doesn't last very long, it's not gonna help that much.

549
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:29,980
Rym: the problem I see most people having with medicine is that they tend to use it and Despite having medicine which is good and you want to hold on to that civilization for a long time They hold on to a civilization longer than they should have just because they feel like they should because they have medicine

550
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:30,582
Scott: Yep,

551
00:39:30,964 --> 00:39:37,680
Rym: well a big part of this game is knowing when to just cut and run just figuring out Alright, this civilization is not doing anything for me.

552
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,068
Rym: I gotta dump it now cuz the I.

553
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:43,680
Scott: the key way to win the game is you want to you gonna get many.

554
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,626
Rym: He went away to win.

555
00:39:44,647 --> 00:39:45,775
Rym: the game is to be Alex.

556
00:39:45,956 --> 00:39:47,363
Scott: That's true But you want it.

557
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:51,660
Scott: the way the game works is it's not whoever has the most points after so many turns wins.

558
00:39:51,941 --> 00:39:54,839
Scott: it's the first person to get X points wins.

559
00:39:54,859 --> 00:40:00,304
Scott: and Let's say the guy who goes first You know the first player Crosses the line.

560
00:40:00,325 --> 00:40:03,637
Scott: then everyone else still gets to take their turn to see if they can jump ahead.

561
00:40:03,677 --> 00:40:06,929
Scott: that way ever gets an equal Number of turns, but it's a race.

562
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:10,522
Scott: So you want to get points is not just a lot of them But quickly.

563
00:40:10,643 --> 00:40:15,900
Scott: so a plan that gets a few points early on and then a bunch later is not so good.

564
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:34,785
Scott: you want to get points constantly all the time non-stop and The way to do that is you want to get one civilization on the board because you start the game blank and then you decline it and you get another civilization on the board and that lets you get points from the declining civilization and your current civilization Simultaneously.

565
00:40:34,805 --> 00:40:41,800
Scott: then when the old civilization is starting to get smaller You decline the one you've got and you're bringing a new one and you try to balance it.

566
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:48,020
Scott: So you're always getting points from a declining and a current civilization at all times if you can keep that up.

567
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:59,226
Scott: Usually it's unrealistic to keep that up at full steam the whole game But get as close to that as you can and that's the way to get as many points as possible and Cross the line before the other players do.

568
00:40:59,627 --> 00:41:15,530
Rym: now one really fun thing about this game because it's really rare in most German or euro Style board games is that unlike most other games there is direct straight-up man-to-man Fucking of players by other players and not the sexual kind.

569
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:17,816
Rym: you will have options that it.

570
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:18,818
Rym: I mean some games.

571
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:21,593
Rym: you can hurt another Player but it always hurts you too or isn't optimal.

572
00:41:21,955 --> 00:41:35,180
Rym: in this game not only is it okay to just straight-up attack other players all the time or to Purposefully knock someone out of the game for a round, but it is often the best way to win.

573
00:41:35,642 --> 00:41:42,210
Rym: Yeah, in fact when we first started playing this game because we were used to playing Puerto Rico Sometimes the game even just forces you to hurt other people.

574
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:52,260
Rym: Yeah, you have no choice, but all these other games we were playing We really were very Congenial to each other and we very much like people wouldn't step on each other's toes.

575
00:41:52,380 --> 00:42:03,280
Rym: We'd all get like I'll build over here and you build over here and there wasn't a lot of fighting because he always felt like In any other game whenever you directly attack another player Usually you just weaken yourself and them and then some other player wins.

576
00:42:03,408 --> 00:42:04,302
Scott: Yeah It's generally.

577
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:14,980
Scott: other games seem to have a lot stronger prisoners dilemma mechanic where if everyone just cooperates and no one fucks anyone We can all get a lot of points and this will become a game of who gets the most points.

578
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:18,500
Scott: And if anyone decides to just you know screw everyone.

579
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:27,240
Scott: It's gonna really does not turn out well for them and the one guy who stays out of it It's like let's say me Rym and Alex are playing a game right and I attack Rym.

580
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,695
Scott: Well that hurts Rym and it hurts me and Alex wins and Vinci.

581
00:42:30,996 --> 00:42:31,820
Scott: that is not the case.

582
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,219
Scott: The prisoners dilemma is not an accurate model at all.

583
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:45,020
Rym: Yep in fact in Vinci pretty much you have to always screw other players particularly whoever's doing better than you as Hard as you can as much as you can while simultaneously getting points for yourself.

584
00:42:45,461 --> 00:42:48,108
Rym: it is a game that I will say right now.

585
00:42:48,729 --> 00:43:02,368
Rym: if you cannot distance yourself from a game emotionally or if you were the kind of person who Takes it personally if another player like straight up just says I am going to ruin you and then ruins you in a game You can't play Vinci.

586
00:43:02,408 --> 00:43:03,474
Rym: You will not like it.

587
00:43:03,555 --> 00:43:04,420
Scott: You will not like that.

588
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,580
Scott: I mean there was one game I remember where I declined a civilization and I came off the board.

589
00:43:09,781 --> 00:43:13,940
Scott: I selected a new civilization that had quite as large military power.

590
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:18,719
Scott: Alex came on to the board and again the board goes around and then it was my turn.

591
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:18,960
Scott: again.

592
00:43:19,522 --> 00:43:28,099
Scott: There was really no option for me to come on to the board in a way that would get me a lot of points because like You can't go near your declining civilization I'm not gonna get into the rules of it.

593
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,500
Scott: But needless to say the best option for me was to come into the board in the exact same spot.

594
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:44,100
Scott: Alex had just come into the board and I came into the board so strongly I Completely eliminated his entire brand new civilization that existed for only one time.

595
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,993
Rym: I remember when it happened and we're all sitting there looking at.

596
00:43:47,034 --> 00:43:50,791
Rym: he just says well shit Yeah, it was just I declined.

597
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:52,700
Scott: I took all of his guys off the board.

598
00:43:53,121 --> 00:44:00,523
Scott: he could either try to come on the board again with his remaining pieces at which like five of them were dead or Declined.

599
00:44:00,543 --> 00:44:10,620
Scott: I basically made him lose an entire turn which is huge Absolutely huge and for me it didn't bother me at all because I put my guys on the board.

600
00:44:10,721 --> 00:44:12,270
Scott: I was gonna put him on the board somewhere.

601
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:16,197
Scott: I got him all on the board So you got as many points as they could have gotten now.

602
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,239
Rym: That's another really fun thing about this game.

603
00:44:18,641 --> 00:44:34,659
Rym: the board is set up to where different areas of the board are laid out kind of differently and have different strengths and weaknesses and Depending on the civilizations that come out some areas become more or less desirable or more or less Defensible or more or less point worthy depending on what's out there.

604
00:44:35,121 --> 00:44:38,491
Rym: So say there's three civilizations that all need agriculture.

605
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:43,727
Rym: now all the places where there's agriculture nearby Become hotly contested and dangerous to be in.

606
00:44:44,129 --> 00:44:50,171
Scott: yeah, but you can also look at the available civilizations and say wow There's three agriculture civilizations.

607
00:44:50,231 --> 00:44:51,316
Rym: I'm not playing that game.

608
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:52,039
Scott: I'm gonna take the.

609
00:44:53,283 --> 00:45:05,893
Scott: Even though it might not be as good as civilization I'm going to take the livestock civilization So I don't have to deal with that shit and it might actually get you more points even though Judging from a you know a general standpoint.

610
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,340
Scott: It's not as good as civilization.

611
00:45:07,481 --> 00:45:09,087
Scott: It doesn't have as much military might.

612
00:45:09,468 --> 00:45:22,899
Scott: it doesn't have as much point bonus potential but for the situation that the game is currently in it might actually be Superior in terms of how well you can defend with it how long it will last and how many points it will net you in.

613
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:35,260
Rym: Now like I said before one of the really strong points of this game is also that it has three to six players Which is great because most games are four player or there's the few five player ones.

614
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:45,859
Scott: But having game player and games that are like most games will be three four or five players and some of them like only work Well with like four and like the three and the five are kind of hackneyed.

615
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,060
Rym: Yeah, like Tigers New Freighties is three to four or two to four depending on what version you have even though they're the same.

616
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,566
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't work at all.

617
00:45:52,626 --> 00:45:54,755
Rym: two player and it works really crappily.

618
00:45:54,775 --> 00:45:55,880
Rym: three player, but four player.

619
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,880
Rym: It's one of the best games ever.

620
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:01,580
Scott: It's kind of weird because the German version of Tigris and Euphrates is two to four and the English version says three to four.

621
00:46:01,902 --> 00:46:04,519
Scott: But really it's a four player only game if you ask me.

622
00:46:04,821 --> 00:46:10,820
Rym: But then Vinci much like Puerto Rico every number of players is the same basic game.

623
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:15,860
Rym: But in terms of strategy and the way the game plays out, it's like an entirely different game.

624
00:46:16,301 --> 00:46:24,507
Rym: So you basically bought a three four five and six player game each one of which is different slightly different I mean the four and the five aren't so different.

625
00:46:24,527 --> 00:46:28,940
Rym: but the different like the three-player game is a separate game with completely separate strategies.

626
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:29,843
Rym: Civilization.

627
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:35,980
Rym: Oh, yeah, like a civilization that is stupidly awesome in the three-player game is kind of useless in the six-player game.

628
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:41,120
Rym: Well a civilization that would win in the six-player game is not so great in the three-player game.

629
00:46:41,321 --> 00:46:52,120
Scott: I think what it is is when you're playing like this six the five the larger player games You the main difference in the rules is that every civilization is going to be weaker militarily.

630
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:57,637
Scott: And the reason that is is because obviously that way all the civilizations can fit on the same board at once.

631
00:46:57,697 --> 00:47:03,714
Scott: if everyone had a super strong Civilization then you just conquer the whole board and someone else to conquer the whole board.

632
00:47:03,774 --> 00:47:08,431
Scott: and in a three-player game where you really only Had to divide the board into three, you know parts.

633
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:13,313
Scott: You can have a pretty strong civilization That's large enough to conquer a third of the board.

634
00:47:13,654 --> 00:47:21,880
Scott: in a six-player game You really can only have a civilization strong enough to conquer a sixth of the board or else the game gets screwed up big time.

635
00:47:22,484 --> 00:47:37,418
Scott: so in a six-player game you tend to make civilizations that are smaller yet have to get more points with less might and Deal with being adjacent to more players and being on the board for a shorter period of time.

636
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:43,980
Rym: now There is some randomness in play just in terms of the fact that a lot can happen between your turns as other players act.

637
00:47:44,363 --> 00:47:46,660
Rym: But it's not randomness that just in the game.

638
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:51,940
Rym: It's randomness of what other players will do which are things that you can fairly readily anticipate.

639
00:47:52,174 --> 00:48:01,690
Scott: Yeah The only real randomness is what civilizations there are at the beginning of the game because it's possible that at the beginning of the game The best civilization ever is the first one.

640
00:48:01,951 --> 00:48:04,460
Scott: whoever gets to go first picks it and hooray for them.

641
00:48:04,521 --> 00:48:05,259
Scott: They just got lucky.

642
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:13,525
Rym: However, the game lasts long enough and is constructed in such a way that one good civilization will in most cases not win You the game.

643
00:48:13,545 --> 00:48:23,514
Scott: Yeah, so I Think I've been paying attention and people who go first and pick that awesome Civilization right away that tends not to be so healthy.

644
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:25,100
Scott: They don't tend to win all the time or anything.

645
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,380
Rym: Well, it used to be that Alex won this game a disproportionate amount of the time.

646
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:36,060
Rym: Yeah But now just recently the last several playings pretty much every game and extremely close and one of us just pulls ahead by the end.

647
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,151
Rym: Yeah, I won.

648
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:39,334
Scott: Yeah, I want to Everyone's winning this game.

649
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:39,860
Scott: everyone's winning.

650
00:48:40,161 --> 00:48:58,900
Rym: I think we've solved the three-player game at least in so far as nobody makes any boneheaded moves Yeah and everyone plays pretty optimally and it comes down to very minor tactical decisions in terms of who wins like Like literally if I lose the game or Scott loses a game, it'll be like in the middle of the game.

651
00:48:59,322 --> 00:49:03,340
Rym: I waited one round too long to decline that one civilization.

652
00:49:03,781 --> 00:49:05,125
Scott: Yeah, and that's that was a gin.

653
00:49:05,506 --> 00:49:06,849
Rym: but the fact is it wasn't random.

654
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:10,519
Rym: it's oh I made X mistake damn it yep.

655
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:22,115
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what I do sometimes feel not often but occasionally You know one game every once in a while Like there aren't any good civilizations coming up like every civilization that goes up is crap.

656
00:49:22,235 --> 00:49:22,596
Rym: Luckily.

657
00:49:22,757 --> 00:49:23,860
Rym: Everyone has to deal with that.

658
00:49:23,945 --> 00:49:37,420
Scott: Yeah But the problem is if there was say good civilization early on and someone got it and then everyone else gets crap Someone gets a slight lead and if all the civilizations continue to be crap They don't have a hard time maintaining that lead and then they win.

659
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,669
Rym: Yep, but again because the game is long enough.

660
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,415
Rym: It really seems to mitigate that.

661
00:49:41,476 --> 00:49:43,263
Scott: it doesn't happen often But it can.

662
00:49:43,444 --> 00:49:53,280
Rym: and if you find randomness being a factor just by your style of play There's nothing wrong with just adding another 50 victory points to the victory condition and then playing a longer game.

663
00:49:53,441 --> 00:49:56,020
Rym: Yeah, the longer the game goes the more the luck will leave it out.

664
00:49:56,201 --> 00:50:00,520
Scott: Yeah, and also if you really wanted to you could develop some sort of civilization drafting mechanism.

665
00:50:00,641 --> 00:50:09,380
Scott: Of course, the game does have a civilization drafting back a very good one I might add but you could add to it to remove the drawing them out of the bag and somehow doing something else.

666
00:50:10,064 --> 00:50:11,393
Scott: I don't really know if you want to bother with that.

667
00:50:11,413 --> 00:50:19,273
Rym: I don't think it's necessary But it is a possibility if you're really crazy now also we talked a lot about German style games But this is actually a French game.

668
00:50:19,657 --> 00:50:21,979
Rym: Oh It is a game for France!

669
00:50:22,441 --> 00:50:24,286
Rym: Filipe K-Arts.

670
00:50:24,868 --> 00:50:26,633
Scott: K-E-Y-A-E-R-T-S.

671
00:50:26,713 --> 00:50:26,994
Scott: Yes.

672
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:33,786
Rym: It was put out by Descartes Editieux Editieux This is the best.

673
00:50:34,088 --> 00:50:36,157
Rym: it didn't win any spiel this yards or anything.

674
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:44,179
Rym: obviously It's not a German game or anything, but it won the 1999 Concours Internationale de Créatures de Jour de Société.

675
00:50:44,763 --> 00:50:45,330
Scott: What is that?

676
00:50:45,816 --> 00:50:51,748
Rym: The International Creators of Game Society conference Uh-huh or something to that effect.

677
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:52,973
Scott: That's not bad.

678
00:50:53,194 --> 00:51:02,838
Rym: Now the guy who designed this game He looks like he also made as far as I can see a game called EVO Which we've also played which was kind of meh, but then again, we played it with some kind of men people.

679
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,926
Scott: So That game was meh.

680
00:51:06,067 --> 00:51:08,740
Rym: Oh, no, wait, we played it with men people and we played it with cool people.

681
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:09,524
Rym: I played it twice.

682
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:12,117
Scott: Oh, wait, I don't think did I play this game?

683
00:51:12,157 --> 00:51:12,660
Scott: I don't remember.

684
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,331
Rym: We played it at those other board gaming nights.

685
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:17,480
Rym: We used to go to not our way, but the other one.

686
00:51:17,861 --> 00:51:18,846
Scott: Oh, I did play this game.

687
00:51:18,886 --> 00:51:19,368
Scott: Yes, I did.

688
00:51:19,448 --> 00:51:22,180
Rym: Yeah, and I think we also played it with Luke on a separate occasion.

689
00:51:22,301 --> 00:51:22,743
Scott: Yes.

690
00:51:22,824 --> 00:51:23,810
Scott: Yeah, this game was meh.

691
00:51:24,212 --> 00:51:24,856
Rym: Yeah, it was okay.

692
00:51:24,876 --> 00:51:25,460
Rym: It wasn't a great game.

693
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,679
Rym: I played a game again a game again.

694
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:33,201
Rym: Now that I'm a little older and wiser in the ways of German games cuz back then I still thought El Grande was the hot Shit.

695
00:51:33,462 --> 00:51:35,772
Rym: Yeah, I still like El Grande, but it's not the hot shit.

696
00:51:35,812 --> 00:51:36,294
Scott: No, it's not.

697
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,600
Scott: Okay now here's something else.

698
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,951
Scott: You gotta know about Vinci that there's nothing to do with the game itself.

699
00:51:40,353 --> 00:51:41,820
Scott: There are two printings of Vinci.

700
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:47,139
Scott: There's an old busted printing with a lot of typos and all sorts of problems the one we have.

701
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:50,532
Scott: Yep Well, we Alex got it super cheap on the discount rack.

702
00:51:50,552 --> 00:51:52,340
Rym: So alright Alex owns that game not us.

703
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,100
Rym: Yep, and I always forget cuz it's in our house.

704
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:59,680
Scott: Yeah, and there is the new hotness printing that is doesn't have these problems.

705
00:52:00,024 --> 00:52:06,859
Scott: And if you buy this game I suggest you buy the new hotness printing unless you can get the old busted printing for the cheapness.

706
00:52:07,443 --> 00:52:14,240
Scott: See if you can get the old printing for cheap You can go and figure out what the corrections are on board game geek and you'll save a lot of money.

707
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,539
Rym: They're actually pretty minor.

708
00:52:15,894 --> 00:52:22,788
Scott: Yeah Generally, you just want to avoid paying full price for the old busted version and it is worth it to pay full price for the New hotness version.

709
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:25,479
Scott: That's all I'm gonna say All right.

710
00:52:25,781 --> 00:52:26,867
Scott: one less thing about Vinci.

711
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:37,924
Scott: if you want to play this game without Buying it at the store in a box or if you can't find it or something You can play it online at a website called ludagora www.ludagora.net.

712
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:44,591
Scott: It's a French website So it's kind of hard to read.

713
00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:46,140
Rym: French is not that hard to read?

714
00:52:46,341 --> 00:52:47,344
Scott: Well, it's.

715
00:52:47,445 --> 00:52:47,806
Scott: it's kind of.

716
00:52:47,826 --> 00:52:51,460
Scott: it's a little bit hard to figure out what to click on to be able to play the game.

717
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:58,973
Scott: All right, but once you play in the game at least yeah, the interface is kind of bad But you can play the game there and they work.

718
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:02,368
Rym: Hey, it's not nearly as bad as that online Tigers and Euphrates.

719
00:53:02,409 --> 00:53:03,357
Rym: that didn't even work.

720
00:53:03,457 --> 00:53:08,960
Scott: Nah Spiel by web is still the best online board game turn-based playing site, you know.

721
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,900
Scott: But ludagora exists and they have Vinci.

722
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:15,140
Scott: So if you want to play Vinci you can head over there and have some Vinci fun.

723
00:53:15,702 --> 00:53:20,360
Rym: I highly recommend Vinci because it is in the very least unlike many games we own.

724
00:53:20,702 --> 00:53:23,960
Rym: It is stood up to the test of repeated continuous play.

725
00:53:24,495 --> 00:53:29,457
Rym: Yeah I mean there aren't many games that we could play three times in the same day and not be sick of it.

726
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:31,226
Rym: and this game Is one of those few?

727
00:53:31,448 --> 00:53:33,180
Scott: Yeah, and a lot of games get played out.

728
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:33,723
Scott: We're like up.

729
00:53:33,824 --> 00:53:35,012
Scott: I know the answer to this game.

730
00:53:35,032 --> 00:53:36,320
Scott: There's no point in playing it anymore.

731
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,912
Scott: It's just a you know an exercise in exercising our fingers moving pieces around.

732
00:53:41,253 --> 00:53:49,894
Scott: but Vinci it's still an okay game and I'm not always in the mood to play it, but I'm never gonna say probably never gonna say that up.

733
00:53:49,914 --> 00:53:51,420
Scott: There's nothing else to be had with Vinci.

734
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,249
Scott: No reason to play that anymore is?

735
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:55,339
Scott: it's not a solved game by any means.
