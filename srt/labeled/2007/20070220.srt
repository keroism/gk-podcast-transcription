1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,099
Rym: It's Tuesday February 20th.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:12,902
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:15,430
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:19,069
Rym: We're back from Katsucon and boy are our voices tired.

5
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:22,600
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,742
Rym: ah We're finally back from Katsucon.

7
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:29,962
Rym: god damn It was a fantastic con.

8
00:00:29,982 --> 00:00:31,150
Rym: We're totally exhausted.

9
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:34,859
Rym: Expect my voice to sound weird for the next couple days as I recover.

10
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:40,942
Scott: Yeah, we finally figured out those roads near northern Jersey right you know west of New York City.

11
00:00:40,963 --> 00:00:41,726
Scott: How all they all work.

12
00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:51,470
Rym: yeah in other words We figured out how to get out of Jersey Quickly the quickest way possible as opposed to the slow and inefficient way, but no the con was great.

13
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:52,855
Rym: We're absolutely exhausted.

14
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:59,470
Rym: We missed last night's show as we'll talk about later, but more importantly Welcome to all of our new listeners.

15
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:05,990
Scott: Yeah, I wonder how many new people are actually gonna start listening who met us at Katsucon so very interested.

16
00:01:06,554 --> 00:01:08,810
Rym: So of course we're not gonna do this really ever again.

17
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:18,810
Rym: But we figured since we know we have a lot of new listeners We should at least go over a little bit of what this business all is in case they couldn't figure it out from the CDs Which we ran out of immediately yeah?

18
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,383
Scott: Well anyone who picked up the flyer instead of the CD is probably gonna need some help.

19
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:23,889
Scott: the CD had help on it.

20
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,890
Rym: well It's Tuesday night, so it is a gaming day where we talk about games.

21
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:37,489
Scott: You know video games board games all that sort of stuff role-playing games Not really so much card games, but yeah, whatever we're playing at the time is usually what we're gonna talk about.

22
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:44,740
Rym: yeah But GeekNights in general is four different nights with four effectively different shows every night Just with the same format about a different topic.

23
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:49,498
Scott: yep, so if you listen to the show tomorrow night It's gonna be about anime manga or comics.

24
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,398
Rym: and more importantly if you listen to it tomorrow because it's about anime manga and comics We're going to actually cover Katsucon tonight.

25
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:57,406
Rym: We're just talking about the gaming at Katsucon.

26
00:01:57,566 --> 00:02:00,938
Scott: yep Thursday You never know what it's gonna be and Monday.

27
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,210
Scott: It's usually computers and technology and slash that type of stuff.

28
00:02:04,352 --> 00:02:10,090
Scott: Yeah, and of course It's a podcast so no one's forcing you to listen on any particular day.

29
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:17,866
Scott: So even though we make the video game show on Tuesday night You might listen to it on Saturday or Monday or who knows when.

30
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:23,408
Rym: yep now We're not gonna explain how podcasts work because you got this far, so you've obviously figured something out.

31
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:29,670
Rym: But in general tonight is going to be not mostly a standard episode just because we are tired.

32
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:38,743
Rym: I threw the equipment back together hastily after getting back from the con and instead of doing our normal topical thing We're just gonna kind of talk about the con until we get tired of talking about it.

33
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:46,950
Rym: That sounds kind of fun Yeah, so I'd recommend if you're new to the show Search for a topic you're interested in or browse through the archives.

34
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:50,168
Rym: I almost guarantee you'll find an episode about something you care about.

35
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:52,930
Scott: yeah There's like two more almost 300 episodes in there.

36
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,626
Scott: There has to be an episode that we've done That you'll be interested in and then you can decide if you like the show or not.

37
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:02,719
Rym: based on that yeah And starting either probably Thursday, or maybe next week.

38
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,066
Rym: We'll get back into our normal nightly groove

39
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:05,627
Scott: yep,

40
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:17,669
Rym: but anyway We'll be really quick about the news because I still want to go to bed and rest my throat for one more night And because I don't know how long we're gonna talk about Katsucon gaming since it was totally awesome, and I have a lot of awesome things to say about it.

41
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:22,150
Scott: Yeah, we don't want the episode to go too long, so let's do the news real quick ready go all right.

42
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,750
Rym: So real real real briefly as I can expound and go on and trade.

43
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:36,030
Rym: No so apparently Nintendo has said that they have not entirely ruled out the possibility of releasing.

44
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:40,787
Rym: Translated Japanese were only games on the virtual console in the United States.

45
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:44,900
Rym: earthbound Not just earthbound.

46
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,414
Rym: there's a lot of games I want Desperately.

47
00:03:48,434 --> 00:03:52,330
Scott: well, I'm gonna use one talk about something as my thing today, but it's not really a Nintendo game.

48
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,199
Scott: So don't expect it on the virtual account.

49
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,610
Rym: yeah, so obviously this isn't news that it's happened yet.

50
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:03,170
Rym: But the fact that Nintendo didn't come out and say no is kind of significant because Nintendo is one of the few gaming companies where?

51
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,278
Rym: They say exactly What they mean.

52
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,325
Scott: yeah if they're.

53
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:08,943
Scott: if it's no They'll just say no.

54
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:14,969
Rym: Yep, like the when the GameCube came out or that not the GameCube the Wii the Wii they were talking about.

55
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:21,709
Rym: you know How much is gonna cost and way back they said it will cost no more than two hundred and fifty dollars.

56
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:23,335
Scott: And guess how much it cost.

57
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:25,984
Rym: it cost exactly two hundred and fifty dollars.

58
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:27,850
Scott: I think it cost maybe two forty nine ninety nine.

59
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:28,729
Rym: I'm not something like that.

60
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:39,823
Rym: So like that when Nintendo when they don't lie they they might be deceitful by saying something that is perfectly true But might mislead you, but they whatever they say is always exactly what they said.

61
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:42,150
Rym: yep, which shouldn't be an issue.

62
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,460
Rym: But there are companies like Sony out there, so we got it.

63
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,143
Scott: They're like us.

64
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,870
Scott: They say what they mean anyway.

65
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:56,662
Scott: So for anyone who's worried that Capcom may or may not release more Phoenix, right in the United States You should probably be less worried.

66
00:04:57,024 --> 00:04:58,310
Scott: They're having a contest.

67
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:01,242
Scott: It's on the official Capcom forums in the United States.

68
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:13,690
Scott: one of the administrators posted rules for a contest full official rules and the contest basically says Convince Capcom to release Phoenix Wright 3 in the US and win a prize.

69
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:22,024
Scott: I didn't really read all the details of the contest because I have no interest in entering But it gives hope that Phoenix Wright is more of it is on the way.

70
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:25,687
Rym: if I had a video camera I would be very interested in entering.

71
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:34,009
Rym: I imagine we could put forth some sort of Horrid video that would force them to recognize the awesomeness of us and of this game coming out here.

72
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:36,129
Scott: That could very well be true.

73
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:41,430
Scott: But yeah, I mean the fourth Phoenix Wright, which doesn't actually have Phoenix Wright in it.

74
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,128
Scott: They changed the main character is coming out in Japan pretty much right now.

75
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:49,490
Scott: So if we get the third one, we're just about caught up.

76
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:51,676
Rym: Yeah I mean I'm playing through the second one.

77
00:05:51,957 --> 00:06:02,509
Rym: finally now and I actually had to spend most of Katsucon Surrounded by cool people who are cooler than me because they've already played the game Pretty much just gushing about it while I had to sit there and go.

78
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,954
Scott: Whose fault is that?

79
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:05,899
Scott: I played it real quick.

80
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,030
Scott: You could have played it just as quick as me and been done already.

81
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,320
Rym: Yeah, cuz I have a job.

82
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,357
Scott: Oh, right Not working until March 1st, right?

83
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:18,850
Rym: Yeah, see I can't even use the dig if yeah captain jobless.

84
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,325
Rym: But the only reason you don't have a job is because you quit your job to get a better job.

85
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:23,430
Rym: that doesn't start right away.

86
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:26,570
Scott: It's good times in the life of Scott right now.

87
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:45,127
Rym: things of the day Now there's not much in this world I like more than Mario and Mario related paraphernalia, but there's not much more in this world I dislike than Dragon Ball Z GT.

88
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:56,883
Scott: whatever Man, like Dragon Ball Z. I mean it's one of the most popular anime in the US but Popularity is so far away from what isn't even still that popular.

89
00:06:56,903 --> 00:06:58,689
Rym: I wonder how popular it actually is.

90
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,081
Scott: It's a good question because it was super pop.

91
00:07:02,142 --> 00:07:14,704
Scott: It was Naruto popular maybe Five to ten years ago, I don't know back when the only anime on TV was that and Sailor Moon Yeah, but the current popularity of Dragon Ball Z that's tough.

92
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,049
Scott: It's real tough to say.

93
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,310
Rym: Regardless someone decided to take Mario and Dragon Ball Z and kind of mash them together in that way I like to do on the internet.

94
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:27,130
Rym: So, uh, I'm not gonna talk much about it because I want to get right into Katsu Kan.

95
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:38,590
Rym: But I suggest you watch this video and I will say that while it is parodying Dragon Ball Z It does distill about 12 episodes worth of this into about a minute and a half.

96
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:45,156
Scott: Yeah, the video Rym is linking to is like sort of a trailer thing for Mario Ball Z.

97
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:48,250
Rym: don't actually watch Mario Ball Z. It's not funny.

98
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:55,170
Scott: They've actually made episodes of Mario Ball Z like they've made episode 1 so far, but Scott tried to sell me on.

99
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:55,893
Rym: I'm like check them out.

100
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:57,260
Rym: They're an awesome funny parody.

101
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:58,165
Scott: Well, no, I wasn't.

102
00:07:58,466 --> 00:07:59,992
Scott: it wasn't that funny But it's the.

103
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:11,830
Rym: the production quality of the animations and the effort put into it is obviously more than other mashups that involve sprites Yeah, but all they had to do was make this trailer and it was good enough by actually going through with the project.

104
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,850
Rym: It's almost a minus minus in my book.

105
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:22,589
Scott: Yeah I think the problem with going through with the project is that they actually copied Dragon Ball Z too well and the problems of Dragon Ball Z show through in the final work.

106
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:29,983
Rym: Well, they also just go really really slowly But without any dialogue or anything and there's no voice acting per se.

107
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:33,357
Rym: so it's really just kind of a slow Plotting boring thing to watch.

108
00:08:33,398 --> 00:08:36,873
Rym: at least Dragon Ball is music and people yelling This had it.

109
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:40,546
Scott: You just didn't see those parts, but that doesn't know cuz it was all just text.

110
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:41,850
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

111
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,230
Rym: It is slow boring text that was on the screen way too long All right.

112
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:54,390
Scott: Anyway, there was a Sega Saturn game that I heard of a while ago and I you know, totally forgot about it.

113
00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:03,698
Scott: But the reason I heard of it is because Famitsu, which is pretty much the number one gaming magazine in all of Japan It's like the gaming authority in Japan.

114
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,270
Scott: They had sort of a reader's poll on best games ever.

115
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:09,760
Scott: I think it might have been in 2005 or something.

116
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:11,990
Rym: Yeah, we were actually looking at this at Katsu Con.

117
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,599
Scott: Yeah, well cuz I was reminded of it at Katsu Con.

118
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:17,489
Scott: So I looked it up because we had internets there, which was lucky.

119
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:27,986
Scott: and Yeah, this game was like I can't remember exactly which how it was ranked But it was like the number three game ever in Japan according to readers voting on Famitsu.

120
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:35,150
Rym: now considering that we'd heard of all These other games like yeah Dragon Quest whatever Final Fantasy, whatever this game never heard of that.

121
00:09:35,564 --> 00:09:46,157
Scott: Yeah Imagine if the number three game ever was not in the US was not available in Japan Like you couldn't buy Zelda 1 in Japan only in US.

122
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,302
Rym: So what the hell is this game?

123
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:56,670
Scott: It's apparently a game called machi and It's for the Sega Saturn in Japan only god damn it text heavy.

124
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:57,533
Scott: I assume

125
00:09:57,633 --> 00:10:00,562
Rym: how many Sega Saturn games are there that we'll never get to play

126
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:10,676
Scott: plenty and it's sort of Can't really tell exactly what kind of game it is, but I'm pretty sure it's an adventure Story kind of game that

127
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:11,238
Rym: would

128
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:16,458
Scott: probably be right up our alley possibly with Yakuza action Although I can't really tell so,

129
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,990
Rym: you know at this point because I know I can't ever play the game.

130
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:26,900
Rym: I'm just going to assume that there's Yakuza action because it seems to me that Japan is this Conspiracy to prevent Yakuza action from getting into my hands.

131
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,223
Scott: Yeah, you know what else?

132
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:35,958
Scott: I recently discovered that this game machi had a re-release on the PSP in Japan.

133
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:40,330
Scott: making owning a PSP in Japan worth it if you know Japanese.

134
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:52,050
Rym: So maybe if I get a PSP and then I mod it and then I get this game in Japan And then I sit there with Emily and make her translate it all for me I might get some Yakuza action.

135
00:10:52,611 --> 00:11:04,583
Scott: You could play what is quite possibly one of the top 10 games ever made that will never ever ever be available in English barring Someone crazy with a lot of money.

136
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:05,710
Scott: see the thing very nice.

137
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:09,561
Rym: There are people out there who translated the utenna game for the Sega Saturn.

138
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:12,269
Rym: We just haven't bothered to actually try to emulate it.

139
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:14,076
Scott: It's all you.

140
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:16,069
Rym: hey, I'm all about that so far.

141
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:19,949
Rym: now There's two reasons for me to learn enough Japanese to play Sega Saturn games.

142
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:23,053
Scott: well Go for it.

143
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:27,769
Scott: And if you succeed, let's play some machi because I really want to play this goddamn game.

144
00:11:28,632 --> 00:11:36,000
Rym: But that's enough thing of the day because we have plenty to talk about in the actual show since as you all should know we Were at Katsucon over the weekend.

145
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,969
Rym: Well, it's the lack of a Monday show.

146
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:49,389
Scott: Yeah, well we were planning on doing a Monday show But then we realized that would have meant we had to unpack all the equipment and set it up again Which I only set back up less than an hour ago.

147
00:11:50,044 --> 00:12:02,450
Rym: Yeah it takes a while to plug in all those wires and clean up the mess and move shit around and not to mention the fact that Scott's voice was a little scratchy and mine was about ten times more scratchy than it is now.

148
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:08,095
Scott: Yeah, I think mine is pretty much back to the way it was but yours is still a little a yeah I need another day of recovery.

149
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:08,617
Rym: Yeah.

150
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:09,741
Scott: Oh, well, of course.

151
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:10,183
Rym: I shot.

152
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:11,368
Scott: it's not Otakon bed.

153
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:12,010
Scott: So we're alright.

154
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,415
Rym: I shouted a lot more than you.

155
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:17,329
Rym: my rampart tournament ended up being quite competitive with a lot of people in it.

156
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:25,850
Rym: Yeah, my Street Fighter tournament was mighty quick Partly cuz Street Fighter was broken and two because it's a really really really bad game.

157
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,689
Scott: I know that's why I had a tournament in it cuz it's so bad.

158
00:12:29,454 --> 00:12:30,621
Rym: Yeah, we'll talk about that though.

159
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:36,827
Rym: But firstly well tonight We were talking just about the Katsucon game room game katsu and all things related to that.

160
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:48,868
Rym: tomorrow We will be talking about Katsucon as a whole our actual experiences at the con Outside of the gaming room since today's gaming day and tomorrow is anime manga comics day.

161
00:12:48,888 --> 00:12:50,032
Rym: Yep Well

162
00:12:50,594 --> 00:13:07,470
Scott: for those of you don't know Katsucon sort of weird with its gaming compared to other At least other anime conventions and that they have a sort of section It's like half of the convention almost called game katsu and it's sort of like its own gaming Convention within the bigger Katsucon convention.

163
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:16,601
Rym: Well, the thing is most other large cons are run generally like that where they'll have a department head for each area and they're largely Autonomous and they interface with each other to get stuff done.

164
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:18,570
Rym: Katsucon isn't special in that regard.

165
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:27,923
Rym: It's just special in that it seems as though the head of the game department has as much Discretion as an entire convention where at some other cons.

166
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:29,530
Rym: I don't think it's quite to that scale.

167
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:33,663
Scott: yeah, it's almost as if there's these different conventions going on like.

168
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:46,225
Scott: each department is its own convention and They only work with each other, you know when it's absolutely necessary like a super confederate Convention which is perfectly fine because it is perfectly fun.

169
00:13:46,265 --> 00:13:47,450
Rym: Katsucon is a great con.

170
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,242
Rym: It's what it's probably my second or third favorite con period.

171
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:56,585
Scott: yeah after going to it I can definitely say it was a pretty awesome despite a few shortcomings here and there.

172
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:58,170
Scott: but you know, no one's perfect.

173
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:04,962
Rym: But yeah, Aaron the head of game katsu who basically set us up in the front of the video game room Well, it was broken him in two.

174
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:05,890
Rym: We'll talk about all that in a bit.

175
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:06,794
Rym: How was actually set up?

176
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:13,161
Rym: but we were set up at a table in the front and we basically were hooked into the PA System through this crazy mixer configuration.

177
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:15,089
Scott: with are we gonna even talk about how?

178
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:16,833
Scott: with

179
00:14:16,853 --> 00:14:32,728
Rym: the live DJ next to us and all the music and some of the video games spliced in and We basically whenever the DJ wasn't, you know, actually mixing live with this awesome digital vinyl mixing system We were just playing music talking to the crowd and generally hanging out for most of the con.

180
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:40,830
Scott: Yep We also spent a lot of time sitting there promoting GeekNights and running tournaments and giving away prizes and talking to people.

181
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,499
Rym: We didn't really do much to promote GeekNights.

182
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,324
Scott: Well, we try.

183
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:44,350
Scott: we gave away those CDs.

184
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:46,738
Scott: The thing is they ran out so fast.

185
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:51,875
Scott: as soon as I fixed our free CD sign to be more prominent Those things flew.

186
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:51,955
Rym: Yep.

187
00:14:52,678 --> 00:14:55,227
Rym: And once we got our friend I know to draw us a funny little.

188
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:56,230
Rym: hey come up and take stuff.

189
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,534
Rym: Pretty much everything disappeared.

190
00:14:57,935 --> 00:15:02,610
Scott: Yeah, and then we put a sign that said come to the match game and that totally worked also.

191
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,890
Scott: So people are definitely paying attention to what we were doing.

192
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:13,786
Rym: Yeah so basically we just sat there and it was Kind of like how we would go at other cons if we had an artist alley table and we could just kind of park behind it whenever there's nothing else to do.

193
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:24,090
Rym: but Because Katsucon we were so prominent and too because the video game room was so happening 24/7 throughout the whole con we were basically in the thick of it at all times.

194
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:33,041
Scott: Yeah Imagine if instead of your artist alley table being in the middle of artist alley with everyone else's table You certainly had like your own special table out there.

195
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,206
Scott: It was pretty cool.

196
00:15:34,286 --> 00:15:35,410
Rym: It was totally awesome.

197
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,292
Rym: But before we you know go off on all that business because a lot of funny things happen to us while we were sitting up There.

198
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:55,030
Rym: Yep, but the game room at katsu is Really really neat and unique compared to most other cons for one main reason Instead of having just a big game room like most cons have they split it up into exactly two rooms of roughly equal size.

199
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,597
Scott: Well to video game rooms.

200
00:15:56,637 --> 00:15:57,822
Scott: They also have other gaming rooms.

201
00:15:58,164 --> 00:15:58,485
Rym: Well, yeah.

202
00:15:58,526 --> 00:15:59,430
Rym: Yeah, but we'll get to all that.

203
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:15,790
Rym: Yeah Now the first half of the room on the other side that you get through through our game room Was the same as Otakon and anime central and everything else a giant room full of TVs with Wiis and PlayStations And Xbox's and DDR and Guitar Heroes and everything just kind of strewn about everywhere.

204
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:16,071
Rym: Yeah,

205
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:30,546
Scott: one thing I thought was pretty cool actually about that room was I don't know where they rented the TVs from but every TV Was identical and they were laid out, you know in a very nice and even fashion and everything seemed to you know Been working at least every time I went in there.

206
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:39,608
Scott: It was working Yeah, and you could always you know, you might not get the game you wanted right away But there was always somewhere to sit and play a game, you know without much weight.

207
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:43,483
Rym: Yep Well plus I mean it looked like every single game there was getting play.

208
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,050
Rym: They had a very good selection.

209
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:52,589
Rym: Well Otakon had some trouble with that where there were areas where no one was and you thought oh I can play a game And then you find out why no one was over there.

210
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:54,375
Scott: Yeah, another thing was.

211
00:16:54,516 --> 00:17:05,512
Scott: I noticed that the staff would often say hey that games not getting played much that games getting played a lot You know and they would set up new stations of games that were getting played a lot and they would get rid of Station.

212
00:17:05,573 --> 00:17:07,763
Scott: it would change games out where they weren't being played.

213
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:08,468
Scott: now, you know.

214
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:13,872
Scott: Actually changing what games are out there during the convention is pretty cool I think.

215
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,446
Scott: Otakon they set it up and then it is let it sit there.

216
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:16,869
Scott: They don't care.

217
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:27,146
Rym: I think a lot of that had to do with the fact that Aaron who was running the game room and all of his staff This was the most highly staffed game room of any con I've ever been to yet

218
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:32,390
Scott: quality staffed Also, like the worst guy on the staff was still a cool guy.

219
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,370
Rym: Yeah, well above our line of tolerance, which as you all know is pretty high.

220
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:36,888
Scott: Yep.

221
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:46,450
Rym: But no I mean This time not only did they have more staff per game and more staff per person in the room But they had probably more staff total than most anime cons.

222
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:49,522
Scott: Yeah, I mean they had a staff meeting which we were kind of at cuz.

223
00:17:49,562 --> 00:17:53,554
Scott: we were semi staff in a way Yeah Basically by staff.

224
00:17:53,715 --> 00:17:59,544
Rym: all that meant was we could MC our half of the game room and basically do whatever we wanted in that room At all times.

225
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:09,413
Scott: Yeah we did a few staff things like I handled giving out some wireless controllers for a little bit and People would come up and ask us questions because we were sitting at the head of the room and I would answer them the best I could.

226
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:18,834
Rym: the answer was always either No The tournament is for that Street Fighter arcade game right there or the answer you're looking for is in the other room at the other Identical table.

227
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,290
Scott: Yeah, well semi identical table, but more authoritative table.

228
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:29,669
Rym: Well partly because that's where all the I guess official con sponsored tournaments were in the act the normal gaming room with the normal Xboxes

229
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:30,411
Scott: Yep,

230
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:40,490
Rym: but the other half of the con or the gaming con in katsucon where we were sitting They had like they did last year classic arcade cabinets.

231
00:18:40,658 --> 00:18:56,190
Scott: Yeah Apparently there's some video game museum rental company place that they know and pay I guess called video topia and they will Provide your event with old-school arcade machines that are usually working and well maintained.

232
00:18:56,411 --> 00:19:05,483
Rym: Well, the guy who runs it is really cool and knows his stuff and there was a guy there for the whole con Constantly fixing any game that broke to the best of his ability as fast as possible.

233
00:19:05,503 --> 00:19:06,927
Rym: He was on top of that.

234
00:19:07,508 --> 00:19:10,359
Rym: now that alone I mean they had that last year too, and they had a good selection of games.

235
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:24,891
Rym: I talked about it almost one year ago today But this year due to the specific requesting of the staff They had a slightly different loadout and I'm not gonna name all the games Notable.

236
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,756
Scott: I could probably remember them all if I had to though.

237
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:33,508
Scott: notables included dig-dug Ram dog where the left pump button was broken in the right pump button was working.

238
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:34,050
Scott: That's fine.

239
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,299
Rym: Yeah rampart, which is one of my favorite games.

240
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,910
Rym: Rampart was pretty big which I have much to say about in a bit.

241
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,737
Rym: Yeah, we had a spy hunter.

242
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:45,750
Scott: Yeah, I didn't even realize the spy hunter was there for a while.

243
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:46,373
Rym: No one did.

244
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,421
Scott: actually we're some guy came up to us.

245
00:19:48,642 --> 00:19:50,490
Rym: Yeah, we were playing some random OC remix.

246
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:52,278
Rym: This guy's like what's this music from?

247
00:19:53,021 --> 00:20:00,350
Rym: and one thing led to another and then he says man Spy hunter was my favorite game ever and I'm like dude spy hunters sitting over in that other corner of the room.

248
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,970
Scott: He's like really where I'm like over there go play it.

249
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,143
Rym: He ran over and we didn't see him again for like an hour.

250
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:07,915
Scott: Yeah That was pretty good.

251
00:20:08,296 --> 00:20:14,159
Rym: They had stun runner which while it's a pretty piss-poor game I have a lot of history and memories with that game.

252
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:14,942
Scott: Actually.

253
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:16,848
Scott: What was that game the road blasters?

254
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:17,590
Scott: I think yeah.

255
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:21,590
Scott: Yeah, well we'll talk about more of the specific game plays later.

256
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:25,430
Rym: Yeah, they also had marble madness and not only that moral madness.

257
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:30,129
Rym: But there was a guy at the con who is one of the registered champions of Marvel.

258
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:30,330
Rym: bad.

259
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:36,530
Scott: Yeah, he's like a third best marble madness player ever and I watched him just beat marble madness.

260
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:40,889
Scott: Yeah, I mean he died a few times and that shows you how hard that game is in it.

261
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:46,189
Scott: but right before they packed up the machine I watched him beat it and Holy shit.

262
00:20:46,691 --> 00:20:58,270
Rym: Granted marble madness is probably one of the hardest games I've ever played and the fact that I got to the second and a half stage of the game Totally impressed these three fangirls who were standing around the machine.

263
00:20:58,873 --> 00:21:02,690
Scott: Yeah, it was surprising like how many people I watched play these games.

264
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:08,469
Scott: They just didn't know what to do or sucked or I saw some girls put quarters in the dig-dug machine.

265
00:21:09,832 --> 00:21:16,532
Rym: But there was also Tetris miss pac-man and of course zookeeper and root beer tapper zookeeper.

266
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:19,844
Rym: now the sad thing is our friend I do and actually I'm out from Apple.

267
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:25,810
Rym: geeks were both staying in our room and I do Tells me you know, I said, oh they got zookeeper in there.

268
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,366
Rym: She says I love zookeeper and I'm really good at it.

269
00:21:29,406 --> 00:21:33,030
Rym: So I think wow She's more hardcore and old-school than I could ever have imagined.

270
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:35,560
Rym: So then we get there and I'm like, let's go play zookeeper.

271
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,990
Rym: and I start to play and she's staring at it with this.

272
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:39,875
Rym: The fuck is this your child's look?

273
00:21:40,597 --> 00:21:44,087
Rym: she was thinking of zookeeper this flash game that she played on the internets.

274
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:52,467
Rym: Ah I was thinking of zookeeper this somewhat poorly coded game from before probably before I was born.

275
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:55,437
Rym: Yeah Yeah, granted.

276
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:58,370
Rym: I rocked zookeeper and had the high score by the end of the con.

277
00:21:58,763 --> 00:22:08,199
Scott: Yeah zookeeper was a game that I played once at a roller skater rink as a child and I remembered it as being this Old-school arcade game that didn't get any memory or respect.

278
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:14,843
Scott: So when the machine showed up, I was like, holy shits But that level where you got to jump up to the top.

279
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:16,330
Scott: I just didn't like that at all.

280
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,210
Rym: Oh, I love that because I could get pretty much like 60 or 70 thousand points in there without even blinking.

281
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:28,129
Scott: Yeah, they also had the old at asteroids and centipede and Star Wars.

282
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:31,740
Rym: Yeah, they're Tron but that game sucks wrong sucks bad.

283
00:22:31,861 --> 00:22:35,090
Scott: Oh and the paper boy with the bike handlebars that sucks also.

284
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:39,030
Rym: Oh, you mean the game that's 10,000 times harder than any other version of paper boy ever.

285
00:22:39,612 --> 00:22:41,318
Scott: Oh and track and field which also sucks.

286
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:44,349
Scott: Yeah, it's an NBA game and as you already mentioned Street Fighter one.

287
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:50,790
Rym: Essentially they had an entire arcade from the early days of my childhood.

288
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:54,603
Scott: They had more games than most arcades in the early days of my childhood.

289
00:22:54,884 --> 00:22:55,967
Scott: It was like two arcades.

290
00:22:56,489 --> 00:23:03,347
Scott: really Well, I guess there were a few arcades that had more games than that But they had like it was like two or three roller rinks worth real.

291
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:07,342
Rym: every arcade I lived nearby had at least that many games if not twice as many.

292
00:23:08,165 --> 00:23:10,978
Scott: I think there were only two arcades I remember that had that many games.

293
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:19,696
Rym: Oh, well now the only small arcade I went to was in the Gibraltar Trade Center and it had stun runner and like two other games Hence I played stun runner a lot.

294
00:23:19,777 --> 00:23:21,422
Scott: It was more than a timeouts worth.

295
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:22,406
Scott: That's all I'm gonna say.

296
00:23:22,827 --> 00:23:23,650
Rym: That's not saying much?

297
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:24,414
Scott: No, it's not.

298
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:35,149
Rym: but no the cool thing is that in this room I mean we had the normal video game room where the normal con people playing their normal con games were hanging out and that room Was pretty much packed 24/7 throughout the entire con.

299
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:46,841
Rym: Mm-hmm our room which had the old-school games was just as packed and the people in there range from people younger than us staring at These games just trying to fathom anyone enjoying them at all.

300
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:53,921
Rym: But also equal numbers of people our age Practically just on the verge of ecstasy playing games from their youth.

301
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:57,450
Scott: You can place both of us clearly within the ecstasy group.

302
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:03,327
Rym: God I spent probably all told about six hours that this con playing root beer tapper.

303
00:24:03,347 --> 00:24:11,682
Scott: I Didn't play that root beer tapper that much but I did play quite a bit of a few other games Yeah, so in terms of the con itself though, the room was rocking.

304
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:18,702
Rym: We were playing our music which was mostly Psychedelic trance OC remixes and mock and I supremacy.

305
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:30,943
Rym: It's all I could fit on my little 4 gig I thought well intermixed with some para para maxes and whatever else we could take up from my iPod and from the Mac Yep, and whenever we weren't this awesome guy next to us was DJing with LA.

306
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,550
Rym: He's got this really cool kind of digital vinyl setup.

307
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,230
Scott: Yeah, it's this thing called Serato.

308
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:42,430
Scott: I don't want to talk about it a lot But all I'll say is that I heard about it previously, but I didn't think it was like that advanced.

309
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:46,261
Scott: Apparently it's super advanced and it's super awesome.

310
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:51,210
Scott: And even though I have no interest in being a DJ whatsoever I kind of want this equipment.

311
00:24:51,514 --> 00:24:52,649
Scott: Anyway, it's that awesome.

312
00:24:52,871 --> 00:25:03,147
Rym: Now the best part was whenever he wasn't around and we were people would come up and look at him like hey Dude, you guys DJ's and I was so tempted to say yeah, I'm totally a rockin DJ.

313
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:04,050
Rym: Check out my set.

314
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:05,635
Scott: Yeah, too bad.

315
00:25:05,676 --> 00:25:05,997
Scott: You're not.

316
00:25:06,358 --> 00:25:06,498
Rym: Yeah.

317
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,181
Rym: I'm not at all.

318
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:07,582
Rym: God.

319
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,790
Scott: I I wouldn't even know how to use that thing.

320
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:19,101
Rym: Yeah well it looked pretty simple until he actually started using it and it was actually far more complex than I would ever have the effort or Energy or time to put forth?

321
00:25:19,262 --> 00:25:20,490
Scott: Yeah, I think it's pretty simple.

322
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:25,770
Scott: If all you want to do is play a record scratch switch the next record that kind of thing.

323
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:33,570
Scott: But anything advanced like actually making music by combining two records and all kinds of stuff would be difficult.

324
00:25:34,353 --> 00:25:35,136
Rym: But yeah, this kind.

325
00:25:35,156 --> 00:25:38,970
Rym: they had the normal loadout of you know convention tournaments that a halo tournament.

326
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:44,327
Rym: They had a Wii Sports tournament which had mixed results due to the fact that golf is kind of a broken game.

327
00:25:44,347 --> 00:25:49,350
Rym: Oh Yeah, but the tournaments went over really well and we were in charge of the prizes.

328
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:54,428
Rym: So basically whenever someone won they come into our room all nervous and you know, we'd shake their hand.

329
00:25:54,628 --> 00:25:55,150
Rym: Hey, congratulations.

330
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,475
Rym: You want to be interviewed?

331
00:25:56,495 --> 00:26:03,090
Rym: You want us to announce your name blah blah blah, and they almost universally say no I just want to get my prize and skulk away.

332
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,741
Rym: Yep, we had a box of prizes.

333
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:11,766
Scott: Yeah, the box of prizes was because Aaron the guy who ran the the whole game katsu thing.

334
00:26:12,107 --> 00:26:12,790
Scott: He worked at EB.

335
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:18,390
Scott: So we had all the you know, the pre-order incentives from EB that didn't get given out.

336
00:26:18,631 --> 00:26:24,087
Rym: Yeah, basically he told us that anyone who ever worked in an EB would see that pile and say wow who worked at EB at this con?

337
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:27,399
Scott: Yeah, we looted some good stuff from there.

338
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,844
Scott: We gave away most of it.

339
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:30,670
Scott: Some of our friends took a few things.

340
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:40,845
Rym: well someone stole the three the three best prizes there other than the Wii Sports Reggie t-shirts that we gave away at our game show and the Phoenix Wright stylus, which I took.

341
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:41,470
Rym: bastard.

342
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:47,456
Rym: Yeah But yeah There were these little harvest moon sheep and they were really cute little plushie dolls and people Doesn't?

343
00:26:47,496 --> 00:26:48,990
Scott: no one pre-ordered harvest moon?

344
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:58,972
Rym: yeah, but people were constantly looking at him and asking about him and pointing to him and referencing them and so at some point during the Con someone somehow stole one of them from us Basted.

345
00:26:59,293 --> 00:27:08,670
Rym: now luckily they didn't steal the Tachi Koma or the dragon from brave story that I also had and we're sitting on the table Prominently because you totally would have found them out and gotten them.

346
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:13,766
Rym: Oh if someone installed one there was only one of those dragons the entire con and I scoured the con.

347
00:27:14,307 --> 00:27:16,456
Rym: if that had disappeared Believe you me.

348
00:27:16,476 --> 00:27:19,269
Rym: I would have been prowling around with that black mag light until I found it.

349
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:24,949
Scott: Yeah, so the only way someone could have gotten away with is they hid it in their room and then didn't let it out.

350
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:30,430
Rym: Yeah, oh well But in our room, we pretty much had discretion to do what we wanted.

351
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:36,090
Rym: So aside from playing our music I decided and Scott agreed with me that we should run a rampart tournament.

352
00:27:36,512 --> 00:27:39,221
Rym: However, we didn't want to commit to being there at any particular time.

353
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,546
Rym: So we decided to make it at 1 a.m.

354
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:52,170
Rym: Let me tell you the combination of having a rampart tournament Coupled with having a rampart tournament at 1 in the morning is like this cool dude distillery.

355
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:57,250
Rym: Because of all the people in the con it seems like the coolest dude showed up for this tournament.

356
00:27:57,652 --> 00:28:07,549
Rym: Because one all the people who showed up were either rampart fans and when I say rampart fans I'll get into that in a minute as to what that entails or there are people who just discovered rampart and loved it.

357
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:11,442
Rym: Yep, and between those two groups of people you have an awesome group of people.

358
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:19,890
Rym: now couple that with people who are up at 1 in The morning and willing to give up their rave time or their sleep time to come and play in a rampart tournament.

359
00:28:20,891 --> 00:28:27,829
Rym: Only cool people need apply and we ended up having exactly nine people in the tournament and even Scott Johnson was one of them.

360
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:39,030
Scott: Well, of course guy Johnson He wasn't gonna miss out, you know Because if I can't play in it and you can't play in it He's like, ooh the people I know who are better than me are not playing.

361
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:43,270
Scott: I think I will enter this tournament seeing as I own the game of rampart?

362
00:28:43,531 --> 00:28:46,550
Rym: Yeah, even though he owns it on a GameCube and it's really not the same.

363
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:49,670
Rym: I mean, I'm not undefeated on the GameCube version.

364
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:55,870
Rym: In fact me Scott and the other Scott win in fairly equal amounts just because we play the game I can constantly.

365
00:28:56,891 --> 00:29:01,170
Rym: But on the arcade machine the actual physical arcade machine I am to this day undefeated.

366
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:04,490
Scott: Yeah, well, I think what it is real close though.

367
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:12,663
Scott: Well, see cuz that's what it comes down to is when I used to play rampart way back on the machine only I sucked bad then playing on the GameCube.

368
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:13,970
Scott: I got really good.

369
00:29:14,095 --> 00:29:22,342
Scott: Yeah Now I went back to the arcade machine for the first time in years and I I was still really good But not as good as the GameCube like.

370
00:29:22,402 --> 00:29:31,358
Scott: I could do the trackball now But I would still get a flub once in a while and that flub would always do me in Rym wouldn't get any flubs because he likes the track.

371
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:41,370
Rym: because for me the GameCube controller is so inadequate for rampart and by using That giant heavy trackball I can lay down pieces two or three times faster than I can on the GameCube.

372
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:50,763
Scott: See I want to play rampart with a mouse and then I can use the scroll wheel to rotate the pieces and Click to shoot the cannonballs, then that would be the best rampart ever.

373
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,630
Rym: See that would actually throw off my strategy.

374
00:29:52,731 --> 00:29:57,599
Rym: I think I do better with the trackball than I ever could with them Because other people can't do the trackball.

375
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,056
Scott: if other people could use the trackball as well as I could use a mouse Then you'd be in for.

376
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:05,930
Rym: but it's not just that because remember the game where you were winning for a while.

377
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:10,510
Rym: You're like, oh shit I'm gonna beat rims undefeated streak and he'll have to shut up about that forever.

378
00:30:11,193 --> 00:30:13,523
Rym: And you were ahead by points and you were all excited.

379
00:30:13,865 --> 00:30:20,990
Rym: and then right at the end When it's coming down to the final wire, it had nothing to do with you making a flub of positioning anything.

380
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:25,910
Rym: You just put two cannons in really stupid places and that alone caused you to lose.

381
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:39,001
Rym: Yeah, even so if I had a man I had there was a flub I had earlier in that entire series of Battles, it wouldn't have mattered because you still would have put the cannons in those stupid places and then two rounds later I finally exploited it.

382
00:30:39,021 --> 00:30:40,070
Scott: No, that's alright.

383
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:51,110
Rym: Anyway, I mean what it but any the level of thought we put into rampart as our group of friends the front row crew is Probably frightening to keep average normal boggle type human beings.

384
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:57,610
Rym: But I think part of we argue about like, you know kung-fu fighters would talk about he uses the crane stance.

385
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,279
Rym: Well, he uses the crab technique.

386
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:01,430
Rym: We're just like that when it comes to rampart.

387
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:17,800
Scott: I think part of it is that rampart is is a very playable old-school arcade game that has a very Direct me versus you directly damaging the other guy game style Which other old-school arcade games tend to not have.

388
00:31:18,181 --> 00:31:21,668
Rym: it also has the three player simultaneous Which gives you this?

389
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:26,190
Rym: You know player versus player versus player and then you don't have to just worry about doing as best as you can.

390
00:31:26,613 --> 00:31:28,889
Rym: You have to worry about who to attack and when.

391
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:36,338
Rym: Yeah, when to gang up on someone when to form an alliance when to just totally screw someone at the last second with a final Well-placed cannonball.

392
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,070
Scott: All right shows not on rampart.

393
00:31:38,311 --> 00:31:44,098
Rym: Yeah, however getting these people in at the 1 a.m Tournament the nine people in that actually joined the tournament.

394
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,645
Rym: They were so hardcore about the game.

395
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,190
Rym: It was totally awesome.

396
00:31:48,462 --> 00:31:58,610
Scott: Yep I had a Street Fighter 1 tournament because I thought it'd be humorous to see if I could get people to actually play this Terrible terrible game because Street Fighter 1 if you've never played it is ass.

397
00:31:59,272 --> 00:32:06,859
Scott: Well, I I was playing Street Fighter 1 and I could get you know to do the hurricane kick But I couldn't do the uppercut or the fireball.

398
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:09,810
Rym: Well, the hurricane kick was hit up and fears kick.

399
00:32:10,432 --> 00:32:12,140
Scott: No, you actually had to do the hurricane kick.

400
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:12,963
Scott: No, you didn't.

401
00:32:13,204 --> 00:32:13,988
Scott: I'm pretty sure you did.

402
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:14,570
Scott: We'll look it up.

403
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,029
Rym: I just hit up and kick and it did it.

404
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,983
Scott: I did the hurricane kick maneuver to do it, but we'll check that out on the Internet's.

405
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:21,970
Rym: doesn't the hurricane kick maneuver eventually involve?

406
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:22,933
Rym: Going up and kick.

407
00:32:23,254 --> 00:32:25,221
Scott: No, it's down down and away.

408
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:27,770
Scott: It's down down and away away kick.

409
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:33,249
Rym: Well, no up and kick did it and me and Scott Johnson were up and up and kicking each other for a while, huh?

410
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,555
Scott: I'll have to go look into that.

411
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:37,710
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, I doubt anyone wrote a fact on that game.

412
00:32:38,102 --> 00:32:52,169
Scott: Yep so I got five people to five or six people to play in a Street Fighter 1 tournament and the guys who made it to the End were actually a lot pretty good and they were using fireballs all over the place and I was like, holy shit How the hell they get this shitty old game to do that?

413
00:32:53,452 --> 00:32:54,680
Scott: It was pretty entertaining for me.

414
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,989
Scott: At least I got what I wanted out of it.

415
00:32:56,271 --> 00:33:04,130
Rym: My favorite part was throughout the day ever since Scott put up the sign about the tournament people kept coming up and asking What version of Street Fighter alpha double X beta?

416
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:10,510
Scott: And I would say that one and I'd point at Street Fighter 1 the machine sitting right there if you like.

417
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:15,646
Rym: Oh see this is what you could tell another just like the rampart thing the cool people from the not cool people.

418
00:33:15,846 --> 00:33:20,544
Rym: because when you when Scott Pointed the cool people were to go bad ass and put their name down and not cool.

419
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:22,270
Rym: People would go and walk away.

420
00:33:22,872 --> 00:33:27,709
Scott: Yeah, I think I've learned something about running video game tournaments because I haven't really run that many in my life.

421
00:33:28,194 --> 00:33:39,870
Scott: Is that if you have a sign-up sheet You need to start out with a name on it because a lot of people like at least three or four people came up Saw that the sheet was empty and they wouldn't sign up because the sheet was empty.

422
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:46,210
Scott: Personally, I would sign up if the sheet was empty because that might mean an automatic prize without having to do anything.

423
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:49,730
Scott: But people don't like to sign up for tournaments if they see it's unpopular.

424
00:33:49,972 --> 00:33:59,148
Scott: So if you're ever running a video game tournament Don't put out a sign-up sheet Until you have one name on it and that way as soon as the sheet goes out people actually start signing on.

425
00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:02,238
Rym: actually What worked well for the Saturday 3 a.m.

426
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:04,605
Rym: Rampart tournament was saying no sign-up necessary.

427
00:34:04,665 --> 00:34:06,230
Rym: Just be here at 3 will find you.

428
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:15,244
Rym: yeah, the problem is there was a security incident where they had to close the front door for a little bit and Scott and I use this as an excuse to get the hell out of there and go to bed.

429
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:16,690
Scott: That was a good time.

430
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:20,641
Rym: Yeah, oh well those in all day ever since the 1 a.m.

431
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:26,078
Rym: Rampart tournament all day people kept seeing me and saying Dude, there's another rampart tournament today, right?

432
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:26,639
Rym: Right?

433
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,370
Rym: It's gonna be continues instead of last man standing, right?

434
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,429
Rym: I want to fight for points instead of sudden death.

435
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:38,753
Scott: Yeah, and there are also people who wanted to have like Marvel Madness and joust tournaments and I was like, yeah We'll do that.

436
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:39,877
Scott: Sunday didn't happen.

437
00:34:40,217 --> 00:34:40,639
Rym: Yeah, let's see.

438
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:43,489
Rym: I would have been more inclined to do it except the PA system wasn't so great.

439
00:34:43,571 --> 00:34:46,168
Rym: So it was actually really hard to announce anything to the room.

440
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:47,733
Scott: Yes, that's cuz.

441
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,960
Scott: they had those video games on there which made it more to know.

442
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:53,193
Rym: it was more because the full PA system wasn't That.

443
00:34:53,253 --> 00:34:55,668
Rym: also there weren't any speakers on the other side of the room.

444
00:34:55,771 --> 00:35:01,173
Scott: Yeah We had to turn it up pretty like we had to turn it in order to hear our audio on the on the other side Of the room.

445
00:35:01,514 --> 00:35:04,469
Scott: we had to turn it up so loud that it hurt you on our side of the room.

446
00:35:05,332 --> 00:35:07,970
Rym: So on the right side of the room is from our perspective.

447
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,661
Rym: They had two projectors on either side of us.

448
00:35:10,023 --> 00:35:23,430
Rym: for most of the time They had some Xbox 360 action go in there but next year I'm gonna petition for them to put some sort of old-school multiplayer game there instead or Anything cool in multiplayer instead of just watching someone kill zombies.

449
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:27,242
Scott: Yeah, they had a zombie game and then they had steel battalion, which didn't work.

450
00:35:27,282 --> 00:35:31,829
Scott: So well, well the Xbox 360 kept crashing Yeah, and then they put guitar hero up there.

451
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,597
Rym: Which guitar hero was great?

452
00:35:33,657 --> 00:35:36,910
Rym: Sunday when I didn't want to play music anymore because it provided music to the room.

453
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:41,067
Scott: Yeah, it was good, but I wouldn't want it there while I want to play music.

454
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:44,804
Scott: Yeah Yeah, just you know because of me not because guitar is bad.

455
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:46,029
Rym: now to the left of us.

456
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:47,981
Rym: Well, I'm just gonna play this clip.

457
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:51,336
Rym: We recorded at the con All right.

458
00:35:51,376 --> 00:35:52,383
Scott: So this is game.

459
00:35:52,403 --> 00:35:56,459
Scott: This is Video game called pop and music and it's a beat.

460
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:58,405
Scott: It's a konami be money rhythm game.

461
00:35:58,445 --> 00:36:03,226
Scott: Just like DDR and What else is be money beat mania, of course with the name.

462
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,150
Rym: be money all that crap.

463
00:36:04,812 --> 00:36:07,120
Scott: Yeah, guitar heroes not actually konami.

464
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,307
Scott: So it's not be money even though it's also a rhythm game.

465
00:36:09,387 --> 00:36:14,830
Rym: same kind of game Those are freaks is be money or you interact with a game in some sort of rhythmic manner.

466
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:17,270
Scott: Yeah, so pop and music is a game.

467
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,750
Scott: I've heard the name and I knew it was a rhythm game, but I never actually seen it.

468
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,200
Scott: Well now I see it right in front of me a guy's playing it.

469
00:36:23,762 --> 00:36:27,910
Scott: He's basically got these nine hand-sized buttons.

470
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:36,181
Scott: they're real big like big bubbles to pop and There's five in the bottom row and four in the top row and they're different colors.

471
00:36:36,743 --> 00:36:49,007
Scott: There's like blue yellow green red clear and On the screen there's these little lines that are falling at the different colors really quickly and he's got to hit the buttons At the right time.

472
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:57,930
Rym: Yeah But the thing is it's not like a drumming game or a piano playing game or anything and that the buttons other than being rhythmic Don't seem to have anything to do with the music.

473
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,979
Scott: It's sort of arbitrary like you're not playing an instrument.

474
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:03,725
Scott: You're not simulating playing an instrument.

475
00:37:03,745 --> 00:37:05,190
Scott: You're not simulating dancing.

476
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,069
Scott: I mean at least in beat mania.

477
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:13,327
Scott: You're technically simulating being a DJ even though it's not even close to what really DJing is like this game.

478
00:37:13,387 --> 00:37:19,026
Scott: It's simulating Hitting a bunch of buttons that are real big real fast like it's simulating itself.

479
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,245
Scott: I Don't know what the hell is.

480
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:29,082
Rym: Last year it was set up in the exact same spot and because I wasn't staffed at the video game room I just kind of ignored it like I saw it.

481
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,390
Rym: I was like, oh, it's that thing.

482
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,888
Rym: I've seen that before whatever and I totally didn't even think about it.

483
00:37:33,592 --> 00:37:42,570
Rym: But now here there's a little dispute because they wanted to you know Have their game and use the sound system for the room to play it and we want to use the sound system to play Derek the bandit sound Republic.

484
00:37:42,878 --> 00:37:43,268
Scott: That's right.

485
00:37:43,872 --> 00:37:54,870
Scott: But no people kept coming up and asking like when this game was gonna be here and stuff and now that it's here You know these like five or six guys who asked about her all lined up gathering around it Like it's the greatest thing ever.

486
00:37:54,890 --> 00:38:00,516
Rym: No The thing is I'm pretty sure that it was almost the exact same group of people from last year Maybe but it seems like it's.

487
00:38:00,596 --> 00:38:04,810
Scott: it's a very niche game and I think personally think it's kind of a sad game.

488
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:10,550
Rym: Yeah, I just I don't know I guess because it looks impressive like they let him set it up on the big projector.

489
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:13,943
Rym: if I ran this con I do what Otakon does and just stick it on a TV in.

490
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:17,437
Scott: this is definitely a game that Only deserves to be on a TV.

491
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:18,080
Rym: anything.

492
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,290
Rym: guitar heroes should be out here on the big thing.

493
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:25,788
Scott: I know it really doesn't make sense which games they've chosen to go on the projectors and which one they've chosen to go.

494
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:30,370
Rym: like this Games, no one plays this game who doesn't already play this game?

495
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,485
Rym: Like there's no newbie who walks up like oh this looks cool and tries to play it.

496
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:37,730
Scott: Yep Plus guitar hero is probably the number one game of this con by far.

497
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:44,365
Rym: Yeah, I mean honestly if you had a video game room that had like ten guitar heroes They would all see constant action through an entire con.

498
00:38:44,527 --> 00:38:45,452
Scott: pretty much The game

499
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:48,689
Rym: is as popular as DDR was when it hit its peak

500
00:38:49,431 --> 00:38:53,468
Scott: Yep, plus also what I would do is since these two projectors are in this old-school

501
00:38:53,528 --> 00:38:53,749
Scott: room

502
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,769
Scott: Personally, I would have plugged in main cabinets to both of them

503
00:38:57,232 --> 00:38:58,236
Scott: Yeah, and I would have kept

504
00:38:58,276 --> 00:39:00,505
Scott: all the other gate the newer games in the other room

505
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:02,514
Rym: or something I don't I would have used.

506
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:03,759
Rym: I would've done something differently.

507
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:07,676
Scott: I would have like an NES plugged into one of them That's a good call an Atari.

508
00:39:07,716 --> 00:39:09,684
Scott: We could have had our Atari plugged into one if we brought it.

509
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:10,889
Rym: Yeah, but we didn't bring.

510
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,999
Scott: right now What do they have on the other one dead rising?

511
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,804
Scott: No one's playing it.

512
00:39:14,005 --> 00:39:14,970
Rym: However, no one's playing it.

513
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,657
Rym: So maybe we'll hook something up to it.

514
00:39:16,697 --> 00:39:19,569
Rym: Maybe we'll go steal a system like guitar heroes and slip it in here.

515
00:39:20,173 --> 00:39:21,805
Scott: Yeah, I don't know cuz I don't want.

516
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:26,989
Scott: no no I don't think a music game works well when we're trying to play music and it depends like I'm thinking late at night.

517
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:30,180
Scott: Late at night anything goes of course because no one will be.

518
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,243
Rym: yeah in general.

519
00:39:31,304 --> 00:39:32,467
Rym: I guess I would segregate more.

520
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:37,744
Rym: I mean Otakon is the problem in their video game room where it's so loud.

521
00:39:37,824 --> 00:39:45,930
Rym: You can't talk to anyone You can't do anything like we walked in with Jess and all them We couldn't even communicate among ourselves as to which game we wanted to play.

522
00:39:46,232 --> 00:39:49,410
Rym: We had to point and nod and pick up controllers and gesture.

523
00:39:50,491 --> 00:39:53,747
Rym: Here we're really trying to keep it quiet enough to where people can play and it seems like a good mix.

524
00:39:53,767 --> 00:40:05,113
Rym: and the other room is doing this similar thing only with different music and They really should put all the music games either like on the far end of the room away from the DJ front of the room Or something.

525
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:07,259
Scott: I don't know they dated other.

526
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,030
Scott: the problem is that the all their PA equipment didn't show up because someone sucks.

527
00:40:11,512 --> 00:40:16,150
Rym: Yeah, I think one of our plans might be later tonight when the room comes more of a cool vibe.

528
00:40:16,652 --> 00:40:17,877
Rym: We'll get that to shut down.

529
00:40:18,158 --> 00:40:21,170
Rym: We'll play music and we'll make this like a happening room like we'll do stop.

530
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:22,476
Scott: I think it's a good idea.

531
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:25,350
Rym: It will make this kind of like the late-night party with Rym and Scott.

532
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,595
Scott: Yeah, just some advice for anyone running a con.

533
00:40:28,437 --> 00:40:39,761
Scott: if you need something like desperately like you need X equipment for your con to function like let's say you need a PA system and Joe one of the staff or someone says I have a PA system.

534
00:40:39,861 --> 00:40:41,387
Scott: I'll bring it and say good.

535
00:40:41,447 --> 00:40:42,370
Scott: Can you bring it on Friday?

536
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:43,550
Scott: Yes, I'll bring it on Friday.

537
00:40:44,431 --> 00:40:49,228
Scott: Make sure you get them to sign a contract that says they will bring it on Friday and then sue them if they don't.

538
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:56,473
Scott: otherwise You need to go and find a real place and rent a system or else your con will probably not end up with the system They need.

539
00:40:56,513 --> 00:40:58,590
Rym: you really just have to be smart about it.

540
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,210
Rym: I mean we didn't make our friend text sign anything when he's all we did his life.

541
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:02,612
Rym: But the thing

542
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:03,437
Scott: is because we know

543
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:04,564
Scott: he was reliable in text

544
00:41:04,585 --> 00:41:05,450
Rym: was rock-solid.

545
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:17,444
Rym: He'd always show up like two hours late But we planned on that and he planned on that just like everyone involved planned on him being two hours late and everything still worked On time, but if there is any doubt about you know your stuff not showing up.

546
00:41:17,965 --> 00:41:22,939
Scott: You need to have the backup plan and You know because we didn't have the backup plan.

547
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:25,670
Scott: I mean stuff is working, but it's working sub optimally here.

548
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:29,107
Scott: So yeah, all you convention organizers piece of advice.

549
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:36,334
Rym: well I think the main issue is simply that they planned everything out well, but they didn't plan on Sounds.

550
00:41:36,355 --> 00:41:45,289
Rym: I mean I haven't gone into the other room yet to check out the sound here But even if the equipment weren't different You got to make sure that the rhythm games are far away from the music sources and from the other rhythm games.

551
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:49,189
Scott: Well it's really tough when rhythm games are the most popular thing now.

552
00:41:49,712 --> 00:41:52,950
Scott: Also in the console room a lot of the TVs are turned up kind of loud.

553
00:41:53,573 --> 00:41:54,517
Scott: It's like I don't know.

554
00:41:55,301 --> 00:41:56,707
Scott: I didn't really know what you do about it.

555
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:57,290
Scott: It's kind of tough.

556
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,110
Rym: Yeah, because no con has done it better.

557
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,121
Rym: I mean, this is just as good as any other cons video game room in fact.

558
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:07,110
Rym: It's a little better because we're here All right cool.

559
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:19,900
Rym: So now that I've had more time to reflect on it pop and music in my opinion And if anyone disagrees with me, I would love to hear from you is a totally lame game.

560
00:42:20,302 --> 00:42:28,707
Scott: You know what I'm adding to that because I actually went over there And I played pop and music and I actually also played beat mania Which I've seen but never played before.

561
00:42:29,169 --> 00:42:35,189
Scott: and my opinion now after trying both of them Is that both of them are totally lame games.

562
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:38,600
Scott: beat mania and pop and music are equally lame and crappy.

563
00:42:39,273 --> 00:42:52,525
Rym: however Because I mean there's such a novelty I think they're a good thing to have at a con in Retrospect because they always drew a crowd of people who would at least stare at it for a while and go wow That's really weird.

564
00:42:52,565 --> 00:42:53,790
Rym: I've never seen that before.

565
00:42:53,891 --> 00:42:56,655
Rym: they tried to play it once and lose and they'd have a good time And then they'd leave.

566
00:42:57,462 --> 00:43:04,066
Rym: The only bad thing was that the same three guys were pretty much playing at the rest of the time 24/7 throughout the entire con.

567
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:08,960
Scott: it didn't help that their music was loud and annoying over our music.

568
00:43:09,502 --> 00:43:15,120
Rym: We had this huge conundrum now because people would come up to us and complain that the pop and music music was annoying them.

569
00:43:15,521 --> 00:43:30,600
Rym: but if we turn that down the pop and music people would come up and complain that they couldn't hear their music and play their Game and there was no way for us to resolve that situation other than to just kind of keep messing with the volume whenever no one was looking or Say I would change it then not and eventually people stopped complaining.

570
00:43:30,781 --> 00:43:36,160
Scott: there was a great period of relief where no one is playing pop music and That's all I'll say about that now.

571
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,705
Rym: My solution here is very simple.

572
00:43:38,226 --> 00:43:48,580
Rym: what they should do next year is we'll take the all these rhythm games and put them in the same Room, but on the opposite side of the room, you know, two rhythm games should be near each other at all.

573
00:43:48,724 --> 00:43:49,220
Rym: It depends.

574
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:56,082
Rym: I mean guitar heroes can be near DDR and it works because the the type of music is just so different that I don't think it Causes any.

575
00:43:56,102 --> 00:43:59,659
Scott: you can also have a bunch of DDR is near each other because people are used to that.

576
00:44:00,185 --> 00:44:11,739
Rym: Yeah, mostly from arcades Yeah but in the main room all they have to do is take these rhythm games from the other side of the room and Half the room is rhythm game music and then the other half of the room is live DJ and OC remixes.

577
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:20,776
Scott: Oh, well Let's talk very quickly because you didn't spend much time over there about the non video game rooms at kazukan Which are also part of game katsu.

578
00:44:21,098 --> 00:44:25,798
Rym: Yes I gotta give props again to the people who ran the video gaming at kazukan for a great freakin job.

579
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:28,269
Scott: Yep Well at kazukan, what do they have?

580
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:29,233
Scott: They had a larp room.

581
00:44:29,635 --> 00:44:36,933
Scott: They had a Bored Tabletop fish card room and I think another room just maybe a role-playing room.

582
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:38,497
Rym: I think it doesn't matter.

583
00:44:38,538 --> 00:44:39,400
Rym: We walked by.

584
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:51,491
Rym: Yeah, we walked by a couple times and peeked in Larp-room tick typical scary anime larp same as every other anime cut though Actually by walked by it a few more times looking for people and doing things.

585
00:44:52,294 --> 00:44:54,180
Rym: It wasn't as scary as Otakon's larp.

586
00:44:54,972 --> 00:44:55,982
Scott: That's good It was.

587
00:44:56,002 --> 00:45:01,360
Rym: the people seemed to be into it in the way that we were into it when we larped that Cthulhu game way back.

588
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:05,940
Scott: Yeah, actually saw some people, you know, the larp traveling around the con a couple times.

589
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:08,740
Scott: I saw a rock-paper-scissors go down in the artists alley.

590
00:45:08,974 --> 00:45:15,210
Rym: Yeah Which of course we were hanging out with Tex who was running the artist alley and we basically as a group just made fun Of them for like five minutes.

591
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,157
Scott: Yeah, it was pretty good.

592
00:45:17,582 --> 00:45:27,586
Scott: the car the other gaming rooms they were either empty or Kind of sad or one of them was super smelly Super smelly.

593
00:45:27,847 --> 00:45:38,820
Rym: Yeah, I can't blame Katsucon for that because every anime con I've gone to except ConnectiCon if they've had a like a normal tabletop gaming or card gaming room It has always been smelly.

594
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:43,860
Scott: It's always smelly unless it's big because ConnectiCon a big gaming rooms because they were big on gaming.

595
00:45:44,301 --> 00:45:47,974
Scott: But like anime next had the super small gaming room super smelly god.

596
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:49,017
Rym: That was the worst smelling room.

597
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:49,660
Rym: I've ever been in.

598
00:45:50,302 --> 00:45:58,220
Scott: It's like you might have enough physical space for you whatever card or board games are gonna play But you should always have double the space.

599
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,994
Scott: I'm saying from now on is my standard because if you don't the smell will come out.

600
00:46:03,115 --> 00:46:04,860
Rym: guarantee or just strict rules.

601
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,048
Rym: I mean remember anime next had the problem with the smell.

602
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:13,255
Rym: we came back an hour later and a certain person was Conspicuously missing from the room and the room did not smell anymore.

603
00:46:13,617 --> 00:46:14,300
Scott: Oh, that's right.

604
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:21,600
Rym: they put a sign on the thing and they they put a sign up and they left some Lysol out and the fat smelly guy had disappeared.

605
00:46:22,348 --> 00:46:26,851
Scott: Yeah, Oh Gaming rooms tend to smell the ones that Katsucon smelled also.

606
00:46:27,111 --> 00:46:29,860
Rym: the thing is video gaming rooms tend to not smell so badly.

607
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:31,720
Rym: I wonder if it's the demographics.

608
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,080
Scott: Well, it depends on the video gaming room.

609
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,214
Scott: Like if you have a bunch of DDRs in a small room smell is gonna happen.

610
00:46:38,475 --> 00:46:40,000
Rym: true plus a Katsucon.

611
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:40,341
Rym: At least.

612
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:45,904
Rym: there was the one DDR with two quality pads a good hard pad and then a typical, you know Octane ignition pad.

613
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:52,959
Rym: enough people were in line at all times that no one smelly Dude could play DDR more than a few minutes at a time.

614
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:56,570
Scott: Yeah, I mean even late at night at 2 a.m.

615
00:46:56,851 --> 00:46:58,916
Scott: You had to wait in line at least a couple.

616
00:46:58,956 --> 00:47:00,682
Scott: get a couple songs to play DDR.

617
00:47:00,783 --> 00:47:01,607
Rym: god, it was nuts.

618
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:04,380
Rym: This this is why I have such props in this video game room.

619
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:04,926
Rym: I mean one.

620
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:06,300
Rym: the con was alright.

621
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:07,160
Rym: We'll talk about it tomorrow.

622
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:18,360
Rym: But there wasn't a lot going on at the con and it other than the like the cosplay lobby The video game area of Katsucon was like the hot shit and that is where everyone went all the time.

623
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,207
Rym: That's where all the action was at this time.

624
00:47:20,468 --> 00:47:21,592
Scott: Yeah, I mean the con.

625
00:47:21,652 --> 00:47:22,877
Scott: the programming was sort of.

626
00:47:22,937 --> 00:47:24,603
Scott: it wasn't bad But it was light.

627
00:47:24,944 --> 00:47:32,400
Scott: so there would be many hours of the day in which you'd be spending all your time in this hotel Where you wouldn't have anything that you really wanted to do.

628
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:41,840
Scott: So your options were go to the dealers room go the artists alley and once you've done those is not really point doing them again Except on Sunday to get a discount in the dealers room.

629
00:47:43,102 --> 00:47:47,120
Scott: You know go see anything you haven't seen already like the art show which you can go see once.

630
00:47:47,662 --> 00:47:55,440
Scott: But the only thing that you could always revert to besides sit in the hallway and do nothing Was go to the video game room.

631
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:02,920
Scott: So a lot of people would keep coming back to the game room when the other stuff, you know Wasn't up to snuff and there was nothing exciting to going on.

632
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:03,420
Rym: Yeah.

633
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:09,622
Rym: So despite the fact that we went to the rave at like 1 and dance for an hour and we come back to the video Game room thinking.

634
00:48:09,683 --> 00:48:10,847
Rym: All right, we're sweaty.

635
00:48:10,908 --> 00:48:21,300
Rym: Anyway, let's play some DDR and some guitar heroes and go to bed And then we have to wait a half hour to play more DDR And then we just couldn't even get into anywhere near the guitar heroes machine.

636
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:30,806
Scott: Yeah, I mean other than the artists alley which you know while it was open 24/7 not all the artists sat there 24/7.

637
00:48:30,806 --> 00:48:35,020
Rym: Yeah, the artist alley was definitely this quiet subdued area at night Like there were people hanging out there.

638
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:40,459
Rym: It was mostly hush conversations and giggling or I saw 13 year olds making out at one point.

639
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:46,718
Rym: That is not how you react to 13 year olds making out.

640
00:48:46,738 --> 00:48:51,971
Scott: I Just kind of reacted to the making out without processing the 13 year old fart.

641
00:48:52,413 --> 00:48:52,894
Rym: Great.

642
00:48:53,376 --> 00:48:56,619
Scott: Yeah, there was a Mostly watching those 13 year olds.

643
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:04,663
Rym: There was a preponderance of 13 year olds making out at this con as was reported to us by our reporters in the field as they Went around the con.

644
00:49:05,466 --> 00:49:06,791
Scott: I didn't really notice so much.

645
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:09,280
Scott: Actually the con did feel older than other con.

646
00:49:09,423 --> 00:49:10,180
Rym: That's what I was saying.

647
00:49:10,402 --> 00:49:16,054
Scott: Like there were high school kids there But they tended to be mostly older high school kids and there were less middle.

648
00:49:16,075 --> 00:49:17,500
Scott: there were like almost no middle school kids.

649
00:49:17,581 --> 00:49:21,573
Rym: See, that's what I love about Katsucon And I've said this last year too and even the year before.

650
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:29,400
Rym: before we did GeekNights But I still said it that Katsucon's demographic is very much targeted more people our age.

651
00:49:30,521 --> 00:49:36,707
Rym: And as a result, there's a lot more, you know drinking but not you know, stupid drinking except for a few occasions We ran into that.

652
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:37,737
Rym: We'll talk about tomorrow.

653
00:49:43,088 --> 00:49:50,880
Rym: Yeah, but seriously with it the con is older and the crowd is generally more subdued and more I don't want to say intellectual because that's definitely not the case.

654
00:49:51,402 --> 00:49:56,909
Rym: But there was a lot more, you know, cool people hanging around in the bar cool people Just kind of hanging around talking to each other.

655
00:49:56,929 --> 00:50:01,528
Rym: There wasn't so much kids running around screaming Yeah, almost no middle school kids.

656
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:06,627
Scott: So definitely a plus I guess for us but other people who knows what they care about.

657
00:50:06,968 --> 00:50:12,132
Rym: now an interesting thing that I never thought of but became an issue this year with This con and probably with other cons too.

658
00:50:12,173 --> 00:50:12,758
Rym: Was that now?

659
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,927
Rym: Wireless controllers are becoming the thing more and more.

660
00:50:16,429 --> 00:50:20,060
Scott: Yeah, you got wiimotes you got 360 wireless controllers.

661
00:50:20,581 --> 00:50:23,248
Scott: You know, I aren't the six axis controllers wireless.

662
00:50:23,629 --> 00:50:24,271
Rym: I guess so.

663
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:25,534
Scott: I think they are not sure.

664
00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:27,419
Rym: not like anyone wants a ps3.

665
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:29,630
Rym: It's not like they even have a ps3 there.

666
00:50:30,132 --> 00:50:31,298
Rym: What game would they put on it?

667
00:50:31,438 --> 00:50:31,740
Scott: I don't know.

668
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,020
Scott: I don't think they had any anyway.

669
00:50:34,481 --> 00:50:36,068
Scott: But yeah, you have a wireless controller.

670
00:50:36,109 --> 00:50:37,555
Scott: So okay someone comes up.

671
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:38,580
Scott: They want to play a game.

672
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,108
Scott: You give them a wireless controller.

673
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:41,776
Scott: now, they get up and walk away.

674
00:50:41,797 --> 00:50:47,820
Rym: Oops So the way katsu got handle this was basically to set up a bag check at the entrance to the video game room.

675
00:50:48,322 --> 00:50:50,613
Rym: you had to check your bag in order to get in.

676
00:50:50,653 --> 00:50:51,216
Rym: you could claim it.

677
00:50:51,236 --> 00:51:02,860
Rym: when you went out and Despite the chaos of the fact that a lot of people were trying to go in and out of this room constantly at all hours They had their shit together and that bag check worked as well as it could possibly work.

678
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:09,000
Scott: Well on Friday the bag check worked kind of a but then they realized that it was a problem which is a good thing.

679
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:09,905
Scott: You know most cons.

680
00:51:09,925 --> 00:51:12,257
Scott: they have a problem and the problem stays for the whole con.

681
00:51:12,297 --> 00:51:14,009
Scott: and yet you just go Uh, and they fix it.

682
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:15,520
Scott: next year katsu-kan.

683
00:51:15,841 --> 00:51:22,063
Scott: They shut down the game room at Friday at midnight for an hour and fix the bag check the best they could with the available Resource.

684
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:26,107
Rym: Yeah, they called all the staff over including us and they're like, alright How do we make this work better?

685
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:28,440
Rym: and we gave we put forth an idea that worked well enough.

686
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:37,260
Rym: Yep, I got some better ideas for next year that they play if we can plan ahead a little bit Yeah, and immediately now they're already thinking about how to streamline it or eliminate it for next year.

687
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:38,788
Scott: So awesome props.

688
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:46,818
Rym: and seriously as far as I saw One bag was lost in the entire con and they found it in fairly short order.

689
00:51:46,838 --> 00:51:51,400
Scott: Awesome Yeah, but how do you what else they do about this wireless controller problem?

690
00:51:51,887 --> 00:51:52,639
Scott: It was pretty simple.

691
00:51:53,342 --> 00:51:58,600
Scott: They would keep the wireless controllers at a desk and if you wanted one you had to give up your badge.

692
00:51:59,202 --> 00:52:04,820
Scott: So if you walked off with the controller, all right, you're gonna get caught without your badge and then you're screwed.

693
00:52:05,534 --> 00:52:13,793
Rym: of course you could buy another replacement badge if you lost it for $10 and It probably wouldn't filter back right away because eventually they would probably figure out.

694
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:15,860
Rym: Hey, I've got this kid's badge.

695
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:17,431
Rym: He just bought a replacement badge.

696
00:52:17,632 --> 00:52:18,740
Rym: I see what's going on here.

697
00:52:19,142 --> 00:52:20,792
Rym: I don't think you thought your cover plan all the way through.

698
00:52:20,832 --> 00:52:22,140
Scott: I mean, they all had walkie-talkies.

699
00:52:22,502 --> 00:52:26,500
Scott: So it would probably the con had a whole loss prevention department.

700
00:52:26,922 --> 00:52:32,392
Scott: I'm sure they had their stuff together and if someone wanted to buy a replacement badge They had probably just walkie-talkie.

701
00:52:32,412 --> 00:52:39,100
Scott: the video game room like hey Did so-and-so take a wireless controller and doesn't matter because no one tried to pull that shit.

702
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:42,080
Scott: Cuz it's really so difficult to get away with it.

703
00:52:42,341 --> 00:52:44,431
Scott: The risk is high and the reward is low.

704
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:46,220
Scott: You don't have to be an idiot to even try.

705
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:48,729
Rym: I don't know when it comes to the wiimotes though.

706
00:52:49,452 --> 00:52:49,893
Scott: It's true.

707
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:51,760
Rym: We most are valuable commodity.

708
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:52,463
Scott: They had.

709
00:52:52,524 --> 00:52:55,700
Scott: they had the Wii area sort of cordoned off with tables.

710
00:52:56,001 --> 00:53:00,580
Scott: It's like you had to get into the Wii area mostly because people in there would be swinging around.

711
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:08,120
Rym: Yeah Apparently there was one incident where some poor girl lost her grip on her remote and being one of the staffers in the face.

712
00:53:08,562 --> 00:53:11,940
Scott: Oh, I don't know how true that is, but I guess I'll pretend it's true because it's funny.

713
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:15,959
Rym: Well, it was in the staff email list and I read it like 10 minutes ago.

714
00:53:17,144 --> 00:53:23,680
Scott: Well, it could have been just a joke But anyway, yeah, the Wii area was sort of cordoned off and I think they had staff watching it at all times.

715
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:26,714
Scott: So you'd have to be real slick to make off with a wiimote.

716
00:53:27,377 --> 00:53:28,583
Rym: and the other side They also.

717
00:53:28,603 --> 00:53:30,956
Rym: a nice thing they had was in the normal video game room.

718
00:53:31,016 --> 00:53:37,340
Rym: on the other room They had a bunch of couches kind of lined up in the corner and it was half a crash area.

719
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,158
Rym: You know relax chill a bit half a bust out your DS's and play DS games area.

720
00:53:42,258 --> 00:53:45,720
Scott: Yeah at first I thought it was just a cool sit-down and rest area.

721
00:53:45,861 --> 00:53:48,838
Scott: You know cuz they had all these couches covered in sheets so that no one messed them up.

722
00:53:49,341 --> 00:53:53,360
Scott: Cuz there were really fancy couches and they didn't want scuzzy gamers messing up the couches.

723
00:53:53,882 --> 00:53:59,318
Scott: But then I saw people with their DS's there and I was like, oh that's what those couches are for clever

724
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:18,294
Rym: Granted in the video game room at one point we wrote on one of our white boards channel B picto chat whoo, and we just stayed in picture chat to see what happened and Immediately someone joined and typed yo /b/ which I immediately recognized as some sort of 4chan glyph

725
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:20,340
Scott: and we stopped picture chatting.

726
00:54:20,522 --> 00:54:22,217
Rym: Yeah, we pretty much ended that right away.

727
00:54:23,464 --> 00:54:29,328
Scott: Apparently now picture chat is no longer for drawing penises But what you do is you're greeting.

728
00:54:29,348 --> 00:54:34,606
Scott: instead of saying hi or yo, you just draw a penis to announce here I am what's up God?

729
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:38,180
Rym: when we had it open pretty much anyone who joins us drew a penis and left.

730
00:54:39,501 --> 00:54:41,767
Rym: It was so I don't know expected.

731
00:54:42,368 --> 00:54:46,359
Scott: I should mod my DS change the firmwares that it's his penis chance that it picked up?

732
00:54:46,379 --> 00:54:46,499
Scott: shit.

733
00:54:48,842 --> 00:54:50,710
Scott: Alright what else went down at the game?

734
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:51,212
Scott: katsu?

735
00:54:51,273 --> 00:54:52,900
Rym: anything else for the most part?

736
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:56,959
Rym: We just kind of emceed the room and hung out playing music and hanging out with cool people.

737
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:06,353
Scott: Yep, giving away CDs giving away flyers telling people about podcasting meeting people Playing video games playing a lot of video games.

738
00:55:06,514 --> 00:55:08,180
Rym: I had a bunch of little and I just chat.

739
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:11,479
Rym: I went up to random people in the video game room and challenged them to games.

740
00:55:12,161 --> 00:55:17,626
Rym: Granted I was being kind of a jerk about it cuz I only challenged people to zookeeper root beer tapper Rampart and Marvel Madness.

741
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:18,489
Scott: Yes.

742
00:55:18,891 --> 00:55:21,000
Scott: Well, you could have challenged that one guy to Marvel Madness.

743
00:55:21,662 --> 00:55:26,228
Rym: Yeah, actually people kept trying to get me to play against him But it never came to be and I wanted to.

744
00:55:26,348 --> 00:55:29,259
Rym: I wanted to watch him win while I lost.

745
00:55:31,601 --> 00:55:32,386
Scott: That would have been funny.

746
00:55:32,406 --> 00:55:33,513
Rym: that would have just been great plus.

747
00:55:33,553 --> 00:55:34,599
Rym: I could have tried to get in his way.

748
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,408
Scott: Maybe that would have been cool truck.

749
00:55:37,448 --> 00:55:40,020
Scott: Can you prevent this guy from winning Marvel Madness?

750
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,956
Rym: I don't think I could have because I mean I play with my whole arms like we go we go.

751
00:55:44,996 --> 00:55:46,000
Rym: we got on that trackball.

752
00:55:46,422 --> 00:55:49,774
Rym: He plays with his whole body, you know, and he played with two hands.

753
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:51,039
Scott: He's like whoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo.

754
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,452
Rym: I did two hands, but I was kind of just padding at it.

755
00:55:53,472 --> 00:56:00,676
Rym: this guy like, you know How you know in a Katana fight samurai like they'll move their ankle and that's like the tell.

756
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,807
Rym: this guy was like that about Marvel Madness.

757
00:56:03,452 --> 00:56:04,400
Scott: he was full out.

758
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,610
Scott: He put his full energy into it like he could.

759
00:56:06,932 --> 00:56:12,230
Scott: if there were more levels in Marvel Madness He'd need to take a rest after like a few more good thing.

760
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,634
Scott: The game's only what five levels?

761
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:17,707
Rym: Yeah, something like that I I once in my entire life.

762
00:56:17,867 --> 00:56:20,736
Rym: I got to the last level and proceeded to lose horribly.

763
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:21,700
Rym: I never got there again.

764
00:56:22,264 --> 00:56:23,655
Scott: Yeah, this guy beats it every time.

765
00:56:23,736 --> 00:56:27,185
Scott: so We're suck We suck.

766
00:56:27,729 --> 00:56:29,983
Rym: Well, yeah, that was our cursory You know.

767
00:56:30,205 --> 00:56:32,820
Rym: early presentation of Katsucon's video gaming.

768
00:56:33,542 --> 00:56:40,875
Rym: Tomorrow we're gonna have the actual full coverage of the con because we'll finally be fully rested and we'll finally remember all the stuff We wanted to talk about.

769
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:47,660
Scott: Yeah, Oh Katsucon the awesome gaming at Katsucon big and awesome.

770
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,968
Rym: Yeah, Katsucon is totally badass.

771
00:56:50,109 --> 00:56:58,679
Rym: And if you ever want to go to an anime con, you know I recommend going to Otakon and I recommend going to Katsucon and happily they're both right next to each other.

772
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:04,460
Rym: Yeah, so you can start con season with Katsucon and ended on Otakon and have a damn good summer.

773
00:57:04,602 --> 00:57:15,220
Scott: Yeah, Katsucon I think is actually a great con if you've never been to cons before and because if the programming remains light You know, you're not stressed all you know, you're not all stressed out.

774
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:20,479
Scott: You gotta you can feel your way around a con without having to do a big serious one right away.

775
00:57:20,539 --> 00:57:24,940
Rym: OMG It's also not as difficult to navigate as Otakon.

776
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:30,680
Rym: I mean the hotel layout is a little confusing, but you'll figure out where stuff is pretty much right away.

777
00:57:30,901 --> 00:57:34,799
Scott: It's basically a stick with a Y on one end and a T on the other end.

778
00:57:35,342 --> 00:57:45,120
Rym: Also the fact that it's in a hotel meaning most of the people that are staying at the hotel Really really sets it apart from because pretty much all the cons bigger than this aren't in hotels anymore.

779
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,210
Rym: They're all in convention centers.

780
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,801
Rym: They can't go 24/7.

781
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:48,825
