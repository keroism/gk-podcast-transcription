1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,649
Scott: It's Thursday March 29th.

2
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:12,752
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:15,080
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:20,579
Scott: Tonight we discuss all kinds of weapons and other various armaments.

5
00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:23,278
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:33,509
Rym: You might all recall that yesterday I brought up the visigoths aka our friends and the holy terror that they unleashed upon our house over the D&D weekend.

7
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,081
Rym: is there Want to do well?

8
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:35,464
Rym: today?

9
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:35,504
Rym: I?

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:55,933
Rym: Discovered one final insult one last injustice that I did not know about until I reached for the Thin Mints And I discovered that someone had eaten all of the Thin Mints yet Carefully replaced the Thin Mint box into its original location thereby deceiving all What.

11
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:59,050
Scott: you couldn't just throw out the Thin Mint box what I mean?

12
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:08,427
Scott: There's so much crap that they take out and just leave lying around living room or fill up the trash can and don't empty it But that they they take trash and they put it back.

13
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:12,202
Rym: well I guess luckily I'm too clever for them.

14
00:01:12,262 --> 00:01:21,910
Rym: you see before they all came over I was up there looking for some peanuts And I realized that were I to leave the Thin Mints within easy reach of anyone they would all be eaten.

15
00:01:22,493 --> 00:01:25,410
Rym: So I took one of the whole tubes of Thin Mints that are in there.

16
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,327
Rym: You know there's two tubes of Thin Mints in any box of Thin Mints?

17
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:33,908
Rym: yep And I hid it in the back behind a bunch of snacks that they wouldn't eat because I know they don't eat that stuff.

18
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:46,558
Rym: and Sure enough I threw away the empty Thin Mints box which was now I guess serving as a decoy retrieved the untouched Thin Mints and proceeded to eat half of them, haha Hidden Thin Mint for the win.

19
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,511
Rym: so to whichever of you Visigoths stole all of our Thin Mints Owned.

20
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:52,735
Rym: yeah, that's right.

21
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:57,050
Scott: I think for now on we're just gonna have to hide all the good food somewhere secretly.

22
00:01:57,231 --> 00:02:05,723
Rym: Well, I remember the one time when we just duct tape shut all the cabinets and all we provided was the fridge the red Solo cups and the plastic plates.

23
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:06,970
Scott: duct tape the fridge next time.

24
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:16,890
Rym: Now cuz they luckily now that I stopped stocking soda and all we had was a bunch of juice and seltzer water and tonic water The drinking of our goods went down precipitously.

25
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:20,370
Scott: I think that had a lot to do with the big crate of yu-hu that was brought.

26
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:21,597
Rym: I can't drink that stuff.

27
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:26,886
Scott: I can't drink it either, but if we duct tape the fridge They'll be forced to bring their own beverages and cups.

28
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:38,782
Rym: well You see they'd come in and they wouldn't go for the yu-hu go for the fridge and they'd open it and I'd watch him cuz I'd always be in there doing stuff and they'd look and they'd See Tom Collins and tonic water and seltzer water

29
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:39,906
Scott: and love soda

30
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:43,550
Rym: and all these different carbonated waters and pomegranate juices.

31
00:02:44,193 --> 00:02:44,837
Scott: And they didn't.

32
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:45,339
Scott: pretty much.

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,976
Rym: juices and waters yeah And they didn't find their coca-cola.

34
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:50,220
Rym: and eventually they gave up.

35
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:54,949
Rym: a few people poured various amounts of seltzer Decided they didn't like it and left it sitting out.

36
00:02:56,152 --> 00:02:56,575
Rym: That's fine.

37
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:57,500
Rym: seltzer is almost free.

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,094
Rym: I put it in there mostly as a decoy Yeah, but it's like.

39
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,546
Scott: how could you go get food and then not eat it?

40
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:05,470
Rym: What if you don't like it?

41
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,470
Rym: What if you think I mean at one point someone and this is a legitimate mistake?

42
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:15,270
Rym: Thought they had a one kind of soda soda water and actually had a different kind of soda tonic water.

43
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:16,843
Scott: Do you not know how to read the label?

44
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:17,710
Rym: hey if you're in a hurry?

45
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,610
Rym: And you grab something quickly plus they look the same when you pour them out.

46
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:21,894
Rym: They pretty much smelled the same.

47
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:24,022
Rym: It's not until you drink it you realize wait a minute.

48
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:26,250
Rym: this tastes like water plus quinine.

49
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:27,295
Scott: I don't know.

50
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:27,556
Scott: I don't.

51
00:03:27,617 --> 00:03:30,330
Scott: I don't have a problem pouring incorrect beverages.

52
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,854
Rym: We'll see.

53
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:36,416
Scott: you go and like go to the store and buy some beef But it was really.

54
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:37,361
Scott: you thought it was chicken.

55
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:38,670
Scott: you see you didn't read.

56
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:39,916
Scott: I don't know.

57
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:42,729
Rym: I have occasionally bought the wrong kind of sausage.

58
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:51,450
Rym: Okay, that's all you I think is all sausages look the same when especially when you're buying just from some butcher We just got a bunch of meat and tubes hanging from things.

59
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,958
Scott: That's the one time I will mess up It's not.

60
00:03:53,979 --> 00:04:00,422
Scott: sometimes I'll go to the butcher and I'd be like half a pound of Hebrew national salami And they'll give me half a pound of Hebrew national bologna.

61
00:04:00,462 --> 00:04:01,810
Scott: because they messed up not me.

62
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:02,918
Scott: I asked for the right thing.

63
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:04,108
Scott: they gave me what I didn't ask for.

64
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:07,834
Rym: yeah But if you go to a butcher you don't know much about the kind of meat They've got like.

65
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:14,709
Rym: they've got ten different weird German sausages And you point at one and it might not be the kind of sausage you expect to come out of there.

66
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:18,067
Scott: I don't expect any sausages to come out of there.

67
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:21,909
Rym: Well because you deny one of the greatest kinds of meat in the world.

68
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,346
Rym: Anyway, anyway, what what do you got in the news?

69
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:26,850
Rym: nothing?

70
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,789
Rym: I know you got nothing cuz you were sitting here just now trying to find some news.

71
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:43,329
Scott: Yeah, I had a hard time finding news today cuz I was spending most of my time doing something else, but iTunes the you know provider of digital music that we do not enjoy Has done something that didn't even occur to me ever before.

72
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:46,110
Scott: Apparently on iTunes you know you want to buy a song.

73
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:46,792
Scott: It's a dollar.

74
00:04:46,993 --> 00:04:49,461
Scott: right if you want to buy an album on iTunes.

75
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:51,347
Scott: It's a lot less than $1 per song.

76
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:54,299
Scott: It's not a lot less, but it is less.

77
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,830
Scott: so like maybe a 12 song album would be 10 bucks.

78
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:06,058
Rym: Well it had to be less otherwise I wouldn't even give the option other than maybe having a tag that links all of them together in case someone cares What quote-unquote album they came from.

79
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,764
Scott: so not buying things on iTunes.

80
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:08,787
Scott: this did not occur to me.

81
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:15,230
Scott: that there might be a problem Where you would buy one song from an album and later decide you want the whole album?

82
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:20,065
Scott: And you don't want to pay you know for the whole price again.

83
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:25,905
Rym: You know for the cheap price for the out How often that happened to anime fans in the mid to late 90s and early 2000s?

84
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,680
Scott: We buy one DVD, and then you get the box set.

85
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:31,590
Scott: you'd have this DVD lying there?

86
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:35,588
Rym: Or I remember at one point someone bought like three DVDs of a series.

87
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:36,735
Rym: Are you in the box?

88
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:39,029
Rym: that came out and the box set was?

89
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:42,220
Rym: About the same price as buying all like.

90
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,450
Rym: it was a little bit more than buying the rest of the DVDs normally.

91
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:49,120
Rym: Yet at the same time it was more to buy all the DVDs.

92
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:54,450
Scott: or sometimes you buy issue one of a comic book miniseries And then you won't buy the rest.

93
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,608
Scott: But then the trade paperback will come out and you buy that and then you've got this issue ones in there.

94
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:06,290
Rym: granted I solve that very easily by only ever buying either box sets or individual DVDs when I know I'll never buy the box set.

95
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:22,233
Scott: Well anyway iTunes has added a feature where if you have some songs on an album You can pay to get the whole album at the discounted album price And they'll give you all your dollars back for all the songs that you bought before see.

96
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:28,579
Rym: a lot of artists seem to talk about how the integrity of the album has been destroyed by the fact that you can buy tracks piecemeal.

97
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:37,810
Rym: and While that might normally be true in some ways I do point out that the way Music distribution is morphed over the years.

98
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:50,530
Rym: I would contend that the vast majority of albums released in the United States were not Artistic works created by the people who were in the band in order to convey something or not some sort of unified work.

99
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:59,161
Rym: They were in fact the chef around the two tracks You actually wanted thus forcing you to buy the much more expensive album CD.

100
00:06:59,582 --> 00:06:59,882
Scott: Yes.

101
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:21,981
Scott: I mean if someone actually is a Quote real musician and makes an album full of awesome songs perhaps even an a-side and a b-side which don't mean anything without vinyl anymore, but you know and It's a bunch of songs that go together and to form a larger Musical whole people are probably gonna buy the whole album

102
00:07:22,503 --> 00:07:22,984
Rym: the prop.

103
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:27,777
Scott: the reason people aren't buying whole albums Isn't because they don't have to.

104
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:36,445
Scott: it's because you make one hit song and a bunch of crap And you just put it all in the same disc and people only care about your hit song.

105
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:37,470
Scott: the rest of your music is crap.

106
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:43,630
Rym: Yeah, it's a CD I got and I technically bought it, but I bought it with a gift certificate that I couldn't spend anywhere else.

107
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,193
Rym: So it's not like.

108
00:07:44,273 --> 00:07:46,524
Rym: I wanted to buy it, but I figured out the hell.

109
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:48,938
Rym: mm-hmm when fastball They had this song like.

110
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,289
Rym: where were they going without ever?

111
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:52,509
Rym: no I don't remember what it was called, but I like the song a lot.

112
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:53,538
Scott: I don't even know your song.

113
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:54,909
Scott: you're talking about who fastball is.

114
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:15,320
Rym: Oh Well I really like that song.

115
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:20,757
Rym: for whatever reason I thought all right I'm gonna use this gift certificate and I'm gonna buy the CD.

116
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:27,943
Rym: and I bought the CD and the CD did indeed contain that song and Every other song on the CD was unmitigated garbage.

117
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:29,310
Rym: that wasn't anything like that song.

118
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:35,649
Scott: Yeah, go back and get yourself like a Rolling Stones album or u2 album or a Beatles album.

119
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,863
Rym: Queens Right Elvis album got anything by Queens like the song album.

120
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:43,320
Rym: the songs aren't even just all part of one work But I say Led Zeppelin album.

121
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:44,650
Scott: it needs to be said three times.

122
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,129
Rym: They all actually flow into each other where you have to listen to the whole CD at once or you lose it.

123
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,728
Scott: Yeah, get any album by a real band and put it in your CD player and turn it on.

124
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:57,744
Scott: you know Just get all the mp3s from wherever it.

125
00:08:57,784 --> 00:08:58,870
Rym: the hell's a CD player?

126
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,021
Scott: Yeah, and they play all the mp3s on the album in a row.

127
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:04,750
Scott: you're not gonna find sucky songs.

128
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:06,679
Scott: I mean you get a Beatles album.

129
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,683
Scott: every song is a hit.

130
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:08,929
Scott: every single one.

131
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,575
Scott: This there isn't like you know.

132
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:14,289
Scott: you don't pick up like you know the white album just for one song.

133
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:16,629
Scott: man It doesn't like that today.

134
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:27,650
Scott: it is nothing to do with distribution has to do with songs and I guess it's good that I Apple is doing something to change the crappy iTunes, but this is not enough.

135
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:30,522
Scott: They need to do a lot more before they're getting a dollar from me.

136
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:32,209
Rym: all they need to do is remove the DRM.

137
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:37,026
Rym: I know that's not gonna happen not even gonna pretend that that's an option, but that is really.

138
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:53,576
Rym: there are a couple songs I would probably pay a little bit of money for but the fact that I can't just get an mp3 or a flack or Something that I can use I don't know on my Linux box or on a non iPod in case I decide to buy a non iPod someday yep,

139
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:54,660
Scott: oh well.

140
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:56,065
Scott: We'll see what happens.

141
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,370
Scott: I give it a year.

142
00:09:57,611 --> 00:10:00,361
Scott: I mean there are places we could go to buy music with.

143
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:05,117
Scott: that are just mp3s like emusic.com Or that other place or that Russian site.

144
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,164
Scott: no that one's not totally legit.

145
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:10,190
Scott: super legit ones that are definitely legit It's kind of legitimate.

146
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:14,745
Scott: Yeah, there are ones that we can go to that are a hundred percent legitimate, and we just don't.

147
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:15,648
Scott: so we'll see.

148
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:17,053
Rym: well It doesn't help that.

149
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:21,770
Rym: I really don't like the vast majority of music that comes out anymore.

150
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:25,152
Scott: Well, that's the other thing is places like emusic.com That do.

151
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:28,062
Scott: the mp3s are mostly the indie musics and not the.

152
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:30,250
Scott: the real music is only comes out.

153
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,958
Scott: I mean the the record company.

154
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:34,630
Scott: music only comes out in iTunes and Yahoo and Napster.

155
00:10:34,954 --> 00:10:36,008
Rym: Yeah, but a lot of the indie music.

156
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:39,265
Rym: now I see their websites, and they just give enough of it away for free to save me.

157
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:52,543
Rym: yep, yep Yep, so anyway in China a bunch of people have gotten together with some 300 million dollars to build a 13 mile Long dragon statue 13 mile long.

158
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:54,187
Rym: it's 13 miles long.

159
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:55,370
Rym: It's a Chinese style dragon.

160
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:01,730
Rym: So it's basically a long long snake that from the picture so far is pretty shoddy looking.

161
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:03,850
Scott: Yeah, how big are they making it?

162
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,597
Scott: They're making like a little tiny thing.

163
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:08,490
Scott: that's like you know as far around as my thumb.

164
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,996
Scott: Are they making it big?

165
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:11,321
Rym: that would just be silly.

166
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:13,550
Scott: you can make a really long thin dragon.

167
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:14,238
Scott: That'll be.

168
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:15,270
Scott: I think they'll be much cooler.

169
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:22,700
Rym: it is pretty long and thin because the head is only 30 feet high and I thought this was really cool when I saw the headline.

170
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:33,220
Rym: Oh giant dragon statue and in China OMG I love that stuff, but upon reading the article it looks as though This is a gigantic scan a scam you say.

171
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:40,763
Rym: the investor group is trying to build this 13 mile Long structure as a tourist destination inside of the dragon.

172
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:46,650
Rym: they plan to house galleries where visitors can quote For a fee have their names or other messages inscribed.

173
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,042
Rym: Advertising space on the giant serpent will also be sold.

174
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:51,950
Scott: ah it is a scam.

175
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:55,344
Scott: You know China already has this other really long thing.

176
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:55,786
Scott: It's it's.

177
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:56,750
Scott: it's pretty great.

178
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:59,001
Scott: It sort of looks like a wall.

179
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:00,689
Scott: it keeps out Mongolians.

180
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,424
Rym: It's also contrary to popular belief not visible from space.

181
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:06,326
Rym: god damn it.

182
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:07,209
Scott: No it is not.

183
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:10,141
Scott: however It is a pretty awesome tourist destination.

184
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:12,090
Scott: It is not sold out with advertisements.

185
00:12:12,592 --> 00:12:15,281
Scott: There are no galleries on the inside for all you know.

186
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:17,750
Rym: There's just giant Starbucks all along.

187
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:26,465
Scott: Maybe there is but I'm pretty sure communist don't like Starbucks But I think the joke there was calling China communist.

188
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:38,987
Rym: Yeah, yeah anyway I think the really funny part here is that an investor group began the project in 2002 and abandoned it due to financial Difficulties and now they're out of money, and they're having trouble.

189
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:46,110
Rym: now They're trying to sell this to local people on the idea that it could block sandstorms from hitting their town.

190
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:47,450
Scott: I'll buy it for a dollar.

191
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:51,505
Rym: I'll give him a dollar 45. who you in?

192
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,609
Scott: it's not worth it now.

193
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:55,076
Rym: So I'm disappointed.

194
00:12:55,116 --> 00:13:01,240
Rym: this could have been some sort of awesome news about a 13 mile long dragon But it's actually some really lame news.

195
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,939
Scott: so now that it's about a 13 mile long Corrugated steel tube filled with ads.

196
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:10,961
Scott: so now that you own this dragon for a dollar 45 How many power cards you gonna buy?

197
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:12,329
Scott: how many farmers you gonna put in there?

198
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,294
Rym: Things of the day which we should probably get to before we say something that they don't like.

199
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:28,440
Rym: an anime world order loses it shit Again, oh, yeah, I don't think it's annual.

200
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:35,680
Scott: I don't know more of anime world order might be losing their shit now that I've also insulted their video games.

201
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:45,417
Rym: Well you insult pretty much everyone's video games But anyway my thing of the day up in your crib insulted your video games.

202
00:13:45,538 --> 00:13:46,100
Scott: what now?

203
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:57,493
Rym: so some of my favorite cartoons ever are the Chippendale versus Donald Duck's from Disney back in the day and the Goofy learning how to do something or goofy explaining how to do something.

204
00:13:57,533 --> 00:14:03,999
Rym: things also from back in the day in Disney Like goofy teaches you how to ski or goofy tries to quit smoking.

205
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:06,812
Scott: Goofy golf I think was the best goofy sport.

206
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:07,395
Rym: I don't know.

207
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:08,380
Rym: I like to ski one a lot.

208
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:10,571
Scott: It's all right thing is.

209
00:14:11,114 --> 00:14:14,607
Rym: one of these is Surprisingly relevant to modern times.

210
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:22,595
Rym: in fact while almost all of the other goofies especially the skiing one well They're kind of goofy are really kind of outdated like the jokes.

211
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:27,647
Rym: They make are not particularly I don't know relevant today.

212
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:32,260
Rym: I mean what goofy gets out of his bed in the skiing one And he's got a bunch of hot water bottles.

213
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:37,639
Rym: I don't think anyone listening to this podcast has ever used a hot water bottle knows what it is?

214
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,195
Rym: knows What it would be used for?

215
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,207
Scott: Keeping hot water around?

216
00:14:43,588 --> 00:14:44,812
Rym: no no what would know?

217
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:46,517
Rym: a hot water bottle?

218
00:14:46,577 --> 00:14:48,868
Rym: hot water bag I guess or a bed warmer.

219
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:49,492
Rym: Oh those.

220
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,990
Scott: well if you've ever watched Looney Tunes You know that when you're sick in bed you put one on your head.

221
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:57,405
Rym: Yeah, well goofy has a bed full of them Must have been cold.

222
00:14:57,827 --> 00:15:06,560
Rym: however this one in particular goofy and motor mania Pretty much describes everything about me driving around the Bronx every day.

223
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:11,340
Scott: I'd say it's pretty accurate except for the old style of car.

224
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:15,260
Rym: I don't know how particularly relevant that is to the relevance of goofy.

225
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:20,399
Rym: I mean, it's not like a kid's gonna see that and go what the fuck is that?

226
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:26,320
Rym: It's obviously a car, but I know a lot of kids will look at other goofy stuff, and what's that bag goofy?

227
00:15:27,982 --> 00:15:29,433
Rym: What kind of shoes are those?

228
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:30,258
Scott: I don't know.

229
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,720
Scott: man I could see like a few years to now a kid will look at that and be like what the hell kind of thing is.

230
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:36,754
Scott: Cars used to look like that.

231
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:37,962
Rym: what the fuck It's just like.

232
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:43,833
Rym: in back to the future replays with that our old arcade game in the second one and those kids are like You have to touch it.

233
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:44,620
Rym: It's a baby game.

234
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,638
Rym: Anyway, what do you got for me?

235
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,329
Scott: so This is a puzzling thing of the day in that.

236
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:59,777
Scott: I'm not sure how true it is even though.

237
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:01,969
Scott: It's a video uh-huh.

238
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,716
Scott: Basically in Japan where everything crazy and entertaining comes from some guy has a deep fryer.

239
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,160
Scott: Oh, that's not the whole news.

240
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:16,000
Scott: Some guy has a deep fryer with a goldfish tank under it, and you know oil doesn't mix with water.

241
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:25,988
Scott: so you've got this aquarium and Directly on top of the water of the aquarium is the oil and then the oil goes all the way up to the top And you fry things in the oil.

242
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:31,337
Rym: it looks like it's water and goldfishes Heating element in the oil and oil on top of that.

243
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:36,860
Scott: yes So the oil is really hot I mean like it's a hundred and something degrees celsius.

244
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:42,580
Scott: So if the fish touch the oil they die, but wouldn't that heat be transferred to the water?

245
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,161
Scott: I don't.

246
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,387
Scott: can someone explain to me.

247
00:16:44,427 --> 00:16:48,887
Scott: How you can put oil on top of water heat the oil And then the water remains cool.

248
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,118
Scott: I don't get it unless you have some sort of cooling mechanism.

249
00:16:51,218 --> 00:17:00,256
Rym: well one He does rise it does as true But seriously to other was someone who did in fact explain it to you in detail.

250
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:05,981
Rym: the problem is you seem to be Explaining it in a crazy moon language otherwise known as Japanese Mmm.

251
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:11,500
Rym: That's two things of the day in a row where if we knew Japanese we would be more fulfilled by them.

252
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:13,772
Scott: I just went to the Japanese bookstore today.

253
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:14,819
Scott: Don't talk to me about that.

254
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:23,800
Rym: so Japanese bookstores Especially when they have manga are incredibly depressing to me because I have sanctuary and I have Eagle and I think that's a Japan.

255
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,734
Scott: I think that's depressing.

256
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:26,787
Scott: today I was looking for a Japanese novel.

257
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:28,051
Scott: you find a Japanese novel.

258
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:32,372
Scott: you look at the cover because the covers are all cool And he sees a little tiny book for like four dollars.

259
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:33,236
Scott: and the cover.

260
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:35,588
Scott: you look at that cover And you know there's something awesome inside.

261
00:17:35,628 --> 00:17:40,247
Scott: you open it, and it's basically a book of scribbles And you're like fuck.

262
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:41,373
Scott: It's a book of scribbles.

263
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:42,479
Scott: It does me no good.

264
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:54,700
Rym: Well, it's when you look in the manga section, and you think all right There's only like four or five Yakuza Action political yelling at each other awesome men standing at the front of tank columns while the nukes fall around the manga.

265
00:17:55,202 --> 00:17:57,852
Rym: No, there's like a million of them, and they're all a dollar.

266
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:59,940
Scott: I took a picture of the golf manga today.

267
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:01,527
Rym: There's a golf mom of course.

268
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:02,451
Scott: I took a picture of it.

269
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:03,776
Rym: Just to prove it of course.

270
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,640
Rym: There's a golf mom.

271
00:18:05,202 --> 00:18:07,492
Scott: Yes, it was everything that is published.

272
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:08,617
Scott: I figured it out by like.

273
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:13,553
Scott: It's like weekly comic big spirits or something like that.

274
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:15,460
Scott: That's the one that has the good stuff.

275
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,430
Scott: That's the one that Naoki or Asawa's manga gets put in.

276
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,240
Scott: you know the master Keaton's and the monsters in the 20th century boys.

277
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:22,439
Rym: What about going a guy?

278
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:30,800
Scott: Yeah, gonna guys cool, and I'll if you haven't had any of Actually, I'll put forth a controversial opinion.

279
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:36,775
Rym: I think that going a guy is only cool in a in an ironic and retroactive sense.

280
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:38,620
Rym: in most cases I agree.

281
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,812
Scott: Anyway, the aquarium with the oil on top of it.

282
00:18:42,852 --> 00:18:43,855
Scott: Yes, well that was.

283
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,260
Scott: the first question is obviously How does the oil not heat up the water?

284
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:53,820
Scott: Number two the goldfish are fed because the bits from the fried food fall down into the water and the fish eat it.

285
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:57,533
Scott: That's cool, but how did the fish not get obese from eating?

286
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:58,878
Scott: What is essentially fried?

287
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,306
Rym: I think the answer is pretty obvious.

288
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:02,933
Rym: which obviously they've made?

289
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:10,170
Rym: this contraption put water Goldfish oil in it set it up filmed a bunch of stuff Taking the oil out taking the goldfish out and been done with it.

290
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,354
Scott: that could be true.

291
00:19:11,374 --> 00:19:12,377
Rym: This is obviously not.

292
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:26,280
Rym: some guys Maybe someone's selling it though I don't think it's the modern Japanese equivalent of the platform shoes with the goldfish in them know also Uh Apparently, how did the goldfish get oxygen?

293
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,573
Rym: I mean they probably don't keep them in there that long.

294
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:29,640
Rym: either that or they die.

295
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:35,359
Scott: It says at least from what I read that the goldfish stay in there for like a few years and then they switch them out.

296
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:41,523
Scott: And the only time the goldfish die prematurely is if they are stupid enough to swim up and touch the oil in which case they Go.

297
00:19:41,645 --> 00:19:44,242
Rym: Oh, yeah, I Don't know.

298
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:49,220
Scott: I guess well, they probably only say Oh God once because goldfish can't remember anything that happened too long ago.

299
00:19:50,144 --> 00:19:51,472
Rym: I'm gonna call you on an assertion.

300
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:56,278
Rym: You've made during the course of your thing of the day Yeah, you've assumed that goldfish are theists.

301
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:08,100
Rym: maybe Anyway More important than goldfish more important than goofy more important than anime world order our zombies.

302
00:20:09,023 --> 00:20:10,090
Scott: Are we really gonna do it?

303
00:20:10,332 --> 00:20:11,360
Scott: I think we should back out.

304
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:11,982
Rym: I don't know.

305
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:14,289
Rym: I'm feeling whether maybe we should ask the audience.

306
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:14,771
Rym: audience.

307
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:15,814
Rym: Should we back out?

308
00:20:16,356 --> 00:20:16,977
Scott: Yes.

309
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:19,986
Scott: Yes Zombies suck boo.

310
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:21,913
Rym: Hi, I guess we're not doing zombies.

311
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,318
Scott: Oh, well, what are we gonna do then?

312
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:23,900
Scott: zombies?

313
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,809
Scott: Okay, so let's let's do it.

314
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,680
Rym: on what to do in the event of the horrible zombie apocalypse.

315
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:38,816
Rym: we talked about probably the most important thing of gathering intelligence because Zombie outbreaks can range from the worldwide.

316
00:20:38,896 --> 00:20:39,880
Rym: Hell is rising up.

317
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,266
Rym: There is no escape to die no matter what.

318
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:51,314
Rym: down to your roommate is walking around groaning talking about cerebral matter And in that case, he might be a zombie or he might just be high.

319
00:20:51,776 --> 00:20:52,680
Scott: It's tough to tell.

320
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:55,619
Scott: Yes, is there really a difference when you think about it?

321
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,623
Scott: So again

322
00:20:57,207 --> 00:21:13,840
Rym: when you're listening to this show Which is going to be on weapons to use fighting zombies Always bear in mind that pretty much every episode we do after this and everything we could possibly say all of our expert opinions all Rely on you knowing what kinds of zombies you're up against.

323
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:18,920
Rym: So make sure you have done your homework and your reconnaissance before you even attempt to chainsaw zombie.

324
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:23,260
Scott: Yes, and you know, you might just end up having to be unlucky.

325
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:30,000
Scott: I mean in any zombie apocalypse You might just be one of those first zombies who doesn't get a chance to figure anything out.

326
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:31,971
Scott: Just you're just walking down the hall at work.

327
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:33,620
Scott: You don't know this zombie apocalypse.

328
00:21:33,721 --> 00:21:34,485
Scott: You weren't expecting it.

329
00:21:34,505 --> 00:21:36,798
Scott: and then a zombie jumps out of the closet and is game over for you.

330
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:39,987
Scott: Well Sorry, it's just the way the cookie crumbles.

331
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:43,440
Rym: Yeah, who wants to be that guy that asshole that first zombie?

332
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:48,620
Scott: Granted what if it's usually the fault of some like voodoo shaman or something?

333
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:54,280
Rym: It is possible that being one of the early zombies will entitle you to having powers later on.

334
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,999
Rym: Maybe we become one of those zombie lords from the back of the second ed D&D handbook.

335
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:06,786
Scott: Well the monster book at least I don't know usually the zombie lord is usually a necromancer Not one of the zombies themselves.

336
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:14,920
Scott: being one of the early zombies is not always a great idea because then you know It's your job to spread the zombieism which kind of sucks.

337
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:21,764
Scott: You don't want to be a spreading zombie you want to be one of the distant off, you know on your own zombies Do you get a lot more people to eat.

338
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:29,431
Rym: if I'm gonna have to be undead I'd rather be either some form of lich Possibly a demilich death night for me skeleton.

339
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:29,732
Scott: Thank you.

340
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:40,640
Rym: granted though a ghost as I learned from the game we played way back with Alex is very nice because you can possess living bodies and Clawed some semblance of a normal life for short periods of time before your hosts go insane.

341
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,225
Scott: Skeleton is definitely the way to go.

342
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:44,211
Scott: I can't stress that enough.

343
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:45,454
Rym: I don't really like the skeleton.

344
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:51,809
Scott: take it out by a claw hammer readily Hence, you don't go near people with claw hammers.

345
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:55,040
Scott: Plus you ride down the street on motorcycles yelling in Spanish.

346
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:12,660
Rym: Anyway, we're talking about weapons here and we have to narrow it down a bit because weapons could range from full-blown siege engines Designed to prevent zombies from overrunning the last stronghold of humanity to nukes to the kitchen knife.

347
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:29,220
Rym: so I think we're gonna limit it to personal weapons things that one Individual or possibly two people at most would use in close to close or close to close hand-to-hand to short Maybe maybe medium range combat the thing you would carry during the zombie apocalypse.

348
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:30,670
Scott: I think we got to start.

349
00:23:30,973 --> 00:23:32,000
Scott: if we're gonna start it off, right?

350
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,489
Scott: We got to start for the obvious choice chainsaw.

351
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,111
Scott: No, no, no.

352
00:23:35,392 --> 00:23:40,975
Scott: the number one zombie weapon That is generally useful no matter your zombie apocalypse.

353
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:42,140
Scott: the shotgun.

354
00:23:42,802 --> 00:23:43,203
Rym: You see.

355
00:23:43,264 --> 00:23:51,320
Rym: the shotgun, especially if it's loaded with slugs unlike any other kind of gun You're probably going to have has readily available ammunition.

356
00:23:51,902 --> 00:23:53,306
Rym: It's so easy to use.

357
00:23:53,707 --> 00:23:57,720
Rym: I defy anyone who has at least one arm to fire a shotgun a few times.

358
00:23:58,182 --> 00:24:01,840
Scott: Yeah, it could be a super powerful shotgun in which case you might not be able to hold it straight.

359
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:10,960
Scott: But that doesn't matter because unlike a gun that shoots bullets the shotgun shoots shot Which is not just one piece of metal going very quickly.

360
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:18,379
Scott: It is a lot of small bits of metal that spread out and cover an area But all those bits of metal still go really fast.

361
00:24:19,003 --> 00:24:26,962
Scott: The reason this is essential against zombies because you have a zombie It's essentially a bag of flesh walking around if you poke a hole in it Really?

362
00:24:27,023 --> 00:24:28,913
Scott: It doesn't matter how fast you poke that hole.

363
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,240
Scott: It's not gonna make a difference.

364
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:40,746
Scott: You've got to knock the zombie down You've got to break a piece off of it and to do that you need to spread force over a wide area and the shotgun Is the only weapon.

365
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:45,060
Scott: where of that uses a gun type mechanism that will do such a thing.

366
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:47,389
Rym: Now the shotgun has a number of advantages.

367
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,674
Rym: I mean, it's very easy to use.

368
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:50,060
Rym: they're readily available.

369
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:51,286
Rym: Anyone can use them.

370
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:54,099
Scott: get them at Walmart by like the bag full there.

371
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,280
Rym: eat.

372
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,160
Rym: The problem is there's already zombies at Walmart and pretty much already fucked at that point.

373
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,380
Scott: But if you're in Walmart when the zombies come, you know where to go, but there's already zombies there.

374
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:04,186
Rym: There's always zombies there.

375
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:05,592
Scott: You get my point.

376
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:06,114
Rym: I do.

377
00:25:06,134 --> 00:25:07,559
Scott: That's why Walmart has shotgun.

378
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:11,696
Rym: But shotguns are very easy to aim if you miss a ton.

379
00:25:11,736 --> 00:25:12,640
Scott: It's really hard to miss.

380
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:15,720
Scott: It's like it's shotgun depending on your range.

381
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:18,388
Scott: It's sort of like hitting a beach ball with the tennis.

382
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:23,186
Rym: if you're in the same room as anything and you have a shotgun and that Thing is not destroyed in one shot.

383
00:25:23,246 --> 00:25:24,651
Scott: You fail as a human being.

384
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:28,950
Scott: I mean at least get the arm You're gonna at least hit the arm and blow it off.

385
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:35,575
Rym: Maybe now in terms of firing Shotguns even without slugs even with just their shot have incredible stopping power.

386
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:40,220
Rym: if you hit a zombie in the head Which isn't that hard to do you're probably gonna take the head out and that's the end of that zombie.

387
00:25:40,602 --> 00:25:44,840
Rym: Most likely you're hoping here that they're the zombies that go out when the brain is destroyed.

388
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,080
Scott: Yeah, I mean considering anything is possible.

389
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:51,600
Scott: It could be some sort of zombie where the head falls off and immediately grows a new body and the body grows a new head.

390
00:25:51,661 --> 00:25:52,779
Scott: You've just made two zombies

391
00:25:53,101 --> 00:26:08,280
Rym: But then again even most zombies even if destroying the head is not key the shotgun will do enough massive trauma in such a short Span that even if you did not destroy the zombie entirely it will not be bothering you for any Conceivable time and you will be able to get away.

392
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:20,278
Scott: The other advantage of the shotgun is that it does spread wide enough that if there are multiple Zombies coming at you you can sort of like, you know in the Jedi will do like a force push against some stormtroopers And they'll kind of fall back a bit.

393
00:26:20,741 --> 00:26:23,732
Scott: Firing a shotgun in a group of zombies is very similar.

394
00:26:24,013 --> 00:26:27,948
Scott: that whole group will be set aback You know if they get hit with any shot at all.

395
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:34,833
Rym: now the key to remember there is you've got to understand how to set The choke on your shotgun which probably won't be an issue depending what kind of shotgun you get.

396
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:37,976
Rym: you can easily widen the dispersal By just shortening the barrel.

397
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,931
Rym: Yep, now a hand cannon is a good backup.

398
00:26:40,991 --> 00:26:48,075
Rym: if you can get a hold of a shotgun and saw it down Especially a double barrel boy, just keep that in your belt and use that as the emergency.

399
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:49,820
Rym: the zombies have grappled me.

400
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,566
Rym: This is my last chance to get them off.

401
00:26:51,646 --> 00:26:53,272
Scott: Just don't shoot yourself in the genitals.

402
00:26:53,292 --> 00:27:00,600
Rym: I Think trying to avoid applying a weapon to your genitals will be a theme throughout zombie.

403
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:07,800
Scott: Now if you can they do make what are like really awesome shotguns.

404
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,859
Scott: I mean the shotgun you're gonna get at Walmart is gonna be pretty crappy relative to what technology we have today's.

405
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:13,642
Scott: you know It'll.

406
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:14,867
Scott: you'll put two shells in it.

407
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:15,690
Scott: You'll go.

408
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:16,975
Scott: You'll you know pump it.

409
00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:18,280
Scott: You'll fire the two shells.

410
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:19,307
Scott: You'll take the shells out.

411
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:19,911
Scott: you put two more.

412
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:20,435
Rym: a lot of hold.

413
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:20,978
Rym: more than two.

414
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:23,436
Scott: No some of them, but you can get shotguns.

415
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:28,556
Scott: these days You might have seen them in counter-strike the the noob cannon the other noob can.

416
00:27:28,596 --> 00:27:29,640
Scott: those things are real.

417
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,940
Scott: You can get those if you find a good gun store.

418
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:41,340
Scott: Or basically you load it up with like 12 or 16 or maybe 10 shells I don't know how many and literally it goes like boom boom boom boom boom boom and you just pull the trigger.

419
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,631
Scott: Maybe you'll have to pump.

420
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:43,599
Scott: it depends on the gun.

421
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:51,855
Scott: But you can fire a lot of shells real fast And then you can load them in by going click click click click click click click And you can get a lot of zombies out.

422
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:57,980
Scott: with one of those things You're basically invincible in a zombie attack if you have those as long as you don't run out of ammo.

423
00:27:58,461 --> 00:28:01,452
Rym: Yes, you got to be careful though because it's very easy to waste multiple shots.

424
00:28:01,532 --> 00:28:03,599
Scott: on one zombie it is you've got a very.

425
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:13,440
Scott: you Gotta conserve the ammo really well because the one advantage of bullets which aren't gonna really help you that much unless you have a really Powerful gun is that they're small so you can have a lot of bullets.

426
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,580
Scott: Shotgun shells are kind of big so you kind of keep them in boxes.

427
00:28:18,123 --> 00:28:20,780
Scott: You might like if you if you're in a truck or on a motorcycle.

428
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,011
Scott: It's you're better off because you can have more shells on you.

429
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:24,700
Scott: carrying around shotgun shells.

430
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,819
Scott: Maybe you have like a belt and two bandoliers with a bunch of shells in them, but they're gonna run out.

431
00:28:30,462 --> 00:28:33,860
Rym: Yes, shotgun is definitely a short-term to midterm weapon.

432
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:37,331
Rym: It's not an immediate term meaning what you would get immediately.

433
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:38,776
Rym: zombies come unless you have one.

434
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:40,664
Scott: if you've got one in your house Good for you.

435
00:28:41,006 --> 00:28:51,020
Rym: Yes, but even then the thing is the shotgun is Mostly to be used in order to get past zombies or to get through zombies or to get away from zombies.

436
00:28:51,141 --> 00:28:52,347
Scott: Yeah, like you're stuck in the mall.

437
00:28:52,568 --> 00:28:54,980
Scott: So you grab a shotgun you get out of the mall.

438
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:56,649
Scott: You don't need the shotgun anymore.

439
00:28:56,911 --> 00:28:58,480
Scott: You know now you got to use a different weapon.

440
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:05,368
Rym: Yes Now you don't want to use the shotgun to just generally take out zombies because while you can have a lot of ammo Ammo is limited.

441
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:14,393
Rym: you see if you're in your house Barricaded don't just stand there shooting all the zombies that try to get up the stairs, of course Hopefully you've destroyed your stairs, but that's beside the point.

442
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:14,835
Rym: That's from it.

443
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:15,800
Rym: That's for another night.

444
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:22,283
Rym: But say you didn't destroy the stairs and zombies are just shambling up your porch trying to get into your front door and eat your Brains.

445
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,519
Rym: don't just stand there shooting each one as they come up.

446
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:27,800
Rym: There are much better ways to handle the actual fighting of zombies.

447
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:31,874
Rym: The shotgun should be saved and used primarily for escape.

448
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:33,640
Rym: The shotgun is the last ditch.

449
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,518
Rym: The shotgun is the universal will always get you out of the situation.

450
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:37,820
Rym: weapon.

451
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:42,920
Scott: Well, I think that every weapon in a zombie situation is a situational type of thing.

452
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:49,360
Scott: There is no standard weapon that'll do it all, you know in every possible circumstance or anything like that.

453
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,560
Rym: Well, there is a weapon that in most cases no matter what is going on will always be useful.

454
00:29:54,721 --> 00:30:01,780
Scott: Yes, there are things they'll be useful but depending on your situation There's always one tool that does the job sort of like, you know, and you're a carpenter.

455
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,366
Scott: Sometimes the hammer is what you need.

456
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,835
Scott: Sometimes the screwdriver and the zombie apocalypse.

457
00:30:05,855 --> 00:30:07,300
Scott: This is a call for the fire axe.

458
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,349
Scott: This is a call for the Mack truck.

459
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,619
Scott: This is a call for the chainsaw.

460
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:15,992
Rym: So right alongside with the shotgun then which the shotgun is pretty much your best bet.

461
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:18,760
Rym: general purpose firearm long-range weapon.

462
00:30:19,322 --> 00:30:26,376
Rym: You're gonna need a melee weapon to go along with this not necessarily because melee weapons are better Don't believe the video games?

463
00:30:26,823 --> 00:30:27,980
Rym: Well, it's not in that respect.

464
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:33,992
Rym: but believe the video games in this other aspect that Use the shotgun when you need to use the Louisville slugger.

465
00:30:34,072 --> 00:30:37,906
Rym: when you can get away without using the shotgun to save ammo Well get a metal one.

466
00:30:38,187 --> 00:30:40,296
Scott: First of all Louisville slugger is made of wood.

467
00:30:40,476 --> 00:30:42,660
Scott: What's not so bad What's not so bad?

468
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:56,059
Scott: The thing is wood is kind of heavy and even if you are super strong You can swing a metal bat a lot faster and a lot harder than you can swing a wooden bet and it does more damage Especially if you hit in the important bits.

469
00:30:56,941 --> 00:31:01,900
Scott: So this if you can get a metal bat get one, but a wooden bat will work almost as well.

470
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,873
Rym: It basically just comes down to any large easy to wield blunt instrument.

471
00:31:05,953 --> 00:31:07,960
Scott: Yeah, crowbar can work pretty nicely.

472
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:12,439
Scott: A nice big hammer as long as it's not too unwieldy can work.

473
00:31:13,202 --> 00:31:15,951
Scott: What else is really good at bludgeoning a cricket bat?

474
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:18,880
Rym: I guess golf clubs depending on what they're made out of are okay.

475
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,713
Scott: Yeah, I gotta watch out for those like flimsy titanium and graphite type thing.

476
00:31:22,753 --> 00:31:26,326
Rym: Yeah, we learned that from suicide Kings You want like an iron.

477
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:32,126
Scott: old-school golf club probably like a putter is actually really good Especially if it's from like putting green.

478
00:31:32,346 --> 00:31:35,416
Rym: actually actually the problem is I have a really good putter.

479
00:31:35,537 --> 00:31:36,480
Rym: I've used it for years.

480
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:41,140
Rym: I had to find my love and it broke kind of on its own one day randomly.

481
00:31:41,961 --> 00:31:44,190
Rym: Yeah, so don't always trust the the putter.

482
00:31:44,371 --> 00:32:06,240
Rym: the putter won't save you in the nick of yeah but in general you'll always have the choice between melee weapon and Firearm and you should always when you can revert to the melee weapon simply because it'll save your ammo say you're walking outside And you encounter one zombie Especially if they're slow-moving or don't infect you with blood sprays kind of zombies.

483
00:32:06,582 --> 00:32:09,217
Rym: Just beat it over the head until it stops moving and keep going.

484
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:13,000
Rym: Yep, don't waste a shotgun shell if it's not coming right for you.

485
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:27,803
Scott: You're pretty much always gonna carry a melee weapon no matter what Because you never know when a zombie let's jump out from behind a tree and it's gonna be way too close and You're not gonna have enough time to pull out a gun and maybe load it maybe cock it maybe fire it Bludgeon.

486
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:34,772
Scott: you can just go whip BAM and whack it inside of the head and that'll give you the second you need to back Off and then approach it properly now before

487
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:44,160
Rym: we leave the shotgun the one thing I really want to tell you is that if you have a shotgun Anything like the ones that break into I don't want to go in technical gun terms.

488
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:52,620
Rym: I don't think many of you know much about them But you know those shotguns were Arnold Schwarzenegger and Terminator 2 reloaded it in that really cool way where you kind of flip it around.

489
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:53,223
Scott: I'm pretty.

490
00:32:53,886 --> 00:32:54,851
Scott: I'm not a hundred percent sure.

491
00:32:54,911 --> 00:32:56,760
Scott: I'm pretty called sure that's called a muzzle loader.

492
00:32:57,222 --> 00:33:02,764
Rym: Don't try to reload one of those shotguns the way Arnold Schwarzenegger Reloaded that shotgun.

493
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:06,454
Scott: well only gonna hurt yourself unless you happen to be a Terminator.

494
00:33:07,095 --> 00:33:08,900
Rym: even then you're gonna hurt yourself.

495
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:10,126
Scott: No, you're not yes.

496
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,271
Rym: You are if you're a Terminator.

497
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:11,974
Rym: You're a Terminator.

498
00:33:11,995 --> 00:33:13,843
Rym: You don't need to worry about zombies Just stand there.

499
00:33:13,863 --> 00:33:14,285
Rym: What are they gonna?

500
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,353
Rym: Do bite you ha ha ha ha.

501
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:18,060
Scott: I think enough zombie.

502
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,339
Scott: How many zombies do you think it would take to beat the Terminator if the Terminator didn't fight back?

503
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,100
Rym: I depends on which Terminator.

504
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:24,105
Rym: t800.

505
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,330
Rym: Normal zombies like human zombies all of them.

506
00:33:28,852 --> 00:33:31,540
Rym: There is no number of zombies that could destroy a Terminator.

507
00:33:32,004 --> 00:33:38,580
Scott: I think there would be so many Where the weight of them on top of the Terminator would be so great that it would just be squished and destroyed.

508
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:43,997
Rym: I don't think you can pile that many zombies up on earth before many of them started floating off into space.

509
00:33:44,378 --> 00:33:44,940
Scott: That's fine.

510
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:49,500
Scott: The gravity of the zombies themselves will keep the other zombies from flying.

511
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:49,962
Rym: No, cuz.

512
00:33:49,982 --> 00:33:55,140
Rym: then they'll pull themselves out into space and form this zombiball much like one of the bosses in Castlevania.

513
00:33:56,122 --> 00:34:00,940
Scott: You know what if you put that Terminator at the center of the zombiball the Terminator would be no more.

514
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:03,112
Rym: He'd probably be fine.

515
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:16,748
Rym: He wouldn't get out anyway to talk about a lot of Weapons because a lot of people think oh I'd use flamethrowers or I'd use Samurai swords or chainsaws always a big one.

516
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:18,273
Scott: I'm still laughing at some of all.

517
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,380
Rym: don't listen to the movies.

518
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:30,132
Rym: Chainsaws are almost always entirely ineffectual and for anyone who's never actually used a chainsaw You might wonder why so many people hurt themselves with chainsaws.

519
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:35,449
Rym: You might think it's real easy to hurt To not touch that bit on the end.

520
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:38,440
Scott: That's gonna cut you it considering its most of the chainsaws.

521
00:34:39,002 --> 00:34:39,864
Scott: It's the dangers.

522
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:43,260
Rym: the deal is whenever you touch a chainsaw to any object you're gonna cut.

523
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:47,060
Rym: There's a small chance that it's gonna jump away and try to cut your arm off.

524
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:50,489
Rym: It happens a lot the few tiny chainsaws.

525
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,860
Rym: I've tried to use in my life tried to kill me every time.

526
00:34:54,281 --> 00:35:01,480
Scott: This is why chainsawing big trees is a sport that you can watch on ESPN - it's also a fairly high-paying job.

527
00:35:02,245 --> 00:35:04,220
Scott: Yep, it's also a dangerous job.

528
00:35:05,081 --> 00:35:06,847
Rym: Never ever ever use a chainsaw.

529
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:08,313
Rym: It's just gonna run out of gas.

530
00:35:08,594 --> 00:35:09,537
Rym: It's ineffective.

531
00:35:09,778 --> 00:35:10,260
Rym: It's slow.

532
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:14,496
Scott: You're gonna hurt yourself, and if it's not gonna run out of gas that means it plugs into the wall.

533
00:35:14,576 --> 00:35:15,540
Scott: How useful is that?

534
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:28,679
Scott: The only real use you have for a chainsaw is you cutting through the bodies of the fallen that and you can also use Chainsaws as traps as long as you don't fall in as long as you're not so dumb that you fall into your own trap.

535
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:46,336
Scott: a Chainsaw trap can be quite effective because if you keep fueling that chainsaw Or if it's one that plugs into the wall and keep in his power from the power plant or a generator somewhere you can have a chainsaw running and Trick a lot of zombies and just falling out into it, and you just basically make a zombie grinder.

536
00:35:46,537 --> 00:35:50,599
Scott: that works really well But you don't want to carry a chainsaw around with you.

537
00:35:51,021 --> 00:35:59,920
Rym: You don't want to make a chainsaw type on a stick or anything like that because anyone who saw the remake of dawn of the Dead knows why you don't want to mount chainsaws to vehicles.

538
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:04,119
Scott: Yeah, you're only gonna hurt yourself as much as you hurt the zombies.

539
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:06,507
Scott: remember It doesn't matter how many zombies you hurt.

540
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:08,673
Scott: you hurt yourself once and it's game over.

541
00:36:08,954 --> 00:36:10,760
Scott: you got to hurt yourself zero times.

542
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:16,835
Rym: Now if they're the kind of zombies where any significant trauma to the brain will take them out.

543
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:26,420
Rym: while shotguns are nice Nice handguns assault rifles rifles anything like that solid gold if one blow to the head will take the zombie out.

544
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:29,260
Rym: Get as many small arms as you can and use them to great effect.

545
00:36:29,426 --> 00:36:29,639
Rym: Yes

546
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:55,994
Scott: Assuming zombies are undead flesh as I already said bullets don't really help because they go in one side not the other and the zombie Doesn't know any different, but if you can somehow kill the zombie by getting it in the head then a nice Well calibrated rifle of some sort is very useful because if a zombies far away Or maybe a little bit longer range You can shoot a bullet through its head before it gets anywhere near close enough to do any damage at all And it'll fall over and never bother you again

547
00:36:56,437 --> 00:37:10,380
Rym: like say You know you're in a building and you've got to break through and escape from the building and there's a ring of zombies around it ahead before you break out Have people with rifles stand there and pick off a bunch of zombies in one area and then attack that area right away.

548
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:17,932
Scott: Yeah now if they're kind of zombies that you might need to bash their whole head apart a Normal rifle is not going to do the trick.

549
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,140
Scott: you need something more powerful.

550
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:25,278
Scott: But there do exist many more powerful rifles, and you know they don't necessarily have to get the AWP.

551
00:37:26,422 --> 00:37:41,960
Scott: You can get a lot of other things that are almost as good or good enough where they shoot a bullet But they shoot the bullet so fast and so hard and the bullet is such a high caliber That if you hit the zombie in the head or even in the arm that entire like limb will explode.

552
00:37:42,622 --> 00:37:46,820
Scott: Like there are bullets that you could shoot out of guns and hit people in the head and their head will just explode.

553
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:56,939
Rym: Granted there's a big problem with handguns in general in that the vast majority of human beings do not have the ability to fire them Accurately, this is why I've been talking about rifles.

554
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,649
Rym: Well, I was thinking about you're talking about that kind of weapon.

555
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:03,900
Rym: the Desert Eagle 5-0 would almost definitely take out a zombie head.

556
00:38:04,061 --> 00:38:06,417
Scott: Oh almost certainly, but don't try to wield it.

557
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,529
Scott: if you do not It's sort of like a weapon in D&D.

558
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:10,399
Scott: you need to be level 5 to use this.

559
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:13,060
Rym: So what do you need to be a level 5?

560
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,686
Rym: Bullet-toothed Tony I guess.

561
00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:20,426
Scott: if you're good enough to have a Desert Eagle and you can aim it and get a zombie in the head And then good for you.

562
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:24,480
Scott: You just you have the ability to do a lot better than most people in a zombie situation.

563
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,379
Scott: But if you are not capable of handling a weapon such as the Desert Eagle Don't try it cuz again.

564
00:38:30,761 --> 00:38:32,987
Scott: You'll just hurt yourself probably break your wrist.

565
00:38:33,288 --> 00:38:33,409
Rym: now.

566
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:39,106
Rym: another weapon a lot of people really like is the flamethrower and the flamethrower Is not a general-purpose weapon.

567
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:46,740
Rym: soldiers in World War one learned that one if use a flamethrower Most likely it's going to set you on fire before it sets anyone else on fire.

568
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:54,700
Scott: Yeah, if I've learned anything from playing that return to Castle Wolfenstein game is that flamethrower is the coolest weapon to kill yourself.

569
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:02,355
Rym: But I remember when I made a flamethrower in Doom 2 and I learned that all it did was spawn more flame and then immediately kill me.

570
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:09,680
Rym: Yeah, but yes flamethrowers are useful really only if you're on the offensive as opposed to the defensive.

571
00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:23,249
Scott: Sometimes they're useful for clearing out different situations Like if there is a wooden structure full of zombies that is being on the offensive I guess or perhaps if there are a bunch of dead zombies in the way You can set the pile of corpses on fire.

572
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:25,640
Rym: It doesn't making it harder to crawl over the pile?

573
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:32,399
Scott: Well, no like maybe behind you or and you're going the other way or to clear it out eventually Like there's no zombies right now.

574
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,879
Rym: But you can do that with non flamethrowers and having the flamethrower slows you down so much.

575
00:39:37,482 --> 00:39:45,368
Scott: I think the biggest problem of the flamethrower assuming you're not stupid enough to set yourself on fire with it assuming you know how to use it properly is that you're

576
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:45,769
Rym: carrying

577
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:49,459
Scott: around this tank of highly flammable gas or liquid and

578
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:51,645
Rym: That provides

579
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,679
Scott: a very very weak spot for you.

580
00:39:55,182 --> 00:40:03,153
Scott: You know in any video game you ever play anyone who's carrying around a flamethrower You know that you just shoot them anywhere near that tank and it explodes and they die.

581
00:40:03,554 --> 00:40:12,380
Scott: if a zombie grabs that tank Or maybe one of your friends shoots a spark near it by accident You're going to explode and that is not good.

582
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:17,599
Scott: That tank is much more useful as a zombie killing bomb than as a weak spot on your back.

583
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:20,308
Rym: Also because it's heavy you're not gonna move very fast.

584
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:21,772
Rym: So once again, I stand by my.

585
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:23,939
Rym: it is primarily an offensive weapon.

586
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,920
Rym: Yeah, the situations where you'll use a flamethrower assuming that somehow you get a hold of a flamethrower little homemade ones are pretty much dick.

587
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:35,720
Scott: Yeah, it's full if there's aliens for instead of zombies depending on the alien.

588
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,646
Rym: What if the aliens are actually fire element?

589
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:41,096
Scott: talking about the horny wiener aliens so horny Weaver.

590
00:40:41,658 --> 00:40:42,280
Scott: That's an old.

591
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,543
Scott: It's a horny wiener.

592
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:44,125
Scott: It's an old joke.

593
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:45,428
Rym: You mean Sigourney Weaver.

594
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:48,216
Rym: Yes, not so horny wiener.

595
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:49,620
Scott: It's a middle school joke.

596
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:50,114
Scott: Leave me alone.

597
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,460
Rym: outstanding.

598
00:40:52,881 --> 00:40:54,688
Scott: Maybe maybe it's time to dump that joke.

599
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:55,733
Scott: I didn't even it was.

600
00:40:55,793 --> 00:40:57,580
Scott: so it's such an old ingrained joke.

601
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:58,863
Scott: Think when I said it.

602
00:40:59,345 --> 00:41:00,889
Scott: yes, it's just the natural saying.

603
00:41:01,029 --> 00:41:05,260
Rym: anyway just remember flamethrowers are not really useful to defend yourself.

604
00:41:05,481 --> 00:41:13,161
Rym: They're useful for cleanup for the extermination of the remaining zombies for the cleaning out of buildings for the storming of areas that sort Of thing.

605
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:16,819
Scott: I know there is one weapon that most people don't think of.

606
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:23,649
Scott: that I think is perhaps the number one weapon in any modern Western civilized zombie situation.

607
00:41:23,669 --> 00:41:26,380
Scott: and that weapon is any motor vehicle?

608
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:32,660
Rym: Yes, preferably some sort of Jeep if possible something with some horsepower.

609
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:34,609
Scott: But mostly you want is torque.

610
00:41:34,991 --> 00:41:36,900
Scott: you want it to be high off the ground.

611
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:45,345
Scott: you want good wheels that can drive off-road and you want something that can take a lot of damage to the front and Hopefully also the rear.

612
00:41:45,686 --> 00:41:49,620
Rym: Yes, so very specifically don't go grabbing Lamborghinis and Porsches.

613
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:52,040
Rym: Those are pretty much gonna get gummed up on the first zombie.

614
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:57,680
Scott: But the Lamborghini the Porsche might be useful in a very specific situation of empty highway.

615
00:41:58,222 --> 00:42:00,912
Scott: You got to get the hell out of this town something like that.

616
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:03,240
Scott: But other than that, it's just gonna get you killed.

617
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,584
Scott: Yes, you're looking for.

618
00:42:04,604 --> 00:42:07,313
Scott: you know Ford f350s.

619
00:42:07,393 --> 00:42:09,560
Scott: You're looking for Dodge rams.

620
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:10,947
Scott: You're looking for jeeps.

621
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,320
Scott: You're looking for land rovers.

622
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:16,912
Scott: You're looking for SUVs that are actually trucks and not cars.

623
00:42:17,013 --> 00:42:24,880
Rym: if you need to get through a bunch of zombies You can sit there and go bit by bit with the flamethrower or you could fight your way out with baseball bats and shotguns.

624
00:42:25,363 --> 00:42:28,099
Rym: But if you've got a good truck just get in it.

625
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:30,468
Rym: Maybe put some sort of thing on front of it.

626
00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:34,000
Rym: if you can get a plow or a bulldozer thing to put on the front.

627
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,239
Rym: That's even better some sort of cowcatcher kind of thing.

628
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,950
Rym: Yeah One of those and just charge through the zombies and get away.

629
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,276
Scott: their motor vehicles aren't just cars either.

630
00:42:42,297 --> 00:42:45,347
Scott: a train is awesome Even though it only goes one way.

631
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,494
Rym: trains I would submit are not that awesome as

632
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:48,418
Scott: long as those zombies

633
00:42:48,598 --> 00:42:59,708
Rym: on the train If you don't know the situation along the train route to not get on a train because you might just take yourself into a tunnel and die or take yourself into Zombie territory with no way back out.

634
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,360
Rym: if there's anything blocking the train now, you're fucked.

635
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:07,100
Scott: Well, the thing is if you're on a train you can just you could detach all the cars except the engine.

636
00:43:07,423 --> 00:43:10,420
Scott: So you're in the engine you go really fast No zombies.

637
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:19,204
Scott: If there's no zombie in the engine with you You're okay And you can go and go and go and go and no zombies gonna get you unless you stop and open the door or anything Like that.

638
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:28,479
Scott: and if you end up in a bad place You know You can see it way ahead of you and if it doesn't look like you know If the track is out or something like that Just turn the train around and go back.

639
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:32,880
Scott: But a train just might be the thing to get you out of there without getting killed.

640
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,899
Rym: So remember it's hard to drive a train.

641
00:43:35,141 --> 00:43:40,775
Rym: You might think it's easy, but the first corner if you don't know how fast it can go around the corner You're just gonna derail and die.

642
00:43:40,997 --> 00:43:49,731
Scott: Yes That's why you should make sure to get the engineer and hope he didn't turn into a zombie or learn how to use a train Which I maybe I should learn how to use a train if I always wanted to know.

643
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:53,927
Rym: now when you're using weapons to get zombies Remember that zombie intelligence.

644
00:43:54,189 --> 00:43:55,012
Rym: This is key again.

645
00:43:55,414 --> 00:44:00,351
Rym: You've got to be careful of Infection depending on what kind of zombies they are.

646
00:44:00,813 --> 00:44:08,165
Rym: if they're normal Zombies that just kill you and maybe dead bodies come back to life and they can bite you and do whatever and you won't turn Into one.

647
00:44:08,185 --> 00:44:08,976
Rym: then don't worry about it.

648
00:44:09,341 --> 00:44:13,520
Rym: But if they're 28 days later zombies wear a speck of blood in your eye and suddenly you go crazy.

649
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:20,560
Rym: You best be wearing some armor when you're fighting and you best be using blunt trauma weapons as opposed to piercing stabbing weapons.

650
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:26,295
Scott: Yes Also, if you can find a hospital maybe even like those biohazard hazmat type suits.

651
00:44:26,736 --> 00:44:28,999
Scott: that way even if blood splatters You're okay.

652
00:44:29,141 --> 00:44:31,279
Scott: However in a duct tape is also good.

653
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:33,968
Rym: Clothing leather is key.

654
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:35,895
Rym: Wear as much leather as you can.

655
00:44:35,915 --> 00:44:37,400
Rym: duct tape the things together.

656
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,613
Rym: So there's no way loves a mask of some sort.

657
00:44:40,673 --> 00:44:42,259
Scott: Maybe a paintball mask could be good.

658
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:49,199
Rym: Yeah, if anything you want to protect your eyes You don't want to zombie blood in your eyes, especially if you haven't figured out how contagious the zombie whatever is.

659
00:44:49,761 --> 00:44:52,070
Scott: Yeah as much protection and armor as you can.

660
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,660
Scott: but armor is not weapons, which is what we're talking about here.

661
00:44:55,161 --> 00:44:57,689
Rym: So, how do you fight a zombie in one-on-one combat?

662
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,480
Rym: very simply again say let's say you don't know anything about it.

663
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,239
Rym: You're fighting the zombie.

664
00:45:02,601 --> 00:45:10,404
Rym: You're standing here in our room right now doing the show the GeekNights studio and a zombie busting the door and goes I'm a zombie.

665
00:45:10,886 --> 00:45:11,950
Scott: I'm a zombie.

666
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:13,054
Scott: How's fast is he going?

667
00:45:13,235 --> 00:45:14,700
Scott: Is he a slow zombie or fast zombie?

668
00:45:15,081 --> 00:45:15,968
Scott: He's a fast zombie.

669
00:45:15,988 --> 00:45:17,460
Scott: We're fucked cuz we don't have weapons right now.

670
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:26,079
Rym: I might be able to push this keyboard into him while he's going after you enough to keep him away from me Long enough to grab something heavy and hit him like this mug.

671
00:45:26,321 --> 00:45:30,940
Scott: I could maybe use this microphone stand as sort of a swinging bludgeon and then escape out the door.

672
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,788
Rym: I don't know if he was a 28 days later zombie.

673
00:45:32,828 --> 00:45:33,109
Rym: Let's see.

674
00:45:33,129 --> 00:45:35,017
Rym: He appears he's already eating your face.

675
00:45:35,218 --> 00:45:35,620
Rym: I'm fucked.

676
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:36,750
Rym: I'm trying to jump out the window.

677
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:37,920
Scott: Yeah, it's game over.

678
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,650
Scott: But if he's a slow zombie, right I can back up.

679
00:45:41,051 --> 00:45:41,774
Scott: I can get it a little.

680
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:43,540
Scott: I can get a second to grab something.

681
00:45:43,581 --> 00:45:43,804
Scott: Let's see.

682
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:44,718
Scott: What could I grab here?

683
00:45:45,981 --> 00:45:49,355
Rym: I'd pretty much have to grab my dragon mug or maybe the GeekNights' compressor.

684
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,580
Scott: There's a tennis racket there.

685
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,325
Scott: That could be useful.

686
00:45:51,345 --> 00:45:52,655
Rym: Oh, I got a pair of scissors here.

687
00:45:52,675 --> 00:45:58,460
Scott: Mmm I might just use this microphone stand or actually the microphone itself is really heavy and it's on this cable.

688
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,971
Scott: I could swing it around pretty good.

689
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,019
Scott: That might do it.

690
00:46:01,321 --> 00:46:05,217
Rym: We'd pretty much have to throw debris at the zombie in order to get him contained now.

691
00:46:05,237 --> 00:46:05,740
Rym: This is key.

692
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,120
Rym: This is the first time you don't have any intelligence.

693
00:46:08,222 --> 00:46:10,513
Rym: We don't know what's going on other than that there is a zombie.

694
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:19,960
Rym: if We are able to subdue the zombie or in any way prevent it from leaving and also at the same time preventing it from getting To us then it's a good time to perform an experiment.

695
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,770
Rym: Try stab it through the eye and see if that kills it.

696
00:46:23,051 --> 00:46:25,700
Rym: then destroy the head and see if that kills it destroy the heart.

697
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,604
Rym: See if that kills it.

698
00:46:26,945 --> 00:46:30,320
Rym: figure out what it takes to destroy the zombie and then act accordingly.

699
00:46:30,882 --> 00:46:35,035
Scott: Make sure Rym does all these experiments and figure out how Rym gets infected by the zombie.

700
00:46:35,236 --> 00:46:36,520
Scott: then kill Rym in the same way.

701
00:46:36,621 --> 00:46:38,520
Scott: He killed the first zombie and then escape.

702
00:46:38,972 --> 00:46:46,587
Rym: Of course Your first priority is to make sure the zombie doesn't get you and your second priority is to make sure that Rym is the guinea Pig and not Scott before you do any experimentation.

703
00:46:46,687 --> 00:46:55,937
Rym: if zombie comes into the studio and we take it out before we do anything One listen and see if there's any other noise in the house because how the fuck did a zombie get in?

704
00:46:55,957 --> 00:47:00,920
Rym: the doors are locked To look out the window and see if there are zombies outside.

705
00:47:01,502 --> 00:47:05,437
Scott: Three look on the internet and see if someone else already figured it out.

706
00:47:05,919 --> 00:47:11,360
Rym: God I can just see Farky be like zombies invade something about Drew and beer and boobies.

707
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:17,580
Scott: There is the chance that that was the only zombie ever and now we're gonna be instant billionaires because we have the world's only zombie.

708
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:20,898
Rym: Yeah, except alright, so we kill the zombie again.

709
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:22,771
Rym: now It's dead that we call the police.

710
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:23,858
Rym: the police come and look at it.

711
00:47:24,422 --> 00:47:26,974
Rym: So, uh, this hobo broke into your house and killed him.

712
00:47:27,216 --> 00:47:28,080
Scott: no, it was a zombie.

713
00:47:28,702 --> 00:47:33,219
Rym: It looks like you just stabbed this guy in the face like ten times then took his heart out and crushed it.

714
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:35,967
Rym: We swear he was a zombie.

715
00:47:36,188 --> 00:47:37,713
Rym: We stabbed him in the neck and he didn't die.

716
00:47:38,115 --> 00:47:40,765
Scott: Yeah, sure boys Police are all zombies.

717
00:47:40,826 --> 00:47:42,934
Scott: Anyway back to the weapons that we were talking.

718
00:47:43,035 --> 00:47:47,174
Scott: send more paramedics.

719
00:47:47,379 --> 00:47:51,516
Scott: I Guess the best weapons would always be military weapons, but you're really not gonna get those.

720
00:47:51,757 --> 00:47:52,440
Rym: Well, it depends.

721
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:56,300
Rym: I mean, maybe you live near a military base and you get on to the military base by fruit.

722
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,088
Rym: You're not a zombie.

723
00:47:57,391 --> 00:48:02,719
Rym: the military base If the zombie apocalypse is great enough is probably going to arm any human who is in there.

724
00:48:03,263 --> 00:48:05,260
Scott: Maybe you're knowing our military.

725
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,291
Scott: They just keep you in some sort of shitty ass shelter while they fuck up things.

726
00:48:09,432 --> 00:48:12,340
Rym: not to use as weapons is very key.

727
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:16,880
Rym: Do not attempt to stab the zombie with a pocket knife.

728
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:18,085
Scott: No, pretty much.

729
00:48:18,206 --> 00:48:28,300
Rym: if you're gonna use a knife, you're gonna want machete or better Yeah, if you're using a pair of scissors or some little knife That's pretty much the last resort because the zombies already biting your neck and you're trying to stab it in the eye.

730
00:48:28,528 --> 00:48:38,770
Scott: Yeah I mean Machete is actually a really good general-purpose weapon because it cuts a lot of other things that might get in your way Like, you know fall in wires that aren't electrified.

731
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:42,580
Rym: if you like goal if you like D&D stuff or SCA stuff.

732
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:55,980
Rym: And you've got a bunch of pseudo medieval weapons laying around Unless you got them from a reputable sword dealer like museum replicas and you know that they're full-tang and good and Actually designed for at least some form of combat or stage combat.

733
00:48:56,422 --> 00:48:57,306
Rym: Don't use them.

734
00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:05,080
Rym: that sword from the Lord of the Rings might look really cool But it's either gonna break bend or somehow hurt you the moment you try to actually use it.

735
00:49:05,481 --> 00:49:08,690
Scott: Yeah, your replica of the master sword is not a weapon.

736
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,314
Scott: You might as well use a stick.

737
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:12,240
Scott: I mean, it's not.

738
00:49:12,521 --> 00:49:15,279
Scott: You're better off using the kitchen knife actually than that that thing.

739
00:49:16,642 --> 00:49:18,214
Rym: BB guns anything like that.

740
00:49:18,274 --> 00:49:18,960
Rym: Don't worry about it.

741
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:24,083
Scott: I can lately useless except maybe as a bludgeon if they're nice and heavy and made of metal Obviously aren't.

742
00:49:24,224 --> 00:49:29,160
Rym: pepper spray and the like in 99% of zombie cases are not gonna do anything.

743
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:37,240
Scott: No, maybe if you had a super soaker, maybe you could get some sort of acid or something in there Maybe holy water maybe these are mystical zombies.

744
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:37,922
Scott: It could be.

745
00:49:37,962 --> 00:49:43,620
Scott: it could be that a super soaker of holy water is the best option in some other universe besides this one.

746
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:52,139
Rym: Yes, however, if zombies come and they're not scientific zombies, or there's something we can't explain right away There's the tiny chance that there's other things.

747
00:49:52,521 --> 00:49:56,640
Rym: So if you have the opportunity throw a bunch of holy symbols Adam and see if anything happens.

748
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:05,324
Scott: Yeah, you know keep like a crescent moon a juice star and a cross around just in case the yellow sign just All the elders sign.

749
00:50:05,405 --> 00:50:07,813
Scott: also, you know, yeah just keep just keep a little.

750
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:18,291
Scott: we should sell that like a bag of holy symbols Just in case as every holy symbol like every religion and if a zombie ever happens You just throw this bag at it and then see what I see which one.

751
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:21,520
Rym: and of course if zombies come real quick.

752
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:30,620
Rym: If you ever had a memory from your childhood Where you thought you could cast a spell or a dream where someone said weird words to you try saying all those words just in case.

753
00:50:32,142 --> 00:50:42,880
Rym: Yeah, can't hurt now you say those words while you're using your shotgun, yeah, yeah, don't don't say oh price I'll save me from the sound because he's probably not gonna unless he's standing there next to you with a shotgun.

754
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,187
Scott: Hey, what's up, man?

755
00:50:46,247 --> 00:50:47,794
Scott: How's it going?

756
00:50:47,814 --> 00:50:49,039
Rym: laying down in blue sparks?

757
00:50:51,947 --> 00:50:53,040
Rym: All right, I think we're done.

758
00:50:53,521 --> 00:50:53,822
Rym: We couldn't.

759
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:59,100
Rym: there wasn't so much detail to talk about since we avoided all the artillery or bombs or traps or any of that.

760
00:50:59,702 --> 00:51:02,431
Rym: And the things you used to fight zombies are actually relatively simple.

761
00:51:02,451 --> 00:51:03,594
Scott: I think that's cuz.

762
00:51:03,614 --> 00:51:05,360
Scott: zombies are relatively simple enemies.

763
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:12,358
Scott: they're not complex enemies such as vampires where your weapons are like steaks and things or skeletons where only bludgeons will work.

764
00:51:12,378 --> 00:51:24,320
Scott: or You know some sort of golems where you need all sorts of weird weapons to beat a golem because they're immune to just about Everything, you know a zombie it's a walking bag of flesh and you just need to beat the shit out of it.

765
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:39,466
Rym: Yep, you're pretty much in all zombie situations want some form of melee weapon preferably a bludgeoning one as opposed to a piercing or stabbing Or slashing one, of course the one that cuts really well like something really sharp like maybe a good scimitar a real Cut the leg.

766
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:42,119
Scott: Yeah, you get the legs off a zombie and then what's it gonna do?

767
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:50,309
Rym: Theoretically with a real Katana or a real two-handed crazy awesome great sword kind of deal You could probably behead some zombies.

768
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,500
Scott: if you're outside you can actually get room.

769
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,016
Scott: You can swing a claymore around that'll do the trick or a mall.

770
00:51:56,077 --> 00:51:56,780
Rym: I like malls.

771
00:51:57,094 --> 00:52:03,840
Scott: Yeah the thing is you want to avoid things like Flails unless you have specific trained skills because you're only gonna hurt yourself with that.

772
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:13,700
Rym: Yeah, unless you know how to use nunchucks and when I say know how to use nunchucks I mean someone cooler than you taught you how to use nunchucks and he himself has used them before.

773
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,210
Rym: Don't ever ever try to use a nunchuck.

774
00:52:17,411 --> 00:52:21,170
Rym: I've owned nunchucks at several junctures in my young life Yourself in the nuts.

775
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:22,098
Scott: with them didn't you get out?

776
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:26,471
Rym: I proceeded to hit myself in the nuts until I threw them away.

777
00:52:26,491 --> 00:52:29,000
Scott: Yeah, and we're not talking about your wiimote nunchuck.

778
00:52:30,502 --> 00:52:32,835
Scott: Yeah, most ninja weapons kind of suck when it comes to.

779
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,323
Rym: yeah ninja stars Those are gonna.

780
00:52:34,343 --> 00:52:35,550
Scott: stars aren't gonna do it.

781
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,099
Scott: little daggers aren't gonna do it.

782
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:38,482
Scott: You know.

783
00:52:38,502 --> 00:52:41,513
Scott: those rings that are blades aren't gonna do it unless you can.

784
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,903
Scott: you know a hat with a knife in poison is not Gonna do it.

785
00:52:44,104 --> 00:52:46,316
Scott: no shoes with knives in them not gonna work.

786
00:52:46,637 --> 00:52:49,960
Rym: in general You want your melee weapon and your shotgun?

787
00:52:50,500 --> 00:53:00,268
Rym: You want to have some shells and some slugs if you can get a hold of them to get as much ammo as you can and a vehicle and Beyond that depending on the kinds of zombies.

788
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:03,740
Rym: assault rifles and that sort of thing might be very very useful.

789
00:53:04,102 --> 00:53:06,257
Rym: But again, it depends on what kind of zombies they are.

790
00:53:06,418 --> 00:53:10,859
Scott: Yeah I mean if you have an ak-47, there's a bunch of people coming at you and you just let loose.

791
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,873
Scott: Odds are if it's a mob of people you're gonna kill quite a few people.

792
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:18,071
Scott: if it's a mob of zombies Depending on the zombie.

793
00:53:18,091 --> 00:53:19,159
Scott: I might not do anything.

794
00:53:20,321 --> 00:53:21,968
Rym: Yes, and of course be smart.

795
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:29,060
Rym: don't kill zombies unless one It's safe to do so and you won't expend under resources doing it or two.

796
00:53:29,401 --> 00:53:35,518
Rym: You have to to either get where you're going or get away from where you are Yes, or to save another living human being.

797
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,140
Scott: yes Your goal is always to get away to get somewhere to escape somehow.

798
00:53:40,602 --> 00:53:43,740
Scott: You know this isn't a game of kill the most zombies and win.

799
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:47,055
Scott: It's a game of you get to get to the chopper.

800
00:53:47,075 --> 00:53:51,028
Scott: Yeah Don't kill more zombies than you have to.

801
00:53:51,168 --> 00:54:00,282
Scott: if you can get to the chopper without wasting time or ammo killing any Then do that so like in doom if you can get to the door at the end of the level in doom You know.

802
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:05,338
Scott: grab the keys open all the right doors push the red button and then levels over without having to kill any imps.

803
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:08,700
Scott: Do that because then you just saved yourself ten rockets.

804
00:54:09,202 --> 00:54:23,970
Rym: However, if you're in say a hospital and it's reasonably secured and you know There are other people in the hospital and you see a zombie You should probably go out of your way to kill it or at least alert everyone to its presence for the safety of all Because you don't know what kind of apocalypse this might be.

805
00:54:23,991 --> 00:54:28,467
Rym: it might be limited number of zombies Don't worry about it, but it might be.

806
00:54:28,988 --> 00:54:32,520
Rym: every single living human counts and is required.

807
00:54:33,683 --> 00:54:37,610
Rym: I mean if there's a limited number of humans left You don't want to let anyone die.

808
00:54:37,872 --> 00:54:42,959
Rym: if you see people under attack You might be worth it to go out of your way and save them unless you know, you can't.

809
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:44,586
Scott: yeah It mostly depends on the people.

810
00:54:44,606 --> 00:54:54,855
Scott: I mean if you see, you know old people It's not it's sad But you really probably don't need to save the old people unless they're old people with mad skills.

811
00:54:54,915 --> 00:54:56,480
Rym: or maybe maybe they remember things.

812
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,435
Rym: Maybe it's a World War two veteran who can teach you all about tactics.

813
00:54:59,616 --> 00:55:01,366
Scott: Oh, that is true There are uses.

814
00:55:01,406 --> 00:55:03,540
Rym: but yeah, don't just discount an old person out of hand.

815
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:10,529
Rym: But if you're running away with your small army of men and there's a horde of zombies Closing in on the one old lady.

816
00:55:10,569 --> 00:55:11,353
Rym: You can't keep up.

817
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:12,659
Rym: I hate to say it.

818
00:55:12,941 --> 00:55:16,916
Rym: You're gonna have to perform some sort of moral triage and let her go.

819
00:55:16,936 --> 00:55:22,680
Scott: Yeah I mean plus if you got kids coming around kids are tough because you know.

820
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,812
Scott: Well old people in the end are just gonna.

821
00:55:25,852 --> 00:55:27,700
Rym: but all anime tells you kids are the future.

822
00:55:27,941 --> 00:55:29,509
Scott: They are the kids are the future.

823
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:31,680
Scott: The problem is the kids are also baggage.

824
00:55:32,143 --> 00:55:38,392
Scott: They make you good they slow you down They don't help you out at all in the short term and it just kept.

825
00:55:38,472 --> 00:55:40,940
Scott: picking up one kid might get you all killed.

826
00:55:41,482 --> 00:55:47,282
Rym: So but at the same time if the number of humans is limited picking up one kid might be the most important thing you've ever Done.

827
00:55:47,403 --> 00:55:49,615
Scott: it might be see now that you got to think fast.

828
00:55:49,716 --> 00:55:50,480
Rym: We can't get into that.

829
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,313
Rym: That's a whole separate zombie episode.

830
00:55:52,353 --> 00:55:57,860
Rym: the moral triage And also medical triage and all that sort of thing.

831
00:55:58,263 --> 00:56:09,953
Rym: But one last thing I want to bring up with these weapons especially if they're zombies that can be taken out from a distance with headshots and two if They're the kind of zombies where if you were killed by a zombie you become a zombie.

832
00:56:10,435 --> 00:56:20,072
Rym: in that case if you let the old Lady go you're pretty much unless you have no way to an asshole If you don't at least turn around and give her the mercy kill.

833
00:56:20,534 --> 00:56:25,260
Scott: Yeah, you're pretty much saying Oh, yeah, we're just gonna let you become as I plus it's better.

834
00:56:25,542 --> 00:56:28,720
Scott: It's easy to kill an old lady a lot easier than is to kill a zombie I assume.

835
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,926
Scott: So if you're gonna leave the old lady behind It's good to mercy.

836
00:56:32,966 --> 00:56:39,478
Scott: kill the old lady because not only is it better for her not having to become a horrible zombie It's better for you one less zombie to deal with.

837
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:42,669
Scott: Alright, so you freaking fanboys.

838
00:56:42,749 --> 00:56:43,593
Scott: We did it.

839
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,094
Scott: We did it.

840
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:45,580
Rym: you ask for it constantly.

841
00:56:46,022 --> 00:56:47,932
Rym: I get emails on a regular basis.

842
00:56:48,576 --> 00:56:48,958
Rym: It's over.

843
00:56:49,018 --> 00:56:49,360
Rym: We did it.

844
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:49,923
Rym: We did one.

845
00:56:49,943 --> 00:56:52,719
Rym: you're gonna have to hold off a little bit before we do this again.

846
00:56:53,563 --> 00:56:54,085
Scott: Quite a bit.

847
00:56:54,346 --> 00:56:55,871
Scott: also send us Thursday.

848
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:58,100
Scott: show ideas don't involve zombies.

849
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:07,460
Rym: However, they might have figured out by you saying that that the reason we did a zombie episode is because we didn't have a better Thursday in which case they'll avoid sending us Thursday ideas.

850
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:12,455
Rym: What about our Thursday contest which they're all right the bad podcast contest.

851
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:12,816
Rym: Yes.

852
00:57:13,237 --> 00:57:14,240
Rym: We're still working on that.

853
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:16,387
Rym: We've got a lot of entries for it.

854
00:57:16,447 --> 00:57:17,751
Rym: So it's over.

855
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:18,775
Rym: no more entries.

856
00:57:18,815 --> 00:57:19,216
Rym: We're done.

857
00:57:19,517 --> 00:57:20,179
Rym: I'm going through them.

858
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:24,520
Rym: now I'm listening to several episodes from every single entry you sent us.

859
00:57:25,102 --> 00:57:31,570
Rym: I also am going to apologize right now to podcasts that may or may not have been done by people I know that were submitted to us.

860
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:38,617
Scott: Yeah, we did not Do any of these submissions or suggestions and it was completely up to people who listen to our show.

861
00:57:38,737 --> 00:57:39,560
Scott: which podcast?

862
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,813
Scott: They thought were the worst ever.

863
00:57:41,097 --> 00:57:45,777
Rym: granted I'm probably going to have my own submission even though I will not put it forth for a prize eligibility.

864
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:49,050
Scott: obviously I'll have to find a podcast to submit.

865
00:57:49,071 --> 00:57:49,754
Scott: I don't know.

866
00:57:49,774 --> 00:57:50,859
Scott: I didn't really think about it.

867
00:57:51,941 --> 00:57:52,884
Scott: Maybe we'll do just.

868
00:57:52,924 --> 00:57:55,032
Scott: next week's show is like the results of the contest.

869
00:57:55,052 --> 00:58:03,022
Rym: We'll review all these podcasts and yeah I'm not gonna promise though because it might be two weeks from now depending on how much time I put into deciding in the next Week.

870
00:58:03,323 --> 00:58:04,951
Scott: Yeah, I got to listen to some of these two.

871
00:58:04,971 --> 00:58:08,859
Rym: I don't want to let Rym make the decision on his own I don't want to have to make the decision on my own.

872
00:58:09,301 --> 00:58:10,203
Rym: I mean, I can't.

873
00:58:10,284 --> 00:58:13,834
