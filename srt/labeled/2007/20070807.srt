1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,088
Scott: It's Tuesday August 7th.

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,233
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:14,180
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:20,340
Scott: Tonight we talked about our personal preferences for first-person shooter key bindings.

5
00:00:24,343 --> 00:00:25,378
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,423 --> 00:00:37,047
Scott: So not too long after we did a show about how it's not video game season It's video game season.

7
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:38,772
Rym: well at least for Scott.

8
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:39,755
Rym: I'm not quite there yet.

9
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:40,738
Scott: You're not quite there.

10
00:00:40,758 --> 00:00:41,380
Scott: What's wrong with you?

11
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:44,490
Rym: I'm mostly reading books and doing computer stuff.

12
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:57,482
Scott: Yeah, I'm doing that stuff too, but I have definitely Significantly decreased the German board gaming and I significantly decreased the anime watching and the video gaming has Snuck up in there.

13
00:00:57,722 --> 00:01:06,019
Rym: see I've actually increased my video game not my video game at God my anime watching and The only reason we haven't been playing board games is that we've been busy.

14
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:21,410
Scott: Yep, and when it seems Maybe that's what it is is that when we're too busy to play board games You only have time for a video game in there because the board game you got to get a bunch of people to sit around for a few hours and Ds can go just about anywhere at any time.

15
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:33,100
Rym: it also didn't help that we usually only play board games now on the weekends and Last weekend I did stuff mostly GeekNights stuff and this this weekend probably also doing stuff like playing video games.

16
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:35,169
Rym: I'm actually foreseeing the board game.

17
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,153
Rym: I mean the only video game.

18
00:01:36,193 --> 00:01:38,608
Rym: I want to play is the new strikers game We picked up finally.

19
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:39,979
Scott: Yep, we got to pick that up.

20
00:01:40,202 --> 00:01:50,625
Scott: I'm also playing Dynamite heady and the original paper Mario on the virtual console, which are like the only two things on the virtual console worth the money and There's a bunch of stuff.

21
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:52,897
Scott: I'm gonna talk about in my news that I'm also playing.

22
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:58,340
Scott: so and Ds action with the pokemons and the planet puzzle leagues, etc.

23
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:03,536
Rym: See I'd started playing Pokemon again at the shore, but I got sick of that real quick.

24
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:04,700
Scott: You're planning yesterday.

25
00:02:05,403 --> 00:02:11,112
Rym: For actually I was playing it for a little bit yesterday and then I swapped back in advance wars I'm just saying you when you did play it.

26
00:02:11,193 --> 00:02:11,776
Scott: I heard it on.

27
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:16,990
Rym: Yep Never more than like 15 minutes at a time.

28
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,080
Rym: I can't stomach more than 15 minutes of Pokemon.

29
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:19,743
Scott: I know I was.

30
00:02:19,844 --> 00:02:22,799
Scott: I'm actually playing leaf green on the train again just to beat it.

31
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,371
Rym: Oh fire red is so much more fun than the DS.

32
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:33,860
Scott: Well, I know at least for single-player action It's so much better just because the combat is a reasonable speed or at least it feels like a reasonable speed.

33
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,525
Scott: Compared to diamond and pearl it's.

34
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:40,300
Rym: it's a lot faster and my little dude walks a lot faster and the plot is more plotty.

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,700
Scott: And it's the original Pokemon plot for the original Pokemon game.

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,975
Scott: It's every Pokemon plot since then has just been not as good because it's always the same.

37
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:53,413
Rym: It's alright your kid Here's your first Pokemon pick one of the three.

38
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,740
Rym: Oh, no, you have a rival.

39
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:56,727
Rym: Oh, we picked the one that's strong against you.

40
00:02:56,747 --> 00:03:00,060
Rym: then you go out and catch your otata and then you go off on your adventure.

41
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:02,689
Scott: I don't catch your otata or a Pidgey.

42
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:05,560
Rym: Ah, in fact, I caught a Pidgey and leveled it all the way up.

43
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:12,177
Scott: See I go and I use my main guy and I go straight for the bug forest and I get me.

44
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:13,180
Rym: bugs are crap.

45
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,217
Rym: There's no good bug Pokemon, uh butter free butter free can lick my balls.

46
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:18,959
Rym: dust ox.

47
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:27,956
Rym: Dust ox is worse than butter for that Scorpion thing that turns into the bigger scorpion thing is a bug Pokemon soccer.

48
00:03:27,996 --> 00:03:29,420
Scott: You suck bug Pokemon own you.

49
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,224
Rym: I don't like bugs.

50
00:03:31,364 --> 00:03:34,817
Scott: It's the one that looks like Mothra except bees and I don't like home be.

51
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:46,698
Scott: you know combi is probably the only bug Pokemon I respect but Combi evolves is only the female combis and actually I would use a male combi because I don't like the Vespa Quinn thing.

52
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:48,763
Scott: It's ugly Whatever.

53
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:50,994
Scott: No more Pokemon stock today, whatever.

54
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:51,959
Rym: So what do you got in the news?

55
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:56,003
Scott: Only like the biggest gaming news in a zillion years I will admit.

56
00:03:56,203 --> 00:04:00,199
Rym: Scott came running when he read this and told me and it was a big deal.

57
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:08,913
Rym: and I was real excited until the cynical side of my brain said wait a minute Rym There's no way that this is exactly what you actually want.

58
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:10,318
Rym: and upon further questioning.

59
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:21,192
Rym: It's not my fault You want something that's pretty much in feasible and impossible and I think the real question is it's not your fault that The only reason I wanted it is for that?

60
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:26,872
Rym: if it's not if it doesn't have the thing that it doesn't have Then I don't give one shit about it because I already own most of those games.

61
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:27,735
Scott: That's your problem.

62
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:48,278
Scott: Anyway, so You may know that there are many video games made by a company called id software mostly Wolfenstein doom quake Wolfenstein doom quake mostly but also commander keen Heretic and hex in quake to quake to drink to doom to doom 3.

63
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:48,559
Scott: Yes.

64
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:53,520
Rym: Yes Yes, I got to say that in all those things It seems like the twos were the best in every series.

65
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,326
Rym: Mmm, quake 3 was garbage.

66
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:58,573
Rym: doom 3 was slightly less garbage.

67
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:01,163
Rym: doom 2 best FPS ever I guess.

68
00:05:01,244 --> 00:05:06,329
Scott: I guess so, I guess on average the twos are much better I mean quake 2 compared to quake 1 or 3.

69
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:07,012
Rym: It's better than both.

70
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:07,474
Scott: I'm coming.

71
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:08,820
Scott: I mean all the commander Kean's are good.

72
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,563
Rym: Anyway, I don't.

73
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,627
Rym: keen is a whole different world.

74
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:11,972
Scott: So it's off plus up.

75
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:14,100
Rym: who's in doom - doom guy?

76
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:15,107
Rym: No, who else?

77
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,619
Scott: John Romero who else?

78
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,598
Scott: Commander keen that's right.

79
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:22,680
Scott: Anyway, so id software makes all these games.

80
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,240
Scott: These are very important games in the world of PC gaming and gaming in general.

81
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,203
Scott: Yeah Super important.

82
00:05:28,324 --> 00:05:32,000
Rym: regardless of what a lot of people say Wolfenstein was really the first FPS.

83
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:35,532
Rym: Doom was I would argue the first good FPS.

84
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:36,254
Scott: You suck.

85
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:37,438
Rym: I don't like Wolfenstein.

86
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:37,820
Rym: I suck.

87
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,713
Scott: It's Wolfenstein isn't while it looks like an FPS a shooting game.

88
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:45,040
Scott: It is actually a maze game a maze.

89
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:47,051
Scott: Find your way around.

90
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:49,886
Scott: Oh find the secret doors Like the treasure.

91
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:57,680
Scott: really two-dimensional mostly not well In fact, unless if you want to complain it was no more two-dimensional than then doom.

92
00:05:58,201 --> 00:06:02,533
Rym: No, because Wolfenstein couldn't have angles of walls that differed by anything.

93
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:03,937
Rym: It had to be 90 degrees or 180 degrees.

94
00:06:05,761 --> 00:06:07,790
Rym: Yeah, I couldn't have angles or anything interesting.

95
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:09,075
Rym: You couldn't have elevators.

96
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:09,638
Rym: It was amazing.

97
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:15,497
Scott: Doom didn't have real elevation because if you show what though it had effective elevation.

98
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:16,540
Scott: It wasn't effective.

99
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,827
Scott: You didn't have to aim up or down.

100
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:20,556
Rym: No, you didn't have to aim, but you still had to take that into account in the puzzles.

101
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,244
Scott: Not really.

102
00:06:22,305 --> 00:06:22,828
Rym: Yes, you did.

103
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:23,471
Scott: You could have flat.

104
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:24,999
Scott: you could flatten any doom map.

105
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:34,209
Rym: Yeah, you can but you still had to take it into account because while technically it's only 2d and the third dimension is just a coordinate number that doesn't actually do anything.

106
00:06:34,752 --> 00:06:41,680
Rym: the fact remains that the imp looks higher and He's up on that ledge and you can't get up on that ledge unless you find a lift to get up there.

107
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:54,830
Scott: Anyway the point is id software makes a lot of these games so they did and It has been very difficult for a long period of time to play a lot of these games Legally or at all.

108
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:59,057
Rym: well except for you know, doom Right doom to quake quake -.

109
00:06:59,097 --> 00:06:59,298
Rym: well

110
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:25,581
Scott: The problem is is that while the source code to many of these games is freely available The actual levels the wad files or what-have-you are owned by id software and if you want them legally you had to pay for them and Sometimes it was hard to get them if you didn't own them already and a lot of the DOS games Were difficult to play because you don't have a computer with DOS and they don't run just out of the box in Windows XP all the time.

111
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:30,358
Scott: so you need to set up some sort of emulation with DOS box or something like that like that.

112
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:39,500
Scott: and You know these very important games in gaming history were pretty much Unavailable to the gaming public for a long period of time.

113
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:43,100
Scott: I mean there was if I remember just less than a year ago.

114
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,976
Scott: I went to id software's website and they were like, yeah, you want Wolfenstein 3d legally.

115
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:49,200
Scott: give us 20 bucks.

116
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:50,486
Scott: It's like 20 bucks.

117
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:51,691
Scott: Are you out of your mind?

118
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:53,620
Rym: But I thought this was an important game.

119
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,646
Rym: I thought this was a big not worth 20 bucks.

120
00:07:56,048 --> 00:07:57,432
Rym: Oh, I see how the die rolls.

121
00:07:57,492 --> 00:07:58,355
Rym: I see how you roll.

122
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,178
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

123
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:02,889
Scott: So Id software announced that they were.

124
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:13,522
Scott: this is huge pretty much putting not just some but all of their games ever on steam as of Immediately.

125
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:17,576
Scott: right now you can get every id game on steam.

126
00:08:17,857 --> 00:08:21,328
Scott: right now this second They're there and you can buy them and they work.

127
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:29,470
Scott: and not only can you buy them individually like for example Let's see Wolfenstein 3d cost five dollars.

128
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:30,395
Scott: There you go.

129
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:31,199
Scott: That's a nice price.

130
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:33,732
Scott: But you can buy them in packs.

131
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:37,010
Scott: They have like an all quake pack That is all the quakes an all doom pack.

132
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,919
Scott: That is all the dooms and all wolfenstein back.

133
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,875
Scott: there's all the wolfensteins, etc, etc.

134
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:55,081
Scott: and those packs are pretty discounted compared to buying all the doom separately or all the quake separately, but they also have the everything super pack which if you buy it it costs you $70.

135
00:08:55,081 --> 00:09:03,624
Scott: and If you had bought all the games it includes individually on steam that would cost $214.

136
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:06,002
Rym: now think of that $70.

137
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:09,231
Rym: That's what I paid for Zelda 2 when it came out.

138
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:10,594
Rym: the day it came out.

139
00:09:10,654 --> 00:09:12,700
Scott: just Zelda 2 just Zelda to me.

140
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,480
Scott: Let me read the list of things you're getting for your $70 ready every commander keen.

141
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:21,232
Scott: Doom 3 the new the really new Doom 3.

142
00:09:21,232 --> 00:09:23,420
Scott: Doom 3 expansion resurrection of evil.

143
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:30,562
Scott: Doom 2 final doom heretic with the expansion hex and hex into hex in something else expansion.

144
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:32,630
Scott: master levels for doom 2. quake.

145
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,757
Scott: quake 2. quake 2 expansion.

146
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:36,282
Scott: another quake 2 Expansion.

147
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:38,268
Rym: quake 3 or quake 2 expansions.

148
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,400
Scott: there was quake 2 mission pack ground zero and quake 2 mission pack the reckoning.

149
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:45,919
Rym: I'll bet those are awful because I got to say quake 2 was not a game.

150
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:47,664
Rym: Quake 1 wasn't even a game.

151
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:49,710
Rym: there was the single player was garbage.

152
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:53,480
Rym: those games existed solely to be modded and into better games.

153
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:55,887
Scott: Pretty much quake 3 arena.

154
00:09:55,987 --> 00:09:57,271
Scott: quake 3 team arena.

155
00:09:57,752 --> 00:10:00,038
Scott: quake mission pack 1. quake mission pack 2.

156
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:03,940
Scott: Wow Expansions for quake 1. look at that return to castle Wolfenstein.

157
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,899
Scott: That's the newer Wolfenstein with the flamethrowers and stuff spear of destiny, which is the sequel to Wolfenstein 3d.

158
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,587
Scott: it's basically the same as Wolfenstein 3 only a really hard maps and ultimate doom.

159
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,775
Scott: and Wolfenstein 3d.

160
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:21,087
Scott: $70 but is more.

161
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,940
Scott: if you buy it now and you don't hesitate sound like an infomercial.

162
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,362
Scott: I know.

163
00:10:25,383 --> 00:10:31,170
Scott: right if you buy it now and you don't hesitate that's $63 not 70 now.

164
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:38,256
Rym: while I am NOT personally excited about it This is a big deal and most of you out there should probably buy this.

165
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:39,400
Scott: I couldn't resist.

166
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,427
Scott: I was just like well now or never by.

167
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:48,260
Scott: the only thing that's missing here is the new quake for which I guess is not You know, it's not made by id so it's not gonna be on here.

168
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,752
Scott: But a lot of the things on here aren't actually developed by id like those.

169
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:57,572
Scott: quake 2 expansions are made by other developing Developers and heretic and hexen are made by other developers.

170
00:10:57,653 --> 00:11:00,122
Scott: But oh, well, I guess that doesn't count I don't know.

171
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:04,343
Rym: now the reason I personally don't care is just that one I own all these games already I don't know.

172
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,760
Rym: in all these games at least not legally the only ones I don't own legally or the commander keen.

173
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:13,640
Rym: So if I think else I'm gonna buy all the commander Keens the ones that I own legally are ultimate doom.

174
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:16,183
Rym: Is that it?

175
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:20,260
Rym: because I bought doom I got the share where that was it.

176
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,230
Scott: The ultimate doom is doom 1 with that extra mission at the end.

177
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:26,241
Rym: I bought doom 1. then I bought doom 2.

178
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:27,647
Rym: I bought final doom later.

179
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:28,772
Scott: I didn't buy doom 2.

180
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:29,715
Scott: I didn't buy final doom.

181
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:30,860
Scott: I didn't buy Wolfenstein.

182
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:33,809
Rym: I bought quake 1 and I'm still quick.

183
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:34,812
Rym: I bought quake 2.

184
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:36,016
Scott: I've never bought any quakes.

185
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:37,882
Rym: I bought quake 3.

186
00:11:37,882 --> 00:11:41,174
Rym: Oh, no, I guess I never owned doom 3 or any of those.

187
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:48,340
Scott: but yeah the only game on here I've ever legally purchased before now is ultimate doom, even though I've played almost all of you pirating ass.

188
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:53,878
Rym: I was like the king of pirates in high school and yet I bought all those games.

189
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:58,779
Scott: and Yeah, the only one I bought was ultimate doom which is doom 1 with one extra level at the end.

190
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:08,190
Rym: Well, not one extra level one extra hole Okay, but the thing is not only do I own all these games but they all work just fine and wine and I got them All in Linux natively and all that business.

191
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:09,457
Rym: I can just play them anytime.

192
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:21,860
Rym: I want already I have everything I need and in fact I have the exact same doom doom 2 quake and quake 2 directories That I originally installed those on a crashed hard drive.

193
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:25,895
Rym: No, okay, because I copied stuff off that hard drive long before a crash.

194
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:26,617
Rym: Uh-huh.

195
00:12:26,818 --> 00:12:36,860
Rym: Yes The only things I lost for all the documents and things I didn't care about when I made my new computer I copied all the data that I needed to use regularly which meant, you know all my games, right?

196
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:48,707
Rym: So I've got all the mods and everything that aren't gonna be in here and - uh This pack doesn't come with any sort of additional or enhanced multiplayer Which is the only reason I would care.

197
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,874
Rym: well, I would pay hundreds of dollars.

198
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:52,760
Scott: You want something that doesn't exist.

199
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,780
Rym: Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

200
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:01,040
Rym: It's kind of like I want a cell phone that has X things in it because said cell phone does not exist in this world.

201
00:13:01,704 --> 00:13:02,389
Rym: I don't buy it.

202
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:04,059
Scott: That's like going to the store, right?

203
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:10,520
Scott: You're going to the classic car store and you're buying like a 1950s Corvette and you're saying hey, where's the fucking cruise control, man?

204
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:12,200
Scott: That's basically what you're saying.

205
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:13,105
Rym: No not at all.

206
00:13:13,146 --> 00:13:39,739
Rym: because the thing is if These weren't released on Steam and they had put any effort into putting a layer between the old networking crap of these games which many of them are internet enabled anyway and Made it so I could just play doom against people in Steam or run servers or something I would pay a lot of money because I'm fucking awesome at doom - say what you will about any other video game skills I have there are very few people who can beat me in a doom - deathmatch.

207
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:43,780
Scott: Anyway, that basically the question I had when this came out.

208
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,180
Scott: The only thing that worried me was how are they gonna get these games to work in Windows XP or Vista?

209
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,209
Scott: I mean, these are old DOS games.

210
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:54,647
Scott: if you just try to run them, they don't work, you know Did they patch them?

211
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,980
Scott: did they rewrite them to work in Windows?

212
00:13:57,401 --> 00:14:03,401
Scott: Actually my version of doom that I bought that I was just talking about ran in Windows 95. it came with doom 95.

213
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:05,870
Scott: This doesn't come with doom 95.

214
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,680
Scott: So I don't know how they got these DOS games to work.

215
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,302
Scott: What did they do?

216
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:13,158
Scott: and Rym was like, oh man, they rewrote them all to be all modern.

217
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:13,984
Scott: and I'm like, no I wasn't.

218
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:15,539
Rym: I was saying I hope that's what they did.

219
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,894
Rym: Yeah, anyway, because I wanted my all I wanted was multiplayer through Steam.

220
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:21,700
Rym: That is the only thing I cared about.

221
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:31,780
Scott: well, anyway what they did is They basically took DOS box the thing that you would have to use on your own to make these things work.

222
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,789
Rym: Well, except the ones that just run in Linux, right?

223
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,989
Scott: Right.

224
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,239
Scott: Well, except the ones that also just run in.

225
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:38,104
Scott: Well some of them.

226
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,672
Scott: but what what you said just run in Linux.

227
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:41,977
Scott: you threw me off because they do.

228
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:43,743
Scott: well, it's steam It's only on Windows.

229
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:44,526
Scott: Linux has nothing to do.

230
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:47,658
Rym: No, I'm just saying that like quake just runs in Linux.

231
00:14:47,718 --> 00:15:00,908
Scott: fine Yes But the point is for all the games included in this pack that do not just work in Windows already the DOS games they basically put DOS box in there and Specially configured it to make sure it works.

232
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:06,230
Scott: just right to save you the trouble and when you run the game It opens up DOS box and it opens up the game.

233
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,154
Scott: It's pretty funny now.

234
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:08,460
Rym: in the very least that gives me hope.

235
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:24,320
Rym: I kind of am thinking about just buying this anyway, because while it doesn't have the multiplayer I want This peg does offer one important thing and that is I can know for a fact that pretty much everyone out there Will be using the exact same version of these games as the steam version.

236
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,143
Scott: So

237
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:37,799
Rym: if I cobble together or set up some sort of way of multiplayer in over the internet with these things which isn't that hard to do I've done it before in DOS box I'll be able to play against all you fools in Doom 2 deathmatch, which is my only goal.

238
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:38,502
Rym: Yeah, it's.

239
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:43,520
Scott: I personally think it's just too much trouble and no one cares and that's why they didn't bother.

240
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:46,958
Scott: You're probably the only one in the world who wants to play Doom 2 deathmatch.

241
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:47,360
Rym: I don't know.

242
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:48,991
Rym: It's really fun to play that.

243
00:15:49,153 --> 00:15:55,160
Rym: plus remember that gen game We used to play that quake to mod that basically had the Wolfenstein guy the quake guy right to guy.

244
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,855
Scott: I'm sure this is all correct.

245
00:15:57,017 --> 00:16:09,915
Scott: But As long as actual newer better FPS multiplayer games exist like the Team Fortress 2 that's coming out real soon I believe I'm gonna strike counter-strike because counter-strike is still the most played FPS.

246
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:12,578
Scott: while those things exist Why?

247
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,954
Scott: There's just no point to play Doom 2 multiplayer.

248
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:22,122
Rym: Oh Because you know while Mario 64 exists, there's no reason to ever play Mario 1.

249
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:26,160
Scott: Well, I mean, it's sort of like in terms of a multiplayer competitive game.

250
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,675
Rym: Why rather play ice hockey multiplayer than any modern hockey game?

251
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:31,544
Scott: And that's a different game though I'm talking about.

252
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:37,440
Scott: why would you play the game the the Mario tennis for the n64 and you could play the GameCube Mario tennis?

253
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:43,360
Rym: Well in this case, I have to say that other than serious and no other FPS has ever had the feel of doom.

254
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:49,360
Scott: That's true because no other FPS really tries to be the run-around shooting senselessly game.

255
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:56,100
Scott: They always either try to be the slow and careful ones or you know half-life awesome cinematic types.

256
00:16:56,381 --> 00:17:06,040
Rym: Well, not just that but in terms of the speed because quake 2 and doom were super fast And you ran really fast and the game was not terribly realistic.

257
00:17:06,181 --> 00:17:15,054
Rym: It was just fun and like when all the threes came out of these games They were really kind of slow and it really changed the way the games played.

258
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:22,273
Rym: the games that I'd play with like the FOV 170 in my mouth sensitivity crazily twitching around barely even looking at the screen.

259
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:25,140
Rym: Yeah while I like that action That's my favorite.

260
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:30,600
Scott: Enjoy an FPS that where all you do is run around shooting stuff like a serious Sam.

261
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:41,020
Scott: I must say that the days of the FOV blah and The really kind of hacked up engines with all the you know, ghetto duct tape all over the game.

262
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:43,434
Scott: I while I'm nostalgic for those days.

263
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:47,491
Rym: I'm glad they're over I will say one thing and that one thing is natural selection.

264
00:17:47,512 --> 00:18:02,234
Rym: now just like it was not duct tape Had they not fucked up the gorge and broken the animation So it didn't jump properly and it jumped in this weird kind of broken away because there's no jump animation That game wouldn't have been half as fun.

265
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:06,709
Rym: Yeah, okay Plus babbler's babbler's babbler's.

266
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:07,835
Scott: Yes babbler's.

267
00:18:08,397 --> 00:18:14,320
Rym: so uh There wasn't really any other video game news I wanted to talk about because most of it as always is rumors and bullshit.

268
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:17,229
Rym: But I want to talk about one of these bullshit rumors.

269
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,754
Scott: Oh bullshit rumor you say.

270
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:32,020
Rym: so joystick announced that someone from Best Buy or someone hanging out pointed out that you could go to Best Buy's website and click somewhere and Pre-order Rock Band for the ps3 and it was $60.

271
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:43,400
Rym: Alright and according to the people in their screenshots of all this it says and I quote included drum guitar and microphone peripherals enable players to perform music together.

272
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:47,163
Rym: emphasis added on the word included Mm-hmm.

273
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:50,233
Rym: Think about that $60 for the whole game and all the peripherals.

274
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:56,080
Rym: Yeah, I'm sure that's gonna work out for you real well Well, the thing is people are saying that this was on the Best Buy website.

275
00:18:56,542 --> 00:19:05,374
Rym: so of course joystick broke the news and a million people tried to pre-order it and Best Buy strangely enough made that page disappear right quick.

276
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:06,417
Scott: Huh?

277
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:07,180
Scott: What do you know?

278
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,392
Rym: And of course, there's now the internet outrage of yeah fuck Best Buy.

279
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:12,376
Rym: They'd better give me it for $60.

280
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:14,589
Rym: Goddamn it It's their fault.

281
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:15,458
Rym: What the fuck?

282
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,423
Scott: What the fuck people?

283
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:23,800
Scott: and because a company is messing around with their website somehow you're entitled to get something at a huge discount.

284
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:25,505
Scott: Did they make?

285
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:26,571
Scott: I don't get it.

286
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:28,562
Rym: the thing that's on Joystick.

287
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:30,993
Rym: one of the first comments here and this is modded up.

288
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:35,388
Rym: as far as you can mod something up Businesses take advantage of consumers every day.

289
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:38,276
Rym: whenever consumers get a chance to stick it to big business.

290
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:39,199
Rym: I say go for it.

291
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,654
Rym: Meanwhile, all the buried comments are things like god, how cheap are you guys?

292
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:46,940
Rym: or if you actually like this game?

293
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,039
Rym: Why don't you pay what it's worth?

294
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,649
Scott: Yeah That's what I'm saying.

295
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:53,150
Scott: I Don't know what else is there to say.

296
00:19:53,231 --> 00:19:54,300
Scott: people are fucking stupid.

297
00:19:54,541 --> 00:20:02,296
Scott: But also the only thing I can say bad about Best Buy in this case is Why did be companies mess around with their website with with stuff?

298
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:03,080
Scott: That's not ready yet.

299
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,962
Scott: What freaking.

300
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:05,527
Scott: you have a development website.

301
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:10,240
Scott: you fiddle around there and when everything is good to go only then do you put it?

302
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,283
Scott: On the real website.

303
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,226
Scott: It should be it should.

304
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:25,751
Scott: there's no reason from a technology standpoint that any Public person on the on the big internet should be able to get to anything on your website that you do Want them to get to ever I that happens.

305
00:20:26,032 --> 00:20:28,380
Scott: you fucked up and your IT web people are bad.

306
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:33,980
Rym: I can tell you why because it didn't hurt Best Buy at all and they couldn't give a shit.

307
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:36,936
Scott: They couldn't give a shit, but they should still if they're right there.

308
00:20:36,956 --> 00:20:37,559
Rym: Why do they care?

309
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:46,992
Rym: Remember enterprise is a different world in the in the enterprise IT world no matter what you say No matter what argument you make for or against anything.

310
00:20:47,353 --> 00:20:51,428
Rym: The first question you will be asked is Will this lose the company money?

311
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:57,820
Rym: and if the answer is not yes, and the figure is not millions Then the answer is why should I give a shit?

312
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:08,840
Scott: There is a possibility that if a web if a a certain page were to go up depending on the content of that page Best Buy could be sued for false advertising.

313
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:15,419
Rym: No, because Best Buy has a very clear policy that there might be typos on their website and none of that information means shit.

314
00:21:17,683 --> 00:21:23,120
Scott: In other words as long as that agreements there these people didn't read it and fuck them.

315
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:38,972
Rym: Yeah I just find it interesting because this happens all the time and there's always this seething internet outrage over it and I gotta say you guys might feel great sticking it to the man for mom's basement But someone owes you something cuz they made a typo I'm sure.

316
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:48,665
Rym: see Indignance is something that bothers me a lot But right now maybe not right under that because there's a lot of things like rampant obesity and smokers and those are related to Indignance.

317
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:55,500
Rym: Yeah, well smoking not Smoking is a way down with those annoying things like people with bad teeth or bad breath or whatever.

318
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:09,830
Rym: Yeah, but people who feel entitled especially when they have no right to their entitlement things of the day.

319
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,250
Rym: So, uh, I kind of like rap.

320
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:28,742
Rym: I mean, I don't like gangsta hip-hop whatever but I otherwise like rap as a medium or genre or whatever a lot and Nothing gets my goat up in a good way more than rappers dueling, especially if they're dueling Well, just kind of lyrical rhymes and like it's

321
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:29,244
Scott: all

322
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:30,750
Rym: you got served

323
00:22:31,212 --> 00:22:31,754
Scott: it's on.

324
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:47,154
Rym: but our friend katsu sent us this and It's along those lines, but suffice to say it is a Mendel's son Versus Wagner or for all of you Philsteins out there Wagner.

325
00:22:47,174 --> 00:22:57,810
Rym: Yeah now now I do have my opinions about the music of both of these people and I'm generally the opinion That Wagner was an insane idiot and I hate all of his operas despite the fact that they're about awesome things.

326
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:04,070
Scott: Did you see in the news today that apparently like in some Russian soldiers Attic or something like that?

327
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,234
Scott: They found Hitler's record collection.

328
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:07,336
Scott: There's record collection.

329
00:23:07,476 --> 00:23:08,478
Rym: I did indeed see that.

330
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:17,329
Rym: Yeah, it was pretty funny but I Just want to warn you all if you ever feel the urge to go see live got her damarang.

331
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:19,076
Scott: There are any other Wagner?

332
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:19,578
Scott: kind of?

333
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,290
Rym: take you all of the gutter damarang because it goes on for fucking ever.

334
00:23:22,552 --> 00:23:24,041
Rym: It just never ends it.

335
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:26,234
Scott: Ah bring your DS It.

336
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:27,922
Rym: what the battery won't last long enough.

337
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:29,370
Rym: good fucking God.

338
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:40,850
Rym: Was that the worst thing ever bring a spare battery and bring an iPod to bring a pistol and a bullets bring some geek Archives but uh, or you could text message with quagmire.

339
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:46,536
Rym: But anyway, this is uh, these two people Wrapping it out.

340
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:49,006
Rym: I gotta say it's actually pretty hilarious.

341
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:58,140
Scott: It is pretty funny All right, so there's an awesome architect by the name of Shigeru ban and he makes things.

342
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,183
Scott: as architects do.

343
00:23:59,203 --> 00:24:00,165
Scott: he makes structures.

344
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:09,250
Scott: He makes bridges and churches and museums and Houses and things and he makes them very interestingly.

345
00:24:09,512 --> 00:24:13,857
Scott: I always wonder how guys like this make money Like he made her the thing here.

346
00:24:13,978 --> 00:24:22,710
Scott: the one I'm gonna that drew my attention was he made a bridge out of cardboard Which I can understand because you know, you can make cardboard boxes that you could stand on very easily.

347
00:24:22,831 --> 00:24:23,696
Scott: Just put them on your floor.

348
00:24:23,716 --> 00:24:25,750
Scott: stand on and not flat ones either.

349
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:27,796
Scott: I'm talking like a box with air in the middle.

350
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,685
Scott: So making a bridge out of cardboard.

351
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:32,190
Scott: It is not too big a deal.

352
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,917
Scott: But yeah, he made a bridge out of cardboard.

353
00:24:34,957 --> 00:24:36,363
Scott: he made a church out of paper.

354
00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:40,857
Scott: he made a museum out of Like shipping containers.

355
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:43,110
Rym: these things are pretty damn impressive looking.

356
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:47,250
Scott: He made he made a house where two walls of the house are just a curtain.

357
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,694
Scott: That's pretty cool.

358
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:54,570
Scott: And he made a whole bunch of other things and you can find them all with links on this blog page here.

359
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,879
Scott: You know, if you just keep browsing around you'll see all of it.

360
00:24:56,939 --> 00:25:00,774
Scott: You'll learn all about him, but that's pretty interesting I still have.

361
00:25:00,794 --> 00:25:09,370
Scott: the question though is how someone like this makes fucking money because I Probably how many people need cardboard bridges that are hiring him?

362
00:25:09,731 --> 00:25:14,012
Rym: I'll bet a lot of it is government grants either for the arts or for science, you know Maybe the bridge.

363
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:23,069
Rym: you could construct this as some sort of an experiment or check out the the fact that I can use this Lightweight material to make something strong based solely on the design all that sort of business.

364
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,358
Rym: Maybe he's independently wealthy.

365
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,646
Rym: Maybe he has some sort of patron or benefactor.

366
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:27,827
Rym: Yep.

367
00:25:27,947 --> 00:25:34,764
Scott: All right I'll just end by saying the hippies are all over this of course because hey They're like whoo a bridge made out of cardboard and paper.

368
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:36,050
Scott: Hey, it's so green.

369
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:46,830
Scott: Maybe we should take this guy out because even though they don't they probably not thinking about how many trees you had to cut Down to make that bridge versus just a bridge made out of logs or the fact that uh, it's gonna rain someday.

370
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:47,896
Scott: I mean think about that.

371
00:25:48,097 --> 00:25:50,289
Scott: It takes out like a whole tree to make a paper, right?

372
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,107
Scott: So why would the hippies be so happy about a boy?

373
00:25:54,127 --> 00:25:58,001
Rym: wait wait wait It takes a whole tree to make a paper.

374
00:25:58,142 --> 00:26:00,530
Scott: no to make a lot, you know, okay, I love for a second.

375
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,604
Rym: I mean, well, what do you mean by a paper?

376
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:12,030
Scott: Well, no If you make paper out of a tree that paper will make less bridge than the log that you you turned into paper.

377
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:19,303
Rym: Well, depending on how you you I mean say you have some nano machines to take the atoms out of that paper and turn it Into titanium, you know what I'm saying?

378
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:20,167
Rym: I do I do.

379
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:29,809
Scott: Yes, so what you know, it just shows again another example of Hippies, you know thinking something's green and not really thinking of all the way through.

380
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,375
Rym: Wow, I'm really surprised.

381
00:26:32,395 --> 00:26:37,590
Rym: you took something about an architect making some art and turned it into an anti hippie thing.

382
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,249
Scott: I had to go somewhere with it.

383
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:44,253
Scott: I couldn't just leave it at the architect cuz I didn't have much else to say about it other than it's cool Check it out.

384
00:26:44,293 --> 00:26:45,821
Scott: So I had to think up one other thing to say.

385
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:47,549
Rym: I didn't have anywhere to go with my thing of the.

386
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,160
Rym: That's the only reason I brought it got her.

387
00:26:49,322 --> 00:26:50,470
Rym: he got her fucking dammer.

388
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:56,998
Scott: The only reason I was able to take it that way also is because this is a hippie blog and that's why I came to mind Ah hippie blogs.

389
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,447
Rym: Yep, right.

390
00:26:58,768 --> 00:27:02,122
Rym: So This was actually reminded to us.

391
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:06,039
Rym: That was an awkward way of phrasing that Reminded of this by yes.

392
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,650
Rym: Well, we brought this up a way back.

393
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:11,789
Rym: You know how pretty much ten times a week we say man we could do a whole show about that.

394
00:27:12,332 --> 00:27:17,450
Rym: Well someone remembered when we said it about this topic and reminded us to do it and I couldn't come up with much better.

395
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,925
Rym: And Scott and I this is actually a point of contention among us.

396
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:25,933
Rym: So tonight Gonna talk a bit about Vertical this.

397
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:32,050
Rym: hey to me anyone who doesn't use inverted mouse in an FPS is a heathen barbarian.

398
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,656
Scott: You're a heathen barbarian for using it.

399
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:37,470
Rym: It's not the default for it used to be the default for the longest time.

400
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:41,901
Scott: It was the default Because in the flight simulator games it was default.

401
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:44,290
Rym: I was the default in early FPS is like which one.

402
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,330
Rym: I'm pretty sure it was the default in the original quake.

403
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:49,290
Scott: I don't think I'm gonna go check on that cuz I have the original quake.

404
00:27:49,671 --> 00:27:51,962
Rym: Yeah, maybe there's an update that changed it, but we'll see.

405
00:27:52,123 --> 00:27:52,806
Scott: I'll go check it.

406
00:27:52,846 --> 00:27:53,710
Scott: I'm pretty sure it wasn't.

407
00:27:54,292 --> 00:28:01,605
Rym: Anyway, you see way back in the day I always heard rumors about people would use their mouse to play Doom or whatever.

408
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:02,890
Scott: I can start earlier than that.

409
00:28:03,311 --> 00:28:08,430
Scott: I played Wolfenstein 3d before there any FPS is other than Wolfenstein 3d before doom existed, right?

410
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:12,630
Scott: And I always I liked the game, but it was difficult to play.

411
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:21,342
Scott: the reason was is because I could either play with the get the keyboard or with a gamepad or With the mouse and the way the game was programmed.

412
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:29,890
Scott: you had buttons to go forward backward Turn left turn right shoot open doors, and there was a strafe button.

413
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:35,009
Scott: And if you held the strafe button you could strafe left and right without turning left and right.

414
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:46,330
Scott: This was kind of annoying because if I played with just the mouse you'd have a three button mouse with like shoot open doors strafe And you'd have to keep picking up the mouse and moving it forward to go forward a lot.

415
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:47,949
Scott: So I'd play with the keyboard.

416
00:28:48,391 --> 00:29:10,424
Scott: But I played with the keyboard turning kind of sucked because I had to turn with the keyboard and I couldn't turn Faster when I needed to and there was a bad guy there and I kind of wanted to shoot with the mouse button and it just sucked all around and It continued to suck because I had those same problems up until Real 3d FPS's came out and I learned of the keyboard mouse combination.

417
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:13,999
Rym: see for some reason for the longest time I never thought to put two and two together.

418
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,130
Rym: I never thought that I could use both at the same time.

419
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,053
Scott: Well, I don't.

420
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:20,304
Scott: it's for some reason like there wasn't an option to do that.

421
00:29:20,545 --> 00:29:21,709
Rym: Well for Doom there was yeah.

422
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:26,366
Rym: But to the first real FPS, yeah, but not quake.

423
00:29:26,406 --> 00:29:28,553
Scott: I guess the first Cuz.

424
00:29:28,573 --> 00:29:29,197
Scott: it was the 3d.

425
00:29:29,257 --> 00:29:30,203
Scott: it was actually 3.

426
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:30,766
Rym: it was the first 3d FPS.

427
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:34,888
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is from the players perspective Doom was 3d.

428
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,497
Rym: Kind of yeah, that's so much.

429
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:39,380
Rym: it looked 3d.

430
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:41,186
Rym: you could go up and down you can.

431
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:42,390
Scott: it worked up and down.

432
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:44,729
Rym: Yeah, you couldn't look up and down but you could go up and down.

433
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,419
Scott: Yeah, you weren't actually going up or down you couldn't.

434
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:48,704
Rym: the player didn't know that.

435
00:29:48,724 --> 00:29:50,250
Scott: there couldn't be like an imp under you.

436
00:29:50,671 --> 00:29:54,910
Rym: Yes, but you know what the player didn't know that it was very difficult for the player to find that out.

437
00:29:55,694 --> 00:30:02,190
Scott: I think it was pretty obvious Not so much especially in Doom 2 where they use where you had a 2d map that nothing was on top of anything.

438
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:03,677
Rym: Yeah, but part of that.

439
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:06,435
Rym: I mean the thing is I don't know why you're so down on doom than that I'm not.

440
00:30:06,476 --> 00:30:10,061
Rym: do not do Really really 3d and a lot of the maps.

441
00:30:10,081 --> 00:30:11,308
Scott: I'm just saying it doesn't feel 3d for me.

442
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,663
Rym: I play doom and it's it's well wait you're talking about doom 1 which actually was very 2d.

443
00:30:15,904 --> 00:30:17,690
Rym: also doom - all did you play?

444
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,330
Rym: All the way through doom - yeah, because a lot of the later levels in fact, there's one level.

445
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:29,820
Rym: It was just a gigantic tower for the most part and gigantic cities where you go up massive Elevators to these high elevations and you look down and see shit.

446
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:32,248
Scott: Yeah, it just didn't really feel 3d to me.

447
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:34,759
Rym: Yeah, whatever but that game.

448
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,370
Rym: very clearly the year there was the option to use the mouse and the keyboard.

449
00:30:37,491 --> 00:30:39,059
Rym: But I just never thought of that.

450
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,130
Scott: I didn't think of it either because none of my friends did it.

451
00:30:41,251 --> 00:30:41,595
Scott: So why?

452
00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:42,690
Rym: yeah, right?

453
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:45,569
Scott: You looked in the actual options menu.

454
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:50,890
Scott: It would always be like, you know configure the keyboard configure the mouse configure a gamepad.

455
00:30:51,172 --> 00:30:54,190
Scott: They didn't if it would have said keyboard and mouse on the screen.

456
00:30:54,571 --> 00:30:56,058
Scott: I would have figured it out, but it never did.

457
00:30:56,078 --> 00:30:58,510
Rym: Well, the other thing was I remember that god-awful.

458
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:01,410
Rym: What wasn't that god-awful Jurassic Park game for the Super Nintendo?

459
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:07,990
Rym: I had it and it always said if you have the Super Nintendo mouse you can control the FPS parts with the mouse.

460
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,857
Rym: And I was always excited about that.

461
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,701
Rym: and I finally got Mario Paint one day and I immediately Plugged that mouse in.

462
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:15,890
Rym: it sucked.

463
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:25,290
Rym: Well, I remember trying to move forward by scroll the mouse forward pick it up Scroll the mouse forward pick it up pull it back and the dinosaurs just fucking ate me exactly.

464
00:31:26,032 --> 00:31:31,704
Rym: but one day I decided to use the mouse and the keyboard and on that day

465
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:31,744
Scott: I

466
00:31:32,526 --> 00:31:42,730
Rym: used one setup of keyboard and mouse where my fingers were on everything and I've used that exact same setup in every FPS from that day until today and I continue to use it.

467
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:45,769
Scott: Yeah basically What happened to me as I was playing I think?

468
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:56,145
Scott: Shogo marble armor division which came for free with my logitech wingman gaming mouse when I got my penny I'm three 450 in 1999 98. that was an actual 3d FPS.

469
00:31:57,011 --> 00:31:59,281
Scott: it's actually a pretty cool game if you can find it cuz it's.

470
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:09,807
Scott: it's like an anime with an anime plot and a lot of anime references and half the FPS levels you're in a robot and Half the FPS levels you're on your own and it's it's actually really fun.

471
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:10,410
Scott: I'm gonna go play that.

472
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:18,270
Scott: Anyway in that game I was playing it using my old doom Wolfenstein controls and it didn't work out too.

473
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:29,760
Scott: Cuz you know my my habit was always to you know, if I got a new PC game I threw out I just completely deleted whatever default control configuration.

474
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,150
Scott: They gave me and put my own in there, you know, cuz that's what I wanted now.

475
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,485
Rym: That's what I also always did.

476
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:44,078
Scott: Yep But I didn't know so much about the 3d FPS is 1999 because I had been using a 486 up until then which couldn't handle them and So I kind of fucked it up.

477
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:53,253
Scott: and when I realized they couldn't play the game So well, I sort of played with the default configuration just once and I didn't like it because it was a WASD business and I was.

478
00:32:53,353 --> 00:33:00,508
Scott: I liked using the arrows where the up and the down were directly on top of each other instead of the WASD where the W is slightly to the left.

479
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:10,750
Scott: and But I learned about the mouse keyboard combination Just even if the only button on the keyboard was the forward button and the back button that was enough.

480
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:14,770
Scott: You know how I could just I guess strafe left and strafe right also.

481
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,730
Scott: But you really only need four buttons and the mouse and I can play most FPS.

482
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:28,690
Rym: I guess for me, I was just really lucky and that the setup I used mostly by chance Ended up having enough keys at my disposal to where no matter how complicated an FPS got.

483
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:34,789
Rym: I mean I use the same friggin setup in tribes too that I used in doom and it worked perfectly for me.

484
00:33:35,385 --> 00:33:46,130
Scott: Yeah See I'd use the arrows the actual arrow keys on the keyboard and then I would use like the control that was pretty close to The arrows and the shift above that and the some of the lower left numpad keys

485
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,214
Rym: Yep, like insert and

486
00:33:47,495 --> 00:33:56,250
Scott: like the page down and the end and the insert and I would use you know Like the the the zero on the the calculator part.

487
00:33:56,651 --> 00:34:02,190
Scott: I used all those buttons the enter and it was pretty good because the arrows were sort of separated from everything else.

488
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,198
Scott: So it was like arrows.

489
00:34:03,218 --> 00:34:08,963
Scott: and then when I needed extra stuff Which I didn't need too often because on my mouse, which is three buttons, right?

490
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:11,230
Scott: I could you know change weapons.

491
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:13,089
Scott: I could jump duck and shoot.

492
00:34:13,732 --> 00:34:18,349
Scott: I only needed like the secondary attack and the use item on the keyboard and that was it.

493
00:34:18,871 --> 00:34:26,460
Scott: So to control and shift I'm with my pinky finger on the keyboard I'm good, and I didn't really play any complicated FPS.

494
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:29,730
Scott: is that required any more buttons for a very long time?

495
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:36,530
Rym: So I think what did it for me was mostly the fact that I because I had an internet connection and cable modem I had access to a lot of online play.

496
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:49,230
Rym: So as a result like with quake one and quake two I played a lot of those mega TF weapons factory action quake mods that For anyone who's played those games you needed like 30 keys bound to things or you couldn't play for shit.

497
00:34:49,813 --> 00:34:51,726
Scott: Yeah, that's why those games aren't around anymore.

498
00:34:51,746 --> 00:34:58,650
Rym: Yeah I mean those were games where I had to write complicated scripts to do basic in-game functions.

499
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,508
Scott: Yeah, yeah nowadays the game should be doing that shit for you, and they do.

500
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:10,209
Rym: in fact I just I do want to say that in quake 2 Remember in quake way you had the offhand grenade where you could throw a grenade, but still have your weapon up.

501
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:11,775
Rym: Quake 2 didn't have that.

502
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:25,863
Rym: I wrote a script that effectively through a lot of Somewhat dubious, but perfectly non cheating legitimate means allowed me to have an offhand grenade Awesome even to the point that I could hold it down and kind of cook it before I threw it.

503
00:35:26,164 --> 00:35:34,287
Scott: and there was one actually Complicated 3d game that wasn't technically an FPS where I did need a lot more keys and that game was descent.

504
00:35:34,648 --> 00:35:58,005
Scott: Oh descent Descent 2 and descent 3. but in those games I either used the joystick throttle combination in which case there was no keyboard or mouse to be seen or I used all Keyboard where I would use the numpad as sort of the move might ship around and look around and I would use the the keyboard where all the letters were for all the weapons and items and the gizmos.

505
00:35:58,065 --> 00:36:04,770
Rym: well descent was really a Unique game in the sense that it was free space, but games like tie fighter were also free space.

506
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:10,550
Rym: But tie fighter had the constant forward momentum, and it felt a lot more like you're flying a plane than a spaceship.

507
00:36:10,871 --> 00:36:13,042
Rym: Yeah, if it was a fanciful spaceship, I guess.

508
00:36:13,082 --> 00:36:18,955
Rym: but in descent I guess it was more realistic in that there was a lot more Spin around.

509
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:22,150
Rym: go backwards you're flying like backwards down a corridor shooting up.

510
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,497
Scott: It says the thing about descent.

511
00:36:23,577 --> 00:36:25,085
Scott: right because in a normal FPS.

512
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:25,910
Scott: How can you move?

513
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,340
Scott: You're a guy with feet usually.

514
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:34,029
Scott: so you can go forward backwards You can rotate left rotate right jump duck and strafe left and right and that's about it.

515
00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:35,810
Scott: You can do some of them in combination.

516
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:44,450
Scott: so you can like rotate left as you strafe right to sort of pull back or You know you can duck and creep forward and turn left at the same time.

517
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,135
Scott: But it's not all that complicated.

518
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:49,506
Scott: in descent you could go any direction so check this out.

519
00:36:49,526 --> 00:36:55,770
Scott: you can go forward backwards You could rotate the left and right you could rotate up and down.

520
00:36:56,091 --> 00:37:02,875
Scott: You know you could move your ship up move it straight down Move it straight left and straight right.

521
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:19,050
Scott: so you could strafe in any direction rotate in any direction and move forward and backward and When you combined a lot of those things together You could actually pull up very complicated aerial maneuvers some of which were essential to killing any human opponents.

522
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:20,978
Rym: Man, that was a fucking good game.

523
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:21,741
Scott: Yeah, I got.

524
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,428
Scott: I got to send three or to end to send two.

525
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:23,850
Scott: we go play.

526
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:25,295
Rym: I have to send three as well.

527
00:37:25,556 --> 00:37:26,920
Rym: I got the CDs laying around somewhere.

528
00:37:27,221 --> 00:37:27,863
Scott: We could play that.

529
00:37:28,285 --> 00:37:29,208
Scott: maybe we should Windows 95 game.

530
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,696
Scott: Yeah, anyway anyway.

531
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:33,582
Rym: Yeah, so uh I don't.

532
00:37:33,622 --> 00:37:35,729
Rym: I guess we could talk about cuz I. I like.

533
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:38,770
Rym: I said I use kind of a weird setup, so I don't know if I should let Scott go first.

534
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,858
Scott: I changed my setup recently.

535
00:37:40,979 --> 00:37:41,300
Scott: actually.

536
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,750
Rym: see the thing is I started with this default setup.

537
00:37:43,832 --> 00:37:45,152
Rym: I think it was some game I played.

538
00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:57,390
Rym: use this like the basic setup as the absolute default that you could possibly have and I was definitely influenced by the fact that if you look at the comma and the period keys on a keyboard They have the left and the right carrots.

539
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:05,850
Rym: They're like left and right arrows, and I just felt like that should be strafe left and strafe right And that kind of like my whole thing centered around those two keys.

540
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:10,650
Rym: Not bad, and I think the fact that early by default a lot of games use spacebar as jump.

541
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:14,764
Scott: Yeah, a lot of games did use spacebar as jump, but wolfenstein 3d and doom.

542
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:16,390
Scott: I think use spacebar as open door.

543
00:38:16,932 --> 00:38:19,845
Scott: Yeah, I think that was before the days where there was a jump though.

544
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:20,930
Scott: You couldn't jump in those games.

545
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,696
Rym: Yep, see the real thing was though.

546
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:33,590
Rym: I started with this kind of rudimentary, but random chance setup But as I started playing these mega TF and quake weapons factory whatever games, and I started needing all these other key binds.

547
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:48,048
Rym: I actually sat down with a picture of a keyboard and mapped out like this whole Complicated system of how I would forever more deal with any FPS I ever needed to have key bindings for and I've struck to that system to this day.

548
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:50,777
Rym: Uh-huh, I actually broke it up into.

549
00:38:51,117 --> 00:38:55,389
Rym: this will sound silly, but five different tiers of functions in games.

550
00:38:56,152 --> 00:39:04,280
Rym: Aha, there's the primaries and the primaries are the things that by default if I'm not doing anything else My fingers are always on the keys to be able to do this.

551
00:39:04,461 --> 00:39:05,063
Scott: move and shoot.

552
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:09,420
Rym: pretty much move and shoot Jumping strafe and duck and use.

553
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:11,630
Rym: no use is not a primary.

554
00:39:12,772 --> 00:39:15,350
Scott: There's a lot of using going on in modern games.

555
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:27,977
Rym: Oh while there is use is not a primary because basically when I said the primaries what I thought was things that I need to be able to do 100% of the time in Combination with other things no matter what.

556
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:37,748
Rym: as in I should always be able to do at least some of these things and Things from other tiers at the same time and they're things that I have to be doing instinctually and without thought.

557
00:39:37,848 --> 00:39:41,790
Rym: muscle memory Using like opening doors are conscious actions.

558
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:44,350
Rym: I have to think do I want to open this door?

559
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,170
Rym: Am I prepared for what may or may not be on the other side of this door?

560
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:47,550
Scott: That's.

561
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:53,350
Scott: but the thing is the use button is also used like flicking switches and now grabbing turrets and getting in vehicle.

562
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:56,370
Rym: Those are conscious actions for me.

563
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,958
Rym: I do not ever want to do those things automatically.

564
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:07,629
Rym: the moment I automatically grab something or jump into a vehicle I now my muscle memory might make me do something that my brain knows is not the right action.

565
00:40:08,313 --> 00:40:11,050
Scott: Yeah, it's usually a good idea to do a lot of those things.

566
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:15,090
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, don't remember those are the primaries the raw muscle memory.

567
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:21,210
Rym: The secondaries are things that I need to be able to do 99% of the time without compromising the primaries.

568
00:40:21,676 --> 00:40:30,430
Rym: so these are things like Swimming like moving up and down or movements that aren't always an option like, you know And how I see I don't know why you have the swim buttons.

569
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,220
Scott: I use jump and duck to swim up and down.

570
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:33,850
Rym: see I did in quake.

571
00:40:34,352 --> 00:40:37,144
Rym: I stopped doing that in half-life for some very small.

572
00:40:37,164 --> 00:40:38,449
Scott: Why would you make extra buttons?

573
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:43,470
Rym: Hardly because a few FPS as I played didn't let you bind multiple things to the same key.

574
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:43,952
Scott: I see.

575
00:40:44,013 --> 00:40:50,090
Scott: actually I think in half-life which is most of what I played recently You know jump is swim up and duck is swim down.

576
00:40:50,552 --> 00:40:54,487
Rym: And also I had I used that for cycling and these other things and not all games did that.

577
00:40:54,688 --> 00:40:58,989
Rym: in games Where I could move up and down with jump and duck I use those instead.

578
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,642
Rym: Aha, and also those were kind of secondary because I didn't need them.

579
00:41:03,244 --> 00:41:10,847
Rym: and then things like changing weapons and Reloading weapons and all those sorts of thank God for the invention of the scroll wheel because it sucked before then.

580
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:20,730
Rym: Yes granted I don't use the scroll real scroll wheel that often because my muscle memory is still to use my Next weapon previous weapon from the way old ass days.

581
00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:27,170
Rym: Ah, I'm all about the scroll wheel But I've started to change and now I use both because the muscle memory will always change with the old way.

582
00:41:27,591 --> 00:41:30,742
Rym: But if I'm thinking I'll use the scroll wheel particularly in half-life games.

583
00:41:30,883 --> 00:41:31,204
Rym: Mm-hmm.

584
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,910
Rym: Then there's the tertiaries.

585
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:40,010
Rym: These are the primary communications like talking team talking the radio messages that I really really really need.

586
00:41:40,451 --> 00:41:46,155
Rym: Things like dropping weapons or buying shit actually drop encounter strike I drop.

587
00:41:46,196 --> 00:41:48,089
Scott: weapon is a really close by button for me.

588
00:41:48,491 --> 00:41:56,037
Rym: See it used to be but not anymore because I'm very economical with my bullets and I will almost never run out of bullets And still be alive.

589
00:41:56,641 --> 00:42:01,230
Scott: if I run out of bullets Yeah, see I would do it to pick up a better weapon not to be because I'm out of bull.

590
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,573
Rym: Oh, yeah But that's the church.

591
00:42:02,613 --> 00:42:10,140
Rym: that's still a tertiary thing as far as I'm concerned because much more prime is being able to move Shoot get out of the way duck and use a door.

592
00:42:10,622 --> 00:42:12,610
Scott: Yeah, but you know, they just aren't so many buttons.

593
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,709
Scott: So putting drop weapon close by isn't too hard.

594
00:42:15,091 --> 00:42:15,231
Rym: now.

595
00:42:15,252 --> 00:42:30,609
Rym: the fourth and fifth tiers like the fourth tier was pretty much all the weird esoteric stuff like building a turret in a game or dropping the the special grenade that you prime or switching to the special weird ass weapon that you don't use all the time.

596
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:31,315
Rym: all that stuff.

597
00:42:32,308 --> 00:42:47,433
Rym: and Beyond that the final tier were non muscle memory not important definitely minor communication things like taunts Gorge, whatever playing music all that bullshit Spray.

598
00:42:47,919 --> 00:42:48,870
Rym: so at the gas spray.

599
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:53,127
Rym: So at this point I'm just I'm gonna just lay out finger by finger exactly how I bind everything.

600
00:42:53,147 --> 00:42:57,724
Rym: if you're near a keyboard I'd say you just put your fingers on the keyboard one by one and I'll warn you.

601
00:42:58,145 --> 00:43:01,109
Rym: It's kind of weird partly because I am is weird.

602
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:13,265
Rym: well partly because I long ago dropped the idea that Just because a key will make me move forward as opposed to back or left or right it should somehow be in front of or left or right of that button.

603
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:23,066
Rym: So right hand on the mouse, obviously Fingers are pretty much one two three on the first button the middle scroll wheel and the third button.

604
00:43:23,487 --> 00:43:29,683
Rym: So one two three index fingers shoot Ring finger is move forward.

605
00:43:29,703 --> 00:43:30,185
Rym: Yes.

606
00:43:30,225 --> 00:43:30,807
Scott: You're fucked up.

607
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:34,159
Rym: Yeah Well, see the thing is that's what doom was by default.

608
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:36,447
Scott: It was but no one does that anymore.

609
00:43:36,608 --> 00:43:37,070
Rym: I still do.

610
00:43:37,441 --> 00:43:44,828
Scott: Yeah There's a reason they don't do that anymore and the middle fingers always resting always on the scroll because that way when you move forward It could mess up your aim.

611
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:58,177
Rym: well also because when I'm moving forward or moving back or whatever I'm doing I can be changing weapons or Changing the state of my weapon because pushing in that button is either the menu or the alternate weapon always Mm-hmm, and that's it.

612
00:43:58,619 --> 00:43:59,805
Rym: If there's other buttons on a mouse.

613
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:00,629
Rym: I refuse to use them.

614
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:08,050
Rym: He said well partly because I need I only touch the mouse with the tip of my thumb The three fingers that are just lightly rest.

615
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:14,902
Scott: like you just decide that you want to do things in some weird way that no one else does them you just and then you Like try to claim that that's the best way in the.

616
00:44:14,962 --> 00:44:16,310
Scott: I'm not saying it's the best way at all.

617
00:44:16,451 --> 00:44:16,653
Scott: Do it.

618
00:44:16,693 --> 00:44:18,063
Scott: you do not do an insane enough.

619
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:21,370
Rym: you do say it often No, it's definitely and clearly not the best way.

620
00:44:21,712 --> 00:44:32,832
Rym: It's the best way for me because as I played over the years I evolved a lot of muscle memory and I'd rather capitalize on all those years of FPS and then throw it away and do something Differently,

621
00:44:32,973 --> 00:44:36,449
Scott: but if you did something differently and built a different muscle memory in the end, that might be better.

622
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:40,770
Rym: I see I don't think it would be because I'm actually pretty badass at FPS and all things considered.

623
00:44:41,373 --> 00:44:47,610
Rym: But the thing is in general the way I use a mouse is unless I'm clicking I'm only touching it with the tip of my tongue in the tip of my picky finger.

624
00:44:48,032 --> 00:44:49,960
Rym: No other part of my hand is ever touching the mouse.

625
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:52,470
Rym: My palm never touches the mouse ever.

626
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:56,019
Scott: Yeah, yeah, that's the way I roll.

627
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,544
Scott: No one else rolls that way.

628
00:44:57,624 --> 00:44:59,230
Scott: So I'm just saying you're weird.

629
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:00,314
Rym: I said that.

630
00:45:00,395 --> 00:45:04,110
Rym: I said I warned everyone very clearly that my setups kind of weird pretty much from the start.

631
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:05,796
Scott: Yeah, I'm just so funny.

632
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,999
Rym: on the keyboard my default primary configuration I have a palm mouse apobia of some sort.

633
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,010
Rym: No, I just the thing is I want to use my fingers.

634
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:18,950
Rym: I don't my wrist doesn't really move when I use a mouse because I'm wrist doesn't move so much either.

635
00:45:19,112 --> 00:45:23,884
Rym: I just use my pinky and my thumb Yeah, and then if I need to click I touch the mouse with those fingers to click.

636
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:28,468
Rym: if I'm in a heated moment Sometimes there's extra pressure from those buttons, but that's just because I get heated.

637
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:31,018
Rym: So pinky fingers on the spacebar to jump.

638
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,490
Rym: ring finger is on the M key to move backwards.

639
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:36,512
Rym: Mm-hmm.

640
00:45:37,195 --> 00:45:40,229
Rym: middle finger is on the comma key to strafe left.

641
00:45:41,191 --> 00:45:44,105
Rym: Index finger is on the period key to strafe right.

642
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:48,349
Rym: thumb Is on the alt key right under there to crouch?

643
00:45:49,170 --> 00:46:01,252
Scott: See I don't use the alt keys or the window keys at all anymore because I've noticed that in a lot of a lot of Windows stuff really likes to pay attention to the alt and windows keys and I used to use them for things and it wouldn't cause A problem.

644
00:46:01,653 --> 00:46:07,270
Scott: but now pushing alt or windows just seems to cause all sorts of problems randomly in different games.

645
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,742
Scott: So I don't use them for anything at all ever no matter what.

646
00:46:09,923 --> 00:46:11,350
Rym: see the way I get around that is one.

647
00:46:11,751 --> 00:46:15,503
Rym: I don't have anything bound to alt anything in windows by default.

648
00:46:15,924 --> 00:46:20,220
Scott: Yeah, it's not that I bind anything to it It's that they just things happen when you push that.

649
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,365
Rym: I've never had anything happen.

650
00:46:21,385 --> 00:46:22,390
Scott: I've had things happen, too.

651
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:23,775
Rym: I don't use the windows key fucking ever.

652
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:25,221
Rym: Yeah on old keyboards.

653
00:46:25,261 --> 00:46:27,490
Rym: I used to get rid of it or disable it somehow physically.

654
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:28,700
Scott: Yeah, but it's nothing you could.

655
00:46:29,225 --> 00:46:32,881
Scott: too many problems I have slipping and hitting it during an FPS and then the start menu opens.

656
00:46:33,263 --> 00:46:35,150
Rym: see honestly, I've never done that.

657
00:46:35,654 --> 00:46:37,409
Rym: I've never accidentally hit the windows key.

658
00:46:37,952 --> 00:46:38,655
Scott: It's happened to me.

659
00:46:39,056 --> 00:46:41,004
Rym: part of it's because I've been using the same setup forever.

660
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:45,670
Rym: like I could play an FPS The keyboard could be hidden from me and I could just play.

661
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:48,857
Rym: But I said, that's my primary setup.

662
00:46:49,218 --> 00:46:51,546
Rym: And also, you know, most games tab shows you the score.

663
00:46:51,566 --> 00:46:56,350
Rym: Yeah for me I always unbind that because I don't want to hit alt tab because I'm holding alt down a lot.

664
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,549
Scott: See that's one of the things I hate.

665
00:46:58,052 --> 00:47:01,390
Rym: So what I did is I bound that to Q instead and tab doesn't do anything.

666
00:47:02,434 --> 00:47:11,757
Rym: That was just something I did long ago because I Got killed many a time hitting alt tab in the heat of checking my score checking my score scene Who's still alive and my team in action quake OMG?

667
00:47:12,259 --> 00:47:14,186
Scott: Yeah, I don't really check the score so much.

668
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:15,190
Rym: So that's it.

669
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,189
Rym: That's the primary keys.

670
00:47:16,339 --> 00:47:20,203
Rym: now When I need to move stuff notice how I have these kind of rings of keys.

671
00:47:20,284 --> 00:47:23,356
Rym: outside of that if I move all my fingers Out in a radius.

672
00:47:23,698 --> 00:47:25,044
Rym: I have this whole other set of keys.

673
00:47:25,346 --> 00:47:27,335
Rym: move them out again And I have another set of keys.

674
00:47:27,737 --> 00:47:36,070
Rym: and that's why I had this kind of primary secondary tertiary idea Because I can move my fingers one set or two sets to kind of change modes and my fingers.

675
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:42,370
Rym: So without further ado B and N I use for various things and is always reload.

676
00:47:42,831 --> 00:47:49,070
Rym: B is always whatever special thing a game needs other than that like bandage in action quake and V is always voice.

677
00:47:49,412 --> 00:47:51,989
Rym: Notice how it's like tears moving out with my pinky finger.

678
00:47:52,612 --> 00:47:53,977
Rym: K is use.

679
00:47:54,258 --> 00:47:57,089
Rym: it has been used for as long as there has been a use in any game ever.

680
00:47:57,671 --> 00:48:03,209
Rym: J and L are either scroll through menus or swim up and down so they kind of rotate around the K key.

681
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:06,917
Rym: Weapon next is always forward slash weapon.

682
00:48:06,998 --> 00:48:09,845
Rym: previous is always apostrophe grenade or whatever.

683
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,470
Rym: weird thing is always semi-colon.

684
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:18,010
Rym: T and Y are always talking team chat UIOP are always radio commands.

685
00:48:19,031 --> 00:48:20,979
Rym: Beyond that it all really depends on the game.

686
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,847
Rym: So I can't really get into further details.

687
00:48:23,148 --> 00:48:26,302
Rym: Yeah Yeah, you know different games have different weird shit.

688
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:27,869
Rym: you got to bind to things for whatever reason.

689
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:32,430
Rym: Yeah, it's why arm the stanza flange fire the stanza flange use the tractor beam.

690
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:41,089
Scott: That's why I basically I set the base keys and then everything else changes game by game and I kind of just get used to It, you know if I change my mind all the time.

691
00:48:41,331 --> 00:48:46,037
Rym: But all the things I stated if the game has that function I always use that key no matter what.

692
00:48:46,518 --> 00:49:01,673
Rym: and part of the reason is I can do a lot of things that need to be done simultaneously Simultaneously, so I kind of move my fingers through different tiers But I can strafe left crouch move forward use and shoot all at the same time if I need to and I've done things like That in some games.

693
00:49:01,834 --> 00:49:05,630
Scott: I can do those things with the default configuration in just about any FPS.

694
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:09,043
Scott: So you don't need a crazy weird keyboard configuration to do that.

695
00:49:09,384 --> 00:49:11,311
Rym: See I don't think it's really that weird It's just.

696
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:13,359
Rym: it's a very systematic approach that I've used.

697
00:49:13,761 --> 00:49:16,129
Scott: Yeah, I think you just you seem to you know.

698
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:27,490
Scott: I don't know if anyone listening to the show has noticed it But living with Rym for a long time He likes to just try to come up with weird solutions that are just way out of the box for a different thing.

699
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:28,333
Rym: I'm really curious.

700
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:30,802
Scott: like what like all sorts of stuff like what.

701
00:49:31,003 --> 00:49:43,476
Rym: I'm really curious because this setup Like I said, it came by default just by chance because that's where I happen to start playing FPSs with the keyboard And then I use that as the core and I kind of came up with a system that I would use for the rest of My life the rest of

702
00:49:43,537 --> 00:49:43,597
Scott: it.

703
00:49:43,637 --> 00:49:44,847
Scott: you do that for a lot of things.

704
00:49:44,907 --> 00:49:45,310
Rym: Wait a minute.

705
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:51,097
Rym: So, how is it weird that if I decide that I'm gonna do something a lot in my life I come up with the system to do it better?

706
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:52,563
Scott: because you're not really.

707
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:56,335
Scott: you don't seem to actually scientifically determine what's better.

708
00:49:56,395 --> 00:50:04,620
Scott: you seem to just do something that makes sense and you do things that you know are not Usually always pick something that isn't done by a lot of people.

709
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,346
Scott: how so like what like?

710
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:09,034
Scott: like arranging furniture You're always right.

711
00:50:09,435 --> 00:50:14,190
Scott: Yeah, you're always just trying to find weird ways to arrange furniture weird ways to organize things.

712
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:15,970
Rym: I'm curious why you say weird.

713
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:25,990
Scott: I mean, I rearranged my bedroom a little while ago and you know, like whenever something is like, you know The the accepted way of doing something you'll always try to figure out a weird way of doing it that no one else does.

714
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,276
Rym: I'm curious why you say weird.

715
00:50:27,396 --> 00:50:30,490
Rym: at most I'd think I try to come over here out of the ordinary.

716
00:50:30,932 --> 00:50:34,249
Rym: How like I name anything out of the ordinary I do.

717
00:50:34,892 --> 00:50:35,734
Rym: I'm really curious.

718
00:50:35,915 --> 00:50:37,840
Rym: pretty much everything like what name.

719
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:40,830
Rym: one thing since you said everything there must be plenty of examples.

720
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:45,583
Scott: Like anytime you're I don't know I'm what you do it all the time.

721
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:49,981
Rym: I just oh I do it all the time You did I do it with everything yet.

722
00:50:50,262 --> 00:50:51,890
Rym: You can't come up with any examples.

723
00:50:52,631 --> 00:50:54,822
Scott: Just cuz I can't remember a specific example.

724
00:50:54,842 --> 00:50:56,309
Scott: and not just making this up.

725
00:50:57,812 --> 00:50:58,637
Rym: I'm really curious.

726
00:50:58,698 --> 00:51:05,170
Scott: All our friends are probably like yeah Yeah, he does and all the people who don't know you were probably like what the hell Scott's got talking about Rym fund him.

727
00:51:05,773 --> 00:51:08,370
Rym: I really don't know though because I really don't see where you're coming from.

728
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,810
Rym: Like you tried to say this before when I rearranged my bedroom.

729
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:11,288
Rym: You know what?

730
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:24,483
Scott: My bedrooms a lot better now than it was before and Emily agrees because she uses this room all the time But it is this is these the way you have your furniture arranged now is a way that no Interior decorator would think to arrange the furniture.

731
00:51:24,503 --> 00:51:25,890
Scott: It is very straight.

732
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,660
Scott: Like you were thinking of doing weird stuff like rotating your desk.

733
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,105
Scott: So it faces into the room.

734
00:51:30,126 --> 00:51:32,736
Rym: a Lot of secretaries and things do that.

735
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:36,698
Rym: that way I could face you while I do the show instead of my back to you Like we do now.

736
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,710
Scott: Are you a secretary?

737
00:51:38,673 --> 00:51:39,590
Rym: Also, it's just that way.

738
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:43,146
Rym: I think I was trying to see if I could fit everything along one wall to save a bunch of space.

739
00:51:43,508 --> 00:51:45,257
Rym: it turned out I Couldn't so instead.

740
00:51:45,277 --> 00:51:47,309
Rym: I just moved everything to the current configuration.

741
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:49,073
Rym: There's the thing.

742
00:51:49,093 --> 00:51:53,110
Rym: I just looked at my room and the original setup and I realized that it's way off topic.

743
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,638
Scott: We should like put this is everything.

744
00:51:54,699 --> 00:51:56,750
Rym: I'll just go real quick because you say this is weird.

745
00:51:57,091 --> 00:52:01,730
Rym: Everything was around the walls and all the space in the middle of the room because it's actually a really big room.

746
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:08,318
Rym: it's the exact same size as the living room - the two closets and The middle of the room really wasn't used.

747
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:09,542
Rym: I don't do stuff in my room.

748
00:52:09,603 --> 00:52:11,490
Rym: So that middle space was just kind of wasted.

749
00:52:11,972 --> 00:52:16,129
Rym: I rearranged my room to use the middle part of the room more and as a result, I fit a lot more shit in here.

750
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:32,130
Scott: So back in the day when I originally figured out, you know and she'll go marble armor division to use the keyboard and the mouse You know, I it the default was like WASD something something and I said already that I didn't like that because I felt that the W should be directly.

751
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:40,090
Scott: You know the up should be directly above the down and I'd been using the arrows for every other game up until then And I wanted to continue using the arrows.

752
00:52:40,571 --> 00:52:52,488
Scott: So I moved it over to the arrows and this wasn't a problem on my old IBM keyboard because next to the arrows There was the numpad and the page down and the end and all that business.

753
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:53,010
Rym: Wait, wait, wait.

754
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,597
Rym: What kind of IBM keyboard is this?

755
00:52:54,657 --> 00:52:56,063
Rym: one of those clackety clackety one?

756
00:52:56,104 --> 00:52:58,981
Scott: I think Alex has it now It wasn't clackety clackety.

757
00:52:59,001 --> 00:53:16,310
Scott: It was like an IBM Something and it was a standard keyboard layout but it had these like four buttons on the right hand side that could be programmed to do anything and It was actually pretty cool because those buttons just worked unlike a lot of the weird buttons on keyboards today.

758
00:53:16,632 --> 00:53:18,241
Scott: And actually Alex do you still have that keyboard?

759
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:19,106
Scott: I kind of want it back.

760
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:19,850
Scott: It's a nice keyboard.

761
00:53:20,252 --> 00:53:21,037
Scott: I don't know what happened to it.

762
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,309
Scott: Anyway, it was a ps2 keyboard also.

763
00:53:24,012 --> 00:53:32,910
Scott: Anyway more recently, you know, basically after PC gaming died for me after RIT You know, I stopped getting these standard PC keyboard layout.

764
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:37,150
Scott: I didn't get the hundred and four key keyboards with the numpad on them and all that jazz.

765
00:53:37,856 --> 00:53:45,880
Scott: I got the happy hacking keyboard which I highly recommend for anyone who uses VI or isn't a cool programmer in any fashion.

766
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:56,995
Scott: and the happy hacking keyboard is special because it has a control where the caps lock should be and it doesn't have a numpad and it's really small and it doesn't have Dedicated F keys.

767
00:53:57,015 --> 00:54:02,238
Scott: you have to hold down the FN button and then push 1 2 3 4 5 to do To do f1 f2 f3 or 4 or 5 etc, etc.

768
00:54:04,553 --> 00:54:12,430
Scott: It's not a normal keyboard But for someone like me who primarily uses the computer with a lot of keyboard shortcuts involving the control button.

769
00:54:12,932 --> 00:54:17,230
Scott: Linux and VI especially the happy hacking keyboard is a godsend.

770
00:54:18,331 --> 00:54:30,450
Scott: Then came a problem when I wanted to play some FPS's again after a long Drought of FPS playing and I only had this happy hacking keyboard in front of me with the arrows.

771
00:54:30,694 --> 00:54:38,298
Scott: It does have arrows But they're small and they're in the bottom right and they're not next to a numpad and you really can't play an FPS with them At all.

772
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:39,830
Rym: Yep See the thing is well.

773
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:41,289
Rym: I kind of like the happy I've can keyboard.

774
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:46,212
Rym: When I saw it and actually I have this problem now and that a lot of modern keyboards kind of move stuff around a little Bit.

775
00:54:46,756 --> 00:54:58,570
Rym: if the keyboard is not exactly Exactly the same at least in terms of the relative distances between things as my original original keyboard that I first played Duman I can't play FPS's at all.

776
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:59,594
Rym: I also box.

777
00:54:59,815 --> 00:55:01,824
Scott: I agreed with that to a large extent.

778
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:03,029
Scott: these logitech keyboards.

779
00:55:03,069 --> 00:55:05,866
Scott: now We're like the delete key is vertical and double-sized.

780
00:55:06,147 --> 00:55:12,050
Scott: Fuck those These keyboards where they like have like this spacebar split into two pieces.

781
00:55:12,331 --> 00:55:17,406
Scott: Fuck those the ergonomic bendy hump keyboards where the keyboard at the entire keyboard is split in half.

782
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,148
Scott: Fuck those.

783
00:55:18,249 --> 00:55:24,786
Scott: also The these new Mac keyboards with like these giant square buttons with huge caverns between them.

784
00:55:25,087 --> 00:55:26,090
Scott: Fuck them as well.

785
00:55:26,732 --> 00:55:35,479
Scott: Only the normal I mean my laptop keyboard I can deal with even though a lot of other people seem to complain the keys are Small but it's basically happy hacking keyboard.

786
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:39,810
Scott: or the layout has to be this the way that it's always been.

787
00:55:40,312 --> 00:55:42,178
Scott: If it's changed too much, I can't deal with it.

788
00:55:42,198 --> 00:55:49,149
Scott: I mean at least especially if it's not a laptop, you know a laptop I can understand to an extent compressing the keyboard, you know to fit on there.

789
00:55:49,572 --> 00:55:51,424
Scott: But other than that with why?

790
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:52,410
Scott: why mess it up?

791
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:59,790
Scott: So anyway, I had this happy hacking keyboard and I want to play an FPS And this is problematic without the arrows and my original setup.

792
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:08,038
Scott: So I basically had to come up with a setup right away and I figured oh, well everyone else uses this wasd business why not?

793
00:56:08,078 --> 00:56:17,103
Scott: it can't be that bad and It hasn't been that bad Despite my you know I guess it was sort of a small bit of OCD and me that didn't want.

794
00:56:17,143 --> 00:56:20,887
Scott: that wanted the W to be directly above the S but really it doesn't matter.

795
00:56:20,908 --> 00:56:28,270
Scott: and When my fingers are over there my pinky now has access to like the shift the control on the tab and that's really useful.

796
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:29,568
Scott: There's a whole bunch of buttons right there.

797
00:56:30,031 --> 00:56:42,750
Scott: I got the Q and the E right there and I've got like the F for the flashlight and the R for the reload And the Z X C or right under and my thumb can be on the spacebar and there's just a whole mess of buttons.

798
00:56:43,351 --> 00:56:50,290
Scott: But in general what I do is I use WASD for forward left forward back straight left straight right R. I'll reload.

799
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:55,810
Scott: I'll use the you know, the caps lock which is actually control on my keyboard.

800
00:56:56,111 --> 00:57:05,510
Scott: I'll either use it for like secondary weapon or in a game like NS I'll use it for like to bring up the menu because use the menu and NS a lot.

801
00:57:06,191 --> 00:57:08,380
Scott: Sometimes I use it for duck depending on the game.

802
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:13,462
Scott: Who knows but I unlike Rym I use a lot of buttons on my mouse on my mouse.

803
00:57:13,602 --> 00:57:14,325
Scott: I got shoot.

804
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:16,977
Scott: I got jump I got duck with my thumb.

805
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:19,870
Scott: I got change weapons with the scroll II wheel.

806
00:57:20,371 --> 00:57:26,050
Scott: I got like push in the scroll II wheel to like toss a weapon away or maybe throw a grenade or something.

807
00:57:26,862 --> 00:57:35,530
Scott: You know I got all kind as much I can fit onto the mouse as possible because The mouse I got a lot of fingers and there's a lot less buttons on the mouse.

808
00:57:35,891 --> 00:57:37,382
Scott: I mean I got the same number of fingers on.

809
00:57:37,422 --> 00:57:38,510
Scott: the mouse is on the keyboard.

810
00:57:39,032 --> 00:57:43,369
Scott: so and the keyboard is a lot of buttons that I can handle with just four or five fingers.

811
00:57:43,389 --> 00:57:54,909
Scott: and If the mouse has three buttons That's pretty inefficient as far as I'm concerned because I could be hitting just as many buttons with one hand is with the other Because the moving has to do with my arm and not with my fingers.

812
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,660
Scott: So, you know, I use pretty.

813
00:57:57,721 --> 00:57:58,727
Scott: I have a logitech mx-1000.

814
00:57:59,311 --> 00:58:02,790
Scott: It has a lot of buttons and I use most of them when FPS.

815
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:10,009
Rym: So, I guess my problem is just that I the only part of my hand that moves at all are my fingers and I need My pinky and my thumb to control the mouse.

816
00:58:10,692 --> 00:58:13,249
Rym: So I really don't have any more fingers to be on the mouse.

817
00:58:13,612 --> 00:58:14,398
Scott: You see I have.

818
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,810
Scott: my whole hand is on the mouse.

819
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,119
Scott: I move the mouse with my arm and not with my wrist.

820
00:58:18,179 --> 00:58:22,939
Scott: my whole arm moves around but it doesn't move much You know because I have such high sensitivity.

821
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,670
Scott: you want to talk about sensitivity or we talked about that before on the show.

822
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:29,010
Rym: I don't know that might be worth a different discussion all together.

823
00:58:29,271 --> 00:58:31,463
Scott: Yeah, I think we have talked about it on the show and briefly before.

824
00:58:31,524 --> 00:58:32,127
Rym: I mean I used to.

825
00:58:32,248 --> 00:58:34,657
Rym: I played High-sensitivity back in the day.

826
00:58:35,018 --> 00:58:38,590
Rym: I shifted to low sensitivity in these realistic games or whenever I was sniping.

827
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:47,770
Rym: In fact, I had a script that when I zoomed in would change the sensitivity in quake - mm-hmm Yeah, but I used to use, you know, no normal default sensitivity.

828
00:58:47,971 --> 00:58:50,807
Scott: Then I went through a time period where I cranked it up all the way.

829
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:56,388
Scott: now I just crank it up most of the way because I think what's happened is just with the way things have progressed.

830
00:58:56,429 --> 00:59:04,592
Scott: cranking it Up all the way is just way too much Especially because you have these accelerators that multiply by each other and the mouse does become Uncontrollable.

831
00:59:04,873 --> 00:59:15,329
Scott: and when I turn everything up in the mouse driver in the game in every possible place It's just you move the mouse like a millimeter and it flies away and you can't move it a small distance at all.

832
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:24,486
Scott: But yeah Because I have high sensitivity and because he's my arm to move the mouse All my fingers on my mouse are able to do things and my mouse has many many buttons which I can.

833
00:59:25,008 --> 00:59:33,586
Scott: I can also bind Those buttons to actual keys on the keyboard which helps a lot in games that don't allow for more than three mouse buttons You know, which is really cool.

834
00:59:34,252 --> 00:59:35,358
Scott: You know cuz you mean mom.

835
00:59:35,398 --> 00:59:37,470
Scott: Lulu my left hand is on the left side of the keyboard.

836
00:59:37,551 --> 00:59:39,689
Scott: So like JKL aren't doing anything.

837
00:59:39,991 --> 00:59:46,819
Scott: So if I put JK and L on my mouse I can trick the game into thinking that you know J do this and it's actually a mouse button.

838
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,486
Scott: when I'm at you know, it's big.

839
00:59:48,506 --> 00:59:49,229
Scott: the game thinks is J.

840
00:59:49,872 --> 00:59:56,134
Rym: so now I gotta say I definitely respect the WASD partly because I mean pretty much Most gamers use it.

841
00:59:56,174 --> 01:00:01,292
Rym: that was like the standard gold standard whatever back in the day and a lot of people still use it to this day.

842
01:00:01,332 --> 01:00:08,406
Rym: the only gripe I had with it was just that I Like a setup where there's only one direction to move my fingers when I need to spread out.

843
01:00:08,828 --> 01:00:15,354
Rym: but in that system I feel like I could go up left down or right and there's always keys in every direction and I felt like that was just Too much to deal with.

844
01:00:15,957 --> 01:00:16,339
Scott: see yes.

845
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:16,560
Scott: Yes.

846
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,710
Scott: The thing is I don't actually spread out so much.

847
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:27,661
Scott: I keep I use as few keys as possible and I only bind keys for the absolutely most essential functions the things that I'm gonna do often.

848
01:00:27,701 --> 01:00:54,985
Scott: if I'm not gonna do something often if it's something I'll Do extremely rarely or only do you know when I'm like sitting still and it's completely safe and there's no danger I just I don't bind a key for it and go in the menu or use the console or I bind it Leave it as the default key and then you know Look up what the key is, you know in the middle of the game and then go and push it with like my one finger On its own, you know, like what's something I don't really need too often.

849
01:00:55,005 --> 01:00:56,129
Scott: I don't know.

850
01:00:57,091 --> 01:01:00,870
Scott: I'm trying to think of a weird games that have weird things like in in tribes, too.

851
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:08,530
Scott: You had that menu where you could like customize your different loadouts, you know I would use like the farthest away button on the keyboard that I would never use to do that.

852
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:11,807
Rym: Yeah, well because once I had the loadout set up I wasn't gonna tweak them in the game.

853
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:14,781
Scott: That's crazy Yep, but you know stuff like that.

854
01:01:14,861 --> 01:01:36,689
Scott: I just use the farthest away button possible I don't you know sort of branch out with my fingers while I'm playing I pretty much only use the pinky on the shift control tab, you know My two two or three fingers for was ad ws ad Qerf and maybe like G and one two three four if I need them and all the buttons on my mouse and space.

855
01:01:36,889 --> 01:01:45,602
Scott: and that's Enough for pretty much every FPS out there except for you know, the crazy old quake mods Which I don't play now when it comes to mouse inversion or not.

856
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,030
Rym: That's a big point of contention between the two of us.

857
01:01:48,091 --> 01:01:48,585
Rym: I mean for me.

858
01:01:49,251 --> 01:02:02,071
Rym: I've always used any time I am ever controlling a first-person view of anything ever no matter what it is It has to be inverted be it a joystick a puck a trackball a mouse a keyboard Whatever.

859
01:02:02,132 --> 01:02:03,436
Scott: just you know rims talking about.

860
01:02:03,496 --> 01:02:09,860
Scott: what he's saying is that when he moves down with his mouse in an FPS The aim actually goes up.

861
01:02:10,202 --> 01:02:17,610
Scott: so to shoot a guy higher up He pulls the mouse towards himself and when he wants to shoot a guy down below he moves the mouse away from himself.

862
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:19,236
Scott: But it's only a vertical inversion.

863
01:02:19,477 --> 01:02:22,610
Scott: So left is left and right is right, but up is down and down is up.

864
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:24,530
Rym: It's the way airplanes and things are flown.

865
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:28,745
Rym: And yeah, I just anytime I'm ever controlling anything in the world from a first-person view.

866
01:02:29,247 --> 01:02:31,901
Rym: if it's not inverted I just cannot deal with it at all.

867
01:02:32,283 --> 01:02:33,390
Rym: I absolutely get fucked.

868
01:02:33,553 --> 01:02:39,428
Rym: There have been games Particularly on some consoles that don't let you change that and I cannot play them period.

869
01:02:39,448 --> 01:03:01,990
Scott: see I do understand that feeling because when I play any sort of flight simulator or any sort of flying vehicle like TIE fighter or descent or I don't know any sort of game that actually like virtual on or any sort of game where there's a Control stick or flying or flying vehicles like I need to have it inverted.

870
01:03:02,171 --> 01:03:12,510
Scott: I need up to make the ship, you know, if I move if I push the stick forward or move the mouse forward I need the ship to crash into the ground and if I pull back I need the ship to take off into the air.

871
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:13,446
Scott: That's how I need it to be.

872
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:21,709
Scott: But in an FPS where I am, you know in I mean even a third-person FPS I could invert and I'd be fine.

873
01:03:22,071 --> 01:03:39,050
Scott: But in a first-person shooter where I am a guy with feet walking around shooting with a gun in front of me I need up to be up and down to be down left to be left and right to be right because The way I play those games in my mind is the goal is to click on the bad guys to kill them.

874
01:03:39,411 --> 01:03:43,889
Scott: So it's like my cursor on my screen and I'm trying to click on the bad guys.

875
01:03:44,332 --> 01:03:59,950
Scott: So the way and I you know Cuz it's basically I think the difference is that in a in a flying game or a vehicle the forward the inversion You're you're sort of It's also the movement of the vehicle that you're controlling as well as the aim.

876
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:08,177
Scott: Whereas in the FPS the mouse is just the aim and because it's just the aim and I'm just clicking on bad guys heads Or trying to click on their heads.

877
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:10,227
Scott: I can't invert or else I get screwed up.

878
01:04:10,348 --> 01:04:14,068
Rym: See for me I still have the feeling that I'm just clicking on their heads and that that's all I'm doing.

879
01:04:14,752 --> 01:04:18,434
Rym: I mean part of it might just be that I Mouse position.

880
01:04:18,474 --> 01:04:24,877
Rym: like the direction I move a mouse is so relative that it doesn't matter what direction I point a mouse Physically or where it is or anything.

881
01:04:25,238 --> 01:04:28,230
Rym: I could play an FPS holding the mouse upside down on the desk and I'd be just fine.

882
01:04:28,391 --> 01:04:37,910
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure that if I you know, it's sort of a muscle memory thing I'm sure I could easily if I set to invert get used to it in a few minutes and then be great after a few hours.

883
01:04:38,051 --> 01:04:40,843
Scott: You know of playing but that's just the way I do it.

884
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,510
Scott: And that's the way I'm comfortable doing it.

885
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:50,654
Scott: I don't think there's actually an advantage or a disadvantage to setting or not setting the inverse vertical on FPS is or any other game.

886
01:04:50,734 --> 01:04:55,026
Rym: I would argue that there is a slight advantage in total for using inversion.

887
01:04:55,427 --> 01:04:56,551
Rym: now the argument would I Mean.

888
01:04:56,693 --> 01:04:58,289
Rym: when I say slight I mean slight.

889
01:04:59,173 --> 01:05:10,517
Rym: My argument is thus if you pick one way and go with it forever Your muscle memory will probably be better than if you switch at midstream as we can see with people who switch between QWERTY and Dvorak Or things like that.

890
01:05:10,537 --> 01:05:17,487
Rym: Mm-hmm All flight sims and vehicle things are gonna be inverted just about and a lot of them.

891
01:05:17,507 --> 01:05:18,390
Rym: don't let you change that.

892
01:05:18,871 --> 01:05:22,643
Rym: But FPS is you can usually pick so on average there are more.

893
01:05:22,663 --> 01:05:32,129
Rym: you will run into an inverted thing Occasionally in your life, but you'll rarely rarely rarely run into a thing that is not inverted that you cannot force to invert.

894
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:33,699
Scott: But see that's just it.

895
01:05:33,739 --> 01:05:34,303
Scott: the thing though.

896
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:38,100
Scott: Is that I Let if I play a flying thing I can up.

897
01:05:38,121 --> 01:05:39,104
Scott: the inversion is great.

898
01:05:39,124 --> 01:05:41,011
Scott: I'm like we inversion, you know It's not.

899
01:05:41,132 --> 01:05:46,810
Scott: if it would that would be true if somehow by not inverting I had to play with things not inverted.

900
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:58,007
Rym: No, but see what I'm saying is to me you I think you could build up a better total muscle memory of Forward is down backward is up in all interactions with any sort of first person or third person thing.

901
01:05:58,669 --> 01:05:59,110
Scott: I don't know.

902
01:05:59,393 --> 01:06:00,205
Scott: It's just like it.

903
01:06:00,751 --> 01:06:05,946
Scott: It's sort of a weird thing where it feels like it's the same amount of muscle memory no matter what.

904
01:06:06,226 --> 01:06:12,429
Scott: but somehow like in tribes too is the best example because in that game you would be FPSing and then you would get into a flying vehicle.

905
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:15,825
Scott: and I had it set up where when I was in a vehicle it was inverted.

906
01:06:15,845 --> 01:06:17,193
Scott: when I was not in a vehicle It wasn't.

907
01:06:17,213 --> 01:06:18,401
Rym: I had it one step further.

908
01:06:18,421 --> 01:06:19,830
Rym: It was inverted all the time.

909
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:21,477
Rym: But when I was running around I used the mouse.

910
01:06:21,738 --> 01:06:23,064
Rym: the moment I jumped into a vehicle.

911
01:06:23,084 --> 01:06:24,350
Rym: I grabbed my joystick.

912
01:06:25,553 --> 01:06:26,619
Rym: That was so hot.

913
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,430
Rym: I was like the best strike fighter pilot.

914
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:31,278
Scott: The only reason I didn't do that is cuz not no joystick.

915
01:06:31,338 --> 01:06:40,230
Scott: and also I really don't like any amount of time in switching Peripherals, you know, that's why I use so many keyboard shortcuts cuz I just hate switching to the mouse.

916
01:06:40,491 --> 01:06:43,590
Scott: I like to stay on one peripheral as long as I can with minimum switching.

917
01:06:43,691 --> 01:06:48,690
Rym: It was worth it to me just to have the almighty power of being able to file Fly that stupid thing.

918
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:58,270
Scott: I would have liked to fly it with a joystick but that one second of putting getting my hands up and putting on the joystick You know and fearing that someone would kill me while I was doing that was just so terrifying.

919
01:06:58,690 --> 01:06:59,439
Rym: I don't know for me.

920
01:06:59,479 --> 01:07:00,410
Rym: I did it in that time.

921
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:11,530
Rym: It took to stand in line and wait and whatever and if someone attacked me when I was in line for a vehicle Line for vehicles I was afraid cuz I was also the guy who would go to the enemy camp.

922
01:07:11,892 --> 01:07:15,570
Scott: See people waiting in line for vehicles and kill the people standing there like idiots.

923
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,352
Scott: Yeah anyway You know.

924
01:07:17,473 --> 01:07:19,078
Scott: and I did it that way and it was weird.

925
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:29,750
Scott: as soon as I got in the vehicle my brain just like flipped Over completely and like if it wasn't inverted I would have had a problem and then as soon as I get out of the ship If it didn't un-invert I would have had a problem.

926
01:07:30,436 --> 01:07:32,050
Rym: See, I just seriously can't deal with that.

927
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:40,541
Rym: I must have too much invested in inverted to where I just cannot in for the life of me And I've tried a couple times on games that wouldn't let me switch.

928
01:07:40,863 --> 01:07:42,210
Rym: I just can't deal with it at all.

929
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:52,006
Scott: It definitely has to do with my eyeballs though Because like if I close my eyes and I don't know if I'm in a vehicle or whatever Then I can do inverted or not equally.

930
01:07:52,066 --> 01:07:52,650
Scott: It doesn't matter.

931
01:07:53,111 --> 01:08:06,629
Scott: But if I'm seeing that I'm FPSing it needs to be not inverted and if I see that I'm flying I need to invert or My eyes see that and they immediately flip my brain in one direction or the other and I can't deal with the opposite direction.

932
01:08:07,152 --> 01:08:12,250
Rym: Now some people might say Rym and Scott how come you didn't talk about joysticks or game pads or game controllers?

933
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,093
Scott: You don't play.

934
01:08:13,153 --> 01:08:24,950
Rym: FPS is with those things and I still to this day and I will argue this fiercely and bitterly Maybe not bitterly because I feel like I'm right and I think Scott agrees with me that I don't care how good an FPS is.

935
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:33,038
Rym: Controlling it with anything that isn't a mouse just feels like this backward Inefficient terrible way of controlling a game.

936
01:08:33,158 --> 01:08:42,229
Scott: Okay, I must say I do think it is Possible to create some sort of new Input device that would be good for FPS.

937
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:52,022
Scott: I agree possibly the wiimote nunchuck combination seems to have a potential not yet fulfilled But a potential some sort of VR thing some sort of VR thing.

938
01:08:52,243 --> 01:08:54,170
Scott: There are many ways you could combine.

939
01:08:54,313 --> 01:09:02,274
Scott: You know Some sort of input device that would be but you know what good as or better than mouse and keyboard dual shock or a game Cube controller.

940
01:09:02,294 --> 01:09:05,050
Rym: I don't care how much you practice.

941
01:09:05,551 --> 01:09:13,618
Rym: I don't think that it has even close to the potential of goodness or control or refined power That a keyboard and mouse combination done.

942
01:09:13,658 --> 01:09:14,622
Scott: and I'll tell you why.

943
01:09:14,702 --> 01:09:16,810
Scott: the reason is to play an FPS.

944
01:09:17,051 --> 01:09:24,968
Scott: You have their discrete inputs like shoot It's either shoot or not shoot and you have sort of these analog non discrete inputs like aim.

945
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:26,377
Scott: Well, where do you aim?

946
01:09:26,417 --> 01:09:27,283
Scott: Do you aim a little bit?

947
01:09:27,304 --> 01:09:27,990
Scott: Do you aim a lot?

948
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:28,754
Scott: do you you know?

949
01:09:28,774 --> 01:09:36,962
Scott: do you aim way up way down a little bit to the left little bit to the right and The main key here is that all the discrete inputs are simple.

950
01:09:37,084 --> 01:09:37,725
Scott: They don't matter.

951
01:09:37,826 --> 01:09:39,149
Scott: your gamepad has buttons.

952
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:40,622
Scott: You push a button it shoots.

953
01:09:40,765 --> 01:09:41,290
Scott: You're all good.

954
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:46,050
Scott: It doesn't really matter as long as your input devices buttons the discrete inputs are handled.

955
01:09:46,491 --> 01:09:51,569
Scott: What's hard is the non discrete inputs the aiming mostly but also the moving.

956
01:09:51,589 --> 01:10:00,790
Scott: and To do better to have a better time to have better performance in a game You need those inputs to be very precise.

957
01:10:01,332 --> 01:10:10,789
Scott: you know if pushing, you know, like for example, if you were to use your keyboard right for Turning left and right in an FPS like in the olden days, right?

958
01:10:11,952 --> 01:10:14,041
Scott: Well, how fast would you turn left and right?

959
01:10:14,101 --> 01:10:16,010
Scott: It would turn left and right at a steady rate.

960
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:19,220
Scott: So you couldn't turn around faster or slower.

961
01:10:19,401 --> 01:10:25,088
Rym: and if you turn if you set it to be faster all the time You can't slow it down if you need more precise turning.

962
01:10:25,269 --> 01:10:29,704
Scott: Yep So a discrete input is not good for a non discrete.

963
01:10:30,266 --> 01:10:35,590
Scott: discrete input Mechanism is not good when you're not putting in a non discrete.

964
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:50,893
Rym: You know what I'm saying and very simply the analog stick on any console controller has nowhere near the sheer amount of possible values and inputs and the sheer just Elegance like a lightsaber of a well calibrated Optical mouse.

965
01:10:51,234 --> 01:11:09,675
Scott: a mouse even a trackball even the wiimote right even though it's not even the wiimote It's not as good as a mouse are so far and above an analog stick in terms of you know being able to point at a spot on the screen or Just precision pointing.

966
01:11:10,056 --> 01:11:10,959
Scott: It doesn't do it.

967
01:11:10,999 --> 01:11:11,962
Scott: That's not what it does.

968
01:11:11,982 --> 01:11:26,051
Scott: I mean if you want to control moving around Yeah, it can do that pretty well because an analog stick is good for moving around in a 3d universe But aiming in a 3d universe it is basically Worthless,

969
01:11:26,352 --> 01:11:26,633
Rym: I mean

970
01:11:27,014 --> 01:11:36,230
Scott: they've come up with ways to make it better, you know playing Halo with an Xbox 360 controller It's probably as good as it is as good as it's gonna get as well.

971
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:39,770
Scott: They figured out just how to calibrate that stick to make it I guess playable.

972
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:40,593
Scott: I don't remember.

973
01:11:40,673 --> 01:11:50,910
Rym: also a lot of those games tend to either use some sort of auto aiming or aim helping or They'll make it easier to target things or precision shooting doesn't matter or things like that.

974
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:56,690
Rym: But even then I can't look around as quickly and naturally in those games as I can with a mouse.

975
01:11:57,132 --> 01:12:01,510
Scott: Yeah, I mean try to turn around as much as I like Metroid Prime, you know.

976
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:04,624
Scott: And I would say it's not actually an FPS even though it kind of is.

977
01:12:04,684 --> 01:12:05,869
Scott: but it's it's not the same.

978
01:12:06,151 --> 01:12:07,697
Rym: It's an FPA or an FPE.

979
01:12:07,717 --> 01:12:08,962
Scott: Yeah, it's something like that.

980
01:12:09,424 --> 01:12:10,990
Scott: You can't really turn around quickly.

981
01:12:11,313 --> 01:12:17,247
Scott: It just doesn't happen now And it's the reason they have a lock on and an auto aim on that game and all the other games like.

982
01:12:17,347 --> 01:12:28,385
Rym: I really look forward to the day where Xbox Live is set up to where I can play Halo whatever on my computer with my Windows Vista against all those kids with Xboxes because I I really

983
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:28,927
Scott: think that

984
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:39,418
Rym: an Above-average player with a keyboard and mouse will cream even an expert player with the best Console setup that isn't a keyboard and mouse.

985
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:49,335
Scott: He'll ever be able to get over any time over the average over time I believe will show that keyboard and mouse players will have a huge advantage because they have the ability to Just turn.

986
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:50,039
Scott: just the ability.

987
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,590
Scott: the fact that they can turn around quickly.

988
01:12:52,032 --> 01:12:55,544
Scott: I mean the fastest thing about how fast you can turn around with the gamepad.

989
01:12:55,585 --> 01:13:01,909
Scott: as fast as the game goes Pushing the analog stick all the way to the right right at the left beckonquake - I had a button I could hit.

990
01:13:01,929 --> 01:13:03,916
Rym: that did A perfect 180 that I used often.

991
01:13:04,237 --> 01:13:12,816
Scott: but with my mouse I can always move the mouse farther I can always pull it faster I can always Do more with the mouse.

992
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:18,850
Scott: with the analog stick the most you can do is push it all the way in one direction And that's the end of the line.

993
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:25,342
Scott: You can't make it go any faster than that and the least you can do with the analog stick is Move it as little as you can.

994
01:13:25,785 --> 01:13:31,435
Scott: with the mouse I can Exactly move it at any Movement of my arm.

995
01:13:31,516 --> 01:13:39,268
Scott: I can like reach all the way across the desk and plus since I control the sensitivity The higher I crank the sensitivity the more I can do.

996
01:13:39,951 --> 01:13:48,990
Scott: Whereas with the analog stick it just you're limited because you can only move it in so many ways And that's that's why a mouse is better than analog stick for FPS.

997
01:13:49,752 --> 01:13:51,579
Rym: I defy anyone to argue against that.

998
01:13:51,819 --> 01:13:52,542
Rym: I'm dead serious.

999
01:13:52,582 --> 01:14:00,250
Rym: We've had this argument with a few people before and Invariably no one has actually defended the position beyond the final argument.

1000
01:14:00,290 --> 01:14:01,073
Rym: They've always given up.

1001
01:14:01,474 --> 01:14:05,449
Scott: my anecdotal experience has been that people who?

1002
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:21,820
Scott: Began FPSing with you know consoles and halo or maybe goldeneye and never really participated in the quake counter-strike FPS golden age days are the people who play with the game pads and You know maybe they don't even know how to use mouse and keyboard.

1003
01:14:22,061 --> 01:14:25,392
Scott: and the people who are mouse and keyboard are People.

1004
01:14:25,552 --> 01:14:32,330
Scott: anyone who's ever done mouse and keyboard and played some FPS is on PCs for real Agrees with us pretty much.

1005
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:38,470
Scott: I've never found anyone who was like a PC FPS or using mouse and keyboard saying that game pads are better.

1006
01:14:39,092 --> 01:14:41,000
Scott: You know no one has ever could.

1007
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:50,030
Scott: I've never seen anyone convert in that direction But I have seen gamepad people convert to the PC direction in terms of what is the better FPS control mechanism.

1008
01:14:50,655 --> 01:14:52,549
Rym: I think that's really all we have to say about this.

1009
01:14:53,335 --> 01:14:54,845
Rym: If you thought this was boring you don't care about.
