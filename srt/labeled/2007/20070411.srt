1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,028
Scott: It's Wednesday April 11th.

2
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:13,552
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,793 --> 00:00:16,360
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:21,719
Scott: Tonight we review the OAV Dominion tank police.

5
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:27,144
Scott: Let's do this Man.

6
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:30,120
Rym: it's always like this ordeal whenever we want to get groceries.

7
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:35,877
Scott: Yeah, we're too used to that Wegmans action and now we got to do with the shitty-ass shop.

8
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:36,720
Scott: right everything sucks.

9
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:47,045
Rym: Yeah, it seems like the stars and the planets aligned today at the specific time But I was trying to check out with my tiny basket with a few tiny things that I wanted to take home and eat because I was rather hungry.

10
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:49,180
Scott: Yeah, I got to the checkout line.

11
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:57,040
Rym: We're about to leave and everything's fine And just as we're walking toward the checkout like a thousand people just kind of all shuffle up.

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,023
Rym: Well, that wasn't the problem.

13
00:00:58,043 --> 00:01:05,519
Scott: The problem was there only two lanes open - they're like 25 lanes in this grocery store And I've never seen more than five open at this time.

14
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,446
Scott: There were two open.

15
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:07,633
Rym: Well, you know what one?

16
00:01:07,654 --> 00:01:11,440
Rym: for some reason It seems like a lot of people suddenly converged on the exit.

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:17,780
Rym: That's sure but I'll - there's no reason for them to keep those open because they know that everyone there is a captive audience.

18
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,339
Rym: They're gonna go to that same shop, right?

19
00:01:19,702 --> 00:01:24,432
Scott: I know I was a kid though The grocery store would have a shit ton of aisles and they would all be open.

20
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:32,585
Scott: and now you go to stores these days like you can go to like stores that were built in the 90s and they have a million checkout aisles and only a few of Them are being used.

21
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:33,511
Rym: You know what old man?

22
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:35,080
Rym: There's no profit in there.

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,871
Rym: There's no reason to have all those aisles open.

24
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,340
Rym: that the stores today make a lot more money.

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,820
Scott: I know it's like you go to a modern store though, and every aisle is open.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,848
Scott: They just have a lot less of them.

27
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:47,173
Scott: Like look at a Best Buy for example Not so many aisles has only like maybe five or six.

28
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:48,480
Rym: The worst is Home Depot.

29
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,569
Rym: There's usually just one that's open.

30
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:53,160
Scott: Well Home Depot has the self-checkout which kind of works.

31
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,095
Rym: No, it doesn't kind of does failed like 80% of the time.

32
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:56,859
Rym: I've tried to use it.

33
00:01:57,863 --> 00:02:05,339
Rym: The problem is you can't use those things with a non-standard item and pretty much everything Store of non-standard items.

34
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:08,573
Scott: It would work in almost any other store like a bookstore.

35
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:10,300
Scott: You can just pile the books on there would work great.

36
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:11,685
Scott: But a Home Depot, it's.

37
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:12,467
Scott: it's not happening.

38
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,916
Rym: Yeah, I wouldn't work at a bookstore because people just steal the books.

39
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:15,980
Scott: That's true.

40
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:22,030
Rym: you know how many people I see just trying to steal stuff when I go to the Grocery store near my work.

41
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:26,896
Rym: Yeah Wow Granted it's a scummy grocery store in Yonkers.

42
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:27,580
Rym: So what do you want?

43
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:34,530
Scott: So anyway, we finally check the hell out and we're all grumpy because you know They didn't have the right tomato sauce, which I told Rym.

44
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,574
Scott: They didn't and I was right.

45
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:36,317
Rym: Yeah, he was right.

46
00:02:36,337 --> 00:02:39,566
Scott: I and We had waited.

47
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:42,760
Scott: we spent more time and waiting in line to check out that we did getting all our groceries.

48
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:53,100
Rym: I think the worst thing was that not one but two separate customers in front of us in line Decided to pay with cash and furthermore they counted out exact change.

49
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:57,160
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is the guy in front of me like it seemed like his dad was with him.

50
00:02:57,281 --> 00:03:04,260
Scott: He was immediate middle-aged guy and his dad was an old Senile old man and he kept yelling at his dad because his dad kept bringing back the wrong cat food.

51
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:05,864
Rym: I don't know.

52
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,060
Rym: I think he was definitely being unfair to the old man.

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,254
Rym: I also but then again the old man might had problems, but you don't.

54
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:13,586
Rym: if the old man has problems You don't yell at him.

55
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:14,692
Scott: Yeah, it was.

56
00:03:14,753 --> 00:03:20,820
Scott: it was one of those situations You know where probably someone has to take care of their parent and the parents not a hundred percent anymore.

57
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,905
Rym: He's probably getting a little bit resentful all that.

58
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:23,327
Rym: Yeah.

59
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:33,080
Rym: Yeah, but yeah in front of me, so yeah, so we went from one Situation that's kind of awkward to another much more awkward situation.

60
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:39,506
Scott: so we go out to the parking lot with the groceries and we start putting them in the hatch and We see some people.

61
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:43,060
Scott: one of them, you know, there are these people at the grocery store who push the carts around.

62
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,400
Rym: Yeah, there's two of them with their little orange vests on.

63
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,840
Scott: Yeah They go and they get the carts and they bring them back to the grocery store from the parking lot.

64
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,449
Rym: Yeah, one guy and one girl and then there's this guy who isn't wearing one of the vests and the three of them are kind Of standing in a little triangle of people.

65
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:07,580
Scott: Yeah, and it seems like the guy who isn't wearing a vest and obviously is not a store employee is Doing something with the girl who is a store employee like she's yelling like get away from me or something.

66
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,420
Scott: And then they're hugging and then she's screaming and walking away and it was kind of weird what was going on?

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,680
Rym: We're like 40 feet away with our groceries at the car.

68
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,240
Rym: So we're standing there watching and we're talking to each other like so we need to call the police.

69
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:23,369
Rym: Let's keep an eye on this and see what happens.

70
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,896
Rym: Yeah, we're like I'd have to intervene here.

71
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:26,365
Scott: Yeah, we're like, hey What's going on?

72
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:27,939
Scott: Are we gonna have to go beat up that guy?

73
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,370
Scott: No, the guy guy who's the guy?

74
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,540
Scott: the other guy in the vest who's standing there not saying anything?

75
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,323
Scott: What's he doing?

76
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:41,460
Rym: the guy who seemed to be the focus of the this issue with the girl looks at us Notices that we're watching and says you guys should mind your own business.

77
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,108
Scott: I think he actually told the guy who the guy with the vest who is standing there Tell those guys to mind their own business.

78
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:50,555
Rym: Yeah, he said that and then he turned and said to us - yes I was like.

79
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,180
Scott: Obviously, there's something he doesn't want us to pay attention to over there.

80
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:59,796
Rym: Yeah, so they keep going on for a while and the girl tries to get away and the guy grabs her.

81
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:01,303
Rym: and finally we're like All right.

82
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:02,491
Rym: I didn't have my cell phone.

83
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:03,740
Rym: So Scott called the police.

84
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:07,720
Scott: I just call the police, you know that they say if you see something say something.

85
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:12,580
Scott: Hey guy, if the guy really is, you know, there's no really bad stuff going on.

86
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,302
Scott: What's gonna happen?

87
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:19,300
Scott: the police will show up and they'll say we were called we showed up and there's nothing illegal happening here.

88
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:22,732
Rym: So Scott just calls the police and he says exactly what's going on.

89
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:24,880
Scott: The 911 guy was smart and cool.

90
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:27,629
Scott: He was easy to talk to go 911 guy.

91
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,211
Rym: Yep.

92
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:33,640
Rym: So we were debating, you know, hey Let's stick around and watch because we're pretty much the catalyst here.

93
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,272
Scott: Well, I asked the 911 guy if I should stay or if I should go home and he's like well Do you want to give a statement to the police?

94
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:40,018
Scott: and I'm like, I'll leave him.

95
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,513
Rym: Yeah, the situation is pretty self-evident.

96
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,177
Rym: I don't want to be involved.

97
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:46,192
Scott: I called the police can sort it out.

98
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,000
Scott: There's a scene in the parking lot, whatever.

99
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:56,429
Rym: Yeah, so as we start to leave because we have the show to do and all that other business and we're talking to each other Well, I wonder how long it'll take the police to get.

100
00:05:56,529 --> 00:06:00,003
Scott: and then sure enough the police were there before we got out of the Parking lot.

101
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:03,703
Rym: In fact the second the third police car See, here's.

102
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:10,940
Rym: here's what makes this interesting because as we're driving out first Scott has to go off this road and we see a cop car go by like right away.

103
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,406
Rym: We're like, alright, it's handled.

104
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:20,200
Scott: and then another cop car goes right away and we're like, okay There's two cops which is which makes sense for a situation that might have be violent.

105
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,247
Rym: Yeah, I mean a lot of places.

106
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:25,460
Rym: if there's domestic violence or anything like that They always send to patrol cars if they can yeah.

107
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,134
Scott: Plus if there's a fight if there's any sort of fight at all is always two people's.

108
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:31,462
Scott: you need two cops one to stop Each person.

109
00:06:31,964 --> 00:06:41,220
Rym: so then Scott's about to leave the parking lot and then he has the green light But he has to stop because the state trooper flies by and by calling the police we'd effectively delayed ourselves another.

110
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:41,903
Scott: I know.

111
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:44,577
Scott: why did a state trooper come to what is a local thing?

112
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:45,280
Scott: It's kind of weird.

113
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,620
Rym: Oh, probably because called 911 as opposed to the local police.

114
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:51,620
Rym: Yeah Which that's starting to be a problem in the u.s.

115
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,460
Rym: Where I often run into situations where I might need to call the local police, but it's not an emergency.

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,332
Rym: I don't need to call 9-1-1 some areas.

117
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,440
Scott: They have the special number.

118
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:03,233
Rym: Well in some areas they say call 9-1-1 for everything.

119
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:10,115
Scott: Uh-huh fact in a lot of areas Where I live but like in New Jersey like where my grandma lives they added another number.

120
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:11,740
Scott: It's like 311 or something like that.

121
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:19,519
Scott: I don't remember, but if it's not an emergency like someone's dying someone's murdered This is a robbery and going on as a violence going on right now.

122
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:23,260
Scott: You call that number and a police just shows up at your door like hey, how's it going?

123
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:32,249
Rym: Yep, or I remember when we were leaving for somewhere and we saw this shady looking contractor guy Basically shoving the clippings.

124
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:34,740
Rym: He had cut off of trees down the sewer.

125
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:38,494
Rym: So I called the local beacon police reported his license plate number.

126
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:39,739
Rym: I don't know what ever happened with that.

127
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:49,299
Rym: Yeah, but so I finally we get back on the road and we're driving home and we start debating Well, I wonder what's gonna happen and we figure no matter what everything's gonna be okay because the police are right there.

128
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:56,680
Rym: So even if the worst-case scenario this guy goes nuts and like does something horrible the police are right there.

129
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,627
Rym: It's gonna get resolved.

130
00:07:57,688 --> 00:08:06,677
Rym: Yep, but then we start wondering You know that guy seemed a little bit Unstable one of those the kind of person who would be involved in a domestic dispute where the police were called.

131
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:20,320
Scott: Anyway, yep And my bet is that if if we had left and just not called the police There was a 50% chance He would do something later didn't look like anything illegal or bad was gonna happen right then but later something probably would have happened.

132
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:28,438
Scott: But by calling the police I think the police might have their presence might have caused that crazy guy to do something.

133
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:36,136
Rym: because the guy It's just like those guys if you watch any of those old Fox shows about people interacting with police when they're on the wrong side of the law.

134
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,059
Rym: and The guy definitely was one of those people who if the police show up, he'd probably fly off the handle.

135
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,842
Rym: So we're debating.

136
00:08:41,863 --> 00:08:46,280
Rym: I wonder if we basically set this guy up to get beat down by the police.

137
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:52,480
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like entrapment in a way Like if the police didn't show up he would have just done his normal thing.

138
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:54,968
Scott: But now there's a policeman staying there.

139
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:59,519
Scott: He goes crazy and because the police are there He does something stupid.

140
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:03,920
Rym: So we decide that even if that happens that's a good thing because that means he was gonna blow up sometime.

141
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,795
Rym: Anyway, now the police are gonna take care of it before he does something bad.

142
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,121
Scott: Yeah, we don't know what happened though Cuz.

143
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:16,000
Rym: however right after we're having this debate Another state trooper goes by like a few minutes later toward the scene.

144
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:17,588
Rym: So I think he could.

145
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:19,839
Scott: he could have been going somewhere else, but I doubt it.

146
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:21,224
Rym: I would my guess.

147
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:24,554
Rym: my bet is that the state trooper went because it was a 9-1-1 call.

148
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:31,320
Rym: the two fish kill police went because Fishkill has more police than it does people And two obviously a dangerous situation.

149
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:39,640
Rym: but the second Significantly later state trooper leads me to believe that the situation escalated and I can't wait to read the local paper.

150
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:52,595
Scott: Yeah, because by the time we saw that final state trooper We had been on the road for a couple minutes and after a couple minutes those cops should have figured out if it was The situation that where they could just say all right everyone don't bother coming here.

151
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:53,720
Scott: Yeah, it's all right.

152
00:09:54,504 --> 00:10:03,240
Rym: We also observed that in the last year or two The two of us specifically me have called the police more times than we have in the rest of our lives combined.

153
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:04,867
Scott: Well, I think I figured out.

154
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:16,891
Scott: the answer to that is because for most of our lives who were in school And when you sit in school all day, you tend not to see a lot of things that require police calling, you know I mean at RIT most things you just call campus safety or whatever.

155
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:20,361
Scott: and in high school if there was any police calling the school Did it.

156
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:26,300
Scott: you didn't really need to call police while you're in school and not too many illegal things happened in our suburban schools.

157
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,088
Scott: Anyway, you know our white bread fools.

158
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:33,420
Rym: So anyway after 10 minutes of that it is anime manga comics day.

159
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:38,666
Rym: Oh, yeah, and I'll be quick on this because I kind of want to spend Talk about this.

160
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:53,097
Rym: Well, we've already talked about this issue that Bandai visual is releasing well co-releasing DVDs in both America and the US and charging Absolutely crazy stupid amounts of money for these DVDs.

161
00:10:53,398 --> 00:11:00,932
Rym: Yep I mean, they're basically charging Americans what they charge the Japanese which I guess kind of works in Japan But that doesn't fly in America.

162
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:07,260
Rym: No one's gonna spend 40 or 50 dollars on a DVD that has one or two episodes of content and no dub.

163
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:14,843
Scott: Well at Sakura Con the anime convention in Seattle a fan of well I guess an anime fan.

164
00:11:14,863 --> 00:11:45,048
Rym: They there was a Bandai visual panel and the CEO of Bandai visual Tatsu nori kono was there and he did his little presentation and then he was about to end that and show a bunch of trailers for upcoming shows and some fan kind of politely interrupted him and basically asked him what the hell they're thinking but in a very polite manner and He seemed kind of taken aback by this and he gave this the most stupid lame Corporate.

165
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:46,480
Scott: Well, what could he possibly say?

166
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,416
Scott: All right, so you're you're the Bandai visual CEO and I say why the fuck is freedom?

167
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,620
Scott: 40 goddamn dollars.

168
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:53,828
Scott: No one's gonna buy it.

169
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:54,755
Scott: What are you thinking?

170
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:55,419
Scott: And what do you say?

171
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:04,819
Rym: Well, what he actually said was something along the lines of anime is becoming more expensive to produce That's true and we're releasing it in two places at once.

172
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:10,160
Scott: They are releasing it here at the same time as they're really seeing it in Japan, which is something no one else is doing.

173
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,980
Rym: Simultaneous release everybody and he didn't really say much more substantial than that.

174
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:24,219
Rym: so a bunch of other fans started agreeing with the person who had brought this up and They never really got an answer out of the guy other than the corporate cheese.

175
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:29,740
Scott: At least now we know that these guys aren't totally oblivious.

176
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:35,860
Scott: They know that there are people in America who say nobody pays that much for a DVD in America.

177
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,394
Scott: The thing is I get the feeling from reading this article.

178
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:40,257
Scott: I mean I wasn't there.

179
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:40,960
Scott: So what do I know?

180
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,680
Rym: There's a recording but it was god-awful and I just couldn't listen.

181
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:52,523
Scott: I couldn't listen to that recording but I get the feeling that it was lost in translation Like they didn't drive the point home like no really, dude You don't understand.

182
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:57,220
Scott: people in America are used to paying $20 for like a whole season of a TV.

183
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,439
Rym: It looks like some nobody's gonna buy this.

184
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,680
Rym: It looks like someone's did say pretty much straight up to him that DVDs in America are a lot cheaper than that.

185
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:05,760
Rym: People aren't going to buy them.

186
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:11,520
Rym: But he just kept saying the same lame answer over and over again as far as I don't think he really like.

187
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,653
Scott: Got a grasp of it sort of like.

188
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:14,276
Scott: well, here's.

189
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:14,860
Rym: here's a quote.

190
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Rym: This is paraphrased in the anime news network article from the audio from him.

191
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:23,254
Rym: So we are thinking that you guys should get the same products as Japan at the same time.

192
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:25,120
Rym: So the price will be the same.

193
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:29,499
Scott: Yeah Good luck with that.

194
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:37,258
Scott: Yeah, anyway yeah, someone should also tell him that he's ripping off the Japanese people and that you're lucky that Japanese people are.

195
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:42,343
Scott: so I Don't know that there are so many Japanese people willing to pay that much money cuz they're crazy I don't know.

196
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:48,656
Rym: Well considering that there has apparently been an ever-increasing problem of re-importation Yeah, I wonder why huh?

197
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,906
Scott: Maybe because it's 40 bucks an episode.

198
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:56,308
Rym: or you can look on the internet and not only get all your fan subs for free If you're that kind of person even in Japan.

199
00:13:56,328 --> 00:14:01,752
Rym: hell if you're in Japan just watch the Ross But buy the American DVD.

200
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:02,999
Rym: it's in Japanese.

201
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:04,774
Scott: Why buy the jet?

202
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:05,540
Scott: the worst part?

203
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:17,539
Scott: Is that these DVDs that they're selling at the simultaneous release that are overpriced don't have dubs Which I really don't mind personally, but shouldn't that mean it's cheaper because you didn't have to dub it?

204
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,514
Scott: Hello, it makes no sense.

205
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:32,634
Scott: I Really wish I spoke Japanese and was there and I could maybe all right anyone who goes to an anime convention this year If there's a bandai visual panel go and confront them.

206
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:33,880
Scott: go and do it.

207
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:38,885
Scott: And if we keep doing it at every single bandai panel at every single con We can really.

208
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:40,591
Scott: maybe we can make a move on this.

209
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:46,340
Scott: Maybe they'll realize that we want the Simultaneous release subtitles only at the right price.

210
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:52,600
Rym: Well, it looks like some reporter for anime news network who was there said quote no one was ever rude to Kono-san.

211
00:14:53,061 --> 00:15:03,660
Rym: However, it was clear from Kono-san's expression and gestures that he was quite surprised by the intensity of feelings toward bandai visuals marketing decisions, huh.

212
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:17,080
Rym: So I get the impression that he might not have really gathered exactly what the beef was or why people were so angry But he obviously realized that for some reason these Americans are really worked up about something.

213
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:23,230
Scott: All right You know what that guy is at the top of the list for people to get like a private Interview with at some con if he's ever there.

214
00:15:23,491 --> 00:15:30,188
Scott: like if we can sit down with him in a translator I think we can get him to realize like oh Take him to the dealer's room.

215
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:30,913
Scott: be like you see that.

216
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,088
Scott: Yeah You're not gonna sell against that.

217
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:34,389
Scott: Yeah.

218
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:34,771
Scott: Sorry.

219
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:38,870
Scott: It doesn't matter how good your show is Even though I'd like it more than every other show here.

220
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:39,895
Scott: Sorry.

221
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:43,935
Scott: It's not that much money All right, so, you know studio four degrees C.

222
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:44,578
Rym: They might do.

223
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:49,277
Scott: indeed They making all the awesome cool a nimes for us to enjoy a nimes.

224
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:50,120
Scott: Yep, a nimes.

225
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:54,297
Scott: They're coming out with something new called genius party.

226
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:58,470
Scott: now Genius party is a very apt name for what they're coming out with.

227
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:02,260
Rym: they're getting awesome directors to make awesome shorts.

228
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:06,214
Scott: basically, they're gonna make another movie that just like the one they made before.

229
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:13,367
Scott: that I forget the name of that is a combination of short movies and The thing is it's a genius party.

230
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:25,428
Scott: everyone who's making these short movies aren't you know, just people who work for studio four degrees C. They are getting the best animators in Japan to make Shorts and then they're gonna combine them all.

231
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:26,753
Scott: this might be better than memories.

232
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:28,078
Scott: I think I don't know.

233
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:32,510
Rym: I really like 1.5 of the memories babe.

234
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,640
Scott: I know that's why it's gonna be better than that credit.

235
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:36,752
Rym: I think I disagree with Dave and Joel a little bit cuz.

236
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:38,260
Rym: I actually really like the last one.

237
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,554
Scott: I like all of them at least a little.

238
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:41,480
Scott: I don't hate any of them.

239
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:42,423
Scott: Obviously.

240
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:44,890
Scott: the magnetic rose is a thousand times better than the other ones.

241
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,173
Scott: Well, of course who did it?

242
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:48,500
Scott: who was responsible for magnetic rose?

243
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,488
Rym: What was his name?

244
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:50,499
Rym: I don't know.

245
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,041
Rym: I don't know.

246
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:55,857
Rym: probably my favorite man in the world other than possibly King Leonidas.

247
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,918
Scott: Okay, so Yes.

248
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:04,382
Scott: So here's some of the geniuses they have working on this genius party writing The.

249
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:07,555
Scott: I'm just gonna say what they do instead of saying their Japanese names whatever.

250
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:17,184
Scott: the animator for Akira The eska flow named Matt cross guy the steam boy tech on King Creek guy the author of the Don Giovanni manga Which I really want to read.

251
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:26,959
Scott: I also want to read that Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and a matrix guy Jojo's the mind game person and the samurai Champloo cowboy bebop guy.

252
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:32,917
Scott: and Of course the samurai champloo cowboy bebop guy whose name is Shinichiro Watanabe.

253
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:39,911
Scott: for anyone who didn't know that He's going to get all his musical friends including a whole bunch of awesome people in yokokana Yes, pretty much.

254
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:47,040
Rym: Scott says, you know He's getting they're getting to do the music and I said yokokano and he sets their name in all the people who aren't yokokano.

255
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:49,536
Rym: And then he says and yokokano.

256
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:50,200
Scott: That's right.

257
00:17:51,080 --> 00:18:00,844
Scott: So this is gonna come out in Japanese theaters Soonish I guess in the summer maybe and I Imagine it'll be in America.

258
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:01,687
Scott: Oh never.

259
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:06,322
Scott: and then there's gonna be a second one possibly in early 2008.

260
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:13,763
Scott: So look forward to this in the torrents because you're not gonna get a DVD not even at $40.

261
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:16,199
Rym: Now one more a little bit before we move on to the things of the day.

262
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:22,560
Rym: But ConnectiCon which is a generally fun anime web comics gaming convention in Hartford, Connecticut.

263
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,911
Scott: We did an episode on it last year when we went for just Saturday.

264
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:28,440
Rym: Yep, but ConnectiCon has one leg up.

265
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,332
Rym: I mean it was a good con.

266
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:29,860
Rym: We had a good time.

267
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:31,639
Rym: We covered it a while ago if you want to hear about that.

268
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:49,017
Rym: But in terms of dealing with cons and talking to cons and doing stuff at cons ConnectiCon has gotten back with me and worked with me more quickly more readily and more Coherently and confidently than just about any convention I've ever dealt with.

269
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:52,379
Rym: good These people are on top of their game this year.

270
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:54,085
Scott: Yeah I mean other conventions.

271
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:54,807
Scott: you go to them.

272
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:58,821
Scott: we went to ConnectiCon in our episode with didn't speak of it in the most glowing Terms.

273
00:18:58,882 --> 00:19:02,137
Rym: it wasn't the best convention ever but it was by no means a bad convention.

274
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:04,619
Scott: No, no, no Great German board game and that's for sure.

275
00:19:05,182 --> 00:19:09,780
Scott: But you know, we go to lots of conventions and some conventions are awesome and some are not so awesome.

276
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:13,249
Scott: But it seems like even the most awesome cons like Otakon.

277
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:20,192
Scott: if you email Otakon or a staff member at Otakon that you need To know something from or you want to ask them a question or tell them something.

278
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:22,140
Scott: They just don't email you back.

279
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:23,728
Rym: Yeah, it's not just Otakon.

280
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:29,417
Rym: I can say this about just about every con I've ever contacted for anything even when I before GeekNights.

281
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:33,831
Scott: other stuff Yeah But this is a note to anyone who ever runs a convention or anything.

282
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:37,527
Scott: check the goddamn email and reply Everything.

283
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:39,560
Scott: if you're not you're doing it wrong.

284
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:47,499
Rym: Yep, so I'm still hashing out the details with the people at ConnectiCon but it looks like Rym and Scott of GeekNights.

285
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,640
Rym: You know the two of us plus probably a few other expert panelists and hopefully a bunch of guests from the con.

286
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:57,839
Rym: We'll be doing a whole holy ton of programming this year.

287
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:13,880
Rym: So if you want to see us live come to ConnectiCon July 13 through 15 2007 at the Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford, Connecticut Connecticut Connecticut Hartford, yes, the only con that actually emails you back regardless of how awesome their convention is.

288
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,374
Rym: I mean, we're gonna be running the stuff.

289
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:27,252
Scott: We always run Is even if this convention falls apart Which I don't know as long as they still have that Convention Center rented on those days We'll still show up and do all the awesome stuff.

290
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:32,917
Rym: if there's the apocalypse of the world We'll be in the crater that remains of the parking lot running challenger on fire.

291
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:33,459
Scott: No, he won't.

292
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,873
Scott: We're gonna be doing the things that we need to do.

293
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:37,140
Scott: when there's an apocalypse of the world.

294
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:40,180
Rym: It'll be a much more literal challenger on fire in that case.

295
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:52,812
Rym: But yeah in addition to the stuff we normally do with cons They're letting us most likely try out a couple of new things that we put together But we haven't actually run at a con or an event ever.

296
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:59,732
Scott: Yes, so to experience the Experimental convention panel event games you should come.

297
00:21:00,053 --> 00:21:02,240
Scott: Yes the first still be the first time ever.

298
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:11,591
Scott: So when we're running this thing like pros at like Otakon 2020, you can say I was there ConnectiCon 2007 when they first ran this thing.

299
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:12,796
Scott: Oh, it was better.

300
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:24,698
Rym: in old days I had an onion on my belt, which was the style of the time understand things of the day.

301
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:37,560
Rym: So I have a slight fascination with hearing foreign people Doing that mocking English accent or that mocking American accent much in the vein of when we do a mocking any other accent.

302
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,119
Rym: Oh, I'm speaking to frown.

303
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,504
Scott: Oh Yeah, it's like.

304
00:21:43,564 --> 00:21:58,740
Scott: I know what it sounds like when an English person tries to make noises in another language like it's sort of weird, but languages have sounds to them like French sounds like these home, but the Italians At least as far as Kramer is concerned.

305
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:00,006
Scott: Yeah, and it's like it's not.

306
00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:02,960
Scott: it's not a stereotype or a racism or anything like that.

307
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,820
Scott: It's like that's really usually but that's really what it sounds like when I hear those kind of people talking.

308
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,562
Rym: Well more it's just.

309
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:13,817
Rym: I love hearing other people making fun of an American accent.

310
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:14,820
Rym: this started with movies.

311
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:22,808
Rym: you should see when one of them was making fun of one of the other ones for saying I think Z instead of Z. and This whole thing is like so what now?

312
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:30,380
Rym: you're gonna have your Z's and then you're gonna drive your car To the store and buy pants and then go on a vacation.

313
00:22:30,962 --> 00:22:32,628
Rym: Yeah to the hospital.

314
00:22:32,648 --> 00:22:40,915
Scott: It's like it was to hear British people We usually speak British English saying English American English.

315
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:42,620
Scott: it was like, whoa, that's hilarious.

316
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:49,405
Scott: So I really just want to hear lots of people who from all around the world Pretending to speak English.

317
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:51,110
Rym: So luckily.

318
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:54,580
Rym: I'm not the only person to have this idea and this is kind of a new thing.

319
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:56,039
Rym: We'll see if there's more responses to it.

320
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:05,100
Rym: But someone posted on YouTube a video where he does a whole bunch of the fake Sounding French and the fake Spanish and the fake Russian and some are pretty good.

321
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:06,925
Scott: Pretty good job with that fake Russian.

322
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:07,626
Scott: Yeah.

323
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:12,258
Rym: Well you say a lot of yet Nesvits dasvid on yachts ski.

324
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:27,840
Rym: Yeah and He's basically calling out the world and saying hey I want you guys to record either yourselves or other people Faking English the way I faked all these languages because I like that sort of thing and he's gotten some responses.

325
00:23:28,661 --> 00:23:29,564
Rym: I'm waiting for some more.

326
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:33,640
Rym: but just follow the whole cluster of YouTube videos here and is generally interesting.

327
00:23:34,222 --> 00:23:43,054
Rym: Also if anyone sends me quality audio of any foreigner as in not a United States native Making fun of United States accents.

328
00:23:43,174 --> 00:23:44,059
Rym: I'll send you a prize.

329
00:23:44,864 --> 00:23:46,070
Scott: What prize II innocent?

330
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,472
Rym: I don't know.

331
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:48,000
Rym: I'll send him something anyway.

332
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:53,440
Scott: So remember I said we were gonna learn the Hari dance because we have to learn all the anime dances.

333
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,764
Rym: Well, we got until Otakon.

334
00:23:54,945 --> 00:23:57,353
Scott: Yeah, how much have you learned of it so far?

335
00:23:57,373 --> 00:24:03,353
Rym: Uh, I Know parts of dances that may or may not have originated in Japan.

336
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:05,240
Scott: We haven't started Jack or shit.

337
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,505
Scott: We don't know even the first step.

338
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,793
Rym: So I have the mirrored video to watch.

339
00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:14,111
Rym: I just haven't watched it Lately, yeah at all more than once.

340
00:24:14,372 --> 00:24:15,877
Rym: Okay to make sure it was actually married.

341
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:19,634
Rym: Yeah I can't deal with that non mirrored crap.

342
00:24:19,695 --> 00:24:20,460
Rym: We played para para.

343
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,320
Scott: If you need to learn a dance, you need a mirrored video or else it is going to just wreck your brain.

344
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:31,058
Rym: Yeah, granted if you learn how to deal with non mirrored video you're probably better off because that's a valuable skill.

345
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,233
Rym: but Modern technology you can just flip the video.

346
00:24:34,454 --> 00:24:40,800
Scott: Yes, so Yeah, we haven't learned that yet, but I'm beginning to give up because we have been bested.

347
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,078
Scott: We have been bested a thousand times by of course the nation of Japan.

348
00:24:45,158 --> 00:24:51,900
Scott: Yes Here is a video for you to watch of a flash mob a bunch of Japanese otaku.

349
00:24:52,041 --> 00:25:03,655
Scott: These people are definitely otaku in the Japanese sense of the word converging on a street suddenly and then doing the Haruhi dance in More unison than you will ever see anywhere else.

350
00:25:03,675 --> 00:25:04,600
Scott: There's a lot of these people.

351
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:05,740
Scott: This is at least a hundred people there.

352
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:14,433
Rym: This flash mob was better produced than probably the best of the best of the best cosplay skit I've ever seen at an American anime con.

353
00:25:15,157 --> 00:25:15,539
Scott: I agree.

354
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:18,247
Scott: and Then something funny happens.

355
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:19,271
Scott: So watch to the end.

356
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:26,359
Scott: Of course if you read the words on the web page I'm linking you to it's gonna be given away But it's pretty funny to actually see it happen.

357
00:25:27,086 --> 00:25:29,464
Scott: I don't want to ruin what happens at the end But I left.

358
00:25:29,906 --> 00:25:36,800
Rym: so the show we were about to talk about tonight is One that is very near and dear to the hearts of everyone who is cool in the world.

359
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:42,660
Scott: Well, anyone who watched anime on the sci-fi channel in the late 90s is all about this show.

360
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:46,399
Scott: Yes, everyone else probably doesn't know about this show at all.

361
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:59,410
Rym: Yes now apparently also Dave and Joel's fast karate for the gentleman reviewed this Before us partly because due to the fact that I hadn't bothered to show Scott the second half of it Back when we planned on doing it.

362
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,820
Rym: We pushed it off for like a month.

363
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,422
Scott: I didn't have.

364
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:04,892
Scott: the DVD was scratched and we watched goes in the shell instead.

365
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:05,313
Rym: Yep.

366
00:26:05,835 --> 00:26:16,520
Scott: Yeah speaking of ghost in the shell Dominion tank police is based on a manga called Dominion by Masamune Shiro, who is the guy who made ghost in the shell.

367
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:23,449
Rym: however, I'm not gonna talk about that tonight mostly because the manga is Effectively completely different from the OA.

368
00:26:23,469 --> 00:26:23,650
Rym: Yes.

369
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,675
Scott: I've ordered the manga.

370
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:25,459
Scott: I've never read it.

371
00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:26,285
Scott: I've ever.

372
00:26:26,406 --> 00:26:33,418
Scott: I do want to point out one thing The manga is originally just called Dominion and in Japan the show was just called Dominion.

373
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:41,388
Scott: Of course in America We call it Dominion tank police because well, that's that's what it is, but I realized something very recently It's Dominion tank police by Masamune.

374
00:26:41,428 --> 00:26:45,239
Scott: Shiro ghost in the shell is really also tank police.

375
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:49,439
Rym: Think about what kinds of things Shiro writes.

376
00:26:49,781 --> 00:26:51,506
Scott: He likes tanks and he likes police.

377
00:26:51,686 --> 00:26:56,099
Scott: Yeah apple seed in a way is also tank or mech police at least.

378
00:26:56,983 --> 00:27:00,899
Rym: No, see, here's the difference between the manga and the anime and then we'll leave it at that.

379
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:03,679
Rym: Dominion tank police the OAV is.

380
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:13,853
Rym: You can be described in two words collateral damage Or all possibly dancing cat girls Cat girl damage.

381
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:21,400
Rym: Yeah Meanwhile dancing collateral perspective The tanks in Dominion tank police.

382
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:29,980
Scott: I just I just can't get the picture out of my head of a guy like signing over his car is collateral and he's dancing dancing car anyway.

383
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:37,278
Rym: Okay The manga is in a way more coherent serious together and plot II than the anime.

384
00:27:37,338 --> 00:27:43,640
Rym: to put it Lightly, I would almost go so far as to say that the two are almost completely unrelated except in name.

385
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:48,620
Scott: It's one of those things where sort of like the Akira manga goes into incredible detail.

386
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:54,479
Scott: There's a billion characters and there's a whole world and a whole big story and the Akira movie is just part of it.

387
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:12,700
Rym: Well, I think what the one big thing is that in the manga the tank police and what they do and the tanks they use Make sense, they would probably at least nominally Actually function in the way there to intended the tanks in the OAV Dominion tank police.

388
00:28:13,101 --> 00:28:15,508
Rym: Well, I'm just gonna play something.

389
00:28:15,648 --> 00:28:21,504
Rym: that is basically a conversation between the chief of the tank police and the mayor of Newport City Where tank police takes place.

390
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:27,776
Rym: and if you don't have an idea of what this show is about after this then There's no hope.

391
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:35,300
Rym: Why in hell does our police department have to carry enough firepower to wipe out the city's population five times over?

392
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:39,639
Rym: The police are here to protect the people's rights and property not to threaten them.

393
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:47,124
Rym: When innocent lives are sacrificed in the name of crime prevention the police are no better than the hoodlums They're fighting against.

394
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:48,127
Rym: madam mayor.

395
00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:51,980
Rym: You should have said that to the council years ago when they set up the tank police.

396
00:28:52,520 --> 00:29:01,744
Rym: It's worth remembering that the percentage of civilians killed or injured and tank related incidents is a mere 5% of incidents related to traffic Accidents or bacterial poisoning.

397
00:29:02,065 --> 00:29:05,795
Rym: what's more the crime rate is dropped 20% since we started using tanks.

398
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:10,730
Rym: I think the police should be commended 5% and you're proud of that.

399
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:13,360
Rym: that kind of attitude could cost us our jobs.

400
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:17,999
Rym: I don't think you've had any idea how easily the voters could kick us right out of office.

401
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:22,456
Rym: I know that the voters are happy to see muggers and rapists get their asses shut off.

402
00:29:22,817 --> 00:29:23,500
Rym: make up your mind.

403
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:28,120
Rym: Do you want to give in to a few fairy pinkos or keep little old ladies safe on the streets?

404
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,859
Rym: You have a duty to everyone and that includes rapists murderers and fairy pinkos.

405
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:36,329
Rym: Don't give me the same crap you feed the press.

406
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,160
Rym: the thing you really care about is getting reelected.

407
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:42,219
Rym: You can't cut out cancer without spilling a little blood.

408
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:48,480
Rym: Would you tell a surgeon to go ahead and operate and then order him to stop while the patient or in our case the city?

409
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,178
Rym: die slowly and painfully of the tumor taking over its guts?

410
00:29:52,198 --> 00:29:55,888
Rym: I Am not ordering the surgery to stop.

411
00:29:56,249 --> 00:29:58,960
Rym: sure you are you can't take the heat in the kitchen.

412
00:30:00,522 --> 00:30:06,259
Rym: I'm simply ordering you to stop doing the operation with a black chainsaw chainsaw.

413
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,443
Rym: a Surgeon operates with a scalper which he takes good care to sterilize to prevent unnecessary infection.

414
00:30:11,866 --> 00:30:14,238
Rym: if he uses a tank the patient tends to die.

415
00:30:14,258 --> 00:30:16,382
Rym: I Resent that.

416
00:30:17,104 --> 00:30:20,976
Rym: it was you politicians who gave us surgeons those tanks in the first place.

417
00:30:21,397 --> 00:30:24,419
Rym: besides these days tanks are about as effective as toothpicks.

418
00:30:25,273 --> 00:30:33,060
Rym: Thanks Well, if tanks are no better than toothpicks, what would you consider is appropriate equipment for the police to use in prevention car?

419
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,700
Rym: I'm glad you asked me that I wouldn't mind replacing our guns with tactical nuclear weapons.

420
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,017
Rym: Nuclear weapons.

421
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,586
Rym: Nuclear weapons can stop war.

422
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:48,977
Rym: if they have done they should be able to stop criminals though.

423
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:49,759
Rym: I'm a pessimist.

424
00:30:50,101 --> 00:30:52,660
Rym: I don't think we'll ever get rid of crime completely.

425
00:30:53,682 --> 00:30:56,960
Rym: See you cannot be serious deadly serious.

426
00:30:57,241 --> 00:31:01,160
Rym: There was people like you who gave us the tanks and told us to fight the bad guys.

427
00:31:01,881 --> 00:31:08,119
Rym: I can argue about whether the law that set us up was a good one or not But the law is the law and now we're here.

428
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:19,340
Rym: We're right at the sharp end of the fight against crime And if you want law and order I've only got one thing to say if you want us to sap them give us more tanks.

429
00:31:20,483 --> 00:31:21,699
Rym: Don't you understand?

430
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:25,839
Rym: This is war and my tank police are at the front line.

431
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:50,614
Rym: For you see the only way to stop crime or at least to prevent crime from getting worse is to have tanks bigger than Buildings destroying the city every time anything happened.

432
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:52,940
Scott: Oh, then why do we call the regular police just now?

433
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,726
Scott: That was pretty dumb.

434
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:55,079
Scott: We should have been calling the tanks.

435
00:31:55,924 --> 00:31:59,279
Rym: See I get the impression that no one actually wants to call the tank police.

436
00:32:00,062 --> 00:32:14,520
Scott: Well judging by the fact that what there's a crime and a super emergency in the city every 36 seconds or whatever and The tank police spend most of the day sitting around and when they actually roll out It's this huge event that basically just guaranteed to destroy a building

437
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:19,440
Rym: Well, the idea they actually talk about in the show is that the tank police don't exist to actually do anything.

438
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:23,957
Rym: They exist solely as a deterrent to hope that crime doesn't go to one every 35 seconds.

439
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:27,050
Rym: In fact, they say that pretty much straight up.

440
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:27,733
Scott: No, they do.

441
00:32:27,753 --> 00:32:29,259
Scott: they say exactly that in the show.

442
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:34,933
Rym: Yes but before we continued tank police is actually directed by two people.

443
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:52,560
Rym: because you see first there were the OAVs which Theoretically, there are four different episodes but each set of two episodes is basically just a movie and all of them together come on one DVD and Most people when they say tank police they mean these two things or these four episodes all mashed together.

444
00:32:52,741 --> 00:32:58,440
Rym: But the first half was directed by my man one of my favorite directors Koichi Mashimo.

445
00:32:58,924 --> 00:33:14,220
Rym: Mashimo Mashimo Who you might remember from such classic says well, maybe I shouldn't say classics because noir and doc head dot hack We're not good, but he also did dirty pair project Eden and one of my favorite shows ever irresponsible captain Tyler.

446
00:33:14,621 --> 00:33:19,860
Rym: Yeah, it's Rym show right there and I gotta say I do like the first half of Dominion tank police a lot more.

447
00:33:19,982 --> 00:33:28,300
Rym: It's much more Silly humor tanks blowing stuff up and a lot of little subtle jokes in the background and all that sort of fun stuff.

448
00:33:28,864 --> 00:33:35,599
Scott: Yeah, the first half definitely is better I think mostly because it concentrates more on the tank police than the second half.

449
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:45,520
Scott: does I mean you watch the first half of the second half and The tank police are barely in it and when they are in it some of its reused footage from the first movie?

450
00:33:45,821 --> 00:33:47,666
Scott: Well first two episodes of the OAV.

451
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:49,091
Scott: So yeah.

452
00:33:49,673 --> 00:33:59,340
Scott: Anyway, the second half was directed by another guy Takaki Ishiyama who is basically looking at his resume and I'm gonna go down the list cuz that's just why waste your time.

453
00:34:00,062 --> 00:34:01,906
Scott: He's basically the storyboard master.

454
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:04,512
Scott: He did storyboards on a lot of things.

455
00:34:04,572 --> 00:34:07,519
Scott: You've heard of pretty much all sorts of awesome shit.

456
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:12,819
Scott: But he directed one very important thing that some other people don't like.

457
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,591
Scott: that I do like and that thing is kitchen core.

458
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,333
Rym: to this day.

459
00:34:17,393 --> 00:34:19,138
Rym: I still haven't actually watched kitchen core.

460
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,172
Scott: really Kitchen core is a short OAV.

461
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:29,842
Scott: It's a few episodes of steampunk Nazi alien robot action and I Quite enjoy it.

462
00:34:29,882 --> 00:34:35,040
Scott: It's not the best thing ever, but it's pretty awesome and it's worth your time, especially since it's so goddamn cheap.

463
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:42,998
Rym: It's called Geo armor that in the America But it's kitchen core now despite the fact that Dominion tank police was made in the late 80s.

464
00:34:44,402 --> 00:34:45,185
Scott: Wow, that's old.

465
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:48,260
Scott: Yeah, it looks really good than ten years old when they made this.

466
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,856
Rym: It looks really good comparatively as I mean even compared to modern stuff.

467
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:52,719
Rym: I think it holds its own.

468
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:59,298
Rym: It definitely has an older style in some ways But it doesn't show its age as much as a lot of other shows that came out in the late 80s.

469
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,360
Scott: Oh, no, it has the sort of like faded coloring of old animation technology.

470
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:10,980
Scott: But it has the decent enough, you know, the good drawings everything smooth.

471
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,560
Scott: There's not a lot of like glitches in the animation or any and no one is drawn stupidly or anything.

472
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:20,687
Scott: The character designs are pretty nice You know, it really it won't strike you.

473
00:35:21,028 --> 00:35:24,559
Scott: you'll see it and you'll say wow, that's old but you won't.

474
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:24,980
Scott: it doesn't.

475
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:29,620
Scott: It doesn't have an older style has the modern anime style that is not irritating.

476
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:44,192
Rym: Well, actually I really really like the character designs I think that each character is distinct in a good old-school kind of way and while Pretty much every character in the show is in some way or another a straight-up Stereotype or pretty much all of them.

477
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:45,840
Rym: This guy is the angry chief.

478
00:35:46,221 --> 00:35:49,352
Rym: This guy is the chaplain who likes hand grenades.

479
00:35:49,392 --> 00:35:51,820
Scott: This guy is the badass commander.

480
00:35:52,181 --> 00:35:57,600
Scott: This guy is the the dopey comic bad guy, but not really the bad guy.

481
00:35:57,941 --> 00:36:00,214
Scott: This guy is the evil bad guy with no motive.

482
00:36:00,255 --> 00:36:01,099
Scott: He's just evil.

483
00:36:02,273 --> 00:36:02,480
Scott: Yeah

484
00:36:03,343 --> 00:36:31,189
Rym: but the plot of Dominion Tank Police is actually fairly simple because while there is this kind of overarching plot over the four episodes and They always keep hinting at the setting and the background and sinister things to come and all this business While that's addressed in the manga in the show It's basically just background especially for the first two episodes Which are pretty much just the story of this gang of criminals is up to criminal mischief Stealing urine from a hospital.

485
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,979
Rym: Yeah, and the tank police are called in.

486
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:40,060
Rym: actually There's a great scene Where they bust in and the normal police show up and the normal police just marching with guns like that.

487
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:48,118
Rym: We're gonna stop them and the cat girl takes one look at him fires off a couple of rounds and the police Immediately run away and then the tank police.

488
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:52,880
Scott: Wow Maybe they wouldn't need tank police if the regular police didn't suck and weren't complete wusses.

489
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:58,080
Rym: See, I have a feeling that the regular police are just fine as long as it's not cat girls wielding machine guns.

490
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:00,047
Scott: Hey, you know we had.

491
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:02,200
Scott: we don't have tank police in the modern world today.

492
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,155
Scott: And if there's you know badasses with machine guns, they call the SWAT team.

493
00:37:06,175 --> 00:37:07,420
Scott: They don't call the tank police.

494
00:37:07,943 --> 00:37:10,160
Scott: You'll never see tanks go in to stop a bank robbery.

495
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,540
Rym: Well, I think part of that is that this is a comedy and it's not supposed to be serious at all.

496
00:37:14,741 --> 00:37:15,365
Scott: I don't know.

497
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:22,500
Rym: the second half gets way Serious, and if you are just looking for humor the second half is worth watching.

498
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:33,248
Rym: But it's very much different from the first half in that it kind of ties together a lot of these background Plot elements that were brought in in the first half but not really actually explained.

499
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:49,084
Rym: they like they keep touching on this whole idea about a bacterial cloud and people who are perfectly healthy and this project designed to study human souls or to create a being that could somehow get rid of the bacterial cloud or live within the Bacterial cloud.

500
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:53,260
Rym: and there's this whole deep setting the kind of setting that Shiro just seems to love.

501
00:37:53,782 --> 00:38:03,417
Rym: But it's really all just background because the actual story here Is that the Dominion tank police are a group of ruffians and thugs who are barely better than the criminals.

502
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:06,668
Rym: They're fighting That in one scene in the second half.

503
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:14,580
Rym: there there's an emergency call at Sotheby's Which is full of billions and billions of dollars of priceless art artifacts and heirlooms.

504
00:38:15,702 --> 00:38:20,060
Rym: The only way he can really convince the tank police to go respond because they don't even want to respond.

505
00:38:20,362 --> 00:38:23,239
Rym: They want to just sit around and continue interrogating suspects.

506
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:32,620
Rym: Interrogation by the way generally involves hanging upside down with a grenade in their mouths and Throwing knives at them until they confess to whatever crimes they're looking to get confessions for that day.

507
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:40,495
Scott: The interrogation parts is like this sort of this ongoing joke if you can consider it something in an OAV Ongoing and that it happens two times.

508
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:46,520
Rym: Yes It's hilarious the first time and it's even more hilarious the second time.

509
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:55,439
Scott: Yes If they had kept going with this I would have been very interested to see how they would take the interrogation scenes a step up Because I don't really think it could go anywhere else.

510
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,747
Rym: Yeah I mean even in the first one.

511
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,520
Rym: they get a little elaborate with these grenades.

512
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:07,380
Rym: Speaking scientifically the bucket falls over when it's hit by a ball The string is pulled tight pulling the pin out of the grenade stuffed in the suspects mouth, which leads to certain results.

513
00:39:12,952 --> 00:39:23,196
Rym: But the only way he could they convinced the tank police to actually respond to a call for help is to point out that the place they're going to help is full of Priceless artifacts

514
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:27,530
Scott: and the tank police seem to get off on the idea that they're going to destroy all these priceless.

515
00:39:28,152 --> 00:39:33,030
Rym: Not only that but half of them seemed more interested in looting the museum than actually fighting any crime.

516
00:39:33,852 --> 00:39:45,890
Rym: The best part is they show up and there's some sort of firefight going on inside and instead of responding They just have a ring of tanks around the museum and they're cheering and yelling and eating rice and ramen and having a party.

517
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:53,310
Scott: Yeah, the tank police is sort of like these group of guys who are just really awesome and they have this great camaraderie.

518
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,349
Scott: There's not a lot of infighting except with the chief.

519
00:39:55,731 --> 00:39:56,112
Scott: In fact,

520
00:39:56,273 --> 00:40:11,390
Rym: I would go so far as to say that the way they all are together is kind of like here is Greenwood in that It's this adversarial but at the same time Almost Spartan Brotherhood of friends, you know like the group of gay the gang of kids who gets into mischief together.

521
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:13,499
Scott: Yeah, it's like they're all like.

522
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:15,189
Scott: yeah, let's all go screw shit up.

523
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:16,671
Rym: Yeah,

524
00:40:16,852 --> 00:40:17,433
Scott: yeah,

525
00:40:17,694 --> 00:40:31,678
Rym: I love when they actually get a call because they all the tanks have those dit-dit-dit-dit-dah kind of horns, huh, and Basically, the whole crew comes down and yeah, let's go And the tanks tear out into the street

526
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,790
Scott: also tear the street tearing up the street apart into bits.

527
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:39,762
Rym: They pretty much destroy the city if they're ever actually deployed for anything.

528
00:40:39,783 --> 00:40:42,030
Scott: I think that's sort of the point.

529
00:40:42,891 --> 00:40:45,820
Rym: Yes, the thing is there's been a lot of shows in the past that try to pull this.

530
00:40:46,462 --> 00:40:48,930
Rym: oh no collateral damage over the top.

531
00:40:49,372 --> 00:40:52,290
Rym: Oh, look, they blew up the building and now the Chiefs yelling at him.

532
00:40:52,812 --> 00:41:12,430
Rym: But I think there's this level of campiness and this kind of tongue-in-cheek Way of going about that that makes tank police a lot more charming and in the end actually funny as opposed to a lot of shows like that that just come off stupid and A lot of the humor are Little things people say are little background thing.

533
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:16,502
Rym: Like there's one scene where one of the main characters who happens to be a Goyle.

534
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:18,929
Scott: So what can the tank police do for you?

535
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:33,045
Rym: Sir officer Leonio Zaki transferred to the tank police from the city motorcycle headquarters unit Who has been transferred to the tank police.

536
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:37,561
Rym: she ends up getting Really Really attached to her tank.

537
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:52,304
Scott: you see yeah you watch a lot of shows these days and like Pat LeBour has the girl who really likes a robot and You'll all you'll see like these girl characters who are really attached to something like a pet or something And this one was the first one that I ever saw that had that.

538
00:41:52,384 --> 00:42:02,497
Scott: so anytime a show came Afterwards at least in terms of the order in which I saw them where there was a main girl character who's really attached to something I was like, oh they're copying tank police.

539
00:42:02,738 --> 00:42:02,939
Rym: Yep.

540
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:03,601
Rym: Plus.

541
00:42:03,641 --> 00:42:04,725
Rym: I mean all the people.

542
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,230
Rym: all the tank police are like that.

543
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:12,652
Rym: I mean the one captain Britain who all I'll really say that he's exactly Exactly.

544
00:42:12,732 --> 00:42:13,575
Rym: He looks like him.

545
00:42:13,796 --> 00:42:14,658
Rym: He sounds like him.

546
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:15,702
Rym: He acts like him.

547
00:42:16,384 --> 00:42:18,170
Rym: He's just like my high school band teacher.

548
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,856
Scott: Well, go kick is people listening?

549
00:42:19,876 --> 00:42:28,730
Rym: know your high school, but I'm just saying my high school band teacher was exactly like this guy The kind of guy who sits there reading a magazine obviously a periodical.

550
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:33,710
Scott: That's the kind of funny joke you see in tank police is there'll be a guy sitting there reading a magazine.

551
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:41,829
Rym: The magazine is titled how to kill and he is reading it very seriously and obviously is taking pointers from it.

552
00:42:43,151 --> 00:42:46,422
Rym: He threatens to shoot people's asses off a lot at least in the dumb.

553
00:42:46,623 --> 00:42:48,730
Scott: Yeah, I think that's just the way it's translated.

554
00:42:48,811 --> 00:42:50,490
Scott: I don't know what he's actually saying.

555
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:55,209
Rym: Well, we'll talk about the dub and the sub and all that in a bit because there were actually a lot of changes.

556
00:42:56,431 --> 00:42:58,621
Rym: But the girl gets really attached to her tank

557
00:42:59,103 --> 00:42:59,766
Scott: and there's

558
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:06,186
Rym: one little scene where Somehow a grenade goes off in the hangar where all the tanks are somehow

559
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:13,021
Scott: somehow gee I never thought that would happen where there's you know A hangar full of tanks and troublemakers and all sorts of grenades

560
00:43:13,502 --> 00:43:16,310
Rym: and then one of them goes off and it scratches her tank.

561
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:21,090
Rym: So she's runs over and she's freaking out about it and she steps on some guy who was knocked out by the blast.

562
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:24,870
Rym: So there's this whole scene where she's yelling about the tank and all this stuff's going on.

563
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:33,150
Rym: But in the background the guy she stepped on like gets up and he's like, ah And then she spins around and hits him again by accident and he falls down.

564
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:33,714
Rym: It's like ah.

565
00:43:34,157 --> 00:43:36,010
Rym: and then she kicks him and then he gets up.

566
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:45,808
Rym: He's like, yeah, and he goes to like punch her or something and she accidentally knocks him out again and eventually he's just standing there behind her with a gun and he's about to kill her.

567
00:43:45,828 --> 00:43:50,023
Rym: and There's a lot a little background humor like that in this whole show.

568
00:43:50,044 --> 00:44:00,276
Scott: Well, I think around that time There's a funny joke where she's about to shoot someone and kill them for real and the Jesus II guy comes up and he's like Wait a second.

569
00:44:00,658 --> 00:44:03,490
Scott: What's more valuable a tank or a human life?

570
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:12,554
Scott: And she's like a tank and it's the Jesus guys you expect him to be like, huh freak out, but he says oh Thank you.

571
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,310
Scott: She's finally become a true member of the tank police.

572
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:21,510
Scott: The Jesus guy is so great because usually a Jesus character is annoying because they're all preaching their Jesus.

573
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:29,470
Scott: He crap all over everybody, but this guy He preaches the Jesus II stuff, but he's really just like all the other tank police.

574
00:44:29,931 --> 00:44:31,818
Rym: I believe a relevant quote is in order.

575
00:44:32,259 --> 00:44:47,772
Rym: pay heed to the words of my brother for it is better to name thy Accomplices and have them with thee in prison than to die by grenade now in the manga as far as I remember There's a lot more because there's also a sciency guy on the tank police and he's the one who basically explains to all the idiots What's going on?

576
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:48,154
Rym: Yes.

577
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:50,060
Scott: He's a stereotypical nerd character.

578
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:53,695
Rym: Yeah, kind of like Egon from the real Ghostbusters or Professor Frank.

579
00:44:54,018 --> 00:44:54,259
Rym: Yeah.

580
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,101
Rym: Yeah pretty much and He's an atheist and pretty much.

581
00:44:58,181 --> 00:45:03,489
Rym: him and the chaplain are obviously friends But they they like to dig at each other just a little bit.

582
00:45:06,354 --> 00:45:11,767
Rym: I don't think that really comes out in the show But you can see how there would be a lot of humor potential there.

583
00:45:12,169 --> 00:45:17,270
Rym: now You might notice we've been fairly vague as to what actually happens in tank police other than a few choice bitch.

584
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,235
Scott: Oh, you don't want to spoil it.

585
00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:19,120
Scott: We want people to watch it.

586
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,950
Rym: Yeah, the thing is it's not like a TV show.

587
00:45:21,332 --> 00:45:22,780
Rym: It's a four episode OAV.

588
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,027
Scott: Those are kind of long though.

589
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:29,545
Rym: Yeah, they are but if we talked about what happens any more than what we've already done.

590
00:45:29,866 --> 00:45:30,809
Rym: We'd ruin a lot.

591
00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:43,530
Rym: there's there's a moment late at late in the first half where an obstacle is placed before the tank police and is perhaps the Greatest obstacle ever presented to anyone in the history of anime.

592
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:49,476
Scott: Well, here's the thing is I own I didn't realize that obstacle was in the show when I saw it on the sci-fi channel Because it was cut out.

593
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:51,850
Scott: a lot of the show was cut out for America.

594
00:45:51,970 --> 00:46:02,850
Scott: In fact the American dub version of this show Especially the one that was shown on sci-fi channel is so different from the original yet somehow it didn't actually ruin it.

595
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:03,687
Scott: It's sort of weird.

596
00:46:04,271 --> 00:46:14,339
Scott: Usually when someone edits a show for release in America and cuts out a lot of things or dubs it poorly or Changes music or anything like that Inevitably makes the show worse.

597
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:26,314
Scott: example initial D. Ah Yes This seems to be what a weird case where they must have been trying really hard because the American release of tank police changed a lot Of stuff yet.

598
00:46:26,334 --> 00:46:28,360
Scott: It was different but still good.

599
00:46:28,762 --> 00:46:30,808
Rym: There are basically three cuts of this out there.

600
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:34,881
Rym: first There's the Japanese version which is uncut Japanese whatever.

601
00:46:34,981 --> 00:46:36,205
Rym: it's exactly what they made.

602
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:42,643
Rym: then there's the American dub Which I stand by as being really really good and really really funny.

603
00:46:42,664 --> 00:46:45,713
Scott: I think I'm not saying it's a bad dub It's a good dub.

604
00:46:45,893 --> 00:46:47,237
Scott: It is also humorous.

605
00:46:47,659 --> 00:46:51,230
Scott: However, I think rims opinion of it is boosted by nostalgia.

606
00:46:51,350 --> 00:47:02,289
Rym: See, I doubt that highly because I saw tank police right around when I saw a whole bunch of other anime And I saw the dubs of all those two and all those dubs are piss-poor, but did you like those shows?

607
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:03,413
Scott: Yes I love them.

608
00:47:03,433 --> 00:47:07,590
Rym: vampire hunter D is awesome to me and I really love that movie.

609
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:10,830
Rym: However, the dub was pretty piss-poor.

610
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:15,890
Scott: Well, the dub of tank police is good, but I'm not saying it's as great as as you seem to think it is.

611
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:16,735
Rym: I think it's really good.

612
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:21,433
Rym: I'd say it's in the top 10% of dubs ever made Name.

613
00:47:21,514 --> 00:47:24,190
Rym: good dubs other than cowboy bebop and hell sing.

614
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:28,880
Rym: I Got to think of any tank police is really well done.

615
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,930
Rym: the voice they picked spot-on voice actors for all the characters.

616
00:47:32,244 --> 00:47:40,682
Rym: I mean I think Lisa Ortez who did Lena inverse plays Leona the girl and the tank police and She pretty much pulls it off exactly like the Japanese voice actors does.

617
00:47:41,184 --> 00:47:42,710
Rym: the guy playing Captain Britain is hilarious.

618
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:46,790
Rym: The two cat girls are done really really well in my opinion.

619
00:47:47,653 --> 00:47:48,690
Scott: Yeah, they're okay.

620
00:47:48,811 --> 00:47:51,223
Scott: I mean, it's obvious definitely a good dub.

621
00:47:51,263 --> 00:47:54,310
Scott: if you like to watch dubs You will not be disappointed by this dub.

622
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:59,610
Scott: It is incredibly tolerable and very entertaining and not much is lost in the dubbing.

623
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:01,499
Rym: See, I don't know why you're so down on this stuff.

624
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:02,785
Rym: I mean the comedic timing is good.

625
00:48:02,845 --> 00:48:04,870
Scott: I'm not down on it I'm just not a hunt.

626
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,320
Scott: It's like you're saying this dub is excellent.

627
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,870
Scott: and I'm saying the dub is like a good dub.

628
00:48:10,112 --> 00:48:11,869
Scott: Well, and now you're saying why are you down on it?

629
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:13,116
Rym: Well, you know what it is.

630
00:48:13,136 --> 00:48:15,670
Scott: you give it a plus and I give it an a-minus.

631
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:16,694
Scott: I'm not down on it.

632
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:17,516
Rym: if you rate it.

633
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:24,690
Rym: It's excellent because most anime dubs especially nowadays are piss-poor.

634
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:29,168
Rym: I would say that this dub is better than almost every dub that's been made in the last several years.

635
00:48:29,288 --> 00:48:33,405
Scott: any dub That is tolerable is better than any dub that's made in the past several years.

636
00:48:33,446 --> 00:48:34,530
Scott: So yes, that is true.

637
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:40,730
Rym: This is well above tolerable and I actually prefer watching it in English and I have seen it both in English and Japanese numerous times.

638
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:42,755
Scott: Yeah, I could go either way.

639
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:43,939
Scott: It doesn't really matter to me.

640
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,065
Rym: But aside from the dub being pretty good.

641
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:52,064
Rym: There's there's the sci-fi TV dub cut which is the same voice actors and mostly the same.

642
00:48:52,466 --> 00:49:02,610
Rym: but aside from having cut out I think like some 15 or 20 minutes worth of footage and Cutting out one of the funnier moments in the show because they just couldn't show that on the sci-fi channel.

643
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:04,082
Scott: There's no way they could have shown that.

644
00:49:04,425 --> 00:49:11,910
Rym: they also Removed all the explanation of what the plot was in the second half and it was when I was a kid.

645
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:19,663
Rym: I saw tank police and I thought it was hilarious, but I had no freaking idea What was going on at the end because they cut so much out.

646
00:49:19,703 --> 00:49:21,149
Rym: It just didn't make any sense at all.

647
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:35,430
Scott: Yeah, there's basically a scene in which they explain in plain English or plain Japanese Exactly what the hell's going on because they don't have a whole manga where they can, you know, reveal it to you slowly and correctly.

648
00:49:36,032 --> 00:49:44,309
Scott: So they just explain everything to you and then show you the end in a way so that you know what the hell's going on at the end at least as far as you were expected to know how it's going on.

649
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:48,410
Rym: and Luckily the the real dub on the DVDs also includes all that.

650
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:52,010
Rym: The only bad cut is the one they actually aired on the sci-fi channel.

651
00:49:52,452 --> 00:49:54,503
Scott: Yes, you don't want to see the one that was on the sci-fi.

652
00:49:54,563 --> 00:49:55,790
Rym: I have a tape of it somewhere.

653
00:49:56,252 --> 00:50:00,637
Scott: Yes, I mean it might be entertaining to watch it and see what they cut out But it's it's.

654
00:50:00,919 --> 00:50:02,489
Scott: you're not gonna get the effect of the show.

655
00:50:02,931 --> 00:50:07,110
Scott: You'll just get you'll understand why we liked it from watching it on the sci-fi channel.

656
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:17,657
Rym: Yes, because one thing the sci-fi channel cut does have going for it Is that it's a much tighter edit because they did cut out a lot of long panning environmental ambiance scenes.

657
00:50:17,737 --> 00:50:24,509
Rym: that if you take those out the show is much cleaner and there's better Transitions between all the humor and it feels like a tighter show.

658
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:28,990
Scott: The thing is I really like all the sorts of long panning environmental things.

659
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,398
Scott: That's why I like.

660
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:31,243
Scott: it's one of the reasons.

661
00:50:31,263 --> 00:50:32,390
Scott: I like to anime in the first place.

662
00:50:32,471 --> 00:50:32,655
Scott: Yeah,

663
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:49,406
Rym: except in this show It's kind of half-and-half because on one hand it's a goofy comedy and yet on the other hand There's this serious dead serious backdrop for the comedy and there's also and I find this really interesting They changed a lot of the music in the dub pretty

664
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:50,450
Scott: almost all of it.

665
00:50:50,591 --> 00:50:54,790
Rym: The thing is they didn't change all of it and it's hard to figure out.

666
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:58,290
Rym: I didn't actually do any research to figure out why or what rationale they might have had.

667
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:02,190
Rym: I don't know if there were licensing issues or if maybe they decided some songs would play better.

668
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:06,446
Scott: Maybe they had like the tracks for some of the songs, but not some of the other ones.

669
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:07,610
Rym: Yeah, I didn't do any research.

670
00:51:07,691 --> 00:51:18,570
Rym: We're not anime world order here and I don't really care why but the fact remains that they changed a good bit of the music and I'm of the opinion that now not all of the changes are good.

671
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:30,890
Rym: no, no, but a few of the songs that they put in the English dub I say are better and fit the mood of the Show and fit the humor and fit the scenes a lot better than what was originally in the Japanese.

672
00:51:31,092 --> 00:51:37,170
Scott: Yeah, unlike the aforementioned Initial D dub where all the music was changed to crap instead of eurobeat awesome.

673
00:51:38,171 --> 00:51:47,002
Scott: Some of the music that they put in to the dub to replace the Japanese music was better Or than the Japanese music or at least I like it better.

674
00:51:47,163 --> 00:51:56,190
Rym: whether it's like there's an opening scene I don't have a clip for this one where they're panning over the city and you're kind of getting the atmosphere of Alright, this is kind of a dystopian future.

675
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:57,273
Rym: The world's not so hot.

676
00:51:57,734 --> 00:52:14,809
Rym: and on the English dub the music is this really kind of slow ominous grooving thing and it's definitely Early 90s synthesizer, but it's pretty well done and it really seems to fit the animation on the screen in Japanese it's a little more light-hearted and it really doesn't feel like it fits.

677
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:16,039
Scott: I don't know.

678
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:17,430
Scott: I kind of like both sense.

679
00:52:17,792 --> 00:52:20,130
Scott: That's one of the changes where I think it's equal both ways.

680
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:23,910
Scott: Yeah, the American one isn't isn't bad and the Japanese one isn't bad.

681
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:27,549
Rym: I just think they both set very different moods for the show and I think both work.

682
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:34,637
Rym: I kind of prefer the dub one a little bit more, but I guess I like it a little bit darker Which is surprising considering that again, it's a comedy.

683
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:38,210
Scott: Yeah, I don't really prefer either one, but it's kind of surprising.

684
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,582
Scott: It's like hey, they replaced the music and they replaced it with different music.

685
00:52:41,602 --> 00:52:42,706
Scott: That's just as good.

686
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:43,489
Scott: So who cares?

687
00:52:43,529 --> 00:52:58,830
Rym: Yep No sometimes it seems obvious that they took out some music that might have sounded weird to an American who wasn't familiar with Japanese music or Anything and replaced it with I guess more Western sounding or easier to accept and understand or wouldn't stand out music

688
00:52:59,031 --> 00:52:59,993
Scott: like 80s music.

689
00:53:00,314 --> 00:53:10,070
Rym: but yet at the same time they left in a lot of very distinctly silly Japanese II songs that Work really well in the Japanese and they didn't get rid of him in the English.

690
00:53:10,932 --> 00:53:17,613
Scott: I really wish I knew how they decided what to change and what not to and who they got to make this music and why And when.

691
00:53:17,674 --> 00:53:19,543
Scott: and I would just be really interesting.

692
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:21,050
Rym: I'd really like to ask anime world order.

693
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:24,544
Rym: I'm sure they would know but I'm kind of afraid to send them another email.

694
00:53:24,925 --> 00:53:32,950
Rym: Yeah, they might say You guys are your anti-tank guy anti-tank guy, but I think the most striking change in the music.

695
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:35,928
Rym: I'm just gonna have to play the two here and you can judge for yourself.

696
00:53:36,632 --> 00:53:39,929
Rym: But here is the opening theme from the English dub.

697
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:22,578
Rym: We'll give it up.

698
00:54:30,636 --> 00:54:30,796
Rym: Now.

699
00:54:30,996 --> 00:54:35,240
Rym: not only is this awesome and I love this song this song is on my iPod right now.

700
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:36,973
Rym: I don't get to it on the way to work.

701
00:54:37,114 --> 00:54:39,607
Rym: Oh, yeah Yeah, cuz I have an old.

702
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:42,660
Rym: don't ask why I got taped these a long time ago.

703
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:47,435
Rym: I eventually made him into mp3s when I got the front offer Kodak way back in the day.

704
00:54:47,455 --> 00:54:59,312
Rym: Yeah, but anyway They made it specifically for the animated opener to tank police and it fits what's going on on the screen Exactly, and I think it's really good and I really like it.

705
00:54:59,393 --> 00:55:00,980
Rym: and it sets the kind of over-the-top.

706
00:55:01,581 --> 00:55:03,847
Rym: Yeah, it's about tank police.

707
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:07,577
Scott: Yeah, the English opening song with you know, take police.

708
00:55:07,898 --> 00:55:09,246
Scott: It's pretty good I like it.

709
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:09,972
Scott: It's fun.

710
00:55:10,194 --> 00:55:10,840
Scott: It's memorable.

711
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:16,700
Scott: Some of the lyrics are kind of a but whatever what lyrics it's tank police.

712
00:55:17,282 --> 00:55:18,948
Rym: Feel the power that we've got.

713
00:55:18,968 --> 00:55:21,396
Scott: feel the power that we've got is kind of corny.

714
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:22,560
Rym: Here's the thing.

715
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,229
Rym: It's not that corny in music.

716
00:55:24,269 --> 00:55:26,120
Rym: It's only corny if you say it without the music.

717
00:55:26,381 --> 00:55:27,525
Scott: Yeah, it's still corny.

718
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:29,732
Scott: when you think anyway, you stop to think it's corny.

719
00:55:29,813 --> 00:55:31,779
Rym: Here's the Japanese opener.

720
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:53,163
Scott: I Think to do with tank police.

721
00:55:53,344 --> 00:56:08,646
Scott: it a lot of anime back then seemed to have these doo-doo random Mediocre j-pop openers.

722
00:56:08,707 --> 00:56:09,409
Rym: that I don't know.

723
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:12,580
Rym: Maybe they just licensed the song because it was popular.

724
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:17,436
Scott: Well, I agree that hot dance and cherry moon has absolutely nothing to do with tank police.

725
00:56:17,496 --> 00:56:18,559
Scott: So he's nothing that I know.

726
00:56:19,861 --> 00:56:21,046
Scott: I kind of like that song.

727
00:56:21,067 --> 00:56:22,051
Scott: It's a good song.

728
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:24,100
Rym: I know you like music like that.

729
00:56:25,005 --> 00:56:27,500
Rym: I. I like music like that less than you, but I still like it.

730
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,640
Rym: But it really doesn't set the right mood for tank police and it doesn't match the opener at all.

731
00:56:32,821 --> 00:56:33,262
Scott: I don't think it.

732
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:35,471
Scott: I don't think it does match the mood of the show.

733
00:56:35,491 --> 00:56:37,840
Scott: That is correct, but I don't mind that.

734
00:56:37,981 --> 00:56:40,339
Scott: I mean you could play either opener for me and I don't care.

735
00:56:40,922 --> 00:56:42,166
Rym: there's also another music change.

736
00:56:42,186 --> 00:56:56,640
Rym: that kind of stood out to me partly because I remember the song very well and I think part of that is because When I first saw tank police I was young and I was full of hormones and this Dave and Joel I Imagine would have talked about this.

737
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:01,760
Rym: I actually avoided listening to their show on tank police until I'm gonna listen to it tomorrow on the way to work.

738
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,620
Scott: They stole our idea and did a tank police show before us, but that we're not gonna let that get us down.

739
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:10,139
Scott: Yeah, if anything this will double emphasize to people that they should watch this show.

740
00:57:10,662 --> 00:57:19,200
Rym: But there is a scene that I think is memorable because despite What the scene is actually about I think it was very well done and very comedic the cat girls.

741
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,519
Rym: You see there are cat girls in this show.

742
00:57:21,841 --> 00:57:31,213
Scott: There are two girls Anna Puma and Una Puma and they're members of block whose criminal if anyone challenges you to name some Actual cat girls and you don't name these two you suck.

743
00:57:31,434 --> 00:57:32,780
Scott: Yeah lose God.

744
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:38,820
Rym: Well, remember we ran the cut the anime match game at Katsucon and no one could name cat girls from anime at all.

745
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:40,773
Scott: Yeah, cuz yeah, they suck yet.

746
00:57:40,813 --> 00:57:41,740
Rym: There's this stereotype.

747
00:57:41,901 --> 00:57:45,140
Rym: Oh, yeah cat girls in anime, but no one can name any cat girls.

748
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,746
Scott: Well, here's some actual cat girls.

749
00:57:46,787 --> 00:57:50,040
Rym: people don't miss out not gonna get into why they're cat girls.

750
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:55,980
Rym: It has to do with cyborgs and all that business, but suffice to say there are two semi gratuitous cat girls.

751
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:01,260
Rym: However, they are awesome characters and when cornered by the ten by not the tank police.

752
00:58:01,602 --> 00:58:09,040
Rym: But that to quote Captain Britain the piss ant SWAT team They really have a bad opinion of the SWAT team is being.

753
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:14,140
Scott: Well, I would I would have a bad opinion of a SWAT team that ran away at any sign of dangers.

754
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,915
Rym: Well, I think the people who ran away were the normal police and then this was the SWAT team.

755
00:58:18,437 --> 00:58:22,639
Rym: Uh-huh But the cat girls are cornered and what do they do?

756
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:32,025
Rym: Well, obviously music starts playing and they begin a fairly well done tasteful striptease Which ends in hilarity.

757
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:35,795
Rym: now the songs in the English and the Japanese are a little different.

758
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:37,460
Rym: I like them both equally.

759
00:58:38,364 --> 00:58:42,744
Rym: I think I have a little bit of preference for the English one probably just because I saw that one first But they're both good songs.

760
00:58:43,065 --> 00:58:47,520
Rym: I'm not gonna bother playing them both, but I didn't bring this machine gun to surrender.

761
00:58:47,742 --> 00:58:50,000
Rym: Hey, don't you just love being in the spotlight?

762
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,629
Rym: I don't remember having such a big audience in a long time to you.

763
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:55,656
Rym: You haven't forgotten the routine.

764
00:58:55,877 --> 00:58:56,940
Rym: you bet I haven't.

765
00:59:30,931 --> 00:59:32,677
Scott: Yeah, I kind of forget which one is which.

766
00:59:32,717 --> 00:59:34,804
Scott: that's how they're like sort of in my mind.

767
00:59:34,844 --> 00:59:43,750
Rym: if you show me that scene with Either song I really couldn't tell you I do think again, however that the English song was better matched to the animation.

768
00:59:44,675 --> 00:59:54,132
Rym: It seems like a running problem where the music in tank Please didn't always perfectly match up with what was going on the screen and the beats and the transitions didn't match up with the scene Changes.

769
00:59:54,252 --> 01:00:13,038
Scott: I think it's probably because they just didn't try to have things match up in those days Like, you know nowadays you make a people make these anime music videos with their crappy windows computers And they all about matching up the beats of the music to the animation itself and back then I don't think people cared so much.

770
01:00:13,058 --> 01:00:22,830
Scott: Yeah, so when they brought it over to America They were I guess they tried to do that sort of like how that Jap German Sailor Moon opener the music matches the animation.

771
01:00:22,931 --> 01:00:24,304
Scott: It's the same animation that.

772
01:00:24,647 --> 01:00:32,049
Rym: yep Of course It also gives you a much different mood and idea as to what Sailor Moon is about a better one, of course Yes, of course.

773
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:38,877
Rym: But for any of you who haven't seen tank police I will just note that this scene the striptease I'm not gonna ruin.

774
01:00:38,897 --> 01:00:40,688
Scott: what a famous anime scene.

775
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:50,265
Rym: Yes I would say that among at least our generation mine and Scott's of anime fans We all grew up having seen that scene and I'll even admit it's pretty hot.

776
01:00:51,027 --> 01:00:53,396
Rym: It's kind of hot You're not gonna.

777
01:00:53,536 --> 01:00:54,822
Scott: usually it doesn't go.

778
01:00:54,882 --> 01:00:56,830
Scott: I don't go for the animated cat girls.

779
01:00:57,371 --> 01:01:06,777
Rym: You're not gonna find me very often admitting to being titillated by some cat girls doing a striptease in Front of a SWAT team in an anime.

780
01:01:07,017 --> 01:01:07,298
Scott: I'm not.

781
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:11,130
Scott: I'm not gonna say I'm not that titillated, but I'm titillated greater than zero.

782
01:01:11,731 --> 01:01:11,872
Rym: It's.

783
01:01:12,052 --> 01:01:17,345
Rym: it's a well done scene and the what happens during the scene is well worth it.

784
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:25,933
Rym: I Think my favorite part is when the one SWAT team sniper guy uses his scope not to get a bead on the girls But to zoom in.

785
01:01:26,595 --> 01:01:29,425
Rym: hey, and thus Dominion tank police.

786
01:01:29,605 --> 01:01:33,339
Rym: now, don't be confused I gotta end on this at least because there is the manga.

787
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:34,504
Rym: is the OAVs?

788
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:35,990
Rym: the OAVs are what you want to see.

789
01:01:36,331 --> 01:01:41,107
Rym: There is something called new Dominion tank police, which I haven't actually seen.

790
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:44,345
Rym: people have said it's okay But it's really not the original.

791
01:01:44,405 --> 01:01:44,989
Rym: It's something new.

792
01:01:45,311 --> 01:01:52,284
Rym: It's something different a separate DVD and there's also this funny cel shaded 3d animation tank police.

793
01:01:52,465 --> 01:01:53,310
Rym: I forget what it was called.

794
01:01:53,655 --> 01:01:55,372
Scott: I also forget what it's called But I haven't.

795
01:01:55,433 --> 01:02:03,425
Scott: we watched it and it was basically just a story in the tank police universe of the tank police Characters that didn't have anything to do with anything and it's kind of funny.

796
01:02:03,806 --> 01:02:04,751
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of funny It's.

797
01:02:04,871 --> 01:02:16,870
Rym: I think it was pretty cool and it was short enough to where it would have gotten really lame if it drug on at All but it ended exactly what I wanted it to end and it was actually a lot more serious than almost all of tank police.

798
01:02:17,252 --> 01:02:27,410
Scott: Yeah, the animation though was a little initial D kind of crummy But that was okay because I think that might actually been the encoding and not the original production, but it's hard to tell.

799
01:02:27,832 --> 01:02:45,450
Rym: Yeah, but in some Dominion tank police and again it might be hard to get this impression since we couldn't talk much about it is Not one of my favorite anime of all time But it is definitely on my list of anime that I really really love and I I can watch it anytime.

800
01:02:45,912 --> 01:02:51,481
Rym: I've seen tank police like seven or eight times and I crack up and laugh out loud Every time I watch it.

801
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:58,830
Scott: I Don't think it's one of my favorite shows is definitely a good show and it's definitely regardless of how good it is.

802
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:04,730
Scott: It's a show that every anime fan, especially an anime fan in America should see at some point.

803
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:21,589
Rym: well The thing is there are certain scenes that really crack me up and really all I should do is make rims tank police fix and all I have to do is take all the tank police pull out this like 45 maybe 40 minutes worth of the stuff that makes me laugh out loud Put it on a DVD and pop it in whenever I feel the urge.

804
01:03:22,071 --> 01:03:27,228
Scott: I think what they really just need to do is make like 30 scenes of them interrogating people.

805
01:03:27,248 --> 01:03:32,201
Scott: Oh I just make like, you know famous tank police interrogations.

806
01:03:32,702 --> 01:03:33,043
Rym: I don't know.

807
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:35,630
Scott: I think like the top 10 tank police interrogations.

808
01:03:35,851 --> 01:03:55,164
Rym: It's an understated moment, but I think my favorite scene and all of tank police hands down Not the striptease But they're talking about these this weird hospital that only treats healthy people and the captain is like, oh, yeah if hospitals only treat healthy people then the police should go rob banks.

809
01:03:55,585 --> 01:03:58,574
Rym: and then he pauses and says I Want to rob a bank?

810
01:03:58,815 --> 01:04:05,224
Rym: I've always wanted to but I've been keeping myself here, but no today's the day I'm gonna go rob a bank and the other cop who's with him is like up.

811
01:04:05,284 --> 01:04:07,756
Rym: What wait No, don't ah.

812
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:10,730
Rym: and just that scene cracks me up even thinking about it.

813
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:11,954
Rym: I'm laughing now a little bit.

814
01:04:12,576 --> 01:04:13,058
Scott: Yeah.

815
01:04:13,098 --> 01:04:13,359
Scott: Yeah.

816
01:04:13,419 --> 01:04:16,570
Scott: I also want to rob a bank so I can sympathize with that guy.
