1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,768
Scott: It's Thursday, June 28th.

2
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:12,770
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:15,818
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:19,820
Scott: We discuss sports steroids and spectators.

5
00:00:24,343 --> 00:00:25,377
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:37,034
Rym: So pretty much everything interesting that happened to me today happened in the last 10 minutes of my day And then my commute home.

7
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:42,370
Rym: so before that not exciting before that not exciting normal work stuff going around.

8
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:53,070
Rym: Just before I'm about to leave I'm talking to one guy who I'm working with more and more because generally I don't have many Social relations or interactions on any level with the vast majority of my co-workers.

9
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,215
Rym: it's just the nature of my work.

10
00:00:54,999 --> 00:01:02,110
Rym: and I end up talking to this guy who I've been talking to bit by bit and I mean it's turned out that he went to RIT way back and all sorts of little things.

11
00:01:02,172 --> 00:01:02,708
Rym: He's pretty cool.

12
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:11,323
Rym: And I discover pretty much right before I got to go catch my train That he's an anime fan and not just you know, oh I've heard of anime.

13
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:15,614
Rym: or oh I saw a cowboy bebop but yeah Second gig his old hat.

14
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:16,476
Scott: Uh-huh.

15
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:28,350
Rym: So as much as I wanted to talk to him after talking to him for a few minutes I realized that I'd been lingering too long and I know I had five minutes to make it to the train station a mile away.

16
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,256
Scott: That's not gonna happen.

17
00:01:30,738 --> 00:01:35,990
Rym: Well, uh, I made it there in six minutes and Luckily the train was slightly late.

18
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:36,464
Rym: I got.

19
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:44,617
Rym: you know I get to the platform and I run up and I'm like and I see the train coming in the distance and I think wow Holy shit, I can't believe I made it cuz.

20
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,745
Rym: I was still wearing my business clothes.

21
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:47,950
Rym: It totally sucked.

22
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:52,345
Rym: So I'm standing there and I'm watching the train come and I think wait a minute.

23
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:53,630
Rym: Something doesn't look right.

24
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:56,390
Rym: It looks like the trains going to the other platform.

25
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,908
Rym: then I look to the right away from where the trains coming and I see that on the little electronic display it says track change.

26
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:10,030
Rym: So now I have to run a flight of stairs up across that thing a flight of stairs down.

27
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:13,353
Rym: I barely made it Totally sucked.

28
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:17,946
Rym: So now I stagger out of this train completely covered in sweat just dripping.

29
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:19,349
Rym: It was awesome.

30
00:02:20,993 --> 00:02:22,321
Scott: The people on the train look at you funny.

31
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:24,735
Rym: Uh, not really I know.

32
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:28,030
Rym: one seems to react to anything that happens on a train these days.

33
00:02:28,332 --> 00:02:35,329
Rym: I mean someone could get up and just start screaming I'm gonna kill all the whiteies and the blackies and I'm crazy.

34
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:39,130
Rym: I think someone would say shut up the most you get is an angry glare.

35
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:42,143
Rym: It's so rare for someone to even tell someone loud to shut up.

36
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:43,309
Rym: Usually they just clarify them.

37
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:46,049
Scott: Yeah, we've had people shut him up before.

38
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:50,613
Scott: It takes quite a loudmouth to get that like.

39
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:50,974
Scott: so.

40
00:02:51,054 --> 00:03:02,872
Scott: one time there was a cell phone lady who just wouldn't shut up and then people were just like the whole train like woke up and started looking at each other and then Finally, you know, wow It was.

41
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:08,470
Rym: it was guys kind of like an ad hoc subtle election where everyone kind of eventually elects one person.

42
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,154
Rym: Who's gonna be the spokesperson for the mob?

43
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:12,980
Rym: Yep, so get on the train sit down.

44
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,340
Rym: Realize at that moment that I had left my 10-trip ticket.

45
00:03:16,982 --> 00:03:19,190
Rym: in my book is a bookmark that I just finished the book.

46
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,156
Rym: So I left the book in my office.

47
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:22,139
Rym: Haha.

48
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,163
Scott: The winner is you.

49
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:28,004
Rym: so the guy comes by and I'm like I forgot my ticket and he says it's cool.

50
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:28,949
Rym: I'll hit you next time.

51
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:30,834
Rym: Yep, I was like, whoa.

52
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:33,866
Scott: Wow, really and he came back and hit you the next and hit you.

53
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:35,634
Rym: Well, no, no No, I mean tomorrow.

54
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:37,140
Rym: I'm gonna show him my 10 trip.

55
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:38,527
Rym: He's gonna take an extra one off.

56
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:42,290
Scott: Oh Usually when they say hit you next time.

57
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:47,470
Scott: It means they're gonna go down the rest of the train then come back and get the people who didn't get ticketed.

58
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:50,783
Rym: Yeah, but now there's almost no one on that train for some reason.

59
00:03:50,803 --> 00:03:52,650
Rym: Yeah, I must have just been lucky.

60
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:55,568
Scott: Maybe me cuz the track change everyone got fooled.

61
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:58,766
Rym: Then I'm coming home around the train and I get up.

62
00:03:58,847 --> 00:03:59,208
Rym: cuz I got.

63
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:10,269
Rym: but the station we're at where we live beacons getting bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more people are getting on and off at beacon and There's two ways from the train platform to the parking lot.

64
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:28,010
Rym: one is a tunnel that goes under the tracks and one is this big elevated thing that goes above the tracks and pretty much you have to get up and stand there for five minutes in the train just to be close enough to a door to Have a chance of getting to those things and getting halfway up them before the fat people get there.

65
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:30,840
Scott: I don't know what the fuck is wrong with these fat people.

66
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,590
Scott: I really need to get some sort of system.

67
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:39,367
Scott: We're like, okay Anyone who's going to run can go first and then the people who are gonna walk slow is ass.

68
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:42,606
Rym: very simply You know stay to the right or something.

69
00:04:42,968 --> 00:04:43,250
Scott: Yeah

70
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:56,017
Rym: It's funny like the train gets off and you'll see like the 20 spry young cool people Who push their way past the fat people and then run up and down this thing and get in their cars their bikes and get Away before all the fat people get there.

71
00:04:56,037 --> 00:04:56,900
Rym: when I say fat people.

72
00:04:56,941 --> 00:05:00,396
Rym: I mean a good 70% of the people on this train Oh, yeah, they're.

73
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:01,541
Scott: if they're not fat.

74
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,485
Scott: They might be old.

75
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:04,613
Scott: They're at least overweight They're all over.

76
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:13,530
Scott: where the people with the wheelie luggage or I don't get the people with the wheelie luggage because they're carrying less than I am are people some people they kept the wheelie luggage.

77
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:16,990
Scott: That's just full of lots of unnecessary shit that they don't need that shit.

78
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,690
Scott: And then he got people with like a baby in a stroller.

79
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,382
Scott: And what all these people carrying too much shit need to get out of the way.

80
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:24,767
Rym: me with my little bag.

81
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,530
Rym: damn, baby It's right.

82
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:34,488
Rym: but It's funny because you see all this Smart quick people run and get to this thing and get up and get out of the way and get out before the traffic and the fat people in the man.

83
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:50,389
Rym: But if you don't get there before this crush of fat people gets there You basically have to stand there forever while fat people very slowly trudge up these steps Huffing and puffing the whole way and then just kind of block the whole thing huffing puffing their way back down.

84
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:54,799
Rym: Yeah, but I'm standing on the train.

85
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,510
Scott: it shouldn't be illegal for me to push those fat people down the stairs.

86
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,136
Rym: How are you going to push them?

87
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:02,590
Rym: their momentum alone will keep them stationary for a good five minutes.

88
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:05,585
Scott: Well, you see I just go and I if I can get past him.

89
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:06,690
Scott: I just lean backwards.

90
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:07,875
Scott: They won't that.

91
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:11,089
Scott: I'll add just enough force that they won't be able to make one step up.

92
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:17,683
Scott: So their only choice will be to take a step down Or stand still and I'm sure they'll just be as soon as if they're.

93
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:21,579
Scott: if they don't lower their center of gravity They'll topple pretty easily.

94
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:22,403
Rym: I don't know Scott.

95
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:26,840
Rym: Nothing moves the blob Except Cyclops who moves him very easily.

96
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,086
Scott: He just pushed one button.

97
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:28,649
Scott: They falls down.

98
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:29,997
Rym: Nothing moves up.

99
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:31,988
Rym: No, no, nothing moves that and then you win.

100
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:36,773
Rym: Yep So, uh, I'm standing there in front of all the fat people though They're pressing in.

101
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:50,066
Rym: I can see him like crush crushed up against the door to the area between the cars Like trying to get in and get in front of me so they can be all slow and then the train Slows down and we're not at the station yet and then it gets real

102
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:50,909
Scott: slows down some.

103
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:52,114
Scott: no No, it's up.

104
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:55,065
Rym: It really slows down and they're just been a big thunderstorm.

105
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:59,410
Rym: So I'm thinking crap now I'm gonna be stuck here on the train with fat people in every direction.

106
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:09,606
Rym: there's no way to get out of where I'm standing now because the fat people can't move and People start grumbling because it's all you know the cool young live people standing in this area trying to get ahead.

107
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:12,757
Rym: so they're all like Train delayed something fall on the tracks.

108
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:15,284
Rym: This totally sucks from grumble grumble rabble rabble rabble.

109
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:18,007
Rym: and then someone says oh man Look out the window.

110
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:27,922
Rym: So I look to the right and there's the road I normally drive home on there and there's a gigantic accident Consisting of one car that is completely blocked the road in both directions.

111
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:40,190
Rym: The winner is that guy something SUV Just must have been going too fast and flipped his car over like ten times and Hit the the rocks and hit it hit a lot of things and I don't think anyone survived.

112
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:42,242
Scott: How similar is this though?

113
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:49,262
Scott: You have the fat guy Blocking the stairs so you can't pass and you have the SUV Blocking the road, you know, it's.

114
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:54,563
Rym: it's almost poetic I it puts me one step closer to believing that maybe there's some meaning in it all.

115
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:59,806
Scott: maybe there's some karmic justice out there Or maybe just people create that with their minds.

116
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:04,781
Rym: or maybe Large things are generally bothersome unless they're giant robots.

117
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:07,408
Scott: Yeah giant robots wouldn't block any pads.

118
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:13,086
Scott: They would just open up Like through the middle of the earth or around Mars something like that.

119
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:15,830
Rym: Yeah, so yeah get to the train station.

120
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:17,687
Rym: I get past all the fat people.

121
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:23,424
Rym: Pretty much the moment the train door opens it starts pouring rain.

122
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:25,530
Scott: I had my umbrella cuz I checked the weather.

123
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,999
Rym: Yeah, my umbrella is really gonna help me when I'm riding my bike.

124
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:28,602
Scott: Yep.

125
00:08:28,863 --> 00:08:29,646
Scott: That's your problem.

126
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:30,248
Scott: That's why I drove.

127
00:08:30,268 --> 00:08:31,970
Rym: see I don't really mind getting wet.

128
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,485
Rym: It was just slightly annoying that the weather decided to bust out at that exact moment.

129
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:37,850
Rym: It could have waited five minutes.

130
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:39,616
Rym: It could have done it five minutes earlier.

131
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:43,770
Rym: The fact that it started right when I got there was the kicker.

132
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:49,450
Rym: Hey, that's it you get and now I'm home and I'm wearing silk and I'm dry and I'm happy.

133
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,699
Scott: Yeah, I got to take a shower didn't take one this morning.

134
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:52,523
Scott: I woke up late.

135
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:54,150
Rym: Yeah, I noticed you woke up late.

136
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:55,954
Rym: How are you blood?

137
00:08:55,974 --> 00:08:56,797
Rym: you went to bed early.

138
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:57,460
Scott: no, I didn't.

139
00:08:58,183 --> 00:08:59,890
Rym: well you went to your room early, that's right.

140
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:00,955
Scott: What did you do in there?

141
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:03,968
Scott: I was I was installed Linux's on my desktop.

142
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:04,349
Scott: Why?

143
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:05,915
Scott: That could have waited.

144
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:08,330
Scott: I don't use my desktop so much anymore.

145
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,584
Rym: Oh, wait a minute, so not only could it have waited, but you don't even use that computer.

146
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:14,210
Scott: That's why it's okay.

147
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,513
Scott: Linux's on it.

148
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:15,754
Scott: Wait.

149
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:17,180
Rym: Wait, I don't use it.

150
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,229
Rym: Anyway, so that's why I for went to the sleep I needed in order to upgrade it.

151
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:24,962
Scott: Yeah, I was just you know, trying out some distributions.

152
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,810
Scott: cuz if I don't use the computer, what does it matter?

153
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,198
Rym: We're gonna be home this weekend.

154
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:30,090
Rym: We got nothing to do except prepare for Connecticut.

155
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:35,356
Rym: I got to do that this weekend instead and play tigers and Euphrates Hey a bunch of times.

156
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:38,408
Rym: Yeah and teach Pete how to play power grid and all the other games.

157
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:38,950
Scott: We just bought.

158
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,410
Rym: So, yes, that was the saga.

159
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:48,150
Rym: I kind of want to get to work tomorrow to talk more to this guy about anime because he recognized the names of anime.

160
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,710
Scott: Amazing someone who is connected to the world.

161
00:09:51,730 --> 00:10:03,549
Rym: I mean previous to this point the most connected person I had met in my working life meaning at any job I had ever had outside of when I worked at that sub shop with Alex back when we lived at RIT.

162
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:06,803
Scott: I bet you there are more connected people at the sub shop RIT students.

163
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,630
Rym: Oh, definitely definitely definitely.

164
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:18,173
Rym: but The previously most connected person liked anime a little bit because of his son and he'd seen cowboy bebop and really liked it Not the Korean guy.

165
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:20,943
Scott: Ah, he knew about the metal girl.

166
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:22,207
Rym: Well the metal girl.

167
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:24,656
Rym: I don't work with her I just know her through work.

168
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:25,178
Scott: Uh-huh.

169
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:26,504
Rym: She's not really a co-worker.

170
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:29,395
Rym: Mm-hmm, and it's not the metal girl It's a whole metal department.

171
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:30,218
Rym: It's kind of cool.

172
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,490
Rym: It's like this one enclave of cool transfer to the metal department.

173
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:35,336
Rym: I don't really want to work in that department.

174
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:37,002
Rym: That's not a technical department.

175
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:41,054
Rym: I'd be doing paperwork metal paperwork No metal work.

176
00:10:41,294 --> 00:10:45,610
Rym: They can only listen to the metal when one of the bosses isn't there which is kind of often.

177
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:49,689
Rym: But whenever that boss is there, it's a totally different office and everyone's just a busy busy worker be.

178
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:52,539
Rym: Thank God, it's Friday.

179
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:54,370
Scott: Someone's got a case of the Mondays?

180
00:10:56,953 --> 00:10:58,674
Rym: Yeah, I Can't complain too much.

181
00:10:58,754 --> 00:11:01,024
Rym: My job's not so bad compared to what my job could be.

182
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:05,232
Scott: Ah my job Yeah, fuck you Don't get.

183
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:06,437
Scott: don't work at shitty places.

184
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:07,622
Scott: That's that was how I got.

185
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:09,470
Scott: I just know how to work anywhere.

186
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,819
Scott: That wasn't at least moderately cool.

187
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,429
Rym: Yeah, part of the issue is IT is a different field from CS.

188
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:18,403
Scott: We got IT guys one one IT guy one IT guy.

189
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:20,049
Rym: There's no more IT openings like that.

190
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,410
Rym: that are good.

191
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,367
Scott: I think you're smarter than he is, but he knows more about windows than both of us combined.

192
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:26,309
Scott: Yeah Oh, well, I could get his job.

193
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,363
Rym: I applied for a fairly senior position at my company internally.

194
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:29,724
Rym: cuz I want.

195
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:31,893
Rym: I don't want to stop doing what I'm doing now But I'm doing now.

196
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:35,910
Rym: I could teach any one of you out there how to do my job in about a week.

197
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,569
Rym: It's not that tough, but they pay really well, which is kind of weird.

198
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:42,661
Rym: But I applied for some big tech position and I get it.

199
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:46,869
Rym: I'm the job would be trivial to do But I don't have any Cisco certs.

200
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:52,070
Rym: So we'll see where that goes, yep, I might just get the stupid Cisco cert.

201
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,610
Rym: It would probably take a week of studying and then pay the whatever hundred bucks to take the stupid test.

202
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,040
Scott: That's the thing that really bothers me.

203
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,289
Scott: is you got to pay to take the tests.

204
00:11:58,734 --> 00:11:59,341
Scott: They what they should.

205
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:01,976
Scott: it would be fine If it was just pay to take classes.

206
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:05,970
Scott: taking the test is you know, like a minimal fee just like 10 bucks.

207
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,738
Scott: But let's pay to take the test.

208
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:08,220
Scott: it should be.

209
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,190
Scott: you're testing to see if I'm smart enough.

210
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,738
Scott: Why should I have to pay to take the test?

211
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:12,763
Rym: because they're not to do.

212
00:12:12,783 --> 00:12:14,190
Rym: they're not testing the classes.

213
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,900
Rym: They're not testing to see if you're smart enough.

214
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:20,540
Rym: if you're getting a Cisco certification You're paying to give them money.

215
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:22,689
Rym: Cisco makes a lot of money off of that.

216
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:23,798
Scott: Yep That's why it's all.

217
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,090
Rym: a lot of people make a lot of money.

218
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:31,250
Scott: Certification right test that only costs like 10 bucks to take and then just charge money for the class.

219
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,637
Rym: You know that kind of gives me an idea.

220
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:37,458
Scott: and then we'll say we'll market it to all the businesses like hey This is a real certification.

221
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:40,490
Scott: It's basically it's not about paying money to a company.

222
00:12:40,771 --> 00:12:44,130
Scott: It's about determining if your employees actually knows what the fuck they're talking.

223
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:48,750
Rym: You know that gives me a much more interesting and fun idea that doesn't require much investment.

224
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,888
Rym: Yeah Why don't we you and me?

225
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:59,558
Rym: write the GeekNights test to certify if you are or are not a Useless person or a crappy person or something like that.

226
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:08,870
Rym: the awesome test the are you awesome test and we'll administer it online And we'll set something up and if you pass it, I guess you only get to take it once maybe once every year.

227
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,554
Rym: We could set it up.

228
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,090
Rym: then you're so officially certified people.

229
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:13,783
Scott: They might use the Wikipedia.

230
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:18,325
Scott: if we you know We got a maybe we could like administer it at cons at our table or something.

231
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:19,670
Rym: That'd be a pretty good idea.

232
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,155
Scott: People couldn't use the Internet's.

233
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:23,483
Scott: it would just be are you awesome in that case?

234
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:24,647
Rym: We could have an interview portion.

235
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:28,340
Rym: Ooh Yeah, people could walk around you even sell the shirt.

236
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,897
Scott: Rimmins got like if you pass the test then you get like a certified Button that says like certified the button.

237
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:36,465
Rym: if someone I say we make the test difficult enough to where?

238
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,579
Rym: if people pass it one Automatically our friend.

239
00:13:40,264 --> 00:13:41,229
Rym: No questions asked.

240
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:45,320
Rym: Member of the crew to diploma three t-shirt.

241
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:46,864
Rym: Well, yeah, I guess t-shirt.

242
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:51,498
Scott: Yeah, I took this test and all I got You can't pass 10 tests.

243
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:53,670
Rym: All right, that's enough of that.

244
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:59,630
Rym: So in the news, I'll start first because this this has been festering for a long time.

245
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:13,750
Rym: I know we have a lot of international listeners and I know a lot of our international listeners understand the The difficulties faced by the American politician and the American people abroad in the last I don't know several years.

246
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:22,110
Rym: Well internally things are actually heating up and there is what might be a looming constitutional crisis in the United States.

247
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:35,049
Rym: Aha Basically what it comes down to is that the US government is set up into three separate branches that Nominally are equal in power and each one has some control over the other two.

248
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:49,989
Rym: Thus it is very difficult to actually fully take over the US government Because no matter what the odds are one of the three branches is gonna hold out long enough For whoever's in power to lose power or die or whatever and it generally keeps the system going.

249
00:14:50,758 --> 00:15:14,065
Rym: well, uh Congress has power over the executive branch a number of ways and due to some improprieties that have happened in the last several years Congress has been subpoenaing many people and documents and demanding sworn testimony from members of the executive branch the president's office and Those people basically gave Congress the finger and said no executive privilege.

250
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:16,794
Rym: We're not testifying for shit We're not giving you our documents.

251
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:17,416
Rym: dine of fire.

252
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:18,279
Scott: They have to.

253
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,330
Rym: yeah, they do have to or else that's contempt.

254
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:25,182
Rym: So now the deadline has passed and it's too late.

255
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:27,730
Rym: It happened and Congress is going to jail.

256
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:28,633
Rym: well, we don't know.

257
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:37,308
Rym: yet Congress is saying well, uh, we're probably gonna slap you all with contempt and It looks like the White House might say under what authority?

258
00:15:38,892 --> 00:15:41,861
Scott: The authority of the Congress of the United States of America.

259
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:46,236
Rym: Yeah, but to quote one of my What the moat?

260
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:48,006
Rym: I have very ambivalent feelings about this.

261
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:51,578
Rym: and Jackson John Marshall has made his decision.

262
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:52,943
Rym: now, let's see him enforce it.

263
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,172
Scott: and with his federal marshals He does.

264
00:15:55,192 --> 00:16:01,356
Scott: that doesn't happen so much that the feds nobody has testicles the law Totally supports.

265
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,265
Rym: the federal marshals didn't really go.

266
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:04,712
Rym: well, they didn't exist back then I don't think.

267
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:08,470
Rym: but they didn't go over and stop Andrew Jackson's Indian genocide.

268
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:09,573
Scott: No, they didn't.

269
00:16:09,753 --> 00:16:12,480
Scott: but they could have stopped him if they really wanted to.

270
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:17,924
Rym: they just didn't know how what John Marshall is gonna Go stand in front of him on the battlefield.

271
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:18,529
Rym: He just showed him.

272
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:20,041
Scott: No, I don't think he would have.

273
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:22,937
Scott: I think he would have Jackson would have but no one else would.

274
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:24,766
Rym: yeah, but it was Andrew Jackson.

275
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:25,630
Rym: That's why it happened.

276
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:31,594
Scott: I'm sure they could have had someone arrest them, you know, if the president Someone arrests him.

277
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:32,719
Rym: He had an army with him.

278
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:33,502
Rym: All right.

279
00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:38,819
Scott: Yeah ready if the president right now Let's say George Bush right now went and robbed a bank, right?

280
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,624
Scott: All right, someone arrests him.

281
00:16:40,985 --> 00:16:41,787
Scott: who would do that?

282
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,453
Rym: Uh, Probably no one.

283
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:45,798
Scott: someone arrests him.

284
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,410
Rym: He goes to jail not so much not above the law.

285
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:51,462
Scott: He follows the same laws as everyone else.

286
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:52,729
Rym: You have to be impeached first.

287
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,719
Scott: Yeah, you could get arrested and go to jail.

288
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:02,125
Rym: then you would have to be convicted in in the impeachment proceedings And then no impeachment would just be to make him no longer the president.

289
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:03,590
Rym: Oh, yeah, but you'd be the president.

290
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,313
Scott: It's not jail.

291
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:06,462
Rym: impeachment just means you're bringing the charges.

292
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:08,430
Rym: you then have to go through the whole process.

293
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:14,210
Scott: Like if he robbed a bank and didn't get impeached he could theoretically be in jail.

294
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:16,483
Scott: Guilty of robbing bank.

295
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:17,670
Scott: I'll still be president.

296
00:17:18,092 --> 00:17:23,069
Rym: I'm not gonna argue because I don't want to extend the news long, but that's not what would happen.

297
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:24,276
Scott: I think that could happen.

298
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,728
Scott: Uh, you continue to think I don't think it would happen But I think that's that's the way I read it read.

299
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:33,800
Rym: lawyer What what what clauses would you cite in this assessment?

300
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:36,568
Scott: Scott law number one rob bank.

301
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,190
Scott: go to jail.

302
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:39,533
Scott: Law number two Constitution.

303
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:46,436
Scott: if the Congress wants to remove someone from office because they did X Y or Z. they do X Y and Z. Well a B and C.

304
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:46,857
Rym: Yes.

305
00:17:46,938 --> 00:17:49,830
Rym: What I was saying was they can't do anything to him until they remove him from office.

306
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:57,121
Scott: I think you can now Someone's in office doesn't make them immune to going to jail for crimes.

307
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:57,722
Rym: All right.

308
00:17:57,883 --> 00:17:59,928
Rym: Anyway, I'll just let that stand.

309
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:05,270
Rym: Yeah This is gonna be a big issue because it looks like no one's really sure how to proceed.

310
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:14,910
Rym: Congress is gonna do what they're gonna do and the White House is probably just gonna continue to ignore him and The courts are gonna have to decide and no one can really say where the court will swing.

311
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:25,492
Rym: This could end in a big uproar followed by nothing or it could end in the possible arrest of several high members of the United States government Generally.

312
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:30,024
Scott: and because how many times this happened already in the past eight years where?

313
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:35,020
Scott: and it was oh my god Oh my god, oh my god, and then nothing's changed.

314
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:35,723
Rym: things did change.

315
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:37,290
Rym: Scooter Libby is going to jail.

316
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:44,896
Rym: Yeah, but that's Scooter Libby who cares and those investigations are still ongoing and a bunch of other people have gone to jail for things With the Abramov scandal.

317
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:47,350
Rym: It's all still happening just behind the scenes.

318
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:52,909
Rym: The press doesn't cover it a lot because it's very boring and it's not really changing anything that much.

319
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:54,636
Scott: We're still in the same shit.

320
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:55,459
Scott: We've always been in.

321
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,050
Rym: oh, so you you don't even pay attention to politics.

322
00:18:58,331 --> 00:18:59,434
Rym: No reason for that.

323
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:02,001
Rym: cuz shit don't change but things do change.

324
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:05,210
Scott: what just slowly over time too slowly to make a difference?

325
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:06,528
Rym: Uh, it's making a difference.

326
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:12,630
Rym: now The presidency is having less and less actual power to do what they're doing because we voted for Democrats in Congress.

327
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:16,930
Rym: It's not just that because the Democrats don't alone don't have the power to just change things.

328
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:21,650
Scott: No, but they the Republicans no longer have the power to keep doing more bad things.

329
00:19:22,082 --> 00:19:23,375
Scott: Yeah And that's why.

330
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:29,228
Rym: well the issue at stake here is that they were doing the things they were doing anyway Because the presidency was just doing it.

331
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,424
Rym: Yep, and Congress doesn't didn't really have the power to stop him the way things were going.

332
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:37,865
Rym: now Congress is saying All right, we're stopping you and he said you can't.

333
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:39,988
Scott: oh It's not gonna work.

334
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:42,081
Rym: Well, we don't know if it.

335
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:46,790
Rym: if that's not gonna work Scott Then this is going to be a big crisis because a bunch of key people are gonna go to jail.

336
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:52,090
Rym: Otherwise it is gonna work and then like you said nothing changes in which case what you just said was wrong.

337
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:52,674
Rym: So which is it?

338
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,970
Scott: I think it's not gonna be.

339
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:56,234
Rym: What do you think it's gonna?

340
00:19:56,414 --> 00:19:58,099
Rym: well, that's such a cop-out.

341
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:58,922
Scott: Yeah, it is.

342
00:19:59,202 --> 00:20:01,770
Scott: Yeah, cuz really either way it goes.

343
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:04,694
Scott: It's not really gonna Bother me.

344
00:20:04,714 --> 00:20:08,224
Rym: Yeah, you're saying that you you were excited about fits miss.

345
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:09,970
Rym: I don't think you're saying that you would.

346
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,774
Rym: yes You were you acted like.

347
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:18,450
Rym: you're gonna say that you wouldn't care if half of the president's cabinet or his advisors all went to jail.

348
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:23,162
Rym: All right, so then he's gonna get away with it.

349
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:23,765
Scott: and you know what.

350
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:25,432
Scott: until it does happen I don't care.

351
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:31,430
Scott: Okay, everything before the news that says everyone goes to jail is just BS news.

352
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:33,561
Scott: It's just something might happen.

353
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:34,909
Scott: I don't care about something might happen.

354
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:38,070
Scott: news Remember I was talking before about the countdowns and the video game websites.

355
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:44,127
Scott: I don't care until it's there's a news like people are in jail or something's changed.

356
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:44,970
Scott: There's a huge deal.

357
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:45,772
Scott: I don't care.

358
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:47,197
Scott: I don't care about what might be.

359
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,642
Scott: I don't care about what could be.

360
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:51,250
Scott: I don't care about something may be happening.

361
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:52,238
Scott: I care about happenings.

362
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,206
Scott: That's all I care about.

363
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:53,590
Rym: now.

364
00:20:53,971 --> 00:21:06,984
Rym: what I would say is that because of that you often ignore a lot of news or a lot of things out there and as a result you end up having a very Narrow world view and that you don't know a lot about a lot of things that

365
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:07,886
Scott: don't affect me

366
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:15,280
Rym: that it might be useful to Know about them in order to have a greater understanding of the way Politics and the economy and everything interact as a whole.

367
00:21:15,501 --> 00:21:18,230
Scott: but I don't need to know about those things nor do I care.

368
00:21:18,655 --> 00:21:19,889
Scott: I need to know about geeky things.

369
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:30,587
Scott: Okay, I've decided that it's just not worth it to pay attention to all that bullshit and because it all it does detract from my Everyday life all I really want is that how does it detract from your everyday life?

370
00:21:30,607 --> 00:21:31,050
Rym: to be more?

371
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,276
Rym: Knowledgeable about the processes in the government.

372
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:37,550
Scott: every minute I spend thinking about that bullshit is one less minute of geeky awesomeness.

373
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,654
Scott: So I'm going to maximum.

374
00:21:38,734 --> 00:21:50,089
Scott: all I want see if they let's say the government was just running perfectly and smoothly with no problems Right, which is what I would want Then I would pretty much spend all my days doing geeky awesomeness and not thinking about you

375
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:55,270
Rym: realize That's one more step toward being a nerd because you're narrowing your knowledge of the world willingly.

376
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:58,990
Rym: Hey, I know enough about what's going on, you know, correct?

377
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:10,650
Rym: I remember and I hate to bring this up on the show But I do want to point out that there was a fairly heated debate a long time ago in the forums that predated this Where Scott asserted?

378
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:19,609
Rym: Seriously that the Romans got the ideas for their battle tactics and their swords and their armor from the Knights of the Middle Ages.

379
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:26,628
Rym: Hey, so and it took quite a bit of convincing to show him that that was not the case.

380
00:22:26,948 --> 00:22:33,068
Scott: That's one problem I always had in history class is that they would always teach you about these different points in history Like we're gonna teach you about this.

381
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:39,770
Scott: No one ever in any history class ever took told me what order all these different parts of history happened.

382
00:22:40,253 --> 00:22:42,790
Rym: You know, you know those numbers that they occasionally threw out.

383
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:51,375
Scott: No That's the thing is that in all my years of school like our entire school system had a thing where there was absolutely no Memorization ever.

384
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:54,833
Rym: Oh, I'm not saying memorization, but they'd still say no They never.

385
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,649
Scott: they would just complete say years don't you know, don't worry about what year things happened in.

386
00:22:59,395 --> 00:23:00,849
Scott: That was the way my school taught things.

387
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:09,027
Scott: Well one that my entire Trumbull public school system because they wanted to get away from that, you know Stereotypical history class like what year did X happen?

388
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:09,490
Scott: in what year?

389
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:09,870
Rym: Why?

390
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:16,929
Rym: that seems silly and - I highly doubt that even if they didn't say years that you I mean, how could you have not?

391
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:23,030
Rym: Understood some basic level of what came before what they never told us ever?

392
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:30,340
Scott: So then you're saying you didn't learn anything about the middle and also even if I let's say I didn't even know the Middle Ages Happened right now Wouldn't really affect my life.

393
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,569
Scott: I'd still be alright.

394
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:36,504
Rym: Yeah, and that's why I'm saying that you have a very narrow and somewhat sad worldview.

395
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:41,704
Scott: as a result now my worldview is pretty Better than the vast majority of people on this earth.

396
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:45,310
Scott: You're stepping toward becoming another to know these complicated details of things.

397
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:48,029
Scott: It is no basically what's going on and that's good enough for me.

398
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:59,744
Rym: however I would say that your lack of general knowledge of the world often leaves you in a situation where you can't effectively argue your points Because you can't draw analogies or parallels with other people regarding the events.

399
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:01,610
Rym: You're trying to argue about currently like what?

400
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:03,841
Rym: I'm not gonna get into that.

401
00:24:03,882 --> 00:24:06,084
Scott: Uh-huh That's all I thought.

402
00:24:06,368 --> 00:24:12,390
Rym: well I'll say it like this in general when we argue in the front row crew and I among our friends.

403
00:24:12,892 --> 00:24:16,544
Rym: It is exceedingly rare that anyone agrees with you on any points.

404
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:18,149
Scott: people agree with me all the time.

405
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:20,202
Scott: It's just when they agree with me.

406
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:21,410
Scott: They usually isn't an argument.

407
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:26,726
Scott: So if there's an argument, but it's probably something to disagree on when has there been a time in the past?

408
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:27,529
Rym: I don't know.

409
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:32,669
Rym: Seven years where there wasn't an argument at least two or three in a given day.

410
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:38,721
Rym: Anyway, we've gone on about that for a while.

411
00:24:38,782 --> 00:24:40,550
Rym: So what's your news?

412
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:53,783
Scott: My news is that some people are yet again Bringing up the bullshit rumor that there's gonna be some sort of Led Zeppelin reunion something something but John Bonham's dead.

413
00:24:53,804 --> 00:25:03,577
Scott: Yeah Well, the the rumor always is is that his son will play the drums instead of him because he's dead, but it's not him I know But I you know are there?

414
00:25:03,597 --> 00:25:04,381
Scott: I don't even know.

415
00:25:04,762 --> 00:25:06,550
Rym: I assumed at least some of them are still alive.

416
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,199
Rym: I'd stop paying attention to Led Zeppelin a lifetime ago.

417
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:15,023
Scott: consists of Jimmy Page John Paul Jones The the deceased John Bonham and Robert Plant.

418
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:16,470
Scott: Okay bottom is the drummer.

419
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,004
Scott: So only the drummer is dead and his son knows how to play the.

420
00:25:20,045 --> 00:25:20,828
Scott: Joe wasn't sure.

421
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:21,330
Rym: it is a lot.

422
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,676
Rym: I wasn't sure who was still alive.

423
00:25:23,037 --> 00:25:24,222
Scott: only John Bonham is dead.

424
00:25:24,242 --> 00:25:24,805
Scott: He died.

425
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:29,302
Scott: I think when I was born yeah, and they haven't been together since he died.

426
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:42,686
Scott: and they're the greatest rock band ever and People always rumor that they're gonna have a reunion because Goddamn with the tickets to that sell out stupidly fast and ha cost like a billion dollars on eBay.

427
00:25:42,746 --> 00:25:52,415
Scott: funny how you say sell out yes, yeah, yeah, and well the rumor yet again is false, of course, but But Tom was.

428
00:25:52,535 --> 00:25:56,209
Scott: one very funny thing is that someone went up and asked Robert Plant about it?

429
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,737
Scott: And he said this is funny.

430
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:58,119
Scott: You ready?

431
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:09,789
Scott: He said a Plant insisted he hadn't heard anything about the rumored Zeppelin reunion and jokingly added quote If there was one then there wouldn't be enough doctors to support it.

432
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:13,386
Scott: I thought that was pretty funny.

433
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:19,247
Rym: It seems like there's been a lot of speculative rumor-mongering lately on.

434
00:26:19,347 --> 00:26:25,786
Scott: well dig Yeah, generally, I think that's you know dig is too democratic and slash.

435
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:28,826
Scott: that is not democratic enough And I'm not gonna talk about that again.

436
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:39,289
Rym: Anyway, it is time for none other than the things of the day.

437
00:26:40,594 --> 00:26:54,810
Rym: so apparently in January of 1992 a storm caused a cargo container full of well I'll just leave them as unnamed objects into the ocean where they promptly scattered and disappeared into the ocean currents.

438
00:26:55,131 --> 00:27:01,410
Rym: Alright, these items has four have for the past 15 years been floating about the oceans of the world.

439
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:07,280
Rym: periodically chunks of them have been making landfall and It's kind of a cool funny story.

440
00:27:07,943 --> 00:27:11,965
Rym: So it's 30,000 floating rubber duckies.

441
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,366
Rym: Apparently they're over the flash 15 years.

442
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:19,994
Rym: They have eventually become bleached white Some of them sunk.

443
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:24,830
Rym: many of them were frozen in ice in the Arctic for a very long time as they slowly made their way.

444
00:27:25,753 --> 00:27:31,410
Scott: Kind of weird like if they all started in the same place wouldn't the ocean currents take them to generally the same place?

445
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,056
Scott: And they know it's the majority of they did.

446
00:27:33,076 --> 00:27:39,094
Rym: there's a flotilla of them that has been journeying nearly 17,000 miles.

447
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:40,877
Rym: it crossed the Arctic Ocean.

448
00:27:40,897 --> 00:27:46,790
Rym: It's been all over the world and Apparently it's heading toward Britain shortly.

449
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,505
Scott: Yeah, so is it gonna hit any beaches or something eventually?

450
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:50,726
Rym: why?

451
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:51,730
Rym: yes, it looks like it is.

452
00:27:51,810 --> 00:28:00,875
Rym: I'm not gonna go into the details of where it's gonna hit because we already talked forever but this is a pretty interesting story that you'd fry like to check out and Apparently there's a bounty.

453
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:06,128
Rym: the company that lost them says that if you find one They'll give you a hundred bucks if you give it back to them.

454
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:12,110
Scott: Well, if you find the whole flotilla just freaking get a scoop send them back most of them and keep one.

455
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:19,290
Rym: Yeah, well apparently there's a few on eBay right now that sell sold for like 500 pounds and they're kind of collector's items.

456
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:24,970
Scott: Well, I just take a rubber ducky and bleach it and free and unfreeze it and then sell it on eBay.

457
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:27,899
Rym: Yeah, actually I thought about that quite a bit.

458
00:28:28,642 --> 00:28:31,090
Rym: I didn't say anything on the show because I was thinking about doing that.

459
00:28:31,431 --> 00:28:32,296
Scott: Well, let's do it.

460
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,206
Scott: What are people gonna do it say about it?

461
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:34,950
Rym: I don't know.

462
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,653
Scott: They won't be able to put.

463
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:37,862
Scott: there's no certificate of authenticity.

464
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,770
Scott: Just be like hey, I found this on the beach.

465
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,310
Scott: I think it's one of those ones and put some sand on it and you're good to go.

466
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:57,857
Rym: actually one cool thing that came out of this is there are groups of scientists that study the ocean currents of the world and They've been keeping track of every time these things made landfall to kind of chart the ocean currents that pushed them around over the last 15 years.

467
00:28:57,877 --> 00:29:02,190
Scott: Mm-hmm Why did they do this on purpose as a scientific experiment then?

468
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,840
Rym: I think they do things like that on their own.

469
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,864
Rym: this just happened to be a thing So they might as well be it to pay attention to it.

470
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:12,797
Scott: Sounds good All right My news is equally trivial to that.

471
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:23,729
Scott: if you've ever watched initial D or if you know anything about cars You might know that there is a car that exists that called the Nissan Skyline GTR.

472
00:29:24,572 --> 00:29:26,778
Rym: It's a pretty badass car.

473
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:31,290
Rym: I wouldn't want to own one just because it's kind of useless to me, but pretty cool.

474
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:38,050
Scott: Yes, basically this car in short was made in Japan only is not street-legal in the United States.

475
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:44,650
Scott: However, many people get them brought to Canada then they make they fix them up So they are street-legal in the United States.

476
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,934
Scott: Then they bring them into the United States.

477
00:29:46,014 --> 00:29:50,950
Scott: that cost a lot of money haven't made these cars in a very long time.

478
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,024
Scott: So you're you're buying like a car that's many years old.

479
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:55,370
Scott: You're not buying a new car here.

480
00:29:55,893 --> 00:30:05,903
Scott: you know all of the most of them are modified and Basically the thing about this car is that it is heavily computerized like literally driving.

481
00:30:05,923 --> 00:30:10,930
Scott: this car is As the same as driving like Gran Turismo.

482
00:30:11,431 --> 00:30:23,890
Scott: the computer keeps you from skidding off and all sorts of stuff and it even shows you like g-forces and It's really really high-tech and it turns a mediocre driver into an amazing driver.

483
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:30,690
Scott: I mean, you're not gonna go win the rally with this thing because those guys just Colin McRae is still gonna kick your ass or whatever.

484
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:39,138
Scott: But you're gonna beat all your friends if you buy this car pretty much guaranteed if they don't have one That's unless one of your friends is secretly an awesome drive

485
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,586
Rym: or if you much like Nakazato

486
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:51,330
Scott: our choke artist Yes, but this car is a freaking awesome amazing car that is greatly coveted by ricers and non ricers everywhere.

487
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:52,557
Rym: So what's your thing today?

488
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:53,442
Rym: Is that this car exists?

489
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:58,021
Scott: Well, no because I knew that There's been people talking for a long time.

490
00:30:58,062 --> 00:31:03,790
Scott: that are they're gonna remake the car They're gonna bring it to the US something something and it's never really happened.

491
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:07,750
Rym: You know what probably gonna happen right around when Led Zeppelin comes back together?

492
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,817
Scott: Yeah Well at the Goodwood festival of speed.

493
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:15,630
Scott: the Goodwood festival of speed is basically the world's biggest most baddest car show.

494
00:31:15,711 --> 00:31:17,300
Scott: You know you go to local car shows.

495
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:18,830
Scott: some guys bring out their classic cars.

496
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,252
Scott: Whatever.

497
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:27,485
Scott: Goodwood is like that for the whole world of amazingness and They saw GTR there one of the new awesome ones.

498
00:31:27,505 --> 00:31:28,510
Scott: that isn't available yet.

499
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,643
Scott: So and there's a picture of it right here for you to ogle.

500
00:31:33,366 --> 00:31:39,126
Scott: It's got a bra on the front I think covering up some secrets, but that's definitely a GTR.

501
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:40,089
Scott: There's no mistake in it.

502
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,465
Scott: You just compare it to what the old GTR looks like and you're like, yep.

503
00:31:43,545 --> 00:31:44,369
Scott: That's what that car is.

504
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:47,123
Rym: Yeah, that definitely has something in common with my first car.

505
00:31:47,565 --> 00:31:49,833
Rym: It has a bra on it Covering something up.

506
00:31:50,194 --> 00:31:51,417
Rym: Yeah, however in my case.

507
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:56,190
Rym: It wasn't so much secrets, but dense now faded paint and a rust spot.

508
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,890
Scott: Yeah, this car doesn't have to worry about that.

509
00:31:58,411 --> 00:32:10,931
Scott: But yeah, if I ever I don't know get more monies or if this car comes out and my car happens to be dead Maybe like by the time my car dies this car will be out and like a little bit old I can get a used one Or something.

510
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:11,413
Scott: I don't know.

511
00:32:11,874 --> 00:32:14,040
Scott: It's definitely a very desirable vehicle.

512
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,890
Scott: It's mostly because it's so nerdy with its advanced computer systems.

513
00:32:20,097 --> 00:32:23,560
Scott: Alright, uh For Thursdays, we've been doing kind of air topics.

514
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:24,905
Scott: I think oh, I don't know.

515
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:25,367
Scott: Maybe not.

516
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:26,830
Rym: I think they've been okay They've been alright.

517
00:32:27,031 --> 00:32:35,784
Rym: I think the ad topic the ad problem was that the shows we planned to do were always kind of lame and we just filled It in and we'd always like Wednesday night come up with the show.

518
00:32:35,824 --> 00:32:43,112
Scott: We were actually doing every week Yep So I tried to think of something because people have been talking that me and Rym do better shows me Disagree.

519
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:48,392
Scott: most of the shows you've been doing for the past many months have been all agree shows where we're like, yeah this yeah Yeah, yeah.

520
00:32:48,412 --> 00:32:52,430
Scott: Yeah, and I wanted to pick something that we slightly disagree on.

521
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:57,850
Rym: Yeah, it's part of the reason we I think the news I picked is we decided to make the show as adversarial as possible.

522
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:02,805
Rym: Yep, so I think so Scott came up with this dumbass idea for a topic.

523
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:04,933
Scott: Well, it's not a dumb idea It's crap.

524
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:07,545
Scott: You saw you're just trying to be adversarial your mom.

525
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:16,150
Scott: Yeah All right There was that recent news story about that pro wrestler who like killed his family and then killed himself or whatever.

526
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:21,068
Scott: And I don't know I didn't read the story and nor do I like pro wrestling.

527
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:21,650
Scott: I could do a show.

528
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,917
Scott: No, why I hate pro wrestling.

529
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:29,743
Rym: It's weird because that story came up Unrelatedly in a discussion about autism that I was reading on farm autism.

530
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:35,860
Scott: Yeah, don't don't ask I don't know if it's a story where they cured the autism in the rats.

531
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,261
Rym: Yeah.

532
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:39,470
Rym: Yeah, I didn't read the articles about this murder.

533
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:49,889
Rym: I just knew about it because someone referenced it and they claimed that the Daughter or whoever was killed in addition to all this had mental problems and that might have been part of the reason.

534
00:33:51,351 --> 00:34:04,527
Scott: Well, anyway, like I saw headlines over people's shoulders on newspapers on the train and he was like trying to link You know the steroid use of the pro wrestling guy to the murder somehow and I was like what the fuck How does steroids link to a murder?

535
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:12,735
Rym: Well Actually, it is possible that it could have been a contributing factor if it is true that he was taking steroids Which we don't know.

536
00:34:12,755 --> 00:34:14,946
Scott: I'm pretty sure you they found steroids in the house.

537
00:34:15,005 --> 00:34:15,649
Scott: I know that much.

538
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,750
Scott: Yeah, and there are no pro wrestler does not take steroids.

539
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:22,810
Rym: There aren't too many people who keep anabolic steroids around, you know, just as a decoration.

540
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:35,357
Scott: Yep And the that caught the steroids being recently in the news in combination with us recently discussing many times the relationship between good sport and Spectators sport.

541
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:42,630
Scott: I think we should discuss Steroids and sports because yeah, I know rims opinion differs slightly from mine.

542
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:47,469
Rym: Well, the thing is my opinion is fairly complicated and yes, I don't have an answer opinion.

543
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:50,288
Rym: I have a. I feel this way in this way in this way in this way.

544
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,996
Scott: Yep well let me summarize the situation here.

545
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:58,477
Scott: you have a sport and a sport is a competition of athletic ability.

546
00:34:58,557 --> 00:35:17,288
Scott: in some fashion, you know and Basically in a perfect sport, you know as if like if a sport was like a German board game a perfect sport Whoever had the best physical prowess and skill in that particular area Would win and whoever had less physical prowess and skill would win less,

547
00:35:17,308 --> 00:35:21,950
Rym: you know I'd step back a bit and I don't think it necessarily has to be a physical competition.

548
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:23,375
Scott: It's a sport.

549
00:35:23,476 --> 00:35:24,479
Scott: It's a physical competition.

550
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,303
Scott: Otherwise, it's a game.

551
00:35:26,025 --> 00:35:27,290
Rym: I don't make that differentiation.

552
00:35:28,113 --> 00:35:30,190
Scott: Well, we're not gonna argue about semantics.

553
00:35:30,277 --> 00:35:40,758
Scott: No You're not gonna let me pull up the definition in the on the dictionary want to talk about Sport then like sport could be like all sorts of you know, the other definitions of sport Yes, like just having fun.

554
00:35:40,778 --> 00:35:44,937
Scott: You can make sport of something exactly and that's not the kind of sport I'm talking but it's perfectly valid.

555
00:35:45,258 --> 00:35:48,190
Scott: Yes, but that's obviously when you say this is goddamn it.

556
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,374
Scott: I'm gonna talk about this now.

557
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:53,546
Scott: now when someone's some words in the English language have multiple definitions, right?

558
00:35:54,048 --> 00:35:57,372
Scott: Like for example Wake.

559
00:35:57,733 --> 00:35:59,821
Scott: the word wake could mean what.

560
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:04,177
Scott: you know that thing after before our funeral where you look at the body Also mean wake up in the morning.

561
00:36:04,217 --> 00:36:11,458
Scott: Yeah, if I say oh it's time to wake up Obviously, I'm using one definition and not the other.

562
00:36:11,578 --> 00:36:15,289
Scott: you can't make a semantic argument claiming that I was using the other definition of.

563
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:27,880
Rym: however In the case of sport It's very much relevant because you use the word and the definition you arbitrarily chose in order to just eliminate All these other things that other people maybe using the word sport.

564
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,066
Scott: I should say athletic competition every time.

565
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:30,969
Rym: Yeah, that's fine.

566
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:40,440
Rym: No Anyway So I think the only the issue I take is I agree with define a term and then use sport from then on and that's Fine because you can use that definition of sport.

567
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,270
Rym: You can pick a definition and go with it.

568
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,530
Rym: That's how civilized people argue.

569
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:50,750
Rym: The issue I take is that a lot of people call things that aren't athletic non sport as a way of trivial izing them.

570
00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:54,950
Scott: No, no, just because I don't say that something's trivial because it's not a sport.

571
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:55,834
Scott: I do.

572
00:36:55,995 --> 00:37:01,258
Scott: I do recognize most people do make the argument Like that's not a sport like crickets.

573
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:01,499
Scott: not.

574
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:04,227
Scott: as for trying to say it's lesser than football.

575
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:06,106
Rym: I wouldn't say many people I'd say most people.

576
00:37:06,146 --> 00:37:11,027
Rym: Yes There is definitely a negative connotation of game as opposed to sport in the wider American community.

577
00:37:11,388 --> 00:37:16,490
Rym: as a result I will not use the definition you were using of sport because I don't want to play into that.

578
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,012
Scott: I think we see.

579
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:25,905
Scott: that's exactly why I use my definition of sport to separate things that are Physical from the non-physical because a game like chess, you know is not a sport.

580
00:37:25,945 --> 00:37:29,790
Scott: It's it's a game you play on a table As opposed to a physical thing.

581
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,817
Scott: but the reason is two different words game and sport.

582
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:44,363
Rym: but yet I would put forth that in the Context of the argument we are about to have and the situation at hand The differentiation doesn't matter because the exact same arguments can be applied to non-physical activities.

583
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:46,830
Scott: Ah, that is case in point.

584
00:37:47,752 --> 00:37:51,705
Rym: Drugs to increase performance mentally during a chess competition.

585
00:37:51,785 --> 00:37:53,190
Scott: Yeah, I guess I guess all right.

586
00:37:54,213 --> 00:37:59,130
Rym: I have often been known to drink copious amounts of Red Bull before an important board game or some counter-strike.

587
00:37:59,310 --> 00:37:59,712
Scott: All right.

588
00:37:59,752 --> 00:38:04,634
Scott: All right, we'll do with that now, but basically the thing is I've discovered For him.

589
00:38:04,654 --> 00:38:14,255
Scott: Yes I've discovered recently that if you have a sport and you try you want the sport to be as fair and as true a Competition as possible.

590
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:17,870
Scott: That's like the spirit within me says let's have the real sport.

591
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:32,846
Scott: You know Like if you have a like some sort of like if someone makes a bad call Even if it's for the team that I'm not rooting for, you know in their favor or if it's in my team's favor I don't like a bad call because I want the sport to be fair and perfect in some way.

592
00:38:33,007 --> 00:38:43,168
Scott: unless it's hockey unless it's hot You know I want it to be a fair game and I want the best man to win or the best team or the best woman or Best the best side needs to win.

593
00:38:43,228 --> 00:38:45,849
Rym: Yep Now here I think is the biggest issue at stake.

594
00:38:46,656 --> 00:38:48,450
Rym: We're saying the best and you're saying a pure sport.

595
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:56,250
Rym: But at that point that means that you have to analyze whatever you're trying to test figure out What is the thing you were trying to test in this competition?

596
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:00,630
Rym: Yeah, are you trying to test purely athletic ability purely skill a mixture of the two?

597
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:16,750
Scott: Well, you know if you're using hockey you're testing ability to skate skate quickly skate dexterously to handle the puck, you know the puck dexterously to Bump into people and you know have strategic maneuvering of your guys but skill of your goalie at blocking.

598
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,495
Rym: You're also testing teamwork.

599
00:39:18,535 --> 00:39:19,478
Rym: You're testing tactics.

600
00:39:19,498 --> 00:39:23,268
Rym: You're testing the system that allowed the team to buy the players.

601
00:39:23,308 --> 00:39:31,955
Scott: They wanted Yep You're testing all sorts of things and whoever passes the combination of those tests and in you know The greatest fashion should be the winner.

602
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:42,865
Scott: the problem is when you have a sport that is so perfectly tuned It becomes very quickly Boring to spectate case in point formula one.

603
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:55,184
Scott: for many years Michael Schumacher the greatest driver of vehicles go motor vehicles to ever live was an f1 racer and he won Just about every time he had the best car.

604
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:56,330
Scott: He was the best driver.

605
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,603
Scott: He would start most of the races in the front.

606
00:39:58,885 --> 00:39:59,630
Scott: He would take off.

607
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:04,123
Scott: Nobody could catch him and it was a. it was a very well tuned sport.

608
00:40:04,163 --> 00:40:12,010
Scott: the best person won and the second best guy came In second place just about every time for many many years and it was boring as all hell to watch.

609
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:16,410
Rym: Yep, well to take hockey or actually I think baseball is a better example because I think great exam.

610
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:24,946
Rym: I think baseball suffers from it the most and I think this is the sole reason Why I dislike baseball because I realized that I would like baseball a lot more if this weren't the case Yep.

611
00:40:25,371 --> 00:40:25,532
Scott: But

612
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:50,995
Rym: baseball like hockey the actual competition what it was testing on a base level was a bunch of things Teamwork the ability of batters the ability of pitchers the ability of base coaches the tactics of the team the put the makeup of the team the crowd's effect on the team all these sorts of things, you know dealing with conditions and Over time as baseball was played and played and played and played one by one These issues became moot.

613
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:56,577
Rym: the tactics of baseball are at this point 99% perfected.

614
00:40:56,677 --> 00:40:59,250
Rym: it's obvious what to do in any given situation.

615
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:07,309
Scott: The only variable is if you have some sort of incredible player in a certain spot in a certain situation Then you might want to try something risky.

616
00:41:07,691 --> 00:41:18,720
Scott: But even then you could just write a book and that says if this is the situation in your baseball game this inning this These players on base, you know This kind of person at bat then do this and it would.

617
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,311
Scott: you would be just as good as most major league managers with that Book.

618
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:31,030
Rym: so it came down now to mostly the ability of the players Physically, yep, but then as time went on human bodies start to peak.

619
00:41:31,311 --> 00:41:37,270
Rym: There's a point at which a human body is at as far as we know its maximum potential to do a given time.

620
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,381
Scott: You have the best possible baseball playing body.

621
00:41:40,441 --> 00:41:46,724
Scott: Someone could possibly have maybe you could be a little bit better But you're better enough that you're just incredible.

622
00:41:47,126 --> 00:41:48,270
Rym: and so yeah.

623
00:41:48,371 --> 00:41:56,080
Rym: So it gets to the point where the best pitchers are all Mostly identical in that there's there's not much competition left.

624
00:41:56,301 --> 00:42:12,899
Rym: the margins between a one player and another player are So slight physically that the actual outcome of the game Ends up coming down to the margins and the chance and the randomness as opposed to the skill of any given player Because the skills are all so similar.

625
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,750
Scott: granted, you know, that's why we had star players.

626
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:21,819
Scott: they're just the difference between a star player and a not star player is Actually pretty small.

627
00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:23,469
Scott: the thing is they're just that much better.

628
00:42:23,971 --> 00:42:40,710
Scott: You know there that then all the other people on average that those people do make the difference in Beating chance and helping the team win, but if you take even like the shittiest major league baseball pitcher There are so many light years beyond all the non major league pitchers.

629
00:42:41,231 --> 00:42:42,334
Scott: They're just amazing.

630
00:42:42,474 --> 00:42:46,966
Scott: and then the peep they're just not stars because someone else is a tiny bit more amazing.

631
00:42:47,307 --> 00:42:51,145
Scott: and that tiny bit more Amazingness is what makes them win and the other guy not win.

632
00:42:51,326 --> 00:42:51,970
Rym: now as a result.

633
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:55,339
Rym: There's no surprises in baseball other than the occasional.

634
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,858
Rym: Oh, well, he dropped the ball and something bad happened Which is relatively rare.

635
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,370
Rym: Nothing exciting happens in baseball anymore.

636
00:43:03,712 --> 00:43:04,577
Rym: I mean even home runs.

637
00:43:04,617 --> 00:43:10,166
Scott: look back in the day home runs were relatively Fences are way back and it was really hard to hit it all that way.

638
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:15,709
Rym: and also I mean the science of training human to swing a bat was not where it is today.

639
00:43:16,171 --> 00:43:17,034
Rym: There was a lot of just.

640
00:43:17,234 --> 00:43:19,461
Rym: I mean Babe Ruth was a big old fat guy.

641
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:19,902
Scott: Yep.

642
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:23,513
Scott: He sure was nowadays an amazing fat guy But the fat guy nonetheless.

643
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:31,756
Rym: the science of training someone to swing a bat is so advanced that home runs Because home runs are just trivial.

644
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:36,230
Rym: They have been often and once a game at least yeah, and they're not exciting anymore.

645
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:41,525
Scott: Also the science of pitching and throwing a ball fast and with accuracy has progressed so much.

646
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:45,029
Scott: if Babe Ruth had to face today's Pitchers, he wouldn't do so.

647
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,310
Scott: Well, he'd be in big trouble.

648
00:43:47,093 --> 00:43:49,903
Scott: And the only reason to play the batters we have today don't.

649
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:53,629
Scott: if they were back in Babe Ruth's time They would have hit a home run every time they were up.

650
00:43:54,231 --> 00:44:01,590
Rym: It's because pitching has changed so much and it's so perfect now So because the physicality has gotten so good we're left to rely on the tactics.

651
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:16,043
Scott: But the tactics are already known because the game itself is fundamentally very simple and as a result in the end Baseball is not exciting to watch because you don't see things happen like someone dropping the ball Someone throwing to the wrong base a suicide squeeze.

652
00:44:16,464 --> 00:44:18,230
Scott: It's basically by the book.

653
00:44:18,511 --> 00:44:27,598
Scott: You know exactly what everyone's gonna do and it all just comes down to these very very slight things that are not Exciting to watch or so interesting.

654
00:44:27,658 --> 00:44:31,750
Scott: It's just you know, they're playing the exact game exactly the way it should be played every time.

655
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:32,432
Rym: Case in point.

656
00:44:32,933 --> 00:44:38,870
Rym: I enjoy watching two twelve-year-olds play pickle much more than I enjoy watching an actual Major League Baseball game.

657
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,570
Scott: Yeah, and I think this is also why a lot of people like watching college football.

658
00:44:43,811 --> 00:44:57,237
Scott: they like watching college basketball and college hockey and college baseball more and more and more and Some major league sports is starting to stagnate in their popularity because if you go watch college football People are doing all sorts of funky plays.

659
00:44:57,518 --> 00:44:59,664
Scott: not every player on the field is the master.

660
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:03,050
Scott: all sorts of crazy stuff happens all the time Whereas in major league football?

661
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:11,185
Scott: it's you know, except if yeah, unless you ever no one tries funky plays because you're not allowed to and You pretty much have to do everything by the book.

662
00:45:11,246 --> 00:45:24,669
Scott: and you know Sometimes is exciting things mostly because some teams out there suck and just because football is a game in which crazy things can happen Despite amazingness, but it's it's not isn't entertaining as college football as the game goes.

663
00:45:25,911 --> 00:45:43,168
Scott: so because of this some people decided that To make the game more exciting to stand out from the crowd in which everyone is awesome It takes some steroids to gain that slight advantage to go from the better than most of the world to slightly better than everyone else playing.

664
00:45:43,188 --> 00:45:52,590
Scott: and People didn't like that because now it's sort of unfair again, you know We tried to make it so fair that we made it unexciting.

665
00:45:53,012 --> 00:45:57,730
Scott: So people tried to make it more exciting and thus made it less fair.

666
00:45:58,132 --> 00:46:13,245
Rym: But at this point and here's the interesting thing taking the steroids All right It's you're doing an artificial thing to your body to make it perform better Even though I don't think it's that much of a step beyond a lot of the other semi artificial things or training Regimes that people go through.

667
00:46:13,468 --> 00:46:26,949
Rym: Yep but what if someone is born who has a genetic defect that causes their body to create excess testosterone that gives a similar effect to take an artificial testosterone.

668
00:46:26,969 --> 00:46:30,624
Rym: if You say that people aren't allowed to modify themselves

669
00:46:31,006 --> 00:46:31,187
Scott: with

670
00:46:31,508 --> 00:46:47,128
Rym: steroids then what you're basically saying is that now the only true determiner of skill in baseball is going to be genetics and genetic freaks who have an Advantage purely based on their genes are the ones who will excel because they're going to be stronger than other people.

671
00:46:47,148 --> 00:46:51,700
Rym: Yep Well at the same time Testosterone and that sort of thing can be dangerous.

672
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,350
Rym: Are you going to encourage people to do something dangerous?

673
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:56,623
Rym: But yet what if someone is willing to take that risk?

674
00:46:56,703 --> 00:46:57,890
Rym: and it's a complicated issue?

675
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:04,198
Scott: Yeah, well first I want to say I do think people should be allowed to do to themselves Whatever they want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else.

676
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,090
Scott: Yeah, they want to take steroids and you go go nuts.

677
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:09,882
Rym: You did argue that people shouldn't be allowed to commit suicide.

678
00:47:09,923 --> 00:47:10,304
Rym: That's true.

679
00:47:10,565 --> 00:47:11,570
Scott: That's one thing you can't do.

680
00:47:11,711 --> 00:47:13,659
Rym: I disagree with that fundamentally, whatever.

681
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:23,508
Scott: We'll talk about that another time, but while you can do anything you want it goes back to the question of what are we testing and it seems that

682
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:24,170
Rym: people

683
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:33,690
Scott: At least in sports have generally agreed that you know in the Olympics We're testing the limits and abilities of the natural human body.

684
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:39,250
Scott: What can you do with your natural unmodified human body simply by training and practicing?

685
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:45,870
Scott: How far can you how far can you take it without you know using drugs or a robot suit or?

686
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,119
Scott: Special equipment or anything like that?

687
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,325
Rym: now at this point.

688
00:47:49,385 --> 00:47:50,370
Rym: What's the definition of human?

689
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:59,990
Rym: I mean, all right normal like you and me born We train our body as much as it can be trained without chemicals or anything Whatever and then we you know compete in the competition.

690
00:48:00,692 --> 00:48:03,358
Rym: What if someone is born genetically superior?

691
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,572
Rym: because at that point you're not testing the ability so much as of the person the individual Athlete?

692
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:12,728
Rym: you're testing their genetics plus the science of training them.

693
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:15,877
Rym: Yep So, all right not allowed to take steroids.

694
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:20,250
Rym: Am I allowed to engage in genetic modifications to get the same effect?

695
00:48:21,154 --> 00:48:24,130
Scott: It's a good question that nobody is bothered with yet because it hasn't happened.

696
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:27,490
Rym: All right, say they ban that you can't modify your genes artificially.

697
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:34,610
Rym: What if I set up a generation upon generation of people and breed them well with their consent to create?

698
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:37,390
Rym: People that would have the same effect as if I had done it artificially?

699
00:48:37,571 --> 00:48:39,882
Scott: I think people already have no problem with that.

700
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:41,490
Scott: as you can see from history.

701
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:52,150
Scott: There have been many you know sons and daughters of existing athletes who've become athletes yet again And then their sons and daughters also become athletes and they get better or worse over the generations.

702
00:48:52,230 --> 00:49:01,510
Rym: But I mean many sports families that have bred for sporting Oh, but I mean very specifically and scientifically breeding for athleticism over many generations.

703
00:49:02,114 --> 00:49:04,550
Rym: How is that different from doing it artificially?

704
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:12,409
Scott: It's I think it just comes down to the fact that you know over the years That we've played the sport.

705
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:20,290
Scott: Everyone who's played it has been not you know until recently I guess the past decade or so not artificially modifying their bodies.

706
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:32,090
Scott: so if you want to be able to compare you know fairly the Achievements of the people in the sport today to the people in the sport of yesteryear Then they have to do the same exact thing.

707
00:49:32,211 --> 00:49:33,466
Rym: But the rules are different.

708
00:49:33,547 --> 00:49:40,111
Rym: anyway A lot of things have changed in all the sports over the years in addition to that and also steroids have been around for a long Time.

709
00:49:40,613 --> 00:49:42,581
Scott: yep steroids have been around for a long time.

710
00:49:42,601 --> 00:49:45,070
Rym: There just weren't tests before that were easily available.

711
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:49,525
Scott: Yeah, but people weren't using sports steroids as a performance enhancer.

712
00:49:49,645 --> 00:49:55,750
Rym: actually more than a couple decades I've seen the argument that it's not that people are using the steroids that is making the issue.

713
00:49:55,850 --> 00:50:04,508
Rym: It's that they're using the steroids in conjunction with very scientific training regimens and that the training Regimens alone account for a lot of the ability we see today.

714
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:09,570
Rym: Aha that I mean the science of training an Olympic athlete is immense.

715
00:50:09,831 --> 00:50:17,070
Rym: It's kind of like f1 where it's almost more about the the scientists training this person or the engineers building and designing this car.

716
00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:18,597
Rym: Then it is about the driver.

717
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:19,260
Scott: Yep.

718
00:50:19,622 --> 00:50:21,009
Scott: Well the driver matters a whole lot.

719
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:24,016
Scott: F1 though, but yeah, there's.

720
00:50:24,036 --> 00:50:26,461
Scott: basically it comes down to what are you testing?

721
00:50:26,582 --> 00:50:42,489
Scott: and we've decided that you know in sports like baseball That earliest the commissioners and then those sorts of people have decided they are testing a non-chemically modified human beings ability to hit a ball and throw a ball and run around bases.

722
00:50:42,669 --> 00:50:51,070
Rym: fine Then I'll use genetics like a coordinator and Gundam seed to create the uber baseball, baby His arms are gonna be an extra six inches long super muscles.

723
00:50:51,331 --> 00:50:53,503
Rym: He's gonna have short squat legs cuz he doesn't need to run.

724
00:50:53,523 --> 00:50:54,609
Rym: He'll always hit home runs.

725
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:57,603
Scott: Hey, I guess that would be fair.

726
00:50:58,024 --> 00:51:00,579
Scott: I get I mean it's you know That's come up.

727
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,209
Rym: All right, so that's it.

728
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:09,610
Rym: Then why ban steroids for not banning that and also notice how we banned specific performance enhancers, but not other ones.

729
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,194
Rym: What's the line of performance enhancer?

730
00:51:11,495 --> 00:51:13,040
Rym: is Red Bull a performance enhancer?

731
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,550
Rym: There's clear clinical evidence that taurine is a performance enhancer.

732
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:21,430
Rym: Yeah, I think the the part of the actual reason I said performance enhancer a bunch of times.

733
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:29,805
Scott: Yes It would be difficult to actually convince me that you know Sporting commissioners are actually thinking about this game theory type perspective that I'm thinking of.

734
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:31,290
Rym: That's the only thing that bothers me.

735
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:36,870
Scott: I don't obviously against steroids because they don't want to promote this sort of bad behavior.

736
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:41,849
Scott: They like their sports to appear clean and they want to promote their athletes as good role models.

737
00:51:41,949 --> 00:51:44,341
Scott: eat now No, and all that sort of notice God said appear.

738
00:51:45,004 --> 00:51:46,170
Rym: I don't think they care at all.

739
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:48,829
Rym: They would go steroids a hundred percent if that's where the money was.

740
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:57,490
Rym: but I think they see the negative public perception and also the negative pressure from the government and They don't want to go in those waters because they'd make less money or they get regulated.

741
00:51:57,802 --> 00:52:03,850
Rym: Yep I think that if the people had no problem with steroids and the government didn't care they jump on the steroids like that.

742
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:27,197
Scott: yeah, cuz I mean if they they would jump on the steroids and then basically they would be able to increase the entertainment value of their Sport for a time because some of the players would be on steroids and some would refuse but they would still be better than all the other players in the world and you would then again have a you know a Ability and the steroid players would be.

743
00:52:27,217 --> 00:52:35,642
Scott: there would be amazing plays happening again because of the gap of skill between the steroid users and The non steroid users, but at the same time everyone became a steroid user.

744
00:52:35,662 --> 00:52:37,650
Scott: then the sport would be boring again at the same time.

745
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:47,609
Rym: That's definitely a stopgap and a poor one at that because it seems like the fundamental issue Is that we have maxed out every aspect of baseball or a lot of games?

746
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,406
Rym: I mean like most German or most American board games.

747
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:57,164
Scott: Yep I'd say most board games in general games athletic or not have been maxed out.

748
00:52:57,404 --> 00:52:57,645
Scott: Yes.

749
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:23,635
Rym: So once a game is maxed out Other than stopgaps to force like to make players have more options like extending the game or something to try to make it more interesting Why not just change the game to add more complexity or add more points of contention in other places like take baseball Normal game but instead of the four bases have a branch network of braces going out the field Or something like that.

750
00:53:23,816 --> 00:53:28,850
Rym: multiple actually multiple paths home and a lot more decision-making on the fly on the field.

751
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,576
Scott: Well, I think two reasons for that.

752
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:34,009
Rym: first of all traditionalists traditionalist, uh, you know, what?

753
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:41,771
Rym: All ancient board games sucked all old card games almost without fail are Terrible.

754
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:50,113
Rym: the game theory and science is advanced to the point that we can construct better games that are clearly better on all levels Tactically strategically.

755
00:53:50,134 --> 00:53:50,474
Rym: Yep.

756
00:53:50,615 --> 00:53:57,869
Scott: Also if you're making millions of dollars because people are coming to see your sport if you change that sport Drastically, I mean changing a little bit.

757
00:53:58,211 --> 00:54:02,583
Scott: So it resembles the current sport enough that people still understand what's going on.

758
00:54:02,723 --> 00:54:09,865
Scott: hockey does that right, but if you change the sport Dramatically like you basically completely change the rules like blurns ball or something.

759
00:54:09,905 --> 00:54:15,776
Scott: if you suddenly change it to blurns ball People wouldn't come to see it because it's not something they're familiar with It's not something they know.

760
00:54:15,796 --> 00:54:24,410
Scott: the rules of like every time someone tries to come out with like Slamball or speedball or arena football or those things don't get a lot of attention.

761
00:54:24,513 --> 00:54:30,754
Scott: I mean You can't even get attention for soccer in the US because a lot of people just don't know how it's played or what the rules Are.

762
00:54:30,774 --> 00:54:31,321
Scott: they don't care.

763
00:54:31,342 --> 00:54:32,010
Rym: see now?

764
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:37,107
Rym: I think this is gonna change over time because the sports are less and less popular.

765
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:49,930
Rym: a lot for football American football is still stupidly popular and getting more but all the other I'm saying in the long run I think kids growing up are going to be less and less interested in sports Particularly because there's so much more entertainment on the internet.

766
00:54:50,211 --> 00:54:56,267
Rym: Yeah, that's possible and I could see new sports becoming popular in the next 20 to 30 years.

767
00:54:57,531 --> 00:55:01,210
Scott: Yep, the problem is is again a lot of our new sports, right?

768
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:06,809
Scott: if if we assume geeks are going to inherit the earth would be things like counter-strike and Puerto Rico and whatever.

769
00:55:06,829 --> 00:55:16,330
Scott: and those things remember are Perfect games basically of tests of skill and where we basically maxed out a lot of those things.

770
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:19,242
Scott: I mean fatality is just about maxed out FPSing.

771
00:55:19,362 --> 00:55:21,250
Scott: Yeah, there's just not too many of him right now.

772
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:32,810
Scott: there's one of him and there's some other people just as good as him who aren't as famous, but they're out there and South Korea has maxed out Starcraft completely and me Rym and Alex might have maxed out Puerto Rico.

773
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:33,695
Rym: We have to test it.

774
00:55:33,715 --> 00:55:34,379
Rym: We have a theory.

775
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,533
Rym: we think we've solved Puerto Rico Maybe.

776
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:51,145
Rym: well, we we've been close to it for a long time Yeah, but now we finally hit a situation where every time we play even trying different permutations We can see a clear path to who is going to win based on the first round of play.

777
00:55:51,366 --> 00:55:51,546
Scott: Yep.

778
00:55:52,168 --> 00:55:57,674
Scott: But anyway None of these are going to be very good Spectator sports.

779
00:55:58,157 --> 00:56:01,915
Scott: I mean if you want to make a good spectator sport You can you pretty much.

780
00:56:01,976 --> 00:56:04,226
Scott: the other end of the spectrum is the pro wrestling.

781
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:05,953
Scott: It's not a sport anymore It's just a show.

782
00:56:05,973 --> 00:56:07,137
Scott: It's no sport.

783
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,530
Scott: left is just designed to be appealing to spectators with nothing else.

784
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,485
Rym: I think you can make interesting sports.

785
00:56:12,505 --> 00:56:15,536
Rym: I mean things like Take paintball as an example.

786
00:56:15,677 --> 00:56:19,330
Rym: I think paintball could have been an amazing spectator sport.

787
00:56:19,571 --> 00:56:20,253
Scott: Mmm, it could be.

788
00:56:20,474 --> 00:56:30,926
Rym: the problem is paintball as it is played by paintball people is Incredibly boring and lame and it's just like this stupidly rules obsessed capture-the-flag crap game.

789
00:56:31,247 --> 00:56:31,408
Rym: Yep.

790
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:32,150
Rym: It's not fun.

791
00:56:32,251 --> 00:56:45,403
Rym: I've played it a bunch of times But say we took airsoft or whatever or counter-strike which is a fun game, but not the greatest spectator game And we made a sport that was counter-strike in the real world.

792
00:56:45,724 --> 00:56:47,410
Rym: You play paintball where it's interesting.

793
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:47,711
Rym: You know.

794
00:56:48,012 --> 00:56:58,386
Rym: go get that terrorists and they just film these athletes who train like Navy SEALs or SAS agents with guns And they go around and they do these things as a sport.

795
00:56:58,889 --> 00:57:15,910
Scott: Yep I think the the problems with that, you know You got to think about all these crazy factors Like, you know, how easy is it to film that for television like like football and hockey and baseball, you know They were designed or even if they weren't designed originally like football works so well with television.

796
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,137
Scott: It's it's a big wide rectangle.

797
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:20,824
Scott: The TV camera takes a big wide rectangle.

798
00:57:20,865 --> 00:57:22,389
Scott: You can see everything that's going on.

799
00:57:22,449 --> 00:57:22,670
Rym: hockey.

800
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:24,978
Scott: Not so much though hockey not so much really.

801
00:57:24,998 --> 00:57:28,793
Rym: that's probably I'd say that's that might be a big factor to why hockey is less Popular.

802
00:57:28,814 --> 00:57:30,769
Rym: it's just that people can't watch it on TV.

803
00:57:31,191 --> 00:57:35,626
Scott: That's a big factor in why football is so popular in the US because it is designed for television.

804
00:57:35,947 --> 00:57:39,783
Scott: like perfectly Watching on television is better than being there.

805
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:40,769
Scott: I've been there many times.

806
00:57:41,192 --> 00:57:45,918
Scott: Yeah, unless you're really close in just the right seats You're not gonna see a lot of stuff that God.

807
00:57:46,219 --> 00:57:48,587
Scott: the last you look up to the video screen for the replays.

808
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:52,637
Rym: the last NFL Game we went to we walked out Halfway through.

809
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:54,830
Scott: that was a really that was the worst football game ever.

810
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:58,546
Rym: Well, not only was it a it was a particularly boring game of football.

811
00:57:58,586 --> 00:57:59,410
Rym: It's a really bad game.

812
00:57:59,511 --> 00:58:00,580
Rym: It was like one degree.

813
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,750
Scott: It's a good football game.

814
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:05,446
Scott: Yeah, it is worth it to go to a good football game, but not that one good God.

815
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:07,719
Rym: even then I'd rather watch him on TV.

816
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,122
Scott: Yeah.

817
00:58:08,262 --> 00:58:13,808
Scott: Yeah, but yeah I think what we have to do is you have to come up with some sort of new sports that are both.

818
00:58:13,828 --> 00:58:20,104
Scott: that are Basically things that it'll take humans many many years to get really good at.

819
00:58:20,325 --> 00:58:31,170
Scott: even if we use performance enhancing Equipments of all sorts that way It'll still be a good game in which the best team wins or the best side wins depending whoever has the most skill and ability.

820
00:58:31,654 --> 00:58:46,728
Scott: But since we haven't figured it out yet and we won't figure it out for a very long time all sorts of interesting and exciting plays will still happen because People haven't figured it out yet and people mess up and people will try crazy things now and then and yeah It'll be way cool.

821
00:58:47,252 --> 00:58:50,203
Scott: And then when that gets boring we have to come up with something new again.

822
00:58:50,223 --> 00:59:00,620
Rym: now see if kids keep having Shorter attention spans which I can definitely feel my attention fan shortening the way I use me So short now compared to what it used to be.

823
00:59:00,921 --> 00:59:06,630
Rym: but if this keeps up I could see a time where we come up with a new sport a new game.

824
00:59:06,951 --> 00:59:11,082
Rym: It immediately becomes popular and successful and it's the sport that everyone's watching.

825
00:59:11,624 --> 00:59:21,270
Rym: and then it gets maxed out and they have the final Tournament of who is the best and then everyone just forgets it drops it and there's a new sport That could possibly happen.

826
00:59:21,631 --> 00:59:22,495
Rym: That's not that I see.

827
00:59:22,535 --> 00:59:23,719
Rym: that's the only way forward.

828
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:32,983
Rym: is you have to drop a sport or a game pretty much at the falling edge of the curve of its perfection like once it is solved?

829
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:42,836
Rym: and once it is solved to the point to where People can like most of the players playing have it solved to know exactly what to do and the game becomes predictable You drop it and move on.

830
00:59:43,117 --> 00:59:44,783
Rym: that's why we don't play most of the board games.

831
00:59:44,824 --> 00:59:45,627
Rym: We own we.

832
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:50,410
Rym: we solved them We figured out what they were at their core and there were no longer interesting.

833
00:59:50,852 --> 00:59:54,327
Scott: Yeah, we didn't continue to just keep playing them year after year to see.

834
00:59:54,347 --> 00:59:57,724
Scott: you know Who is the best because we were all equally the best.

835
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:58,950
Scott: we all solve the puzzle.

836
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:03,449
Scott: It all just comes down to the slight bit of randomness, you know, like in baseball the weather.

837
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:14,447
Scott: Well, you know if two equal baseball teams play at the same field and there's no the factors that determine who's gonna win are gonna be the weather and The random bird flying in front of a pitch.

838
01:00:14,628 --> 01:00:22,644
Scott: Yeah You know, maybe some dust getting kicked up here and there, you know the umpire making a bad call all these sorts of things you can't control.

839
01:00:22,684 --> 01:00:27,401
Scott: or what's gonna be the determining factor and That doesn't make for a very fun thing to watch.

840
01:00:27,903 --> 01:00:29,410
Rym: Well, at least not for people like us.

841
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:32,829
Scott: Yeah, you might as well roll a six-sided dice and see what size up.

842
01:00:33,613 --> 01:00:35,101
Rym: Die is the singular of dice.

843
01:00:35,322 --> 01:00:39,256
Scott: I know it bothers me Profoundly, that's why I do it.

844
01:00:39,798 --> 01:00:39,999
Rym: No.

845
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:40,742
Rym: No, I don't think so.

846
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,670
Scott: I think you just forget because I don't like the word die.

847
01:00:44,034 --> 01:00:45,659
Rym: Well, then always use it in the plural.

848
01:00:45,699 --> 01:00:47,705
Scott: you'll be okay, I just all right.

849
01:00:47,726 --> 01:00:48,508
Rym: we went on forever.

850
01:00:48,528 --> 01:00:49,170
Rym: I think we're done.

851
01:00:49,481 --> 01:00:59,049
