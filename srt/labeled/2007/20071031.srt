00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,507
Scott: It's Wednesday October 31st.

2
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:12,950
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:16,038
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,398
Scott: We review Apollo's song.

5
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:25,397
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:37,144
Scott: So driving home from the train station to the house and the traffic's going a little slow, and then I remember all right Trick-or-treating type people.

7
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:38,770
Rym: Oh snap Halloween.

8
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,459
Scott: Yeah, so I see you know some costumes like.

9
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:41,860
Scott: you know this.

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:48,429
Scott: I think there was a cat a little girl dressed as a witch Some girl wearing something I don't even know right.

11
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:51,680
Scott: and then I see this guy dressed up as the tin man.

12
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:58,472
Scott: You know from Wizard of Oz he's got two friends That aren't dressed up at all, and I'm like what the hell's up with that.

13
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,680
Scott: They're not dressed up as anything.

14
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,604
Scott: I'm like how does that work?

15
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:01,965
Scott: and is the?

16
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:03,673
Scott: it's only one guy getting candy.

17
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:05,965
Scott: the other two guys are just coming with them to Make fun of them.

18
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,820
Rym: cuz you know there's a lot of those punk kids.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,072
Rym: You'll just show up at your house not dressed up and say trick-or-treat.

20
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:13,320
Scott: Yeah, and I'll say yeah trick see ya.

21
00:01:13,722 --> 00:01:17,362
Rym: Yeah, of course knowing kids these days if I just burned down the house Maybe

22
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:24,518
Scott: but you know they look like three just average punk kids and only one was dressed up as the tin man And the others were nothing and nothing and I was like what the hell's going on.

23
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:32,465
Scott: Then I got closer, and I realized their costume was much more clever than I had Anticipated from afar in my car.

24
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:33,127
Rym: Oh really.

25
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:33,428
Scott: Yes.

26
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:34,330
Rym: What was it like?

27
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:36,577
Rym: the living statue from hot fuzz?

28
00:01:36,657 --> 00:01:37,660
Rym: and no some hoodies.

29
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:40,854
Scott: No, living statue my fuzz looks nothing like the tin man.

30
00:01:40,874 --> 00:01:45,471
Scott: I don't know man is just Gold man At all.

31
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:51,675
Rym: the tin man is not gold he's tin I know but close enough not even close especially in the fading light as you're driving home.

32
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:53,280
Scott: Maybe with your eyesight?

33
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:55,211
Rym: Yeah, anyway anyway.

34
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:56,659
Scott: He was not just up as a tin man.

35
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:01,979
Scott: He was dressed up as a keg and his two friends were just up his college party dudes.

36
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,972
Rym: I see what they did there.

37
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:05,100
Rym: It's still a cop-out.

38
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:16,958
Scott: It is a cop-out, but I am a fan of the cop-out costume because they think about it, right There are a million costumes out there that you can do that don't actually require any sort of out of the ordinary clothing.

39
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:22,100
Scott: for example Dress up as your favorite character from your favorite live-action TV sitcom.

40
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:24,486
Scott: You're wearing normal clothes most of the time.

41
00:02:24,948 --> 00:02:26,512
Rym: those costumes suck.

42
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,239
Scott: dress up that like I could die could go shave right now.

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,488
Scott: Put on blue jeans a white t-shirt and put my coat back on and it could be like hey I'm the Fonz just don't have to do anything.

44
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:42,399
Scott: and I like those kind of costumes because it's like yeah No one's respecting the people who don't have weird character design.

45
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:49,095
Rym: But that's that's only one step away from just saying I'm dressed up as a serial killer.

46
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,779
Rym: they look just like you and me.

47
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:52,004
Scott: Oh, that's a good one.

48
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:52,466
Scott: I like that.

49
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,213
Rym: I'd stolen from the Addams Family.

50
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:56,140
Scott: I didn't know that never saw that movie.

51
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:56,622
Scott: I did.

52
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:57,565
Scott: I just don't remember that joke.

53
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:57,746
Rym: Huh?

54
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:58,288
Rym: All right.

55
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,560
Scott: I actually do you ever see the second Addams Family where they're at summer camp?

56
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:04,951
Rym: No, yeah, don't okay.

57
00:03:05,454 --> 00:03:10,053
Rym: It can't be as bad as Earnest Rides Again, I never saw Earnest Rides Again.

58
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:13,807
Scott: I saw Earnest Goes to Jail and Earnest Earnest Goes to Camp.

59
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:14,631
Scott: Earnest Christmas.

60
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:16,300
Rym: No, no Earnest Goes to Camp.

61
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,950
Scott: I might have seen Earnest Goes to Camp if I did.

62
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,433
Scott: I don't remember it.

63
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:19,520
Rym: That's the Earnest movie.

64
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,988
Rym: All right, if there's any an Earnest movie to see it's that one.

65
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:22,530
Scott: None of them.

66
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:22,892
Scott: Okay.

67
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:39,600
Scott: But yeah anyway, it is indeed Halloween today as we record this and as we release this even though if not as you listen Which means if you did not know It's a day in America where kids dress up in costumes and go around stealing candy from unsuspecting people.

68
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:42,054
Scott: Oh, I guess foreigners might need to know that some of you.

69
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:49,007
Scott: Yeah Yeah, the first episode of GeekNights That was not a beta alpha episode.

70
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:57,362
Scott: the first actual episode that we put on public places for people to listen to Was put out on Halloween in 2005.

71
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:02,417
Rym: yeah, even though actually the first episode was uploaded on November 1st.

72
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:17,760
Rym: for November 1st, yep, and then like a week later I was going through audio stuff and I realized that the episode we'd done on the 31st because remember we Podcasted just for ourselves for a while to make sure we could do this and that it wouldn't be stupid.

73
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:21,240
Rym: I listened to it and we said something funny and I thought you know what?

74
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,227
Rym: I think this is good enough.

75
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:23,659
Rym: So I retroactively put it up.

76
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,780
Scott: So whenever you want Episode season 3 of GeekNights has or will soon begin.

77
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,635
Scott: also, I noticed I did a count of.

78
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:37,609
Scott: You know according to our WordPress I do.

79
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,700
Rym: I did a count and then you followed up later because you were dubious.

80
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:41,642
Scott: Yeah I didn't.

81
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:52,318
Scott: I used the SQLs and I looked at the database and I counted the number of database entries for Episodes that are in the podcast category and I just looked at the wordpress at the number of episodes.

82
00:04:52,338 --> 00:05:03,220
Scott: There are 399 or 400. so depending also on your particular taste This or maybe the next or the previous episode of GeekNights is the 400th episode.

83
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:08,557
Rym: Wow, we've done give or take about 400 hours of podcasting.

84
00:05:08,597 --> 00:05:15,455
Scott: So we're doing about 200 episodes a year because we've done two years and we've done 400 episodes.

85
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:16,699
Rym: seems to work out that way.

86
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:28,025
Rym: Yep, so at 50 weeks for episodes 200 now I think we originally had a bunch of plans for season 3 that you probably wouldn't have liked but we're kind of putting those on Hold because everything's going great.

87
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:29,812
Scott: Yeah, we missed you know, let's see.

88
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:31,960
Scott: So we're missing about two eight podcasts a year.

89
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,382
Scott: We miss.

90
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:33,729
Scott: that's not bad.

91
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:35,820
Rym: It's better than most podcasts.

92
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:38,431
Scott: Yeah, I mean you're only missing eight a year.

93
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:40,299
Scott: Most podcasts do eight a year.

94
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,338
Scott: So take that.

95
00:05:43,221 --> 00:05:49,282
Rym: But yeah season 3 is gonna be a lot like season 2 because we never bothered to change the music or anything and people seem To like it.

96
00:05:49,543 --> 00:06:01,800
Scott: Yeah, I mean maybe we'll change things but that'll mostly come season 4. obvious We'll change the show if things outside of the show change, you know, like if we get stupidly popular new websites, you know as stuff.

97
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:12,211
Scott: we're just gonna keep trying to move forward as much as we can and stuff will change organically as opposed to arbitrarily changing because the season changes even though I kind of like the idea.

98
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:17,860
Rym: originally the plan was that every season we were gonna change the Opener and the closer and the thing of the day music.

99
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:21,940
Scott: I didn't we say like a few months ago that we were gonna start only doing two episodes a week.

100
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,765
Rym: Well, I don't think we actually said that.

101
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:34,939
Rym: but our plan a while ago was to give ourselves a breather and to I guess prove To some naysayers that the show would be ten times better if we had the time to just like do it and not have to Do it every night.

102
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:45,400
Rym: We thought well every other week like one week will be Monday Wednesday the next to be Tuesday Thursday and the next to be one Day Wednesday again, and we might do that someday if we need a break or if we're working on stuff.

103
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,812
Rym: But we're not gonna do that now because we're on a roll here.

104
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:48,917
Scott: Yeah, I don't even do that right.

105
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:54,232
Scott: this second You know, I guess a few months ago I felt like doing it and I said oh I'll do it later and then it.

106
00:06:54,253 --> 00:06:56,221
Scott: now it's later and I don't feel like doing It.

107
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:58,168
Rym: so plus after those questions episode.

108
00:06:58,188 --> 00:07:01,160
Rym: We've got a good week and a half of extra content if we need it.

109
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,347
Scott: Yeah, we do that.

110
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:03,454
Scott: the questions episodes.

111
00:07:03,494 --> 00:07:04,360
Scott: I think are what we needed.

112
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,480
Scott: I think if we didn't do those we would have needed to do some two day a week business for at least a while.

113
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:11,900
Scott: All right, so it's a Wednesday episode.

114
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:15,619
Scott: We were thinking about doing like, you know scary anime or something, but we did.

115
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:24,485
Rym: well We realized you know Looking at what anime is out there that would be considered horror either by the Japanese or by the Americans and by either Accounting.

116
00:07:24,505 --> 00:07:26,321
Rym: there aren't that many Mm-hmm.

117
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:27,164
Rym: Also we haven't.

118
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:32,480
Rym: I mean, I guess I could talk about take the x-train because that was scary but not in a wasn't scary.

119
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:45,719
Rym: it was scary in the sense that someone somewhere wrote that and Convinced someone else to pay the money to have it animated and then someone else Convinced us at the RIT anime club.

120
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:46,885
Rym: That would be a good idea.

121
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:52,429
Scott: to show that to other people by that account then MD guys This is the second scariest anime ever.

122
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,906
Rym: MD guys is the second everything everything ever Not the second best anything.

123
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:02,866
Rym: I think it's the second best worst podcast podcast anime ever perhaps Perhaps?

124
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:05,220
Rym: no take the x-train is bad don't watch it.

125
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:11,265
Rym: But there's not a lot of horror and things that were called horror didn't work so well or didn't really fit like Vampire hunter.

126
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:12,230
Rym: D is not horror.

127
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,979
Rym: It just happens to have a vampire in it.

128
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,312
Scott: Yep All right, so we're just gonna do a normal episode for you.

129
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:19,340
Scott: cuz whatever this there's nothing real.

130
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,284
Scott: What are we gonna talk about?

131
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:20,947
Scott: That's scary.

132
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:21,912
Scott: We got nothing boo.

133
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:26,387
Scott: Oh We're not really scared by anything either.

134
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:30,080
Scott: it's like even like the the movie that scares you the most in your whole life.

135
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:32,308
Scott: I watch it and I'm just like whatever.

136
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,880
Rym: Well, that's cuz you're sad godless couch fuck.

137
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,902
Rym: That words been coming back into our lives I used to.

138
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:43,061
Scott: I was more scared of scary things when I was a kid who hadn't yet watched scary things and I was like Like.

139
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:47,740
Scott: I was afraid to watch alien because I heard it was so scary and it looked scary when I saw pictures of it.

140
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,952
Scott: I saw the box in the store in the box in the store was scary.

141
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:51,320
Scott: then I actually watched it.

142
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:53,400
Scott: I was like, alright, nothing scary anymore.

143
00:08:53,901 --> 00:09:00,703
Rym: I guess part I mean I grew up reading Stephen King books when I was really really young and watching slasher films because my mom's Really into horror.

144
00:09:00,763 --> 00:09:07,269
Rym: so I went through a period when I was young where there were scary movies That scared the ever-living crap out of me.

145
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,340
Scott: Oh, yeah, I was scared of that with the boogity man, mr Boogie, you know, that's the worst cuz that fits into anime.

146
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:17,367
Rym: You know a lot of people say that when they were young and they watched Prodigy a co They didn't get that.

147
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:19,560
Rym: it was a comedy and they kind of took it at face value.

148
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,667
Rym: Yeah when I was a kid and I saw mr.

149
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:24,076
Scott: Boogity that was that was scary.

150
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:25,300
Rym: I took it at face value.

151
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:26,913
Scott: I took it at face value when I was a kid.

152
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:27,800
Scott: I was scared.

153
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:35,494
Scott: I was so scared, but I've watched it a few years ago Beetlejuice - Beetlejuice didn't scare me as a kid, but it was scary.

154
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:37,080
Scott: I didn't realize it was a comedy.

155
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,127
Scott: I thought it was just sort of a freaky movie.

156
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:41,115
Rym: It was scary, especially as a kid.

157
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:42,439
Scott: some of it some of it.

158
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,064
Rym: Yeah, not as scary as mr.

159
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:48,296
Scott: Boogity, which really Boogity really scared me even the sequel bother.

160
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:51,970
Scott: No, remember we're talking like Elementary school like kindergarten action here.

161
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,778
Scott: Yeah, but I was like in middle school.

162
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,180
Scott: Mr Boogity was no longer the bane of my existence

163
00:09:56,381 --> 00:10:13,388
Rym: But I do find it interesting how we can see something like there are things that you expect to be taken on one level But through the eyes of a child in the case of mr Boogity goddamn or through the eyes of just someone who doesn't know about anime in the case of project a co You can almost take it in this innocent level.

164
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:16,938
Rym: That's totally different from what I guess an experienced watcher would get.

165
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,279
Scott: Yep All right, let's just get on with news and stuff.

166
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:26,820
Rym: Well, there is something scary on the internet and that is the collective output of all the webcomic people out there.

167
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,800
Rym: now I don't mean the web comics and I don't mean the good web comics.

168
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:34,520
Rym: I just mean kind of the blogosphere equivalent of web comic people.

169
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:48,300
Scott: So you mean pretty much every webcomic guy out there combined like the not any individual webcomic person Even though some of them would count but the the collective sum of like the vocal webcomic sort of community.

170
00:10:48,862 --> 00:11:01,680
Rym: Yeah, I even go one step further and say that this is this is the average webcomic or if you don't include I Guess the webcomic artists that are big and famous and popular big players like penny arcade and PvP and such.

171
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,924
Rym: yeah, even some smaller ones that are like friends of ours did or pretty just the average webcomic is about as good as the average blog.

172
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:17,893
Rym: that's just because that's the way it is and the average webcomic and the average blog Probably don't deserve an article on Wikipedia.

173
00:11:17,954 --> 00:11:19,599
Rym: Wikipedia is not.

174
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,366
Rym: well I'll get into that.

175
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:29,540
Rym: the story here Is that supposedly a bunch of webcomic artists are all in a tizzy in an uproar because Wikipedia had the sheer?

176
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Rym: Audacity to delete the completely fanciful and entirely non useful articles that they had written about themselves.

177
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:48,440
Scott: Well, I think the problem here the main point of contention is Wikipedia is notoriety policy, which They're basically saying, you know, there's some people out there who say Wikipedia shouldn't have a notoriety policy.

178
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,260
Scott: Let anyone make an article about anything no matter how insignificant and then we'll eventually have articles about everything.

179
00:11:54,381 --> 00:12:09,724
Rym: Well, the thing is the notoriety policy Actually does something very specific because everyone involved in the stupid argument forgets one thing The primary rule of Wikipedia is that there is no unverifiable or original research Period.

180
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:11,092
Rym: end of story.

181
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:20,380
Rym: if you can't find Something even somewhat legitimate somewhere else out there to cite and then paraphrase that then it doesn't belong in Wikipedia.

182
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:21,566
Scott: No, wait, but it.

183
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:24,560
Scott: but if I make a webcomic and I write my own article about it.

184
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,840
Rym: That's I am the primary source, but that doesn't work because that's self-referential.

185
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:31,920
Rym: You have to have a source other than yourself.

186
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:35,310
Scott: So what if someone interviews me and then writes a Wikipedia article?

187
00:12:35,691 --> 00:12:40,328
Rym: if someone interviews you and they themselves are also Noteworthy then.

188
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:40,692
Rym: Yes.

189
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:46,080
Scott: Ah So you need someone who is already on Wikipedia's or like an invite-only system.

190
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:48,574
Rym: Well, it's more like and it's not just one things.

191
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:52,920
Rym: even if you just have one source A lot of articles did get deleted because there's no point in having him on Wikipedia.

192
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:59,953
Rym: I mean if you're some blogger and you have a hundred readers Having a Wikipedia article is just a waste of everyone's time

193
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:06,120
Scott: and it's sort of like, you know The people are editing Wikipedia and I have to monitor your shit, you know, no one wants to look at your show.

194
00:13:06,381 --> 00:13:12,866
Rym: I think the real issue is that most of the articles about very small things like that are written by the people who do them

195
00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:25,950
Scott: and the only reason they have these articles is because they think that they're somehow gonna increase their Popularity through Wikipedia like they're gonna use it as marketing which it is not for that's like saying yeah I'm gonna get an article about me in a cyclopedia Britannica.

196
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,400
Scott: So then people I'll be more popular that way.

197
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:31,080
Rym: Yeah, but remember Wikipedia is like this tertiary source.

198
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:44,920
Rym: You're supposed to go to Wikipedia and from there everything you find on Wikipedia should have a verifiable reference somewhere else somewhere It's semi-legitimate and there are very an argument as to what constitutes legitimate and there are different sets of rules for different articles.

199
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,446
Rym: but I don't think any set of these regulations would make me think that a wet some small webcomic that's read by a few hundred People deserves a Wikipedia.

200
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:54,827
Scott: Yes.

201
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:55,529
Scott: I'm with you.

202
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:58,820
Scott: these small webcomics definitely do not deserve Wikipedia articles.

203
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,420
Scott: They're not notoriety They do not have any sort of notoriety.

204
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:07,860
Rym: But if Pluto is a planet then all those other little small things floating around are just as much planets.

205
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:17,856
Scott: Yeah, the but I do think that the Wikipedia, you know Notoriety policy is slightly subjective and could be fine-tuned, but I do think it should exist and is necessary.

206
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:48,058
Rym: Well the only problem we've ever run into it and it was kind of funny because after that there is this parsec award thing and anime world order Had a article written about them in Wikipedia and we also had an article written about us in Wikipedia at about the same time by the same person looks like they wrote a bunch of articles and Theirs immediately got deleted and ours didn't and the criteria that made us quote unquote noteworthy as opposed to them were flimsy at best.

207
00:14:48,843 --> 00:14:51,880
Rym: Uh-huh, and I found the whole situation kind of hilarious.

208
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:54,871
Scott: Yeah, I just really don't care.

209
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:56,799
Scott: It doesn't I don't care.

210
00:14:57,462 --> 00:15:04,959
Rym: I guess what really bothers me is that this guy who's he writes some webcomics, honestly I'm not just saying this but I've never heard of this guy or his webcomic.

211
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:11,060
Rym: But he was saying that people should stop donating to Wikipedia until they correct this problem.

212
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:15,112
Scott: Yeah, I pretty much every time Wikipedia puts that thing up there.

213
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:15,914
Scott: I donate something.

214
00:15:16,556 --> 00:15:17,980
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's just pocket change.

215
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,300
Rym: Yeah, but I don't know I guess anyone who's outraged about this think about it for a second.

216
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:31,020
Rym: If there's nothing about a webcomic other than the webcomic and their webcomic friends and maybe like an article on ain't it cool news?

217
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:33,380
Rym: That's not terribly know worthy.

218
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:41,200
Rym: Now say you were published in a newspaper or say you won some prestigious award like Fred G Lay.

219
00:15:42,387 --> 00:15:46,490
Rym: Fred G Lay Remember that you don't remember the reference to you.

220
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:47,715
Scott: What's Fred G Lay?

221
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:48,277
Rym: me Fred G Lay.

222
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:48,980
Rym: It's a major award.

223
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:55,119
Rym: Okay Italian, uh-huh Wow Christmas story when he wins the major award.

224
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:57,048
Scott: Yeah, I only saw.

225
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:58,880
Scott: I've never seen the whole movie really.

226
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:02,472
Scott: No It's always just like on on Christmas and I see parts pretty much.

227
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:05,242
Scott: the only thing I know about Christmas story is to shoot your Eye out kid.

228
00:16:05,402 --> 00:16:09,034
Rym: You've never seen one of the funniest movies ever made in English.

229
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:09,797
Scott: It's not that funny.

230
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:10,399
Scott: Yes it is.

231
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:14,830
Rym: I'm gonna have to ask our listeners to chime in cuz that movie.

232
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:19,918
Rym: the only way that movie is not funny is if you've already Seen it a thousand times that movie is gold now.

233
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:22,809
Scott: Anyway, you're not human and whatever.

234
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:24,015
Rym: All right, non-human.

235
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:24,999
Rym: What news do you have?

236
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,164
Scott: Speaking of webcomic not a human.

237
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:31,639
Scott: webcomics, you know for the most part until now have mostly been the domain of.

238
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:38,437
Scott: you know Sort of like, you know people know people on the street, you know some guys some anime artists someone.

239
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:40,760
Scott: they make a webcomic They make their own website.

240
00:16:41,443 --> 00:16:43,250
Scott: The you know some penny arcade guys.

241
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,540
Scott: they make a website they put up their own webcomic.

242
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,130
Scott: There isn't sort of any unified webcomic place.

243
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,489
Scott: Well, they're well there was key spot, which was I'm pretty sure let me see if it's still.

244
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:57,365
Rym: they were really big and a lot of people got their start there Keen spot.

245
00:16:57,405 --> 00:17:00,500
Scott: the website says still the best damn comics on the web.

246
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,403
Scott: I beg to differ.

247
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:02,667
Rym: a lot of comics are there.

248
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,558
Rym: a lot of fairly big comics are still there.

249
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:08,266
Scott: Yep there's a you know United whatever.

250
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:09,771
Scott: that syndication places.

251
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:16,020
Scott: that syndicates all the comic strips and they put all the Newspaper comic strips on their website like you comics calm.

252
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:24,140
Scott: But other than that, you know Most like Marvel and DC really or anyone like that has not ventured into the webcomic realm so much.

253
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,791
Scott: even the indie people have not ventured into the webcomic realm.

254
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:30,285
Scott: you don't see image or dark horse or Top shelf.

255
00:17:30,326 --> 00:17:32,598
Scott: they're not making webcomics until now.

256
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:33,803
Scott: DC.

257
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:38,517
Scott: they announced they were gonna do this a while ago, but it today it launched zuda comics.

258
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:39,320
Scott: calm, right?

259
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,615
Scott: Zuda comics calm and this website.

260
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,359
Scott: the way it works is.

261
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:47,180
Scott: They have one webcomic right now.

262
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,640
Scott: That is a ongoing webcomic called by you right and you can go there and read this comic.

263
00:17:53,263 --> 00:17:56,420
Scott: They also have ten other comics that are not ongoing comics.

264
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:11,776
Scott: they are current competitors and you can vote for these current competitors and there are ten come competing comics and if you like them you can vote for them and Whichever one wins will become the second ongoing comic.

265
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:19,580
Scott: And then there will be ten more competitors and the way this sort of works is you can actually submit comics.

266
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,268
Scott: But there's all these sorts of agreements And I'm not a lawyer and I didn't read.

267
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:26,804
Scott: the contracts are on the website for you to read and I did not read them In full.

268
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:38,756
Scott: but the impression I get from you know Glancing through them is that you make one comic for them for a limited amount of time and they own that comic that you make For them, but they pay you a good amount of money and they don't own you.

269
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:39,840
Scott: so you can do other things.

270
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:42,039
Scott: You know, they only own the one thing you're doing for them.

271
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:48,274
Rym: Well, if that's the case to be honest if you're someone with you know, moderate skill That's a great way to get a start.

272
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:56,000
Rym: make it Like say you have your a story in your B story Write your B story for them make some money and then use that to publish your a story on your own.

273
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,157
Scott: Yeah, I mean if your art is good and you think your comic is gonna get voted up you go submit it.

274
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:03,959
Scott: if they vote For it, you know, it'll be number one.

275
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:10,520
Scott: You'll probably get at some nice monies and you'll get your comic all over this and you have a big thing for your resume.

276
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:17,986
Scott: You probably have a probably an easy time of getting a job at least at an indie comic publisher with an ongoing real comic on Paper, you know, it's.

277
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:20,880
Scott: it's really not so bad as far as I can tell on the surface.

278
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:26,120
Scott: And if you're looking to read some webcomics, this ain't a bad place to go either.

279
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:29,837
Rym: You know, it's been a long time since I found a new webcomic to read.

280
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:33,893
Scott: Yeah I haven't read any of them, but I'm gonna try all these out and I'm gonna.

281
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:38,268
Scott: every time that someone wins the contest I'll you know, I'll come back and take another look.

282
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,734
Rym: cuz seriously what I mean.

283
00:19:39,854 --> 00:19:43,713
Rym: Wondermark is the latest comic We found and that was a while ago.

284
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:43,793
Rym: Yep.

285
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:44,115
Rym: Yep.

286
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:53,020
Scott: So yeah, if you're looking for webcomics ZUDA comics.com It's actually run by DC even though the DC logo is not anywhere on the way.

287
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,542
Scott: Oh, it's odd.

288
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:55,147
Scott: This is DC Comics in the bottom right?

289
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:58,940
Rym: I guess the real question is are they Wikipedia worthy?

290
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:07,346
Scott: I think that ZUDA Comics itself might be Wikipedia worthy, but I do not know about any Comics on ZUDA Comics.

291
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:11,080
Scott: They might just you know, note them on the ZUDA Comics page in Wikipedia.

292
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,165
Rym: Things of the day.

293
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:27,044
Rym: so this might seem like a cop-out but you know Like we've always said GeekNights is not really news But commentary.

294
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:34,927
Rym: and I have some commentary here because way back we did a couple of things of the day about the angry video game And how hilarious we found him.

295
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:41,290
Rym: and of course he had promised for a while now that on Halloween There would be a special episode and sure enough today.

296
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:47,880
Rym: He reviewed the Michael Myers game Halloween for the Atari 2600.

297
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,248
Rym: But you can watch that.

298
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:53,789
Rym: I'll link to that as my thing of the day, but I got to say Especially now that we have zero punctuation.

299
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,519
Rym: The angry video game nerd is starting to slip a little bit.

300
00:20:57,102 --> 00:21:08,120
Scott: I think his problem is that he still does his excellent video game reviews in his classic sense But he's sort of doing every review is the same as every other one just like oh look how crappy this game is.

301
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:08,945
Scott: It's a piece of shit.

302
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,520
Rym: Well, the reason for that is that he's been doing Atari games.

303
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:15,440
Scott: I know I with the last good one he did was the Silver Surfer, which is amazing.

304
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:24,466
Scott: He just spent the whole episode Doing what he's good at reviewing the Silver Surfer and how terrible it is and saying quotable things like, you know The difficulty is legendary.

305
00:21:25,028 --> 00:21:28,540
Rym: I think his problem now is that he's try in the in the Ramah Sharma.

306
00:21:28,702 --> 00:21:30,059
Rym: He is trying to do too much with it.

307
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:34,639
Rym: When you try to do too much with it, I get the point He is trying to do too much of it.

308
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:46,300
Rym: You are correct because much like the previous one half the video was just some sort of live-action moderately funny Video and the other half of it was the hilarious him reviewing these games.

309
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:52,580
Scott: Yes, but I mean he reviewed three games in the latest one right in addition to the corny live-action bit.

310
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,931
Rym: I think the problem is with Atari games.

311
00:21:55,453 --> 00:22:01,077
Rym: There isn't more than about 35 40 seconds worth of review no matter how in-depth you go.

312
00:22:01,097 --> 00:22:06,596
Scott: Yep especially Atari games where it's just do the same thing over and over again get higher score because there were better.

313
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:09,045
Rym: most of them there Were better Atari games.

314
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:11,958
Scott: like you could do a review of an adventure that would take more than 30 40 seconds.

315
00:22:12,662 --> 00:22:14,679
Rym: Not really because there's only one or two jokes.

316
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,438
Rym: There's a big duck.

317
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:18,063
Rym: Nothing makes sense.

318
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,890
Scott: Somebody get this freaking duck away from me.

319
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,311
Scott: Haha.

320
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:21,375
Rym: Oh clever.

321
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:22,238
Rym: I see what you did there.

322
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:24,907
Rym: Yeah But I don't know.

323
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:33,039
Rym: I feel like he's slipping and I hope I think his main strength was that he used to do NES games or you know Sega games that had all this nostalgia.

324
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:37,794
Rym: and There's not so much nostalgia for these very rare Atari guys.

325
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:42,087
Scott: Well the rare ones no No, there's not really much nostalgia for rare games.

326
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:46,920
Scott: See the one exception for say et it which he's been teasing for a while.

327
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,576
Rym: Well, remember when he did all those Swedish sex games for the Atari.

328
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:52,298
Scott: That was a good one.

329
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:53,102
Rym: That was great Cuz.

330
00:22:53,142 --> 00:22:55,440
Rym: he just did a bunch of yes good nice one.

331
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:58,330
Rym: I don't know if he doesn't get back to where he is.

332
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,180
Rym: I think the zero punctuation is gonna be my new thing.

333
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,785
Scott: well, I think another thing is the Angry video game.

334
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:05,554
Scott: nerd makes releases sporadically.

335
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,860
Scott: you can't trust him, you know.

336
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,135
Scott: But yeah, I think the zero punctuation guy.

337
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:09,880
Scott: I think he's weekly.

338
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:10,985
Scott: I got a look.

339
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:14,280
Scott: but I'm pretty sure he's weekly and I'm pretty sure he's getting paid money by the escapist.

340
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:15,987
Rym: Oh, he'd better be I think so.

341
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:17,413
Rym: So we should get him on the show.

342
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:18,356
Scott: Oh, he's awesome.

343
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,220
Scott: He might talk too fast.

344
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:21,552
Rym: I have a filter for that.

345
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,020
Scott: Yeah the filter make him talking too fast.

346
00:23:24,384 --> 00:23:25,719
Rym: Be like that micro machines guy.

347
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:31,639
Scott: You know, it took me a day after I discovered him to realize he was called zero punctuation because he talks so fast.

348
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:37,142
Rym: That's kind of like when you came to me one day and you're like I get it Beatles.

349
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:38,727
Rym: it's spelled with an a like beat.

350
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:40,612
Rym: Yeah instead of an e like bug.

351
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:41,314
Scott: How's that?

352
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:45,822
Scott: I Never realized the pun before Right.

353
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:46,707
Rym: So what do you got for me?

354
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:54,515
Scott: Oh, so, you know, I I like to Meet, you know get in conversations with you know, middle-aged or older people people much older than myself.

355
00:23:54,675 --> 00:24:05,105
Scott: I especially Scott Johnson You know, especially at nerd conventions, you know I try to question them out to ask what you know geekiness was like in the olden days and it always.

356
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:15,552
Scott: you know comics is one of the older geekeries and You know, I always end up asking him what kind of comics they read and without Exception they all read uncle Scrooge every last one of.

357
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:22,794
Rym: as we learned from our foreign listeners when we asked about comics Uncle Scrooge is pretty much the best and most popular comic in the world.

358
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:33,860
Scott: Uncle Scrooge Donald Duck all that stuff I mean freakin I think in you know in in northern Europe in general, you know, Sweden Norway It's oh you mean the concentrated cool part of the world.

359
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:42,920
Scott: Yeah As far as I can tell in that part of the world like more people subscribe To Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge comics and subscribe to the newspaper.

360
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,032
Scott: so Regardless uncle Scrooge is awesome.

361
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:55,500
Scott: If you have not read an uncle Scrooge comic Well, first of all, if you liked DuckTales DuckTales was incredibly faithful to uncle Scrooge comics.

362
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:59,471
Scott: So if you like that, you'll like uncle Scrooge comics.

363
00:24:59,492 --> 00:25:00,354
Scott: You should go buy some.

364
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:03,145
Rym: you should also watch tailspin But that's beside the.

365
00:25:03,406 --> 00:25:05,640
Scott: all Disney afternoon was sort of the same deal.

366
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:07,118
Scott: If you like one you like them all you know.

367
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:13,140
Scott: And I recommend you get this book called the life and times of Scrooge McDuck by Don Rosa.

368
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:19,360
Scott: You can get that book and if you like it, you should get the life and times of Scrooge McDuck companion by Don Rosa.

369
00:25:20,843 --> 00:25:21,558
Scott: There's also.

370
00:25:22,962 --> 00:25:33,619
Scott: I have two volumes of Carl Barks greatest DuckTales stories which is the original comics the DuckTales episodes are based on and those are also awesome because that's what Don Rosa based his thing off.

371
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,049
Scott: and Regardless read uncle Scrooge comics.

372
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:36,571
Scott: They're awesome.

373
00:25:36,852 --> 00:25:37,194
Rym: All right.

374
00:25:37,254 --> 00:25:38,720
Scott: So what's my thing of the day?

375
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:53,574
Scott: Yeah, my thing of the day is this guy from Northern Europe no less who made a scale model of the money bin as Laid out in the comics down to the finest detail.

376
00:25:53,714 --> 00:25:55,640
Rym: It's a pretty impressive.

377
00:25:55,941 --> 00:26:06,410
Scott: I mean you've seen models that impress, you know, you see someone make a really cool Gundam or someone makes like You know a six-foot tall Gundam or something like that or some garage kid that just blows you away.

378
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:07,934
Scott: There's all kinds of.

379
00:26:07,995 --> 00:26:10,546
Scott: you know, some guy makes the Death Star model.

380
00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:11,410
Scott: that's way cool.

381
00:26:12,431 --> 00:26:14,720
Scott: This is one of the coolest models I ever seen.

382
00:26:14,861 --> 00:26:17,170
Scott: this is this is hot shit and it all comes apart.

383
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,538
Scott: But and it's it's perfect in every way.

384
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:21,264
Scott: It's pretty much here.

385
00:26:21,284 --> 00:26:26,709
Scott: This is the money bin only Smaller than the real money bin, but it's exactly right.

386
00:26:27,573 --> 00:26:31,290
Rym: Well, you know for all we know Scrooge McDuck is just you know an inch and a half tall.

387
00:26:31,571 --> 00:26:38,350
Scott: It could be that whole world model the model being in Northern Europe is not too far from Scotland, but I don't think.

388
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:42,020
Scott: But I don't think Duckburg is actually in Scotland.

389
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,110
Scott: It is actually, you know in the United States somewhere, but whatever

390
00:26:47,816 --> 00:27:02,504
Rym: Right, so we were inspired to do this partly because I finished the comic but also because uh some friend podcasters reviewed it not too long ago and I Kind of think that they missed the point of this entire manga

391
00:27:02,985 --> 00:27:04,290
Scott: Oh rims doing a challenging.

392
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,577
Rym: I think I am doing a challenging thing.

393
00:27:06,657 --> 00:27:18,270
Rym: I think that someone out there who reviewed Apollo's song by Osamu Tezuka not too long ago Missed the boat in one critical regard in that being loveless people.

394
00:27:18,651 --> 00:27:24,450
Rym: They decided that it was about how horrible love is and I really have to take issue with that.

395
00:27:24,932 --> 00:27:42,210
Scott: Yeah, first of all, I want to say another reason we're reviewing this right now is because Mu mw, you know mu by Osamu Tezuka is just become available from vertical comics Which is a vertical ink which is the same people who published this Apollo song volume.

396
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:43,877
Rym: You should probably buy that.

397
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:46,890
Scott: if I buy that my copy should be coming in the mail in a week or so.

398
00:27:47,412 --> 00:27:53,374
Scott: And they also just announced that they have license for America all of the blackjack manga Which is.

399
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:57,234
Scott: you should buy that also and this is you know It's sort of like.

400
00:27:57,254 --> 00:28:01,317
Scott: hey if we review this and we get you to like this Then it'll get you to buy these other things.

401
00:28:01,357 --> 00:28:03,003
Scott: maybe that are if you like one.

402
00:28:03,103 --> 00:28:06,910
Scott: if you like Tezuka you're gonna from vertical You're gonna like the other Tezuka from vertical, you know.

403
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:20,759
Rym: The one thing I can't disagree with is that when those other people reviewed this they talked about how special the opening Chapter of Apollo's song was and I must say it is quite Fantastic.

404
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:23,320
Scott: Yeah He has something like that.

405
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,469
Rym: I was rather impressed.

406
00:28:26,692 --> 00:28:28,430
Scott: Tezuka is not being too subtle here.

407
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:34,490
Scott: I mean, I I read this only once and I pretty quickly and it was you know more than a month ago.

408
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,058
Scott: So I don't remember all the details.

409
00:28:36,078 --> 00:28:38,530
Scott: the Rym is gonna remember because he read it all like a couple weeks ago.

410
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:41,940
Scott: But yeah, there's no way you'll forget the opening bit.

411
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:45,843
Scott: God do you want to describe it?

412
00:28:46,388 --> 00:29:03,748
Rym: Well, Imagine if you took the battle for dominance that semen under sperm undergo when they're fighting the way toward an egg in order to fertilize it and you anthropomorphize that and you replace the semen with cavemen.

413
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:06,388
Scott: well anthropomorphizing.

414
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:09,579
Scott: Well anthro replies sort of animal I guess.

415
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:11,164
Rym: no it don't realize.

416
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:12,507
Rym: that means to make human.

417
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:23,951
Rym: Ah Okay, fine Hahaha Sure Whatever what Rym said it's the same as say you talk to your computer you get mad at your computer and you your computer's mad At you.

418
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,739
Rym: it is not really mad at you.

419
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:26,562
Rym: You're just making that up.

420
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:28,570
Rym: You're projecting your humanity onto the computer.

421
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:30,195
Rym: It's just a cold lifeless thing.

422
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:30,938
Rym: What are you crazy?

423
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:31,339
Rym: Yep.

424
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,185
Rym: All right, it has no feelings.

425
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:48,749
Scott: No, it is much better Alright, so after that opening bit which is sort of metaphorical and very important I might add and important that this I'll give you the Literal what what the rest of this is as opposed to the metaphorical right?

426
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:53,370
Scott: So you have this guy Shogo and Shogo is not the greatest dude.

427
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:56,900
Scott: Basically, he lived a life of you know badness.

428
00:29:57,221 --> 00:30:05,466
Scott: His mom was what like a dirty whore doing all kinds of guys and you know, it's not really clear if she was a prostitute or simply a loose woman.

429
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:09,603
Scott: either way She was doing lots of guys who were not his dad.

430
00:30:09,623 --> 00:30:11,030
Scott: He didn't really have a dad.

431
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:12,094
Rym: They were all his dad.

432
00:30:12,134 --> 00:30:13,399
Rym: I mean, that's the bearded dad.

433
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:14,222
Rym: That's the fat dad.

434
00:30:14,624 --> 00:30:18,500
Scott: Uh, yeah, right Yeah, none of them were his real dad.

435
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:20,110
Scott: None of them were like a father to him.

436
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,810
Scott: He didn't have a father figure in his life in the classic sense

437
00:30:23,312 --> 00:30:25,861
Rym: And in addition his mother was kind of abusive and

438
00:30:25,921 --> 00:30:27,587
Scott: by quite quite abuse by

439
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:29,153
Rym: kind of I mean Extremely

440
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:29,735
Scott: abusive

441
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:34,310
Rym: beat him with a broomstick in such a way to have basically conditioned him to hate all love.

442
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:38,144
Scott: Yeah, and you know cuz pretty much anytime he encountered love in his life.

443
00:30:38,164 --> 00:30:39,650
Scott: It was brought with pain.

444
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:44,086
Scott: So as a result, this is a man who kind of even a man he's not even like.

445
00:30:44,347 --> 00:30:44,808
Scott: he's young.

446
00:30:44,848 --> 00:30:46,702
Scott: he's young He's maybe adolescent.

447
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:54,150
Rym: Yeah Yeah, effectively freaks out every time he encounters anyone in love or anyone showing effect.

448
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:59,670
Scott: He'll even like walk down the street and if like he sees two birds like cuddling he'll freak out and like he'll kill the birds.

449
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,522
Scott: He's also abusive to animals in general.

450
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:01,945
Scott: Well, that's the.

451
00:31:02,066 --> 00:31:06,330
Rym: that's the start I mean, he's basically abusive and torturing toward animals.

452
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:16,558
Scott: So they arrest him and take him to a mental institution and the mental institution is very Classic mental institution, you know, the was that Classic at mental institution.

453
00:31:16,578 --> 00:31:19,270
Scott: Okay, sort of like one flew over the cuckoo's nest style.

454
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:22,210
Rym: Yeah, I mean their their immediate treatment is well.

455
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:26,090
Rym: Well electro shock the hate out of him as we all know works wonderfully.

456
00:31:26,432 --> 00:31:27,436
Scott: Oh, it works perfectly.

457
00:31:27,476 --> 00:31:29,485
Scott: every time turns nutty people into perfect.

458
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:36,815
Rym: gentlemen now This is where the comic I guess really begins because during this electroshock therapy He has a vision.

459
00:31:36,835 --> 00:31:38,322
Scott: I have a vision.

460
00:31:38,342 --> 00:31:42,138
Rym: I Have a vision of a manga.

461
00:31:42,158 --> 00:31:44,130
Rym: that's kind of depressing perhaps.

462
00:31:44,950 --> 00:32:11,990
Rym: basically, he's entreated upon by what I guess you could call a goddess or a god some sort of deity a statue something and He is told that he is going to be punished for his crimes against love by forevermore repeating the cycle of Falling in love with someone or having someone fall in love with him and then one of the two of them or both of them Dying in some horrible way before they can consummate their love or truly be happy.

463
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:17,151
Scott: Well now the structure of the rest of the manga follows directly from that vision He had.

464
00:32:17,212 --> 00:32:25,645
Scott: basically it alternates between the quote real world or the present world Which is the world in which he is Shogo Chikashi.

465
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:34,550
Scott: I think his last name is Shogo something Shogo and you know, he's in the mental institution and where he goes from there immediately without you know And it's just direct right?

466
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:51,010
Scott: so every other chapter is him in that you know default world and every other chapter where it is sort of You know Tezuka likes to do this a lot where he'll have sort of like the same Characters in like some other setting, you know, it's not really the same characters exactly.

467
00:32:51,050 --> 00:33:06,369
Scott: It's like reincarnations of those characters and it's sort of like, you know Imagine if you go to see a play and you know It's like the and you see the play and an acting troupe puts on the play then, you know The next week and it's the same acting troupe putting on a different play.

468
00:33:06,871 --> 00:33:17,290
Scott: so it sort of alternates to these other plays other stories of you know falling in love and then Dying horribly and never actually getting to live out your wonderful love and tragedy.

469
00:33:17,852 --> 00:33:19,677
Scott: But with the same actors.

470
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:25,857
Rym: it gets confusing at first just because you feel like The world you were presented with was a lie.

471
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:26,680
Rym: and there's all this stuff.

472
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,770
Rym: and it's once you get back to the the original.

473
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:33,890
Rym: You know, he is Shogo again after the first interlude you started.

474
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:36,910
Rym: I guess it grounds it and it makes more sense from that point forward.

475
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,998
Scott: Yeah, it's like it goes from the mental hospital.

476
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:41,046
Scott: And then I think it's like World War one or two.

477
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:42,050
Scott: It's a war in Germany.

478
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,374
Rym: It's a World War two.

479
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:46,063
Rym: is it because they're rounding up Jews in box.

480
00:33:46,184 --> 00:33:47,187
Scott: Okay, cuz I didn't.

481
00:33:47,207 --> 00:33:48,070
Scott: I haven't read it recently.

482
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,637
Scott: I'm just flipping through it to try to remember.

483
00:33:49,657 --> 00:33:50,522
Scott: so I didn't remember it.

484
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:50,783
Scott: Yeah.

485
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:55,385
Rym: Well the chapters are I'm looking at Wikipedia here D Blumen und delete.

486
00:33:55,446 --> 00:33:56,230
Scott: Oh, I got the carrot.

487
00:33:56,632 --> 00:33:57,999
Rym: Yeah flowers and the corpse.

488
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,705
Rym: Shogo has a vision of Nazi era Germany And of course falls in love with one of the girls who was in the boxcar.

489
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:05,607
Rym: He is transporting it.

490
00:34:05,648 --> 00:34:06,390
Rym: It ends in tragedy.

491
00:34:06,732 --> 00:34:08,241
Scott: No, I wonder what kind of tragedy?

492
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:11,077
Rym: and it goes on from there and I guess it.

493
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:22,206
Rym: what I could think what Tezuka was doing is Each of these stories while they might seem out there and some people remark that Maybe he was just kind of using up extra stories that he had to fill this out.

494
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,050
Rym: and that may have been true.

495
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:27,094
Rym: but each one kind of puts forth a Situation.

496
00:34:27,196 --> 00:34:28,489
Rym: it's kind of like a moral dilemma.

497
00:34:28,591 --> 00:34:31,646
Rym: You know when you're trying to argue with someone about morals and you always set up the.

498
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:35,989
Rym: well What if there was a car and it was gonna go off a cliff?

499
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,896
Rym: You could save the people by shoving a fat man in the way But then the fat man would die.

500
00:34:40,257 --> 00:34:46,529
Rym: and you kind of set up a specific situation to test a very specific Moral idea and have a nation about it.

501
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:52,734
Scott: and then you set up multiple moral dilemmas and you get the person to decide one way on one and one way on the Other and you say haha.

502
00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:55,045
Scott: Look you have an internal moral contradiction.

503
00:34:55,366 --> 00:34:56,230
Scott: You're not consistent.

504
00:34:56,552 --> 00:35:00,249
Rym: Well, that's not what I usually do but now that can be fun that it that is fun.

505
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:01,410
Scott: But

506
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:12,369
Rym: this kind of does that at each one of these lives he lives and I do like how about halfway through each one You completely forget about his real life and you care a lot more about this fake

507
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:26,350
Scott: life Especially when reading the Queen Sigma chapter that that whole chapter was like a whole it when I was reading that I Kind of forgot it wasn't like a chapter of Phoenix almost and then I go back and I'm like, oh right nutty guy I was in the present.

508
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:39,390
Scott: I was very surprised when the the Queen Sigma part ends and then he's back in the real world again Cuz Queen Sigma like could have stood on its own as an awesome sort of future manga about love and tragedy.

509
00:35:39,551 --> 00:35:49,214
Scott: Well, I think they all kind of stand on their own except for one I guess the one problem last one which sort of requires, you know, the two the one that's two before that And the one that's two before that.

510
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,382
Rym: Well, I guess that could be counted as one together.

511
00:35:51,543 --> 00:35:51,904
Rym: Okay?

512
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:53,430
Rym: Yeah now again, we're avoiding spoilers.

513
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:58,098
Rym: I'll say this if you think we've spoiled anything Seriously, don't worry because this thing.

514
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,545
Scott: All right, this book right is.

515
00:35:59,585 --> 00:36:02,296
Scott: how many freaking pages 541 pages.

516
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:02,780
Scott: this is one

517
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:15,809
Rym: of those situations where How they get there and is a lot more important than what they do when they get there And the journey is a lot more than the end and even if you know how it ends That's really not going to affect it too much.

518
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:23,543
Scott: And I mean if you if you understand anything about literature at all You could see how it's gonna end right from the get-go.

519
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:28,745
Scott: as soon as that statue says, you know You're gonna fall in love and then have tragedy all the time.

520
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:33,170
Scott: and then you read a short story Where there's love and tragedy and you then you go back to the main story.

521
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,139
Scott: Then you're another story of legend love and tragedy.

522
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,670
Scott: I wonder how the main story is gonna end.

523
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:47,556
Rym: Well, the thing that really struck me was that I was told by this comic right away that it will always end in tragedy And yet I never saw it coming.

524
00:36:47,777 --> 00:36:52,775
Scott: No, I think the thing was is that while it always ended in tragedy They mix it up.

525
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:56,070
Scott: It's not like the same Romeo and Juliet tragedy every time it's a little different.

526
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:01,758
Scott: You know, sometimes they die this way or sometimes dead unexpectedly or you know You don't know the timing of it.

527
00:37:01,798 --> 00:37:05,309
Scott: because you have this giant volume in front of you You don't know where each chapter begins and ends.

528
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:06,938
Rym: Well, I think it's also just that.

529
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:09,793
Rym: I think this is one of Tezuka's Brilliances.

530
00:37:09,914 --> 00:37:13,570
Rym: is that even though you it's a foregone conclusion what's going to happen?

531
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,667
Rym: Hope is dangled in front of you and you always feel like there's a way out.

532
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:19,113
Scott: Oh constantly I was.

533
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,217
Rym: just how about it gets?

534
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:22,406
Rym: you always think it'll be okay.

535
00:37:22,426 --> 00:37:23,410
Rym: They'll make it this time.

536
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,872
Rym: The one

537
00:37:23,912 --> 00:37:24,072
Scott: thing

538
00:37:24,253 --> 00:37:24,374
Rym: they

539
00:37:24,394 --> 00:37:37,285
Scott: were one thing that carried me through this book is I was always holding on to this Hope no matter which chapter it was that the insane guy was gonna become a good Person in the end and everything was gonna be okay, and he was gonna be uninsane.

540
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:38,268
Scott: because they keep.

541
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:42,364
Scott: you know He keeps making progress and he keeps moving forward.

542
00:37:42,404 --> 00:37:43,890
Scott: and you know, he sees things.

543
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,341
Scott: He doesn't completely change his ways, but he's getting better.

544
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:47,587
Scott: and I'm like at the end.

545
00:37:47,607 --> 00:37:50,169
Scott: He's gonna get better He's gonna learn a lesson from all these different things.

546
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:50,411
Scott: Well,

547
00:37:50,471 --> 00:38:09,162
Rym: especially the fact that this when he's in these alternate visions he doesn't have any memory of who he was and Notice that when he doesn't have the memories of his abusive relationship with his mother and his you know bad childhood He is a pretty normal person who makes I mean, he's still himself.

548
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:10,767
Rym: It's just without those memories.

549
00:38:11,268 --> 00:38:12,478
Scott: He's kind of an ass He's not like.

550
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:18,941
Rym: no he is an ass But I think he would have been an ass even if his mother hadn't beaten him with a broomstick Repeatedly and denied him the true knowledge of love.

551
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:21,190
Scott: Yeah, but well, he says he's written by Tezuka.

552
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:24,413
Rym: Yeah, but even then despite being an ass I mean, he's still he.

553
00:38:25,275 --> 00:38:34,349
Rym: it doesn't have this problem except in the real world when he has this bad upbringing kind of holding him back, yep, and This is where I really took issue with I don't know.

554
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:38,102
Rym: Daryl Sarad and Gerald wrath called the Clarissa when they talked about this.

555
00:38:38,704 --> 00:38:39,306
Rym: Oh, man.

556
00:38:39,427 --> 00:38:43,488
Rym: Oh, there was a spoiler Just because you know, they they talk about how.

557
00:38:44,494 --> 00:39:07,708
Rym: Well, I'm not gonna talk about what they said but basically I think that Apollo's song is an Incredibly strong testament to the power of love and the importance of love and a lot of people read this especially with the opening scene and the closing scene which kind of comes full circle and I don't think it's a spoiler to say that you'll see the parallels of how it was all a cycle in the end.

558
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:12,109
Rym: and the Very opening scene has much in common with the very ending scene.

559
00:39:12,912 --> 00:39:31,386
Rym: But I guess there's this idea that if you read it kind of superficially love is bad or love is this thing that is thrust upon us by biology and as a result were forced to live this cursed existence or love is just a biological thing to force us to breed and continue existing or anything like that.

560
00:39:31,406 --> 00:39:35,448
Rym: and we know we talk about testing to set up all these moral dilemmas.

561
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:49,250
Rym: and Very specifically the Queen Sigma segment is set up in my opinion to show that all along the way You could always use the excuse of oh well biology forced them to this that one specifically says that that's not true.

562
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,322
Rym: And I think that's where the true moral of this work comes out.

563
00:39:52,945 --> 00:39:55,689
Rym: because remember well I guess remember if you've read it or not.

564
00:39:56,091 --> 00:39:58,198
Rym: But I'm gonna make a minor spoiler here.

565
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:04,950
Rym: Queen Sigma and all these Synthians do not have Genitals and do not engage in sex ever.

566
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:11,838
Rym: They have no need of sex to reproduce at all and they make that clear Continuously throughout that chapter.

567
00:40:11,858 --> 00:40:14,830
Rym: Yep, and yet love still blooms.

568
00:40:15,352 --> 00:40:22,970
Scott: Yeah, Queen Sigma is all like crazy in love with this guy Even though like she can't control herself even and he's like, ah get away from me you crazy bitch.

569
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:42,910
Rym: And I guess the real moral of this I mean without the Queen Sigma segment You could easily say that Tezuka's writing was basically saying that love is this horrible biological impulse that leads off into tragedy that we have no power over but with that segment and with that one Simple thing that one dilemma set up where it shows that biology is not the only factor.

570
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:47,462
Rym: I think what it's saying is that no matter how bad it gets love always blooms.

571
00:40:47,502 --> 00:40:49,930
Rym: that love is the most powerful force ever.

572
00:40:50,293 --> 00:40:52,290
Scott: Even says so much at the end of the book.

573
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,519
Scott: He says between man and woman male and female.

574
00:40:54,559 --> 00:41:02,970
Rym: without that love the history of the human race would have ended long ago And you could say oh, well, yes, obviously because without that they wouldn't have made babies.

575
00:41:04,191 --> 00:41:14,326
Rym: There's a lot more to it than that and I guess you have to really read this work Fully and kind of think about it or else to come away with a really superficial understanding of it.

576
00:41:14,566 --> 00:41:14,747
Rym: Yep.

577
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:31,001
Scott: Also If you read like what Tezuka had to say about it, you know, he was really sorry It was this was written in a day That was very like student movement kind of times, you know in Japan mostly and there was a lot of It's sort of a sex education kind of thing.

578
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:44,150
Scott: in a way and I think you know from that Perspective Tezuka was trying to say and he wasn't teaching you how to do it this, you know in the cold Scientific way, but he was sort of saying, you know, you know sex and love should kind of go together.

579
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,582
Scott: You don't you don't want just sex without the love.

580
00:41:46,743 --> 00:41:50,287
Scott: or you know love with you know And love without the sex is also sort of not so good.

581
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:51,775
Rym: Well, I don't know.

582
00:41:51,815 --> 00:42:05,061
Rym: if he's saying that too much then you say I think all he's saying is that love doesn't conquer all and that love will not allow you by in and of itself to survive or to Create or to beat your the odds and win.

583
00:42:05,743 --> 00:42:07,530
Rym: but love is more important than winning.

584
00:42:08,212 --> 00:42:10,079
Rym: Mmm, and cuz that happens every time.

585
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:11,364
Rym: all these stories are kind of.

586
00:42:11,685 --> 00:42:14,930
Rym: they say look at this love bloomed Anyway, and it got snuffed out.

587
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:18,388
Rym: but people always held on to love before they held on to anything else.

588
00:42:18,408 --> 00:42:21,585
Rym: and then the without Queen Sigma that would have been lost.

589
00:42:21,646 --> 00:42:26,430
Rym: on the fact that It goes beyond that and says that love has nothing to do with biology in the long run.

590
00:42:26,591 --> 00:42:36,630
Scott: Yep, and also in a way he's saying, you know If if without if without love things will end then if things are still going on then love must still be there somewhere.

591
00:42:37,412 --> 00:42:39,410
Rym: So, I don't know what else more we can say.

592
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:43,427
Rym: I mean, I don't want to spoil how each one of these segments ends other than the obvious.

593
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:51,330
Scott: Yep We could talk about how it relates to the you know, legends of Apollo, but that's kind of very specific thing in the story.

594
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:53,209
Rym: Yeah, I almost feel like it'd be out of place.

595
00:42:53,712 --> 00:43:03,599
Scott: I recommend though if you read this because I didn't know that any stories about you know The mythology of Apollo before reading this and it's incredibly relevant Can do what he was doing.

596
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,926
Scott: does it Apollo song?

597
00:43:04,946 --> 00:43:07,715
Rym: for a reason Doesn't it lay it near the end?

598
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:10,784
Rym: pretty much re-relate that one story of Apollo.

599
00:43:10,804 --> 00:43:13,090
Scott: I think it does pretty explicitly.

600
00:43:13,312 --> 00:43:15,830
Scott: I know I didn't know the story of Apollo said you realize what it was doing.

601
00:43:16,332 --> 00:43:19,723
Rym: Well Apollo did many things but yeah many things.

602
00:43:19,783 --> 00:43:24,750
Scott: but just go read, you know on the internet It should be easy to find stories of you know, Greek mythology and stuff.

603
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:35,830
Scott: Just read you know about Apollo read like a synopsis read about Apollo and the Laurel Yeah, and then read this book and you'll go A lot more than you would otherwise.

604
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:40,207
Rym: I guess a lot of people review this and say that and I'm not talking about anyone in particular.

605
00:43:40,288 --> 00:43:43,489
Rym: seriously now Just that they people don't look upon.

606
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:47,790
Rym: This is one of Tezuka stronger works and a lot of people much prefer many of his other works.

607
00:43:47,810 --> 00:44:00,130
Rym: so they say that this one's depressing or on Tezuka or not characteristic of his writing and I Really think that those people just didn't get it and that it's actually not a pessimistic work at all.

608
00:44:00,713 --> 00:44:06,830
Scott: No, this is a this is a terrific work And if you know any other thing is it compared to Tezuka's other works?

609
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:29,215
Scott: I actually you know while it may not be representative of his greater body of work in many ways You know I like it more because it lacks a lot of though It doesn't have as many random comedic panels and it doesn't have you know A lot of those other things that Tezuka works have that it sort of make them You know less serious like even ode to kira hito Which is the most similar to this.

610
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,425
Scott: one had a lot of those random silly panels all over the place.

611
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:33,569
Rym: also human tempera.

612
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:44,224
Scott: Yeah, human tempera and this had some of that, you know, it's never gonna be completely devoid But it was really lacking and it was sort of like, you know You read Phoenix and your is the serious parts.

613
00:44:44,244 --> 00:44:51,170
Scott: There's not so serious parts It's it's like just the serious part sort of like in Buddha, which was mostly just serious parts.

614
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,789
Scott: but this I think is the greatest percentage of just seriousness.

615
00:44:54,809 --> 00:45:03,717
Scott: and Because I read those other manga, you know of Tezuka's mostly for the serious side and the corny jokes are okay once in a while But most of the time I ignore them.

616
00:45:03,777 --> 00:45:05,970
Scott: So this was really up my alley.

617
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:10,160
Scott: And if you like the serious side of Tezuka stuff this is also up your alley

618
00:45:10,481 --> 00:45:20,768
Rym: and I guess what I could say is that our opinion that this is an optimistic work and that it is very much in line with what Tezuka tends to write about and That other people may have misinterpreted it.

619
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:28,262
Rym: We I could cite countless examples from the work and so could Scott probably if he thought about it Even though he hasn't read it in a while, but I just read it again.

620
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:35,536
Rym: I'd be like, ah, yeah The only reason or not is that I don't want to spoil those things because those are much closer to the story and they'd kind Of ruin it for you.

621
00:45:35,898 --> 00:45:48,310
Rym: Yeah, I guess the Queen Sigma I mean the fact that she doesn't have genitals is probably the strongest piece of evidence But there's a lot more when her face changes at one point and that's actually a really powerful scene.

622
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,780
Scott: Yep, if you've actually if you've read brave new world.

623
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,069
Scott: that chapter will also make a lot of sense more to you.

624
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:56,135
Rym: Yes, it will All right.

625
00:45:56,175 --> 00:45:57,665
Scott: So yeah, do we want to say anything else?

626
00:45:58,007 --> 00:45:58,329
Rym: I don't know.

627
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:00,126
Rym: I hope you're all enjoying your Halloween.

628
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:05,409
Rym: sadly It's more difficult for us to enjoy Halloween now that we're not in a college campus.

629
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:08,497
Rym: Halloween is on a Wednesday.

630
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:08,758
Scott: Yep.

631
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:09,842
Scott: It's okay.

632
00:46:09,863 --> 00:46:17,484
Scott: So Oh Samu Tezuka Apollo's song it's 1995 from vertical incorporated.

633
00:46:17,584 --> 00:46:18,470
Rym: it's well worth it.

634
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:23,035
Scott: You should be able to get it on Amazon probably for less than 1995 Which is the cover prep.

635
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:25,470
Rym: and seriously don't listen to what everyone else says about it.

636
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:28,721
Rym: Just read it and if you disagree with us tell us I wouldn't.

637
00:46:28,821 --> 00:46:31,249
Scott: I would not recommend this as your first Tezuka though.

638
00:46:32,074 --> 00:46:38,128
Scott: Ah first Tezuka, I'd say read Phoenix Yeah Read a Phoenix or a Buddha or something like that and then read this just.

639
00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:41,829
Scott: you know You want to be familiar with Tezuka before you read this one that you do.

640
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:50,288
Rym: After all, where else would a woman have just randomly built a cage in which she sleeps just in case There's a crazy love killer around?
