1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,007
Rym: It's Monday, August 27th.

2
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:12,990
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:18,018
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight fantasy cell phone.

4
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,377
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:30,819
Scott: Not much is happening lately.

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,889
Scott: Just a lot of video game playing again.

7
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:38,010
Scott: So I got a new video card today, which I have yet to install.

8
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:41,289
Scott: So I kind of want to hurry this show along so I can go install it.

9
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:43,376
Rym: Yeah the tide is kind of turned over the years.

10
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:49,558
Rym: Scott and I keep leapfrogging each other and computers and currently I Am way ahead and Scott's computer is old and slow and busted.

11
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:59,387
Scott: Yeah, basically I realized I could either get a new computer now or I could upgrade my computer something I've never really done before because it's always been better to just buy a new one.

12
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:27,151
Scott: and Since I use my laptop for most a lot of business these days anyway I could just upgrade the computer to the point at which I Could probably play the orange box games that are gonna come out really well And I won't have to worry about upgrading it again for like a hajillion years More like three years, but I basically I upgraded the RAM a while ago from half a gig to two gigs and now today I'm upgrading the video card from an Nvidia 5900 to a 7600 GT.

13
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:30,934
Scott: so That leaves me.

14
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:35,767
Scott: the only weak link is the processor but processor not so much needed.

15
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:36,610
Scott: I think it'll be fun.

16
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:39,310
Rym: Well, I mean the video card is not an optimal solution.

17
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,370
Rym: It's just that those super good high-end 79 hundreds that are also really cheap aren't really available anymore.

18
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:47,730
Scott: Yeah, uh, that's what people are saying.

19
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,430
Scott: But I think it's kind of like whatever because the 86 hundreds are like $100 or 200, you know, they're not expensive.

20
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:58,502
Scott: Yeah only the only expensive cards are the stupid crazy cards that nobody needs.

21
00:01:58,582 --> 00:02:08,321
Scott: because from what I hear people are playing the crazy Bioshocks and things like the full-on settings would just fine Resolutions and things and they got no problems.

22
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:09,666
Scott: and those are like with 7,000 cards.

23
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:15,127
Scott: So the people with the 8,000 cards are already overboard and so the people with the $500 cards are double overboard.

24
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,933
Scott: I don't know what the hell game they're playing but Suit themselves.

25
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:20,897
Scott: I really don't care.

26
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:23,606
Scott: they fell for the hype and they got money to burn.

27
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:23,767
Scott: go nuts.

28
00:02:25,092 --> 00:02:28,606
Scott: My computer is gonna last me a long time and I barely spent any money on it.

29
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:35,029
Rym: Yeah granted I'm just a not and I I really can't deal with any change in frame rate while I'm playing an FPS.

30
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:37,559
Scott: somehow I doubt I'm gonna have a change in frame rate.

31
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:46,120
Scott: from what I hear other people who have the same CPU as me Which is an Athlon XP 2500 have no problems with like the latest awesome game.

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,381
Scott: Yeah.

33
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:46,903
Rym: Well, we'll see.

34
00:02:46,943 --> 00:02:49,330
Rym: I mean, I'm not sure benchmarks are all over the place.

35
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:51,480
Scott: I wasn't having problems.

36
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,410
Scott: So I'm not gonna have problems with even better video.

37
00:02:53,531 --> 00:03:00,070
Rym: Okay, when I stood behind you watch you play Counter-Strike source It slowed down a lot when you went around corners or smoke grenades got thrown anywhere.

38
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,719
Scott: I think you're just crazy and you have a psychological issue.

39
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:05,107
Rym: No, it was a pretty clear drop in frame rate.

40
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:09,611
Rym: it go I Problems.

41
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:10,696
Scott: it's smooth for me.

42
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:11,961
Scott: I was playing it just fine.

43
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:12,925
Rym: Yeah, maybe you got that.

44
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,089
Rym: you're not so good.

45
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:16,741
Rym: I'm shooting people as I did a natural selection.

46
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:18,409
Rym: I was uh, kicking your ass.

47
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,514
Scott: You're even kicking my ass.

48
00:03:19,554 --> 00:03:22,950
Scott: the team game first of all second of all is kicking quite a bunch of asses.

49
00:03:23,363 --> 00:03:32,140
Rym: Yeah except I remember one moment when I was sitting there and I'm a little gorgeous and you ran up with the machine gun and You emptied a whole clip and didn't even hit me.

50
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:42,980
Scott: and first of all I hit you plenty and second of all that pretty much all that has to do with is your offense tower finished and We didn't have any upgraded weapons at that point.

51
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,186
Scott: Yeah, so what was gonna?

52
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:45,050
Rym: you know, you didn't hit me.

53
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,870
Rym: You just kind of shot near me and I just kind of my screen.

54
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:48,556
Scott: I was hitting you.

55
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:48,777
Scott: I had.

56
00:03:48,798 --> 00:03:50,330
Scott: you were hitting me on my screen.

57
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,550
Scott: The gun was in your butt and those little yellow stuff going.

58
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:56,813
Rym: I was facing you and I wasn't taking any damage You weren't it?

59
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,645
Scott: when on my screen you were facing into the offense tower.

60
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:04,030
Rym: Uh-huh So well the fact remains that you died and I had full health.

61
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,193
Scott: Yeah, what are you gonna do?

62
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:09,045
Rym: kill you and then destroy the marine commander base?

63
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:10,730
Scott: Yeah, the thing is natural selection.

64
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,201
Scott: It's like FPS skills.

65
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:18,821
Scott: while they matter You know, especially early in the game You can't really say oh you died because of me and NS.

66
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:19,764
Scott: therefore I'm better than you.

67
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:20,426
Scott: FPS is cuz.

68
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:24,329
Scott: it's so much a team Game and so much depends on so many other things more.

69
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,779
Rym: Let's play some one-on-one counter-strike.

70
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,602
Rym: a counter-strike.

71
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:29,589
Scott: one-on-one is not an FPS of skill.

72
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,061
Scott: It's not a game of FPS skill.

73
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:37,968
Scott: if you want to play a game of SPS skill We have to play like some quake - let's play some doom - deathmatch doom - is not the 3d.

74
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:42,550
Rym: We can play that Jen mod of quake - we could do that.

75
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,339
Scott: That's a good - person.

76
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:44,480
Scott: it.

77
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,430
Scott: the thing is there really aren't too many good - people.

78
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:47,896
Scott: I think ricochet is the only good.

79
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:50,950
Rym: Oh, man ricochet was such a good game, but no one plays it.

80
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,794
Scott: It's the only good.

81
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,341
Scott: two people FPS out, you know what?

82
00:04:53,522 --> 00:05:00,270
Rym: whenever we have a free weekend in free time I think we're gonna try to get everyone all our friends in steam all you listeners to play ricochet.

83
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,578
Scott: Why don't we just keep talking about video games and tech day?

84
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,225
Scott: We got no tech to talk about fine.

85
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:10,804
Rym: So speaking of pornography Perfect, I don't know how many of you know about Australia though.

86
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:13,222
Rym: I know we have a lot of listeners there so I'm sure you can attest to this.

87
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:27,230
Rym: but Government is a little bit puritanical sometimes a little bit right-wing sometimes They ban quite a few video games and movies and they try to block porn and make porn filters and all sorts of things.

88
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,770
Scott: But it's not so great for the freedom of creativity and speech and such.

89
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,496
Rym: There's a story here on slashdot.

90
00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:43,690
Rym: now it links to a blog and I didn't really research the actual story So I can't say a hundred percent if this is actually true because I generally don't trust these blogs much.

91
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:48,226
Rym: But the point of the story regardless of whether or not this specific instance is true.

92
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:52,243
Rym: I'm pretty sure it is Is more that this will happen no matter what.

93
00:05:52,645 --> 00:06:05,930
Rym: so Australia has this 84 million dollar internet porn filter that they paid 84 million dollars for and Apparently a year 10 Australian kid cracked it in about 30 minutes.

94
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:10,630
Scott: Oh, I read that story, but it didn't say it was like the Australian national filter.

95
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,070
Scott: He said it was like it was like a local school filter.

96
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:17,290
Rym: Yeah, but the article still says 84 million dollar internet porn filter.

97
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:22,557
Scott: Yeah, the point is is that Kids filter always get around.

98
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:26,787
Scott: a porn filter filtering the internet doesn't work no matter what period.

99
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:27,348
Rym: I mean.

100
00:06:27,368 --> 00:06:27,930
Rym: think about it.

101
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,410
Rym: China can't even keep the internet completely locked down.

102
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,095
Rym: How is Australia going to?

103
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:33,540
Scott: it's not gonna.

104
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:45,935
Scott: people who have a school one school with one Single fiber optic cable leaving the school and all internet traffic going along that cable can't filter it successfully with only maybe like a hundred People in the school.

105
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:46,660
Rym: there's.

106
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,190
Rym: no there's a lot of technical reasons.

107
00:06:48,250 --> 00:07:01,290
Rym: I mean one they're trying to filter based on content which because we don't have artificial intelligence worth a damn yet and Because there's really no way to have a computer look at a picture and decide if it's obscene or how obscene it is.

108
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,730
Rym: Or is that one boob or two or can you see the whole?

109
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,393
Rym: I'm not labia.

110
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:06,935
Scott: I don't know.

111
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:10,128
Scott: or is this a picture of Michelangelo's David or a naked guy?

112
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:10,570
Scott: who knows?

113
00:07:10,711 --> 00:07:12,229
Rym: Is that a penis or just a banana?

114
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,336
Scott: We don't know.

115
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:14,422
Rym: we really don't know.

116
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:16,573
Rym: maybe it's a guy with jaundice so I can't tell.

117
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:26,270
Rym: you have to base your filtering on other factors and those factors don't matter because you could have a site that was Like happy furry kittens calm and it's just hardcore pornography.

118
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:35,174
Scott: You could also have a site hardcore fucking Rym in the ass something something dildo something and it's just a site of happy little cats Huh?

119
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:43,607
Rym: I find it interesting that your example Well my example involved puppies and kittens and pornography and yours involved sex with me and dildos.

120
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:44,790
Scott: Yeah, what do you want?

121
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:51,169
Scott: Not that all right Rym riding the sex machine.

122
00:07:52,237 --> 00:08:00,230
Rym: But the thing is with China It's a little easier because if you want to block like based on you can't get from this country or this place.

123
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:00,989
Rym: It's a lot easier.

124
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:07,650
Rym: I mean you can get around it with filters and proxies But it's generally much easier to block content going to and from specific places.

125
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,350
Rym: But as you all know on the internet porn comes from everywhere.

126
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,040
Scott: There is porn at every possible venture.

127
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,610
Rym: in fact remember when we reported on a bay image a while ago.

128
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,809
Rym: Yeah, and oh this is cool.

129
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,558
Rym: So I clicked on a random link and I clicked on.

130
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:27,270
Rym: I think Digimon and the first thing I saw was Digimon pornography.

131
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:34,330
Scott: Another thing is that a lot of like firewalls and filtering things right because of the way SSL works.

132
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:37,518
Scott: right if you want to like visit your banks website.

133
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:47,990
Scott: that doesn't go through the filters and things because if it does it won't work because SSL is designed to prevent men in the middle attacks and stuff like which is basically what proxy censorship is right?

134
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:54,590
Scott: So when you do that like let's say your work has an HTTP proxy And you want to visit your bank's website either?

135
00:08:55,073 --> 00:09:00,690
Scott: They set it up where you're not allowed to visit your bank's website Or they allow you to make a direct connection to your bank.

136
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:08,497
Scott: So if someone says of a porn site that's secure and they like sell logins or something like that You could just totally visit it.

137
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:13,308
Scott: or if someone makes a tunnel and you go through the tunnel There's nothing you can do about it.

138
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:14,934
Scott: Absolutely nothing.

139
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:28,937
Scott: there is no filter in the world that can stop someone from making like an SSL tunnel somewhere Except for not letting them use the Internet's at all and not letting them do anything on the computer at all at which point They can't use the computer.

140
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:30,564
Scott: So what's the point of even giving them one?

141
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:32,050
Scott: They're not gonna be able to get their work done.

142
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:47,707
Rym: Yep, I mean it really just comes down to you're trying to block subjective content based on subjective moral bullshit and the only way to actually do that is to have a human being look at Every single thing that anyone tries to look at in all of Australia and have a big yes and a big no button

143
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:52,042
Scott: and that And then your entire law is based on that person's subjectivity.

144
00:09:52,122 --> 00:09:54,530
Rym: the thing is the laws are really subjective and crap anyway.

145
00:09:54,751 --> 00:10:02,118
Rym: Yep, I mean, I can't say specifically how it is in Australia, but you all know in America There's different hard and soft regulations.

146
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:02,659
Rym: Like uh-oh.

147
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,325
Rym: They said fuck more than once.

148
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:06,010
Rym: they showed one and a half tits.

149
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:10,313
Rym: We're coming down on Saw bullshit.

150
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:14,386
Scott: Yeah is technologically infeasible to filter.

151
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:15,730
Scott: just give up.

152
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:17,390
Scott: It's like DRM just give up.

153
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:24,270
Rym: I think a much better way is to teach children about what the Internet actually is and how to use it safe.

154
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,921
Scott: Hey, did you did you see any pictures and naked ladies in your kid?

155
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:32,899
Scott: Uh, I may have I may have as well Are you are you doing all right over there?

156
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,809
Rym: I think I'm doing okay traumatized.

157
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,676
Rym: Well, there is this one picture But you've seen that one too.

158
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:42,206
Rym: Yeah, I think we all know which one we're talking about.

159
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:45,178
Rym: point is, you know Give it up prudes.

160
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,023
Scott: Give it up.

161
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:58,450
Scott: All right, so Over the weekend when we weren't really paying attention Apparently some semi big news happened and I'm just gonna pretend it's true because it was reported in so many places and that's fine by me.

162
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:05,410
Rym: Well, there is an update on slash dot that Microsoft has identified and fixed the problem including posted instructions for people who had a problem.

163
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:14,670
Scott: So yeah, the point is Microsoft Windows and other Microsoft software has a new thing a relatively new thing called genuine advantage.

164
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:16,357
Scott: No, that's what they like to call it.

165
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:16,959
Rym: I like that.

166
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:17,983
Rym: That's quite a euphemism.

167
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:18,666
Rym: Check it out.

168
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:20,071
Rym: It's a genuine they.

169
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:30,356
Scott: basically the idea of genuine advantage is that according to Microsoft you get an advantage if you use genuine Microsoft software as opposed to Pirated Microsoft software.

170
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:37,927
Scott: the advantage is that you get updates and your software works But my old pirated copy of Windows 2000 got updates.

171
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:40,235
Rym: just fine Yeah, but not not.

172
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:42,423
Scott: you haven't been using that since the genuine advantage.

173
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:44,980
Rym: Well, they didn't really do that with Windows 2000.

174
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,329
Scott: Yeah The way it works is whenever you go to Windows Update or whenever you turn your computer on.

175
00:11:50,972 --> 00:12:04,910
Scott: I don't know if it happens every time you turn your computer on but whenever you go to Windows Update or do some other Certain activities on your computer that your wind copy of Windows will go and check with the Microsoft Genuine advantage server to make sure that your copy of Windows is genuine.

176
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:08,283
Scott: So let's say I install Windows on my computer and I update it.

177
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:10,110
Scott: It'll be cool if I paid for it.

178
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,150
Scott: It's a real copy of Windows.

179
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,390
Scott: It came with my Dell computer.

180
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:18,110
Scott: Then I give Rym my CD key and he installs that same copy of Windows in his computer and he goes and updates.

181
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:25,771
Scott: That server realizes the two people using the same CD key and they're both updating the same exact updates within like five minutes of each Other.

182
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:26,698
Scott: it's not stupid.

183
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:26,980
Scott: It goes.

184
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:53,358
Scott: Hey, hey You're obviously pirating one of you and then it shuts us both down and our windows is don't stop working entirely but it basically cuts our windows is down to almost no functionality whatsoever is that the basically useless and The only way you can get it to work again is either To basically you have to go to the windows genuine advantage server again and get it to say yes You're genuine as opposed to no you're still a pirate.

185
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:57,490
Rym: I still can't believe that my copy of XP is legitimate.

186
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:00,263
Rym: Yes, because I can we got it through a shade somewhat shady.

187
00:13:00,283 --> 00:13:00,986
Scott: It's not shady.

188
00:13:01,026 --> 00:13:01,810
Scott: It's perfectly real.

189
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:14,408
Scott: anyway, the point is is that they somehow say that it's an advantage to have a operating system where there is a Possibility that the operating system will just stop working.

190
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:26,490
Rym: now We've a lot of times open source people and I and Scott have both made this argument that you know with the system like this With the authentication on the server side and whatever it is possible for Microsoft to just fuck everybody.

191
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:28,922
Rym: Yeah, and there's nothing you could do about it.

192
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:30,168
Scott: They can just decide.

193
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:30,954
Scott: one day You know what?

194
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:32,610
Scott: We're gonna turn off every copy of Windows.

195
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:42,469
Scott: every copy of Windows is just turn off and that'll be if Microsoft goes out of business somehow or if there's a bomb and Microsoft and the servers get destroyed.

196
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,537
Scott: Everyone's windows will stop working.

197
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:53,650
Rym: or what if Microsoft just one day said all right world Pay us a billion dollars or we turn off windows everywhere.

198
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,191
Rym: yep,

199
00:13:54,793 --> 00:14:12,970
Scott: and basically what happened over the weekend was a taste of that in that the genuine advantage server had an outage and a lot of people who tried to update during that period of time got fucked and they couldn't get anything done or Use their computers really until the server came back up and they restarted their computers.

200
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:21,063
Rym: take that all of our friends who said that that couldn't happen because it just did and Well, I gotta say is with Linux.

201
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,710
Scott: This just isn't possible.

202
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:28,210
Scott: I mean even if every person who currently works on a Linux kernel said fuck everybody double-deuce.

203
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:30,381
Scott: We have all the source code.

204
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:31,145
Scott: I have a copy.

205
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:32,070
Scott: Rym has a copy.

206
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,773
Rym: Yes, I do.

207
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,690
Scott: millions of computers everywhere have copies of the code to all this software.

208
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,067
Rym: We was that possibly apocryphal quote?

209
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:43,690
Rym: not really I guess apocryphal isn't the word but a possibly misattributed quote to Linus Torvalds.

210
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,714
Rym: That was basically.

211
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,567
Rym: I just back up my source code to the rest of the world.

212
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:57,132
Scott: Yeah There is no way that this could ever happen with open source and that is just one of the reasons why Windows sucks and Linux doesn't.

213
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:58,456
Rym: yeah now granted.

214
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:04,613
Rym: I mean a lot of people use Windows because they're not gonna deal with Linux which Linux isn't perfect at all saying that.

215
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:04,934
Scott: but

216
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:32,490
Rym: what I'm gonna say is that when it comes to governments militaries Anything big and important like that the idea of using a proprietary operating system like the fact that our military uses Microsoft Windows for a lot of things and our government uses Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office in a Way our government and military basically said well you're going to give this Corporation this international corporation a lot of power over us that we have almost nothing.

217
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:37,290
Rym: We have no way to do anything against them if they decide to ever do anything bad.

218
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:40,259
Scott: Yeah, and it's basically comes down to trust in that.

219
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,750
Scott: we trust Microsoft so much not to just fuck us over.

220
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,881
Scott: I mean we could go to war like what if there's a real war?

221
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:53,064
Scott: that was actually like someone was attacking the u.s With like a bunch of planes and boats and then Microsoft just said haha.

222
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:53,566
Scott: We want the u.s.

223
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:59,760
Scott: To lose windows off What the planes would crash and tanks would stop working.

224
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,562
Scott: it'd be game over.

225
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:04,272
Scott: they could they could kill us all whereas Linux Can't happen.

226
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:08,824
Rym: So I guess the moral here is if you don't use Linux the u.s.

227
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:18,930
Rym: Might get invaded and we might all die Things of the day.

228
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:21,699
Rym: so I've been in recording studios before.

229
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:29,385
Rym: we had a recording studio at RIT that we got to play around in and At one of the hospitals I work at there's a bunch of hearing labs where they test people's hearing.

230
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:38,909
Rym: so they have super isolation sound Booths and if you've ever been in one of these rooms, it's really neat in that the at least if it's a good one There's no echoes in the room.

231
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,729
Scott: Yeah They've got all kinds of foam and stuff on the walls.

232
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:49,867
Scott: The only sounds you hear the sounds you make and you won't get like sound bouncing off the wall going back into the microphone a Second time or anything like that.

233
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:50,894
Rym: now you don't like it.

234
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,129
Rym: it's kind of eerie to be in these rooms if you're not used to it because there's just.

235
00:16:54,531 --> 00:17:00,170
Rym: There's no echoes and your voice sounds kind of thin and everything sounds really kind of close and it's kind of neat.

236
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:10,390
Rym: But the thing is my thing of the day here this I did this partly because I'm really sick of just Using a video from dig every day and I found these pictures and they're pretty cool.

237
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:15,278
Rym: This is the largest Anechoic chamber in the world.

238
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:19,510
Rym: So it's a. it's a no echo chamber, but it's gigantic.

239
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:25,430
Rym: There are pictures of many many many many many fighter jets in this very far apart from one another.

240
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,031
Scott: I imagine.

241
00:17:26,051 --> 00:17:31,270
Scott: they use it to detect the radar profiles of said jets things like that things like that.

242
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,709
Rym: In fact, it not only does it block sound but it blocks all sorts of RF stuff, too.

243
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,829
Scott: Oh, you could use that room for a lot of interesting things.

244
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:41,679
Rym: Yeah, I kind of want to just run around inside it yelling.

245
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:44,890
Scott: I kind of want to run around inside it with radios.

246
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:48,479
Rym: All right, that's all I got.

247
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,970
Scott: we could do some Doppler action in there.

248
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,847
Scott: That'd be pretty cool because it would actually work like it's supposed to in the science textbook All right.

249
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,322
Scott: So this is a thing of the day classic.

250
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:00,030
Scott: I can't believe this is never a thing of the day.

251
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:03,930
Scott: It might have been but I couldn't find it and Rym was actually the one who remembered it recently.

252
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,650
Scott: But I yoinked it because I couldn't find anything better and I also didn't want to use a dig video.

253
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,320
Rym: I was looking at this anechoic chambered.

254
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,486
Rym: I'm like, this will be my thing of the day.

255
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,494
Rym: and then randomly I'm like, wait a minute.

256
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:13,297
Rym: Wait a minute.

257
00:18:13,397 --> 00:18:15,444
Rym: I have no idea what prompted me to think of this.

258
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:19,285
Scott: But yeah, so I don't know where to go.

259
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:24,871
Scott: But Well, uh, yeah of all the websites on the internet of all the websites All right.

260
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:29,228
Scott: This one is an old old old meme that is from the late 90s.

261
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:36,564
Scott: It must be and it's incredibly awesome and it entertained us back in the high school days And of course you got to RIT and everyone already knew about it.

262
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:37,610
Scott: That's how old this meme is.

263
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:51,570
Scott: And it's so old and I guess so unknown these days that like usually all the old memes come back around Like you go on dig and you see like all your base and it's like yeah We've seen that before but somehow it shows up again from all the people who didn't see it the first time.

264
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:53,301
Scott: This hasn't shown up again.

265
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,530
Scott: At least not in my memory.

266
00:18:54,671 --> 00:18:58,709
Scott: This is just people have forgotten about this one and I'm bringing it back now.

267
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,275
Rym: Websites, I mean even today.

268
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:04,625
Rym: this is one of the most functional websites I have ever been to.

269
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:05,849
Rym: I mean it lets you do anything.

270
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:10,793
Scott: Yep Anything is possible at Zumblecom.

271
00:19:11,254 --> 00:19:12,777
Rym: You can do anything.

272
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,123
Rym: The only limit is yourself.

273
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:17,368
Scott: The unattainable is attainable.

274
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,688
Scott: Welcome welcome to Zumblecom.

275
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:27,607
Scott: That's it Zumblecom.

276
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:33,718
Scott: Just I don't you gotta go to Zumblecom if you want to ever get anything done because you know You see anything there.

277
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,659
Rym: now as much as we often talk about Websites have to be functional like they got to be.

278
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:40,622
Rym: the text that does the thing and I want to get my information and get the hell out.

279
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,610
Rym: Website aren't websites like this because this is art as far as I'm concerned.

280
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,016
Scott: Oh, it's like it's like a masterpiece

281
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:50,935
Rym: and especially the fact that someone way back in the day Put this up with

282
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:53,947
Scott: flash like two or flash one paid

283
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,615
Rym: for hosting Paid for the domain and

284
00:19:56,655 --> 00:20:03,153
Scott: they still have it registered and the dot domain registered until 2010 and the site is still up Good God

285
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:04,737
Rym: and never has it changed.

286
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:06,140
Scott: No, they never changed the site.

287
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:07,764
Rym: just it's really.

288
00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:09,388
Rym: I like things like this.

289
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:09,929
Rym: It's very.

290
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:21,376
Rym: When I first found this I remember thinking wow that's kind of cool and it I almost would say it kind of epitomizes the idea of this internet culture of Sharing and providing back.

291
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:28,270
Rym: a lot of people make a lot of websites that do a lot of things That are really nice and really cool and they they don't make money off of that.

292
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,930
Rym: They don't get anything in return except knowing that they made someone smile.

293
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,758
Rym: Yeah, and they are in our case knowing that we pissed someone off.

294
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:38,290
Scott: This website is definitely I would say it's in in many ways.

295
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:41,579
Scott: You should you should visit it and keep.

296
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,593
Scott: just sit at the website for a while and you know until you realize that Anything is possible.

297
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:49,042
Scott: and then you know, just sit there.

298
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:49,543
Scott: Don't stop.

299
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:51,370
Scott: Just look at the website for a while.

300
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:54,550
Rym: Now if we were mean we could have said if you watch long enough something special happens.

301
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,615
Scott: Well, you watch long enough.

302
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,543
Scott: It does eventually end and you'll know when it ends.

303
00:20:57,704 --> 00:20:58,628
Rym: Yeah, and then it loops.

304
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:02,035
Rym: Yep All right, so Cell phones.

305
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:06,330
Scott: Well, basically what happened here is we had a convergence of coincidences.

306
00:21:06,772 --> 00:21:09,061
Scott: I guess maybe not coincidences on our GeekNights.

307
00:21:09,162 --> 00:21:10,146
Rym: It's serendipity.

308
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,190
Rym: It's synchronicity?

309
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,476
Scott: No, it's not cuz that's all bullshit.

310
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:17,476
Scott: the on our calendar of what to do for the GeekNights episode It said what do we want in a cell phone?

311
00:21:17,596 --> 00:21:21,890
Scott: And also by chance the Apple iPhone was recently unlocked.

312
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:23,956
Scott: So what better timing?

313
00:21:24,678 --> 00:21:28,790
Rym: yeah now we're not gonna talk about the iPhone except possibly obliquely many times.

314
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:36,558
Rym: yeah, the idea here is because Scott always used to yell at me because I always had the Cheapest crappiest cell phone I could get.

315
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,874
Rym: I always got like whatever was free and to this day I still get whatever is free.

316
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:45,070
Rym: Yeah, and Scott would always spend a little bit of money and get a little bit nicer cell phone.

317
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:56,150
Scott: well, the main thing is is that you know, I I don't have a regular phone and So my cell phone is my only phone and I barely make calls.

318
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:59,861
Scott: But if I'm gonna have something that's my only phone calling thing.

319
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:02,710
Scott: I don't want the cheapest and shittiest phone calling thing.

320
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,635
Scott: I think I can have these slightly better $50 phone calling thing.

321
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:09,605
Scott: Well that has some features that even though I barely use them.

322
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:11,370
Scott: I might use them a little bit.

323
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:14,439
Rym: What features does your phone have that my free phone doesn't have.

324
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:16,265
Scott: I got mp3s.

325
00:22:16,786 --> 00:22:18,192
Rym: mine can do mp3s It has.

326
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:20,830
Rym: it can take up to a 1 gig mini SD whatever card in the back.

327
00:22:21,211 --> 00:22:26,210
Scott: Yeah, mine could take a mini SD card and I can look I can load it up with pictures on the mini SD card.

328
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:29,022
Scott: That was the main reason I went for this phone.

329
00:22:29,062 --> 00:22:37,825
Scott: as opposed to like in my previous phone I had to get spent get softer from the internet and buy a Special cable in order to get the photos off of it without paying money.

330
00:22:37,845 --> 00:22:42,870
Scott: on my new phone I can take pictures to the SD card and take them right out of there without any trouble.

331
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:49,809
Rym: See, I don't know if I can do that because I never take pictures of my cell phone But I'm pretty sure I could mess with this phone and unlock it to do what I want to do.

332
00:22:50,010 --> 00:23:02,210
Scott: Yeah, the thing is I didn't have to do anything to this phone, but you can't do anything Anything if you can get your phone to Zombil com maybe also my phone has the Bluetooth and the Bluetooth dial-up networking is theoretically possible.

333
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:09,770
Scott: And while I don't do that I could you know in the middle of nowhere in an emergency pay for it and get on the net in the super emergency.

334
00:23:10,353 --> 00:23:11,217
Rym: I can also do that.

335
00:23:11,238 --> 00:23:11,599
Rym: Yeah.

336
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:21,861
Rym: All right, you know the thing is Phones now even crappy phones like the free phone for Eisner Sprint gives you Has all the basic functions of pretty much every normal cell phone.

337
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:32,252
Scott: Yeah, the problem is is It's sort of like this this tough thing because either a phone is going to do a phone is something I have to carry around With me.

338
00:23:32,272 --> 00:23:35,092
Scott: it's just sort of the way it is, even though I barely make calls It.

339
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:36,523
Scott: that's just the way the world is now.

340
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,470
Scott: I need to have a cell phone.

341
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:45,367
Rym: Yeah, particularly like when I mean imagine the days before cell phones go into I don't know an anime convention or going on a Road trip in multiple cars.

342
00:23:45,447 --> 00:23:47,035
Rym: Yep You're screwed.

343
00:23:47,516 --> 00:23:49,644
Scott: So I have to have a cell phone.

344
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:52,454
Scott: no matter what I carry on me I have to carry a phone.

345
00:23:52,494 --> 00:23:55,285
Scott: So in addition, I carry a lot of other gadgets.

346
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:58,841
Scott: and as much as I like gadgets I don't like carrying things.

347
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:00,730
Scott: I like to carry as few things as possible.

348
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:09,274
Rym: But yet I know that despite the fact that your phone can play mp3s You still carry an iPod and despite the fact that your phone can play games You still carry a DS.

349
00:24:09,455 --> 00:24:14,268
Scott: and the reason is the phone sucks at playing games and the phone sucks at playing mp3s.

350
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,600
Rym: So what we're gonna talk about tonight?

351
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:29,810
Rym: because in theory I would love to have like a little super smart iPhone kind of thing that can go on the internet and make calls and go To my Google Calendar and take pictures and download and upload and Bluetooth and game and mp3 and everything.

352
00:24:30,432 --> 00:24:34,865
Rym: But the reason I always get the crappy cell phone is that it's not a matter of money.

353
00:24:34,965 --> 00:24:36,731
Rym: even it's a fact that no matter How

354
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:39,062
Scott: much money I'm willing to pay almost any amount of money no

355
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:47,990
Rym: matter how much money we're willing to spend There is not a phone on this freaking earth that does even a fraction of the things I want it to let alone for a reasonable price.

356
00:24:48,251 --> 00:25:08,802
Scott: Basically what it comes down to is if my phone for example If my phone doesn't play mp3s well enough to just to replace the iPod or maybe an i-audio or whatever If it doesn't play mp3s as well as or better than a standalone at portable mp3 player Then it's effectively not an mp3 player.

357
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:21,722
Scott: I don't need emergency mp3 playing All right, it's you know, so if it doesn't do that, then it can't replace the mp3 playing device Which means I'm gonna use the phone only for its phone calling.

358
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:24,490
Scott: So I'm gonna have two devices anyway.

359
00:25:25,012 --> 00:25:29,410
Scott: So what the hell do I care if the phone has better or worse mp3 playing on it?

360
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,663
Scott: It's either sufficient or not sufficient.

361
00:25:31,884 --> 00:25:32,830
Scott: That's the end of the story.

362
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:40,840
Rym: So what we're gonna talk about is kind of a. this is almost like fantasy football, but for super nerds Fantasy cell phone right now.

363
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:42,650
Rym: what basically the idea is that?

364
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:48,130
Rym: Like we said we'd be willing to spend money like if there were I'd be willing to spend five six seven hundred dollars.

365
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:49,083
Rym: Yeah for a good

366
00:25:49,224 --> 00:25:49,549
Scott: like that

367
00:25:50,497 --> 00:26:03,310
Rym: I'll put it this way we're gonna talk about the kind of cell phone the features it would have to have for us to have reacted to it the way a Lot of people reacted to the iPhone the kind of phone that I would stand in line overnight to get one.

368
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:09,410
Scott: Well, there is one good thing to say about the iPhone and and that is that the interface of the iPhone doesn't suck.

369
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,003
Scott: Yes, and that is one major problem with current phones, especially in the u.s.

370
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:18,600
Scott: But also everywhere else is that the user interface is Horrendous and ass.

371
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:22,949
Scott: I mean I always you know I'm always kind of sad when I see old people trying to use a cell phone.

372
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:27,645
Scott: Usually I'm like, you know, I'll be like old people can't use a computer and I'm like you.

373
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:29,231
Scott: old people get with the times But it.

374
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:35,730
Scott: but when it comes to cell phones, especially part of it is that the cell phone has a really horrible interface.

375
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,966
Scott: Yeah, and you know even old people who try to learn how to use the phone.

376
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:46,050
Scott: It's not easy I mean, it's hard for me to use my freaking phone You know, I mean, it's just counterintuitive crap.

377
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:51,389
Rym: And I when I first get a new phone It takes me a while to figure out how to make it do the things I wanted to do.

378
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,304
Scott: I mean like for me to like even text message people.

379
00:26:54,344 --> 00:27:01,285
Scott: the interface for like Choosing people from my contact list to add to a to add to a text message sucks goddamn balls.

380
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:02,007
Scott: It's horrendous.

381
00:27:02,068 --> 00:27:03,010
Scott: It's useless.

382
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,940
Scott: So when I send text messages, it's it's painful.

383
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,970
Scott: I only send them when it's more convenient than calling which is rare.

384
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:14,787
Scott: So the first thing a phone has to have is user interface that it doesn't suck and the eye.

385
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:18,550
Scott: the one the iPhone has I'd say is bare minimum of goodness.

386
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:19,535
Rym: So that's the line.

387
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:27,062
Rym: if it it's gotta have an iPhone ish interface and I'd be cool with it It's got to be as good as or better than iPhone interface now.

388
00:27:27,303 --> 00:27:29,990
Rym: do it's gotta make calls now?

389
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:31,090
Rym: That might sound stupid.

390
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:37,250
Rym: But I've seen people who have cell phones that just the microphone is crappy and you can't understand them when they talk.

391
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:44,445
Scott: Or the earpiece isn't loud enough or the speakerphone isn't good enough or you know The Bluetooth headset doesn't stay connected properly or whatever.

392
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:48,079
Rym: for whatever reason It just doesn't get service in places where it should.

393
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,751
Scott: also other than I think the iPhone actually is one of the nice things It does.

394
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:59,156
Scott: but for example, if you know someone calls me while I'm getting I'm while I'm talking it's got a. you know It's got to behave appropriately.

395
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,330
Scott: if I want to make a text message while I'm talking to someone in the speakerphone.

396
00:28:02,612 --> 00:28:04,002
Scott: That has to work properly.

397
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:09,530
Scott: if I'm listening, you know If I'm using another feature of the phone and I get a call it has to react appropriately.

398
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,630
Scott: it.

399
00:28:10,494 --> 00:28:22,615
Scott: basically everything involving calling has to be Slick and cool and work exactly as you would expect it to with no annoyances and I guess we can boil this down Before it does anything else.

400
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:25,586
Rym: It's got to be a phone and it's got to work as a phone.

401
00:28:25,807 --> 00:28:28,429
Scott: It sure does All right, what else that to do?

402
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:33,970
Rym: Well beyond that it has to be in some ways a mini computer is via smartphone because I'm paying a lot of money.

403
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:38,909
Rym: I want a smartphone but blackberries and all those smartphones really suck to use.

404
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:46,370
Scott: Yes, and while there are things that they do well, for example, the blackberry does email pretty well I can't just install any application.

405
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,290
Scott: I want a lot of the applications for it cost money and there aren't a large assortment of free applications.

406
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,256
Rym: A lot of them don't work.

407
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:54,270
Scott: Yeah, a lot of them don't work properly.

408
00:28:55,376 --> 00:29:01,059
Scott: A lot of them don't work the way I want them to work While there are dev kits to write my own software.

409
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:06,496
Scott: they suck balls and it sucks to write your own software for those things Linux phone really has.

410
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:10,090
Scott: would be it because then I can make I'd be fine with a Windows Phone.

411
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,742
Scott: No, they do have a Windows Phone, but that is all the same problems.

412
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:14,410
Scott: I know they didn't fix any of it.

413
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:23,604
Rym: Well, the problem is an actual Windows Phone a phone that was just running XP and I could install whatever I wanted on it And not only that but all these applications if they happen to use the data network.

414
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:33,570
Scott: I want true unlimited usage of the data network at the speed at which it is and I don't want you looking at what I'm using it for and I'm willing to pay like a lot of money a month.

415
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,580
Scott: I mean Verizon charges 80 bucks a month for unlimited data.

416
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,190
Scott: The problem is it's not really unlimited data.

417
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:44,047
Scott: They have like a you know a secret limit and they'll cut you off if they see you watching YouTube by your phone.

418
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:47,570
Rym: just be like Alright, here are the exact limits and here are the rules.

419
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,922
Scott: But I wouldn't pay 80 bucks a month for the limit that they have.

420
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:51,430
Rym: but I'd be fine if they just say it.

421
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,816
Scott: But the problem is and actually if they just say it I'm only gonna pay 40 for that limit.

422
00:29:54,977 --> 00:30:03,290
Rym: ISPs do the same thing where they say check it out unlimited bandwidth But it's not really and they'll just totally screw you if you go beyond their secret arbitrary.

423
00:30:03,573 --> 00:30:10,008
Scott: I want to be able to send any data I want on the full free open internet and do whatever the fuck I want with my phone.

424
00:30:10,028 --> 00:30:10,550
Scott: It's my phone.

425
00:30:10,671 --> 00:30:11,296
Scott: I'm on the internet.

426
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:12,930
Scott: I pay you for the connection to the internet.

427
00:30:13,251 --> 00:30:14,335
Scott: Let me do whatever I want.

428
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:17,989
Scott: if I want to use Skype over the internet instead of using your phone tough shit.

429
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:19,775
Scott: if I want To send IMs tough shit.

430
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:21,239
Scott: if I want to download mp3s tough shit.

431
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,503
Scott: I'm doing whatever I wants my phone.

432
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:29,745
Rym: Fuck you now along those lines The phone's got to support 802.11 so I can just go on the internet.

433
00:30:29,886 --> 00:30:32,577
Rym: if there's any wireless access point I should be able to just connect to that.

434
00:30:32,718 --> 00:30:40,810
Scott: Yeah, and even better if it had the 802.11n Yes, but I'd be okay with G and speaking of which it also you can't be giving me no g2 phone.

435
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,321
Scott: It has to go on the fastest cell networks possible.

436
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:45,304
Scott: I need the ev dues.

437
00:30:45,665 --> 00:30:47,190
Scott: I need all that action.

438
00:30:47,371 --> 00:30:48,178
Scott: You know why she?

439
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:52,441
Scott: I don't want this slow ass Like 1x or a GPRS business.

440
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:57,178
Scott: I need the edge I need the HSDPA I need everything no matter where I am.

441
00:30:57,198 --> 00:30:58,141
Scott: This is cell towers.

442
00:30:58,262 --> 00:30:58,723
Scott: I'm on.

443
00:30:58,984 --> 00:31:02,838
Scott: that's how if I go to a foreign country I got to switch out my SIM card and I'm on.

444
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:06,410
Scott: there can't be anywhere where there's cell service and I'm not on.

445
00:31:07,012 --> 00:31:11,990
Rym: As I can go SIM card, I'd better be able to take that SIM card out and put it in a different phone.

446
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:14,029
Rym: Yeah, I put a different SIM card in that phone.

447
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:17,450
Scott: There is no way that I'm gonna have my phone tied to the carrier.

448
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,155
Scott: I mean right now I can sorta.

449
00:31:19,597 --> 00:31:24,312
Scott: it's sort of understandable because the phone carriers in the US unlike other countries They give you.

450
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:25,956
Scott: they subsidize your phone.

451
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:35,967
Scott: when you buy say a trio from Verizon that trio only cost you like a few hundred dollars Whereas buying a trio on your own from palm directly is a lot more money.

452
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:40,609
Scott: and Verizon Subsidizes your phone in exchange for your extended contract.

453
00:31:41,091 --> 00:31:49,220
Scott: However, the ideal phone for me would be a phone that I buy from the phone manufacturer for whatever price Whatever price they're charging.

454
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,210
Scott: I don't care and I own that hardware.

455
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:55,912
Scott: It's mine and I paid for all of it and then I can use it on any network I want.

456
00:31:56,293 --> 00:32:07,648
Scott: you know may I guess I can understand the technological, you know problems with having a phone That's either on the you know, the GPRS GSM edge ages DPA type networks and the phones that are on the.

457
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:14,431
Scott: you know Evdu one X Verizon type networks, you know PCM.

458
00:32:14,611 --> 00:32:21,277
Rym: well, I think the deal is we're talking about what we want in a phone and some of the problems are just people being Greedy and wanting money part.

459
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:22,905
Rym: Some of the problems are just technological.

460
00:32:22,925 --> 00:32:23,850
Rym: some of the problems are.

461
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:26,050
Scott: So what I want is a phone that can do all the networks.

462
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:31,150
Scott: But obviously if the phone does one of the other I'd still be cool with it as long as it did all the high speeds.

463
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:35,746
Rym: Yeah now also I should be able to own the phone and do what I want with it.

464
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:47,209
Rym: now specifically I'm talking about GPS because a lot of phones even if they don't do it with the satellites or with the whatever They can do a weak GPS by looking at cell towers and figure out where you are.

465
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:52,690
Rym: Almost every phone does not let you get that data and you have to pay to get that day.

466
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:57,865
Scott: Well what that comes down to is the phone has hardware in it and the hardware of the phone.

467
00:32:58,005 --> 00:33:08,594
Scott: just looking at the capabilities of That hardware it can do certain things like get GPS coordinates that are roughly accurate or play music out the speakerphone or Anything like that.

468
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:16,870
Scott: if my phone's hardware is capable of something I Want to not be limited at all and taking advantage of those capabilities.

469
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:21,800
Scott: I might not want to take advantage of all those capabilities But I don't want to be prevented from doing anything.

470
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:26,478
Scott: if my phone can get shitty GPS data I want access to that shitty GPS data.

471
00:33:26,518 --> 00:33:31,609
Scott: if my phone can play crappy music out the speakerphone I want to be able to play crap music out the speakerphone.

472
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:35,965
Scott: Everything the phone can do I need to be able to do if I want to.

473
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:37,530
Scott: you cannot limit me in any way.

474
00:33:38,073 --> 00:33:38,918
Scott: It's my phone.

475
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:40,528
Scott: I control it not you.

476
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:46,606
Scott: It's got to be able to play mp3s and all kinds of other audio formats if possible.

477
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:47,930
Rym: Yeah, I don't really need video.

478
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,418
Scott: But yeah, I don't really need video on the go.

479
00:33:50,499 --> 00:34:00,962
Scott: cuz I'm not in personally interested in watching video on the go I mean I am now just on the train, but but I use my laptop or so Yeah, I bought a dedicated little DVD laptop player personally.

480
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:03,710
Scott: I don't see the point of the portable handheld video device.

481
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,822
Scott: I mean the iPod with video does nothing for me.

482
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:06,949
Scott: I don't I don't get it.

483
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:09,699
Scott: It's a small screen and a shitty experience.

484
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,945
Rym: It's not for you.

485
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:12,150
Scott: It's obviously not for me.

486
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,958
Scott: So I personally don't care about that feature.

487
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:20,710
Scott: I wouldn't mind if the feature was there Nah, but I probably wouldn't use it that much and if that wasn't available, I really wouldn't care.

488
00:34:21,431 --> 00:34:27,152
Scott: But playing music I do care because I'm trying to reduce the number of devices I carry.

489
00:34:27,553 --> 00:34:37,239
Scott: and if the phone is as good an mp3 player as say the cow on i-audio 7 or even the iPod I don't need to carry an iPod or a cow on i-audio 7.

490
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,725
Scott: That's one less thing for me to carry.

491
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,489
Scott: So all the better.

492
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:42,315
Rym: You know, I think that's it.

493
00:34:42,717 --> 00:34:43,199
Scott: No, I don't know.

494
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,527
Scott: I think there's more where I'm concerned.

495
00:34:44,688 --> 00:34:45,070
Rym: What else?

496
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,498
Rym: I mean, we've covered a lot.

497
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:55,821
Scott: like I could talk about most camera I could say the camera only because the only reason I want a camera in the phone is because I'm not crazy about the picture quality.

498
00:34:55,882 --> 00:34:57,490
Scott: I mean I need good picture quality.

499
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:01,029
Scott: It can't be pixelated 640 by 480 business, but it's got to be good enough.

500
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,330
Scott: But again one less device to carry.

501
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,750
Scott: If I have a camera in my phone, that's as good as my camera.

502
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:10,710
Scott: I could just sell my camera and I'll carry one less thing.

503
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:16,956
Rym: I don't think you will though just because the lenses and everything no matter how many megapixel to get a good picture You need good lenses.

504
00:35:17,077 --> 00:35:18,265
Rym: I'm not gonna get a good camera.

505
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:19,030
Scott: That is a problem.

506
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:22,830
Scott: But right now I carry my camera with me in my bag everywhere.

507
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:26,850
Scott: But if the phone camera was better not it doesn't have to be as good as the camera lens.

508
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:36,430
Scott: But if it was better enough and I had you know free access to the pictures the same way I have free access to the pictures on my actual I think the free access is a given at this point.

509
00:35:36,491 --> 00:35:42,930
Scott: Yes, obviously Then I wouldn't have to carry my camera unless it was a special occasion where I knew was gonna take a lot of pictures.

510
00:35:43,453 --> 00:35:46,350
Scott: So it would be one less device to carry on a day-to-day basis.

511
00:35:46,774 --> 00:35:48,994
Rym: See, I don't really care about the camera But I don't mind.

512
00:35:49,054 --> 00:35:59,050
Rym: having a camera in a cell phone doesn't have to be good just because every now and then Happens and you got a picture The crazy guy who just tried to attack you or whatever.

513
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:05,769
Scott: That's what it comes down to is that I only use a camera on a daily basis to take a picture of something random that Happens like oh man picture.

514
00:36:06,412 --> 00:36:11,650
Scott: But if I only take serious pictures of something when I know in advance I'm gonna take pictures.

515
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,202
Scott: So that's all the phone camera has to be capable of.

516
00:36:14,283 --> 00:36:23,640
Scott: you know, if I see something crazy I want to take a short video of it for YouTube or whatever and as long as the phone can do that The last thing that I could think of got another thing.

517
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:30,450
Scott: the only thing that's the only thing I think of right now is That I want to be able to communicate freely between my phone and my computer.

518
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:33,310
Scott: So I can back up my phone stuff onto my computer.

519
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:34,496
Rym: I think that's just a part of.

520
00:36:34,657 --> 00:36:34,979
Rym: I own it.

521
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:36,990
Rym: I can do whatever I want with that is it is part of that.

522
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,704
Scott: But you know, it's not something a lot of people realize.

523
00:36:39,724 --> 00:36:49,588
Scott: for example my old phone I backed up the contact list and on my new phone I sent the contact list to my new phone and I didn't have to sit there manually adjusting all the contacts.

524
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:54,950
Scott: and that's only Because I was really smart and I bought a special cable for my old phone and I knew what I was doing.

525
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:59,970
Scott: Most people can't do that and they manually switch their contacts and they get a new and a lot of phones.

526
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:01,247
Rym: Just don't let you do it.

527
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:10,058
Scott: Yeah so pretty much that functionality is limited only to crazy smart computer nerds and that should be Obvious and very easy for everybody.

528
00:37:10,299 --> 00:37:13,850
Scott: It's it's a travesty that it's not people switching the contacts the way they do now.

529
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:14,255
Scott: It's it's.

530
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,833
Scott: it's just not cool Anything else.

531
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:18,159
Rym: I think that's it.

532
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:22,238
Rym: at that point I'd buy that phone I'd wait in line overnight I'd skip work to get it.

533
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:24,409
Scott: I'd be really it was only one of them in the whole world.

534
00:37:24,611 --> 00:37:28,113
Scott: I would I would try to become first in line and yeah, yeah That's.

535
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:35,830
Scott: if I have all those things Then that is a phone that could significantly change my life and it would become probably the most important device in my life.

536
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:38,540
Rym: I don't think that phone is gonna be around in the next decade.

537
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:42,252
Scott: No decade maybe five years Ten years.

538
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,865
Rym: it's tough because all the technological hurdles are gonna get overcome really easily.

539
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:47,170
Rym: the problem and notice.

540
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,174
Rym: We didn't say size.

541
00:37:48,315 --> 00:37:51,830
Rym: a device they can do all those things can be bigger than a standard phone.

542
00:37:52,332 --> 00:37:53,277
Scott: It could be big.

543
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:55,788
Scott: it could be big but there is a point in which I'd say.

544
00:37:55,808 --> 00:37:56,250
Scott: All right to be.

545
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:59,006
Rym: Oh, yeah, if it's as big as like the monitor in front of me, it's gotta be.

546
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:07,650
Scott: it's gotta be DS light size or smaller because the DS light is like the biggest thing I'd want to put my pocket, you know bigger than that you're getting into sketchy territory.

547
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:13,170
Scott: Yeah, but I think a lot of course smaller is better though if it was really small like iPod nano size awesome.

548
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:21,803
Rym: I think a lot of these problems aren't technological They're just part and parcel with the cell phone industry in America Which yeah is making a lot of money and has no reason to change.

549
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:22,326
Scott: Yep.

550
00:38:22,848 --> 00:38:29,533
Scott: The other thing Well, I think part of what it is is that it's sort of like this oligopoly where they're just a few carriers and oligopoly I like that word.

551
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:30,778
Scott: That's that's a real word.

552
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:32,163
Rym: I know I just I find it funny.

553
00:38:32,384 --> 00:38:33,749
Scott: All right oligopoly is a real world.

554
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:40,120
Rym: at me It's when there's a bottle I know I can figure out based on the not the meaning of the word Oligarchy and the meaning of the word monopoly.

555
00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:41,166
Rym: what oligopoly me?

556
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:41,468
Rym: Yeah, it's.

557
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,700
Scott: it's a word I actually learned in economics class was a prize.

558
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,670
Scott: You didn't know it already and you had to figure it out.

559
00:38:46,011 --> 00:38:47,255
Rym: I've never run into huh?

560
00:38:47,556 --> 00:38:48,058
Scott: It's bit.

561
00:38:48,098 --> 00:38:49,623
Scott: That's what it's a bunch of companies.

562
00:38:49,904 --> 00:38:51,590
Rym: Usually I just say oligarchy.

563
00:38:52,214 --> 00:38:53,120
Scott: No, it's an oligopoly.

564
00:38:53,302 --> 00:38:53,463
Rym: Okay.

565
00:38:53,483 --> 00:39:03,115
Scott: All right and Together they form this evil group of companies that they all decide to do the same thing sort of like price fixing but in a way It's feature fixing.

566
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:03,275
Scott: it's.

567
00:39:03,356 --> 00:39:07,790
Scott: it's like if every television manufacturer in the world decided to only make black-and-white TVs.

568
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:09,459
Scott: That's sort of like what this is.

569
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:11,068
Scott: every cell phone carrier in the?

570
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:22,250
Scott: u.s decided to only sell lockdown phones and if just one of them would break away and say our phones are unlocked they'd beat everyone else's Ass into the ground one day because most people don't know what that even means.

571
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:28,370
Scott: That's the thing is they had to accompany it with a marketing campaign that makes everyone realize how much better that is than the other.

572
00:39:28,753 --> 00:39:31,010
Rym: Can't they make more money by just doing what they're doing now?

573
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:32,073
Scott: I don't know.

574
00:39:32,093 --> 00:39:45,010
Scott: and I think the thing is everyone in the in who is in successful business is extremely risk-averse and If they just don't want to take a chance, even if you know what do I'm already making millions and millions and millions of dollars.

575
00:39:45,413 --> 00:39:48,593
Rym: I'm not gonna take risks to make a few more millions I'm gonna keep making.

576
00:39:48,674 --> 00:39:52,330
Scott: I would I would I would always take risk to make more millions at some point.

577
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,460
Rym: I would stop taking risks to make more millions.

578
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:56,670
Scott: I would never stop taking risk to make more millions.

579
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:57,393
Scott: That's the whole.

580
00:39:57,413 --> 00:40:01,690
Scott: what's the point then if I'm not again if I'm gonna not take risks, I'm just gonna retire.

581
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:04,503
Rym: I'll take risks, but I'll use my money to do other things.

582
00:40:04,523 --> 00:40:07,902
Scott: It's take risks until I retire But it's not take risks to make more money.

583
00:40:07,942 --> 00:40:10,795
Rym: It's take risks to have fun Big difference.

584
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:18,630
Scott: if I was in charge of a business The only reason to be in charge of that business is to take risks to do better business and be more awesome.

585
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:25,930
Scott: And if there's a point at which I don't want to take risks in the business anymore There's no point in running it cuz it's just gonna sit there doing its thing and I'll just retire.

586
00:40:26,678 --> 00:40:27,062
Scott: All right.

587
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:27,406

591
00:40:37,113 --> 00:40:38,870
Scott: Oh, are they so awesome like in Japan?

592
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:48,579
Scott: You can get a phone that watches broadcast TV and stuff like that and it's it's totally nuts but a lot of those features like watching broadcast TV, I really don't care about.

593
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:53,042
Scott: and In some ways the phones they're still locked down and in some ways they're not.
