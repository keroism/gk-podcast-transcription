00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:30,074
Scott: Let's do this Warm today.

6
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:31,865
Scott: No, I don't want to start with that.

7
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:32,750
Rym: You don't want to start with that.

8
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,465
Scott: I want to jump right into it cuz the show or be long otherwise true it will.

9
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:41,570
Rym: for all of you new listeners It's finally the night where we're going to do that Otakon con report.

10
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:46,308
Rym: You know that con that we went to before the week of awesome the con that I almost forgot about.

11
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:49,580
Scott: right Let's talk about it, but first there's some news.

12
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:50,443
Rym: So what do you got?

13
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:52,450
Scott: this news is actually about the Otakon.

14
00:00:53,371 --> 00:01:01,278
Scott: Apparently there was some car some fansubbing group doing a panel at Otakon On fansubbing did actually do their panel.

15
00:01:01,358 --> 00:01:02,181
Scott: I think they did do that.

16
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,910
Scott: They did do their panel normally and successfully All

17
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:05,271
Rym: right,

18
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:30,191
Scott: however, they put a press release on their website, you know on Saturday July 21st and they actually kept updating it updating it through the 27th that told a farcical tale of police coming and arresting them at their fansubbing panel and their fansubbing panel being renamed and you know in order to let the police know where they were and such and such and such and Such

19
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:31,618
Rym: uh-huh.

20
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:33,910
Rym: I don't recall anything like that happening at all.

21
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,058
Scott: There's nothing like that did happen at Otakon.

22
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:48,930
Scott: this fansubbing group in order to I guess attract attention Made up this story and put it in an actual press release that was constantly updated daily on their website To get some attention after the con.

23
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:54,235
Scott: And if you actually highlight all the their web, you know You drag and you select.

24
00:01:54,517 --> 00:01:57,148
Scott: you can see that in white on a white background.

25
00:01:57,208 --> 00:02:02,810
Scott: at the bottom It says YHBT at the bottom of their press release, which means you have been trolled.

26
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:06,744
Rym: You know, all I really have to ask about that is what's the Nubian?

27
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:08,229
Scott: Yeah, so wait.

28
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:17,710
Scott: So Otakon on their website today put up a press release that says response to data bios falsified press release.

29
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,023
Scott: We've gotten comments about the press release earlier this week.

30
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:22,570
Scott: just to tell you their panel went fine.

31
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,987
Scott: Police and lawyers were not part of their panel nor was anyone arrested at the bottom of their press release.

32
00:02:28,027 --> 00:02:32,030
Scott: the latest YHBT The press release is a complete fabrication not amusing.

33
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:33,073
Scott: We are sad.

34
00:02:33,093 --> 00:02:35,501
Scott: and they had to stoop to such a level to get quote.

35
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,090
Rym: street cred quote good game Otakon.

36
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:45,681
Scott: Otakon said street cred in I guess a semi-official press release Man, that's why I love Otakon.

37
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:56,524
Rym: But anyway, yeah Kind of silly, you know on one hand I somewhat respect someone trying to do something crazy to get noticed but on the other hand, you're a fan subber.

38
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,915
Rym: what you're doing is Vaguely illegal.

39
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:01,464
Scott: to begin with yeah Otakon gave you a panel.

40
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:07,654
Scott: your panel was just fine There was nothing wrong with it and you're making trouble for Otakon Partly.

41
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:10,930
Scott: what's with the stupid people believing the obviously phony press release?

42
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,704
Rym: I mean, it's not like that wouldn't have been in the news somewhere other than there.

43
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:16,948
Scott: I know right?

44
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:17,470
Scott: Come on.

45
00:03:18,153 --> 00:03:23,469
Rym: I think we're some of the last human beings on earth who whenever I see any news That's too good or too bad to be true.

46
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:30,550
Scott: I look for at least one other source and one other source that isn't just a blog post linking to the first source.

47
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:36,030
Scott: Yeah Hopefully some blog post linking to the blog post that links to the blog post that links to the only source.

48
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:44,824
Rym: The worst is when you find what a real legitimate or semi legitimate press outlet That has a story that at the end they just credit some blog that they got it from.

49
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:46,670
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty bad.

50
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:48,505
Rym: So what's your news?

51
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:48,930
Rym: Right?

52
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:58,670
Rym: Well a while ago Emily took me to see Toki wo kakaru shoujo in the city Which it's the girl who left through time or the girl who runs through time and it was a freaking fantastic movie.

53
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,806
Rym: I highly recommend it.

54
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:12,890
Scott: It turns out that DC Comics CMX division has picked up the rights to the manga to Toki wo kakaru shoujo Yep, the CMX if you don't know is just basically it's DC Comics and I think Jim Lee has something to do with it.

55
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:23,730
Scott: I'm not sure but they publish the mega Tokyo's and the tenjou Tengaze and This book I actually just bought called samurai command mission something.

56
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:26,568
Scott: I'm gonna read it and let you know how it is probably next week or something.

57
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:29,604
Scott: and So this is just one there's.

58
00:04:29,744 --> 00:04:44,270
Scott: actually you know I was kind of looking down on them because they were only publishing crap manga and crap non manga And harsh I know and now they're actually starting to get some things that are slightly interesting.

59
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:52,616
Scott: So in addition to keeping your eye on the Viz and the Del Rey and the vertical not the keep your eye on the CMX As well.

60
00:04:52,697 --> 00:05:04,850
Rym: Oh and the dark horse who can forget that Excited about this partly because according to the press release here, which is probably not a troll These are pretty much directly based on the original 1965 novel which the movie was also based on.

61
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:13,390
Rym: Yeah, the movie is really neat and that it kind of gives nods to the novel But it is its own story and I really want to read that novel now But I don't think it's in English.

62
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,757
Scott: This is something that I've noticed.

63
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:18,774
Scott: they've been bringing a lot of the novels over, you know And at first I like.

64
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:27,494
Scott: the first one I ever saw was that when I went to the comic book store regularly before I ordered online I saw this FMA book on the shelf and I was like, I'm buying FMA I gotta buy this book.

65
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:30,469
Scott: and I picked it up and it was a novel inside and I was like what the fuck.

66
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:31,132
Scott: and I Put it down.

67
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:35,549
Scott: and then a vampire hunter d1 came and I was like, oh, oh, it's a novel what the fuck.

68
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:36,273
Scott: and I put It down.

69
00:05:36,394 --> 00:05:38,230
Scott: It was like what the fuck's a novel do to the comic book store.

70
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:50,004
Scott: But now, you know I hear about like these great days actually awesome animes and mangas that were Originally based on novels not novels that came after but novels that came before.

71
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:51,570
Rym: that's what I'm interested in.

72
00:05:51,790 --> 00:06:01,722
Scott: I'm like, so I've been looking for like a trigon, you know, and and these all these old Japanese sci-fi novels We've been looking for a trigon for a long time.

73
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:02,244
Scott: What's it's?

74
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:15,749
Scott: um, I keep forgetting the Jeff way to say it in Japanese, but it's called undersea battleship and It's basically this Japanese sci-fi novel from 1899 that I is out of print and impossible to fix

75
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:21,245
Rym: somewhat World-renowned and it's super Japan renowned and there was a mediocre anime based

76
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:21,826
Scott: on it.

77
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:22,910
Scott: I take gunkhan.

78
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:29,118
Scott: That's why I would said if anyone has a copy of the original novel Kaita gunkhan in English or Japanese.

79
00:06:29,158 --> 00:06:35,920
Scott: We don't care from English or Japanese or any other language from 1899. this thing's public domain people and I can't get it.

80
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:36,743
Scott: It's a crime.

81
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:37,626
Rym: You know what?

82
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:38,710
Rym: I'm gonna put a bounty on it.

83
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,754
Rym: I'll give you 50 bucks.

84
00:06:39,814 --> 00:06:43,045
Scott: If you send it to give you a hundred bucks for the full text.

85
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,270
Rym: That's on any language.

86
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:47,038
Rym: All right, so that's already 150 bucks on the line.

87
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:51,030
Scott: Yeah of kaita gunkhan the original novel by Shunro, Oshikawa.

88
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:52,174
Scott: There you go.

89
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,542
Rym: It's so bad that the anime was not so great.

90
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,245
Rym: They really need to.

91
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:56,710
Scott: well that was super attrigon.

92
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,444
Scott: There was also the live-action movie which included kaiju as well as other.

93
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:03,567
Rym: I heard that that was great But not for the right reasons.

94
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:04,210
Scott: exact Yeah.

95
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:13,890
Scott: But my point is there's a bunch of awesome Japanese novels that I want translated to English and there there are translating novels to English but not the ones I want.

96
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:15,561
Scott: Where's like the twelve kingdoms at?

97
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:16,910
Rym: Oh, there's an update here.

98
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,544
Rym: CMX also announced that they're gonna release Shirley, which is a companion piece to Emma.

99
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:23,210
Scott: Oh good for you on it.

100
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:26,981
Rym: Uh, yeah, I want both of those because Emma is my favorite manga right now.

101
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:37,246
Scott: All right, I'll keep an eye out Things of the day.

102
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:45,234
Rym: so you all know that my second favorite kind of prank is Japanese TV show launches someone naked into some sort of zany situation.

103
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:46,397
Scott: Oh, man.

104
00:07:46,437 --> 00:07:47,320
Scott: Do you have one of those?

105
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,707
Scott: I haven't seen one of those in a while.

106
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:49,249
Scott: That was new.

107
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:49,611
Scott: See.

108
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:51,380
Scott: No, I don't because ah, what do you do?

109
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:54,271
Scott: Do you build it up and then letting down for while?

110
00:07:54,312 --> 00:07:56,360
Rym: that is my second favorite kind of prank?

111
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,780
Rym: My favorite kind of prank is the prank that isn't a jump out boo or anything like that.

112
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:03,886
Rym: It's where you set up a situation.

113
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:07,056
Rym: That's so weird that the people involved.

114
00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:12,553
Rym: It's not like oh you got me It's a prank, but they're just kind of freaked out and unnerved bonus points.

115
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,238
Rym: If you never tell them it was a prank.

116
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:19,373
Rym: Yeah Well, this is just one such video and I was taking it back.

117
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:23,226
Rym: I saw the link on dig and I thought okay This is gonna be one of those boo boo.

118
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:25,794
Rym: Ah, we got you candid camera things.

119
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:33,801
Rym: So I watch it and they set up the situation of guys gonna get sucked into a jet engine on a tarmac and a woman's gonna see it and freak Out.

120
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,520
Rym: and while that happens that is not the prank.

121
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,726
Rym: That is not the prank at all.

122
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:45,460
Rym: And all I have to say is the guy who kind of looks a little bit like Michael Keaton It's a good night for flying.

123
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,645
Rym: That guy makes this prank.

124
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:48,388
Rym: Good God.

125
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:52,180
Scott: It is an excellent prank and of the highest caliber.

126
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:00,920
Scott: However, I am disappointed that I do not get to see if and when they ever tell the person about the prank because their reaction Would be also the priceless.

127
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:08,759
Scott: However, it's basically like they made a gem of gold and then I know there's another gem of gold waiting But they deny it to me.

128
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:09,944
Rym: It's a gem to.

129
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:15,470
Rym: the woman starts losing it and it's like a scene out of a movie and she's starting to doubt her own sanity.

130
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:22,223
Rym: and What I'm going to assume because they did not show us the end result is that either this was all staged from the beginning Which I doubt.

131
00:09:22,243 --> 00:09:23,830
Rym: I think they actually pulled this on the woman.

132
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:26,440
Rym: I'm going to assume that they never let her in on it.

133
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,285
Scott: Yeah, okay, that's fine.

134
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:32,900
Rym: then because if that is true, this is perhaps the greatest prank ever pulled.

135
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,018
Scott: But then I hope she sees it on TV or the internet.

136
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:37,491
Rym: You know what I hope she never does.

137
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:39,180
Scott: I hope everyone could be an actor.

138
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:47,280
Rym: I hope everyone she knows and ordered and or was ever loved sees the video But she did it for does and then on her die on her deathbed.

139
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Rym: Someone shows it to her to get the maximum fullness of the joke.

140
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:57,317
Scott: Okay, so that's right killer, um, are you an anime fan?

141
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,834
Rym: deathbed Kind of.

142
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:01,580
Scott: have you ever actually watched?

143
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:03,584
Scott: Astro Boy ever?

144
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:08,378
Rym: I saw a clip from Astro Boy on the youtubes, right?

145
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:20,940
Scott: So Adult swim of all people on their website has a full entire episode of the old Original Astro Boy, it's not the first episode and it's not subtitled with Japanese.

146
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,776
Scott: It's the English one, but there it is and I watched it and you should watch it.

147
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:30,486
Scott: if you don't watch it They just stop being anime fan.

148
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,549
Scott: don't listen to Wednesday.

149
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,154
Scott: don't listen any anime podcast.

150
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,157
Scott: don't watch any anime.

151
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:35,160
Rym: you gotta know your roots.

152
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:43,924
Scott: This episode it's basically I feel the same way about this as I feel about like old corny superhero Comics from the 70s.

153
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:46,914
Scott: you watch it and you're like, wow, look at this.

154
00:10:46,955 --> 00:11:03,615
Scott: There's actually this hard Sci-fi plot about a ship a ship with a crew going to Mars not Trusting Astro Boy as the captain because he's a robot A guy who was a mutiny on the last mission who was actually right about alien invaders.

155
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:12,760
Scott: The aliens are really cool and there's actually a Not the super complex plot but way more complex plot for a children's show than you're gonna see.

156
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:16,288
Scott: But the delivery is mad corny.

157
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,755
Scott: The dubbing is way bad.

158
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:24,600
Scott: You can't blame that on the Japanese No, but you can name the the poor poor animation.

159
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:31,460
Scott: I mean they pretty much This mouths not moving while this talking which I'm not sure if there was originally talking or not because it's a dub.

160
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,560
Rym: It seems like a lot of American dubs of things especially older ones are really bad ones.

161
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:40,019
Rym: Just add all this extra exposition when people aren't talking because Americans are too dumb to get it.

162
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:49,765
Scott: but basically like the drawing is like awesome Tezuka like characters are drawn like awesomely and such and It's even though it's black and white.

163
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:55,040
Scott: but the animation is the horrendous which the poor movement of things.

164
00:11:55,742 --> 00:12:01,829
Scott: but yeah, it's like watching a Tezuka manga and With bad dubbing see at least we've come a long way.

165
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:06,079
Rym: Hina Tori looks like Tezuka, but it's also animated beautifully Yes.

166
00:12:06,481 --> 00:12:12,938
Scott: so if you've never watched the Astro Boy watch the Astro Boy because it's worth it and you should.

167
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,729
Rym: so Otakon 2007. we were there.

168
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:17,676
Scott: we were there.

169
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:18,119
Scott: Were you there?

170
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:20,185
Rym: Actually a lot of you were there.

171
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:23,337
Rym: We ran into a lot of GeekNights listeners.

172
00:12:23,437 --> 00:12:27,217
Rym: I was happily Surprised and apparently there were GeekNights listeners there.

173
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:27,418
Scott: who?

174
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,819
Scott: Saw us and they didn't say anything.

175
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,680
Rym: There was one group of two girls who I wasn't sure but I ran out of a panel and I was bolting toward a bathroom.

176
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,564
Rym: Cuz I had to pee.

177
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:39,994
Rym: I had to pee like I've never had to pee before.

178
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:41,280
Scott: it happened to me twice at the con.

179
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:42,326
Scott: I had to pee and I couldn't.

180
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:44,198
Rym: yeah, cuz we're on a panel or something.

181
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:50,084
Rym: Yep So I've run run into the bathroom and I hear two girls go higher and I was like There's no way.

182
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:54,544
Rym: they were saying hi to me and I just kept running and I peed and it was that one guy

183
00:12:54,724 --> 00:13:02,780
Scott: on Friday like early in the day where you're just walking back and forth across the con because there's nothing to Do and we were walking down the stairs and he was like your Rym and Scott you guys are awesome.

184
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,300
Scott: And that's all he said, you know what?

185
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,900
Rym: That's the kind of thing I like because I have done that to people or guests at cons that I've liked in the past.

186
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:10,299
Scott: I have also done that to people.

187
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:14,218
Scott: I've actually waited in line at people's tables to say you're so-and-so.

188
00:13:14,258 --> 00:13:14,680
Scott: You're awesome.

189
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,664
Rym: Bye, that was the primary thing I do with the mocha is go to every artist I like and be like man.

190
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:19,567
Rym: I really like your stuff.

191
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:20,350
Rym: See ya.

192
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:23,604
Rym: Yep, or maybe well you sign the book I just bought from you.

193
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:27,480
Scott: I don't really care about signing but I'll usually buy stuff from them.

194
00:13:27,661 --> 00:13:31,840
Rym: I only go for the signature if it's someone who will draw something in it on the fly.

195
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:34,340
Scott: See, I'll just go for my pirate book in that case.

196
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:40,459
Rym: Yeah The pirate book that you didn't really do much with it Otakon there wasn't so much that looked like I wanted to do.

197
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:43,708
Rym: That was like the best artists alley ever.

198
00:13:43,748 --> 00:13:50,505
Rym: there were a lot of amazing artists who could have drawn some piratey action and none of them really Suited my fancy.

199
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,493
Rym: I'm sure no notice.

200
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,060
Scott: I didn't buy much in the artists alley.

201
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:58,938
Rym: The only reason I didn't buy much is because I already own more art than I have wall space for.

202
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,634
Scott: yeah I you know the artists alley while the artists alley.

203
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:03,820
Scott: Okay, let's the artists alleys.

204
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:06,049
Scott: Well, let's start with Thursday and then move on.

205
00:14:06,331 --> 00:14:08,520
Rym: All right, so I bring this part up.

206
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:18,294
Rym: I mean I don't want to get into all the meta stuff about the crew and what we did when we weren't at the con and all That business and the road trip down because well, that's fun That's not really nota con con report and we got enough to talk about as it is.

207
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:19,540
Rym: We'll talk about all that tomorrow.

208
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:21,225
Scott: So the red line.

209
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:21,866
Scott: well before

210
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:36,952
Rym: that normally our tradition has been to get to Baltimore by noon on Thursday Check into the hotel, even though we can't get our rooms Make sure we get the exact rooms we want, you know next to an elevator on the pool floor Next to each other with the doors open between them and all that business.

211
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:38,960
Rym: and then we nap for like three hours.

212
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:42,591
Rym: This year we were tired and we decided to leave a little later.

213
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,761
Rym: We didn't actually get into Baltimore until about 2 30.

214
00:14:45,761 --> 00:15:00,238
Rym: I requested early check-in so we could still check in right about then Getting to Baltimore later than 2 30 pretty much fucks you at this point because the hotels just it goes from Perfect empty hotel where I walk up check in get exactly what I want to.

215
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:04,339
Rym: Line of otaku all of whom have problems getting their hotel room.

216
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,949
Scott: Mostly they don't have problems getting their hotel room.

217
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:07,872
Scott: There's problems with them.

218
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:09,297
Scott: is the problem.

219
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:20,648
Rym: They end up having Getting their hotel rooms because they either they're trying to pay with cash or their credit cards maxed out or they're there early But the friend who got the room isn't there yet.

220
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:26,012
Rym: or they're stupid or they don't understand that There's a hotel tax and they're wondering why the hotel room costs more.

221
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:27,499
Rym: Yeah, that happens a lot.

222
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:30,087
Scott: Yeah, it's basically problems with them.

223
00:15:30,107 --> 00:15:31,273
Scott: there's nothing wrong with the hotel.

224
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:41,420
Rym: the hotel is operating normally But this year we decided to since we had the fancy-pants Marantz Go to the absolute front of the line the reg line that was lined up.

225
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:42,889
Scott: Oh, I forgot about this.

226
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:44,700
Scott: you forgot about this until just now.

227
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:49,437
Rym: The people lined up to get their badges on Thursday, and this is something Otakon does every year.

228
00:15:49,457 --> 00:15:50,060
Rym: It's a great thing.

229
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:57,440
Scott: I highly recommend your pre-reg and get your badge Thursday Unless you're the kind of person who goes to work Friday and then goes to Otakon.

230
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:04,635
Rym: However There is no reason to line up before this line starts moving.

231
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:06,380
Scott: There's no reason to be in this line at all.

232
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,837
Scott: I mean basically the line this year was open from 5 p.m Until what 10 p.m?

233
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:12,244
Scott: So?

234
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:14,233
Scott: and the line for Otakon's reg.

235
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,600
Scott: they are so damn efficient.

236
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:22,283
Scott: It moves so fast right that even if you're at the end of the crazy line, you'll be inside within the hour Guaranteed.

237
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:27,200
Scott: so we showed up at the line at what like eight six seven six seven eight something like that.

238
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,773
Scott: We just walked right in got badges and walked out.

239
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:31,000
Scott: Well, that's not really what happened.

240
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:36,459
Rym: We would we were had we not been panelists We would have gotten our badges in less than eight minutes pretty much.

241
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:45,619
Scott: So if you don't like waiting in lines because I mean if you're the kind of person who says I'm gonna wait in the line To have fun go nuts wait in the line to have fun waiting in line.

242
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:50,535
Scott: But if you don't like waiting in line There is no reason to ever wait in a line at Otakon.

243
00:16:50,596 --> 00:16:54,440
Rym: if you go Thursday I mean, I don't cuz a lot of people lined up.

244
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:04,799
Rym: I'd say thousands and thousands perhaps at least a thousand people lined up and they waited there for hours for no reason because once the reg line opens it takes About an hour to churn through all the 80 to already in line.

245
00:17:05,382 --> 00:17:12,022
Rym: Then there's just no wait for the rest of the night because there's like no more hours of walk in and get your badge Immediately time.

246
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:21,940
Scott: and so by the same token anyone who ever complains about the pre reg line at Otakon They were they were allowed to complain in years past but since last year complaining is all over.

247
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,560
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna say it straight up if you think that line is as bad you're an idiot.

248
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,591
Rym: Yeah, that's the best icon line could ever be.

249
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,840
Scott: I mean the line isn't perfect because it was perfect.

250
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:36,640
Scott: Everyone would immediately get their badge and there would be one reg person for every single person who wanted a badge.

251
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:44,280
Scott: I never have one badge and personally handed to you, but that is the best reg line of any convention probably in the world.

252
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:55,613
Rym: Okay, so so we went before right before they opened the doors like at the final hour to the very front of this line To see what kind of crazy wacko had been waiting there now.

253
00:17:56,095 --> 00:17:57,380
Rym: We recorded two little interviews.

254
00:17:57,762 --> 00:18:09,879
Rym: I'm gonna start with the second person in line Because he gave the answer that I expected someone to give and it's not that interesting But at the same time at least he has a fairly legitimate reason for being there.

255
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:13,311
Rym: So we're here at the front of the pre reg line to Otakon.

256
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,660
Rym: we are and what is your name?

257
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:20,874
Rym: Zach strange, so how many hours have you been standing here or sitting here?

258
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:21,977
Rym: I have lost count.

259
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,505
Scott: I got here at midnight Midnight midnight.

260
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:25,769
Rym: now why?

261
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:27,273
Rym: that's the kind of the open-ended question.

262
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:27,936
Rym: Why are you here?

263
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:29,300
Scott: That's a good question.

264
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:36,710
Rym: um, actually I come out to hang out with the other fans that show up early and That way I can sit under sit under the cover.

265
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,798
Rym: So I'm not getting rained on and sitting in the Sun.

266
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:42,491
Rym: So So you're gonna get into the count obviously early tomorrow.

267
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:44,320
Rym: What's the first thing you're gonna do when you get in there?

268
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:46,553
Rym: I don't know until I see the schedule.

269
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:48,101
Rym: I Will be.

270
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:49,487
Rym: I will be planning that tonight.

271
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:52,760
Scott: Are you aware the schedule is online before the convention?

272
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,355
Rym: Yeah, but things always sometimes change at the very end.

273
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,560
Rym: So I like to look at the updates.

274
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:02,859
Scott: I don't like to plan ahead too much because they usually end up changing something or another up.

275
00:19:04,622 --> 00:19:09,776
Scott: Are you aware that if you just showed up at like 8 p.m Tonight you just be able to walk in and get your badge without waiting.

276
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:13,913
Scott: probably Been I wouldn't have been able to stand around talking to all these guys.

277
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:15,300
Scott: That's the right answer.

278
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:18,380
Rym: now The person in front of him.

279
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,120
Rym: I don't know if I should say what this was about or if we should just let the interview speak for itself.

280
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:41,440
Scott: I think we'll just let the interview speak for itself and say Much to our surprise the person who waited in the front of the line for no reason We thought for no reason to get into Otakon and get their badge stupidly early Was not there for no reason and they were not so stupid.

281
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:49,929
Rym: All I hope is that when he I hope that he told the people at Otakon what he was there for because I'm sure They would have at least done something nice for him.

282
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,260
Rym: Yeah, and to I hope he doesn't die.

283
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:59,387
Scott: So And what time did you get in line?

Scott: Yes, the sheer irony of it all is though.

292
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,540
Scott: I won't be actually going to Otakon Friday.

293
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:15,487
Scott: I ship out 7 a.m.

294
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:23,580
Scott: In the morning, so Why are you waiting in line so long if you're not going to the con?

295
00:20:24,562 --> 00:20:30,130
Scott: To show my dedication to Otakon That's a pretty strong statement right there.

296
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,826
Scott: damn All right, let's move on.

297
00:20:34,106 --> 00:20:36,173
Rym: I think the sentiment there speaks for itself.

298
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,120
Rym: that is a man who was dedicated to his anime.

299
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:48,384
Scott: So a couple hours later after hanging out in the pool or before hanging out in the pool I don't remember we went to get our badges and Which would have taken

300
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:49,047
Rym: probably

301
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:53,121
Scott: five minutes because he went in at like seven or eight and we just would have walked in and walked Out.

302
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:58,879
Scott: BAM, but we were panelists and they had a problem with their crazy Microsoft registration system.

303
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,671
Rym: now Funnily Gerald walks by while we're in the problem line.

304
00:21:02,691 --> 00:21:18,040
Rym: Yeah, and we're like, yeah, there's a problem with panelist badges But he decided to get the press badge which I don't think is worth it still because I looked at the privileges the press get and That is totally mitigated by the fact that you generally have to interview uninteresting people who may or may not show.

305
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:29,200
Scott: Yeah they have these press events you get to go to which is like you go to a room where some guests show up and you Talk to them and no one else is there but the press and I really don't care about going to those.

306
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:37,187
Scott: And press badge doesn't seem to get you anything else other than I guess you're allowed to go into a few places in order to Question people out.

307
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:38,920
Rym: but there was one time it would have been useful.

308
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,600
Rym: We wanted to interview some people in line for the dealers room and the staffer wouldn't let us through because we weren't press.

309
00:21:43,942 --> 00:21:46,439
Rym: Yeah, that was about it, but totally not worth it.

310
00:21:46,459 --> 00:21:48,799
Rym: though I guess we could get the press badge and then just blow off.

311
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,460
Scott: Get the press badge.

312
00:21:51,721 --> 00:21:56,720
Scott: I would like to get every badge sort of have like the Otakon God badge like a staff badge.

313
00:21:57,161 --> 00:21:59,027
Rym: Just be Jim Vowles badge, I don't know.

314
00:21:59,088 --> 00:22:05,328
Scott: I'd be I'd be staff I'd be a normal registrant I'd be a panelist I'd be an in the artists alley.

315
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:08,899
Scott: I would be a dealer and a press person all at once.

316
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:11,699
Scott: Do you think I could manage doing all those things at once?

317
00:22:12,362 --> 00:22:13,860
Rym: We could get a table in the dealers room.

318
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,920
Scott: I mean all we have to do for some of those is spend money right so it shouldn't be that hard.

319
00:22:20,061 --> 00:22:22,150
Scott: Okay, so we had a problem.

320
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:27,288
Rym: the problem was abated Quickly, you know suffice to say every year.

321
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,292
Rym: for some reason.

322
00:22:28,332 --> 00:22:30,440
Rym: panels and I mean this year there were panel problems.

323
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:31,066
Rym: We'll get to that.

324
00:22:31,471 --> 00:22:37,760
Rym: but even in past years It's never clear how panelists should get their badges or how they're gonna get comped or what's going on.

325
00:22:38,101 --> 00:22:43,401
Rym: It used to be that they just gave you an associate's badge and I gotta say I really think they should go back to that System.

326
00:22:43,682 --> 00:22:48,460
Scott: Well, I don't necessarily think that we need a special different badge than other people.

327
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:58,300
Rym: Well the idea that back then when you were a panelist you didn't have to go through registration You just went in to panel ops found the panel's dude, and he had a pile of badges.

328
00:22:58,382 --> 00:23:05,800
Rym: He talked to you And if he believed that you were the person who was supposed to be there He gave you as many badges as he saw fit and that was the end of it.

329
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:25,593
Scott: I think that I think that is a good thing is if Because they have problems with panelists not showing up panelists being late panelists not knowing what to do panelists not being prepared Forcing every panelist as they arrive to the convention to go to panel ops to get their badge Right allows panel ops to check up on them.

330
00:23:25,974 --> 00:23:43,440
Scott: make sure that they're the real deal they'll know if a panelist doesn't show up they'll know all these things and I I think that alone would be a good thing to just force the panelists to show up to panel ops so that Panel ops could connect with them and make sure everything's cool and be on the level.

331
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:54,259
Scott: We don't need a special different badge But panel ops should just have the badges of all the panelists with their names already on them and then hand them out And I think that would be a good thing.

332
00:23:54,822 --> 00:24:01,005
Scott: Now barring that and I don't say that because I want to skip in line either cuz line takes five minutes I don't care.

333
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:01,667
Scott: Yeah,

334
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:04,820
Rym: even though we ended up having to stand in the trouble line, which took forever

335
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,219
Scott: Until someone finally came and triaged it

336
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:19,515
Rym: Yeah They really needed more triage in that line to walk because most of the people in that line either were dumb and just screwed up the online web form or didn't actually pay or Were us who had a legitimate problem?

337
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:37,120
Scott: Yes I think all they need to do is since the reg moves so fast You can make like a few more problem lines than just one and you can also have someone permit like Constantly triaging the problem line and that would take what two extra people not a big deal.

338
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:45,037
Scott: Yeah Especially when after an hour or two all the reg people are just kind of sitting around like yep Someone else is handling all of it.

339
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:54,735
Rym: Or in the very least if they could have set it up if they didn't do the special badges instead of making every panelist say they're gonna pay by check and then not pay and ghetto eyes it.

340
00:24:55,297 --> 00:25:05,328
Rym: it shouldn't be that hard to add a Compt button to the system and you just click pick like I am a panelist and then someone on the other end says yes They are or no, they are it here.

341
00:25:05,368 --> 00:25:06,092
Scott: You're deleted.

342
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:06,534
Scott: Yeah.

343
00:25:07,097 --> 00:25:18,150
Rym: All right granted I think the best system at least from I mean not from a con perspective But from my perspective is still ConnectiCon where I walked in and said hi I'm a guest and they said here's your guest badge.

344
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,219
Rym: Yep, and they didn't even ask me who I was.

345
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:24,924
Rym: No, if I was the shady person, I probably could have gotten a badge Probably.

346
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,142
Scott: but they then they asked, you know What are our names?

347
00:25:27,203 --> 00:25:32,220
Scott: and gave us our itineraries which if we were not guess we would have not have gotten our itinerary.

348
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:41,220
Rym: Sure, they would have said hey, you're not guess yoink, but still I'm reasonably certain that I personally maybe not Some guy off the street could have talked my way into a badge easily could have talked my way regardless.

349
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:46,000
Rym: I don't think I've gone to a con in recent memory where I didn't get a comp edge for legitimate reasons.

350
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:46,423
Scott: Yep.

351
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:46,906
Scott: All right.

352
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:48,435
Scott: So that's the end of the con page.

353
00:25:48,455 --> 00:25:49,220
Scott: They spent too much time.

354
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,679
Rym: Well, they had con badge designs this year were much improved over last year.

355
00:25:52,719 --> 00:26:00,073
Scott: Yes They definitely spanned all genres as opposed to last year where they were mostly anime No one cared about in very few genres.

356
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:04,290
Rym: Yes of props to them I took the paprika badge as I also took the paprika.

357
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,815
Rym: everyone who was smart.

358
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:07,059
Scott: There was a rule.

359
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,847
Scott: There was another respectable badge.

360
00:26:08,907 --> 00:26:09,891
Scott: I just forget what it was.

361
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:11,016
Rym: Well, there's the Raza found one.

362
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:11,899
Scott: No, it was alright.

363
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:14,180
Scott: I don't know why they pick Rosamond sort of an old show.

364
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:15,605
Rym: I'd rather than pick Raza.

365
00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:16,949
Rym: fine that people at least know.

366
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:23,209
Rym: then whatever crap anime some industry guys try about this Gundam badge Gundam there was a Gundam seed badge.

367
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:23,911
Scott: once I have it.

368
00:26:24,152 --> 00:26:29,690
Rym: Well, I am of the mind that Otakon should Regardless, I mean make a deal about an astro boy bad.

369
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,380
Rym: There should always be one Gundam badge.

370
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:35,320
Rym: I don't care what Gundam it's from but there should always be a Gundam badge.

371
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,846
Scott: It should always be a Tezuka badge.

372
00:26:36,866 --> 00:26:40,180
Scott: that should always should be a Dragon Ball badge.

373
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:41,123
Scott: There should always.

374
00:26:41,203 --> 00:26:47,529
Rym: you know that it's not maybe not Dragon Ball but shonen fighting of the decade whatever show it is There should be.

375
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:48,960
Scott: you know, you gotta do one of each.

376
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:53,033
Scott: I know that they go through some sort of process to determine what badges to make.

377
00:26:53,073 --> 00:26:56,847
Scott: that involves getting rights for the pictures and Such and that it's not always easy.

378
00:26:57,309 --> 00:26:58,172
Scott: But I mean, come on.

379
00:26:58,192 --> 00:27:00,220
Scott: There should always be one Studio Ghibli badge.

380
00:27:01,301 --> 00:27:02,204
Scott: Get with the program people.

381
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:03,930
Scott: All right, regardless.

382
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,556
Rym: There's nothing wrong with the badges worked out.

383
00:27:05,596 --> 00:27:06,037
Rym: Just fine.

384
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:06,900
Scott: Yep, just fine.

385
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,466
Rym: We had our GeekNights pool party in the pool, which was awesome.

386
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:14,940
Rym: Yep, and then we retired to our non overbooked semi-private hotel rooms.

387
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:17,067
Rym: I'll talk about that on Thursday.

388
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:17,650
Rym: Yeah.

389
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:22,007
Rym: Yeah Thursday, but suffice to say I'm well beyond the.

390
00:27:22,148 --> 00:27:24,760
Rym: cram as many people into a hotel room as I can to save money.

391
00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:25,140
Rym: Yeah

392
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:37,181
Scott: All I can say is that in the college days when you're poor and you care more about money than anything else because that's your Most limited resource you want to cram as many people into a hotel room as you possibly can without getting in trouble to save Money.

393
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:41,876
Rym: Oh the other thing Thursday, we were able to check in for our artist alley table.

394
00:27:42,237 --> 00:27:44,185
Scott: Oh, yeah, that was cool That was fantastic.

395
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:47,920
Rym: And the fact that if we'd wanted to we could have fully set up the artist alley table that night.

396
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,011
Rym: Mad awesome, very awesome.

397
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:52,239
Scott: I wonder why they don't do that.

398
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:54,929
Scott: I guess they do do it for the dealers room to some extent.

399
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:57,920
Scott: but then why does the dealers room open so late Saturday?

400
00:27:58,201 --> 00:27:59,440
Scott: I mean a Friday.

401
00:27:59,525 --> 00:28:05,180
Rym: I mean I think part of the reason is to get people into the con and all that first and of course the dealers room line.

402
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,860
Rym: that Keeps a lot of weirdos out of the way of the rest of the con.

403
00:28:07,941 --> 00:28:08,910
Scott: Well, I'm gonna talk about.

404
00:28:09,011 --> 00:28:09,920
Scott: let's talk about that right now.

405
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,228
Scott: They changed the layout of the con this year.

406
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:15,720
Scott: what they did is because they didn't have the arena available to them.

407
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:20,359
Scott: They needed main events that could handle the cosplay and there was a big main events.

408
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:25,080
Scott: Thus they moved main events from the upstairs where it usually is to the downstairs.

409
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:34,154
Scott: Thus they had to move the dealers room to a different Location downstairs and also move the artists alley to where the dealers room used to be.

410
00:28:34,355 --> 00:28:36,784
Rym: a lot of people at the con didn't realize Anything had moved.

411
00:28:37,086 --> 00:28:41,539
Scott: well people didn't realize something had moved because they you know They weren't so familiar with the layout.

412
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:49,023
Scott: But people had been there for many years and observant people noticed like we did and people had never been there before didn't know a thing Changed at all.

413
00:28:49,565 --> 00:28:49,685
Rym: Now.

414
00:28:49,726 --> 00:28:50,970
Rym: Here's what I have to say about that.

415
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:52,014
Rym: Oh to con.

416
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:56,549
Rym: I'm saying this directly to you Don't change what you just changed.

417
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:57,492
Rym: It was great.

418
00:28:57,894 --> 00:28:59,540
Scott: Do not change it at all.

419
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,445
Scott: This layout.

420
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:07,660
Scott: even if main events was at the arena This layout was a thousand times superior to any previous layer.

421
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,793
Rym: Yes, keep them the secondary main events as a backup main events or something.

422
00:29:11,813 --> 00:29:14,636
Scott: keep make more panel rooms or video rooms I don't know.

423
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,510
Scott: But do not change the layout.

424
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,975
Scott: keep the dealers the main thing.

425
00:29:18,995 --> 00:29:21,819
Scott: the reason this layout was so great Right is number one.

426
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:32,659
Scott: The artists alley usually has like all its tables and all its art show and then it sort of has this dead space The artists alley this year because it was in the slanted former dealers room room.

427
00:29:33,303 --> 00:29:35,980
Scott: It used all of its space effectively and was awesome.

428
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:43,472
Scott: Secondly because the dealers room was in a new space The entrance to the dealers room was not directly next to the exit.

429
00:29:43,512 --> 00:29:53,771
Scott: you pass through the dealers room from one end to the other And the exit to the dealers room was under the ridge space, which is a very much Unused space at the cons.

430
00:29:53,791 --> 00:30:02,726
Scott: so anyone leaving the dealers room Was going into an area that basically had zero traffic and con traffic flow was improved Exponentially now

431
00:30:03,028 --> 00:30:15,180
Rym: not just because now there's this better flow But also that space was now open for con goers to be in and that space while it wasn't that big There were a lot of people just chill in there and it kept them from chilling in the way of other people.

432
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:22,774
Scott: It was a. basically there was a spot in the giant Convention Center That was unused that was now used and that this makes things better all around.

433
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:24,840
Rym: also just the dealers room layout worked better.

434
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:27,460
Rym: The artists alley layout was perfect.

435
00:30:27,681 --> 00:30:27,881
Rym: There's

436
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:47,400
Scott: only one thing I can say bad about this layout is that because the dealers room was the dealers room layout was great But because of the way it was done There was one sort of dead spot in the dealers room Where there wasn't so many people going and the dealers there were kind of like girl No one's are over in this area because we're sort of in the dark corner girl.

437
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:50,651
Rym: Yeah, but that's such a model that was like ten dealers.

438
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:52,317
Rym: Maybe from a fan perspective.

439
00:30:52,498 --> 00:30:53,060
Rym: No one cares.

440
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:59,160
Scott: Yeah, exactly, but from Otakon perspective worst case actually the last unicorn guy was hidden over in that area.

441
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,528
Scott: So I wonder if he was happy or sad about that.

442
00:31:01,628 --> 00:31:05,060
Rym: Yeah, but seriously Otakon don't change it.

443
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:06,288
Rym: It was perfect.

444
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,254
Scott: Do not change.

445
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:07,738
Scott: All right.

446
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:21,726
Scott: so Friday morning Friday morning We were very glad to have that artists alley table because for us at least there wasn't much in the way of events at the We were interested in doing.

447
00:31:21,806 --> 00:31:27,504
Rym: we tried to go to a bunch of panels and they were all already full to capacity or Uninteresting to us.

448
00:31:27,564 --> 00:31:35,900
Scott: I mean we probably could have gone and should have gone to the OZ remix panel Which sort of opens the con and it was really fun last year, but for whatever reason we just didn't go to it.

449
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:38,974
Rym: Well, plus we had to meet Aaron and Noah and that's right.

450
00:31:38,994 --> 00:31:40,590
Scott: We had to meet people and Gerald Yeah.

451
00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:45,940
Scott: So we sort of got out on the one thing that would have entertained us Friday morning at the con.

452
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:49,300
Scott: The only problems Friday morning at the con were number one.

453
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:59,240
Scott: We discovered that you know Some of the escalators were out of commission and were not allowed to be used as stairs Which they do have legitimate reasons for doing that but still annoying.

454
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:05,020
Rym: Basically, though the way it worked out is they base all the escalators in the middle of the con to get between the levels.

455
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,728
Rym: We're closed off.

456
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:12,440
Rym: as a result There was basically this super highway on the upper floors to get across the whole con if you wanted to go anywhere.

457
00:32:12,761 --> 00:32:24,659
Scott: And of course as the same case last year the convention center people seem to have a problem Understanding that when the con opens the con opens and there's not just one door that you're gonna let all these people into.

458
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:25,483
Scott: the con Is open.

459
00:32:25,645 --> 00:32:38,371
Scott: let me and I have a badge, you know Obviously early on Friday some of the entrances need to remain closed because of the registration line of people who did not get their badges Or the forming dealers room line, which we'll talk about.

460
00:32:38,451 --> 00:32:47,216
Scott: Yes, but there are some entrances Especially the harbor, you know food court mall side skyway entrance.

461
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:50,003
Scott: open it up immediately Goddamn.

462
00:32:50,144 --> 00:32:57,640
Rym: every year Otakon says it'll be open and every year There's some BCC guy in a red shirt getting kind of angry and telling people constantly to go away.

463
00:32:57,863 --> 00:32:58,939
Rym: You can't come in this way.

464
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:00,679
Rym: Why do you people keep coming to this door?

465
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:06,140
Scott: It's like a few hours until they finally straighten that out and they let people in that entrance, which they should be doing.

466
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:14,020
Scott: Also, there's the entrance, you know, there's the part I forget what I should really learn the lobby names, which everyone uses but there's the outer beam.

467
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:21,659
Scott: Yeah, I know that I know the names but I don't know which one is which see thing is the real names are the registration Lobby and the cosplayer lobby.

468
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,297
Scott: No I'm talking about the lobbies like in the middle where the street goes through the convention center and you can cross.

469
00:33:27,477 --> 00:33:34,620
Scott: you can cross the Street under the sky under the mid mid convention center skywalk to get from one half the convention center to the other.

470
00:33:34,961 --> 00:33:40,280
Rym: Well pro that that little Street there on Friday they blocked it to traffic and that was fantastic.

471
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:43,820
Scott: Well, they blocked it to traffic for some of the time right which is good.

472
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:46,050
Scott: But then later in the convention it was open.

473
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:54,303
Rym: it seemed like most of Friday it was closed But then Saturday the road was open again and then at one point it was open, but they had a really awesome Crossing car.

474
00:33:54,344 --> 00:33:55,388
Rym: Oh, I forgot about that guy.

475
00:33:55,448 --> 00:33:57,094
Rym: There's some BCC guy who was directing.

476
00:33:57,114 --> 00:33:58,519
Scott: He was actually a traffic cop.

477
00:33:58,961 --> 00:34:00,870
Rym: No, he was wearing the red BCC thing.

478
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,458
Scott: I think he was wearing an orange thing.

479
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,228
Scott: Whatever Who he worked for he was awesome.

480
00:34:05,248 --> 00:34:07,880
Rym: He had an orange vest over his BCC uniform, whatever.

481
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,018
Scott: He was an awesome traffic directing guy.

482
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:14,760
Rym: He was really getting into it and the crowd was cheering for him and I wanted to interview him and shake his hand.

483
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,826
Rym: I just never got around to it.

484
00:34:15,906 --> 00:34:16,067
Rym: Yep.

485
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,600
Rym: All I got to say is I saw him like four hours later.

486
00:34:18,983 --> 00:34:20,536
Rym: He kept that energy up all day.

487
00:34:20,556 --> 00:34:22,759
Scott: Awesome You gotta have fun with a boring job like that.

488
00:34:23,206 --> 00:34:35,304
Scott: but that Crop the ability to cross that street is very important because if you do not have that ability The only way to get from one side of the Convention Center to the other is to go all the way to the top floor Cross and then come.

489
00:34:35,626 --> 00:34:47,040
Scott: so if you want to get from the downstairs of one side to the downstairs of the other side It sucks if you can't cross that street, so Obviously, you can't have that open early Friday when the red line is still in effect.

490
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,900
Scott: But as soon as the red line is over that needs to open immediately and stay open now.

491
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,719
Rym: The problem wasn't that they didn't open it right away.

492
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:04,819
Rym: The problem was that it seemed like randomly throughout the days on Friday Saturday and Sunday The BCC would just suddenly close that door for no reason and not let anyone through for an hour Open it and close it and open it and close it.

493
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,880
Scott: I would prefer if that street remained closed for the entirety of the cons open hours.

494
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:16,786
Scott: Well, even if the street were closed if the doors were open the doors need to be open when the red lines not as soon As the red line is gone.

495
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:24,640
Rym: I asked a couple BCC people and off the record They said that it was some union problem with like hours were seems like a lot of things are always union problems.

496
00:35:25,682 --> 00:35:28,100
Rym: Yeah, but of course we can't blame Otakon for that at all.

497
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,855
Rym: They have no say.

498
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:33,754
Scott: no but I think what the problem is communication because Otakon obviously wants what we want.

499
00:35:33,894 --> 00:35:34,917
Scott: as far as I can tell.

500
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:40,439
Scott: it just needs to I think better communication between Otakon and the BCC in the openings and closings of doors.

501
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:40,740
Rym: I don't know.

502
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,079
Rym: I have this feeling that Otakon probably communicates properly and the BCC just doesn't care.

503
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,849
Scott: Well, then it's communication between.

504
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,855
Scott: you could yell at a wall all day.

505
00:35:49,876 --> 00:35:51,120
Scott: The wall needs to be better.

506
00:35:51,703 --> 00:35:55,828
Scott: Yeah, I don't know which end is failing the communication But the communication is failing.

507
00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:08,599
Rym: regardless of which end though speaking of unions there was always been the problem with the BCC with the food was always like outrageously expensive and for business travelers and really really crappy and There's rules against bringing and the food was not food that we wanted to eat.

508
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:13,580
Rym: Well last year at Otakon Jim made a big deal about all right, we got him to lower the prices.

509
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,795
Rym: They're gonna work with us and they tried.

510
00:36:15,835 --> 00:36:16,560
Rym: they lowered the prices.

511
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,295
Rym: It was still way too expensive for what you got and kind of crappy this year.

512
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:21,440
Rym: It was fine.

513
00:36:21,741 --> 00:36:24,131
Rym: The prices were perfectly reasonable.

514
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:25,135
Rym: the food was pretty good.

515
00:36:25,195 --> 00:36:26,440
Scott: It wasn't perfectly reasonable.

516
00:36:26,922 --> 00:36:27,444
Rym: Yes, it was.

517
00:36:27,545 --> 00:36:28,469
Scott: It was a little bit.

518
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:30,156
Scott: It was like baseball park prices.

519
00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:31,100
Rym: It was less than that.

520
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:38,020
Scott: It's a price that you're willing to pay But it's still a lot more money than going to the food court and a real food place.

521
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:38,865
Scott: It wasn't really.

522
00:36:38,945 --> 00:36:39,830
Rym: I don't know what you're thinking.

523
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,600
Rym: It wasn't nearly four dollars for a ramen.

524
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,648
Rym: Eh, the ramen is marked up.

525
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:48,906
Rym: However, like the normal snacks two dollars for a pocky Two dollars for a pocky is not that bad.

526
00:36:48,926 --> 00:36:49,609
Scott: That's pretty bad.

527
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:50,131
Rym: Not really.

528
00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:52,540
Rym: Yeah, it's like a dollar ninety in the grocery store.

529
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,444
Scott: No, it's not a dollar.

530
00:36:53,705 --> 00:36:55,011
Rym: It's a dollar ninety in our grocery store.

531
00:36:55,031 --> 00:36:55,573
Rym: It doesn't matter.

532
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:57,200
Scott: The prices are fine.

533
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,728
Scott: They're better than they've ever been and they're fine.

534
00:36:59,768 --> 00:37:03,620
Scott: They're fine, but they they're still not the price of the grocery store.

535
00:37:03,681 --> 00:37:05,620
Scott: They're still not the price of a food court.

536
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:10,900
Rym: Nothing's gonna be the price of a grocery store and the prices for the food were actually really close to the prices at the food.

537
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:12,323
Scott: Yeah, they're still.

538
00:37:12,344 --> 00:37:25,536
Scott: I won't be a hundred percent satisfied unless the prices are such that I will not leave the Convention Center Because the price is so reasonable and the prices were not that I actually ate a lot of the food and I thought the prices Were perfectly fine.

539
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:27,463
Scott: $4 for a ramen.

540
00:37:27,523 --> 00:37:29,791
Rym: a ramen a is marked up.

541
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:31,516
Rym: That's a completely separate $4.

542
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:32,720
Scott: I can get two cases of Robin.

543
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,402
Rym: Yeah, but you know what.

544
00:37:33,423 --> 00:37:35,149
Rym: you could buy a soda for practically nothing.

545
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:38,240
Scott: I'm just saying that's they're not a hundred percent reasonable.

546
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:41,235
Rym: The only thing that was unreasonable was the ramen a that was marked up.

547
00:37:41,818 --> 00:37:44,250
Scott: it was all Too many dollars for a hot dog.

548
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,280
Scott: I forget the exact price wasn't that much money.

549
00:37:46,882 --> 00:37:49,052
Scott: It wasn't that much money, but it was too much.

550
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:50,820
Rym: several meals in the Convention Center.

551
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,620
Rym: The prices were far less than I pay for food at a baseball game.

552
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:56,067
Scott: They weren't far less than a baseball game.

553
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:56,850
Rym: They were.

554
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:59,560
Rym: yeah, you didn't even go to any of those places.

555
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,540
Rym: You don't even go to the food court.

556
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,120
Scott: I should have taken a picture of the the food price sign as I did last year.

557
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,369
Rym: You didn't even go to those places and eat like I did.

558
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,775
Scott: I saw what the prices were.

559
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:09,378
Scott: it didn't matter.

560
00:38:09,398 --> 00:38:10,645
Rym: Uh-huh What were they?

561
00:38:10,806 --> 00:38:11,249
Scott: I forget?

562
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,980
Scott: Yeah, I remember the ramen a was.

563
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:18,000
Rym: Regardless of what Scott says I think the prices are fine and Otakon did a really good job.

564
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:20,774
Scott: They did do a really good job of getting the prices lowered.

565
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:22,000
Scott: I'm not denying that.

566
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:28,339
Scott: I'm not denying the prices are lower than they've ever been and that some of the prices were so low I would have been willing to actually pay them.

567
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:31,691
Scott: But they are still not low enough for me.

568
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:39,217
Scott: to actually eat in the con and not leave and get what you want is Unreasonable and unattainable, uh, the same price I pay at the grocery store.

569
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:45,396
Rym: I don't Scott You're not gonna find no store other than a grocery store sells food for grocery store price price.

570
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:46,359
Scott: I pay at the food court.

571
00:38:47,821 --> 00:38:50,892
Rym: The food court's food is actually really overpriced and expensive.

572
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:51,373
Rym: I don't know.

573
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,678
Scott: five dollars for a whole meal.

574
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:53,861
Scott: That's not bad That's.

575
00:38:53,901 --> 00:38:55,165
Scott: that's pretty much what.

576
00:38:55,185 --> 00:38:57,792
Rym: yeah, you get that crappy like China Bowl, whatever.

577
00:38:57,832 --> 00:38:58,353
Scott: I like that.

578
00:38:58,453 --> 00:39:00,960
Scott: It's good stuff nasty food, whatever.

579
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:03,708
Scott: The food in the Convention Center is better, right?

580
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:06,840
Rym: Yeah, actually I'd say so it's better than that one China Bowl, whatever.

581
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:07,362
Scott: I like.

582
00:39:07,403 --> 00:39:08,749
Scott: that wok plays.

583
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:10,578
Rym: that's really bad Chinese food.

584
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:11,040
Scott: I like it.

585
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,702
Scott: It's really.

586
00:39:11,803 --> 00:39:14,693
Rym: I stopped eating there like four years ago because that food is just garbage.

587
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:16,440
Scott: the Italian place over there is actually good.

588
00:39:16,641 --> 00:39:18,087
Rym: No, it's super overpriced.

589
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:18,729
Scott: No, it's not.

590
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,758
Rym: It's like three bucks for a slice of cheese pizza.

591
00:39:20,778 --> 00:39:21,360
Scott: No, it's not.

592
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,347
Scott: It's like two dollars for a slice of pizza.

593
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:27,817
Scott: three dollars for a stromboli if I remember which is a crappy strombo Strombo.

594
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:30,391
Rym: That's like Sbarro's pizza.

595
00:39:30,573 --> 00:39:33,464
Scott: Okay, whatever Let's let's continue.

596
00:39:33,986 --> 00:39:34,327
Rym: All right.

597
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:35,912
Rym: Well, what do you want to continue with hotshot?

598
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:38,058
Scott: Well, we see.

599
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:40,830
Scott: Oh, yeah Friday the morning not so hot.

600
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,671
Rym: What are you talking about?

601
00:39:42,692 --> 00:39:43,360
Rym: The morning was great.

602
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:53,940
Scott: We went straight to our luxury box in the artists alley and hit there Exactly because there was nothing exciting to do for us Friday morning early in the con because we skipped the OC remix panel.

603
00:39:54,901 --> 00:40:02,828
Scott: We ended up spending a lot of time in artists alley before it opened up and that was a lot of fun because ah Relaxing quiet

604
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:10,511
Rym: at the con to me Even if you're not selling anything in the artists alley and you don't even want to be there Paying for an artist alley table, which is

605
00:40:10,531 --> 00:40:12,340
Scott: what $75 is 70

606
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:19,360
Rym: I think is basically paying for a luxury box at Otakon a place to go hide a place to sit relax and eat your food.

607
00:40:20,102 --> 00:40:27,839
Scott: Yeah, so even though our artists alley table was kind of eh, you know because we weren't even doing art We were just giving away free flyers and doing other stupid shit.

608
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:34,109
Rym: Granted I think it was actually far from Ed because a lot of people came and talked to us Especially Saturday after the gecky got panel.

609
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,373
Rym: that happened Friday night.

610
00:40:35,775 --> 00:40:40,815
Rym: the number of people who came to us Specifically to tell us how awesome our panel was was staggering.

611
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:45,013
Scott: It was however It's good times just sitting there.

612
00:40:45,356 --> 00:40:47,749
Rym: Just going ah Hanging out with the other artists.

613
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:49,399
Rym: There were cool people on both sides of us.

614
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,064
Rym: Yep.

615
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:58,680
Rym: All right, so I think in next year We're gonna get all of our friends and try to reserve either half of or possibly most of one of those artist alley islands.

616
00:40:58,881 --> 00:40:59,061
Rym: We'll

617
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:14,900
Scott: figure out how many tables we're gonna get and we'll get them all adjoining and we'll basically get a whole mess of tables And all the podcasters and all the front row crew peoples will have like this giant artist alley like row Like an alley within the alley of awesome and we can do awesome stuff in the middle, too.

618
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,057
Scott: If we if we get that much space, it'll be pretty cool.

619
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:20,708
Scott: All right What else is going down?

620
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,720
Scott: Well, I didn't write to our panels Friday.

621
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,580
Rym: We did three of our four panels and it was a light panel load not like the seven we did at Connecticut.

622
00:41:27,982 --> 00:41:32,540
Scott: Yep, especially since we I didn't have to do much for one and a half of the panels.

623
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:36,757
Rym: Yep, there was the podcasters roundtable, which was alright.

624
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:43,320
Scott: Yeah I mean basically we the ninja consultants did this panel and all the podcasters got up on stage.

625
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:47,820
Rym: I will say I think too many people were on stage and I agree much smaller.

626
00:41:48,061 --> 00:41:50,512
Scott: we should have had maybe six people at most.

627
00:41:50,713 --> 00:42:01,916
Scott: I'd say yeah, but basically, we went around and talked about podcasting for an hour and the audience said stuff and we had a good old jolly time, you know Talking to each other on stage.

628
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:06,274
Rym: credit Most of it was like Scott Dave and Joel talking to each other and ignoring the panel.

629
00:42:06,294 --> 00:42:14,760
Scott: cuz me Dave Joel and Gerald were all Sitting on the way end of the row and we only had one microphone between us So we could say things without them being heard.

630
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:26,380
Scott: So we were all whispering to each other and making jokes while everyone else is being serious about the panel and it was fun times Though I got to admit my favorite awkward moment was when that she basically asked everyone.

631
00:42:26,781 --> 00:42:29,909
Rym: So, uh, what anime or manga comic or video game?

632
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:35,023
Rym: Whatever related podcast you guys listen to or like and Dave and Joel are like nothing.

633
00:42:35,043 --> 00:42:39,050
Scott: and then we're like Derek the Bandits out of public.

634
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,120
Rym: That's not anime related damn straight.

635
00:42:41,662 --> 00:42:43,370
Rym: I gave a shot Byzantine emperors.

636
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:47,572
Rym: I gave a mad shout out to 12 Byzantine emperors And they're like, but don't you like any anime podcast?

637
00:42:47,613 --> 00:42:53,273
Rym: I'm like no Except for us animal order and Dave and Joel.

638
00:42:53,494 --> 00:42:55,300
Scott: Yeah, and then you consultants are like, you don't like us.

639
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,152
Scott: And I was like I listen to you.

640
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:59,046
Scott: sometimes I do listen to them.

641
00:42:59,086 --> 00:43:01,318
Rym: sometimes, you know, I've never actually listened to them.

642
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:05,886
Scott: I'll be honest They don't put out too many shows and some of their shows I'm not interested in.

643
00:43:05,946 --> 00:43:10,392
Scott: but when they do put out a show that I'm interested in, you know I check their website maybe once every couple weeks.

644
00:43:10,472 --> 00:43:11,900
Rym: I've never listened to the ninja consultants.

645
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:13,673
Rym: I listened to our five central once.

646
00:43:13,714 --> 00:43:21,636
Scott: when Gerald I Listen to wants to figure out what it was about I might listen to it - I guess he didn't know to con report or he's gonna.

647
00:43:21,676 --> 00:43:21,917
Scott: so I'll.

648
00:43:21,937 --> 00:43:22,640
Scott: maybe I'll listen to that.

649
00:43:23,141 --> 00:43:25,660
Scott: I'll pretty much listen to any Otakon report podcast.

650
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:33,380
Scott: So if anyone out there has a podcast with an Otakon report, I will listen to it Except this one because everyone recorded the panel.

651
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:38,080
Rym: We probably have the best audio of anyone because it was just people putting the recorders in the middle of the table.

652
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:45,914
Scott: Yeah, they put like their eye rivers and their creatives ends like on the table and push the button and we put our Marantz on The table and push the button.

653
00:43:45,934 --> 00:43:48,320
Rym: now I will say this isn't really a complaint about Otakon.

654
00:43:48,500 --> 00:44:03,480
Rym: But I gotta say while the people who do all the sound and audio-visual setup for all the rooms do a fantastic job There's a company called DSL and at Otakon that Otakon basically pays this company What must be a hajillion dollars, right?

655
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:13,067
Scott: And this company provides all of the audio-visual equipment for everything at Otakon from main events to the lowliest panel room And they do a good job.

656
00:44:13,268 --> 00:44:14,412
Rym: These guys know their stuff.

657
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:16,420
Scott: They're worth what Otakon pays them.

658
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:27,360
Rym: Yeah So I got to say anytime you see a panelist at Otakon who has trouble with their audio or trouble with their video and their Laptop, it is their fault and not Otakon's because Otakon's got their shit together.

659
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:30,678
Scott: Well DSL has their shit together and Otakon just says DSL handle it.

660
00:44:30,738 --> 00:44:33,978
Rym: Otakon By proxy has their shit together exactly.

661
00:44:34,018 --> 00:44:42,280
Rym: but DSL for two years running does not have the ability to give me a feed from their equipment to record every year.

662
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,906
Scott: I say they do it's just low-quality.

663
00:44:43,946 --> 00:44:44,668
Rym: No, they don't they don't.

664
00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:47,358
Rym: not low quality not exist in quality every year.

665
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:49,974
Rym: They say hey Here we'll give you a mono feed.

666
00:44:49,994 --> 00:44:51,743
Rym: is XLR okay, and I think oh great.

667
00:44:52,305 --> 00:44:59,960
Rym: and then I plug it in and I discover that the signal-to-noise ratio is to the point that you Can't hear anything but static.

668
00:45:00,802 --> 00:45:11,860
Scott: I think the problem is is that the equipment DSL uses is meant for you know being PA in a room and Making a loud noise that everyone turning a quiet noise into a loud noise.

669
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:25,220
Scott: So a lot of people can hear it and their equipment is used heavily shipped around a lot It's it's beat up and old and they basically don't replace anything unless they absolutely have to And it's not working.

670
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:47,020
Scott: So the if the the feature of being able to record the feed to recording device is not something they care about at all And thus a lot of their mixers are old and slightly combusted and will provide very noisy outputs for recording Especially since there's a lot of amplification going on which is their primary purpose is amplification.

671
00:45:47,148 --> 00:45:56,178
Rym: Yep now the best part was the guy was like well you sure your Equipment's good because I think I can given you a fine signal and I am absolutely certain that the guy was giving me nothing But said yeah, I was giving.

672
00:45:56,198 --> 00:45:59,377
Rym: you said he tried to play it off Like you should put a pad in front of it.

673
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:01,064
Rym: My signal might be too strong for you.

674
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,750
Rym: That is slightly possible.

675
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,472
Rym: No, it's not.

676
00:46:03,492 --> 00:46:09,090
Rym: I I humored him and tried it and of course all that did was make the static 20 decibels quieter.

677
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:09,509
Rym: Yep.

678
00:46:10,191 --> 00:46:16,070
Scott: Anyway, the only complaint I can have about the AV at Otakon is that in a lot of the rooms?

679
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:21,270
Scott: They have speakers in the front turned up way loud so that the audio can be heard in the back.

680
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:28,538
Scott: the result is if you sit in the way back you can hear but you can't see and if you sit in the way front you Can see but hearing is kind of bad.

681
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:32,290
Scott: plus it there's no stadium seating anywhere at Otakon so you can see.

682
00:46:32,732 --> 00:46:35,870
Scott: But if a tall guy with a cosplay sits in front of you forget about it.

683
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,370
Rym: All they need to do is stagger the chairs.

684
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,254
Rym: They need to stagger

685
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:51,931
Scott: the chairs and even if it costs a lot more money It's worth it to pay to put speakers in the back and possibly the sides of the larger rooms So that the volume is even throughout instead of you know, normal versus my ears hurt well.

686
00:46:51,971 --> 00:47:01,663
Rym: at the same time the real problem is that the vast majority of people who do anything at Otakon don't know how to use a Microphone and they either get way too close to the market.

687
00:47:01,683 --> 00:47:02,687
Scott: more about video rooms.

688
00:47:02,727 --> 00:47:05,983
Rym: with the audio I avoid video rooms, but I heard those complaints.

689
00:47:06,345 --> 00:47:14,450
Rym: but in terms of panels Everyone like grabbed the microphone and tried to swallow it and as a result everything was booming and loud and echoing and horrible.

690
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,370
Scott: There really needs to be some sort of thing where people use microphones properly.

691
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,930
Scott: I mean at the podcasting panel, there was some guy sitting next to us who I didn't know.

692
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:25,278
Scott: He's the only guy in the panel I didn't know and I was trying.

693
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:28,790
Scott: every time he talked he would lean up on the table to get into the microphone.

694
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:38,010
Scott: I'd be like dude just sit still the microphone is close enough pretty much ignore told him like three times Listen I started pulling the microphone away from him and he just kept leaning further and further over the table.

695
00:47:38,512 --> 00:47:39,657
Scott: I don't know what his problem was.

696
00:47:39,697 --> 00:47:40,721
Scott: Was he just deaf?

697
00:47:40,801 --> 00:47:41,163
Scott: I don't know.

698
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:42,308
Scott: He's a podcaster.

699
00:47:42,328 --> 00:47:44,174
Scott: He can't be deaf I don't know.

700
00:47:44,215 --> 00:47:45,924
Rym: I've listened to a lot of podcasts in my day.

701
00:47:45,944 --> 00:47:49,381
Scott: Oh All right, so that was that panel.

702
00:47:49,642 --> 00:47:50,769
Rym: yeah, it was alright it was fun.

703
00:47:51,031 --> 00:47:55,565
Scott: Yep, did they do the anime club panel, which did not involve us actually.

704
00:47:56,027 --> 00:47:56,910
Rym: Well, it involved me.

705
00:47:57,251 --> 00:48:03,757
Rym: Yeah, the thing is I'm our friend Scott Johnson ran it and he's you know He's been a new type before.

706
00:48:03,817 --> 00:48:05,790
Rym: he knows his shit when it comes to running anime clubs.

707
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:08,083
Scott: He does know and actually comes turning anime club.

708
00:48:08,103 --> 00:48:09,430
Rym: after all of our prodding.

709
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:19,023
Rym: He has finally started to work on his website to tell everyone exactly how to run an anime club because he pretty much knows Exactly how to run an anime club down to every single detail.

710
00:48:19,244 --> 00:48:29,569
Rym: Yep, but I will say Through not much fault of his own the anime club summit that was run at Otakon was pretty damn piss-poor And I was kind of embarrassed to be on it.

711
00:48:29,811 --> 00:48:34,230
Scott: Yeah, I was sitting there in the audience kind of playing my DS and going "errrrrrr".

712
00:48:34,491 --> 00:48:40,899
Rym: I was sitting to the side like far away from everyone else kind of lounging drinking something that looks suspiciously like water but might not have been.

713
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:45,693
Rym: and Basically, it was He'd say something.

714
00:48:45,974 --> 00:49:01,817
Rym: the other panelists would kind of sit there or they'd kind of mumble a little bit or they'd ramble a Nonsensical story for a while and then I'd be like well Here's the deal and I'd tell the whole deal and the whole crowd would laugh and then Scojo would say something all crowd would Laugh and everyone else was just kind of there.

715
00:49:02,138 --> 00:49:05,930
Scott: Yeah, basically the people there were kind of nervous not quick on their feet.

716
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,377
Rym: I know that they know their stuff.

717
00:49:07,497 --> 00:49:09,165
Rym: They just they they need to.

718
00:49:09,206 --> 00:49:10,130
Rym: I'm gonna be perfectly honest.

719
00:49:10,191 --> 00:49:11,748
Rym: They need to be better at speaking and speaking.

720
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:16,484
Rym: Yes, the panel should have just been me and Scott Johnson or just Scott Johnson.

721
00:49:16,906 --> 00:49:18,210
Rym: He alone could have done that panel.

722
00:49:18,644 --> 00:49:25,209
Scott: Yeah a lot of those people on that panel are there because they run big anime clubs and they have lots of experience and knowledge.

723
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:29,487
Scott: but Public speaking skills preparation for the panel not so much.

724
00:49:29,768 --> 00:49:34,304
Rym: Yes And I was so bad because I could tell Scojo would say something like blah blah blah.

725
00:49:34,685 --> 00:49:44,763
Rym: and we've run these panels before expecting someone on the panel to pick up and continue the thought and they just kind of sit there and then everyone would look at Me and I'd be like well and talk for 10 minutes.

726
00:49:45,104 --> 00:49:46,350
Scott: You could have done the panel on your own.

727
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,098
Scott: We did the panel.

728
00:49:47,158 --> 00:49:47,967
Scott: I think excellently.

729
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:52,970
Rym: a kinetic I gotta say that the anime club panel Scott and I ran in Connecticut was probably the best anime club.

730
00:49:53,772 --> 00:49:55,297
Scott: Scott Johnson, yes this Scott.

731
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:59,310
Rym: Yes, though if Scott Johnson had been there the panel would have only been better because he does know his stuff.

732
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:09,559
Scott: Yep I think that the key is to get one person someone on the panel who knows enough and knows what topics to discuss Right and is good at public speaking.

733
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:19,790
Scott: and if there's someone with the knowledge who isn't good at public speaking Then the public speaking person can manage them and get them to reveal their knowledge in a good way without having them ruin the panel.

734
00:50:20,992 --> 00:50:32,548
Rym: The other thing is and Scott and I did Scott Johnson and I disagree on this don't let the audience talk They're just gonna ask stupid questions or try to plug their own club or plug their own stuff or try to sound smart.

735
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:37,804
Rym: if you Want to take questions from the audience in a panel like that have someone with a wireless mic.

736
00:50:38,105 --> 00:50:49,469
Rym: go around like I did in the kendo Panel talk to the people off the microphone while the panels going on find out what their question is and then decide if they are Going to be given the mic or if you're going to ask the question for them.

737
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:52,259
Scott: That should be done in every panel ever period.

738
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,268
Rym: now were I Otakon I would find people.

739
00:50:55,288 --> 00:50:56,653
Rym: hum I wonder who?

740
00:50:56,673 --> 00:51:01,030
Rym: I wonder who's volunteered to do panel stuff for Otakon for the last four years?

741
00:51:01,351 --> 00:51:10,004
Rym: Yeah, find people who would be willing to go to a bunch of panels take the wireless mic around moderate officiate MC and take questions for the panelists.

742
00:51:10,366 --> 00:51:16,810
Rym: because I got to say Almost no panelists at Otakon who aren't industry know anything about dealing with the crowd.

743
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:20,909
Rym: they might know their stuff and do a good panel, but they don't know how to take questions from a crowd.

744
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:24,670
Rym: and Actually, there were a lot of complaints about just that at the con feedback session.

745
00:51:24,911 --> 00:51:31,330
Scott: Another problem is that actually a lot of panels they take questions from the crowd without a microphone at all.

746
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:36,889
Scott: So no one can hear what the crowd is saying at all Like when you were asking questions at the Bandai visual panel.

747
00:51:37,492 --> 00:51:41,406
Scott: I've watched the video recording of the Bandai visual panel on anime news network.

748
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:42,570
Scott: Well, I skimmed through it.

749
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:48,630
Scott: I didn't watch the whole thing and You couldn't hear any audience question at all because they never gave the audience the microphone to ask questions.

750
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,842
Scott: They just yelled it out and not everyone is loud.

751
00:51:52,424 --> 00:51:54,649
Rym: We should probably talk about that panel briefly All right.

752
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:56,396
Rym: So Bandai visual did their thing.

753
00:51:56,696 --> 00:52:03,761
Rym: then of course pretty much everyone in the room was there Specifically to call them out on the pricing again.

754
00:52:03,922 --> 00:52:11,021
Scott: So, you know Bandai visual is a American company that releases Anime, they're pretty new.

755
00:52:11,222 --> 00:52:13,010
Scott: They're not the same as Bandai entertainment.

756
00:52:13,191 --> 00:52:18,129
Scott: They have nothing to do with like the Gundam seed release the cowboy bebop release or anything like that.

757
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:19,199
Scott: They're there.

758
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:35,010
Scott: they're releasing basically these awesome mostly awesome anime shows that are kind of old and that we really like like the gun buster and The what other ones I forget but mostly gun buster now as well as other awesome animes.

759
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:42,302
Scott: pat labore Yeah, I forget but they're releasing many awesome animes that we want to watch.

760
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:50,021
Scott: the problem is they're releasing them in a freedom Obviously, they're releasing them in a format which we don't give a shit about.

761
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:57,726
Scott: they are releasing them in like super HD super high-quality Amazing whatever's for like 40 bucks for two episodes.

762
00:52:57,786 --> 00:52:58,649
Scott: It's yeah to Chris.

763
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:02,265
Rym: now There have been famous panels and other cars where people called this guy out.

764
00:53:02,285 --> 00:53:16,370
Scott: Yeah at Sakura con They called this guy out and basically when he this guy the same guy was doing the same panel and he's like yeah at Sakura con I had a trouble blah blah blah and he pretty much said we will not change the price.

765
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:24,939
Rym: Yep, but the question was asked like four different times at the panel and he kind of just basically said yeah We know there's nothing we can do about it.

766
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:41,405
Scott: I mean the question I asked was You know, I understand you're not going to change the price But you understand that there are other anime companies which are selling like 26 episodes for $30 and you're selling five episodes for $50.

767
00:53:41,405 --> 00:53:43,390
Rym: you understand this five episodes more like two.

768
00:53:43,912 --> 00:53:45,881
Scott: Well, there wasn't one disc in particular.

769
00:53:45,921 --> 00:53:48,071
Scott: They were selling five episodes for $50.

770
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:52,047
Scott: I think it's one of their cheaper discs actually and I'll take you understand this right.

771
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:57,439
Scott: and he was like, yep Yep, we under I'm like, all right I'm Netflixing your shit and not buying it.

772
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:03,470
Rym: Yep, but I asked a question about Renting and a Netflix and all that sort of thing and he didn't really understand it.

773
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:04,574
Rym: He answered a different question.

774
00:54:04,635 --> 00:54:08,952
Rym: But yeah, the thing is a lot of people give this guy grief and he's doing the best He can.

775
00:54:08,992 --> 00:54:09,776
Rym: it's not his fault.

776
00:54:09,896 --> 00:54:10,700
Rym: He's a pretty nice guy.

777
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,548
Scott: He is the head of Bandai Visual though.

778
00:54:12,589 --> 00:54:21,330
Rym: Yeah I have a feeling that the company realizes that they have possibly made a mistake and for whatever reason can't back down now.

779
00:54:21,793 --> 00:54:22,095
Scott: I don't know.

780
00:54:22,235 --> 00:54:24,490
Scott: Maybe they've already made some decisions and it's too late.

781
00:54:24,574 --> 00:54:28,541
Scott: whatever The point is Bandai Visual rent all their anime.

782
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:31,189
Scott: if an anime is put out by Bandai Visual rent it and watch it.

783
00:54:31,571 --> 00:54:34,224
Scott: Don't buy it unless it gets really cheap in a bargain bin.

784
00:54:34,465 --> 00:54:35,470
Rym: I recorded the whole panel.

785
00:54:35,852 --> 00:54:36,536
Rym: I'm not gonna bother.

786
00:54:36,556 --> 00:54:39,050
Scott: you can watch the whole panel on anime news network in video.

787
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:43,848
Rym: Yeah, mostly I recorded just about everything at Otakon not for you guys, but just for our own reference.

788
00:54:44,069 --> 00:54:47,849
Scott: Yep Okay, so now let's talk about the important panel.

789
00:54:48,432 --> 00:54:56,970
Rym: So Friday night after the podcast immediately after the podcast Yes as an 18 plus and we had an awesome staff or who helped us work all that out.

790
00:54:57,171 --> 00:54:57,914
Rym: Yep, I fall.

791
00:54:57,934 --> 00:54:58,939
Rym: I wish I knew that guy's name.

792
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,030
Scott: Let's talk about 18 plus to the con for a second.

793
00:55:01,253 --> 00:55:07,109
Scott: All right at Otakon There some events are 18 plus which means you need to be 18 years or older to get in.

794
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:09,249
Scott: Usually these are hentai panels and such.

795
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:13,989
Scott: In order to get into these panels You can't just show up at the panel with your ID.

796
00:55:14,552 --> 00:55:19,950
Scott: The reasoning behind this is that they don't want to have someone at the door checking ID because it takes forever.

797
00:55:20,211 --> 00:55:24,370
Scott: They would rather have you check ID at some other point in time at some other place.

798
00:55:24,731 --> 00:55:28,304
Scott: Then they give you a wristband and then it's really easy to check wristbands.

799
00:55:28,344 --> 00:55:28,786
Scott: It's like yes.

800
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:29,027
Scott: Yes.

801
00:55:29,067 --> 00:55:29,268
Scott: Yes.

802
00:55:29,308 --> 00:55:29,509
Scott: Yes.

803
00:55:29,549 --> 00:55:31,695
Scott: Yes Yes, yes and the panel rooms can go smoothly.

804
00:55:31,715 --> 00:55:42,750
Rym: the other reason is that pretty much without fail all of the 18 plus programming because it tends To be Friday and Saturday night when everyone's itching to do something Already are gonna fill and a lot of people are gonna be turned away.

805
00:55:43,212 --> 00:55:46,504
Rym: So anything you can do to streamline the process and

806
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:47,970
Scott: not have a giant line at the door

807
00:55:48,131 --> 00:55:57,311
Rym: If someone didn't plan ahead and get their wristband to get in There are a lot of people who would probably rather see the panel than the one person who decided the last minute to go walk Into it.

808
00:55:57,572 --> 00:55:57,732
Scott: Yep.

809
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,180
Scott: So those are the reasons they do it that way.

810
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,595
Scott: I personally think there could be a better way But I'm not sure how.

811
00:56:04,616 --> 00:56:07,290
Scott: I'm not sure what it is and it does solve some problems.

812
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:10,103
Scott: I also do think that maybe they could.

813
00:56:10,364 --> 00:56:10,766
Scott: I don't know.

814
00:56:11,088 --> 00:56:19,104
Scott: but whatever It's also I mean it is widely Publicized that you need to get the wristband but not widely publicized enough.

815
00:56:19,565 --> 00:56:20,830
Scott: It could be done a little bit better.

816
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:24,045
Rym: I think they just need to have one big warning in the con book.

817
00:56:24,065 --> 00:56:36,910
Rym: Their priority is I didn't read it There is it's not it's not super big But they need at least one big sign at the registration line saying maybe they could say something to you when you get your badge ah Or maybe you could get certified badges or something.

818
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:45,029
Scott: Yeah, like when you get your badge they could be like are you planning to go to any 18+ events and they you already show Them your ID when you get your badge, right?

819
00:56:45,811 --> 00:56:48,122
Scott: So why not like, you know put a thing on the badge?

820
00:56:48,182 --> 00:56:52,705
Scott: when I guess you can't put a thing on the badge It has to be a wristband because you could just give your badge to a kid.

821
00:56:52,745 --> 00:56:54,785
Rym: Yeah, regardless it works Well enough as they do it.

822
00:56:54,948 --> 00:56:56,414
Rym: Yep So they cleared the room out.

823
00:56:56,675 --> 00:57:02,516
Rym: the staffer warned everyone like a bunch of times that it's gonna be some sort of horrible offensive panel Like these panels always are.

824
00:57:02,537 --> 00:57:03,019
Rym: Yep.

825
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,547
Rym: Now I'm gonna tell you all our secret.

826
00:57:04,628 --> 00:57:17,870
Rym: originally We'd planned to just do this Scott and I just like we done at Connecticut and We wanted to make it 18+ Just to guarantee ourselves the awesome Friday or Saturday night time slot and we weren't planning to do anything really horrible.

827
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:24,790
Scott: Well, the other thing is that we had noticed that in years past the 18+ panels at Otakon filled up to the brim with people.

828
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:28,524
Scott: So we said hey our panels don't usually fill up to the brim.

829
00:57:28,865 --> 00:57:39,198
Scott: if we made it 18+ Even if it didn't need to be 18+ Maybe a bunch of perverts would come and then we could do a double switch and educate them when they thought they were gonna be titillated.

830
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:43,850
Rym: of course Gerald really wanted to do this panel with us and we like Gerald.

831
00:57:44,412 --> 00:57:49,190
Rym: So we decided to actually go with the 18+ content and let Gerald do whatever he wanted.

832
00:57:49,461 --> 00:57:55,950
Scott: Yes The idea was we'd lure them in with this awesome 18+ content and also educate them at the same time.

833
00:57:56,050 --> 00:58:00,421
Scott: So it would be humorous pos- I don't think titillating but humorous.

834
00:58:00,762 --> 00:58:02,146
Rym: Well, I hope not titillating.

835
00:58:02,186 --> 00:58:16,167
Scott: No, it would be humorous and sexually charged and violent and educational all at once so that people would leave our panel being Entertained shocked and educated and generally have a good feeling about it.

836
00:58:16,187 --> 00:58:25,203
Rym: now on that front I think we succeeded because not only did we get a full-on standing ovation and not only did only Three people walk out of the panel in disgust.

837
00:58:25,424 --> 00:58:26,530
Scott: I didn't even I wasn't paying it.

838
00:58:26,811 --> 00:58:27,354
Scott: That's one thing.

839
00:58:27,374 --> 00:58:32,403
Scott: when I'm doing a panel like I look at the audience But I'm not paying attention to people coming and going.

840
00:58:32,504 --> 00:58:33,550
Scott: or how many people are there?

841
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:37,270
Rym: So it's oh see I actually I say I count people in the panel room.

842
00:58:37,512 --> 00:58:39,770
Rym: I count how many people come in late accounting people leave.

843
00:58:40,293 --> 00:58:42,990
Rym: I can't keep an eye on everyone in the panel and see if they're interested.

844
00:58:43,191 --> 00:58:45,058
Rym: Anyone looks like they're trying to say something.

845
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:50,950
Scott: if anyone looks like they're not having a good people trying to say something I usually notice because they'll raise their hand or they'll go up something.

846
00:58:51,412 --> 00:58:58,330
Rym: But of the three people who stormed out in disgust one of them stormed out right away And I think he just he thought the panel was about something else.

847
00:58:58,511 --> 00:59:03,930
Scott: I think I didn't realize this at first, but we titled our panel get he got putting the man back in manga.

848
00:59:04,112 --> 00:59:06,150
Rym: I think a lot of people thought it was a yaoi panel.

849
00:59:06,271 --> 00:59:07,680
Scott: I didn't even realize that like.

850
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,776
Scott: it didn't even occur to me that it could be misconstrued in family panel.

851
00:59:10,816 --> 00:59:17,861
Rym: two different people came by the artist alley table and said man I thought you guys were running yaoi panel, but what you ran was awesome.

852
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:18,644
Rym: So I stayed.

853
00:59:18,925 --> 00:59:22,929
Scott: yep, but yeah next time We'll just come up with a better name for it.

854
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:27,830
Rym: The other two people who walked out in disgust were actually good friends of ours and they walked out at the very end.

855
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:35,153
Scott: Yeah, yeah, so man a lot of people on the Internet's were actually oh that girl sitting in the back and I was like That was my friend.

856
00:59:35,254 --> 00:59:38,390
Rym: Yeah, so many people came up to us and we're like man.

857
00:59:38,471 --> 00:59:41,450
Rym: I hope no one complained about your panel that that girly rock walked out.

858
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:44,683
Rym: She seemed super pissed and I was like, she's a really good friend of ours.

859
00:59:44,704 --> 00:59:45,467
Rym: Don't worry about it.

860
00:59:45,647 --> 00:59:48,130
Rym: Yeah Actually, I was kind of sad.

861
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:52,005
Rym: I wish she'd made more of a stink because I totally wanted to go Orlando Calrissian on her.

862
00:59:52,367 --> 01:00:10,259
Scott: Yeah, but anyway We ran this panel and since we failed to bring any visual aids basically me and Raim gave our educational talks about the history of manga the history of Gekiga Osamu Tezuka and all these awesome manga because they're full of Politics and Yakuza and things like that.

863
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,744
Rym: It was basically the same panel.

864
01:00:11,764 --> 01:00:16,847
Rym: We ran at Connecticut only I Wasn't tired and exhausted and there were a lot more people.

865
01:00:17,029 --> 01:00:29,158
Scott: Yep so we did that and Interspersed with that Gerald showed the awesomest scenes from Kazuo Koike mangas Awesomest being a relative term exactly.

866
01:00:29,218 --> 01:00:44,310
Scott: basically if you read something like sanctuary, right sanctuary I'd say 90% of the pages perhaps 95% of the pages in sanctuary involve Yakuza drama politics or something or something along those lines.

867
01:00:44,904 --> 01:00:58,406
Scott: But 5% of the pages contain some sort of eroticism, you know Sometimes rape sometimes a tree hookers an eyeball sometimes people getting shot and your crazy things happen.

868
01:00:59,069 --> 01:01:01,417
Scott: and That's just the style of these manga.

869
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:10,223
Scott: is that there is you know, very I guess not realistic But wanting to be realistic plots and they combine it with.

870
01:01:10,324 --> 01:01:14,409
Scott: you know, when sex happens when violence happens They don't hold back and illustrating it.

871
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:21,045
Rym: so basically was the three of us being educational for a while and then Gerald showing the choice bits from Kazuo Koike manga.

872
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:22,192
Scott: So if you read.

873
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:31,285
Rym: watching the crowd react to these scene was amazing because basically the crowd would be like ha Laugh laugh laugh laugh even louder.

874
01:01:31,607 --> 01:01:35,201
Rym: Laugh riotously Laugh quietly and nervously.

875
01:01:35,221 --> 01:01:36,166
Rym: Yeah go.

876
01:01:36,548 --> 01:01:36,689
Rym: Ah.

877
01:01:38,052 --> 01:01:39,075
Rym: But then start laughing.

878
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:51,706
Scott: cuz if you read a Kazuo Koike manga that isn't lone wolf and cub, right You'll notice that you know, it'll be this very serious Usually historical, you know sort of melodrama.

879
01:01:51,746 --> 01:01:52,730
Scott: That's pretty awesome.

880
01:01:53,352 --> 01:02:04,196
Scott: And then a kid when there's a crazy scene will happen Kazuo Koike just goes all out and does the craziest most rapist Violent fucked up thing.

881
01:02:04,236 --> 01:02:05,841
Rym: you can imagine which is kind.

882
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:06,905
Rym: I mean, that's gecky god.

883
01:02:06,925 --> 01:02:07,607
Rym: That's part of it.

884
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:08,410
Scott: That's part of it.

885
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:15,549
Scott: It's not necessary to the I guess artistic movement, but that that that's what Kazuo Koike does, you know.

886
01:02:16,054 --> 01:02:17,451
Scott: Imagine if like, you know You're.

887
01:02:17,491 --> 01:02:26,056
Scott: just imagine if the matrix instead of the scenes with the cool action fighting were scenes with like just crazy Necrophilia something I don't know.

888
01:02:26,518 --> 01:02:30,090
Rym: now to quote Gerald the panel might have been too hardcore for Otakon.

889
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:37,750
Scott: I think the panel was too hardcore for pretty much Most anime conventions, but that's okay because we're hardcore.

890
01:02:37,971 --> 01:02:52,915
Rym: Well, the thing is the only real issue with our panel and we realized it after the fact I didn't think it would have been as big of an issue is that We were busy and did not prepare our visual aids partly because we couldn't find our copies of sanctuary Because we're dumb shits.

891
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:54,099
Rym: Emily had moved them off.

892
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:55,001
Scott: I still can't find them.

893
01:02:55,362 --> 01:02:56,165
Rym: They're right there.

894
01:02:56,365 --> 01:02:57,990
Rym: They were moved up one shelf.

895
01:02:58,091 --> 01:02:58,653
Scott: I just looked.

896
01:02:58,674 --> 01:02:59,136
Scott: they weren't there.

897
01:02:59,277 --> 01:02:59,458
Rym: They're.

898
01:02:59,498 --> 01:03:01,870
Scott: they're gonna go look after the show regardless.

899
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:04,849
Rym: Emily moved them up one shelf and we were stupid and couldn't find him.

900
01:03:05,051 --> 01:03:09,450
Rym: All right, so we didn't come with any visual aids, but Gerald had all of his visual aids.

901
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:25,068
Scott: So, of course while equal time was given to our educational miss and Gerald's crazy awesomeness in quotes the crazy awesomeness seemed to take over the mind share of the panel because it was visual whereas ours was just us talking.

902
01:03:25,429 --> 01:03:37,310
Rym: granted it It didn't seem to matter because seriously the panel was a rousing success and the number of people who told us it was awesome or Demanded that we give them contact information so they could check out our show.

903
01:03:37,952 --> 01:03:41,803
Rym: We got so many listeners from that panel good God and Katsucon was already like.

904
01:03:42,024 --> 01:03:47,528
Scott: you were running that exact panel at Katsucon Aaron writer who is the guy who I think he's the head of programming at Katsucon.

905
01:03:47,568 --> 01:03:47,870
Scott: now, right?

906
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:50,461
Scott: He was the head of gaming at Katsucon last whatever he is.

907
01:03:50,501 --> 01:03:52,330
Rym: He's a big shot and he's also a really cool guy.

908
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:52,995
Scott: He's awesome.

909
01:03:53,136 --> 01:03:53,943
Scott: I like him a lot.

910
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:54,750
Scott: He's way cool.

911
01:03:54,991 --> 01:04:01,019
Scott: He helped us out at Katsucon last year awesomely and he was at our gecky got panel and he was awesome And he's still awesome.

912
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:01,885
Scott: Awesome guy.

913
01:04:01,946 --> 01:04:06,403
Scott: Aaron writer Alright, so then we were done for the night.

914
01:04:06,483 --> 01:04:07,949
Scott: Our panel was like midnight to 1 a.m.

915
01:04:08,551 --> 01:04:11,990
Scott: We went back to our hotel room and then rims phone rang.

916
01:04:12,051 --> 01:04:14,330
Scott: But he didn't pick it up because he's looked at the phone number.

917
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:16,550
Scott: He didn't know who it was and then my phone rang.

918
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:22,116
Scott: So I picked it up and it was the person from panels at Otakon and I. they're like Can you come back to the con?

919
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,914
Scott: and I was like, uh, I don't know Rym Can we go back to the con?

920
01:04:26,075 --> 01:04:28,925
Scott: Obviously our panel was intense and we're gonna get in trouble.

921
01:04:29,206 --> 01:04:31,077
Rym: I was like, alright, whatever We'll go back.

922
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:35,786
Scott: So we went back Badgeless, I didn't bring my badge in case they tried to take it away.

923
01:04:35,926 --> 01:04:36,590
Scott: I wouldn't have it.

924
01:04:37,032 --> 01:04:39,426
Rym: I didn't bring my badge because I didn't think I needed my badge.

925
01:04:39,566 --> 01:04:43,170
Scott: Yeah We didn't need our badge because the staff person brought us right through.

926
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:43,610
Rym: Yep.

927
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:48,370
Rym: So we go back and they bring us in and we're worried like alright did people complain about the panel?

928
01:04:48,711 --> 01:04:49,898
Scott: Which I'm gonna get in trouble.

929
01:04:49,938 --> 01:04:51,365
Scott: I mean it wasn't 18 plus panel.

930
01:04:51,386 --> 01:04:52,230
Scott: What are we gonna get in trouble?

931
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:56,489
Rym: The thing is the two reasons why I didn't think we were in trouble is that one come few years ago?

932
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:00,301
Rym: Otakon showed without an 18 plus anything.

933
01:05:00,702 --> 01:05:02,770
Rym: that is another thing Ola syndrome.

934
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:16,770
Scott: I gotta say Otakon they do this 18 plus panel business but they show things in the video rooms late at night Friday and Saturday with no 18 plus checking and I actually think they should Have 18 plus checking on some of that.

935
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:20,430
Rym: Yeah, because seriously if you're under 18, you should not have been able to watch Ebola syndrome.

936
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:22,257
Scott: You should not be watching each of the killer.

937
01:05:22,357 --> 01:05:25,630
Scott: You probably shouldn't be watching killing machine, which I'll talk about soon enough.

938
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:35,981
Rym: Yeah well The worst thing was that Ebola syndrome pretty much headlined like one of the opening scenes was something worse than pretty much our All of Gerald's part of our panel combined.

939
01:05:36,081 --> 01:05:37,566
Rym: Yes, so like one scene.

940
01:05:37,627 --> 01:05:38,530
Scott: so there was no way.

941
01:05:38,731 --> 01:05:42,250
Scott: I thought we were gonna actually get in serious trouble because I would have whipped out.

942
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:45,650
Scott: Well, you showed Ebola syndrome at this con, you know, what happens in Ebola syndrome.

943
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,149
Scott: You showed each of the killer at this con.

944
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:49,338
Scott: Nothing we did was worse than each of the killer.

945
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:52,310
Rym: and the other thing was that I remember from the panel.

946
01:05:52,812 --> 01:05:57,530
Rym: Not only did no one walk out in disgust except one guy who walked out in the beginning before anything horrible.

947
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:58,213
Scott: Yeah, he made.

948
01:05:58,253 --> 01:06:01,930
Scott: he walked out when he made our disclaimer and described what the panel was gonna be about.

949
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:08,150
Rym: We were basically like this is going to be a very offensive panel talking about some old very sexist Japanese literature.

950
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:10,889
Scott: I think Gerald actually started the panel with who likes rape?

951
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:18,350
Rym: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so people were fully warned as to what the panel may or may not be about.

952
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:24,748
Rym: yeah, but also no one else walked out and Every every single person who was in the room gave a standing ovation.

953
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:34,630
Scott: Yep So I think what had happened is Khan somehow heard that I guess From people walking around or I don't know how they heard or maybe someone did complain that stayed the whole time.

954
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:48,010
Scott: I don't know that our panel was like a rape Glorifying panel of some sort which if you walked in at the wrong time and stayed for the wrong amount of time It could be construed as such easily, but it was not in any way.

955
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:56,143
Rym: I think the main reason for that was that now I realize I think I'm gonna put my mr Tokai rape allegory section comparison at the end of the panel.

956
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,030
Rym: Yep, followed by the ode to cure.

957
01:06:58,130 --> 01:07:03,953
Scott: Yeah, so if we just rearrange the panel we can avoid all possibilities of Misconstruing what the pen.

958
01:07:03,974 --> 01:07:10,680
Rym: if anything I want to start with Gerald stuff and then move into the educational and say See as horrible as that is.

959
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:11,784
Rym: look what it turned into.

960
01:07:12,065 --> 01:07:12,286
Scott: Yep.

961
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:13,210
Scott: That's a good move, too.

962
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:16,610
Rym: But regardless by the time we get there cuz it took us a while to walk back to the con.

963
01:07:17,151 --> 01:07:30,510
Rym: the staffer the Otakon staffer who had been in the room for the entire panel who had kicked all the young kids out and who Would basically run everything for us had already been there defending us and telling the people who were concerned how awesome our panel was.

964
01:07:30,931 --> 01:07:33,259
Scott: Yep, so mad props to that awesome guy.

965
01:07:33,279 --> 01:07:34,905
Scott: He knew what the score was.

966
01:07:34,945 --> 01:07:36,230
Scott: He knew our panel was awesome.

967
01:07:36,692 --> 01:07:43,197
Rym: So I think it was as dang from the staff was there and actually the panels person Meredith the whole time It was like I'm sorry to bring you out here.

968
01:07:43,217 --> 01:07:44,843
Rym: Don't worry about it.

969
01:07:44,883 --> 01:07:46,228
Rym: Just just don't worry about it.

970
01:07:46,268 --> 01:07:46,649
Rym: Come on in.

971
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:50,321
Rym: Yeah, so everyone everyone is super apologetic and we finally get there.

972
01:07:50,341 --> 01:07:54,715
Rym: He's like so, uh, I heard some things What was your panel about?

973
01:07:55,237 --> 01:08:03,907
Scott: and then we explained what our panel was about and he basically said oh I'm less angry now that I know what your panels about and this taff guy says you're not lying.

974
01:08:03,987 --> 01:08:07,428
Scott: So you're okay Yep, and we're like, yes, we understand.

975
01:08:07,448 --> 01:08:11,890
Rym: now I think we could do a whole show about how to get out of trouble or how to not get in trouble.

976
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:13,676
Rym: But it's very simple be us.

977
01:08:13,696 --> 01:08:14,398
Scott: You won't get in trouble.

978
01:08:14,418 --> 01:08:15,060
Rym: There's not be us.

979
01:08:15,121 --> 01:08:17,328
Rym: It's more simple than it act like it frickin.

980
01:08:17,348 --> 01:08:18,773
Rym: professional I mean.

981
01:08:19,115 --> 01:08:25,099
Rym: we recorded the whole panel not for to put in the show or anything But just because that's what professionals do.

982
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:26,524
Rym: we keep archival footage.

983
01:08:26,706 --> 01:08:27,510
Rym: We cover our butts.

984
01:08:27,712 --> 01:08:28,988
Rym: We do everything by the book.

985
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:31,661
Rym: We're prepared for any eventuality.

986
01:08:31,962 --> 01:08:36,197
Rym: if someone had been offended at the panel We were ready to deal with that and explain ourselves.

987
01:08:36,537 --> 01:08:40,490
Scott: Yep, and it didn't take much to avoid any sort of trouble.

988
01:08:41,051 --> 01:08:49,115
Scott: I think it also helped that the panel was super popular and also that we didn't do anything actually stupid like I don't know Live reenactments.

989
01:08:49,555 --> 01:08:50,779
Rym: we did do live reenact.

990
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,127
Scott: I met live reenactment actually the other stuff.

991
01:08:53,247 --> 01:09:03,167
Rym: Scott and I reenacted a scene from sanctuary and That Specific moment was cited by almost ten people as being the most awesome part of the panel.

992
01:09:03,488 --> 01:09:04,270
Scott: It was a good part.

993
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:05,573
Scott: I think we should get in the panel.

994
01:09:05,694 --> 01:09:12,599
Rym: a non from Apple geeks came over and class my shoulder and was and he wants to read Sanctuary and Eagle so hard he could cry now.

995
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:15,290
Scott: Yeah, I think we should do that reenactment again.

996
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:19,328
Scott: But if you actually show the manga on the screen while we do it, yeah, that'd be pretty cool.

997
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:24,390
Rym: Plus, I think you said the line wrong, but it didn't matter because you said these the same line in spirit.

998
01:09:24,852 --> 01:09:27,161
Scott: Yep, I think I actually did say the same line.

999
01:09:27,182 --> 01:09:29,832
Rym: No, cuz I think he said it hurts so much I could cry.

1000
01:09:29,853 --> 01:09:30,555
Rym: that's what I said.

1001
01:09:30,617 --> 01:09:32,566
Rym: You said it hurts like hell did I?

1002
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:34,912
Scott: Yeah Doesn't matter.

1003
01:09:34,973 --> 01:09:43,109
Scott: I think cuz that just now when I said I'm pretty sure the line is it hurts so much I could cry at least as translated in the Viz publication.

1004
01:09:43,189 --> 01:09:48,024
Rym: Yeah, not like try gun where the bad translation was actually better than the real translation in that one scene.

1005
01:09:48,345 --> 01:09:48,728
Scott: Yeah.

1006
01:09:48,968 --> 01:09:51,689
Rym: Yeah All right, regardless the gecky got panel.

1007
01:09:52,332 --> 01:10:00,335
Rym: Expect to see the final polished version at Katsucon and the New York and we're gonna do it at the New York Anime Festival I'm pretty sure.

1008
01:10:00,355 --> 01:10:01,258
Rym: Oh, man.

1009
01:10:01,338 --> 01:10:02,503
Rym: I gotta work out the details.

1010
01:10:02,523 --> 01:10:09,010
Rym: still is probably just gonna be you and me but The New York Anime Festival we met the guy Peter to terror who I've been working with.

1011
01:10:09,512 --> 01:10:12,462
Rym: I think the New York Anime Festival is gonna be hot the more I learn about it.

1012
01:10:12,482 --> 01:10:13,446
Rym: They're doing everything right.

1013
01:10:13,486 --> 01:10:18,765
Scott: at first I was Apprehensive because it's an anime convention in New York City in the Javits.

1014
01:10:18,805 --> 01:10:20,030
Scott: That's a recipe for disaster.

1015
01:10:20,411 --> 01:10:23,824
Scott: It's being run by read exhibitions the same people who run the New York Comic Con.

1016
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:30,066
Scott: further recipe for disaster According to the book of Scott only because anime cons are not like comic con.

1017
01:10:30,106 --> 01:10:32,995
Scott: Yes, however Every all the signs.

1018
01:10:33,096 --> 01:10:39,737
Scott: now after learning about the New York Anime Festival and speaking to people who are closer involved with it They are outsourcing.

1019
01:10:39,757 --> 01:10:41,846
Scott: I don't know how much of it is official.

1020
01:10:41,886 --> 01:10:42,870
Scott: So don't believe everything.

1021
01:10:42,931 --> 01:10:46,775
Scott: I don't give any specifics, but but they're Outsourcing a core.

1022
01:10:46,815 --> 01:10:51,870
Scott: from what I have heard in the rumor mill a lot of the things at their convention to

1023
01:10:52,413 --> 01:10:52,755
Rym: People

1024
01:10:52,795 --> 01:11:03,850
Scott: who have done it before like I heard that they're letting Katsucon Which has excellent video gaming do their video gaming and they're letting someone else who does excellent video rooms do their video rooms.

1025
01:11:04,231 --> 01:11:09,550
Scott: Thus, they don't have to learn how to do anime con things from scratch.

1026
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:13,547
Scott: They're letting people who have already done it for many many years do it at their con.

1027
01:11:13,607 --> 01:11:23,860
Scott: in addition Thus, basically, it's sort of like the best of the best like the anime northeast anime cons greatest hits in a way And I hope that's what it turns out to be.

1028
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,030
Scott: I'm still not a hundred percent confident.

1029
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:26,753
Scott: It'll be awesome.

1030
01:11:27,234 --> 01:11:29,844
Scott: But the more I learn the more confidence I get.

1031
01:11:30,045 --> 01:11:32,889
Rym: we're running some shows there So I think it's gonna be good.

1032
01:11:33,176 --> 01:11:33,750
Scott: It'll be good.

1033
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:39,169
Scott: The parts that we do will be good even if the rest of the con fails because we will not let our parts go down.

1034
01:11:39,854 --> 01:11:41,710
Scott: Well, we won't let it happen, all right.

1035
01:11:42,233 --> 01:11:50,190
Rym: So the fact that we had all our panels on Friday was great because Saturday We pretty much just relaxed in our artist alley table took turns talking to people.

1036
01:11:51,152 --> 01:11:52,277
Rym: We met a lot of awesome people.

1037
01:11:52,297 --> 01:11:53,905
Rym: I'm not gonna even try to do shout outs.

1038
01:11:54,247 --> 01:11:54,910
Scott: People are awesome.

1039
01:11:55,051 --> 01:11:56,618
Scott: If you met us, there you go.

1040
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:03,887
Rym: people didn't meet us not as awesome And of course by next year because like I promised we were very close to having all the swag done.

1041
01:12:04,289 --> 01:12:11,190
Rym: next year I think we're gonna have a double wide table and we'll be selling all sorts of GeekNights stuff as Supposed to giving you a piece of paper and doing surveys.

1042
01:12:13,351 --> 01:12:19,006
Scott: Yeah, the only things I could say about the artists alley is that the running of the artists alley awesome perfect in every way.

1043
01:12:19,447 --> 01:12:22,396
Scott: the guy Who ran it also awesome.

1044
01:12:22,837 --> 01:12:25,165
Scott: the art show run awesomely.

1045
01:12:25,546 --> 01:12:29,019
Scott: not as much art I was interested in as last year.

1046
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:30,083
Rym: I don't know for me.

1047
01:12:30,123 --> 01:12:31,288
Rym: I thought it was better than last year.

1048
01:12:31,308 --> 01:12:31,810
Rym: Really?

1049
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:35,310
Scott: Two years ago was the one I'm thinking.

1050
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:41,828
Rym: Yeah, but the quality of the art not just in the art show But in the art Sally as a whole was like super high this year.

1051
01:12:42,009 --> 01:12:45,339
Scott: average I think the average quality was way super high.

1052
01:12:45,399 --> 01:12:48,007
Scott: like there was no bad art in the artists alley like.

1053
01:12:48,047 --> 01:12:50,706
Scott: so the average of the Quality of art was like way up there.

1054
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:51,572
Scott: They're just.

1055
01:12:51,692 --> 01:12:56,610
Scott: personally there was not as many things that caught my eye and made me really excited.

1056
01:12:56,791 --> 01:13:00,308
Scott: There was like one person by these awesome stickers and I bought all their stickers.

1057
01:13:00,348 --> 01:13:00,830
Scott: They're awesome.

1058
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:02,697
Scott: I wish I had the stickers to tell you their website.

1059
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:06,030
Scott: But other than that it was like, oh, that's really cool.

1060
01:13:06,271 --> 01:13:07,074
Scott: That's really cool.

1061
01:13:07,235 --> 01:13:08,138
Scott: That's pretty awesome.

1062
01:13:08,459 --> 01:13:12,435
Scott: But nothing that was like, oh man's I need this his money I don't mean personally.

1063
01:13:12,455 --> 01:13:16,370
Rym: the things I really wanted were but I'd we bit Scott bit on it and it went for way.

1064
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:17,595
Scott: I was in the art show.

1065
01:13:17,615 --> 01:13:17,877
Scott: Yeah.

1066
01:13:17,957 --> 01:13:19,926
Rym: Yeah, there was the curry beau shoe art.

1067
01:13:20,147 --> 01:13:20,850
Rym: That was awesome.

1068
01:13:21,211 --> 01:13:21,995
Scott: No, she was.

1069
01:13:22,055 --> 01:13:24,766
Rym: there was all those renditions of the Greek gods that were just.

1070
01:13:24,786 --> 01:13:25,590
Scott: those are also.

1071
01:13:25,754 --> 01:13:30,207
Rym: Oh my gosh I would have paid a lot of money for those but they went for even more than I wanted to pay.

1072
01:13:30,227 --> 01:13:36,463
Scott: I should have written down who did them to contact them if anyone remembers because Seriously that was some hot shit.

1073
01:13:36,604 --> 01:13:37,350
Scott: That was very hot.

1074
01:13:37,471 --> 01:13:40,770
Rym: Also, I'm we recorded something there, but I'm not gonna bother find it and play in it.

1075
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:46,126
Rym: But in the 18 plus area of the art show there was something awesome in there.

1076
01:13:46,247 --> 01:13:48,472
Rym: There was something fantastic In there.

1077
01:13:48,813 --> 01:13:54,430
Rym: usually the 18 plus area of the Otakon art show is always really meager and filled with really bad art.

1078
01:13:54,450 --> 01:14:00,201
Scott: Not it's really like a naked furry To yaoi guys an anime character naked.

1079
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:00,843
Scott: It's not.

1080
01:14:00,883 --> 01:14:05,098
Scott: it's nothing really horrendous like oh god discuss Always like poorly drawn and crappy.

1081
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:06,523
Scott: It's nothing that's really good.

1082
01:14:06,764 --> 01:14:08,230
Scott: It's nothing really bad or scary.

1083
01:14:08,351 --> 01:14:12,570
Scott: It's just like some nudes and you're like, whatever what the hell is this for this year?

1084
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:15,040
Scott: There was barely anything in there whatsoever.

1085
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:21,190
Scott: There was like one tiny nude and Two things that were awesome in it.

1086
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:22,034
Scott: Do I just say what they were?

1087
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:26,472
Rym: no because I have the recording is of us when we went in there and I'll just save That for a special.

1088
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:31,388
Rym: Okay, cool suffice to say that was one of the highlights of my con see.

1089
01:14:31,528 --> 01:14:34,597
Scott: in retrospect We should have bid it enough.

1090
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:39,814
Scott: So it was forced to go into the odd ha ha that would have been so classic But we were not.

1091
01:14:39,955 --> 01:14:43,550
Scott: we didn't think of that until it was too late on Sunday when the art show was over.

1092
01:14:44,033 --> 01:14:46,650
Rym: Now the last big thing we did at Otakon on Saturday.

1093
01:14:47,573 --> 01:14:53,826
Rym: Well, we can talk about the dealers room in a minute But okay, basically our friend katsu because we always do a million panels of cons.

1094
01:14:54,287 --> 01:14:57,636
Rym: and this year, you know I told all our friends Hey, do you want to do a panel?

1095
01:14:58,078 --> 01:15:02,940
Rym: and katsu one of the few people we know who stepped up and said, you know What I'm awesome at kendo.

1096
01:15:03,101 --> 01:15:04,408
Rym: I'm a certified kendo instructor.

1097
01:15:04,448 --> 01:15:04,830
Rym: I'm a yonder.

1098
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:06,135
Scott: I think we pushed him to do it.

1099
01:15:06,356 --> 01:15:21,283
Rym: We did is also but he decided to do a kendo panel and Basically he for an hour without a microphone in a standing room only busting at the seams room With just did a panel that we filmed.

1100
01:15:21,323 --> 01:15:21,866
Rym: James filmed.

1101
01:15:21,926 --> 01:15:24,975
Rym: It was Absolutely amazing.

1102
01:15:24,995 --> 01:15:28,250
Rym: I was on the panel, but all I did was MC it like straight up.

1103
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:30,523
Rym: I did what every panelist should have from Otakon.

1104
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:36,529
Rym: I introduced him I took questions in the audience and other than that I hid behind the speakers and didn't say a word.

1105
01:15:37,431 --> 01:15:39,562
Rym: Katsu had the audience on the edge of their seats.

1106
01:15:40,044 --> 01:15:41,170
Rym: It was an amazing panel.

1107
01:15:41,552 --> 01:15:44,370
Rym: He is going to be busting some shit up at katsu con.

1108
01:15:45,014 --> 01:15:51,130
Scott: Yeah, I heard the awesomeness of this panel But I did not go to this panel because I was happen in the artist alley.

1109
01:15:51,431 --> 01:15:53,581
Rym: Remember katsu was a kendo instructor.

1110
01:15:53,862 --> 01:16:03,050
Rym: He ran it like a professional College class on kendo and he basically just took questions in the audience and demonstrated and it was fantastic.

1111
01:16:03,791 --> 01:16:10,536
Rym: and when the panel ended no one wanted to leave and a crowd of people followed katsu out and Pestered him for another half hour.

1112
01:16:10,556 --> 01:16:14,170
Rym: Yep, and I felt bad for the panel that came in after because no one stayed.

1113
01:16:16,932 --> 01:16:17,996
Rym: But we've got a video.

1114
01:16:18,016 --> 01:16:28,750
Rym: we're probably gonna get it up on YouTube at some point because it's fantastic Yep, and the cool thing is Aaron writer the katsu gun guy came up to me after it and basically said wait a minute.

1115
01:16:29,195 --> 01:16:30,267
Rym: So it's not just you two.

1116
01:16:30,891 --> 01:16:34,584
Rym: Are you telling me that the whole front row crew can just do panels like that whenever they want?

1117
01:16:34,885 --> 01:16:41,910
Rym: pretty much and I was like You realize that the people in the front row crew combined could run all of the content at an entire anime con.

1118
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:46,350
Rym: Probably I think we could between all of the help from the podcasting friends.

1119
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:46,811
Scott: But that's about.

1120
01:16:46,872 --> 01:16:51,607
Rym: I think the extended front row crew alone has enough panel front row crew and associates.

1121
01:16:51,727 --> 01:16:52,710
Scott: Yes, definitely.

1122
01:16:52,951 --> 01:16:56,769
Rym: So, uh, once again expect some fucking busting out at Katsucon.

1123
01:16:57,573 --> 01:17:01,833
Rym: Alright, we want to try to make katsu the spokesperson of Katsucon Maybe?

1124
01:17:01,853 --> 01:17:03,962
Scott: alright, so dealer's room.

1125
01:17:04,323 --> 01:17:05,910
Rym: Alright, the dealer's room was gigantic.

1126
01:17:06,191 --> 01:17:08,822
Rym: It was great and had everything you want out of a dealer's room.

1127
01:17:09,344 --> 01:17:13,470
Scott: a lot less porn than usual Yep, there was a lot more swords than usual.

1128
01:17:13,611 --> 01:17:17,390
Scott: The layout was improved a lot less industry presence than in the past.

1129
01:17:17,831 --> 01:17:22,530
Rym: The industry good and bad that was there was back to its former glory with all the spectacle.

1130
01:17:23,092 --> 01:17:29,318
Scott: Well, mostly Bandai visual with their HD theater showing freedom, which yeah was nice But I have no desire for that.

1131
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,750
Scott: and the full spectacle had not returned.

1132
01:17:31,991 --> 01:17:43,530
Scott: the full spectacle was the year that a TV had the Honda Civic full of merchandise and Hot booth babes making you take a survey about the anime network for a chance to win said car.

1133
01:17:43,912 --> 01:17:45,078
Scott: That was the spectacle.

1134
01:17:45,099 --> 01:17:47,110
Rym: Well, I think that's slowly returning.

1135
01:17:47,351 --> 01:17:47,834
Rym: I'm hoping.

1136
01:17:48,457 --> 01:17:49,986
Scott: I think it's actually declining.

1137
01:17:50,087 --> 01:18:09,395
Scott: as I see most of the people had the big booths in the spectacle in the past were the manga publishers like viz and Tokyo pop and I've noticed that recently they have been going to the comic cons for their business and they're sort of disrespecting the fan-run anime conventions, but yeah anyway Dealers room Pretty awesomely run.

1138
01:18:09,415 --> 01:18:11,946
Rym: There were super deals on DVDs.

1139
01:18:12,026 --> 01:18:12,870
Rym: I bought all of utenna.

1140
01:18:12,971 --> 01:18:14,090
Rym: I bought all of haibana.

1141
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:16,179
Scott: There's one place that had these super deals.

1142
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:16,561
Scott: on TV.

1143
01:18:16,581 --> 01:18:21,119
Rym: you could get all of slayers for like 75 bucks And when I say all of slayers, I mean all three seasons.

1144
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:25,093
Scott: Yeah, if you wanted bad manga or old manga No one cared about.

1145
01:18:25,214 --> 01:18:29,630
Scott: it was easy to get in quantity for very cheap like five bucks or less per manga.

1146
01:18:30,213 --> 01:18:33,590
Scott: But the selection on that manga was pretty weak, you know.

1147
01:18:33,690 --> 01:18:35,880
Scott: So you had to get something you probably didn't like.

1148
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:38,290
Rym: Connecticut had a much better manga deal selection.

1149
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:41,842
Scott: Well, that was mostly because that one dealer that I forget kamikopia.

1150
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:44,170
Scott: Yeah, they have excellent manga awesome deals.

1151
01:18:44,371 --> 01:18:48,224
Scott: But yeah, the thing is in terms of what was there.

1152
01:18:48,364 --> 01:18:49,950
Scott: there wasn't that much I wanted to buy.

1153
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:51,538
Scott: I bought a Galaxy Express post.

1154
01:18:51,578 --> 01:18:53,770
Rym: Well, I'm really beyond buying all the little trinkets.

1155
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:56,090
Rym: I mean, I've got boxes full of various.

1156
01:18:56,331 --> 01:19:00,848
Scott: I wanted to buy this one Pokemon PVC of Spiritomb and they didn't have it.

1157
01:19:00,888 --> 01:19:01,350
Scott: at WYSIWYG.

1158
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:02,829
Scott: They had everything else in the set.

1159
01:19:03,232 --> 01:19:11,092
Scott: There was one guy who had sealed boxes of the set But I would have had to pay too much to get the set even though I thought about buying it and giving it to all My friends.

1160
01:19:11,453 --> 01:19:14,201
Scott: WYSIWYG was selling it for $2 each figure.

1161
01:19:14,502 --> 01:19:18,274
Scott: that would have come out to like $32 for the box Which I was willing to pay.

1162
01:19:18,294 --> 01:19:21,566
Scott: this other guy was selling it for $3.

1163
01:19:21,566 --> 01:19:27,930
Scott: So it would have been like Some a lot more money for the box and I wasn't willing to pay that even if it was for all my friends.

1164
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:33,548
Scott: So and especially since I wanted one figure from the set the Spiritomb.

1165
01:19:33,909 --> 01:19:35,415
Rym: Yeah The thing is more and more.

1166
01:19:35,436 --> 01:19:36,380
Rym: I think Scott and I both.

1167
01:19:37,063 --> 01:19:38,690
Rym: I don't want to sound like oh, we're too.

1168
01:19:39,091 --> 01:19:44,186
Rym: But I feel like I want to buy the quote-unquote classy things in the dealers room.

1169
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:51,170
Rym: exactly and by classy I mean the thing I want the most are like old Leiji Matsumoto posters from back in the day.

1170
01:19:51,252 --> 01:19:51,829
Scott: That's what I got.

1171
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:53,235
Scott: I got a Leiji Matsumoto poster.

1172
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:58,113
Rym: The thing is while they might have been free or cheap when they were you know out there And you can just get them.

1173
01:19:58,536 --> 01:19:59,681
Rym: They're kind of hard to find now.

1174
01:19:59,741 --> 01:20:00,746
Rym: So they're always like 20 to 40 dollars.

1175
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:05,504
Scott: Yeah, I spent $19 on mine and it wasn't the best one they had either.

1176
01:20:05,524 --> 01:20:07,090
Scott: the other ones were a lot more money.

1177
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:10,310
Rym: I'm also kind of feeling more and more like I don't want to collect cells.

1178
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:14,989
Rym: I hate collecting I hate that old business, but I feel like I should own at least one cell.

1179
01:20:15,171 --> 01:20:17,063
Scott: Yeah owning a cell is pretty cool

1180
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:30,077
Rym: and I Feel more and more like it might be worth it someday to spend the amount of money it would take to have like the one Cell with the background from the one anime that I love the most and just have it in a frame with a little like Plaque under describing what it is.

1181
01:20:30,318 --> 01:20:34,826
Rym: That's the kind of thing you put in the library when you have your manor house someday Yeah, you go for it.

1182
01:20:34,866 --> 01:20:35,150
Scott: Why not?

1183
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:39,570
Rym: You know, I'll have that and I'll have my Nazi coin which I'm still proud of because I think that thing's really neat.

1184
01:20:39,891 --> 01:20:54,490
Scott: Yeah, and the few other small trinkets of history that I have Yeah, but if you're looking for a dealers room and not necessarily looking for deals, you know You're just looking to for availability of merchandise and you are not jaded and you actually want anime merchandise.

1185
01:20:54,953 --> 01:20:56,483
Scott: Otakon dealer's room super awesome.

1186
01:20:56,684 --> 01:21:01,349
Rym: I mean still Watching someone who has never been to an anime con before or never actually

1187
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:01,550
Scott: never

1188
01:21:02,914 --> 01:21:14,910
Rym: Walking into that dealer's room for the first time and realizing that it's going to take them a couple hours just to walk the length of it That the look on their face is priceless And I remember how I felt when I first walked into it.

1189
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:17,402
Scott: Oh, man, I spent a lot of time.

1190
01:21:17,442 --> 01:21:18,930
Scott: I first know to kind of the dealer's room.

1191
01:21:19,352 --> 01:21:22,830
Rym: I guess what I should say here is that Scott and I go to a lot of cons and we're kind of jaded.

1192
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:25,110
Rym: We don't care about most of what's ad cons anymore.

1193
01:21:25,573 --> 01:21:30,744
Scott: So we're gonna give a bad review to pretty much any dealer's room Even if it's the best dealer's room ever more than that.

1194
01:21:30,824 --> 01:21:31,610
Scott: We don't care about it.

1195
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:38,370
Rym: So as much as other people we tend to focus on the things we do and the things that go wrong Because that's all that stands out anymore.

1196
01:21:38,671 --> 01:21:44,086
Rym: You can assume that anything we don't talk about was probably 99% of Otakon was awesome.

1197
01:21:44,327 --> 01:21:45,390
Scott: I'm gonna say that right now.

1198
01:21:45,511 --> 01:21:46,850
Rym: Yeah, in fact, we've gone kind of long.

1199
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:50,510
Rym: So I think I'll get to the con feedback session and then we'll have our final thoughts.

1200
01:21:50,771 --> 01:21:53,785
Scott: Is there any other things we just have to cover at the last second here?

1201
01:21:53,926 --> 01:21:54,790
Rym: I didn't go to the dance.

1202
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:56,355
Scott: Oh the concert.

1203
01:21:56,998 --> 01:21:58,583
Rym: Oh right the Eminence concert.

1204
01:21:58,623 --> 01:22:00,209
Rym: We missed the triple-a concert.

1205
01:22:00,269 --> 01:22:02,179
Scott: Yes So we went to the Eminence concert.

1206
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:12,290
Scott: Eminence just to sum it up there They're actually a full orchestra from Australia But they sent over a string quartet and a pianist to perform.

1207
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:18,641
Scott: What they do is they perform video game and animation music in you know classical form and it's very awesome

1208
01:22:19,003 --> 01:22:27,106
Rym: and along with them because they Helped do a lot of the music for the Romeo and Juliet anime They had the composer for that music there with them and he's good friends with famous

1209
01:22:27,227 --> 01:22:28,010
Scott: anime composer.

1210
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:30,078
Scott: It's like no boo then this guy.

1211
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:31,804
Scott: the guy is no boo.

1212
01:22:31,845 --> 01:22:32,969
Scott: Yokokano, whatever.

1213
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:37,292
Scott: Yeah He's like the top of the second line of awesome Composers.

1214
01:22:37,392 --> 01:22:38,418
Rym: the guy is a great composer.

1215
01:22:38,538 --> 01:22:39,001
Rym: He's awesome.

1216
01:22:39,141 --> 01:22:47,566
Rym: I feel bad that I don't remember his name Yeah, but the guy's awesome and he's really cool like he was up there talking and with them and I have respect for the guy.

1217
01:22:47,587 --> 01:22:50,989
Rym: and Actually the MC that came with Eminence was really funny and cool, too.

1218
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:59,130
Scott: He was alright, even though he was a little nervous and he didn't know exactly what to say a lot He wasn't as cool as the guy who actually was like the first violin.

1219
01:22:59,259 --> 01:23:04,207
Scott: Yes The first violin guy should have been the MC and the MC guy should have just not been there cuz that got.

1220
01:23:04,529 --> 01:23:06,054
Rym: the guy was Hilarious and great.

1221
01:23:06,255 --> 01:23:10,549
Scott: Yes, the only problem I had with the Eminence concert because piano squall.

1222
01:23:10,609 --> 01:23:13,830
Scott: Yeah The performance they gave was great.

1223
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:19,490
Scott: I was a little bit jaded because I felt that I don't know after seeing the the video game pianist.

1224
01:23:19,751 --> 01:23:26,010
Scott: I'm sort of jaded on video game and anime music performances, but suffice regardless of video game anime part of it.

1225
01:23:26,471 --> 01:23:28,938
Rym: They were a fucking fantastic quintet.

1226
01:23:28,979 --> 01:23:29,861
Scott: They were awesome.

1227
01:23:30,042 --> 01:23:31,165
Scott: The concert was awesome.

1228
01:23:31,366 --> 01:23:32,850
Scott: I wouldn't have missed it for anything.

1229
01:23:32,971 --> 01:23:42,975
Scott: I want to see it again and again again but I guess part of the reason they were there is because piano squall knew them and had contact with them and piano squall had Contact with Otakon.

1230
01:23:43,015 --> 01:23:43,898
Rym: That's cool at all.

1231
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:45,244
Scott: He was the hookup guy like.

1232
01:23:45,264 --> 01:23:45,947
Rym: that's cool at all.

1233
01:23:45,987 --> 01:23:46,750
Rym: I'm glad he did it.

1234
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:52,030
Rym: I respect him for that, but he was kind of a self-serving prick up on stage.

1235
01:23:52,814 --> 01:23:55,810
Scott: I knew piano squall from when he was at Otakon in the past.

1236
01:23:56,071 --> 01:24:00,489
Scott: I saw him perform at I think a cosplay intermission when I was in the simulcast room.

1237
01:24:00,509 --> 01:24:03,730
Scott: and The guy has piano skills.

1238
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:11,298
Scott: I will not deny his piano skills might not be at the same level as Martin Long who I just mentioned the video game pianist But they are awesome piano skills.

1239
01:24:11,338 --> 01:24:13,046
Scott: He has better piano skills than most people.

1240
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:16,321
Scott: also He has a good squall cosplay.

1241
01:24:16,361 --> 01:24:17,165
Scott: He looks like squall.

1242
01:24:17,446 --> 01:24:24,571
Scott: I cannot deny that He also has a pretty good shtick going and he has a lot of respect from a lot of fans and I can't deny that To him.

1243
01:24:24,813 --> 01:24:30,584
Rym: but in this particular instance when he was on stage He kind of came off as an asshole.

1244
01:24:30,946 --> 01:24:35,364
Scott: I also Didn't like him and I I don't like him as a person.

1245
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:36,930
Scott: I think he's very unprofessional.

1246
01:24:37,391 --> 01:24:41,585
Scott: He's sort of fanboyish and he's sort of annoying and I don't.

1247
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:48,109
Scott: and while I don't know him personally And I've only interacted with him as an audience member to when he has been on stage and that is it.

1248
01:24:48,692 --> 01:24:50,378
Scott: He doesn't seem like the kind of person.

1249
01:24:50,478 --> 01:24:51,884
Scott: I really want to talk to ever.

1250
01:24:52,325 --> 01:24:53,389
Rym: he talked way too much.

1251
01:24:53,871 --> 01:24:58,165
Scott: He said annoying things that made me want to groan that were unprofessional.

1252
01:24:58,185 --> 01:25:03,501
Rym: and the worst thing is at one point up I'm not arguing freedom of speech or anything because I went.

1253
01:25:03,541 --> 01:25:08,102
Rym: if I ever shied away from saying something offensive never The gecky got fat.

1254
01:25:08,142 --> 01:25:08,424
Scott: Oh, yes.

1255
01:25:08,444 --> 01:25:14,557
Rym: Yes But uh, he made a joke Somewhat disparaging of Baltimore.

1256
01:25:14,577 --> 01:25:20,469
Scott: and while I agree that Baltimore deserves to be disparaged It was only you do that.

1257
01:25:20,651 --> 01:25:21,980
Rym: Well, yeah, I mean you can do.

1258
01:25:22,021 --> 01:25:23,310
Scott: that isn't very poor taste.

1259
01:25:23,431 --> 01:25:29,261
Rym: You could do it if you did it well in the right circumstances but it was neither the time nor the place and it just.

1260
01:25:29,341 --> 01:25:34,769
Rym: it came off as really crass and tacky and I lost most of my respect for piano squall then.

1261
01:25:34,850 --> 01:25:41,393
Scott: Yeah I mean even if I if I'm a musical act and I go somewhere to perform even if it's someplace I hate like where's Someplace I hate.

1262
01:25:41,474 --> 01:25:51,570
Scott: well, it depends because some musical acts can get away with coming up on stage If you're fuck you Baltimore like Lewis black he can get up there and he'd be like, how do you people stand this shitty weather?

1263
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:52,011
Rym: Oh, what?

1264
01:25:52,031 --> 01:25:52,252
Rym: He came to.

1265
01:25:52,352 --> 01:25:53,697
Rym: RIT is like fucking cold.

1266
01:25:53,999 --> 01:25:54,601
Scott: What the fuck.

1267
01:25:54,822 --> 01:25:56,308
Rym: you guys have tunnels cuz it's fucking cold.

1268
01:25:56,368 --> 01:25:56,710
Scott: Fuck you.

1269
01:25:57,030 --> 01:26:00,439
Scott: Yeah, exactly, but I'm only here because you made me he's a comedian.

1270
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:06,921
Scott: if you're a piano like soloist and you're going to play piano You don't get up and say man.

1271
01:26:06,941 --> 01:26:08,489
Scott: Your city has a high crime rate.

1272
01:26:08,994 --> 01:26:10,109
Scott: Yes, please sucks.

1273
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:18,430
Rym: But even then even that the way that piano squall did it and the just the circumstance and everything It was really lame in the first place.

1274
01:26:18,972 --> 01:26:27,608
Rym: And I think what spoke well of eminence is that they didn't react and the MC guy just kind of smiled and nodded and gave This look of what's wrong with you?

1275
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:32,406
Scott: Yeah, they should have had if they needed to include piano squall in the thing at all.

1276
01:26:32,446 --> 01:26:33,490
Rym: Don't give him a microphone.

1277
01:26:33,851 --> 01:26:36,801
Scott: Just guy I I don't want to see this guy.

1278
01:26:37,001 --> 01:26:40,518
Scott: if I know the piano squall was involved with the thing That might have.

1279
01:26:40,599 --> 01:26:45,346
Scott: if I had known that beforehand I might have actually shied away from it which would have been bad on the great cause.

1280
01:26:45,406 --> 01:26:46,210
Rym: eminence is awesome.

1281
01:26:46,431 --> 01:26:50,790
Rym: I know also the guy on the far right who didn't talk much but at the Australian guy.

1282
01:26:50,931 --> 01:26:51,393
Rym: Well, they're all us.

1283
01:26:51,454 --> 01:26:53,605
Rym: Well, they're not all Australian, but it's an Australian group.

1284
01:26:53,766 --> 01:26:57,262
Rym: Yep Apparently Americans say they're ours like pirates.

1285
01:26:57,603 --> 01:26:57,804
Scott: Yep.

1286
01:26:57,964 --> 01:26:58,908
Scott: That guy was a funny guy.

1287
01:26:58,928 --> 01:26:59,270
Scott: I liked him.

1288
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:06,390
Scott: Basically they should have just let the musicians run the show themselves because they were ten times as awesome as the MC or piano squall.

1289
01:27:06,671 --> 01:27:07,636
Rym: But the MC was pretty good.

1290
01:27:07,677 --> 01:27:07,938
Rym: It was just.

1291
01:27:07,998 --> 01:27:08,622
Scott: it was okay.

1292
01:27:08,702 --> 01:27:13,621
Scott: piano squall piano squall It's really the only piano squall made him look good by relativism.

1293
01:27:13,802 --> 01:27:14,383
Rym: I think he did.

1294
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:16,430
Scott: All right, that's enough of that concert.

1295
01:27:16,591 --> 01:27:19,741
Rym: All right, so we have a tradition every year of going.

1296
01:27:19,821 --> 01:27:20,122
Rym: Oh, yeah.

1297
01:27:20,142 --> 01:27:21,928
Rym: Well, we'll link to them in the forum.

1298
01:27:22,109 --> 01:27:22,470
Rym: Good idea.

1299
01:27:22,552 --> 01:27:23,169
Rym: Well, you know what?

1300
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:26,590
Rym: We're gonna link to a bunch of stuff in the forum cuz I gotta give shout outs to people and all that.

1301
01:27:27,073 --> 01:27:29,349
Rym: The forum thread will probably end up being long for this.

1302
01:27:29,798 --> 01:27:35,030
Rym: All right Suffice to say we have a tradition every year of going to the closing ceremonies and the con feedback session.

1303
01:27:35,534 --> 01:27:44,999
Scott: We missed the closing ceremony which is sad because if you miss the closing Sarah the closing ceremonies at Otakon are special because There are many anime music video showings at Otakon.

1304
01:27:45,220 --> 01:28:00,010
Scott: The problem with these showings is they're often crowded and annoying and loud and they're not pleasant at least for me and mostly since I don't care a lot about music videos and Most of the music videos are not so good and I only want to see the good one.

1305
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:02,070
Rym: See I care a lot about anime music videos.

1306
01:28:02,191 --> 01:28:04,369
Rym: I really like them like they're a big part of cons for me.

1307
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:07,782
Scott: But I have an idea that I came up with today that I'll let you know about.

1308
01:28:07,963 --> 01:28:11,335
Scott: anime probably already figured out my idea Anime con.

1309
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:12,841
Rym: anime music video contest.

1310
01:28:12,961 --> 01:28:18,225
Rym: for a lot of reasons that we've talked about we've had in fact We had an anime music video expert on the show not too long ago.

1311
01:28:18,386 --> 01:28:18,829
Scott: Oh we did.

1312
01:28:18,889 --> 01:28:21,801
Scott: Yeah I actually I just thought about that earlier today.

1313
01:28:21,821 --> 01:28:22,765
Scott: Yeah, it was weird.

1314
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:24,452
Rym: I thought about it at Otakon Huh?

1315
01:28:24,734 --> 01:28:25,497
Scott: Okay, then because

1316
01:28:25,517 --> 01:28:26,301
Rym: that was a good show

1317
01:28:26,381 --> 01:28:34,448
Scott: at Otakon at the closing ceremonies They show the winners of the AMV contest and only the winners and the honorable mentions and the judges choices and

1318
01:28:34,548 --> 01:28:43,522
Rym: all I remember is That every year it's just like six amazing music videos and to this day I still the one video that I saw the 25 25 video.

1319
01:28:43,842 --> 01:28:46,510
Rym: That's like the best anime music video ever other than that utenna one.

1320
01:28:46,591 --> 01:28:48,470
Scott: It's a really damn good anime music video.

1321
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:56,310
Rym: It's one of those ones where it's good and it's serious Which is hard to do because if you try to do usually the best ones are comedic or like happening.

1322
01:28:56,531 --> 01:29:00,030
Rym: Yeah, if you try to be serious, you usually end up being lame or sappy.

1323
01:29:00,191 --> 01:29:10,590
Scott: That's one of those videos that gives you that feeling, you know that the same feeling that the awesome animes give Yes, which is what you're trying to do is give the same feeling awesome animes give with a song and some anime.

1324
01:29:10,913 --> 01:29:11,620
Rym: But we missed it.

1325
01:29:11,741 --> 01:29:12,104
Rym: It sucked.

1326
01:29:12,266 --> 01:29:12,629
Rym: I'm sad.

1327
01:29:13,072 --> 01:29:17,410
Rym: However, we went to the con feedback session and I'm not gonna go into a lot of detail.

1328
01:29:17,471 --> 01:29:28,910
Scott: One thing I could say about the con feedback session this year That was better than years past is they basically had all of the top staff there the whole row of them Which in years past they've only had like, you know a few staff guys.

1329
01:29:29,011 --> 01:29:38,730
Scott: They're taking notes And I think that was a good improvement because they were able to properly respond To more of the questions rather than just saying yeah, we'll pass that along all of the time.

1330
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:41,222
Scott: They only had to say we'll pass that on a few times.

1331
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:52,056
Rym: now this Otakon It broke the mold of con feedback sessions because the rule is 99% of any con feedback session is cosplayers complaining about cosplays masquerades This year.

1332
01:29:52,076 --> 01:29:53,482
Rym: No one complained about that.

1333
01:29:53,563 --> 01:29:55,210
Scott: At least I didn't hear any complaints about it.

1334
01:29:55,210 --> 01:30:00,690
Rym: There was one semi legitimate complaint about making the rules clear about what isn't is not allowed in the BCC.

1335
01:30:00,971 --> 01:30:16,763
Rym: but other than that almost all of the complaints were either Stupid fanboys complaining about bullshit that Otakon has no power over or Otakon shouldn't change now that I won't get into that or People complaining about autograph sessions and panels.

1336
01:30:17,405 --> 01:30:30,567
Rym: now with the autograph sessions The complaints were usually along the lines of I wanted the autograph and I didn't get it to which I say there are 22 to 25 thousand people there and there are like a thousand autographs going to be signed.

1337
01:30:31,048 --> 01:30:32,853
Rym: if you get one You're lucky if you don't.

1338
01:30:32,893 --> 01:30:33,755
Rym: better luck next year.

1339
01:30:34,356 --> 01:30:43,947
Rym: and the fat fanboy who tried to complain that because autograph sessions were set Simultaneous he was not able to get both autographs at the same time.

1340
01:30:44,268 --> 01:30:45,713
Rym: Fuck you Exactly.

1341
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:48,885
Scott: That's I wanted to yell out like fuck you sit down and shut up.

1342
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:54,886
Scott: And first the thing is Regardless of you know, yes, there's a limited supply and a demand is greater than supply.

1343
01:30:54,947 --> 01:30:57,054
Scott: if you get one, you're lucky There's also the.

1344
01:30:57,516 --> 01:30:58,841
Scott: it's a fucking autograph.

1345
01:30:58,861 --> 01:31:01,230
Scott: Someone just drags a pen across the paper.

1346
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:08,370
Scott: Why I mean I want to wait in line to maybe talk to someone, you know Maybe like spend 10 seconds going hi, how you doing?

1347
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:13,840
Scott: Maybe say thank you for the awesome art you make it I enjoy it a lot or something like that.

1348
01:31:14,162 --> 01:31:15,970
Scott: or maybe get something from them, you know.

1349
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:22,390
Scott: But an autograph really doesn't mean anything to me and I don't really understand why it means a lot to other people.

1350
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:25,330
Rym: Well, it could mean a lot to me if it was like someone I really respected.

1351
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:34,190
Scott: but even then any the odd the physical artifact of the Autograph itself would be just a reminder of the time when I met the person which is what really has the meaning.

1352
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:39,570
Scott: For a lot of these people it seems like the physical artifact of the autograph is the meaningful thing.

1353
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:42,379
Rym: I have one case where the physical artifact is the meaningful thing.

1354
01:31:42,781 --> 01:31:43,262
Scott: What is that?

1355
01:31:43,443 --> 01:31:54,810
Rym: And while the Magic Johnson story is awesome Okay, if I ever get that signed that by Captain Lou and then the guy who played Luigi, but I know important thing I have the anime equivalent of a Catholic relic.

1356
01:31:55,011 --> 01:32:01,728
Scott: But the important thing there isn't the physical artifact of the autograph itself But the meta surrounding the combination of what the autograph.

1357
01:32:01,748 --> 01:32:04,830
Rym: yeah I don't want to yell at people who get autographs now.

1358
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:08,562
Rym: I want to yell at people who like mindlessly collect every autograph they can get.

1359
01:32:08,843 --> 01:32:09,144
Rym: I view

1360
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:10,107
Scott: anyone who collects like

1361
01:32:10,147 --> 01:32:12,570
Rym: our friend Lisa really Wanted to get the eska flown a guy's autograph

1362
01:32:12,710 --> 01:32:19,656
Scott: But she got pictures sketches from the eska flown a guy and she talked to the eska flown a guy Which is a much more meaningful and that's

1363
01:32:19,977 --> 01:32:24,530
Rym: I doubt this fanboy really really cared about all of the people who were giving autographs.

1364
01:32:24,731 --> 01:32:26,359
Scott: oh, he I imagine he did not.

1365
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:36,867
Rym: he just wanted to fill out his autograph book and Frankly I wish Otakon see in the years past Otakon concert count is really good about this Was more forceful in shooting down stupid questions.

1366
01:32:37,168 --> 01:32:37,470
Rym: this year.

1367
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:39,802
Rym: They were really kind of conciliatory and they very much.

1368
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:44,684
Rym: if someone has a stupid question They basically said well forward that to the interested parties.

1369
01:32:45,045 --> 01:32:45,547
Scott: Here's an inch.

1370
01:32:45,628 --> 01:32:47,421
Scott: Here's an idea I just came up with you ready.

1371
01:32:47,441 --> 01:32:48,450
Scott: Tell me if you like this idea.

1372
01:32:48,631 --> 01:32:49,133
Rym: I'm listening.

1373
01:32:49,635 --> 01:32:53,573
Scott: when you get an autograph the autograph line system at Otakon It's just fine.

1374
01:32:53,633 --> 01:32:54,558
Scott: as far as I'm concerned.

1375
01:32:54,678 --> 01:33:01,650
Scott: the way they do it is you get a ticket and if you get a ticket you're Guaranteed an autograph and if you don't have a ticket you can wait in line, but you're not guaranteed an autograph.

1376
01:33:01,853 --> 01:33:02,909
Scott: That's that's a good system.

1377
01:33:03,553 --> 01:33:05,522
Scott: I think they should add one more thing to that system.

1378
01:33:06,085 --> 01:33:11,283
Scott: if you get an autograph They like punch a giant crazy hole in your badge and you're not allowed anymore.

1379
01:33:11,363 --> 01:33:13,590
Scott: you get one for the con period game over.

1380
01:33:13,812 --> 01:33:14,356
Rym: That's hot.

1381
01:33:14,638 --> 01:33:15,323
Scott: That's a good idea.

1382
01:33:15,343 --> 01:33:16,250
Scott: That would be fantastic.

1383
01:33:16,371 --> 01:33:19,910
Scott: You can only get one autograph at the con no matter what no matter who you are.

1384
01:33:20,131 --> 01:33:22,101
Scott: So if you're gonna get one you pick one.

1385
01:33:22,142 --> 01:33:28,150
Scott: if you wait in line and you don't get one We don't stamp your badge to permanently prevent you from getting any more autographs this year.

1386
01:33:28,431 --> 01:33:31,990
Scott: So you can still wait in another line and try again, but you get one.

1387
01:33:32,231 --> 01:33:33,097
Scott: That's it fanboy.

1388
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:43,276
Rym: now as for the other complaints Which were almost all about panels half of them were the panels were totally fuck sword and no shows and scheduling problems And that was true.

1389
01:33:43,638 --> 01:33:45,710
Rym: The panels were completely fucked at Otakon.

1390
01:33:45,851 --> 01:33:49,350
Scott: I think the problem was is that before the con I got the schedule online.

1391
01:33:49,792 --> 01:33:54,570
Scott: The schedule online was more up-to-date than the printed pocket guide at the con.

1392
01:33:55,073 --> 01:33:58,170
Scott: Secondly there are if there was a problem with the pocket guide.

1393
01:33:58,391 --> 01:34:01,910
Scott: There was in the pocket guide a description for a panel about super flat.

1394
01:34:02,472 --> 01:34:07,948
Scott: No panel about super flat was scheduled on any schedule I've ever seen but there was a description for the panel in there.

1395
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:12,660
Scott: So Problems with the checking of the printing beforehand already.

1396
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:16,450
Rym: I'm very much of the mind that it would be worth the expense for Otakon.

1397
01:34:16,510 --> 01:34:17,417
Rym: I mean the pocket guides.

1398
01:34:17,437 --> 01:34:18,867
Rym: well and good and they could keep it in it.

1399
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:21,118
Scott: Can they need some sort of pocket guide?

1400
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:23,710
Scott: because carrying the program around like a kinetic con is no good.

1401
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:27,850
Rym: But they should add to that and I mean I'd be willing to pay more even to go to Otakon.

1402
01:34:28,211 --> 01:34:34,913
Rym: Just a single piece of paper that has the most up-to-date schedule like the final day I think.

1403
01:34:34,933 --> 01:34:37,570
Rym: print it and still get it to the con and put it in the bag.

1404
01:34:37,691 --> 01:34:39,078
Rym: I actually not even in the bags.

1405
01:34:39,098 --> 01:34:41,189
Rym: Maybe they just pass it out when you get your badge.

1406
01:34:41,531 --> 01:34:54,921
Scott: I would really like it if they just had the schedule on some paper and not in the pocket guide and then maybe the pocket guy just had the descriptions of the events or Maybe the pocket guide had things just I don't know.

1407
01:34:55,161 --> 01:34:58,250
Rym: the pocket guide should just have maps and descriptions of things.

1408
01:34:58,771 --> 01:35:03,186
Rym: The sheet of paper the single sheet of paper should be the most up-to-date schedule.

1409
01:35:03,206 --> 01:35:10,020
Scott: They could have possibly printed Yeah I don't know it just or Print the pocket guide later so that the schedule is more up-to-date.

1410
01:35:10,321 --> 01:35:15,325
Scott: if the pocket guide does not have a useful and accurate schedule It's we might as well have nothing.

1411
01:35:15,607 --> 01:35:21,636
Scott: So Yeah, we need a pocket guide because we can't be carrying the program around the big giant thing All right now.

1412
01:35:21,697 --> 01:35:24,950
Rym: we've gone on long So I'm not going to get into what went wrong with panels.

1413
01:35:25,332 --> 01:35:27,463
Rym: Suffice to say we'll probably do a separate show about that.

1414
01:35:27,664 --> 01:35:31,349
Scott: as to I think the show Went wrong with panels at Otakon this year.

1415
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:33,316
Scott: It was they had.

1416
01:35:33,336 --> 01:35:38,817
Scott: they could have prevented it if they had acted beforehand in a smart way But they didn't and it failed.

1417
01:35:39,098 --> 01:35:41,490
Scott: they did their best to recover from the disaster.

1418
01:35:41,671 --> 01:35:45,170
Rym: I got to say Meredith did a fantastic job of covering up and saving everything.

1419
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:47,610
Scott: They did the best they could to recover from the disaster.

1420
01:35:48,072 --> 01:35:57,518
Scott: but in my opinion the disaster did not have to occur if they had acted smartly beforehand and There were some problems afterwards.

1421
01:35:57,618 --> 01:36:01,610
Scott: but some of those problems were due to people's stupidity.

1422
01:36:01,972 --> 01:36:03,863
Rym: I think we'll do a separate show.

1423
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:10,067
Rym: That is going to be very simply Exactly how myself and Scott would run panels at Otakon if we were at any convention.

1424
01:36:10,108 --> 01:36:10,690
Scott: at any convention.

1425
01:36:10,811 --> 01:36:11,638
Rym: Yeah, but I think we'll go.

1426
01:36:11,658 --> 01:36:13,150
Rym: we'll go through the anime convention.

1427
01:36:13,912 --> 01:36:17,470
Rym: I think if we specifically do Otakon like I would do it exactly this way.

1428
01:36:18,093 --> 01:36:19,502
Scott: Oh, yeah, it doesn't have to be Otakon though.

1429
01:36:19,542 --> 01:36:22,610
Rym: But anyway that we've gone on We don't want to turn into anime world order here.

1430
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:26,041
Scott: So is there anything else to say about Otakon this year besides how awesome it was?

1431
01:36:26,062 --> 01:36:28,570
Rym: the rest of the complaints about panels.

1432
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:41,650
Rym: we're basically people complaining about the content of fan panels or the content of industry panels or The fact that a panelist like wasn't prepared or didn't show up or didn't use the microphone, right?

1433
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:44,236
Rym: Yeah And to which I want to say Otakon needs to.

1434
01:36:44,758 --> 01:36:50,795
Rym: they should have come out straight away and just said fan panels are run by fans Not by us.

1435
01:36:50,936 --> 01:36:53,163
Scott: We have no con like the anime music videos.

1436
01:36:53,204 --> 01:36:55,090
Scott: if they suck that's not Otakon's fault.

1437
01:36:55,331 --> 01:36:58,120
Scott: They have no control if no one submits good music videos.

1438
01:36:58,381 --> 01:37:01,149
Scott: They can't make good music videos and put them in.

1439
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:10,437
Rym: yeah, you know don't go to the con feedback and say the Hellsing panel or the the Inuyasha fan panel was crappy and Poorly run because they don't know.

1440
01:37:10,498 --> 01:37:12,144
Scott: they don't know what you what actually.

1441
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:22,670
Scott: you should say that but not You shouldn't blame the con for the fact that the panel was poor but you should tell them hey I just want to let you know this panel was bad.

1442
01:37:22,991 --> 01:37:28,870
Scott: I don't suggest you allow those panelists back in the future and the con there is more demand to run panels.

1443
01:37:29,091 --> 01:37:40,715
Scott: Then there are panels to be run and the con really should be a lot Stricter and a lot more tough on who gets to run panels and who doesn't and which panels get to be run Because they can.

1444
01:37:40,815 --> 01:37:45,810
Scott: if they are harder on the panelists they can improve panel quality across the board.

1445
01:37:46,132 --> 01:37:48,224
Scott: But it's not the cons fault if a panel sucks.

1446
01:37:48,304 --> 01:37:49,330
Scott: It's the panel people's fault.

1447
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:49,631
Rym: I mean.

1448
01:37:49,651 --> 01:37:58,828
Rym: basically we suggested to ConnectiCon things they could do to make their panels go better and they did everything we said And I think that ConnectiCon is gonna have better and better panels every year.

1449
01:37:58,869 --> 01:38:01,523
Rym: now I really think Otakon should do the same thing.

1450
01:38:01,564 --> 01:38:02,348
Rym: It wouldn't be that hard.

1451
01:38:02,469 --> 01:38:06,807
Rym: Nope All right, anything else and trying to other than that other than the panels.

1452
01:38:06,887 --> 01:38:07,590
Rym: catastrophe.

1453
01:38:08,230 --> 01:38:18,965
Rym: Otakon was run pretty much flawlessly and I didn't run into a single freaking problem at the con other than the Ten minutes we spent in that problem line at reg and the panel problems.

1454
01:38:19,025 --> 01:38:20,490
Scott: Everything else at the con was flawless.

1455
01:38:21,531 --> 01:38:25,346
Scott: I can't really think of ways to make it better other than things I could have done as opposed to.

1456
01:38:25,506 --> 01:38:31,305
Scott: there's nothing the con could Have done really to make it better for me other than what we already said.

1457
01:38:31,887 --> 01:38:32,750
Scott: I can't think of anything.

1458
01:38:33,272 --> 01:38:35,402
Scott: It was Otakon awesome every time.

1459
01:38:35,442 --> 01:38:36,788
