1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,928
Rym: It's Monday, May 7th.

2
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:13,051
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,632 --> 00:00:14,234
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:16,300
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,499
Rym: Tonight we talk a bit about computer cases.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,158
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:31,460
Scott: Most of the listeners may know that I take the train to work.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,130
Scott: I take the train from upstate New York down into Manhattan.

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:41,250
Rym: I like how now that we live down here, what we call upstate New York has gotten progressively further south.

10
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:45,405
Scott: Well, it's all, anything that's not New York City is upstate New York.

11
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:46,950
Scott: That's just what it's called.

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,605
Scott: Regardless, there are many interesting things on the train.

13
00:00:50,705 --> 00:01:00,635
Scott: For example, this morning I had to sit in the car which contained the bathroom and whenever anyone opens the bathroom door on the train it is quite odiferous.

14
00:01:00,836 --> 00:01:06,170
Rym: It seems like on every big train, all the commuter trains, there's always one car that smells bad.

15
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:08,698
Rym: There's always one car where the AC isn't working.

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,430
Rym: There's always the one car with the fat lady yelling into a cell phone.

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,703
Scott: On the way home today, there weren't too many seats.

18
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:17,130
Scott: Except for this one car.

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:26,203
Scott: there are plenty of seats and I saw the car as I was making my way towards it from the previous car and I said that train probably doesn't have air conditioning.

20
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:29,234
Scott: and I went into the car and sure enough it was the hot car.

21
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:33,547
Scott: And I chose to sit in the hot car which was good and bad.

22
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:43,014
Scott: Good because I got a whole seat to myself, good because no one bothered me, bad because it was hot, and bad because the hotness put me to sleep and I almost didn't wake up.

23
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:46,825
Scott: I couldn't keep my eyes open to play Pokemon.

24
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:48,530
Scott: I dropped my stylus at one point.

25
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:49,715
Rym: I know that feeling.

26
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:50,538
Scott: Because I was just tired.

27
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:53,310
Rym: It's real easy to fall asleep during Pokemon too, the way it plays.

28
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,370
Scott: I know, I just dropped the stylus at one point and I saved and turned it off.

29
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:06,910
Rym: Actually the worst thing was I was playing Pokemon like sometime last week and I kind of fell asleep and I woke up and I look out the window and I see things I don't recognize.

30
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,193
Scott: Yup, and then you go, oh shit.

31
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:10,440
Rym: And I'm thinking, did I go past Beacon?

32
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,610
Rym: Am I on my way to frickin' New Hamburg?

33
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:17,985
Rym: What am I gonna, and for a while I'm looking like, do I remember that?

34
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:19,210
Rym: I don't know if I remember that.

35
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,356
Scott: And then you see something you remember.

36
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:21,803
Rym: Yup, I saw something I remember.

37
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:23,150
Scott: I've had that feeling many times.

38
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,338
Rym: Well the thing I saw that I remembered was Sing Sing.

39
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:27,747
Scott: You were way down there then.

40
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:28,350
Rym: Yeah I was.

41
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:32,570
Rym: I fell asleep, you know that you fall asleep for a second but it feels like you were asleep for an hour.

42
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,890
Scott: Yeah it's like there's a lot of landmarks on both sides of the train, right, that you remember.

43
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,350
Scott: And then everything in between those landmarks you don't remember for shit.

44
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:47,850
Scott: So if you actually, you know, decide that you want to figure out where you are and you look out at a time when none of those landmarks are present.

45
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,790
Scott: You're gonna be a bit confused and lost and scared.

46
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,870
Scott: But in addition to that, I've uh, let me talk about a different train, the subway train.

47
00:02:57,251 --> 00:03:00,118
Scott: You know, it's not, the subway is not the same as the commuter train.

48
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:04,830
Scott: You know, it's underground, it just takes you from here to there in the city, you don't ride it for very long.

49
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,813
Scott: Usually standing up.

50
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:08,023
Scott: But I've got a new game on the subway.

51
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:09,770
Scott: See, I take the local train.

52
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:19,290
Scott: And I look out at my new game, is when I'm on the local train, I stand there looking out the window of the door at the track where the express train runs.

53
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:26,090
Scott: And about, without fail, about once a day, the local train will run next to the express train.

54
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,689
Scott: And there's people in that express train over there looking at me.

55
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,277
Rym: It's always kind of weird.

56
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:33,530
Rym: It's not the kind of thing you get to see every day.

57
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,926
Scott: Yeah, and I look at them and I make sure I make eye contact and hold on to it.

58
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:38,990
Scott: Maybe I'll make a funny face.

59
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:41,378
Scott: Because there's nothing they could do.

60
00:03:41,418 --> 00:03:42,304
Scott: They're in another train.

61
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:43,310
Scott: What are they gonna do to me?

62
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,970
Scott: I wouldn't dare make eye, maintain eye contact with someone I didn't know in the same car as me.

63
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,570
Rym: Because they might be a crazy guy.

64
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,649
Scott: They might be a crazy guy.

65
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,118
Rym: I made that mistake once.

66
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:54,110
Rym: I was sitting there with some people on a subway train.

67
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:56,682
Rym: And this guy is just like grooving to himself.

68
00:03:57,325 --> 00:03:58,129
Rym: And he looks up at me.

69
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,698
Rym: And I don't immediately avert my eyes.

70
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,987
Rym: I just kind of look at him like, "Hey, you were

71
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:03,368
Rym: grooving.".

72
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:06,159
Rym: He was the craziest motherfucking crackhead.

73
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,222
Rym: Good God.

74
00:04:07,242 --> 00:04:09,310
Rym: Guy followed me around for a while.

75
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:09,910
Scott: Yep.

76
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:12,958
Scott: So I make faces at these people.

77
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:17,269
Scott: And so far I've gotten a nod and a smile.

78
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,870
Scott: I'm trying to get like a funny face back, but we'll see.

79
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:28,690
Rym: That's very similar to my very favorite pastime of whenever I see a little kid, especially if they're with their parents, the younger the better.

80
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:38,090
Rym: But as long as they're old enough to be at least semi-sentient, when their parents not looking, I'll make some crazy face at them and I'll stop before they can get their parent to look.

81
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:45,021
Rym: And the conversations that these little kids have with their parents involve, "That man something, something.

82
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:46,428
Rym: Don't bother that young

83
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:46,670
Rym: man.".

84
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,759
Rym: Or, "Don't bother that nice

85
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:47,982
Rym: man.".

86
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:48,264
Rym: Or, "Be

87
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:48,648
Rym: quiet.".

88
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:52,710
Rym: And the kid, and as soon as the kid's like blah, blah, blah, blah, the mom doesn't believe him.

89
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:55,082
Rym: And then the mom's looking away and the kid's staring at me.

90
00:04:55,102 --> 00:04:56,931
Rym: I do the face again and they go nuts.

91
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:06,600
Rym: Because they don't expect some guy in business clothes with like a pager and a tie on or whatever to make a funny face randomly.

92
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:07,603
Scott: Yep.

93
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:09,970
Scott: That's a fun game to play.

94
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:12,661
Rym: Actually I've been having my own problems on the trains lately.

95
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:18,810
Rym: With gas prices going up, more and more I'm seeing a lot of people trying to take the train to work.

96
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,837
Scott: And they don't know how?

97
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,370
Rym: Who don't know how it functions.

98
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,430
Scott: And they get on the wrong train and they're fucked?

99
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:29,093
Rym: Or they just don't understand and they're trying to buy tickets at the ticket machine and holding the line up.

100
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:31,724
Rym: Or they don't understand how the ticket works.

101
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:34,557
Rym: They stand at the door like, "How do I give my ticket to get

102
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:34,799
Rym: on?"

103
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,805
Rym: Or, "Where's the guy to let me

104
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:36,148
Rym: on?".

105
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,090
Rym: The guy comes and asks for the ticket and they don't know they needed one.

106
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,341
Rym: They don't understand.

107
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,370
Rym: They show them their credit card.

108
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:43,802
Rym: They wonder why they have to pay more on the train.

109
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:45,230
Rym: They bitch and complain.

110
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:51,480
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people who don't use trains often cause a lot of trouble and commuter people don't like them.

111
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:57,850
Rym: Granted, I didn't know how to use the train once the first time I used a train and I figured it out.

112
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,654
Scott: You get on the train.

113
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:01,400
Scott: It takes you where you want to go.

114
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,846
Scott: You get your ass off.

115
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:03,929
Scott: The end.

116
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,230
Scott: Make sure you get on the train going in the right direction or you're going the wrong way.

117
00:06:08,913 --> 00:06:11,484
Scott: If you're in Grand Central, you can't go the wrong way.

118
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:12,810
Scott: You can only go to the wrong place.

119
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:13,912
Scott: All right.

120
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:15,249
Rym: So what do you got for me?

121
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:19,925
Scott: So there wasn't too much tech news like, "OMG, new products.

122
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:20,668
Scott: OMG, new

123
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,230
Scott: technology.".

124
00:06:21,693 --> 00:06:23,465
Scott: But there was an interesting article.

125
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:24,150
Scott: some guy wrote.

126
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:25,141
Rym: Oh, great.

127
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:25,550
Rym: Some guy.

128
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,414
Rym: Yeah.

129
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:28,124
Scott: I think his name is Chris Anderson.

130
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:29,210
Scott: He's from the long tail.

131
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,977
Scott: And he says, basically, it's a pretty short article.

132
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:34,200
Scott: And he says, "You know what?

133
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:40,419
Scott: Open stuff is a product of boredom.

134
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,757
Scott: People have spare cycles when there's nothing else that they need to be doing or required to be

135
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:45,098
Scott: doing.".

136
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,370
Scott: So as a result, they dig things.

137
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:49,935
Scott: They write blog posts.

138
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:52,163
Scott: They write Wikipedia articles.

139
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:54,110
Scott: They write open source software.

140
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:58,764
Scott: And some guy rebutted him and was like, "It's not true.

141
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:03,101
Scott: There are selfless people who are working for the greater good blah blah blah.

142
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:04,950
Scott: It's not just because they're bored and have nothing better to

143
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,150
Scott: do.".

144
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:16,936
Scott: And I think the problem with the second guy was that he took the first guy as saying, "It's only a product of boredom.

145
00:07:16,976 --> 00:07:19,927
Scott: The only reason these things exist is

146
00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:20,248
Scott: boredom.".

147
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:24,230
Scott: And I got to say, I agree mostly with the first guy.

148
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:31,294
Rym: Well, I think the problem is that the second guy takes the idea of boredom to be some sort of negative connotation.

149
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:36,231
Rym: I mean, to me, boredom just means, "Nothing I do in my life challenges me.

150
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:37,536
Rym: I'm going to seek out

151
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:38,159
Rym: challenges.".

152
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,584
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know what we call something you do when you're bored and you have nothing else to do?

153
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:44,710
Scott: A hobby.

154
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,956
Rym: Possibly entertainment.

155
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:47,699
Scott: Possibly.

156
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:56,982
Scott: If you really think about it, other people who are not writing Wikipedia articles or writing open source software, when they're bored, what do they do?

157
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:57,889
Rym: They watch TV.

158
00:07:58,672 --> 00:08:03,750
Scott: Oh, so apparently those people are all right because they're not bored.

159
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:10,928
Scott: I mean, it's not bad to do something when you're bored because then you're not bored.

160
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,945
Scott: If anything, I think it's really good that people are bored because it means people aren't worried about their survival.

161
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:18,690
Scott: Yeah, I think it is.

162
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,541
Scott: Their whole Laszlo hierarchy of needs is satisfied.

163
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:32,009
Rym: The fact, the bare fact that there are people in this country or in this world who have the luxury of being bored speaks volumes of how far we have come as a race.

164
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,303
Scott: Yeah, I mean, there are even poor people who get bored.

165
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:36,950
Scott: That's pretty damn good right there.

166
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,239
Scott: There are poor people who are fat, really fat.

167
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:48,581
Rym: Actually, I just read an interesting article Emily pointed out to me about how there is a pretty much direct and clear correlation between lack of money and obesity.

168
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:53,962
Scott: Yeah, because it's cheaper to get high calorie fast food and less work.

169
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:57,995
Rym: See, I always kind of knew that, but reading the article, it's actually scary.

170
00:08:58,296 --> 00:09:02,670
Rym: the ratio of calories per dollar in crappy food as opposed to good food.

171
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:05,123
Rym: It's orders of magnitude cheaper.

172
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:06,290
Rym: It's not just a little bit.

173
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,735
Scott: Yeah, and the thing is you're poor.

174
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,089
Scott: You got to work all the time if you're working at all.

175
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:18,561
Scott: Or you didn't get a good education and you're too dumb, so either you can't cook or you don't have time to cook and thus you have to eat the fast food.

176
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:20,492
Rym: I think money is more of a factor than anything.

177
00:09:20,873 --> 00:09:21,455
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

178
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:29,144
Rym: Well, especially considering that the money comes down to the corn subsidies and how there's a vested interest in making that food.

179
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:35,788
Scott: Food is not expensive, you know, unless you want steaks and things, but it takes more time.

180
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,402
Scott: You have to have you have to know how to cook and you have to spend time.

181
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:39,187
Rym: But see, that's the thing.

182
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:40,011
Rym: It's still a cost.

183
00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:41,176
Rym: It's an opportunity cost.

184
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:48,325
Rym: And the opportunity cost of helpful food is far higher than the opportunity cost of high calorie food.

185
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:56,881
Scott: Yeah, I'm just saying that, you know, like the financial like paying how much money you have to pay to the grocery store to get vegetables versus to get actually nasty stuff.

186
00:09:57,082 --> 00:10:03,523
Rym: Actually, while the nasty stuff doesn't nourish you very well, it has far more calories per dollar than everything else.

187
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:05,490
Scott: Yeah, calories per dollar.

188
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:06,071
Scott: Yes.

189
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:12,999
Scott: We're talking about, you know, OK, you can either eat lunch at McDonald's or you can make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or two.

190
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,438
Scott: The peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are cheaper and healthier financially speaking anyway.

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,658
Scott: So, yeah, open source and things like that are because people are bored and have nothing else to do.

192
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,019
Scott: Yeah.

193
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:32,290
Scott: I mean, seek satisfaction and such and they spend their time doing things that benefit everyone rather than watching TV.

194
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:33,515
Scott: And that's a good thing.

195
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:34,338
Scott: So there.

196
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:34,941
Rym: Yeah.

197
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:39,640
Rym: I mean, part of the reason we do GeekNights is because otherwise we'd be cripplingly bored.

198
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,222
Rym: Yeah.

199
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:43,093
Rym: I mean, you should have seen us now before we did this show.

200
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:44,117
Rym: We come home from work.

201
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:44,559
Scott: Yep.

202
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,977
Rym: And we'd watch a bunch of anime, play a bunch of video games, play a bunch of board games.

203
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:50,805
Rym: Then it would be like seven thirty.

204
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:51,146
Scott: Yeah.

205
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:51,990
Scott: We still have.

206
00:10:52,512 --> 00:10:53,114
Scott: we'd eat dinner.

207
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:54,339
Scott: It would be like eight thirty.

208
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,660
Rym: Yep.

209
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:55,343
Rym: Now what?

210
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:56,006
Scott: Now what?

211
00:10:56,267 --> 00:11:00,303
Scott: We'd poke on the computers, visit the same websites and go to bed or whatever.

212
00:11:00,323 --> 00:11:02,392
Scott: I mean, now because I have GeekNights.

213
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:02,995
Scott: Sure.

214
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:04,241
Scott: There's a lot of entertainment.

215
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:08,442
Scott: That's actually because GeekNights kind of takes a little bit longer than all those entertainments did.

216
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:11,918
Scott: So now I've got like some uncheck entertainment, uncheck.

217
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,549
Rym: You know how little anime we get to watch these days?

218
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:16,317
Scott: I know I got a bunch of unwatched anime.

219
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:18,024
Rym: Netflix is practically useless.

220
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,390
Scott: My Pokemon are untrained.

221
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,616
Scott: My unread comics.

222
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:24,728
Scott: I got Paper Mario only half beaten, et cetera, et cetera.

223
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:25,290
Scott: But you know what?

224
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,048
Scott: I'd rather have that than have all those things done and me sitting here doing nothing.

225
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:30,510
Rym: Yeah.

226
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,257
Rym: Granted, boredom is one factor.

227
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:38,928
Rym: The other factor is definitely the fact that we're kind of egomaniacal and we want people to listen to us and we like the sounds of our own voices.

228
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:41,599
Rym: But that beside the point, maybe that's maybe that's Rym.

229
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,483
Scott: Yeah, definitely.

230
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:42,804
Scott: Yeah.

231
00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:44,270
Rym: But but what?

232
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:46,115
Scott: I'm not any of those things.

233
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:52,461
Rym: So anyway, speaking of egomaniacal people, there is a nation called Thailand.

234
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:59,764
Scott: If you are not familiar with it, you might have seen the movie King and I or seen the play or read the play in Thailand.

235
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:04,920
Rym: They have a king and it's a constitutional monarchy and the king is protected by law.

236
00:12:05,402 --> 00:12:10,397
Rym: And the law says that you can't make fun of the king or else you go to jail for 15 years.

237
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:10,979
Scott: Yeah.

238
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,950
Rym: Well, someone posted a video on YouTube.

239
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,667
Rym: I don't think they're even in Thailand of the king next to a pair of feet.

240
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,112
Rym: I didn't watch the video or anything.

241
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:27,354
Rym: And apparently it is incredibly insulting to show the king of Thailand next to a foot or a pair of feet.

242
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:28,297
Scott: Why so?

243
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:32,630
Rym: I don't know or care because it's just one of those funny things.

244
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,200
Scott: If anyone knows anything about Thailand.

245
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,519
Scott: Well, I know a few things about Thailand that are unpleasant, at least modern day.

246
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,127
Rym: Well, the thing is, I could look it up trivially.

247
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:43,646
Rym: I could click on the link in front of me and see the video, but I just really don't care.

248
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:48,047
Rym: Yeah, I don't really care either when something offends someone else, especially if it's something like that.

249
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:53,913
Rym: I care so little other than perhaps the entertainment value I'll get out of making a picture of it and then showing it to them.

250
00:12:54,134 --> 00:12:54,335
Rym: Yeah.

251
00:12:54,415 --> 00:13:00,898
Scott: I mean, if anything, if you're going to make fun of the king of Thailand, why don't you like do like king of Thailand meat spin remix or something?

252
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:06,152
Scott: That'll that'll work a lot better for you.

253
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:11,434
Rym: because it says in the article that Thailand, 79 year old king is universally adored by ties.

254
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:19,917
Rym: Now I point out that if he's universally adored, yet they have a law that makes it illegal to basically not adore him.

255
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:25,073
Rym: Then I wonder how genuine this universal universal adoration actually is.

256
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:32,835
Scott: It's hard to say because I could imagine, you know, a world in which, you know, everyone likes him.

257
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:36,874
Rym: Well, someone doesn't like him because they posted a picture of him with a foot on YouTube.

258
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:37,918
Scott: Oh, no.

259
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,669
Scott: Maybe they were just like a silly punk kid or something.

260
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,810
Rym: Yeah.

261
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:47,979
Rym: Well, the thing is the king of Thailand, or at least the government is seriously considering suing YouTube under these laws.

262
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:50,288
Rym: Now, I don't know if they what they expect.

263
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:51,733
Rym: They're going to throw YouTube in jail.

264
00:13:52,094 --> 00:13:54,262
Rym: It's not like anyone who runs YouTube.

265
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,538
Rym: or, you know, Google is going to just go to Thailand and serve time.

266
00:13:58,678 --> 00:13:58,839
Scott: Yeah.

267
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:06,372
Scott: I don't think anyone from Google is going to be extradited to Thailand anytime soon, even though that Australian guy seems to have been extradited to the United States.

268
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,919
Scott: I don't know details about that.

269
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,602
Rym: I don't either.

270
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:12,279
Scott: But so far, the only thing I've heard about that is you telling me when I got home.

271
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:13,886
Rym: Actually, it was all over the news.

272
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:14,469
Rym: Yeah.

273
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:18,261
Scott: Well, let's get some info before we assume anything about it.

274
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:26,552
Rym: I guess it bothers me whenever someone goes on the Internet and sees something that offends them or that is in violation of their local laws.

275
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:39,982
Rym: And they somehow feel that because it has affected them, that they have the right to tell the rest of the world who doesn't believe in their bullshit, doesn't have any law making it illegal to do this thing and doesn't care what to do.

276
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:50,718
Rym: If I want to draw a picture of Mohammed hugging the king of Thailand next to a giant foot, I am perfectly OK with doing that because I'm not a Muslim and I'm not a citizen of Thailand.

277
00:14:50,979 --> 00:14:53,989
Scott: I mean, laws are all about social contract.

278
00:14:54,009 --> 00:15:01,538
Scott: You know, people agree with each other to do certain things, you know, and not to do certain things, because that's what the society is agreed upon.

279
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,002
Scott: If some other society of people agrees upon something, well, they can all follow whatever they agreed upon.

280
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,973
Scott: And us people over here follow what we agreed upon.

281
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:18,639
Scott: And if something that we do happens to fly over and bump into your society and you don't like it, tough shit.

282
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,057
Scott: If you do something that happens to fly over and bump into us, tough shit for us to now.

283
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:36,840
Rym: granted not to say that I am in any way saying that cultural relativism is something we should strive for, because there are a lot of things that offend me out there in the world that people do in certain countries.

284
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:42,749
Rym: And at the same time, I feel very justified in being offended by those things and doing everything in my power to end those things.

285
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:57,372
Rym: But if something is media, just media, and it is put on to Internet, you know, that giant Wild West of Bhutanari girls running around hitting people in the foot with Thai one of these kings.

286
00:15:58,236 --> 00:15:59,480
Rym: There's nothing wrong with that.

287
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:02,231
Rym: And no one has any right to tell anyone not to put it up there.

288
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:05,001
Scott: Yeah, just if you don't like it, don't look at it.

289
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:05,563
Rym: Yeah.

290
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:10,240
Scott: I mean, granted, if you want, you can be like China and filter it all out.

291
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:12,107
Rym: Yeah, we know how well that's working.

292
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,054
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm not really too upset.

293
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,639
Scott: I mean, sure, it's wrong.

294
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,460
Scott: If I had my way, China would have, you know, but that's what China has done.

295
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,110
Scott: And they're allowed to do that within their own country.

296
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:29,480
Scott: And, you know, it doesn't really hurt me.

297
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:39,635
Rym: So, yeah, of course, also, it just comes down to the very simple fact that if you were ever offended by something on the Internet, good, you don't belong on the Internet anymore.

298
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:41,542
Scott: Welcome to the new world.

299
00:16:42,105 --> 00:16:43,048
Scott: Congratulations.

300
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:46,841
Scott: The first two digits of the year are now two zero and not one nine.

301
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:47,785
Rym: Luckily, wake up.

302
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:50,698
Rym: It's pretty easy to avoid things that offend you on the Internet.

303
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,442
Rym: I mean, if you're a person who can be offended, just don't go to any of the good sites and you won't see any of those things.

304
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:56,729
Scott: Just don't go anywhere.

305
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:57,452
Scott: Don't go to Fark.

306
00:16:57,572 --> 00:16:58,978
Scott: You just stick with Google News.

307
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:02,574
Scott: You'll probably never be offended except by actual real world happenings.

308
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:10,450
Rym: It always amazes me when I'll be on Fark and there'll be a headline and someone makes light of the fact that someone died due to their own stupidity in some sort of hilarious way.

309
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:18,517
Rym: And then there's always that one guy who posts about how offended he is that someone had the audacity to make fun of something on the Internet.

310
00:17:19,861 --> 00:17:22,789
Scott: But that guy, I want to meet that guy.

311
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:28,085
Rym: For all we know, it's just one guy and he just has an account.

312
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:28,847
Scott: It's a spark.

313
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:30,272
Scott: It's probably just a guy pretending.

314
00:17:30,754 --> 00:17:32,198
Rym: See, it's hard to tell anymore.

315
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,530
Rym: Fark is so full of trolls, but not bad trolls.

316
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:41,371
Rym: I mean, there are bad trolls, but also good trolls that I usually cannot tell if someone is trolling or just stupid.

317
00:17:41,652 --> 00:17:58,452
Scott: This is why when I read posts on the Internet, like text that someone has posted on the Internet, I take the collective body of work someone has written in their forum posts and emails and blog posts and whatever, and I consider that to be like a separate entity from the person themselves.

318
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:03,775
Scott: What someone posts on the Internet tells me nothing about the actual person whatsoever and I assume nothing.

319
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:06,567
Scott: The problem is a lot of other people do not follow this rule.

320
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:15,243
Scott: So they'll read something I've written and assume a lot of things about me based on their interpretation of what I've done or written in some forum somewhere.

321
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:16,588
Rym: Granted, I can say this.

322
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:20,404
Rym: If you've ever posted a comment on a YouTube video, you're probably a bad person.

323
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:22,673
Scott: I've posted comments on YouTube videos.

324
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,723
Rym: Have you ever read the comments on YouTube videos?

325
00:18:24,743 --> 00:18:25,365
Rym: They're terrible.

326
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:30,468
Rym: Posting on YouTube is like pissing off a cliff and somehow expecting that to affect the world.

327
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:31,533
Scott: That's pretty much what it is.

328
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,521
Scott: I've pissed off a cliff before, though, so.

329
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:35,790
Scott: Actually, sometimes someone gets wet.

330
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,271
Scott: It's funny.

331
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:39,662
Rym: Are you telling me that you pissed on someone?

332
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:40,766
Scott: No, no, no.

333
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,130
Scott: I meant metaphorically.

334
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:48,540
Rym: OK, OK, because the two statements followed together that one, you have pissed off a cliff and two, it's funny when someone gets wet because of that.

335
00:18:48,982 --> 00:18:52,357
Scott: Well, I just reminded me of something similar when you're in Israel.

336
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,050
Scott: One of the activities we did on the pissing off cliff.

337
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,301
Scott: No, one of the activities on the trip that we did was repelling.

338
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:58,742
Scott: Right.

339
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:07,695
Scott: So we repelled like down this hole on the top of a mountain into like a little cave and then out the side of that cave and then to the ground.

340
00:19:07,756 --> 00:19:07,956
Scott: Right.

341
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,325
Scott: In that little cave was bait.

342
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:12,293
Scott: You're basically ankle deep in mountain goat shit.

343
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:15,346
Scott: All these little black pellets everywhere standing.

344
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:15,888
Scott: Yeah.

345
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:20,557
Scott: And that pissing on a cliff reminded me of repelling into ankle deep goat shit.

346
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,330
Rym: Things of the day.

347
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:31,102
Rym: We had those dorm pranks a while ago and they were pretty good.

348
00:19:31,564 --> 00:19:37,121
Rym: And I was hunting around looking for dorm pranks at RIT and I didn't find anything worthwhile.

349
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:41,515
Scott: RIT, so disappointing, not putting the dorm pranks on YouTube.

350
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:46,294
Rym: So eventually, so I was directed to a dorm prank that hasn't made it on dig or anywhere.

351
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:49,809
Rym: And they say we take apart this guy's room in twenty five minutes.

352
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:50,734
Rym: He left his door unlocked.

353
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:51,236
Rym: No big deal.

354
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:51,558
Rym: All right.

355
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:54,652
Rym: So I figure I'll watch it, see if it's good enough watching.

356
00:19:55,073 --> 00:20:08,834
Rym: And it's a time lapse of these two guys taking apart a kid's entire dorm room piece by piece, very methodically and precisely until they have emptied every single possession he owned from his dorm room.

357
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:09,777
Scott: Wow.

358
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:17,063
Rym: Now, in twenty five minutes, mind you, that alone is a pretty OK prank because, you know, you can see a kid coming home.

359
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:19,112
Rym: He opens his door, doesn't see anything.

360
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,701
Rym: He'll pause and think, is this my dorm room?

361
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,926
Rym: Did I get robbed?

362
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:23,870
Scott: Where'd all my shit go?

363
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,437
Rym: And they walk and everything was gone.

364
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:30,109
Scott: Like they took his his desk and everything.

365
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:34,104
Scott: They his posters off the wall, all his clothes out of his closet.

366
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:35,570
Scott: Absolutely everything was gone.

367
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,057
Rym: So that alone is an OK prank.

368
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:40,447
Rym: And I wouldn't think that's a damn good prank.

369
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:42,919
Scott: Some guy comes back to his dorm and there's nothing there.

370
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,462
Rym: We'll see.

371
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:48,461
Rym: If I was doing the prank, I would have gone one step further and swapped two people's rooms entirely.

372
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:52,898
Rym: Oh, because then they both come home and just never say a word about it.

373
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,083
Rym: Don't get the reaction shot.

374
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:55,550
Rym: Never admit you did it.

375
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:57,958
Rym: If they're smart, they just trade keys.

376
00:20:58,018 --> 00:21:02,498
Scott: If you swap them really perfectly and precisely like took pictures and then you play.

377
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:05,590
Rym: I'm talking you put the garbage on the floor back where it was.

378
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:06,974
Scott: Exactly, exactly.

379
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:10,509
Rym: But anyway, this wouldn't have been a thing of the day material in and of itself.

380
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:20,883
Rym: But then about four minutes through the video, the coup de gras, the the final point, the cherry on top, they show a piece of paper they have printed in color.

381
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:31,258
Rym: And the piece of paper basically says to the name of the student from campus security, whatever due to drug, whatever findings we have confiscated all of your goods.

382
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:36,295
Rym: You are hereby kicked out of the dorms report to whatever and they stick it to his door.

383
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:46,608
Rym: Now, that is just brilliant because obviously this kid was a little bit because otherwise this wouldn't have been it wouldn't have worked.

384
00:21:46,749 --> 00:21:53,960
Scott: I think what happened is these kids started out by stealing his and then they used it and then they got this idea.

385
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:55,688
Rym: I could definitely see that.

386
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,777
Scott: That's quite a likely possibility.

387
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:01,856
Rym: Now, we can't get the reaction shot because they weren't smart enough to put a camera up at the peephole.

388
00:22:02,438 --> 00:22:07,702
Rym: And obviously you can't just have a guy with a camera standing outside the door of the person you're about to prank.

389
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:10,538
Scott: No, it doesn't work because then you're like, why are you pointing a camera at me, guys?

390
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:17,493
Rym: But you do get a little bit of reaction shot at the end where they open the door after the guy's freaking out and the guy's like, dude, I was freaking out.

391
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:21,125
Scott: Yeah, but they saw all the stuff in the room there.

392
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:31,124
Scott: It was pretty crazy because the guys who did this actually made quite a sacrifice and they basically put two dorms worth of stuff in their own dorm, making it impossible to sleep or do anything.

393
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:33,052
Rym: They made a nice little slide out of it, though.

394
00:22:33,192 --> 00:22:34,859
Scott: Yes, a nice fun mattress slide.

395
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:41,162
Scott: OK, if you've been listening in recent weeks, you will know I am quite the fan of the tower defense game.

396
00:22:41,544 --> 00:22:44,475
Rym: I've played one tower defense game, desktop tower defense.

397
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:47,367
Rym: I feel that I've defeated it and I've stopped playing it.

398
00:22:47,507 --> 00:22:49,577
Rym: I probably will never play a tower defense game again.

399
00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:53,234
Scott: Well, desktop tower defense game is probably still the best tower defense game.

400
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,891
Scott: However, it's a little bit rough around the edges, if I if you will.

401
00:22:58,312 --> 00:23:04,113
Scott: It is the best because it allows you to make your own maze as opposed to just optimizing towers and existing maze.

402
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:07,724
Scott: However, it can improve in some other areas.

403
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:10,735
Scott: And I do still believe a better tower defense game can be made.

404
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:23,649
Scott: Well, here's another tower defense game that's not quite as good as desktop tower defense, but everything that desktop tower defense does not have, this one does have and everything this one does not have desktop tower defense does have.

405
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:28,506
Scott: So if you combine these two, you'll make the best tower defense game ever, at least so far.

406
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:32,919
Scott: This game is called VR Defender Y3K.

407
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,477
Scott: The theme of it is that you're defending a computer from viruses and when enough of them get through, you lose.

408
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,505
Scott: What's so great about this game?

409
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:43,658
Scott: Well, first of all, it has a lot of interesting towers.

410
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:45,967
Scott: Like this has this nice flamethrower tower.

411
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:53,654
Scott: that's pretty cool and the graphics are all slick and polished and there's three different techno songs to listen to, all of which are quite good.

412
00:23:53,674 --> 00:23:55,561
Scott: And everything about it I like.

413
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,191
Scott: and it has easy, hard and impossible mode.

414
00:23:58,231 --> 00:24:00,078
Scott: And yes, the impossible mode is impossible.

415
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,534
Scott: And this has provided me with quite a few hours of enjoyment at work.

416
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:10,579
Scott: So if you're bored of desktop tower defense, this one will occupy your time for maybe a week or two.

417
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,957
Rym: I have to admit, I watched Scott play it for a little bit and it was highly slick.

418
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:16,082
Scott: It was very slick.

419
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:20,219
Scott: If desktop tower defense was this slick, you that would be playing that one for months.

420
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:23,291
Scott: They should make that game for the DS is what they should do.

421
00:24:24,555 --> 00:24:26,761
Scott: Ultimate tower defense DS winner.

422
00:24:27,323 --> 00:24:30,091
Rym: Oh man, tower defense games on the DS have to be made.

423
00:24:30,131 --> 00:24:31,075
Rym: Good fucking God.

424
00:24:31,195 --> 00:24:31,376
Rym: Yep.

425
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:33,525
Rym: If only Nintendo would give us a dev kit.

426
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:34,248
Scott: If only.

427
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:38,702
Rym: We could get one for the Wii, but we couldn't get one for the DS.

428
00:24:39,284 --> 00:24:43,455
Scott: Someone's going to home brew a DS tower defense game.

429
00:24:43,575 --> 00:24:43,897
Rym: Anyway.

430
00:24:44,077 --> 00:24:44,198
Rym: Yeah.

431
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:47,812
Rym: Well, there's been a lot of talk about me building a new computer.

432
00:24:47,993 --> 00:24:48,877
Rym: Yes, the rumors are true.

433
00:24:48,977 --> 00:24:50,504
Rym: I did in fact order my computer.

434
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,468
Scott: Head for the hills.

435
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:52,533
Scott: It's the end of the world.

436
00:24:52,995 --> 00:24:55,145
Rym: The only thing I haven't bought yet is my new monitor.

437
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:59,020
Rym: I'm probably going to get one of those super cheap on sale Dell widescreens.

438
00:24:59,441 --> 00:24:59,883
Scott: Yeah.

439
00:25:00,023 --> 00:25:09,013
Scott: I mean, you know, whether you're a fan of Dell computers or not, they have these really big, really good widescreen monitors at really good prices.

440
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:14,915
Scott: Like the 20 inch ultra sharp widescreen is probably the best deal in the entire world of monitors.

441
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:20,878
Scott: That's why, you know, at first I was like, how are so many people buying these 20 inch monitors that are wide screen?

442
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:22,043
Scott: Are they like all rich?

443
00:25:22,544 --> 00:25:24,612
Scott: No, the thing's only like 300 bucks.

444
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:25,416
Scott: It's not bad.

445
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:25,496
Rym: Yep.

446
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,950
Rym: Well, the thing is they are kind of small, but they're high resolution.

447
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:30,454
Scott: That's what it's all about.

448
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:32,201
Scott: Like for my laptop, right?

449
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:35,552
Scott: As a 10.6 inch monitor, that's nothing, but you know what?

450
00:25:36,074 --> 00:25:38,342
Scott: It's 1280 by 768.

451
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:38,984
Scott: Think about that.

452
00:25:39,124 --> 00:25:40,870
Scott: Think about how small those pixels are.

453
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:42,236
Scott: It looks damn good.

454
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:44,948
Scott: I can tell you that it's all about having small pixels.

455
00:25:44,968 --> 00:25:50,203
Scott: Like at work, I have a 22 inch monitor widescreen, but the resolution is like 1680 by 1050.

456
00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:53,353
Scott: Those pixels are huge.

457
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:56,769
Scott: So it doesn't look so great when you're up close, you got to sit far back from it.

458
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,955
Scott: And then what's, what's the point?

459
00:25:58,477 --> 00:26:04,260
Scott: if the pixels on that monitor was there as small as the ones on my LCD on my laptop, that'd be the best monitor in the world.

460
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:15,373
Rym: But anyway, one of the most important parts of a computer, if you're going to build one, and I guess it matters if you're getting one from Dell or gateway or whatever, because a lot of them, especially like those Alienwares offer special ones.

461
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:20,070
Rym: The computer case is actually something you got to put some thought into.

462
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:21,736
Scott: Also known as the chassis.

463
00:26:22,078 --> 00:26:31,238
Scott: It's basically for those of you who don't know, you have a computer, it's a motherboard and a video card and a bunch of chips and wires and things like that, but you got to put those things in a box.

464
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,082
Rym: You don't have to.

465
00:26:32,102 --> 00:26:39,918
Rym: I have more than once run a computer that was literally a motherboard sitting on a piece of cardboard and a bunch of hard drives and stuff plugged into it, just laying next to it.

466
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,960
Scott: However, this can be problematic because number one, your computer is not protected from the elements.

467
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,913
Scott: So you don't want to have a computer lying open.

468
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:50,024
Scott: If you spill a coffee or something, you're screwed.

469
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:51,952
Rym: Oh, if your friend Scott Johnson comes over.

470
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:52,675
Scott: Yup.

471
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:56,248
Scott: Number two, the computer is not protected from static discharge.

472
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:58,418
Rym: If say, if your friend Scott Johnson comes over.

473
00:26:58,478 --> 00:26:58,759
Rym: Yes.

474
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:08,076
Scott: If your friend Scott Johnson comes over, he might statically shock your motherboard from a few feet away after rubbing his wool socks on your carpet and then game over computer.

475
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:13,110
Scott: The case of the computer serves a few important functions.

476
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:16,646
Scott: Number one, it protects the case from the elements as I just said.

477
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,775
Rym: Well, it protects the computer from the elements.

478
00:27:18,815 --> 00:27:26,165
Rym: The case does not protect itself unless you have some sort of meta case, perhaps a case case, some sort of encasement around the case.

479
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:26,587
Rym: Yes.

480
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:27,028
Scott: Okay.

481
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:28,657
Scott: Protects the computer from the element.

482
00:27:28,718 --> 00:27:33,023
Rym: It's like those people who have a nice couch and then they put a plastic sheet over it because they're afraid of it getting ruined.

483
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:35,074
Rym: Thus defeating the purpose of having the nice couch.

484
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:35,495
Rym: Yes.

485
00:27:35,997 --> 00:27:40,417
Scott: But yeah, if you don't have a, if you have a case, you don't have to worry about spilling something.

486
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:41,000
Scott: I mean, sure.

487
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:43,132
Scott: You might spill something on it, but it's not the end world.

488
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:46,730
Rym: Dude, if you spill something on your computer case, what the hell were you doing?

489
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:47,531
Scott: Yeah.

490
00:27:47,552 --> 00:27:52,314
Scott: You can also, you know, it takes all the components and it makes them take up a lot less physical space.

491
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:55,652
Scott: You know, a motherboard with a bunch of hard drives strewn about takes up your whole desk.

492
00:27:55,993 --> 00:28:02,062
Scott: If you cram those things into a nice box, you can get them in there real tight, you know, and then it takes up a lot less space in your room.

493
00:28:02,102 --> 00:28:04,433
Scott: You can stick the computer in the closet or under your desk.

494
00:28:04,614 --> 00:28:06,320
Rym: Especially with towers.

495
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:06,481
Rym: Cause.

496
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:10,415
Rym: remember back in the day, most computers were not towers like we see today.

497
00:28:10,495 --> 00:28:15,958
Rym: Most of them were big, wide chunks of things that sat on your desk and you stuck the monitor on top of them.

498
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:19,556
Rym: And they took up a bunch of space and they didn't take advantage of that vertical space.

499
00:28:19,818 --> 00:28:19,978
Scott: Yeah.

500
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:23,493
Scott: A lot of computers used to have the, like the keyboard, like an Apple too.

501
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:30,339
Scott: The keyboard and the computer are part of the same physical thing or a Macintosh old school, like a 512 K or a Mac plus.

502
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,672
Scott: the monitor and the computer and the disc drive are all part of the same.

503
00:28:34,692 --> 00:28:36,178
Scott: They're all one thing like an iMac.

504
00:28:36,218 --> 00:28:37,241
Scott: It's one thing.

505
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:44,030
Scott: And that took up a lot of room back in the day when monitors were big and keyboards were big and it, it kind of sucked.

506
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:55,108
Scott: Well, now that we have the tower, you can cram the tower somewhere far away, use extra long cables or even wireless and just have on your desk, a monitor, a nice LCD monitor.

507
00:28:55,128 --> 00:29:00,390
Scott: It doesn't take up much room, a keyboard and a mouse and have all the other stuff far away where it doesn't bother you.

508
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:08,664
Rym: Now, the funny thing is in terms of what kinds of computers geeks build, there was almost an arms race in terms of how big towers could be.

509
00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:14,792
Rym: And the conventional wisdom back in the day was get the biggest goddamn tower you can afford because you're going to fill it with drives.

510
00:29:14,892 --> 00:29:21,252
Rym: And nowadays all those drives have basically been condensed into one drive or two drives.

511
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:29,324
Scott: But yet again, more and more motherboards are coming with Raid and more and more people are doing simple raids in their homes to store their vast media collections.

512
00:29:29,846 --> 00:29:31,595
Scott: And we're going back to having lots of drives.

513
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:31,917
Rym: Yep.

514
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:38,625
Rym: But at the same time, while you're getting all these drives on the inside now, you don't need nearly as many outward facing drives as you used to.

515
00:29:38,705 --> 00:29:43,421
Rym: I mean, the case I use for my current computer, my old one, is gigantic.

516
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,966
Rym: It's absolutely huge.

517
00:29:45,488 --> 00:29:51,768
Rym: It has a whole bunch of open spaces in the front, the five inch bays, and four of them are full of stuff.

518
00:29:51,869 --> 00:29:53,073
Rym: I got my CD burner.

519
00:29:53,354 --> 00:29:54,578
Rym: I got my DVD ROM.

520
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:57,549
Rym: I got my zip drive that hasn't worked in God knows how long.

521
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:57,730
Rym: Yep.

522
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,094
Rym: I got my live drive.

523
00:29:59,355 --> 00:30:02,908
Rym: Maybe if I want some sort of card reader that takes up another one.

524
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:05,136
Rym: But nowadays you don't need all that stuff.

525
00:30:05,457 --> 00:30:06,903
Rym: No one uses zip drives anymore.

526
00:30:06,923 --> 00:30:07,425
Rym: Nope.

527
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:08,128
Scott: Yeah.

528
00:30:08,228 --> 00:30:11,342
Scott: Back in the late 90s, like the full tower was where it's at.

529
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:15,478
Scott: You kind of needed a full tower, mostly because also a lot of motherboards are really big.

530
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:22,141
Scott: And the design of cases hadn't progressed much because, the standards for how these things worked were new.

531
00:30:22,161 --> 00:30:25,955
Scott: Up until then, people just made the entire computer as a unit.

532
00:30:25,995 --> 00:30:29,752
Scott: The case was designed for the motherboard and all these parts were designed to go together.

533
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:36,576
Scott: And you wouldn't just have a motherboard designed in such a way that any case could have that motherboard.

534
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:42,479
Scott: Or any motherboard could take any case and any case could take any motherboard and any drive could fit in any box.

535
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:47,581
Scott: But we came up with standards for those things and everyone followed the same rules and now it's awesome.

536
00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:48,043
Rym: Yep.

537
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:52,881
Rym: I mean, you might hear things like, oh, it's an ATX or it's a micro ATX or it's a BTX.

538
00:30:53,443 --> 00:30:58,300
Rym: Those are the standards that cases use in order to determine what kinds of motherboards can go in them.

539
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:58,561
Rym: Yep.

540
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:05,770
Scott: So if a case says I can take an ATX motherboard, well, any ATX motherboard will now fit in that case, guaranteed pretty much.

541
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:18,522
Scott: That tells you how big the motherboard is, where the holes are to put the screws in, what kind of connector for the power supply you'll have, all sorts of stuff like that is determined by the ATX standard.

542
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:20,610
Rym: Now, the original standard was AT.

543
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,798
Rym: It stands for Advanced Technology.

544
00:31:22,878 --> 00:31:23,099
Scott: Yep.

545
00:31:23,139 --> 00:31:25,509
Scott: That was the standard set by the IBM AT.

546
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,301
Scott: Oh, there was a computer called the IBM AT.

547
00:31:29,602 --> 00:31:41,142
Scott: That's why we always talk about the places where we used to plug in mice and keyboards on computers before we invented USB are called PS2 ports, because those are the same ports that we had in the IBM PS2.

548
00:31:41,162 --> 00:31:41,603
Rym: Yeah.

549
00:31:41,643 --> 00:31:44,371
Rym: Before that, we actually got a jackpot.

550
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:48,820
Rym: Well, I guess jackpot is a relative term of like 20 or 30 AT style or XD.

551
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:48,921
Rym: Yeah.

552
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:54,213
Rym: I think those were ATs.

553
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:54,655
Scott: Yeah.

554
00:31:54,695 --> 00:32:00,278
Scott: But you know, yeah, they used to call it the IBM AT or XT connector was, it looked like a big PS2 port.

555
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,219
Scott: And that's what they used to use to connect the keyboards and the mice to the most of the keyboards.

556
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,381
Rym: Yeah.

557
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:05,367
Rym: We got all those keyboards.

558
00:32:05,387 --> 00:32:06,754
Rym: We thought, oh, sell them on eBay.

559
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:08,583
Rym: And then a year went by and we threw them all away.

560
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:09,025
Scott: Yep.

561
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:11,013
Rym: Like all those bikes we got by that.

562
00:32:11,536 --> 00:32:15,171
Rym: That's a whole other story from the one time we thought dumpster diving was a good idea.

563
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:15,532
Rym: Yep.

564
00:32:15,954 --> 00:32:24,964
Scott: But yeah, ATX has been and continues to be the primary standard for these things since pretty much the mid nineties when ATX took over as the standard.

565
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:25,345
Rym: Yep.

566
00:32:25,807 --> 00:32:26,429
Scott: I mean, sure.

567
00:32:26,449 --> 00:32:27,493
Scott: There are some other standards.

568
00:32:27,534 --> 00:32:28,980
Scott: There's some BTXs out there.

569
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,490
Rym: BTX is really only for like pre-built computers.

570
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:31,931
Rym: Yeah.

571
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:32,957
Rym: Don't worry about it.

572
00:32:33,037 --> 00:32:34,968
Rym: If you get a BTX computer, you didn't build it.

573
00:32:35,008 --> 00:32:35,691
Rym: So it doesn't matter.

574
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:35,932
Scott: Yep.

575
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:41,253
Scott: The thing is BTX and other new standards actually offer a lot of things that ATX can't do.

576
00:32:41,815 --> 00:32:49,179
Scott: Mostly things like we position the CPU on the motherboard for better cooling than ATX can offer and things like that.

577
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:55,684
Scott: And it's actually better, but because the ATX standard is so ingrained and it's good enough, people tend to stick with it.

578
00:32:55,865 --> 00:33:03,435
Scott: And if they suddenly just stop making ATX stuff, a lot of people would be out in the lurch a lot more than when they change CPU sockets or anything like that.

579
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:10,301
Rym: So really all you need to worry about now are ATX and micro ATX and everything else you'll really not run into.

580
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:13,718
Scott: Now there's mini ATX, but I don't know if that's different from micro or if they're the same.

581
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:14,482
Scott: It doesn't really matter.

582
00:33:14,502 --> 00:33:16,833
Rym: I am reasonably certain that it's different.

583
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:17,435
Scott: Yeah.

584
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:17,656
Scott: Okay.

585
00:33:18,057 --> 00:33:18,318
Scott: Anyway.

586
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:18,780
Rym: Yeah.

587
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:23,117
Rym: And very briefly, the only real difference is that micro ATX is obviously smaller.

588
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:30,770
Rym: And if you're building a gaming computer, you probably want an ATX motherboard because they use that extra space to put a lot of extra stuff on the motherboard.

589
00:33:31,252 --> 00:33:36,597
Rym: But if you're just making a computer for your grandma or a normal computer, just for, you know, email or a living room computer.

590
00:33:36,617 --> 00:33:37,100
Scott: Yeah.

591
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:43,467
Rym: Anything that has to be small, anything that doesn't have to be super, super high performing micro ATX motherboards are pretty bad ass.

592
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:44,029
Scott: Yeah.

593
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:45,596
Scott: You can get a really good motherboard.

594
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,530
Scott: It just will probably have like fewer connectors on it.

595
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,126
Scott: So you might not get SLI and you probably, oh, you're not going to get SLI.

596
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:53,812
Scott: I think there might actually be a few with SLI.

597
00:33:54,073 --> 00:34:09,591
Scott: You might not get a really good cooling because it's kind of small and it's a lot of connectors for a whole bunch of hard drives because a tiny case doesn't have room for a whole bunch of hard drives anyway, but you'll get a really small computer that does the job.

598
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:15,815
Scott: So, you know, when you're building a computer, that's probably the first thing you have to decide is, is it going to be an ATX?

599
00:34:15,835 --> 00:34:17,422
Scott: Cause I need a full add on computer.

600
00:34:17,924 --> 00:34:19,330
Scott: Or can I go with the micro ATX?

601
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:21,280
Scott: Cause I'd rather have something smaller and quieter.

602
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:26,199
Rym: Now the other very important factor in a case is that one function it provides is cooling.

603
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,327
Rym: It'll draw air in the front.

604
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:29,893
Rym: It'll pull air out the back.

605
00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:33,387
Rym: Fans are usually arranged in a certain way to maximize cooling.

606
00:34:33,688 --> 00:34:35,295
Rym: Sometimes you have the blow hole in the side.

607
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:36,904
Rym: There's extra exhaust in the top.

608
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:41,041
Rym: You got to decide if you want a positive pressure or a negative pressure system, all those fun things.

609
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:41,422
Scott: Yep.

610
00:34:41,925 --> 00:34:54,011
Scott: Basically you want a computer that takes in lots of cold air from the outside of the computer and pushes lots of hot air that the computer that they can, well, air that the computer has made hot outside of the computer.

611
00:34:54,453 --> 00:35:06,399
Scott: Usually you want exhaust fans in the top and in the back where the hot air is likely to be and intake fans in the front and the bottom where there's not so much hot air in the computer and you're going to pull in air from the outside.

612
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:16,746
Rym: See in the early days, pretty much every case was the same and there was always the one front air intake and then the one back exhaust and then the power supply, which you stick in there acted as kind of an auxiliary exhaust.

613
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:21,067
Scott: Well, the power supply has its own exhaust because the power supply itself makes a lot of heat.

614
00:35:21,308 --> 00:35:29,239
Rym: Yeah, but it also drew air out of the rest of the computer, which was usually already hot, which probably contributed to a lot of those early power supply failures.

615
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,223
Scott: Probably.

616
00:35:30,243 --> 00:35:32,671
Scott: Yeah, but generally one rule is.

617
00:35:32,912 --> 00:35:36,284
Scott: you might think, oh, I want a lot more exhaust than I want intake.

618
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:47,329
Rym: And in fact, a lot of earlier cases required that to work well because they'd usually have along the sides in the front a giant vent that you couldn't put a fan on, but they expected the air to be pulled in from there.

619
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:50,846
Rym: So you needed a lot of exhaust to pull air through and cool the whole case.

620
00:35:50,906 --> 00:35:56,211
Scott: Yep, because if you have a lot of exhaust, the air pressure outside the case is greater than the air pressure inside the case.

621
00:35:56,291 --> 00:36:00,787
Scott: And thus air will just push its way into your case on its own without any fan help.

622
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:06,852
Scott: The problem with that is, of course, that dust goes right into the case because the dust will go in with the air.

623
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:11,532
Rym: Well, more importantly, dust gets into the case from every single hole that the case has.

624
00:36:11,552 --> 00:36:12,114
Rym: Yep.

625
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:18,235
Scott: This is why the new modern thinking is to have a positive pressure case where there is more intake than exhaust.

626
00:36:18,295 --> 00:36:23,836
Scott: The intake fans will pull in lots of air through a filter of some sort, which will collect all the dust.

627
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:28,196
Scott: And the air pressure inside your case will be greater than the air pressure outside your case.

628
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:30,867
Scott: And thus, dust really won't get in there so much.

629
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:36,723
Scott: But you still will have enough exhaust to push the hot air in your case out.

630
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:39,772
Scott: And yeah, your computer will stay cool.

631
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:42,704
Rym: Now it depends very much on what kind of case you have.

632
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:46,922
Rym: So don't automatically go positive pressure, at least look at your case, figure it out.

633
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:48,691
Rym: You don't want to just fiddle with it.

634
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:52,487
Rym: Case is usually designed fairly specifically to be cooled in a certain way.

635
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:59,439
Rym: And if you start putting fans in places where you weren't supposed to put fans and they're facing the wrong direction, you're probably going to have some cooling trouble.

636
00:36:59,640 --> 00:36:59,861
Scott: Yep.

637
00:37:00,223 --> 00:37:08,075
Scott: So just your case will either come with fans or it will have spots where fans obviously go and it'll be obvious which direction those fans should be blowing.

638
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:09,963
Scott: Just do whatever the case wants.

639
00:37:10,365 --> 00:37:11,329
Scott: The case knows best.

640
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:12,975
Scott: The people designing the case figured it out.

641
00:37:13,377 --> 00:37:17,312
Rym: Now the third and more recent use for a case is to show off your bling.

642
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:18,596
Scott: Bling a blingy.

643
00:37:18,757 --> 00:37:27,985
Rym: You should see, I mean, a lot of cases now have windows in the side or cold cathode tubes or they make noise or the fans have colors in them.

644
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:31,477
Rym: And this is a relatively in the last several years, new development.

645
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:33,786
Rym: Cases used to all be the same color.

646
00:37:34,148 --> 00:37:36,295
Scott: Everyone used to get like the just the light.

647
00:37:36,516 --> 00:37:45,528
Scott: eight, seven, whatever it was called case, which is a plain beige box that was really good at holding your motherboard and really good at holding drives.

648
00:37:45,568 --> 00:37:47,718
Scott: And that it did its function correctly.

649
00:37:47,939 --> 00:37:50,371
Scott: And that was the case that people bought because it was cheap and it worked.

650
00:37:50,813 --> 00:37:53,524
Scott: And no one really cared if your case was some other color.

651
00:37:53,544 --> 00:37:58,600
Scott: But then I don't know who did it, but they made a black computer and people were like, ooh.

652
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:02,414
Scott: And then someone decided to mod their case.

653
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:03,279
Scott: They said, hey, you know what?

654
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,990
Scott: I want to look at my computer while I'm using it.

655
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:10,194
Scott: And they cut a hole in the side of their box and they put a piece of plexiglass over it and they could see into their computer.

656
00:38:10,536 --> 00:38:12,363
Scott: I wish I could find that original case mod.

657
00:38:12,765 --> 00:38:15,033
Scott: I remember seeing it on like gadget or something.

658
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:18,646
Rym: And it started this gigantic wave of people modding cases.

659
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:18,907
Scott: Yep.

660
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:21,156
Scott: People started modding cases left and right.

661
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:23,425
Rym: So some genius entrepreneurs said, you know what?

662
00:38:24,007 --> 00:38:33,120
Rym: Much like the Honda Civic, we should start marketing certain kinds of cases to the people who want all that and make it easy for them to show off their bling.

663
00:38:33,401 --> 00:38:35,790
Rym: So they started coming with all these tubes in them.

664
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,442
Rym: In fact, Scott's current case has blue lights on the inside.

665
00:38:39,603 --> 00:38:43,517
Scott: Yeah, it has a blue light and it has a clear window in the side.

666
00:38:43,898 --> 00:38:46,168
Scott: My next case probably will not have those things.

667
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:46,690
Rym: Good.

668
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:49,416
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.

669
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:55,158
Rym: Yeah, well, the case I'm getting now is the Antec P180 silver cold rolled steel thing.

670
00:38:55,198 --> 00:38:57,585
Rym: weighs a fuck ton, but it's plain.

671
00:38:57,665 --> 00:38:58,187
Rym: It's steel.

672
00:38:58,468 --> 00:39:02,882
Rym: It looks sturdy and it's got the power supply in the bottom instead of on top.

673
00:39:03,223 --> 00:39:04,146
Rym: It's kind of weird.

674
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:05,451
Rym: A lot of people like that.

675
00:39:05,492 --> 00:39:08,410
Rym: I'm not sure if it's going to be good, but I'm going to roll with the only problem with it.

676
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,215
Scott: It's obviously a better position.

677
00:39:10,777 --> 00:39:17,621
Scott: The only problem I can see is if the wires from the power supply can reach the rest of the computer from the bottom.

678
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:17,942
Rym: Yep.

679
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:21,717
Rym: Luckily, I bought an Antec power supply that I'm pretty sure will reach.

680
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:25,994
Rym: And I see more people saying good things about the case than bad things.

681
00:39:26,335 --> 00:39:28,705
Scott: So it definitely looks like a quality case.

682
00:39:29,026 --> 00:39:29,227
Rym: Yeah.

683
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:35,856
Rym: And the thing is, it's not super blingy because I really don't want to waste my precious wattages with lights and fancy bullshit.

684
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:43,152
Scott: Yeah, well, the window on the case actually has a useful function that if there's something going on in the computer, I don't have to open it up to find out what the deal is.

685
00:39:43,232 --> 00:39:46,812
Rym: I remember when I think your Northbridge fan stopped spinning and you never would have known that.

686
00:39:47,294 --> 00:39:47,515
Scott: Yep.

687
00:39:47,816 --> 00:39:50,547
Scott: But then I looked and, oh, look, my fan stopped spinning.

688
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:51,169
Scott: That's no good.

689
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:53,755
Scott: The window's useful.

690
00:39:53,775 --> 00:39:55,021
Scott: The light, not so useful.

691
00:39:55,061 --> 00:40:01,043
Rym: Well, even though most modern motherboards, you can find out rather easily if a fan stops spinning in software.

692
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:01,967
Scott: Yeah.

693
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:04,498
Scott: But you have to have something set up to do that.

694
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:07,432
Scott: And, you know, it's not as easy as just looking with your eyeball.

695
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:08,475
Scott: Yeah.

696
00:40:09,037 --> 00:40:09,258
Scott: Yeah.

697
00:40:09,338 --> 00:40:11,746
Scott: Another important thing to note about cases is the material.

698
00:40:12,247 --> 00:40:15,257
Scott: All cases used to just be made out of steel and plastic.

699
00:40:15,779 --> 00:40:21,015
Scott: And that was okay for a time, but computers are heavy and really sucked.

700
00:40:21,677 --> 00:40:23,985
Scott: And it generally just sucked all around.

701
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:30,405
Rym: I remember going to my first LAN party and three of us crammed into my tiny little laser to drive to Southfield.

702
00:40:30,726 --> 00:40:36,906
Rym: So everyone except the driver sat with a monitor, a CRT, a gigantic CRT in their lap.

703
00:40:37,287 --> 00:40:40,399
Rym: And the computers, which were gigantic, barely fit in the trunk.

704
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,728
Rym: And my, my suspension could barely take it.

705
00:40:42,748 --> 00:40:43,652
Rym: And it totally sucked.

706
00:40:43,772 --> 00:40:43,993
Scott: Yep.

707
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:48,630
Scott: Now they decided they would make cases out of, you know, couldn't do just plastic.

708
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:52,386
Scott: The problem with just plastic is you can't ground your motherboard on plastic.

709
00:40:52,768 --> 00:40:56,262
Scott: It needs to be grounded so that the aforementioned static shocks do not happen.

710
00:40:56,684 --> 00:41:01,263
Scott: Your case must form some sort of cage to protect your computer from the electrical elements.

711
00:41:01,484 --> 00:41:03,392
Rym: Even though mine currently definitely does not.

712
00:41:03,452 --> 00:41:06,444
Scott: Yes, but a total plastic case does not work.

713
00:41:06,524 --> 00:41:10,518
Scott: So they need some sort of metal and thus the aluminum case or the aluminum.

714
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:10,779
Rym: Yep.

715
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:17,963
Scott: They make lots of aluminum cases now or aluminum alloys or various other metals, which are just as protective from the elements.

716
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:20,393
Scott: They look better sometimes and they're much lighter.

717
00:41:20,413 --> 00:41:22,764
Scott: So you can pick your computer up and move it around.

718
00:41:22,985 --> 00:41:23,186
Rym: Yep.

719
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:26,482
Rym: And also a lot of cases are LAN party ready now where they'll.

720
00:41:26,563 --> 00:41:31,505
Rym: not only will they be small and compact and ready to go and look really cool, but they usually have carrying cases.

721
00:41:31,565 --> 00:41:36,301
Rym: You can buy special or handles backpack things to carry them around with you.

722
00:41:36,482 --> 00:41:36,662
Rym: Yep.

723
00:41:37,966 --> 00:41:38,227
Scott: All right.

724
00:41:38,267 --> 00:41:43,749
Scott: So Rym, when you're looking for a case, how do you decide which case is good and which case is not so good?

725
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:50,459
Rym: Well, when I was young and inexperienced, I would get the biggest case I could afford that had the most possible places to put things.

726
00:41:50,901 --> 00:42:00,132
Rym: My current case has spots for two power supplies because I always thought that someday I'll fill this case with drives and I'll get another power supply just for them.

727
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:02,296
Rym: Yeah.

728
00:42:02,557 --> 00:42:02,817
Rym: Yeah.

729
00:42:02,857 --> 00:42:04,781
Scott: Technology will only ever need 460 K. Yeah.

730
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:11,621
Rym: Nowadays really to me, I want a case that's small.

731
00:42:11,641 --> 00:42:12,345
Rym: I want a mid tower.

732
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:15,017
Rym: I don't want some gigantic tower with a million things.

733
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,147
Scott: I've only ever bought mid towers, but yeah.

734
00:42:17,509 --> 00:42:17,630
Rym: Yeah.

735
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:24,938
Scott: Well, I've only ever bought full towers and actually like something smaller than a mid tower, but they just won't fit everything I want in there.

736
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:29,152
Rym: What I really want is ease of access and ease of installation.

737
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:34,234
Rym: I want a case where I can pull the hard drive cage out, fill it up with hard drives and put it back in.

738
00:42:34,394 --> 00:42:34,555
Rym: Yeah.

739
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:40,098
Rym: I want a case where all the fans and all the hard drives are mounted on rails with fricking rubber grommets.

740
00:42:40,399 --> 00:42:41,343
Rym: So I don't make noise.

741
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:46,983
Rym: One thing I hated always was whenever my hard drives spun up on any case until modern ones, they'd rattle.

742
00:42:47,003 --> 00:42:47,766
Rym: They'd make noise.

743
00:42:48,188 --> 00:42:53,892
Rym: Now all good cases, anything that moves is mounted on rubber so you don't get that vibration noise coming out.

744
00:42:54,214 --> 00:42:54,414
Rym: Yep.

745
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:55,157
Scott: Yeah.

746
00:42:55,218 --> 00:42:59,918
Scott: Generally, if you're building a computer, you want a case that makes building a computer, a pleasure.

747
00:42:59,938 --> 00:43:10,157
Scott: I mean, if you look at like a lot of old computers, you open those up, it basically sucked to build the computer with that case because it was hard to get drives in there.

748
00:43:10,177 --> 00:43:13,710
Scott: Uh, screws didn't fit holes weren't in the right places.

749
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,689
Scott: It was very difficult to get the motherboard into the case.

750
00:43:18,071 --> 00:43:19,680
Scott: You couldn't get the power supply in or out.

751
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:21,210
Scott: The power supply was part of the case.

752
00:43:21,771 --> 00:43:22,835
Scott: All sorts of terrible things.

753
00:43:23,176 --> 00:43:29,664
Scott: All the edges inside the case are very sharp and you'd cut yourself and you'd bleed and blood on the motherboard means a dead motherboard.

754
00:43:29,684 --> 00:43:30,086
Scott: Yep.

755
00:43:30,327 --> 00:43:30,869
Rym: Good God.

756
00:43:30,889 --> 00:43:32,254
Rym: I think we all learned that lesson.

757
00:43:32,314 --> 00:43:32,595
Rym: Yeah.

758
00:43:32,956 --> 00:43:41,522
Scott: So you want a case that has nice, sturdy, well measured parts that are easy to access, easy to get to, easy to work with.

759
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:44,592
Scott: Lots of tool-less entry that just works.

760
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:54,234
Scott: You don't want flimsy crap, but you know, you want something that's like, all right, this is going to let me install the motherboard by sliding out a tray, put the motherboard in the tray, all nice and easy.

761
00:43:54,535 --> 00:43:58,489
Scott: Slide the tray back in nice and easy to add cards to the computer.

762
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,895
Scott: Just one screw in and out.

763
00:44:00,276 --> 00:44:00,578
Scott: Yep.

764
00:44:00,678 --> 00:44:02,465
Scott: Slide the drives in on little rails.

765
00:44:02,646 --> 00:44:03,650
Scott: Easy to take them in and out.

766
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:10,056
Scott: Don't have to sit there like unscrewing a drive then pulling on it for like 10 minutes trying to get it out of there.

767
00:44:10,196 --> 00:44:19,470
Rym: In fact, in my current computer case, there is not one, but two dead hard drives that I would basically have to take the entire case apart to get out.

768
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,095
Rym: So I just left them in there.

769
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:21,878
Rym: Wow.

770
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:22,400
Scott: Yeah.

771
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:25,130
Rym: And I have two other hard drives stacked on top of them.

772
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:25,732
Rym: Yep.

773
00:44:25,752 --> 00:44:27,380
Scott: Another thing I look for is quietness.

774
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:34,512
Scott: As Rym said, the rubber grommets on the moving parts help a lot, but the most important thing when getting a quiet computer is the fans themselves.

775
00:44:34,652 --> 00:44:40,190
Rym: Very simply, you want large, slow fans, much more than you want small, fast fans.

776
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:40,530
Scott: Yep.

777
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:41,253
Scott: I mean, think about it.

778
00:44:41,334 --> 00:44:46,072
Scott: A small, fast fan makes a lot of noise, has high RPMs to push a lot of air.

779
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:52,896
Scott: If you have a bigger fan, you can lower the RPM and lower the noise while still pushing the same quantity of air.

780
00:44:53,478 --> 00:44:55,365
Scott: So why would you ever use a smaller fan?

781
00:44:55,786 --> 00:45:02,592
Scott: Well, if you were stupid or your case was so small, it couldn't accommodate a small, a big fan, but that's a damn small case right there.

782
00:45:02,713 --> 00:45:05,384
Rym: Luckily, most modern cases take very large fans now.

783
00:45:05,445 --> 00:45:06,389
Rym: That seems to be the trend.

784
00:45:06,429 --> 00:45:08,117
Rym: Cases are getting better constantly.

785
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:12,415
Scott: The cases I look at now, even the cheap ones, like you can go out and get a $20 case now.

786
00:45:12,435 --> 00:45:14,002
Scott: That's actually pretty cool.

787
00:45:14,142 --> 00:45:15,548
Rym: It's better than my current case.

788
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:18,360
Rym: And my current case cost me $120 when I bought it.

789
00:45:18,501 --> 00:45:24,431
Scott: I still wouldn't buy the $20 cases now because they're probably made at a cheap plastic and they'll cut your arms up when you try to work with them.

790
00:45:24,551 --> 00:45:26,257
Rym: It's worth it to spend between $100 and $150 on a good case.

791
00:45:26,277 --> 00:45:33,626
Scott: If you're only going to build the computer once, I'd say it's only worth maybe $50 or $60.

792
00:45:33,626 --> 00:45:41,518
Scott: But if you're the kind of person who opens the case all the time to do all sorts of things, you definitely want to spend $100 or more to get a case that's easy to work with.

793
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:45,796
Rym: I don't know, it's worth the $50 even if I'm building it once and I don't plan to do much in it.

794
00:45:46,138 --> 00:45:52,361
Rym: To have a case that feels solid, looks good, I can get access to if I ever need to, and that's a pleasure to build.

795
00:45:52,381 --> 00:46:01,841
Rym: I hate having to route cables around under things and my video card doesn't fit because the fan's in the way, and the hard drives don't fit because the case was manufactured and engineered poorly.

796
00:46:01,861 --> 00:46:10,759
Scott: Yeah, that can piss you off, but if it's only going to piss you off once in your life, and it'll be over with soon, then I think you don't have to spend so much more money.

797
00:46:10,779 --> 00:46:14,113
Rym: Well, there's also the problem that cheap cases tend to just break.

798
00:46:14,535 --> 00:46:15,217
Scott: That is true.

799
00:46:15,237 --> 00:46:21,076
Scott: I mean, look, the case I have had a little cheap plastic flap in front of the front USB ports.

800
00:46:21,217 --> 00:46:22,561
Scott: That plastic flap is gone.

801
00:46:23,324 --> 00:46:24,247
Scott: It's totally gone.

802
00:46:24,307 --> 00:46:25,150
Scott: It's never coming back.

803
00:46:26,091 --> 00:46:26,755
Scott: Forget about it.

804
00:46:27,157 --> 00:46:39,043
Scott: And how many other cases have I seen that are made of some cheap- they have some, like, fancy plastic bezel in the front, and over time it just cracks and chips away into a million pieces or shatters or whatever because it's some cheap piece of crap.

805
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:44,626
Scott: or, you know, some metal on the inside gets bent and warps and now you can't get something out of there.

806
00:46:44,646 --> 00:46:46,955
Scott: It's, you know, cheap stuff is cheap stuff.

807
00:46:46,975 --> 00:46:47,818
Scott: You get what you pay for.

808
00:46:48,882 --> 00:46:56,316
Rym: Now, while it's very much related, and most people when they buy one, they buy the other at the same time, or you buy them in a set, but the power supply goes in the case.

809
00:46:56,738 --> 00:47:06,159
Rym: Not gonna really talk about the power supply because it's actually kind of complicated and difficult to give good advice when it comes to what kind of power supply- I don't even know what power supply to buy these days.

810
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,239
Rym: You know how long it took me to figure out how many watts I needed for my new computer?

811
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:11,062
Scott: Used to be easy.

812
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:12,387
Scott: Now, not so easy anymore.

813
00:47:12,588 --> 00:47:13,572
Rym: Yeah, it used to be real easy.

814
00:47:13,672 --> 00:47:23,971
Rym: Every computer took generally the same wattage, but now with the SLI and the many, many, many hard drives and, well, if you're using an AMD, the processor, not so much of an issue with Intel anymore.

815
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:32,557
Scott: Yeah, but it generally sucks to figure out what power supply you need, but generally, many cases will come with a power supply.

816
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,458
Scott: Some don't, and then you have to go buy your own, so it's just a common pairing that you'll see.

817
00:47:38,478 --> 00:47:40,345
Rym: Yeah, and definitely factor it in.

818
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:54,740
Scott: Yeah, when you're shopping for a case, make sure you check and see if the case comes with a power supply or not, because you might want it to, you might not want it to, but don't go buying a power supply you didn't want, and don't go buying an empty case and then not having a power supply.

819
00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:05,600
Rym: Yeah, especially if a power supply that would suit your needs plus some other case is 100 bucks, or the case you like is 100 bucks and you forget that now you got to drop another 100 bucks on a power supply.

820
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,251
Scott: Yep, yep, just something to watch out for, people.

821
00:48:08,612 --> 00:48:17,611
Rym: Yep, however, power supplies, much like cases, you get what you pay for, you're generally better off spending a little bit more money to get something that you can probably trust a little bit more.

822
00:48:17,752 --> 00:48:20,362
Scott: Yeah, but you're also got to be wary of a lot of scam.

823
00:48:20,403 --> 00:48:25,646
Scott: power supplies where they say a whole bunch of marketing speak and the power supply is really not any better than the other one.

824
00:48:25,867 --> 00:48:29,538
Rym: A little hint, you don't need a 900 watt power supply yet.

825
00:48:29,558 --> 00:48:31,483
Scott: That's pretty much guaranteed.

826
00:48:32,165 --> 00:48:39,270
Scott: All right, so I should inform everyone about the trials and tribulations of computer chassis and cases.

827
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:50,361
Rym: We should probably do a show in the future on all the actual tricks of, you know, how to get jumpers into the right places, not so much on the motherboard, but when you're putting a computer together, or how to route cables properly.

828
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:59,997
Scott: Yep, so now you should know if you're thinking about building a computer or whatever, how to buy a case that will suit your needs and how to not buy some piece of junk that will make your life miserable.

829
00:49:00,098 --> 00:49:04,216
Rym: Basically, just look on Newegg, look at cases, find one that looks good.

830
00:49:04,437 --> 00:49:05,944
Rym: Look at the pictures of the inside.

831
00:49:06,004 --> 00:49:08,978
Rym: Don't read the specs other than making sure it has the number of things you need.

832
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,986
Rym: Look at the case itself.

833
00:49:11,006 --> 00:49:11,850
Rym: Look at pictures of it.

834
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:13,396
Rym: Does it look like it's easy to take apart?

835
00:49:13,698 --> 00:49:15,445
Rym: Does it look like the cages come out?

836
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:16,530
Rym: Look at the reviews.

837
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,817
Rym: People who have problems will tell you they have problems.

838
00:49:18,877 --> 00:49:19,941
Rym: Believe me, they will.

839
00:49:19,961 --> 00:49:25,483
Scott: Yep, so computer case, perhaps one of the most important parts of the computer.

840
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:27,330
Rym: And get off in the most overlooked piece.

841
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:27,791
Rym: Yep.

842
00:49:34,076 --> 00:49:36,298
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

843
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:38,842
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

844
00:49:39,524 --> 00:49:50,876
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

845
00:49:51,318 --> 00:49:57,017
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

846
00:49:57,519 --> 00:49:59,146
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

847
00:49:59,186 --> 00:50:01,837
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

848
00:50:02,198 --> 00:50:07,600
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

849
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:16,186
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via audio.

850
00:50:16,487 --> 00:50:19,680
Scott: Just click the link that says "send me an audio" on the right side of our website.

851
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:25,183
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

852
00:50:25,424 --> 00:50:28,500
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website which has everything.

855
00:50:41,687 --> 00:50:45,940
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

856
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,500
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
