1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,388
Rym: It's Monday March 19th.

2
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:12,191
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:14,358
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:21,040
Rym: tonight We explain version control systems such as CVS and subversion in simple layman's non-technical terms.

5
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:28,226
Rym: Let's do this So Friday night.

6
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:30,095
Rym: Well actually Friday evening.

7
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:33,790
Rym: I was trying to leave work, and I noticed that a little bit of snow a little bit.

8
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:40,350
Scott: Yeah, I was in the city and there was some snow coming down, but it didn't look like anything that was gonna disturb my day.

9
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:42,450
Scott: You know it all melted as soon as hit the ground.

10
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:44,739
Scott: Not really any trouble.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,769
Rym: so as soon as I get to my car it turns into a blizzard And I basically had to drive home in a blizzard.

12
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:55,409
Rym: now I learned something interesting the taconic which is this road that for anyone who lives in New York you know about the taconic.

13
00:00:55,911 --> 00:01:02,140
Rym: Basically it was ground to a halt due to the fact that I don't know there were a million Accidents on it because everyone's stupid and it was snowing.

14
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:08,182
Scott: it seems like every time it snows That people forgot how to drive and snow the last time.

15
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:08,865
Scott: it's not like.

16
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:11,798
Scott: I go and I see this accident And there's some Florida plates there.

17
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:16,529
Scott: It's not like a going to see this accident, and it's teenagers It's middle-aged people from New York?

18
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:20,750
Scott: Did they not drive in snow last winter or a few weeks ago?

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,390
Rym: It seems like what most people react in one of two ways to there being snow on the ground.

20
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:34,969
Rym: They either drive as fast as they always drive Which is already too fast in most cases and end up crashing or they go one mile an hour and don't let me pass.

21
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:48,790
Rym: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, though Growing up in Michigan has a lot of benefits also having a car that Doesn't really look it, but it's actually pretty high off the ground and has a pretty good suspension in terms of dealing with snow.

22
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,090
Rym: So I decided to take the back roads.

23
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,990
Rym: I drove off through the mountains to get home on this little road that kind of hugs the Hudson River.

24
00:01:56,552 --> 00:01:57,898
Rym: There was maybe one other car on.

25
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,228
Rym: this whole road wasn't plowed, but you know what.

26
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:04,154
Rym: I got home Just fine because there wasn't anyone in my way Mm-hmm.

27
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:12,836
Scott: yeah, I was on the train of course on the way home And I didn't really look out the window cuz I was minding some business while I was on the train And I got off the train.

28
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:16,550
Scott: it was a lot more snow and beacon than there was in New York City.

29
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:23,110
Rym: Now I submit to you that the beacon train station is kind of low and all of the roads out of it go uphill.

30
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:26,090
Scott: Well, I mean it's the train station is on the Hudson River.

31
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:33,146
Scott: Yeah, if the town was lower than the river that would be trouble I imagine you know with flooding and such.

32
00:02:33,548 --> 00:02:35,798
Scott: so yes The it basically from the river.

33
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:48,107
Scott: then there's the train station at the same level as the river and then it only goes uphill from there pretty steeply in fact and Basically they didn't plow the parking lot and they were considering that it was still snowing heavily.

34
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:54,830
Scott: there really was many I and it had already snowed a lot though And they didn't plow the roads going out of the train station.

35
00:02:55,392 --> 00:03:03,361
Scott: So like me and my car along with I'd say five or six other cars We're unable to make it out of the train station.

36
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:03,562
Scott: Well.

37
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,670
Scott: I did make it out of the train station.

38
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:13,021
Scott: I didn't make it up the hill like I made it about halfway up the hill And then the incline at that point was just like the limit.

39
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:13,623
Rym: now.

40
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:15,510
Scott: Here's the point which I couldn't go up.

41
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:19,070
Rym: Here's the point at which I want to jump in because I know which road that is that road goes.

42
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:26,229
Rym: You know you can turn right and it seems to go off nowhere You can turn left, and it goes up to Main Street in 90 and all that you could have turned right.

43
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:29,287
Scott: no Yeah, I'm smarter than that.

44
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,075
Scott: all right I was thinking cuz you know there's a long line of people going left And I thought I'm gonna go right.

45
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:46,068
Scott: because yeah when I got up to that part where you choose between going left and right There was a little accident over to the right and some emergency vehicles, and they weren't letting anyone go that way.

46
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:51,610
Scott: Wow All right, and then so I go left, and I'm in this long line of cars going left.

47
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:55,230
Scott: I probably could have made it up that hill if I was all alone.

48
00:03:55,611 --> 00:04:01,060
Scott: You know just I had just like I got some speed when the incline wasn't there And then I rolled up the rest of the hill.

49
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:07,810
Scott: you know with my existing speed I could have done that But you know it was a long line of cars basically creep creep creep creep.

50
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:15,390
Scott: And if I stopped and tried to like leave a space in front of me No all the cars would come and pass me on the left and go over the WL line that no one could see.

51
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:17,743
Rym: Hate to say it that but that probably would have been me.

52
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:18,909
Rym: it seems like cuz I've seen.

53
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:20,380
Rym: oh Yeah, it seems like Mazda 3s.

54
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,266
Rym: Just don't handle snow.

55
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:22,674
Scott: very well I think it's cuz.

56
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:24,441
Scott: my tires are shot from driving in the middle of.

57
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:25,827
Rym: no tires aren't that bad.

58
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:26,530
Scott: They're pretty bad.

59
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,497
Rym: I took a look at it.

60
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,050
Scott: You know how to tell if tires are bad.

61
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,694
Rym: Yeah There's little wear indicators.

62
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:36,437
Scott: you take a penny and you put it in the groove and if you can't cover half the penny Then you need new time.

63
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:36,698
Scott: well the

64
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:48,804
Rym: actual way you tell is that they're wearing wear things and you look in the tread and if the tread is worn down to the point where it's level with the indicator then your car is now at the minimum tread level if not below it and you have to get them replaced.

65
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:49,586
Scott: mmm-hmm.

66
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:54,037
Rym: now if Your tires are just worn on the edges Then it's usually not that big of a deal.

67
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:55,604
Scott: now my tires are.

68
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:57,070
Scott: I'm gonna need new ones pretty soon.

69
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,697
Rym: You shouldn't need tires that often.

70
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:58,979
Scott: No.

71
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:01,190
Scott: I think they were shitty tires, and I think I drove them.

72
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:03,622
Rym: Oh, you mean the tires that the car came with the brand new car.

73
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:09,644
Rym: Yep that one uh-huh That's an interesting hypothesis, and I can't wait to see how well this all pans out.

74
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:11,450
Scott: I'm just gonna get new tires.

75
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:21,781
Rym: Anyway so in the news There's been this lawsuit against internet archive org Which is a really cool website that kind of archives the internet.

76
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:30,403
Rym: so say you've got a website in 1997 they take a snapshot of it and then in 2007 there's another snapshot and there's snapshots all along the way.

77
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:31,408
Scott: that way you can you know.

78
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:31,990
Scott: see hey?

79
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,350
Scott: What did Google look like in?

80
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,672
Scott: 1999?

81
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:35,615
Scott: and you can go find out.

82
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:37,562
Scott: it's a really cool thing Google exist in.

83
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,790
Rym: I don't think I've always played around with this site.

84
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,573
Rym: I like going to it.

85
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:49,730
Rym: well a while ago this crazy lady sued them for Cashing her crazy website, and this has suddenly been in the media.

86
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:52,610
Rym: So I thought I'd talk about it as a little blurb or thing of the day.

87
00:05:52,630 --> 00:06:00,170
Rym: I wasn't really gonna do news about it But then I fell down the rabbit hole and there was far more to this than met the eye.

88
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:13,910
Rym: So this woman has this website now before we go any further because this woman seems to be suing everyone on the planet I would like to point out that everything I am about to say is hearsay that I read on other websites on the internet.

89
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:15,890
Rym: I am NOT asserting anything.

90
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:21,730
Rym: I am merely pointing out things that I have read on the internet that may or may not be true.

91
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:24,858
Rym: Uh-huh so with that disclaimer aside.

92
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:29,590
Rym: There is a woman named Suzanne shell and she has this crazy website.

93
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,241
Rym: I'm not really sure what it advocates because it's all over the place.

94
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:33,783
Rym: It's one of those.

95
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:36,090
Scott: It's pretty much just nuttiness.

96
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:48,190
Rym: Oh, you know those you know those kind of websites that have a million Semi-revolutionary quotes and a whole bunch of kind of rambling text and a bunch of like Neil Adams website and the time cube website.

97
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:55,275
Rym: Yeah Lots of red text and different font sizes and links and the text is all over the place and there's frames Business all over.

98
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:59,050
Rym: in fact this site even has a pop-up before you can even go to it.

99
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:01,153
Rym: I think it's some JavaScript thing I didn't really look.

100
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:06,475
Rym: that asks you if you agree to the terms of service to view the website But it doesn't show you the terms of service.

101
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:11,810
Rym: huh well it either advocates for or against child protective services.

102
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:13,387
Rym: I am not sure which.

103
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,910
Rym: Huh, it's generally nutty in my opinion.

104
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:20,562
Scott: I would agree with that opinion.

105
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:22,490
Scott: so I didn't even read anything on the site.

106
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,435
Scott: I just looked at it.

107
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:24,280
Scott: I said wow that's nutty.

108
00:07:24,703 --> 00:07:25,950
Rym: so at the bottom of this website.

109
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:29,146
Rym: There is a great amount of text and this tech.

110
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:29,890
Rym: you should go to the website.

111
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:38,090
Rym: It's pretty funny to look at but at the bottom There's all this text and this woman has this really warped idea of how the internet works.

112
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:48,426
Rym: And I'll copyright works and everything works and it goes so far as to talk about the $5,000 licensing fee for cashing or reproducing her site anywhere and how to buy a license to print it.

113
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:58,150
Rym: and She has this whole crazy rant about how she disabled right-clicking and Printing and all that stuff because people were ripping her off or using her website against other people.

114
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:04,994
Scott: This is like those people who say that if you go to a website and blocking ads you're stealing because looking at the ad is The price of admission.

115
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:06,520
Scott: guess what have you noticed that?

116
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:07,584
Scott: other websites?

117
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:09,110
Scott: Don't say that crazy shit.

118
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,295
Scott: Have you noticed other websites?

119
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:11,621
Scott: don't have these crazy agreements.

120
00:08:12,084 --> 00:08:13,370
Scott: You know as you're the odd one out.

121
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:14,737
Scott: Maybe you're not.

122
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:16,870
Scott: maybe you've never seen another website in your life.

123
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:26,430
Scott: if you don't want your shit to be printed or saved as or Used in other places on the internet don't put it on the internet.

124
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:33,153
Rym: I'm actually of the mind that anything that is lawfully published to the internet on a public web server should.

125
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:45,955
Rym: there should be some sort of safe harbor law saying that as long as it was published legally and in no violation of its own copyright or other copyrights then anyone has the right to copy and Disseminate that information with.

126
00:08:46,055 --> 00:08:48,643
Rym: I mean, obviously I agree with very easy to that.

127
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:51,030
Rym: at least cashing should be okay.

128
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:57,850
Scott: Cashing and content parsing I mean just someone visiting her website is caching it in their web browser.

129
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:00,070
Rym: Yeah, I'm not paying her five thousand dollars.

130
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,431
Rym: You know what.

131
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:08,037
Scott: I visited the site about five times since I read this bit and disabling right-clicking and printing with JavaScripts or whatever guess what doesn't work.

132
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:10,184
Scott: someone who's smart enough.

133
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:11,830
Scott: That's not gonna work on them.

134
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:13,521
Scott: I can still print it if I want your.

135
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,910
Scott: you know bullshit is not getting him.

136
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:26,090
Rym: I remember in the 90s when I first went to a where site and I was trying to download stuff And I right-clicked on something and this pop-up thing appeared and said hey You can't right-click you gotta pay to get access to blah blah blah blah.

137
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:32,394
Rym: And then I turned off JavaScript and then I right-clicked and I downloaded my wares That's right.

138
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:33,658
Rym: That was great.

139
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,790
Rym: So that that alone would have just been a crazy woman.

140
00:09:38,346 --> 00:10:00,447
Rym: well the internet picked up on this the lawsuit and all that and dig at a story and a bunch of other sites had stories and this woman started getting a lot of hits and A lot of hate mail and there was a lot of articles all over the place talking about how crazy she is And that pushed her over the edge And she it looks like she was even posting on dig defending herself as best.

141
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:04,750
Scott: this crazy woman came But she does what most crazy people do and they were react crazily.

142
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,670
Scott: It's sort of like where a troll is usually one guy who gets a whole bunch of people to go nuts.

143
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:18,870
Scott: It's sort of like the opposite where a whole bunch of people do a simultaneous Troll targeted at one person to make them go nuts and this lady went all around the internet going nuts.

144
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:22,230
Scott: We basically like it was like a little bear in a cave.

145
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,930
Scott: We poked it with a stick and ran away and everyone's sitting there watching to see what it's gonna do and they all laugh.

146
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,564
Rym: Hahaha, so now apparently she's suing a bunch of people.

147
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:32,090
Rym: I think she said she's gonna sue dig.

148
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,610
Rym: Apparently she wrote this crazy rant on her website, which I would just recommend you go read.

149
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:47,017
Rym: She's got a bunch of facts as to why she's mad and she's mad about all these iGeeks she calls and then she has a footnote Denoting that iGeek means internet geek.

150
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:50,586
Rym: and oh you internet geeks have your panties all in a twat.

151
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:51,870
Rym: about this blah blah blah.

152
00:10:52,211 --> 00:11:00,137
Rym: You just don't understand how the laws work and you guys want everything blah, but it's just it's so you're living in the year 1929.

153
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:01,183
Scott: get with the times.

154
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,230
Scott: we're gonna kick your ass.

155
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:11,641
Rym: If any of you can get through her site enough to tell me what her opinion is on Anything other than this whole dig business.

156
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:16,338
Rym: whatever what your stance actually is I Won't give you anything, but that'd be interesting.

157
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:18,668
Rym: now the rabbit hole gets deeper.

158
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:25,850
Rym: now This is all hearsay And I'm gonna start with the things that are more verifiable and go toward the things that might just be outright lies.

159
00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:39,045
Rym: Alright, so apparently in 2005 she demanded that the Internet Archive pay her like a hundred thousand dollars For archiving her website multiple times between 1999 and 2004.

160
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:46,553
Scott: all I got to say is we know it's craziness And there's no way it's gonna happen, but if she succeeds we are loaded Cha-ching.

161
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:54,139
Rym: well among other things she seems to think that spidering her website is impossible because of the safeguard She has but to even if it's not possible.

162
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,267
Rym: It should be illegal and you should have to pay.

163
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,608
Rym: obviously She's never heard of robots dot text.

164
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:10,147
Scott: Yeah, and if she has heard of robots dot text The only reason robots dot text works is because search engines decide that they are going to pay attention to it.

165
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:20,506
Scott: like Google respects Robot dot text if Google comes to your site, and they want to you know put it in the Google index They first look at robots dot text and they say hey does this person want to be in Google?

166
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:27,510
Scott: and if the robots dot text Says no Google is nice, and they won't put you in Google Yeah, which really only hurts you unless you're doing something shady.

167
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:33,630
Scott: Yep, if I wanted to make a search engine I could just make a search engine that doesn't give it two shits about robots That text and spider you anyway.

168
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:38,190
Scott: It's not a goddamn thing you could do about it besides making your website non-public.

169
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:47,437
Rym: Well the just the legal system seemed to agree with archive org and threw out almost all of her claims Summarily and without any consideration.

170
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:49,744
Scott: see did she not learn her lesson.

171
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:50,847
Scott: Why would you ever try?

172
00:12:50,947 --> 00:12:51,048
Rym: Oh?

173
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:51,409
Rym: Oh?

174
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,569
Rym: Oh?

175
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:53,075
Rym: Learning her lesson?

176
00:12:53,357 --> 00:13:02,881
Rym: well apparently now according to this in 2001 the Colorado Supreme Court charged her with unauthorized practice of law Uh-huh.

177
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:14,329
Rym: and in I think 2004 maybe 2005 she was cited in another court for contempt of court for ignoring the 2001 order and then apparently in 2006 this happened again.

178
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:18,201
Scott: I wonder what law she's practicing crazy law now.

179
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:29,830
Rym: I would have I believe that hearsay because on her website She has this crazy rant about unauthorized practice of law and how it's unconstitutional And morally wrong for there to be any restrictions on anyone practicing law.

180
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:32,337
Rym: Now I have feelings.

181
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:35,530
Scott: I got a slight agreement with that, but not much.

182
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,610
Scott: I mean you can't just have people running around being lawyers willy-nilly.

183
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:44,870
Rym: Yeah, I mean I agree with the right of anyone to defend themselves in court if they feel that that is what they should do.

184
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,769
Scott: But you cannot go for you know Representing someone else in court without proper training and skills.

185
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:53,425
Scott: now You could just be you could just suck.

186
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:54,170
Scott: really bad.

187
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,175
Scott: I mean if someone decides to represent themselves And they suck at it That's their own fault.

188
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:08,864
Scott: if someone chooses you to represent them in court And you suck at it Then it's sort of your fault And you shouldn't be allowed to take that fault unless you pass that bar thing.

189
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:24,330
Rym: well the problem with all that is just that When it comes to more mundane things like a renters agreement, or let's say Software licenses someone techno Technological who doesn't have a law degree or isn't a paralegal and where this all varies from state to state.

190
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:34,601
Rym: I don't think someone like me should be barred from giving advice on Software licenses provided that someone like me makes it clear not a lawyer.

191
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:35,102
Rym: Yep.

192
00:14:35,423 --> 00:14:36,526
Scott: I agree however.

193
00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:41,749
Rym: It seems like New York State is actually extremely down on that sort of thing.

194
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:45,586
Scott: See I think you should be able to give anyone advice on anything.

195
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:46,330
Scott: it's free speech.

196
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:49,601
Scott: You know if it's legal advice just like if it's doctor advice.

197
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:52,330
Scott: you say I'm not a doctor, but I recommend this medicine.

198
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:55,407
Scott: You know I'm not a lawyer, but I recommend this law.

199
00:14:55,427 --> 00:15:01,950
Rym: yep Well, I'd be great with a law that says how prominently you have to point out that you're not a lawyer How often you have to say it that sort of thing?

200
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,350
Rym: Maybe you should wear a big yellow star on your arm that says I'm not a lawyer whenever you're trying to pull that.

201
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:08,837
Rym: But I digress.

202
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:12,230
Rym: so this woman's obviously according to the internet a nutjob.

203
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,296
Scott: Hooray nutjobs.

204
00:15:14,818 --> 00:15:17,349
Rym: I'm not sure what else I could say about this other than that.

205
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,590
Rym: Here's the final bit and I saw this said in three different locations by apparently three different people.

206
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:35,090
Rym: They claim that this woman has ties to the Church of Scientology Well that explains her legal tactics and that her website is basically a trap in order to bring about lawsuits.

207
00:15:35,872 --> 00:15:37,076
Scott: That could be so also.

208
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:41,529
Rym: they also claim that the Church of Scientology did this with a number of front organizations throughout the years.

209
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:41,569
Rym: I?

210
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,341
Rym: Do not know if this is true or not.

211
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:50,228
Scott: it is entirely hearsay I find likely because it's very similar to the legal tactics of the Church of Scientology.

212
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:56,750
Rym: I Find internet references to it, and I'm just going to relay it all to you because I find it hilarious.

213
00:15:57,377 --> 00:16:01,469
Scott: It is quite hilarious Alright, so this is guy named.

214
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:05,323
Scott: I'm gonna say I actually can't pronounce this name right which I'm usually very good at.

215
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:07,410
Scott: it's Dilip koteta.

216
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:11,143
Scott: Uh-huh, I L I P K O T E CHA right?

217
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,167
Rym: what nationality is that?

218
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:13,050
Scott: I have no clue.

219
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:14,917
Scott: He looks like a nice guy though.

220
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:15,640
Scott: It's like an old.

221
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,420
Scott: He's looking old man looks kind of like my grandpa only thinner I can't really tell.

222
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:28,350
Scott: anyway He's a. he's basically a retired guy who used to work in the food manufacturing industry, but he's not retired anymore.

223
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:33,494
Scott: Now he runs a business in instant yogurt, it's Got.

224
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:34,522
Scott: it's called yo kit.

225
00:16:34,623 --> 00:16:34,845
Scott: Why?

226
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:42,650
Scott: ok it It's like an instant cup of yogurt that lasts for 12 months on the shelf And he's you know thinking about using it for all sorts.

227
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,649
Scott: He's gonna make a lot of money from this yogurt probably if I if it tastes good.

228
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:47,255
Scott: But that's not the news.

229
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:48,819
Scott: a guy making yogurt who gives a shit.

230
00:16:49,381 --> 00:17:01,278
Scott: the news is the way he made this yogurt is He basically had a patent Donated to him from a bigger company that had figured out instant yogurt And they weren't using the patent.

231
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:05,875
Scott: so they gave it to this small time entrepreneur guy And he took the patent and he went nuts.

232
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:10,609
Scott: and now he's got a successful yogurt business and trepanor and trepanor entrepreneur.

233
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:14,398
Rym: whatever People in the forums are gonna jump down your throat.

234
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,383
Rym: I figured I'd preempt it.

235
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:24,750
Scott: Yeah, okay, so Now there's this big movement cuz you know 90 to 95 percent of patents are just sitting there not doing anything.

236
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:26,990
Scott: You know no one's making any money off of them.

237
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:33,169
Scott: they're just patents that companies collect over time in case they want to sue someone or in case they need one.

238
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:44,605
Scott: and You know there's a bunch of groups of people who are trying to encourage these big companies with useless Unused patents to donate them to small businesses.

239
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:45,690
Rym: I think that's cool.

240
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:51,198
Scott: Well, here's the thing that bothers me about it, though This is sort of backwards when you think about it.

241
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:57,709
Scott: the point of the patent is that the small-time guy comes up with something And then he's protected from the big guys.

242
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:03,427
Scott: But now it's the small guy has to beg the big guys to let go of the idea.

243
00:18:03,487 --> 00:18:17,450
Scott: He came up with Already that they just happen to have a patent on because they have a million patents and he can't take you know make his money off his idea without you know a Donation a nice donation from the guy who's already got more money.

244
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:18,306
Scott: He knows what to do with.

245
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:27,997
Scott: The other thing is if you're a big company with a lot of unused patents And you're donating them to one guy so he can make money What the hell donate them to?

246
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:31,710
Scott: like the world just give them up, so we everyone can do stuff.

247
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:39,684
Rym: Maybe we need some sort of legislation that would Automatically release patents to the public domain if they're unused or under certain circumstance.

248
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,348
Scott: I would say unused for six months.

249
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:41,910
Scott: It's gone.

250
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:44,422
Scott: You know it's like you're not What?

251
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:44,930
Scott: well okay?

252
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,295
Scott: If you're not it's like.

253
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:50,090
Scott: you don't have to be you know making money off it right now if I patent some gizmo.

254
00:18:50,210 --> 00:19:00,650
Scott: You know and you know on the side I'm working on the gizmo as long as I'm still working on it You know, but if I forget about it for six months to a year that I'm done.

255
00:19:00,952 --> 00:19:01,898
Scott: You know it's like what the hell.

256
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:06,910
Scott: if you're not making money off that invention You just made then why do you have a patent on it?

257
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:15,598
Scott: You're just hurting everyone else by restricting everyone's freedom to invent and sell and make businesses around Whatever that thing crazy thing you patent it is.

258
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,245
Scott: we shouldn't have to beg you to give it up to one small guy Who now can do whatever that thing is without competition.

259
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:23,330
Rym: well a lot of companies?

260
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,959
Rym: Just keep patents around as kind of a defensive tactic.

261
00:19:26,301 --> 00:19:33,109
Rym: so if someone sues them for any sort of patent thing They can usually turn around and counter sue the other person for 10 or 15 other patent things.

262
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:35,139
Scott: yep There's a quote from an IBM guy.

263
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:37,088
Scott: of course cuz IBM is the king of patents.

264
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:39,880
Rym: God I mean, I'm still up for a patent at IBM.

265
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,723
Scott: Yeah, you're ready for this.

266
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:46,563
Scott: IBM Corp has more than 40,000 patents according to company spokesman Steve Malkovich.

267
00:19:46,864 --> 00:19:48,530
Rym: they pushed us to get patents every day.

268
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,221
Rym: It was like get a patent yet got anything you can patent.

269
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:52,767
Rym: fill out this form will patent it.

270
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:59,660
Scott: yep Rather than give away their idle patents the company keeps them But allows some groups to use this technology for free.

271
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:02,670
Scott: they believe the strategy helps generate new innovation and growth.

272
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,556
Scott: You don't help generate new innovation and growth.

273
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:09,010
Scott: stop fucking patenting everything so people could just do things well because that's a lie.

274
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,577
Rym: Obviously the real answer is we have weapons.

275
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:16,430
Rym: it basically patents in the modern corporate world are not actually patents in the old way.

276
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:20,292
Rym: They were effectively economic nuclear weapons Mmm.

277
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:25,308
Rym: Where if anyone tries to nuke you you've got so many that you just destroy them in turn.

278
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:33,850
Rym: yep And if two big companies get into a tiff I can imagine all Sorts of hilarity, and I look forward to that day with great enthusiasm.

279
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:38,886
Rym: Yeah, oh apparently Suzanne Schell is a chicken farmer according to the internet.

280
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:44,710
Scott: uh-huh yeah This whole patent situation just gets worse and worse all the time, and it's really not good.

281
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:53,208
Scott: I mean it says in the Constitution Patents are there to promote like people inventing and researching and trying new things.

282
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:58,490
Scott: now Patents are just hurting people from trying to invent new part of it's the patent.

283
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:06,112
Rym: They had a certain term how long they would last and now technology moves so fast by the time a patent falls out of its Term.

284
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:08,850
Rym: it's been obsolete for seven years already.

285
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:16,409
Scott: Not only that but it's way too easy to get them and the patent office is not so good at choosing Which ones to approve and which ones not to approve?

286
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,937
Scott: You know they pretty much let through all kinds of bullshit and don't let through good stuff.

287
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:29,270
Rym: things of the day.

288
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:35,930
Rym: I'm sure you all remember at least know about the 1984 ad from Apple computers back in the day.

289
00:21:36,472 --> 00:21:39,642
Rym: It's probably one of the most famous video advertisements ever.

290
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,308
Scott: yep it played during the 84 Super Bowl.

291
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:43,815
Scott: It was for Macintoshes, and it's.

292
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:51,679
Rym: I really like the the aesthetic of it because I generally dislike 1984 like societies I'm really not a fan of the ad like other people are like.

293
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:55,190
Scott: I recognize significance, but I don't enjoy watching it.

294
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,410
Scott: I don't think it's fun or entertaining at all.

295
00:21:57,571 --> 00:22:04,604
Rym: I like the ad except for the fact that it's advertising Apple and instead I don't care about what it's selling, but I ignore that in ads anyway.

296
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:05,106
Rym: I just like the.

297
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:06,070
Rym: I like the visuals.

298
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,936
Scott: Oh, it has nothing to do with what it's selling.

299
00:22:07,997 --> 00:22:15,277
Scott: even if the ad was for like you know Scott's like you know I I Still wouldn't like it.

300
00:22:15,297 --> 00:22:19,529
Rym: I just don't like it all right You're entitled to your incorrect opinion.

301
00:22:20,311 --> 00:22:20,994
Scott: Talking about.

302
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:27,248
Rym: well someone did something funny on the internet and actually NPR It's all politics did talk about this quite a bit.

303
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:38,629
Rym: Someone and no one knows who as yet unless this has changed in the last few hours Took that old ad and mashed it up with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and they also added an iPod to it.

304
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:43,805
Rym: It's very high quality, and it's basically an anti Hillary pro-obama ad.

305
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:45,310
Rym: that's pretty well done.

306
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:47,789
Rym: And the thing is that alone wouldn't be news.

307
00:22:48,273 --> 00:23:06,332
Rym: But the fact that it got all over the internet And then it got on CNN and it's not all the major new media and everyone's talking about it and NPR I saw politics went into great detail about how they think this is the beginning of a new era in political advertising with these kind of underground Unaffiliated.

308
00:23:06,412 --> 00:23:13,518
Rym: no one paid for them even if they violate laws or if they're really really negative or whatever Internet advertising.

309
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:19,990
Rym: if someone really likes a candidate It's their right freedom of speech to say whatever they want as long as they don't violate any laws.

310
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:34,470
Rym: So as a result we're gonna see a lot of advertising for candidates That doesn't hit the mainstream media And they're speculating that this presidential election in 2008 is gonna be decided by the internet as opposed to by the traditional media.

311
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:36,405
Scott: Eventually it's gonna be decided by the internet.

312
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:40,800
Scott: it Thing now a large portion of it will be and perhaps years.

313
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,464
Scott: well the whole thing will be.

314
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:43,687
Rym: we've seen the trend.

315
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:49,861
Rym: I mean Howard Dean's Popularity existed solely because of his grassroots hippie internet action.

316
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:53,874
Scott: that is correct and Obama is more internet action going on than anyone Ever seen got.

317
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,490
Rym: Obama does a podcast and he has a pretty good radio voice.

318
00:23:56,951 --> 00:23:58,918
Scott: Yeah, thing is I don't know how it's like.

319
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,110
Scott: there's limits on how much you can spend in advertising and such.

320
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:08,406
Scott: So I think a lot of people are gonna do internet advertising and pretend that they didn't pay for it.

321
00:24:08,426 --> 00:24:16,590
Rym: when they do obviously Especially I mean say you want to attack a candidate You don't want to be known as that candidate who attacks that other candidate.

322
00:24:17,052 --> 00:24:22,450
Rym: So what if some guy who happens to be a friend of some other guy who happens to be a gopher on your campaign?

323
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,820
Rym: Makes a flash video of two Republican senator.

324
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:33,389
Rym: Hopeful presidential candidates fellating each other And talking about how bad they are on whatever issue you're talking about.

325
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:38,727
Rym: There's nothing illegal about that because you can't prove the connection or that any money was traded.

326
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:43,179
Scott: Yeah, it's real Not looking too well for the campaign finance reforms.

327
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:46,670
Rym: I see I'm not so worried about campaign finance reform anymore.

328
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,568
Rym: I'm more worried about a lot of other issues.

329
00:24:48,891 --> 00:25:03,650
Scott: See is the thing though in the short term it's gonna be sucky because now these people who have a lot of money are gonna Be even more likely to win and the other people can be less likely to lose because these people will afford To put like big-ass fancy ads that are you know gonna be all over the internet and get a lot of them.

330
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,175
Scott: But at the same in a long run.

331
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:09,570
Scott: now if the internet is the decider I can make shit on the internet.

332
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:21,647
Scott: And now like I'd say maybe in like 12 to 16 years from now The small-time candidate can put just as many videos about him on the internet and he'll get known Without having to spend millions on TV ads.

333
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:38,152
Rym: yep You can also get away with a lot more on the internet for now Because the culture on the internet as opposed to the meatspace culture that isn't on the internet Seems to be in a general way a lot more liberal not necessarily leftist But liberal in a general Libertine sense

334
00:25:38,393 --> 00:25:41,522
Scott: and the word the way it was meant in say 1910.

335
00:25:41,522 --> 00:25:49,127
Rym: so as a result you can say things on the internet to Appeal to certain kinds of voters that the voters who this wouldn't appeal to would never know.

336
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:49,669
Rym: you've said it.

337
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:53,885
Scott: Yes, you can say things in places where you know other people won't see.

338
00:25:53,905 --> 00:26:00,270
Scott: like if you say something on TV Pretty much everyone who votes is gonna see it, but if you go to say except us yes.

339
00:26:00,573 --> 00:26:04,978
Scott: But if you go to like the GeekNights forums And you say I love computers, and then you go over to

340
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,265
Rym: the neo-luddite forums

341
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:16,277
Scott: the neo-luddite forums And you say man computers are terrible, and then you go to the pedophile forums And you say I'll let you guys slide.

342
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:22,384
Scott: then you go to the chat rooms where all the police are trying to catch pedophiles And you say I'm gonna catch all these bastards no one will ever know.

343
00:26:22,424 --> 00:26:23,629
Scott: you said all these things.

344
00:26:24,672 --> 00:26:26,459
Rym: For now yeah, but it's still.

345
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,323
Rym: it's a useful tool.

346
00:26:27,906 --> 00:26:28,830
Scott: yep alright.

347
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:36,430
Scott: So if you haven't been paying attention The latest hotness in the web 2.0 internets is this thing called Twitter.

348
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:38,144
Rym: I started listening to twit.

349
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:40,840
Rym: for some reason I don't know if I like it it.

350
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,830
Rym: just if I turn it on I end up listening to it.

351
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:48,909
Rym: Yep, that's that's pretty much it kind of kind of mesmerizing their voices cuz they have more expensive microphones than us.

352
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,435
Scott: yeah I listen to two twits today.

353
00:26:50,516 --> 00:26:52,765
Scott: anyway Twitter is the thing.

354
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:54,090
Scott: I'm gonna tell you what it is in a second.

355
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:57,519
Scott: Yeah, I didn't know what it was But it has nothing to do with to it other than the twit.

356
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,089
Rym: people use it and talk about it more than they show.

357
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,145
Scott: they Talked about it recently in one episode.

358
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:02,730
Scott: a lot anyway.

359
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:08,410
Scott: It is made by the people who made Odeo and the people who made Odeo printers giving up Odeo and doing Twitter now.

360
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:15,350
Rym: Oh, huh, so they made Odeo which didn't work and was basically useless and now they're making Twitter.

361
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:17,799
Scott: Well Twitter's sort of made and done.

362
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,023
Scott: There's really not much more.

363
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:19,626
Scott: It can do so.

364
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:20,770
Rym: then what are they doing?

365
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,065
Scott: Okay, Twitter is you ready for this.

366
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:24,789
Scott: This is really dumb.

367
00:27:25,735 --> 00:27:32,186
Scott: all you do is You can say a hundred and forty characters worth of text.

368
00:27:32,426 --> 00:27:35,313
Scott: that answers the question What are you doing?

369
00:27:35,793 --> 00:27:43,784
Scott: And you have a picture and you have a name and it also has a GPS coordinate and It says you know there are different ways to send.

370
00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:47,704
Scott: you can send it by SMS You can send it by instant message, or you can send it on the website.

371
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:48,629
Scott: That's it.

372
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:52,826
Scott: So let's say here's an example of Twitter usage already.

373
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:58,905
Scott: I wake up in the morning I pick up my cell phone, and I say I just woke up smiley, and I push the button.

374
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:01,539
Scott: now on my Twitter It says the time.

375
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:05,478
Scott: it says Beacon, New York And it says Scott you know it has exactly what I typed in.

376
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:07,724
Scott: I woke up hooray via SMS.

377
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:09,490
Scott: then I take a shower.

378
00:28:09,994 --> 00:28:11,022
Scott: I'm gonna take a shower.

379
00:28:11,063 --> 00:28:17,405
Scott: so I go over to my computer And I log into the website, and I say I'm gonna take a shower now, and it says on Twitter I'm gonna take a shower now.

380
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:34,844
Scott: Huh, and now anyone who befriends me on Twitter can see all these things that I'm saying about what I'm doing and Anyone that I befriend I can see what they're doing and I can have those things sent to me by SMS or instant message Or I can look at them on the web and some things are public.

381
00:28:34,865 --> 00:28:46,436
Scott: you can just go to Twitter Twi tter calm and look at what things people are saying and doing in different places around the world and how they're saying those Things via SMS or I am or whatever.

382
00:28:46,777 --> 00:28:51,710
Rym: so it's basically all the bad parts of myspace and LiveJournal without any of the good.

383
00:28:52,092 --> 00:28:55,616
Scott: It's sort of like not in a way message But like a here message.

384
00:28:55,636 --> 00:29:00,581
Scott: you have a constant here message that you just keep Changing only it just they keep adding on top.

385
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:01,304
Scott: all right.

386
00:29:01,384 --> 00:29:19,001
Rym: I'm gonna qualify everything I'm about to say about this by stating that the idea of having a Constantly updating feed of what you were doing that people you care about can look at or that you can reference later to see what You did at certain times is Interesting and I can see uses for that.

387
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:26,508
Rym: this implementation I would say borders on the silly, but that's like saying that Alaska borders on the chili.

388
00:29:26,528 --> 00:29:29,299
Scott: well Here's the thing is that that alone.

389
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,544
Scott: You know I could go for that.

390
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:31,890
Scott: You know if it's just what are you doing?

391
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:32,954
Scott: Here's the thing.

392
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:38,412
Scott: people have pretty much taken this now And it's just a giant worldwide IRC.

393
00:29:38,773 --> 00:29:49,382
Scott: people are friending thousands of people and being befriended by thousands of people and I see messages on here like here's one At Vincent Ferrari, what if the at is at you?

394
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:51,509
Scott: question mark Smiley somebody is?

395
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,760
Scott: Talking to someone else by posting a worldwide message.

396
00:29:55,901 --> 00:30:03,310
Scott: That's supposed to be what are you doing right now, but there's Specifically trying to say hey Vincent Ferrari look at this message.

397
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,545
Rym: It's for you see now that at least is a little interesting.

398
00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:10,136
Rym: It's kind of a global Stupid inane chat room.

399
00:30:10,557 --> 00:30:15,170
Scott: It's just a worldwide IRC that you can only say a hundred and forty characters at once.

400
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,750
Scott: That's that's the opposite.

401
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:18,317
Scott: It would be cool if it was what it said.

402
00:30:18,337 --> 00:30:21,050
Scott: it was gonna be but now it's just a worldwide IRS each.

403
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:31,342
Rym: Oh now while that is silly I I posit Scott who would have So little of a life that they would watch this?

404
00:30:31,684 --> 00:30:42,750
Rym: the twits who would have So little going on that they have the time to constantly type 140 or so characters of what they're doing into a website?

405
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:49,689
Scott: Who would have so little time in life that they can sit here watching this sending chat Messages to the whole world and chatting with the whole world?

406
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:53,064
Rym: You know that's a little bit better than the original usage in my opinion.

407
00:30:53,345 --> 00:30:54,249
Scott: I think that's worse.

408
00:30:54,772 --> 00:30:57,767
Scott: Why don't you just you make an IRC channel and everyone join?

409
00:30:58,008 --> 00:30:58,390
Scott: it's better.

410
00:30:58,853 --> 00:31:00,041
Rym: Who is the bigger loser though?

411
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:01,430
Rym: the person who tells the world?

412
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:07,189
Rym: Constantly when they masturbate and when they take showers or the guy who watches that and feels enriched by it?

413
00:31:07,912 --> 00:31:08,454
Scott: I don't know.

414
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:12,210
Scott: neither one is good, but anyway my thing of the day is not Twitter itself.

415
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:16,485
Scott: I just wanted to let you know what Twitter was because it's something you should probably make fun of.

416
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,796
Scott: make fun of because it's the Latest internet hotness.

417
00:31:18,997 --> 00:31:21,329
Rym: I have a solution to Twitter, but I'll get to that in a bit right.

418
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:24,558
Scott: well The latest my thing of the day is Twitter vision.

419
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:30,854
Scott: you can go to Twitter vision calm TWI TTR vision calm or Twitter Map calm slash Twitter vision.

420
00:31:31,336 --> 00:31:32,940
Scott: it's Twitter plus Google Maps.

421
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:50,633
Scott: basically you sit here looking at Google Maps and Whenever someone twitters it puts a little dot on the map and you see what they said and then it loads up some more Twitter's and you get to sit here, and you'll see pretty much every Twitter around the world where it is what they said Constantly.

422
00:31:50,995 --> 00:31:54,629
Rym: so I've got like three or four ideas for Twitter pranks already.

423
00:31:55,292 --> 00:32:02,477
Scott: Apparently a lot of people using Twitter for marketing like it seems like in the UK somewhere There's a Twitter guy named fresh podcast.

424
00:32:02,517 --> 00:32:04,462
Scott: He just keeps linking to podcasts.

425
00:32:04,743 --> 00:32:07,229
Scott: Wow and I'm like who the hell is sitting here.

426
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:12,302
Scott: Wait watching what the this guy has to say to get a new podcast.

427
00:32:12,342 --> 00:32:14,488
Scott: go to take podcasts and search for something.

428
00:32:14,548 --> 00:32:15,130
Scott: what the hell?

429
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:17,054
Rym: No number one.

430
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:24,482
Rym: perhaps someone sets their GPS stuff to be in the middle of North Korea, and then they post something like OMG I got internet access.

431
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:29,141
Rym: help me And wait for the Internet to react to that - - - -.

432
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:31,490
Rym: what if someone posts OMG?

433
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:42,562
Rym: I saw a UFO and then silence or a bunch of people with the same GPS all post these UFO sightings all at once like in Montana and then silence from all of them forever more.

434
00:32:42,844 --> 00:32:45,751
Rym: so the conspiracy nuts have a field day Now.

435
00:32:46,294 --> 00:32:47,299
Rym: idea number three.

436
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:51,825
Rym: I have a feeling that military Engagements could end this right quick.

437
00:32:52,108 --> 00:32:57,830
Rym: suppose We get all the rational people on the internet together and deploy the mighty cock boat army on Twitter.

438
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:00,819
Scott: Just start putting cock boats in there.

439
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,610
Scott: cock boat 140 character long cock boats.

440
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:06,619
Rym: I'm talking about entire cock boat destroyer groups.

441
00:33:07,261 --> 00:33:07,843
Scott: Oh, man.

442
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:10,090
Rym: now of course you would have to set your GPS coordinates.

443
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:12,430
Rym: So they were in fact in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean.

444
00:33:14,153 --> 00:33:17,825
Rym: Now if we coordinate this properly this could be utterly hilarious.

445
00:33:18,146 --> 00:33:20,889
Rym: if the internet is with me We will put something together.

446
00:33:21,553 --> 00:33:24,990
Scott: I think I might use the Twitter for just one day and then not use it again.

447
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:25,955
Rym: And then what review it?

448
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:28,249
Scott: no, but that way at least you know.

449
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:35,857
Scott: It's like it is an important part of internet history because this is probably gonna be something that you know comes And then dies sort of like Odeo did.

450
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:39,010
Rym: and then 20 years later people say do you remember Twitter?

451
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:41,470
Scott: And I'm like haha use that for one day instead of haha.

452
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:44,483
Scott: I remember some people use that but I don't really remember what it was like.

453
00:33:44,604 --> 00:33:47,135
Rym: we've already got a lot of things like that Though I mean Kingdom of Loathing.

454
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:47,457
Scott: Yep.

455
00:33:47,497 --> 00:33:47,678
Scott: Yep.

456
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:51,488
Scott: It's sort of like how it's worth it to make a myspace account Even if you don't really use it.

457
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:55,790
Scott: It's sort of like how it's worth it to poke around live journal once just to know what it is.

458
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:00,145
Scott: You know be on Facebook once and that's that's so I'll be on Twitter once.

459
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:01,590
Rym: that ought to be interesting.

460
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:02,634
Scott: It might be.

461
00:34:03,115 --> 00:34:07,310
Rym: you should keep a log of how many times you can't resist yours to just write an ASCII penis.

462
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:08,953
Scott: I don't know.

463
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:09,775
Rym: I have.

464
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:13,949
Rym: I will bet that that is going to be within the first two things you post on Twitter.

465
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,053
Scott: No, I imagine.

466
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:20,248
Scott: I'm just gonna basically type in what I'm doing for 24 hours whenever I do something new.

467
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,940
Scott: Wow That's what it's supposed to be.

468
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:24,109
Scott: So that's the way I'm gonna use it.

469
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:27,730
Rym: I just I don't see this being the best use of your time.

470
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:28,995
Scott: Well, I'm gonna try.

471
00:34:29,074 --> 00:34:32,810
Scott: I think what I can do is I'll try to do with SMS or I am so it doesn't take very long.

472
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,799
Scott: So tonight plus think about it.

473
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,744
Scott: I mean at one point.

474
00:34:35,764 --> 00:34:39,237
Scott: It's gonna be like I'm at work And like four hours later, I'm eating lunch.

475
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:40,621
Scott: I'm done eating lunch.

476
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:45,315
Scott: I'm back to work then four hours later I'm going home.

477
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:51,462
Rym: So tonight lately our how computers work series has been very popular among the listeners especially all the networking stuff.

478
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:57,445
Rym: and Also, we're very lazy and we haven't felt like talking about any technology topics lately.

479
00:34:57,806 --> 00:35:09,729
Scott: Yeah technology topics I mean while we know a lot about technology There's only so much you can say about a lot of things and sometimes we have to do some research if it's not something We've used in regular daily life.

480
00:35:10,183 --> 00:35:16,309
Rym: also we just generally are lazy and the fact that you guys seem to want these less technical how computers works as opposed to the.

481
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:21,323
Rym: Here are the frequency bands of 802 11 V channels kind of podcast.

482
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:23,610
Scott: Here's how Manchester encoding works.

483
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:31,596
Scott: All right Today we're gonna talk about something that you probably aren't familiar with But you should be.

484
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:35,029
Scott: we're going to talk about version control systems.

485
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:44,550
Rym: Now this is a topic that generally a lot of people think only applies to coders people who write well people even know What version control systems are in the first place?

486
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:48,380
Rym: but this is the kind of thing that you might not even realize.

487
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:55,696
Rym: you have this problem or you might have the problem and Not realize that there's a solution or you might not even Care.

488
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,004
Rym: yeah, you might not.

489
00:35:57,346 --> 00:36:05,384
Rym: but in general This is something that many people could be using to great effect to make their productivity and their lives Generally better and easier to manage.

490
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,823
Rym: Mm-hmm It is also something that is on slashdot.

491
00:36:08,863 --> 00:36:10,110
Rym: recently people were talking about.

492
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:16,670
Rym: I think that our Congress the United States Congress should be by law required to use something like this.

493
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:23,670
Rym: I agree, but anyway version control is actually something very very simple.

494
00:36:24,191 --> 00:36:30,630
Scott: Yes, basically you have some sort of information that one or more people is working on.

495
00:36:31,192 --> 00:36:33,763
Scott: However, this you know, let's pretend it's a document.

496
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:35,068
Scott: It's it's a word document.

497
00:36:35,148 --> 00:36:35,550
Scott: That's fine.

498
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,382
Rym: Yeah, we're writing a guide on how to cook a goat.

499
00:36:38,623 --> 00:36:40,370
Scott: All right a guide on how to cook a goat, right?

500
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:46,178
Scott: so I write up the guide on how to cook a goat and Now Rym wants to make some changes.

501
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:48,606
Scott: Yeah, obviously you're thinking about wiki's already.

502
00:36:48,626 --> 00:36:49,710
Scott: you people I know you are.

503
00:36:49,831 --> 00:37:03,030
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but you know Rym make some changes to it and then I make some changes and then Someone else make some changes and we keep updating and working on this guide to how to make a goat together or maybe just alone.

504
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:03,732
Scott: It doesn't matter.

505
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:08,730
Rym: Yep, but the thing is we're doing this by a traditional methods, you know, download the file edit it put it back up.

506
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:09,210
Scott: Yeah.

507
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:15,830
Scott: And now if someone Rym does that what if you're accidentally erased one of my paragraphs or he changed something?

508
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,509
Scott: I did and I forget just how I said it.

509
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:29,790
Scott: Well the old versions unless we you know We could just keep a whole bunch of files and every time there's a new version of the document We make a whole new file and we've got all these files just lined up.

510
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:37,470
Scott: And now if I want to see what the difference is between version the newest version and the oldest version It's like a pain in the ass.

511
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:48,470
Scott: And if I want to replace a part of the new version with a part of two versions ago It's also a pain in the ass and it basically is a pain in the ass and a lot of manual labor and it sucks.

512
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:58,474
Rym: and also it doesn't deal with a very Maybe not obvious problem, but a problem that comes up quite a bit whenever multiple people are working on any sort of project Especially in computers.

513
00:37:58,896 --> 00:38:03,130
Rym: It's kind of a race condition where the time that you start to edit something can matter.

514
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:07,375
Rym: Well, let's say I start I download it and start editing I start adding a paragraph and then

515
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:09,482
Scott: I downloaded it and I start deleting something

516
00:38:09,783 --> 00:38:18,060
Rym: and then I put my version up which has my New paragraph and then Scott puts his version up that doesn't have my new paragraph But it has the things he took out and now

517
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:18,503
Scott: rims.

518
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:19,630
Scott: work is gone.

519
00:38:19,992 --> 00:38:20,978
Rym: My work is gone.

520
00:38:21,058 --> 00:38:23,010
Rym: Scott's work hasn't taken mine into account.

521
00:38:23,311 --> 00:38:26,950
Rym: Maybe a third person was trying to edit but Scott didn't download the file.

522
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:29,241
Rym: He was working on the one on the server.

523
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:31,270
Rym: So the guy couldn't even write it back.

524
00:38:32,151 --> 00:38:33,736
Scott: Yeah, now we've lost information.

525
00:38:33,796 --> 00:38:34,538
Rym: Everything's chaotic.

526
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:35,099
Rym: Everything's done.

527
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:38,850
Scott: So the solution is to have a version control system.

528
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:49,225
Scott: You know how when you get software and software says it's version 1.0 or 1.1 or 2.3 or whatever Those numbers come from version control systems.

529
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:49,687
Scott: people didn't.

530
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:50,651
Scott: just you know make.

531
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:54,100
Scott: I mean everyone has a different system for how the numbers work.

532
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,590
Scott: like the Linux kernel does the numbers by.

533
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:07,374
Scott: you know 2.6 is the series and then like dot 25 is the 25th kernel and the 2.6 series and Ubuntu does it by the date?

534
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:17,564
Scott: So edgy is 610 because it came out on June, you know 10. or it was like No, it came out in October of 06. that's why it's a lot of programs.

535
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:19,230
Rym: just do the major-minor.

536
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,159
Rym: So version 1.0 is the first major release.

537
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,182
Rym: 1.1 is a minor update.

538
00:39:23,182 --> 00:39:23,985
Rym: 1.2 is another minor update.

539
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:27,865
Rym: 2.0 is the second major release.

540
00:39:27,886 --> 00:39:28,510
Rym: Yeah sort of thing.

541
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:33,610
Scott: Everyone uses a different system of numbering but those numberings come from the version control systems.

542
00:39:34,032 --> 00:39:41,745
Rym: Now there are a lot of ways to do this and we're really not going to go into technical depth But you might have heard of terms like CVS or subversion or RCS.

543
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:42,849
Scott: Those are pretty much the big three.

544
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:52,403
Rym: Yeah, and there's a lot of people do it manually partly because they might not know that there are content management systems out there That'll do this for them and version things for them or two.

545
00:39:52,463 --> 00:39:55,916
Rym: They might just not Understand that this is a good thing.

546
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:59,070
Rym: Maybe they're crazy Luddites and maybe they don't like CVS.

547
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:07,729
Scott: Well, some people use like the stuff that's built into Microsoft Office and Word But that stuff really sucks compared to what CVS and others already do.

548
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:11,784
Scott: Basically how these version control systems work is not too complicated.

549
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:20,449
Scott: you have some sort of Repository where all of the stuff that is being all the stuff everyone is working on sits there.

550
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,975
Rym: now This could be a database.

551
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:22,799
Rym: It could be a file.

552
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,450
Rym: It could be a directory with just all the version files in it.

553
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,836
Scott: It could be on your computer.

554
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:28,765
Scott: It could be on a server somewhere else.

555
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:29,870
Scott: It doesn't really matter.

556
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:32,480
Rym: It could be a safe deposit box in a bank.

557
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:32,801
Rym: Yep.

558
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:43,193
Scott: It's a place where all the information Sits about everything that has ever been done to the things you are working on from the oldest version to the newest version and It just sits there.

559
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:43,875
Scott: now.

560
00:40:44,136 --> 00:40:47,690
Scott: the way it works is when you want to work on something you check it out.

561
00:40:48,111 --> 00:40:52,186
Scott: So let's say there's a project me and Rym are working on say the latest episode of GeekNights.

562
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:53,210
Scott: It's in there.

563
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,475
Scott: It's in the repository.

564
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,041
Scott: the work that's already been done is in there.

565
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:57,687
Scott: I'm just sitting at a computer.

566
00:40:57,727 --> 00:40:58,450
Scott: That's brand new.

567
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:00,837
Scott: So I connect to the repository.

568
00:41:00,857 --> 00:41:03,405
Scott: However, you connect to it network hard drive, whatever.

569
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:04,308
Scott: I check it out.

570
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:10,770
Scott: now I've got the version of the work the newest one that was in the repository because I checked out the newest one.

571
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,919
Scott: I could have checked out an older one.

572
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:13,410
Scott: I start working on it.

573
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,337
Scott: I edit the copy that I checked out.

574
00:41:15,698 --> 00:41:16,220
Scott: now Rym.

575
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:17,786
Scott: he checks out and he's working on it.

576
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:20,679
Scott: now There are two other things I can do.

577
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:21,684
Scott: well major.

578
00:41:21,784 --> 00:41:24,577
Scott: there are lots of things you can do But the major ones are update.

579
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:29,137
Scott: update says alright, I've got what I've the work I've done it right in front of me.

580
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:39,990
Scott: go look on that repository And if there's anything newer there that was changed since I checked out Bring that down to me so I can incorporate it into what I've just done.

581
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:40,990
Scott: That's update.

582
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:47,430
Scott: The other thing you can do is commit which says take what I've got right here and put it in as the next version.

583
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:49,657
Scott: So check this out.

584
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,322
Scott: Rym starts working on it.

585
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:52,306
Scott: I start working on it.

586
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:53,630
Scott: Rym updates.

587
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,102
Scott: He sees that nothing happened as so he commits.

588
00:41:56,363 --> 00:41:57,749
Scott: now rims version is in there.

589
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:02,180
Scott: It's in the repository But I'm working on the previous version to what Rym is done.

590
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:10,910
Scott: before I commit my work right on top of rims work I update now rims changes that he just did come down and I look at what I've done and I look at what rims done.

591
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:17,363
Scott: I mix them together, which is real easy And then I commit and now our work isn't lost.

592
00:42:17,423 --> 00:42:24,870
Scott: it's in there and everything's cool plus I can go in and I can say all kinds of cool stuff like show me the difference between this version and the last version.

593
00:42:26,012 --> 00:42:30,070
Scott: Give me the older version because the new version sucks all kinds of cool stuff like that.

594
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:31,819
Scott: It's nice and easy and everything's awesome.

595
00:42:32,081 --> 00:42:32,161
Rym: Now.

596
00:42:32,202 --> 00:42:33,730
Rym: You can see how this is a great advantage.

597
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:45,110
Rym: I mean without version control you're eventually gonna have a mess and you're very much limited in the number of people who can be working on one project or the Number of people who can collaborate simultaneously.

598
00:42:45,692 --> 00:42:51,710
Scott: You're also much more likely to lose lots of data and have a pain in the ass time, especially if you're working on software.

599
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:58,774
Rym: Yep, now to with simple primitive version control the most primitive forms Generally just involved.

600
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:03,992
Rym: if I check a file out like before any of this or I just I'm using a file and someone else tries To edit it.

601
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:06,420
Rym: It says hey someone else is editing this.

602
00:43:06,742 --> 00:43:07,665
Rym: don't fuck with it.

603
00:43:07,846 --> 00:43:13,410
Rym: That's what RCS does Yep, and while that's not great at least you don't lose data anymore.

604
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:21,959
Rym: It slows down productivity because now if Scott's working I can't work and if I'm working Scott can't work But at the same time at least you're not gonna lose anything

605
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,010
Scott: and at least you can still keep track of different versions of something

606
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:31,030
Rym: Yep, which is very important because then you can track back who added what when you can figure out when problems appeared.

607
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:35,130
Rym: Maybe someone likes an old version and you want to incorporate that into a newer version.

608
00:43:35,731 --> 00:43:43,986
Rym: Maybe you want to split off and fork but we'll talk about that in a second Yep, and really in general you can just get a lot more done a lot more quickly.

609
00:43:44,047 --> 00:43:47,315
Rym: people can collaborate Simultaneously on single projects.

610
00:43:47,717 --> 00:43:54,969
Scott: you think about what it'd be like if say you were trying to write a book a big instruction manual For something and there were like a hundred people on the team.

611
00:43:55,391 --> 00:43:58,681
Scott: It's basically impossible without a version control system of some sort.

612
00:43:59,142 --> 00:44:00,527
Scott: It's as essential as the hammer.

613
00:44:00,828 --> 00:44:06,379
Scott: without this tool You couldn't hammer a goddamn nail But because of the tool we can do amazing things.

614
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,130
Rym: now to look at a very practical semi non technical application.

615
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:13,043
Rym: I said a bit before about the Congress of the United States.

616
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:30,740
Rym: for those of you who aren't American Which is a good number of you the way laws work in America basically boils down to the fact that very few of our elected representatives actually read any laws that they vote for or against Partly because there's so many laws Partly because the laws are long and all sorts of problems.

617
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:33,330
Rym: as a result a lot of AIDS end up doing the work.

618
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:41,551
Rym: It's not that difficult for someone to just change a law and not tell anyone and then no one will notice and they'll vote on It.

619
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:45,410
Rym: it happened recently pretty spectacularly actually.

620
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:52,912
Scott: Yeah, also lots of laws like a law will be like the funding of the something-something act of 2007.

621
00:44:52,912 --> 00:44:57,510
Scott: But when you look at the law like the beginning part of it might have something to do with funding the something-something.

622
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:01,464
Scott: But then after that it says oh and by the way give money to Rym.

623
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:05,403
Scott: Oh and by the way, you can't Build a school in Connecticut.

624
00:45:05,524 --> 00:45:11,971
Scott: Oh and by the way You can build a bridge in Alaska all in favor of the Springfield slash pervert act I.

625
00:45:14,955 --> 00:45:16,930
Rym: But yeah, so how would you deal with this?

626
00:45:17,191 --> 00:45:27,050
Rym: Well Congress has tried to deal with it in various ineffective ways Even though something like CVS or any sort of version control system would all but eliminate this problem.

627
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:33,470
Scott: Plus the other problem we have in the US government is we got these two branches of the legislative branch, you know two legislative branches

628
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:34,312
Rym: yeah, and

629
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:46,037
Scott: like the house will have one version of a bill and then the Senate will have a different version of the same bill and They vote on them separately and then they go to this conference committee Which mixes them together.

630
00:45:46,057 --> 00:45:56,308
Scott: it like if they pass both houses the two different laws Two different bills in both houses then they go to a conference committee and they mix them together to get the same one And then they vote on them again.

631
00:45:57,072 --> 00:46:00,062
Rym: It's really kind of silly and I just did.

632
00:46:00,262 --> 00:46:02,570
Rym: this is one of the things that bothers me in general about the world.

633
00:46:02,631 --> 00:46:04,309
Rym: Is that there are solutions?

634
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:22,870
Rym: relatively simple solutions to Long-standing problems with society culture technology everything and for various reasons the people who have Much to gain or actually in this case possibly much to lose A lot of their you know shortcuts and tricks and shenanigans.

635
00:46:23,713 --> 00:46:25,979
Rym: These solutions aren't adopted aren't even looked at.

636
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,249
Rym: the people who have the problems don't even understand that these solutions exist.

637
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:31,797
Scott: People don't understand technology.

638
00:46:31,817 --> 00:46:34,163
Scott: So any technology solutions, they're not even gonna.

639
00:46:34,644 --> 00:46:44,790
Scott: it's like there are people who like it's sort of like regular expressions like people will be editing some file and they'll need to like Find and replace something or they need to do something clever and you know what they'll do.

640
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:52,290
Scott: they'll copy and they'll go paste paste paste paste paste paste paste and then they'll edit every single line by hand and that they Won't even realize they'll be like that's just the way it's done.

641
00:46:52,330 --> 00:47:03,910
Rym: They won't even think if only there was a way that this could be done easier If there is a way if only there was some sort of machine that could do large numbers of menial calculations over and over again as fast as possible.

642
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:15,843
Scott: if Yeah, it's like people don't even know they have the problems to even think if like if there was a solution now There is there are solutions to problems that you have that you don't know you have.

643
00:47:16,184 --> 00:47:28,870
Rym: obviously the Congress example is Somewhat more complicated than we might have made it out to be but the fact remains that well one We've thought about this a lot and I could go into great detail as to the more specific ideas have I have regarding that.

644
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:37,724
Rym: Yep, but in general, I think the idea stands that there are problems that can be solved trivially by technology That are not solved by technology for no good reason.

645
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:42,942
Scott: Mm-hmm Alright, you want to talk about some specific version control type topic?

646
00:47:43,022 --> 00:47:49,945
Rym: Alright, well very I'd like to talk about forking because a lot Of people don't seem to know what forking means and it's kind of related or branching.

647
00:47:50,929 --> 00:47:51,772
Scott: Ah Hmm.

648
00:47:52,353 --> 00:47:58,070
Rym: Alright, so let's say I'm working on my how to cook a goat thing and Scott's working on it with me.

649
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:02,730
Rym: And we get to version 2.1 and everything's going fine and suddenly Scott says, you know what?

650
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:04,870
Rym: We're going about this all wrong.

651
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:14,227
Rym: you're supposed to cook goats on grills and we've been talking about cooking them in ovens and I'm done with this business and I'm Gonna write my own guide and I'm gonna take all the data we got and do my own thing.

652
00:48:14,247 --> 00:48:16,156
Rym: and I say, you know What screw your idea?

653
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:18,266
Rym: I'm sticking with what we've got now.

654
00:48:18,306 --> 00:48:19,070
Rym: We've got a problem.

655
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:24,150
Rym: We've got one document and two different philosophies as to where to go forward from here.

656
00:48:24,383 --> 00:48:28,246
Scott: No We could just keep making versions where we go back and forth and back and forth and back before.

657
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:29,190
Scott: that is silly.

658
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:30,273
Scott: That is very silly.

659
00:48:30,293 --> 00:48:31,797
Rym: that happens on Wikipedia often.

660
00:48:31,837 --> 00:48:33,642
Rym: luckily they're safeguards to stop that.

661
00:48:33,862 --> 00:48:34,344
Scott: luckily.

662
00:48:34,424 --> 00:48:36,269
Rym: Yes, luckily he died.

663
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:43,150
Scott: Forks or when you break off and you split it two ways or possibly more than two ways.

664
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,670
Scott: So now we've got the oven methodology fork and the grill methodology fork.

665
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:54,290
Scott: So I've started a whole new chain of updates going that way and Rym has started a whole new chain of updates going that way.

666
00:48:54,451 --> 00:48:58,830
Rym: It's kind of like evolution where two species break off from a common ancestor species.

667
00:48:59,693 --> 00:49:01,309
Scott: That's pretty much exactly what it's like.

668
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:15,393
Scott: Yeah and you'll often see people talking about forks when in open source projects like when x free 86. right They x free 86 was the x server that people used on Unix and Linux systems and to make the GUI show up And it's still what they use.

669
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:20,490
Scott: However, people used to use x free 86. now people use xorg.

670
00:49:20,952 --> 00:49:25,470
Scott: What happened was at a certain point the people who do x free 86?

671
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:30,649
Scott: Made some stupid changes to their license and they did some stuff that no one liked And people are very upset with them.

672
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:40,845
Scott: So they went to the previous version of x free 86 before the bullshit happened and they forked it and do a new thing Called x org which now you pretty much should be using.

673
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:45,026
Scott: you don't really want to be using No one's using x free 86 anymore, except people with old computers.

674
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:45,910
Scott: They can't be updated.

675
00:49:46,573 --> 00:49:50,620
Scott: but X free 86 continued along its merry stupid way.

676
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:51,222
Scott: At least I'm.

677
00:49:51,503 --> 00:49:52,828
Scott: I don't know is it still continuing.

678
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:53,570
Rym: I've never looked.

679
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:55,262
Scott: I don't even know if anyone's still working on it.

680
00:49:55,323 --> 00:49:56,270
Scott: That's how much it died.

681
00:49:56,691 --> 00:50:02,670
Scott: But the fork of x free 86 x org is going along quite nicely and it is the very awesome.

682
00:50:03,091 --> 00:50:07,325
Rym: So now if you ever wondered what people like us mean when we say hey blah blah blah.

683
00:50:07,345 --> 00:50:08,609
Rym: He forked the Linux kernel.

684
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:09,412
Rym: now That's that's it.

685
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:10,134
Rym: That's all it is.

686
00:50:10,214 --> 00:50:15,670
Rym: you fork off into two separate paths going in usually separate directions or at least different directions.

687
00:50:16,272 --> 00:50:16,432
Scott: Yep.

688
00:50:16,974 --> 00:50:18,177
Scott: Now here's a funny one.

689
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:22,550
Scott: There is a fork of CVS the concurrent very the.

690
00:50:23,272 --> 00:50:23,853
Scott: What's a CVS?

691
00:50:23,914 --> 00:50:26,501
Scott: it's like concurrent version system something like that.

692
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:28,988
Scott: I don't actually remember current version control system.

693
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:32,840
Rym: I'm not even sure It's one of those things that you use so often.

694
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,790
Rym: You never really care what the accurate current versioning system.

695
00:50:36,232 --> 00:50:38,423
Rym: Maybe we have the internet at our disposal.

696
00:50:38,624 --> 00:50:39,870
Scott: I know but I closed my laptop.

697
00:50:40,312 --> 00:50:48,130
Scott: Ah, but anyway, there's a fork of CVS itself Which is quite ironic called subversion and the main difference there.

698
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:56,290
Scott: There are a lot of differences and you know Basically, it's not like we just talked about where xorg was great and x free 86 sucked and everyone uses xorgs.

699
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:01,490
Scott: Now people still use CVS and people use subversion because they're both good in their own way.

700
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:06,687
Scott: That is different philosophies on versioning control concurrent versions system.

701
00:51:07,008 --> 00:51:07,550
Scott: I was close.

702
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:09,995
Scott: Anyway, the difference between.

703
00:51:10,055 --> 00:51:17,592
Scott: the main difference between CVS and subversion is that CVS has every single file in a repository Is separate.

704
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:25,212
Scott: so let's say I'm working on a book with Rym and we put each chapter in a separate document and I edit one Chapter.

705
00:51:25,432 --> 00:51:29,143
Scott: that you then with the first version was point one and I edit one chapter.

706
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:35,001
Scott: now that chapter is version point two And all the other chapters are still point one because they haven't been.

707
00:51:35,021 --> 00:51:36,245
Scott: they're still on their first version.

708
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:37,710
Scott: That's how CVS works.

709
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:44,397
Scott: so in CVS every single file is gonna have a current version and That's that's good for a lot of things.

710
00:51:44,598 --> 00:51:47,147
Scott: sometimes you want to have every different file have a different version.

711
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:51,286
Scott: in Subversion you have what is called atomic commits.

712
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:52,070
Scott: where?

713
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:56,170
Scott: Every single file goes with the same version.

714
00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:00,489
Scott: So let's say we're working on like we put the initial version of the book in there.

715
00:52:00,932 --> 00:52:03,105
Scott: Then I edit one chapter and I commit.

716
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:06,839
Scott: now Even if those other chapters aren't updated they got it.

717
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,747
Scott: the next version of the chapter is exactly that.

718
00:52:09,868 --> 00:52:10,670
Scott: it makes a new version.

719
00:52:10,831 --> 00:52:13,442
Scott: So point two there's a new version of the other chapters.

720
00:52:13,482 --> 00:52:15,130
Scott: They're just the same as the older version.

721
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:19,461
Scott: This is good for software for a lot of reasons.

722
00:52:19,742 --> 00:52:22,710
Scott: For example, I'm working on a software project, right?

723
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:25,969
Scott: I make some changes to one source file and another source file.

724
00:52:26,752 --> 00:52:32,470
Scott: If you don't have the right versions of every source file the program probably won't work, you know.

725
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:37,985
Scott: So, how do you know if you need like version 1.5 of this and 1.7 of that and 2.3 of that in order to make?

726
00:52:39,731 --> 00:52:40,096
Scott: It work.

727
00:52:40,421 --> 00:52:40,806
Rym: It's tough.

728
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:46,467
Rym: Yep Now you can't control the version numbers of external programs or external libraries or external sources.

729
00:52:46,487 --> 00:52:55,930
Rym: You happen to be using But at the same time you can at least control all the things that you were working on To be the same version to make it at least a little bit easier.

730
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:56,291
Rym: Yep,

731
00:52:56,492 --> 00:53:14,410
Scott: so with subversion if someone's doing software with subversion and you only commit when the software works You know that whatever version you check out of subversion You're gonna get something that probably works and not you know This version of that file and this version of that file in order to go to the previous version of the software.

732
00:53:14,832 --> 00:53:24,169
Scott: so for certain types of projects the atomic commits of subversion are pretty awesome and For certain other kinds of things the non atomic commits of CVS are awesome.

733
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:33,512
Scott: So you gotta you know choose which one you like sometimes depending on your philosophy Maybe choose the one that's better for whatever project you're working on Etc.

734
00:53:33,994 --> 00:53:35,097
Scott: now, here's something really cool.

735
00:53:35,118 --> 00:53:38,590
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's called a tinderbox, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

736
00:53:38,831 --> 00:53:40,862
Scott: And basically what a tinderbox does?

737
00:53:40,963 --> 00:53:42,250
Scott: it's a specific software tool.

738
00:53:42,734 --> 00:53:44,390
Scott: You have a version control system.

739
00:53:44,952 --> 00:53:52,198
Scott: the tinderbox will look at the latest version of the software in the version control system and Make sure that it works.

740
00:53:52,841 --> 00:53:54,330
Scott: sort of it'll run some tests on it.

741
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,414
Scott: You know, does it compile?

742
00:53:55,655 --> 00:53:57,864
Scott: does it run without core dumping whatever?

743
00:53:58,326 --> 00:54:04,464
Scott: and if it you know Breaks the software by committing say something with a syntax error the tinderbox will go.

744
00:54:04,484 --> 00:54:06,489
Scott: Oh fucks someone messed up.

745
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:08,637
Scott: So now you know that.

746
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:11,950
Scott: oh, you know who messed up because you can see who committed the change.

747
00:54:12,412 --> 00:54:13,797
Rym: You can see what version.

748
00:54:14,078 --> 00:54:16,830
Scott: you can go back to the previous version that you know that works.

749
00:54:17,292 --> 00:54:28,849
Scott: You can go and look at the difference between the broken version and the previous version You know is working and see where they screwed up and then you can get the tinderbox to turn green again And then people can get back to work because they know they won't screw it up.

750
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:39,809
Scott: Huh, and this helps you develop software not only with all the advantages of version control But keeping a working product the whole time and never, you know, totally screwing up all the code.

751
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:41,121
Scott: now You don't know where the problem is.

752
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:41,969
Scott: That's making it not go.

753
00:54:43,011 --> 00:54:43,171
Rym: now.

754
00:54:43,191 --> 00:54:56,910
Rym: just in general the best thing about something like CVS is that from my standpoint as a guy who would maintain the server but Has nothing to do with the code because I the code I write is dubious at best and usually relegated to the script category.

755
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:00,739
Rym: I'm an IT guy, but I've managed CVS servers.

756
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,290
Rym: It's so trivial to take care of a CVS server.

757
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:06,770
Scott: You just kind of turn it on and let people set the permission.

758
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:09,082
Rym: We got to turn it on until you get a back up the data.

759
00:55:09,383 --> 00:55:11,379
Scott: Oh backing up the so important Yeah, but that's it.

760
00:55:11,439 --> 00:55:12,189
Rym: That's all you got to do.

761
00:55:12,615 --> 00:55:14,976
Rym: I mean if it breaks It's not gonna break.

762
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:17,084
Rym: the server is gonna break before CVS is gonna break.

763
00:55:17,104 --> 00:55:18,470
Rym: CVS is pretty tried and true.

764
00:55:18,851 --> 00:55:26,151
Scott: It's real old and even subversion which is much newer than CVS is tried and true and you can totally trust it for whatever You're doing.

765
00:55:26,633 --> 00:55:30,084
Scott: there are other ones like git which is the one I think that I'm pretty sure.

766
00:55:30,124 --> 00:55:34,643
Scott: Linus Torvalds developed it when he stopped Using bitkeeper because bitkeeper did something weird.

767
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,150
Scott: There's a whole story about that.

768
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,922
Scott: You can go research it on the internet if you want.

769
00:55:38,023 --> 00:55:39,030
Rym: You probably don't care.

770
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:42,610
Rym: In fact, I'll bet that we've already gone into more technical depth than any of you care about.

771
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,050
Scott: There's not really much more to say that isn't technically deep.

772
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:49,550
Scott: Well here let's think of some interesting uses for version control systems that are out of the ordinary.

773
00:55:50,012 --> 00:55:50,494
Scott: I got one.

774
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:57,009
Scott: the one that I say is if you've got say my documents folder Put the whole thing in a version control system.

775
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,877
Scott: Then you got.

776
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:07,410
Scott: you got a backup because it's you know Hopefully on some other server somewhere and if you ever change any of your documents Well now you can go back and get old versions.

777
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:12,133
Scott: You can see what your my documents folder was like in 2003 or 2002.

778
00:56:12,133 --> 00:56:14,121
Scott: You can see what your my documents folder is like today.

779
00:56:14,141 --> 00:56:20,956
Scott: if you have Multiple computers and your version control system is on a server You can be at home.

780
00:56:21,498 --> 00:56:27,590
Scott: check out your my documents folder make some changes check them in Go to work check out your new my documents folder.

781
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:33,162
Scott: So it's sort of like your stuff is stored on a server But you can kind of mix and match the versions.

782
00:56:33,202 --> 00:56:35,130
Scott: work on something at home work at something at work.

783
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:35,491
Scott: I did.

784
00:56:35,531 --> 00:56:42,010
Rym: you could do that almost as easily with roaming profiles or remote home directory or all that sort of a lot.

785
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:46,283
Scott: I know a lot of scary people who put their whole home directories in CVS.

786
00:56:46,764 --> 00:56:47,186
Rym: Wow.

787
00:56:47,587 --> 00:56:55,640
Scott: I wouldn't recommend that I'll put my home directory on a separate hard drive mounted, but I put my Configuration files for my computer in CVS.

788
00:56:55,681 --> 00:56:57,507
Scott: that way you go to a new computer.

789
00:56:57,567 --> 00:56:59,176
Scott: you want to set it up Just like the one at home.

790
00:56:59,317 --> 00:57:00,605
Scott: Check out all the configuration files.

791
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:00,927
Scott: You're done.

792
00:57:00,947 --> 00:57:10,829
Rym: Yep I actually did that for a DNS DHCP server combo when I was an RIT working in labs because it was just BAM And I had it there exactly the way I wanted it.

793
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:20,310
Scott: Yeah, and then say one day one of your settings is bothering you so you change it on one machine Yep, then it's changed on all your other machines because you check out the same settings from the same repository.

794
00:57:20,952 --> 00:57:34,298
Rym: Also, I'd recommend anyone learning about computers do this sort of thing because even if you don't need the version control It's something you should know about and unlike a lot of other things that you should know about on the internet and with computers It's really easy to learn how to use CVS.

795
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:36,244
Rym: Like I'm not kidding.

796
00:57:36,264 --> 00:57:38,090
Scott: There's basically three commands.

797
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:45,327
Scott: There's a lot of advanced commands like the command to fork is a little complicated But the basic commands of check in check out update a real simple.

798
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:51,683
Rym: Yes I mean, we're not just saying this as two guys who are technologically proficient seriously Mm-hmm.

799
00:57:52,192 --> 00:57:58,790
Scott: The one last thing you're gonna want to learn CVS or subversion for is that there's a lot of open source software out there that you know.

800
00:57:58,971 --> 00:58:01,381
Scott: You want to get the newest newest newest version.

801
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:06,639
Scott: and of course the open source people, you know They have people around the world working on one piece of software.

802
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,461
Scott: Guess what?

803
00:58:07,522 --> 00:58:10,290
Scott: They keep all that source code in a CVS or subversion.

804
00:58:10,451 --> 00:58:12,609
Rym: Yep, I mean, let's say you're using redhead or whatever.

805
00:58:12,931 --> 00:58:20,800
Rym: You have to wait for the people doing the project or their friends to make your RPM file Which is probably a few little tiny versions behind.

806
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:21,904
Rym: maybe it comes out late.

807
00:58:22,225 --> 00:58:23,590
Rym: Maybe you need the newest version now.

808
00:58:23,952 --> 00:58:27,010
Scott: Maybe you want to try out, you know the version that people are working on.

809
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,190
Scott: Maybe you want to work on the newest version of an open source project.

810
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:35,849
Rym: You're probably gonna have to go into CVS to get it because they're not gonna make binaries of every little release just for you

811
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:51,251
Scott: yes, and you can also a lot of times get a much newer version of Software then is easily available By going through the slight trouble of checking out the absolute up-to-the-minute newest version of the source code from CVS and then compiling it Yourself,

812
00:58:51,332 --> 00:58:56,510
Rym: I mean even gen 2 which generally has very up-to-date sources in its update tree.

813
00:58:57,293 --> 00:59:00,909
Rym: There are times when there will be stuff you want that for whatever reason isn't in there.

814
00:59:01,573 --> 00:59:05,050
Rym: Even then granted many of you aren't even gonna ever use gen 2 so it doesn't matter.

815
00:59:05,451 --> 00:59:12,887
Rym: But CVS is usually the way to get the bleeding is bleeding ist edge of any given software Because people are working on it.

816
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:20,743
Scott: Like if a guy was working on something five minutes ago, and he submits his updates You can grab those and take advantage of those new feature.

817
00:59:20,763 --> 00:59:22,510
Scott: He just coded five minutes ago.

818
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:32,566
Rym: this is especially great when you've got new hardware or new something and Support for that new something is in the newest newest newest alpha alpha alpha stage of some program that you need.

819
00:59:33,308 --> 00:59:50,785
Scott: or say if You have a piece of software that you rely heavily on But it's still in super development or there's a lot of people working on it But it's not quite there yet like a lot of people will check out the newest versions of Firefox from CVS's or get the nightly builds and stuff like that.

820
00:59:50,826 --> 00:59:59,614
Scott: just to get you know The Firefox 3 features before Firefox 3 comes out even though it's sort of unstable and still being worked on you can get it It's there.

821
01:00:00,157 --> 01:00:02,610
Rym: so I suppose that's that even though it's not the night for it.

822
01:00:02,871 --> 01:00:09,650
Rym: I would like to point out that we have contests running both Wednesday night and Thursday night and the deadlines are Wednesday and Thursday.

823
01:00:10,415 --> 01:00:11,643
Rym: Oh, this is the final week.

824
01:00:11,804 --> 01:00:12,710
Rym: I'm gonna remind everyone.

825
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:21,450
Rym: I think I'll extend the deadline one day because one person on one of the contests said they had a good entry and they emailed Me personally, so I might accept a few late.

826
01:00:21,874 --> 01:00:23,630
Rym: But we've gotten some pretty good entries on both.

827
01:00:23,772 --> 01:00:25,128
Rym: So I'm not too worried here.

828
01:00:25,754 --> 01:00:31,507
Scott: And if you want to enter those you're gonna have to listen on Wednesday or Thursday because we're not gonna tell you what they are right now.

829
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:41,442
Rym: Oh knows This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

830
01:00:41,462 --> 01:00:43,590
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

831
01:00:44,293 --> 01:00:55,510
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com Where you'll find show notes links our awesome forum a link to our frapper map and links to all the RSS feeds.

832
01:00:56,071 --> 01:01:01,710
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

833
01:01:02,272 --> 01:01:03,919
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

834
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,442
Rym: Tuesdays.

835
01:01:04,482 --> 01:01:06,230
Rym: We have video games board games and RPGs.

836
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:12,350
Rym: Wednesdays are anime manga comic nights and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

837
01:01:12,811 --> 01:01:24,470
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to GeekNights at front row crew comm or you can send audio feedback via Audio, just click the link that says send me an audio on the right side of our website.

838
01:01:24,813 --> 01:01:25,721
Rym: If you like what you hear.

839
01:01:25,802 --> 01:01:29,980
Rym: you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

840
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,310
Rym: for the complete archives visit the website which has everything.

844
01:01:47,232 --> 01:01:50,741
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

845
01:01:51,142 --> 01:01:52,666
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

846
01:01:52,967 --> 01:01:54,270
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
