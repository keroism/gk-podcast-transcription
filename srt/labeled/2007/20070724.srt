1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:00,724
Rym: Warning!

2
00:00:00,945 --> 00:00:03,820
Rym: What you are about to hear is not a normal episode of GeekNights.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,980
Rym: In fact, it is probably as far from a normal episode of GeekNights as you'll ever hear.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,580
Scott: Well, I guess we could just go "pfft" and that would be it.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,640
Scott: And that would be as far from an episode of normal GeekNights as you would hear.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,540
Rym: Well, I guess there was the last year on the Thursday before Otakon the show we put up.

7
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:20,520
Scott: Oh shit, we have to make a show for that Thursday.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,140
Rym: No we don't, I'm thinking we shouldn't do anything.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,284
Rym: Well, you know what?

10
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:25,760
Rym: We're talking in the wrong tense because that already happened.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,119
Scott: It did already happen, yes.

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,939
Scott: This is Tuesday, July... 24th today.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,587
Rym: Wow, it's a week from now.

14
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:36,019
Rym: We're in the future podcasting back to you.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,763
Rym: That's kind of cool.

16
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:41,340
Rym: Actually, no, we're in the past podcasting to you in the future.

17
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:42,520
Scott: Even better.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,844
Rym: And then in the future, I guess we're... You know what?

19
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:46,631
Rym: It's complicated.

20
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:47,560
Rym: There's a paradox there.

21
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:57,680
Rym: Suffice to say, if you are a new listener, and I know a lot of you are, from all the things we did at Otakon, all the things we did at ConnectiCon, this is not a normal episode of GeekNights.

22
00:00:57,842 --> 00:00:59,220
Rym: This is what's called the GeekNights Special.

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,420
Rym: Special is a code word for Rym and Scott or out of town, dead, or too lazy to do a real show.

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,139
Scott: I guess we could be dead, but yeah.

25
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:08,960
Rym: We'll talk about that on Thursday.

26
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,729
Rym: You should...

27
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:16,900
Scott: You should listen to a normal episode of GeekNights before you judge whether you want to listen to our show or not.

28
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,700
Scott: I don't care if you listen or not, but just don't judge us by this throwaway episode effectively.

29
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:23,625
Rym: I care a little bit.

30
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:25,799
Rym: I'm kind of Mega Love maniacal.

31
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:26,637
Scott: Yeah.

32
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:28,660
Rym: I like people to listen to my voice.

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,360
Scott: I like people to listen, but you know, I just don't want them to judge based on the wrong thing.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,940
Rym: That is definitely true, because I'll tell the story, I think, also on Thursday about that.

35
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:39,962
Scott: Yeah.

36
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:44,040
Scott: So, today we're just going to talk for a few minutes about a random video game.

37
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,860
Scott: Rym picked the game.

38
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:45,582
Rym: Yeah.

39
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:48,880
Rym: Basically, we kept saying games until one of us picked a game that we both agreed on.

40
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:51,340
Rym: And the idea was, it's not a game that we could review.

41
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:52,978
Rym: We could do a whole show on it.

42
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:56,600
Rym: And at the same time, it bears talking about, and we needed something.

43
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:58,100
Rym: So, we're going to do a GeekNights Flash.

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,599
Rym: It's like under a special, even.

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,580
Rym: Tonight, we're going to review Burger Time for the Intellivision and the Nintendo and a million other systems.

46
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:06,961
Scott: Yeah.

47
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:08,318
Scott: So, Burger Time is about this cook.

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,379
Scott: And the cook, I guess he wants to make burgers.

49
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,280
Rym: This cook, the chef, lives in a world of giants.

50
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:21,160
Rym: So, he has to make giant burgers for giants to eat, but he's tiny and wears a French chef hat.

51
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:25,140
Scott: And he's being attacked by evil things, evil food ingredients.

52
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,240
Rym: The pickles and the French fries and that egg.

53
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:28,966
Rym: That fucking egg.

54
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:30,159
Rym: I hate that egg so much.

55
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:30,661
Scott: Yep.

56
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:31,933
Scott: And his only weapon is salt.

57
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,120
Rym: Or pepper, depending on the version of the game.

58
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,060
Scott: But salt pretty much ruins all the bad guys.

59
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,560
Scott: He just shakes that salt on them and they dry right up.

60
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,080
Rym: Yeah, for like 10 seconds and then they're fine again.

61
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:43,601
Rym: Yeah.

62
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:47,000
Scott: Well, you know, there's water everywhere from the moist, steamy burgers.

63
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:53,999
Rym: I just got to say, in terms of old games like that, this is one of the few games that really stood out as being awesome, even back then.

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,880
Scott: It was, you know, I think what it was is back then, so many games were just unplayable.

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,179
Scott: And this is a playable game that worked.

66
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,259
Scott: So, it already was like way above everything else.

67
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:08,300
Scott: And not only that, but in addition to being playable and working, it was fun.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,318
Scott: Until Donkey Kong, you know, this was pretty much it.

69
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,101
Rym: Plus, I remember as a kid, and this got interesting, that I never owned an Intellivision or an Intellivision 2.

70
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:18,820
Rym: But my grandma on my mom's side did.

71
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:23,580
Rym: And I'd always be excited when I went to her house, because she had the Intellivision.

72
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:24,578
Rym: I only had the Atari.

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,280
Rym: And the Intellivision, whether you guys liked it or not, a lot of people haven't played it.

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,576
Rym: Or they tried to play that GameCube crap version that just doesn't work at all, that I paid $1.99 for.

75
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:34,946
Rym: Yeah.

76
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,300
Rym: The actual Intellivision worked really well.

77
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:39,378
Scott: It worked okay.

78
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,408
Rym: It worked really well.

79
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,299
Rym: Have you ever used one?

80
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:42,117
Scott: Yeah, a couple times.

81
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,685
Rym: What, an Intellivision or an Intellivision 2?

82
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:45,016
Scott: I don't know.

83
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,320
Rym: Alright, well, I'll review the Intellivision someday.

84
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,620
Rym: But suffice to say, my grandma was real freakin' good at BurgerTime.

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,559
Rym: She was better than me for as long as I played against her.

86
00:03:56,422 --> 00:03:56,698
Scott: Awesome.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,020
Rym: And basically, you'd walk along the burgers, and you could track the guys in the burgers.

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,080
Rym: And there was rudimentary AI as the things would try to chase you around.

89
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:08,880
Rym: And it always felt like the egg was smarter than everyone else.

90
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,300
Rym: The egg was always the one who headed me off at the pass.

91
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,765
Scott: I think it just happened to be.

92
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:15,500
Scott: the placement of the egg was always in the annoying spot.

93
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:21,079
Scott: You know, the other guys were off to the side, or you could take some ladders and go around them and still get your burger together.

94
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,100
Scott: But the egg was always right there, like on the burger, or right in your way.

95
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,800
Scott: There was no other way to go, and that's why the egg sucked.

96
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,220
Rym: The other thing I just really remember about it was there was this kind of this exploration aspect.

97
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,240
Rym: Because as you got further into the game, different ingredients would start appearing.

98
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,447
Rym: And I'd always be like, "Whoa!

99
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,353
Rym: Check that thing out!

100
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:38,957
Rym: I'd never seen that

101
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:39,299
Rym: before.".

102
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:40,439
Scott: Yeah, what the hell is that?

103
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:42,420
Rym: Yeah, 'cause there's only so many things to put on a burger.

104
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,559
Scott: You don't know, it might be a bad guy, it might be a new power-up.

105
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:46,099
Scott: You know, of course there weren't any new power-ups.

106
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,869
Rym: No, they were all just ingredients.

107
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:49,740
Rym: It was pretty obvious what they were.

108
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,999
Scott: I know, but you know, sometimes you never know.

109
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:57,880
Scott: The thing is, I could- Especially in the- I mean, in some of the versions where the graphics are better, there was no question what they were.

110
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:04,560
Scott: But in some of the worst graphic versions, if you hadn't played a better version, you know, so you see something new, you might not know what it is.

111
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,978
Rym: Well, pretty much it was like, "Alright, that's obviously the bun, 'cause it's on the

112
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:08,300
Rym: bottom.".

113
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:09,559
Scott: The bun is always obvious.

114
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:17,840
Rym: But there's the red thing and the green thing, and then the brown thing, and then there's the whitish thing, and you don't know what that is, maybe it's an onion, but they're all just squares.

115
00:05:18,303 --> 00:05:18,394
Scott: Yep.

116
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,520
Rym: Or rectangles.

117
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,860
Scott: Yep, and you step on them and they fall down and they land on the burger, and eventually you put the top on that baby and you get some points.

118
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:34,660
Rym: And I think that's the end of that, because frankly, at this moment, we are probably either watching a movie or playing a game in a beach house in Wildwood.

119
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:44,340
Scott: Yeah, if you're a punk kid and you've never played BurgerTime, or if you're an old person who remembers BurgerTime, you haven't played it in a while, just go play some BurgerTime, 'cause it's still okay.

120
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:46,280
Scott: And eat a burger.
