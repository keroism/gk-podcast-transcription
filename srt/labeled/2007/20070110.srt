1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,189
Scott: It's Wednesday January 10th.

2
00:00:05,711 --> 00:00:08,279
Rym: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:13,040
Scott: tonight we review Initiality.

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:25,380
Scott: Let's do this Unless you've been living under a rock in the world of the interwebs.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,795
Scott: There is one thing which has been dominating the news since yesterday or yesterday.

6
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:34,433
Scott: Yeah yesterday and We're not talking about it today at all.

7
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:35,518
Scott: I'm not even gonna mention it.

8
00:00:36,122 --> 00:00:38,560
Rym: You mean that a fruit company.

9
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:42,640
Scott: It could be something having to do with that, but we're not gonna talk about it at all.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,453
Scott: They made that phone whatever that you already said.

11
00:00:45,473 --> 00:00:45,855
Scott: too much.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,382
Rym: I Something.

13
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:51,373
Scott: let's talk about anime or manga comics or whatever.

14
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:53,520
Rym: I think we're mostly gonna talk about anime today.

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,245
Scott: That's I have a feeling that we will talk a great deal about anime today.

16
00:01:05,437 --> 00:01:12,160
Rym: I mean if you couldn't gather from the Interesting opener we used up might be a little bit of a special episode.

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,977
Scott: Special isn't even begun to describe how awesome this episode will be and not special like the ballad boy down the street.

18
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:27,819
Scott: No Well, I guess depending on your point of view it could be special like that.

19
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,504
Scott: What are you talking about it?

20
00:01:29,544 --> 00:01:30,549
Scott: but in a good way?

21
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:32,035
Rym: Yeah, that kids a maven.

22
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:40,680
Rym: Yeah Anyway, I'm gonna jump right into the news here cuz there was actually a lot of anime news a lot of it.

23
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:47,416
Rym: Not gonna talk about any great detail because I don't really care and I think you know My sentiments exactly as to how I would feel about this news.

24
00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:54,960
Rym: For example Nana possibly Theoretically plans in quotes to air in the u.s.

25
00:01:55,462 --> 00:02:01,435
Scott: Well at the end of every Nana episode they have this girl I don't is she like the voice actor or something or I don't know what she is.

26
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:03,322
Rym: It's not as room Yeah and she.

27
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:08,460
Scott: she sits in Nana's room and she talks about the show and she tells you what like.

28
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:10,204
Scott: Oh the soundtrack is available.

29
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:10,746
Scott: go buy it.

30
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,012
Rym: She tells you what to buy and when.

31
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:16,602
Scott: yeah, and she's like, oh there's a new Nana DVD.

32
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:18,429
Scott: go buy it and stuff like that.

33
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:25,311
Scott: So at the end of one of the recent episodes episode 31 Yeah she said Nana is gonna be on TV in the US holy crap.

34
00:02:25,672 --> 00:02:30,319
Scott: and no US anime company or Cartoon Network or anyone has said anything about that.

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,126
Scott: So we'll wait and see.

36
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,856
Scott: and cuz you mean Japanese people wouldn't know if she was lying.

37
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:42,780
Rym: Yeah Maybe they mean by airing in America that they're going to broadcast it at high strength over the ocean.

38
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:44,492
Scott: That would be so awesome.

39
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:45,660
Scott: Oh my god.

40
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:48,448
Rym: Anyway, yeah, so one piece.

41
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,880
Rym: how many movies do you think one piece is made?

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,880
Scott: I know they've made too many.

43
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:59,780
Scott: Well, the thing I don't know is are the one-piece movies Are they summary movies of the TV series?

44
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:19,920
Scott: because if so That's actually a good thing because now you can get the whole TV series and just like you know a few hours instead of watching hundreds upon hundreds of episodes or reading volumes and volumes of manga if they're not summary movies if they're actually like at Important parts in the TV series you have to insert a movie because that part of the plot is so crazy.

45
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:24,520
Scott: And that's bad because now not only is a hundreds of episodes, but it's a fistful of movies, too.

46
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:26,226
Rym: I have a feeling I mean once.

47
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:27,852
Rym: obviously you can tell her ignorance.

48
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:30,100
Rym: Neither one of us have seen a single one of these movies.

49
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:38,740
Scott: yeah, I've watched four episodes of one piece in my life and I've read about ten volumes of manga and that's that's way too much as much as I'm gonna read.

50
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:45,400
Rym: But I imagine it's a lot like the Sailor Moon movies, which I've seen all of in that or the cowboy bebop movie.

51
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:46,228
Rym: They don't.

52
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:59,330
Rym: I mean they take place Theoretically at a point along the actual TV continuity and I guess you could consider them Canon, but nothing in them Affected the the actual plot in any way.

53
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,040
Rym: like you could take him or leave him basically standalone story.

54
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,097
Scott: Well, it's obviously one of those three things We don't know which because we don't know anything about one.

55
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:13,458
Rym: of course That was a spoiler for every Sailor Moon movie because if you watch them all Sailor Moon dies But yet somehow she's not dead by the end.

56
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:17,140
Scott: I guess it wouldn't be a movie without doing that.

57
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:25,800
Rym: I think Dave and Joel were bitching about that in the Sailor Moon our movie where every movie is like don't use the super Extra power to save the day you'll die.

58
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:30,559
Rym: She says but I have to for the sake of the world and then she just doesn't die for some reason.

59
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:32,178
Scott: Yeah, all right.

60
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:41,629
Rym: Yeah, Chevalier, which we've seen two episodes of and which my opinion of the first episode was a hundred percent awesome I opinion the second episode was 50% fail.

61
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:43,696
Rym: So it's still you know, right around to see.

62
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,496
Rym: a solid C is Coming to the anime network.

63
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,151
Rym: Regardless of whether or not it's a good show as far as I'm concerned I think Chevalier is gonna do real well in the US.

64
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:55,120
Rym: among the anime networks viewers.

65
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:59,200
Scott: It's definitely better than a lot of the other anime that came out this season.

66
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,460
Scott: So I think in this next round of upcoming shows is gonna be one of the top shows even though overall it might.

67
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:07,389
Scott: Who knows if it's a great show or not?

68
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,840
Scott: I think it's an average show even if it's not great.

69
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,559
Rym: I have a feeling that is gonna be fun.

70
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:14,700
Scott: Yeah, I don't think it's possible for that show to go into the realm of bad.

71
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:18,360
Scott: I think the worst it can be is average which is you know, if there's nothing else to watch.

72
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:18,722
Scott: I really

73
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:33,016
Rym: imagined myself getting the same enjoyment and the same type of enjoyment out of Chevalier That most people get out of say Fist of the North Star or giant robot shows, you know, it's bad You know, it's nothing to be proud of and yet you love every second of it.

74
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:34,482
Scott: I Don't know.

75
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:39,988
Scott: I put it on the same level as say Probably Gonkutsu or something like that.

76
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:40,570
Rym: I don't know.

77
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,920
Rym: I think Gonkutsu was probably a lot better than Chevalier.

78
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,040
Scott: I don't know.

79
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,119
Scott: I actually kind of like the first episode of Chevalier more than I like.

80
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:48,889
Scott: You know the Gonkutsu I've seen.

81
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:52,931
Rym: well, you haven't read the Count of Monte Cristo One of the greatest works ever written in French.

82
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:54,600
Scott: Yeah, cuz I don't got time for that shit.

83
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:57,040
Rym: You can't even knock that book off in like two weeks.

84
00:05:57,461 --> 00:06:02,460
Scott: Anyway, I knocked off a lensman book in three days and that provided crazy amounts of enjoyment.

85
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:11,822
Rym: Yeah, I don't really care about any of the rest of this other than a Bobobo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Season.

86
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:13,810
Scott: we seem to be the only people who can say that correctly.

87
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:15,196
Rym: I don't know how hard.

88
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:17,666
Scott: there's seven There's seven bows.

89
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,273
Scott: So you do four and then three.

90
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:20,839
Scott: Bobobo Bo Bo Bo Bo.

91
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,740
Rym: We showed that at our anime club back in Rochester when it first aired in Japan as soon as it was fansub.

92
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,202
Rym: You know what?

93
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:28,851
Rym: We said the name right.

94
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:30,440
Rym: even then how can people still be getting it?

95
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,145
Scott: How all these people like?

96
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:36,420
Scott: whenever they see the name on paper, they just go up Bobo Bobo, whatever it's called.

97
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:44,547
Scott: And I'm like, it's not that hard Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo, but I can't fail to say it properly Not difficult.

98
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,100
Rym: we did a tutorial before we showed it in the club.

99
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,699
Rym: We were like, it's Bobo Bobo pause Bobo Bo.

100
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:55,060
Rym: And we made everyone say it before we showed it to a guy who attacks with his nose hair.

101
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:56,165
Rym: God that show.

102
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:59,178
Scott: it's worth it to watch like one or two episodes for the like.

103
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,088
Scott: It's it's the wackiest of wacky comedies.

104
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:04,275
Rym: You gotta watch that show up to Don Pachi.

105
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:05,820
Rym: There's nothing left after that.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,442
Scott: That's about.

107
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:10,640
Scott: I think that's about right because Don Pachi shows up and it's funny because all we got is Don Pachi.

108
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:14,318
Scott: But then after that, I don't think it goes anywhere At least not from what I saw.

109
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:18,000
Rym: Yeah, so if you haven't gathered it, I'm just reading off the anime news network.

110
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,951
Rym: But the actual news we want to talk about is in Scott's round.

111
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:21,915
Rym: Yes.

112
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:22,959
Scott: I have the good news here.

113
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:26,813
Scott: So Viz who this doesn't really do DVDs?

114
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:27,135
Scott: do they?

115
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:28,540
Scott: they're mostly the manga, right?

116
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,585
Scott: I'm sure they do some anime.

117
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:34,539
Scott: But anyway, well, they definitely do anime because that's what this news says.

118
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:41,960
Scott: Viz has licensed the Death Note anime, right which is still on the air in Japan, which is kind of crazy.

119
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:52,791
Rym: Yeah, I mean usually the anime companies in Japan seem to have this deathly fear that someone in America will Resell the American cheap DVDs back to Japan's.

120
00:07:52,831 --> 00:08:02,600
Rym: they never let anything get licensed and released over here Until long after they've sold their $70 DVD even though if Japanese people really wanted to they could just bit torn the shows.

121
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:05,660
Scott: Yeah, it's like or wait or wait.

122
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:16,680
Scott: Anyway, they have licensed the Death Note anime because they already putting out the Death Note manga which they're almost done putting out and But they haven't licensed it in the usual fashion.

123
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:34,609
Scott: They have licensed the download to own and download to rent rights Which means pretty much that you're going to be able to download the Death Note anime I assume with a dub of some sort in the United States Legally with some DRM's.

124
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:37,600
Rym: if only it weren't the DRM's I'd be all about that.

125
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,557
Scott: You know, we always say hey, how come you don't bring this stuff over faster bla bla bla bla bla.

126
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:47,740
Scott: and Viz is like Hey, we're bringing it over when you want like, you know, and you seem to like digital.

127
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:49,440
Scott: So here we're bringing it to you digitally.

128
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:52,173
Scott: But the DRM is the one mistake.

129
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:59,139
Scott: people have a hard enough time Bit torrenting and getting their codecs to work now, you're gonna want him to put some DRM shit in there.

130
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:01,211
Scott: It's just not gonna happen.

131
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:13,269
Scott: You know, I mean while They might have an advantage in that this license is gonna make the fan subbing stop at least the you know Open easy to get at fan subbing stop.

132
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,020
Scott: So it might be easier to get the episodes from Viz.

133
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,720
Scott: it's The DRM is gonna stop a lot of people and their underground fan subbers are still gonna end up winning.

134
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:37,028
Rym: see now if they were somehow doing it with iTunes or in some sort of DRM that people are already accustomed to or Some sort of DRM that was widely used or a service maybe that offered a lot more than just this They'd probably do a lot better.

135
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:46,337
Rym: Yeah, probably but if it's just that like I could see myself installing some horrible DRM thing if there was enough good stuff On it and the price was right.

136
00:09:47,182 --> 00:09:47,544
Scott: I wouldn't.

137
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:48,328
Scott: but okay.

138
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:57,135
Rym: Well, like say there was a service where for ten cents you could get any anime that's ever been released in the u.s Keep forever for you.

139
00:09:57,155 --> 00:09:59,905
Rym: It's just DRM too little so you can't give it to other people.

140
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:01,390
Scott: Well, you know, it's kind of weird.

141
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,830
Scott: It's like if it's on my computer, right?

142
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,289
Scott: It's like I don't want to install DRM software on my computer because that feels like.

143
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:14,430
Scott: you know I have my computer can do this thing and you've taken you know, you're restricted my computer.

144
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,059
Rym: Oh, you mean like iTunes right which you have.

145
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,450
Scott: no iTunes only screws you if you buy stuff from iTunes.

146
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:23,823
Scott: It doesn't screw you if you just use it to handle regular old mp3s.

147
00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:24,144
Scott: true.

148
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:25,148
Rym: You haven't bought anything.

149
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:25,590
Scott: That's right.

150
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:39,455
Scott: But if they sold like, you know a set-top box or some sort of pay-per-view on your cable box or something like that That would totally fly because they're not really restricting anything You can't already do you know?

151
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:46,293
Scott: if they had like just push buttons on my cable remote and pay a dollar to watch Death Note That would be pretty hot I don't know.

152
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:58,442
Rym: regardless of whether or not we'll use the service or anyone we know will use the service I think this is definitely a step in the right direction and I I hope it's at least at least they've Recognized that they got to do something and they're making a move.

153
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:00,350
Scott: They just haven't made the final move.

154
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:04,649
Rym: Yeah, I mean it just comes down to somehow getting the licenses early on.

155
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:16,550
Rym: Like maybe I'd say wait a little bit to make sure that the show is popular in the US by keeping an eye on the fan Subs license the shit out of that stuff right away and have it come out right away.

156
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:22,187
Rym: And if the Japanese companies won't let you do whatever they just did to let the jet to get away with this.

157
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:29,370
Rym: Yeah Yeah, honestly, I'll bet the reason they're getting away with this is that the system will probably not allow people in Japan.

158
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:35,127
Scott: Yeah, probably either won't allow people in Japan or people in Japan will be.

159
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:37,737
Scott: you know, Drm didn't have to pay money.

160
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:43,790
Rym: So it's not like they're you know, re importing anything Yeah, but it'll still charge so much less than a DVD.

161
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:50,150
Scott: I mean if it costs plus even though it'll still be behind what's on TV in Japan right now.

162
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:51,138
Scott: You know, it's not gonna.

163
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:52,309
Scott: it's not like they're getting a DVD.

164
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,950
Scott: You know, it doesn't compete with the DVD to purchase in Japan.

165
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:04,280
Scott: it competes with the TV to watch in Japan and it can't beat that because in Japan the TV's got episode 10 and over here.

166
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:10,121
Scott: We've got episode 1. so it you know It's not stopping anyone from buying DVDs or watching TV in Japan.

167
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,329
Scott: Even if Japanese people can access it.

168
00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:24,129
Rym: Oh one last news before I get away from this whole news thing because I just noticed this and I actually read it and I realized That is something a lot of you'll probably care about even though it's barely related to anime.

169
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:28,201
Rym: Avatar apparently is going to have a number of live-action movies.

170
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:30,106
Scott: I don't think that's the.

171
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:31,530
Scott: is it the same avatar?

172
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,279
Scott: Yes, cuz I saw that very specifically.

173
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:37,270
Rym: This is avatar the Nicktoons cartoon.

174
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:40,930
Rym: This is not related to the other avatar movie.

175
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:46,590
Scott: Okay, cuz I saw some news today about an avatar movie, but that's where the confusion is.

176
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,890
Rym: There's a movie called avatar coming out from James Cameron.

177
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:58,050
Rym: independently of that Some guy got the rights to make a bunch of live-action avatar movies based on avatar the last airbender.

178
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:01,685
Rym: All right, we're gonna do a show on avatar once.

179
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:05,899
Rym: I've seen more of it But suffice to say I think that show is the top dog.

180
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,710
Scott: I haven't watched it and I remain skeptical.

181
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:18,589
Scott: things of the day.

182
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:24,055
Scott: My thing of the day is an animation, but it is not a Japanese Animation.

183
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:24,822
Rym: Oh, really?

184
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:25,610
Scott: Yeah, really?

185
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:31,670
Scott: I'm following your trend from earlier in the week going with some Warner Brothers animations.

186
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,237
Rym: Warner Brothers a yep.

187
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:35,882
Rym: It's either one of two things.

188
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:39,173
Rym: My guess is that it's the Famous.

189
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:40,799
Rym: I know he has done it.

190
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,628
Scott: I don't know how he has done it, but I know he has done it.

191
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:45,573
Scott: Nope It's not what it is.

192
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:49,243
Scott: It's oh, he's hiding in the stove.

193
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:51,990
Scott: Hey, he's not he's not in his stove.

194
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:54,422
Scott: I did it backwards.

195
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:55,170
Rym: Good job.

196
00:13:55,491 --> 00:14:02,242
Rym: Anyway, one of your most famous jokes ever one of the best bits and animation ever created as far as you're concerned And you messed it up.

197
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:02,789
Scott: That's right.

198
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:15,070
Scott: This is perhaps my favorite Looney Tune there is and this kind of shit isn't on TV anymore because well It shows a guy putting someone else in an oven turn it on the gas and throw it a match in there.

199
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:16,214
Rym: It's one of the.

200
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:20,250
Rym: I really I remember this as a kid and I remember it was not long ago.

201
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,991
Rym: We were before we realized it was on the internet and we could just watch it any time We wanted.

202
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:29,630
Rym: we were talking about all these moments and quotes from old cartoons that we remember so dearly.

203
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:32,830
Scott: When I was a kid Looney Tunes was on all the time.

204
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:39,436
Scott: You could always find it on some channel or another and this one no matter how many times they came on It was always funny just to hear him say.

205
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:41,843
Scott: Oh, he's hiding in the stove.

206
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:49,234
Scott: Hey, and also it has the famous line Get it dead net And It's just.

207
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:53,190
Scott: it's such a great cartoon and it's only seven minutes long and it's on YouTube.

208
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,916
Scott: I don't know how long it'll stay on YouTube.

209
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:57,084
Scott: Someone might find it and get rid of it.

210
00:14:57,244 --> 00:15:03,050
Scott: But whatever you'll be able to find it Again, yeah, it'll come back up and it's actually a pretty high quality YouTube.

211
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:08,731
Scott: It's kind of scary when I look at it because this is made in 1954 or 55 54.

212
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:20,164
Scott: I was like, wow, it's old, you know I saw this on TV and like the 80s and 90s and I was a kid a hundred times and It was funny every single time just like the first time and it still is.

213
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:21,590
Scott: I can still watch it a hundred times.

214
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:22,527
Scott: It's that great.

215
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:37,030
Rym: so in the interest of not wasting any minutes before we get to the meat of tonight's episode initial My thing of the day is real simple.

216
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:41,989
Rym: This has been around the internet for a while But it was recently dug up and it's something everyone should read it.

217
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,581
Rym: I had never actually read it you'd think someone like me would have.

218
00:15:45,164 --> 00:15:49,108
Rym: it is a very detailed graphical description of how ice rinks actually work.

219
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:50,793
Rym: and And Zambonis.

220
00:15:50,894 --> 00:15:54,970
Rym: and before you think ruin Zambonis before you think Rym that's kind of lame.

221
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:57,377
Rym: You don't know how an ice rink works.

222
00:15:57,738 --> 00:16:00,947
Rym: There's no way you know how it works unless you're from Canada.

223
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:01,528
Scott: You're wrong.

224
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,339
Rym: You don't know.

225
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,950
Rym: it doesn't work the way you think it does.

226
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:10,070
Scott: Yeah, how do they freeze all that ice and make it all flat and shiny and skate on it without killing people?

227
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,381
Rym: Yeah, and how do they make those lines appear?

228
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:14,410
Rym: They don't paint the stuff under the ice.

229
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,521
Scott: No, they paint it on the floor under the ice.

230
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:18,144
Rym: No, they don't.

231
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:19,290
Rym: you didn't even read it.

232
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,735
Scott: Did you that they have to?

233
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:23,203
Rym: no no, no, you know what they do what.

234
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:27,277
Rym: they layer a thin layer of ice Mm-hmm, then another thin layer of ice.

235
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,596
Rym: then they paint that ice white Uh-huh, then there's another layer ice.

236
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:38,530
Rym: then they paint the lines on that layer of ice and then they cover that with a whole bunch More eyes, huh?

237
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,951
Rym: The actual surface is kind of nappy.

238
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:41,751
Scott: Uh-huh.

239
00:16:42,091 --> 00:16:42,652
Rym: Well, that's a word.

240
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:44,012
Rym: I haven't used since middle school.

241
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:44,892
Scott: Alrighty.

242
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:26,347
Scott: Oh Yeah, that's some good stuff right there.

243
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:37,578
Rym: see initial D didn't just get me interested in cars It didn't just give me a very high quality B anime to enjoy and yell and scream about.

244
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,212
Rym: it Didn't open me up to the world of racing manga.

245
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:48,315
Rym: it in addition to all of that It gave me eurobeat and super eurobeat music that to this day.

246
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:51,957
Rym: I can always dance to such energy.

247
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:54,506
Scott: See initial D. Let's see.

248
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:57,615
Scott: We first saw it at anime club and they showed four episodes.

249
00:17:57,655 --> 00:17:58,257
Rym: Yeah bear in mind.

250
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:01,147
Rym: We weren't even Running the anime club.

251
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,920
Rym: We were just some freshmen sitting in the front row heckling.

252
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:10,801
Scott: Yep, and you know, I wasn't really paying much attention to it because we were all heckling and such so I didn't really get into It.

253
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,146
Scott: I was just like got a race.

254
00:18:12,427 --> 00:18:12,889
Scott: Whoo.

255
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:14,254
Scott: We don't know if he wins or not.

256
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:15,920
Scott: Ooh, whatever the show was crap.

257
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,562
Rym: Let's help that.

258
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:18,306
Rym: It was just generally kind of a boring.

259
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:22,377
Rym: Alright, so car racing with bad PlayStation 1 animation.

260
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:22,898
Rym: What's this?

261
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:28,000
Scott: Yeah Not exactly the most best first impression made by an anime.

262
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:36,674
Rym: Yeah And the fourth episode because they only show four episodes of something at club Aided on the cliffhanger of well, does he win the race or not?

263
00:18:36,855 --> 00:18:38,420
Rym: And we all thought I don't care.

264
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:40,320
Scott: Yeah, I really didn't give a shit.

265
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:43,358
Scott: I could have lived the rest of my life not knowing whether he won that race or not.

266
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:47,078
Rym: now I remember very clearly we were talking about how boring that anime was.

267
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:49,008
Rym: now much We disliked it now stupid it was.

268
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:53,138
Scott: and all that on the way back to our dorms and you know What most people who watch this show?

269
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,879
Scott: They stick with that opinion for the rest of their lives and you can't really blame them.

270
00:18:58,422 --> 00:19:03,019
Rym: Yeah, even though we what I think it was me you asked So do you think he really wins or not?

271
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,720
Rym: And we talked about it a little bit before we gave up and went to play battle tech or something.

272
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:12,003
Scott: Yeah, that was good times But battle tech is definitely better than it'll be Now.

273
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:27,420
Rym: there is often the fallacy that just because the first impression of something is bad The rest of it must be bad Which has screwed a lot of people out of a lot of awesome things like Probably the best hockey game I ever saw where two of the people with us left before the crazy end.

274
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:36,440
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people, you know They they don't like something or they do like something prior to experiencing it and they've already decided before they've seen it.

275
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,144
Scott: You know, they don't like it.

276
00:19:37,164 --> 00:19:37,365
Scott: They go.

277
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,592
Scott: What's this an anime about?

278
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:40,040
Scott: cars screw that?

279
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:43,360
Scott: And then even if you show it to them, they already don't want to like it.

280
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,230
Scott: So they're never gonna like it and that's fine for them.

281
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:57,892
Rym: now for some godforsaken reason and to this day I don't know why cuz we know it's not like we had free time other than you know, the infinite free time We were already wasting playing battle tech and Dungeons & Dragons and board games.

282
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:58,334
Rym: Yep.

283
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:00,600
Rym: We went to an initial D marathon.

284
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:06,996
Rym: I think we planned to show up Gather everyone we knew who was there skip out early and play a game or something.

285
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:13,980
Scott: That might have been the plan I don't remember but I do remember sitting there and watching all 26 episodes of the first season of initial D.

286
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,601
Rym: I remember.

287
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:25,212
Rym: I remember we decided we were all gonna go watch the fifth episode find out if he won or not and then leave Mm-hmm, but then it was kind of good.

288
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:27,120
Rym: So we wanted to see if he's gonna win the next one.

289
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,046
Scott: I think what happened?

290
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:39,345
Scott: I think part of it was sort of a peer pressure thing Like when we saw it at Anime Club, there were a lot of people there So everyone most of the people there had the vibe of and so we also had the vibe of it when we went to see the marathon.

291
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:41,292
Scott: there were very few people there and it was.

292
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:52,675
Scott: we were actually able to like pay attention to the Eurobeat music and you know feel the energy of the show and have it absorb into our bodies and Then it sort of melted us into the seats and we couldn't get away see.

293
00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:56,532
Rym: several of our friends said All right He won the race great and then they left.

294
00:20:56,572 --> 00:21:00,167
Rym: and they're like Rym and Scott Because no one called a scrim back then.

295
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:03,720
Rym: obviously no one calls a scrim now except are you listeners?

296
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:06,887
Scott: Can't be bothered to type anyway.

297
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:09,035
Rym: Yeah, his real name is Scott prime.

298
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,326
Rym: No anyway So they're like Rym and Scott.

299
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:15,554
Rym: Why aren't you leaving this terrible terrible show?

300
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,180
Rym: and we looked at them and said shut up.

301
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,359
Rym: I want to find out if he wins the gum tape deathmatch.

302
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:23,370
Scott: That's right fucking gum tape deathmatch for the win man.

303
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:27,300
Rym: This show went from 0 to 60 in about seven episodes.

304
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:33,700
Scott: I mean No one can say that the animation in this show is good.

305
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,189
Scott: In fact, it's ass in the first season.

306
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:39,119
Scott: The animation is as the characters are fugly.

307
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:50,254
Rym: I mean, how could no Buru Furu say who has done stuff for x-driver and You're under arrest and all these other great anime?

308
00:21:50,395 --> 00:21:53,931
Rym: at least character design wise Make these characters.

309
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:55,040
Rym: I don't know.

310
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,000
Rym: Well, the answer is because they look like that in the manga and he had no control.

311
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,271
Scott: Yes, the manga of initially is by Shuichi Shigen.

312
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:03,840
Scott: Oh and it is almost identical to all the anime.

313
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:14,716
Scott: There is a slight difference in the first season of the anime in the chronological order of events Between the first season of anime and the manga and they're roughly equivalent.

314
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:15,680
Scott: It doesn't really matter.

315
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,969
Rym: Yeah the only if you're gonna read the manga.

316
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:25,116
Rym: all I'm gonna tell you is that what you must do is Get some eurobeat and play it in the background while you read.

317
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:26,060
Scott: I do that all the time.

318
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:34,520
Rym: If you don't do that, you're really gonna miss out on pretty much everything that makes initial Yeah, also like the third or fourth race in the manga is like the climax.

319
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:40,180
Scott: They save that race to the end of the first season and they took some races after it and moved it before.

320
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:42,551
Scott: So, you know you got to pick one or the other.

321
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:53,099
Scott: but after the first season of the anime Starting with the second season of the anime they pretend as if everything that happened was just like the manga and they forget that The first season changed the order of events.

322
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:58,920
Rym: So we're not gonna talk about the manga and I highly recommend you watch the anime first or just watch the anime.

323
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:00,188
Scott: Yeah, they're almost identical.

324
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:01,860
Scott: It doesn't really matter, you know.

325
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:06,555
Scott: Basically, all you really want to watch is the first season of the anime and possibly the movie.

326
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:18,899
Rym: possibly the movie is pretty good Yeah, but we're gonna talk mostly about the first season which begins great gets great ends Amazingly and it ends on a note where you don't need any more.

327
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:21,611
Rym: It didn't need to pull the one piece and keep going.

328
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:23,138
Rym: don't watch anything past that.

329
00:23:23,158 --> 00:23:26,429
Scott: no I mean you could if you're really really like it.

330
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:29,558
Scott: keep watching because it's not as good after that.

331
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:33,920
Scott: after that It's mostly races and the other half of the show kind of fades away.

332
00:23:34,261 --> 00:23:35,085
Rym: Yeah, cuz everyone.

333
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:38,460
Rym: here's the basic problem with people that they saw this show.

334
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,560
Rym: They thought it was about stupid car racing and made-up drift racing and they left.

335
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:44,506
Rym: But that's only half the show.

336
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:53,251
Rym: the other half of the show is funny high school romance kids Dealing at each other running around causing trouble

337
00:23:53,633 --> 00:24:00,795
Scott: and there's definitely a story of you know Figuring out what you want to do when you grow up when you you know I mean and that how many kids in this country does that identify with?

338
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:01,680
Scott: where they're all like?

339
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:03,348
Scott: I don't know what I want to do.

340
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:10,459
Scott: I'll go to college and be undecided and blue You know, that's what initial D is about is figuring out what the hell you want to do and going for it.

341
00:24:10,706 --> 00:24:18,320
Rym: I mean Starting to care about something for such a seemingly vapid and just silly show about drift racers in the mountains of Japan.

342
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:32,180
Rym: this ship the show actually has quite a few poignant moments and really actually and I'm not kidding has a Pretty good message that is executed very well and just a little bit moving.

343
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:34,412
Scott: Yeah after that though after the first season.

344
00:24:34,492 --> 00:24:35,296
Scott: It's just drift racing.

345
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:35,638
Scott: Yeah

346
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:50,779
Rym: so if you like the racing part and you don't care about the fact that it katani likes this girl and Itsuki's a loser, but he's funny and then he gets into a car accident If you just want to watch Takumi race while music plays the rest of initial D is all for you

347
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,999
Scott: Yep, but if you're a normal person the first season is where the action is.

348
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:03,527
Rym: But like there's a scene near the like middling end like kind of on the rising tide of the show before the climax and everything We're talking me.

349
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:07,921
Rym: the main character goes out and washes his car Scene.

350
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:11,993
Rym: that is a that is probably I'd say in the top 50 scenes of anime ever.

351
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:13,477
Scott: Oh could be very well.

352
00:25:13,517 --> 00:25:16,915
Rym: not top 10 No way, but it's animated so poorly.

353
00:25:16,955 --> 00:25:30,899
Rym: then yeah But that's the power of the show that as dumb as it might seem the concept and as silly and joke ish and unrealistic as it might be This scene where he washes his car is actually really moving.

354
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:38,219
Scott: But I mean if you haven't seen you know the show and you you're not really paying attention to it Then that scene it just means nothing.

355
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:40,688
Scott: But once you know what has come before.

356
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:53,792
Scott: you know, you see this guy who didn't care about shit, you know He was racing because his dad told him well He guess he cares about girls and he was racing so he could get you know Free gas from his dad who would you know give basically pay him to race.

357
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:59,620
Scott: and then you know now here He is washing the car that no one told his dad didn't tell him to wash it.

358
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:04,476
Rym: He just washed up his own volition and then he stands there looking at it and he kind of has this look of.

359
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:07,906
Scott: I found my Way, yeah, it's good stuff.

360
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:12,820
Rym: Of course now I mentioned a bit, you know funny high school style humor.

361
00:26:13,464 --> 00:26:15,720
Rym: It's not like all that other anime high school humor.

362
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,580
Scott: No, it's not like this isn't like a full metal panic thing where there's robots and then wacky anime high school.

363
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:28,120
Rym: It's realistic high school at least insofar as saved by the Bell was a realistic representation of high school.

364
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:33,500
Scott: Well, it's not so much saved by the Bell basically, it doesn't really concentrate on the school that much.

365
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,974
Scott: It's just characters who are high school age.

366
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:45,870
Rym: All right, let me put it this way It would be very very very realistic if it weren't for the fact that these racing gangs exist Yeah, and the fact that the way they talk to each other,

367
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,680
Scott: you know, it's actually more kind of like a happy days kind of thing.

368
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,050
Rym: Actually, yeah, I never really thought of it that way.

369
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,316
Scott: I just thought of that just now.

370
00:26:53,337 --> 00:26:53,980
Rym: it kind of is.

371
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:01,750
Rym: I mean most of the scenes will show like a bunch of these guys hanging out at a diner along the mountain Yeah, or hanging out at the gas station where they all work.

372
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:04,580
Scott: Yep, and they're not really hanging out in the school so much.

373
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:08,253
Rym: So what is the plot of initial do you might ask there?

374
00:27:08,354 --> 00:27:09,639
Scott: Okay ready get this.

375
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:15,559
Scott: there's a guy and He is the economy Fujiwara and his dad.

376
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:20,519
Scott: Him and his dad live alone and there his dad runs a tofu shop and he goes to school.

377
00:27:21,763 --> 00:27:26,420
Scott: The dad sells tofu not only out of his shop, but he delivers tofu to many places.

378
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:28,899
Scott: One of those places is Akina hotel.

379
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,392
Scott: Well, Akina is where they live and there is a mountain Mount Akina.

380
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:43,079
Scott: at the top of this mountain is a Hotel for tourism to the mountain and the mountain has like a nice lake that you can go to if you go up the mountain And it's a nice touristy place.

381
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:55,073
Scott: Yeah but the the road going up to the mountain is kind of old and windy because it's a very steep very windy road that you have to go very slow and is very dangerous and There's lots of drift racing that goes on up there.

382
00:27:55,657 --> 00:28:01,574
Scott: Anyway This dad, you know Fujiwara dad Boonter crazy Boonter.

383
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:03,480
Rym: Boonter is the best character in the show hands.

384
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:05,972
Scott: I was just gonna say that Boonter was the best character in the show.

385
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:07,540
Rym: Goddamn is Boonter great?

386
00:28:08,263 --> 00:28:13,797
Scott: He doesn't want to deliver the tofu to the top of the mountain at the crack of dawn because well It's a pain in the ass.

387
00:28:14,382 --> 00:28:15,666
Scott: So he makes his son do it.

388
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:22,860
Scott: when the sign his son was in middle school and not allowed to drive He made him do it because well, you know, it's on a back road in the middle of the night.

389
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:25,192
Rym: It's like four or five in the morning.

390
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:30,013
Rym: the Sun isn't even up yet and From what people have told me at least in places like that in Japan.

391
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:31,460
Rym: There's no one driving at night.

392
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:33,152
Rym: You're not gonna run into anyone.

393
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:34,220
Scott: There's no speed track.

394
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:50,440
Scott: I mean imagine if you lived in a tofu shop all alone and like the boonies and You had a you know a kid in seventh grade and he had a little tiny car and he could drive it Just not legally and you all you needed him to drive was up the mountain at night, you know at 4 in the morning.

395
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:52,392
Scott: I think he could I think he could manage.

396
00:28:52,794 --> 00:28:57,099
Rym: so the kid does it Constantly every morning is to get up and drive this tofu up before he does.

397
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:59,486
Scott: now The thing is tofu sits in water.

398
00:28:59,787 --> 00:29:01,091
Rym: Well, no, no, no, we can't get to that yet.

399
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:04,480
Rym: Okay, see Takumi doesn't like doing this.

400
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:05,888
Scott: Oh, he doesn't like doing it.

401
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:07,839
Scott: He wants to go to bed just like you and me.

402
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:13,780
Rym: So he starts driving as fast as he can and every day he gets a little bit faster.

403
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:14,186
Rym: He just got.

404
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:15,019
Rym: I mean he can't floor it.

405
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,380
Rym: Obviously he'd fall off the mountain and die.

406
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,869
Rym: But he drives the car as fast as he possibly can to get this done with and go back to bed on this incredibly dangerous mountain road.

407
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:28,965
Rym: and one day he goes a little too fast around the corners and Destroys the tofu.

408
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:30,734
Rym: you see now I can get to what Scott was talking.

409
00:29:30,754 --> 00:29:31,538
Scott: So his dad beat him.

410
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,045
Rym: Yes, dad beat.

411
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:38,909
Rym: I mean it's not like the stupid live-action initial D movie Which you should ignore and avoid like the plague.

412
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:40,434
Scott: Yes, the live-action.

413
00:29:40,494 --> 00:29:41,698
Scott: It's only movie is bad.

414
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:48,220
Rym: Very bad Yeah, I mean when bunta beats his kid in the live-action Chinese initial D he beats him half to death.

415
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:52,860
Scott: Yeah, now he just kind of whacks him on the head with the newspaper like, you know, funny anime style.

416
00:29:53,581 --> 00:29:57,856
Scott: Anyway, so when he gets home dad's like are you messed up the tofu?

417
00:29:57,876 --> 00:29:59,000
Scott: cuz tofu sits in water?

418
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:03,540
Scott: And if you disturb it too much then you can ruin it so you can't drive too recklessly.

419
00:30:04,242 --> 00:30:13,880
Scott: So he puts a cup of water in the car and he says as long as the water stays in that cup when you drive Then the tofu won't be messed up because the tofu is also in water.

420
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:23,800
Scott: So Takumi's all pissed now because he has to drive slow again But he eventually learns to drive in a way that he can go fast without disturbing the water.

421
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:28,659
Rym: Now fast forward several years and this is where the anime begins.

422
00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:55,659
Rym: Street racing gangs Roam the earth not really just.

423
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,410
Rym: there's mountains all over Japan and no one drives on him at night.

424
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:05,090
Rym: So punk kids with rice cars hang out and drift race around and have fun on the mountains.

425
00:31:05,392 --> 00:31:08,510
Scott: Yeah, they form little gang and they take it in the anime.

426
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:15,743
Scott: The characters take it more seriously than people do in real life, but that's necessary Yeah, or else there's no point.

427
00:31:15,803 --> 00:31:16,426
Rym: some of them don't.

428
00:31:16,446 --> 00:31:20,180
Rym: the speed stars Until trouble happens, they don't take it that sir.

429
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:20,903
Scott: No, they don't.

430
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:22,830
Rym: but there's a bunch of little teams.

431
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:31,096
Rym: there's the Akina speed stars and there's the night kid yogi night kids and the Akagi red sun who will get to.

432
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:40,135
Rym: yeah now the red sons are a team that is run by two brothers Takahashi Ryosuke and case.

433
00:31:40,155 --> 00:31:40,516
Rym: okay.

434
00:31:40,697 --> 00:31:47,930
Scott: Yeah, they're the Takahashi brothers and their dad is a doctor a rich doctor So they have lots of money to buy fancy cars now.

435
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:52,344
Rym: These guys are also super bishonen and they have super fast cars.

436
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:59,228
Rym: one of them drives an rx-7 FC And one of them drives one of the best cars ever made the rx-7 FD.

437
00:32:00,112 --> 00:32:03,830
Scott: There are awesome cars because they have Wankel engines not piston engines.

438
00:32:04,011 --> 00:32:08,111
Scott: And if you don't know what that is, look it up because it's freaking on or watch the show and you'll learn a little bit About it.

439
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:12,727
Scott: Yeah, the closest thing you can get to it nowadays is a used rx-7 or an rx-8.

440
00:32:12,968 --> 00:32:13,590
Rym: now think of this.

441
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,616
Rym: Here's a scale of how good this car is.

442
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:20,510
Rym: a used beat-up rx-7 goes for more than most brand-new cars today.

443
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:27,311
Rym: Yeah Like are and actually there was a guy at my work who had an rx-7 FD and he took me for a few spins in It.

444
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:31,388
Scott: and good fucking God It's quite an awesome car.

445
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:36,630
Rym: You would not believe how fast that guy could take it around corners.

446
00:32:37,871 --> 00:32:43,430
Rym: Anyway anyway, so they're rich and the ryosuke the smart one.

447
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:50,190
Rym: You see Rose K is the smart bishonen one and case K is the wild and reckless emotional bishonen one.

448
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:53,728
Rym: But they're both really smart and they're both coincidentally street racers.

449
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,721
Rym: So he decides before he goes to doctor school.

450
00:32:57,741 --> 00:33:00,310
Rym: at the end, you know, he's gonna leave he's gonna go to doctor school.

451
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:05,300
Rym: he wants to take his little team and Conquer every mountain in.

452
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:06,910
Rym: where are they?

453
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,930
Scott: Genma gun gun gun my gun my prefecture.

454
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:18,193
Rym: He wants to beat every street racing team on every mountain in the prefecture before he goes to medical school to prove that he is A badass.

455
00:33:18,534 --> 00:33:21,770
Scott: Yeah, and he's already sort of famous for being a badass street racer.

456
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:25,023
Scott: So, you know and every mountain of course has a street racing team.

457
00:33:25,063 --> 00:33:26,770
Scott: a mountain without a street racing team is unthinkable.

458
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:34,310
Scott: Yeah, so all he has to do is to go to every mountain see who's there Practice on that course a little bit and then beat them with his awesome fast car.

459
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,989
Rym: So the first mountain they pick they because it's in the middle of stick nowhere and they know that no one there can drive.

460
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:48,670
Rym: worth of Shit is Mount Akina and they have their plan, you know We're gonna start here and then we're gonna conquer the whole blah blah blah blah.

461
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:53,430
Rym: And this is where the cunning plan goes horribly awry and where the anime begins.

462
00:33:54,053 --> 00:34:01,350
Scott: When one of them is practicing, you know learning the course because they you know The Akina speed stars are a bunch of schmucks and they can't really race at all.

463
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,236
Scott: Yeah, I mean they're just wannabes.

464
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:04,721
Rym: their leader Ikitani.

465
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:08,998
Scott: he gets and he's a good character and I like him But he can't drive for shit.

466
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:11,389
Scott: He's also a loose passed out in the third corner.

467
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,770
Scott: Anyway They're practicing on this course.

468
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,768
Scott: So one night case a case driving down the mountain and he sees some headlights in his rearview mirror.

469
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:25,350
Scott: now He's racing down this mountain.

470
00:34:25,471 --> 00:34:32,003
Scott: So if he sees headlights in his rearview mirror that can only mean Someone is going as fast or faster than he is going.

471
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:35,094
Rym: so he speeds up, you know, whatever I'll leave this guy in my does.

472
00:34:35,135 --> 00:34:38,248
Rym: no one's better than me except my brother and that's debatable.

473
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:45,409
Scott: and you know The only people around are people on his team and the Akina speed stars are a bunch of schmucks No one else would be racing down this hill.

474
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:49,022
Scott: So, you know, he knows it's not his brother because he can tell by the headlights.

475
00:34:49,484 --> 00:34:54,510
Rym: so he's like, uh, well So he keeps going and going and this car keeps pace with him.

476
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,060
Rym: And finally he sees what kind of car it is.

477
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,670
Rym: He's debating what kind of car it is Like.

478
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,995
Scott: he's like oh is it this kind?

479
00:34:59,035 --> 00:34:59,657
Scott: is it that kind?

480
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:00,721
Scott: all these fast cars?

481
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:03,753
Rym: and then he sees it and it's a Hachi Roku.

482
00:35:04,054 --> 00:35:09,035
Scott: now Hachi Roku in Japan Japanese means eight six It's a toy.

483
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:12,029
Scott: basically this car, you know, it what do they call it the?

484
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:13,273
Scott: Train.

485
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:21,507
Scott: oh, yeah, it's a. it's a Toyota true a no 86 which really means that it's a Toyota Corolla.

486
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:29,450
Scott: effectively It's a Toyota Corolla from 1985 with a hatchback, but it's got this like 86 ae engine or whatever.

487
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:31,175
Rym: No, the ae 86 chassis.

488
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:32,620
Scott: That's right as opposed.

489
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:32,961
Rym: Yeah.

490
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:35,810
Scott: Yeah, because there's you can also get the knot.

491
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,842
Scott: It's the sportiest Toyota Corolla available in 1985.

492
00:35:38,842 --> 00:35:42,201
Scott: It's actually a very famous Racing car in Japan.

493
00:35:42,302 --> 00:35:48,450
Rym: Yeah, it's in fact It's still used today for a lot of nostalgic value and it's still a pretty good car if you modify it properly.

494
00:35:48,791 --> 00:36:00,049
Scott: Yeah, I mean basically the reason they chose this car is because there's a guy called the drift King Who's like a famous drift racing guy in Japan a real guy and he actually comes up in the show once or twice.

495
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:05,710
Scott: Yeah, and This guy famously drove the 86 is car of choice for his drift racing.

496
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:16,624
Rym: Yeah, if you look search around for drift videos from Japan and look for actual ones on courses Not like punk kids burning rubber in a parking lot and you'll see what this is all about.

497
00:36:16,865 --> 00:36:22,364
Rym: Yeah, it's half Racing and half showing off and another half.

498
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:23,729
Rym: I guess there's three halves rice.

499
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:27,967
Scott: Yeah, but I think it's a lot less rice than you see on the streets though.

500
00:36:28,348 --> 00:36:31,604
Rym: Yeah Well, Japan is very different than America.

501
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:32,448
Scott: It is.

502
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:36,979
Rym: it is so He thinks what this crap old car?

503
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,290
Rym: and he puts the pedal to the metal and they the guys keeping pace with him.

504
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,718
Rym: He's thinking what the hell's up with this.

505
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:52,734
Rym: and then in the critical moment there's he knows there's a sharp corner coming up because it could bends around and then it bends back around and he slows the hell down because He doesn't want to die.

506
00:36:52,774 --> 00:36:54,403
Rym: You can't go around that corner fast.

507
00:36:54,745 --> 00:37:01,485
Rym: It's Carl to spin out I'll crash and this hot chiroku just goes on full bore and he's thinking.

508
00:37:01,685 --> 00:37:03,430
Rym: Oh, no, this guy was an amateur.

509
00:37:03,812 --> 00:37:04,837
Rym: He totally fucked up.

510
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:04,958
Rym: Now.

511
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:06,626
Rym: He's gonna die and I'm gonna have to watch it.

512
00:37:06,706 --> 00:37:26,210
Rym: Oh, no, and then Now the anime slows down into slow motion at this point to show this car Drift a little bit to the one side lose traction and some of the tires and then rebound around the corner and disappear into the distance.

513
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,421
Rym: Kzk spins the hell out cuz he doesn't know what he just saw.

514
00:37:32,143 --> 00:37:37,545
Scott: He says the words on side And then he says was that a fucking ghost?

515
00:37:37,747 --> 00:37:38,772
Scott: Oh my god What the fuck.

516
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:41,102
Rym: and he just sits there doesn't know what the hell has.

517
00:37:41,122 --> 00:37:46,615
Scott: he totally just got pulled by a Crap old car.

518
00:37:46,675 --> 00:37:54,821
Scott: This is as if you were racing down a street in a Corvette and of Frickin you go past you.

519
00:37:55,364 --> 00:37:56,350
Scott: that's what this is like.

520
00:37:57,171 --> 00:37:58,154
Scott: That's why it's awesome.

521
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,768
Rym: Now if you haven't guessed Takumi's driving this car.

522
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:08,150
Scott: Yes It's sort of like the show keeps you in suspense like oh who's driving that car?

523
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:11,140
Scott: They don't let you know, but you're pretty sure.

524
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,250
Scott: oh, it's like in Trigun is he washed the stampede?

525
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,135
Scott: They don't let you know.

526
00:38:16,356 --> 00:38:27,650
Scott: They try to keep it a secret from you for like four or five episodes, but you freaking know You know, it's actually pretty fun though, because if you act if I didn't just spoil it for you, which isn't the big spoiler

527
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,393
Rym: Oh god, no

528
00:38:28,413 --> 00:38:30,502
Scott: now there are much bigger things to spoil.

529
00:38:30,582 --> 00:38:35,253
Scott: an initial D like Shingo like Shingo, but You're you could.

530
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:39,130
Scott: actually if you've never seen the show before you could actually be in quite a bit of suspense.

531
00:38:39,271 --> 00:38:40,858
Scott: Like is he driving the car?

532
00:38:41,341 --> 00:38:42,185
Scott: How is he so good?

533
00:38:42,205 --> 00:38:45,330
Scott: They don't even tell you all the stuff We've told you until like episode 3.

534
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,869
Rym: Yep And there's a lot of suspense among the characters as to who's driving this car.

535
00:38:50,391 --> 00:38:56,049
Rym: Cuz the Akina speed stars suck and they know they're gonna lose and they take this really seriously.

536
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:58,179
Rym: and one day They're like, they don't know that Takumi can drive.

537
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,990
Rym: them even know that his dad really has a car.

538
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:07,891
Scott: They know talk to me like he's their friend who works at the gas station But they think he doesn't know shit about cars because he doesn't really know shit about cars like.

539
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:15,297
Rym: there's a really funny scene where they're watching some videos of this drift king racing and they're talking about Inertial drift and how to do it.

540
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:18,668
Rym: then Takumi's like but they're in Takumi's like, what do you guys?

541
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:19,270
Rym: this is dumb?

542
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,276
Rym: What you're talking about.

543
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:21,867
Rym: and they're like, you don't know anything about this.

544
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:27,549
Rym: talking me says Yeah, you just kind of turn the wheel like this and then like this and tap the brake and they look at him Like he's an idiot.

545
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:32,730
Rym: But the gas station owner who knows all about racing because he's friends with crazy boota.

546
00:39:33,673 --> 00:39:36,242
Rym: We won't reveal much about boota, but you'll figure things out.

547
00:39:36,383 --> 00:39:38,430
Rym: Yeah, but he knows about drift racing.

548
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:41,481
Rym: They both know about drift racing and he's thinking to himself.

549
00:39:42,003 --> 00:39:44,070
Rym: That was the answer of a professional racer.

550
00:39:48,432 --> 00:39:49,740
Rym: So we shouldn't really we've.

551
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,275
Rym: I think we've explained enough about the show I think we have.

552
00:39:52,335 --> 00:39:56,236
Scott: if you if you're not already in suspense You're not gonna be so.

553
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:57,000
Scott: more importantly.

554
00:39:57,642 --> 00:39:59,310
Rym: What are the important bits about this show?

555
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,990
Scott: I mean the music is the number one most important part of this show.

556
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:38,242
Rym: Hands-down, I mean every race has this music.

557
00:40:38,643 --> 00:40:39,606
Rym: without this you are.

558
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:40,630
Scott: without this music.

559
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:42,416
Scott: The show is basically completely worthless.

560
00:40:42,456 --> 00:40:43,520
Scott: We did it once even watch it.

561
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:47,754
Rym: I watched an of race on mute And it was just boring.

562
00:40:47,855 --> 00:40:51,025
Rym: PlayStation 1 like watching someone play Gran Turismo.

563
00:40:51,045 --> 00:41:00,430
Scott: Yeah, the graphics during the races are PlayStation 1 cars driving down like around some turns but with that music playing especially by the second or third race.

564
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:04,430
Rym: You totally forget that and as far as you're concerned, this is a hundred percent real.

565
00:41:05,192 --> 00:41:25,190
Scott: That mute the music the Eurobeat music sort of like grabs you and fills you with like this certain kind of energy and you know Change the songs throughout the race depending and they always pick just the right one and you can totally you know Feel like the pressure and suspense of the race in you and as it goes down.

566
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,910
Scott: So you don't really care about what's happening or who's gonna win?

567
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:37,946
Scott: It's just sort of like, you know There's a race of cars and you're feel you're on this sort of downhill slope That's going around all these turns inside of you until the race is over.

568
00:41:37,966 --> 00:41:43,018
Rym: now There's some amazing Scenes that you wouldn't expect.

569
00:41:43,078 --> 00:41:44,786
Rym: I mean, there's the car washing scene, whatever.

570
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:51,451
Rym: but even in the races I mean, I can't spoil any of this but I think Scott remembers the scene where there happened to be three cars going down the Mountain.

571
00:41:51,952 --> 00:41:58,306
Rym: Oh, man, and something happens to one of these cars and then there's the car in the back does something it's.

572
00:41:58,326 --> 00:42:03,990
Rym: I Remember the first time I saw that I was like, it's really a show of great scenes.

573
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:09,690
Scott: It's like all the time they spend in the big like early parts of an episode or well not early parts of an episode.

574
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:17,690
Scott: But it's the show sort of follows a pattern where okay Here's the characters the characters are progressing in his great big storyline.

575
00:42:18,212 --> 00:42:25,395
Scott: But there's also the you know intermittent races which take about like four to five episodes and usually it's like, okay Who's he gonna race god?

576
00:42:25,435 --> 00:42:29,770
Rym: I just realized that the format of the show is a lot like the cycle of domestic abuse.

577
00:42:30,432 --> 00:42:32,639
Rym: There's the calm right everything is great.

578
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:34,224
Rym: They're just you know, walking around town.

579
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:36,210
Rym: then tension starts mounting.

580
00:42:36,571 --> 00:42:38,558
Rym: There's rumblings that someone's gonna challenge.

581
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:39,581
Rym: There's gonna be a race.

582
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,166
Rym: then there's the race.

583
00:42:41,688 --> 00:42:42,310
Rym: It's coming up.

584
00:42:42,551 --> 00:42:43,477
Rym: They build up the right.

585
00:42:43,517 --> 00:42:45,690
Scott: they build up to a race for a couple episodes.

586
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:50,790
Scott: Then there is a race and then the races last like an episode or an episode and a half every race.

587
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:56,270
Rym: There's like the pre race where there's like everyone's getting ready and there's the tension of what's gonna happen.

588
00:42:56,652 --> 00:42:57,616
Rym: Who's gonna race?

589
00:42:57,897 --> 00:42:58,621
Rym: you wouldn't think that.

590
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:00,489
Rym: but half the early race is part of the tension.

591
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:06,106
Rym: is Who's actually going to be racing in what cars where and why and what stakes?

592
00:43:06,908 --> 00:43:07,209
Rym: and then?

593
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:18,030
Rym: The like the first episode of the race covers like the first three quarters of the race Like one episode and then they'll cliffhang you and finish the race in the next episode.

594
00:43:18,211 --> 00:43:22,490
Rym: God, this show is a bunch of cliffhangers in a row and then another calm after the race.

595
00:43:22,992 --> 00:43:28,710
Scott: And the other thing the show does is every time you think you have it figured out they introduce some other doubt.

596
00:43:29,295 --> 00:43:32,296
Scott: so, you know, it's like You'll be watching the races.

597
00:43:32,316 --> 00:43:34,203
Scott: You'd be like I know who's gonna win this race.

598
00:43:34,283 --> 00:43:35,970
Scott: It's obvious who's gonna win this race.

599
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,194
Scott: Why would I even watch it?

600
00:43:37,255 --> 00:43:40,707
Scott: and then they put some doubt in there and they add doubt every time.

601
00:43:40,767 --> 00:43:46,624
Scott: and like they've added Doubt a hundred times for every single race they add more doubt and you're like, there's no way.

602
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:47,567
Scott: they've done this.

603
00:43:47,707 --> 00:43:52,059
Scott: every single race They've added doubt and I was right what the hell.

604
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,430
Scott: and then they add doubt again and you're totally fooled every time this.

605
00:43:57,832 --> 00:44:00,163
Rym: And there's also the real street.

606
00:44:00,183 --> 00:44:01,409
Rym: racers don't need women.

607
00:44:02,551 --> 00:44:03,736
Scott: That's just a funny running game.

608
00:44:04,057 --> 00:44:05,241
Rym: There's a lot of funny.

609
00:44:05,362 --> 00:44:09,757
Rym: I mean, I think the charm of this show What really makes it goes that it's got the.

610
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:11,904
Rym: it's basically a fighting show with cars.

611
00:44:11,964 --> 00:44:13,630
Rym: It's got the racing element.

612
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:17,530
Scott: Yeah, but the fights aren't like Dragon Ball where they last ten episodes and nothing happened.

613
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,090
Rym: Yeah, and they drive the plot very directly and they're very well done.

614
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,397
Rym: But that alone does not make a good show.

615
00:44:23,437 --> 00:44:26,245
Rym: that makes a C anime by default with nothing else.

616
00:44:26,265 --> 00:44:27,128
Rym: That's a C anime.

617
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:28,758
Scott: hell It's a D anime.

618
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,505
Scott: It depends.

619
00:44:29,888 --> 00:44:41,276
Rym: Yeah Anyway, but it also has all a lot of characters and while the characters aren't as fleshed out as say Spike Spiegel from cowboy bebop They're very fleshed out.

620
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:43,144
Scott: they react even though they look ugly as hell.

621
00:44:43,425 --> 00:44:44,610
Rym: Yeah, don't worry about their lips.

622
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:48,307
Rym: I don't know that there was some sort of chemical deformity in this town.

623
00:44:48,548 --> 00:44:49,030
Scott: It must be.

624
00:44:50,094 --> 00:44:51,610
Scott: But that Lake Akina full of boys.

625
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:59,956
Rym: but there's a large cast of characters and you'll start identifying with them and you'll see Kenji of like Kenji blah blah blah.

626
00:44:59,976 --> 00:45:01,560
Rym: What are you doing here at the gas station?

627
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,810
Scott: He's such a side character Kenji, but you totally know him.

628
00:45:05,251 --> 00:45:08,260
Rym: Yeah, and then Sako and Mako in the silady.

629
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:09,784
Scott: it's those two good people.

630
00:45:10,105 --> 00:45:11,710
Rym: Oh man, plus they have good music, too.

631
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:12,971
Scott: Yeah, they have really good music.

632
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,248
Scott: So Initial D is The best B anime.

633
00:45:26,388 --> 00:45:28,837
Scott: no one's gonna say this is a great anime of all time.

634
00:45:28,857 --> 00:45:29,760
Scott: It's not even close.

635
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,884
Rym: It's not on the a-list.

636
00:45:30,985 --> 00:45:34,720
Scott: No one can possibly argue that this is good, but it is fun.

637
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:41,200
Scott: It's sort of like playing a board game that you know, the board game is bad It's just rolling dice and moving a guy around the board.

638
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,158
Scott: But for some reason you have a lot of fun with this one.

639
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:46,590
Scott: I think those two other ones part of what it is.

640
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:59,939
Rym: They took what would otherwise be a pedestrian concept You know car racing and they took all the elements of a good show and they put them in there And they did every part of Initial D as well as you could ever have expected them to do it.

641
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:09,332
Rym: And as a result the the show is more than the sum of its parts and I Highly recommend this show.

642
00:46:09,372 --> 00:46:13,528
Rym: if you were a fan of anime Watch the first five episodes.

643
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:16,677
Rym: just trust us if you don't like it after that.

644
00:46:16,737 --> 00:46:27,274
Rym: You really don't like it whatever, you're just not a human being and we'll hate you forever, but But no seriously give this show a chance and this isn't like, you know.

645
00:46:27,335 --> 00:46:28,860
Rym: give fist of the North Star chance.

646
00:46:29,021 --> 00:46:30,268
Rym: Really give this show a chance.

647
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:31,716
Scott: Oh, there's one more warning.

648
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:32,480
Scott: word of warning.

649
00:46:33,543 --> 00:46:39,064
Scott: If you get the DVDs of Initial D, oh Fuck you Tokyo pop.

650
00:46:39,465 --> 00:46:39,946
Scott: Fuck you.

651
00:46:40,207 --> 00:46:45,220
Scott: Okay, Tokyo pop licensed Initial D to be on DVD in the United States.

652
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,435
Scott: I think that license has been transferred and someone else is gonna re-release it correctly.

653
00:46:49,456 --> 00:46:51,242
Scott: Oh, I think Funimation I don't know.

654
00:46:51,262 --> 00:47:00,080
Scott: I forget but if you get the Tokyo pop DVDs of Initial D When you put them in your DVD player, it will give you two choices.

655
00:47:01,262 --> 00:47:06,165
Scott: one choice will say classic and one choice will say Tricked out.

656
00:47:06,427 --> 00:47:13,560
Rym: now now choosing the tricked-out option Will basically condemn your firstborn children to the fiery abyss of hell for all eternity.

657
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:19,319
Scott: Yes, what Tokyo pop did is they thought that they were gonna get Initial D on American television.

658
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:24,320
Scott: now Eurobeat music is sort of would have been a very expensive to get that on.

659
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:33,002
Rym: Yeah a vex track and move and all that that stuff was the hottest shit in Japan back then and it's still pretty hot shit all Things considered.

660
00:47:33,163 --> 00:47:38,120
Scott: Yeah, it would be very difficult for them to get that music onto American television.

661
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:47,933
Scott: Also, they didn't think that music would appeal to Americans and such and they knew that the target audience for a show about drift racing Was more urban.

662
00:47:48,013 --> 00:47:53,760
Scott: I guess they thought The kind of people who go and watch too fast too furious.

663
00:47:53,961 --> 00:47:57,932
Rym: But their definition of urban wasn't what most people's definition of urban was.

664
00:47:57,972 --> 00:48:00,940
Rym: their definition of urban was 12 year olds in suburbia, right?

665
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:16,512
Scott: So what they did is when they dubbed Initial D, which is an average of an anime dub, you know, actually Spike Spiegel plays David Lucas who does Spike Spiegel and Roger Smith, you know Probably the best voice actor in all of anime in America.

666
00:48:16,573 --> 00:48:18,200
Rym: I don't think we should tell them who he plays.

667
00:48:18,922 --> 00:48:19,685
Scott: Oh good point.

668
00:48:19,986 --> 00:48:33,400
Scott: He plays a minor character who is very important and Hilarious, but also very bad also very bad, but he's the best voice actor in America ever anyway, um What was I saying?

669
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,265
Scott: Alright, alright Tokyo pop.

670
00:48:36,306 --> 00:48:42,403
Scott: So what Tokyo pop did is they hired some people to make Terrible music.

671
00:48:42,724 --> 00:48:44,992
Scott: We're not worst music you've ever heard.

672
00:48:45,012 --> 00:48:52,074
Scott: I know Gerald drive initial D initial dream initial D. Yeah, it's really bad.

673
00:48:52,114 --> 00:48:53,638
Scott: It makes you want to stab your eyes out.

674
00:48:53,678 --> 00:48:54,240
Scott: I'm not kidding.

675
00:48:54,361 --> 00:48:56,640
Scott: I almost did what do you want to stab your ears out?

676
00:48:56,781 --> 00:49:02,719
Rym: If you stab your eyes out not only are you now blind and in pain But the music's still there and now you can't find the remote to turn it off.

677
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:10,752
Scott: Well, the reason you you do want to stab your eyes out is because not only Did they add change all the music and initial D thus ruining the show?

678
00:49:11,434 --> 00:49:24,970
Scott: Not only did they dub it averagely But they applied base what amounts to 1980s, you know College punk kids special effects to all the races effectively.

679
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:25,612
Rym: I it's.

680
00:49:26,013 --> 00:49:28,381
Rym: it's the modern equivalent of star wipes.

681
00:49:29,124 --> 00:49:30,970
Scott: Yeah, they basically like during a race.

682
00:49:31,331 --> 00:49:36,367
Scott: They would do like split the screen up into like four squares showing the same thing.

683
00:49:36,387 --> 00:49:43,930
Rym: Oh Also in the dub, they rearrange a bunch of scenes cut out a bunch of controversial stuff and partly change the plot.

684
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:46,242
Scott: They also change the names of the characters.

685
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,870
Scott: Oh, I got to talk about that in a second.

686
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:54,685
Scott: So watching it Dubbed or tricked out on the Tokyo pop DVDs is a completely different show.

687
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,110
Scott: That's not worth watching ever.

688
00:49:56,271 --> 00:49:58,218
Scott: It's like it might be the worst show ever.

689
00:49:58,238 --> 00:50:04,877
Rym: I know Daryl Surratt played some bad American equivalent anime music.

690
00:50:04,897 --> 00:50:11,498
Rym: when they try to redo that stuff and I'm not gonna do that here because I respect for you guys Yes, you really do not want to hear this music.

691
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:14,066
Rym: It is not even bad enough to be funny.

692
00:50:14,548 --> 00:50:15,230
Scott: It's inhuman.

693
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:23,291
Rym: It's I'm sorry Tokyo pop but you need to force whoever did that to commit seppuku right now Right.

694
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:35,750
Scott: So if you watch the classic version of initial D, you will get the original subtitled unedited initial D With the original eurobeat music and it is on the Tokyo pop DVDs.

695
00:50:36,071 --> 00:50:38,618
Scott: So it is worth watching just to get that.

696
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,530
Rym: However, if you like the show, you're probably better off Netflixing it.

697
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:50,001
Rym: I was just gonna say that and only buy it if you're the kind of person who would show scenes Over and over and over again.

698
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:55,404
Rym: to people like we'll periodically grab Key DVDs from initial D and watch specific races.

699
00:50:55,424 --> 00:50:56,990
Scott: We should totally watch one right after the show.

700
00:50:57,171 --> 00:50:57,894
Rym: I think we should.

701
00:50:57,914 --> 00:50:59,802
Rym: I want to watch the one with the three cars going.

702
00:51:00,163 --> 00:51:00,746
Scott: That's a good one.

703
00:51:00,987 --> 00:51:01,630
Scott: Let's watch that one.

704
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:02,034
Scott: That's right.

705
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:03,549
Rym: That's my second favorite moment in the show.

706
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:08,330
Scott: It might be anyway, the other thing is in the manga and in the dub.

707
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:08,893
Scott: I'm pretty sure.

708
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:12,190
Scott: in the dub they have changed the names of some of the characters.

709
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:16,264
Rym: Yeah, cuz apparently Americans can't say things like Takahashi Rios.

710
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:17,830
Rym: Okay, right Takumi.

711
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,960
Scott: so for example, the main character is Takumi.

712
00:51:20,261 --> 00:51:24,534
Scott: they changed his name to tak and Let's see ikitani.

713
00:51:24,554 --> 00:51:27,081
Scott: I think they changed his name or something.

714
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,685
Rym: No, I didn't actually read the stupid.

715
00:51:28,725 --> 00:51:32,013
Scott: They changed his name to Cole and It's a key.

716
00:51:32,053 --> 00:51:35,007
Scott: They changed his name to Iggy like Iggy pop.

717
00:51:35,629 --> 00:51:42,190
Rym: Oh I'm not gonna say much about it's a key but suffice to say he provides a great deal of the humor in this show.

718
00:51:42,592 --> 00:51:42,833
Rym: Yes.

719
00:51:43,155 --> 00:51:46,090
Scott: Oh and they changed Takahashi Keisuke's name to Katie.

720
00:51:47,872 --> 00:52:05,650
Scott: Yeah, yeah, that's in in the anime in the original manga and in the anime They actually say the characters names like Takahashi Keisuke, Takahashi Riosuke Ikitani, you know and it sort of adds something to it the way they say their names.

721
00:52:05,731 --> 00:52:17,215
Scott: they always say people's full names like You know Takumi Fujiwara, I'll remember that name, you know, and when they change the names it's like talk I'll remember you.

722
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:20,950
Scott: It's like what the fuck you weren't that casual before?

723
00:52:22,732 --> 00:52:25,930
Scott: You were all serious and racing and that you know, yeah, that's well.

724
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:34,330
Rym: That's also something that I mean aside from the full name thing Which is cool that Japanese has various levels of honor and defer deference that we really don't have in English.

725
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:38,481
Scott: Yeah, but you could still do it properly without making the name silly.

726
00:52:38,802 --> 00:52:41,570
Rym: yeah, I think the answer is just to watch the sub.

727
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:43,958
Scott: Yeah, watch the subtitled.

728
00:52:44,039 --> 00:53:01,248
Scott: first season of initial D. It's worth your time if you don't get into it, you don't get into it, you know, but It's something you have to like Feel inside you in the third place Not the first place or the second place but the third place.

729
00:53:01,288 --> 00:53:01,750
Scott: That's right.

730
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:10,161
Scott: If you don't feel it in the third place, it's not gonna work for you You know, so in the very least watch the first five episodes.

731
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:18,023
Rym: if you're a little more adventurous have a little more free time I'd say really watch the first 13 at least up through the salady race.

732
00:53:18,765 --> 00:53:20,610
Scott: I think that's actually way after the 13.

733
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,694
Rym: It might be I don't remember.

734
00:53:21,714 --> 00:53:22,738
Rym: I don't know.

735
00:53:22,758 --> 00:53:26,110
Rym: the gum tape race has got a really good moment in it.

736
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:28,410
Scott: Gum tape race is highest of quality.

737
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:35,310
Rym: I mean, it sounds so stupid if you explain to someone the concept of a gum tape race or gum tape death man.

738
00:53:35,471 --> 00:53:35,992
Scott: That's the thing.

739
00:53:36,032 --> 00:53:41,370
Scott: is they also like in in the original they called it like the gum tape death man, right?

740
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:42,293
Scott: Like oh shits.

741
00:53:42,634 --> 00:53:45,745
Scott: and then in the manga, it's like yeah, it's like the duck the duct tape race.

742
00:53:46,488 --> 00:53:46,929
Scott: I'm like what?

743
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:54,559
Rym: But really if you explain the concept to a person just out of the blue like hey How does this sound for an idea for a race?

744
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,390
Rym: they would say that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

745
00:53:58,051 --> 00:54:04,830
Rym: But somehow watching them explain it in this anime makes it sound like the most awesome crazy dangerous amazing thing ever.

746
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:06,115
Scott: Yeah, and it works.

747
00:54:06,858 --> 00:54:07,480
Rym: Well, it works.

748
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:07,982
Rym: All right.

749
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,006
Scott: Oh, it sure does man.

750
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:13,029
Rym: Alright, I didn't expect the show to go in some of the directions it did.

751
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:24,732
Scott: so that concludes the only time you will ever hear any anime podcaster praise initial D because I'm pretty sure everyone else hates this show and You might too, but we like it.

752
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,500
Rym: Yeah you yeah, you know what?

753
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:31,637
Rym: We don't make fun of you for your fist of the North Star or your great messenger.

754
00:54:31,657 --> 00:54:33,528
Scott: Yeah Oh, I don't know.

755
00:54:33,649 --> 00:54:35,200
Scott: I haven't actually seen those things.

756
00:54:35,662 --> 00:54:40,059
Scott: I like the idea of them, but I don't know if I'll actually like them when I watch them.

757
00:54:40,883 --> 00:54:43,134
Scott: Anyway, what are we gonna do tomorrow on the show?

758
00:54:43,837 --> 00:54:44,400
