1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,727
Scott: It's Monday July 16th.

2
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:12,473
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:14,460
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:18,517
Scott: tonight we give you our opinion on software piracy our.

5
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:25,397
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:34,800
Rym: Well, we're back from ConnectiCon and Surprisingly we can still talk.

7
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:37,759
Rym: Yeah, Scott's a little tired.

8
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:40,447
Rym: He's not actually sleeping.

9
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:46,420
Rym: you see one of the tricks in radio is that you can have sound effects But you can't see how we're making the sound effects.

10
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:49,953
Rym: So you see Scott's not actually asleep.

11
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:51,020
Rym: He's just sitting there going.

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,020
Rym: I guess that's more of a katsu snore, but you get the you get the drift.

13
00:00:56,342 --> 00:00:57,187
Scott: I don't even snore.

14
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:58,938
Scott: so the sound of me sleeping is like this.

15
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:02,078
Rym: No, you make noises like why?

16
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:02,259
Rym: like?

17
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:11,645
Rym: Anyway As you might all remember last year at Otakon We only did one pet.

18
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:21,040
Rym: well two panels at Otakon and just from all the other yelling throughout the weekend We lost our voices to the point of I was coughing up blood and we both had to medicate ourself coughing up blood.

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,366
Rym: I cough up blood fairly often.

20
00:01:22,627 --> 00:01:24,415
Scott: Yeah, you should go to a doctor about that.

21
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:25,480
Rym: No, it's it's a well-known.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,933
Rym: It's just my throat and my sinuses and all that garbage.

23
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:28,858
Rym: Uh-huh.

24
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:32,636
Scott: Yeah Yeah, if I have come up coughing up blood I go to the hospital.

25
00:01:32,677 --> 00:01:33,180
Scott: That's all I get.

26
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:40,083
Rym: No, I've coughed up blood as a kid and they said well your throat is irritated probably from talking too much and probably from a Post-nasal drip.

27
00:01:40,344 --> 00:01:43,795
Scott: all of those factors combined suck time to get a new throat.

28
00:01:44,277 --> 00:01:44,899
Rym: I'm working on that.

29
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:52,219
Rym: But I know we did seven panels at ConnectiCon and as you can hear I can still talk.

30
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,145
Scott: I can also still talk.

31
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:54,627
Scott: but that's cuz.

32
00:01:55,029 --> 00:02:02,300
Scott: some of the panels did not involve much talking and Most of the con I was not yelling like Otakon where basically I'm constantly yelling the whole weekend.

33
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:06,687
Rym: Yeah, I think the answer is I don't account I'm gonna wear earplugs pretty much for the entire.

34
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:16,235
Scott: that really helped me out a lot at katsukan was wearing earplugs because if you Wear earplugs that reduce say all noise that you hear by 20 decibels or so.

35
00:02:16,816 --> 00:02:18,060
Scott: You can still hear things.

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,679
Scott: I mean, I guess if a sound is under 20 decibels, you can't hear it.

37
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:28,450
Scott: but other than that, you can hear people talking to you enough and You don't you talk louder than what you hear.

38
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,444
Scott: So you're actually talking 20 decibels less, you know It's a psychological thing.

39
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:37,066
Scott: Like I will talk loud enough so that I think I could be heard over the noise I'm hearing.

40
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:40,839
Scott: so I'm hearing less noise I will talk less loud and thus save my voice.

41
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:54,059
Rym: but at the same time you wearing those headphones or those earplugs was actually pretty annoying because You pretty much didn't hear all the times when people called your name or needed you or talk to you And you just kind of sat there oblivious staring at things.

42
00:02:54,548 --> 00:03:04,340
Rym: Awesome All right, yeah, so this might be a short episode partly because we've got both I don't and enough downstairs reading our comics.

43
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,985
Scott: It's gonna be short episodes all week.

44
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:07,029
Scott: people get used to it.

45
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,216
Rym: And Emily's making us some bagel pizzas.

46
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:11,403
Scott: This is the annual Calm down.

47
00:03:11,443 --> 00:03:22,617
Rym: Yeah, you remember this week does not exist for us right now because we went to Connecticut last weekend And you mean yesterday and the day before yes, and this weekend starting Thursday morning.

48
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:23,680
Rym: We're driving to Otakon.

49
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:32,197
Scott: I only have to work two more days and then we're gone for ten day eleven days And then we're gonna be at the shore on our writers retreat until the Monday after that.

50
00:03:32,217 --> 00:03:38,808
Rym: Yep, and These three days I'm at work in body But my mind is already on the shore.

51
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:39,550
Rym: not even Otakon.

52
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,493
Rym: it skips Otakon and goes.

53
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:44,992
Scott: my mind is in the ocean going whoosh And it's playing DDR also the best part.

54
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:50,031
Rym: There's supposed to be a Gigantic thunderstorm pretty much all through Otakon and Wildwood.

55
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:52,758
Rym: that's gonna end right about as we go to the shore.

56
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:53,260
Scott: Awesome.

57
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:55,259
Rym: So that's gonna get rid of all the jellyfish.

58
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:58,127
Scott: It's also gonna get people wet at Otakon.

59
00:03:58,167 --> 00:03:59,911
Scott: bring your umbrellas to Otakon people.

60
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:03,320
Rym: Yes umbrellas, especially if you're going to the gecky gop panel.

61
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:08,215
Scott: Yeah, you want to bring a tart poncho for that one.

62
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:10,004
Scott: yeah ponchos Oh.

63
00:04:10,064 --> 00:04:17,670
Rym: and I do have to say I'm gonna mention this again on Wednesday, but Gerald doesn't have the high opinion of himself that I do apparently.

64
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,040
Rym: so I have to anti endorse what he's doing.

65
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:23,426
Rym: He's not doing anything special at the gecky gop panel.

66
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:28,500
Rym: In fact, he's planned 10 minutes of unfunny garbage for the end of our gecky gop panel.

67
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,880
Rym: Yeah, he's gonna sit there and be really lame apparently.

68
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:36,128
Scott: Okay Right.

69
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:36,899
Rym: So what he got in the news?

70
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,234
Scott: Apparently and this is this is New York Times here.

71
00:04:40,255 --> 00:04:46,739
Rym: This isn't bullshit All right, and apparently because the New York Times is the paragon of unbiased journalism.

72
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,159
Scott: Yes Well, no some guys wrote a book and there these are guys from the Boston University School of Law.

73
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:54,227
Scott: So this is this is something right?

74
00:04:54,468 --> 00:05:07,496
Scott: All right, the guys are named James Besson and Michael J Moirier, I guess M-E-U-R-E-R Moirier and The book they wrote was called do patents work question mark.

75
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:20,054
Scott: is the answer No, the answer is sometimes apparently in the pharmaceutical industry Right two-thirds of the revenues are attributable to patents.

76
00:05:20,717 --> 00:05:25,300
Scott: So without Patents drug companies are gonna lose two-thirds of their money.

77
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:31,539
Rym: Take that whoever it was in our forum who was trying to argue some crazy conspiracy about the drug companies.

78
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:41,140
Scott: Yes however Apparently in every other industry Just about every other industry, especially the IT industry.

79
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:42,143
Rym: I wonder why?

80
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:53,020
Rym: because a patent takes X years to expire but technology is useless or needs to be built upon and improved by other People I don't know about six months after gets come up and especially the IT industry.

81
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:55,700
Scott: But also money of rest about every other industry.

82
00:05:56,281 --> 00:06:13,840
Scott: it costs more to deal with patents than you earn from them all your patent lawyers and your patent workers and you're Spending money on filing the patents and dealing with them and licensing patents from other people Cost companies as a whole more money than they get from dealing with all that bullshit.

83
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:28,498
Rym: I could believe that because the one patent that I've got to my name that hasn't even been fully approved yet But it's still in the process and all that The amount of paperwork I had to deal with not even working at the company anymore Just to have my name on it.

84
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,665
Rym: It was kind of scary.

85
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:31,166
Rym: Yep.

86
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:38,926
Scott: So what these guys say basically is that in many industries, especially IT Patents do not make economic sense.

87
00:06:38,986 --> 00:06:43,719
Scott: However, their views are less radical than the guys at Washington University at st.

88
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,172
Scott: Louis The economists there who say the patent system should be abolished outright.

89
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:49,396
Scott: So they're not saying.

90
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:50,760
Scott: they're not saying get rid of patents.

91
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,426
Scott: They're saying wow patents are really fucked up.

92
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:56,375
Rym: What a rational and moderate opinion on the internet.

93
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:57,940
Scott: Oh, well, it's not on the Internet.

94
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:00,179
Scott: Oh, it's in a book of course by some professors.

95
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:09,200
Scott: Yes, so whenever you have to argue about patents with someone Or if you plan or argue about patents a lot get this book.

96
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,913
Scott: I'm actually gonna add this book to my wanted list on list all right now.

97
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:21,570
Rym: Yeah, so in other news I found this kind of interesting because I had no idea this was coming up and it frightens me that It's also the year of my birth, but apparently in July of 1982.

98
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,453
Rym: Hey, I wasn't alive then yet.

99
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:26,164
Scott: Yeah, no, I was more months.

100
00:07:26,284 --> 00:07:27,928
Rym: I was already alive.

101
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,813
Rym: I had been for a while.

102
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,758
Rym: Oh, man, you should respect your elders.

103
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:45,299
Rym: No Anyway, the first computer virus was created at least the first known computer virus and all it did I didn't even know about what this virus was is if it saw you using a floppy disk it Copied itself to the floppy disk.

104
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:46,103
Scott: That's it.

105
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:50,460
Rym: and then I guess it would infect the computer and then try to infect any other floppy disks.

106
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,252
Scott: Did it do anything?

107
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:53,319
Rym: No, it was just annoying.

108
00:07:54,441 --> 00:08:00,120
Scott: How is it annoying if it if it didn't do anything, you know how big that was compared to how little that floppy?

109
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:02,758
Scott: Ha ha excellent move.

110
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:07,592
Rym: Virus maker, I don't know but I must say that brought me back.

111
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:20,099
Rym: because viruses you see a lot of people say Oh a computer virus, but really there's a kind of specific nomenclature about viruses worms Trojans root kits all these different like kinds of malware now.

112
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:24,882
Rym: but back in the day they were basically just Trojans and Viruses.

113
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:27,292
Rym: and worms were like this mythical thing that everyone.

114
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:29,440
Scott: worms didn't happen until there was more networking.

115
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,464
Scott: You need networking to have.

116
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:32,530
Rym: worms didn't happen until Windows.

117
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:40,256
Scott: Well until Windows 95 and Internets then that oh and broadband Internet's not even with dial-up.

118
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:45,734
Scott: You didn't have worms yet, really Yeah, it wasn't until everyone had cable modems and everyone had Windows 98 or 2000 or XP.

119
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:49,607
Rym: But you see back in the day You couldn't.

120
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:51,180
Rym: the internet was a hundred percent safe.

121
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,372
Rym: Like you couldn't get a malware because there wasn't any.

122
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:56,220
Rym: there was no spyware out there.

123
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:57,726
Rym: There weren't any Trojans.

124
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:01,400
Rym: you didn't go to a website and they say download my thing, but it was actually a virus.

125
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,860
Rym: Viruses were usually things that hackers made that were funny and then they infected other people's computers with them.

126
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:12,760
Rym: I will note that I did this somewhat often because I actually had a virus collection.

127
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:22,356
Rym: Yeah I had a little box of floppy disk and each floppy had like the name of the virus and I had a little database of What they did and I thought they were really cool at the forum virus.

128
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,000
Rym: I had the ogre.

129
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:31,680
Scott: The ogre was bad news Back in the day when the original viruses are like the early viruses like Cookie Monster.

130
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:37,560
Scott: Yes, if you actually caught them for real like they actually infected you they would fuck you up.

131
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:37,882
Scott: They would.

132
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:40,820
Scott: the ochre virus destroyed your hard drive physically.

133
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:49,454
Rym: Well, what it did is it basically encrypted your hard drive bit by bit Also thrashing the drive as much as it could physically and that was it.

134
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:50,879
Rym: Yeah, there was no way out.

135
00:09:51,019 --> 00:10:01,880
Scott: now You know everyone who makes these malwares is actually they're not trying to hurt you They're just trying to profit in some way with their spyware or their spam Zombies or something like that.

136
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,660
Scott: They want to take over your computer and use it for their own means of making money, which I can understand.

137
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:11,620
Scott: But I wonder like how come there aren't any viruses that fuck up your computer?

138
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:18,740
Scott: You think there'd be at least one guy riding a virus that would just format everyone's hard drive Of course at the same time with well at least on Linux that's really hard to do.

139
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,031
Rym: But yeah in Windows, it'd be really easy to do that.

140
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:24,688
Scott: I always wondered like remember What was that one that like you want to know why?

141
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:33,590
Rym: I think the easy answer is simply that Back when people were writing viruses just for the you know The hell of it there was no real financial incentive.

142
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,443
Rym: people wrote a virus to see if they could do it or to be a Shitcocker.

143
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:39,692
Scott: it wasn't for any other reason but there aren't.

144
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:41,460
Scott: you're saying there aren't shit cockers anymore.

145
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:52,380
Rym: No I'm saying that the shit cockers don't have the ability to ride modern viruses and anyone who has the ability to ride a virus Would much rather write spam software and make a pile of money.

146
00:10:52,440 --> 00:11:00,587
Scott: Yeah I just really wish that one person would go out and write a big virus that will infect the world and format all the hard Drives that would actually know.

147
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,660
Rym: my idea for a virus like that is so much more sinister.

148
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:13,996
Rym: okay, I would make a worm or a virus that went around and infected everyone as subtly as possible and what it would do is look for any Excel spreadsheets access databases and anything

149
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:15,520
Scott: word documents and just

150
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,802
Rym: Randomly change a few numbers and a few words In all of them.

151
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:22,244
Rym: and that's it.

152
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:27,030
Scott: I would have it like slowly like degrade them over time.

153
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:34,125
Scott: So like at first it would change a word or a letter and then it would change some other things and eventually the whole thing would become a complete mess.

154
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:35,290
Scott: and it would like encrypt things.

155
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:43,900
Scott: and like if it saw a Word document being saved it would immediately like go and change like five words in the thing you just saved.

156
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:46,989
Scott: Yeah, or if it saw something being printed it would might.

157
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:50,880
Scott: it would put some spelling errors into it in between the software and the printer.

158
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:55,200
Scott: So you'd it would look right in your document, but when you printed it, it would get it would be wrong.

159
00:11:55,581 --> 00:12:02,493
Rym: So I think part of it also was that a lot of kids back then who were into hacking and whatever would make Viruses to try to like bust up all their friends.

160
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:03,740
Rym: and then that's how it originated.

161
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:05,691
Rym: Yeah, and also most of the viruses.

162
00:12:05,732 --> 00:12:11,143
Rym: while there were bad ones like the ogre Most of them were really benign or kind of funny like.

163
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:23,131
Rym: I actually got infected with a Virus way back in the day when I went to Starbase camp and I took a. someone gave me a copy of xcom mission UFO and on one of the discs was the form virus.

164
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:24,776
Rym: and you know the form virus.

165
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:26,020
Rym: did you know what it did to me?

166
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,323
Rym: And I didn't even know.

167
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:29,820
Rym: I had it for the longest time and I had the effects happen.

168
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,298
Rym: But I had no idea that such a thing as a virus existed.

169
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:40,992
Rym: on The 18th day of every month if you had a US keyboard, you know Like keyboard setting was set to us every time you hit a key.

170
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:44,681
Rym: The PC speaker would go click Huh?

171
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:46,146
Rym: Okay, that was it.

172
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:48,093
Rym: That was all it did.

173
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:49,900
Rym: I had it for years.

174
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:54,696
Rym: When I found out what it was I isolated I put it on a floppy and I kept it cuz.

175
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:55,680
Rym: I thought that was really cool.

176
00:12:56,161 --> 00:12:57,205
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

177
00:12:57,787 --> 00:13:00,496
Rym: Then I remember I used to Saran wrap or dice up.

178
00:13:00,657 --> 00:13:02,720
Rym: I'm not gonna get into this I'll do a show about it someday.

179
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:11,960
Rym: But I've uh, I used to make discs that were basically trojan horses to steal Documents from people and then infect them with backdoors so I could go steal the rest of the documents.

180
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:15,471
Rym: Haha, I only ever used him on my one friend in middle school.

181
00:13:15,852 --> 00:13:18,180
Rym: Haha, and all I ever got were his homeworks.

182
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,868
Rym: Thing is he wasn't really that smart.

183
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:25,956
Rym: so it's not like I could steal his homework.

184
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:26,880
Scott: deleted his homeworks.

185
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:27,702
Rym: I wasn't.

186
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:29,227
Rym: I wasn't gonna be a griefer.

187
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,173
Rym: I was just I wanted to be a hacker.

188
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:32,035
Rym: hacking was cool.

189
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:33,580
Rym: I'd seen war games.

190
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,514
Rym: Oh, man, I really wanted to be a hacker, but I wasn't gonna decide.

191
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:38,437
Scott: I don't play tic-tac-toe.

192
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:39,200
Scott: What was your problem?

193
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,785
Rym: I wasn't good enough to really be a hacker.

194
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:42,612
Scott: They were good enough to win a tic-tac-toe.

195
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:56,828
Rym: I guess well depends on if I started Things of the day Things of the day.

196
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,075
Rym: So, uh, you want to go first?

197
00:13:58,175 --> 00:13:58,920
Rym: Usually I go first.

198
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:07,948
Scott: Alright this thing of the day is sort of torn on because it's a really good idea and it is Successfully executed.

199
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:10,300
Scott: but it is a poor execution.

200
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:17,220
Scott: Basically what this is is the mashup of lolcats and dig not that those weren't mashed together already.

201
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:19,286
Rym: Kind of mash them more.

202
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,350
Scott: Yes, basically.

203
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,152
Scott: It's a website.

204
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:32,108
Scott: you are you go to the website and The website takes the dig headlines and for every dig headline it automatically generates a lolcat.

205
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:38,990
Scott: and it's sort of like it just takes all the headlines from the front page of dig and Makes a bunch of lolcats in the same order.

206
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:41,260
Scott: So you go to the website and there's a bunch of lolcats.

207
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,089
Scott: But that's a great idea.

208
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:50,140
Scott: That's like genius like super genius But it just chooses the cats at random and puts the text on there and the same font.

209
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:56,939
Rym: So it's just totally nonsensical and not in the good way that lolcats normally are but in this really kind of not funny way.

210
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:07,357
Scott: Yeah Because the thing about a lolcat right that you have to understand is that the words go with the expression of the cat for example Invisible invisible bicycle, right?

211
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,651
Rym: It's a cat and it kind of looks like he's riding an invisible bicycle.

212
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:23,820
Scott: or oh really the the it's not even a lolcat it's a lol owl, but it's Oh really an owl that looks like he's asking oh really so You know what?

213
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:29,160
Rym: I haven't seen him in a while and I just kind of cracked up because I suddenly remembered how awesome that owl is.

214
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:32,040
Scott: Yeah, is that owl actually dead or is it still a rumor?

215
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,900
Rym: I heard that the owl had died.

216
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,634
Rym: But then I heard that the hearing the owl had died was a rumor.

217
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:37,800
Rym: then I heard that it really died.

218
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,839
Rym: Then I heard that that was just a Damon Wayans.

219
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,959
Scott: So, I don't know I don't know but I'm gonna find an owl like that at some zoo or something and we'll look at it.

220
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:47,510
Scott: Just cuz I want to see one of those owls.

221
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,420
Scott: but like for example, here's a headline.

222
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:55,720
Scott: There's a headline on dig top 10 worst web app names and this is just a picture of a cat looking at you.

223
00:15:56,261 --> 00:15:57,767
Rym: Now see what they would they should have had.

224
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,253
Rym: is that you're doing it wrong cat.

225
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,500
Rym: Mmm, that would have fit Yep.

226
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:10,020
Scott: So if there was some way that someone was like Manually choosing the cats from like a set of cats to go with the headlines This could be much funnier.

227
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:24,200
Rym: Maybe if we you someone did it manually for a while and you tagged cats based on categories and then you could have some sort of filter or Marginal AI that would look at the words in a headline and guess at the best lolcat based on an algorithm

228
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:31,611
Scott: Something like that, but as it is, it's a very great idea and it's it's ingenious But the humor of lolcats is lost.

229
00:16:31,972 --> 00:16:40,820
Rym: So, uh riddle me this Scott Did you ever ever in your life up until today think that you would use the word genius and the word lolcat?

230
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:42,299
Rym: in the same sentence?

231
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,644
Scott: I Didn't think.

232
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:53,877
Scott: no I did not think in advance that you know I will never use those words in a sentence or that I will.

233
00:16:53,897 --> 00:16:55,979
Scott: I Just didn't think about it at all.

234
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:57,458
Scott: It was not something that came to mind.

235
00:16:58,022 --> 00:17:05,142
Scott: But if you told me in the if in the if five days ago you told me I was gonna do that I would say oh maybe That was.

236
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:07,971
Rym: I've never seen someone ruin a joke.

237
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:08,654
Rym: So thoroughly.

238
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:10,540
Rym: Yeah, I don't know what I can say to that.

239
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,646
Scott: That's sort of like what this thing of the day is.

240
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:15,337
Scott: is that this great joke of lolcats is ruined.

241
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:18,573
Rym: now the big question Was that intentional or was that a save?

242
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,720
Scott: that was a save?

243
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,733
Rym: Oh, cuz you should have said it was intentional because then it would have been perfect.

244
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:23,920
Scott: No, it's intentional.

245
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,983
Scott: That means you planned it out.

246
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,920
Rym: Oh, we're so spontaneous and hip that we just kind of come up with things like that on the fly.

247
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,945
Rym: I see where you're going with this.

248
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,260
Scott: Yeah, I actually did just come up with a save, right?

249
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,660
Rym: So, uh in other news in my thing of the day all the ducks are swimming in the water.

250
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:44,123
Scott: Well, no some of the Ducks like fly around and some of them kind of walk around and those weren't ducks Those were other animals.

251
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:47,396
Rym: The Ducks were in the water right up until they start dancing.

252
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:48,300
Scott: What?

253
00:17:51,381 --> 00:17:52,505
Rym: You've seen my thing of the day.

254
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:53,610
Rym: you can't pretend you haven't.

255
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,072
Scott: I know.

256
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:56,221
Scott: I know but I was gonna make some joke about duck Cut.

257
00:17:56,301 --> 00:18:02,840
Rym: yeah, this is the week of me using things the day that other people have given me partly because oh, they're not on the day.

258
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,047
Rym: Did you do what?

259
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:07,650
Scott: did he do duty?

260
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:10,215
Rym: did it that's Hogan's Alley?

261
00:18:11,117 --> 00:18:11,518
Rym: Oh, it's not.

262
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:15,522
Rym: Oh, yeah, it's not Good thing.

263
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:18,553
Rym: I didn't do that on a Tuesday where Dave and Joel would say something about that.

264
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:19,115
Rym: Yeah.

265
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:31,979
Rym: All right, so so Our dear friend I know who was downstairs right now watching Zazan Jotaro with an off and Emily If you haven't heard our show about that even you hate anime you should check that out.

266
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:37,725
Rym: Yes, yeah, really But but sex.

267
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:41,800
Rym: she told me about this video a long time ago, and I just never got around to rot watching it.

268
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,130
Rym: so now she's here.

269
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:53,960
Rym: she forced me to watch it and It's fairly awesome And I'd recommend that you not only watch this but watch many if not all of the related videos by the same person.

270
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,351
Scott: What is it like lemon jelly?

271
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:56,380
Rym: I think something like that.

272
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:07,740
Scott: It seemed I can't really tell what it is and I'm not gonna look it up because I'm lazy But it seems like it's a musical group and all their music videos are sort of Psychedelic animations of some sort which is cool.

273
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:14,854
Rym: I like those and I want to know from all of you when you watch the first one the one I'm actually linking to Who is that person?

274
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:15,779
Scott: isn't a?

275
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:24,987
Scott: Karl Marx be Santa Claus or see Alan Moore or D.

276
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:28,196
Rym: all of the above see from the wrong angle.

277
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:29,480
Rym: It could be Rasputin, too.

278
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:31,026
Scott: No, it can't be Rasputin.

279
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:33,676
Scott: Rasputin had a narrower longer darker beard.

280
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,560
Scott: Yeah, but it could have been.

281
00:19:35,862 --> 00:19:37,629
Rym: He was shot stab poison whatever.

282
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:40,559
Rym: This is after the fact when he crawled out of the ladies all swollen.

283
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:43,043
Rym: See he didn't die.

284
00:19:43,063 --> 00:19:45,591
Rym: He just crawled out of that lake and he became Karl Marx.

285
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:52,920
Scott: Yeah, you know that would explain a lot Right both of them actually lived at the same time.

286
00:19:53,121 --> 00:20:03,033
Rym: So I think I'm just gonna point out at this point once again that it's been a long weekend And it's gonna be a long week If Rasputin and Karl Marx lived at the same time.

287
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:09,540
Rym: Oh anyway Anyway, it's so tonight Monday we were gonna cop out.

288
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:17,880
Rym: I didn't want to do a show cuz I'm tired and I got stuff to do with people over there downstairs right now Even though Scott seemed to question whether or not enough could actually use the man.

289
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,889
Scott: No, I just didn't think he knew the shortcut the keyboard shortcut.

290
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:24,380
Rym: Yeah, you're like hits face to make the movie go.

291
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,000
Scott: Okay, the beginning of Rasputin's life overlapped the end of Marx's life.

292
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,934
Rym: So therefore it is possible that with some trickery they could have been the same person.

293
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:33,556
Scott: They could have been.

294
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:41,040
Rym: anyway tonight We were gonna cop out and then we're gonna do a special but Scott agreed to take care of all the posting business on the website.

295
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,524
Scott: No, I didn't.

296
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:42,049
Scott: Yeah, you did.

297
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:42,553
Scott: No, I didn't.

298
00:20:42,795 --> 00:20:47,316
Rym: very clearly I said we'll only do the full show if you'll do the post I have witness.

299
00:20:47,336 --> 00:20:48,280
Scott: We're not doing a full show.

300
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,902
Scott: We're gonna do it short ready here Already.

301
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:56,013
Rym: a full show if we got things of the day and the news and a main bit It's a full show unless we stop right now.

302
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,118
Rym: It's a full show.

303
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:06,140
Rym: What if I just don't make the post then the show doesn't go off and you just wasted all this time.

304
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:18,260
Rym: So tonight we're talking about wares because it's come up in our forums a couple of times and it's come up in my life recently When I tried to wear something for the first time in many many years and I learned something about the wares industry.

305
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:22,940
Scott: Yeah, basically, uh, you know we talked about how our war is if you're a loser.

306
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:27,657
Scott: We talked about how we use Reza on for our podcast and we talked about how cool edit is the bomb.

307
00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:39,413
Scott: and you know Someone said, you know Hey, I just wanted to let you know you can get cool edit pro from this torrent here, right and I was like, yeah Thanks That's great.

308
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,030
Scott: basically We have sort of a weird opinion of where is that?

309
00:21:45,151 --> 00:21:51,131
Scott: I don't know how congruent it is with anyone else's But mostly because we are so open source granted.

310
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:53,540
Rym: I used to be real big into software power.

311
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:55,428
Scott: I used to not give two shits.

312
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:58,220
Scott: I used to feel about software piracy the way I felt about music.

313
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,693
Scott: I was like man, you can't be charged in this much for software.

314
00:22:01,874 --> 00:22:03,440
Scott: people need the software to do stuff.

315
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,108
Scott: There's no there's no alternative.

316
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,514
Scott: I'm just gonna take it.

317
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:07,680
Scott: I don't give a crap.

318
00:22:07,981 --> 00:22:13,260
Scott: It's so easy, you know, and I just copy my friends Wolfenstein disc and off we go.

319
00:22:13,461 --> 00:22:15,008
Rym: Yeah, actually it's kind of funny.

320
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:29,519
Rym: the first wares I ever got Wolfenstein 3d we're a xcom mission UFO and tie fighter an x-wing and I think a couple other games and I Didn't even it didn't even dawn on me that it was in any way shady or illegal or anything.

321
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:32,878
Scott: Literally didn't realize it was illegal to copy the Wolfenstein 3d.

322
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,499
Rym: I've had this day camp like this.

323
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:41,828
Rym: It's like mini space camp at the Air National Guard base where I grew up and I'm there and I meet this really cool guy And he's all like computer.

324
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:44,922
Rym: hackery like he's on the BBS is a lot more than I am like.

325
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:55,938
Rym: he actually would die a long distance or he'd hop from BBS to BBS to do the long-distance call for free and I Pretty much just dialed like the two twenty four hundred BPS ones that were bought.

326
00:22:56,721 --> 00:22:59,574
Rym: I guess that were in the area that I could actually connect to that.

327
00:22:59,594 --> 00:23:00,659
Rym: My parents wouldn't yell at me for.

328
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:04,310
Rym: And uh, he says hey you ever play blah.

329
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:05,133
Rym: and I said what?

330
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:05,455
Rym: no.

331
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:06,900
Rym: and he says oh crap.

332
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,571
Rym: And he just gives me all these floppies.

333
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:09,859
Rym: He says just install these games.

334
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:11,450
Rym: One of them had a virus on it.

335
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,934
Rym: But other than that, haha I I didn't even think until.

336
00:23:15,055 --> 00:23:29,525
Rym: like years later I went to a store and I saw games for sale for the computer and I was like, oh Oh When you put in the doom shareware and it said hey call this number Yeah, and I said, you know what?

337
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:31,471
Rym: I'm content with playing the shareware part.

338
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:32,474
Scott: Yeah me too.

339
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:38,888
Scott: And then I paid for doom - yeah I just borrowed my friends doom - Yeah, good days.

340
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:54,014
Scott: so back in the day when Open-source wasn't so awesome And I was mostly playing DOS games and using Windows 3.1 and you needed some sort of non free software to do just about anything I mean there was a day when you could buy Internet Explorer.

341
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:54,999
Scott: There was a day.

342
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:58,880
Scott: There was a day when you could buy Netscape navigator in a box for money.

343
00:23:59,241 --> 00:23:59,422
Scott: Right.

344
00:23:59,984 --> 00:24:09,717
Scott: and in those days when you know, even it was pretty much shareware or payware I didn't really have qualms about you know, pirating software because it was easy.

345
00:24:09,737 --> 00:24:10,700
Scott: It was safe.

346
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,024
Scott: Everyone did it.

347
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,374
Scott: No one no one even knew it was wrong or bad or anything.

348
00:24:15,394 --> 00:24:18,960
Scott: or they just didn't care or they just didn't Care, I mean it was just common.

349
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:22,761
Scott: Everyone would buy software and just install it on every computer of everyone They knew.

350
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:33,120
Rym: like for example, I've never in my life met a person who actually registered scorched earth Yeah, but I knew a lot of people who somehow had the registered version.

351
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:36,268
Rym: I wonder how or I think another one was.

352
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:40,560
Rym: there's the game called stunts 40 racing and had a bunch of different other names.

353
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:48,145
Rym: this game as far as I can tell was installed on almost every computer at every school in the Midwest and There's floppies of it everywhere.

354
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:50,695
Rym: It was a great racing game super 3d years.

355
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:58,219
Rym: Well 40 now and Every version of it I ever saw had a loading screen that said cracked by kill fit.

356
00:25:00,061 --> 00:25:07,639
Rym: And then it is there and then every time I played it would pop up a screen saying like what's the fourth word on the Third page, but no matter what you type to let you play?

357
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:09,163
Rym: And I never.

358
00:25:09,184 --> 00:25:13,019
Rym: I didn't really quite make the connect that kill fit didn't make that game.

359
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,264
Rym: Cracking was not writing.

360
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:18,151
Rym: software cracking was something far more sinister.

361
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:20,738
Rym: Yeah, I've never seen a legitimate copy of that game.

362
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:34,455
Scott: Wow Anyway, so in those days piracy was cool and then and I started doing the open-source stuff and Also other things started becoming free that you know weren't necessarily open-source.

363
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:38,530
Scott: web browsers are free You know, you can get a video playing software for free.

364
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:43,326
Scott: You can audio editing software for free Right, and it was all legally free.

365
00:25:43,346 --> 00:25:45,753
Scott: and I was still pirating music and such.

366
00:25:45,833 --> 00:26:00,288
Scott: but everything else was still pirate music Yeah, but everything else was becoming free Legally, so so I just it wasn't that I was still any any against software piracy You know or that I was for it.

367
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:08,016
Scott: It's just that the need to pirate software vanished and With it the caring about software piracy.

368
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:14,913
Rym: Yep I mean I used to really care about wares and I'd hang out on wares forums I'd look for new stuff and I'd upgrade my wares.

369
00:26:15,355 --> 00:26:29,720
Rym: and actually I remember at RIT I pirated a lot of things just because The school had licenses for a lot of software that we needed to do our homework and our labs and or whatever in the labs All the way on the other side of the school and the labs there's plenty of space.

370
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:40,283
Rym: I just didn't want to walk over there in the cold But I could just pirate all the software and then I didn't have to walk over there and I could just do my homework in My dorm room.

371
00:26:40,945 --> 00:26:45,040
Rym: so I had copies of like director 7 and flash 3 and fireworks 3 and all that.

372
00:26:45,501 --> 00:26:56,619
Scott: Yeah, the thing is for me to do my homework in my dorm room actually required more free software more open-source software and Proprietary software didn't help me do my homework in my room at all.

373
00:26:57,822 --> 00:26:59,419
Rym: So not that we did much homework.

374
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:01,518
Rym: That was a total cop-out job.

375
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:05,700
Rym: I played around with fireworks on my own a lot more than I ever did class work with it.

376
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,563
Rym: So I can't pretend.

377
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,755
Rym: Oh, it was for academic purposes only.

378
00:27:09,776 --> 00:27:10,920
Scott: I mean a freshman year.

379
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:11,966
Scott: I pirated some games.

380
00:27:12,027 --> 00:27:14,120
Scott: I mean technically actually my car.

381
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,544
Scott: I had a copy of half-life 1.

382
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:22,226
Scott: I got in high school from some kid who basically copied his CD and gave me his key For like 10 bucks.

383
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:25,720
Scott: I actually paid for it as opposed to buying you for 50 bucks.

384
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:27,105
Scott: See actually I was poor.

385
00:27:27,427 --> 00:27:37,078
Rym: while I pirated a fair number of games when I was younger I other than like stunts and scorched earth and la checks and all those ancient ancient games for the company.

386
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:42,920
Rym: if I didn't even exist Anymore I actually did in the end buy legitimate copies of all of those games.

387
00:27:43,105 --> 00:27:53,540
Scott: Yeah But then I had half-life 1 and I had this kids key basically and I played that and then I used that up until College and I got counter-strike and then when steam came along, right?

388
00:27:53,860 --> 00:28:12,460
Scott: I because I had the legitimate half-life 1 it was automatically added to my steam and then I didn't need that half-life 1 or that Key anymore, so I just tossed it and now half-life 1 is permanently in my steam Even though I never actually Legitimately played for half-life 1. but I did pay for half-life 2 and a whole bunch of other games on steam.

389
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:13,792
Scott: So I I think I'm alright.

390
00:28:13,954 --> 00:28:14,196
Scott: Yeah.

391
00:28:14,438 --> 00:28:18,419
Rym: Yeah See the thing is steam pretty much as much as a lot of people hate it.

392
00:28:18,861 --> 00:28:25,840
Rym: It works pretty well now and more importantly it ended the idea of pirating games on computers at least those kinds of games.

393
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:34,694
Scott: Yeah I mean there's no need to pirate a game Because the whole idea of firing a game was I can get the game now I can get the game conveniently and I want to go to a store.

394
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:39,320
Scott: you don't have to deal with CDs I don't have to deal with keys and I don't have to pay money bullshit, right?

395
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,799
Rym: And you don't have to pay money and you have to pay money with steam.

396
00:28:42,383 --> 00:28:52,078
Scott: All those problems are also solved except you still have to pay money but in many cases the money is trivial or the money is taken so easily that it doesn't bother?

397
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:56,941
Scott: you like for me to pay the 10 bucks to get like uplink and Darwinia?

398
00:28:56,982 --> 00:28:59,653
Scott: it was like whatever click sure credit.

399
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:01,100
Scott: It was like getting Scott for free.

400
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:10,410
Rym: could it be that our perspective on the money in the software piracy is somewhat Formed or shaped by the fact that as we have gotten older.

401
00:29:10,451 --> 00:29:13,140
Rym: We've had ever-increasing amounts of money at our disposal?

402
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,860
Scott: I think it has because let me get to my next example.

403
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:20,320
Rym: I remember when I like I tribes - I had to own it like there was no question.

404
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:20,701
Rym: That was.

405
00:29:21,263 --> 00:29:26,580
Rym: that was the biggest fucking game when it came out and it was the biggest fucking game right up until they ruined it.

406
00:29:27,383 --> 00:29:28,930
Rym: And I still look back upon the days.

407
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,100
Rym: I played that game as some of the best gaming I've ever had.

408
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:38,180
Scott: Yeah, but fifty five bucks was a lot of money and I didn't have became free and is now unplayable.

409
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,395
Rym: But even then I didn't have fifty five dollars.

410
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:44,985
Rym: I had to forego Necessary things to play that game.

411
00:29:45,045 --> 00:29:46,048
Scott: I didn't but that's all right.

412
00:29:46,088 --> 00:29:47,914
Rym: Well, I was a lot poorer than you were.

413
00:29:48,415 --> 00:30:00,043
Scott: anyway to prove you right, actually nowadays, we don't need to pirate software because we use all this free software at happy times, but Recently, we have become very Productive.

414
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:04,860
Scott: we've been trying to make a lot of things and for most things we want to make we use free software.

415
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:07,060
Scott: I mean I could write programs in open source.

416
00:30:07,361 --> 00:30:24,834
Scott: you know compilers and languages and Linux and I can use resound to make my podcast and upload it to my WordPress blog on my Linux hosting with my Apache web server and use feed burner, which is free and everything, you know Libsyn I pay for and the hosting I pay for but that's not software.

417
00:30:24,854 --> 00:30:25,759
Scott: That's just a service.

418
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:32,519
Scott: But now we've actually said hey we kind of want to try to make some stuff with flash.

419
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:37,948
Scott: and well flash is According to the Adobe website.

420
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:44,411
Scott: when I checked this morning if I checked correctly $700 retail but I've got that copy of flash 3.

421
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:45,073
Rym: we could use that.

422
00:30:45,354 --> 00:30:46,217
Scott: No, that's no good.

423
00:30:46,237 --> 00:30:50,420
Rym: I've also got a action 2.1 and 3.0.

424
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,518
Scott: Yeah That's good.

425
00:30:53,323 --> 00:31:03,455
Scott: So now I'm sort of torn here because it's like, you know for $700 that's like a shit ton of money right there even for that's like.

426
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,400
Scott: I could get a computer for that much money.

427
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,094
Rym: Well, the thing is that's more money than we paid for that fancy pants Marantz.

428
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:09,495
Scott: Yeah.

429
00:31:09,676 --> 00:31:14,002
Scott: Okay, here you go flash cs3 professional by us $6.99.

430
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:17,579
Scott: on the adobe.com product slash flash.

431
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:20,869
Scott: But then again upgrade from the previous version $1.99.

432
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:24,440
Rym: the way I look at that which previous version they won't accept flash?

433
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,224
Scott: It says upgrade from us $1.99.

434
00:31:26,224 --> 00:31:29,392
Scott: Ah, yeah Oh download free trial.

435
00:31:29,412 --> 00:31:30,034
Scott: Maybe I'll do that.

436
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:33,445
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, I Forgot what I was gonna say.

437
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:43,300
Scott: Yes, but I think that part of our Willingness to pirate before was a need for software that we couldn't really afford in order to get what we needed done.

438
00:31:43,621 --> 00:31:50,568
Scott: You know, it's like if you need to do something and there are tools to do it and you don't have those tools But you need to do that thing.

439
00:31:50,588 --> 00:31:51,875
Scott: You need to get this job done.

440
00:31:51,955 --> 00:31:52,920
Scott: You don't have a screwdriver.

441
00:31:53,460 --> 00:32:01,200
Scott: You're gonna probably be willing to steal a screwdriver Especially when you don't have to physically steal a screwdriver and you can just copy someone else's screwdriver.

442
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:09,715
Scott: So then when you're able to get the tools for free legally You have no need to steal because you're getting everything you want done and you don't care.

443
00:32:09,756 --> 00:32:10,960
Scott: so you don't even think about stealing.

444
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:24,299
Scott: But now when you want another job done and the only tool is a very expensive tool stealing comes back to mind and I'm not so sure if I think it's right or wrong to take it.

445
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:36,796
Rym: I think the real answer is going to be very simple and has nothing to do with ethics And I'm going to recount to all of you the story of when I went back into the wares world Kind of as an expedition when I made my new computer.

446
00:32:36,816 --> 00:32:37,218
Rym: Mm-hmm.

447
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:40,620
Rym: So back in the day wares was safe.

448
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:42,679
Rym: It was actually safe.

449
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:53,718
Rym: Never did a wares cause any problems and I would have known because I pay a lot of attention to the packets that come in And out of my computer some wares were unstable like you would get a wares and it wouldn't work.

450
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:55,527
Rym: quite right Yeah, but they were there were.

451
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:57,800
Rym: there was almost no malicious wares.

452
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,680
Rym: It was very difficult to find a piece of wares that had malware in it.

453
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:11,795
Scott: If I downloaded a free a game that was pirated in some RAR file and got the ISO burned it and installed it 99% chance that game was not a virus.

454
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:21,199
Rym: now I went on to the Pirate Bay and a bunch of other places that downloaded a whole bunch of torrents of like Audition even though I don't actually really like audition that much and I wouldn't have used it.

455
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,460
Scott: Audition only works if you have the fancy digital mixer and stuff to go with it to do the multitrack.

456
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:39,172
Rym: But I downloaded like eight or nine different programs from various wares sites and they were all cracked by different people in different like different groups and Every single one of them was chock-full of malware.

457
00:33:39,674 --> 00:33:45,569
Rym: every single one compromised my windows box Horribly and like one of them.

458
00:33:45,629 --> 00:33:48,802
Rym: I think the worst was I installed a copy of Audition.

459
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:58,978
Rym: this one was worse than all the others and I had my firewall and my ethereal everything ready to see what it tried to Do and it immediately tried to connect to like 2,000 different IP addresses.

460
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:02,149
Rym: Wow Like immediately it flooded our network.

461
00:34:02,731 --> 00:34:06,924
Scott: See I wonder now is it companies like Adobe and stuff?

462
00:34:07,024 --> 00:34:12,480
Scott: maybe they're the ones putting viruses wares out there to discourage people from pirating their own stuff?

463
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,049
Rym: No, because they have other software piracy prevention things.

464
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,174
Rym: I think it's very simple.

465
00:34:16,676 --> 00:34:17,217
Rym: It's all.

466
00:34:17,257 --> 00:34:17,860
Rym: it's all spam.

467
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:26,268
Rym: I think almost all of it are people paid to write software to infect computers Whatever way they can to become spam bots.

468
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,440
Scott: Hmm, and that benefits Adobe somehow.

469
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:39,871
Scott: Yeah, pretty much one of the Adobe and Microsoft and I guess, you know AutoCAD company with Autodesk or whatever It makes Studio Max and all such.

470
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,699
Scott: and then I remember Autodesk makes Maya.

471
00:34:42,022 --> 00:34:44,780
Rym: Oh, I did have a pirated copy of Autodesk animator back in the day.

472
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:56,000
Scott: Yeah, but I mean there aren't too many companies left, you know Besides Adobe slash macromedia that are still selling the big expensive proprietary software to a lot of people.

473
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:02,748
Scott: It's pretty much Microsoft Adobe and who else makes Nero, but that's like 50 bucks That's that's worth it too, cuz it's good.

474
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:05,400
Scott: You can actually a Nero Linux for 20 bucks and it's awesome.

475
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,675
Rym: Well, there's things like the Lotus sweets and all the business II stuff, but no one uses the Lotus sweet.

476
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:10,578
Rym: Yes, they do.

477
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:11,858
Scott: Why?

478
00:35:12,721 --> 00:35:13,848
Rym: Don't get me started.

479
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:15,599
Scott: Oh you worked at IBM, but where else?

480
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:18,251
Rym: Yeah, I could pull it up again.

481
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,919
Scott: It's Oracle is still selling it.

482
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:25,720
Rym: Actually Scott we had a list at IBM of all the companies that use it and it's a lot of big names.

483
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,028
Scott: Scary you sure it's not like.

484
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:30,722
Scott: they just have it on one computer so that they could be on the list I'm sure.

485
00:35:30,823 --> 00:35:31,406
Scott: are you sure they don't?

486
00:35:31,446 --> 00:35:32,350
Scott: they have a service contract?

487
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,636
Scott: They don't use I'm sure.

488
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:39,120
Rym: I'm sure I've also learned that a lot of law firms use a lot of really weird office suites.

489
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:46,960
Scott: Yes, they're actually, you know, there are lots of companies out there that do make proprietary expensive piratable software But it's not something anyone wants.

490
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,665
Scott: It's just something only businesses want.

491
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:53,440
Scott: so it doesn't get pirated very often and when it does you get caught cuz you're a business.

492
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,140
Rym: I Mean we talked about this in the first half of the show.

493
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,227
Rym: It just comes down to the fact that spam is the.

494
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:03,666
Rym: the fundamental problem of everything on the internet now comes down to spam As everything come down to spam.

495
00:36:03,706 --> 00:36:05,110
Scott: I don't think so, but a lot of things.

496
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:07,920
Rym: well thing is spam comes down to insecure windows boxes.

497
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:10,630
Rym: Yeah, so that's the core of the internet right now.

498
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:13,080
Scott: It could be it could be I don't know.

499
00:36:13,642 --> 00:36:14,967
Rym: I don't have any real point.

500
00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:18,240
Rym: I'm just kind of talking to fill out this episode so I can go to bed.

501
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,749
Scott: Yes, I guess our stance on piracy.

502
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,151
Scott: Is that?

503
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:23,500
Scott: I guess it's kind of not okay.

504
00:36:24,207 --> 00:36:35,463
Scott: but at the same time It sort of sucks that people need to be able to do things with their computers And the only way to do it is with an expensive piece of software that no one can afford And they don't have.

505
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:37,289
Scott: like his is there like Photoshop.

506
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:42,344
Scott: Photoshop is something a lot of people need to do things and there aren't really Alternatives that fit the bill.

507
00:36:42,565 --> 00:36:45,152
Rym: Yeah, well you could use the gimp if you're a masochist.

508
00:36:45,212 --> 00:36:50,279
Scott: and there there are cheaper versions of Photoshop but they're still really expensive and they're really hindered.

509
00:36:50,299 --> 00:37:02,180
Scott: and Obviously, you know the people who are professional artists whatever they can afford and they need to afford and they will buy The full version of Photoshop and every upgrade for full price, right?

510
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:16,209
Scott: But by remarketing the product to those people which is I guess the correct market other people who need the same tool Right, but can't afford to pay aren't getting it at a price that they can afford.

511
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:31,197
Scott: it's like they had to pay the professional price or pirate and It seems like it the companies aren't doing enough to accommodate those people like sure sell your Microsoft Vista for $250 for every computer into a business, but let the home users pay 50 bucks.

512
00:37:31,357 --> 00:37:34,069
Scott: All right, come on You're making already a zillion dollars.

513
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:35,616
Scott: You're not making it off the home users.

514
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:36,159
Scott: That's for sure.

515
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:39,680
Rym: But how do you set it up so that the businesses don't just buy the home user version?

516
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:50,587
Scott: Because what you do is you take you find those features Right that only the professionals are only the businesses use and that they desperately need But that the home users will never use.

517
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,900
Rym: but like why I take those features out like what like an audio program.

518
00:37:54,362 --> 00:37:55,308
Rym: Everyone needs everything.

519
00:37:55,348 --> 00:38:01,839
Scott: All right for Photoshop you could take out Cmyk right because home users don't need the CMYK.

520
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,326
Rym: I don't know a lot of hobbyists or what.

521
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:19,454
Rym: if you're trying to learn the software or you want to learn about that stuff You're in school and a much better way and What you could do is just you know you have the cheaper versions or the free versions even to get people to use your software, but Now maybe digital watermarking is one way.

522
00:38:19,474 --> 00:38:25,120
Rym: but another way is simply a Contractual thing when you buy it and activate it stating that you cannot use it for commercial purposes.

523
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:26,385
Scott: But that's the thing.

524
00:38:26,426 --> 00:38:29,720
Scott: is I wanna I kind of want to do semi commercial purposes?

525
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,626
Rym: Well, then you gotta pay.

526
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:40,656
Scott: but I'm not a big-time professional I'm just a small-time schmuck on YouTube and I want to make a little flash, you know I don't want to make a big fancy flash website for my mega corporation.

527
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:41,479
Rym: Yeah, but you know what?

528
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:46,600
Rym: To play the devil's advocate here the the company Adobe they made this program.

529
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:50,280
Rym: They put all this money into making it and it's their proprietary thing.

530
00:38:50,341 --> 00:38:53,185
Rym: You can just choose not to use it but it is sort of a monopoly.

531
00:38:53,205 --> 00:39:05,255
Scott: in a way like right now flash really has a monopoly as far as I'm concerned as far as multimedia Interactive web like highly multimedia highly interactive web content platform.

532
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:07,000
Scott: I mean Java isn't doing it.

533
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:10,860
Rym: But the other libertarian would say you can just make an alternative.

534
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:17,680
Scott: But no one can because it's it's even if you did make an alternative You can't get the plug-in on to all those computers.

535
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,280
Rym: Well, I guess in the marketplace of ideas your idea has failed.

536
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:26,040
Scott: Oh, no, because it is a monopoly a technological and economic monopoly.

537
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,835
Rym: Oh, so do we need someone to step in and break up the monopoly forcibly?

538
00:39:30,196 --> 00:39:31,060
Rym: Is that fair to Adobe?

539
00:39:32,322 --> 00:39:35,394
Scott: If it's a monopoly if it's a real monopoly is Adobe speaking.

540
00:39:35,434 --> 00:39:37,000
Rym: Yeah is flash a real monopoly?

541
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:38,084
Scott: It's tough.

542
00:39:38,144 --> 00:39:39,971
Scott: It's a monopoly of something very small.

543
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,978
Rym: All right, then what should be done about that?

544
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:49,659
Rym: Should an external force takes I'm not going to specifics here should an external force take some action to break that up?

545
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:56,640
Scott: Uh, I think that I would not have an objection if the government forced the flash file format to become open.

546
00:39:57,002 --> 00:40:00,480
Scott: They shouldn't the flash application they can keep because that has you know stuff in it.

547
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:06,140
Scott: But the file format of SWF should be opened up so that anyone can go and make you know.

548
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:08,225
Rym: Just gave me an idea.

549
00:40:08,245 --> 00:40:10,692
Rym: Yep in the physical world.

550
00:40:11,093 --> 00:40:26,379
Rym: There is a concept called eminent domain Where the government can say this land for the public good will be appropriated We will pay the owner adjust market value price and this land will now be appropriated for the public use for the public good.

551
00:40:27,122 --> 00:40:33,840
Rym: Kawai, I wish I think the government should have the ability now Of course, this has all of the power in the world to be abused.

552
00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:37,110
Rym: Of course, I'm just talking about the idea of it the core.

553
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:40,440
Rym: what if the government could eminent domain intellectual property?

554
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:46,200
Scott: I think that would be awesome as long as of course as you said it wasn't abused which would immediately be horribly abused.

555
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:56,508
Rym: The thing is eminent domain has been abused But it's also been used for a lot of good and I think the good of eminent domain in America has outweighed the evil Fairly substantially.

556
00:40:56,568 --> 00:40:56,810
Scott: Yes.

557
00:40:57,112 --> 00:40:58,339
Scott: Here's the problem though, right?

558
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,000
Scott: Let's say you start like we were just talking about how the patents benefit the pharmaceuticals a lot, right?

559
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:10,241
Scott: Well, it'd be hard to argue with someone who said eminent domain every drug they invent because it's for the good of the people Right.

560
00:41:10,402 --> 00:41:16,999
Scott: No because the argument against that would be you put them out of business and then there wouldn't be any more new drugs for the good of the people.

561
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:23,020
Scott: So it would be a very tough balancing act figuring out when to eminent domain a drug and when to let it go.

562
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:28,360
Scott: Yep, you know which ones do the eminent domain which ones do we not, you know do of course obvious.

563
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,457
Scott: There's some obvious cases like there's an outbreak of a disease eminent domain the drug right away.

564
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:34,460
Scott: That's obvious, right?

565
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,519
Scott: But there are other cases where it's like, huh?

566
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,442
Scott: I don't know.

567
00:41:39,502 --> 00:41:41,067
Scott: There's a slight outbreak.

568
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:48,232
Scott: people are afraid of it like the bird flu, but it's not really an outbreak It's just something people are afraid of possibly irrationally.

569
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:49,457
Scott: Should we eminent domain?

570
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:50,220
Scott: that I don't know.

571
00:41:50,881 --> 00:41:54,218
Rym: Yeah, well the thing is I have a lot to say about the drug issue in particular.

572
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:57,300
Scott: Yes I just happen to come up because you're just talking about it.

573
00:41:57,721 --> 00:42:04,360
Scott: Software also like, you know, sure eminent domaining as shockwave file format would be good for the people.

574
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,700
Scott: So would eminent domaining the Microsoft Office file formats, but how good for the people?

575
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:15,799
Scott: Is it really you know, would it be worth basically destroying Adobe as a cause that would destroy Adobe as a company?

576
00:42:15,819 --> 00:42:20,900
Rym: basically Yeah, but then again that also shows that the only I mean Adobe made a good thing.

577
00:42:21,282 --> 00:42:27,120
Rym: But the only product Adobe has now well He's in the flash domain like in this whole flash macro media.

578
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:32,480
Rym: Whatever is that they have a secret thing and they keep it secret from you.

579
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,800
Rym: That way they can sell you things to manipulate their secret.

580
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:41,400
Scott: Well, actually the flash program is really good at animating and doing those sorts of things.

581
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:47,600
Scott: Oh, yeah, but it's the only reason it hasn't been duplicated is because you can't make the file format.

582
00:42:48,003 --> 00:42:53,749
Scott: That's one thing about audio Photoshop Obviously, there's no secrets with the file formats there.

583
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:58,480
Scott: that just can't be duplicated easily because there's lots of algorithms that no one can Figure out but see like audio.

584
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:02,780
Rym: I think that's one of the reasons why there is a fairly robust set of open source audio tools.

585
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,700
Rym: Is that the algorithms are well-known math that have been implemented.

586
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:11,660
Scott: Yeah, you can go to the library and get a book that says here's the math type in this equation and you're good.

587
00:43:12,082 --> 00:43:25,900
Rym: Hence, I use resound which is pretty awesome Yep, and honestly even if like even if I had audition because I've used audition and I don't like it and I really Would continue to use resound and audacity even if audition were given to me for free

588
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:28,629
Scott: Yeah, all I really want is flash and Photoshop.

589
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,540
Scott: just be you know, and I don't even really want flash and Photoshop.

590
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:37,220
Scott: I would much rather have something free that does the same thing, you know good enough for my purposes.

591
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:39,859
Scott: I don't need 90% of the stuff they've got in there.

592
00:43:40,322 --> 00:43:44,040
Scott: I just need to be able to make as WFS so that I can do what I want.

593
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:47,754
Scott: And if an application does it well enough for me, that's well enough, right?

594
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:48,697
Rym: We've rambled for a bit.

595
00:43:48,717 --> 00:43:49,420
Rym: Let's just stop here.

596
00:43:49,641 --> 00:43:51,459
Rym: Okay, it's gonna be a long week to bed.

597
00:43:58,601 --> 00:44:01,191
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
