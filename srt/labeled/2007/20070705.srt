00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,988
Scott: It's Thursday July 5th.

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,152
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,393 --> 00:00:15,458
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:16,674
Scott: fire.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,376
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:31,646
Rym: Man, this week is just swinging with anecdotes.

7
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:36,401
Rym: I Ran a foul of a low-class person on my way home from work today.

8
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:41,688
Rym: that ended mostly in hilarity and possibly also in police action.

9
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:48,150
Rym: Okay, so I'm riding my bike, you know, I get off the train I get on my bike and I brought my bike back home.

10
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,065
Rym: It takes like 10 minutes to ride my maybe 15 minutes if I'm not in a hurry.

11
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:58,770
Rym: and while I'm riding I'm riding in the street like you do on a bike because it's actually illegal to ride bikes on the sidewalk here.

12
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:01,900
Scott: Yeah, it's illegal to ride bikes on the sidewalk almost everywhere.

13
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:02,964
Rym: Yeah, unless you're a little kid.

14
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:08,250
Rym: Yeah, so I'm riding and This guy comes up behind me and he guns his engine.

15
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:23,749
Rym: Alright, I have my hand out already because I'm signaling I'm about to turn left and I turn left and for some reason he suddenly like slams on his brakes And almost like spins out like yeah right behind me like yeah, uh-huh, and he almost hits me.

16
00:01:24,312 --> 00:01:31,923
Rym: So I say hey watch where you're going and I keep riding and then I hear some sort of Garbled scream from behind me as I'm riding.

17
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:33,369
Rym: I hear the engine in.

18
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,550
Rym: He bumps into the curb as he's trying to do a k-turn on this narrow two-lane road.

19
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:41,789
Rym: He eventually turns around and proceeds to start chasing me in his car.

20
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:43,689
Scott: All right.

21
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:55,390
Rym: So, uh at this point I get up on the sidewalk on my bike and I keep going and he rolled out in his window And he keeps driving and the stream of profanity that is coming out of his mouth.

22
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:57,195
Rym: Basically, he's yelling.

23
00:01:57,516 --> 00:02:01,247
Rym: fucking bicycle faggot fucking in my way fucking stop that bike.

24
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,720
Rym: I'll kick your fucking ass Son of a fuck fuck fuck.

25
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:04,890
Scott: Yeah, I got a question.

26
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:15,290
Scott: All right If you if there was if it was legal to have a concealed weapon in this state And you had all the necessary paperwork would have been legal to like shoot his tire or something?

27
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:17,289
Rym: No, you can't just take a revenge.

28
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:20,906
Rym: No unless if I could make a case that he was coming at me with the car.

29
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:25,404
Rym: then Shooting the tire is the best non-lethal way of preventing them from killing me.

30
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:26,448
Scott: Well, were there any witnesses?

31
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:27,030
Rym: not yet.

32
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,981
Scott: So you could have said he was coming at you with the car.

33
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:29,463
Rym: No.

34
00:02:29,503 --> 00:02:30,187
Rym: No, it gets better.

35
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:40,608
Rym: Okay So he starts yelling and yelling and I'm up on the curb and I stopped for a second and he stops and he Opens the door of his car to come and beat me up.

36
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:49,175
Rym: Yeah, so, uh, I just started biking again and this 30 whatever year old guy the guy was in his mid 30s at least Obviously can't catch me.

37
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:53,772
Rym: so he gets back in his car and starts chasing me and the whole time I realize now All right.

38
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:54,776
Rym: This guy's gonna follow me.

39
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:58,089
Rym: I wonder if he realizes that bikes can go places cars can't go.

40
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:01,299
Rym: Yeah, I wonder if he's thought his clever plan all the way through.

41
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,830
Rym: obviously not never mind the fact that I've already got his license plate.

42
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,657
Rym: I took a picture of it with my cell cam.

43
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:09,870
Rym: Ah, I took a picture of him with my cell cam and his car.

44
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:26,270
Rym: I'm sitting there and I just start riding and he's following me the whole time yelling and screaming out the window and he keeps making like he gets ahead of me and then he stops to try to get out of his car and come fight With me and I just avoid him and keep biking and he's getting very very perturbed.

45
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:30,345
Rym: So finally I just stopped and I hold my cell phone up and I say dude.

46
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:30,947
Rym: I'm about to call 9-1-1.

47
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:33,770
Scott: Yep, what do you say now here?

48
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,612
Rym: This is the test.

49
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:36,719
Rym: see this test for me was the test of.

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,270
Rym: is this person stupid independent of all of his other problems?

51
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:43,119
Rym: And he says that don't fucking matter.

52
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,344
Rym: I know all the police and beacon.

53
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:45,308
Rym: they won't lay a hand on me.

54
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:45,730
Rym: come over here.

55
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,868
Rym: I'll kick your faggot ass.

56
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:49,197
Scott: Call the police and beacon now.

57
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:50,623
Rym: I wasn't gonna call 9-1-1 yet.

58
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:52,470
Rym: I was just gonna file a deposition later.

59
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,340
Rym: I'm already dealing with the police aspect of this.

60
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,909
Rym: cuz I already has license plate number.

61
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:02,870
Rym: So I basically and I said, uh, I don't think that's gonna help you and I'm just I want to see how he reacts.

62
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,100
Rym: Cuz there's nothing he can do to me.

63
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:05,129
Rym: He can't get me.

64
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:13,020
Rym: he obviously doesn't have a gun or anything because he's at the point where he already would have used it and I kind of want to see where this goes because

65
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,961
Scott: I would have let him attack you and then kicked his ass cuz Self-defense I was and then the police would have come and wasn't

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,769
Rym: really in the mood to get into a fight with someone plus remember No witnesses at this point.

67
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:25,799
Scott: You got to go somewhere with his witnesses and then let him attack you.

68
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,225
Rym: so I just keep riding and he's following me obviously Until I go to the ice cream shop or something following me home now.

69
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:33,270
Rym: I cut around the other street.

70
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,141
Rym: This is on for plank.

71
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:38,907
Rym: Uh-huh So I just kind of keep going and I go onto our street and I go past our house.

72
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:40,394
Rym: cuz I don't want to lead Him to my house.

73
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:41,722
Rym: I'll get to why in a minute.

74
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:44,460
Rym: Yeah, and Finally, there's a gas station.

75
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,850
Rym: There's a bunch of people filling up their gas.

76
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:54,199
Rym: So I just stopped my bike there and he pulls up yelling and cursing and gets out Completely oblivious to all these people staring at him.

77
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,285
Rym: and he's yelling and screaming at me.

78
00:04:56,746 --> 00:05:01,530
Rym: and every time he comes forward I just kind of backed my bike up a little bit because there's no way he could catch me.

79
00:05:01,832 --> 00:05:06,557
Rym: There's no way he could even close the distance and He keeps yelling.

80
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:09,273
Rym: You're gonna disrespect me on my face You're gonna.

81
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,096
Rym: you're gonna come get me.

82
00:05:10,257 --> 00:05:16,504
Rym: then he's yelling and yelling and yelling and I'm just sitting there and at this point One more time I say dude and this time I lied.

83
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:17,730
Rym: I will admit I lied at this point.

84
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,936
Rym: I said and I quote dude I already called the police.

85
00:05:21,217 --> 00:05:22,523
Rym: I've got your license plate number.

86
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:24,170
Rym: There's a bunch of people are watching you.

87
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:26,177
Rym: What do you think you're gonna get away with?

88
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,385
Rym: and he says I'll kick your ass.

89
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:29,510
Rym: They can't lay a hand on me.

90
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,915
Rym: I'm not gonna kill you.

91
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:31,919
Rym: I'm not gonna go to jail.

92
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:37,369
Rym: But but I'll kick your ass to which I say You know if you kick my ass, you'll go to jail, right?

93
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:39,961
Scott: Yeah, it's called assault.

94
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:43,456
Rym: And as long as He's already committed assault.

95
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:43,837
Scott: Well, I know.

96
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:49,243
Scott: but like if when the police come they ask you they ask Rym Do you want to press charges?

97
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:51,527
Scott: and if you say yes, he goes to jail.

98
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:52,990
Rym: so he's still freaking out.

99
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,649
Rym: He's not backing down the threat of the police isn't scaring him at all.

100
00:05:56,313 --> 00:06:00,029
Rym: I'll get to why this is all relevant in the end because there is a lesson to be learned from all this.

101
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:01,874
Scott: Don't be stupid.

102
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:04,223
Rym: So at this point because I don't care anymore.

103
00:06:04,243 --> 00:06:13,655
Rym: I just started laughing Openly and loudly and he gets so like the fury in his eyes is palpable You can feel it.

104
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:19,988
Rym: and he keeps taking a step forward like yeah, like he's gonna come get me but I'm on a bike and he can't come get me.

105
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:27,372
Rym: and Eventually, I just keep laughing at him and I just keep laughing and laughing and laughing and eventually gets back in his car And yells.

106
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:37,280
Rym: if you weren't such a pussy fucking faggot, maybe you would have stood up to me like a man Uh-huh to which I said and I said something about.

107
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,960
Rym: basically I implied that maybe I am homosexual and maybe I find you attractive And then he drove away.

108
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:52,735
Rym: I took one more picture of his car yeah, and then I stood there and there's all these people standing around at the gas station looking like what the hell and One of them's like.

109
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:54,304
Rym: do you actually call the police?

110
00:06:54,625 --> 00:07:03,579
Rym: and I'm like nah Okay The police know I already filed a police report.

111
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,754
Scott: All right, and I think you rode your bike to the police station And no, I just called him.

112
00:07:07,814 --> 00:07:10,747
Rym: I'm gonna give him a full deposition called the non 9-1-1 police.

113
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:11,530
Scott: Yeah, what is the?

114
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:13,835
Rym: Looked it up again.

115
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:14,480
Rym: I got it myself.

116
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:15,790
Rym: I had it my old cell phone.

117
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:17,958
Rym: Remember when we saw that guy cutting up?

118
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:21,050
Scott: we really need one of those like seven one ones in New York.

119
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,770
Scott: So, you know that we can call when we don't need nine one one, but we need some police.

120
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:34,430
Rym: Well, I just put the local police for like beacon and fish kill in my cell phone and everyone else I would have rode all the way to the fish kill police station and just like stood there be like, what are you gonna do?

121
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,720
Rym: Yeah, the fish kill one's nice.

122
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:36,649
Rym: It's a lot of cops there.

123
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:40,690
Scott: Apparently the fish kill police station is the envy of all the other police station.

124
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:41,775
Rym: I wonder why.

125
00:07:42,156 --> 00:07:44,386
Rym: fish kill is a relatively small town.

126
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:49,830
Rym: It's not a city like beacon It's just a town and it is my impression now my impression.

127
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,099
Rym: This is not a fact because I have not researched it.

128
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,665
Scott: However, I research it.

129
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:54,990
Scott: I read a newspaper article about it.

130
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:55,473
Scott: Well,

131
00:07:56,018 --> 00:08:21,282
Rym: I get the impression It is my opinion that possibly the reason fish kill has one of the best police Buildings and the finest police forces with the best cars and the most money pretty much in the tri-county area here might have something to do with the fact that fish kills a big town on one side of the street called route 9 and then there's a little bit of fish kill on the other side of route 9 and I think that the city of fish get.

132
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:27,543
Rym: well the town of fish kill Writes more tickets on that tiny stretch of route 9 over which they have control.

133
00:08:27,984 --> 00:08:30,110
Rym: then could possibly be reasonable.

134
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,336
Rym: That's my guess.

135
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:34,109
Rym: Yeah, I think that's where they get their money.

136
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:42,350
Scott: But the fish kill police department is probably the largest Municipal building in this area outside of the actual city of Poughkeepsie.

137
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,219
Scott: It's bigger than any town hall of any of these towns.

138
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:48,569
Rym: It's bigger than beacons police department City Hall combined.

139
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,619
Scott: Yep It's got like a gym and all sorts of stuff in there.

140
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:52,341
Scott: It's crazy.

141
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:53,224
Rym: They have more.

142
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:54,950
Rym: they have so many police cars.

143
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:56,199
Scott: It's kind of crazy.

144
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:56,542
Scott: All right.

145
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:08,170
Rym: Yeah, so Lesson number one and I think I mentioned this back when I explained how to Not that I recommend it run away from the police and the answer was pretty much be on a bicycle.

146
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:12,285
Rym: This applies even more so to non police.

147
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:22,877
Rym: if you're on a bicycle There is almost no way that any human being who is not also on a bicycle can cause harm to you if you're smart Because bikes can go where cars can't go.

148
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:27,349
Rym: bikes can turn quicker bikes can go faster than anyone can run for longer.

149
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,190
Scott: A bicycle is the most efficient means of transportation.

150
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:32,293
Scott: Period.

151
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:35,190
Rym: well that is in short bursts to get away from an attacker.

152
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:37,737
Scott: well I know but in general it also is the most of it.

153
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:49,710
Scott: a geared bicycle is the most efficient means of transportation in terms of energy per going and So it's really tough for anyone to beat you as long unless their bike is better than yours and their own land.

154
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:51,467
Rym: I've learned something else too.

155
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:57,170
Rym: Generally, if someone is a costing you odds are they're not in the best shape and they're definitely not a biker.

156
00:09:58,171 --> 00:09:59,239
Scott: That's also probably true.

157
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,630
Scott: They could be some asshole biker.

158
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:06,412
Rym: Yeah But an asshole biker is usually the kind of guy who kicks the in like the door of an SUV when they cut him off Or something.

159
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:11,549
Rym: those aren't the people who will chase another biker down and try to kick his pussy faggot ass, huh?

160
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:18,717
Rym: Moral number two and this is the reason why while I'm filing a police report I am not going to press charges.

161
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:30,490
Rym: and I learned this because I lived in Detroit for a long time and I lived in New Baltimore which is a nice town, but there was also a lot of Shall we say trashy people and then I lived in a really nice area and I've moved around a lot.

162
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:41,895
Rym: But whenever you are involved in any sort of altercation with someone who is now this is an ant they have to be both very poor and Very stupid.

163
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:42,739
Rym: Mm-hmm.

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:57,770
Rym: Oh one of these factors alone is not enough but if both of these are true unless you have a good reason to you don't want to get involved no matter what because if someone is poor and Stupid let's take the example of this gentleman.

165
00:10:58,212 --> 00:10:59,115
Rym: He's obviously poor.

166
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:00,280
Rym: It was a pretty crappy car.

167
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:03,752
Rym: He was wearing this battered white shirt with sweat stains on it.

168
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:10,000
Rym: He didn't look like the most well-off guy Mm-hmm and his addiction manner of speech the vocabulary he used.

169
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:16,179
Rym: I have a pretty good picture of his the social class in which he lies Mm-hmm, so he doesn't have much to lose.

170
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:18,727
Rym: There's not much you can do to him.

171
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:22,040
Scott: besides if you're not gonna get jailed and what are you gonna get?

172
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,608
Scott: You're not gonna get money from suing him.

173
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:25,760
Scott: You're not gonna get damages or anything.

174
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:28,535
Scott: It's pretty much jail for him or no jail for him.

175
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:30,684
Rym: more importantly He is stupid.

176
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:38,046
Rym: notice how despite the fact that I could have called the police and that there were multiple witnesses Watching this exchange.

177
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:50,425
Rym: He still continued to escalate the situation Obviously either not caring or unaware of the possible consequences of attacking a person in broad daylight with a video camera a cell cam and several Witnesses.

178
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,188
Scott: if the police are on their way I'm sure the gas station also had some security cam.

179
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,051
Rym: That's what I actually.

180
00:11:55,111 --> 00:11:57,340
Rym: I made a point of being right where the camera was pointed.

181
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:59,973
Scott: Yeah, well, you can never tell those little black domes.

182
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:00,636
Scott: They could be looking at.

183
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:02,122
Rym: it's not a black dome It's just a camera.

184
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:03,946
Rym: Oh, okay.

185
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:06,412
Rym: Yeah, so obvious now.

186
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:20,480
Rym: people like this because I have many anecdotes from my childhood where someone would you know call the police on a poor and stupid person in town and The poor and stupid person having nothing to lose and not being afraid of the ramifications would often retaliate.

187
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:31,250
Rym: They'll do things like figure out where someone live and then Key their car up one night in the middle of the night or egg their house or let the air out of their tires or smash The windows or stalk them or things like that.

188
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,599
Rym: get their friends to attack them in an alley one night.

189
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:42,399
Rym: Mm-hmm poor people who are also stupid are not afraid of the consequences of their actions partly because they seem to be ignorant of the Consequences of their actions or they have nothing to lose.

190
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:51,570
Rym: So I'm so your best bet when dealing with the situation like I've described where you're in no danger is not to press charges But to simply file a police report.

191
00:12:52,053 --> 00:13:01,859
Rym: that way it's on file And if you ever run afoul of them again And they cause trouble You've already got it on record that they've accosted you before and now the book will get thrown at him twice as hard.

192
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:12,803
Scott: Yeah Still it kind of makes you realize You know as much as we look down upon police brutality and not about to change that opinion that is one You know.

193
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:14,959
Scott: poor stupid people have nothing to lose.

194
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:18,479
Scott: One thing they have to lose is getting the shit beat out of them.

195
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:22,092
Scott: You know, that's sometimes, you know, I mean putting him in jail.

196
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:24,320
Scott: they don't care, you know, they probably care.

197
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:27,480
Rym: The problem is they don't expect that they'll actually go to jail.

198
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:33,183
Rym: The guy kept going on and on while he was yelling about how he knows all the police in this town and they won't lay A hand on it.

199
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:34,328
Scott: So you should have gone to fish kill.

200
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:36,760
Scott: Yeah been like we're a fish kill now.

201
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,728
Rym: Well, actually no cuz.

202
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:41,939
Rym: when he said that I was like, ah, dude I called 9-1-1. the state troopers are coming not the local police.

203
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:46,354
Rym: And he stopped for a second and he just ignored that and said it doesn't matter.

204
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:47,017
Rym: I know them too.

205
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:48,888
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I'm sure dude.

206
00:13:49,231 --> 00:13:57,840
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure Yeah, so when running afoul of people who are both plus I'm sure if you know Even if I was Fred like a fireman and I was friends all of the cops.

207
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,659
Scott: I'm sure they wouldn't, you know, put me in jail if I beat someone up.

208
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:12,460
Rym: I also note that I will admit I got quite a bit of enjoyment out of this and I probably could have just gotten away Quicker, but I kind of wanted to see what he would do.

209
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:18,379
Rym: So I just kept laughing at him and he just kept getting more angry Yeah, and I wish I could have had a video of it.

210
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:20,759
Rym: Maybe I should go ask the gas station guy if he'll give it to me.

211
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,168
Scott: This is actually a lot more fun.

212
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:26,820
Scott: if it happens in like New York City or something Right, cuz like the police will already be there kicking his ass.

213
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,756
Rym: Well, not only not only that but

214
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:45,960
Scott: you know If you're walking down the street and like someone starts something like let's say someone tries to mug you or take your wallet or something Right, and there's actually other people around who are not accomplices of them About half those people are gonna help you out and there's gonna be basically a huge beatdown of like five on one.

215
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:48,360
Rym: It's like when you were there and that purse snatcher tried to grab them.

216
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,580
Scott: Yeah, I was walking to work.

217
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,000
Scott: I think we talked to me talk about this on the show years ago.

218
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,939
Scott: We can tell it briefly a long time ago like a year two years more than two years ago When I worked in the different part of the city at the old job.

219
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:04,916
Scott: I was walking to work one day from Grand Central to the work and I passed well.

220
00:15:04,957 --> 00:15:14,900
Scott: walking by the Think the south side of Bryant Park and on the other side of the street I hear a scream and I see some guy trying to grab a giant purse from this lady.

221
00:15:15,202 --> 00:15:16,409
Rym: I don't get those giant purses.

222
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,355
Scott: Well, I don't get it either.

223
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,080
Scott: What are you carrying?

224
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:34,239
Scott: I don't know, but he grabs it and he starts to run and he gets about two parking spaces away and I'm like, huh and then I'm gonna go run across the street and Meanwhile three other guys on the other side of the street already grabbed him and beat him up.

225
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:37,774
Rym: Basically a crowd of like all the people who got there after he was beat up or like.

226
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:38,778
Rym: is it under control?

227
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:43,080
Rym: you got him You got him like everyone in New York City will just jump on something like that.

228
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:50,386
Scott: Yeah And then a one policeman shows up and puts handcuffs on him and they make sure the guy doesn't get up like stands on him Or something, I guess I don't know.

229
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:53,519
Scott: and then everyone stands around while he writes a report.

230
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:56,098
Scott: Then I go to work.

231
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,691
Rym: Yeah, so that was my day.

232
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:01,699
Rym: yep, so I in the news.

233
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:12,375
Rym: So, you know Godwin Mike Godwin as in Godwin's law exactly what Godwin's law Which most people don't understand or misquote, but I'm not gonna get into that.

234
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:13,178
Scott: I'm gonna get into it.

235
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,370
Scott: you are Yes, so let me tell you the story about Steve Godwin in some.

236
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,917
Scott: Mike Godwin in summary receive Godwin.

237
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:23,327
Scott: Yes, Mike Godwin First of all, he was.

238
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:24,433
Scott: he's a lawyer, right?

239
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:26,482
Scott: He's a. he's sort of a counsel I don't know.

240
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:28,912
Scott: a counsel is a different kind of lawyer, whatever.

241
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:38,254
Scott: I'm sure all of our lawyer listeners will know he was the lawyer for Steve Jackson in the Steve Jackson versus United States Secret Service case.

242
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:39,880
Scott: Oh and Steve Jackson one.

243
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:44,774
Rym: Uh, I just like to note that if any of you are unfamiliar with that court case You should look it up.

244
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:49,495
Rym: Anytime you think that our government the United States government is capable

245
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:51,040
Scott: of an intelligent conspiracy

246
00:16:51,282 --> 00:17:03,040
Rym: yeah, if any time you think that the government is evil and Conspiring to do evil things and like the secret government the shadow, whatever That story will remind you very quickly that it is probably not the case.

247
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:08,359
Scott: Yep, he then became a lawyer for the electronic frontier foundation, which is awesome.

248
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:16,180
Scott: They're the people who have a bunch of lawyers who are fighting to you know Get rid of all these stupid laws like the DMCA actually legal wiretapping.

249
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:16,682
Scott: they were

250
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:33,820
Rym: largely behind the blue ribbon campaign, which is a part of internet history now, but Basically back when the internet started really taking off in the mid 90s The idea of freedom of speech on the internet was sharply contested in the United States and there was a large Campaign to make sure that we had freedom of speech there.

251
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,320
Scott: Yep, the EFF's major contribution has been that they got they won the case that lets us all use very powerful encryption.

252
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:47,560
Scott: He also wrote a bunch of books and the character Mike Godwin that a difference engine is named after Godwin.

253
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,286
Rym: Yep, that was the Zimmerman case.

254
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,210
Rym: right the encryption thing.

255
00:17:50,873 --> 00:17:51,615
Scott: Yeah, I think so.

256
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:55,052
Rym: I don't remember exactly I don't remember offhand.

257
00:17:55,334 --> 00:18:13,908
Scott: Yep, and then Alright, so then he came up with Godwin's law Which is and I state ahem as an online discussion grows longer the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler Approaches one that is Godwin's law.

258
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,192
Scott: and he came up with it.

259
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:15,693
Scott: note.

260
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:18,160
Rym: It does not say anyone loses an argument.

261
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:20,873
Rym: It just says that Hitler's gonna come up.

262
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:21,455
Scott: Yep.

263
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:22,360
Scott: That's all it says.

264
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:28,676
Scott: So this guy who is involved with Steve Jackson games the EFF and he made up Godwin's law.

265
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:29,338
Scott: cuz he's fucking.

266
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:35,675
Scott: Michael Godwin Did all these amazing things and he's like an uber geek person.

267
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,500
Scott: He's a person that's very important geek.

268
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,847
Scott: You should know about him and he's still alive and still awesome.

269
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:42,596
Scott: Well, he just changed jobs.

270
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:43,900
Scott: You know what he is now.

271
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:44,765
Rym: What is he now?

272
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:48,606
Scott: He's general counsel for the Wikipedia Hot day.

273
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:54,067
Scott: So if the Wikipedia gets in trouble Mike Godwin is gonna be the one to help him out.

274
00:18:54,568 --> 00:19:00,025
Rym: The Wikipedia is also known among possibly the rest of the world as Wikipedia.

275
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:00,848
Scott: yes, that's right.

276
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:02,114
Scott: It's an inside joke in my work.

277
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:02,535
Scott: I know.

278
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:06,580
Scott: Yeah, but yeah He is the general counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation.

279
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:08,767
Scott: Talk about a guy who's like done every.

280
00:19:08,787 --> 00:19:11,475
Scott: he'd been in every sector of geekdom as someone awesome.

281
00:19:11,836 --> 00:19:13,100
Rym: He's a minor hero of mine.

282
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:16,673
Scott: Yeah, so Mike Godwin, you should know about him.

283
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,400
Scott: He's awesome, right?

284
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:21,832
Rym: So the 4th of July Independence Day in the United States went by.

285
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:23,940
Rym: it's part of the reason we had a special yesterday.

286
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:31,800
Rym: also to all of you who are relatively new I would like to Teach you about some of the code words we use on GeekNights.

287
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:40,539
Rym: You see whenever we call a show a special episode that is code word for and I quote Rym and Scott are too lazy to do an actual show.

288
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:43,953
Rym: So they're just gonna record something and put it up and call it special.

289
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:46,476
Scott: That's exactly right Hahaha.

290
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:55,569
Rym: but anyway apparently the state of Minnesota there is a law that they want to pass.

291
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:56,753
Rym: I don't know if it's passed yet or what.

292
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:58,860
Rym: I read this article very skim ishly.

293
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:15,160
Rym: Basically, they want to make it illegal to sell flags American flags within the state that were not produced in the United States Punishable by up to a thousand dollar fine and 90 days in jail.

294
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,744
Rym: No, no, no Or anything.

295
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:23,020
Rym: I would like to point out that that is in violation of a great many international trade treaties.

296
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:36,787
Scott: well I was gonna say it's in violation of the Constitution of the United States of America because if it's a flag from another country then it's interstate commerce and thus the federal government has Purvey over that.

297
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:38,092
Scott: I guess not mistake.

298
00:20:38,293 --> 00:20:38,816
Rym: I guess they could.

299
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:44,160
Rym: they could make the argument I guess that because it they don't want them to be sold within the state.

300
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:48,216
Rym: So they're not interacting with the feds because it can come in the borders.

301
00:20:48,236 --> 00:20:49,120
Rym: You just can't be sold.

302
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,714
Scott: I guess I could order one from another state.

303
00:20:51,774 --> 00:20:52,880
Scott: Then what are they gonna do about it?

304
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,509
Scott: I'll order a thousand of them from oriental trading company.

305
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,908
Rym: See now, uh, I just want to point out that Minnesota Loses a little bit of the respect.

306
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,420
Scott: Yeah, Minnesota never had much of the respect any.

307
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,947
Scott: I mean, what the hell does that state have now?

308
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:07,600
Rym: I've seen that there are a lot of other states that have similar laws.

309
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:16,147
Rym: However on further investigation, it looks like most of those laws Don't say you can't sell Nondomestically produced flags in the state.

310
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:21,250
Rym: They say these states cannot buy Nondomestically produced which is very different.

311
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:21,933
Rym: No, that's it.

312
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:23,440
Scott: You can you can have a law like that.

313
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:27,940
Scott: I'm that's a law that says this is how the state will spend its taxpayer money.

314
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:30,280
Scott: Yeah, which is there's nothing wrong with that kind of law.

315
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:38,818
Rym: There's nothing wrong with that, but I just can't believe that then in this day and age this sort of jingoist restrictive trade bullshit still happens.

316
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:45,937
Rym: I mean Globalization works only if it's actually global and it's actually free.

317
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:48,547
Scott: Yeah a lot It's a people always complain.

318
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:53,980
Scott: you see all those people protesting the World Trade Organization and stuff And they're kind of right in the kind of wrong.

319
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,093
Scott: The problem here is that the World Trade Organization wants.

320
00:21:57,374 --> 00:21:58,740
Scott: quote free trade, right?

321
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:07,720
Scott: Free trade on paper means that anyone in the entire world right can trade Absolutely freely with anyone else in the entire world.

322
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:14,380
Scott: I can engage in commerce with a Chinese guy and not have to pay any government's extra money.

323
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:24,180
Scott: It'll just be money goes from me to the Chinese guy and goods come from him to me or vice versa And no one gets in the way except of course you have to pay for someone to ship it, but that's it.

324
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,505
Scott: That's what free trade means is.

325
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:35,519
Scott: anyone can do business with anyone perfectly openly with no interference Of course, as long as you're not doing illegal business Like I don't know buying guns or bombs or anything like that.

326
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:39,000
Scott: The problem is is that the World Trade Organization actually?

327
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:48,851
Scott: fights so that big companies and federal governments can trade freely but individual people Cannot and thus it won't work if you do that.

328
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:51,219
Rym: Well, the thing is it's a little more complicated.

329
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:51,540
Scott: it is.

330
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,658
Scott: I'm trying to keep it simple here.

331
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,745
Scott: I can not let her episode.

332
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,292
Rym: I can sum it up much more simply.

333
00:22:55,312 --> 00:23:07,371
Rym: the majority of the people Protesting the WTO or the World Bank or all those things have no idea what those organizations even do and they're just dirty hippies For some reason have jumped on the ravel bandwagon.

334
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:08,575
Scott: Thanks for saying what I was thinking.

335
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:10,040
Rym: I've talked to these people.

336
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,692
Rym: I've read what they wrote on the internet unless they're anarcho primitivists.

337
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:15,699
Scott: Uh, you mean like the Unabomber?

338
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:18,467
Rym: Yeah No, no, cuz he was actually he.

339
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:22,480
Rym: while he was a crazy nut at least he was not an anarcho primitivist.

340
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,660
Rym: He went all the way with his anarcho primitivism.

341
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:29,580
Rym: Okay, it was Emily who knew someone who met a guy who claimed to be an anarcho primitivist.

342
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,385
Rym: So we basically.

343
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:40,879
Rym: what that meant was he didn't have any furniture in his dorm room except for his laptop where he Yeah, he would go on forums and talk about anarcho primitivism something like that.

344
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:47,560
Rym: Yeah But I've tried to talk to these people before and they don't even know what the or what these acronyms stand for.

345
00:23:47,944 --> 00:23:53,898
Scott: These people are idiots Yeah, but anyway free trade is good as long as everyone gets free trade.

346
00:23:53,978 --> 00:24:01,060
Scott: and it's funny How we have a federal government fighting for free trade while some of the states are doing the exact opposite.

347
00:24:01,662 --> 00:24:03,848
Rym: Well, it's just BS jingoism and hopefully I'm.

348
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,820
Rym: there's a possibility that this bill was just put forth by some guy.

349
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,586
Rym: He wants to rabble rouse the jingoism.

350
00:24:09,606 --> 00:24:22,977
Scott: Yeah, I mean state legislatures aren't full of you know, all awesome people, you know You don't have to be some great Legislator to get on to the state, you know, you can simplify that regular expression and just define something legislators.

351
00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:25,498
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I could.

352
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:38,035
Rym: Things of the day, you know Scott I got to say off Billy Jean, she's not my lover She's just the girl.

353
00:24:38,297 --> 00:24:46,110
Rym: said that I'm the one but kids not my son Uh-huh, so apparently well not apparently I just I found a video of it.

354
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,795
Rym: So I want to share this with all of you.

355
00:24:48,457 --> 00:25:04,728
Rym: Michael Jackson first performed his classic trademark moonwalk in 1983 on a television special called Motown 25 Yesterday today forever and here's a video of it and all I got to say one the moonwalks.

356
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:05,370
Rym: awesome, too.

357
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,864
Rym: I'm glad that I can see the first time it happened.

358
00:25:08,427 --> 00:25:08,769
Rym: and three.

359
00:25:09,472 --> 00:25:14,266
Scott: Michael Jackson was so cool back then and now he's the exact opposite.

360
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,590
Scott: How the fuck does that happen?

361
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:18,210
Rym: I mean when I was a kid, I was a huge fan of Michael Jackson.

362
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:21,063
Rym: I got to say now that I'm it's kind of like with MC hammer.

363
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:28,721
Rym: now that I'm older and It's in the past and I go back and watch this dancing in the singing I'm so much more impressed by it.

364
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:38,890
Scott: Yeah, I guess when I was a kid I just didn't appreciate awesome dancing, even though I still liked MC hammer and Michael Jackson as a kid I didn't really appreciate their talents or former talents.

365
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:45,290
Scott: And now I go back and look at it again and unlike he-man which now looks like crap don't watch he-man.

366
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:48,707
Scott: I look back at Michael Jackson MC hammer and other.

367
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:52,608
Scott: you know Things I enjoyed as a kid and some of them are more awesome now than they used to be.

368
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:55,799
Scott: of course Some of the people are less awesome now than they used to be.

369
00:25:55,819 --> 00:26:02,741
Rym: Yeah, but seriously Michael Jackson was awesome was Yeah was if only he hadn't gone crazy.

370
00:26:03,002 --> 00:26:03,805
Scott: How does this happen?

371
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:04,567
Scott: I mean like look at us.

372
00:26:04,587 --> 00:26:07,979
Scott: We're kind of cool We're not famous, but we're internet famous.

373
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,749
Rym: Yeah, I definitely think we crossed the line of internet fame, right?

374
00:26:11,674 --> 00:26:12,969
Scott: How could we possibly?

375
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,404
Scott: Become like that like how could we take a downturn like that?

376
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:20,034
Scott: I just don't see a possible Path.

377
00:26:20,134 --> 00:26:22,890
Scott: I could go down where that would be the end up like that.

378
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:25,550
Rym: Well part of it might be that we weren't child stars.

379
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:28,783
Rym: We weren't internet famous before we could handle being internet famous.

380
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:30,530
Scott: I guess that is significant factor.

381
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:39,524
Rym: Yeah, also the fact that there was a lot of pressure on kid Michael Jackson And he was you know pretty much the biggest pop star in the world.

382
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:41,450
Scott: I mean like what about kid Tiger Woods?

383
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,134
Scott: He's alright.

384
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:47,668
Rym: He doesn't have a problem now I guess I mean it also depends on the person the family all those sorts of things.

385
00:26:47,829 --> 00:26:49,696
Rym: Yeah But I do agree.

386
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:51,930
Rym: I can't see us going crazy and mad with power.

387
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:55,684
Rym: Yeah, I mean next year when GeekNights has a hundred thousand listeners.

388
00:26:55,704 --> 00:26:58,250
Rym: I Don't see my life changing.

389
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:58,772
Rym: Anyway anyway.

390
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:08,507
Scott: so This moonwalk that Michael Jackson did did he invent it?

391
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:09,110
Rym: well?

392
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,522
Rym: You see there's a lot of information about this.

393
00:27:11,603 --> 00:27:19,128
Rym: if you really want to go read the Wikipedia Now I cuz I actually didn't know that Part of it was based on some of the things that Marcel Marcel used to do back in the 50s.

394
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:22,250
Rym: If you don't know who that is get off my podcast Yep.

395
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:31,570
Rym: But as far as I can see and this is also on YouTube the first moonwalk was before that was videotaped Was performed by well?

396
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:34,786
Rym: I'll just let Scott take it from here because it's a thing of the day is my thing today.

397
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:42,630
Scott: so in 1955 there was a tap dancing guy, and he was an awesome tap dancing guy, and you know I like some old-style dancing.

398
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,848
Scott: I've done old-style dancing things of the day before and this is a guy named Bill Bailey.

399
00:27:46,888 --> 00:27:47,290
Rym: dude Scott.

400
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:50,103
Rym: I'll randomly watch the Charleston while we're waiting to do that.

401
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:53,910
Scott: one of my favorite things to do is that People doing the Charleston is just so awesome.

402
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:54,895
Scott: Why don't we?

403
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:58,070
Scott: I just look on YouTube to find people doing the Charleston all the time.

404
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,275
Rym: Why don't we do the Charleston?

405
00:27:59,717 --> 00:28:00,279
Scott: It's hard.

406
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:00,881
Rym: Let's learn it.

407
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:02,889
Scott: We have to learn other dances first.

408
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:07,598
Scott: No not like the Haruhi Susan me dance.

409
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,983
Rym: so which one should we learn first?

410
00:28:09,043 --> 00:28:09,927
Rym: that or the Charleston?

411
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:16,890
Scott: we have to learn like Basic dance moves that you know you like fundamental parts that we can add together into the Charleston.

412
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,890
Rym: Why don't we just Napoleon dynamite it?

413
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:24,593
Rym: Let's just get every music video Michael Jackson ever did and learn the poppin lock straight up Cuz.

414
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:26,644
Scott: then we're only gonna be able to do that one dance.

415
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:27,550
Rym: There's nothing wrong with that.

416
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:28,616
Rym: If we learn ever.

417
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:39,370
Scott: if we learn the parts of dances Then we can recombine them later to construct new dances Sort of like learning to fish rather than being given a fish kind of like when you're playing DDR.

418
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:47,057
Rym: I mean you might be able to do the up left down left combo and the up right down left combo But if you can combine the two without screwing it up.

419
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,564
Scott: yep, so anyway this tap dancing.

420
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:57,164
Scott: Bill Bailey regardless of anything else You should watch this because awesome old tap dancing can't be beat, but at the end of this video.

421
00:28:57,184 --> 00:29:03,822
Scott: He moonwalks oh my god 1955 there's a dude moonwalking after he's done tap dancing.

422
00:29:04,223 --> 00:29:06,330
Rym: I don't doubt that Michael Jackson saw that video.

423
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,022
Scott: I also do not doubt that he saw that video lightning.

424
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,709
Rym: huh, maybe we should get the show short.

425
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:11,414
Scott: no That's all right.

426
00:29:11,676 --> 00:29:12,888
Rym: well the power did go out earlier.

427
00:29:12,948 --> 00:29:13,532
Rym: luckily We have.

428
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:14,537
Rym: we have UPS's.

429
00:29:14,557 --> 00:29:16,004
Rym: we have four UPS's.

430
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:20,085
Scott: see if the power goes out You just go save and then exit and turn the computer off.

431
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:24,070
Rym: yep actually We could still upload the show even if the power was out.

432
00:29:24,214 --> 00:29:26,277
Scott: Oh, yeah We could send it over to my computer.

433
00:29:26,377 --> 00:29:29,830
Rym: well our network equipment is all on the UPS in addition to all our computers.

434
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:36,882
Scott: Yeah If you if you sent it over to my laptop really quickly my laptop on its battery power could connect to the wireless router And then we could upload the show.

435
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:52,213
Rym: yep Now listening to that song I'm sure you could guess as what we're talking about tonight Even though it could be any number of things.

436
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,326
Rym: perhaps We're talking about that style of music perhaps.

437
00:29:55,346 --> 00:30:00,620
Rym: We're talking about that song, but now we're talking about the subject of that song.

438
00:30:01,262 --> 00:30:07,960
Rym: Tonight we are beginning a long-running series on perhaps Scott's favorite thing in the world some of my favorite thing in the world.

439
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:13,200
Rym: It's it's probably your second most said word yeah, but that doesn't mean it's my favorite thing.

440
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,599
Scott: Just cuz I say something a lot doesn't mean it's my favorite.

441
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:17,066
Rym: Wait a minute.

442
00:30:17,086 --> 00:30:20,600
Rym: so you saying Scott that the topic of our show is not your favorite thing.

443
00:30:20,922 --> 00:30:21,847
Scott: No, it's not my favorite thing.

444
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:22,832
Rym: is it in the top three?

445
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:23,958
Rym: probably okay?

446
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,407
Rym: Tonight we're gonna talk about fire.

447
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:30,819
Rym: we entitle this episode fire part one.

448
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,894
Rym: oh I figured you'd take it away from there Scott captain fire.

449
00:30:34,914 --> 00:30:39,299
Scott: Oh Anyway fire is pretty goddamn awesome.

450
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:44,386
Scott: You get you.

451
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:50,879
Scott: just if you start a fire you get light you get heat you get danger You get a weapon you get a tool.

452
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:53,027
Scott: It's kind of hard to beat fire.

453
00:30:53,348 --> 00:30:54,592
Scott: even cavemen knew that much.

454
00:30:55,074 --> 00:31:03,733
Scott: the thing is actually that Most animals at least on earth seem to be afraid of fire Which you think is good because fire hurts if you touch it.

455
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:06,144
Scott: you know if you like light a fire Not to.

456
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:07,912
Scott: most animals are gonna run away from the fire.

457
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,640
Scott: if you have a campfire near your camp.

458
00:31:10,122 --> 00:31:14,019
Scott: It's a good way to keep away bears and raccoons and things from eating you in your sleep.

459
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,147
Scott: Humans aren't so afraid of fire.

460
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,117
Scott: I mean some of them are but some humans are pyromaniacs.

461
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:20,780
Scott: They love fire.

462
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,247
Scott: They like they set themselves on fire even now.

463
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,695
Rym: I do note that there's no pyromaniac chickens.

464
00:31:25,975 --> 00:31:26,918
Scott: No no there aren't.

465
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:30,720
Rym: so Maybe there are yes, and they're just really unfulfilled now.

466
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:47,030
Scott: I don't know if there's any evidences or studies or things for this or anthropologies or whatever, but I am pretty confident that the pyromaniac nature of some human beings was a Significant contributing factor to the advancement of human civilization.

467
00:31:47,110 --> 00:32:01,487
Scott: the fact that you there is at least some humans who were not afraid of fire And we're curious about fire and thus investigated it and learned to take advantage of it is Why we are here today with computers and clothing and cars and everything else.

468
00:32:02,028 --> 00:32:03,530
Scott: fire is just that important I?

469
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,312
Rym: Think there's actually a little bit more to it than that.

470
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:07,280
Rym: you think there's more to it.

471
00:32:07,581 --> 00:32:09,954
Rym: I would actually go forward to say that it's not fire in general.

472
00:32:10,014 --> 00:32:11,100
Rym: It's just danger.

473
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,263
Rym: I mean think of the.

474
00:32:12,404 --> 00:32:15,513
Rym: anytime there's a natural disaster something horrible crazy happens.

475
00:32:15,573 --> 00:32:16,556
Rym: something weird happens.

476
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:19,746
Rym: something dangerous happens While many people flee.

477
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:25,229
Rym: I note that whenever something like that happens pretty much Universally animals avoid it.

478
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:32,258
Rym: whenever there is something strange Animals avoid it, but humans tend to be drawn to it for better or for worse.

479
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:33,684
Rym: yes In fact I would.

480
00:32:33,764 --> 00:32:37,740
Rym: I would point out that I would say it's more often for worse than for better.

481
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:43,709
Rym: Yes, but for every thousand humans who died in a fire I think what it is is in the short term right.

482
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:47,220
Scott: it is worse because people are going into crazy dangerous situations.

483
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:55,213
Scott: Oh for the individual yes for the long term and for the entire species of human beings I think it has been better.

484
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:56,140
Scott: it might not be better now.

485
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,839
Rym: But for every thousand humans who died in a fire one of them cooked some meat or made some metal.

486
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:02,608
Scott: Yeah, well made metal.

487
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:04,940
Scott: You don't make metal you Smith it well.

488
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:13,185
Rym: No, no some fire could have ended up causing some metal to melt out of a rock or something or invented eternal combustion Or something like that.

489
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:14,571
Rym: Maybe external combustion.

490
00:33:14,771 --> 00:33:19,078
Rym: Yeah, or spontaneous human combustion Which is fake?

491
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:20,886
Rym: Just got to get that out there.

492
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:22,394
Scott: I thought it happened at least.

493
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:22,797
Scott: no never.

494
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:24,524
Rym: no It's never been documented.

495
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:28,700
Rym: at every single time someone who's claimed spontaneous human combustion.

496
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,358
Rym: The odds were that the person was a smoker living alone and died in their bed, huh?

497
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,980
Scott: I thought I heard a story that like someone was sitting in a chair, and then they were dust on the chair.

498
00:33:39,161 --> 00:33:39,944
Scott: Nothing else was burned.

499
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:40,888
Rym: Oh, yeah, that can happen.

500
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,620
Rym: There's a clear physical process for that happening.

501
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:44,678
Scott: Oh, so what is it?

502
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,328
Rym: It has to do with the fact that there's fat in the body.

503
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:54,600
Rym: you basically burn like a wick and a super hot fire will Form right there, but due to the nature of that kind of fire it won't burn anything else.

504
00:33:55,424 --> 00:34:02,160
Scott: Oh, it's pretty interesting, so I guess let's see that's the phenomena I had heard about and that's why I assumed in spontaneous human combustion was real.

505
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:06,564
Rym: Oh, yeah, no I guess it's just that phenomena and that phenomenon can happen But it's not spontaneous.

506
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:14,873
Rym: most of those people either dropped a match on themselves or were smoking in bed or had an oxygen tank Or there was an electrical fire, and they were too old to wake up.

507
00:34:15,335 --> 00:34:19,050
Scott: all right all right Yeah, but there can be spontaneous non-human combustion.

508
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:23,768
Scott: Oh, yeah, like if you have a stack of old dry magazines That's really tall in a bad place.

509
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,757
Rym: Yep, or latex gloves with baking soda on them Yeah, that could do it, too.

510
00:34:28,301 --> 00:34:29,606
Scott: So watch out for that.

511
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:32,956
Scott: or do it on purpose in a safe place or you know what.

512
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:36,620
Rym: if you're in an old house It's not a good idea to go to an old light switch.

513
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,958
Rym: Just flick it on and off a bunch of times as fast as you can.

514
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,699
Rym: That's not the best idea.

515
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:43,206
Scott: No, I guess not.

516
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:47,389
Rym: so uh or if your fuse is gone You know the fuse fell out or the fuse is busted.

517
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:55,100
Rym: you don't have a new fuse even though I've only lived in one house that had fuses in my life, so I own one fuse that in my bag of electrical stuff.

518
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:57,488
Rym: but I Fuses aren't used in houses anymore.

519
00:34:57,508 --> 00:35:10,682
Rym: if you have a house that has a fuse and the fuse burns out And you don't have a replacement fuse Don't put a quarter in the fuse box or or a penny or a wire or a bullet a Bullet.

520
00:35:10,702 --> 00:35:14,159
Rym: remember that apocryphal tale of the bullet replacing the fuse in the car.

521
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:16,227
Scott: Yeah, it's not good.

522
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:17,957
Rym: Louis black tells the story like it's true.

523
00:35:17,997 --> 00:35:21,972
Scott: It's not Yeah, a lot of people tell stories like the true that they're not.

524
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,600
Rym: Oh, yeah, we should do a show on that.

525
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,805
Scott: Yeah, all right.

526
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:28,180
Scott: Anyway, why don't we tell some humorous fire anecdotes?

527
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,840
Rym: Well get the show over with I often as a kid like to set things on fire, but I was not a pyromaniac.

528
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:38,000
Scott: Well, I also like to set things on fire and I like to play with fire.

529
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:44,000
Scott: But I knew it was dangerous and I was slightly more afraid of getting hurt than I was willing to play with the fire.

530
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,734
Scott: And also my parents are pretty strict about not letting me play with fire.

531
00:35:47,774 --> 00:35:51,909
Scott: So it was a rare opportunity I got to do dangerous fiery things.

532
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,536
Rym: See I was completely the opposite.

533
00:35:53,676 --> 00:35:54,560
Rym: I wasn't afraid at all.

534
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:55,946
Rym: I had a fresno lens.

535
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,493
Rym: I melted asphalt with it.

536
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:58,980
Rym: I set leaves on fire.

537
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:02,039
Rym: I've set fireworks on fire with the fresno lens.

538
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:10,740
Rym: In fact, I am very lucky that I have all of my fingers because I was drawn to fireworks much like moth to the flame.

539
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:18,960
Scott: Yeah fireworks are illegal in Connecticut and you know some people around bought them and used them but my parents did not.

540
00:36:19,401 --> 00:36:27,612
Scott: So I was stuck, you know looking out my window at night at the people across the street with their fireworks, dude I was the kid having Roman candle fights with his friends.

541
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:30,300
Rym: Yeah, shoot bottle rockets at each other.

542
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:34,216
Rym: We tie army men to bottle rockets that at all their bottle rockets tied to them.

543
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:40,685
Rym: one time We took one of those popper, you know, the little snapper throwers and we emptied out Oh, I had the snappers all the time.

544
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:45,200
Rym: We emptied out the contents of like four bags of them into one gigantic thing.

545
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:47,614
Scott: It's hard to do that because they'll snap when you try to open them up.

546
00:36:47,634 --> 00:36:50,470
Scott: There's like a little rock in there And yeah, we were real careful.

547
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:51,556
Rym: It took a long time.

548
00:36:51,697 --> 00:36:52,300
Scott: It's really hard.

549
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,590
Scott: That's why they're filled with sawdust is to keep them from snapping.

550
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:56,640
Rym: a bunch of them went off and a few of us got hurt.

551
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,231
Rym: But we did it and let me tell you it worked.

552
00:36:59,512 --> 00:37:00,396
Rym: That's all I'm gonna say.

553
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:01,902
Scott: it sure does work I can.

554
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:03,990
Scott: we've combined many of them into one before.

555
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:14,650
Rym: our favorite thing to do where there's this one kind of firework that nominally it would shoot up into the air with wings and fire really really high and Coast for a while with different colors and then explode.

556
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:28,967
Rym: so we'd tie like three of them together and then we'd have a fuse that would eventually light all three and we'd set that off and The basically what would happen was it go up into the air and then about halfway up It would suddenly change direction

557
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:29,630
Scott: and the

558
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:33,350
Rym: odds were that would come straight for you Pretty much without fail.

559
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,939
Rym: It would come straight for you.

560
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:45,620
Scott: Yeah even nowadays You know where I'm allowed to play with fire and I could play with fire pretty much whenever I want and I don't really care About playing with fire and I have things to play with fire.

561
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:51,060
Scott: I'm still kind of afraid of actually more afraid of getting hurt with fire than I ever was.

562
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:56,180
Rym: I mean, I'll know that I'm not - I don't I can't blame you because fireworks are dangerous.

563
00:37:56,702 --> 00:37:59,812
Rym: But you were you pull you had the method of hold the match.

564
00:37:59,852 --> 00:38:02,360
Rym: hold the match as soon as you think the fuse went.

565
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:04,020
Rym: You were already across the street.

566
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:16,240
Scott: Yeah I mean cuz you know all I think about is I Imagine myself like standing right in front of a bottle rocket that's lit and just standing there not moving I've done and then it firing into me and I hit my bottle rockets.

567
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,486
Scott: Yeah, and I imagine what's gonna happen.

568
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:26,060
Scott: and I imagine like that little tiny stick like going right through my body and then exploding and like Blowing my head off and I don't want that to happen.

569
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:29,219
Rym: See ya the answer is maybe it's just cuz I've been hit by fireworks a lot.

570
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:32,560
Rym: But when you shoot a firework like that like a bottle rocket.

571
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:37,534
Rym: Unless it hits you in the eye the odds of serious injury are pretty low.

572
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,680
Scott: I'm just kind of afraid of injury.

573
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,327
Scott: Yeah, I'm not afraid of fire.

574
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:42,893
Scott: Like if this just a fire is sitting there.

575
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,460
Scott: I'm like, ooh, and I'll play with it.

576
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,707
Rym: Yeah, you'll always throw stuff into it.

577
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:51,659
Rym: Yep, but like those little UFOs we were shooting off It's impossible for those to hurt you even if they just went straight for your face.

578
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:54,455
Rym: Maybe there you're pretty much fine.

579
00:38:54,597 --> 00:39:02,239
Rym: Yeah Yeah Granted much of my non-fear fireworks has to do with being incredibly lucky and not having been hit by them in a dangerous way.

580
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,531
Scott: Yeah, what other ways that I have fun with fire besides.

581
00:39:06,631 --> 00:39:10,605
Rym: my primary fear and the reason we didn't shoot for so many fireworks Off wasn't police.

582
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,553
Rym: Yeah, I wasn't afraid of getting burned.

583
00:39:12,613 --> 00:39:14,200
Rym: I was afraid of the police busting me.

584
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:16,596
Scott: I wonder what the penalty is for fireworks in New York.

585
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:16,878
Rym: I don't know.

586
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:20,372
Rym: as a kid I wasn't afraid of the police with fireworks because I'm a kid.

587
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,260
Rym: I'm invincible as far as I can see.

588
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:22,822
Scott: What is it?

589
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:24,108
Scott: a fine a jail?

590
00:39:24,168 --> 00:39:24,510
Scott: I don't know.

591
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,640
Rym: It's probably a fine and they take away all your fireworks.

592
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,059
Scott: Oh, I wonder how much the fine is cuz I'd be willing to pay the fine if it wasn't so much.

593
00:39:31,861 --> 00:39:36,685
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is then they take away all your fireworks and I'm sure that's why you got to set them all off and Then pay the fine.

594
00:39:36,927 --> 00:39:38,859
Rym: I'm sure the fine is greater if you get caught again.

595
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:41,599
Scott: Well, no, you set them all off before they catch you.

596
00:39:42,062 --> 00:39:46,179
Scott: Yeah, the problem is they come pretty set them all up at once with one giant fuse.

597
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:49,774
Rym: I Got a story about that, but I'll save it for another time.

598
00:39:49,794 --> 00:39:50,599
Rym: That's special.

599
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,868
Rym: So we have anything else.

600
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:55,780
Rym: or is this gonna turn into that one episode of twit?

601
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,730
Scott: No, I could talk about all like.

602
00:39:57,871 --> 00:39:58,374
Scott: I've done a lot.

603
00:39:58,394 --> 00:40:03,114
Scott: I remember at summer camp We not just fire but we also like threw sodium in the lake.

604
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:04,479
Scott: That was a lot of fun.

605
00:40:04,981 --> 00:40:09,960
Scott: But we I remember the one thing we did at summer camp is the summer camp was this very science II summer camp full of.

606
00:40:10,605 --> 00:40:17,540
Scott: We had a chemistry lab and Basically, the chemistry lab meant turn on the Bunsen burner and throw stuff into it and see what happens.

607
00:40:17,786 --> 00:40:24,967
Scott: Yeah And I remember if you would threw all the different things in there to get all the different colors like if you threw iron Filings into it you would get these sparks.

608
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:31,450
Scott: and if you threw like this other powder into it get it would turn green and That's how I learned how fireworks worked.

609
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:37,272
Scott: if you like take green stuff and iron Filings and you put them near a fire with some gunpowder, whatever.

610
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:42,831
Scott: you would make a firework that had sparks and green and It was really fun.

611
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:44,080
Rym: I love stuff like that.

612
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,619
Rym: I always wanted to make fireworks as a kid, but my fireman dad dissuaded me.

613
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,880
Rym: Yeah, he explained how dangerous it is to make fireworks real dangerous.

614
00:40:53,642 --> 00:40:56,459
Scott: Another thing we did at summer camp is we we were going to.

615
00:40:56,479 --> 00:41:01,200
Scott: you know You make a campfire every week and you know You hold some hot dogs on a stick over it and then you eat him.

616
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:07,920
Scott: Right if you took the plastic bag that had the hot dog buns, you know, well that previously contained hot dog buns.

617
00:41:08,182 --> 00:41:10,260
Rym: You don't throw that in the fire you don't throw it in the fire.

618
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,072
Scott: That's dangerous releases poison gas if you hold it above the fire.

619
00:41:14,373 --> 00:41:22,493
Scott: enough above the fire that it won't burn Like, you know poison gas but enough above the fire that it will be heated up and warmed so that it will melt.

620
00:41:23,015 --> 00:41:28,017
Scott: when the drips of plastic fall into the fire one at a time they go.

621
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:38,020
Rym: Well, I think You win the fire Contest here because while I know about fireworks, I never thought of that.

622
00:41:38,302 --> 00:41:39,188
Scott: I didn't think of it either.

623
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:40,959
Scott: the can't the counselor who knew how to do it.

624
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:50,560
Rym: Yeah I didn't play much with fire itself other than actually One of my favorite pastimes as a kid and part of this came out of the fact that my dad was a fireman in Detroit.

625
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:52,545
Rym: We lived there in the 80s.

626
00:41:52,946 --> 00:41:54,773
Rym: If you don't know much about the city of Detroit.

627
00:41:54,833 --> 00:42:04,940
Rym: I suggest you read about something called Devil's Knights But devil's night is sort of universal then no now Detroit devil's night is not like it is anywhere else.

628
00:42:05,562 --> 00:42:09,797
Rym: All right, it's better now, but back in the day the city fucking burned to the ground every year.

629
00:42:09,817 --> 00:42:11,164
Rym: Uh-huh It was bad.

630
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:15,945
Rym: We're talking fire bombs and houses Say Michigan cultural phenomenon.

631
00:42:15,985 --> 00:42:16,266
Scott: Yes.

632
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:18,492
Rym: I know my shit when it comes to Michigan.

633
00:42:18,652 --> 00:42:19,895
Rym: All right, don't you?

634
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:21,279
Rym: don't you be treading?

635
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,545
Scott: Decline of devil's night arson.

636
00:42:24,866 --> 00:42:31,219
Rym: Michigan's the only state as far as I know that is declared war both on a foreign nation and on another state.

637
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:33,810
Rym: But I digress.

638
00:42:34,273 --> 00:42:46,800
Rym: my dad was a fireman So when he was off-duty he still had the radio and everything and we had the police scanner and the fire scanner with the real chip so we could actually Listen everything and whenever there was a fire nearby or we'd also we'd always go for walks like the Sunday walk.

639
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,908
Rym: We just walk around the neighborhood.

640
00:42:47,928 --> 00:42:48,673
Rym: talked to all the people.

641
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:49,257
Rym: it was good fun.

642
00:42:49,297 --> 00:42:59,531
Rym: as a kid My dad could smell a fire from like 40 miles away And he could tell you if it was a car fire or a house fire or a factory fire or whatever And it was close enough.

643
00:42:59,813 --> 00:43:00,498
Rym: He could find it.

644
00:43:01,173 --> 00:43:03,200
Rym: so more often than you'd expect.

645
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:10,224
Rym: My family would show up at the scene of a fire and just kind of hang back and watch the house burn down and watch the Firefighters tried to.

646
00:43:10,264 --> 00:43:11,350
Scott: was your dad a fireman?

647
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,100
Scott: wasn't he supposed to save the people or whatever?

648
00:43:13,683 --> 00:43:14,688
Rym: Not when he's not on duty.

649
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:17,059
Rym: There were other firemen who were perfectly capable of doing that.

650
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:22,560
Scott: Really so like if you're a fireman and you walk past a fire you don't do anything cuz other firemen take care.

651
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:23,872
Rym: He didn't have any equipment on him.

652
00:43:23,912 --> 00:43:25,523
Rym: if there was an emergency I'm sure he would have.

653
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:31,912
Rym: but remember in an old house fire when like there's an old house that's on fire It's already too late to save the house.

654
00:43:31,952 --> 00:43:34,879
Rym: They're not trying to save the house They go in and save the people.

655
00:43:35,442 --> 00:43:40,479
Rym: Once the people are out their primary duty is to save the neighboring houses not to save your house.

656
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:42,560
Scott: That sucks also.

657
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:51,511
Rym: Detroit firefighters are one of the few fire departments left in America that if they're trying to save a building or put out a fire They practice internal firefighting meaning

658
00:43:51,994 --> 00:43:52,154
Scott: even

659
00:43:52,235 --> 00:43:57,674
Rym: if there's no one to save They will March into the building with hoses and put the fire out from the inside.

660
00:43:58,155 --> 00:43:59,098
Scott: Is that more effective?

661
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:01,415
Rym: Yes It's also much more dangerous.

662
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:10,500
Rym: I know that Most fire departments from what I've read Will fight the fire from the outside and do damage control more so than stopping the fire at its core.

663
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,306
Scott: Can you spray into the window or something?

664
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:13,250
Rym: Oh, you can you can.

665
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:16,080
Rym: hey, I'm not gonna talk about that in detail.

666
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:20,040
Rym: Maybe if you guys are interested I could do a special just when Scott's out of town about that.

667
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,376
Rym: But firefighting is pretty cool and it's kind of related.

668
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:24,020
Rym: It's all in the show.

669
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:24,904
Rym: I got an anecdote.

670
00:44:25,326 --> 00:44:27,315
Rym: My dad wanted to be a policeman when he was young.

671
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:37,080
Rym: Mm-hmm and his father and his father's father were firemen and His dad when he learned that my dad wanted to be a fireman as policeman of a policeman?

672
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,550
Rym: Yes, yes as two very appointed questions.

673
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,172
Rym: He said first.

674
00:44:40,795 --> 00:44:42,080
Rym: Do you know any happy firemen?

675
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:45,679
Rym: Yeah, you and Bob and all the people we know and yeah, they're all pretty happy.

676
00:44:46,301 --> 00:44:47,685
Rym: Do you know any happy cops?

677
00:44:48,788 --> 00:44:52,238
Rym: and I know that we lived in Detroit at the time and my dad became a fireman.

678
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:56,418
Rym: Yep You got any fire anecdotes before we end this.

679
00:44:57,417 --> 00:45:00,752
Scott: Um We saw that car fire as we draw.

680
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:02,380
Rym: Yeah, it was kind of crazy.

681
00:45:03,082 --> 00:45:05,870
Scott: We I forget where we were driving from or to.

682
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:06,713
Scott: was it.

683
00:45:07,254 --> 00:45:09,180
Scott: I don't was it from Otakon to the shore?

684
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:09,944
Scott: I don't even remember.

685
00:45:09,964 --> 00:45:11,372
Rym: I think we were driving to Albany.

686
00:45:11,955 --> 00:45:12,799
Rym: I don't remember at all.

687
00:45:13,181 --> 00:45:20,800
Scott: But basically we driving and we saw like a huge plume of black smoke and we're like, whoa big fire.

688
00:45:21,443 --> 00:45:27,467
Scott: We go around this corner on the highway and there's a van and Basically, the van is super on fire.

689
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:31,960
Scott: like fire is coming out all the windows of this minivan coming out of the front of the car.

690
00:45:32,122 --> 00:45:33,520
Scott: It's just super on fire.

691
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,599
Scott: It looks like someone poured gas in the car and then threw a match in there and ran away.

692
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:41,194
Rym: now Luckily, we saw obviously the entire family standing back from it.

693
00:45:41,435 --> 00:45:41,937
Scott: Did we see?

694
00:45:42,058 --> 00:45:42,560
Scott: I didn't see them.

695
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,348
Rym: I saw people standing back from the car.

696
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:46,880
Scott: Yeah, I didn't see people in the car or outside of the car.

697
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,827
Scott: So I wasn't sure they were standing way back.

698
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:52,359
Rym: All right, they definitely had the look on their faces of what the fuck.

699
00:45:52,974 --> 00:46:01,420
Scott: Yes But just for the thing that really makes this story is the fact that Was it slightly before we saw the fire or slightly after we saw the fire?

700
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,687
Rym: I think it was just after we saw the fire.

701
00:46:03,968 --> 00:46:11,019
Scott: a cop pulled over someone for like speeding on our side of the road while The giant fire was on the other side of the road and there was no EMS or police at that fire.

702
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:11,200
Rym: yet.

703
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:20,713
Rym: No it was just a car on fire on the side of the road and we know they knew because I called 911 and I said car fire and they can tell where I am from the GPS whatever.

704
00:46:21,054 --> 00:46:27,372
Rym: and they said on the throughway I'm like, yeah, he's like my marker X and I'm like, yeah, he's like.

705
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:28,013
Rym: we know about it.

706
00:46:28,575 --> 00:46:29,437
Rym: Thanks click.

707
00:46:29,918 --> 00:46:30,139
Rym: Mm-hmm.

708
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:32,419
Rym: Yeah, good times.

709
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:34,699
Scott: Fire eyes are awesome.

710
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:39,080
Rym: I imagine we'll do more fire episodes in the future when we have nothing better to talk about.

711
00:46:39,803 --> 00:46:43,739
Rym: If you have ideas for Thursday shows tell us or else you can hear about fire some more.

712
00:46:44,463 --> 00:46:46,452
Rym: Granted I think I could talk more about fire.

713
00:46:46,693 --> 00:46:50,912
Rym: I'm starting to remember a bunch of Situations I've been in in my life that involve fire.

714
00:46:51,133 --> 00:46:51,314
Rym: Yep.

715
00:46:51,716 --> 00:47:01,280
