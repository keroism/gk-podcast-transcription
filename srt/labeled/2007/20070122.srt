1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,380
Scott: It's Monday January 22nd.

2
00:00:12,881 --> 00:00:15,470
Scott: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:16,453 --> 00:00:18,409
Scott: Tonight we discuss text editing.

4
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,305
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:25,921
Scott: I'm super super super bored at work lately.

6
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,410
Rym: How bored could you be more bored than usual?

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:35,100
Rym: I think the amount of work we do at any given time is inversely proportional Because I've actually been doing a lot of work at work.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,944
Rym: In fact tomorrow.

9
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:37,049
Rym: I'm gonna be working late.

10
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:43,210
Scott: Yeah, I'm trying to actually find I'm putting more effort into finding new work, you know, all right.

11
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:52,778
Scott: Yeah, not it doesn't look like I go to the postings and stuff and there's a few good things and I send applications But you know, it's there's not.

12
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:53,179
Scott: it's not like.

13
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,005
Scott: there's a plethora of awesomeness.

14
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:56,710
Scott: mostly it's because I'm too picky.

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,797
Scott: I'm like, no not that one.

16
00:00:58,018 --> 00:00:58,582
Scott: Not that one.

17
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:06,470
Scott: No, no Yeah, actually what I'm doing more at work than programming is building furniture.

18
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:11,851
Rym: Well, if they're paying you a programmer's salary to build furniture Well, you know It's just.

19
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:15,490
Scott: they brought all this furniture to the office and a lot of it's not built.

20
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:18,083
Scott: So I just kind of when I got nothing better to do.

21
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,390
Scott: I build a piece of furniture.

22
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:22,201
Rym: I just would have built it all in like one week and been done with it.

23
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:22,763
Scott: Yeah.

24
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:30,455
Scott: Yeah, I could have done that but I'm pretty good at but building together Three file rolling cabinets.

25
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:40,129
Scott: This is one bitch though because the bottom drawer has a wheel on the bottom of it because it could The way it works and it's really a bitch to get that wheel on there.

26
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:43,358
Rym: Well, why don't you subcontract this out?

27
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,950
Scott: All right, come to my office and we'll put together furniture.

28
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:54,457
Rym: I'll do it for 98% of your salary No Of your salary to me.

29
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:57,830
Scott: Yeah sure for the privilege of being allowed to put together the furniture.

30
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:00,710
Rym: Yeah, now you might be wondering rims working late tomorrow.

31
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:04,314
Rym: What happened to his philosophy of 40 hours?

32
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:12,550
Rym: and I can say very simply that by working late that one day I will in turn get an extra vacation day with which I could go to Katsucon.

33
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,570
Scott: Whoo-hoo, so it's kind of a profit because you're not gonna be working eight hours late.

34
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:23,009
Rym: Plus I'm going to get two days worth of work done for one day's commute.

35
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:25,581
Scott: Mmm, that's a good deal.

36
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:27,027
Rym: Yeah, not too bad at all.

37
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:27,710
Rym: I should do this more often.

38
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,126
Rym: I wish I could work holidays cuz my company crazily reimburses me.

39
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,937
Rym: if I work a holiday I'll work not.

40
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:36,650
Scott: let you work a holiday when you want it to they never let me work holidays?

41
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:37,497
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

42
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:38,729
Scott: no we don't want to pay you that money.

43
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,570
Rym: Yes, even though I'm salaried I get time and a half and an extra vacation day and all this other stuff.

44
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,429
Scott: Yeah, I gotta ask for Katsucon off.

45
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:48,921
Rym: All right, you'd better do that cuz we're slated to be there.

46
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:50,527
Scott: It's not really like I ask.

47
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:54,126
Scott: it's I tell I'm not going to be there these days.

48
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:57,638
Scott: See ya, yep, right.

49
00:02:57,698 --> 00:03:10,989
Rym: so being science and tech day which also includes internet stuff in the news Wikipedia is Changing one of their policies regarding links and from now on any link going out of Wikipedia will be no-follow.

50
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:12,837
Scott: Don't know now?

51
00:03:13,138 --> 00:03:16,774
Rym: if you don't know what that means very simply I'll know.

52
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:20,389
Rym: follow link is a link that search engines know to ignore.

53
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:26,484
Scott: Yeah, what happened is a lot people have blogs and you can post comments on blogs.

54
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:34,316
Scott: now the way Google works is if there Are a lot of websites out in the world that link to your website Your website goes up in Google.

55
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:39,650
Rym: so and the higher up those websites that link to you are the more booze They give to you when they link to you, right?

56
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:51,848
Scott: So let's say in the olden days I would go to a popular blog a very popular blog with a high page rank and many visitors and I would post a comment And in that comment, I would link to my website.

57
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:54,417
Scott: now Maybe no one will click on that link.

58
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:55,320
Scott: That's fine.

59
00:03:55,781 --> 00:04:02,387
Scott: Because now if people search for certain things on Google My website will be much higher up possibly on the front page.

60
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:07,230
Scott: now Imagine if I post comments on lots of blogs now, we got trouble.

61
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:23,470
Scott: So they invented this thing called rel equals no follow and what they do is in your blog software You make it so that when anyone posts a comment to your blog that it's a no-follow link Which means the search engine ignores it in terms of ranking.

62
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:30,410
Scott: So no matter how many no-follow blogs you put comments with links to your website on it's not gonna help you out.

63
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:33,454
Rym: Now this isn't like a mandatory Technological thing.

64
00:04:33,494 --> 00:04:35,803
Rym: It's just data that our search engine can use.

65
00:04:35,823 --> 00:04:37,590
Rym: I mean if Google really wanted they could ignore this.

66
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:38,614
Scott: Yeah, they could.

67
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:40,521
Scott: it's actually something they invented.

68
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:49,878
Scott: Yes, hence to help out blog spam It basically says hey blog spammers come spam all you want It's not gonna help you because there's no follow.

69
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,290
Rym: Yeah, it's not like anyone actually follows those spam links and blogs.

70
00:04:53,531 --> 00:05:03,010
Scott: Yeah, and there's actually a program a kismet which for WordPress at least I don't know if it works in other blog software that filters out blog spam very effectively.

71
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:09,639
Rym: Yeah, now the issue with Wikipedia was that I mean if you just tried to stick links to your crap Anywhere normal, yeah,

72
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:19,369
Scott: like let's say I had a website about Pharmaceutical drugs, I'd go to like the Wikipedia page for the disease That's related to those drugs and put links to my crap drugstore.

73
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:23,870
Rym: Well now you like in general just you could just put links in high-traffic areas to get traffic.

74
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,801
Rym: But Wikipedia mods are smart and those links disappear immediately.

75
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:31,190
Scott: Yeah, they disappear pretty quickly, but you know almost immediately.

76
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:33,210
Rym: There's very rarely in high-traffic areas.

77
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,882
Rym: Is there any vandalism like that for any length of time?

78
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:39,290
Rym: links are looked at much more readily than small changes

79
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:39,911
Scott: yep,

80
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:55,542
Rym: but the problem was people were going to not often visited web pages in Wikipedia or discussion pages or Areas where there wouldn't be people and they would just post link after link after link to their stupid Bullshit website trying to get to click through money, whatever.

81
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:57,430
Rym: and they do this to raise their page rank.

82
00:05:58,355 --> 00:05:59,522
Rym: So now this won't work.

83
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:00,890
Rym: So those people can keep doing that.

84
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:04,450
Rym: It doesn't hurt Wikipedia because no one really goes to those parts of Wikipedia yet.

85
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,038
Rym: Anyway, but now those people are just wasting their time.

86
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:08,301
Rym: their links do absolutely nothing.

87
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:10,528
Scott: Oh, I guess it sucks for them.

88
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:26,862
Rym: now there are people on the internet complaining saying that this is somehow bad of Wikipedia or evil or wrong or hurts them in some way and I submit that the vast majority of people of those people are Scumbags who were profiting from this in some way and are now mad about it.

89
00:06:26,902 --> 00:06:31,730
Rym: I mean we get what we got Quite a bit of page rank from Wikipedia.

90
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:41,350
Rym: We're linked to on Wikipedia in several places because we have relevant interviews and content But we're not complaining about this at all because this is definitely what I think Wikipedia should do.

91
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:47,325
Rym: There should be no incentive to be linked to from Wikipedia Independent of the merit of your information.

92
00:06:47,727 --> 00:07:04,162
Scott: Yeah There are just too many people out there who try to do things like to increase their traffic to their websites and to their podcasts and to their blogs by means of simply creating content and Waiting for people to come.

93
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:14,426
Rym: by the same token the only people that use these services are people who either don't know better or Honestly, probably don't have content that deserves to be at the top of Google.

94
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:15,610
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

95
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,710
Scott: It seems to me like I look at it from two perspectives.

96
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:31,189
Scott: Is that like there's the sort of field of dreams model where you build it and they will come and it seems like any other Model you follow other than that Seems sort of illegitimate on the web.

97
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:45,864
Scott: Like the only way to go without people looking down upon you is to make a website and just hope people show up but at the same time it's like You can't do anything at all without people looking down on you except you really shouldn't be.

98
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:53,730
Rym: I mean buying ads somewhere is Different from that because that's straight up and while I don't look at ads at least it's a straight-up and open business transaction.

99
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:54,645
Rym: Nothing wrong with that.

100
00:07:55,412 --> 00:08:04,910
Rym: The problems when people try to game the system say Google doesn't rank your page highly That means that either no one else likes your page or your page has problems or your contents.

101
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:07,190
Scott: But what if just no one's discovered your page yet?

102
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,906
Scott: And it's actually really good and they never gonna discover it because it's so low on Google.

103
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:15,517
Scott: blabbity blabbity blah Argument that some asshole makes blah blah blah.

104
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:23,810
Rym: Well, my argument against that is that almost every major website out there now That's worth a damn grew entirely by random word-of-mouth.

105
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:28,850
Scott: Yeah, you didn't see dig doing any of this search engine optimization crap.

106
00:08:29,131 --> 00:08:32,582
Scott: Yeah that you didn't see YouTube doing any of this search engine optimization.

107
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:34,590
Rym: that GeekNights podcast never did any of that.

108
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,352
Scott: Yeah, it's the.

109
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:39,929
Scott: simply by the merit of what they offered on their website They became popular.

110
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:45,650
Rym: Remember there are people who will troll around the bottom of Google looking for cool stuff to try to be the first one to dig.

111
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:51,568
Rym: If your content is out there and is worth a damn odds are people are gonna find it one way or another.

112
00:08:51,588 --> 00:08:53,434
Rym: it might take a While but people will find it.

113
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:58,612
Scott: Yeah, and it's a good way to start is just it's okay to just tell your friends to go To your website.

114
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:03,790
Rym: Yeah, I mean God the front row crew going to our website was our only listenership for the first week.

115
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:04,783
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

116
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:10,289
Scott: Oh Okay, so I got two news's but I'm gonna combine them sort of uh-huh.

117
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,960
Scott: The first they're both news's about new versions of software.

118
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:19,715
Scott: the first version of software that came out is Xfce 4.4.

119
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:20,398
Scott: It just came out.

120
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:29,490
Scott: for those of you don't know on Linux There are many many different desktops you can choose from but Xfce is the third most popular for good reason.

121
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:30,635
Rym: I prefer gnome.

122
00:09:30,857 --> 00:09:33,288
Scott: Yeah gnome is you know GTK?

123
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:41,110
Scott: It's based on the GTK GUI library and KDE is based on the QT GUI library And QT can die in respective fires.

124
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:45,950
Rym: Well, I'll admit I have not used KDE in about two years.

125
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:52,934
Scott: I used to use KDE and now I'm still probably not gonna use KDE but I'm realizing a lot of KDE Applications are pretty good.

126
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,157
Rym: Yeah, but I use though.

127
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:55,361
Rym: I just have QT install.

128
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:55,662
Rym: Yeah.

129
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:55,843
Scott: Yeah.

130
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:56,364
Scott: Yeah, me too.

131
00:09:56,585 --> 00:09:56,705
Scott: Okay.

132
00:09:56,866 --> 00:10:01,830
Scott: Anyway Xfce Uses the same library as gnome, but it's light.

133
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:08,547
Scott: It's sort of like no it's you know, people would get pissed if you called it gnome light But that's kind of what it is.

134
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:15,319
Scott: It's it's light It's fast but it has all the desktop II features that you need and none of the ones you don't.

135
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:25,109
Scott: and if you want to try out Xfce a Good way to do it is to use Zubuntu XUBUNTU, you know as opposed to kubuntu.

136
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:34,587
Scott: or Yes, ubuntu uses gnome Kubuntu uses KDE and Zubuntu with an X uses XFCE.

137
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:46,050
Scott: Now if you're already have like ubuntu installed you can apt-get install KDE desktop or oh I mean you can apt-get install kubuntu - desktop or Zubuntu - desktop.

138
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:52,689
Scott: So you can actually have all three of these things on one computer without having three separate operating systems.

139
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:56,365
Scott: Anyway in the new version of XFCE 4.4.

140
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,369
Scott: They added some new stuff.

141
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:06,889
Scott: First thing they added a new text editor, which is relevant to our show today Called mousepad and I haven't tried it so I can't say anything about it, but it looks pretty fun.

142
00:11:07,552 --> 00:11:13,070
Scott: The other thing they added is they made this is funny because Rym just had a panel with a problem with this two seconds ago.

143
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,469
Scott: Is they made their panel more stable?

144
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:23,450
Scott: Goddamn, basically The way the panel used to work is like if a part of the panel would crash the whole thing would crash.

145
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:27,650
Scott: Now every part of the panel gets its own separate process and everything.

146
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:37,410
Scott: So if like you install a panel applet that kind of sucks and it crashes It'll just disappear and your panel will still be there and it'll be more stable and awesome.

147
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:39,077
Rym: It wasn't just my panel that crashed though.

148
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:40,685
Rym: It was pretty much everything.

149
00:11:40,705 --> 00:11:43,124
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what happened I just within your known panel.

150
00:11:43,164 --> 00:11:43,730
Scott: Well, we got this.

151
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:53,858
Rym: I mean, it's the computer that with the $20 motherboard and just now before we did the show I booted it and Instead of booting like normal It's just one by one.

152
00:11:53,998 --> 00:12:01,190
Rym: every single thing that started on boot crashed And I think if I'd let it keep going eventually everything would have crashed maybe.

153
00:12:01,852 --> 00:12:05,040
Scott: But anyway, XFCE 4.4 is an awesome new version.

154
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:11,197
Scott: It has a lot of new features and bug fixes that I don't want to mention and You should definitely try.

155
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:12,203
Scott: if you're trying Linux.

156
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:17,683
Scott: You should at least try XFCE gnome and KDE to see which one you like best.

157
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:28,089
Scott: There are others out there, but Odds are if you are not a super nerd and super Linux master You're going to have a hard time using them because you won't have a clue what to do.

158
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:42,381
Rym: Actually, if you want to make a very customized but very not pretty One really really quickly and learn a lot about text editing config files Yeah, ice WM is a great way to go.

159
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:44,250
Scott: Yeah, I said, I don't know if that's still maintained.

160
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:45,058
Scott: I should go look that up.

161
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,169
Rym: I don't know either but I Before I left IBM I standardized them on that.

162
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:53,787
Scott: Yeah, it's a good one, especially when you need stability and users don't need to do too much.

163
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:54,550
Rym: Yeah good one.

164
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,990
Rym: I mean, honestly, I would still recommend ice WM if you're gonna make a grandma PC because it's just I don't know about that.

165
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:02,888
Scott: XFCE is pretty good for a grandma PC.

166
00:13:03,471 --> 00:13:09,091
Rym: I mean remember cuz grandma if she's ever used a computer before then you can make it look exactly like Windows 98.

167
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:13,590
Scott: There's actually another desktop environment that looks exactly like Windows, but I forget what it's called.

168
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:17,415
Rym: Yeah, well, I mean you can make it look like it with the start menu But just don't add anything else to it.

169
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:21,305
Rym: So the start menu just has internet email.

170
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:31,073
Scott: Yeah, and mp3 player Yeah, anyway, the other big software release that just happened minutes ago is WordPress 2.1.

171
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:32,641
Scott: Oh, baby, you know what they got in this.

172
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:33,567
Scott: Oh, you're gonna like this.

173
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:34,070
Rym: What are they at?

174
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:34,571
Rym: I didn't.

175
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:36,077
Rym: I didn't even look at the changelog ready.

176
00:13:36,137 --> 00:13:38,626
Scott: I'm not installing it on our servers yet.

177
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:39,750
Rym: install it on the test server.

178
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,120
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna but you're gonna have to wait for the real server.

179
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,807
Scott: But anyway, you ready wanted to be in production.

180
00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:45,294
Scott: now You're ready for this.

181
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:45,596
Scott: Okay.

182
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:45,978
Scott: Here you go.

183
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,390
Scott: first auto saving of drafts.

184
00:13:50,332 --> 00:14:00,718
Rym: I will note that in the last year or give or take I have probably lost maybe 30 posts To timeouts or internet blips or whatnot.

185
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:06,156
Scott: So this is hotness with the Ajax number two better image upload Handling.

186
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:19,094
Scott: we don't do that too often But if you if you're the kind of person who makes blog posts with pictures in them It's real easy to just upload them from the WordPress interface without having to upload them manually by some other means and Something like that.

187
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:23,106
Scott: It can also like thumbnail them and all kinds of stuff for you.

188
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:28,146
Rym: You don't have to do much Depending on how we change up the website when we eventually update it.

189
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:31,975
Scott: Yep They've got a new Migrator thing.

190
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:35,910
Scott: So if you're upgrading from an old version of WordPress, it's easier to get to this new version.

191
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:39,241
Scott: Old plugins are might not work.

192
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,050
Rym: Oh, that's a great feature.

193
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,519
Scott: They're no longer supporting MySQL 3.23.

194
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,470
Scott: You have to use MySQL 4 or higher, which is probably something you should be doing.

195
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:54,625
Scott: Anyway, yeah The visual editing interface the rich text editor no longer sucks.

196
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,030
Rym: We'll see about that.

197
00:14:56,491 --> 00:15:01,710
Scott: They've actually got two tabs visual and code instead of having the HTML code pop up.

198
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:04,897
Scott: Yeah, they it supposedly sucks.

199
00:15:05,158 --> 00:15:11,072
Rym: now not I wonder if it'll work because I noticed something really weird about WordPress editing in that Box currently.

200
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:17,350
Rym: Mm-hmm if I use opera versus new Firefox versus old Firefox it behaves completely differently.

201
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,162
Scott: Yeah, it uses a thing right now.

202
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:25,730
Scott: It uses a thing called Tiny MCE and I don't know much about that thing, but it doesn't work.

203
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,730
Scott: Well, and they've they've updated the rich text editor significantly.

204
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:32,230
Scott: We'll test it on the test server to see how much better it is.

205
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:41,670
Scott: I actually become so frustrated with the old rich text editor that I stopped using it And I put the I turned off rich text editing in my options.

206
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:46,748
Rym: Yeah, I never did that just because it works as long as I use the one version of Firefox.

207
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:47,250
Rym: It seems to work.

208
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:49,630
Scott: Okay, you know, here's a big deal change already.

209
00:15:50,310 --> 00:16:00,856
Scott: They've merged links and categories because they realize that Links are really only being used for like blog roles and that sort of silliness And there's not really a point.

210
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:05,774
Scott: so they just made links and categories the same kind of thing Uh-huh.

211
00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:08,790
Scott: So what happens if you upgrade from an old WordPress?

212
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:15,755
Scott: They put all your links into the bra into the blog role category and that's it All right, then.

213
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:19,090
Scott: Yeah, so now it you know, there's no longer this weird.

214
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:23,350
Scott: Just you can't just make big lists of links for no reason you put them in categories.

215
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,728
Scott: there might be posts in those categories too and I think that's actually makes a lot more sense.

216
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:30,090
Scott: and can You could do a lot more interesting things.

217
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:34,150
Rym: Yeah, that's something I might want to poke around with just to see how they've done it and how we could make use of it.

218
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:36,210
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what we want.

219
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:42,330
Scott: Anyway, plus I really don't like a lot all those WordPress blogs that have just piles of links on the side.

220
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,902
Scott: Yeah, that's always such a like a low-class style.

221
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,488
Scott: It's like what are you doing, man?

222
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:48,170
Scott: I don't want that.

223
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:49,495
Rym: I mean what I don't mind.

224
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:59,570
Rym: and one of the ideas I've been tossing around and sketching for the site is You know some sites like penny arcade has the main thing and then each person can has but mega Tokyo is a good example.

225
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:02,881
Rym: Each person has like a little box where they say stuff.

226
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:04,145
Scott: Oh, it's a good idea.

227
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:06,433
Rym: Yeah, I'll show you the design I've been working on.

228
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:07,196
Rym: Uh-huh.

229
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:08,382
Rym: I had some idle time today.

230
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,267
Scott: I didn't think about that.

231
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:09,910
Scott: I can go for that.

232
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:12,740
Rym: Yeah, well big changes coming possibly.

233
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,650
Rym: Yeah, we'll see how well our ideas actually work on a website.

234
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:21,810
Rym: But in a situation like that, I see nothing wrong with each person having like a box in their box.

235
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,421
Rym: It's like my current hot link or whatever.

236
00:17:24,662 --> 00:17:25,906
Rym: I've seen people do that too.

237
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:29,765
Scott: Okay effect Yeah, but I'm not a fan of like the links on their own.

238
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:29,966
Scott: like.

239
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:31,358
Scott: here's some sites You should check out.

240
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:35,570
Scott: then like ten links I like the ones where if you're gonna send me a link to something, right?

241
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,170
Scott: You should write a post and then link the words in the post like, you know, you're saying something.

242
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,850
Rym: Well, I mean it does depend on what you're doing.

243
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:55,810
Scott: Like if you're a webcomic and you are like affiliated or friends with ten other webcomics and you all put like an affiliate section I would just see in that kind of case What you would do is let's say you were all the same kind of webcomic, right?

244
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,278
Scott: You would make up something make a web ring.

245
00:17:58,398 --> 00:17:58,559
Scott: Yeah.

246
00:17:58,659 --> 00:17:59,743
Scott: No, you don't make a web ring.

247
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:00,627
Scott: That's the old style.

248
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:14,589
Scott: what you do now for example a lot of podcasters are doing this is they say we're part of the so and so podcast network and then they set up another website for the podcast network and Everyone on their own podcast websites puts like a little badge.

249
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:19,620
Scott: I'll admit though that and in their podcast They say we're a member of the such-and-such podcast network.

250
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,725
Rym: a lot of people who do that.

251
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:24,999
Rym: if you google for their podcast You get the network page first and it's just confusing.

252
00:18:25,219 --> 00:18:25,500
Scott: Yeah.

253
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,910
Scott: Yeah, that's I'm not notice how we haven't joined any podcast networks.

254
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,690
Rym: Well also because we dislike the vast majority of podcast.

255
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:37,830
Rym: I know but I mean pretty much the podcast we like are mostly the podcasts that we're friends with the people who do this.

256
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:43,407
Rym: Yeah, I don't know if it's if one causes the other or if it's just a coincidence or or what.

257
00:18:43,508 --> 00:18:43,688
Rym: but

258
00:18:44,029 --> 00:19:03,190
Scott: yeah another thing that WordPress has come out with in for in the newest version that someone might care about is There's a lot of privacy features where you can easily without, you know Editing robots dot text files make your blog private and keep it out of search engines and directories and all sorts of stuff.

259
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:10,717
Scott: So if you want to make a blog just for your family or just for your friends or you know Keep at the whole world from looking at it.

260
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,351
Scott: You can do that now with WordPress very easily Huh.

261
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:23,720
Scott: or as before that was slightly more difficult because you know anyone could read the blog but you know Only certain people could get into the posting interface now.

262
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,084
Scott: You can just keep everyone out of your blog.

263
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:25,766
Scott: make a private blog.

264
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,933
Rym: I Don't I don't.

265
00:19:27,994 --> 00:19:29,238
Rym: I don't see many people doing that.

266
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,162
Rym: I don't think I don't see.

267
00:19:30,283 --> 00:19:35,490
Scott: it says it even says pro bloggers Will not find this useful nor will most bloggers who desire expose.

268
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:41,892
Rym: Well, I mean there aren't many people out there who do a blog for any reason other than to get the word out to people They don't know.

269
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:44,986
Rym: Yeah, I mean I guess other than the live journal types.

270
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:50,813
Scott: Mm-hmm But even useful though, like if you want like a shared Journal among.

271
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:54,710
Rym: Oh, yeah, I agree entirely, but I don't think many people think to do things like that.

272
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,445
Scott: No, this isn't gonna be a very widely used feature.

273
00:19:57,465 --> 00:19:58,390
Scott: It's just an interesting fee.

274
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:03,382
Rym: Well, like the front row crew look at us we have I mean, no no, you can see it But you know, our forums are pretty cool.

275
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:04,450
Rym: inside of there.

276
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:11,689
Rym: We have our own private forums that we just use for our internal friendly business Mm-hmm, and we had a wiki for a while, but no one used it.

277
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:18,370
Scott: Yeah The other thing is there's some other changes to stuff under the hood for people who make plugins and themes and all that.

278
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,401
Scott: But you don't care about that stuff.

279
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:20,088
Rym: Not at all.

280
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,877
Scott: But yeah WordPress 2.1 the hotness.

281
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:28,525
Scott: if you're blogging you should jump on this because it came out just now two seconds ago.

282
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:40,410
Rym: Now before we get to the things today and all that one quick little meta bit of information for all you out there I see once again A lot of people are joining the forums and I noticed that a lot of the people who joined the forums never posted.

283
00:20:40,937 --> 00:20:51,257
Rym: There's a good chance Like with many of the people who joined our forums that if you use hotmail or pretty much any non good email That our confirmation hotmail.

284
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:55,550
Rym: Yes our confirmation slash acceptance email that we sent to you was not received.

285
00:20:56,052 --> 00:21:01,310
Rym: I can tell you all that I have not denied a single person entrance to the forums in the last two months.

286
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:07,637
Rym: Yeah, so if you didn't hear back from us if I log it into your account, it probably just works Yep, and you can start posting.

287
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,084
Scott: I remember I would be on the forums.

288
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:10,430
Scott: Someone would apply for membership.

289
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,141
Scott: I would approve it before they had even left the forums.

290
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:14,164
Scott: They were still there.

291
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,570
Scott: They just registered.

292
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:18,529
Scott: I can still see their name on the left side of the page.

293
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:24,747
Rym: Yeah, the only people I've ever denied access to were flaming geek 3.0 through 6.0.

294
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:34,724
Rym: Yeah Yeah Things of the day.

295
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:36,912
Rym: now, I might be a psychic.

296
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:38,920
Rym: So I'm gonna have to call Randy on this one.

297
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,152
Rym: You'll have to back me up on this.

298
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,217
Rym: I predict that Sylvia Brown is a fraud.

299
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:47,426
Scott: Well, that doesn't really count.

300
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:48,631
Scott: You're not predicting the future.

301
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:50,238
Scott: You're stating a fact about the present.

302
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:53,794
Rym: fine She will continue to be a fraud in the future.

303
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:59,819
Scott: Oh You know what gravity will Continue to function.

304
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:05,780
Rym: Well, you see the difference between these two claims is that the laws of thermodynamics will remain true.

305
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:14,180
Rym: No, the difference between these two claims is that we're not entirely sure if gravity will always work But we do know that Sylvia Brown will always be a fraud.

306
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,711
Rym: Now my news isn't that Sylvia Brown is a fraud.

307
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:21,060
Rym: nor is my thing of the day the fact that Sylvia Brown is a fraud.

308
00:22:21,421 --> 00:22:22,745
Rym: That is common knowledge.

309
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:24,812
Rym: At least I wish it was common knowledge.

310
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:27,400
Rym: I pray every day that it would become common knowledge.

311
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:28,788
Scott: I don't think the pranks gonna help.

312
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,919
Rym: Well, no, I pray to the Sun and Joe Pesci.

313
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:38,679
Rym: Okay, but no the news that my thing of the day here is very simply probably the best debunking video of her.

314
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:41,990
Rym: yet You see she's been a consummate jackass for a long time.

315
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,880
Rym: A lot of people believe in this including Montel Williams.

316
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:46,229
Scott: I don't think he actually.

317
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:47,477
Scott: I don't know if he actually believes.

318
00:22:47,537 --> 00:22:47,920
Scott: I think you know.

319
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,320
Scott: I just has nothing better to put in his boring ass daytime.

320
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,740
Scott: You know what?

321
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,526
Rym: I submit that whether or not he believes has no bearing on the fact that he acts like he does in a public forum and Openly supports this BS.

322
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:57,888
Scott: Yep.

323
00:22:58,008 --> 00:23:00,419
Scott: He's not a good dude in my book, but not at all.

324
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:02,930
Scott: No daytime talk people are good in my book.

325
00:23:03,271 --> 00:23:09,200
Scott: unless somehow I got a daytime talk gig Then I would have the best daytime talk show ever.

326
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:13,018
Rym: You know, I think back to that old penny arcade where they gave gave a morning show.

327
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:15,131
Rym: Fuck you, it's early.

328
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:15,534
Scott: Fuck.

329
00:23:15,815 --> 00:23:19,457
Rym: Yeah And then they can just like that just like that.

330
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:21,500
Rym: Anyway.

331
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:32,288
Rym: So she did some particularly assheadish things lately and this CNN bit is basically a compilation of the Consummate douchebag that is Sylvia Brown.

332
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:34,395
Scott: Yeah your kid that's missing.

333
00:23:34,415 --> 00:23:36,662
Scott: Yeah, he died as Hispanic.

334
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:37,946
Scott: I killed him in the woods.

335
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:38,548
Rym: Yeah.

336
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:42,200
Scott: Yeah now let's have the rescue workers search these woods for now.

337
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,103
Scott: What hours?

338
00:23:43,284 --> 00:23:44,930
Scott: one based on some lady's guess.

339
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:51,080
Rym: I blame Sylvia Brown for you know, whatever I blame the police for even listening to this woman.

340
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:53,389
Rym: What the hell is wrong with that police department.

341
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,416
Scott: a lot of stupid police departments are there.

342
00:23:55,436 --> 00:23:56,380
Scott: police are just people.

343
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,480
Scott: They're no smarter or dumber than anyone.

344
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,720
Rym: Yeah, all detectives are smarter, but the police should know better and if he doesn't he shouldn't be a police chief anymore.

345
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:06,733
Scott: Yeah, that really police chief.

346
00:24:07,277 --> 00:24:07,639
Scott: I don't know.

347
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:13,060
Rym: I mean It's one thing a police chief might disagree on whether or not the drug war is a good thing or a police chief might disagree.

348
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:15,897
Rym: What constitutes a good interrogation of a suspect?

349
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:22,660
Rym: But there shouldn't be any debate among police chiefs as to whether or not psychics can find kidnap people.

350
00:24:23,823 --> 00:24:25,319
Rym: Yeah, the answer is no.

351
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:27,653
Scott: Hey, I could find one better.

352
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:28,056
Scott: You know, I'll do.

353
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:35,998
Rym: I guess I'm sensing a triangle like some kind of triangle shape near where you're going to find the body some kind of tall maybe.

354
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:43,411
Rym: a tree Starts with a T triangle trapezoid train tracks Something with a T like that.

355
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:44,539
Rym: see where I'm going.

356
00:24:45,322 --> 00:24:45,635
Scott: trap.

357
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:51,750
Scott: Yeah, so this is actually a pretty cool video.

358
00:24:52,581 --> 00:25:07,227
Scott: You ever been on an airplane need to look out the window and you look at the wing and the wing just kind of goes Wobble wobble wobble wobble, you know and you go whoa, it's sometimes in this turbulence The wing goes wobble wobble wobble wobble wobble wobble wobble and you go Whoa, look at that wing flapping around like that.

359
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:10,098
Rym: I remember the first time I flew with Cessna and the whole plane did that.

360
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:17,999
Scott: Yeah Yeah, no But like the first few times I flew and I'd look out at the wing and I would see it flapping and be like whoa Is the way you know?

361
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,909
Scott: Cuz you look at a wing on a big commercial jet.

362
00:25:20,949 --> 00:25:27,755
Scott: when it's on the ground and it's a big metal wing You're like if you jumped and like tried to hang on it with your hands.

363
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:28,880
Scott: It wouldn't move.

364
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:32,875
Scott: It's like a big piece of metal with a bajillion bolts in it.

365
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:34,080
Scott: It ain't going anywhere.

366
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:40,160
Scott: Well, apparently turbulence and jet engine speeds are fast enough to make a wing bounce around.

367
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:43,993
Scott: Well, just how much can that wing bounce around?

368
00:25:44,073 --> 00:25:48,517
Scott: What if the turbulence is so crazy, you know The wings got a break sometime now, I guess.

369
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:51,109
Rym: more importantly How do you figure out the point at which the wing will break?

370
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,819
Rym: and apparently the answer is the same answer that?

371
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,736
Rym: Calvin's dad gives to him as to how they figure out how much weight a bridge can hold.

372
00:25:58,178 --> 00:26:08,459
Scott: Yep So they made a Boeing 777 and they tied a bunch of cables and shit to the wing and they bent the wing until it broke.

373
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:12,268
Scott: and They had a prediction for when they thought the wing would break.

374
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,380
Scott: and they discovered the reality for when the ring would break.

375
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:18,813
Scott: I will leave those to be a mystery.

376
00:26:19,034 --> 00:26:20,060
Scott: You can watch the video.

377
00:26:20,301 --> 00:26:21,023
Scott: You can watch them.

378
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:30,115
Scott: bend this wing until it breaks and then you will probably have a lot of confidence about flying Unless you're one of those stupid people who are afraid of flying in commercial jets.

379
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,064
Scott: cuz you're the pussy I don't know.

380
00:26:32,728 --> 00:26:33,734
Scott: There's nothing to be afraid of.

381
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:36,827
Scott: freaking flying Goddamn depends on what airline.

382
00:26:36,948 --> 00:26:39,058
Rym: if I'm flying out of I don't know Mogadishu.

383
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:39,299
Scott: Okay.

384
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:43,192
Scott: Yeah Okay, the only airline you have to worry about is oh, what's that come?

385
00:26:43,232 --> 00:26:44,657
Scott: What's that country in Dilbert?

386
00:26:44,877 --> 00:26:53,893
Scott: Oh albonia albonian Airlines you have to worry but a Commercial jet in the United States.

387
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:55,924
Scott: I Worry about it.

388
00:26:56,185 --> 00:26:56,747
Rym: No, is it just me?

389
00:26:56,788 --> 00:26:59,780
Rym: or is Dilbert not been funny for the last like five years?

390
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,708
Scott: Dilbert is funny once every four months.

391
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:02,712
Scott: I've discovered.

392
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:04,800
Rym: Ah, so that's the current period.

393
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,554
Scott: Well, actually since I have like a Dilbert tear-off calendar and I read Dilbert on the website.

394
00:27:09,654 --> 00:27:17,009
Scott: It's funny once every other month until you get repeats But it's a you don't remember Dilbert.

395
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:18,153
Scott: So it's if it's a reef.

396
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:19,900
Rym: I remember all the Dilbert I read.

397
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:20,644
Scott: I don't.

398
00:27:20,885 --> 00:27:23,399
Scott: well the thing is I remember how they remember the memorable ones.

399
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:25,746
Rym: I remember each archetypical joke.

400
00:27:25,786 --> 00:27:26,508
Rym: Just like I know.

401
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:28,574
Rym: I remember every single Garfield ever.

402
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:30,058
Scott: Oh, well Garfield.

403
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:30,921
Scott: It's the same thing Isn't it?

404
00:27:31,022 --> 00:27:32,509
Scott: It's time again one day.

405
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:33,775
Rym: I'm tired.

406
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:38,060
Rym: I like lasagna But dog off the table, there's normal.

407
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:40,411
Rym: John Arbuckle is gay.

408
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:41,358
Scott: You can't get a woman.

409
00:27:42,566 --> 00:27:43,299
Rym: They got that guy?

410
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,985
Scott: Yeah, yeah Right.

411
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:52,840
Rym: So this might sound like a strange topic But it's something that a lot of people don't actually have much experience with and also we're tired.

412
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:54,077
Rym: So this is a nice quick one.

413
00:27:54,802 --> 00:28:03,700
Rym: You see a lot of people edit text very often yet They never really think about what kind of text editor they use or they never think about what?

414
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:09,900
Rym: Text editing really means or how certain tasks in text editing could possibly be done more efficiently.

415
00:28:10,301 --> 00:28:12,890
Scott: Yeah, there are many many things that do a text editing.

416
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,258
Scott: So we're just gonna talk about text editing now at first.

417
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:22,148
Rym: before anything we really have to clarify that text editing and Layout and design are entirely different things.

418
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:30,740
Scott: Well word processing desktop publishing text editing These are all very different things, even though to the layman they might seem to be the same thing.

419
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,129
Rym: Yeah cuz I mean you use Microsoft Word and what does it show?

420
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:40,939
Rym: you shows you a piece of paper with a cursor on it and It shows you what font you're using and how big that font is and some margins and all this business.

421
00:28:41,563 --> 00:28:52,639
Rym: So you're you're creating your content your text Simultaneously you're creating your layout you're creating your style You're creating every aspect of that document in real time all at the same time.

422
00:28:53,061 --> 00:28:55,893
Rym: Yep, now a lot of people have complained that.

423
00:28:56,174 --> 00:29:04,733
Rym: you know, sometimes it's confusing, you know I want to just write my essay But I spend 10 minutes looking at fonts and then I think about the word art I want to put in and and then I hit enter and it doesn't.

424
00:29:05,095 --> 00:29:05,980
Rym: it makes a weird paragraph.

425
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:08,076
Rym: I didn't want it to and I have to back up and try to make it.

426
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:08,559
Rym: undo that.

427
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:14,020
Rym: That's because you're trying to make text in something that is designed to do something far different than just make text.

428
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,120
Scott: Yeah, well, actually if you're writing a paper, you should be using a word processor.

429
00:29:18,221 --> 00:29:19,751
Scott: You should just also learn how to use it.

430
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:22,243
Scott: So that doesn't happen to you More and more.

431
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:28,260
Rym: I prefer to write documents just straight-up text demarcated by paragraph and then I formatted later.

432
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:29,524
Scott: Yeah, that's alright.

433
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:34,060
Scott: But anyway a text editor is something very different from word processor.

434
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:36,988
Scott: All it does is write text files.

435
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:41,520
Scott: a text file is basically just a big long string of characters.

436
00:29:41,943 --> 00:29:44,480
Scott: Some of those characters are the new line character.

437
00:29:44,881 --> 00:29:55,454
Scott: so that's how you get multiple lines of text, but it's really just a big long line of letters and spaces and Punctuation marks and new lines and carriage returns and all those sorts of things

438
00:29:55,574 --> 00:29:58,706
Rym: all encoded in like ASCII or Unicode But you don't need to care about that.

439
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:00,234
Scott: Yeah, you know that that's not important.

440
00:30:00,696 --> 00:30:14,080
Scott: So Basically, hey if you're not trying to you know, make margins or italics or bold sir or anything like that You need to put text into a file a text file for which there are many many uses that you will discuss.

441
00:30:14,907 --> 00:30:16,299
Scott: There's a lot of ways to do that.

442
00:30:16,641 --> 00:30:24,144
Rym: Yeah for most of you who use Windows probably the the text editor you have the most experience with is Notepad dot exe.

443
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:26,730
Scott: Yeah, notepad dot exe is.

444
00:30:27,801 --> 00:30:29,889
Scott: There's a lot of notepad clones out there.

445
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,057
Rym: Yes there every program like that is the same.

446
00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:35,640
Scott: Yeah I mean it works like a word processor.

447
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:39,020
Scott: So if you're used to using a word processor, you're used to using notepad.

448
00:30:39,482 --> 00:30:40,990
Scott: It just doesn't let you do anything.

449
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,780
Scott: that is text files can't do.

450
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:43,886
Rym: Yeah, I mean you think about.

451
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:48,100
Rym: you can set word wrap in the text editor But that doesn't actually do anything to your document.

452
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:55,360
Scott: All that does is wrap the text around in your window in real time So that you can see all the letters without them going off the edge.

453
00:30:55,463 --> 00:31:02,280
Rym: Yeah Because anything other than the letters you're typing and the punctuation you're typing all of that is basically metadata.

454
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,494
Rym: That's kind of irrelevant to the actual data you're putting in the actual content of the words.

455
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:08,136
Scott: Yep.

456
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:09,740
Scott: Yeah, so there's notepad.

457
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:12,699
Scott: Nope, there's a lot of other notepad clones out there too.

458
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:28,031
Rym: now the reason this matters in one big respect aside from you know semantics and aside from not distracting yourself from your task at hand is very simply that if you're writing a dot like a File that a computer is going to read a text file is just that.

459
00:31:28,412 --> 00:31:36,334
Rym: what you are typing is exactly what is in that text file Encoded but in something like I don't know write dot exe or Microsoft Word or open office.

460
00:31:36,374 --> 00:31:47,100
Rym: if you're typing and you save a file It doesn't just save the string of text It saves all of this other information in that file saying, you know, all the formatting all the fonts all the whatever.

461
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:54,364
Rym: So if a computer tries to read that it has to know exactly how that file was created in order to get the data out of it.

462
00:31:55,402 --> 00:31:56,326
Rym: This is a problem.

463
00:31:56,647 --> 00:32:12,415
Scott: if you want to edit say your operating systems hosts dot text And you use Microsoft Office Yeah, I mean technically Microsoft Word can edit and create text files and things But it does them like a word processor.

464
00:32:12,435 --> 00:32:13,299
Scott: It doesn't do them.

465
00:32:13,561 --> 00:32:17,200
Rym: It's very easy to mess up a text document and make it not just a text.

466
00:32:18,024 --> 00:32:24,513
Scott: Just opening it and then saving it again with Word will probably screw it up Depending on older versions of Word are more notorious for that.

467
00:32:24,673 --> 00:32:24,914
Rym: Yeah.

468
00:32:25,115 --> 00:32:25,316
Scott: Yeah.

469
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:26,160
Scott: All right.

470
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:32,380
Scott: So what other kind could there possibly be another text editor that isn't notepad or doesn't work exactly like notepad?

471
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:35,094
Scott: Why would you use something that doesn't work like notepad?

472
00:32:35,134 --> 00:32:36,240
Scott: notepad is just fine.

473
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:39,068
Scott: Well, there are two major other ones.

474
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:45,229
Scott: There is the Emacs ones and the VI ones mostly vim vi Improved which is vim.

475
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:47,759
Rym: Yeah, but most people just refer to all of those just VI.

476
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:51,271
Rym: Yes, the differences are not noticeable to the average person.

477
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:53,780
Rym: No, they're not even noticeable really to me.

478
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:58,158
Scott: I noticed there's a VI in vim, but I would never use VI.

479
00:32:58,178 --> 00:32:58,640
Scott: so it doesn't matter.

480
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,394
Rym: Yeah, I use VI once when I was fixing on some terrible old Unix system.

481
00:33:03,675 --> 00:33:05,240
Scott: Yeah, so what is Emacs?

482
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,580
Scott: Well Emacs does kind of work like notepad, you know it's.

483
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:18,876
Scott: you type things in a box and you push enter and you a normal person could open Emacs and start typing in it, however Emacs they often joke about it.

484
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:23,380
Scott: It's like It's a great operating system with a bad text editor.

485
00:33:25,242 --> 00:33:35,308
Scott: I mean Emacs is so is full of all sorts of commands and it it's basically so loaded with fancy features for Open-source people and such that it could do anything.

486
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:37,615
Scott: You can play Tetris in Emacs.

487
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:38,438
Scott: I kid you not.

488
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:47,140
Rym: Yes I was I will say from my perspective Unless you if you were the kind of person who would need Emacs you probably already know about Emacs.

489
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:51,899
Rym: Yeah, if you don't know what we're talking about, you probably don't need Emacs ever.

490
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:58,000
Scott: Emacs is very popular among those people that we often don't like who are like super open-source.

491
00:33:58,642 --> 00:34:03,097
Scott: It's also popular among the people who are open-source and don't like VI.

492
00:34:03,297 --> 00:34:07,395
Rym: Yep Yeah, it is not popular among Rym.

493
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:12,076
Scott: Yes I used to use it, but I know you used to use it.

494
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:12,900
Scott: I don't use it anymore.

495
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,225
Rym: I used to poke fun at it.

496
00:34:14,326 --> 00:34:17,760
Scott: Yeah Emacs, you know, I don't know what it is about Emacs.

497
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:23,219
Scott: It seems like it has its place and it is an eternal battle between Emacs users and VI users.

498
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:40,089
Scott: you know that I remember a funny comic where there were like Two guys on the beach and there was you know, it was the classic, you know surf dudes you have big muscles and you know hot girls and bikinis on the beach and It's a two-frame comic and there's even a one-frame comic I don't remember.

499
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:46,920
Scott: but one guy Punches the other guy right in the face and he says take that you Emacs user and the hot girl on the beach goes.

500
00:34:47,623 --> 00:34:49,958
Scott: John I always knew you were real VI man.

501
00:34:52,741 --> 00:34:53,664
Rym: But anyway, we don't really.

502
00:34:53,684 --> 00:34:57,696
Rym: I mean VI for most of you is the same kind of things.

503
00:34:57,736 --> 00:35:01,639
Rym: you look at it and think wow This has got a lot of stuff in it that I don't understand.

504
00:35:02,322 --> 00:35:10,663
Scott: Well, the thing about VI is it is fundamentally different from every other text editor that I know of in Every way imaginable.

505
00:35:10,784 --> 00:35:16,580
Scott: if a normal person opened up VI they wouldn't even know how to begin typing because let alone how to turn it.

506
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:19,571
Scott: Yeah, you they wouldn't know how to save and quit.

507
00:35:19,832 --> 00:35:21,600
Scott: You wouldn't know how to do anything.

508
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:27,060
Rym: Yeah I mean just in examples you realize here say you want to type something you hit I and then you start typing.

509
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,164
Rym: Say you want it.

510
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:29,930
Scott: also hit a row or capital.

511
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,720
Rym: O now say any other letters, but those all do slightly different things.

512
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,611
Scott: They do they do.

513
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:37,531
Rym: indeed now Let's say you want to save your file and exit you hit escape.

514
00:35:37,952 --> 00:35:58,820
Rym: you hit shift colon then you type Wq, then you hit enter Yeah, that will write your file out W and then quit Q. Yeah, now that might sound obtuse but it's actually a very Highly useful and highly sophisticated system if you're willing to put forth the time to learn it.

515
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,606
Scott: Yes, VI is what we call a modal editor Which means it has more than one mode.

516
00:36:05,127 --> 00:36:08,195
Scott: by when you open VI it's in command mode.

517
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:13,710
Scott: when you're in command mode Every button on the entire keyboard is a command.

518
00:36:14,191 --> 00:36:17,420
Scott: so I isn't the letter I it's the insert command.

519
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:20,689
Scott: You know P will be the paste command.

520
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,400
Scott: X is delete the current character and I shouldn't talk so much.

521
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,491
Rym: I actually haven't used VI since I left IBM.

522
00:36:26,511 --> 00:36:27,094
Scott: Yeah, why?

523
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:28,320
Scott: why is copy?

524
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:29,542
Scott: Why?

525
00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:32,492
Scott: 5y is copy five lines, you know.

526
00:36:32,553 --> 00:36:34,600
Scott: and DD is delete the current line.

527
00:36:35,021 --> 00:36:35,703
Scott: There's all like.

528
00:36:35,743 --> 00:36:38,472
Scott: d5d is delete from here five lines down.

529
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:43,890
Scott: and that's when you type commands in command mode Which is the mode you enter when you first turn on VI.

530
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:46,380
Rym: now the commands can get incredibly complex.

531
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:51,900
Rym: I mean you can use expressions to do such things as find every instance of a certain expression and modify it slightly.

532
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:57,378
Scott: Yeah there you can do almost anything in command mode of VI that you would ever want to do to a text file.

533
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:06,700
Scott: now Certain commands will bring you into Insert mode or typing mode or whatever you want to call it, which is where you type.

534
00:37:07,283 --> 00:37:19,700
Scott: So if you push I to insert then wherever the cursor is right now It'll turn into a little stick and you could just start typing now But typing your document and now you want to enter a command so you have to go back to command mode.

535
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:20,764
Scott: So you push escape.

536
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:23,195
Scott: you see how there's two modes of VI.

537
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:34,938
Scott: in one mode Every button on the entire keyboard is a special command and in the other mode You just type like you're typing and you push escape and then a bunch of commands.

538
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:35,560
Scott: all you know.

539
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:40,480
Scott: Escape will get you back to command mode and there are a bunch of commands that will bring you back to typing mode.

540
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,058
Scott: Now who in their right mind would use something like this when you could just use notepad which is so much easier?

541
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:49,600
Scott: now It might seem I want to get this.

542
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,489
Scott: I want to make sure everyone understands what I'm about to say.

543
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:53,620
Rym: Complexity and simple versus that whole thing.

544
00:37:53,962 --> 00:37:57,122
Scott: I want to talk about how VI is actually Easier.

545
00:37:57,605 --> 00:37:59,899
Scott: as long as you interpret easy in the correct way.

546
00:38:00,522 --> 00:38:03,555
Scott: VI is not easier to learn than notepad.

547
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:08,370
Scott: VI is Easier to use than notepad if you have learned it.

548
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:12,320
Scott: Let's say you know nothing about VI at all.

549
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,539
Scott: Well notepad you'll be able to type and VI you won't so you'll want to kill yourself if you ever have to use VI.

550
00:38:18,282 --> 00:38:22,100
Scott: Now let's say you do know how to use VI and you do know how to use notepad.

551
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:36,607
Scott: Notepad is now a nightmare because there are things in VI which you would be able to do With like pushing three buttons whereas in notepad you would have to like press a bajillion buttons And it would take you forever.

552
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:38,297
Rym: Yep, and some things you might want to do.

553
00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:41,480
Rym: a notepad There's just no way to do it automatically.

554
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:44,480
Rym: You would have to you know, like copy and paste and copy and paste and copy.

555
00:38:45,302 --> 00:38:59,718
Scott: Have you ever been editing a document ever where you have had to go copy paste copy paste copy paste like a bunch of times And then edit each different like Pasting like a little bit like you paste change a number paste change a number in that one paste change a number.

556
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,316
Scott: if you ever Done anything like that?

557
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:09,718
Scott: Guess what if you knew how to use VI You could have done all that and saved an hour of work by typing one line of text and pushing enter.

558
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,080
Rym: now This might not be something you'd care about.

559
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:22,057
Rym: I mean Let's say you occasionally have to do this for like five little things like you have to do a weird copy paste backspace 12345 thing five times on a document every now and then.

560
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:25,018
Rym: then yeah It's still probably not worth your time to learn VI and use it.

561
00:39:25,521 --> 00:39:33,038
Rym: But let's say you have to do that to a thousand page document or you have to do it to a five page document every day for an hour.

562
00:39:33,962 --> 00:39:35,687
Rym: That's when VI really starts to shine.

563
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:40,020
Rym: you can do extremely powerful things with just a few quick commands.

564
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:43,512
Scott: Here's an example of something I did with VI just yesterday.

565
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:47,420
Scott: actually you said also, but that's not the point I was making a metador.

566
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:54,360
Scott: I was working on the DVD for the podcast and there's gonna be a little website on the DVD to let you browse the DVD.

567
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:55,525
Rym: Yeah, it's really cool-looking.

568
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:58,719
Scott: Yeah, and I had to make links to all the episodes.

569
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:03,777
Scott: now I made links to all the episodes by writing a little program that outputted the.

570
00:40:03,897 --> 00:40:04,680
Scott: you know the links now.

571
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:07,659
Scott: I forgot that the episodes are numbered.

572
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,369
Scott: 2-0-0 Number number number number number there.

573
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:15,145
Rym: Yep, so he'd put them in as all Number number number number number number.

574
00:40:15,185 --> 00:40:20,640
Rym: the 2-0 in the year 2-0-0-7 was left out of the version he was working.

575
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,308
Scott: Yeah, so for example at what's today's episode?

576
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:25,374
Scott: today's episode is oh six.

577
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:26,517
Rym: Oh seven.

578
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,183
Rym: All right Oh 7-0-1-2-2.

579
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:29,289
Scott: All right.

580
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:30,495
Scott: So today's episode is oh 7-0-1-2-2.

581
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:34,111
Scott: I hit and the mp3.

582
00:40:34,191 --> 00:40:44,739
Scott: the file name of the mp3 will be 2007. oh 7-0-1-2-2. so I in VI I needed to add a 20 to the beginning of every file name of an mp3.

583
00:40:45,642 --> 00:40:56,105
Scott: So I told VI hey VI look through and every time you see six digits followed by a dot followed by mp3 take whatever that is.

584
00:40:56,185 --> 00:40:58,733
Scott: take those six digits that dot in that mp3 and put a 20 before them.

585
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:05,200
Scott: and That was I don't know like a very very small command.

586
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:15,956
Scott: It wasn't even like a line as maybe 20 characters and I typed it in and I pushed enter and it went through Not just my document, but all the documents that I had to change this in.

587
00:41:16,037 --> 00:41:21,039
Scott: and boom immediately They were all changed and fixed the end because I took the time to learn VI.

588
00:41:22,003 --> 00:41:25,506
Scott: Now we're gonna tell we're not just talking about VI We're gonna talk about text editors as a whole.

589
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:29,480
Rym: but so then the real question is very simply why would you even want to bother?

590
00:41:30,182 --> 00:41:42,020
Rym: Writing flat text files like this ever when you could just do all the layout and everything at once and We'll ignore the argument of you're not distracted by the layout because some people might not be distracted by the layout stuff in Word.

591
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:43,526
Rym: Well, we have.

592
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:45,157
Rym: we have many more arguments than just that.

593
00:41:45,399 --> 00:41:49,019
Scott: Yes There are many times where text editing is the only way to go.

594
00:41:49,645 --> 00:41:56,339
Scott: most of them involve When you're writing something that a computer is going to read and not something that a human is going to read like I think.

595
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:58,647
Rym: earlier I mentioned that ice WM.

596
00:41:58,968 --> 00:42:02,100
Rym: you can modify it very heavily with just editing text files.

597
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:07,964
Rym: The way ice WM works is when widgets get loaded or whatever, you know A thing appears on the screen.

598
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:13,020
Rym: all the instructions as to how those things appear on the screen are contained in text files.

599
00:42:13,482 --> 00:42:20,710
Rym: so you can go into a text file that would define what icons are used on your start menu and Change the values in the text file.

600
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:31,880
Rym: and then when you restart ice WM It'll change those things in your thing because it'll look at the text file see icon dots as whatever And it'll use that instead of the one he was doing before.

601
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:39,122
Scott: Yeah, I mean it mostly in Linux but also in other operating systems including Windows, you know You're used.

602
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:50,897
Scott: you're probably used to using programs with graphical user interfaces where when you want to change the options you go edit preferences or tools options and there's all your options and you check boxes and radio buttons and text boxes.

603
00:42:51,218 --> 00:42:54,873
Scott: and that's how you Configure your programs and change the settings on various things.

604
00:42:54,893 --> 00:42:56,520
Scott: you go to your control panel or whatever.

605
00:42:57,262 --> 00:43:07,270
Scott: Well, a lot of programs out there in fact, probably most programs out there if they have options at all Those options are just in text files like Apache.

606
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,900
Scott: if you want to change the web server, you know, there's no GUI.

607
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:19,960
Scott: I mean, there's some GUIs you can install that will basically allow you to you know Change the settings on Apache with you know, some buttons and some text boxes.

608
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:38,518
Scott: But all those really do is they're just programs which convert the GUI things that you do Into the text file and if you really want to do whatever Apache wants you to do and configure it properly You need to open the Apache configuration files with a text editor and edit them.

609
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,709
Rym: now There are a lot of reasons programs do this.

610
00:43:40,769 --> 00:43:41,131
Rym: I mean one.

611
00:43:41,171 --> 00:43:44,363
Rym: a text file is very easily read Very easy.

612
00:43:44,383 --> 00:43:45,247
Rym: It's a very simple thing.

613
00:43:45,287 --> 00:43:46,673
Rym: It's a commonly known standard.

614
00:43:46,873 --> 00:43:48,460
Rym: Anyone can edit one without any trouble.

615
00:43:49,102 --> 00:43:53,340
Rym: To say it's a program that has thousands and thousands of possible options.

616
00:43:53,861 --> 00:43:59,460
Rym: Your GUI would now have thousands and thousands of little lines with little radio boxes next to them.

617
00:44:00,022 --> 00:44:05,806
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you really think about all the possible Configurations of an Apache web server.

618
00:44:05,866 --> 00:44:06,748
Scott: It's basically infinity.

619
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:12,759
Scott: You can configure the thing to do anything and as a complex language That's in order to configure it.

620
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:21,977
Scott: You know, you have little curly braces and there's all sorts of different commands you can give to it and stuff You could configure it to just provide a Java Tetris game no matter what.

621
00:44:22,419 --> 00:44:23,463
Rym: Yeah Nothing else.

622
00:44:23,523 --> 00:44:32,151
Scott: you could configure the Apache web server in so many different ways and that is because instead of having some simple GUI Preferences window they have a text file.

623
00:44:32,352 --> 00:44:37,380
Scott: you edit the text file and that's it And you could put anything you want in there according to the documentation.

624
00:44:38,181 --> 00:44:41,839
Scott: That's something actually a lot of people who are new to Linux ever don't understand.

625
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:45,080
Scott: is Yeah, if you want to configure that you have to edit a text file.

626
00:44:45,641 --> 00:45:03,686
Rym: I mean even back in RIT when I was taking early IT classes and there would be people in a class who the lab would say like Build a simple Samba server and then go to the config and configure it to do X. now Not only did they not know to look in ETC Samba Which might have been the first problem.

627
00:45:03,887 --> 00:45:07,740
Rym: Yeah, but they were asking questions like so, where's the configuration program?

628
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,254
Rym: Or how do I open the configurator or the?

629
00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:11,220
Rym: how do I open the thing?

630
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,455
Rym: That'll configure it and the professor's really had a hard time explaining.

631
00:45:14,495 --> 00:45:16,478
Rym: No, you just edit it Like what do you mean edit it?

632
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:23,320
Scott: There's a text file with all the options in it and it actually in that text file has comments which explain the options.

633
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:37,071
Rym: Yeah, I mean most open source programs that are worth a hill of beans will give you a sample configuration file that includes in it like commented out instructions like if you want this kind of widget then uncomment the following line.

634
00:45:37,372 --> 00:45:43,158
Rym: if you want this kind of widget uncomment the following line and Change your value here to the value you want things like that.

635
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,028
Rym: They're usually very easy to work with.

636
00:45:45,049 --> 00:45:50,840
Rym: the problem is you have to actually read Which a lot of people either aren't willing to do or don't realize they have to do.

637
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:58,886
Scott: Yeah if you're planning on using Linux even if you're using a nice easy Linux like Ubuntu or something and you're never gonna have to Edit a configuration file in your life.

638
00:45:59,247 --> 00:46:07,000
Scott: You should still learn how to edit the X dot X or configuration file Even if you never have to do it because eventually you're gonna have to do it.

639
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:11,080
Scott: You might have to do it and if you don't it could be devastating if you don't know what to do.

640
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,862
Scott: So you should learn that no matter what even if you never run into it You'll it'll be.

641
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:18,920
Scott: it's worth it to know and also just to learn how to edit configuration files.

642
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:21,329
Scott: The other time you probably want to use text editor.

643
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:24,140
Scott: besides editing configuration files is writing source code.

644
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:31,573
Scott: I mean, you don't see people writing programs, you know, if I'm writing code in C I'm not writing C code in Microsoft Word.

645
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:32,600
Scott: that doesn't work.

646
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,144
Scott: You write it in a text editor.

647
00:46:34,806 --> 00:46:41,303
Scott: and if that text editor has lots of advanced features like VI or an editor emac or like Ultra edit.

648
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:44,291
Scott: Yeah, all those things or any of those fancy text editors.

649
00:46:44,692 --> 00:46:47,300
Scott: It suddenly becomes a lot easier to write source code.

650
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:48,700
Rym: Yeah, I mean imagine you're writing code.

651
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,699
Rym: So you you know, you have open parens all over the place, you know open parentheses and open carrots things like that.

652
00:46:54,382 --> 00:47:03,380
Rym: what if you had a text editor that would look and see if Every open you had had an equivalent closed and it would mark in red any that weren't closed.

653
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,651
Rym: It'd be real easy to track down that missing semicolon then.

654
00:47:06,671 --> 00:47:10,182
Scott: Yeah, it's like and when I type a closed parenthesis There's a little.

655
00:47:10,223 --> 00:47:15,900
Scott: it lights up the parenthesis the open parenthesis that I just closed so I can make sure that I'm still going straight.

656
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:18,691
Scott: Also a lot of languages have you know.

657
00:47:18,772 --> 00:47:19,394
Scott: indentation.

658
00:47:19,414 --> 00:47:30,320
Scott: that's important like Python Where indentation is the most important thing and if the text editor is smart and not crappy as notepad It'll keep that indentation correct for you automatically.

659
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,421
Scott: You won't have to be like enter tab tab tab enter tab tab tab, you know it'll.

660
00:47:34,441 --> 00:47:45,130
Scott: just when you push enter that's in the tabs in the right spot and languages that indent based on curly brace like you'll put the closed curly brace and it'll Untab it for you and put it back where it belongs.

661
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:49,039
Scott: and when you push enter you'll be on the next line in the correct Spot and it's all happy times.

662
00:47:49,441 --> 00:47:50,484
Rym: so the very least I hope.

663
00:47:50,845 --> 00:48:00,080
Rym: in the future if you're ever writing a document and you're using Microsoft Word at least think a minute and Consider the possibility that maybe there's a better tool for what you're trying to do at the moment.

664
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:15,260
Scott: yeah, also if you're happen to be learning Linux or anything or you know using any sort of application that might have a text Configuration file or maybe you just want to learn something about computers because you don't know anything You should learn how to edit a text configuration file.

665
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:23,253
Scott: Yeah for some sort of programming in every program the configuration files look different But that's an essential skill of computing and it probably always will be.

666
00:48:24,436 --> 00:48:31,860
Scott: Oh You should learn VI even if it's hard and it seems annoying and there's no point to it Even if you don't learn the advanced stuff.

667
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,018
Rym: I mean even people who use VI all the time don't know everything about VI.

668
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:45,780
Rym: I know like half the stuff about VI but in the very least Partly because you might someday run into an old computer or a computer where X isn't working and VI is the only thing on there.

669
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:51,980
Scott: Yeah, that's one thing that's true is VI will run on any computer ever pretty much, you know.

670
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:58,323
Scott: Even if you come across the oldest most broken computer in the entire universe You'll be able to use VI.

671
00:48:58,363 --> 00:49:00,166
Scott: and if you can use VI you can do anything.

672
00:49:07,497 --> 00:49:09,600
Rym: and that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

673
00:49:09,861 --> 00:49:12,291
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for our opening theme.

674
00:49:12,693 --> 00:49:17,107
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

675
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:20,217
Scott: if you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums.

676
00:49:20,297 --> 00:49:21,019
Scott: Make sure you visit them.

677
00:49:21,582 --> 00:49:27,668
Scott: You can send your email feedback to GeekNights at gmail.com And if you want you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

678
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:35,140
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight Monday through Thursday.

679
00:49:35,802 --> 00:49:41,316
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience, but unlike those other talk shows.

680
00:49:41,697 --> 00:49:42,940
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
