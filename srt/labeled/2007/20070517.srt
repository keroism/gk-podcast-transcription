00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,550
Rym: It's Thursday, May 17th.

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,860
Rym: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:16,683
Rym: Tonight.

4
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:20,320
Rym: we make fun of those crackpots with their crazy conspiracy theories.

5
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:23,237
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:29,794
Rym: So uh somewhat unexpectedly I had a brush with death today at work.

7
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:31,419
Scott: a brush with death you say.

8
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,305
Scott: was it another Exploding power supply?

9
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:37,480
Rym: no it was an actual brush with death as opposed to a hilarious brush with death.

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,077
Scott: Well my day would have been quite interesting if you had died rather than just brushed it.

11
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:46,095
Rym: yes luckily I grabbed it with two fingers instead of my whole hand and thus.

12
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:47,100
Rym: I was spared death.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,885
Scott: It was electricity then was so.

14
00:00:48,925 --> 00:01:00,562
Rym: you see I was going down into the basement of this building and in the basement is a big gigantic metal rack cabinet with doors on it and inside of that is a rack and connotation.

15
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:16,560
Rym: the rack are a whole bunch of switches and routers networking equipment and no one is open this rack or Bothered with it for many many months because it works just fine and in fact I was only going down there to count how many PCs were plugged into it And how many things were patched down and that sort of thing for a future upgrade?

16
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:26,011
Rym: So I go down there and I open the door and I look in and I reach over and I grab the handle to this Cabinet to open it and suddenly I feel like the room is shaking.

17
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:28,700
Rym: and then I realized that no my hand is shaking.

18
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:31,332
Rym: And then I realized that no my hand is not shaking.

19
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:38,440
Rym: I am just being filled with 120 volts Awesome and with a bit of effort I pull myself away.

20
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,087
Scott: Yeah, I wonder what does that?

21
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:48,420
Scott: because like one time I was holding a light switch You know in the wall And it kind of the electricity went in one finger and out the other back into the wall.

22
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,476
Scott: It was sort of like a loop between my thumb and forefinger, and it's like hard to let go.

23
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:53,400
Scott: it's sort of like magnets.

24
00:01:53,561 --> 00:02:01,482
Rym: Actually, that's the reason that generally when you're working with electricity 120 volts is a lot more dangerous than 220.

25
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:10,134
Rym: Because with 110 120 when when the voltage goes through you it Tends to cause your muscles to tense up and keep hold of whatever you're holding on to.

26
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:11,439
Scott: oh, that's how it works.

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,924
Rym: Yep, but 220.

28
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,673
Rym: It's so much power right away that more likely.

29
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,579
Rym: It's gonna spark and throw you away from it.

30
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,820
Rym: In fact my grandpa almost died when he was a kid.

31
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:21,544
Rym: He was.

32
00:02:21,946 --> 00:02:33,100
Rym: he didn't realize there was a big rope hanging from a tree But it was actually a downed power line, and he went to go Tarzan on it And instead he just hung there dying of like well almost being electrocuted.

33
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:41,340
Rym: but eventually his dad like came out by eventually I mean Almost right away and hit him in the stomach with a log or a brick or something to knock him off of the thing.

34
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:49,235
Rym: I'm glad we're not using DC Well anyway, so uh, but I pull myself off of it, and I fall to the ground.

35
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:56,438
Rym: I'm sitting there going what the fuck God damn it son of a bitch, and someone comes in.

36
00:02:56,478 --> 00:02:59,689
Rym: they're like Something going on, and I'm like fucking shit.

37
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,980
Rym: call facilities, and don't go into this room.

38
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:09,414
Rym: So I call the engineers and they come in and I'm like yes, there's a voltage leak somewhere.

39
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:11,640
Rym: this entire cabinet is electrified.

40
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:25,695
Rym: Meanwhile I point out that all the equipment inside of it's working just fine Awesome, so the guy looks at me and says yeah, you sure it isn't some static or something, and I'm like Touch it why don't you just touch it?

41
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:26,360
Scott: so he pulls out?

42
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,014
Rym: He's got one of those little testers And he touches it to it, and he's laughing.

43
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:33,832
Rym: and then the light goes bright red And he goes beep and he pulls it away and backs.

44
00:03:33,852 --> 00:03:38,738
Rym: He'd like backs a step up and goes oh Don't let anyone go in there.

45
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,423
Scott: God people.

46
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:48,268
Rym: so then I take care of all this because I don't know what the procedure is for dealing with deadly voltage Filling and I know the procedure.

47
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:49,010
Scott: Oh, no.

48
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:50,595
Rym: I know my personal procedure.

49
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:51,077
Scott: What's your?

50
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,080
Scott: what's your personal procedure?

51
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,706
Scott: Let's see if yours is similar to mine.

52
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:54,048
Rym: All right.

53
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:57,179
Rym: Well first was don't fucking touch anything else.

54
00:03:57,601 --> 00:03:59,631
Scott: Ah, that's that worth the similar ones.

55
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,038
Rym: number two back out of the room.

56
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:03,917
Rym: Yeah Call whatever electrical people.

57
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:05,134
Rym: yeah make sure no one goes in.

58
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:05,540
Rym: yeah.

59
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:14,540
Rym: And then I went back into the room and looked around to see if I could identify What was going on and see if I could just pull the plug outside of this thing?

60
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,581
Rym: That's plugging the whole thing into the wall and then back away Mm-hmm.

61
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:23,900
Rym: and I didn't because I didn't know what the procedure is for taking down an entire building's network infrastructure.

62
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,500
Rym: Yeah, it's out of the blue especially since it was technically all up and working.

63
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:33,354
Rym: Yeah Worse the voltage leak was coming from a faulty PDU stuck on the inside of it.

64
00:04:33,796 --> 00:04:40,389
Rym: that PDU was connected to the UPS uh-oh and the whole thing wasn't grounded for some reason.

65
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,845
Rym: so I filled out the OSHA forms and I Did the whole deal.

66
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:46,890
Rym: they sent me to the doctor.

67
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,975
Rym: The doctor looked at me.

68
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:49,160
Scott: Well, you're in a hospital, right?

69
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,570
Rym: So yeah, so I just walked over to the actual hospital out of the office and I was like, yeah I just got shocked pretty bad.

70
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,675
Scott: So the doctor it goes.

71
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:59,911
Scott: All right, let's look at this You're living you're good.

72
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:00,900
Rym: Yeah, well they checked me out.

73
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,033
Rym: Actually, they did a bunch of tests to see if my hand had all the strength.

74
00:05:04,113 --> 00:05:13,952
Scott: cuz I pointed out that the voltage just went Through my middle finger my ring finger that that puts me a little tangent here, but I realized why People going to the emergency room cost hospitals so much money.

75
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:24,746
Scott: Oh, uh, I can tell you in great detail It's like I didn't realize quite you know this that Hospitals lose all their money because if you show up to the emergency room whether you have insurance or not They'll do something for you.

76
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,073
Rym: Well, they have to do something.

77
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:26,777
Rym: You don't want to.

78
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:32,038
Scott: sometimes Yes and even if you go in with like a cold they have to do something because you went to the emergency.

79
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:32,218
Scott: and

80
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:45,940
Rym: I read a Study recently that I don't know which hospital it was for because I just read it briefly But one hospital did a study and determined that Fewer than 1/4 of any of the people who come into emergency room had anything even remotely close to an emergency.

81
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,378
Scott: Yeah, they really should be allowed to just say no you're not an emergency go away, but they can't.

82
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,040
Rym: no You know what?

83
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:58,400
Rym: They do usually if you ever go to an emergency room and you have to wait four hours to get treated That means that you're one of those assholes and it wasn't an emergency.

84
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:01,418
Rym: Yeah, because what they do is they make you wait hoping you'll just go away.

85
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:14,000
Scott: Yep But anyway, when you go to emergency room, they even no matter what it's for Even if you have a cold they will run basically all sorts of crazy tests to make sure because you came to the emergency room.

86
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,917
Scott: So they're assuming that if you came here, there's something seriously

87
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:31,900
Rym: wrong with you The term is triage and what that means is that they'll take you in and they'll determine if you're an imminent danger of death or Permanent disability or a serious turn for the worse or any anything that's dangerous to your eyes.

88
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:36,600
Rym: And actually that the basic tests are very simple and don't cost anything.

89
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:43,620
Scott: But then when they actually get around to taking care of you, even if you have to wait four hours They will run tests on you that are expensive and time-consuming.

90
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:51,124
Rym: Actually, not always the only read the only test they did ran on me was an EKG and the only reason they did that Was as a precaution.

91
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,371
Rym: they didn't do anything else other than you know blood pressure.

92
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:57,123
Scott: Yeah, but that's because you went in with electricity Cutioning.

93
00:06:57,325 --> 00:06:58,719
Scott: Yeah, that's what they check you with now.

94
00:06:59,422 --> 00:07:05,100
Rym: They didn't see something in my EEG where she looked at it for a while and then she said I'm gonna get a second opinion.

95
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:05,931
Rym: We'll call you back.

96
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:12,720
Rym: Uh-huh I don't know what that's all about But the interesting part of this story not that I had a brush with death because I don't care about that.

97
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:17,184
Rym: But I need to take a moment to preen in front of the crowds the audience of GeekNights Mm-hmm.

98
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:21,486
Rym: because so she's checking, you know My pulse and everything and my blood pressure.

99
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:31,375
Rym: and while she's checking my pulse the first time she stops shakes her head drives it again She has my other arm and then she pauses and says are you an athlete?

100
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:34,987
Rym: Yeah, and I said Not really.

101
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,920
Rym: She's like, well, do you run her a lot or anything?

102
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,399
Rym: I'm like, yeah, and she says your heart rate's super low.

103
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:44,800
Rym: That means you're either a professional athlete or you have a serious problem.

104
00:07:46,102 --> 00:07:55,597
Rym: The second one actually no because all the rest of the test and at the end of the exam I was told by the doctor that I am perhaps the optimal picture of health for a 25 year old man.

105
00:07:57,422 --> 00:08:02,008
Scott: Sure with your and your oh You mean my allergies?

106
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,440
Scott: Yeah, that's not the optimal picture of hell.

107
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,974
Rym: Well in terms of I guess cardio health or muscles or heart or anything like that.

108
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:10,258
Rym: I'm in perfect frickin hell.

109
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:16,034
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure Alright, so news is outside of Rym getting electrocuted.

110
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:16,335
Rym: Yeah.

111
00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:17,739
Rym: Well, no, I didn't get electrocuted.

112
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:23,919
Rym: Yeah, because electrocution means very specifically electricity applied on to death.

113
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:27,129
Rym: Uh-huh, you cannot say you were electrocute.

114
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,236
Rym: electrocuted because if you say that you're dead and you couldn't have said it I guess electroshocked.

115
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:36,371
Rym: No, because electroshock is part of electroconvulsive therapy.

116
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:38,880
Scott: Well, I didn't say like trust you received electroshock therapy.

117
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,366
Scott: I just said you were electroshocked.

118
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:42,860
Rym: I don't know if the term applies terribly.

119
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:45,180
Rym: Well, though I do realize now there is a loophole.

120
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:56,339
Rym: Uh-huh, if let's say you were shocked and your heart stopped and then someone revived you I'll bet you could say electrocuted because your heart was stopped by the electricity you were killed and then brought back.

121
00:08:57,302 --> 00:09:01,496
Scott: Who knows I actually read that article recently about how even if your heart stops then we have to.

122
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:02,760
Scott: it's not quite dead anymore.

123
00:09:02,861 --> 00:09:06,139
Rym: They can kind of save you and oh, yeah, there's been a lot of cases of that.

124
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,259
Scott: So we're to gotta like change what me what it means to be dead and stuff like that.

125
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:12,847
Rym: Generally, I'm of the mind that death would be.

126
00:09:13,148 --> 00:09:14,732
Rym: I would go with something with the brain.

127
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:20,936
Rym: when brain activity ceases and the brain starts Deteriorate physically physically until one day we find out how to bring it back.

128
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:21,680
Scott: It's like up.

129
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,529
Scott: There's no activity going on here at all.

130
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:24,474
Scott: Click up.

131
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:24,755
Scott: Wait.

132
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:30,300
Rym: No, there is uh Yep, part of the problem there is if you have organ donation or anything.

133
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,860
Rym: You've got to determine if someone's dead before the organs are all useless.

134
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:39,133
Rym: That's why I don't you can't go thing But you realize that there's no danger of them taking organs out of you.

135
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:40,618
Rym: if there's any chance you're gonna survive.

136
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:44,231
Scott: just in case There's no just in case plus they can take them.

137
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:47,944
Scott: Anyway, even if I don't sign the thing not really And whatever.

138
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:48,567
Rym: no they can't.

139
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:49,872
Rym: so you're just being a dick.

140
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:50,635
Scott: That's fine.

141
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:51,177
Scott: I'll be dead.

142
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:51,780
Scott: What do I care?

143
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,400
Rym: See, it's funny how you've pretty much come all the way around to nihilism in your philosophy over the last several years.

144
00:09:58,641 --> 00:09:59,464
Scott: It changes every day.

145
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,770
Scott: What can I know?

146
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,874
Rym: It's been pretty consistently.

147
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,385
Rym: nihilism for at least the last year I don't know.

148
00:10:04,806 --> 00:10:05,992
Scott: I think it changes all the time.

149
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:12,279
Scott: Yeah, but for the last year nihilism Oh, well, maybe next year will be the year of I don't know something else.

150
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:12,997
Scott: Dadaism.

151
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:16,629
Rym: Anyway, what do you got in the news?

152
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:21,465
Scott: so to get weird and Sort of non-GeekNights here.

153
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:26,400
Scott: I've got a news about sports, but wait, okay, and it's actually a sport.

154
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,454
Scott: I care nothing about basketball.

155
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:31,950
Rym: Ah Granted I kind of like women's college basketball.

156
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,580
Scott: This is the NBA here the worst of all basketball.

157
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:43,980
Scott: I'd rather watch kids in the street playing basketball than the NBA I agree, but something happened interesting here that I think we can bring back to the old game theory type stuff.

158
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:44,665
Scott: And it's pretty.

159
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:45,632
Scott: it's pretty interesting.

160
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:48,245
Scott: So NBA right now.

161
00:10:48,446 --> 00:10:51,877
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's like whoever wins the current series.

162
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:52,760
Scott: go to the finals.

163
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:54,168
Scott: I'm not telling too much.

164
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:56,020
Rym: I have no idea how the NBA works.

165
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:04,219
Scott: There's a playoffs and you do like, you know Three out of five series or four to seven series and then eventually there's a finals Which is a four to seven series never wins that wins.

166
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:07,019
Rym: All I know is the Pistons are doing really well like they always do.

167
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,340
Scott: Yep, so one of the current playoff series going on is these Spurs and the Suns, right?

168
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:16,700
Rym: I can't name either city San Antonio and Phoenix, huh?

169
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,106
Scott: All right, so I can't believe I know all the sports teams, even though I don't give a shit about Either.

170
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:24,413
Rym: I figured you're just looking in the article.

171
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:26,222
Rym: No, I know god I think it is.

172
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:31,200
Rym: I'm a really big fan of hockey and I still don't know a lot of hockey teams that I don't care about.

173
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:33,688
Scott: What's the hockey team in Chicago like?

174
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,817
Rym: if I know Blackhawks cuz I don't care about the Blackhawks.

175
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:37,560
Scott: I know one does.

176
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,370
Scott: Okay, I hope you don't Chicago listeners they suck.

177
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:45,395
Rym: Well, yeah the Blackhawks like I like Chicago.

178
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:51,333
Scott: Yeah, it's okay Chicago last never ever not once.

179
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:54,265
Rym: I've actually been in Chicago a whole bunch of times All right.

180
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:55,919
Scott: So let me get to this story.

181
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:57,628
Rym: No, I'm just gonna keep keep.

182
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:00,000
Rym: we're gonna stay off-topic all night in this series.

183
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:06,968
Scott: right the first game some guy got injured and he was on it and they couldn't heal him quick enough to get him back in The game and that cost him the game.

184
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:13,179
Scott: right in the most recent game There was some sort of altercation going on Right, uh-huh.

185
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:20,872
Scott: And the NBA rule says that if you get off the bench to go run to the altercation Then you're suspended.

186
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:21,799
Scott: That's what the rule says.

187
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:38,438
Scott: So these two guys who are pretty important players on one of the teams They went down the sideline Right and even though they didn't intend to join in the fight or anything like that They got off the bench and they were away from their bench when there was the fight going on Even if they weren't gonna get in the fight.

188
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:45,780
Scott: But the rule says that they would get suspended and they did so what if you were out taking a leak?

189
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:47,036
Scott: That's yeah.

190
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:58,520
Scott: People are basically up in arms because they consider these two teams to be the best teams this year And even and it's a shame because they're complaining like oh, why didn't they receive these?

191
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,168
Scott: This should be the finals not the semi-finals or whatever.

192
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:01,991
Scott: blah blah blah.

193
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:04,540
Rym: Everyone complains about that every year in every sport.

194
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:21,960
Scott: I know I know but the point is is that now because They they've decided to go by the letter of the law instead of using common sense in applying the rules They basically ruined the whole NBA playoffs this year by taking two and very important players off one of the best teams.

195
00:13:22,341 --> 00:13:27,359
Rym: God, I would get a player to start some shit really close to the other benches and hope that they all stand up.

196
00:13:28,064 --> 00:13:38,980
Scott: actually, oh There I listen to an interview because I listen to PTI every day Which is an ESPN radio whatever and they had the Commission of the NBA on talking about it, right?

197
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,019
Scott: Cuz it was such a big deal.

198
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:47,145
Scott: They interviewed him for like half the show and he was actually like yeah We had rules like this because You know one.

199
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:55,230
Scott: we assumed that at some point someone would get some chump players who were crap to start fights with star players and get them all suspended.

200
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:59,699
Scott: and they wouldn't care because it was some chump got suspended and some Star player got suspended.

201
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,456
Scott: That's why they have rules like this.

202
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,696
Scott: Meanwhile the rule made bad things happen and went against what they were trying to prevent.

203
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:09,960
Scott: it makes no sense.

204
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,640
Rym: Oh, well, I find it kind of hilarious.

205
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:27,028
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty hilarious but you think about it when German board games part of the reason they're so great is because There's never an instance where following the letter of the rules of the game Goes against what's common sense

206
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:28,976
Rym: except in really bad game,

207
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:30,000
Scott: but that's a bad game.

208
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,831
Scott: But yeah, my point is

209
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,200
Rym: hell is hell is yes

210
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:44,133
Scott: But this is a way that you can tell a good game Apart from a bad game is that if you follow all the rules of the game to the letter There will never be an instance where you say that's bullshit and then you go.

211
00:14:44,194 --> 00:14:44,294
Scott: No.

212
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:45,158
Scott: Well, there it is.

213
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:46,487
Scott: Yep It'll always be.

214
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:47,980
Scott: oh that makes perfect sense.

215
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,016
Scott: Like how many times do I say we sit around and we're playing a German board game?

216
00:14:52,036 --> 00:15:03,979
Scott: when you argue like well This would make the most sense, you know It wouldn't make sense the other way and 99% of the time pretty much whenever it's a good game Whatever we say would make sense is what the rule ends up saying.

217
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:09,680
Rym: Granted we don't own a lot of crappy games and I'm sure there's some crappy games that have some nonsensical stuff.

218
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,685
Scott: Those are crappy games.

219
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:15,758
Scott: Yeah, so and be assessed my point is basketball is a crappy game.

220
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:31,160
Rym: So this morning just as I was leaving for work I hit the old f5 on slash dot and I saw a story about a judge ruling on a technology case or a case that involved technology.

221
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,516
Rym: It actually was a case about some quote-unquote terrorist inciting something something.

222
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:36,740
Rym: I don't even I didn't pay attention.

223
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,400
Rym: I barely read the article because it doesn't matter.

224
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:51,855
Rym: but apparently the judge didn't know and really had trouble understanding what a website was and I thought Crap, the Internet's gonna explode about this and I'm gonna have to talk about it tonight.

225
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:53,220
Rym: So here I am talking about it.

226
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:55,166
Scott: It's a British judge, by the way.

227
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:57,575
Rym: Yeah, I didn't even read the article.

228
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:58,598
Scott: albionic judge.

229
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,150
Rym: Yeah I don't know what this Britain is you talk about.

230
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,333
Rym: Yeah, I Mean last I heard it was a colony of Rome.

231
00:16:05,353 --> 00:16:21,900
Rym: Oh But now I assume a lot of you out there, you know, oh, yeah Now Rym and Scott are gonna complain about how stupid this judge is and how fucked up the legal system is and about how every Judge should know all about the internet and all about how technology works and be up with the times.

232
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:23,808
Rym: And that's really not what I'm gonna say.

233
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:26,118
Scott: Okay, because we've all said that before.

234
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:34,837
Rym: Yeah Well, I say that about other things but when it comes to a judge Asking them to head now see I'm really divided on this issue and I think I'll get into why I'm divided.

235
00:16:34,937 --> 00:16:43,660
Rym: on one hand asking a judge to only be able to rule or Consider cases where he is fully cognizant of all of the issues involved.

236
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:54,360
Scott: It's a little unrealistic because that means that like some like super surgeon has to be like the judge at some Practice suit and you really want him to be surgery.

237
00:16:55,381 --> 00:17:05,251
Rym: Say there's a case where I don't know a whole bunch of pet food gets poisoned and the witnesses are all in describing What chemical got into the pet food and trying to make the case?

238
00:17:05,752 --> 00:17:07,818
Rym: Well, the judge isn't a biologist.

239
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:08,619
Rym: He's not a chemist.

240
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:11,392
Rym: He doesn't understand exactly what all this is.

241
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:13,300
Rym: you show him the report of toxicology.

242
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,513
Rym: He won't really he won't know any more about it than this judge did about the website.

243
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:19,040
Rym: Yeah, and it'll have to be explained to him.

244
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:26,737
Rym: so Requiring or expecting judges to know everything about technology that they're going after and also about law.

245
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:30,124
Rym: Yes is Really going to.

246
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:35,060
Rym: there's no way we could rule on pretty much any case that would ever involve it science or technology.

247
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:41,220
Scott: It's pretty unrealistic because anyone who has the requisite knowledge to judge properly won't probably won't have the knowledge of the law.

248
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:56,325
Scott: Anyone with knowledge of the law probably won't have knowledge of every single specialized thing out there and We'd really either have a shortage of judges or we'd have a lot of people with valuable skills using them to judge instead of Use the skills themselves.

249
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:59,860
Scott: Like would you rather have a doctor doctoring or a doctor judging some doctors?

250
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,049
Scott: There's not enough doctors to do everything granted.

251
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:11,998
Rym: The other side of this is that in the modern world Basic computer literacy is pretty much tantamount to literacy in total.

252
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:25,599
Scott: at this point Yes, while at least in the industrialized world Yes, while I would not expect, you know a judge to have to be have a degree in computer science Although that would be nice to judge computer cases at least I should expect them to be able to.

253
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:34,979
Scott: you know Use a little Microsoft Word action and browse some websites send some emails send some IMs Know what my space is because it's probably a lot of cases involving that.

254
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:40,055
Scott: Understand, you know p2p and the basics what my mom understands.

255
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:50,420
Rym: see now the thing is Ideally, it shouldn't matter because the way I see it regardless of what the case is The judge is just judging on the facts and the law that sort of thing.

256
00:18:50,520 --> 00:19:01,178
Rym: So whenever there's a case where something that the judge doesn't understand comes up I think it's just the duty of the lawyers and/or their expert witnesses to explain it in suitable enough detail for the judge.

257
00:19:01,218 --> 00:19:05,531
Rym: because alright Let's say we get a judge who understands all these technology issues.

258
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:11,732
Rym: All right, hurrah now he can deal with the case Fully knowing what these expert witnesses are talking about.

259
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:20,640
Rym: I posit to you Scott What are the odds that even one of those jurors has one goddamn clue what they're talking about regardless of what the judge knows?

260
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:30,718
Scott: Not much because if someone like if you if you're a doctor who understands doctoring you're not gonna be a juror on a malpractice case They're not just not gonna let it happen.

261
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:37,540
Rym: well I mean you all remember from my jury Experiences where I was basically told that I am overqualified to be a juror and that I'll never serve on a jury.

262
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,294
Scott: Yes, but pretend it's not even a case with a jury.

263
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:42,844
Scott: It's just a civil case so it's just the judge.

264
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:50,299
Rym: even then the judge should be able to get from the expert witnesses and from the lawyers a Suitable explanation of what is going on?

265
00:19:50,420 --> 00:20:02,185
Scott: So unless that both unless the judge is Unknowledgeable and all the expert witnesses are poor experts and the lawyers found poor expert witnesses because they're not too good at finding them Yeah,

266
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:03,839
Rym: or if the judge is stupid

267
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:04,522
Scott: Yeah

268
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:11,464
Rym: that I mean there is the problem where what if your expert witnesses explain everything in perfect detail and the judge is just too Dense to understand it

269
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:12,588
Scott: shouldn't be a judge.

270
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:17,960
Scott: Yeah, I just to be able to understand any expert witness What was the old quote?

271
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:26,200
Rym: I think it was from Monty Python might have been from somewhere else But it just comes to mind and I think a few people probably Posted it on slash shot and FARC and all the places that talk about this.

272
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:33,100
Rym: But you know, yeah, I wanted to be a judge but the entrance entrance exam was too tough So I decided to become a minor.

273
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,213
Rym: Unfortunately when you're too old and stupid to be a minor you can't be a minor anymore.

274
00:20:37,454 --> 00:20:38,900
Rym: Well, the opposite is true for judging.

275
00:20:44,903 --> 00:20:55,000
Rym: Now I do point out that there is one further possible issue Surrounding this whole thing and that is that the judge might not be as done dance as everyone seems to think.

276
00:20:55,102 --> 00:21:19,309
Rym: I didn't read the article But I know that a lot of times when a concept is brought up in court Like say a website The judge might have said he doesn't know what a website is very clearly in order to force the people involved in the trial to Explain exactly what a website is for the purposes of this case because let me think the term website is kind of broad to me a website is Like a site and a web page is different.

277
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,320
Rym: and what's the boundary between one website and another website?

278
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:24,370
Rym: And is it the data in the database?

279
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:25,275
Rym: Is it the server?

280
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:26,280
Rym: Is it the content?

281
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:27,846
Rym: Yeah, things like that.

282
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:40,974
Rym: and also maybe in case the jury was I don't know Possibly not the brightest bunch of people the judge might have even been doing this solely for the benefit of the jury So they would force the people to explain this for the benefit of them.

283
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:41,878
Scott: That is true.

284
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:46,150
Scott: However You know, there weren't too many people paying attention to this case.

285
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,785
Scott: I imagine I mean, it's not like some high-profile on the TV You know case.

286
00:21:51,306 --> 00:21:57,683
Scott: so the in order for someone to notice this and put it up on the internet to be like Oh my god Can you believe this?

287
00:21:58,165 --> 00:22:02,639
Scott: it probably they probably would have had to been there and experience the dumbness or or?

288
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,881
Rym: They decided to write it up in the way that they did in order to get a bunch of digs or that someone made it Up.

289
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:10,987
Scott: Yeah, not true.

290
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:11,711
Rym: I wouldn't doubt it.

291
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:17,586
Scott: being made up quite frankly Regardless is just yet another tough excuse to talk about judges.

292
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,559
Scott: I choose you ditto.

293
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:30,400
Rym: Oh Anyway things of the day.

294
00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:37,971
Rym: So in keeping with our main bit tonight, I linked to one of those random crazy Conspiracy nutjob videos.

295
00:22:38,493 --> 00:22:49,500
Rym: and while this isn't one of them This is just a straight-up nutjob conspiracy about how Freemasons and Mormons and whatever could secretly control the world from Bavaria or whatever with aliens in the pyramids.

296
00:22:50,126 --> 00:23:06,768
Rym: I don't know how people believe this shit But I discovered when I found this that there is an entire sub-genre on the internet of music videos set to Illuminati Imagery and they seem to all this anything like your famous Born to be alive.

297
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:08,720
Rym: I don't think so.

298
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,172
Rym: I'm pretty sure all of these people are trying to quote-unquote.

299
00:23:12,293 --> 00:23:15,582
Rym: get the word out about the Illuminati Don't?

300
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,653
Scott: they know it's just a game made by Steve Jackson.

301
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:19,019
Rym: I don't think they do.

302
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:21,045
Scott: They not play the game.

303
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:25,140
Rym: I think they think the game is just a joke and the real Illuminati is waiting.

304
00:23:25,764 --> 00:23:27,840
Scott: But but the game the game.

305
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:34,165
Rym: Well, I think the game may or may not have come after the term was calling of course But that's not the point.

306
00:23:34,486 --> 00:23:36,013
Scott: The point is that the Illuminati was real.

307
00:23:36,455 --> 00:23:37,600
Scott: the game wouldn't fly.

308
00:23:38,062 --> 00:23:46,940
Rym: Maybe it would because you see if the Illuminati were real and they didn't let the game fly Then everyone who tried to make the game fly would have known because there would have been some sort of influence.

309
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:57,300
Rym: So instead cleverly the Illuminati acted like it didn't exist in order to let the game come out in order to convince everyone to think That the Illuminati doesn't really exist when in fact it does I'm sure but it doesn't all right.

310
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:07,680
Scott: We have an inside joke in the front row crew because at some point in time, you know I'm a fan of arts, I guess certain arts and I kind of like statues.

311
00:24:08,342 --> 00:24:10,367
Scott: I like to go to museums and look at statues.

312
00:24:10,488 --> 00:24:11,551
Rym: This wasn't an inside joke.

313
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:13,215
Rym: This was just proof that you're homosexual.

314
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:13,536
Scott: Yeah.

315
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:14,058
Scott: Okay, whatever.

316
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:19,111
Scott: so You know at one point in time people were talking about something.

317
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:22,785
Scott: I forget what the discussion was, but I was like, yeah I'd like to have some art in my house.

318
00:24:22,866 --> 00:24:31,140
Scott: Maybe like one of those big statues of a naked Greek guy You know because they have statues of naked Greek guys and a lot of them are pretty cool.

319
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:36,019
Scott: And of course everyone took this to mean that Scott likes naked Greek guys gay.

320
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:38,486
Rym: Well, the thing is it was.

321
00:24:38,907 --> 00:24:42,760
Rym: I want a statue in the house, you know, like one of those big naked Greek guys.

322
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:43,783
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much.

323
00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:50,970
Rym: and the room paused for a good ten seconds for we all just stared at Scott because that came out of Nowhere, it didn't really come out of nowhere.

324
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,859
Scott: I think it wasn't a non sequitur.

325
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:55,440
Rym: Big naked Greek guys came out of nowhere.

326
00:24:55,804 --> 00:24:57,120
Rym: That is not what we were expecting.

327
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:01,880
Scott: Well recently because sculpture I think is a very unappreciated art form in modern times.

328
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:13,313
Scott: mostly I think because I'm mostly a fan if you couldn't tell of the Realistic kind of looks like people sculpture, you know, like when it's a statue but from far away It might be a person because it's so damn good.

329
00:25:13,454 --> 00:25:14,722
Scott: That's the kind of sculptures I like.

330
00:25:15,244 --> 00:25:23,596
Scott: but mostly nowadays the sculptures you see are things like the Sentinel at RIT Which is just some sort of abstract mess of shapes and materials.

331
00:25:23,677 --> 00:25:24,903
Scott: and you know This.

332
00:25:25,064 --> 00:25:27,580
Scott: I'm not saying that's wrong or bad, but I just not my preference.

333
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:33,640
Scott: I don't like that kind of sculpture as much as the you know Looks like a person made of one rock sculpture.

334
00:25:34,142 --> 00:25:44,096
Rym: See I remember when they built the Sentinel and I wished at the time that instead they had built some sort of Equivalent of the Colossus of Rhodes some gigantic tiger over the entrance to RIT.

335
00:25:44,136 --> 00:25:50,260
Scott: Yeah, we already had a little tiger Make that same thing only standing up on its rear legs maybe leaning on building one or something like that.

336
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:53,020
Rym: I think the scratching building one that would've been great.

337
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:58,680
Rym: I think the only reason they didn't was they calculated how many frat boys would die trying to paint the balls gold.

338
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:05,830
Scott: All right, so Recently on dig an awesome link appeared that I appreciate very much.

339
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:09,880
Scott: The link is five greatest sculptors of all time.

340
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:22,747
Scott: And well most of them four out of five of them are sculptures sculptors from very long ago that sculpted mostly Sculptures of people that are very realistic.

341
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:25,174
Rym: gonna hazard a guess is a Michelangelo in there.

342
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:25,836
Scott: He's number two.

343
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:29,638
Rym: How about Leonardo rafael donatello and splinter?

344
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,309
Scott: Donatello is number one, but no one.

345
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,400
Scott: none of the other Ninja Turtles have made a list.

346
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:43,840
Rym: I hate to say it but I get the impression that the only reason the majority of people in the world Even have heard of Michelangelo is because of the Ninja Turtles.

347
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:55,240
Scott: No, I think people would have heard of Michelangelo without the Ninja Turtles But Donatello Leonardo and Rafi all Leonardo people would have known also But they I bet a lot of people don't know that Leonardo turn into turtle is da Vinci.

348
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:57,480
Scott: They wouldn't like they wouldn't have mixed it up.

349
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:08,000
Scott: I remember when I was a little kid like I knew Leonardo da Vinci was and I knew the Ninja Turtles were named after like Ancient Renaissance artists, but I didn't match up Leonardo the turtle with Leonardo da Vinci.

350
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:09,714
Scott: I thought it was like some other Leonardo.

351
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:10,379
Scott: That was an artist.

352
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:13,874
Rym: Yeah, because Leonardo the turtle wouldn't have had trouble with that plum cherry.

353
00:27:13,994 --> 00:27:18,045
Scott: That's for sure our plum tomato Yep, but yeah I would definitely wouldn't.

354
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:22,200
Scott: I personally would not have known who rafael or donatello were without the Ninja Turtles.

355
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,424
Rym: But it's so obvious.

356
00:27:23,465 --> 00:27:34,600
Scott: Donatello was obviously that Renaissance guy with the post a yep Obviously, so number three is John Lorenzo Bernini, and I'm looking at his sculptures here, and they're pretty cool.

357
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,263
Scott: He's got this one.

358
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:36,870
Scott: It looks like Zeus or maybe it's?

359
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:44,609
Scott: Nope it see rape of Proserpina is the name of the sculpture, but it doesn't look like a rape of Proserpina to me.

360
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,609
Scott: Like Zeus or King Triton He's got like a little crown going on.

361
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:52,218
Scott: But the the sculpture.

362
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:53,243
Scott: that kind of freaked me out.

363
00:27:53,263 --> 00:28:02,130
Scott: cuz I scrolled down quickly And I saw the leg on the sculpture And I thought it was a real leg like it even looks like it has hair on it, and then it's skin colored.

364
00:28:02,232 --> 00:28:02,989
Scott: It's kind of scary.

365
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:04,412
Rym: Wait a minute.

366
00:28:04,693 --> 00:28:09,650
Rym: she thought it was real because it had a muscly leg with skin colored hair on it.

367
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,390
Scott: Well, no because like you look at it, and it looks like a real leg like damn.

368
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:16,157
Scott: Number four is Rodin.

369
00:28:16,198 --> 00:28:17,343
Scott: who's the guy Rodin?

370
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,850
Scott: I don't know how to say it, but he's the.

371
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:24,004
Scott: He's the guy who made the thinker and the hell's gate and all that stuff.

372
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:28,718
Scott: and the fifth one is Constantine Broncussi who's a more recent sculptor.

373
00:28:28,738 --> 00:28:35,563
Scott: he died in 57 and I look at it the two sculptures They display here as you know I guess examples of his work.

374
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:40,790
Scott: the second one is the endless column Which she looks just kind of weird, and I don't really like it that much.

375
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,750
Scott: But the first one is the kiss and it looks like it might be small.

376
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:51,867
Scott: I can't really tell the size of it from the picture, but it's not realistic, but I kind of like it anyway It's it's it's kind of cute.

377
00:28:52,592 --> 00:29:03,190
Rym: So uh I heard that the Bavarian Illuminati controls the economy of the United States Really and that the WTO is working with the UN and the EU to create a new world order.

378
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:08,269
Rym: And they're going to use tech Mars to ship us all into tennis courts that are actually concentration camps.

379
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:24,128
Rym: Alright, yeah, and it turns out that the people who killed Kennedy are still alive But Kennedy is also still alive because there were two concurrent conspiracies And in fact Kennedy was shot so many times that the bullets hit each other inside and bounced out thus.

380
00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:35,000
Rym: He was okay Uh-huh, so they replaced his brain with an alien brain, but that alien brain caused 9/11 because you see Wtc7 wouldn't have fallen except for the alright.

381
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,104
Rym: I can't go on anymore.

382
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:37,610
Scott: I couldn't even go on at all.

383
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,128
Scott: I'm surprised you could keep it going like as far as you did.

384
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:44,036
Scott: I Can't even come up with that shit.

385
00:29:44,057 --> 00:29:44,640
Scott: It's so dumb.

386
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:49,207
Rym: see I could come up with realistic ones But I really took pains not to in this case.

387
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:59,450
Scott: yes Today we're gonna talk about Conspiracy theories because well They're just something that pisses us off and a lot of people believe in them, and we think those people are idiots.

388
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:16,670
Rym: Yep it basically comes down to the fact that a lot of people when something is somewhat unexplained or Not all the facts are known about a situation and for whatever reason they will latch on to this and fill in the unknown quantities with aliens and freemasons.

389
00:30:17,497 --> 00:30:18,949
Rym: It's always aliens and freemasons.

390
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:23,670
Scott: Yeah, it's the same way that like when there's a hole in science people fill it in with God.

391
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:29,850
Scott: Well when there's a hole in history people always fill it in with aliens freemasons and shadow governments and illuminatis.

392
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:32,344
Rym: I mean granted like look at the Kennedy assassination in the US.

393
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:44,570
Rym: We don't know a hundred percent, and we probably never will unless like there's some magic footage We didn't know or some great confession somewhere that anyone was in a great confession is probably a lie.

394
00:30:44,651 --> 00:31:02,410
Rym: Yeah, cuz I've been a couple of semi Unbelievable confessions in the past yep, but while we won't ever really know There's a big leap from saying there's still something fishy about that Or we don't know why that happened to saying it was a conspiracy.

395
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:13,728
Scott: Yep, I mean what's more believable a guy named Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and had a gun and shot the president driving in a car while the president was driving down the road.

396
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:18,090
Scott: or Some crazy mafia some crazy shadow government.

397
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:32,209
Scott: Hi again this guy and a bunch in the CIA all got together and made a crazy plot that somehow no one knew about and there's no record of whatsoever and no evidence of anywhere in the world and They killed the president somehow and made it look like this guy did it.

398
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,100
Scott: Which one of those is more likely?

399
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,830
Rym: I believe Occam's razor comes to mind.

400
00:31:40,414 --> 00:31:42,950
Rym: I think the worst one for me lately the one that bothers me.

401
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,498
Scott: well actually 9/11 ones bother me lately the most.

402
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:51,419
Scott: that one bothers me the most because it's on the internet a lot and a lot of People are believing it lately, which makes it even worse.

403
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:51,941
Scott: Yep.

404
00:31:52,383 --> 00:31:54,070
Rym: I think the worst thing is that loose change.

405
00:31:54,331 --> 00:32:06,201
Rym: I've watched it and it was just stupid and a bunch of it got refuted or Straight-up contradicted by science pretty much right away and all the loose change people did was Alter the video to remove the parts where they got owned

406
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:09,133
Scott: and there's a great video I remember watching.

407
00:32:09,153 --> 00:32:10,017
Scott: was it a thing of the day?

408
00:32:10,057 --> 00:32:12,005
Scott: it might have been where they're.

409
00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:19,486
Scott: basically there were two Scientists like engineers real scientists with relevant knowledge and the two loose change guys.

410
00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:22,937
Scott: loose change guys said some bullshit And the engineers just like you're wrong.

411
00:32:22,997 --> 00:32:28,858
Scott: science science, and then the loose change guys had like this laugh like No, you're not a conspiracy man.

412
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,365
Scott: You're totally conspiracy.

413
00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:33,634
Scott: You're all in on it And I was like whoa.

414
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:35,099
Scott: see whoa.

415
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:44,894
Rym: if a conspiracy got to the point to where that many people Were in on it which basically for loose change includes the entire Scientific community

416
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:47,002
Scott: of the world except for the one guy

417
00:32:47,484 --> 00:32:50,358
Rym: then it's not a conspiracy anymore If everyone

418
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:50,923
Scott: in the world

419
00:32:50,983 --> 00:32:51,890
Rym: has to be in on it.

420
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:57,250
Rym: But you you best reconsider your idea of how the world works because you're probably wrong.

421
00:32:57,972 --> 00:33:02,710
Scott: Yeah, man GeekNights, so we're not on television and not millionaires because the whole world is against us.

422
00:33:03,052 --> 00:33:03,899
Scott: They got a plan.

423
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,230
Scott: they want to keep the nerds down.

424
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:08,830
Scott: They know we're too good for them didn't all the reason we have to settle for the shitty podcast?

425
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:16,390
Rym: Didn't all those shitty other webcomic artists in that documentary where penny arcade also kind of participated keep saying stuff like that?

426
00:33:16,972 --> 00:33:17,596
Scott: Maybe they?

427
00:33:17,636 --> 00:33:23,130
Scott: I think they were on the track a little bit But I don't think they came out and said there's a giant conspiracy against webcomics.

428
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:29,130
Scott: I think they what they generally did is like yeah regular comics looks down on us, and it's not cool.

429
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:38,869
Rym: I see I got the impression that they were saying more that the media doesn't want out like they try to take away all the Possibility of independent artists getting out there, and then penny.

430
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:40,076
Scott: okay I see it.

431
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:42,610
Scott: penny arcade is in newspapers and magazines.

432
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:46,163
Scott: PvP is all over the place or drew the stick is printing books.

433
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,970
Rym: mega Tokyo is still popular.

434
00:33:48,131 --> 00:33:51,770
Scott: Yeah, mega Tokyo has a manga that's published in the bookstores and sells a lot.

435
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,781
Scott: I don't know why but it I don't see that happening.

436
00:33:55,062 --> 00:33:57,330
Scott: Boasus just got put on comics.com.

437
00:33:58,172 --> 00:34:10,745
Rym: Well, I think my favorite loose change bit recently was that not too long ago it was in the national news, but a tanker full of gas flipped over and set on fire on a bridge and Melted the steel support structure under the road.

438
00:34:11,147 --> 00:34:20,830
Rym: huh now I believe that one of the chorus deepest most important assertions of these loose change crackpots Was that you can't melt steel with a gas fire?

439
00:34:21,672 --> 00:34:32,732
Scott: You can ah huh even though the scientists have been saying that all along, but No, I wonder if these loose guys change guys ever went in their backyard with some gas and some steel and tried to set it on fire.

440
00:34:32,772 --> 00:34:33,233
Rym: you know what.

441
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:43,266
Rym: my guess is that the people who made loose change don't believe it and Totally know exactly what they're doing and are doing this solely for the publicity cakes.

442
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:44,270
Rym: Maybe some money?

443
00:34:44,672 --> 00:34:45,739
Rym: I'm sure they're gonna make money off.

444
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:47,489
Scott: It sounds like a crazy conspiracy thing to me.

445
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,737
Scott: I think they're just ignorant fools.

446
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,870
Scott: see I don't know much simpler explanation.

447
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:56,830
Rym: I think they're both equally simple because I think about the level of hoax that we could probably pull off.

448
00:34:56,991 --> 00:35:01,309
Rym: We were so inclined and the only reason we don't is that we don't like hoaxes.

449
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:02,493
Scott: Yeah, the thing is.

450
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:07,553
Scott: I'm pretty sure they actually believe it because of the way they acted in that one video on that interview on TV.

451
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:08,543
Rym: yeah, there's a good chance.

452
00:35:08,563 --> 00:35:09,230
Rym: They're just idiots.

453
00:35:09,461 --> 00:35:13,969
Rym: Yeah But the one that bothers me a little more for some reason is the the u.s.

454
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,155
Rym: Didn't go to the moon.

455
00:35:15,456 --> 00:35:16,501
Rym: that was all faked.

456
00:35:16,822 --> 00:35:18,510
Rym: They filmed it in a studio somewhere.

457
00:35:20,072 --> 00:35:22,728
Rym: In fact the last couple of episodes of Penn's radio show.

458
00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:29,838
Rym: They really I didn't bother listening to all of them because he let there's this crazy crackpot that I guess he's friends with.

459
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:35,516
Rym: talk about the moon conspiracy and there was a semi-legitimate scientist trying to argue against him.

460
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:41,673
Rym: and I realized at that point that you can't argue with these people because if you put Forth a bad argument.

461
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:44,342
Rym: They'll shoot you down if you put forth a good argument.

462
00:35:44,763 --> 00:35:49,330
Rym: They'll either deflect by saying oh Well, even if you're right about that you can't explain that.

463
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:55,070
Rym: And for every one thing you stamp out they've got ten more waiting and you know what it is.

464
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,855
Rym: It's like ground pound down with these people.

465
00:35:57,035 --> 00:36:11,103
Scott: basically the people are irrational and they if they see that there is some sort of Possibility right they need in order for them to change their crazy ideas And believe something that's obvious as opposed to something crazy.

466
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:15,337
Scott: They need you to remove 100% of the doubt.

467
00:36:15,377 --> 00:36:18,270
Scott: they need you to remove a hundred and ten percent of the doubt, which is impossible.

468
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,165
Scott: There needs to be no doubt whatsoever.

469
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:20,669
Scott: And you know what?

470
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:30,030
Scott: There's always at least a philosophical doubt and I don't think that that level of doubting if that if the only doubt was Philosophical doubt these people would still believe their crazy conspiracy.

471
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:44,073
Scott: Yeah They basically believe what they want or some fantasy crazy world that they've imagined in their heads because it makes sense to them Despite because they've completely ignored all evidence in reality and they believe that and they won't change their mind No matter what.

472
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,250
Rym: and yet a lot of people fall for this bullshit.

473
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:51,870
Scott: Well, I can say that when I was a kid, I believed in stuff too.

474
00:36:52,392 --> 00:36:58,142
Scott: I thought there was aliens and I thought that Sutton up with that Kennedy assassination.

475
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:58,384
Scott: So

476
00:36:58,525 --> 00:37:02,345
Rym: I'll say I will say this I still think they're aliens in the sense that in

477
00:37:02,606 --> 00:37:03,310
Scott: all Mexicans

478
00:37:05,352 --> 00:37:16,116
Rym: In all of the existence that is out there and all the billions and billions and billions of stars We have observed the odds are that there is some form of what we might consider life Somewhere out there.

479
00:37:16,157 --> 00:37:21,965
Scott: the odds are that there's probably about one maybe two As far as the stars that we can see now.

480
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:28,005
Rym: It doesn't matter because that's not the thing that these people aren't saying.

481
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,210
Rym: yeah, there's life out there.

482
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:35,090
Rym: They're saying yeah, the aliens buzz earth and the government knows and they abduct people.

483
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:36,053
Scott: Yeah, it's like that.

484
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:40,630
Scott: remember that video over the Phoenix sky that had like this blurry dot moving around.

485
00:37:40,913 --> 00:37:42,510
Rym: How come it's always a blurry dot?

486
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:48,890
Scott: This is the thing I found a way to remove basically all doubt that all reasonable doubt that there are aliens.

487
00:37:49,556 --> 00:37:54,825
Scott: Find every conspiracy nut Ufologists than what they call themselves, but I don't like using our just.

488
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:55,890
Rym: I prefer the term.

489
00:37:56,131 --> 00:37:59,810
Scott: I don't like calling anyone an odd gist or an aji if it's not a real science.

490
00:38:00,392 --> 00:38:01,977
Rym: I prefer the term crackpot.

491
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:02,941
Scott: crackpot is a good one.

492
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,610
Scott: go to Roswell find all those crackpots and you know what?

493
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:06,552
Scott: Give them.

494
00:38:06,714 --> 00:38:09,190
Scott: just give them HD video cameras.

495
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:12,969
Scott: They make this all the best by now for less than a thousand dollars And you know what?

496
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:25,370
Scott: I think it's worth that price to give all these people HD video cameras and that way they'll go home watching their HD footage and They won't see any little fuzzy dots or fuzzy cigar shaped objects floating through the sky.

497
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,790
Scott: They'll see an airplane a bird something a reflective balloon.

498
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,760
Scott: They just some kid let go and fly away into the sky.

499
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,790
Scott: I don't know a false shooting star during the day.

500
00:38:36,452 --> 00:38:44,579
Scott: They'll see what the fuck it is and they'll see that it's not a goddamn green green man and fucking UFOs abducting people with cows and shit.

501
00:38:44,901 --> 00:38:49,888
Rym: now, I will say that when I was a kid, I also was leaning toward believing a lot of this.

502
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:56,913
Rym: and When I would say a kid I'm talking like first grade second grade, although it may be up to the third fourth Maybe fifth grade.

503
00:38:57,374 --> 00:39:06,790
Rym: funny how I stopped believing in God long before I stopped believing in UFOs and Kennedy conspiracy theories, yes, they're a lot more plausible

504
00:39:07,234 --> 00:39:07,477
Scott: Yeah,

505
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:15,060
Rym: but anyway I blame at least in terms of my childhood and a lot of the things I believed or at least Accounted for the possibility of.

506
00:39:15,582 --> 00:39:17,030
Rym: I blame unsolved mysteries.

507
00:39:17,331 --> 00:39:24,550
Scott: Yeah, I blame the sci-fi channel mostly and fate magazine because my grandma fate magazine you say my grandma never heard of such a thing.

508
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,777
Rym: Oh my god, you want to have some fun.

509
00:39:27,078 --> 00:39:28,041
Rym: read fate magazine.

510
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:28,864
Scott: Does it still exist?

511
00:39:29,144 --> 00:39:31,634
Scott: Probably let's search for it fate fate.

512
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:41,276
Rym: my grandma subscribed to it and it was nothing but Conspiracy theories UFOs and ghosts and say magazine true reports of the strange unknown It was.

513
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:44,310
Rym: it's so such a. it's so god-awful.

514
00:39:44,391 --> 00:39:45,508
Rym: I can't even really talk about it.

515
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:58,487
Rym: but when you're like in first grade and you're sitting at your grandma's house while she's telling you ghost stories and you're watching Unsolved mysteries where they talk about the guy who had pictures of aliens but then the fucking government came and stole it and

516
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:06,650
Scott: One thing I remember seeing on TV that convinced me a lot was this guy had Like this piece of metal like covered in glass.

517
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:14,319
Scott: It was like a ring of metal with like a glass coating completely coating the whole thing and he's like This is a hundred percent aluminum covered in glass.

518
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:23,316
Scott: I found this at such crater somewhere on earth You can't make a hundred percent aluminum unless you're in space and I was like as a kid I was like that seals the deal.

519
00:40:23,717 --> 00:40:24,179
Scott: There it is.

520
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,142
Scott: How can you deny it?

521
00:40:25,303 --> 00:40:27,250
Scott: But reality I didn't think that.

522
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:31,590
Scott: Oh, he's just lying and it's a piece of metal covered in glass and it's not a hundred percent aluminum.

523
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:32,794
Scott: And he didn't find it in a crater.

524
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:37,458
Scott: Well, he's never done a proper metallurgical test on it and it's just a thing He made.

525
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:41,530
Rym: yeah What really bothers me is whenever the media or the press talk to these crackpots.

526
00:40:42,052 --> 00:40:47,590
Rym: It's rare that they will ever directly and openly question them about the obvious.

527
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:50,190
Rym: They always do the opposite of begging the question.

528
00:40:50,571 --> 00:40:56,050
Rym: They'll let the begged question hang and they'll ask like so how did you come to believe blah blah blah?

529
00:40:56,591 --> 00:40:59,530
Rym: So what do you say to your detractors as opposed to asking the question?

530
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:03,464
Rym: I would have asked which is so uh, how do you know that that is 100% aluminum?

531
00:41:03,564 --> 00:41:07,530
Rym: Yeah How did you come to this conclusion?

532
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:09,936
Rym: Did you test it somehow?

533
00:41:10,096 --> 00:41:10,739
Scott: are you lying?

534
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,521
Rym: I guess you don't.

535
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:12,264
Rym: are you lying?

536
00:41:12,424 --> 00:41:14,050
Scott: because are you lying?

537
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:15,180
Scott: It's in glass.

538
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,808
Scott: make this up.

539
00:41:17,371 --> 00:41:27,390
Rym: the worst are the people who think that aliens abducted them because there might have been a time where I would have had sympathy for These people that maybe you know, they had some sort of sleep paralysis or something happened.

540
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,293
Rym: That's explainable.

541
00:41:28,715 --> 00:41:32,890
Rym: and then they went online and they saw these other crackpots and someone brainwashed him.

542
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:33,453
Rym: They made a case.

543
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:41,385
Rym: but now I'm of the mind that if you think that aliens abducted you I really have no recourse other than to laugh in your face until you leave or cry.

544
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:42,790
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

545
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:43,733
Rym: I don't even argue.

546
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:46,504
Rym: It's like if someone said that their child was an indigo child.

547
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,473
Rym: I wouldn't even try to argue I wouldn't even.

548
00:41:49,513 --> 00:41:50,396
Scott: it's basically hopeless.

549
00:41:50,757 --> 00:41:51,760
Rym: I wouldn't even bother.

550
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,610
Rym: I've lost hope for that person and I would just laugh in their face continuously.

551
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,717
Scott: Yeah, I guess that's what it comes down.

552
00:41:57,797 --> 00:41:59,603
Scott: All right, so let's do a little summary here.

553
00:41:59,703 --> 00:42:01,790
Scott: What is a conspiracy theory?

554
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:02,311
Rym: All right.

555
00:42:02,352 --> 00:42:05,470
Rym: Well, it's basically the opposite of Occam's razor.

556
00:42:06,294 --> 00:42:09,890
Rym: If if you haven't a belief, well, I guess we should just go through all the different.

557
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:37,220
Scott: I think what it is is that when there is a happening usually a historical happening and you don't know all the details and you come up with some explanation that While that explanation fits all the facts that you presently know it is not a simple explanation is in fact a crazy explanation that makes lots and lots of assumptions and Basically is completely crazy and unlikely and that I think that's what a conspiracy theory is.

558
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:46,272
Rym: Yeah you gotta go with Occam's razor here and remember Occam's razor doesn't say something so simple as The simplest solution is always the right one as a lot of people boil it down to.

559
00:42:46,774 --> 00:43:03,980
Rym: it's more the idea that all other things being equal Generally if you have two competing Theories as to how something happened or how something works or how something is put together The idea that requires fewer assumptions is more likely to be correct.

560
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:05,986
Rym: Yep, and that is true.

561
00:43:06,006 --> 00:43:08,012
Scott: It is absolutely true.

562
00:43:08,032 --> 00:43:10,820
Scott: I mean, let's say like I give you three pieces of evidence, right?

563
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,482
Scott: Let's here.

564
00:43:11,844 --> 00:43:12,988
Scott: I'm holding something ready.

565
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,860
Scott: The thing is so, you know what it can fit in my hand.

566
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:20,320
Scott: You know that it's red and you know that it's hot, right?

567
00:43:20,922 --> 00:43:22,179
Scott: So, let's see here.

568
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:28,297
Scott: It could be that I've just got a coal in my hand and it's hot and I'm being burned.

569
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:29,220
Scott: that's pretty likely.

570
00:43:29,703 --> 00:43:37,715
Scott: It could be that I've got I don't know One of those like hand warmer things and it's colored red, but no it makes sense.

571
00:43:37,735 --> 00:43:43,734
Scott: But no, it's actually the Sun Miniaturized so small that it fits in my hand inside a red capsule.

572
00:43:43,774 --> 00:43:49,360
Scott: that keeps it from incinerating me Generating power for all the whole world and I'm keeping it secret from everybody.

573
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:52,059
Rym: Yeah, I think that about sums it up.

574
00:43:52,280 --> 00:44:01,268
Rym: yeah, and I've noticed a lot of common threads among these conspiracy theorists is that they all seem to be afraid of something that they call the New World Order.

575
00:44:01,669 --> 00:44:06,901
Rym: or sometimes sometimes they'll tie in the WTO or World Bank.

576
00:44:07,242 --> 00:44:15,770
Rym: a lot of times they advocate the gold standard or they they talk about some sort of Conspiracy involving money back in the day.

577
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,357
Scott: It's like anything.

578
00:44:17,397 --> 00:44:18,100
Scott: that's secret.

579
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,489
Scott: Like if anyone keeps a secret like it's.

580
00:44:20,529 --> 00:44:23,480
Scott: the governments of the world and groups in the world need to keep secrets.

581
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,532
Scott: Sometimes sometimes they don't and they do anyway, but I don't like it.

582
00:44:26,713 --> 00:44:27,957
Scott: They do it anything.

583
00:44:27,978 --> 00:44:28,560
Scott: That's secret.

584
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:34,237
Scott: Conspiracy theorists will assume that it's the worst craziest possible thing imaginable.

585
00:44:34,257 --> 00:44:35,080
Scott: that's being kept secret.

586
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:40,420
Scott: Oh some general had a meeting and the whatever he talked about at that meeting was not released.

587
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:45,900
Scott: Well likely I would say he was probably just talking about some like Iraqi war strategy.

588
00:44:46,001 --> 00:44:47,370
Scott: He doesn't want people to know.

589
00:44:47,572 --> 00:44:51,940
Rym: but no obviously Aliens, obviously they were talking about the new alien craft.

590
00:44:52,040 --> 00:45:00,378
Scott: He's talking to an alien about the alien craft that he was purchasing to use to fight the old ones in Antarctica.

591
00:45:01,744 --> 00:45:03,354
Rym: Who keeps the metric system down?

592
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:07,505
Rym: we do we do All right.

593
00:45:07,545 --> 00:45:10,900
Scott: So how do you detect a conspiracy theory?

594
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:21,872
Rym: Well, one of the things that they they seem to do a lot particularly the ones who were a little more adept at avoiding direct questioning Is they'll always kind of deflect whenever you question them directly.

595
00:45:22,132 --> 00:45:24,520
Rym: They will always say things like how should I know?

596
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:37,898
Rym: I'm not a scientist but still it makes you wonder or yeah, but even if that's correct, you can't prove the blah I think the moon one was the worst on pen show when he was talking and the guys the guys saying all right Here's some proof that we went to the moon.

597
00:45:38,785 --> 00:45:43,780
Rym: When they went to the moon They left the lunar rovers up there and they left a bunch of mirrors up there.

598
00:45:44,061 --> 00:45:47,492
Rym: In fact you from your house can shine lasers at him and get reflections back.

599
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:48,014
Scott: Yep.

600
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:49,760
Scott: You can have really good aim.

601
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,345
Rym: And his answer was like,

602
00:45:51,426 --> 00:45:51,727
Scott: oh, well,

603
00:45:51,888 --> 00:45:56,862
Rym: uh, we could have put those up there with an unmanned spacecraft And

604
00:45:56,922 --> 00:46:01,200
Scott: no matter how you get a powerful enough telescope you can see footprints up there, you know, yeah

605
00:46:01,421 --> 00:46:03,635
Rym: Oh, we could have sent a robot up there that made the footprints.

606
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:04,520
Scott: Where's the robot?

607
00:46:05,301 --> 00:46:07,651
Scott: Yeah, it should be up there still then shouldn't it?

608
00:46:08,012 --> 00:46:11,207
Scott: yeah, yeah, huh How come the things in this picture?

609
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,680
Scott: exactly the same as the things on the moon?

610
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,494
Scott: like he made this pattern of footprints in the video.

611
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:23,884
Scott: and well The pattern of footprints that we look at with the telescope on the moon is the same and they'll always make a lot of assertions.

612
00:46:24,308 --> 00:46:25,275
Rym: bang bang bang like.

613
00:46:25,558 --> 00:46:40,320
Rym: well This is just proven in this and this and this and this and this and they'll put forth all these things like the shotgun of Crazy ideas that all of which Allow for their conspiracy to be true and a lot of them are patently untrue.

614
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:52,216
Scott: In fact, well, obviously all of them usually I've noticed what is conspiracy theorists nowadays like the clever ones will be like this and this and this and this and this and this and like 75 to 80 percent of those will be true and it's just like.

615
00:46:52,497 --> 00:46:54,826
Scott: but their whole Crazy nut job.

616
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:57,114
Scott: This relies on the 25% of untrue ones.

617
00:46:58,841 --> 00:47:04,587
Scott: Like if you any of those is shown to be untrue which they are But they believe in those untrue things.

618
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:08,780
Scott: therefore their craziness holds up and they refuse to believe that the assumptions are untrue.

619
00:47:09,081 --> 00:47:13,052
Scott: But they only argue above those assumptions because they've assumed them.

620
00:47:13,534 --> 00:47:15,560
Scott: They don't even think about going against them.

621
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:25,580
Rym: There's definitely a shade better for the ones I see where they just throw a bunch of things out there Knowing that it takes a lot more time to debunk their craziness that it does for them to make up new craziness.

622
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:29,694
Rym: So every time once you've debunked them all they just make up more like.

623
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:33,459
Rym: and then if you debunk everything They'll just say that you're part of the conspiracy.

624
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:35,604
Rym: To which point?

625
00:47:35,805 --> 00:47:43,875
Rym: if someone ever said that to me, I would lean in very close and say yes I am and if you speak a word of this to anyone I'm going to have you killed.

626
00:47:44,357 --> 00:47:45,200
Scott: That's a good idea.

627
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:51,280
Rym: Yeah It's kind of like what I do whenever I argue with Christians because it always comes down to do that to the guys down at.

628
00:47:52,924 --> 00:47:54,148
Rym: I wonder if those guys are still there.

629
00:47:54,589 --> 00:47:57,058
Scott: Oh, I'm pretty sure they're still there every day next time.

630
00:47:57,098 --> 00:47:57,700
Rym: I'm in Chinatown.

631
00:47:57,861 --> 00:47:59,830
Rym: I'm gonna go might have to mess with them.

632
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:01,840
Scott: I hate those guys so much better.

633
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:06,120
Rym: Why don't we make a bunch of fake documents and give them to them all hurriedly?

634
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,791
Rym: Like we'll get this briefcase a beat-up briefcase, right?

635
00:48:09,395 --> 00:48:10,179
Scott: Oh my god.

636
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:17,169
Rym: and we'll lock it and we'll make a bunch of documents and We'll put them all on our website right away.

637
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:19,980
Rym: Like alright, this is what we're gonna see these idiots with.

638
00:48:20,222 --> 00:48:22,959
Rym: We want you all to watch for them to hit the conspiracy sites.

639
00:48:25,382 --> 00:48:25,844
Rym: You know what.

640
00:48:26,388 --> 00:48:27,534
Scott: that's a great idea.

641
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:28,399
Rym: we might have to do this.

642
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:37,155
Scott: We got a print of a bunch of fake government documents and then like get the Manila Envelope going on and the sunglasses and just like pass it to one of those guys.

643
00:48:37,255 --> 00:48:48,760
Rym: Yep, or even better I could dress up in a suit and put on some dark glasses and you like run by kind of like and like And you like drop it and be like you say something crazy and then you just run away.

644
00:48:49,102 --> 00:49:05,253
Rym: So they're looking at it and then I walk by with you know with my hand in my ear like all the people do in the movies and looking around like They do cuz they're already pissed off for us making fun of them.

645
00:49:06,036 --> 00:49:06,820
Rym: I doubt they listen.

646
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:07,664
Scott: I already.

647
00:49:07,684 --> 00:49:10,197
Scott: I also doubt they listen but goddamn that would be a little.

648
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:10,820
Scott: we're gonna do that.

649
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,759
Rym: I think I think we are because it's so easy to do.

650
00:49:13,162 --> 00:49:16,180
Scott: I think the thing is I don't have time to make up the fake government documents right now.

651
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,760
Scott: I do have time to deliver the fake government documents though.

652
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,796
Scott: so if someone can make up fake government documents that that like.

653
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:32,816
Scott: if You someone believed the documents were true that they would also believe that like Bush We made a plan with aliens to do 9/11 and they were actually no one on the planes.

654
00:49:32,876 --> 00:49:36,005
Scott: and all those people are secretly Especially by aliens.

655
00:49:36,225 --> 00:49:45,100
Rym: if the documents look like they're for someone else and they're kind of crumpled and old maybe typewriter stuff And especially they have to look like they were shredded it and taped together.

656
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:45,846
Rym: That's even better.

657
00:49:46,027 --> 00:49:47,620
Rym: or if a bunch of stuff was redacted

658
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:57,260
Scott: You got to make it look real like it was actually a federal government document and Like if someone wanted to get rid of it and someone else rescued it somehow

659
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:03,076
Rym: you know what would be best if you took real government documents from the Freedom of Information Act and The head for Jack.

660
00:50:03,116 --> 00:50:06,209
Scott: Yeah You just use no same font and just type different things in them.

661
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:13,637
Rym: take ones that are real and have redacted content and then Replace the redacted content with bullshit and then give it to them.

662
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:15,605
Scott: Oh That's pretty hot.

663
00:50:15,705 --> 00:50:16,548
Rym: That's good.

664
00:50:16,668 --> 00:50:17,271
Rym: Oh, that's great.

665
00:50:17,652 --> 00:50:21,147
Rym: But yeah, it's a lot like what I was saying the argument I do with Christians where what?

666
00:50:21,308 --> 00:50:22,616
Rym: eventually I'll just say, you know what?

667
00:50:23,038 --> 00:50:33,980
Rym: All right I'll assume you're right because even if you're right, I would still side with Satan Dun-dun-dun because I've freaked some people out with that argument because there's nothing they can say to that.

668
00:50:34,381 --> 00:50:39,280
Rym: Yeah, there's nothing they can say to me saying fine when your rapture comes I'll be on the other side.

669
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:41,497
Scott: I'd rather I'd rather serve in hell.

670
00:50:41,558 --> 00:50:47,713
Rym: then Scott if you're going to say I'd rather serve in hell.

671
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:49,260
Rym: I think you got it wrong.

672
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:50,285
Scott: I think I do have a wrong.

673
00:50:50,305 --> 00:50:50,626
Scott: what is it?

674
00:50:50,646 --> 00:50:53,942
Rym: It's like I'd rather rule and I would rather rule in hell than serve in heaven I got.

675
00:50:54,022 --> 00:50:55,829
Rym: what do you think that quote is actually from?

676
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:56,552
Scott: I don't know.

677
00:50:56,572 --> 00:50:57,074
Scott: Uh-huh.

678
00:50:57,837 --> 00:51:01,408
Rym: I Think you'll find the answer kind of funny Simpson Seinfeld.

679
00:51:01,608 --> 00:51:02,691
Rym: No way before that.

680
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:04,777
Scott: Uh, I don't know.

681
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:05,800
Rym: It's not what you think.
