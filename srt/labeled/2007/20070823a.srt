1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,347
Rym: It's Thursday August 23rd.

2
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:13,330
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:16,720
Rym: I'm Scott and this is you know what fuck it?

4
00:00:16,943 --> 00:00:17,715
Rym: I just don't even care.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,377
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:42,110
Rym: So yeah despite the fact that both Scott and myself had plans to not be around last night We ended up both being around and we were so lazy that not only did we not do the show But we didn't even do the Rym and Emily special.

7
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:44,058
Scott: We didn't do Jack or shit.

8
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:46,830
Scott: last night I played some of that system shock game.

9
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,900
Scott: You know what I did and I played some paper Mario.

10
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:54,477
Rym: I washed my pants and then I proceeded to play natural selection until way too late.

11
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:59,840
Scott: Wow Yeah, if I was booted into windows, this is the problem in video game season.

12
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,944
Scott: Is that I?

13
00:01:00,964 --> 00:01:01,727
Scott: you know game.

14
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:05,560
Scott: video games that don't take a long time to play are generally DS games.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,746
Scott: So I played them on the train.

16
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:09,639
Scott: So when it's video game season, I play video games at home.

17
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:11,266
Scott: I actually play them.

18
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:13,094
Scott: not much else goes on.

19
00:01:13,134 --> 00:01:15,604
Scott: I'll be sitting there for like an hour Or two at each game.

20
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,214
Scott: Yeah, and I'm casting takes a backseat.

21
00:01:18,676 --> 00:01:19,700
Rym: No, it doesn't really take it back

22
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:21,357
Scott: It doesn't but you know what I'm saying,

23
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:28,160
Rym: though I was playing natural selection pretty much from the moment I came home from work until Scott came into my room and said hey, we're gonna do the show

24
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:30,691
Scott: And then we didn't do the show

25
00:01:31,053 --> 00:01:32,220
Rym: for like another half hour

26
00:01:33,222 --> 00:01:34,467
Scott: At all yesterday.

27
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:35,270
Rym: Oh, yes.

28
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,053
Rym: I'm talking about today.

29
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:37,097
Scott: Oh, yeah today.

30
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:38,943
Scott: Yeah All right.

31
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:47,579
Scott: Well, actually today I got home and I started playing paper Mario and I stopped a bit like eventually when I said hey, I should do the show.

32
00:01:48,222 --> 00:01:51,338
Rym: Yeah, my video game cue is really backed up right now.

33
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,807
Rym: Even worse is there's a deep.

34
00:01:53,868 --> 00:02:02,920
Rym: we have a Netflix movie that I really want to watch but Scott doesn't seem to care about Mutiny on the bounty the original and I'm all excited about it, but I just don't have time to watch.

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,007
Rym: He's just like two hours long.

36
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:04,932
Scott: So watch on the train.

37
00:02:04,953 --> 00:02:06,140
Rym: I don't have a laptop.

38
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:08,633
Rym: I guess I could borrow Emily's but you should get one of those.

39
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:09,880
Scott: I'm thinking about a bull DVD.

40
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:15,180
Rym: The only reason I haven't bought one of those portable DVD dealies is that I'm currently reading books on the train.

41
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:18,253
Scott: And I know actually just today I was reading a book on the train.

42
00:02:18,293 --> 00:02:20,462
Rym: and the worst thing is I don't have enough time to Even read.

43
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:24,517
Rym: I have an hour on the train and I get to work and I think crap.

44
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:25,460
Rym: I want to keep reading.

45
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,926
Scott: I have a weird relationship.

46
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:28,191
Scott: I love to read books.

47
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,540
Scott: the kind that I've were only words read a book.

48
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,320
Scott: But I get a box full of books of pictures every month.

49
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,877
Scott: So and for some reason I read those really quick as fast as I can.

50
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,348
Rym: Scott You should not a sports page not amazing.

51
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:55,975
Scott: Yeah, it's not a sports page or mag not a one-piece not no Naruto But a book anyway, but so I don't actually like start reading novels often But whenever I start reading one, I can't stop reading it and I read it stupidly fast.

52
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:57,320
Rym: Yeah, that was the problem.

53
00:02:57,441 --> 00:03:05,480
Rym: I mean I did a geek bite about it not too long ago but Alex Got me hooked on these prints of nothing books and I read all of them pretty much as fast as he could give them to.

54
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:11,020
Rym: And now I'm reading Plutarch's histories and they're super awesome All right.

55
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:19,684
Rym: I feel a little more erudite though because Scott's reading comic books and I'm reading ancient historians works on even a more ancient Personalities in Rome.

56
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:21,792
Scott: Yeah, but the comic books I read are literary.

57
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:24,060
Scott: I don't read those underwear perfect comp books.

58
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,805
Rym: So what comic book you're reading right now?

59
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:27,610
Scott: I'm not reading any comic books right now.

60
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:30,156
Rym: Ah, so what's the last comic book you read?

61
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,508
Scott: I read Will Eisner edge of genius.

62
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:36,395
Rym: All right, I can't make funnier for that.

63
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:37,178
Scott: Okay, right?

64
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,930
Rym: So I got a news tonight and it's not really a new news.

65
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,919
Rym: In fact, this is news that was news ten years ago.

66
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:53,720
Rym: But I've realized in reading what people say about this issue on the internet that most people out there have Absolutely, no idea what this issue actually is.

67
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,887
Scott: Well, I have an inside scoop on this.

68
00:03:55,947 --> 00:04:02,760
Scott: is that on the most recent episode of twit last week an inside scoop I know is that a guy was talking about it.

69
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,640
Scott: Hence if you go to sites like slash dot and dig where there are many twit listeners the conversation is carrying on from that.

70
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:13,120
Rym: Man, you know, I haven't listened to twit in like three months ever since I stopped.

71
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:14,667
Rym: I got to get some earbuds.

72
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,300
Rym: So when I'm playing Pokemon, I can also listen to podcasts.

73
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:23,180
Scott: I know I just actually sent my earbuds in for RMA because the right the wire to the right ear got loose.

74
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:25,018
Scott: So it's like I had to keep jiggling it.

75
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:30,520
Scott: So I sent him in and if you know at the very worst I could get a replacement pair for like half price.

76
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,183
Scott: So why not?

77
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:35,580
Scott: but now I need to go and buy some like shit $5 earbuds to hold me over until they come back.

78
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,989
Rym: Thing is I just never drive anywhere anymore.

79
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:48,439
Rym: And also actually of all awesomes this morning I get to work and I got to drive to this hospital and I get in my car and I'm driving a couple co-workers over there And I hit the ignition and nothing happens.

80
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:56,094
Rym: Not like digga digga digga digga, but just nothing Uh-huh, so I poke around in your car had that exploding ignition problem that you did.

81
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,258
Rym: so I'm thinking huh?

82
00:04:59,402 --> 00:05:00,652
Rym: Here's the car now on fire.

83
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:01,478
Rym: what's going on?

84
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:04,289
Rym: So I go out and I turn the lights on the batteries.

85
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,421
Rym: fine as far as I can tell and I don't have time to deal With this.

86
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:13,246
Rym: so I just get a cab to the hospital and we deal with our work and I get back and I'm gonna take The train home and I figure all right.

87
00:05:13,307 --> 00:05:13,669
Rym: Damn it.

88
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:15,539
Rym: You'll see what's wrong with my car.

89
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:18,492
Rym: There's a mechanic like a block away.

90
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,440
Rym: So I was just gonna push my car over there.

91
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,612
Rym: Yeah pushing the car and the car starts fine.

92
00:05:23,894 --> 00:05:25,520
Rym: Yeah, no problem weather.

93
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:33,629
Rym: I bet it that Betty was like the car for the last year said well actually for as long as I've owned it as I'd trouble with Rain when it's wet out.

94
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:35,279
Rym: the car just doesn't like to do things.

95
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:37,625
Rym: Thing is it's a beater.

96
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:38,750
Rym: I'm driving it into the ground.

97
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,980
Rym: I figure probably winter time ish.

98
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,003
Rym: I'm gonna buy a new car.

99
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,312
Rym: Maybe I want to hold out until next summer.

100
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:46,620
Rym: I'm really looking at a used Miata.

101
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,385
Scott: Get whatever you want.

102
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:49,650
Rym: I want a little zoomy car.

103
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:51,236
Scott: Yeah, everyone does.

104
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:56,678
Scott: Yeah They're coming out with new DeLorean's that are only gonna be like fifty nine thousand dollars.

105
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:58,022
Scott: Yeah $59,000.

106
00:05:58,022 --> 00:06:03,538
Rym: that's what I'm gonna spend on the car because I'm so flush with cash and my diamond shoes are too tight.

107
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:05,556
Scott: DeLorean It's not so much.

108
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,912
Scott: Ferrari's also coming out with a car.

109
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,583
Scott: That's only like 130.

110
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,600
Rym: I spent 10 grand on my current car and you know what?

111
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:17,600
Rym: It's it's been worth well more than 10 grand worth of driving.

112
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:22,259
Rym: I'm not spending more than 30 grand on a car unless I'm rich and I'm not rich.

113
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,592
Scott: yet They're coming out with like a half-price Ferrari.

114
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:25,800
Scott: How can ya half-price?

115
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,256
Rym: Yeah, it's like yeah 80% off this house in the Florida Keys.

116
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:32,123
Rym: Yeah All right.

117
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:34,470
Scott: Anyway, I don't see what your problem is.

118
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:34,731
Scott: Wow.

119
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,917
Rym: I guess my news turned into another leader bit.

120
00:06:37,238 --> 00:06:47,359
Rym: Okay, anyway The issue at stake that twit talked about that sent us on this tangent is the quote loudness war unquote in music.

121
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:51,600
Rym: and The heart of the issue is dynamic range compression.

122
00:06:52,462 --> 00:07:03,460
Rym: Now I got to stop you all right here because most idiots on the internet when they are compression think Oh, you mean like turning it into an mp3 or an aug or whatever and that is absolutely nothing to do with this at all.

123
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:05,040
Scott: It's a different kind of compression.

124
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,818
Scott: This is more like the compression where I squish your head than the compression where I take away your bits.

125
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:19,595
Rym: now The deal is that one different mediums especially back before digital distribution had different limitations as to how loud music could be and what dynamic range you could have.

126
00:07:19,755 --> 00:07:21,742
Rym: and a lot of people like to Say yes.

127
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:26,780
Rym: and vinyl records because they're analog have perfect dynamic range and that's a load of horseshit.

128
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:29,086
Rym: Don't even get me started about.

129
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:37,060
Scott: the dynamic range of a vinyl record is the depth of the little pits in the vinyl and not Only that but records had all sorts of special problems.

130
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:44,347
Rym: If you tried to put too much bass in there you could knock the needle out of the track And you couldn't put high-pitched things in.

131
00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:50,571
Scott: so that's why they have those lasers that read your vinyl records now instead of needles Yeah, but even then that's.

132
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:51,899
Scott: but then it's a CD.

133
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:55,591
Rym: Well, no, it's it's better and worse than a CD.

134
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:56,835
Rym: the thing does.

135
00:07:56,855 --> 00:07:58,340
Rym: there's too many issues for me to talk about.

136
00:07:58,462 --> 00:07:59,560
Scott: I know isn't it all right?

137
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,519
Rym: I'm gonna solve all of these issues up one.

138
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:12,314
Rym: Records only sound better to people who like warm audio sound and by warm audio I mean different kinds of distortion and different kinds of audio.

139
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:19,578
Rym: It's not higher fidelity The distortion just sounds better to some people mostly people who grew up listening to records.

140
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:30,160
Rym: Yes CDs sound harsh to them because the CDs in many ways more accurately Reproduced the audio and as a result, you don't get that nice distortion they had and they liked.

141
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:41,559
Rym: But anyway This issue specifically is that and it's something that talk radio and we at GeekNights do Actually more so than most radio stations do we compress the audio?

142
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:48,220
Rym: Dynamically whereby the louder our audio gets above a threshold the more it is compressed the less loud it can get.

143
00:08:48,823 --> 00:08:51,539
Rym: So up to four decibels, let's say nothing happens.

144
00:08:51,981 --> 00:09:00,300
Rym: But for every decibel above four decibels that our audio is gonna sound to you We have to get say three decibels louder.

145
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:17,800
Rym: So it decreases the dynamic range of the audio and as a result if I start yelling or if Scott and I talk at The same time or if I lean back from the microphone or anything weird happens or I talk quieter It all gets kind of smoothed out and as a result the talking you hear tends to be very uniform.

146
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:23,650
Rym: it doesn't get super loud and super quiet like pretty much every other goddamn podcast and radio show out there.

147
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:28,609
Scott: the advantage of this is that if you're in your car or In the end, you know, you can hear us.

148
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,780
Scott: if you're listening on your iPod, you can hear us.

149
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,909
Scott: You can hear every word we're saying no matter what we do and no matter what you do And that is good for a talk show.

150
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,420
Rym: if you want to hear audio that doesn't do this.

151
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:47,238
Rym: I don't want to make fun of them because I love their podcasts But listen to like any of the first 30 or 40 episodes that Dave and Joel's fast karate.

152
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:51,497
Rym: for the gentleman That is what uncompressed and unprocessed audio sounds like folks.

153
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:52,220
Rym: You don't want that.

154
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:57,479
Scott: It's very difficult to hear sometimes because it'll be so quiet and sometimes it's so loud It hurts your ears.

155
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:07,380
Scott: You know you ever listen to a podcast and the music suddenly comes in really loud a lot louder than the talking kind of like How early GeekNights was and then the talking comes in and it's too quiet and you can't hear it.

156
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,060
Scott: You have to keep adjusting your volume knobs that you can hear what's going on in the podcast.

157
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:15,035
Scott: We have a thing over here a little machine that does that.

158
00:10:15,537 --> 00:10:21,180
Rym: and then furthermore I apply many additional dynamic filters on the audio after the fact in post-production.

159
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,910
Rym: But anyway, they do the same thing in music.

160
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:30,220
Rym: and the effect the net effect of compression Is that the average volume of a song is increased?

161
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,980
Rym: Because say you can only hold I don't know 10 decibels of audio in say a CD.

162
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:38,219
Rym: I'm totally making up numbers just so you can understand this.

163
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:47,380
Rym: so a CD or a tape can hold 10 total decibels meaning the most difference between the loudest part of the audio and Silence is 10 decibels.

164
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:53,667
Rym: So say I record some audio and I got a drummer on a snare drum Just banging that snare drum every now and then.

165
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:57,220
Rym: so pak pak pak and then I got a guy kind of mumble rap.

166
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:15,220
Rym: So the snare drum is like nine decibels and the shocker own guy is like two decibels.

167
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:28,746
Rym: As a result when I do the final post-production without doing any compression The snare drum is 10 decibels and the dude talking maybe is like three or four decibels and you can't hear shit with the guys Saying and the drum hurts your ears.

168
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:32,380
Rym: Yeah, so the only way around that is to use dynamic range compression.

169
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:48,820
Rym: So as a result, the snare drum is still loud and it sounds loud but you compress the audio and as a result the shocker own guys at like seven decibels and the snare drums at like eight decibels and You do some other stuff to it and you really can't tell the difference in most situations.

170
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:55,015
Scott: Yeah I mean I like to you know Play but a lot of people that like I don't like the sound of that like the sound of that.

171
00:11:55,357 --> 00:12:05,042
Scott: get these people in some Double-blind tests or in some real-world situations where you know They'd be having to fiddle with the volume knob constantly and let's see which one they pick when they don't know What's what.

172
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:12,250
Rym: now the real issue would say because as I keep saying that the real issue would stake here the root of the issue It's the real deal, I guess there's a lot of roots.

173
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:17,150
Rym: Here's the bottom line with no more No more techno jump.

174
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,837
Rym: Oh, I got this already black.

175
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:19,640
Rym: What do you want?

176
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,285
Rym: The crux if I may.

177
00:12:22,305 --> 00:12:29,279
Rym: the issue is that as a result of people doing this, you know You can make audio sound louder.

178
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:39,800
Rym: Generally pop music and music that people listen to in the world Particularly in the United States in Europe has been dynamically compressed to the point that there is no more dynamic range.

179
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:51,040
Rym: They try to make the sound more and more apparently louder and some subgenres of music Take this one step further and try to make the bass sound super loud and all that sort of thing.

180
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:57,719
Rym: And a lot of music purists seem to be of the mind that without dynamic range Music is somehow bad.

181
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:09,666
Rym: and while I will say that dynamic range can be put to great effect and Wonderfulness in music if you're listening to music in the way that 90% of Americans are people in the world record Music recorded music.

182
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:14,587
Rym: Yeah, so you're not listening to it in a soundstage You're not listening to it on your $200.

183
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:31,240
Rym: not, you know, $10,000 audiophile bullshit headphones But like $200 absolute real monitor headphones You don't sit there in the listening room with a blindfold on listening to music and listening to the subtle Differences between the quiet part of the symphony and the loud part of the symphony.

184
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:44,700
Rym: You're listening on the train you're listening in the car You're listening with a bunch of people at a party and if you've ever tried to listen to classical music in a car It totally sucks because you have to have to turn it up whenever it's quiet and turn it down whenever it's loud

185
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:49,859
Scott: Or else you can't hear over the noise of your engine in your car, even if your car is an electric car.

186
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:50,642
Scott: So

187
00:13:51,204 --> 00:14:06,600
Rym: I guess while dynamic range can be used to great effect in music This whole loudness war is kind of BS because that is what people want and a lot of people and a lot of music players Will do this after the fact so that you can listen to music that isn't dynamically controlled.

188
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:15,129
Scott: This is why that people write programs like mp3 gain and normalize so that you you don't have to keep fiddling with your volume knob Constantly to be able to hear all your music.

189
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:17,380
Scott: It just makes all your music the same volume level.

190
00:14:17,888 --> 00:14:23,699
Scott: so and then Automatically changes the volume based on the song that happens to come up in your playlist so that you can hear it.

191
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:29,220
Rym: So the issue is just a lot more complex than the people who are so loud about this want to make it out.

192
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,467
Scott: Most of the people are allowed about.

193
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:32,599
Scott: it are crazy audio files who believe in bullshit.

194
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:36,319
Rym: anyway I think we need to get some sort of dynamic internet compression for those guys.

195
00:14:36,782 --> 00:14:37,747
Rym: Oh, I don't know.

196
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:42,003
Rym: the crazier you are the less digs you get Too bad.

197
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:43,028
Rym: It's the exact opposite.

198
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:48,507
Rym: We have some sort of crazy expander on dick right now, but I'm done with the audio analogies.

199
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:49,912
Scott: Okay today.

200
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,056
Scott: I couldn't find any news.

201
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:53,927
Scott: I can do a geek back Bringing back the geek back.

202
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:54,871
Rym: Oh the geek back.

203
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:56,378
Rym: We had a geek bite a little while ago now.

204
00:14:56,418 --> 00:15:03,880
Scott: a geek back Yep, so the fayed guy, you know th a ED whatever is that every we want people to say his name?

205
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,401
Scott: I don't know.

206
00:15:04,823 --> 00:15:09,563
Scott: He basically sent me an email and he said wait, basically like he could have done something else He could have.

207
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:10,286
Rym: he could have.

208
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,673
Scott: it's a very short email.

209
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:11,934
Scott: It could.

210
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:15,028
Scott: it could have been an instant message Oh, but it says so.

211
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:18,220
Scott: have you guys ever thought about creating a podcasting channel or network?

212
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,920
Scott: If anyone could do it you could and I'm like, okay, that's all he said.

213
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:25,376
Scott: I gave him a big little response, but I saw the response.

214
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:28,225
Scott: I think this bears Talking about on the show.

215
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:31,379
Rym: Let's start with podcast channel and then move into five.

216
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:40,165
Scott: Okay well I think the difference between a podcast channel and a podcast network is sort of hard to define because people I don't know.

217
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:41,233
Rym: Well, I think it's pretty easy.

218
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:48,309
Rym: a Podcast channel is either, you know some sort of cross syndication with feed so you can subscribe to one feed.

219
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,258
Rym: that's just got all the different stuff the different people do like.

220
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:52,544
Rym: if there's Yeah,

221
00:15:52,624 --> 00:16:08,279
Scott: if you're gonna make it a direct to television analogy then yes That would be a channel where you you'd program some sort of podcast, you know You take a feed and we would choose podcasts to go into the feed thus creating a larger feed of programming Which is what a TV channel is.

222
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:14,725
Rym: And I think the only other thing a podcast channel could be is just some sort of live streaming screaming Streaming.

223
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:25,145
Rym: I said a bunch of words that weren't the word Yeah, you did but some sort of live streaming thing which as we talked about recently is really dumb I don't think that's what I say.

224
00:16:25,507 --> 00:16:32,012
Scott: or a podcast network, which depending on what you think about podcast network There are a lot of existing podcast network.

225
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:33,299
Scott: Like for example, it network.

226
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,780
Scott: Well, it's sort of different than the others but like the sci-fi podcast network or the comic podcast network or one of those, right?

227
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,652
Rym: Then there's those loose affiliations or I mean These are.

228
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:47,538
Scott: is that basically a bunch of people who already have their separate podcasts, right?

229
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:48,400
Scott: They're completely unreal.

230
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:53,760
Scott: They're not unrelated podcasts, but they're podcasts on the same thing like a pseudopod and escape pod.

231
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,860
Scott: Well, no, like look at the comics podcast network, right?

232
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,260
Scott: Okay, every podcast and the comms podcast network is made by someone different somewhere else in the world.

233
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,409
Scott: They don't like work together.

234
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:04,951
Scott: Really.

235
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:05,896
Scott: There's no like that.

236
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:12,849
Scott: You know, they're they're friends I guess on the internet, but they're not you know friends in real life Or at least they weren't friends in real life before.

237
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:14,960
Scott: they don't produce their shows together.

238
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:30,779
Scott: they just have an affiliation under a common label and the fact is that some of the individual podcasts under that label are actually bigger than the label itself and I really don't see the point of Grouping a bunch of podcasts under a label like this.

239
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:46,040
Rym: the only rate reason you would ever do that is if in your group of friends or Just group of podcasters or whatever that may or may not have been formed directly by you One is really popular and the rest aren't and you want to make the rest popular and have them tag along on your coattails.

240
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:57,109
Scott: Yeah, and I really I think that's kind of a dumb idea because the way to get more listeners for your podcast is to be Like Nintendo and get people who aren't listening to pod the blue ocean.

241
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,396
Scott: people are already listening to podcasts.

242
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:01,712
Scott: if they're gonna find you They'll find you.

243
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,479
Rym: don't worry In fact, I know how it works.

244
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:17,540
Rym: This is kind of a big indictment against a lot of our podcast friends because I'll be very blunt Most of the friend podcasters we have are very incestuous in terms of Podcasting and they all cross promote each other and they all play like when we went to Otakon, right?

245
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,860
Rym: We did a podcasting panel that a bunch of people recorded.

246
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:26,426
Rym: Every one of the podcasters we know put the exact same audio from the same panel up in their show Except us.

247
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:33,820
Rym: obviously we actually gave The Ninja Consultants five the best recording of that thing because we gave them our recording that we didn't actually use for anything.

248
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:34,442
Scott: Yeah

249
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:36,387
Rym: from the fancy-pants Marines,

250
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:51,780
Scott: but you know, they're all promo each other and stuff and it's sort of like Podcasters associate with each other for no other reason than other to share listeners And I don't know how many listeners actually get shared because of these networks, but I imagine it's not making a significant difference.

251
00:18:51,941 --> 00:18:57,060
Scott: Well, all except for the really small podcast that attaches on to the really big one gets a good head start.

252
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:58,200
Scott: But that's about it in the end.

253
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:10,220
Rym: All it does is eventually I see a lot of listeners seem to consolidate Like they'll start listening to a bunch of shows because of you know cross-promotion But then they end up only listening to one or two of the original ones that cross-promote and just stop listening to the rest.

254
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:10,474
Rym: Yeah

255
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:24,830
Scott: I think in the end the only kind of podcast network that's good is one like to it because to it is different in that All it to it is a lot more like GeekNights in which we have like four different podcasts We do effectively and to it has like 10.

256
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,514
Scott: Yeah, they got like.

257
00:19:26,835 --> 00:19:28,380
Scott: there's the headline show to it.

258
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:35,227
Scott: But then there's like the free open-source one and the law one and but they're all Twit shows made by twit.

259
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:37,274
Scott: Leo Laporte has something to do with all of them.

260
00:19:37,294 --> 00:19:38,840
Scott: They're all made by twit.

261
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,696
Scott: It's not like all these people making separate shows and slapping a twit label on them.

262
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:46,186
Scott: They're actually all Produced by the same crew.

263
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:50,020
Rym: basically now if there was anything like that that we would do that is it?

264
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:57,420
Scott: Yeah, and I mean we're doing that already as far as I'm concerned The only thing we're not nice is for podcasts and twit is a lot more than for the only reason we don't do more.

265
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,260
Rym: It's just a lack of time because we both have day jobs.

266
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:09,899
Rym: Imagine if I didn't have a job I could just make like two podcasts every day and I could see in the future Especially like if we had as many listeners as twit, I can guarantee there'd be a lot more GeekNights out there.

267
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:11,427
Scott: There sure would be.

268
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:15,490
Rym: I mean if my job were to do this eight hours a day I'd probably do it 12 hours a day.

269
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,000
Scott: I don't know if I do it 12 hours.

270
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:21,386
Rym: Well by doing I mean not just talking for 12 hours a day But 12 hours worth of stuff.

271
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:25,038
Rym: because remember playing video games counts as working on GeekNights.

272
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:25,580
Scott: Awesome.

273
00:20:26,022 --> 00:20:29,400
Rym: So does playing D&D playing board games watching anime?

274
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:31,649
Scott: I guess the point is is that I think

275
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,131
Rym: that

276
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:41,143
Scott: podcast networks as they stand today Most of them are pretty stupid and pointless and I think they're kind of lame and I don't really want to have anything to do With any of

277
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:44,179
Rym: notice that we stopped playing promos pretty much right away.

278
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:48,196
Scott: Yeah, we played promos because other people were doing it and then we realized why we doing this.

279
00:20:48,216 --> 00:20:49,300
Scott: Jesus other people are doing it.

280
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:49,871
Scott: It's stupid.

281
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:53,269
Rym: Yep It doesn't help that all promos are bad including ours.

282
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:59,708
Scott: if you're gonna make a net some sort of label to apply to multiple Separate podcasts that label should have some meaning.

283
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:04,020
Scott: other than we all talk about similar things or we all like each other.

284
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:14,640
Rym: Yep I mean Like these shows are all produced in the same studio Like we have the GeekNights experimental feed which in the winter or early fall is gonna start seeing a lot more use.

285
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,028
Scott: It should see some use pretty soon.

286
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:17,939
Rym: I think they will but it's gonna see a lot more use.

287
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:19,726
Scott: Mostly our lips in limitation.

288
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:20,971
Scott: It's not seen more use.

289
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:23,260
Rym: Yeah that and we have actually been really busy lately.

290
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:36,273
Rym: Yep, but I could see us expanding with a couple more hosts and more shows and that sort of thing And I could see the front row crew as a whole busting out But I don't see many of our front row crew friends actually podcasting.

291
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:38,700
Rym: No, at least not unless they podcast through us.

292
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:43,620
Scott: Yeah, oh well podcast networks and kind of lame very lame.

293
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:56,250
Rym: So things of the day whatever screwing around we seem to be doing with geek bites and geek backs and newses.

294
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,742
Rym: I think the things of the day are gonna stay.

295
00:21:57,782 --> 00:21:58,689
Rym: everyone seems to like him.

296
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,209
Scott: Yeah Can't get rid of the thing of the day.

297
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,835
Rym: I mean I'm gonna be quick about this.

298
00:22:02,935 --> 00:22:08,804
Rym: cuz all I hate to do everything I do is on dig and if I don't if it's not On dig it's on dig by the time I do the show.

299
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:09,570
Rym: so I stopped caring.

300
00:22:10,152 --> 00:22:12,860
Rym: This is a little old but a little old meaning a couple days ago.

301
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,725
Rym: It's a comedy sketch.

302
00:22:14,786 --> 00:22:19,140
Rym: It's either Australian or British and It's about the front falling off.

303
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,849
Rym: and I don't want to say anymore just watch it.

304
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:28,170
Scott: It's really Monty Python esque and really it's not Monty Python, but it is very much like Monty Python.

305
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,810
Rym: The thing is it's that whole kind of very witty very dry style of British humor.

306
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,501
Rym: It's it had a little bit of the pell you.

307
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:35,709
Rym: well, well the fun fell off.

308
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:38,675
Rym: Yes, right, right.

309
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:39,317
Scott: Yep.

310
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:41,182
Rym: Anyway, that's all I thought it was funny.

311
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:43,689
Scott: Here's another funny thing I found here.

312
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,904
Scott: Basically you ever seen the Street Fighter live-action movie in the US actually know that my mom did.

313
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:50,847
Scott: Oh, I saw it.

314
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:59,598
Rym: Anyway, it's My mom really liked the Mortal Kombat movie Mortal Kombat movies a lot better than the Street Fighter movie But she kept trying to like hide it.

315
00:22:59,618 --> 00:23:05,499
Rym: She always be like, yeah, I just like it for the special effects But she totally just dug that movie.

316
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:07,004
Scott: It wasn't as that bad.

317
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:08,950
Scott: It was bad, but not as bad as Street Fighter movie.

318
00:23:09,031 --> 00:23:17,846
Scott: Anyway, Korea at one point South Korea I assume tried to make a Street Fighter movie as well Street Fighter 2 movie.

319
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:19,150
Scott: Actually that was live-action.

320
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,285
Rym: All right, is this better or worse than all those like Filipino spider-man movies?

321
00:23:23,305 --> 00:23:24,530
Scott: I don't know.

322
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,430
Scott: Why don't you watch this eight minutes of live-action footage and decide for yourself?

323
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:33,208
Scott: The best part of this is just watching all the character introductions at the beginning.

324
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,093
Scott: Zangief priceless Priceless.

325
00:23:37,113 --> 00:23:44,877
Rym: you say it's a priceless Zangief because I know what Zangief looks like and I mean, I know exactly what a Korean guy Dressing up as Zangief.

326
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,190
Rym: I can't imagine that that's impossible.

327
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,896
Scott: Well, I'm gonna show it to you after the shows.

328
00:23:48,956 --> 00:23:57,290
Rym: that is there is no way a person of Korean descent Full-blooded Korean descent could look anything like Zangief.

329
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:03,127
Scott: well, we'll watch this when the show's over and everyone else listening will watch it also and be entertained.

330
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:06,829
Rym: I mean the College humor has a perfect Zangief.

331
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:14,700
Scott: Oh not that hard to find a guy like that Street Fighter at the later years on college humor is like the hot shit I hope they finish making as far as I'm concerned.

332
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,750
Rym: That is the live-action Street Fighter movie.

333
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:17,574
Scott: Oh there it.

334
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:21,233
Scott: of course definitely but this is uh So is this?

335
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:34,050
Rym: this is interesting in the same way that Japanese spider-man who put my claws in the sink, you know You can't do the gonna rise Right, so, uh, if you haven't noticed Scott and I are a little bit jaded about a lot of things.

336
00:24:34,572 --> 00:24:40,095
Rym: Jaded like Jade monkey but jaded like, you know That doesn't work because you can't.

337
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:42,723
Rym: something can't be jaded in the same way that it's bronze.

338
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:48,720
Rym: You can't coat something in jade very easily No, but yeah, what I don't know.

339
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:51,570
Scott: I was just trying to make fun of the the material Jade

340
00:24:51,911 --> 00:24:56,085
Rym: I know I really like Jade though because it protects you from the what's-it-in-uh,

341
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:57,048
Scott: it doesn't protect you

342
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,228
Rym: l5r

343
00:24:57,891 --> 00:24:58,634
Scott: It doesn't protect you

344
00:24:58,754 --> 00:25:02,974
Rym: know in l5r if you're out into those accursed lands for the only and everything Are you better?

345
00:25:03,014 --> 00:25:04,549
Rym: had you best have some Jade on you?

346
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,824
Scott: I guess Jade and l5r is sort of like cold iron with our demons.

347
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,350
Scott: and yeah granted captain.

348
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:12,600
Rym: Oh, so that's the kaiju wall.

349
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,450
Rym: Eh, I go outside and roll around in the dirt.

350
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:18,982
Scott: The setting was not thoroughly explained enough to me.

351
00:25:19,424 --> 00:25:24,224
Rym: So rather setting All right wall a cursed land beyond the wall.

352
00:25:24,545 --> 00:25:25,449
Rym: Don't go out there.

353
00:25:26,032 --> 00:25:29,714
Scott: Okay, I go on right around in the door because I was like exactly how you know Where it's like.

354
00:25:29,754 --> 00:25:30,781
Scott: I look over the edge of the wall.

355
00:25:30,882 --> 00:25:32,090
Scott: Is it a curse it down there?

356
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,039
Scott: I'm like how far away is the accursed miss?

357
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:35,104
Rym: They're like how a curse it.

358
00:25:35,164 --> 00:25:35,325
Rym: is it?

359
00:25:35,385 --> 00:25:36,430
Rym: on a scale of one to ten?

360
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,033
Scott: Yeah, I was.

361
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:38,790
Scott: I was trying to curse is gonna get on.

362
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:44,433
Scott: I was trying to get a complete picture of what evil would lurk beyond the wall and it wasn't offered to me out of Characters.

363
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:48,360
Scott: so I had to go in character and find out What if I eat the dirt?

364
00:25:48,562 --> 00:25:49,350
Rym: is the dirt cursed?

365
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,130
Rym: What if I only eat like a handful of dirt when I just lick a lick a rock or something?

366
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:54,178
Rym: What's that gonna do?

367
00:25:54,522 --> 00:25:55,190
Scott: That's what I did.

368
00:25:55,431 --> 00:25:56,815
Scott: Anyway, I'm fine ninja for the win.

369
00:25:57,297 --> 00:26:05,770
Rym: I do want to preface this by saying that however jaded I may be Scott is entirely immune to the accursed effects beyond the kaiju wall.

370
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:11,894
Rym: Scott is made of Jade Scott that I could say that 80% of the time.

371
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:20,397
Rym: with no exaggeration if I say anything to Scott his response will range from Nothing to yeah.

372
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:28,583
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty good as far as I go and I'm talking things like oh my god Scott Russia just invaded Britain and they nuke France and Scott.

373
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:30,009
Rym: to be like it doesn't affect me.

374
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:32,510
Scott: yet Yeah, I don't know what happened.

375
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:38,070
Scott: I mean, I know I wasn't always this way and I know I am this way.

376
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:46,017
Rym: But yet you get super excited about the stupidest little things like what like I remember back We were watching Ozamanga died.

377
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,123
Rym: You'd sit there like oh shit.

378
00:26:47,203 --> 00:26:47,545
Scott: Oh shit.

379
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,756
Scott: I was like, oh my god I was a while ago.

380
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:52,342
Scott: Wasn't that long hated then?

381
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:53,125
Scott: that was years ago.

382
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:56,499
Scott: That was like four years ago Not even long time four years.

383
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:58,850
Rym: you sat and watched that screen saver.

384
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,659
Rym: There was nothing more than an Osaka.

385
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,469
Scott: That was like four years ago.

386
00:27:03,074 --> 00:27:04,569
Rym: It wasn't that long ago long ago.

387
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:21,850
Scott: but I think it's mostly in the past two years ish that I've been super jaded where I Just go on the stupid RSS feeds and I see so much shit every day Constantly that it takes so much to make me get any sort of reaction.

388
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,025
Scott: I mean, it's like if I sit there watching coat see for a whole day.

389
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:25,769
Scott: What are you gonna show me?

390
00:27:26,051 --> 00:27:27,930
Scott: That's gonna make me go and nothing.

391
00:27:28,131 --> 00:27:38,039
Rym: yeah, see there's a secondary issue that actually Jess and a few other people brought up when we were talking about this exact same thing when Everyone in the crew except Scott went mountain climbing.

392
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:38,842
Rym: Yep.

393
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:39,685
Rym: Well rock climbing.

394
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:40,588
Rym: It wasn't actually a mountain.

395
00:27:40,628 --> 00:27:41,150
Rym: It was a hill.

396
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:48,290
Rym: I'm not gonna pretend that breakneck rage is a mountain but nonetheless We were rock climbing and we were talking about how jaded Scott is and an issue came up.

397
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,375
Rym: But I'll get to that at the end.

398
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:55,630
Rym: Let's focus just on the internet right now Because People send us things of the day all the time.

399
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:01,828
Rym: It seems like ever since we started saying who sent us a thing of the day We get so many emails of oh my god, check this out.

400
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:02,793
Rym: Oh my god Check this out.

401
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,390
Scott: and I'd say about 75% of them are things I've already seen.

402
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:19,707
Scott: 15% of the rest are things that are just man and then the remainder some people actually do send us things We haven't seen that are awesome there what it really comes down to on the internet as opposed to maybe other issues.

403
00:28:19,768 --> 00:28:32,170
Rym: It's just that We've seen a lot on the internet and I've already seen a video of a guy putting on a banana suit and then lighting it On fire and then saying that was a bad idea in front of the camera after the fact after he was horribly burned.

404
00:28:32,372 --> 00:28:40,374
Scott: So when I watched the video of an idiot You know lighting a train track on fire then lighting his jeans on fire with gasoline from the train Or to just break

405
00:28:40,415 --> 00:28:47,050
Rym: that up any video of someone doing something really stupid I just I've already seen a video of someone doing the stupidest thing.

406
00:28:47,572 --> 00:28:52,770
Rym: They're all just really the same thing and I'm not yeah, it's like you watch this owned compilation.

407
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:56,270
Scott: It's like every like a hundred owned videos just tied together.

408
00:28:56,973 --> 00:28:59,564
Scott: How are you possibly gonna show me another owned video?

409
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:02,537
Rym: I already saw a guy Parasail into a cliff.

410
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,910
Rym: I've seen that there's nothing worse that I could see in Paris.

411
00:29:06,342 --> 00:29:13,537
Rym: All right If a shark jumped out of the water and grabbed a guy in the air who was parasailing That would make me go.

412
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:19,499
Rym: I would I would take pause at that for a second maybe but then Once you've seen that the shark jumped the guy it's over.

413
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,790
Scott: but I mean once you've seen that video though, what's next?

414
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,847
Scott: I mean the guy is diving into the water and eat coming out with the shark.

415
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:32,670
Rym: now I don't just want not just owned videos That was just the example that came to mind but anything like flash animations.

416
00:29:33,352 --> 00:29:43,627
Rym: I have seen some of the most amazing animations online and in film festivals and everything and 99% of the stuff on the internet is crab flash whatever that I've seen.

417
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:47,500
Scott: a million things better Even even things that aren't in the internet.

418
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,286
Scott: anime back in the day.

419
00:29:49,466 --> 00:29:50,590
Scott: There wasn't so much anime.

420
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:51,478
Scott: It was hard to get.

421
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,730
Scott: I didn't see a lot of it.

422
00:29:52,750 --> 00:30:00,862
Scott: Well, not only though even a bad anime was awesome because it's like oh my god an anime Holy shit, and it didn't matter to me what it was.

423
00:30:00,902 --> 00:30:01,666
Scott: It was an anime.

424
00:30:01,706 --> 00:30:02,390
Scott: That's all that mattered.

425
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:05,848
Scott: Yeah, I mean I watch so much anime that it's like wow, it's crap.

426
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:06,230
Scott: That's crap.

427
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,510
Scott: That's crap because I've seen the best of the best of the best.

428
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:17,990
Scott: So if you don't show me something that's on that level I mean you might show me something that's pretty damn good like a but I've seen 30 a plus anime.

429
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:30,113
Scott: So compared to those your anime have no chance your B Anime has no chance and your a anime is only gonna get watched if I'm really bored and I have this mountain of a plus Stuff to look at.

430
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,501
Scott: the a stuff just isn't gonna happen people.

431
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:34,548
Scott: I'm too busy with my life.

432
00:30:34,588 --> 00:30:35,995
Scott: I got to go to work I got to eat.

433
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:37,223
Scott: I got a do laundry.

434
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:38,170
Scott: I got to make a podcast.

435
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:41,843
Rym: It's like when I was a kid, I watched Tenchi Muyo and I love that show.

436
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,950
Rym: that show was just so funny and so clever.

437
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,624
Scott: I didn't like it even then but and so original and I thought it was great.

438
00:30:47,685 --> 00:30:48,387
Rym: It was hilarious.

439
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:52,388
Rym: I love the character I love the movies and hey the original OAV has a lot of charm.

440
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:54,496
Scott: You got what you want to call it.

441
00:30:54,516 --> 00:30:55,720
Rym: Have you seen the OA?

442
00:30:55,761 --> 00:30:55,961
Rym: what?

443
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:56,423
Rym: what Tenchi?

444
00:30:56,443 --> 00:30:58,089
Scott: have you seen the Cartoon Network?

445
00:30:58,169 --> 00:30:58,390
Scott: random?

446
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,654
Rym: Whatever random whatever?

447
00:30:59,694 --> 00:30:59,915
Rym: what?

448
00:30:59,955 --> 00:31:02,262
Rym: because there's the original OAV and there's the.

449
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,970
Scott: I think I saw some episode where there was swimsuits.

450
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:05,775
Scott: It was obligatory.

451
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:12,060
Rym: So that doesn't narrow it down, but suffice to say Yeah, I've seen like a hundred anime since then.

452
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:14,365
Rym: that are the same kind of harem show whatever.

453
00:31:14,426 --> 00:31:18,956
Rym: but not only are they all Just oh, I've seen a harem show I don't need to see another one.

454
00:31:19,297 --> 00:31:27,438
Rym: and not only did none of them bring even one original thing to the table but they all were not as good as Tenchi like just not.

455
00:31:27,498 --> 00:31:29,087
Rym: it's not just oh, it's just the same thing.

456
00:31:29,147 --> 00:31:30,594
Rym: over again It was the same thing.

457
00:31:30,634 --> 00:31:32,382
Scott: does that perhaps nostalgia?

458
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:36,683
Rym: No, you're like no good God If you watch love Hina that show.

459
00:31:36,743 --> 00:31:41,367
Scott: I watched all of love He actually enough because back in the day before it was jaded.

460
00:31:41,387 --> 00:31:41,990
Scott: you were stupid.

461
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:51,338
Scott: I downloaded all of love Hina because we watched episodes of it at anime club where every anime appears better than it is and everyone Was laughing their heads off after four episodes.

462
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,044
Scott: So I downloaded the rest.

463
00:31:53,426 --> 00:31:54,550
Scott: went home over the summer.

464
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:56,590
Scott: There was no RIT internet connection.

465
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,710
Scott: There's just a 56 56 K modem and I watched all of love Hina goes nothing else to do that.

466
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:05,586
Rym: I can't make fun of you because what granted love Hina by the third episode.

467
00:32:05,606 --> 00:32:07,454
Rym: I realized wait a minute They haven't.

468
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:08,739
Rym: it was like a Garfield comic.

469
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,590
Rym: They haven't made a new joke in several episodes pretty much.

470
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,738
Scott: But did you?

471
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:13,846
Scott: you watched all of Sailor Moon's.

472
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:14,269
Scott: he can't talk.

473
00:32:14,731 --> 00:32:24,647
Rym: oh, no, I wasn't gonna make fun of that when I was living in the mountains with no internet and no cell phone and Nothing to do and I'd read every book I owned and I was buying but I had nothing to do.

474
00:32:24,707 --> 00:32:33,303
Rym: and I was bored Super bored like I come home from work and I'd run for a couple hours and then I'd like make dinner And then I still had four more hours to kill.

475
00:32:33,323 --> 00:32:42,268
Rym: I watched all of read or die TV and And I watched like 12 episodes of monster and monsters.

476
00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:43,353
Rym: good though It was okay.

477
00:32:43,373 --> 00:32:45,945
Rym: The the manga is so much better that the anime I just can't stand.

478
00:32:45,985 --> 00:32:48,564
Scott: how much of the manga if you read like one issue.

479
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:50,833
Rym: I Got two volume.

480
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:52,177
Rym: I didn't like the anime.

481
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:53,642
Rym: It just it did it.

482
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:55,910
Rym: The pacing was really bad in my opinion.

483
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:00,245
Rym: All right I really watched enough the anime to say I like the first four or five.

484
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:01,430
Rym: then it just really started going down.

485
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,417
Rym: but Read or die TV was crap.

486
00:33:04,457 --> 00:33:08,170
Rym: And then I watched about 17 episodes of brother dear brother.

487
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,750
Rym: And then finally I realized all right, this is crap.

488
00:33:12,851 --> 00:33:14,667
Rym: I watched the last two and it was worth it.

489
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,400
Scott: But here's an example of how I am jaded.

490
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,724
Scott: if you still can't understand right?

491
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:21,690
Scott: I think look at movies, right?

492
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,319
Scott: I haven't been to the movie theater in forever.

493
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:27,250
Rym: No, we went once but we want to see paprika recently.

494
00:33:27,432 --> 00:33:37,059
Scott: oh, yeah, that that's different but I Since before paprika before I went to see that I was not excited about a single movie since Lord of the Rings.

495
00:33:37,361 --> 00:33:42,943
Scott: all three of them, right and Every time people would start yapping about oh, let's go see this movie all this.

496
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,614
Scott: even today people say oh this movie's great You got to go see it.

497
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:46,580
Scott: Oh this movie, right?

498
00:33:46,963 --> 00:33:49,976
Scott: First of all, I got Netflix All right so I don't got time for your movie theater.

499
00:33:50,297 --> 00:33:55,388
Scott: and second of all I think back and I think of Lord of the Rings and Paprika and I'm like, huh?

500
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:56,778
Scott: It's moot and like.

501
00:33:56,939 --> 00:33:58,349
Scott: is this movie Lord of the Rings level?

502
00:33:58,951 --> 00:34:06,030
Rym: But Scott as a whatever you uh, you miss some pretty damn good movies like but they're not a plus the Sean of the Dead.

503
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:08,641
Scott: But just I didn't miss that because I wasn't excited by.

504
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:10,530
Scott: I missed that just because I missed it, you know.

505
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:16,498
Scott: But you know even good movies that are out now They're they're not Lord of the Rings level.

506
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:19,510
Scott: so I don't pay attention or get excited or really care.

507
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,489
Scott: And I'll catch him like two years later on Netflix.

508
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:21,811
Scott: Well,

509
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:31,549
Rym: the root crux bottom whatever of the issue here is just that with the internet and all other media when we're talking just about consumable entertaining media

510
00:34:32,313 --> 00:34:32,975
Scott: There is more

511
00:34:33,076 --> 00:34:41,516
Rym: media being created than I can peruse Even if I spent 24 hours a day seven days a week watching it reading it Whatever.

512
00:34:42,065 --> 00:34:46,922
Rym: as a result I have to be choosy not to mention the fact that there's all of the media.

513
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:55,790
Rym: that has been created and preserved throughout the history of Humanity that's been stacked up and between all is now becoming more and more easily available where it used to be.

514
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,255
Rym: Not like I like.

515
00:34:57,396 --> 00:35:05,284
Rym: I have easily a hundred to two hundred books that I own That I haven't read and I really really want to write it on 200 books.

516
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:05,866
Scott: I haven't read.

517
00:35:06,107 --> 00:35:08,437
Scott: Yeah, I Own like maybe 20 books.

518
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:09,020
Scott: I haven't read.

519
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,316
Scott: Are you afraid I can tell you exactly how many books I own that I haven't read?

520
00:35:12,457 --> 00:35:35,277
Rym: not only do I have stacks and stacks of unread books But my book collection is still in Arizona with my mom and I haven't read even half of those books and I wanted to read All of them and I think I still do so it gets to the point where I sit there and I look at all my books And I have to pick one of them to read and as a result I'm never gonna get to the books that don't immediately say Rym You have to read them

521
00:35:35,438 --> 00:35:37,069
Scott: until I'm a retired old man.

522
00:35:37,491 --> 00:35:42,230
Scott: A lot of stuff is just gonna go unwatched unread unseen on whatever.

523
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,539
Rym: That's one benefit of the modern culture.

524
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,274
Rym: as long as I somehow have enough money to retire Retirement doesn't seem as bad.

525
00:35:49,295 --> 00:35:55,234
Rym: I mean I see a lot of people I know retired and grandparents of people who really lead boring like they.

526
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:59,428
Rym: just they don't do anything anymore and they sit around kind of bored all the time or watching TV or whatever.

527
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,650
Rym: and I know there's exceptions.

528
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,984
Rym: But I see a lot of people like this and I have enough entertainment.

529
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:04,365
Rym: now.

530
00:36:04,526 --> 00:36:16,709
Rym: if no new Entertainment were created for the rest of my life I think there is enough entertainment in the world to keep me up until the age of 90 retired and Perfectly content and have something to do at all hours.

531
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:19,558
Scott: Yeah, I think that's a scary thought.

532
00:36:19,598 --> 00:36:23,091
Rym: that means that I'm not gonna be able to read most of the books that I want to Read.

533
00:36:23,393 --> 00:36:25,162
Rym: I'm not gonna be able to watch most of the movies.

534
00:36:25,222 --> 00:36:25,745
Rym: I want to watch.

535
00:36:26,006 --> 00:36:26,690
Rym: there's no way in hell.

536
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,797
Rym: I'm gonna play all the video games.

537
00:36:27,817 --> 00:36:40,950
Scott: I want to play and hence Jadedness while it sucks because there are a lot of things that are quite enjoyable that for some reason I'm just not enjoying and other people think it's weird like, uh, why aren't you you know?

538
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,143
Scott: Loving up this movie that everyone loves so much.

539
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:50,090
Scott: It's not cuz it's bad It's just because I mean it if you eat steak every day and you eat it every day.

540
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,002
Scott: Eventually steak becomes not so interesting anymore.

541
00:36:53,063 --> 00:36:58,530
Scott: But then when you go to eat a hamburger It doesn't taste so it tastes bad even worse than the steak.

542
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:00,398
Scott: It's sort of like being addicted to heroin.

543
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,974
Scott: and then you just need you know, if you go down to like morphine It doesn't do shit.

544
00:37:03,994 --> 00:37:06,890
Scott: Nah, but actually more heroin doesn't help you either.

545
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:10,627
Scott: You need something bigger and badder all the time and eventually run out.

546
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:15,730
Rym: Emily was making fun of us just a little while ago out there like oh you guys you lead the good life.

547
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,956
Rym: And now you can't understand the simple pleasures.

548
00:37:18,056 --> 00:37:22,810
Rym: and it reminded me of a somewhat sad anecdote that happened not too long ago.

549
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,253
Scott: All right Tell you sad anecdote.

550
00:37:24,293 --> 00:37:33,664
Rym: well Scott and myself and a small portion of the front row crew went to try out a hibachi sushi Whatever chain called Izumi that opened a branch right near our house.

551
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:40,460
Rym: All right, so we thought oh great We don't have to drive up the road to the neko anymore, even though I really like the neko We'll check this place out and it was kind of mad.

552
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:41,223
Scott: It was okay.

553
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:42,107
Scott: It wasn't the greatest.

554
00:37:42,188 --> 00:37:42,690
Scott: It wasn't the worst.

555
00:37:42,852 --> 00:37:44,330
Rym: I would rather drive up the road to the neck.

556
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,300
Scott: Oh, I agree that I would rather drive up to the road to the neck Oh, but it wasn't like bad like.

557
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:55,940
Rym: ah bad about you don't go there It was just this better but there weren't enough of us to get a whole table So we ended up sharing a table with this couple and whatever.

558
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,265
Rym: We're just talking and they're just talking.

559
00:37:57,285 --> 00:38:11,472
Rym: and I think we related a whole other story about how our conversation was crippled by the fact that they weren't really geeky and Almost everything we said weirded them out and they just couldn't deal with it and they kept talking to us and it kind of ruined Our dinner.

560
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:21,967
Rym: Yeah, I didn't want I really don't want strangers talking to me while I don't mind strangers talking to me But they could not engage us in any conversation that we wanted to have and they just kept.

561
00:38:22,408 --> 00:38:22,950
Rym: it was weird.

562
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,958
Rym: But anyway, so we're just talking.

563
00:38:24,978 --> 00:38:29,998
Rym: I'm looking at the menu and one thing this place has is you can't lobster In your hibachi.

564
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,498
Scott: Yeah, the neko does not offer that surprisingly enough Yeah, but I'm looking I'm thinking and I say to myself.

565
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:37,263
Rym: Oh, man lobster.

566
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:41,927
Rym: I'm all about that, but I just had lobster yesterday So maybe I shouldn't have lobster two nights in a row.

567
00:38:43,732 --> 00:38:44,795
Rym: Then those people turn to us.

568
00:38:44,815 --> 00:38:47,343
Rym: they're like, wow, aren't you guys the fancy spenders?

569
00:38:47,424 --> 00:38:48,246
Rym: la di da?

570
00:38:48,788 --> 00:38:49,269
Scott: and I'm like.

571
00:38:50,072 --> 00:38:51,355
Rym: And I'm like, whoa.

572
00:38:51,816 --> 00:38:54,182
Rym: Yeah, I did just have lobster.

573
00:38:54,443 --> 00:38:58,611
Scott: But you look at the menu the lobsters like $15.

574
00:38:58,611 --> 00:38:59,213
Scott: It's not like.

575
00:38:59,393 --> 00:39:01,100
Scott: it's not like it's some $50 deal.

576
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,645
Scott: It's it's 15 bucks.

577
00:39:02,906 --> 00:39:03,327
Scott: Whatever.

578
00:39:03,669 --> 00:39:04,050
Scott: How is it?

579
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,850
Rym: So I kind of notice this in my life and it's not a matter of money.

580
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:09,463
Rym: It's just like because I used to really like eating at diners.

581
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:13,421
Rym: I used to eat them all the time But now we don't eat out so often.

582
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:14,766
Rym: So when will other than lunches?

583
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:15,570
Rym: so when do I eat out?

584
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:19,020
Rym: I always want to go to like the best possible restaurant at the time.

585
00:39:19,502 --> 00:39:20,887
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

586
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:24,219
Rym: so as a result I don't go to the diner anymore Even though I really like the diner.

587
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,260
Rym: just if I'm gonna eat out I'd rather go to the cafe Maya.

588
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:27,743
Scott: I know it's.

589
00:39:27,763 --> 00:39:30,955
Scott: I go to the cafe Maya I go to the Chipotle.

590
00:39:31,317 --> 00:39:34,970
Scott: So what's the point of you know, Joe's Tex Mex?

591
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,172
Scott: Whatever.

592
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:37,537
Rym: I got Cafe Maya.

593
00:39:37,557 --> 00:39:39,123
Scott: Joe's Tex Mex doesn't mean shit for me.

594
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,970
Rym: The thing is it's weird cuz I can still eat Taco Bell.

595
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,853
Rym: I fucking love Taco Bell.

596
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:43,380
Scott: I can't eat any fast food.

597
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:43,741
Scott: Really.

598
00:39:43,861 --> 00:39:47,213
Scott: I eat it like when necessary and that's about it Taco Bell in White Castle.

599
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:48,858
Scott: I always get like some piece of chicken.

600
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:50,041
Scott: That's horrible.

601
00:39:50,302 --> 00:39:51,305
Rym: So see, I'm not.

602
00:39:51,706 --> 00:39:54,776
Rym: I'm not jaded about fast food It's more that I see.

603
00:39:54,796 --> 00:39:55,840
Rym: I think there's a jaded.

604
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,970
Rym: we can't talk about it in such simple terms because People say someone's jaded about something and there's a whole slew of different reasons.

605
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:07,790
Rym: A person could have lost interest in something that has nothing to do with just he's so jaded.

606
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:11,741
Rym: He doesn't care doesn't give a carrot all about the world anymore blah blah.

607
00:40:12,142 --> 00:40:13,827
Scott: Yeah, it's very difficult to tell.

608
00:40:13,907 --> 00:40:17,566
Scott: sometimes also It's like I used to like that thing and now I don't.

609
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:18,169
Scott: why is it?

610
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:18,752
Scott: You know, is it?

611
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:23,090
Scott: am I not interested in movies anymore because DVDs and bit torrent?

612
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:27,124
Scott: Or is it actually because I'm jaded from seeing a zillion awesome to me.

613
00:40:27,285 --> 00:40:28,650
Rym: I can do the movies thing very simply.

614
00:40:29,072 --> 00:40:32,550
Rym: It's just time because I love watching movies.

615
00:40:32,811 --> 00:40:36,804
Rym: I remember before we did GeekNights when we just lived in this house with our.

616
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:40,275
Rym: we had all this money and all this free Time and nothing to do.

617
00:40:40,877 --> 00:40:42,702
Rym: we watch like every night.

618
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:43,485
Rym: We watched a movie.

619
00:40:43,826 --> 00:40:46,078
Rym: Yeah, almost every single night We were Netflix.

620
00:40:46,098 --> 00:40:46,542
Scott: send it back.

621
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:47,350
Scott: Netflix send it back.

622
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:51,070
Rym: Not only that but we were buying box sets like we bought a box set of old Hitchcock.

623
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:53,000
Scott: But it's not just not watching movies.

624
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:58,290
Scott: It's that you know, people will bring up movies They'll start talking about them and I'm just completely uninterested whatsoever.

625
00:40:59,112 --> 00:41:01,570
Rym: Well, it's not so much movies that people bring that it's TV shows.

626
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,721
Rym: A lot of our friends watch TV and they're

627
00:41:03,822 --> 00:41:12,738
Scott: always TV shows, you know I am somewhat interested in TV shows but only on DVD and I don't really care about them on television even though some of them might be good, but well,

628
00:41:12,778 --> 00:41:14,002
Rym: they try to get the yell at us like.

629
00:41:14,524 --> 00:41:17,795
Rym: I think Battlestar Galactica is Absolutely amazing.

630
00:41:17,815 --> 00:41:18,761
Scott: I don't think it's so great.

631
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:21,801
Rym: That's cuz you're dumb, but I did say it I really freaking like it.

632
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:24,596
Rym: I think it's super awesome and I really want to see it.

633
00:41:25,138 --> 00:41:34,010
Rym: but just in terms of all the media I have to consume and all the Non-media, I have to do like making media like this podcast and all the other things and my job.

634
00:41:34,632 --> 00:41:39,790
Rym: I don't have time to watch Battlestar Galactica and it seems like a lot of our friends get really kind of indignant about it.

635
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,483
Rym: Like why aren't you watching it?

636
00:41:41,544 --> 00:41:42,993
Rym: I keep telling you too And why don't you?

637
00:41:43,013 --> 00:41:46,045
Rym: and I'm like because I have more important things to do.

638
00:41:46,065 --> 00:41:49,002
Rym: I want to say it I agree with you that it's great.

639
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:56,729
Rym: I Have to make this podcast and then I have to cook a dinner and then I have to play this video game so I can Talk about it on the show and then I gotta go to sleep.

640
00:41:57,596 --> 00:41:59,934
Scott: Yeah It's I don't know.

641
00:42:00,275 --> 00:42:06,195
Scott: basically I do feel though in my in myself that I'm getting like less Enjoyment from things.

642
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:07,661
Rym: see I think that's just you.

643
00:42:07,681 --> 00:42:08,485
Rym: that's the second issue.

644
00:42:08,505 --> 00:42:09,790
Rym: I think we'll save this for another show.

645
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,897
Rym: Why is Scott so sad?

646
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:12,365
Scott: I'm not good.

647
00:42:12,406 --> 00:42:22,209
Rym: No not sad But it's very rare that I see you Like really into something and really enjoying it and like seeing the joys sparkle in your eye.

648
00:42:22,932 --> 00:42:23,273
Scott: Uh-huh.

649
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:39,841
Rym: I see that like you you have gotten to the point in like in Dungeons & Dragons Where I don't think there is anything other than playing burning wheel in a one-off with Luke Crane himself While being fell aided by a band of slave women or something.

650
00:42:40,282 --> 00:42:42,507
Rym: I don't think you can enjoy role-playing anymore.

651
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:48,910
Scott: I Think I can because I have recently when our last D&D session we played lacuna at the shore.

652
00:42:48,972 --> 00:42:58,864
Rym: That was fun But our last D&D sessions is evolved into the entire group yelling at you for basically Saying that you don't like settings anymore that you want only settingless games.

653
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:01,554
Scott: It doesn't have to be setting lists It's just I don't want.

654
00:43:01,615 --> 00:43:04,790
Scott: I want to interact more with the other players than I interact with the setting.

655
00:43:05,514 --> 00:43:06,329
Scott: That's what I was saying.

656
00:43:06,872 --> 00:43:13,662
Rym: but anyway to get I don't well do another show about that sometime or special or whatever, but You can't confuse this with.

657
00:43:14,226 --> 00:43:20,476
Rym: I don't want to say Getting better taste or anything pretentious like that But more of becoming more knowledge.

658
00:43:20,496 --> 00:43:22,061
Scott: better taste would be a matter of.

659
00:43:22,522 --> 00:43:23,184
Scott: I'm jaded.

660
00:43:23,204 --> 00:43:25,190
Scott: I don't like those Tezuka's.

661
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,121
Scott: I'm gonna read my Naruto's.

662
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:28,509
Scott: that's needing better taste.

663
00:43:29,951 --> 00:43:33,724
Rym: I think taste is subjective in many ways, but it is the idea that like.

664
00:43:34,046 --> 00:43:35,270
Rym: let's take the example of fast food.

665
00:43:35,792 --> 00:43:38,563
Rym: I used to eat a lot of fast food as a kid fast food.

666
00:43:38,643 --> 00:43:40,170
Rym: Not because I know that's what I'm getting it.

667
00:43:40,593 --> 00:43:42,090
Rym: I used to eat a lot of fast food as a kid.

668
00:43:42,191 --> 00:43:48,123
Rym: I used to drink a lot of soda as a kid like Seven or eight cans of to use the vernacular in Michigan pop.

669
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:50,030
Rym: I drank a lot of pop soda.

670
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:54,363
Rym: I'm gonna start saying that word again cuz like 48% of Americans say pop.

671
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:55,567
Scott: They're all wrong.

672
00:43:56,108 --> 00:43:56,550
Rym: It's pop.

673
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,213
Scott: That's how you can tell.

674
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:02,669
Rym: the thing is I say 48% because I don't count those cola people or those coke people.

675
00:44:03,571 --> 00:44:04,275
Rym: They're not people.

676
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:08,756
Scott: Nope, but unless they say moxie Moxie is awesome.

677
00:44:09,339 --> 00:44:12,151
Rym: I here's the thing Scott always yells at me for like liking things Like.

678
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:13,378
Rym: I only like the idea of liking it.

679
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:14,906
Scott: You just eat shields all the time.

680
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:15,630
Rym: I'll admit this.

681
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:24,844
Rym: I like the idea of moxie soda cuz it's old Like the idea of my soda as much as I would love to like moxie soda.

682
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,370
Rym: that shit tastes like battery acid.

683
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,836
Scott: I never taste not good.

684
00:44:28,977 --> 00:44:32,030
Scott: I never tasted it, but I do really like the idea of moxie soda.

685
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,081
Rym: It is I wanna like it.

686
00:44:34,162 --> 00:44:35,610
Rym: I want to be one of those guys.

687
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,898
Rym: He's like ha moxie, but it tastes like shit.

688
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,483
Scott: I know it's so bad.

689
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:39,764
Scott: What's?

690
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,630
Rym: it tastes like drinking burning phosphorus?

691
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,339
Scott: I'll just have to take a word for it.

692
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,170
Rym: I would rather drink battery acid cuz.

693
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,328
Scott: Actually, I don't think there's much of a difference But we should try to make a battery at a moxie.

694
00:44:54,951 --> 00:44:58,746
Rym: I get a lot of crap from people mostly at my job and just kind of normal people about.

695
00:44:58,847 --> 00:45:02,590
Rym: I won't eat fast food Like we'll be at a job and they're like, hey, we're working late.

696
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:07,690
Rym: I'll go get some McDonald's for everyone and I'm like, I'm not gonna eat McDonald's and I just don't eat anything.

697
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,956
Rym: And they think it's really weird.

698
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:10,001
Rym: Like why won't you McDonald's?

699
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,207
Rym: everybody's McDonald's like?

700
00:45:11,227 --> 00:45:11,910
Rym: I don't like McDonald's.

701
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,809
Rym: Everyone likes McDonald's and they get into the stupid argument and I don't care about him.

702
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:18,058
Scott: So They get an argument about that.

703
00:45:18,078 --> 00:45:19,222
Rym: They're like, why don't you eat McDonald's?

704
00:45:19,242 --> 00:45:19,985
Rym: It's poison.

705
00:45:20,005 --> 00:45:21,310
Rym: Why do you have a thing against McDonald's?

706
00:45:21,671 --> 00:45:23,019
Rym: Oh, you're just some health food nut.

707
00:45:23,502 --> 00:45:24,690
Rym: It's not a health food nut.

708
00:45:25,012 --> 00:45:28,250
Scott: It's a difference between being a health food nut and not eating poison.

709
00:45:28,431 --> 00:45:36,949
Scott: I mean a health food nut is someone who always shops, you know, like, you know The super organic granola II like Atkins.

710
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:38,919
Rym: Yeah Yeah, whatever get into that cuz I want to work.

711
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:42,737
Rym: You want to get into it either but cuz I want to Want to go eat some I'm hungry.

712
00:45:42,837 --> 00:45:44,986
Rym: Just I want to make you're not an idiot.

713
00:45:45,026 --> 00:45:45,990
Scott: It's like not smoking.

714
00:45:46,451 --> 00:45:49,201
Rym: I'm saying is that I had a taste for that stuff right then.

715
00:45:49,221 --> 00:45:56,326
Rym: then over time as I got to college and I started You know eating and drinking a much larger variety of things outside of the Midwest.

716
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:04,708
Rym: I Started not drinking so much soda and not eating so much fast food And then as time went on like once I stopped being accustomed to that food.

717
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:10,043
Rym: now The idea like biting into a McDonald's burger the taste of it makes me nauseous.

718
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:11,687
Scott: You still eat your freaking White Castle.

719
00:46:12,008 --> 00:46:12,810
Rym: White Castle's different.

720
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:13,512
Scott: No, it's not.

721
00:46:13,552 --> 00:46:13,653
Scott: Yes.

722
00:46:13,693 --> 00:46:14,555
Scott: It is the same shit.

723
00:46:14,575 --> 00:46:16,000
Rym: Cuz it's the White Castle smaller.

724
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,390
Rym: No, it's not because White Castle is just Greece.

725
00:46:20,991 --> 00:46:22,396
Rym: They're not pretending it's me.

726
00:46:22,757 --> 00:46:25,466
Rym: You don't bite into that and think oh man fake meat.

727
00:46:25,887 --> 00:46:28,809
Rym: It's just Greece with onion paste.

728
00:46:30,191 --> 00:46:31,073
Rym: It's so good.

729
00:46:31,214 --> 00:46:40,150
Rym: Anyway, I only eat fast food when necessary and I actually if there is a White Castle within a half hour I would go get like 20 White Castle's depending on which fast food I get.

730
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,435
Scott: I actually like some of it.

731
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:42,138
Scott: like Arby's.

732
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,202
Scott: I love some Arby's.

733
00:46:43,283 --> 00:46:45,130
Rym: I can eat those Arby's chicken fingers all day long.

734
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:45,774
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

735
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:48,250
Scott: chicken fingers and curly fries from Arby's are awesome.

736
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:51,704
Rym: Well, those curly fries fries are awesome while also disgusting.

737
00:46:51,724 --> 00:46:56,422
Scott: while my mouth loves them My stomach hates them and thus I am able to just not eat them.

738
00:46:56,482 --> 00:46:59,917
Scott: and I don't really eat fast food Unless I absolutely have.

739
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:03,718
Rym: I think soda is a better example because soda in and of itself Well, that's cuz.

740
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:07,038
Rym: Scott can't deal with fizziness Even non fizzy soda.

741
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,850
Rym: Well, the thing is soda is not really bad for you.

742
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:12,549
Rym: Just a lot of people drink too much of it and it also ruins your teeth.

743
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:14,033
Rym: Not so much.

744
00:47:14,053 --> 00:47:16,303
Rym: You don't ruins your teeth more than anything not brushing.

745
00:47:16,704 --> 00:47:17,950
Rym: Well, brush your teeth not.

746
00:47:19,153 --> 00:47:21,761
Rym: Actually in terms of drinks number one is lemonade.

747
00:47:21,861 --> 00:47:26,563
Rym: lemonade is the worst possible thing you can drink other than I don't know What if it's not corn syrup lemonade though?

748
00:47:26,683 --> 00:47:36,812
Rym: That's even worse uh-huh, because it's a combination of sucrose and Super acidic lemon and it sticks to your teeth and it just it's horrible for your teeth All right.

749
00:47:36,852 --> 00:47:38,158
Rym: Number two is energy drinks.

750
00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:40,306
Rym: Number three is soda.

751
00:47:40,326 --> 00:47:55,242
Rym: Uh-huh only do lemonade and even then so does not that bad for your teeth in moderation, but Soda, especially in America is super super super sweet and that didn't bother me as a kid But as I started drinking and eating a lot of different things.

752
00:47:55,282 --> 00:47:59,778
Rym: now if I drink normal soda It's so sweet that it's almost painful.

753
00:47:59,798 --> 00:48:02,065
Rym: Like I feel sick drinking it like wow.

754
00:48:02,106 --> 00:48:03,410
Rym: There's way too much sugar in this.

755
00:48:03,451 --> 00:48:04,289
Rym: I can't deal with it.

756
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:13,744
Scott: Yeah I do feel sick like eating fast food and stuff like now like eating like I used to eat a Cinnabon and like mmm now I eat a Cinnabon and it's like oh my stomach.

757
00:48:14,388 --> 00:48:16,942
Rym: Ah Did we tell the Cinnabon story on the show?

758
00:48:17,203 --> 00:48:18,410
Scott: No, we're not gonna bother with it.

759
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:20,237
Scott: I'll save that but I think let's just end it.

760
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:34,029
Scott: and I'll say if there's anyone else out there who's like me where you just Can't enjoy things because you've seen so much shit on the internet that it takes something so crazy to interest you We should start like some jaded by the internet support group or something like that.

761
00:48:34,451 --> 00:48:38,607
Rym: All that would be is an RS that you realize that that just devolves into Rome in the end.

762
00:48:38,687 --> 00:48:39,450
Rym: is hedonism bot?

763
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:49,270
Rym: Yeah, because you get so jaded that the only thing left is you have to Summon one of the slaves and have him executed and then dipped in the finest of oils and creams.

764
00:48:50,632 --> 00:48:52,301
Scott: But that doesn't even excite me.

765
00:48:52,341 --> 00:48:52,723
Scott: What do you?

766
00:48:52,743 --> 00:48:53,206
Scott: what do you?

767
00:48:53,226 --> 00:48:53,890
Rym: what excite you?

768
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:56,519
Rym: I mean, are you gonna get so decadent that what?

769
00:48:56,961 --> 00:48:57,182
Rym: what?

770
00:48:57,362 --> 00:48:59,390
Rym: if you could have anything in the world right now?

771
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:01,758
Rym: What would instill joy in you Scott Rubin?

772
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:05,352
Scott: not possible not possible Right now.

773
00:49:05,492 --> 00:49:06,695
Rym: anything infinite money.

774
00:49:06,716 --> 00:49:11,990
Rym: You have the count of Monte Cristo's money and hedonism bots resources and million slaves.

775
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:13,498
Rym: What what are you gonna get?

776
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,669
Scott: make some Star Wars movies that don't suck?

777
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:17,168
Rym: All right.

778
00:49:17,656 --> 00:49:18,446
Rym: So I think that's it.

779
00:49:19,171 --> 00:49:26,390
Rym: Geeks like us you have to get together and be patrons of the arts like in the old days and commission great works.

780
00:49:26,611 --> 00:49:27,395
Scott: That's that's.

781
00:49:27,556 --> 00:49:32,599
Scott: that's worse than than our current copyright system For many reasons.

782
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,310
Scott: a reason we got rid of the patron system.

783
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:35,996
Scott: We went to the copyright systems.

784
00:49:36,036 --> 00:49:39,550
Rym: fine if it's in parallel to another system within the system.

785
00:49:39,871 --> 00:49:44,750
Rym: Well, I think the only way left to keep us from just killing ourselves is to commission great works.

786
00:49:44,911 --> 00:49:48,255
Scott: I guess I'll have to go and commission some Sculptures or something.

787
00:49:48,415 --> 00:49:49,158
Rym: but Emily's here.
