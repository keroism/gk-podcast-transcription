00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,469
Rym: Hey, it's Thursday April 5th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:17,770
Rym: Tonight we present the prestigious worst in podcasting awards.

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,131
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:27,560
Rym: I gotta say the forums have been rocking have they now?

5
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:34,280
Rym: There's been more people there lately than I ever would have really expected to be at a forum that I guess I made I don't know.

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,464
Scott: I mean I think my part of my problem is if I wait all day and don't read the forum and then I go Late in the day.

7
00:00:41,504 --> 00:00:49,019
Scott: There's a billion posts, and I don't know what to do, but if I read it constantly It's not posting so fast that I can't keep up.

8
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:59,742
Rym: it seems like most people will wait X amount of time and then suddenly pop in and Respond to like every single thread on the front page and then come back a week later and see what people had to say in Return.

9
00:01:00,204 --> 00:01:02,494
Scott: yeah, and some people just reload it constantly.

10
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:07,937
Scott: and when I'm at work And I have no work to do you'll see me reloading it constantly when I have a lot of work to do.

11
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:09,759
Scott: you'll see me load It like twice a day.

12
00:01:10,423 --> 00:01:13,320
Rym: Yep, suffice to say a lot of new people have been joining the forum.

13
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:18,680
Rym: So I begin with this mostly to say to all of you who have applied and not gotten an email back.

14
00:01:19,084 --> 00:01:20,460
Rym: You actually did get an email back.

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,964
Rym: We have never ever.

16
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:29,808
Rym: well with the exception of one person who reapplied like eight times after we banned him Ever denied someone an application.

17
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:38,880
Rym: so if you applied to our forums and didn't get a response You probably use Yahoo email And they probably hotmail or hotmail and they probably blocked it thinking it was spam.

18
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:41,798
Scott: I think hotmail is the one that's blocked, but I don't know about Yahoo mail.

19
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:44,633
Rym: Oh, yeah, hotmail is blocked at pretty much a hundred percent.

20
00:01:44,753 --> 00:01:48,448
Scott: Yeah, if you got hotmail Get Gmail get Gmail.

21
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,932
Scott: There's it's free and better.

22
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:51,497
Scott: Why would you bother using hotmail?

23
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:51,999
Scott: I don't get it.

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,447
Rym: Yes, and also a few people pointed out that mr.

25
00:01:54,487 --> 00:01:55,791
Rym: Period hasn't been around lately.

26
00:01:56,212 --> 00:02:00,567
Rym: He has informed us that he has a life And he hasn't had time lately.

27
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,517
Rym: He swears that like general Douglas MacArthur.

28
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:14,499
Rym: He shall return And until then we're probably going to at least look into getting one or two more moderators because even if he comes back full-time There's too many of you for him to police anymore all on his own.

29
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:17,880
Scott: Also you people haven't been so bad lately.

30
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,999
Rym: Yeah I mean it's all been little things that While they irritate me a little bit but that's just cuz I'm a nut and they probably pissed the hell out of him.

31
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:26,650
Rym: if you Were actually reading the forums lately.

32
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:28,000
Rym: They're not that big a deal.

33
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,241
Rym: There's.

34
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:32,100
Rym: no one is doing the egregious horrible things that you used to be doing.

35
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:40,509
Scott: I mean the worst things I've seen lately are people saying then instead of then and Some there's there there's that are incorrect.

36
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:42,094
Rym: while that is terribly bothersome.

37
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:47,033
Rym: At least no one is posting 70 sentence long paragraphs without capitalization.

38
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:48,760
Scott: Yeah, that pretty much stopped.

39
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,000
Scott: I don't know if the people who did that sort of thing learned or if they just got pissed off and gave up.

40
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:57,877
Rym: Well, it helps that I would say most of the people in our forums are reasonably intelligent.

41
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:04,566
Scott: Yeah So we are in the midst of the Jewish holiday of Passover or Pesach.

42
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:10,915
Scott: if you are a Jew and that is what you call it and I am a Jew but not religiously Didn't you used to call yourself an open-source juggle?

43
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:14,871
Scott: No No, that was something that you you made up but not cuz.

44
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:17,500
Rym: you went way on about open-source Judaism for a while.

45
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:20,048
Scott: I talked about it because it was a cool thing.

46
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:22,035
Scott: I didn't say that I was it.

47
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:31,200
Scott: Aha Anyway, anyway The Passover is the holiday where the Jews celebrate being freed from Egypt.

48
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,939
Scott: You ever watch that, you know, Charlton Heston movie Ten Commandments that let my people go.

49
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,058
Scott: Yeah it's actually a pretty cool story pretty cool movie.

50
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:51,764
Scott: and The thing is a lot of people Jew and non-jou believe that it was true that at some point in history Jews were slaves in Egypt and Moses freed them.

51
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:56,280
Scott: and some people, you know, well might not believe it that he parted the Red Sea.

52
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,845
Scott: But you know who knows about that.

53
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:02,800
Scott: The thing is, you know, parting the Red Sea is obviously didn't happen.

54
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,027
Scott: I mean, come on, that's just silly.

55
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:10,285
Scott: but a lot of a lot of reasonable people do believe that Jews are slaves in Egypt.

56
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:11,248
Scott: That's not unreasonable.

57
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:13,657
Rym: Well, a lot of people also believe that slaves built the pyramids.

58
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:14,640
Scott: That's true.

59
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:16,099
Scott: Well, we don't know about that.

60
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:29,253
Scott: But the thing is there's only one piece of evidence ever to suggest that yes Indeed there were Hebrews because they weren't Jews yet They were Hebrews or Israelites who were slaves in Egypt.

61
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:30,879
Scott: one piece of evidence ever.

62
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:41,270
Scott: Pretty much anyone who knows anything about Egypt every Egyptologist every archaeologist will tell you any reasonable Archaeologist will tell you the Jews were never slaves in Egypt.

63
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:45,546
Scott: and that's all made up and it's just a story And it's not real.

64
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:47,680
Rym: Yeah, how are they had gotten down there anywhere?

65
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,544
Rym: Did they start there?

66
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:52,200
Scott: if you if you question this and you think that Jews were slaves in Egypt?

67
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,266
Scott: This is how you can figure out that you're wrong.

68
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:55,971
Scott: first answer this question.

69
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:58,940
Scott: What year were Jews slaves in Egypt?

70
00:04:59,540 --> 00:04:59,922
Scott: Okay.

71
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:03,259
Scott: Now go look in history and see what was happening in that year.

72
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:07,438
Scott: No matter what year you pick Jews won't be slaves in Egypt in that year.

73
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:10,360
Scott: Obviously.

74
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:12,051
Scott: That's sort of simple and silly.

75
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:13,520
Scott: but really think about it.

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,132
Scott: What year you pick a year like, you know, how many BC?

77
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:19,520
Scott: are you gonna go and then figure out what was happening?

78
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:33,517
Scott: You know according to archaeology and the best historical records We have in that year and you will find that we have evidence for things that were happening that will directly contradict Jews being slaves in Egypt like.

79
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:44,168
Scott: I don't know Jews not being there Jews being elsewhere other people interacting with Jews and Hebrews and other places at the time Etc, etc.

80
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:45,958
Scott: So yeah.

81
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:57,250
Rym: So taking a page from the previous year's New York Comic Con six flags over Georgia decided to go forward with an ill-conceived Idea, they thought you know, it'd be a great promotion.

82
00:05:57,772 --> 00:06:01,632
Rym: Let's say that anyone who shows up Today between 6 a.m.

83
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:08,260
Rym: And 9 a.m Gets in free and let's advertise this all over the place and it'll generate a bunch of buzz.

84
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,471
Rym: We'll market it as some sort of ditch work and come to six flags day.

85
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,696
Scott: That's a pretty good idea.

86
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:15,125
Scott: because number one What was today Thursday?

87
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:17,193
Scott: Yeah, people aren't going to amusement parks on Thursday.

88
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:21,389
Scott: However, it is spring break So you are gonna get some people now.

89
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:28,400
Scott: amusement parks are pretty expensive to get into But they make their real money in the park with our carny games and their well over.

90
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:43,475
Rym: Even back when Cedar Point was double awesome as a kid and it cost like 50 bucks to get in for one day and another 30 or 40 bucks to go to the water park on top of that, but you got in there All right, you want a soda or a water from one of those vending machines?

91
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:44,639
Rym: It's like three bucks.

92
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:47,539
Rym: You want a hamburger and fries nine bucks?

93
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,371
Scott: Yeah, you got to bring your own food in but they don't let you.

94
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:53,500
Scott: they don't let you know they don't stop you.

95
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:56,252
Rym: What are you gonna do with that food while you're riding roller coasters?

96
00:06:56,735 --> 00:06:57,940
Rym: Uh, you can't put it in a locker.

97
00:06:58,181 --> 00:07:01,058
Rym: Yeah, the lockers that cost a lot of money and are basically Dutch ovens.

98
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:06,496
Rym: Yeah, bring a hamburger and stick it in one of those lockers and see how you feel about eating it an hour later.

99
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:07,440
Scott: Oh, yeah.

100
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:09,486
Rym: So 6 a.m.

101
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:10,128
Rym: To 9 a.m.

102
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:11,232
Rym: Free entrance.

103
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:12,074
Rym: All right.

104
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:13,719
Rym: What do you think happened?

105
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,562
Scott: Billion people came.

106
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:26,039
Rym: well, apparently well before 6 o'clock the highways in every direction from this park were Completely stopped by people trying to get to this place.

107
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:32,620
Rym: Then because traffic was stopped people just abandon their cars on the freeway and started walking.

108
00:07:33,222 --> 00:07:44,413
Rym: So this unruly mob gathers and eventually makes it to the Six Flags to find a previous Unruly mob that had gotten there before the highways stopped already filling the parking lot.

109
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:49,200
Rym: a bunch of fistfights broke out And it was general chaos.

110
00:07:49,461 --> 00:08:03,408
Rym: furthermore the people at Six Flags were telling people not to line up because they didn't want to be responsible for it and They were telling anyone who didn't show up with a car that they don't accept anyone who isn't in a vehicle and they tried to Turn him back.

111
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:07,191
Scott: Uh How could you not accept anyone who's not in a vehicle?

112
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:09,359
Rym: a lot of places do that to keep the riffraff out?

113
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:13,356
Rym: Uh, in fact most drive-throughs if you try to walk through a drive-through, they'll call the police.

114
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:17,956
Rym: really Yeah, I tried to do it twice as a kid once on a bike and once on foot.

115
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,607
Scott: Wow Wow, they call the police both times.

116
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:22,315
Rym: They said go away or calling the police.

117
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,480
Scott: There's no law.

118
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:26,090
Scott: All right call the police.

119
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:26,794
Scott: what are you gonna do?

120
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:27,820
Rym: well, here's what they do.

121
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,935
Rym: They say don't come through the drive-through.

122
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,283
Rym: if you don't leave I'll call the police.

123
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:34,154
Rym: and if you don't leave you're not trespassing and then you've broken the law.

124
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:47,026
Rym: Yeah Anyway, yeah, so Obviously they didn't learn the fundamental rule that has been known in ages past mostly in nightclubs where the cover charge does not exist To make you money.

125
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:48,697
Scott: Well, it does make you money, but that's not.

126
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:49,120
Scott: it's for you.

127
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Rym: Don't have it to make money unless you're the anime club and we're trying to make a dollar.

128
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:59,396
Rym: Yeah The cover charge exists to keep the the the riffraff out and my riffraff not.

129
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:09,558
Rym: definitely not to sound I don't know classist or anything like that But the cheaper something is the more people will show up and the wider cross-section of society you will get.

130
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:12,839
Scott: yeah I mean imagine if you opened up something for free.

131
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:14,546
Scott: Homeless people will show up.

132
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:24,220
Scott: and not to make fun of homeless people because not all homeless people are bad But many homeless people are insane, but they're not insane enough that they won't show up to your free thing.

133
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,409
Rym: Well more importantly depends on what you're giving away.

134
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,333
Rym: if you're giving away t-shirts and you get a million of them That's not you're not gonna be.

135
00:09:30,414 --> 00:09:32,625
Rym: it doesn't matter One.

136
00:09:32,786 --> 00:09:41,519
Rym: it doesn't matter who shows up because you give them a t-shirt and it's no skin off your back and - if you're on Out of t-shirts you break down your little cardboard box and you walk away.

137
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:54,760
Rym: Yep If you've got a limited resource and you offer it for free and there are more people within I don't know 400 miles of you especially if it's something that has any perceived value who want that thing.

138
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:56,227
Rym: They're all going to show up.

139
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:57,574
Rym: people will come out of the woodwork.

140
00:09:57,594 --> 00:09:58,780
Rym: You didn't even know existed.

141
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:03,231
Scott: You know amusement parks haven't been doing well in recent years actually.

142
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:03,993
Rym: no they haven't.

143
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:09,836
Rym: cedar point even which is like the king of rollercoaster Parks, they make a crazy stupid amount of money.

144
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:20,052
Rym: yet everyone who on the internet has talked about going there has pointed out the incessant horrible Roman s decline of the cedar point Empire.

145
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:22,180
Rym: every year the people get crappier.

146
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:29,444
Rym: They're at x-ray machines because more and more people are bringing guns in and fights are breaking out and things are breaking down and vandalism Everywhere.

147
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:31,111
Scott: Yeah, pretty much amusement parks.

148
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:32,558
Scott: Just getting crappier and crappier.

149
00:10:33,643 --> 00:10:37,699
Scott: Yet all of a sudden they make one free and now people show up.

150
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:45,399
Scott: It's like people have forgotten about amusement parks maybe and they need of you know The opportunity to go to one for free to remember they exist.

151
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:48,000
Rym: I think there's a lot of factors at play.

152
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,176
Rym: I mean amusement parks still do.

153
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,167
Scott: well I mean obviously people want to go to them.

154
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:54,039
Scott: if people didn't want to go they wouldn't go even if it was free.

155
00:10:54,059 --> 00:11:16,229
Rym: well I was trolling around Google news just looking at various things about current amusement parks and trying to look at Wikipedia And it seems like the problem is that amusement parks get the same number of people But they have to pay a lot more in maintenance because the people who show up are Generally a lot more destructive than people used to be and there's a lot more damage Vandalism liability fights and police action.

156
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:17,273
Scott: Hmm.

157
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:19,440
Rym: I don't know if it's a consequence to society.

158
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:30,054
Rym: Maybe they need to raise their prices because regardless of how classist it may be the fact remains that the higher price you set on Something the more discriminating you can be in who shows up.

159
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:31,179
Scott: that is true.

160
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:42,569
Rym: the operative thing here is not an argument about class values or The horrible cycle of poverty where people have problems because they're poor But then they're poor because they have problems.

161
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:46,590
Rym: and it's this never-ending cycle and even if you're smart It's hard to break out of it and it sucks.

162
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:47,194
Rym: We're not.

163
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:50,019
Rym: I'm not talking about that I'm not trying to make any sort of judgment here.

164
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:56,440
Rym: The fact remains that whoever runs this six flag is a consummate dumbass who doesn't understand how the world works.

165
00:11:56,962 --> 00:11:59,632
Rym: And here's the kicker before 6 a.m.

166
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:05,600
Rym: Before it even opened at the last minute They decided you know what we fucked up and canceled the promotion.

167
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:07,686
Scott: Can you do something like that?

168
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:11,119
Rym: Yeah, and you know what the angry mob was still there?

169
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:13,326
Scott: Yes, it was.

170
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,237
Rym: I didn't really read the follow-ups, but I can't imagine that ended.

171
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,005
Rym: Well, though According to two articles.

172
00:12:19,386 --> 00:12:23,637
Rym: There's a zoo nearby and that zoo had more people show up than it's ever had.

173
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:28,095
Rym: go zoo Go probably because people pissed off and already taken the day off work.

174
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:29,200
Rym: What else are you gonna do?

175
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,678
Rym: There's the amusement park the zoo or I don't know the real world, but most people don't think of that.

176
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,990
Scott: Are you wasted a day off work?

177
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:37,357
Scott: That's really terrible.

178
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:40,311
Rym: if you do that I don't know if I took a day off work ever.

179
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:53,587
Rym: even if I failed at everything I plan to do I'd still get more done that day than if I'd gone to work Things of the day.

180
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:59,700
Rym: you might remember way back when our internet was out We did things of the day from our real life because well, there was no internet.

181
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:10,220
Rym: We had no way to in any way short of calling people or finding Pieces of dead trees with this dark stuff splattered all over him to find out what was going on in the world.

182
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:16,719
Rym: So we had to observe our surroundings and make you know, what's the deal with bla bla bla kind of?

183
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,800
Scott: Yeah, these pretzels are making me thirsty.

184
00:13:20,302 --> 00:13:23,032
Rym: Anyway, I got one of those kinds of things of the day today.

185
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:25,280
Rym: You see one of the places I work.

186
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:31,552
Rym: I'm setting up all these computers for him and Most of the people there are really cool and on.

187
00:13:31,673 --> 00:13:33,840
Rym: more of them than you would expect are totally metal.

188
00:13:34,702 --> 00:13:36,669
Rym: When I say metal, I mean no.

189
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:44,220
Rym: people who run very popular metal sites get into metal concerts free Have pictures themselves hanging out with musicians from Queens, right?

190
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:54,113
Rym: Mm-hmm, and this girl not only she totally metal, but she's also totally Scottish And with tartan week and all that while I'm setting up computers and everything.

191
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,557
Rym: she offhandedly mentions that.

192
00:13:56,038 --> 00:14:11,228
Rym: yeah tonight She's hanging out with the well I guess this was last night the previous president of Scotland and Sean Connery And sure enough today I go into work and I'm fiddling with other computers and she has a picture of herself Standing on a chair next to Sean Connery.

193
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:11,809
Scott: Is she short?

194
00:14:12,411 --> 00:14:14,538
Rym: No, Sean Connery is just gigantic.

195
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:15,300
Scott: Is he really?

196
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,535
Rym: All right, Sean Connery looks really big and impressive on screen, right?

197
00:14:19,555 --> 00:14:31,907
Rym: It looks about six something Yeah, but also like he has this charisma in this presence You know real and usually when you see someone like that in real life They're a lot smaller than they look on screen Sean Connery looks twice as big in person.

198
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:32,669
Scott: Is he really?

199
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,496
Rym: his head is bigger than other people's heads.

200
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:36,217
Scott: Whoa.

201
00:14:36,298 --> 00:14:37,080
Rym: It's really big.

202
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:45,300
Rym: Okay, and according to her he is Exactly as charismatic and awesome as you would guess from his movie acting as he is in real life.

203
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,285
Scott: But isn't he all I've heard?

204
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:47,852
Scott: he's also kind of like an ass like.

205
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:51,531
Scott: not an ass like, you know A guy you don't want to talk to but like a wise ass.

206
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:52,033
Rym: You know what?

207
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:53,801
Rym: I really like wise asses I'm.

208
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:55,427
Scott: well, I like to be a wise ass too.

209
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:59,200
Rym: I know I'm just saying but Scott you like to be a wise ass.

210
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,345
Rym: You say I never would have guessed.

211
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:03,599
Rym: What's the deal with Scott being a wise ass?

212
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:07,240
Scott: What's the deal with the Rym not being original?

213
00:15:08,263 --> 00:15:09,958
Rym: What's the deal with making fun of?

214
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:13,553
Rym: Anyway, I thought that was pretty cool.

215
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:16,725
Rym: So that's my thing of the day My thing of the day.

216
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:21,700
Scott: earlier in the week Rym did a thing of the day of a flash tower defense game.

217
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:23,840
Scott: Cuz you know, we love them flash tower defense game.

218
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:31,295
Rym: Yeah, very briefly all those of you who aren't in our forums Everyone in the forums is crazily addicted to the stupid game and posting their scores.

219
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:32,720
Rym: So join in on that action.

220
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:44,080
Scott: But anyway, anyway, there's another flash game that was all over the internets today called chick chick boom Which is pretty cool name because you know chick chicka boom chick chicka boom chick chicka boom.

221
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,346
Rym: I don't know when I hear chick chick boom.

222
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:46,933
Rym: I think someone cocking a shotgun.

223
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:51,394
Scott: Oh, I think I think of the mask with John Kerry.

224
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:55,336
Scott: Nah Jim Carrey John Kerry is the senator.

225
00:15:55,417 --> 00:16:01,340
Rym: Yes Anyway, I think part of that is that I spent most of my childhood playing doom and you like the mask.

226
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:04,645
Rym: So yes, so I don't like the mask.

227
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:08,400
Scott: chick chick boom has nothing to do with shotguns or Jim Carrey movies.

228
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:10,687
Scott: It's a Nintendo flash game.

229
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:13,215
Scott: Nintendo makes it and it's free to play.

230
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:23,695
Scott: and the way the game works is You've basically got what looks like a volleyball court and on one side are these little balls that are yellow and they're chicks on the other side of these black balls, which are evil.

231
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:26,426
Scott: and You've got all these things.

232
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:27,410
Scott: you can click on.

233
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,920
Scott: you can click on and I've only played level one.

234
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:36,300
Scott: So, I don't know what all the things are But basically of a left arrow a right arrow a weight and a bomb.

235
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:41,420
Scott: Right and you click on one of these things and let's say you click on the bomb.

236
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:43,590
Scott: All right, a picture of a bomb shows up.

237
00:16:43,992 --> 00:16:45,520
Scott: You have to trace it with your mouse.

238
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:49,200
Scott: It's a lot better if you have a tablet PC because then you can trace it with your stylus.

239
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,937
Rym: I watched Scott trying to do this on his laptop with the touch with a touch pad on a laptop.

240
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:53,680
Scott: It's impossible.

241
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:58,520
Rym: It's pretty much like trying to play that Carney game of pull the ring up the snake without touching harder than that.

242
00:16:59,162 --> 00:17:04,396
Scott: Anyway, depending on how accurately you trace the bomb you get a greater percentage.

243
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:06,585
Scott: if you don't do it Well enough you don't get anything.

244
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:08,855
Scott: So let's say you trace the bomb with 86% accuracy.

245
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:18,200
Scott: All right a bomb with 86% power flies over into the enemy territory where the black balls are and tries to blow them up.

246
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:20,848
Scott: Let's say you do the left arrow.

247
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,824
Scott: All right, you draw the left arrow with 90% accuracy.

248
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:31,020
Scott: So with 90% speed all your chickens yellow balls will run to the left side of your court.

249
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:31,918
Rym: You know what?

250
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,467
Rym: You know would be really good at this game.

251
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:35,840
Rym: any of our artist friends with a Wacom tablet?

252
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,780
Scott: Probably yeah Wacom tablet would own especially since they can draw Yep.

253
00:17:40,382 --> 00:17:57,875
Scott: But basically you click on the different maneuvers you want to do and attacks you want to execute and then you have to trace the symbol for that attack or Maneuver with better accuracy in order to execute the move better and You try to blow up the other side and not have your side get blowed up.

254
00:17:58,317 --> 00:17:58,940
Rym: That's really cool.

255
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:10,760
Rym: I kind of like the idea of having Simple direct competition kind of games like that where the skill isn't just knowing what to do But being able to do it which is hard to do in video games without just making like a twitch FPS.

256
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,440
Scott: The thing is the game is sort of real time because you can just keep clicking you can keep doing stuff.

257
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:20,800
Scott: It's like as soon as you execute a move it like D and once the move executes you can try to do it again.

258
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,945
Scott: So it's it there.

259
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:28,317
Scott: It's not like a turn-based thing where you do what I do when you do what I do one but at the same time.

260
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,994
Scott: Well, I guess there is nothing else at the same time.

261
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:32,758
Scott: That's the whole game.

262
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:40,360
Scott: The only other thing I can say about this game is when you beat levels you unlock power-ups.

263
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:44,388
Scott: But they're not work power-ups in the game They're power-ups in real life like in the first level.

264
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:55,416
Scott: if you beat the first level it lets you download a Mario basketball Wallpaper and if you beat level 2 it lets you download some other wallpaper And you get Nintendo goodies for beating levels in this game.

265
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,300
Rym: That's kind of cool.

266
00:18:56,561 --> 00:19:03,030
Scott: Yeah, you could get these goodies at the Nintendo.com website But I guess if you want to get them this way, that's cool, too.

267
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,645
Rym: Well, so I suppose a lot of you especially those who have submitted have been waiting for this for a while But is finally upon us.

268
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:19,734
Rym: I thus present to you the worst in podcasting awards with Rym and Scott Alright, just to let everyone know these aren't the worst podcasts on the internet?

269
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:21,058
Rym: far from it in fact.

270
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,929
Scott: we Asked our listeners to nominate podcasts.

271
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:31,919
Scott: They were thought were the worst and therefore most of these podcasts involve Video games anime and other geeky things like that.

272
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:36,300
Rym: yes It wasn't so much a what is the worst podcast or who out there sucks?

273
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,740
Rym: It was more of a what can you find with some iTunes dig podcast searching yes?

274
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:48,680
Scott: And our listeners came through and they submitted many a podcast and pretty much all of which were bad.

275
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:59,105
Rym: Now before we continue with the actual awards we've got a lot to say because I've learned a lot in listening to a bunch of bad podcasts and also in reading their the writings.

276
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:07,460
Rym: people sent us about these bad podcasts And there's a lot of similarities between many of these and other ones in general that I listen to that weren't actually submitted.

277
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:10,548
Scott: So what did all these bad podcasts have in common?

278
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:14,640
Rym: well one common thread among bad podcast is the repeated?

279
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,299
Rym: unlicensed use of unlicensed music.

280
00:20:17,822 --> 00:20:23,162
Scott: Really you think that like podcasting like the culture of podcasting the podcasting community That's like.

281
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:26,293
Scott: their number one issue is you know what music can you play?

282
00:20:26,373 --> 00:20:28,420
Scott: play pod safe music only blabbity blah?

283
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:39,974
Scott: You think that someone being a podcaster would recognize basically the number one thing the community talks about and Do something about it at least acknowledge that you're playing copyrighted music or say something about it.

284
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:44,700
Rym: now granted many of the people I listen To out there don't seem to be a part of the podcast community.

285
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:53,420
Scott: I know for a fact that we are not really part of the podcast community not so much But at least partially like I got a toe dipped in there well And I keep my ear to the wall.

286
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,711
Rym: You know we happen to have met a few other podcasters And I noticed that we mostly only listen to their podcasts.

287
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:00,840
Scott: I listen to other podcasts.

288
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,662
Rym: Yeah, I listen to.

289
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:07,299
Rym: maybe 50% of my podcast are people I know and the other 50% are just good podcasts mmm.

290
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:10,796
Scott: I think actually I should increase our involvement in the podcast community.

291
00:21:10,998 --> 00:21:21,032
Rym: well another thing I've noticed is that a lot of really bad podcast really talk up a lot of Podcasting awards that they have won and really I don't eat the only.

292
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:28,554
Scott: there's so many different people who've tried to make Podcasting awards and all of them that I've seen have been pretty much like who cares well.

293
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:29,616
Rym: Here's my assessment.

294
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:34,492
Rym: This is my rims Professional opinion here and by saying professional.

295
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:37,100
Rym: I hereby lend all sorts of authority.

296
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:50,210
Rym: No, but I've noticed that web Podcasting awards are almost exactly like web awards were in the early 90s You see does anyone if you might not remember this?

297
00:21:50,270 --> 00:22:03,320
Rym: but way back in the day when websites were new like 1997 98 like when you could go to the bookstore and people would sell for a lot of money Yellow pages of the internet that would list a good percentage of the web pages out there.

298
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,684
Scott: Yeah in those days There were different.

299
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:12,159
Scott: websites would get awards for being having good design or whatever and basically the way this worked is.

300
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:18,619
Scott: you would go To a website and you would say you know I nominate my website for the award or something like that.

301
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:24,940
Scott: And then if they decided that you won the award they would send you an email and say congratulations you won.

302
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:30,962
Scott: Here's an image to put on your site and people would put a bunch of images on their site of all the awards They won.

303
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,411
Scott: I even did this when I was a punk kid.

304
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,415
Rym: I did too.

305
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:34,937
Rym: It was right.

306
00:22:34,998 --> 00:22:37,652
Rym: next to that Don't use Netscape Navigator.

307
00:22:37,752 --> 00:22:39,100
Rym: It's garbage icon.

308
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,760
Rym: Yep And and the flaming skull that rotated and said email.

309
00:22:44,582 --> 00:22:57,557
Scott: The lesson that I learned was that the people giving out the awards are much smarter than the people who won the awards because basically You linked that image to the site that gave out the awards so that people knew you weren't just faking it.

310
00:22:57,998 --> 00:23:05,908
Scott: as a result The people who gave out the awards would give the awards to anyone who asked as long as your site wasn't complete crap I at least I don't know.

311
00:23:05,948 --> 00:23:07,657
Scott: maybe they did just give it to anyone who asked.

312
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:13,902
Rym: furthermore All of these sites that gave out the awards happen to have a lot of ads on the front page yeah,

313
00:23:14,123 --> 00:23:23,900
Scott: and basically they just got links to their site all over the internet and people would come to their site and see ads and they would get a lot of visitors and You would feel good about yourself.

314
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,019
Scott: But really all you did was ask someone to give you an image and they did.

315
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,971
Rym: Yep now a lot of the other awards and podcasting.

316
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,439
Rym: there's a lot of this now to where there's.

317
00:23:31,921 --> 00:23:39,210
Rym: There'll be some sort of web page with the thing and you got to send all your listeners to go and vote for it And then you get people to vote on the internet.

318
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,860
Rym: Yeah, and I don't think I need to explain what's wrong with that.

319
00:23:42,141 --> 00:23:48,398
Scott: It pretty much just comes down to you know, which Podcast got which listeners to go to which award site?

320
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:55,500
Rym: now I will note for anyone who doubts us look at the the super big professional podcast all the twit stuff things like that.

321
00:23:55,921 --> 00:24:00,920
Rym: How many podcasting awards have they won that are listed on their websites?

322
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,416
Rym: Versus how many awards the five listener podcast about?

323
00:24:05,797 --> 00:24:09,260
Rym: I don't know Animal-crossing has won about the same number.

324
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,484
Scott: The difference is the twit.

325
00:24:10,504 --> 00:24:28,940
Scott: people tend to win the more legitimate awards that happen at like, you know podcasting conferences or things like that or play or Awards where nominations are completely open and no one sends their listeners to go vote in it And it's actually decided by some sort of actual system of some sort.

326
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:32,159
Scott: Yeah, and these other awards are just like the web Awards.

327
00:24:32,823 --> 00:24:36,460
Scott: Well being that as it may is the webbies are the only real level.

328
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:41,920
Rym: I hereby declare ribbon Scott of GeekNights to be the runners-up for best podcast.

329
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:48,629
Rym: best podcast of course being 12 Byzantine emperors If you say so.

330
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:56,952
Rym: another thing I've noticed is that there's a Direct correlation between how lame a podcast is and how much they try to sell merchandise Really?

331
00:24:57,357 --> 00:25:03,520
Rym: I mean I listen to some bad podcasts and they all had a cafe press and some of them that aren't in this contest.

332
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:12,734
Rym: the worst they were the more they plugged their cafe press and the more they talked about how much stuff they got for sale and The more they asked for donations the more they tried to make money.

333
00:25:12,754 --> 00:25:19,762
Scott: Hmm Maybe there's some people out there who just want to do this podcasting thing to make money and don't actually care about Podcasting.

334
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:22,549
Rym: go to the bookstore and look at all the books on podcasting.

335
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:26,560
Rym: a lot of them are basically how to monetize your podcasting.

336
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:38,400
Scott: Yeah, I think it's all happened mostly because that stupid MTV guy kept you know marketing the idea of quit your day job Blabbity blah and he's like we're gonna help people quit their day jobs and they can podcast for a living.

337
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:49,064
Scott: Yeah A lot of people sort of have this dream of not having to do the job They hate and just being able to talk into a microphone and internet all day and that's that's a dream Many people have.

338
00:25:49,084 --> 00:25:52,977
Scott: I live that dream and it sucked so I don't know what you want so badly.

339
00:25:52,998 --> 00:26:00,960
Rym: Yeah I've also noticed that a lot of lame podcast nice not that they have bad websites and that they don't have websites at all.

340
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:06,035
Rym: They're just a feed in iTunes and I can find neither hide nor hair of them anywhere else on the Internet.

341
00:26:06,456 --> 00:26:07,720
Rym: the feeds often go down.

342
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:11,475
Rym: Sometimes the feed is just straight-up broken and sends me gibberish.

343
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:12,077
Rym: instead of mp3s.

344
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,616
Scott: Yeah, a lot of one site one part of the same names as other podcasts.

345
00:26:16,717 --> 00:26:17,500
Scott: Oh God harder.

346
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:21,960
Rym: Yeah, there's one that actually is already gone as far as I can tell that was submitted for an award.

347
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:25,592
Rym: Well one of our awards yeah submitted to this contest.

348
00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:30,237
Rym: now before we go any further with this However, I would like to point out a few things.

349
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,280
Rym: that one This is all in good fun.

350
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,123
Rym: If you can't tell.

351
00:26:33,484 --> 00:26:40,340
Rym: if your podcast is mentioned here and you you know saw a bunch of hits and you came and listen to This don't feel bad one.

352
00:26:41,221 --> 00:26:46,660
Rym: We hope that at least some of what we say is constructive criticism - we're not saying you were the worst podcast.

353
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,535
Rym: We're saying you were the worst podcast that our listeners told us about.

354
00:26:51,997 --> 00:26:52,739
Scott: that's what we're saying.

355
00:26:52,759 --> 00:27:07,520
Rym: Yeah Yeah, but also it comes down to you're doing a podcast anyone who is doing something like this anyone who decides that they're going to take their Valuable free time and make free content for the internet and just give it away.

356
00:27:07,841 --> 00:27:15,705
Rym: You're whether you're gonna make music or a webcomic or a blog or a podcast or anything and you're doing this on your own For nothing in return.

357
00:27:16,106 --> 00:27:19,480
Rym: you're already better than everyone in the world who doesn't do anything like that.

358
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:43,480
Scott: Yeah, pretty much even the worst podcaster in the world the guy who just makes a podcast that sounds like this Hi Yeah, that guy is still better maybe not as a person but as a Constructive creator of content is still better than the guy who sits at home doing nothing about playing World of Warcraft.

359
00:27:43,802 --> 00:27:54,263
Rym: Especially because lately on the internet as time has gone on There's been a lot of this culture of entitlement where there was the error when mp3s you could just get anything you wanted on the internet Download it automatically.

360
00:27:54,624 --> 00:28:02,568
Rym: and then the RIA started suing people and a lot of younger tech guys always like to say yeah information wants to be free free society.

361
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:07,572
Rym: everyone will just do stuff because they want to and it's gonna be great and you won't have to pay for music or anything.

362
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:16,513
Rym: and Unless those people are also willing to either help create Facilitate the creation of or in some ways support that free content.

363
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:18,700
Rym: They're basically just shit talkers.

364
00:28:19,104 --> 00:28:20,883
Scott: Yeah, pretty much It's a good thing.

365
00:28:20,923 --> 00:28:26,089
Scott: enough people are not shit talkers that and we actually do have lots of free music and free podcasts and free Everything.

366
00:28:26,253 --> 00:28:40,080
Rym: Yes so one last time and I can't stress this enough even if we give you the award of the worst podcast from our listeners You're better than most of our listeners who submitted you because most of them don't do anything like this.

367
00:28:40,463 --> 00:28:51,167
Scott: Also, if you hear your podcast mentioned We would hope that you would try to improve your podcast and because you actually probably do have a bad podcast We're not gonna lie too much here.

368
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:57,592
Rym: Of course due to I guess the full disclosure here I hate 90% of everything.

369
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:59,279
Rym: Yeah, that includes podcasting.

370
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,800
Rym: So I'll point out that some of the podcasts that were submitted are above average.

371
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,751
Rym: They're well above average for podcasts at least.

372
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:10,220
Rym: yeah, that's what I'm about to say in terms of podcasting.

373
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,217
Rym: They're so above average and bordering on the upper 10% of podcasts.

374
00:29:15,578 --> 00:29:19,390
Rym: That is amazing But in my eyes, I still don't like him at all.

375
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,380
Rym: All right, so without further ado, all right.

376
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:27,300
Scott: now We're not gonna go for every single podcast that was submitted by someone We're just gonna go over the finalists.

377
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:36,558
Rym: So these are the worst of the worst or the most Interesting to talk about because remember I did offer bonus points if your podcast was bad, but had a lot of listeners.

378
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:40,940
Scott: Yep Okay, so here is the least worst of the finalists.

379
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:46,578
Rym: Well in order of what percentage of the podcast Scott was able to listen to before he turned it off and discuss.

380
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,180
Scott: that is correct.

381
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:47,561
Scott: every.

382
00:29:47,622 --> 00:29:56,477
Scott: I listened to two episodes of each of these podcasts and I wrote down how long the episode was and How long I listened to it for before I just turned it off.

383
00:29:56,979 --> 00:29:58,808
Scott: now I didn't actually calculate the percentages.

384
00:29:58,888 --> 00:30:05,211
Scott: So I'm just gonna like estimate here, but We're gonna go by how much of the podcast I listened to.

385
00:30:05,592 --> 00:30:08,140
Scott: so we're gonna start off with this podcast called mech head.

386
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:11,129
Scott: I listened to episodes 11 and 32.

387
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:22,948
Scott: I listened to the most recent episode and some random one near the beginning Yep and I listened to a hundred percent of this podcast mostly because episode 11 was seven minutes long and Episode 32 is four minutes long.

388
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:25,620
Scott: I listened to the whole thing without killing myself.

389
00:30:26,122 --> 00:30:28,595
Scott: Now mech head is a podcast about battle tech.

390
00:30:28,615 --> 00:30:33,490
Scott: this guy basically Reviews mechs in the game of battle tech.

391
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:37,241
Rym: now before I'd like to read the actual submission from John C Who.

392
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:39,006
Rym: he's the one who submitted this podcast to us.

393
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:44,060
Rym: All right, I have this locked down leadpipe lock for the worst of all time.

394
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:45,345
Scott: Sorry, you didn't win.

395
00:30:45,586 --> 00:30:48,698
Rym: No, in fact you sent us probably the best podcast we heard.

396
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:49,340
Scott: still bad.

397
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,740
Scott: This is a bad podcast but better than the rest of the finalists were about to go.

398
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,975
Rym: All right, he says it has some of the worst sound quality of all time.

399
00:30:57,237 --> 00:30:57,920
Rym: I beg to differ.

400
00:30:59,224 --> 00:30:59,729
Rym: It is pretty bad.

401
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,363
Rym: It's not that bad though It's.

402
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:04,500
Scott: it's okay audio quality compared to some of the other ones.

403
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:11,100
Scott: My number one problem is a problem a lot of podcasts had where the music was a lot louder than the talking.

404
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:15,898
Rym: Well, he goes on to say the guy has no idea what dynamic range means to someone trying to listen to a show.

405
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:18,607
Rym: one minute Loud one minute super soft.

406
00:31:18,648 --> 00:31:20,253
Rym: I like how super soft was in all cabs.

407
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:23,767
Scott: It did not have noise though There wasn't a lot of annoying sounds.

408
00:31:23,787 --> 00:31:26,237
Scott: I mean a couple of times there was some breathing noise.

409
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:27,000
Scott: that was annoying.

410
00:31:27,444 --> 00:31:32,045
Scott: but other than that, I mean it wasn't like Where I was gonna kill myself.

411
00:31:32,386 --> 00:31:32,567
Rym: Yep.

412
00:31:32,787 --> 00:31:36,680
Rym: The podcast is so bad mostly because it doesn't have a terrible theme to make it wretched.

413
00:31:37,524 --> 00:31:41,000
Rym: He basically just seems to think that it's really boring and poorly produced.

414
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:44,140
Scott: It was boring and poorly poorly produced.

415
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:45,948
Scott: He had poor transitions.

416
00:31:46,008 --> 00:31:51,188
Scott: like he would just be talking about one thing and then without Transitioning at all would be talking about something else.

417
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,658
Scott: Like he would say what is gonna his show is gonna be about.

418
00:31:53,718 --> 00:31:55,064
Scott: it was like Yeah today.

419
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:58,137
Scott: I'm gonna talk about Animal Crossing, you know, not Animal Crossing.

420
00:31:58,157 --> 00:32:01,940
Scott: It's a different five Today, I'm gonna talk about the Timber Wolf Mac.

421
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:04,579
Scott: The Timber Wolf Mac is a bloody bloody bluff, you know, and it's like whoa.

422
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:06,807
Scott: You just jumped right into it there.

423
00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:09,257
Scott: You kind of lose him and he does that in every episode.

424
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:09,940
Scott: He didn't change that.

425
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,620
Rym: No I will point out that to someone who doesn't know anything about battle tech or any of that this podcast is useless and I can.

426
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:18,900
Scott: This podcast doesn't teach you anything about battle tag.

427
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:27,079
Scott: He assumes you pretty much know all there is to know about the game of battle tech and if you don't know anything You're just gonna be completely lost and say what the fuck?

428
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:35,480
Rym: Yep Now the guy who sent the email in also says that he found out that supposedly this guy has never played More than two rounds worth of a battle tech game.

429
00:32:36,082 --> 00:32:41,945
Scott: I listened to what he was saying and I've played quite a few battle tech games in my in my day and How many.

430
00:32:41,985 --> 00:32:44,580
Scott: it doesn't matter how much this guy has actually played the game.

431
00:32:44,982 --> 00:32:52,573
Scott: he does have an understanding of the rules and has definitely read the books and What he's saying isn't really useful to a battle tech player.

432
00:32:52,633 --> 00:33:00,660
Scott: like even if you're a battle tech player There's no reason to listen to this show, but he this guy does know what he's talking about a little enough.

433
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,549
Rym: Yeah, when he talked about the max all the things he said were dead on.

434
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:09,920
Rym: so because this is definitely the best of the podcast We got I have some actual constructive criticism here.

435
00:33:10,362 --> 00:33:13,840
Rym: All this guy needs to do to have a good podcast is one get a better logo.

436
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:16,913
Rym: He has probably the worst logo in the history of podcast.

437
00:33:17,053 --> 00:33:21,794
Scott: Oh, that's bad because in one of the episodes I think I heard him talking about how he's gonna have a cool new logo soon.

438
00:33:22,216 --> 00:33:25,848
Scott: Oh, well, alright I thought no, but I think that's the one he's referring to.

439
00:33:26,249 --> 00:33:33,740
Rym: really I'm not sure but maybe it looks like someone just kind of Poorly drew the word mech head on a piece of paper and scanned it in off-center.

440
00:33:34,061 --> 00:33:42,245
Rym: Yep, but - all he needs to do is come up with some transitions some good dynamic content and he reviews max Which is okay.

441
00:33:42,285 --> 00:33:43,431
Rym: You can have a podcast about that.

442
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:47,451
Rym: got to go into more depth He pretty much just describes the mech and what it's good at.

443
00:33:47,913 --> 00:33:49,580
Rym: He doesn't offer much insight.

444
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:55,106
Rym: Well, I know the guy knows enough about the game where he probably could offer a lot of insight And I think he just needs to tap that.

445
00:33:55,126 --> 00:33:59,740
Scott: I think basically it's we during the world needs a podcast about battle tech.

446
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:08,125
Scott: There is no question and all this guy has to do to have a good podcast about battle tech and maybe to become the premier Battle tech podcast is all right.

447
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:10,251
Scott: Your show is seven minutes long about a game.

448
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:12,377
Scott: That is incredibly strategically deep.

449
00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:13,580
Scott: Good job guy.

450
00:34:13,687 --> 00:34:20,460
Rym: Yeah I could probably talk for an entire week's worth of GeekNights on the various strategies using that.

451
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,067
Scott: Uh, we're doing a battle tech episode.

452
00:34:22,087 --> 00:34:23,132
Scott: I'm adding it to the list.

453
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:33,174
Scott: Yeah, I think we're gonna have to yep But you just have to say something about the battle tech game that is actually useful Interesting or entertaining and there are a lot of things to say.

454
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:34,319
Scott: I could think of them right now.

455
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:35,784
Scott: You just have to say them.

456
00:34:36,187 --> 00:34:38,295
Scott: imagine if someone is a battle tech player.

457
00:34:38,355 --> 00:34:39,639
Scott: They play battle tech every week.

458
00:34:40,242 --> 00:34:41,607
Scott: What do they want to know?

459
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:45,360
Scott: What do they want to learn and say those things and you'll have a good show?

460
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:49,820
Rym: Alright, but anyway, we shouldn't dwell on this because we don't want to turn it into the review of one podcast.

461
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:50,302
Rym: No we don't.

462
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:52,578
Rym: we're gonna breeze through some of the rest of these because they're.

463
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:55,467
Rym: This is the top of the tree.

464
00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:57,655
Rym: This is the apex of the pyramid.

465
00:34:57,936 --> 00:34:59,100
Rym: This is as good as it gets.

466
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:04,279
Scott: I think the next one it would be the Nintendo podcast aka the lithcast.

467
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:07,261
Scott: now I listened to episodes 30 and 23.

468
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:13,840
Rym: I'm not sure what I listened to because it was hard to tell if the Nintendo podcast and a lithcast are the same or not.

469
00:35:14,201 --> 00:35:16,006
Scott: Or yes, I'm not I'm not sure.

470
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:17,170
Scott: but episode 23.

471
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,975
Scott: I listened to two minutes and 45 seconds.

472
00:35:21,525 --> 00:35:23,960
Scott: Oh, no, wait, okay, maybe you got this wrong.

473
00:35:24,361 --> 00:35:29,578
Scott: It looks like it was two hours and 45 minutes long and I listened to five minutes and 17 seconds.

474
00:35:30,722 --> 00:35:35,778
Scott: Oh, and the other one was an hour and 16 minutes long and I lasted seven minutes and 25 seconds.

475
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:43,700
Rym: Well, Jay Wallace submitted this one and he wrote up a freaking essay on exactly why this podcast is bad.

476
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:49,140
Rym: I'm not gonna read the whole thing because it's very long, but it's very to the point and very harsh.

477
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:58,319
Rym: He talks about how the microphone etiquette is bad and the sound quality is bad and the guy says um Okay, and smacks his lips all the time.

478
00:35:59,023 --> 00:35:59,846
Rym: He goes on to say how.

479
00:35:59,887 --> 00:36:11,586
Rym: he emailed the dude and pointed out some of the problems he had with the audio quality in iTunes and the guy responded saying that he got new equipment and Apparently the podcast didn't sound any better afterward.

480
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:16,500
Scott: Yeah, this guy has the same problem of music too loud talking too quiet.

481
00:36:17,064 --> 00:36:19,319
Scott: There was a lot of pausing and hiccups and stuttering.

482
00:36:20,446 --> 00:36:21,400
Scott: He had bad pronunciation.

483
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:24,349
Scott: He said Miele instead of melee which granted.

484
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:31,994
Rym: granted when I was a little kid and I played that Robin Hood game for the NES I never I said the word Miele because I never heard anyone say the word.

485
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:33,360
Rym: I'd only ever seen it in books.

486
00:36:33,923 --> 00:36:36,560
Scott: Yeah, there was actually another podcast that made the same mistake.

487
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,459
Scott: I'm gonna mention later.

488
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:43,300
Scott: But yeah, at least this guy recognized that his music was too loud and his voice is too quiet.

489
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:46,441
Scott: He actually said so much in episode 23.

490
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:50,340
Scott: Also, it's he seemed reasonably intelligent.

491
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:55,900
Scott: It's just he didn't say the reasonably intelligent things that it sounded like he knew.

492
00:36:56,481 --> 00:37:01,155
Scott: All he did was say in a monotone completely boring and useless information.

493
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:02,700
Scott: It was like a bad high school teacher.

494
00:37:02,741 --> 00:37:04,140
Scott: Yep, all I get about Nintendo.

495
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:11,850
Rym: All he really would need to do is have a writer or plan ahead a little bit and have some I don't again Dynamic content say something interesting.

496
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:28,371
Scott: I mean he actually got some people onto the show as co-host with Skype and those people didn't really talk so much and He would like ask them stuff and they would answer most of the time with just like two words Like two word answers or three word answers.

497
00:37:28,492 --> 00:37:37,709
Rym: Yes, and there would be pauses, you know We we're here at GeekNights have something I like to call the Rym and Scott sound smarter filter Which does a great many things to our audio.

498
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,000
Rym: One of the things it does is it dynamically reduces silence.

499
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:48,219
Rym: so if we pause for a second like between bits it gets rid of that and This guy it's like he runs the opposite filter.

500
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:52,314
Scott: Yeah, there was a whole lot of pausing a whole lot of dead air going on.

501
00:37:52,334 --> 00:37:54,040
Scott: I don't know what he was doing.

502
00:37:54,502 --> 00:37:59,440
Rym: I get the impression that pretty much every podcast from this point on in our show doesn't edit at all.

503
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:02,392
Rym: I think they literally just record upload record upload.

504
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:03,938
Scott: That is not good.

505
00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:11,443
Rym: Yes it's one thing I mean if you're doing a live show like actually live where people listen on Skype or talk show or whatever and It's live.

506
00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:12,629
Rym: then you upload it and you do that.

507
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:19,800
Rym: But if you're not doing that to be live There's no reason to limit yourself to all the problems that are inherent in doing live audio.

508
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,304
Scott: Yeah, it's like why.

509
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:30,030
Scott: it's like if you're not doing a live concert or a live radio show you have the luxury of Being able to edit it before you give it out to the world.

510
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,760
Scott: Why would you deny yourself a luxury?

511
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:36,214
Scott: That's like going to a store and they say free ice cream and you say no.

512
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:36,676
Scott: Thank you.

513
00:38:37,178 --> 00:38:37,740
Scott: What the hell?

514
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,600
Scott: The only other thing I got to say about this guy is that he's he started actually discussing.

515
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:49,018
Scott: I actually listened to one of the shows long enough for him to discuss a topic and he was talking about why.

516
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:50,546
Scott: someone asked Him in an email.

517
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:52,640
Scott: I can't believe someone emailed him why?

518
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Scott: People were all excited about you know new Pokemon games, but they weren't excited about smash brothers brawl Which is kind of a weird question, but he started to answer it and his answer just made no sense.

519
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:09,393
Scott: There was no logic to his answer at all.

520
00:39:09,554 --> 00:39:17,028
Scott: It was I don't know I don't know what he was trying to say, but it was either wrong or Pointless or meaningless.

521
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:21,799
Rym: Yeah, honestly if I weren't tired I would have pulled up that audio and played it just so you could hear it.

522
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,713
Rym: But I got enough audio clips to deal with here.

523
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:26,199
Scott: Yeah, so she moved to the next show.

524
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:31,320
Rym: I think so because pretty much from this point on we're going down into the debt.

525
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:35,713
Scott: All right, the next podcast up for bashing is anime pulse.

526
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:37,077
Scott: I am Ichigo.

527
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:48,086
Scott: I'm Bato Charlie Max help me out.

528
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:49,191
Scott: You're gonna get.

529
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:51,419
Scott: you're gonna get phalons calendar way.

530
00:39:58,406 --> 00:40:07,831
Scott: No new new Okay fine, so this is the anime pulse podcast and We are here bringing you the love do I do?

531
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:09,677
Scott: do I need to step it up a notch or something like that?

532
00:40:09,978 --> 00:40:10,279
Rym: BAM I?

533
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,145
Rym: Still got plenty of water.

534
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:17,130
Scott: What you said you're gonna?

535
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:33,431
Scott: The story revolves around a young girl named coup coup coup, okay a Shirotori.

536
00:40:33,773 --> 00:40:37,527
Rym: this was submitted to us by Gabe, and I'm not gonna read his whole paragraph.

537
00:40:37,748 --> 00:40:38,350
Rym: It's not very long.

538
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:42,645
Rym: He says that the show is a lot of potential basically and that they could live up to.

539
00:40:42,665 --> 00:40:49,450
Rym: I guess all the accolades He's heard about them except for the fact that quote they deliberately talk over each other during their segments.

540
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:58,444
Rym: It pisses me off to no end between that and their propensity to eat directly into the microphone I want to rip my hair out and shove down their bleeding maws.

541
00:40:58,464 --> 00:40:59,047
Rym: all right.

542
00:40:59,067 --> 00:40:59,147
Scott: Well.

543
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:01,295
Scott: Let's talk about Well anime pulse.

544
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:02,760
Scott: Let's see I listened to episode 73 and 69.

545
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:10,368
Rym: I'd heard of anime pulse But I didn't really know who did it and I had never actually heard it until it was submitted to our contest.

546
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:13,159
Scott: yep Episode 69 was about 90 minutes long.

547
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:21,909
Scott: I listened to about 10 minutes and 36 seconds and Episode 73 was little over an hour, and I was able to listen for seven minutes before force.

548
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,937
Scott: I couldn't listen anymore now.

549
00:41:23,977 --> 00:41:31,263
Rym: This is where it gets interesting because anime pulse is audio quality Technically is far superior to many of these other podcasts.

550
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:32,930
Scott: Yeah, it was actually pretty good.

551
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,278
Scott: they still had the problem of.

552
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:39,499
Scott: music is a lot louder than talking and You know some of the volumes would be kind of uneven.

553
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:40,984
Scott: one guy louder than another guy.

554
00:41:41,004 --> 00:41:43,717
Scott: well part of that guy moving farther away And closer to the mic.

555
00:41:43,757 --> 00:41:51,570
Rym: it's obvious that they have one Omnidirectional mic in the room and they all just kind of talk at it And they make a lot of noise in the background.

556
00:41:51,871 --> 00:41:57,950
Rym: Constantly people are poking at things and popping at things and eating and I hear stuff going on and things bumping into other things.

557
00:41:58,532 --> 00:42:01,886
Rym: But other than that the audio quality is better than most podcasts out there.

558
00:42:02,348 --> 00:42:11,349
Rym: however Despite that and they're relatively high production values It's obvious that they don't edit at all or if they do they leave a lot in that they shouldn't leave in.

559
00:42:11,831 --> 00:42:16,443
Rym: Lot of pausing um's and ah's and just the podcast trails off constantly.

560
00:42:16,945 --> 00:42:18,990
Rym: and the worst thing is one of the guys in the background.

561
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:22,621
Rym: It's like he constantly just yells random things.

562
00:42:22,661 --> 00:42:22,901
Scott: Yes.

563
00:42:23,002 --> 00:42:23,644
Scott: There's a guy.

564
00:42:23,704 --> 00:42:25,248
Scott: I don't know who it is chocolate.

565
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:37,213
Rym: Yeah They just yell out Yeah chicken, it's just not funny at all It's just annoying.

566
00:42:37,273 --> 00:42:52,947
Scott: this podcast in general it felt to me like they had a lot of intentionally planned out jokes beforehand Or a lot of like they just had impulsive jokes You know like they thought they were being spontaneous like haha spontaneous funny thing.

567
00:42:52,967 --> 00:42:55,438
Scott: that just came to mind But none of it was funny.

568
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,630
Scott: It was just incredibly annoying.

569
00:42:58,691 --> 00:43:03,590
Scott: These are the kind of guys it was obviously apparent after listening to this shows for a few minutes.

570
00:43:03,851 --> 00:43:12,067
Scott: You know when you go to an anime convention and you stand in line and a guy comes up to you And he just starts talking at you, and this is not a guy you want to talk to.

571
00:43:12,087 --> 00:43:12,830
Scott: he's an annoying guy.

572
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:19,310
Scott: He's saying things you don't care about he's telling you about his hentai collection or whatever and you just want him to go away.

573
00:43:19,893 --> 00:43:23,290
Scott: This podcast anime pulse is made by those kind of guys.

574
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:27,380
Scott: It's just three of those guys talking to each other now.

575
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:32,087
Rym: aside from that it takes them forever to get to what they actually talk About and to not go into a lot of detail.

576
00:43:32,872 --> 00:43:36,504
Rym: Whenever they get finally on topic they actually do what their shows about they were.

577
00:43:36,545 --> 00:43:37,548
Scott: I never got to that point.

578
00:43:37,588 --> 00:43:45,581
Rym: so tell me I forced myself to listen to a whole episode and then half of another episode And then I went to a third episode and skip to the review part.

579
00:43:45,862 --> 00:43:51,038
Rym: whoa they review shallow anime And they review it in a shallow manner.

580
00:43:51,279 --> 00:43:57,056
Rym: so not only do they watch shows that are the equivalent of kagehime They're just garbage anime.

581
00:43:57,297 --> 00:44:01,590
Rym: There's shows that we watch the first episode of and they're not even worth talking about on the show.

582
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:02,695
Rym: They're just garbage.

583
00:44:02,956 --> 00:44:03,097
Scott: Well.

584
00:44:03,137 --> 00:44:06,110
Scott: I mean are they reviewing them in the Dave and Joel style of wow this suck.

585
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:07,460
Rym: No, they're reviewing them in the.

586
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,239
Rym: I really like this anime And they rate it on this scale.

587
00:44:11,259 --> 00:44:19,350
Rym: they rate every anime, and I haven't figured out the scale But I've heard such ratings as burn it crackers and like super crackers.

588
00:44:20,552 --> 00:44:23,766
Scott: so I guess crackers is good and burn it is bad something like that.

589
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,593
Rym: and The anime.

590
00:44:25,613 --> 00:44:29,587
Rym: the review is just abhorrent and terrible and they don't provide any insight.

591
00:44:29,608 --> 00:44:34,242
Rym: like the reviews Are could be okay if you took a bad show and reviewed it fully.

592
00:44:34,543 --> 00:44:35,847
Rym: like anime world order does.

593
00:44:36,148 --> 00:44:36,610
Rym: it'd be good.

594
00:44:37,131 --> 00:44:43,650
Rym: But they review it in such a shallow manner that I would learn more by reading the frickin Wikipedia about that show.

595
00:44:44,091 --> 00:44:46,480
Scott: Okay, like what do they just say what happened in the show?

596
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,985
Scott: like this show is about blah.

597
00:44:48,326 --> 00:44:49,290
Scott: This is what happened.

598
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:51,557
Scott: yeah, the main themes of the show or this?

599
00:44:51,597 --> 00:44:57,082
Rym: the main genres are that and they kind of trail off a lot and they focus on fan service bids.

600
00:44:57,647 --> 00:45:00,060
Rym: and It's just I. it's bad.

601
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,070
Scott: Those are the people who like fan service.

602
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:06,121
Rym: They like the kind of shows that we make fun of as being stupid.

603
00:45:06,923 --> 00:45:09,370
Scott: ah so they're the reason anime sucks in the u.s.

604
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,980
Scott: I buy it all this shit now.

605
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,210
Scott: I know who to beat up at the next convention.

606
00:45:14,672 --> 00:45:32,184
Rym: They also really seem pro bootleg And there's a whole bit in one of the recent episodes where they were talking about fansub groups And they seem to get mad if a show gets licensed and the fansubbers stop fansubbing Like they got mad at some fansubbing group for dropping their fansubs.

607
00:45:32,244 --> 00:45:37,081
Rym: if I think it was death note after I got licensed Cuz it was licensed fools.

608
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:38,710
Rym: They also spend a lot of time.

609
00:45:38,991 --> 00:45:51,070
Rym: They watch one piece Naruto in bleach, and they review the most recent episode which basically comes down to So so and so far so and so and it was awesome and then so and so far so and so and it was awesome.

610
00:45:51,351 --> 00:46:00,508
Scott: All right listen if you're someone who likes those shows you're gonna watch them, and if you watch them I mean they could be just summed up in like a few sentences like so and so far so and so so.

611
00:46:00,528 --> 00:46:03,710
Scott: I guess if you Like those shows you don't want to spend the time to watch them.

612
00:46:04,051 --> 00:46:07,469
Scott: That's a decent service because now you don't have to watch 30 minutes.

613
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,619
Scott: You can get the whole thing in two minutes from these guys.

614
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:14,798
Scott: however if you don't like those shows You really don't want someone describing them to you.

615
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:18,690
Scott: Yeah, if you do watch the shows you don't need someone describing them to you.

616
00:46:19,131 --> 00:46:20,458
Scott: So who is that for?

617
00:46:20,618 --> 00:46:20,940
Scott: really?

618
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,869
Scott: it's for people who like it, but don't want to watch it Which is so few people now again?

619
00:46:25,031 --> 00:46:28,457
Rym: It would be okay if They at least provided some insight.

620
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:38,690
Rym: or I mean I could see where if you watch the show and you've talked about it every week You could provide a lot of running commentary or insight or point out like notice how this character is fighting with this character.

621
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:44,088
Rym: But yet he says this line well if you go back to episode 23 remember that dream sequence.

622
00:46:44,489 --> 00:46:49,220
Rym: yeah That's where they're going with this metaphor metaphor or things like that.

623
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:58,369
Scott: or the music in this episode was actually done by so-and-so as a Blah-blah-blah, but I think the problem is is that these shows are so shallow that those things just don't exist to be talked about.

624
00:46:58,831 --> 00:47:00,737
Rym: But they could do more.

625
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,710
Rym: I stand by the statement that they review shallow anime in a shallow manner.

626
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:19,027
Rym: Yeah, I beyond all that the best part Clarissa from anime roll order went nuts about Complaining that Scott was supposedly sexist because he asked if some manga Was why some manga that was in a shonen magazine was published in shoujo magazine.

627
00:47:19,048 --> 00:47:19,650
Rym: none of that matters.

628
00:47:20,031 --> 00:47:29,453
Rym: We talked about it yesterday, but if she wants to get mad about sexist anime podcasters I submit the following from anime fucking pulse We like see.

629
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:30,215
Scott: we like CPM.

630
00:47:30,476 --> 00:47:31,218
Scott: John's a good guy.

631
00:47:31,238 --> 00:47:32,301
Scott: I'm good guy.

632
00:47:32,562 --> 00:47:35,390
Scott: his wife runs a yaoi label called be beautiful.

633
00:47:35,754 --> 00:47:36,624
Scott: I'm not too thrilled with that.

634
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:40,481
Scott: Well, you know you gotta let the women have their side projects.

635
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:46,199
Scott: Oh, yeah, this is purely a guy's Thing but then they'll turn around and you're like wait a minute.

636
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:46,400
Scott: No.

637
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:54,010
Scott: This is this is something for the girls Something for the ladies, but you know, it's out of a shonen magazine.

638
00:47:54,211 --> 00:48:01,226
Scott: I really have a hard time seeing this being in a shonen magazine, honestly Crab chips.

639
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:13,687
Scott: And one of the things that makes me really think that this is more of a girl's anime or girls story is because it revolves around her life and the way she sees things.

640
00:48:13,868 --> 00:48:24,030
Scott: and and one of the things that helped me think that this was more a Series for girls was like the animation styling.

641
00:48:25,351 --> 00:48:27,920
Scott: The girls were drawn very beautifully, but so were the guys.

642
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:33,388
Scott: like the guys are sound very very be shown it You know, they use a lot of pastel colors.

643
00:48:34,753 --> 00:48:43,588
Scott: but then you get these moments of Purely guy thing where like you got the one girl gonna be helping another girl have a bath, you know scrubbing your back for whoo.

644
00:48:45,031 --> 00:48:54,655
Scott: I couldn't figure out who this was written for because there's a lot of action in it But at the same time they're sitting there and they're discussing the feelings of something or you know These relate to each other.

645
00:48:54,695 --> 00:48:56,681
Scott: It's like this isn't what goes on in an action.

646
00:48:56,882 --> 00:48:58,768
Rym: So there is action in it.

647
00:48:58,808 --> 00:49:04,370
Scott: Yes But there's a lot of dialogue that has nothing to do with the shonen.

648
00:49:05,332 --> 00:49:08,048
Rym: So, uh, I expect a tirade next week.

649
00:49:08,189 --> 00:49:08,330
Rym: Yes

650
00:49:08,832 --> 00:49:25,012
Scott: The only other things I could say about anime policy is to seal it up is that they read every single email Regardless of whether it's useful or not which is annoying as hell and It seems like only one guy on the show has command and the other people are just the interrupting guys and those interrupting guys Have to go.

651
00:49:25,354 --> 00:49:29,229
Scott: if this one guy just did the show in his own it would probably double the quality.

652
00:49:29,249 --> 00:49:30,308
Scott: still I wouldn't listen to it.

653
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,568
Scott: I wouldn't listen to it still because it still wouldn't be good.

654
00:49:33,091 --> 00:49:38,130
Scott: But maybe if he got another co-host that was intelligent then he could have a show might be worth listening.

655
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:38,917
Rym: That's all he needs to do.

656
00:49:38,978 --> 00:49:40,250
Rym: get rid of all those other people.

657
00:49:40,552 --> 00:49:49,128
Rym: maybe get one or two other new people who are good or just do the show himself and Do a little bit of research and have any Any more insight than he currently has.

658
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:59,330
Rym: yeah Because even if he doesn't go to the depth that like anime world order does or the hilarity that David Joel do in the very Least he's reviewing stuff that most people wouldn't review.

659
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:07,099
Rym: There aren't many podcasts about that kind of anime and while I don't like that kind of anime if you reviewed that kind of anime Well and had some insight.

660
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,550
Rym: It'd probably be okay and you'd have a market.

661
00:50:10,314 --> 00:50:11,300
Rym: All right all right.

662
00:50:11,461 --> 00:50:13,452
Rym: now further into the rabbit hole We're gonna.

663
00:50:13,513 --> 00:50:15,062
Scott: we're gonna talk about a podcast now.

664
00:50:15,163 --> 00:50:19,546
Scott: that was the first one I listened to of all the bunch and as soon as I listened to it.

665
00:50:19,586 --> 00:50:20,390
Scott: I said this is the winner.

666
00:50:20,571 --> 00:50:23,843
Scott: This is the worst podcast that anyone submitted, but I was wrong now.

667
00:50:23,903 --> 00:50:25,770
Scott: There are worse podcasts that were submitted.

668
00:50:26,013 --> 00:50:27,630
Rym: We don't have to say a lot about it.

669
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:33,375
Rym: I'm just gonna play an opening bid from it here, and I think you will gather everything.

670
00:50:33,435 --> 00:50:44,939
Rym: We will have to say oh Recorded live here we go.

671
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:16,679
Scott: Welcome to this episode of Animal Crossing and other games.

672
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:08,069
Rym: Hello, everybody.

673
00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:12,327
Scott: This is episode 25 Titled Pogo Island DS.

674
00:52:13,351 --> 00:52:15,239
Rym: Which is the game we're going to talk about?

675
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:29,385
Scott: It is an exchange for tickets and drawings for prizes.

676
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:47,414
Scott: There are three types of free accounts, which is the $50 daily the $250 weekly The $1,000 monthly.

677
00:52:49,581 --> 00:52:53,212
Scott: Now for the clone Pogo members, which are the paid accounts?

678
00:52:53,814 --> 00:52:55,960
Rym: you have the those three drawings?

679
00:52:57,509 --> 00:53:14,198
Scott: and you have the This miscellaneous drawing which will have something random usually of around a $500 value And the current one is a scrapbook game.

680
00:53:16,783 --> 00:53:19,140
Scott: The podcast is called Animal Crossing and other games.

681
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:24,479
Scott: I listened to episode 3 which is about Halo 2 and episode 25 about Pogo Island DS.

682
00:53:25,361 --> 00:53:25,945
Scott: I listened to.

683
00:53:25,965 --> 00:53:28,620
Scott: let's see the episode 3 was 10 minutes long.

684
00:53:28,761 --> 00:53:34,774
Scott: I turned it off after 4 minutes and episode 25 was 16 minutes long And I also turned it off after 4 minutes.

685
00:53:35,399 --> 00:53:40,258
Rym: now I give this kid props for trying and I don't know what else I can say.

686
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:46,620
Rym: really He if his audio quality were better That'd be a big step because you can't really even understand what he's saying.

687
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:55,266
Scott: No, this guy is doing his podcast with talk shoe, which is that thing that lets you have listener partition participation and such But he's not using it.

688
00:53:55,347 --> 00:54:04,747
Scott: Well because I've heard you know twit uses talk shoe now To do stuff and their audio quality is still awesome, so this guy is doing something He's basically not caring about.

689
00:54:04,827 --> 00:54:07,599
Scott: audio quality is constant hissing and static.

690
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:13,939
Scott: I mean episode 25 had worse audio quality than episode 3. he blows into the mic.

691
00:54:14,622 --> 00:54:18,099
Scott: It's just God if the audio quality here is the worst audio quality.

692
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:19,884
Rym: now Here's another interesting point.

693
00:54:20,185 --> 00:54:26,463
Rym: anime pulse has good production quality if the content was to in our opinion in a word Garbage.

694
00:54:26,965 --> 00:54:40,560
Rym: by the same token this kid has probably the worst audio quality in podcasting and yet and yet his show is Relatively coherent and together and he's obviously trying to keep it in what a single thread.

695
00:54:40,943 --> 00:54:50,339
Rym: He's got his little topics and segues He's he's got his act together better than the audio quality would lead you to believe yes The thing is his voice is really nerdy.

696
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:55,977
Scott: He says uh a lot and I mean he talks about Halo 2 for 10 minutes.

697
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,288
Scott: I mean, what are you gonna say in 10 minutes?

698
00:54:59,449 --> 00:55:00,251
Scott: That's not very.

699
00:55:00,272 --> 00:55:04,911
Scott: you know he doesn't say anything meaningful But he's obviously trying really hard.

700
00:55:05,233 --> 00:55:08,680
Scott: he obviously cares He's obviously putting in the effort.

701
00:55:09,102 --> 00:55:09,443
Scott: It's just.

702
00:55:09,805 --> 00:55:10,408
Scott: I think that's.

703
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,880
Scott: I don't know if he has more potential than that.

704
00:55:13,081 --> 00:55:15,779
Scott: I mean you might have just be that's the best he can do.

705
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:19,800
Scott: It could be that he doesn't sound like he's a kid that can do much more than that.

706
00:55:20,021 --> 00:55:24,480
Scott: He also sounds like a really young kid like he must be in elementary or middle school probably.

707
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:32,892
Scott: So maybe this is the best a middle school podcast can be but a middle school podcast Is still not as good as a better podcast.

708
00:55:32,932 --> 00:55:33,052
Rym: now.

709
00:55:33,072 --> 00:55:35,340
Rym: this was submitted by water is poison and quote.

710
00:55:35,722 --> 00:55:38,340
Rym: I present to you the animal crossing and other games podcast.

711
00:55:38,762 --> 00:55:42,240
Rym: I'm not exactly sure what it is about because it's too hard to listen to.

712
00:55:43,162 --> 00:55:43,885
Rym: He goes on a bit.

713
00:55:44,146 --> 00:55:47,319
Rym: the episodes range from one minute long to an hour and a half.

714
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,787
Scott: Really I didn't see any of those hour-and-a-half ones.

715
00:55:49,907 --> 00:55:50,589
Rym: I didn't try.

716
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:53,899
Rym: okay now you might think well isn't that the bottom?

717
00:55:56,463 --> 00:55:57,710
Scott: No it is not the bottom.

718
00:55:58,092 --> 00:56:01,652
Scott: now we got two left here I want to talk about but one of them might be ineligible.

719
00:56:01,672 --> 00:56:03,240
Scott: you want to talk about the ineligible one first?

720
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:16,654
Rym: Yeah We'll do that one first because if this Podcast had met the rules of submission and the person who submitted it even stated straight up that it does not meet the rules of submission But it was so bad that there was no way it couldn't be brought up.

721
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:18,480
Rym: and good fucking God.

722
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,908
Scott: Yes, so the podcast that was.

723
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:28,956
Scott: if this was eligible to win the contest according to the rules We mentioned at the beginning when we announced the contest originally this would be the winner.

724
00:56:28,996 --> 00:56:31,143
Scott: this would be the worst podcast I've ever heard also.

725
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:36,700
Rym: It was submitted by the one the only Jeff to Tarek whoa Jeff to Terry and quote.

726
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:37,743
Rym: I'll read his whole email.

727
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:40,049
Rym: I nominate the i-game podcast.

728
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:45,432
Rym: it hasn't been updated since August 2006 so it's automatically ineligible But I don't care.

729
00:56:45,452 --> 00:56:46,560
Rym: Why is it bad?

730
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:51,937
Rym: It's little more than some kids talking shit over their cell phones acting cooler than they could possibly be.

731
00:56:52,258 --> 00:56:54,573
Rym: not only that But they just talk all over each other.

732
00:56:54,593 --> 00:56:55,400
Rym: It's painful.

733
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:02,428
Scott: Basically I listened to episode 21 and I listened to another episode which didn't have a number But was called our debate.

734
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,720
Scott: the our debate episode was four minutes.

735
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,884
Scott: I didn't last to.

736
00:57:06,386 --> 00:57:08,494
Scott: the episode 21 was 13 minutes.

737
00:57:08,655 --> 00:57:09,879
Scott: I lasted less than two.

738
00:57:10,723 --> 00:57:11,345
Scott: It's though.

739
00:57:11,927 --> 00:57:15,160
Scott: It's the audio quality might be actually worse than the Animal Crossing guy.

740
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:18,995
Scott: It's all scratchy and and it just.

741
00:57:19,076 --> 00:57:20,120
Scott: it just couldn't be worse.

742
00:57:20,622 --> 00:57:20,722
Scott: It's.

743
00:57:20,923 --> 00:57:23,532
Scott: it really does sound like kids talking over their cell phones.

744
00:57:23,572 --> 00:57:27,504
Rym: like Jeff says there isn't actually a show It's just nothing.

745
00:57:28,005 --> 00:57:29,208
Rym: I listen to one episode.

746
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:29,930
Rym: It's just.

747
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:35,059
Scott: it sounds like elementary school kids yelling at each other about Nothing.

748
00:57:36,002 --> 00:57:42,493
Scott: It's like if you had a conference call with some fifth graders And they were talking about who was smarter.

749
00:57:42,513 --> 00:57:45,725
Scott: that go brainy brainy poo Stupidy doo-doo head.

750
00:57:45,825 --> 00:57:47,972
Rym: now the worst thing about this is that there's.

751
00:57:48,072 --> 00:57:50,560
Rym: no I couldn't find the podcast at first.

752
00:57:50,661 --> 00:57:57,720
Scott: I had some trouble because there are a bunch of other Podcasts also called I game and there are a bunch of other things called I game that aren't podcasts.

753
00:57:58,543 --> 00:58:03,680
Rym: And when I went to download it so I could grab some clips the link was broken, and it was gone.

754
00:58:04,123 --> 00:58:13,211
Rym: Luckily, it's still on my iPod Again.

755
00:58:34,201 --> 00:58:36,351
Rym: Humidity there, but still it's hot.

756
00:58:36,552 --> 00:58:37,256
Rym: let's skip a bit.

757
00:58:37,316 --> 00:58:51,427
Rym: Maybe it gets better Based on science or whatever Except ninja consultant who is revealing this?

758
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:52,551
Rym: please all right?

759
00:58:52,651 --> 00:58:53,594
Rym: I can't I can't.

760
00:58:54,437 --> 00:58:55,340
Rym: I had to turn that off.

761
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,639
Scott: It's just kids yapping at each other.

762
00:58:58,061 --> 00:59:03,600
Scott: There's nothing that human beings want to listen to less than kids yapping at each other.

763
00:59:04,202 --> 00:59:07,855
Scott: Me even Bill Cosby said it best when he said parents don't want justice.

764
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:08,980
Scott: They just want quiet.

765
00:59:10,362 --> 00:59:12,290
Scott: We don't want to listen to kids talking.

766
00:59:12,611 --> 00:59:14,499
Scott: shut up kids shut up now.

767
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,412
Scott: Now it was I don't.

768
00:59:18,432 --> 00:59:24,002
Rym: it's hard to describe how painful it was to try to listen to this and I Tried.

769
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:28,799
Rym: I resolved that I was gonna listen to all of at least one episode of everything that anyone submitted.

770
00:59:28,919 --> 00:59:30,489
Scott: well You're a braver soul than I.

771
00:59:30,751 --> 00:59:35,599
Rym: I made it 45 Seconds on this and whoa I lasted a few minutes.

772
00:59:37,645 --> 00:59:46,760
Rym: Only reason I made it 45 seconds was that I was going down the taconic at about 90 miles an hour And there was some traffic ahead, and you couldn't reach it to turn it off.

773
00:59:46,981 --> 00:59:50,134
Rym: I could not take my hand off the wheel to stop it.

774
00:59:51,459 --> 00:59:53,104
Rym: I Couldn't make it stop.

775
00:59:53,585 --> 01:00:01,300
Rym: so Jeff to Tarik even though you cannot win the contest you're going to be getting a prize anyway Because I'm not sure how you found it.

776
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,930
Rym: I knew what it was and I had trouble finding it.

777
01:00:04,171 --> 01:00:06,360
Rym: you gave me a link and I had trouble finding it.

778
01:00:06,822 --> 01:00:10,280
Rym: This is probably the worst audio on the internet.

779
01:00:10,721 --> 01:00:12,889
Scott: It just if it's not.

780
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:21,657
Scott: I'd like to see what is because goddamn well I anything worse than this starts to get crosses the line where you know it's like you don't have.

781
01:00:21,697 --> 01:00:22,640
Scott: some things are so bad.

782
01:00:22,681 --> 01:00:25,952
Rym: They're good, right Yeah, like if you watch an old robot show.

783
01:00:26,434 --> 01:00:27,922
Rym: most people don't pretend They're good.

784
01:00:28,022 --> 01:00:32,799
Rym: even people who love robot shows won't say with a straight face that this is some deep meaningful show.

785
01:00:33,342 --> 01:00:38,160
Rym: Some of them are but not many yeah, but many of them aren't and most you know which ones are rich.

786
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,451
Scott: Yes, but yeah, this is basically.

787
01:00:41,711 --> 01:00:44,360
Scott: you're about to cross the line where it's so bad.

788
01:00:44,461 --> 01:00:46,719
Scott: It's good, but they didn't cross the line.

789
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:50,167
Scott: It's just so bad and it's the worst there is.

790
01:00:50,408 --> 01:00:58,914
Rym: and the reason Animal Crossing and other games is better than this is Because at least that was a show Regardless of the problems the kids having doing his show.

791
01:00:59,316 --> 01:01:00,059
Rym: it was a show.

792
01:01:00,381 --> 01:01:01,365
Rym: There is a concept.

793
01:01:01,566 --> 01:01:03,334
Rym: the kid is following through with the concept.

794
01:01:03,595 --> 01:01:08,794
Rym: He has a format He talks in an order that somewhat makes sense.

795
01:01:09,296 --> 01:01:10,560
Scott: Yeah, this is just nothing.

796
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:13,511
Scott: This is just kids talking to each other all right.

797
01:01:13,933 --> 01:01:18,126
Scott: now the worst Podcast that was submitted to us.

798
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:19,730
Rym: What's the deal with these?

799
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:27,331
Scott: bad vodka that is eligible for the contest according to our Rules is called powerup now.

800
01:01:27,813 --> 01:01:31,837
Rym: I'm just gonna play a clip, and I think well I don't know what else we'll need to say.

801
01:01:33,361 --> 01:01:58,262
Scott: All views expressed in this podcast and not a video game buddy and belong to the participants of powerup My nose Good computer to 1999.

802
01:01:58,262 --> 01:02:06,574
Rym: Like they're pumping money into these businesses like it's going out of style making the rich richer making themselves poorer stupider and fatter.

803
01:02:06,594 --> 01:02:08,598
Rym: and God bless America.

804
01:02:12,806 --> 01:02:14,179
Scott: And what's up everybody?

805
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:18,584
Scott: Like wacka's Today.

806
01:02:18,805 --> 01:02:28,755
Scott: for all you probably people that listen to us on the weekly base You broke up real badly, I broke up really.

807
01:02:29,116 --> 01:02:31,545
Scott: yeah, yeah, hey well I didn't hear it.

808
01:02:31,565 --> 01:02:33,416
Scott: I heard music the whole time.

809
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:35,960
Rym: You heard nothing.

810
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:41,499
Scott: Well, maybe that was the sound effect I was going for.

811
01:02:43,322 --> 01:02:44,125
Rym: Hey, who's that guy?

812
01:02:44,607 --> 01:02:47,798
Scott: we already completed another episode of powerup because I wasn't paying attention to the sounds.

813
01:02:48,501 --> 01:02:51,432
Scott: Yeah, it's hard.

814
01:02:51,492 --> 01:02:52,416
Scott: I'm getting fucking.

815
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:53,299
Scott: I am again by.

816
01:02:59,081 --> 01:03:01,309
Rym: It's basically as far as I can tell.

817
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:04,439
Rym: imagine if you gave a bunch of 14 year olds phones

818
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:05,903
Scott: Yep, and then

819
01:03:06,364 --> 01:03:13,844
Rym: you set up some sort of Big Brother spy thing where whenever they had a conference call with each other You just recorded it,

820
01:03:14,145 --> 01:03:17,879
Scott: and they're all friends, so they have stuff to talk about that with each other.

821
01:03:18,481 --> 01:03:19,263
Scott: That's powerup.

822
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:20,686
Scott: That's it now.

823
01:03:20,867 --> 01:03:22,050
Scott: What's good about powerup.

824
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:22,832
Scott: There is one thing.

825
01:03:22,852 --> 01:03:23,353
Scott: That's good.

826
01:03:23,814 --> 01:03:26,100
Scott: their opening music was actually relevant.

827
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:29,940
Scott: It was an OC remix of some sort, but they played the same one for every episode.

828
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:31,514
Scott: I thought they were gonna mix it up, but they didn't.

829
01:03:31,736 --> 01:03:35,127
Scott: nah Let's see why was this podcast so bad.

830
01:03:35,188 --> 01:03:37,494
Scott: Let's see everyone has an annoying voice.

831
01:03:37,755 --> 01:03:39,380
Scott: the audio quality is terrible.

832
01:03:39,641 --> 01:03:42,092
Scott: They even said that they don't care about audio quality.

833
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:43,900
Scott: They don't edit and they're proud of it.

834
01:03:44,241 --> 01:03:49,600
Scott: They have to say I don't know if it's the same guy, but it might as well be the same interrupting guy from anime pulse.

835
01:03:50,421 --> 01:03:56,968
Scott: they spent like a lot of time just making fun of each other as People would if they knew each other.

836
01:03:57,370 --> 01:04:00,040
Scott: and why do I want to listen to other people make fun of each other?

837
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:06,946
Scott: I don't know how they have a girl on this show, but they treat the girl like shit and the girl just Talks to them like you know.

838
01:04:07,328 --> 01:04:08,011
Scott: blah blah blah.

839
01:04:08,031 --> 01:04:12,252
Scott: you guys are all just pissed cuz I'm not with you And she doesn't say anything interesting.

840
01:04:12,312 --> 01:04:13,640
Scott: none of them say anything interesting.

841
01:04:13,961 --> 01:04:22,649
Rym: It's like being in a room with a bunch of 14 year olds who are two feet shorter than you and think they're tougher than You and they're all talking shit to each other.

842
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:24,415
Scott: They're all have different volume levels.

843
01:04:24,636 --> 01:04:25,780
Scott: They all have annoying voices.

844
01:04:26,101 --> 01:04:29,712
Scott: They spend the entire pod well as much of the podcast as I listen to.

845
01:04:30,053 --> 01:04:32,400
Scott: they pretty much just bickered the entire time.

846
01:04:32,963 --> 01:04:35,316
Rym: Isn't this the one that has really freaking long episodes?

847
01:04:35,336 --> 01:04:39,492
Scott: - yes Episode 25 was two and a half hours long.

848
01:04:39,693 --> 01:04:41,640
Scott: I lasted less than four minutes.

849
01:04:42,222 --> 01:04:45,597
Scott: Episode 60 was two hours and 49 minutes long.

850
01:04:46,721 --> 01:04:48,506
Scott: I lasted five minutes.

851
01:04:49,268 --> 01:04:52,578
Scott: that the worst part of this podcast is actually something very specific.

852
01:04:52,959 --> 01:05:04,960
Rym: in episode 60 some guy was making horrible mouth noises into the microphone like ah Actually that happens a lot in anime pulse, but yes, not nearly as badly.

853
01:05:05,181 --> 01:05:07,532
Scott: Did you just listen to me making those math noises right now?

854
01:05:07,733 --> 01:05:09,059
Scott: wasn't that incredibly painful ah?

855
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:11,602
Scott: Stop doing that again.

856
01:05:11,923 --> 01:05:13,306
Rym: Yeah, yeah, and keep in mind.

857
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:16,835
Rym: That's with a downward expander getting rid of much of that.

858
01:05:16,855 --> 01:05:24,749
Scott: yeah um I just made That is the worst noise One of the worst noises you could possibly make.

859
01:05:24,809 --> 01:05:31,359
Scott: I mean they might as well have made a podcast of chalkboard scratch Nails on a chalkboard and it would have been just as bad.

860
01:05:31,941 --> 01:05:43,802
Scott: Just the noise that is coming out of the headphones listening to power-up makes me want to put a knife in my ear and I'm almost would have put a knife in my ear if it weren't for the ability to turn it off Which I did.

861
01:05:44,223 --> 01:05:49,478
Rym: now of course we just did a show here on worst podcast ever and power-up wins the contest.

862
01:05:49,959 --> 01:05:59,899
Rym: however Because I'm totally unprofessional now in a stroke of irony I actually don't have the email with the submission in front of me, so I don't know who submitted it really.

863
01:05:59,919 --> 01:06:02,099
Rym: however I can look that up handily.

864
01:06:02,785 --> 01:06:03,872
Scott: Okay, I found it.

865
01:06:04,275 --> 01:06:06,121
Scott: the winner is DJ.

01:06:06,342 --> 01:06:07,566
Rym: Jen I DJ.

Scott: all right two GeekNights.

870
01:06:15,861 --> 01:06:19,414

871
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:19,915
Rym: Oh here.

872
01:06:19,936 --> 01:06:21,200
Rym: It is wow he has nice bullet points.

873
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:25,745
Scott: They have more than 10 minutes just to take care of technical difficulties And they don't edit it out now.

874
01:06:26,006 --> 01:06:31,479
Rym: compare that to Dave and Joel where they often would record themselves having audio Difficulties, but yet it was still funny.

875
01:06:31,812 --> 01:06:34,834
Scott: Yeah Or they'd use that as the like the stinger at the end of the show.

876
01:06:35,356 --> 01:06:38,948
Scott: ah the stinger poor Organization too much steering away from the game topics.

877
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:41,155
Scott: one of the guys shouldn't be on radio at all.

878
01:06:41,255 --> 01:06:46,045
Scott: more of an interference than useful Kind of like chocolate Interrupting guy.

879
01:06:46,065 --> 01:06:53,187
Scott: yeah glitches galore lots of audio crap audio levels Random laptop beeping from overheating.

880
01:06:53,808 --> 01:06:57,338
Scott: sometimes they throw racial jokes slurs handicapped jokes etc.

881
01:06:57,358 --> 01:06:59,998
Rym: a segment But I believe Scott you mean etc.

882
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,282
Scott: Etc.

883
01:07:01,402 --> 01:07:06,019
Rym: I only reason I bring that up because I was gonna rag on two of these podcasts for saying etc.

884
01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:07,807
Rym: wrong And then I forgot to.

885
01:07:08,189 --> 01:07:10,380
Rym: so I had to at least rag on you for that.

886
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:14,010
Scott: Yeah, and a segment where they mentioned games coming soon.

887
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,554
Scott: the girl talks like.

888
01:07:15,594 --> 01:07:19,102
Scott: it's off-core phone sex, and she's underage Outstanding.

889
01:07:19,443 --> 01:07:30,859
Scott: yeah these is basically a bunch of trashy teens talking to each other Occasionally about video games, and it is the worst podcast eligible for our contest.

890
01:07:30,939 --> 01:07:34,075
Scott: DJ Do now you have one and we will send you a prize.

891
01:07:34,276 --> 01:07:47,760
Rym: yes, however We will be contacting all of our finalists and probably sending all of you some form of prize because every one of you did your Part and provided us with a lot of pain a lot of agony, but also a lot of entertainment.

892
01:07:47,921 --> 01:07:52,480
Scott: Yes, do not be surprised if your contest prizes are actually revenge in an envelope.

893
01:07:54,361 --> 01:08:03,025
Rym: Now also again like I said at the beginning one this was all in good fun, and two this is our 289th episode.

894
01:08:03,085 --> 01:08:06,403
Rym: give or take yeah, and We've come a long way.

895
01:08:06,764 --> 01:08:23,218
Rym: I mean GeekNights used to sound like this Sit far away If I talk.

896
01:08:36,303 --> 01:08:40,040
Rym: So we're kind of shot today because all we really want to talk about is Jack Thompson.

897
01:08:44,042 --> 01:08:52,240
Rym: So I don't blame any podcast ever for having trouble getting started And I wish the best of luck to all of our finalists and our finalists submissions.

898
01:08:52,823 --> 01:09:04,947
Scott: however if you're on episode a lot and you haven't improved or in fact you have Not improved and gone downhill from your earlier episodes Just stop.

899
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:13,700
Scott: I mean it's one thing for people to complain about pod fading But in some cases pod fading is the way to go sort of like sometimes just got to put the pet to sleep.

900
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:15,296
Scott: It's it's too sick.

901
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:17,966
Scott: It's better to let it die than to keep it alive.

902
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:27,142
Rym: now our listeners had better be warned because if anyone ever crosses our ire We'll probably just replace our random episodes in our feed with i-game Cuz.

903
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:29,335
Rym: luckily even though it seems to have disappeared.

904
01:09:29,395 --> 01:09:30,140
Rym: Maybe it'll come back.

905
01:09:30,703 --> 01:09:35,285

906
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:39,296
