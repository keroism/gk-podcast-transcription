1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,418
Scott: It's Wednesday January 24th.

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,748
Scott: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:18,340
Scott: tonight We review the anime movie.

4
00:00:18,763 --> 00:00:19,869
Scott: brave story.

5
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:22,106
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:24,596
Rym: So my work today.

7
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:41,300
Rym: usually I don't really worry about this sort of thing But they realize that it would actually be a good idea to listen to me for a change and I needed a you know a toner like a little thing that networking people use to Plug it into one hole and then find the wire that connects to that hole somewhere else in a building.

8
00:00:41,795 --> 00:00:49,020
Scott: Yeah Basically the way it works is you have a wire and this wire goes through the walls and it goes Through pipes and you have no idea.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:01:00,440
Scott: So you have one end of a wire in your hand and you go to the other end where there's some computer and you have Another end of a wire, but how do you know if that end is actually the same wire as the other end?

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,539
Scott: You're holding you have no idea.

11
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:05,687
Rym: Well, I'm not gonna go into the details because it's not Monday night Suffice to say.

12
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,900
Rym: the interesting bit is that at IBM?

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,056
Rym: I often needed such a piece of equipment But I was in a situation where the company was trying not to spend a lot of money.

14
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:21,160
Rym: as a result I tended to be denied whenever I asked for anything more expensive than a plastic screwdriver.

15
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,031
Scott: Wow, unless it was not even a metal screwdriver Well a plastic handled crap screwdriver.

16
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:27,493
Scott: Okay.

17
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:29,219
Rym: I just brought my own stuff in for all that.

18
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:34,774
Rym: But anyway, so here at my new job, I'm thinking you know I need a toner and they say yes, we agree.

19
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:35,399
Rym: You need a toner.

20
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:40,636
Rym: So normally I expect them to just order the cheapest toner like I'm just give it to me.

21
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:41,720
Scott: No, they got a fancy one.

22
00:01:42,443 --> 00:01:46,460
Scott: Even better they got you one of the the things that what's it called the flukes?

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,539
Rym: Yeah, well they come back to me and they say well tell us what kind of toner you want.

24
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:52,984
Scott: And what do you say?

25
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:53,867
Scott: immediately fluke?

26
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:55,673
Rym: Well first I thought you know what?

27
00:01:56,295 --> 00:01:58,847
Rym: No one's ever actually asked me I'll get back to you.

28
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:00,498
Rym: and I did some research and I found two.

29
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:06,818
Rym: I Suggested that I wanted a fluke and a land test Pro which isn't really a toner but is all is just as good.

30
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:11,112
Rym: practically Yeah, and I expected them to say we're not buying you a fluke.

31
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,340
Rym: But no the flukes gonna be here next week.

32
00:02:13,942 --> 00:02:14,785
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

33
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:18,640
Rym: It's so weird to ask for something and a company just says oh, yeah, I'll buy that.

34
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,925
Rym: Yeah, how much money whatever.

35
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:23,840
Scott: for anyone who doesn't know a fluke fluke is a brand.

36
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,885
Rym: Well, this is not right.

37
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:26,534
Rym: This is not the fluke you're thinking of.

38
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:29,064
Rym: Yeah, it is not the $10,000.

39
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:29,765
Scott: No, it's not.

40
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:35,080
Rym: that'll tell you like how whose mom it was of the guy who made the cable.

41
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:37,831
Scott: Exactly, but for anyone who doesn't know fluke is a brand.

42
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:47,760
Scott: They're a company that makes network Testing and electron its equipment for computer guys to test things and it's the best stuff ever.

43
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:58,614
Rym: I mean like Brady pretty much makes the labelers that professionals use for industrial applications and Fluke tends to make all the things that networking professionals use for the networking business.

44
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,520
Scott: Yeah, they're they're really expensive them.

45
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:04,315
Rym: Yeah, well at least on terms of meta tools, I mean or Tronics make them.

46
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:05,339
Rym: I won't get into that.

47
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:07,329
Rym: Yeah, you know we should do Monday on that.

48
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,415
Scott: It sounds good to me.

49
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:09,460
Scott: But today's not Monday.

50
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,180
Rym: It's Wednesday though since it's not terribly related.

51
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:22,169
Rym: But since there seems to be the most overlap of any of our days between Tuesday and Wednesday I would like to note that we have finally played and beaten Warioware smooth moves and we've worked.

52
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:28,100
Scott: Well, I think I need the last elephant whatever Unless that unlocks real multiplayer.

53
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:30,478
Scott: Well, we'll talk about that next week.

54
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:40,968
Rym: Yes I'm somewhat disappointed with Warioware smooth moves and that is despite the fact that the actual micro games are 99% utterly brilliant.

55
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:43,920
Scott: Yeah, and only 1% of them are crap, which is the opposite of monkey ball.

56
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:47,013
Rym: And even the ones that are crap, it's not that they're broken.

57
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:48,520
Rym: It's just that the control.

58
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,799
Scott: There are a couple that are broken.

59
00:03:50,282 --> 00:03:52,451
Rym: Did you try them in the regular mode until you figure it out?

60
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:55,403
Rym: because every one that's been broken for me if I sit Down and try it.

61
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:59,562
Rym: I realized that I just wasn't doing the right kind of motion or I didn't get the game fully All right.

62
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:03,315
Scott: Well, I'll try it with the one that's super broken tomorrow the flaggy one.

63
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,920
Scott: Yes, the what the raising of flag?

64
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:06,398
Rym: I only tried it once I don't know.

65
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:13,257
Rym: Yeah But yeah in actual anime news a lot of people have been talking about this movie paprika including us.

66
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:21,640
Rym: now paprika Looks to be absolutely amazing And the reason we say that is because it is by the the one the only Satoshi khan who is the current?

67
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,248
Scott: It's a modern master of animation.

68
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:26,856
Rym: I mean aside from I mean, there's Miyazaki movies.

69
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:28,180
Rym: I mean you see a movie.

70
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,259
Scott: I think Miyazaki is going down and Satoshi khan's coming up.

71
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:39,429
Rym: What I think that's the current status that the point I was gonna make is just that you look at a Miyazaki movie You go wow, that's a Miyazaki movie.

72
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,618
Scott: You look at a Disney movie and you go goddamn.

73
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:42,240
Scott: That's a Disney movie.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:54,253
Rym: Well, if you look at a Satoshi khan movie, you know exactly even if you don't know his name You know that the same guy did all of let's see perfect blue Millennium actress Tokyo Godfather's paranoia agent.

75
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:56,700
Rym: These are all grade-a anime.

76
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,712
Scott: They are the a-plus anime.

77
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:01,540
Scott: So he has never stepped wrong.

78
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:03,500
Scott: It's like people used to talk about blizzard.

79
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:07,273
Scott: You know the company that makes Warcraft and Starcraft and Diablo and everything.

80
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:11,012
Scott: and they used to talk about how blizzard Never made a bad game.

81
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:12,802
Scott: They were all hits You know.

82
00:05:12,822 --> 00:05:14,489
Scott: and they would talk about valve.

83
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,436
Scott: I guess valve has made some non-hit games But I don't know if that's technically correct, but we talked about it for a while.

84
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:23,887
Scott: Yeah Anyway, Satoshi khan all hits.

85
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:26,775
Scott: I predict all hits for years to come granted.

86
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:32,451
Rym: We have never seen dolos I guess that's true, but I really want to see it because I imagine it's good.

87
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,477
Scott: I imagine it might be.

88
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:38,129
Rym: well paprika It looks to be a very interesting movie.

89
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,160
Rym: You can see the trailers and all sorts of promotional material online.

90
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:46,440
Rym: It looks exactly like you'd expect only better just because technology has improved.

91
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,579
Scott: Yeah, and I just want to point out one thing is that?

92
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:55,460
Scott: The movie was it's animated by madhouse and it's directed by Satoshi khan.

93
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,446
Scott: It's being brought over to the u.s.

94
00:05:57,526 --> 00:06:00,434
Scott: Produced and distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment.

95
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:00,715
Scott: Yep.

96
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:04,937
Scott: Sony classics is the Sony entire in a giant company.

97
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:11,124
Scott: It just proves that no matter how big crappy your company is if it's big enough You'll do at least one thing right.

98
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:13,191
Rym: so to the dude or dudette.

99
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:14,074
Rym: I can't believe.

100
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:15,318
Rym: I just said the word dudette.

101
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:15,860
Rym: who?

102
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,609
Rym: Decided that Sony should do this?

103
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,597
Rym: you are the man?

104
00:06:20,617 --> 00:06:23,738
Scott: well No, well any someone was gonna do it no matter what?

105
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:26,797
Scott: No, it's they're not the man.

106
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:28,505
Scott: all right It doesn't take the man to do this.

107
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:41,898
Rym: what it means is that you are the only person who it doesn't suck in that giant Company because he was smart enough to end Charismatic enough to convince the people who actually make decisions somewhere in Sony That this was the thing you should pick up.

108
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:45,192
Scott: Maybe maybe who knows how that crazy stuff works?

109
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:47,080
Rym: it was since Sony classics is picking up.

110
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:54,360
Rym: It is going to be in America in theaters on May 25th now to most of our listeners who seem to live in bumblefuck.

111
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:59,448
Rym: That's really not gonna help you, but if you live in any metro area I practically guarantee you can see this movie.

112
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:09,720
Scott: if you live in bumblefuck you're gonna have to wait probably till late 2007 maybe even early 2008 when the DVD inevitably comes out and you'll buy it on Amazon if there isn't a best buy.

113
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:13,277
Scott: But yeah the movie came out in Japan on November 25th.

114
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,540
Rym: Oh six and actually it aired in the u.s.

115
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:24,728
Rym: Once in one theater in LA last year solely so that it would be eligible for an Oscar Which it was not nominated.

116
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:26,997
Scott: no instead three crap movies are nominated.

117
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:29,377
Scott: Yeah People don't know shit.

118
00:07:30,143 --> 00:07:32,837
Scott: Sometimes they do yeah sometimes not not usually not.

119
00:07:32,857 --> 00:07:40,277
Scott: in this case I haven't even seen this but I know what is nominated in that category And I can guarantee none of them are gonna beat it.

120
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:48,200
Rym: Quality seeing what I've seen of this movie sets me on fire in the way that few anime have in my entire life.

121
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:54,825
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's rare where I see a show and it's coming, and I don't know anything about the show But I know it's gonna be good.

122
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:57,072
Rym: eskaflowne was one of those I knew.

123
00:07:57,132 --> 00:08:00,222
Rym: eskaflowne was good before I saw a single frame of Animation.

124
00:08:00,242 --> 00:08:05,942
Scott: well it's something I realized just a few minutes ago about Satoshi con and why his stuff is so awesome Is cuz.

125
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:21,299
Scott: I think he might be the only person still left Making anime in the old way not the super old way of the ancient times But the old way of like the 80s and the early 90s when I got in when we all got into anime.

126
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,772
Rym: now We're not talking so much about technique, but more.

127
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:27,060
Rym: I think it's more about like how he approaches his anime.

128
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:46,418
Scott: Yeah, it's you know when you back in the day when I would watch first watch anime I was watching stuff like Akira and Galaxy Express vampire hunter D. Yeah all these sort of sci-fi fantasy surreal epic kind of things and they all gave you this feeling inside when you watch them.

129
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:54,410
Scott: and Satoshi con stuff is the only things that come out now that give that same feeling and I think that's What anime needs to concentrate on more.

130
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:54,671
Scott: well?

131
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:55,355
Scott: He's seen the United States.

132
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,340
Rym: I think there's a lot to that.

133
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,740
Rym: I mean his anime tends to be very while not realistic.

134
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:02,145
Rym: it's the.

135
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:11,376
Rym: the character designs are stylized in a realistic way and Motion tends to be complex, and there's always a lot going on on the screen, and it's it's.

136
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:12,420
Rym: it's wonderful.

137
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:16,113
Rym: Yeah, I really maybe we should just do a show on Satoshi con.

138
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:16,876
Scott: I think we just did.

139
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:28,779
Rym: he's awesome Yeah, so if you have any way to see this movie in a theater on May 25th I highly recommend let you know again around May 25th when we do a show on the movie after seeing.

140
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:28,859
Scott: yes

141
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:30,959
Rym: We'll probably have a Friday night special

142
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:39,842
Scott: Yeah, but anyway if there's an indie theater near you And you know you should go to it now and maybe write them a letter saying hey get this movie Yeah,

143
00:09:40,184 --> 00:09:43,520
Rym: or if you live in New York just go to one of the many theaters the shows anime

144
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:46,577
Scott: Yeah, or any other major city will probably have it all right.

145
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:52,178
Scott: my news There is a comic series by Garth Enix and Garth Ennis never heard of them.

146
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,046
Scott: Garth Ennis is the guy who did preacher.

147
00:09:54,267 --> 00:10:00,035
Scott: no and Derek Robertson who's just the artist I guess It's called the boys never heard of it.

148
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:06,839
Scott: Yeah, and The tagline when they came out with this thing was that it was going to out preacher.

149
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:07,160
Scott: preacher.

150
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,644
Scott: That was the thing they said about it.

151
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:10,750
Scott: That was how they tried to sell it.

152
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:14,040
Rym: that doesn't seem like the best plan anyway.

153
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:22,140
Scott: Well, I haven't read any of it, but they came out with six issues, and I said all right I'll order the trade of all the first six issues.

154
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,300
Scott: It's only gonna cost me like five bucks at the discount and everything and you know I'll see what this is about.

155
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:29,272
Scott: Well DC decided well, it's not.

156
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:30,055
Scott: actually it's.

157
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:35,837
Scott: it's wild storm Which is the same people who print ex machina, but it's a wild storm.

158
00:10:35,938 --> 00:10:36,339
Scott: is DC?

159
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:39,966
Scott: DC just decided to Cancel it just up.

160
00:10:40,026 --> 00:10:41,553
Scott: It's canceled the trades not coming out.

161
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:43,060
Scott: issues 7 through 10 aren't coming out.

162
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,708
Rym: Sorry, did they give any reason why?

163
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,120
Scott: no, but the they didn't say anything.

164
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,641
Scott: They didn't even confirm that they canceled it because they solicited the trade and issues 7 through 10.

165
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:59,300
Scott: But you know apparently it is canceled according to everybody except DC itself, huh?

166
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,409
Rym: I wonder did they realize it wasn't gonna sell was there?

167
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,084
Scott: no it was actually the third best-selling Wildstorm comic.

168
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:06,746
Scott: there are only two.

169
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:09,415
Scott: well what the hell was so better than X?

170
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:10,720
Rym: was there an issue with the IP?

171
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:12,809
Scott: No, the actually here.

172
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:13,814
Scott: Here's how it goes down.

173
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:14,075
Scott: ready.

174
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:21,820
Scott: the suspicion Is that DC canceled it because it was - it was like over the line with its violence and such-and-such.

175
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,734
Rym: Okay, wait, so if that's true, which we don't know I'm pretty sure it is.

176
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:28,440
Scott: they were trying to out preacher preacher.

177
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:29,969
Scott: Well, it's gonna be over the line.

178
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:34,110
Scott: Well one if you draw lines They're gonna cross them just for the sake of it with this thing.

179
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,034
Rym: What little I read.

180
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:36,300
Rym: a preacher did not impress me.

181
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:46,610
Rym: yeah, but - if a comic company like that decides to cancel things that are popular based on some Arbitrary moral or whatever line.

182
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,020
Rym: I don't think that's gonna go well for them in the long run.

183
00:11:50,601 --> 00:12:06,300
Scott: Really this is just more evidence for me that the comic companies at least Marvel and DC, you know, they're comic divisions because those both DC is owned by Warner Brothers, right and Marvel makes all their money on movies and shit and toys.

184
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:10,500
Scott: So these companies obviously still have their comic divisions.

185
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:15,880
Scott: But I don't think they actually care about making their comic divisions profitable and this is just more evidence of that.

186
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:27,007
Scott: All they care about is for as far as comics are concerned is not pissing off a bunch of fanboys who give them money in other departments and Research and development for other things.

187
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:37,260
Scott: I mean look how many comics they make just to turn into movies or Writers that they have their writers practice writing on some comic books to figure out who's the best to write for their new TV show.

188
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:38,900
Rym: Well, there is another possibility.

189
00:12:39,683 --> 00:12:44,540
Rym: We complain a lot about how the anime companies in the US do a lot of things poorly or secretively.

190
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:46,580
Rym: We complain about all the anime companies in Japan.

191
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:48,889
Rym: Kind of rip off everyone.

192
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:51,579
Rym: they can as much as possible at every step of the way.

193
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:59,200
Rym: It's possible that the US comic companies are just less in touch with the world than even the Japanese anime companies.

194
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:01,255
Rym: They might just not know.

195
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:07,799
Scott: no I definitely think they know because they're basically selling to fanboys who communicate with them more than anyone.

196
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:16,096
Scott: and comic creators are like outspoken on the internet like they're all blogging and talking to everyone and There's lots of.

197
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:27,100
Scott: There's a lot more interaction between The comic fans in the US and the end in the comic industry in the US than any other art industry.

198
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:28,459
Rym: No, but see that could be the problem.

199
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:31,853
Rym: It could be a feedback loop where the comic industry does something.

200
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:33,660
Rym: the fans react a certain way.

201
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:42,617
Rym: The comic industry reacts to what the fans did and it Spirals into the abyss in this feedback loop while the rest of us are standing at the edge looking down going.

202
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,363
Scott: Whoa It could be.

203
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:49,280
Rym: that's what happened with tribes - on a very tiny scale it is it is true.

204
00:13:49,722 --> 00:13:55,566
Scott: But anyway, the comic was luckily I guess Creator owned.

205
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:57,898
Scott: so they're taking luckily it was creator owned.

206
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:06,840
Scott: Yes so they're taking their ball and going home to get it printed somewhere else and Maybe then I'll buy the first trade if it's eventually printed.

207
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:13,123
Rym: Well I got to say now that I think this is gonna be a hot commodity because whoever picks it up got a pile of free publicity.

208
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:21,460
Rym: they get a pile more free publicity when they say they pick it up when Especially if they try to allude at all to maybe why it was canceled ball.

209
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,500
Scott: No, because they market it from the beginning as being this ultra-violent gory line crossing thing.

210
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,086
Rym: Yeah, so they could market and everyone.

211
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:32,920
Rym: this is the comic that they refuse to even carry.

212
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:34,685
Rym: This is so bad.

213
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:38,317
Scott: Your mom will cry now looking at trends of comic sales.

214
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,320
Scott: It's really not gonna help.

215
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,966
Scott: What will help is if when they come out with it again They start again with number one.

216
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:47,720
Scott: that'll help them out because number one always sells a lot more than every other number.

217
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,789
Rym: Well, that's how they used to try to sell anime a long time ago in the u.s.

218
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,560
Rym: Check out these ultra violent horribly perverted cartoons.

219
00:14:54,903 --> 00:14:56,620
Scott: Yeah doesn't work anymore.

220
00:14:57,122 --> 00:15:01,877
Rym: Well, it does on a very small subset of the population probably the same subset it worked on 10 and 20 years ago.

221
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,979
Scott: Yeah, I just think anyone who is actually reading this car who was going to read this is already reading it.

222
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:15,768
Rym: Things of the day.

223
00:15:15,973 --> 00:15:22,969
Rym: so you know you watch all those police chase videos where the guy always gets caught because they really never show you the time for the Guy gets away.

224
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:27,870
Scott: Well the times the guy gets away are not exciting because those are the times and the police didn't try to get him.

225
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:32,382
Scott: You know if the police really try they can get just about anyone though.

226
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:35,210
Rym: There have been cases where people got away despite being chase.

227
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:36,289
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

228
00:15:36,491 --> 00:15:47,489
Scott: But I mean it all depends on the amount of effort like if they don't send the helicopter Or if they don't send the helicopter before you get away that you know There's certain tricks you can do or if the guy is clever at all.

229
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:49,940
Scott: Yeah, it depends.

230
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:51,469
Scott: It also depends on where you are.

231
00:15:52,471 --> 00:16:17,130
Rym: Well, the cool thing is whenever there's an actual police chase and they need to take the person down or catch them as opposed to Let them go there's a common procedure wherein a police officer will bring their car up behind the suspect's car and Then in a motion kind of strafe them to the side at the rear with the front end of their car Thus putting most drivers into a spin that will result in their cars stopping or possibly hitting an obstacle

232
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:17,733
Scott: Mm-hmm.

233
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:20,405
Rym: This is common trained police procedure.

234
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:21,370
Rym: It's used all over the world.

235
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:24,630
Rym: You can find all sorts of videos of how to do it how it works, whatever.

236
00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:30,143
Rym: This is a chase video from a news helicopter where they try this on a car.

237
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:32,450
Rym: and well this guy must know how to drive.

238
00:16:32,711 --> 00:16:34,636
Scott: Well, I think part of it is number one.

239
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:39,770
Scott: this guy's driving a pretty nice stolen Mustang, you know, it's rear-wheel drive.

240
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:43,082
Scott: It's pretty fast and the guy knows how to drive.

241
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,390
Scott: He's also got a lot of room on this highway.

242
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,323
Scott: It's like four or five lanes and there's not so many cars around.

243
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:51,270
Scott: so he's doing he's doing alright.

244
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:56,653
Rym: So the cop comes up and he does it and the reporters are like, yeah That's the end of this guy.

245
00:16:57,336 --> 00:17:00,325
Rym: and the guy just immediately recovers and keeps going like nothing happened.

246
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:01,970
Scott: good driving skills.

247
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:05,270
Rym: So you see the cop back off of it then come up again and he just tries it again.

248
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,921
Scott: And it's like three different cops try the same trick.

249
00:17:08,142 --> 00:17:10,089
Rym: The reporters are like, yeah, he just got lucky.

250
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:13,050
Rym: Yeah, you'll get him now and he keeps recovering.

251
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:20,209
Rym: Finally they get him and just for dumb luck He was close enough to the wall to where he hits the wall and that stops his car.

252
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:25,210
Scott: Well, see it wouldn't have even stopped him hitting the wall if the car had been front or all-wheel drive.

253
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:29,305
Scott: It just so happens that the rear wheels went up on the wall and it was a Mustang.

254
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:32,877
Scott: if that was a like a front Car he probably would have kept going.

255
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:35,625
Rym: granted the video doesn't end there and he keeps going.

256
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:36,628
Scott: Oh, man.

257
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:37,250
Rym: It was great.

258
00:17:37,713 --> 00:17:40,109
Scott: So basically the cop pushes him into the grass.

259
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:46,938
Rym: Yeah, while this guy may I don't I don't know if he was like a child murderer or whatever he did I think he stole a Mustang.

260
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:47,502
Scott: I think that's it.

261
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:48,529
Rym: That's all he did.

262
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:49,152
Rym: then You know what?

263
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:52,550
Rym: I at least give this guy props for knowing how to drive.

264
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,950
Scott: Yeah, I kind of feel like he deserved to get away because his driving skills are so good.

265
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:03,881
Rym: Maybe it's like the old days where if you're gonna hang someone and the noose brakes they let you go because they figure hey That was enough.

266
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:13,584
Rym: Yeah Yeah of course see the thing is I give him props for being able to drive mostly because I Talk about how my commute sucks mostly due to the fact that people just don't know how to drive.

267
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:28,150
Rym: But today today I witnessed an accident Immediately in front of me to where I had to swerve between two cars that had just struck each other in fantastic fashion Law and Someone else was right there and they stopped to be a witness.

268
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,728
Rym: So I didn't bother stopping partly because I had no idea who caused it.

269
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:39,690
Rym: it was just two jackasses and like I think one guy was trying to Go up real fast and then cut around before a lane ended.

270
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:40,994
Scott: Oh not good.

271
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:46,210
Rym: and these cars hit each other side by side and then exploded in opposite directions in a sea of debris.

272
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:48,297
Rym: And I drove straight through that debris.

273
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:49,159
Rym: good move.

274
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:50,965
Rym: We were all going about 75 at the time.

275
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,430
Rym: Awesome and Everyone just kept going.

276
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,204
Rym: so now there's this line of cars going 75 through this debris field.

277
00:18:58,245 --> 00:18:58,967
Rym: just kind of did it.

278
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:01,736
Rym: and Then on either side of it is a smash car.

279
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:08,849
Rym: the people looked okay, but there's a cop actually right there Dealing with another accident on the other side of the road.

280
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,273
Scott: So if the city was sitting there dealing with an accident also done the other side of the road Accident.

281
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:19,490
Rym: I mean, I don't I didn't see the cops face because I was going fast, but I imagine he had a look of.

282
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:23,889
Scott: But at least how do you do the paperwork on that shit?

283
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:34,990
Rym: At least if these people were hurt the ambulance was probably already on its way Maybe and the guy could get more cops more quickly than 911 could I am thing is I was zoned out listening to movies.

284
00:19:35,051 --> 00:19:36,750
Rym: You should see so I didn't really pay attention.

285
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:44,950
Rym: But if I had seen who caused the accident I would have stopped until the police guy came over so I could have Made sure the person who caused it got whatever ticket was coming to him.

286
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,346
Scott: Yeah, and then you know, you'd have an excuse for being a few minutes late to work.

287
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:49,169
Rym: I was on my way home.

288
00:19:49,576 --> 00:19:52,689
Scott: Okay I would have gone straight home.

289
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:55,319
Rym: I'll always stop if I witness an accident.

290
00:19:55,781 --> 00:19:58,210
Rym: that was obviously one person's fault and I saw it.

291
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,770
Scott: I might depending on the situation almost depends on if I have time.

292
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:11,846
Rym: Well, like if I was on my way to have lunch with Miyamoto and then dinner with Satoshi khan, I would probably keep going probably Regardless of how many pedestrians were hanging from my grill.

293
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:18,689
Scott: Yeah Alright, so, you know how sometimes in the world there are things you want real bad.

294
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,559
Rym: I can list at least five or six.

295
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,910
Scott: Yeah, and sometimes there are things you don't want at all.

296
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,904
Scott: You go who the hell would want that like a PlayStation 3?

297
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:29,040
Scott: Oh And sometimes there's things that you go.

298
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,670
Scott: Wow, that would be useful.

299
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:37,017
Scott: I would kind of like to have that but I don't know if it's worth the money, you know And you know, you never actually buy it.

300
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:42,089
Scott: but you kind of have this slight desire like hey if you got one It would be cool, but you're not gonna spend money on it.

301
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:47,970
Rym: Yeah, like I'd love to have a Lotus Elis and I think it'd be an awesome car to have but it's not worth that money.

302
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,714
Rym: I would never buy one.

303
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:51,870
Scott: It's not that expensive compared to other cars of that caliber.

304
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,360
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's more expensive than a car.

305
00:20:54,380 --> 00:21:01,188
Rym: You could get let me put this way a car of that caliber is While it would be awesome is not something I'm willing to spend that much money on.

306
00:21:01,248 --> 00:21:09,110
Scott: Yeah Well, what if someone took two things that you kind of wanted, you know a little bit and then combine them now?

307
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:15,670
Scott: All of a sudden it's like uh, I kind of want that a little bit But I never bought it because it was too much money and I kind of want that.

308
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:20,510
Scott: But I never bought it cuz eh and now I can get both of them for the price of one.

309
00:21:21,054 --> 00:21:24,888
Rym: somehow I picture a PlayStation 3 with a puppy duct tape to it.

310
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,710
Scott: well Apparently Takara if anyone doesn't know Takara is a Japanese company that makes high quality awesome toys.

311
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:35,077
Scott: They most of all.

312
00:21:35,097 --> 00:21:41,769
Scott: I think their biggest deal is that they make all Transformers toys in Japan men in some of which I have and they're fun.

313
00:21:42,453 --> 00:21:51,144
Scott: Well, Takara is making a combination optimus prime aka convoy and iPod dock.

314
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:56,070
Rym: So no, wait, is this just an iPod dock or does have speakers in it or what?

315
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:56,671
Scott: no, it's.

316
00:21:56,811 --> 00:21:56,932
Scott: it's.

317
00:21:56,992 --> 00:22:08,127
Scott: basically the front part is a transforming optimus prime and the truck that the trailer that he pulls around is an iPod dock where you put the iPod in it and it has two shitty speakers.

318
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:08,870
Scott: Well, they look shitty.

319
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:10,637
Scott: We don't actually know how they sound.

320
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:16,844
Scott: two shitty speakers to your optimus prime Two allegedly shitty speakers.

321
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:17,570
Scott: Oh, they look shitty.

322
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,588
Scott: They're so small and they look like the same shitty speakers that every other iPod boombox thing has.

323
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:23,110
Rym: Oh, yeah.

324
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:29,510
Scott: But now, you know, I kind of wanted optimus prime But I was never gonna pay a hundred bucks for one and I kind of want an iPod dock.

325
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,837
Scott: But I was never gonna pay a hundred bucks.

326
00:22:30,877 --> 00:22:40,395
Scott: and well now for a hundred and forty four dollars You can get a white optimus prime that can drive your iPod around and Keep playing music.

327
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:43,510
Rym: Well, that might be kind of useful at katsucon to have on our little table.

328
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:46,923
Scott: I think it would definitely be a big hit at convention tables.

329
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:47,626
Scott: I must agree.

330
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:48,550
Scott: It has its uses.

331
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:55,790
Rym: See we are slowly Accumulating all the things we need because cinecon was the first time we went to an anime con and had an area.

332
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,756
Rym: You know, we were guests.

333
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,950
Rym: we had our whole area set up for the whole con.

334
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:06,195
Rym: We could put stuff on it and we've got the pirate flag and we had the apples which we eventually got rid of all Of them and bit by bit.

335
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:10,950
Rym: We're accumulating all that stuff and cruft that you see on long-standing whatever tables.

336
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:14,381
Rym: Yep, maybe you should get the optimus prime to pan that out.

337
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:15,224
Scott: Wait me.

338
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:17,010
Scott: I should get the optimus prime.

339
00:23:17,491 --> 00:23:29,003
Rym: Well, I'll admit and this might come as a shock to many people that while I enjoy a great many at the old TV shows from my youth I Never really enjoyed transformers that much you suck now.

340
00:23:29,203 --> 00:23:31,070
Rym: the transformers movie was pretty badass.

341
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:36,510
Rym: I once skipped on a project to stay up late at night with a friend watching the transformers movie.

342
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:37,454
Scott: It's a good move.

343
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:40,145
Rym: Despite the fact that I also had to be up early the next day.

344
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:42,273
Rym: Yeah I didn't.

345
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:42,675
Rym: it did.

346
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:46,249
Rym: the rest of that week sucked because of that but it was totally worth it.

347
00:23:46,772 --> 00:23:49,670
Rym: Yeah, but the rest of transformer is not so great.

348
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:51,175
Scott: Transforms is awesome.

349
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:51,817
Rym: I don't know.

350
00:23:51,837 --> 00:23:54,145
Rym: I I much preferred not as good.

351
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:58,237
Scott: It's not as good as say Voltron But it's better than say he meant.

352
00:23:58,577 --> 00:23:59,540
Rym: what about Exo squad?

353
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:05,593
Scott: Exo squad is I think better than transformers quality speaking and I don't know.

354
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:07,901
Scott: I guess they're about equal if you average all their components.

355
00:24:08,443 --> 00:24:12,784
Rym: what well we could do a Thunderdome with that Star Blazers compared to Exo squad.

356
00:24:12,804 --> 00:24:18,249
Scott: I never saw Star Blazers Because I'm not that old, all right, right.

357
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:26,730
Rym: So way back Emily saw Brave Story long before it was a twinkle in any of our Gaijin American.

358
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,566
Scott: Well, I knew that it was the name of a movie that was coming out.

359
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:34,610
Scott: Yes I also knew that and I saw the official Japanese website that had a picture of the movie poster.

360
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,597
Rym: Oh, I hadn't even seen that.

361
00:24:35,718 --> 00:24:37,270
Rym: I knew nothing about Brave Story.

362
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:40,169
Scott: That's all I knew was what the movie poster looked like.

363
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:45,230
Rym: So Emily saw it way back and she told us no, it was pretty good It wasn't the greatest thing in the world.

364
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:50,810
Rym: It was definitely in some ways maybe aimed at a younger audience or was it was a simple story?

365
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:52,257
Rym: But yet it was good.

366
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:59,487
Rym: and now through the magic of the Internet We have finally seen Brave Story and her assessment was pretty much a hundred percent dead on.

367
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:09,782
Scott: Yeah Brave Story is a full-length Anime feature film that is a hundred and twelve minutes long made by get ready Gonzo.

368
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:22,800
Rym: oh You might remember Gonzo from the fame of being really good at making episode ones and really a bit shit at making episodes 13s or 26 is yeah, but wait, here's some hope.

369
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:27,519
Scott: the director of this movie also directed gatekeepers.

370
00:25:28,023 --> 00:25:29,713
Scott: last exile Let's see.

371
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:30,274
Scott: What else we got.

372
00:25:30,355 --> 00:25:30,756
Rym: Wait a minute.

373
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:31,177
Rym: Wait a minute.

374
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:35,230
Rym: So so far two shows that started out awesome and went nowhere.

375
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:37,985
Rym: At least though to its credit.

376
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:49,767
Rym: last exile I really liked because while the end was kind of meh and while it did the Gonzo fall off at the end it Waited until so far back to fall off that the rest of the show stood on its own.

377
00:25:49,988 --> 00:25:51,333
Scott: Yeah Let's see.

378
00:25:51,353 --> 00:25:52,116
Scott: What else he directed.

379
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:53,060
Scott: Oh, wait.

380
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:54,245
Scott: Oh, why never?

381
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:55,992
Scott: and I it's a movie I don't.

382
00:25:56,212 --> 00:25:56,914
Rym: yeah, whatever.

383
00:25:56,975 --> 00:25:58,940
Rym: I looked at a couple of these things Tokyo Babylon.

384
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,929
Scott: He directed also Tokyo Babylon - that's pretty much the big ones.

385
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,375
Scott: and He directed this movie.

386
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:05,118
Scott: brave story.

387
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,684
Rym: now brave story.

388
00:26:06,885 --> 00:26:09,115
Scott: Oh, his name is Koichi Chigita.

389
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,950
Rym: Yeah, I'd never heard of him before either.

390
00:26:11,892 --> 00:26:20,210
Rym: I'm sure anime world order will have something to say about him and I'm sir Bass karate for the gentleman will have something funny to say about the fact that anime world order had something to say about him.

391
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,369
Rym: Yeah, and we'll stay aloof of that whole thing.

392
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,896
Rym: Okay, I don't play promos.

393
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:26,361
Rym: I just say the names of podcasts.

394
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:29,010
Scott: I like all right the same ones every time.

395
00:26:29,593 --> 00:26:31,041
Rym: I don't listen to many podcasts.

396
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:32,590
Scott: You should you know, look for a few new ones.

397
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:37,528
Rym: I have I've added and then deleted more than 40 podcasts in the last four months.

398
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:40,629
Rym: Good job Good God, oh, there's a bad five.

399
00:26:41,753 --> 00:26:48,074
Scott: Alright brave story is a standard child Fantasy movie.

400
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:52,348
Rym: Yes is basically the story of this kid Wataru and he's living his normal life.

401
00:26:52,368 --> 00:26:52,990
Rym: He's a punk kid.

402
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:58,008
Rym: He's definitely got all of the cool aspects of a young punk protagonist kid in a story.

403
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:02,890
Rym: Hmm And at school, there's this supposedly haunted building, whatever.

404
00:27:04,113 --> 00:27:04,715
Rym: It doesn't matter.

405
00:27:04,775 --> 00:27:17,970
Rym: but at some point he sees this kid this really be shown in looking kid and he's there and Apparently this kid is a wizard which is kind of weird because there's no magic up to this point.

406
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,923
Rym: But this this guy can summon demons.

407
00:27:20,023 --> 00:27:21,834
Scott: Yeah, it's like a normal Japan.

408
00:27:23,372 --> 00:27:24,034
Scott: He's 10 years old.

409
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:24,938
Scott: So what middle school?

410
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:26,504
Scott: Yeah, there's a bully.

411
00:27:26,564 --> 00:27:28,170
Rym: Oh my god, the bully's beaten up the kid.

412
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:28,852
Rym: I'll save him.

413
00:27:28,993 --> 00:27:33,610
Scott: Yeah, there's six creators who are bullies, you know, and all of a sudden magic.

414
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,682
Scott: It's like WTF where this magic come from.

415
00:27:35,983 --> 00:27:37,110
Rym: Yep, but this is right away.

416
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,241
Rym: I mean, this is basically just the lead-in to get you into the.

417
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:41,090
Scott: it's like the first five minutes of the movie.

418
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:44,321
Scott: You will quickly be transported to a cliche fantasy world.

419
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:44,984
Scott: Do not worry.

420
00:27:45,245 --> 00:27:51,050
Rym: Yes now before we go any further I would like to stress that cliche does not necessarily mean bad.

421
00:27:51,562 --> 00:27:59,738
Rym: in fact you can take a cliche and use it and there's nothing wrong with that and you can execute a cliche wonderfully and This movie definitely does that.

422
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:05,755
Rym: it is super cliche, but at the same time it's really really freakin Well done, huh?

423
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:06,739
Scott: It's pretty well done.

424
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,244
Rym: I think it was really really well done.

425
00:28:08,325 --> 00:28:09,610
Rym: I really enjoyed this movie.

426
00:28:10,212 --> 00:28:12,121
Scott: I enjoyed it slightly above average.

427
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:17,930
Rym: Well, not super super awesome Well, but anyway, he sees this kid and this kid can cast spells.

428
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:25,110
Rym: You get the impression that this kid is somewhat bad because the spells he casts summon demons and the demons do things.

429
00:28:25,752 --> 00:28:34,186
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, he tries to get rid of the bullies with the magic but the magic is like this horrible black Magic witch thing demon scariness.

430
00:28:34,266 --> 00:28:34,950
Scott: Yeah, and it eats him.

431
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:38,250
Scott: Yeah, so I'm like, huh that kids seems to be a good kid.

432
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,525
Scott: He got rid of bullies, but he seems to be a bad kid.

433
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:41,950
Scott: summoning demons Yeah.

434
00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:48,069
Rym: So anyway that the kid leaves and he goes through this door like this magical door at the top of the stairway and then it disappears.

435
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:52,928
Rym: Cut back to this kid's normal life the main character and his dad.

436
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:57,723
Rym: his father Just walks out on him and his mom and this is kind of traumatic for him.

437
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:08,715
Rym: fast forward to a little bit later and unrelatedly his mom Has some sort of medical problem and is now in the hospital and he is alone and his life is as far as he knows Ending.

438
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:10,587
Rym: everything is falling apart around it.

439
00:29:12,131 --> 00:29:24,810
Rym: one thing leads to another and he ends up going through this door because through this door is the Power to change the world and he wants to change the world His family back because I didn't even realize till halfway through the movie.

440
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:30,219
Scott: It's like okay his dad left the family and his mom is sick in the hospital All right, and then halfway through the movie.

441
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:32,370
Scott: I'm like, oh wait, he has nobody.

442
00:29:33,412 --> 00:29:33,795
Scott: It's like.

443
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:35,103
Scott: I'm like, he's all right.

444
00:29:35,144 --> 00:29:35,466
Scott: He's old.

445
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:36,935
Scott: He's like, oh wait No, see now.

446
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:39,390
Rym: this is why I say this movie is particularly well executed.

447
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:43,590
Rym: It starts out as a mundane normal story about some kid in school in his family.

448
00:29:44,453 --> 00:30:02,790
Rym: it then gets weird and magical and within a short span he is now in a Magical magical world with a hero apprentices sword and a little helmet and a wizard telling him where to go and Cute little ducks and a cat girl and an awesome lizard man, and he's off on an adventure.

449
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:08,150
Rym: Yeah, and you buy this hook line and sinker face value with no question.

450
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:16,149
Scott: Well, I think part of the reason why I bought it so easily was because it played out Just like a video game that I also buy now.

451
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,690
Rym: I know that last exile kind of did the same thing in a more subdued way.

452
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:20,334
Scott: It did.

453
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:27,530
Scott: it did have that same kind of feeling that hey This is the plot of an RPG not the plot of a movie, but you're animating it.

454
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:31,889
Scott: But you still left in a lot of this stuff that you normally take out when you make a movie.

455
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:33,890
Scott: So I can tell this is a video game.

456
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:39,964
Rym: But at the same time leaving that stuff in Makes me realize it's a video game and I get real excited about that for some reason.

457
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:45,070
Scott: Yeah makes me think, you know Gonzo I think they got their roots making cutscenes for video games, right?

458
00:30:45,471 --> 00:30:50,350
Scott: So maybe this guy needs to go back and do the video direct video game cutscenes again.

459
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:51,109
Rym: See, I think it works.

460
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:57,350
Rym: Well, because there's something fun about watching an anime that kind of goes along on its own terms like this.

461
00:30:57,832 --> 00:31:01,769
Rym: And while it feels like a video game you kind of feel like you're playing it.

462
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:04,530
Scott: I don't really feel like I was playing I did with last night.

463
00:31:05,735 --> 00:31:09,389
Scott: No, I was just kind of pissed at the character for not doing what I want him to do.

464
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:13,287
Rym: The character was as smart as a kid that age would be.

465
00:31:13,307 --> 00:31:16,882
Scott: yeah Yeah, but if I'm playing an RPG, he'd be as smart as I am.

466
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:18,870
Rym: what he does exactly what he should do.

467
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,217
Rym: He follows the plot points.

468
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,383
Rym: Does thou love me?

469
00:31:21,484 --> 00:31:29,163
Scott: No, but thou must Yeah, but you can tell some things about it that are totally video game are like.

470
00:31:29,283 --> 00:31:30,266
Rym: well that the stats.

471
00:31:30,787 --> 00:31:32,090
Rym: yeah, that was the best part.

472
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:43,328
Scott: And also he has to like collect a certain number of gems to fill his magic sword and every time he gets a new gem And the sword the sword gets a new ability that he can use to.

473
00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:55,096
Rym: you know Do-harder and more difficult situations now also now cliche enough He gets the sword the sword has the five holes for the five things and like every game He gets the first one right away.

474
00:31:55,177 --> 00:31:58,025
Rym: Like here's the first one the rest will be difficult to get.

475
00:31:58,045 --> 00:31:59,530
Rym: mmm now.

476
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:07,538
Rym: So he's going around this world and he meets this awesome lizard guy who's really funny and he meets this adorable cat girl Who is who becomes a character?

477
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,364
Rym: I'm really trying not to spoil it.

478
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,770
Scott: It gets like a pet dragon.

479
00:32:11,294 --> 00:32:13,250
Rym: There's all my god the pet dragon.

480
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:17,655
Rym: Yeah that now you might wonder, you know How could they make a pet dragon?

481
00:32:17,676 --> 00:32:18,439
Rym: that isn't stupid.

482
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:24,641
Rym: and the answer is they make it really really cute But at the same time more badass than you would have expected.

483
00:32:24,661 --> 00:32:27,692
Scott: Yeah, it's a little tiny thing that breathes lots of fire There's.

484
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:35,689
Rym: but there's one of the funniest scenes this entire anime because the anime is serious But at the same time it's really funny and it's a good balance.

485
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:41,830
Rym: But he gets arrested for attempting to steal this baby dragon because the cat girl lies about something.

486
00:32:42,672 --> 00:32:45,521
Rym: So he's in jail and he's all mad and the dragons really cute.

487
00:32:45,982 --> 00:32:48,069
Rym: and then the next day they let him go.

488
00:32:48,089 --> 00:32:52,390
Rym: and the reason They let him go is that apparently during the night someone kidnapped the baby dragon.

489
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,855
Rym: So obviously you weren't the one.

490
00:32:54,537 --> 00:33:05,550
Rym: and then it cuts to this three-second scene of these two evil shady guys Running out of the circus holding the baby dragon up at arm's length and it's breathing fire and screaming above their heads into the distance.

491
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:08,762
Rym: It's just this scene is classic gold.

492
00:33:08,983 --> 00:33:09,284
Rym: Yeah.

493
00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:10,649
Scott: Yeah, that's good stuff.

494
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:16,066
Scott: It's also this the funny scene where they're eating food at the inn and his baby.

495
00:33:16,106 --> 00:33:17,410
Scott: It totally reminded me of slayers.

496
00:33:17,611 --> 00:33:17,893
Scott: I did.

497
00:33:17,934 --> 00:33:21,315
Scott: I was like this it is totally going to explode She gets angry.

498
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:27,701
Scott: only thing it was totally opposite is the guy didn't want to eat whereas in slayers It's you know that food to be gone so fast.

499
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:29,688
Rym: Well, he did want to eat but then something happened.

500
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:42,150
Rym: Yeah Yeah, anyway, but yeah The reason I said the show like you buy it at face value was that almost immediately Once he's in this world and you know He's trying to get the power to change his own life back home you forget about that world back home.

501
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:47,890
Rym: You totally forget that this show started as a normal show and you're just totally in this fantasy world.

502
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,602
Scott: You're like, oh wait, this is a show about a kid with no parents.

503
00:33:51,623 --> 00:33:53,770
Scott: It's like suddenly alone in the world.

504
00:33:54,185 --> 00:33:58,227
Rym: Yeah and he's doing these quests and he's living this life and he's saving people and he's being a hero.

505
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:00,293
Rym: and Forget that.

506
00:34:00,393 --> 00:34:06,272
Rym: he's doing all this just to save his mom and then bring his dad back and then every now and then they remind You that.

507
00:34:06,432 --> 00:34:08,358
Rym: no, this is what this anime is actually about.

508
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:20,849
Rym: just in case you forgot in very very well done scenes Yeah, it's usually just like flashbacks like oh shit mom in the hospital or the cool thing with the priest and the quote-unquote burn victim.

509
00:34:21,732 --> 00:34:30,067
Rym: true is that that got me a little bit just like the Golem scene and stand alone and the second innocence Ghost in the Shell movie got me.

510
00:34:30,228 --> 00:34:31,192
Rym: Mm-hmm Cuz.

511
00:34:31,232 --> 00:34:32,801
Rym: I for a second was like what's going on?

512
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:34,190
Rym: Who's the bad guy here?

513
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:37,888
Scott: Yeah, you knew Sutton was going on because Admiral Ackbar was there.

514
00:34:40,472 --> 00:34:44,244
Rym: But yeah that in general the most the vast majority of this movie.

515
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:45,949
Rym: I would use the word romp.

516
00:34:46,532 --> 00:34:51,286
Rym: It is just a fun romp through a fantasy world with a kid and his venturing companions.

517
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:57,250
Rym: at one point The anime even stops showing you everything and basically does an adventuring montage.

518
00:34:57,772 --> 00:35:05,290
Scott: Yeah, I think that's you know, it definitely feels to me like You have to kind of fill in the blanks to enjoy this thing.

519
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:10,030
Scott: I mean, it's obvious what that goes in those blanks if you've ever played an RPG in your life.

520
00:35:10,411 --> 00:35:12,862
Scott: So it's not so bad that they cut out all the stuff.

521
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:17,330
Scott: That's just obvious and say yeah We did what every other RPG in the whole world does.

522
00:35:17,751 --> 00:35:26,079
Scott: Don't worry that we didn't flesh out these characters to the fullest or don't worry that we just montage that whole bit because you frickin Know what happened there?

523
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:36,829
Rym: You don't need to see that Yeah and actually the months due to the nature of a montage they could show a little vignettes and little scenes that Might not have been able to have been pulled off.

524
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:47,894
Rym: Well, if the whole thing had been shown if you knew what was going on But just showing the one funny bit where they're running away from the thing or the one little whatever It just.

525
00:35:47,974 --> 00:35:57,983
Rym: it's almost charming the way it's executed like you get all this character development and all this camaraderie building Without having to spend half your movie doing that which a lot of movies seem to get wrong.

526
00:35:58,304 --> 00:36:06,730
Scott: Yeah, it does seem like It feels like they originally wrote like a few episode OAV and then get wet a movie, you know.

527
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:18,703
Scott: So a lot of the OAV stuff is you know I don't know if they actually wrote stuff and didn't put it in or if they just realized that you know the stuff that they The idea that they had couldn't be squished into.

528
00:36:18,904 --> 00:36:21,012
Scott: you know, that small amount of time I don't know.

529
00:36:21,032 --> 00:36:25,530
Rym: I think it might have been for stylistic reasons just for the fact that the movie does play out like a video game.

530
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,142
Rym: Yeah, and it has this feel of get right to the business.

531
00:36:29,543 --> 00:36:30,325
Rym: follow the plot.

532
00:36:30,546 --> 00:36:31,710
Rym: The plot is always there.

533
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:38,109
Scott: I also think there's a lot of simplification on that end because it's targeted towards children more than it is targeted towards us.

534
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:46,901
Scott: Yes Now despite the definitely a good one for the kiddies if you got kiddies who like the animes Or you want them to like the anime this is what they're gonna like this action.

535
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:47,643
Rym: Yes granted.

536
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:49,890
Rym: I also like this action a lot.

537
00:36:50,694 --> 00:36:53,493
Rym: Now the thing is the show's a straight-up fantasy Whatever.

538
00:36:53,513 --> 00:36:55,430
Rym: the kids got stats in the beginning.

539
00:36:55,811 --> 00:37:01,688
Rym: They give him stats and then they give him appropriate equipment and there are a lot of tongue-in-cheek moments, but they're executed.

540
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:13,669
Rym: Well Towards the end as the actual real plot starts actually coming out and you start to find out about this other kid and these other things going on This movie really takes a turn toward the dark.

541
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:15,800
Rym: I mean it eludes at it.

542
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:24,138
Rym: it hints at it bit by bit that Maybe all is not fun and games for kids in Adventureland And in fact, it's kind of hard.

543
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,666
Rym: I mean you get you know that that other kid there.

544
00:37:26,726 --> 00:37:27,990
Rym: He has some sort of dark past.

545
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:35,698
Rym: There's something that made him the way he is and I'll admit that when I found out what actually happened to that kid And then they showed what happened to him.

546
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,244
Rym: I was taken aback.

547
00:37:37,364 --> 00:37:38,830
Rym: I didn't expect it to be that bad.

548
00:37:39,553 --> 00:37:41,582
Rym: Yeah, I really didn't exactly.

549
00:37:41,622 --> 00:37:43,069
Rym: they showed me that's you know.

550
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:49,209
Scott: The stuff like that is definitely what separates the kids anime in Japan from the kids movies in the u.s.

551
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,720
Rym: Oh god, this movie would have been rated pg-13 in America at least.

552
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:56,250
Scott: Yeah, but probably it's appropriate for like eight-year-olds.

553
00:37:56,731 --> 00:38:02,045
Rym: Yeah, yeah, but really there's despite the fact that this is very much a silly tongue-in-cheek.

554
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:02,667
Rym: Hooray.

555
00:38:02,787 --> 00:38:03,970
Rym: I'm on an adventure movie.

556
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:08,230
Rym: It's really well done serious at the end and I think it's really good.

557
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:17,058
Rym: And while the moral behind this anime, which I'm not gonna ruin cuz saying the moral could in some in many ways ruin the anime It is a very simple thing.

558
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:18,063
Rym: It's not like eska flown.

559
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,390
Rym: It has a thousand morals.

560
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:25,270
Rym: It has one very direct very clear can be expressed in one sentence with a colon moral.

561
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:27,956
Scott: Yeah, I think it's good enough.

562
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:34,780
Scott: It's definitely worth watching but I'd say it's definitely like a B in my book You know, it's not like oh man's this is so amazing.

563
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,301
Scott: It's like up.

564
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:38,050
Scott: This is a nice shallow fun movie.

565
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,720
Scott: It's worth your hundred and twelve minutes of time.

566
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:49,363
Scott: Don't expect something, you know jaw-dropping and life-changing But expect an anime that will be entertaining for an hour or so.

567
00:38:49,684 --> 00:38:50,666
Rym: see now I would give it.

568
00:38:50,987 --> 00:38:53,890
Rym: I put it on the low End of the A's instead of the high end of the B's.

569
00:38:55,432 --> 00:38:56,980
Scott: The B's not even the high of the B's.

570
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,784
Rym: see my reasoning.

571
00:38:57,844 --> 00:39:02,689
Rym: I'd put it above initial D. No, I like initial D, but it is not the best.

572
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:05,363
Scott: Oh, but see could I could watch initial D more than one time?

573
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:05,664
Scott: I can't.

574
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:06,810
Scott: I probably couldn't watch this again.

575
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:10,203
Scott: I could watch this at least one more time Because I don't think it has anything to offer.

576
00:39:10,284 --> 00:39:10,970
Scott: on a second view plus.

577
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,238
Rym: I can't watch much of initial D more than once.

578
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:14,964
Rym: I can only watch certain scenes.

579
00:39:15,024 --> 00:39:18,841
Scott: again depends which initial D. I've seen the first season of initial D.

580
00:39:18,902 --> 00:39:24,730
Rym: like all of their vibe time They're very few entire episodes of initial D that I could stand to watch again.

581
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:35,669
Rym: I can stand to watch a lot of initial D But my reasoning is that aside from the fact that you know It's a fun movie and it has a fairly serious and good plot and the characters are pretty cool The animation is really really good.

582
00:39:36,435 --> 00:39:45,893
Scott: It's it's it's gonzo plus more money And they actually put in the full gonzo effort on the whole thing as opposed to just the first few episodes and not the later Episodes.

583
00:39:45,973 --> 00:39:48,325
Rym: the music is really really good and atmospheric.

584
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,049
Rym: I really liked it.

585
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:53,430
Scott: Yeah The music is apparently by Juno reactor at least according to anime news network.

586
00:39:53,911 --> 00:40:03,310
Rym: the character designs are really cool and that like a video game there are a lot of Peripheral inside characters that have zero development.

587
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:09,930
Rym: They may be only be on screen once or twice but all of these characters have very well-defined character designs.

588
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:13,903
Rym: They're very distinctive and they're very neat and there's a lot of atmosphere to this show.

589
00:40:14,124 --> 00:40:18,578
Rym: Well this movie beyond the plot itself There's a lot of background characters that are animated.

590
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:19,582
Rym: Well, there's a lot of.

591
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:23,657
Rym: there's this little fox boy who you see twice But he's still really funny.

592
00:40:23,717 --> 00:40:24,863
Scott: This is circus scene.

593
00:40:24,903 --> 00:40:27,814
Scott: That's just really cool Like, you know.

594
00:40:27,874 --> 00:40:30,261
Scott: and there's some really cute and like just.

595
00:40:30,282 --> 00:40:31,144
Scott: it's just animation.

596
00:40:31,164 --> 00:40:33,995
Scott: there isn't even really talking during the circus part But it's just whoa.

597
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:34,498
Scott: you watch it.

598
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:35,242
Scott: You're like, ooh.

599
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:36,710
Rym: Yeah, like if I was at that circus.

600
00:40:36,831 --> 00:40:38,330
Scott: Yeah, baby, really like that.

601
00:40:38,451 --> 00:40:41,730
Scott: I think that might be my favorite scene in the whole thing because when I was watching it, I was just like whoa.

602
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:48,510
Scott: This is like they combined fantasy and a circus in a way like yeah circuses would be that amazing and awesome.

603
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:50,089
Scott: Not only that, you know.

604
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:58,350
Scott: It's not just that they made a circus that was as awesome as the circus would be in a fantasy world But I kind of felt like I was at the circus.

605
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:06,280
Rym: I got to admit I I was impressed with the fact that I was impressed with the circus routine because I know on an Intellectual level that it's animated.

606
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:07,890
Rym: Yeah, there's no danger involved.

607
00:41:08,131 --> 00:41:12,526
Rym: They can draw a character doing whatever they want and yet at the same time a couple times.

608
00:41:12,566 --> 00:41:15,855
Rym: I was like, whoa Don't you do that?

609
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,784
Scott: Look at that circus thing going on there.

610
00:41:17,804 --> 00:41:17,884
Scott: Yeah.

611
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:20,216
Scott: Yeah I also like circuses.

612
00:41:20,336 --> 00:41:25,886
Rym: if you don't like circuses it might not work for you But there are a lot of moments like that where you'll just step back and go.

613
00:41:25,906 --> 00:41:27,693
Rym: wow That was pretty cool.

614
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:31,384
Rym: Like there's the baby dragon, which is adorable comic relief.

615
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:33,169
Rym: throughout much of the show.

616
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:40,770
Rym: There is also the adult dragons and when they come by they are given the due level of respect and largeness.

617
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:47,710
Scott: Yeah That's not a. it's not a major spoiler because you know that this is baby dragon and that someday the big dragons are gonna come.

618
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,654
Scott: It's just obvious.

619
00:41:48,694 --> 00:41:51,464
Scott: You can't have a fantasy movie for kids where the big dragons don't come.

620
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:54,997
Rym: but I was surprised As to the scale of the big dragons.

621
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:56,401
Rym: Yes, and I was also.

622
00:41:56,461 --> 00:42:00,329
Scott: I was thinking every time I saw the little dragon I thought about man.

623
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,615
Scott: What did the big dragons look like?

624
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:03,140
Scott: and I kept trying to grow.

625
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,830
Scott: the baby dragon in my mind didn't work out, right?

626
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:12,486
Rym: No, the dragons looked exactly like a straight-up well executed large silent powerful dragon.

627
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:18,247
Rym: Yep, and and Honestly, I thought that the riding the dragon scene was pretty cool.

628
00:42:18,267 --> 00:42:27,985
Rym: the way it was done Mmm, and of course the dragons fighting the thing and And how the thing was given appropriate due respect as well.

629
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,270
Scott: Yeah, I think that's enough of that.

630
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,574
Scott: We don't spoil the whole thing.

631
00:42:31,075 --> 00:42:32,138
Scott: then there really no reason.

632
00:42:32,158 --> 00:42:33,362
Rym: Oh a thing happens.

633
00:42:34,064 --> 00:42:36,150
Rym: the character accomplishes one thing.

634
00:42:37,412 --> 00:42:41,629
Rym: There is a content point of contention near the end of the of the movie.

635
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,704
Scott: Yeah I don't want to say what the ending was, but I actually kind of like the ending.

636
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:47,439
Rym: Yeah, I gotta admit I like what it's like.

637
00:42:47,459 --> 00:42:52,185
Scott: the ending has like this kind of catch to it And as soon as you realize it, you're like, oh I get it.

638
00:42:52,466 --> 00:42:53,110
Scott: Oh nice one.

639
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:57,665
Rym: Yeah, suffice to say if a character makes a wish pay attention to what the character said.

640
00:42:58,187 --> 00:43:00,238
Rym: Yeah, that's it That's an important thing.

641
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:07,510
Rym: Mm-hmm, and I Thought of and the ending I mean this anime could have ended in a totally saccharine stereotypical.

642
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:09,930
Rym: Well, that's how a movie like this ends.

643
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:16,470
Rym: But it gives it a couple of twists and it's really a not terribly predictable and fairly well done ending.

644
00:43:16,952 --> 00:43:18,537
Scott: Mm-hmm, I kind of why I was.

645
00:43:18,718 --> 00:43:22,090
Scott: I was rooting for a slightly different ending, but I didn't get didn't get my way.

646
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:25,770
Rym: Yeah, there's also a lot that is left unsaid.

647
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:30,370
Rym: It's not just in the end, but in terms of characters made obvious mistakes.

648
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:37,102
Rym: Yep, a one character in particular made a very obvious mistake And he could have done something a lot easier than he ended up doing it.

649
00:43:37,503 --> 00:43:39,370
Scott: and there are a lot of loose threads hanging.

650
00:43:39,611 --> 00:43:41,517
Scott: Also, it's just like they're like the.

651
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:47,155
Scott: there are a couple threads in the movie that they start and then they might use them But they never seal them up.

652
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:50,950
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time I didn't feel unsatisfied with them.

653
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:57,931
Scott: Yeah, because they weren't things I really cared about because they're all side threads and the side threads never develop enough for you to care About them.

654
00:43:58,132 --> 00:44:03,490
Rym: Well, also there's the fact that this fantasy world that the kid is in kind of doesn't really feel like a dream.

655
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:09,070
Rym: But every time you're reminded of the real world you get this sense of oh, none of this actually matters.

656
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,077
Rym: He doesn't know.

657
00:44:11,097 --> 00:44:15,763
Scott: I actually had the exact opposite once the fantasy world was rolling I was like fuck the real world.

658
00:44:16,026 --> 00:44:19,610
Rym: Well, no Personally, I was like, yeah, whatever I would stay in this world.

659
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:26,470
Rym: This is so much better than being a high school kid someday and having some sort of I don't know anime relationship angst, whatever.

660
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:34,193
Rym: Yeah, plus I mean he had a cute cat girl and an awesome lizard guy and he he was a member of a prestigious Order of Knights.

661
00:44:34,594 --> 00:44:35,838
Rym: Yep, and he was 10.

662
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:38,205
Rym: I mean if I'd accomplished that much by the time I was 10.

663
00:44:38,205 --> 00:44:46,250
Scott: Oh man Especially if you know the real world has for you a dad who left you and a mom in the hospital.

664
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:49,781
Rym: Yeah, of course compared to the dark past of the other character.

665
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:50,343
Rym: That's nothing.

666
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,707
Scott: No, that's nothing at all.

667
00:44:51,847 --> 00:44:55,328
Scott: That's yeah All right, anything else you got to say about this movie?

668
00:44:55,348 --> 00:45:00,110
Rym: Not really I mean, I really liked brave story and I highly recommend everyone watch it.

669
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:04,024
Rym: It's not the most amazing movie in the world, but it's really really good.

670
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:05,409
Rym: It's worth the price of buying the DVD.

671
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:06,576
Scott: Is there a DVD?

672
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:08,870
Rym: there will be a English language.

673
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:12,966
Scott: Apparently the region 2 DVD is any as an English subtitle on it.

674
00:45:13,468 --> 00:45:14,410
Scott: Uh-huh Yeah.

675
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:30,985
Scott: So if you buy the DVD from Japan and you have a method of watching region 2 DVDs you can watch this and also on UMD HD DVD and blu-ray UMD a. uh, is it gonna be a four disc collector's edition with 391 minutes of bonus material?

676
00:45:33,153 --> 00:45:34,542
Rym: I can't imagine what that would be.

677
00:45:34,562 --> 00:45:35,830
Scott: I have no idea.

678
00:45:35,951 --> 00:45:39,010
Scott: Maybe it's all the stuff that I was talking about that didn't make it watch.

679
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:42,030
Rym: They made a whole OAV and then they edited it down to a movie.

680
00:45:42,552 --> 00:45:45,890
Scott: Oh, man, the OAV then would probably be much better than the movie.

681
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:47,216
Scott: It's like I would get that feel.

682
00:45:47,296 --> 00:45:53,361
Scott: I get that feeling a lot like hey if they actually you know Split this thing up into four episodes or five episodes.

683
00:45:53,401 --> 00:45:54,707
Scott: This would be awesome stuff.

684
00:45:54,927 --> 00:45:55,590
Scott: See I disagree.

685
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:59,690
Scott: That's about how long Gonzo shows usually go for before they suck as four or five episodes.

686
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:11,492
Rym: But I think this movie by being a movie and by using the montage and by cutting out all The build like all the things that lead you to the actual thing you care about and just having a series of all the things You care about.

687
00:46:11,512 --> 00:46:21,169
Rym: I think that style at least for this story worked really really well and kept the energy and the excitement And my investment in the movie at a maximum all the way to the end.

688
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:28,630
Scott: Yeah, it definitely avoided the typical Gonzo letdown but at the same time it made the end result shallower instead of deeper.

689
00:46:28,932 --> 00:46:32,613
Rym: See the thing is it wasn't that shallow and most of the anime I watched.

690
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:37,170
Scott: it wasn't that shallow, but it was like twice the depth of gatekeepers.

691
00:46:37,593 --> 00:46:39,284
Rym: You know more than that gatekeepers.

692
00:46:39,305 --> 00:46:47,190
Rym: god You couldn't even drown in a pool of gatekeepers Even if you couldn't drown a baby in a pool of gay if you took gatekeepers and put it up on its edge.

693
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,381
Rym: So all of the depth got into one corner.

694
00:46:49,421 --> 00:46:50,105
Rym: You still couldn't be.

695
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:53,638
Rym: it Gatekeepers is not a good show.

696
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:54,745
Rym: watch one episode.

697
00:46:54,805 --> 00:46:55,589
Rym: That's all you need.

698
00:46:56,132 --> 00:46:56,956
Scott: Well you can watch.

699
00:46:57,056 --> 00:47:01,054
Scott: I think there's some good stuff in the third episode of gatekeepers, but other than that I don't remember.

700
00:47:01,075 --> 00:47:03,064
Rym: Yeah, you don't watch any one episode.

701
00:47:03,084 --> 00:47:04,250
Rym: It doesn't have to be the first one.

702
00:47:05,232 --> 00:47:15,086
Rym: You just need to see a guy go yokai edges And and I see the school open up and that the da storm and see someone open a gate got to see the bus transform and the Red Hat Linux.

703
00:47:15,468 --> 00:47:18,680
Scott: yeah Okay, but not brave stars.

704
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,790
Rym: a really good movie and see it any way you can.

705
00:47:21,332 --> 00:47:34,408
Rym: It's on BitTorrent right now, and it'll probably eventually be in the US on a DVD or something But not right now and of course if you're going to be in the DC area during Katsucon Which is coming up in the middle of February February what?

706
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:39,110
Rym: 16 17 18th I believe but I'm not currently looking at the Katsucon site.

707
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:40,250
Scott: I'm about to look at the cuts.

708

Rym: I should know since I have a hotel room there and we're gonna be guests there in the Omni Shoreham Hotel and Washington DC.
