1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,886
Rym: It's Tuesday, November 27th.

2
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:12,789
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:19,818
Scott: I'm Scott and this is geek nides tonight racing games And I really want to play virtual racing.

4
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,377
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:31,247
Rym: Today was a very good day for me.

6
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:33,073
Scott: I think how good was it?

7
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:49,173
Rym: Well, I got to say good Way, baby We always laughed about I we're never gonna buy virtual console games and Scott just bought 3,000 points or $30 to Spend on more virtual because I didn't realize if 0x was on the bridge.

8
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:51,720
Rym: zero X fuck that Simon's quest.

9
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:54,287
Scott: Simon's quest crappy shitty game.

10
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:59,997
Rym: Simon's quest in my opinion piece of shit is the third or fourth best Castlevania game ever.

11
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:04,433
Scott: Well, let's think about alright, so alright number one.

12
00:01:04,593 --> 00:01:06,240
Rym: obviously, you know, you're wrong.

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,629
Scott: I can think of at least four better Castlevania games.

14
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:11,600
Scott: name them all of the other Castlevania games.

15
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:13,766
Rym: I submit a portrait of room.

16
00:01:13,827 --> 00:01:14,047
Scott: Okay.

17
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:15,351
Scott: No, wait, there is only one.

18
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:20,232
Scott: Castlevania is game that is worse than Simon's quest That is Castlevania 64.

19
00:01:20,232 --> 00:01:21,399
Rym: See I never actually played that.

20
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,086
Rym: I know Don't I'll admit sadly.

21
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:27,079
Rym: I know you'll hate me, but I didn't like the SNES one that much.

22
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:34,864
Scott: Well, yes any s1 is basically the same as the original one which is different maps and better controls and stuff like that and you can Swing the chain around.

23
00:01:34,884 --> 00:01:38,018
Rym: Well, I mean the original was okay, but I didn't super like like.

24
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:38,440
Rym: I liked it.

25
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,853
Rym: I owned it and I played it and I thought yeah, it's a Nintendo game But Simon's quite.

26
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:43,821
Rym: it's kind of weird I'm.

27
00:01:43,882 --> 00:01:47,679
Rym: maybe I'm just weird that way but Zelda 1 was an awesome game and I loved it.

28
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:59,140
Rym: but when Zelda 2 came out and Simon's Castlevania 2 those two games I just love and I can't well I guess I could articulate exactly why but it would take me about an hour because those games are so wonderful.

29
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:03,439
Scott: No, I think it's because you have bad taste and you like the fucked up games that no one else likes.

30
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,753
Rym: besides I didn't say it's the best Castlevania.

31
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:08,888
Rym: I think that is Possibly well symphony.

32
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:11,280
Rym: the night you haven't played I played bits of it.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,017
Rym: I never played through the whole thing because I think I believe ever had a place to eat.

34
00:02:15,037 --> 00:02:15,680
Scott: How could you play?

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:26,420
Rym: I believe that Al and a lot of people seem to back me up on this almost That the first DS one dawn of sorrow is pretty much that game in terms of quality.

36
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,512
Scott: No, the first yes one was pretty good.

37
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:29,800
Rym: I really really liked it.

38
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:31,346
Rym: I like I like.

39
00:02:31,587 --> 00:02:37,347
Scott: I like the Super Nintendo one and the original first one Castlevania 3 for the NES.

40
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,233
Scott: I never actually played that way.

41
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:39,534
Scott: Really?

42
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:41,200
Rym: Yeah, it's actually kind of fun.

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,155
Rym: Yeah, maybe I think you'd like it probably and not in that penny arcade.

44
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:46,560
Rym: I think you're really gonna like it way.

45
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:54,666
Rym: But yeah, Simon's Quest was one of the few video games in my life that as a kid Actually scared me.

46
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,614
Rym: the game was just you weren't scared.

47
00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:59,187
Scott: towards the end is all the one there I was it wasn't.

48
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,474
Rym: I was scared.

49
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:04,299
Rym: but in this more like Nervous something's gonna happen.

50
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:06,566
Rym: This is weird.

51
00:03:06,847 --> 00:03:09,920
Rym: I'm worried that like gannons gonna appear suddenly and I'm gonna die.

52
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,186
Rym: This music is scaring me.

53
00:03:11,206 --> 00:03:14,079
Rym: or when I was in the graveyard the first time and but no.

54
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:16,527
Rym: or like Zelda 2 scared me too.

55
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:26,980
Rym: when you get across to like the weird plague when you take the raft across and you're in That place with the enemies you can't kill and suddenly everything's dangerous and there aren't so many villages and everything's scary.

56
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:29,635
Rym: but yeah, Castlevania 2 was scary.

57
00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:36,780
Rym: in this kind of Creepy a little bit fucked up weird things that were never explained to you by the rule book.

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,592
Rym: We just happen you'd run across these scrolls that said.

59
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,360
Rym: cryptic scary things then disappeared.

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:51,178
Rym: you didn't know why you could equip Dracula's heart or claw or eyeball and different things would happen but it was never quite clear exactly why they happened.

61
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:55,458
Rym: and That one time the game glitched and all those bodies started moving in the sky.

62
00:03:55,478 --> 00:03:58,256
Rym: Ah Yeah, okay that game scared me as a kid.

63
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:19,060
Rym: also it kind of bothered me how everyone in the towns was just kind of fucked up and scary and Every time I walked into one of those places where those merchant men were Or even worse when I had to use holy water to break the bricks and go down into like the sub sub basement to find Him everyone's wearing gray robes with scary masks and they always kind of came at me.

64
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:20,190
Rym: It's not like they walked over.

65
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,380
Rym: Do you want to buy something?

66
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,266
Rym: They came at you.

67
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,960
Rym: the first time I walked into a store.

68
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,195
Rym: I ran away cuz I thought it was a bad guy that I couldn't kill.

69
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:32,100
Scott: Yeah That's basically the thing that I didn't like about cat Simon's quest is all the stupid store stuff.

70
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,498
Scott: It's like I should just be walking to the right whipping things.

71
00:04:34,518 --> 00:04:38,373
Scott: That's Castlevania, I like to have walk into the right and whipping the old.

72
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:40,180
Scott: there's no figuring out.

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,501
Scott: It was.

74
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:42,792
Scott: it was worse than the average Nintendo logic.

75
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:44,360
Scott: It was just complete random.

76
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:48,312
Scott: No, not no Bullshit, it wasn't nonsense at all.

77
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:52,097
Scott: Like I in the first town The guy says wanna buy a crystal and I'm like, what the fuck do I need crystal for?

78
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:52,480
Scott: I don't know.

79
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:55,059
Rym: Well, there's someone else in the town who tells you what the crystal does.

80
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:59,335
Scott: Yeah, and I got it will show you the way in Berkeley Manor.

81
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:00,058
Rym: Do you know what you go to?

82
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:00,640
Rym: Berkeley Manor?

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,030
Scott: I didn't even know it was a Berkeley Manor or anything like.

84
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,266
Rym: that's the first man the mansion the first level And you know what?

85
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:07,675
Scott: I don't know where the first level was.

86
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:08,580
Scott: I walk out of town.

87
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:12,094
Scott: It's a horrible dangerous wilderness and I just get killed by wolf men in the night.

88
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:13,640
Rym: That's just because you suck.

89
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:19,833
Rym: it's a terrible night to have a curse but At least at least the dawn something.

90
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:21,420
Rym: I forget what it says game sucks.

91
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,264
Scott: He was vanquished.

92
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:24,755
Scott: the horrible night game sucks on two news games.

93
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:25,237
Rym: Awesome.

94
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:25,920
Rym: All right.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,213
Scott: So in the news, there's a reason angry video game.

96
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:29,057
Scott: nerd agrees with me.

97
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:31,658
Rym: We'll have to do a show on this.

98
00:05:32,402 --> 00:05:36,740
Rym: Anyway in the news, there's been a bunch of articles along these lines.

99
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:45,339
Rym: But I'll talk about this one the PSP slim which is the new better PSP and I kind of like it Has sold over a million in Japan.

100
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:47,425
Scott: All right.

101
00:05:47,465 --> 00:05:51,080
Rym: now, you know people are arguing left and right like yeah, see the PSP isn't dead.

102
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,886
Rym: Hahaha, the PSP is gonna win.

103
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:56,900
Rym: and that's not what's happening because Nintendo expects to sell 28 million more DS's.

104
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,418
Scott: The only reason they can't sell more DS's because everyone already has one.

105
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,308
Scott: It's like who's left to sell a DS to?

106
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:03,990
Scott: I don't know.

107
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:05,035
Scott: we can start advertising.

108
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,279
Scott: the people need to DS's.

109
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,500
Scott: Well, or they'll make a DS as soon as everyone in Japan has a DS light.

110
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,380
Scott: They're gonna make the DS light light so that well rebuys or they'll make the the next the successor to the DS.

111
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,510
Rym: Yeah, what about the third pillar?

112
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:17,960
Rym: I thought there was gonna be a game boy.

113
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:20,300
Scott: That was just the backup plan in case the DS didn't go over.

114
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:26,960
Rym: Well, man, you know people always rag on Sony for outright lying about rumble and all the all the crap They did with the ps3 and everything.

115
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:37,220
Rym: But people forget that Nintendo had this whole lie about yeah third pillar that they just kind of Swept under the rug and pretended they never say it would have been true if the DS didn't do so.

116
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,520
Scott: Well, if the DS didn't do so well, we would already in our hands have Game Boy Advance advances.

117
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,012
Rym: Remember we weren't sure remember when we bought the DS.

118
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:52,320
Rym: our rationale was either It's gonna be the best thing ever and we'll have that opening day or it's going to be the virtual boy.

119
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:55,699
Rym: And how cool will it be to own the virtual boy again ten years from now?

120
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,428
Scott: Yep, that was my rationale buying the DS on launch day.

121
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:00,675
Scott: And I guess I won.

122
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:01,858
Scott: my gamble was correct.

123
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:02,380
Scott: Was it not?

124
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:10,866
Rym: Yeah, but the PSP they expect to sell 10 million by the end of the fiscal year and Nintendo expects to sell 28 million DS's I think just in Japan.

125
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:11,348
Rym: Mm-hmm.

126
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,694
Rym: I'm not even read the article but Way to go.

127
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:33,945
Rym: Well the point here one the reason the PSP slim is selling is that one Japan does have a lot of loyalty towards Sony and Nintendo, you know Japanese companies, but to Final Fantasy 5 7 crisis core, which I didn't even really realize came out Is on the PSP.

128
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:38,300
Scott: So, of course, yeah, there's that giant PSP that I see every day that's in the city.

129
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:40,590
Scott: It's like a billboard has a giant PSP on it.

130
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:42,820
Scott: I always see Japanese RPGs on it.

131
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,974
Scott: So and they definitely look square styling and you know square Enix style.

132
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:53,911
Rym: time a JRPG comes out I don't care what system it is It'll sell almost as many as the number of copies of that.

133
00:07:53,931 --> 00:08:07,516
Scott: you could come out with a new console in Japan tomorrow and that All it does is play one Dragon Quest game that isn't available in any of their console and charge $500 for the console and $100 for the only game on the console and people.

134
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:09,445
Scott: you'll have people lining up to spend $600 to buy your console now

135
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:24,326
Rym: Despite the fact that there have been a lot of shall we say epic fails along the way at the PSP Including early games that had I don't know you had to sit there for 10 minutes while it loaded Or you could play UMD

136
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:24,667
Scott: movies.

137
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:25,489
Rym: UMDs.

138
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,840
Rym: Sony just kind of said yeah, never mind about that, which is probably good.

139
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,400
Scott: But they just say yeah, never mind with the blu-rays.

140
00:08:33,082 --> 00:08:38,080
Rym: I still have no desire to get a PSP yet just because it's too much money and the only reason I don't get PSP.

141
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:42,711
Scott: I would get one just for the podcasting feature, but it's too big.

142
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:49,012
Rym: So no, well, maybe if they make the PSP slim slim It would also have to be ps3.

143
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,480
Scott: Not a gigantic screen.

144
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,160
Scott: Ah Which I don't think they couldn't do because that's sort of the selling point.

145
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:58,780
Rym: But my real news the point I want to make is that the PSP did not win.

146
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,127
Rym: The PSP has no chance of winning and never did.

147
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:05,280
Rym: but the PSP has pulled off something amazing.

148
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:13,360
Rym: It is as far as I can see not counting the WonderSwan and all that Japanese stuff in the rest of the world.

149
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:20,329
Rym: I think it is the only time we have ever had a Second-place in the portable gaming market.

150
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:23,180
Scott: Yeah, I mean you look at the history and it's been Gameboy.

151
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:27,820
Rym: It wasn't like the Gameboy and then like oh well in second place the game gear is doing okay.

152
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:31,272
Rym: It was the Gameboy and the superior game gear.

153
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:36,840
Rym: superior in the sense that it was better Technically much like the PSP is better technically.

154
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,140
Rym: I mean it was much better hardware if you discount the fact that the batteries lasted about six minutes.

155
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,088
Scott: Yeah, but in general it was Nintendo and then everyone else not just you know Tries and isn't as good as Nintendo.

156
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:50,595
Scott: It's everyone else fails.

157
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:51,780
Scott: the game gear died.

158
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:56,535
Scott: The Neo Geo pocket color died the Lynx the Lynx the Lynx still died.

159
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:58,200
Scott: It's sort of like the metal.

160
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:04,900
Scott: The Game Gear tried to kill the Gameboy, but it was smitten down to the ground.

161
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:11,418
Scott: You can't kill the Gameboy, which is now the DS and you still can.

162
00:10:11,498 --> 00:10:12,884
Rym: nothing's Nintendo.

163
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:15,980
Rym: I mean people always never forget the fact never forget.

164
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:32,763
Rym: Nintendo has pretty much had a complete monopoly on portable gaming for as long as Nintendo has had an entry in the portable gaming market and the fact that the PSP did not get destroyed completely is Amazing.

165
00:10:33,145 --> 00:10:36,260
Rym: so I give that system and even Sony some credit for that.

166
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:45,600
Scott: Yeah, but I have a feeling though that the DS is gonna be around for people are talking You know the Gameboy from the original Gameboy to the GBA, right?

167
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:46,984
Scott: Which you can really.

168
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:49,692
Scott: you can count that as one platform.

169
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:50,895
Scott: 15 years of dominance.

170
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,400
Scott: We're not talking dominance just portable.

171
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:58,800
Scott: We're talking dominance in terms of number one gaming console period not just portable.

172
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:01,066
Scott: So DS is three years old.

173
00:11:01,106 --> 00:11:04,376
Scott: you can expect 12 more years of DS in some form.

174
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:11,738
Rym: cuz I mean think it was the Gameboy Which had a screen that consisted of two colors dark brown and light brown.

175
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:20,650
Scott: in fact The DS if you compare how the DS is doing three years in to how the Gameboy was doing three years in The DS is doing better than the Gameboy did.

176
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:26,152
Scott: so it might be 20 years of DSing for us The Gameboy with its brown and darker brown screen.

177
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:28,140
Scott: It was green and it wasn't green.

178
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,254
Rym: It was a yellowish kind of brown.

179
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:35,335
Rym: Yeah, it was dark Spinachy green brownish whatever green.

180
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:35,496
Rym: What's?

181
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:36,400
Rym: it was kind of yellowish?

182
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:39,854
Scott: Anyway, it depended on your contrast.

183
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:41,040
Rym: They never really improved.

184
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,115
Rym: I mean the Gameboy color was barely an improvement.

185
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:45,039
Rym: It was pretty much the same.

186
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,560
Scott: I could talk you do a whole show on the Gameboy color.

187
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,671
Rym: Well, let's do a whole show on the Gameboy like the evolution of the Gameboy.

188
00:11:50,691 --> 00:11:51,916
Rym: All right, or portable gaming.

189
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:55,187
Rym: No anyway Yeah, that's it.

190
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:55,812
Rym: Okay.

191
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:56,799
Rym: What else am I gonna say?

192
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,793
Scott: So I got a story here and the headline on joystick is Nintendo dead.

193
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,500
Scott: last in Greenpeace guide to greener electronics, right?

194
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,434
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

195
00:12:06,323 --> 00:12:08,352
Rym: Why are we talking about Greenpeace?

196
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:10,060
Scott: That's I don't want to talk about Greenpeace.

197
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:15,139
Rym: I mean Environmentalism aside Greenpeace is nothing but a bunch of wackos.

198
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,987
Scott: Well Greenpeace is a lot.

199
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:25,760
Scott: most of Greenpeace for the most part is well-meaning people But the organization is generally misguided and it does terrorist things and other ineffective.

200
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,352
Rym: That's why the founder said wow, you guys went nuts and quit.

201
00:12:29,553 --> 00:12:29,814
Scott: Yes.

202
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:37,140
Scott: But anyway not talking about Greenpeace I'm mostly gonna talk about the video game journalism going on here, right?

203
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:38,063
Rym: Wait a minute.

204
00:12:38,103 --> 00:12:38,505
Rym: Wait a minute.

205
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:38,886
Rym: You are.

206
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:42,900
Rym: what you're implying is that there is a such thing as video game journalism.

207
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:48,859
Scott: No, in fact, I'm going to Provide ample evidence that there is no such thing.

208
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:53,300
Scott: all right, so Greenpeace did us this little study thing.

209
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,448
Scott: I guess they do it every year or something like that.

210
00:12:55,488 --> 00:13:06,506
Scott: And what they do is they pick the 10 the largest consumer electronics companies and then they give them a score based on criteria of how Environmentally friendly they are right.

211
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:18,288
Scott: and because Nintendo grew so much this year for the first time They're on the list as they're the 10th largest or one of the top 10 consumer electronics Companies in terms of size in the world.

212
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:21,119
Scott: So Greenpeace scored them for the first time ever.

213
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,339
Scott: Okay, and they scored zero points out of you know, whatever many points you could get which is the worst score you could get?

214
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:39,180
Scott: and Yeah, so all the games journalism websites, let me let me read from joystick here Oh, it ranks actually not top 10 top 18 manufacturers.

215
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:43,720
Scott: But anyway, according to the report Nintendo has no timeline for toxic blah blah blah.

216
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:50,060
Scott: The console is birthed from a foul process mired and substances like brominated flame retardants.

217
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:51,419
Scott: So they're right.

218
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:58,020
Scott: So joystick says that according to green speed Greenpeace the Wii is made with brominated flame retardants, right?

219
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,471
Scott: Let's actually read the PDF from Greenpeace.

220
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:03,093
Scott: What let me go.

221
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,236
Scott: Let me just scan around here.

222
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:04,577
Scott: Hold on.

223
00:14:04,838 --> 00:14:05,099
Scott: Come on.

224
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:05,520
Scott: PDF.

225
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:12,629
Rym: I'm expecting a stellar piece of objective Rational well thought out and well researched journalism.

226
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:15,478
Scott: Okay, this really doesn't want to scroll properly.

227
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:17,207
Rym: Awesome Is this gonna be?

228
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:19,339
Rym: you know, legitimate journalism is this going to be?

229
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,424
Rym: Some somewhat objective.

230
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,509
Rym: Is this gonna be real?

231
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,051
Rym: Okay.

232
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,500
Scott: Well, it's basically all it is is a chart with some text in it.

233
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,288
Scott: It's not like a big essay written here, right?

234
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:34,327
Scott: So it says here at the top it says Let's see Timeline for BFR phaseout.

235
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:37,155
Scott: Nintendo got a score of zero, right?

236
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:38,920
Scott: That's brominated flame retardant, right?

237
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,227
Rym: Is that good or bad?

238
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:41,840
Scott: It's zero is bad.

239
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:46,532
Scott: Okay, then it says down here at the bottom timeline for BFR phaseout.

240
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:49,400
Scott: No policy on use of BFRs.

241
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,712
Scott: Nintendo scored zeros across the board.

242
00:14:52,973 --> 00:14:58,680
Scott: not because they do anything Environmentally unfriendly because they provide no information about it whatsoever.

243
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:05,604
Scott: They Nintendo you gotta remember this is a company that makes video games and tries to make as much profit making video games as it Can.

244
00:15:05,624 --> 00:15:06,820
Scott: it doesn't think about anything else?

245
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,739
Scott: They don't you know?

246
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:16,800
Scott: You see other companies like given to charities here and there and some of those things are good and some of those things are just For marketing but do good anyway, and some things are just for show and whatever.

247
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,111
Scott: Nintendo if you haven't noticed doesn't do any of that stuff.

248
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:22,520
Scott: Nintendo makes video games as only video games.

249
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,600
Scott: They don't waste their resources or well, well, I mean whether it's a waste is you know up to you.

250
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,600
Scott: But well, they don't sign their resources on other projects to look good, you know any more, right?

251
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,772
Scott: However, I have with my keen journalistic brain.

252
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,116
Scott: I have discovered something else.

253
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:40,758
Rym: Oh, have you?

254
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,604
Scott: oh, yes See at.

255
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:44,630
Scott: so first of all joystick has it wrong?

256
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:51,460
Scott: there be joystick says Greenpeace says that Nintendo is the most horrible evil polluting the environment company.

257
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:55,660
Scott: Reality Greenpeace only says that Nintendo provides no information.

258
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,885
Scott: That's why they get zeros.

259
00:15:56,945 --> 00:16:04,713
Scott: because basically I guess according to Greens piece if you don't you know Have a whole website and a whole task force at your company devoted to environmentalism.

260
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:06,138
Scott: Then you got to be evil, right?

261
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:06,800
Scott: You're the worst.

262
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:09,974
Scott: There's a link in the Greenpeace PDF.

263
00:16:09,994 --> 00:16:20,673
Scott: This is more information Takes you to the Nintendo US corporate fact and at the bottom of the Nintendo US corporate fact It says what does Nintendo do to help protect the environment?

264
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:31,820
Scott: It says we recycle paper in the office We don't use colored paper We buy recycled paper towels blah blah blah blah blah, and it doesn't say anything about brominated flame retardants or manufacturing or anything like that.

265
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:36,391
Scott: You know why it doesn't See, this is why I'm smarter than Greenpeace and joystick.

266
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:37,275
Scott: You know why it doesn't say that.

267
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,220
Rym: why doesn't it Scott?

268
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:42,474
Scott: Nintendo of America website Nintendo of America doesn't manufacture anything.

269
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,080
Scott: They're just an office.

270
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:50,400
Scott: If they had gone to the Japanese website, I don't read Japanese, but there may have been some information.

271
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:51,143
Scott: Maybe.

272
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:53,211
Scott: maybe I'm not saying there is.

273
00:16:53,412 --> 00:17:02,900
Scott: I'm saying I didn't go to Japanese Shocked that a journalist a video game journalist somebody gets paid to do this like me doing it for free wouldn't?

274
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:05,586
Rym: Okay, I mean Greenpeace.

275
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:06,647
Rym: those ain't my outrage.

276
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:10,638
Scott: any no surprise for Greenpeace, but the video game journalist the shock.

277
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:27,760
Scott: So basically Nintendo's getting this bad PR because they don't provide information that Greenpeace thinks that everyone should provide and Video game journalists didn't actually read the thing the Greenpeace wrote or research it in any way whatsoever.

278
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:29,906
Scott: I don't know what.

279
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,053
Scott: oh, that's one more thing.

280
00:17:31,073 --> 00:17:36,109
Scott: I have to say about this Whether you can say about you know, what I don't even know.

281
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:39,780
Scott: Nintendo's manufacturing might be horribly poisonous with toxic chemicals.

282
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:40,286
Scott: Who knows?

283
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:41,460
Scott: I don't know anything about it.

284
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,646
Scott: There's no information either way.

285
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:48,280
Scott: and that's why they got this bad score because there's no positive or negative information, right?

286
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,799
Scott: But apparently people are just believing the worst possible situation when there's no information either way.

287
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:56,873
Scott: We do know one thing about Nintendo and their environmental impact.

288
00:17:57,254 --> 00:17:59,000
Scott: We know the Nintendo makes two consoles.

289
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:01,828
Scott: It's pretty much all they make is the DS and the Wii.

290
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:06,565
Scott: and we know that they're competitors the ps3 and the 360.

291
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:15,380
Scott: And we know that the 360 and the ps3 The amount electricity that either one of those things uses is about I don't know four times five times with the Wii uses.

292
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:19,175
Scott: So regardless of Nintendo's manufacturing process who knows about it.

293
00:18:19,195 --> 00:18:27,260
Scott: It's complete mystery to us Nintendo's products using a lot less energy to provide more entertainment than the competitors.

294
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:37,080
Rym: So take that things of the day.

295
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:46,779
Rym: Alright, uh, so way back in the day before, you know The DS and before even the Game Boy Advance and before there were flash carts easily available and all that.

296
00:18:47,622 --> 00:18:56,450
Rym: One thing I wanted in my life more than anything was the ability to play regular Nintendo and Super Nintendo games on the go.

297
00:18:56,891 --> 00:18:59,000
Rym: like that was the dream of my childhood.

298
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,480
Scott: Well, you know you could starting with the Game Boy Color.

299
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:14,060
Scott: They released, you know, because the Game Boy couldn't really play a lot of you know It couldn't do an NES quality game even though some came close like Kirby's Dreamland or a Final Fantasy legend, too Right, but the Game Boy Color you could play Mario 1 on it.

300
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:20,680
Scott: In fact, that's the best implementation of Mario 1 there is before the virtual console and maybe equal and then the Game Boy Advance.

301
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:27,882
Scott: They just released straight-up NES games for it and even better than any escapes like Super Nintendo games on it better than Super Nintendo Sometimes.

302
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:30,549
Scott: so, you know, it happens mostly.

303
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:36,407
Rym: a lot of people used to try and make kind of cobble together solutions Like get a little screen make it.

304
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:37,571
Scott: Oh, yeah, there's that guy.

305
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:39,479
Scott: I think he works within gadget.

306
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:48,059
Scott: now He basically takes video game consoles and then he sort of rebuilds them in portable versions Like he has a PlayStation you can just hold in your hands.

307
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:51,600
Rym: Well now I think too little too late applies.

308
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:55,933
Rym: But there is now a Famicom adapter for the DS.

309
00:19:55,973 --> 00:20:09,679
Rym: so you can plug this into your DS plug an original gigantic Famicom game into it a game that I will point out is pretty much bigger than your DS and Then play it on your DS.

310
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:21,640
Rym: Wow, you know you could just get the flash cart and That gets points for being retro and it gets points for being perfect and it gets points for being kind of awesomely used.

311
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,147
Scott: Yeah, it's very impressive.

312
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:27,260
Rym: The one thing it does give you is that at least it's legal.

313
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:33,777
Rym: There is no way you can be faulted for having the Famicom cartridge and playing it on your DS this way.

314
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:36,753
Scott: I Guess yeah, I guess that's legal.

315
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:39,526
Rym: I just wonder how much Battery it uses.

316
00:20:39,546 --> 00:20:41,111
Scott: I hope it has its own batteries.

317
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:41,513
Scott: Yeah, baby.

318
00:20:41,553 --> 00:20:43,660
Scott: I mean it's already impractical enough.

319
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,217
Scott: You might as well make it a little bit, you know, oh, it'll play American games too.

320
00:20:48,237 --> 00:20:50,307
Scott: Oh, okay There's TV out.

321
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:51,434
Scott: So I know it has TV out.

322
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:52,480
Scott: That's pretty that's not bad.

323
00:20:52,580 --> 00:21:02,282
Rym: So you could actually sort of replace your Famicom if it broke, you know Just reading that it might be worth it to get it because we have two non-functional Nintendos.

324
00:21:02,843 --> 00:21:08,960
Scott: if you want to do that, you could just buy a functioning Nintendo like that any sex thing or I could buy this.

325
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,006
Scott: But this is stupider.

326
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:12,030
Rym: I don't know.

327
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,720
Rym: I kind of like the style and it kind of looks like an old Famicom.

328
00:21:15,282 --> 00:21:17,211
Rym: It's all you it's all you know, red and white.

329
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,080
Scott: I think there's more practical solution.

330
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,251
Scott: It's got a speaker even if you're using the TV out.

331
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:24,599
Scott: there are more practical solutions many more.

332
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:26,586
Scott: Anyway, my thing of the day, right?

333
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,075
Scott: So, you know the old fist of the North Star.

334
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:33,600
Scott: Oh Yeah, they're making a DS game.

335
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:42,165
Scott: So the DS game is gonna be sort of like an interactive manga where you read a fist of the North Star manga And then yes, I guess you play Effectively elite beat agent.

336
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:48,565
Scott: Yeah, someone's just like it'll stop when there's a fight and you'll basically have to play the equivalent of elite beat Agents to sort that someone.

337
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:56,114
Rym: that's what I gathered for the from the screenshots of the game thus causing the person to Turn the shotgun on themselves because that's how that works.

338
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,139
Scott: That is how that works.

339
00:21:57,842 --> 00:22:01,999
Rym: So the website or backwards off a cliff crying the whole time, right?

340
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:08,720
Scott: So if you go to the this website, which is the official Japanese website for Hokuto no Ken DS, right?

341
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:14,640
Scott: My thing of the day is not this game It's this website not anything in the website itself.

342
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,634
Scott: But if you load this website in your browser something very interesting will happen.

343
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:20,100
Scott: that is quite humorous.

344
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:22,845
Scott: Make sure you have your JavaScripts enabled.

345
00:22:23,006 --> 00:22:27,838
Rym: Yes, sadly Scott sent this to me like oh my god, check this out and I watch it.

346
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,954
Rym: Oh It's that fist of the North Star game.

347
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:31,840
Rym: I already knew about.

348
00:22:33,021 --> 00:22:38,259
Rym: I'm so paranoid about ads and I turn off so much stuff that nothing happened for me.

349
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:40,750
Rym: Yeah, and as a result, I totally missed it.

350
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,763
Scott: It happened for me and it's pretty awesome Right.

351
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:46,916
Rym: So tonight we're not talking about fist of the North Star.

352
00:22:46,936 --> 00:22:51,470
Rym: We're talking about Racing games in general very broad very simple.

353
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,415
Rym: We're not gonna get into racing video games.

354
00:22:53,435 --> 00:22:55,200
Scott: We're not talking about like formula day here.

355
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:57,449
Rym: We're also not talking about the power pad.

356
00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:00,020
Rym: No, I want to talk about the power pad.

357
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:04,379
Scott: I'm at vehicle racing games mostly cars or car like things.

358
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:10,948
Rym: Yeah, cuz uh carts not Diddy Kong cuz they cover sass Did equal Diddy guy is not Ben.

359
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:12,555
Rym: It's a terrible game suck.

360
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:13,258
Rym: It's not fun.

361
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,468
Rym: You suck I'll get into why.

362
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:15,498
Scott: at least it's a racing game.

363
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:20,000
Rym: But yeah, we'll probably do shows in the future on specific racing games in a lot of detail.

364
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:24,455
Rym: I'm sure we could do a whole show just on the Ridge Racer series or just I'm.

365
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:25,780
Scott: we haven't played enough Ridge Racer.

366
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:30,039
Rym: I've played one to death to where I think I'm perfect at it.

367
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,894
Rym: I've played seven once on a broken machine or six or whichever one that was.

368
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:35,597
Rym: I think it was six.

369
00:23:35,978 --> 00:23:43,097
Scott: I don't know Racer all right, so Yeah, what is a race?

370
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,956
Rym: I don't think we need to get it there.

371
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,043
Scott: I cuz I do.

372
00:23:46,063 --> 00:23:50,302
Scott: I actually have a point that I want to make that some games you think are racing games are not racing Games.

373
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:51,814
Rym: Oh, I see what you're doing there.

374
00:23:51,874 --> 00:23:52,559
Rym: All right, go ahead.

375
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:59,540
Rym: Well in my in my eyes a racing game is a video game Where there's a bunch of black cars on one side which are white cars on the other.

376
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:01,050
Scott: It's it's a game.

377
00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:01,976
Scott: Oh man.

378
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:02,540
Scott: That was bad.

379
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:06,439
Rym: It was bad enough to where it kind of hits you after the fact.

380
00:24:06,841 --> 00:24:14,418
Scott: It's basically a game that is testing your skill of you know maneuvering something along a path Right and it that is the skill it is.

381
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,262
Rym: Wait a minute.

382
00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:21,420
Rym: by that logic that carnival make the ring go across the magnetic snake without touching anything is a racing game.

383
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,262
Scott: Yeah in a way.

384
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:33,891
Rym: Ah Vehicle along a course Attempting to get there to the end.

385
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:37,426
Rym: Well that Esther than other people that's the typical metaphor that's used.

386
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:43,851
Scott: but I mean if I change the theme of the game to be like a snake on a Branch on a tree trying to get the end of the branch then

387
00:24:43,931 --> 00:24:46,582
Rym: I'm yeah, the snake is now my vehicle I'm trying to get all

388
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:50,476
Scott: the ring is my vehicle and the the spirally thing at the carnival is some

389
00:24:50,516 --> 00:24:52,166
Rym: sort of steering wheel or Stick.

390
00:24:52,735 --> 00:24:54,866
Scott: All right Anyway, you get the idea.

391
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:58,960
Scott: the skills being tested are the ability to stay on course.

392
00:24:59,342 --> 00:25:01,779
Scott: We're going as fast as possible, you know.

393
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,525
Rym: Well, I think a lot.

394
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:07,378
Rym: also the ability to know the limits of something and then to push those limits.

395
00:25:07,498 --> 00:25:11,570
Scott: Yes, and You know many games fall into this category.

396
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:16,511
Scott: For example, Gran Turismo racing game Forza racing games stunts 4d.

397
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:20,710
Scott: Yeah, RC Pro M racing game F 0 racing game.

398
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,400
Rym: What about say?

399
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:34,820
Scott: Mario Kart, I'm gonna say that every Mario Kart game Except for Mario Kart for the Gameboy Mario Kart Super Circuit is Mario Kart Super Circuit for the Gameboy Advance is a racing game.

400
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:48,060
Scott: Every other Mario Kart game I have played the Super Nintendo one the n64 one, especially Double dash I haven't played enough of so I can't say I'd say the DS one is pretty much a racing game.

401
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,460
Rym: The only thing is the you basically pedal make the car go in a Flintstones way with your finger.

402
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:57,157
Scott: Yeah, kind of but especially the n64 at least.

403
00:25:57,238 --> 00:26:02,836
Scott: in fact I'll just say the n64 one Mario Kart 64 is not a racing game.

404
00:26:03,337 --> 00:26:04,260
Scott: It is not a racing game.

405
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:11,138
Scott: It may appear to be a racing game However, while there is a racing element to the game that is not the primary aspect of the game.

406
00:26:11,158 --> 00:26:24,114
Scott: the primary aspect of Mario Kart 64 is luck with the items and cheating and How well you stay on course and how much you push.

407
00:26:24,134 --> 00:26:36,051
Scott: the limit of your cart matters a lot less than what items you get or if the AI just decides to cheat and fuck you or if you use a Secret on the track as opposed to you know, just going faster, right?

408
00:26:36,132 --> 00:26:38,158
Rym: So, uh, what's your favorite racing game of all time?

409
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:43,451
Rym: Oh, yeah Cuz I have three answers I got.

410
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:49,989
Rym: I got a few answers I can go based on Enjoyment testing of skill or nostalgia.

411
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,995
Rym: I have a different one for all three.

412
00:26:52,016 --> 00:26:53,340
Scott: I have four answers ready.

413
00:26:53,621 --> 00:26:54,122
Scott: No, do you?

414
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:55,285
Scott: okay for equals?

415
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:56,268
Scott: there are four equals.

416
00:26:56,328 --> 00:27:06,678
Scott: for me personal right equal number one would be F 0 X which I just downloaded is F 0 X. I don't want to talk all about F 0 because I want to do a whole F 0 show.

417
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:08,586
Scott: It feels like every episode.

418
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,675
Scott: we talk about whole shows we're gonna do and then we never do them.

419
00:27:11,016 --> 00:27:11,839
Rym: remind us.

420
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:16,676
Scott: Yeah, so the thing about F 0 is that it is more than any other game.

421
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:23,318
Scott: gives you this insane Sensation of speed and it's not just because the speedometer goes up to like 2,000 kilometers an hour.

422
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:42,629
Scott: It's because the game actually makes you feel like you're going 2,000 kilometers an hour and you're you're like racing on Cylinders and in pipes and upside down and flipping and it's just ludicrous But it's actually a racing game and you're actually like you're managing your boost energy and you're you know You're managing crashing into people or not crashing into people.

423
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:50,992
Scott: and there's actually a lot to F 0 and it's it's really Fast and really rapid fire and intense and it it's just about.

424
00:27:51,494 --> 00:27:55,777
Scott: I can't really think of a way to make a better Racing game in terms of fun at least.

425
00:27:56,502 --> 00:27:58,030
Rym: Well, it depends on what kind of fun.

426
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,920
Scott: because yeah, there are different kinds of fun.

427
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:08,963
Scott: But in terms of a racing game that concentrates only on the racing and you know as fun as it can be That's what it does is F 0 in fact F 0.

428
00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:17,498
Scott: GX does the same thing where it takes the racing game the core of it and he just Polishes it to be as shiny as it can and doesn't add any fluff.

429
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:22,172
Rym: see Oh, I guess along those kinds of lines in terms of just sheer enjoyment.

430
00:28:22,854 --> 00:28:24,819
Rym: I would have to go with the initial D arcade game.

431
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:33,975
Scott: Yeah, the initial D arcade game at least version 3 which is better than version 4 is So much better than three two and one combined.

432
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:37,951
Scott: I can my god I can believe that but I haven't played for so I can't say.

433
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:43,570
Scott: but I I can totally believe it because if two is better Than one and three was better than two and one it follows the four.

434
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:46,820
Rym: be but really helps is the widescreen flat panels.

435
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:48,000
Rym: That would help quite a bit.

436
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:55,327
Rym: And also, you know in like one two and three that steering wheel was a little like it felt kind of flimsy Like the force feedback wasn't great.

437
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:57,598
Scott: Yeah, the force feedback was not as firm as it is.

438
00:28:57,678 --> 00:29:00,949
Scott: on say Oh, I just remember the best racing game ever.

439
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:08,440
Scott: so yes the best racing game ever by far Above every other racing game ever is virtue erasing.

440
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:15,355
Scott: In fact better than that is virtue erasing 2 by Sega Which is incredibly hard to play because it's only like one machine or two.

441
00:29:15,415 --> 00:29:16,299
Rym: fucking good game.

442
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:17,623
Scott: Virtua racing was.

443
00:29:17,664 --> 00:29:32,260
Scott: virtue erasing is the best steering wheel ever like I will just say it was also the first 3d racing game with you know used polygon old graphics and it was the first racing game That had where you could change the camera view with the three view changing buttons.

444
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:38,180
Rym: I remember when I was racing I would just sit there moving through all the views cuz that was just so cool to be out.

445
00:29:38,381 --> 00:29:39,769
Scott: That was virtue erasing one.

446
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,806
Scott: virtue erasing two is infinitely better But is impossible to play.

447
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:44,915
Scott: because what system could you get it on?

448
00:29:45,337 --> 00:29:45,920
Scott: almost nothing?

449
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:52,733
Scott: I think you could play it on maybe like the 32 X CD or the Saturn or something like that And I don't even know if that came out for real.

450
00:29:52,773 --> 00:29:53,980
Scott: I think you can get like a bootleg of it.

451
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:58,580
Scott: But you could play in the arcade on a giant eight-seat machine.

452
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,341
Scott: or was it a ten-seat machine where each seat was actually a giant model, you know IndyCar and Frickin.

453
00:30:05,883 --> 00:30:15,820
Scott: there was one at Disney World in Epcot Center and in like, you know the Innovation place and I had to pay like five bucks to play it waiting in line that I played it once.

454
00:30:16,263 --> 00:30:18,540
Scott: So that's how hard it is to get that to play that game.

455
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,726
Scott: But that is the best racing.

456
00:30:19,746 --> 00:30:22,760
Scott: and there is and the force feedback wheel for the first time.

457
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,583
Scott: That was amazing.

458
00:30:23,803 --> 00:30:25,649
Scott: And in fact the best force feedback wheel ever.

459
00:30:26,151 --> 00:30:29,140
Scott: it had frickin paddled in everything, right?

460
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,591
Rym: So initial d4 the steering wheel is a rock.

461
00:30:33,972 --> 00:30:35,817
Rym: It is it's wonderful.

462
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:37,764
Rym: It's it's amazing Mm-hmm.

463
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:44,609
Rym: That's good in terms of initial D. just being fun though those games they pump you up with the music and that like.

464
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:51,834
Rym: it's just this feeling of I am fighting with someone in my car and The fact that it's set up where you duel.

465
00:30:51,955 --> 00:30:57,060
Scott: other people say Definitely has the multiplayer racing because other games with the multiplayer racing is not so good.

466
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,765
Scott: Like you have the checkpoints and the.

467
00:30:58,946 --> 00:31:00,751
Scott: there's other AI cars in the track.

468
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,360
Rym: much every one of those, you know gimmicky.

469
00:31:03,841 --> 00:31:07,672
Rym: There's eight arcade machines lined up and eight people all race in an arcade.

470
00:31:08,153 --> 00:31:09,637
Rym: They're all terrible games.

471
00:31:09,698 --> 00:31:16,797
Rym: for the most part They're not Except for cruising world virtual racing - I was gonna say cruising world sucks.

472
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,545
Scott: I like Can't say it's really erasing.

473
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:21,910
Rym: I also like cruising.

474
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,540
Rym: It's not a good racing game, but it's not a very good game.

475
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,875
Rym: I consider it like at best a guilty, but I really like it.

476
00:31:28,337 --> 00:31:29,000
Scott: I played it a lot.

477
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:30,359
Scott: I played it probably more than anything else.

478
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:36,182
Rym: I think the reason I played it so much is that most of the arcades I went to it was just the best racing game There.

479
00:31:36,202 --> 00:31:37,066
Rym: yeah, it was good.

480
00:31:37,106 --> 00:31:39,980
Rym: It was just they didn't have Ridge Racer.

481
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:53,419
Rym: yep, I would like to give a nod to Ridge Racer one because I Didn't appreciate that game when I was younger because I didn't know much about drifting and all that cool like oh my god He's drifting his car.

482
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:55,050
Scott: It's definitely ahead of its time.

483
00:31:55,152 --> 00:32:04,585
Scott: It was like, you know The initial D class of racing game before that was really popular Anywhere cuz I'd play it and be like what the fuck my car spins out all the time.

484
00:32:04,645 --> 00:32:05,208
Rym: I don't get it.

485
00:32:05,228 --> 00:32:05,830
Rym: This sucks.

486
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:15,830
Rym: But now like I guess it was we used to go to University of Rochester Because RIT for being such a geeky school had like the shittiest on-campus arcade you've ever seen.

487
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:19,161
Rym: It was awful like they took teased us for two years.

488
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:21,228
Rym: Like we're gonna get a DDR machine.

489
00:32:21,348 --> 00:32:21,810
Rym: It's coming.

490
00:32:22,052 --> 00:32:27,680
Rym: we've got one any day now and Finally one day it arrived and we walk in.

491
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,402
Rym: and what do we see?

492
00:32:29,104 --> 00:32:30,710
Rym: Not only is it a pump-it-up machine?

493
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,830
Rym: But it's a broken pump-it-up machine.

494
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:42,961
Rym: And in fact, it was the same broken pump-it-up machine that we had been playing at another arcade And then it had broken and then that arcade went out of business.

495
00:32:43,283 --> 00:32:45,030
Scott: They're probably both renting from the same place.

496
00:32:45,572 --> 00:32:52,179
Rym: I think yeah, but God anyway, so we go to the University of Rochester which had an awesome arcade a fifth makes DDR.

497
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,457
Rym: it had a fifth mix DDR and it had like That puzzle puzzle whatever game.

498
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,282
Scott: I was at a neogeo cabinet.

499
00:32:59,322 --> 00:33:01,349
Rym: Yep, and it had Ridge Racer one.

500
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:04,610
Rym: Yep Also, it had girls unlike the RIT arcade.

501
00:33:05,711 --> 00:33:07,275
Rym: but well mostly because we brought them.

502
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:11,960
Rym: but anyway, so I Couldn't play DDR all the time.

503
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:18,060
Rym: I had to stop every now and then you know playing eight nine ten sets in a row or sometimes there was a line.

504
00:33:18,604 --> 00:33:28,200
Rym: so I'd always just go to this Ridge Racer one machine and I played it so much that I I set the ghost and then I kept beating the ghost and I just I love that game.

505
00:33:28,782 --> 00:33:30,188
Scott: Yeah, Ridge Racer ones real good.

506
00:33:30,228 --> 00:33:30,489
Scott: Let's see.

507
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:31,533
Scott: What else is really good.

508
00:33:31,894 --> 00:33:35,388
Rym: Uh, if we go for nostalgia I'm gonna have to go with stunts 4d racing.

509
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:36,533
Scott: Hey go RC Pro.

510
00:33:36,654 --> 00:33:38,220
Scott: I'm on the new star RC program.

511
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:40,609
Scott: The second one actually is better.

512
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:47,440
Rym: it is but even the first one was Compared to other racing games out on that system at that time RC program was amazing.

513
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,578
Scott: I think the thing about RC Pro M is that you cite you sort of had BB.

514
00:33:50,981 --> 00:33:53,320
Scott: It was the only game they got the car customizing, right?

515
00:33:53,420 --> 00:34:02,493
Scott: It's like you collected stuff on the track and you won races in order to get money To buy more stuff for your car and get more, you know And you would upgrade the car to go faster.

516
00:34:02,513 --> 00:34:11,411
Rym: There was that other game I forget was called my brother was really good at it where he drove the trucks or whatever and it was 4p With the four score and you upgraded the cars.

517
00:34:11,431 --> 00:34:16,313
Rym: there was an arcade game too, but it wasn't that great No, but it was that just out off-road.

518
00:34:16,495 --> 00:34:17,260
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

519
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:23,860
Scott: Yeah Now the RC problem definitely had the car customizing going on correctly and the game itself was really fun.

520
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,498
Scott: You just you drove around this track.

521
00:34:25,781 --> 00:34:32,487
Scott: It's the only racing game that worked well with the overhead view because the controls are right A lot of those other overhead.

522
00:34:32,507 --> 00:34:35,846
Scott: if you racing games just didn't have the controls that work Didn't get it.

523
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:42,313
Rym: a lot of people made overhead racing games with Absolute control so up is always up and down is always down instead of relative control.

524
00:34:42,755 --> 00:34:44,922
Rym: and let me tell you that is not a Good decision.

525
00:34:45,164 --> 00:34:50,145
Rym: No, no, that was evolution worked and that doesn't happen anymore Like off-road freaking.

526
00:34:50,264 --> 00:34:54,420
Scott: use the steering wheel in the arcade to play a game where you could see the whole track at the same time.

527
00:34:54,821 --> 00:34:55,784
Rym: Bad idea.

528
00:34:55,864 --> 00:34:56,264
Rym: Yes.

529
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:57,408
Rym: Good God.

530
00:34:57,629 --> 00:35:01,300
Rym: Yeah, but that wasn't as bad as absolute control up up down down.

531
00:35:01,741 --> 00:35:02,363
Scott: That's the worst.

532
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:06,920
Rym: actually, you know what a really good racing game was for the NES that bootleg micro machines game.

533
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:08,428
Scott: It was okay.

534
00:35:08,528 --> 00:35:10,680
Rym: It was really fun and it was pretty good racing.

535
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:20,189
Rym: The only problem with it was that being bootleg it was kind of glitchy and I mean really glitchy But that was a pretty good game all things considered.

536
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:23,100
Scott: I don't know would you could Oh who can go without saying pole position?

537
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,624
Scott: I love me some pole position.

538
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:26,110
Rym: I don't actually like pulp.

539
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,158
Scott: I actually do like pole position.

540
00:35:28,338 --> 00:35:30,849
Rym: I had it Was the first time I got when I got the Atari 7800.

541
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:37,652
Scott: I especially like oh, yeah The sit-down arcade machine of pole position one is is by far the best.

542
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:39,357
Scott: I mean, it's just.

543
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,185
Scott: it's straightforward It's simple.

544
00:35:41,245 --> 00:35:45,483
Scott: It's step on the gas don't hit anything and Everything will be cool.

545
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:49,779
Rym: But if you want to play an old-school racing game, that's kind of fun.

546
00:35:50,763 --> 00:35:51,947
Rym: Find a cracked copy.

547
00:35:52,388 --> 00:35:55,198
Rym: I've never seen a legitimate copy of stunts 40 racing.

548
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:56,723
Rym: You'll pry.

549
00:35:56,764 --> 00:36:00,698
Rym: find one cracked by kill fit because that's whoever was who cracked the one.

550
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:12,200
Rym: that Internet's right now it was installed on every single computer at my middle school and I brought it on a disc to my high school and installed it on every computer at my high school.

551
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:15,213
Rym: And I played the ever-living fuck out of that game.

552
00:36:15,313 --> 00:36:16,859
Rym: I made a million maps for it.

553
00:36:17,462 --> 00:36:23,079
Rym: That game was just amazing, especially considering it basically had crappy digital control and he was one of those.

554
00:36:23,762 --> 00:36:31,360
Rym: You know, there's loops and jumps and it wasn't terribly realistic But it made up for that by being incredibly fun and incredibly skill based.

555
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,907
Scott: Yeah, that's something I think deserves talking about.

556
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:36,434
Scott: is that a lot of racing games there?

557
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:40,279
Scott: pretty much if it's a real racing game It's impossible to play with digital control.

558
00:36:40,721 --> 00:36:44,732
Scott: Digital control means that you are that you all.

559
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:47,300
Scott: the only controls you have are you know?

560
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,987
Scott: accelerate not accelerate Brake not brake.

561
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:55,460
Scott: left not left right not right.

562
00:36:55,761 --> 00:36:59,240
Scott: Those are the only controls you have to have a proper racing game.

563
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:06,519
Scott: You need to have analog controls which can be like Accelerate a little bit accelerate a little bit more accelerate a little bit more accelerate all the way.

564
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:07,885
Scott: Break a little bit.

565
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:08,929
Scott: break a little bit more.

566
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:09,812
Scott: break a little bit less.

567
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:11,037
Scott: turn left a little bit.

568
00:37:11,057 --> 00:37:12,763
Scott: turn left a lot I get even more.

569
00:37:12,803 --> 00:37:16,012
Rym: there were games that did with digital controls.

570
00:37:16,052 --> 00:37:18,660
Rym: They achieved a lot stunts despite being digital.

571
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:21,449
Rym: There's a lot of skill involved and it was a great game.

572
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:33,180
Rym: And yeah, honestly, I'd love to see a modern racing game That's like that where it's completely Non-realistic but yet really self-consistent and as a result really really really really fun.

573
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:41,833
Scott: Yeah, there are a lot of it was but it's possible to make a racing game that is fun and playable with digital control But a proper racing game needs analog control.

574
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:42,154
Scott: It's just.

575
00:37:42,174 --> 00:37:49,180
Rym: let's talk a bit about Realism because initial D is such a fun game, but it's not realistic worth a shit.

576
00:37:49,682 --> 00:37:52,900
Scott: It's realistic if you consider initial D the anime to be the real world.

577
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,688
Rym: Well, it's realistic up to a point.

578
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:59,488
Rym: the cars will lose traction About as a real car would.

579
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:12,000
Rym: the problem is once you have lost traction and you're drifting The game doesn't make you counter steer which means in the real world If you tried to drift around a corner the way you did in initial D, you would die.

580
00:38:12,602 --> 00:38:18,318
Scott: Yeah, the thing is initially once you're drifting the car basically magically goes around the corner properly like you drifted.

581
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:18,940
Rym: awesome.

582
00:38:19,722 --> 00:38:21,487
Rym: No, I gotta say an initial d4.

583
00:38:21,808 --> 00:38:26,159
Rym: I think it's more realistic because I tried my strategy of gas all the way.

584
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:33,911
Rym: suddenly I downshift and then you'll blah blah counter steer blue and I just fishtailed and crashed into the wall every time.

585
00:38:33,971 --> 00:38:34,091
Scott: Yeah.

586
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:42,600
Scott: Well the most realistic racing him I've ever played was NASCAR Silicon Alley motor speedway, which if you I don't know if you know about this But they set these up.

587
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:57,000
Scott: I don't know if there still are any setup But there was one set up in the Palisades Mall when it with the Palisades Mall was still crazy and malls still had animatronics and stuff, you know in the in the heyday of the 90s and Basically, it was eight full-size NASCAR cars.

588
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:10,019
Scott: They obviously have engines in them but they were Cards and you would get in the car put your seatbelt on and everything and the car was on a pneumatic lift and there was like a big projector screen in front of you and I forget if there was like a rearview mirror or if there was just a project there.

589
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,706
Scott: just Projected the rearview mirror onto the screen but the car would move.

590
00:39:14,007 --> 00:39:23,660
Scott: you actually had real pedals and a stick and everything and You had this projector screen in front of you that was had the best graphics of the day and it was basically a simulator.

591
00:39:23,881 --> 00:39:34,633
Scott: But it you know as a game and you paid like 15 bucks for one race against the seven other people who paid 15 bucks and it was incredibly realistic and Absolutely, not fun at all.

592
00:39:35,116 --> 00:39:46,429
Rym: Honestly, I Really really enjoy like crazily realistic racing games and even though they're very difficult and I'll probably crash a lot No, cuz actually like.

593
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:52,940
Scott: of course I crashed a lot, you know at first But then I got the hang of it and once I got the hang of it, it was still not fun.

594
00:39:53,283 --> 00:39:55,759
Rym: Well, I think it'd be more fun If it wasn't NASCAR.

595
00:39:56,141 --> 00:40:00,132
Rym: Imagine f1 perfectly realistic because that the thing is.

596
00:40:00,152 --> 00:40:06,772
Rym: I enjoy games like initial D because they're really really really fun and I get to drift and be all Takahashi Ryosuke.

597
00:40:07,414 --> 00:40:15,320
Rym: and I also really like Completely unrealistic stupid racing games like stunts because I get to drive in a loop and fly off over the plastic cows.

598
00:40:16,189 --> 00:40:21,454
Rym: but When it comes to an ultra realistic racing game with perfectly realistic controls.

599
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:36,660
Rym: I mean my ideal racing game would be Exactly a car and it's exactly like driving a car except if I crash I don't lose a bunch of money and or die Because getting good at a game like that Directly translates into being good at real driving.

600
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:43,820
Rym: It's like all that time turns me into a real good race car driver, and I really like go-karts and race car driving.

601
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:46,787
Scott: Yeah, okay There's actually this there's been.

602
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:52,371
Scott: there are a lot of PC, you know accurate racing simulators, you know They are car simulators.

603
00:40:52,432 --> 00:40:53,339
Rym: They don't do it for me.

604
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:59,120
Scott: Well, it's sort of like that same culture of flight simulators, you know And I think one of the popular ones is called live for speed.

605
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:02,136
Scott: I'm not sure if it's free or not, but you can you can go get it and try.

606
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:02,860
Scott: I've never tried it.

607
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,665
Scott: So, I don't know if it's good or not but you know that's sort of like.

608
00:41:06,026 --> 00:41:13,476
Scott: if you're one of those crazy people who like loves flight simulators like x-plane and you like Racing or you you can try to get live for speed.

609
00:41:13,516 --> 00:41:14,100
Scott: See how it goes.

610
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,820
Rym: See, I think my problem is that like Gran Turismo games you'd think I like them all.

611
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,219
Rym: They're really real really realistic and they keep getting more realistic and better.

612
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:36,680
Rym: But most people I see play these games with a controller and to me the idea of taking a game and making it so Realistic and then controlling it in the most unrealistic way possible just removes all the fun from the game.

613
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,373
Rym: Yeah, I'd be willing to also though, you know, I like realism in terms of driving.

614
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:48,920
Rym: I don't care about the car I don't want to get money and buy the blah blah blah breaks instead of the blah blah blah breaks.

615
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:52,803
Rym: I couldn't I care about that so little Not at all.

616
00:41:52,944 --> 00:42:01,456
Rym: It's like when you wanted to join the race car driving club at RIT You were like, can I just be really good at driving the car and drive the car?

617
00:42:01,476 --> 00:42:04,019
Rym: and they were like no You also have to do the other stuff.

618
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,301
Rym: Yeah,

619
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:15,831
Scott: well it was sort of like RIT had a formula SAE team where they make a little car and then you know They they race it and it's sort of like, you know, it's mostly an engineering thing, you know Can we make a better formula car than the other people in the competition?

620
00:42:15,871 --> 00:42:18,540
Scott: It's sort of like educational level formula, whatever.

621
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:22,837
Scott: and I bet I went to those people because they think they were technically the largest club on campus.

622
00:42:22,857 --> 00:42:30,720
Scott: and I found out who the Person was my freshman year and I said hey Well, technically the largest club on campus was the club club that consisted of anyone in a club.

623
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,768
Rym: But alright, right stupid IT.

624
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:36,684
Scott: Yeah, but I went to those people and I was just like, hey Are you the formula SAE?

625
00:42:36,864 --> 00:42:41,280
Scott: whatever they're like, yeah, and I was like, what does it take to be able to drive that car?

626
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:41,621
Scott: It's like.

627
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:46,460
Scott: well, you got to join our club and you got a. you know spend years blah blah blah blah blah.

628
00:42:46,621 --> 00:42:48,808
Scott: I'm really only interested in driving.

629
00:42:48,868 --> 00:42:51,056
Scott: I know nothing about engineering and I don't care.

630
00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:53,805
Scott: they're like, oh well Yeah, and I'm like, huh?

631
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:58,058
Scott: I guess if I was Michael Schumacher in disguise, you'd be SOL now wouldn't you.

632
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:05,816
Rym: but I'm gonna say it straight up playing in those games I just I don't see the appeal of playing a game like Gran Turismo with a controller.

633
00:43:06,198 --> 00:43:06,740
Rym: It's analog.

634
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:10,020
Rym: Yeah, it's not a steering wheel with a gas pedal in a brake.

635
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:13,632
Scott: No Some people do go out and buy the steering wheel on the gas now break.

636
00:43:13,813 --> 00:43:23,100
Rym: there's where I get into that because okay I've never seen a home steering wheel and brake other than custom things people have made or things that are stupidly expensive.

637
00:43:23,843 --> 00:43:29,255
Rym: That is even close to realistic enough to justify Playing that game.

638
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:37,188
Rym: Yes If it's not if I can't translate my skills from a perfectly realistic or nearly realistic driving game Into the real world pretty directly.

639
00:43:37,268 --> 00:43:40,119
Rym: I feel like I'm just wasting my time and I'd rather just go play initial D.

640
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:44,520
Scott: Yeah, I'd rather go play a fun racing game of some kind or f-zero or even excite truck.

641
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,740
Scott: I mean the thing with the people are thinking about using the Wiimote for steering wheels and that's it's not a bad idea.

642
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,563
Scott: I mean it kind of works.

643
00:43:50,623 --> 00:43:51,748
Scott: Why does everyone do it wrong?

644
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:53,394
Rym: What everyone does it wrong?

645
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:55,000
Rym: It should be exactly like excite truck.

646
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:57,500
Scott: Yeah, well, it should be exactly like a side trick.

647
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,631
Scott: The problem is it's not with a steering wheel right the way.

648
00:44:00,892 --> 00:44:05,060
Scott: the way the Wiimote works is relative You know, it gets the acceleration, right?

649
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,020
Scott: So it's like if I turn the Wiimote to the left it, you know, it knows that I accelerate it to the left.

650
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:18,500
Scott: So it turns the car to the left But then it assumes that I'm still at the left until it feels an acceleration to the right, you know.

651
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,647
Scott: And it's sort of like I really need that.

652
00:44:20,788 --> 00:44:24,320
Scott: let go of the steering wheel and it recenters itself kind of stuff going on.

653
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,744
Scott: It's not it's.

654
00:44:25,905 --> 00:44:31,120
Scott: it's better than a gamepad by a zillion, but it's still not a steering wheel.

655
00:44:31,701 --> 00:44:33,206
Rym: also, there's this the issues of.

656
00:44:33,226 --> 00:44:38,184
Rym: I need pedals and all that stuff and I need to be able to see out the sides and I need to bail.

657
00:44:38,204 --> 00:44:48,264
Rym: just look into my rearview mirror and The thing that even if I get all that perfect I feel like the one of the most important parts of being a good driver when it comes to racing.

658
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:55,650
Rym: or you know, not the kind of driving you do on the freeway is Actually feeling the road and the car and the g-forces.

659
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:59,503
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I think I'm better and I mean I don't.

660
00:44:59,705 --> 00:45:17,240
Rym: it's not like I've ever taken my car racing but I think if I were I don't know trying to get away from the police which is not entirely out of the realm and in terms of where my life might end up I Feel like I would be better at trying to drive my real crappy car as in it's real my real physical car and it's crappy.

661
00:45:17,442 --> 00:45:18,369
Rym: It's not real crappy.

662
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:22,819
Rym: I Feel like I could take that around a racetrack a lot better.

663
00:45:23,362 --> 00:45:27,560
Rym: Then I could take a super fancy car around a racetrack in some realistic game.

664
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:28,925
Rym: Yes, I can feel.

665
00:45:28,945 --> 00:45:34,160
Scott: yeah, like I feel when most of the time when I'm playing a game like Gran Turismo All right, what's the skill and grip?

666
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,536
Scott: What is the thing that you have to do to be good at Gran Turismo?

667
00:45:36,556 --> 00:45:37,059
Scott: is to know?

668
00:45:37,521 --> 00:45:42,940
Scott: It's the same thing as to be to know to be good at f1 in real life is how fast do you go?

669
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,340
Scott: Can you take the turn without killing yourself?

670
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,372
Rym: You know because you have a car how close can I get to that limit?

671
00:45:48,392 --> 00:45:50,300
Rym: knowing any car to the limit the closer?

672
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:50,982
Rym: You are to die.

673
00:45:51,102 --> 00:45:56,580
Scott: any car that goes and isn't broken can go straight, you know without worry about crashing.

674
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:01,480
Scott: You just hold the gas down and you hold the wheel straight and you're good to go unless the car itself fails, right?

675
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:07,911
Scott: But turning if you're going a hundred miles an hour around You know a 30-degree radius.

676
00:46:07,952 --> 00:46:09,399
Scott: turn the car.

677
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:23,139
Scott: No car has the traction capable to do that, you know If you're holding down the gas pedal you have to slow down Right to a to a speed at which the tires will not lose traction while going around the turn.

678
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:23,924
Rym: now Not only that.

679
00:46:24,105 --> 00:46:24,427
Rym: All right.

680
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:28,967
Rym: So let's say you slow down Exactly enough to make the turn.

681
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:33,920
Rym: like you have slowed down the minimum you're going at the maximum possible speed around the corner.

682
00:46:34,902 --> 00:46:36,452
Rym: That's the maximum speed.

683
00:46:36,936 --> 00:46:51,560
Scott: meaning if Anything changes if there's a pebble if your tire wears out a little bit because you you know This is the second lap and you'll immediately crash if the temperature goes up a little bit or temperature goes down Decreasing track because there's no margin.

684
00:46:51,720 --> 00:47:01,279
Rym: so most of actual racing is just knowing the margin between crashing and not crashing and knowing your car and knowing what's gonna happen.

685
00:47:01,299 --> 00:47:08,380
Rym: and It comes down to knowing where the limits are and choosing how much you are willing to risk on every corner.

686
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,548
Scott: yep, so knowing those things is step one.

687
00:47:10,608 --> 00:47:23,579
Scott: step two is feeling those things right and Sort of like if you if I drive my car, right which is a normal street car you can feel the g-force is acting on your body if you go around a turn too quickly.

688
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:29,886
Scott: and If g-forces are acting on your body when you're taking my car around a turn It's not a race car.

689
00:47:30,187 --> 00:47:37,539
Scott: if you're feeling force it g-forces when you're going around a turn The car is probably gonna lose traction, especially if the snow or rain or anything and that's not good.

690
00:47:38,181 --> 00:48:01,211
Scott: So being able to feel that that g-force is what allows you, you know in addition to knowledge It's that that's the only thing that helps you take the car at its maximum speed is go as fast as I can and slow Down if I feel g-forces and I can take the car pretty close to its limit in an f1 car You're gonna feel g-forces because the car's capabilities are so insane.

691
00:48:01,633 --> 00:48:04,320
Scott: It's but it's how much g-forces do you feel?

692
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:19,920
Rym: It's just like playing because I've played Gran Turismo with actual like not great controllers, but with you know pedal and brake and steering wheel yeah, and Driving around a corner the car will suddenly spin out even at you know, reasonable speeds just because I can't feel where the limit is.

693
00:48:20,062 --> 00:48:28,440
Scott: Yep it's like I'll be going 50 miles an hour and I'll turn the wheel and From the sensation of speed I get from my eyeballs looking at the track on the screen.

694
00:48:29,184 --> 00:48:35,758
Scott: It feels to me like I'm gonna make it around the turn But without the be the ability to feel that.

695
00:48:35,878 --> 00:48:37,786
Scott: oh shit There's a lot of g-forces on my body.

696
00:48:38,087 --> 00:48:40,637
Scott: the car spins out on the screen and I just go what the fuck.

697
00:48:40,677 --> 00:48:50,460
Scott: and I'm frustrated Whereas if I was in that that car for real on that track for real I would have felt the traction being lost in my ass through the seat and I wouldn't have spun out in the first place.

698
00:48:50,620 --> 00:49:02,280
Rym: Yep, I mean I because especially growing up just in Michigan and then in Rochester and always driving in snow and ice all the time My car, you know, I lose traction Pretty often and I think that's getting new tires.

699
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:02,761
Scott: I haven't.

700
00:49:03,022 --> 00:49:12,770
Rym: it's probably the best example that I have many times in my life oversteered or under steered in the winter or in rain You know going fast on the freeway on purpose.

701
00:49:13,332 --> 00:49:15,760
Rym: Yes, but that's beside the point but it's happened.

702
00:49:16,842 --> 00:49:24,972
Rym: It happens cuz there's ice or whatever and in video games when that happens nine times out of ten I crash because I can't feel how to correct.

703
00:49:25,414 --> 00:49:36,540
Rym: but in the real world Even if I'm going really really fast if I suddenly lose traction in the rear end and I'm you know over steering I can correct without even blinking because I feel it.

704
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,731
Rym: I just like you just feel and you correct and it works.

705
00:49:39,772 --> 00:49:44,057
Rym: but in a video game where it should be easier It's a lot harder because I can't feel it.

706
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:59,764
Scott: Yep, and this is why I think that you know racing games in general like, you know virtual racing which lets you feel it through the steering wheel or Initial D, which you you don't feel it But it doesn't matter because you know The game is not real.

707
00:49:59,804 --> 00:50:04,580
Rym: so really game kind of does a lot of correction for you and it's like zero knows the idea.

708
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:09,660
Scott: Let's make him get around the car and f0 which is you know, not even close to real-world cars.

709
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:22,280
Rym: I mean you have a hover car going 2,000 kilometers an hour or in stunts where I go through 100 foot tall loop in my f1 car and then hit a 45 degree ramp Yeah and jump over a windmill in all those games.

710
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:45,940
Scott: I think though that's why I find those racing games to be more enjoyable than the admittedly Technologically superior forces in Gran Turismo's because while realism is cool and all it's basically it's not fun If it they're missing the essential component of the realism, you know Even if the graphics were half as good and the cars physics were shittier if I could feel it Those games would be ten times better than they are.

711
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,480
Rym: I think this is why Scott and I really want to get into a pretty much now.

712
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,499
Rym: It's just a matter of time.

713
00:50:51,962 --> 00:50:54,414
Rym: We don't as in we don't have time to do it at all and there aren't.

714
00:50:54,574 --> 00:50:55,700
Rym: there isn't enough nearby.

715
00:50:56,484 --> 00:50:58,896
Rym: We really want to get into go-kart racing.

716
00:50:59,419 --> 00:51:05,880
Rym: Yeah I feel like even like the crappiest like the bottom rung of go-kart racing.

717
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,227
Rym: I'm not talking like you.

718
00:51:07,247 --> 00:51:09,700
Rym: go to Jillian's and race the go-karts or the slick karts.

719
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:17,105
Scott: But one step up from that as in some guys have a club everyone makes a go-kart or buys a go-kart races it the lot.

720
00:51:17,586 --> 00:51:24,999
Rym: I think the line is because I've been in real go-karts before in Canada in places where or The one time in Wildwood where they let us go in the rain.

721
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,304
Scott: That was good times.

722
00:51:26,445 --> 00:51:32,640
Rym: if you get to the point where you cannot if you can hold the gas pedal down the whole way around The track it's not it's nothing.

723
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:38,769
Scott: Yeah, like if you if you go to the go-karts at the local amusement center You can hold the gas pedal down the whole time.

724
00:51:39,111 --> 00:51:54,100
Scott: and if as long as you steer with the steering wheel Right and you pay attention You will not spin out because the car has been limited to go at such a speed that even at max speed of that Go-kart, you will make it around every single turn without losing control.

725
00:51:54,662 --> 00:52:07,500
Rym: But I if you do go-karts if you find them if you haven't ever Do go-karts where you have to slow down or you'll crash or spin out It's better than any video game and I really and then you're actually racing.

726
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:12,000
Scott: I mean, you know, it won't cut it'll actually you know matter the how you control the vehicle.

727
00:52:12,344 --> 00:52:16,580
Rym: I remember the first time I did it I was with my family in Canada and we saw this go-kart place.

728
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,932
Rym: My brother and I convinced my parents to pull over and they're thinking go-karts.

729
00:52:19,992 --> 00:52:20,494
Rym: Whatever.

730
00:52:20,795 --> 00:52:22,120
Rym: Why do you want to simulate driving?

731
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,567
Rym: Drive rings boring and go-karts is stupid.

732
00:52:24,587 --> 00:52:28,900
Rym: and then we get there and we discovered that the go-karts go 50 miles an hour.

733
00:52:29,321 --> 00:52:32,056
Scott: Yep, and you're gonna wear a helmet and you gotta sign a waiver.

734
00:52:32,117 --> 00:52:37,960
Rym: and Good God, did I suddenly become interested in car racing like you wouldn't believe?

735
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,239
Scott: Yeah, it's good stuff and it's only in Canada where there's not as much liability as the.

736
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,244
Rym: well There's a lot in the u.s.

737
00:52:43,264 --> 00:52:44,449
Rym:  it's just we don't.

738
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:45,392
Rym: I don't have time.

739
00:52:45,694 --> 00:52:47,180
Rym: That's really the only thing stopping me.

740
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:47,341
Rym: I've.

741
00:52:47,461 --> 00:52:48,204
Rym: we've looked into it.

742
00:52:48,686 --> 00:52:50,313
Rym: It's not that expensive to get into.

743
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,820
Rym: a lot of people are into it.

744
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:56,360
Scott: All I have to do all kinds of mechanics stuff even though it's simple like a lawnmower engine.

745
00:52:57,361 --> 00:53:03,600
Rym: Not so much you can rent cars and you can join clubs where they provide cars or where everyone uses the same car.

746
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:12,119
Scott: Yeah, I know but the problem with that though is like I remember reading this story about a guy who went ski doing right with Like a bunch of people from work or something, right?

747
00:53:13,421 --> 00:53:16,836
Scott: And basically he goes down there and all these guys had their own CDs.

748
00:53:16,936 --> 00:53:23,940
Scott: or you know wave runners whatever you want to call him and he rented one and it was basically everyone else was like whoo and he was in the jalopy like.

749
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:31,560
Rym: Well, I have seen clubs where everyone like they'll have a mechanic who maintains them and everyone basically has the exact same car.

750
00:53:31,901 --> 00:53:35,880
Rym: That way there is never ever any argument as to who is the better driver?

751
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,859
Rym: No, because it just comes down to you've all got the same car.

752
00:53:39,169 --> 00:53:42,892
Scott: Yeah a lot of P pretty much a lot of the f1 drivers you see.

753
00:53:42,932 --> 00:53:50,659
Scott: now like you I guess I don't think Scott Speed is still racing but Like I can't even think of a single name, but Kimi Raikkonen.

754
00:53:51,582 --> 00:53:52,124
Scott: Well, he might have.

755
00:53:52,144 --> 00:54:03,450
Scott: but a lot of those people they started out in their youth riding go-karts like, you know Scott Speed was like a like 10 year old 10 year old Go-karts.

756
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:06,480
Rym: f1 is a lot more like a go-kart than like any other kind of racing.

757
00:54:06,783 --> 00:54:08,380
Scott: Oh, it's like a go-kart with a jet engine.

758
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:10,000
Rym: It's a really fast go-kart.

759
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:16,424
Rym: But I mean if you watch him in slow motion and watch like the way they move and the way they take corners Slow motion.

760
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:18,093
Rym: It's just like watching kids in a go-kart race.

761
00:54:18,677 --> 00:54:21,900
Rym: Yeah, pretty much It's just little little turns little turn little turn big turn little turn.

762
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:23,005
Scott: Yep.

763
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:23,610
Rym: All right.

764
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:24,660
Rym: I think we've gone on long enough.

765
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,091
Rym: We we like racing games, but we like real racing games are cool.

766
00:54:28,713 --> 00:54:30,700
Scott: If you have virtual racing is the best one.

767
00:54:31,023 --> 00:54:34,046
Scott: I forgot it though, which is sad But now I remember it which is awesome.

768
00:54:34,428 --> 00:54:36,335
Rym: Ridge Racer one is the bomb.

769
00:54:36,416 --> 00:54:38,084
Rym: if you can find it somewhere It's not bad.

770
00:54:38,306 --> 00:54:39,153
Rym: all the ridge racers are.

771
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:47,016
Scott: not only you know Not only is virtual racing the best one But pretty much everything you have in racing games today came from virtual racing.

772
00:54:47,056 --> 00:54:53,439
Scott: it pretty much invented Every fundamental, you know aspect of modern racing games and not much has changed since then.
