1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,302
Rym: So you may have noticed the lack of opening music.

2
00:00:03,382 --> 00:00:10,658
Rym: that can only mean one of two things either this is a GeekNights special or We're doing the second half of those questions.

3
00:00:10,698 --> 00:00:12,424
Rym: We did way back in the day.

4
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:13,950
Scott: Yeah, we did questions week.

5
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:25,549
Scott: I forget what date it was But if you go look at our website You'll find a week of episodes consisting entirely of us answering questions And we only answered about half the questions people sent us and now we're gonna answer the other half.

6
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:28,390
Scott: Do you want to disclaim how we answer the questions?

7
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:29,836
Rym: I think we'll just jump right into it.

8
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:33,070
Rym: suffice to say these are questions submitted by all of you our listeners.

9
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:41,302
Rym: We picked the best or the ones that we can make the most fun of and we just kind of put them in a random Order mo pretty much in the order that we received them.

10
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:42,307
Rym: No research.

11
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:42,810
Rym: No planning.

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,547
Scott: We're just gonna jump right into this with nothing and we're not giving credit to whoever asked the question.

13
00:00:47,587 --> 00:00:48,229
Scott: You know who you are.

14
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:52,309
Rym: So without further ado Joey Jojo Shabbat who writes?

15
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:58,540
Rym: What What one game have you guys played the longest as in?

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,967
Rym: I've played X game for why years?

17
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:04,599
Rym: well Not longest as in.

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,250
Rym: you know, I've played Civ 2 more than any other game combined.

19
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:13,610
Scott: But yeah, I mean, yeah It's tough because like the I guess one of the I guess I played pac-man for the Atari maybe and then I played that recently.

20
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:20,198
Scott: So, you know between the first time I played it in the most recent time I played it's probably the longest amount of time Yeah, so that would be kaboom.

21
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:22,230
Rym: Yeah, we're talking video games, right?

22
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:32,030
Scott: But if you're talking well, I guess, you know, if you're talking hours of play Total it's like two or a quick two might be like Civ 2 or Counter-Strike or something like that.

23
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:41,990
Rym: You know while I think Counter-Strike and while I played it almost every day at RIT for many years When I was in high school, I played Quake 2 mods longer than that every day.

24
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:53,163
Rym: Yeah, but for me, I guess Counter-Strike me, I guess probably yeah, I mean in terms of board games it Probably Settlers just because games I played before that I don't play anymore.

25
00:01:53,183 --> 00:01:55,892
Rym: Yeah, and even Settlers I barely play I mean like.

26
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:59,646
Scott: I guess the first board game I ever played maybe was like Candyland.

27
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,850
Rym: No, it was the Uncle Wiggly.

28
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:01,974
Scott: No, I didn't play Uncle Wiggly.

29
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:05,206
Rym: Uncle Wiggly was the first game I ever played that I can remember.

30
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:07,634
Scott: My sister had Uncle Wiggly But it was better than Candyland.

31
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,979
Scott: I haven't played Candyland in a long time.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,587
Rym: Candyland is not as good as Uncle Wiggly.

33
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:16,099
Scott: Maybe like like Jin Rummy or something cuz.

34
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:17,708
Scott: you know card games are sort of.

35
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:21,530
Scott: you know I played them when I was young and I played them semi recently maybe like backgammon.

36
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,345
Rym: I've been playing backgammon for when was the last time you played it though?

37
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:25,350
Scott: like a year ago.

38
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,656
Rym: Maybe it might be hearts.

39
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:31,858
Scott: Maybe you know cuz I didn't play hearts until Microsoft Windows 95 taught me how.

40
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:32,520
Rym: Oh, really?

41
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:32,962
Scott: Yeah.

42
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:33,644
Rym: Wow.

43
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:34,548
Rym: My dad taught me how.

44
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,298
Rym: Yeah To this day.

45
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:38,230
Scott: My grandpa taught me all the card games.

46
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,783
Scott: I know it was mostly like poker and Rummy and that sort of thing.

47
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:42,385
Rym: Rummy.

48
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:42,907
Scott: Yeah.

49
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,606
Scott: All right What else we got here?

50
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:46,755
Rym: Let me see.

51
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:47,650
Rym: Already lost your space?

52
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,655
Scott: Yes, cuz I didn't have my space to begin with.

53
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:55,795
Rym: What characters in Team Fortress 2 have your highest playtime points?

54
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,182
Rym: This question is a little bit Not relevant anymore since we really don't play Team Fortress 2 anymore.

55
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:10,790
Scott: Yeah, I haven't played Team Fortress 2 in a few weeks But if I remember correctly The medic might have my highest playtime because there was a string where the game was hot where I was the medic all the time.

56
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,970
Scott: But then I sort of stopped and then the game declined, but I think one time I got like 24 points to the Demoman.

57
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,054
Scott: That was my big score.

58
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:27,230
Rym: Engineer is double all the other classes combined in terms of playtime, but Sniper has far and away the most points because if I do decide to be a sniper I shoot everyone

59
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:27,913
Scott: All right,

60
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,649
Rym: especially on these new maps that are way too big for the way this game is designed.

61
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,030
Scott: Yep What do you guys think about people putting their names on games?

62
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:35,592
Scott: E.g.

63
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:39,263
Scott: Sid Meier's Civilization, Clive Barker's Jericho, Peter Jackson's King Kong.

64
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:42,875
Rym: Once again proper use of Exemplia Grettis, props.

65
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:43,437
Rym: Yeah.

66
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:46,027
Scott: Well, the thing is it's sort of a two-way street.

67
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:46,930
Scott: It's like number one.

68
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,350
Scott: I don't like it when you have sort of like this work of art and it doesn't say who made it at all on it.

69
00:03:52,410 --> 00:04:07,278
Scott: You know, it's like, you know because knowing who made something who is primarily responsible for something is huge because then you find out what else they did and you Can find more things you will enjoy, you know If I buy a manga and it doesn't say Tezuka on it and then I buy another manga that doesn't say Tezuka I don't know.

70
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:07,828
Scott: They're the same.

71
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:09,478
Scott: Well, I guess it'd be hard not to know.

72
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:11,509
Scott: they're the same but you don't know for sure, you know.

73
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,509
Scott: but if they all say Tezuka you can buy one if you like it you look and then you buy a whole bunch and It's a good thing.

74
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:16,771
Scott: but

75
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:33,770
Rym: I mean one thing that got us way back when we first made friends with anime world order and they talked a lot about anime directors and then we started paying attention to all the different anime directors not just the big ones but all of them and We discovered a lot of anime that we liked and we noticed that all the anime we hated were made by the same car of idiots.

76
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:35,517
Scott: Yep, but there is a problem with this.

77
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:38,189
Scott: and the problem is is that a lot of these things, right?

78
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,116
Scott: I mean, you know a painting by Van.

79
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:40,417
Scott: Gogh.

80
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:41,802
Scott: No one made it but Van.

81
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:42,022
Scott: Gogh.

82
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:42,725
Scott: It was all Van.

83
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:43,026
Scott: Gogh.

84
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:44,150
Scott: No one else, right?

85
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,413
Scott: No one else did it.

86
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:50,330
Scott: but you look at something like a manga right where it has writer or writer and artist.

87
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:58,129
Scott: But they had a bunch of assistants and a bunch of other people working on it Editors and stuff and those people get no credit whatsoever.

88
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:06,970
Scott: and The problem is it could end up like a movie where sure you give them a little tiny credit in the back You know that no one ever sees but then no one knows or cares about them.

89
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:08,383
Scott: You might as well give them no credit at all.

90
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:10,890
Rym: But at the same time What's the purpose of having the name there?

91
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,320
Rym: If the purpose is to kind of identify?

92
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,090
Rym: because look if you look at Sid Meier, he made all the same kind of games.

93
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:17,772
Scott: Yep, he did.

94
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:22,310
Rym: So it's more of a benefit to the people the consumer just from a very much.

95
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:30,190
Rym: I like the kinds of games that are directed by Sid Meier or I like the kinds of games that are designed by Rainer Canizia

96
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:38,153
Scott: yep, and you look at something like American comic books where they do give credit to all like the different people who work on it like the colorist and a letterer and Everything right.

97
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:41,830
Scott: and those people fought to get their names on those books and they got them there.

98
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:47,370
Scott: But now it's sort of you know, people do pay attention to the writers and the artists mostly but there's a lot.

99
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:52,855
Scott: It's not as it's not like a manga where there's one big name on it, you know It's easy to identify.

100
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:57,852
Scott: it's it's a tough call because on the one hand some people aren't getting credit for work They did.

101
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:00,359
Scott: but on the other hand, it's more useful.

102
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,750
Scott: If only the most important person it's more that they still get the credit.

103
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,884
Rym: It's more that this is just making what like a name prominent like just selling a movie as in.

104
00:06:08,904 --> 00:06:15,398
Rym: you know, King Kong or Peter Jackson's King Kong Cuz I mean King Kong is one thing.

105
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:20,697
Rym: but by calling it Peter Jackson's King Kong Now you kind of just from the title.

106
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:20,978
Rym: No.

107
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:21,460
Rym: All right.

108
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,570
Rym: This is Peter Jackson's take on King Kong.

109
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:25,917
Rym: I like Peter Jackson.

110
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:27,185
Rym: I like King Kong.

111
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:28,029
Rym: Let's see what happens.

112
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:57,330
Rym: Yep The only problem I have with this at all is just a lot of times I've seen people well marketers try to sell one thing that might have been done a little bit by someone who's been big and other things like When when utenna was first marketed in the US They made a big deal on all the packaging that by the creators of Sailor Moon because Sailor Moon was popular and they tried to kind of Steal all that popularity and ride on the coattails to sell utenna.

113
00:06:57,622 --> 00:07:07,410
Scott: Yeah I noticed a lot of that stuff goes on where someone who is like You know a major creative influence on one project has like their pinky toe dipped into another project.

114
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:19,090
Scott: But then the plaster that person's name all over it like, you know, like if Steven Spielberg like looks at a movie They'll be like Steven Spielberg Oh my god When he didn't even really most of it just to sort of profit off of his name.

115
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:24,090
Rym: But at the same time the people who tend to do that are the people who dilute the value of their name.

116
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,893
Rym: And then I ignore him.

117
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:26,861
Scott: Anyway, yeah, it's tough call.

118
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:29,270
Rym: I mean Sid Meyer has rarely done me wrong.

119
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,814
Scott: No, we're definitely rarely.

120
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:32,558
Rym: rain-air kinesia always on top.

121
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:34,543
Scott: No, you remember what was that game?

122
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:37,370
Rym: a Tower of Babel that one Babylon Tower?

123
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,815
Scott: Babel.

124
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:38,889
Scott: Yeah, I remember.

125
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:43,689
Rym: Okay, as far as I'm concerned That game does not exist.

126
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:46,695
Scott: Okay Next question here.

127
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:50,450
Scott: What is one thing you would do to make video games better as a whole?

128
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,679
Scott: What kind of vague question is that?

129
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:53,684
Rym: I don't know.

130
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:57,355
Rym: take more risks Make better game.

131
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,003
Scott: let anyone make any game they want.

132
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:05,080
Rym: I would make better games Thereby making video games as a whole better.

133
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:06,184
Rym: That's a stupid question.

134
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:07,107
Rym: You're a stupid person.

135
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:07,829
Scott: games free.

136
00:08:10,693 --> 00:08:14,336
Rym: Okay, that that would be a whole show at mo at All right.

137
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:16,550
Rym: What's the most inventive game you've ever played?

138
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,829
Rym: Kata Mari gets a lot of points for just being weird kinda Tetris.

139
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,188
Rym: Tetris kind of spawned a whole genre of gaming space war.

140
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:31,649
Scott: Space war was actually not that fun, but there was the most inventiveness going on.

141
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,904
Scott: Well, I think about how much they invented.

142
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:39,610
Rym: by that logic Almost every Atari game is one of the most inventive games ever because they took nothing and made something.

143
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,216
Scott: I think it's just another vague question like the previous Like what games stand out as being?

144
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,664
Rym: I don't know mold breakers or games that changed the industry.

145
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:51,989
Rym: I mean Final Fantasy 1 changed video gaming in a profound way.

146
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:56,735
Scott: Yeah, kind Mario Super Mario Brothers 1 Zelda 1.

147
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,899
Rym: Mario 1 was the first platformer that didn't suck.

148
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:06,359
Scott: Yeah, something like that Space Invaders, I don't know.

149
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,187
Rym: All right, I guess you don't want to answer that.

150
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:15,470
Rym: Not really now All right Do you think it is allowable and should be legal for people to modify the firmware of handheld such as the PSP and the DS?

151
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:26,350
Scott: Yes, if you own something if you own a physical thing You should be able to do to that physical thing Whatever you want, but at the same time the person who sold it to you is within their rights to no longer support you.

152
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,214
Scott: Yeah, they don't have.

153
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:34,776
Scott: your warranty could be void which is fine or whatever But if you own something you should be able to do to it Whatever you want to do to it.

154
00:09:34,836 --> 00:09:42,490
Scott: as long as you don't you know break the law like if you take your car You shouldn't be able to take out the catalytic converter, you know stuff like that, but that's a different story.

155
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,460
Scott: But for the most part you own something.

156
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,490
Scott: you can do whatever you want to it as far as I'm concerned.

157
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:51,550
Rym: So what in your opinion is the saddest moment in gaming?

158
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,690
Scott: The saddest because I've heard that Final Fantasy 7 is sad, but I ever beat that game.

159
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:05,527
Rym: Well, it has a scene where someone yeah, I know all about that wasn't said.

160
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,353
Rym: even when I saw it I wasn't sad.

161
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:09,921
Rym: All I could think was why doesn't anyone do anything?

162
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,486
Rym: Why are they letting this happen?

163
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:12,750
Rym: What the fuck?

164
00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:14,393
Scott: Yeah, I didn't beat it.

165
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:17,785
Scott: So it's not as I guess the saddest but is what they're asking.

166
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,893
Scott: but my saddest I don't know.

167
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:23,467
Rym: I got a little choked up when Eris tried to commit suicide in final.

168
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,676
Rym: Yeah Eris What was Sarah Celeste?

169
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,874
Rym: not Eris Celeste in Final Fantasy 6?

170
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:34,610
Rym: I got a little choked up when it played the opera song again, and then she threw herself off the cliff.

171
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,075
Rym: Yeah, that was a good scene.

172
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,246
Rym: Yeah, I used to kill the fish to see that scene.

173
00:10:39,286 --> 00:10:46,885
Rym: cuz I didn't want to save Cid And it was faster just murdering Poison fish that it was to sit there and try to save him.

174
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:47,690
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

175
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:53,009
Scott: It's really sad in gaming because I don't really play a lot of games that have sadness in them so much.

176
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:59,126
Rym: Quest for glory 4 has something terribly sad happen near the end that I don't want to ruin.

177
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:03,810
Scott: Uh-huh Yeah, I can't even think of any sad games that I've played.

178
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:16,130
Rym: I can think of a few when uh, cuz it's mostly you're gonna find the sadness and like the Japanese RPG types When Cid committed suicide in Final Fantasy 4 Yeah, that's where you're gonna find when Yang committed suicide in Final Fantasy 4.

179
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,302
Rym: Yeah, when palim committed suicide in Final Fantasy 4.

180
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:21,430
Scott: Oh, yeah when they get turned to stone man, that's pretty sad.

181
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:23,120
Rym: I got a little sniffly there too.

182
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:30,350
Scott: Yeah, it's that's a rough one But yeah, that's the only place you're really gonna find the sad moments at least as far as I'm concerned.

183
00:11:30,592 --> 00:11:39,170
Rym: I don't know of any other games that really have the the sadness I would say when you know ex game designer died in the real world, but all my favorite game designers are still alive.

184
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:41,136
Scott: Oh, yeah, saddest gaming moment.

185
00:11:41,196 --> 00:11:44,547
Scott: when that the guy who invented the Gameboy Oh Gupta.

186
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:47,556
Scott: Yeah I got my good pay.

187
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:48,600
Rym: Good pay.

188
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,145
Rym: No, I was thinking of Samir Gupta.

189
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:50,927
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

190
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:52,596
Rym: That's a different guy All right.

191
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:53,906
Scott: I'm done with this question.

192
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,558
Scott: All right No, you want me to keep going?

193
00:11:56,578 --> 00:11:58,730
Scott: Yeah, go ahead dear Nostra dumbass.

194
00:11:59,221 --> 00:12:04,263
Scott: Okay Please predict with your best use of imagination where gaming will be in a hundred years.

195
00:12:04,403 --> 00:12:06,950
Scott: or will technological advances make it completely unrecognizable?

196
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:09,057
Rym: Well, it's gonna be perfect VR That's obvious.

197
00:12:09,158 --> 00:12:21,047
Scott: if we're going to assume That gaming will be around at a hundred years and they won't be the end of the world or the humanity will not will Not just transcend the idea of games and only do things that benefit society directly.

198
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:21,950
Rym: is our daughter, right?

199
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,870
Scott: You will be able to experience anything you want to experience with no risk whatsoever.

200
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,565
Scott: I think I exactly real as if you are really experiencing it and that will be it.

201
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,556
Rym: I really believe that I mean 100 years.

202
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:42,548
Rym: Think about how much gaming has changed in the last 10 years and it's changing faster in the next year than it did in those 10 years.

203
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:43,672
Rym: Yep.

204
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:44,635
Rym: All right.

205
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:49,190
Rym: What are your opinions of those other non burning wheel games Luke crane recommended?

206
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,237
Rym: I think this is referring back to the interview.

207
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:54,791
Rym: We did with Luke crane where he recommended a whole bunch of indie RPGs Mm-hmm.

208
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:58,120
Rym: I think he mentioned lacuna kill puppies for Satan.

209
00:12:58,521 --> 00:12:59,885
Rym: the rest escaped me at the moment.

210
00:13:00,106 --> 00:13:02,977
Rym: There's also dogs in the vineyard and Inspectors.

211
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:06,357
Scott: we've played Lacuna and we've played inspectors.

212
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:17,668
Scott: I haven't played kill puppies for Satan and I haven't played time for a primetime adventures, but Lacuna and inspectors are the awesome especially lacuna you any game by Jared Sorenson.

213
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:18,190
Scott: You should get.

214
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,621
Scott: That's their awesome games.

215
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,030
Scott: They're they're really good.

216
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:28,150
Scott: They're really simple actually a lot easier to learn the burning wheel and they'll really force you to kind of refine your role-playing chops.

217
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:34,230
Scott: Yeah, they're not really the greatest for like huge campaigns But they are excellent for like one-time convention games.

218
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,034
Scott: That's like perfect.

219
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:37,907
Scott: or yep friends coming over need a party game and you're tired.

220
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:38,932
Scott: apples to apples Perfect,

221
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:58,036
Rym: or if you want to get people who aren't great role players to be better role players play a game like inspectors, yeah where the actual game mechanics are really simple and the game really just forces you to Tell your part of the story and everyone takes turns telling their parts of the story and use rolled dice to find out if a good Happened or a bad thing happened.

222
00:13:58,156 --> 00:14:02,775
Scott: and if a bad thing happens the DM decides and they tell your part of the story for You.

223
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:02,876
Rym: yep.

224
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:11,510
Scott: All right What is your favorite out-of-the-box tabletop RPG setting without consideration the actual mechanics associated with using it?

225
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,880
Scott: So they're talking probably about like forgotten around.

226
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:15,930
Rym: my answer is forgotten realms.

227
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,675
Scott: My answer is I don't really.

228
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:21,106
Scott: I'm not a big fan of out-of-the-box settings so much.

229
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:22,210
Scott: Why I don't know.

230
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:23,574
Scott: Okay, maybe I can.

231
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:28,410
Rym: what makes an out-of-the-box setting any different than say a setting that our DM Alex Road?

232
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,073
Rym: I mean nothing.

233
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:31,041
Scott: I'm just not really into them so much.

234
00:14:31,282 --> 00:14:31,784
Scott: I'm not like.

235
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:32,727
Scott: I know a lot of people.

236
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:41,830
Scott: they're crazy You know with the world building like they're so into that You know developing world and like they also it tends to go along with people who like like living for a hockey comic books.

237
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:50,350
Scott: you know because it's like this universe and it's all about the setting and all the details of the setting and that it doesn't Excite me the way I know it excites a lot of other nerds and geeks out there.

238
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:58,220
Rym: The reason it excites me what the reason I like to play in a setting that's very fleshed out is Especially when there's a wealth of resources and it's commonly known like.

239
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,270
Rym: it's like forgotten realms where a lot of people know The basics of the setting in the history.

240
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:12,679
Rym: It's a lot easier to play in character and be able to liberally sprinkle details or know things that your character would know Without having to constantly ask what.

241
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:13,262
Rym: I know this.

242
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:14,890
Rym: Yeah, is it there that that's all fun?

243
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,810
Scott: That's all well and good.

244
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,543
Scott: But I'm saying is that it seems like there's a lot of people who are just into settings like.

245
00:15:19,563 --> 00:15:22,449
Scott: they just love settings and you Know there's nothing wrong with that.

246
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,703
Rym: If you're one of those people you would have probably been playing living Greyhawk Even though I think they killed that and now it's living forgotten realm.

247
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,050
Scott: I didn't say there's anything wrong with it.

248
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,354
Scott: I said I'm not one of those people.

249
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:33,104
Scott: so setting I don't really enjoy settings like set.

250
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:34,970
Scott: a setting alone doesn't like get me excited.

251
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,480
Scott: So I don't really like one over the other.

252
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,739
Scott: so maybe I could say like I don't know This is Star Wars RPG.

253
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,543
Scott: I could say that.

254
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:43,890
Scott: or there's the Cthulhu RPG.

255
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:56,090
Rym: so maybe I could say, you know 1920s call it Cthulhu or something like that, but See, I'll say this though pirate setting the shadow because it says independent of game mechanics the shadow run setting.

256
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:57,094
Scott: Oh shadow seems.

257
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:08,781
Rym: I mean it's futuristic cyberpunk plus Fantasy 7c is also kind of cool 7c is really cool and anything involving pirates But you know, none of them really in the air.

258
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:20,710
Rym: Yeah, none of them really get me that excited Actually one I thoroughly enjoyed and I really wish we had a DM who ran a great game But then he just kind of petered out which got happen often with multiple different DMS.

259
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,820
Rym: But we played an l5 our game Legend of the Five Rings.

260
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:26,127
Rym: That is a really cool setting.

261
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:27,090
Scott: It's alright.

262
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:27,717
Rym: Yeah, of course.

263
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:31,870
Rym: It's basically just semi mythical feudal magical Japan.

264
00:16:35,113 --> 00:16:40,529
Rym: Have you guys ever played a non grid miniatures game like war hammer or war machine machine?

265
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:42,502
Rym: and If so, how was your experience?

266
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:43,670
Rym: I'll let you feel this one Scott.

267
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:47,230
Scott: Well, I've never actually played war hammer or war machine even though I know of them.

268
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:53,210
Scott: I've played that mech warrior clicks game that sort of like mage knight and hero clicks, but with back warrior.

269
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:54,884
Rym: Yeah, I don't think that counts.

270
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:55,549
Scott: That was a tech.

271
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,320
Scott: It was a non grid miniatures game, but it was terrible.

272
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:05,066
Scott: independently of it the fact that it was non grid nous Battletech can be played without a grid as just a miniatures game.

273
00:17:05,086 --> 00:17:05,829
Rym: That's crazy.

274
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:11,589
Scott: It's basically, you know, I don't really think that it has that much of an advantage over battle tech on a hex map.

275
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,030
Scott: Well, it's basically the same game but with rulers.

276
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:19,210
Rym: Well, no because the difference it adds and this was brought into stark relief way back.

277
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:41,180
Rym: But I tried to play and played a little bit battle system, which used to be the official Dungeons & Dragons system for mass combat Which was you know, there's terrain and you give troops orders and orders get through and you say, you know march forward 100 meters and they'll march give or take a hundred meters forward and their formation might get messed up But you can't measure before you march.

278
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,288
Scott: So looking at that you kind of have a battle tech you can.

279
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,040
Scott: it's just You can measure whatever you want.

280
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,025
Rym: So you're not allowed to measure.

281
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:48,130
Rym: you kind of have to eyeball it.

282
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,679
Scott: That is I was talking specifically about the battle tech.

283
00:17:50,859 --> 00:18:01,750
Rym: Yeah, I'm talking about battle system where in that sense there's it's kind of a lot more realistic and that you have a Vague overview of what's going on as the commander of your army and you're sending troops out to do things.

284
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:10,001
Rym: But it's not like you can tell your troops to move forward eight hexes and then fire because you'll know that you'll be exactly in Range of shooting the tank that can't shoot back.

285
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:11,770
Rym: There's a lot more realism there.

286
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:14,950
Rym: Yeah, the only drawback is it takes a lot more time.

287
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:22,030
Rym: You need a basement that can go undisturbed for months on end as you play four hours of this game every Sunday.

288
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:25,930
Scott: Yeah, I'm not opposed to playing a non-grid miniatures game.

289
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:30,976
Scott: I'm actually I kind of like to but the problem is is that it costs a lot of money Especially something like Warhammer.

290
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:32,884
Scott: the setup is insanely long.

291
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,450
Scott: The play is insanely long.

292
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:38,268
Scott: It takes a lot of time with the rulers and such and it's just.

293
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,384
Scott: you know All that stuff around.

294
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:41,130
Scott: it is very difficult.

295
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:47,779
Scott: If you if I could say play Warhammer on the computer and get any units I want and get you know The rules and a PDF I'd be willing to play.

296
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:48,722
Scott: that probably see.

297
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:49,565
Rym: that is one thing.

298
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:56,508
Rym: games like that are really fun But they get really close to that line where you're better served by playing a really good PC war game.

299
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:58,212
Scott: Yep I don't.

300
00:18:58,593 --> 00:19:06,709
Rym: it's one of those things a hobby that I would definitely be into without question if I were a member of the member of the idle rich Mmm, which is still our goal.

301
00:19:07,072 --> 00:19:09,910
Scott: Yeah, if I had a basement I might set up something like that.

302
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,750
Scott: But I probably wouldn't play Warhammer or war machine even though I know they're okay.

303
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:21,503
Scott: I'd probably go for the one of the cheaper ones like Sutton with normal military soldier guys, you know They're like some old war like a Napoleonic war or something.

304
00:19:21,523 --> 00:19:21,945
Scott: I don't know.

305
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:22,507
Rym: All right.

306
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:23,310
Rym: This one's a long one.

307
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,013
Rym: I'll take this one.

308
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:32,550
Rym: I purchased a copy of Wario ware for the Wii based on all the hype You guys were spouting prior to its release emphasis added by Rym.

309
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:37,368
Rym: I would like to point out now this isn't the question that the hype was all pretty.

310
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,790
Rym: everything We said was basically the other Wario ware was great.

311
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:45,487
Rym: I'm really looking forward to this Wario ware as long as it's the same as that previous Wario ware.

312
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:46,210
Rym: It's gonna be great.

313
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:48,798
Scott: Yeah, anyway pretty much what we said.

314
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,150
Rym: Will you give me a refund for my wasted money?

315
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,433
Rym: No you're the dumbass.

316
00:19:52,453 --> 00:20:00,464
Rym: you listen to us and didn't do any other research and bought the game before you heard us review it because we Reviewed it like the day after it came out saying how shitty it was.

317
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:03,769
Scott: Yeah, I mean, come on He's gonna do everything we tell you to that.

318
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,889
Rym: Well, you should but the thing is you should wait until we review a game before you buy it.

319
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:16,176
Scott: Yeah, if you're if you're going out and buying products based on what people say who have not used that product yet That's your fault.

320
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:18,610
Rym: I like Wario ware for the Wii.

321
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:21,170
Rym: Maybe it has something to do with whom you're playing.

322
00:20:22,593 --> 00:20:23,843
Rym: That that sentence bothers me.

323
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:24,549
Rym: I'm just gonna skip it.

324
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,446
Rym: Yeah, I've heard from people who have played the prior Wario ware games that this iteration is pretty bad.

325
00:20:29,486 --> 00:20:30,630
Rym: That is a hundred percent, correct?

326
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:37,842
Rym: I've never played those that know how it compares Wario Where we is a garbage game and it should not be even looked at again.

327
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,749
Scott: No, I mean, I guess it's eager.

328
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:42,801
Scott: rent It'd be fun for like five minutes only in single-player.

329
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:45,030
Scott: Yeah, just rent it beat the single-player bring it back.

330
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,940
Scott: However be warned that you can use the game.

331
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,366
Scott: fly the Netflix of video games.

332
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:49,767
Scott: that'll work.

333
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:53,806
Rym: be warned However that if you just hold the Wiimote in front of you and kind of shake it you can win 80% of the minigames.

334
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:56,318
Scott: Yeah, but it won't be enough to actually beat it.

335
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,069
Scott: You'll actually you know, plus it will be less fun if you try that.

336
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,058
Scott: Okay, getting back to the original topic.

337
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:02,400
Scott: Okay.

338
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:08,890
Scott: I guess these are all the same person even though we don't know who that is What elements does it take to make an enjoyable game in other words?

339
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,625
Scott: Why is XCOM UFO defense a better game than lair or is it not a better game?

340
00:21:12,665 --> 00:21:13,830
Rym: Well, it is a better game.

341
00:21:13,911 --> 00:21:15,845
Scott: I don't know about lair but it is a better game.

342
00:21:16,248 --> 00:21:21,070
Scott: Okay I think for me at least that there are many things that can make a game fun, you know.

343
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,690
Scott: Like for example, I'm playing that Lego Star Wars right now and it's fun because they're amusing things going on.

344
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:31,570
Rym: But in other ways the game is not so fun or portal which is fun because it's just so slick and so perfectly designed.

345
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:36,390
Scott: Yeah, but I think the things that make me feel like a video game is fun.

346
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:46,830
Scott: the thing that you know I enjoy when I'm playing video games is when there are decisions to make or there are tests of my skill And they are or appear to be meaningful.

347
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:50,321
Scott: You know where I have a choice and that choice feels meaningful.

348
00:21:50,482 --> 00:21:54,119
Scott: or if they're gonna test to see you know Can I do this?

349
00:21:54,261 --> 00:21:55,189
Scott: and it's it's me.

350
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:55,531
Scott: you know.

351
00:21:55,551 --> 00:22:08,234
Scott: the amount of skill that I have at doing that thing feels like it makes a difference in terms of whether I Achieve or fail and that that is what makes a video game fun when I feel like I am challenged and then I rise to The challenge

352
00:22:08,957 --> 00:22:09,741
Rym: that's pretty much it.

353
00:22:09,902 --> 00:22:10,083
Rym: Yeah.

354
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:15,950
Rym: Hey Roman Scott Why the hell do you guys think everyone stopped playing pogeyman pogeymenas?

355
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:25,296
Scott: I believe he means Pokemon because it just after you beat the game and the earthbound part of the game is over It just becomes a World of Warcraft Grinding game pretty much.

356
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:35,310
Rym: This is probably in reference to the fact that people on our forums were losing their shit over Pokemon and now only one person who has always lost his shit over Pokemon is continuing to lose it.

357
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,118
Rym: Yeah, it's like else has their shit back.

358
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,871
Scott: I never assumed more of Pokemon than it was I had.

359
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:44,533
Scott: this is the third the most recent Pokemon games the third real Pokemon game I've played.

360
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:47,585
Rym: I had never played a Pokemon game before and you play it and it's a.

361
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:47,887
Scott: it's an.

362
00:22:48,087 --> 00:22:52,350
Scott: it's an RPG Almost as good as earthbound and earthbound is a great single-player RPG.

363
00:22:52,631 --> 00:23:03,287
Scott: And then as soon as it's over and there's no more new RPG stuff to do The only thing left to do is level up Pokemon and collect Pokemon, which is not fun Unless you like that sort of thing, which I don't pretty

364
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:08,927
Rym: much people a lot of people try to make the argument when we talk about how shitty World of Warcraft is that.

365
00:23:10,652 --> 00:23:13,487
Rym: Well, you guys play other games that just as bad.

366
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:14,050
Rym: do the things.

367
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:15,149
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

368
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:25,346
Rym: And I just have to point out once again that any time someone makes that claim usually by the time they make it we've already Given up or figured out on whatever game that we're talking about and Pokemon is no exception.

369
00:23:25,466 --> 00:23:29,070
Rym: I have not touched Pokemon in like five months.

370
00:23:29,211 --> 00:23:30,988
Rym: I don't think I'm ever gonna even put it back in my DS.

371
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,304
Scott: I might but I can't for I can't.

372
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:34,210
Scott: I wouldn't plan on it.

373
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,777
Scott: It might just be like a spur-of-the-moment thing.

374
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:39,695
Rym: if I lost my Pokemon cartridge right now I wouldn't even care.

375
00:23:40,016 --> 00:23:41,501
Scott: Yeah, I wouldn't be too upset.

376
00:23:41,762 --> 00:23:42,786
Rym: I wouldn't be so upset at all.

377
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:48,602
Scott: All right What do you think is the most fundamental component to obtaining high scores and FPS?

378
00:23:48,622 --> 00:23:50,970
Scott: is tactics precision mouse controlling reflexes?

379
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,095
Scott: Defending attacking fighting the team going solo center.

380
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:57,006
Rym: I think I can answer them because I'm no slouch.

381
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,350
Rym: I'm real good at FPS.

382
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:01,966
Rym: I've been playing them for almost as long as they've existed better than most people.

383
00:24:01,986 --> 00:24:02,810
Scott: but you know fatality?

384
00:24:02,951 --> 00:24:03,374
Scott: No, I'm not.

385
00:24:03,394 --> 00:24:08,117
Scott: we're sort of like in that in-between area like where you know Millions of people around the world playing FPS is.

386
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:11,668
Scott: we're better than most people, you know any random guy.

387
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:15,650
Scott: we can probably beat them But there are those people who are on like the professional level and we are not on their level.

388
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:18,293
Rym: I am better than Scott though, you know It's sort of like.

389
00:24:18,715 --> 00:24:22,230
Scott: it's sort of like the guy bought baseball player in town would get crushed in the major league.

390
00:24:23,032 --> 00:24:25,730
Rym: Oh and any old style or twitch FPS?

391
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,888
Rym: You can't pretend that you have even a chance against me as was demonstrated when we tried to play quake 3.

392
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:31,992
Scott: I could with some Practices.

393
00:24:32,414 --> 00:24:33,881
Rym: Yes with some practices.

394
00:24:33,901 --> 00:24:39,542
Scott: Yeah, you're dying like a few minutes More than that as ice that map was not my.

395
00:24:39,662 --> 00:24:40,766
Rym: you chose that bad.

396
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:42,030
Rym: I chose what poorly.

397
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:45,993
Rym: Anyway Pretty much.

398
00:24:46,254 --> 00:24:51,090
Rym: It was 20 minutes of me standing anywhere with a railgun shooting Scott as soon as he spawned.

399
00:24:51,911 --> 00:24:54,902
Rym: Anyway, but you want to know how I got so good at FPS is.

400
00:24:55,524 --> 00:25:00,486
Rym: I've been playing them for over a decade Semi-continuously and that's the only way to get good.

401
00:25:00,526 --> 00:25:05,180
Rym: and furthermore Playing modern FPS is will not make you great at.

402
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,483
Rym: FPS is make you pretty good at.

403
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:12,362
Rym: FPS is but like Team Fortress 2 Will not give you FPS skills beyond a very low level.

404
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,250
Rym: No, you want to get good really good.

405
00:25:14,651 --> 00:25:23,750
Rym: You have to get a copy of quake to beat the game first off just to get you know The basic skills and then find some people or some bots and play the game without cheating by the way.

406
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:28,429
Rym: Yes play quake to lithium deathmatch until you are good at it.

407
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:34,970
Rym: Then play quake 3 until you beat it on the hardest difficulty level and then play that with your friends until you never lose.

408
00:25:35,632 --> 00:25:44,770
Scott: And if you do that, then you're problem is don't just play with your friends because you'll run into a situation where you know Some of our some one friend of ours told a story that he went to his friend's house.

409
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:48,210
Scott: They were all playing quake 3 right and they were all like, yeah, we're so great.

410
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:52,470
Scott: This was go Joe, I believe yeah, but they were only playing against each other and they thought they were so great.

411
00:25:52,892 --> 00:25:54,820
Scott: So Scott Johnson sat down and played it.

412
00:25:54,841 --> 00:25:56,910
Scott: just killed them all killed them all killed them all killed them all killed.

413
00:25:57,171 --> 00:26:02,910
Scott: So you have to actually find people at a at the higher level, you know, that will just kill you instantly.

414
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:05,425
Scott: It's that you can build your skill up to.

415
00:26:05,445 --> 00:26:13,187
Rym: yeah also, you have to figure out ways to play that will maximize skill gaining for example in counter-strike.

416
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:25,730
Rym: if you want to get really Good at counter-strike in a hurry only play FY maps and play them all the time And if you're dominating a server leave and find a different server that you can't dominate and stay there until you dominate it.

417
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:29,650
Scott: You need to sort of raise the bar in order to actually jump over it.

418
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:37,247
Scott: You know if you keep the bar at four feet high and keep trying to jump higher You'll still only be four feet high jumping good plus by playing on those FY maps.

419
00:26:37,427 --> 00:26:38,598
Rym: think about it now It's not.

420
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:46,810
Rym: you know a minute of Maneuver maneuver maneuver maneuver and then the shootout and then you got to spend all this time between shootouts not learning a lot of skills.

421
00:26:47,631 --> 00:26:49,801
Rym: You have to play just the shootout continuously.

422
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:50,383
Rym: Yep.

423
00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:51,970
Scott: I'm really good at FY maps.

424
00:26:52,271 --> 00:27:00,723
Rym: Yeah, and if you wanted to get really like I think the game that probably made me gave me the most skill over time was playing Action quake - and I have several friends who were agreed.

425
00:27:00,763 --> 00:27:05,242
Rym: that game will give you some Motherfucking skill in a hurry if you get enough people to play it.

426
00:27:05,282 --> 00:27:05,483
Scott: Yeah.

427
00:27:05,744 --> 00:27:07,190
Rym: Yeah, the game is hard as ball.

428
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:07,754
Scott: I think.

429
00:27:07,815 --> 00:27:15,070
Scott: in general the problem is a lot of the twitch FPS's have sort of fallen out of favor and they're mostly old and new FPS's are not that way.

430
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:21,970
Scott: So it's very hard to get skill in sort of the twitch aiming high speed FPS's with the modern FPS.

431
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:27,368
Scott: Yeah, but if you get the skill in the old FPS's when you start playing modern news slow ones You're gonna rock.

432
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:49,028
Rym: I mean think of this when quake 3 came out Everyone was excited about it and all the hardcore people were like, oh man all the mods are moving to quake 3 we're gonna play quake 3. and then everyone started playing quake 3 and All the hardcore people immediately complained about how slow and easy the game was compared to quake 2. it was how big the models were and how easy it was to hit people.

433
00:27:49,048 --> 00:27:56,049
Scott: and Yeah, yeah, if you want just find out whatever game fatality is playing and play that and that way you'll.

434
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,810
Rym: yeah Cuz I don't think that guy would be playing a game with a low cat.

435
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,246
Scott: No, he mostly plays like quake 4 and stuff now, which I heard is pretty twitch.

436
00:28:02,287 --> 00:28:06,107
Scott: So yeah I played it once and it was pretty twitch.

437
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:10,843
Rym: So Okay, what is the worst game you have ever paid for?

438
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:11,747
Rym: monkey ball for the Wii.

439
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:12,650
Scott: monkey ball for the Wii?

440
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:13,916
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

441
00:28:14,178 --> 00:28:16,008
Rym: I've never paid for a worse game.

442
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:17,866
Scott: Nope, don't think so.

443
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:21,585
Scott: Okay, have you ever owned and used a Tamagotchi?

444
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:22,390
Scott: I never owned one.

445
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:23,455
Scott: I think I might have used one.

446
00:28:23,596 --> 00:28:26,170
Scott: once I got a funny story about one at summer camp.

447
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:33,805
Scott: one of the counselors in the in the adjacent cabin had a Tamagotchi that was caring for and People would sneak in there and feed it till it died to upset him.

448
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:41,690
Rym: now That raises an interesting ethical question At what point is that murder and not just nothing?

449
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,838
Scott: When it's a biological organism that you fed until?

450
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:48,190
Rym: but what if we made an artificial intelligence that was equally complex to a human?

451
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:49,460
Scott: Intelligence, I don't know.

452
00:28:49,501 --> 00:28:49,783
Scott: That's it.

453
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:50,610
Scott: That's for another question.

454
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:58,928
Rym: If money and resources were no object and you were asked to make a video game exactly as you wanted What would it be like now?

455
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:03,001
Rym: He goes on to say, you know, what platform would be for now?

456
00:29:03,482 --> 00:29:06,170
Rym: you made a really fundamental error in asking this question.

457
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,369
Rym: You know you asked what platform, you know Xbox ps3 we all of them.

458
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:13,501
Rym: No, no, no, if money and resources are no object one.

459
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:15,066
Rym: I make my own platform.

460
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:20,259
Rym: That is exactly what I guess I would make an arcade machine To if money is no object.

461
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:23,030
Rym: I make perfect VR that and that's my game.

462
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:24,809
Rym: Yeah, this question takes way too much.

463
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:25,372
Scott: It does.

464
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:29,267
Rym: follow-up question if you had to change the games that had mass-market appeal.

465
00:29:29,307 --> 00:29:30,170
Rym: Would you change anything?

466
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,170
Scott: Yes, you're making the false assumption that my perfect game has no mass-market appeal.

467
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:40,730
Scott: Also, I would also with infinite money any game can have mass-market appeal because I can have infinite marketing.

468
00:29:41,272 --> 00:29:46,330
Rym: Also, if it's perfect VR, I just tack on some sort of VR sex hall.

469
00:29:46,894 --> 00:29:48,165
Scott: Yeah, sex and violence.

470
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:48,589
Scott: There you go.

471
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:57,224
Rym: Yeah You go into the fighting room and then you go into the sexing room and then humanity starves to death because no one leaves The VR world, you know, that might be the perfect game.

472
00:29:57,264 --> 00:29:58,229
Scott: is the VR sexing room?

473
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:00,015
Rym: Aliens come in.

474
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:01,143
Scott: I just answered the whole thing.

475
00:30:01,183 --> 00:30:09,910
Rym: No because to paraphrase Futurama When Fry is first exposed to the VR internet of the future, he walks into the sex area.

476
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:14,469
Rym: He walks out five minutes later and says well, I am now bored with sex.

477
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:16,138
Scott: It's true.

478
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:18,584
Rym: I Can say one thing?

479
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:27,545
Rym: Furries and pretty much anyone with a fetish no matter how weird Would pretty much be in heaven at that point probably if you could yeah.

480
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:28,046
Scott: Yeah.

481
00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:34,502
Scott: So yeah, that's the game I'd make if I'd infinite money, okay What is the longest in terms of length board game you've ever played?

482
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,288
Rym: I marker it took four hours.

483
00:30:36,428 --> 00:30:38,596
Scott: We're about We're about to play it.

484
00:30:38,676 --> 00:30:40,063
Scott: It's the second time rims played.

485
00:30:40,084 --> 00:30:46,165
Scott: It's the first time I've played it But I think I have played games of Monopoly that were pretty goddamn long.

486
00:30:46,205 --> 00:30:51,410
Rym: there was that one game of Monopoly We played with Ken and Nicole and most of the original FRC.

487
00:30:51,711 --> 00:30:56,850
Scott: I've also played some games of risk that were pretty goddamn and I think Peterson 3 or maybe Sally and also Shogun.

488
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,074
Scott: That was pretty goddamn long.

489
00:30:58,254 --> 00:30:59,498
Rym: Yeah, but not four hours.

490
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:05,637
Scott: No, I guess we played RPGs for like a day straight So like D&D for a day straight, does that count?

491
00:31:05,838 --> 00:31:07,524
Rym: Yeah in high school every Sunday.

492
00:31:07,564 --> 00:31:12,890
Rym: We used to play this board game, though Yeah, we used to play D&D from like 10 in the morning until like 10 11.

493
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:19,458
Scott: I mean even now when we play burning wheel on the weekend, it takes more than four hours to play You know, so even die marker.

494
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:22,754
Scott: take if it took four hours be less than you know Just an RPG.

495
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:27,357
Rym: it still might be that one game of Monopoly play battle tech that's gone on pretty low God battle.

496
00:31:27,377 --> 00:31:28,610
Rym: that games took eight hours easily

497
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,573
Scott: yeah, but that

498
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:48,298
Rym: that one game of Monopoly just kept going and going and eventually everyone was bankrupt except Ken and Nicole and Neither one of them would just quit and give up because the other one would say well then I win if you quit and neither one of them could lose because they both had a ton of money and It was basically hours and hours of them playing.

499
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:52,370
Scott: Monopoly was actually x-men monopoly and they had mutant powers that were kind of stupid.

500
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:54,837
Rym: Oh, yeah, I forgot all about that.

501
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:55,540
Scott: Don't play.

502
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,345
Scott: Oh, don't play any monopoly variants.

503
00:31:57,887 --> 00:31:58,168
Scott: Actually.

504
00:31:58,188 --> 00:31:59,736
Scott: I have a monopoly That's like the best one.

505
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:09,050
Rym: Actually if you want to play Monopoly Play it one more time and play it with the actual rules and I mean read the rule book do what it says.

506
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:09,688
Scott: Got it.

507
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:16,392
Scott: If the rule book you have doesn't seem very different from what you think the rules are go online and print out the oldest Monopoly rule book.

508
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:18,736
Scott: you can find a picture of very simply those rules.

509
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:20,480
Rym: Here's what matters one.

510
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:26,022
Rym: if Someone lands on free parking nothing happens to.

511
00:32:26,483 --> 00:32:31,096
Rym: if someone lands on a property and does not buy it It immediately goes up for auction and is sold.

512
00:32:31,537 --> 00:32:31,717
Scott: Yep.

513
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:34,725
Rym: Those two things make Monopoly almost a worthwhile game.

514
00:32:35,006 --> 00:32:43,130
Scott: Yep, but not quite Alright, okay do either of you miss FMV's in PC gaming up they went somewhere.

515
00:32:43,572 --> 00:32:44,175
Scott: Well, I don't know.

516
00:32:44,236 --> 00:32:46,428
Scott: I see lots of FMV's in games all the time.

517
00:32:46,488 --> 00:32:49,390
Scott: However Personally, I'm a fan of the game.

518
00:32:49,470 --> 00:33:00,842
Scott: The reason I'm such a fan of games like half-life 2 and it's it's sequels and all those other you know valve games Is that they sort of you know They have this very cinematic experience where you don't really have these.

519
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:09,180
Scott: you don't stop the game and watch a video that often You know, I mean a couple times but what you do is add You lock the protagonist in a small room.

520
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,130
Rym: You can't escape all two NPCs blather on for five minutes.

521
00:33:12,271 --> 00:33:13,118
Rym: Yep, which?

522
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,890
Rym: because that's so much different It's not that much different.

523
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,875
Scott: but you know the the plot sort of.

524
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:23,210
Scott: you know, it happens around you and it does provide a more cinematic experience that you know.

525
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:28,541
Scott: When you switch to an FMV, you're really taking me out of the zone here And I'm like, I noticed that it's an FMV now.

526
00:33:28,621 --> 00:33:31,451
Rym: I was cool with like the Resident Evil 4 Resident.

527
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,374
Scott: I say it was very good.

528
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:33,438
Scott: I say that was.

529
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,120
Rym: the problem is every game has now been aping that Poorly have they?

530
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,584
Scott: I don't know.

531
00:33:38,624 --> 00:33:40,858
Rym: a lot of new games I've been told cuz I avoid game.

532
00:33:40,878 --> 00:33:42,990
Scott: Resident Evil 4 is the only game I've played like that.

533
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,257
Scott: So I guess if there are other games doing it, they must suck and I'm not playing them.

534
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:49,644
Rym: I guess it's just Theoretically.

535
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:58,332
Rym: I like games to have good stories But it bothers me if the only way to present the story is to stop the game and show me a movie because then I might As well just show me all the movies.

536
00:33:58,554 --> 00:33:59,140
Scott: now the game.

537
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,549
Rym: There are two cut times where I'm really really okay with an FMV.

538
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:05,879
Rym: one if you have a starting FMV and an ending FMV.

539
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,498
Scott: Yeah, like an FMV at the very beginning, you know, even before I push start on the main menu That's fine.

540
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:13,964
Scott: Alright, that could be cool.

541
00:34:14,143 --> 00:34:19,358
Rym: or like an FMV at the climax of the game like the climax of the plot and everything.

542
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:23,500
Rym: when now You watch a 10-minute movie and then the game continues right there.

543
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,929
Scott: the one thing I think though that really helps out the way half-life 2 does it even when it traps you there and you know Forces you to.

544
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:35,340
Rym: you know, I play games with myself Like how far can I jump off of this computer that stuff but wonder if I can kill anything?

545
00:34:35,681 --> 00:34:41,040
Scott: But also is that the FMV is generally they have like this incredible like pre-rendered graphic quality.

546
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:50,159
Scott: That is so much different from the in-game Like, you know live rendering and it's that also sort of takes you out and in final fantasy 7 was notorious for that.

547
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:56,810
Scott: Yeah, so I actually like it better when you just keep do it within the game rendering engine, you know And that way it looks the same.

548
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,160
Scott: It doesn't sort of throw me for a loop.

549
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,070
Scott: I know people are crazy about their graphics like OMG.

550
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:04,060
Scott: Look at them graphics and that FMV, but it's pre-rendered.

551
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,903
Scott: It's not exciting.

552
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:11,920
Scott: pre-rendered is actually the reason mist looks the way it looks even on shitty old dogs Also barely animated mostly static nothing moves.

553
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,517
Scott: Yeah, and that is the reason that you know graphics and games is ruined all the way today.

554
00:35:16,537 --> 00:35:16,818
Scott: today.

555
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:20,359
Rym: So, all right, how the hell do you get good at FPS?

556
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,900
Scott: We just answered baby some Ted if we can let it duplicate get in here because we didn't really check him.

557
00:35:25,141 --> 00:35:25,764
Scott: All right next.

558
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:36,182
Rym: All right, you two come across as incredibly competitive Especially with each other if you ever tried to work together at a board game like Lord of the Rings or a video game Cooperatively.

559
00:35:36,323 --> 00:35:41,380
Rym: well, well, we played the Lord of the Rings game at our way.

560
00:35:42,443 --> 00:35:43,390
Rym: I like that game a lot.

561
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,235
Rym: I am a little game.

562
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:44,900
Rym: It's a great game.

563
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,502
Rym: I own it.

564
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:49,633
Rym: the thing that you suck you weren't you didn't even participate in the victory.

565
00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:51,860
Scott: I don't think I've played it enough time.

566
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,280
Rym: So everyone other than Scott was determined to beat that game on the difficult difficulty.

567
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:58,780
Scott: I had already played it a few times and decided it was crap.

568
00:35:59,062 --> 00:36:10,163
Rym: so we kept playing and kept playing it and I realized the benefit of that game because when we beat it like we got to the end and I think it Luke was the one who had the ring and he did all the checks and we stopped.

569
00:36:10,224 --> 00:36:14,098
Rym: and we'd been playing this game so long and so hard over so many weeks and always failing.

570
00:36:14,118 --> 00:36:15,948
Rym: and We finally did it.

571
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,426
Rym: and we all look around and someone says Did we just win?

572
00:36:19,447 --> 00:36:20,774
Rym: and he picks up the real book.

573
00:36:20,794 --> 00:36:21,296
Rym: He flips through it.

574
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:21,960
Rym: We look at the board.

575
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:31,018
Rym: Yeah we just won and we jumped up yelling and screaming and ran around the room for like 10 minutes and High-fiving everyone.

576
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:34,993
Rym: and there there's a couple there's a hundred two hundred people there and That was worth it.

577
00:36:35,013 --> 00:36:39,910
Scott: Yeah, I generally do like co-op games or you know, people are working together.

578
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,803
Scott: I mean, sometimes we play Advance Wars like two on two or something like that.

579
00:36:42,843 --> 00:36:44,290
Scott: That's that's fun times.

580
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:47,610
Scott: The only thing is it playing Lego Star Wars recently, you know.

581
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:53,650
Scott: It's like when Rym will run off the screen and try to trap me or playing River City Ransom and he'll beat me up.

582
00:36:53,871 --> 00:37:07,470
Rym: I point out that Scott says I run off the screen and traffic and usually what it is is we're playing the game and Scott just runs off somewhere and without saying anything because he wants to do some puzzle and he just runs off and then as soon As he hits the edge of the screen, he can't run any further.

583
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:11,564
Rym: He yells at me who is trying to actually beat the game for not following.

584
00:37:12,026 --> 00:37:13,250
Scott: I'm the leader and you're the follower.

585
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,035
Scott: That is how it works.

586
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:16,490
Scott: Yeah, no, but co-op games are fun.

587
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:22,290
Scott: The problem is sometimes if the people don't really work together so much you can sort of get diversions.

588
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:31,831
Scott: Also, like sometimes they'll play a competitive game and say we're gonna work together And what ends up happening is we get we destroy everyone else and then we end up turning on each other to see who actually Wins.

589
00:37:32,372 --> 00:37:32,693
Rym: Yeah.

590
00:37:33,355 --> 00:37:33,615
Scott: Yeah.

591
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:39,710
Rym: Oh, I really like games like especially board games that have conditions for shared victory.

592
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,219
Scott: Yeah, that's where it's good times.

593
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,150
Rym: I think Illuminati did that really well.

594
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,790
Scott: Yeah, because you can trick someone into thinking you're gonna give him a shared victory and then dick him.

595
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,861
Rym: But also at the same time more than one.

596
00:37:48,901 --> 00:37:54,970
Rym: Scott and I have both just said You know what fuck everybody and just one Illuminati by just totally ganging up on it.

597
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,499
Scott: Yeah, cuz like we just say in there you look at the board and you say hey Rym You know, we could get a shared victory if we do this.

598
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,183
Scott: No one can stop us.

599
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:00,786
Scott: Okay, dink.

600
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:01,510
Scott: We got it.

601
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:05,036
Scott: And co-op games are fun like co-op doom.

602
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:06,160
Rym: good time playing doom.

603
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,450
Rym: co-op is great and also crystal chronicles with three other people.

604
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:10,173
Scott: That's good.

605
00:38:10,393 --> 00:38:14,328
Rym: But still seriously one of the best gaming experiences of my life.

606
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:21,130
Scott: All right With all these conventions you talk about as a little surprised to see you hadn't talked about quake con.

607
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,876
Scott: Unless you haven't heard of it then it's understandable.

608
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:24,402
Scott: Well, I know about quake con.

609
00:38:24,422 --> 00:38:25,345
Scott: It's in Texas, right?

610
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:26,550
Scott: And did they play quake?

611
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,476
Rym: What do you think about quake con?

612
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:29,641
Rym: Have you ever considered going?

613
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:31,650
Scott: I never really considered going so much.

614
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,440
Scott: I mean, I like FPS is but I don't like enough.

615
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,566
Scott: an FPS is enough to go.

616
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:44,219
Rym: the farthest I've ever gone for a convention was Chicago for anime central, which is a pretty big anime con or Raleigh for an anime con where I was staff.

617
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,390
Rym: Yep, and beyond that we're going to PAX.

618
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:51,810
Scott: I was a guest at quake con and they paid for my badge and they paid for my plane in my hotel.

619
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:54,362
Rym: I would go yeah, I guess for a gaming con.

620
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:59,370
Rym: There's a million gaming cons near me So I'm not gonna go far even for a prestigious or big one unless it's Essen.

621
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:09,170
Scott: Yeah, I'm mostly gonna go to like, you know, I mostly go to board gaming and tabletop role-playing game cons You know because that's where you really play with other people for video games, you know, we have internet.

622
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,636
Scott: I can play quake in my house.

623
00:39:10,676 --> 00:39:13,810
Scott: going somewhere to play quake is sort of outdated, you know.

624
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:21,562
Rym: I mean I used to go to land parties, especially in high school before there were Lands and then that kind of died in college when I lived on a land.

625
00:39:21,582 --> 00:39:23,848
Scott: Yeah, so it's sort of like.

626
00:39:23,868 --> 00:39:24,570
Scott: what's the purpose?

627
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:29,689
Scott: You know, I like good to go to a gaming concert tabletop and role-playing action where I need other people in the room with me.

628
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:30,634
Rym: You know, all right.

629
00:39:30,674 --> 00:39:33,690
Rym: What games would you murder each other for to have on the virtual console?

630
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:39,536
Scott: I don't think I'd murder anyone for any game Way to kill the spirit of that question.

631
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:42,808
Scott: Maybe if it was the true virtual reality sex.

632
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:45,395
Scott: Oh then I would murder somebody.

633
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:49,149
Rym: I guess just what games should be on the virtual console that aren't.

634
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,428
Scott: oh I know a game I would murder you for to be on the virtual console, huh?

635
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,182
Scott: Push a button and two rims pop out.

636
00:39:54,647 --> 00:40:00,174
Scott: that way I you know I'd kill you and then there would be two and then I'd be like, hey actually maybe you could have that threesome You've always wanted.

637
00:40:00,415 --> 00:40:01,118
Scott: Oh, but it would be.

638
00:40:01,178 --> 00:40:03,670
Rym: does the week does the we excite you at all?

639
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:05,095
Rym: If so, what the fuck for?

640
00:40:05,115 --> 00:40:08,307
Rym: well my we excites me on a daily basis, but that's really none of your business.

641
00:40:08,648 --> 00:40:16,620
Rym: Oh I saw that question a minute ago and I've been staring at it the whole time Just waiting to say that the we only excites me in it.

642
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:26,670
Rym: the unfulfilled potential, but I don't really get excited about it I think is Part of this question was written back when we were still in the weed route and now we got Mario Galaxy coming out today.

643
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:29,107
Scott: Yeah, now everyone knows the day we recorded this.

644
00:40:29,248 --> 00:40:37,319
Rym: no I'm excited about these games and I'm excited about eventually games using the DS and I Think a lot's gonna come to the Wii.

645
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,030
Rym: I don't think the Wii is gonna die anytime soon.

646
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,518
Rym: I think we're gonna have some great stuff for it.

647
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:40,859
Scott: Yeah.

648
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,744
Scott: All right.

649
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:46,183
Scott: Oh What would it take for you to buy a 360 PS 3 besides more free time?

650
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:56,671
Rym: Well more free time a ps3 There's almost nothing because I can't imagine a game that would come out for the ps3 That would warrant the cost that wouldn't also come out for the 360.

651
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:58,683
Scott: Yeah, I mean for me for that right now.

652
00:40:58,804 --> 00:41:04,169
Scott: if I look at the ps3 There are some games on there that I might want to play but if I look at the price I say no.

653
00:41:04,552 --> 00:41:11,970
Scott: So in order for me to buy a ps3 I'd literally have to be so incredibly rich and have so much free time that I played all the other games.

654
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:15,110
Scott: I want to play more than those games and still want to play more games.

655
00:41:15,852 --> 00:41:16,976
Scott: The 360.

656
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:24,744
Rym: if I had more free time if I didn't if I was in a podcaster, we'd probably have two 360s Yeah, probably and an HDTV cuz that's two HDTV.

657
00:41:24,784 --> 00:41:28,004
Rym: so we could play against each other Probably seriously.

658
00:41:28,145 --> 00:41:28,770
Rym: That's not a joke.

659
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:37,237
Rym: We would probably seriously each have a 360 and a computer in our bedrooms and Yeah, the 360 is fucking awesome.

660
00:41:37,398 --> 00:41:39,967
Rym: It's pretty good almost entirely because of Xbox Live.

661
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:40,850
Scott: I mean right now.

662
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:41,875
Scott: I mean look at me right now.

663
00:41:41,895 --> 00:41:44,770
Scott: I just I have more video games than I have time to play.

664
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,298
Rym: I just bought a thousand dollar office chair.

665
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:50,930
Scott: every every minute of the day that I want to play a video game.

666
00:41:51,251 --> 00:41:54,143
Scott: I have a video game available more than one.

667
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:56,010
Scott: that design it fills my desire.

668
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:59,830
Scott: So why in the world would I buy another video game until I beat one?

669
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:05,581
Scott: I've got and thus, you know that that's pretty much how it goes It's barely even spend money on gaming anymore.

670
00:42:05,641 --> 00:42:07,630
Rym: because I mean, what am I gonna buy now?

671
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:12,447
Rym: I'm buying a go board because I've exhausted almost the entirety of German board gaming.

672
00:42:12,467 --> 00:42:14,698
Rym: Yep That's it.

673
00:42:15,062 --> 00:42:18,216
Scott: All right Has a video game made you cry scream?

674
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:22,510
Scott: We talked about this every yes didn't as a video gamer made you cry scream.

675
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,710
Scott: We just talked about sad video go sad.

676
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,654
Rym: How about scream?

677
00:42:25,694 --> 00:42:26,758
Rym: because I've had a few games.

678
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:27,240
Rym: startle me.

679
00:42:27,261 --> 00:42:29,450
Scott: the end of Zelda 1 when I was a kid was fucking scary.

680
00:42:29,802 --> 00:42:32,214
Scott: Yeah Doo doo doo doo doo

681
00:42:32,475 --> 00:42:47,132
Rym: when I actually when I saw the hammer doo doo when I was playing Zelda 2 and I saw the hammer for the first time and I cast the jump spell and I jumped over that guy because I couldn't fight him because I wasn't that good at that game and I had one life left and almost no health.

682
00:42:47,453 --> 00:43:10,924
Rym: and I went and I was about to get the hammer and I had it and then I Grabbed it and the standard going dah, dah, dah, dah, and I went yes and then one of those maces came flying over and hit me and I died and I went No, and then I yanked on the controller because I was mad and that unplugged the power and I went And my mom came in thinking I cut my finger off or something

683
00:43:11,265 --> 00:43:15,739
Scott: also in Zelda 2 Yeah, that that other island as soon as you get the raft and go across the ocean.

684
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:18,106
Scott: It's scary over there real scary.

685
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:21,979
Rym: Also, I Screamed once when someone was playing.

686
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:28,803
Rym: I forget what one of those, you know Resident Evil kind of games it was but I was watching someone else play it and I wasn't really paying attention.

687
00:43:29,264 --> 00:43:34,264
Scott: and then something jumped out and I went ah Yeah, eternal darkness a few times jumped out at you and it's sort of.

688
00:43:34,284 --> 00:43:37,923
Scott: it's not like a cry or a scream But it's like boo, you know surprise and I go,

689
00:43:38,024 --> 00:43:46,444
Rym: ah, yeah surprise I was frightened and so was Scott for a few seconds by one of the thing the insanity things that did near the end of The game just that one.

690
00:43:46,565 --> 00:43:51,022
Scott: Yeah Do you really throw controllers slash mice in anger?

691
00:43:51,142 --> 00:43:53,530
Scott: Well when I was a kid, I'd throw the NES controller around.

692
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:54,894
Rym: I'd ever see.

693
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,745
Rym: every kid had a different mode of dealing with their video game.

694
00:43:58,785 --> 00:44:01,722
Rym: frustration the video game nerd Watching him do stuff.

695
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:02,449
Rym: That's exactly it.

696
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,690
Rym: That feeling was expressed in different ways by different kids some of my friends through him.

697
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:10,470
Rym: Some of my friends would pull on him thus pulling the Nintendo out, which I only did once or twice.

698
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:14,868
Rym: I was the kind of kid who had squeezed the controller as hard as I could.

699
00:44:14,888 --> 00:44:20,287
Scott: just Yep Yeah, but not anymore.

700
00:44:20,347 --> 00:44:24,710
Scott: now I'd really video games don't anger me so much cuz I just if I games is gonna anger me.

701
00:44:24,931 --> 00:44:25,738
Scott: I just stopped playing.

702
00:44:25,758 --> 00:44:26,342
Rym: that's cuz you don't?

703
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,122
Scott: when I was a kid I paid $50 to that game.

704
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,710
Scott: That was the only game I had and I had too much free time and not enough game.

705
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,085
Rym: Also when I was a kid, I wasn't gonna let the video game beat me.

706
00:44:35,245 --> 00:44:50,062
Rym: Oh, hey video game No way was gonna be playing Mario 3 get near the end of the game I would die like nine times in a row on one world in world 7 one level in world 7. and You know the seventh or eighth time you die the ninth time you die.

707
00:44:50,102 --> 00:44:50,483
Rym: That's it.

708
00:44:50,784 --> 00:44:54,675
Scott: Hmm in Smash Brothers Melee What characters do you play Falco?

709
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:58,206
Scott: I play as Samus mostly but I also go with dr.

710
00:44:58,246 --> 00:44:58,648
Scott: Mario.

711
00:44:58,668 --> 00:44:59,932
Scott: I'm pretty good with dr Mario.

712
00:45:00,435 --> 00:45:01,721
Scott: I pretty much also I you.

713
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:03,750
Scott: I tend to use all the characters mostly.

714
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:04,353
Scott: I mean, there's some.

715
00:45:04,394 --> 00:45:05,178
Scott: I don't use it all like.

716
00:45:05,198 --> 00:45:08,596
Scott: I don't really use Captain Falcon really, but you know I spread it around.

717
00:45:08,636 --> 00:45:11,429
Scott: I spread the love even though most of the love goes to Samus and dr.

718
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:11,670
Scott: Mario.

719
00:45:12,011 --> 00:45:18,370
Rym: Pretty much it's like I'll go Falco Falco Falco kind of like how in Soul Calibur - I'll go Volto Volto Volto and Soul Calibur.

720
00:45:18,611 --> 00:45:24,888
Scott: I am Siegfried slash nightmare 100% of the time see but then I get bored with that or if I'm winning I never get bored with that.

721
00:45:25,613 --> 00:45:29,410
Rym: So I always switch it up for a while and then I swear I always switch back to Falco.

722
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,742
Rym: It's like Falco Falco Falco princess peach Pikachu Falco.

723
00:45:33,143 --> 00:45:33,283
Scott: Mmm.

724
00:45:33,665 --> 00:45:39,334
Rym: Sometimes I got a picture that Pikachu Everyone is because she's a very bitchy character Yeah, and the new one.

725
00:45:39,414 --> 00:45:41,760
Scott: what characters you're looking forward to playing as well?

726
00:45:42,482 --> 00:45:46,539
Scott: I'm gonna play as all of them King today day King today day today.

727
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:47,244
Scott: They're pretty hot.

728
00:45:47,305 --> 00:45:49,775
Scott: Yeah You know Samus, dr.

729
00:45:49,815 --> 00:45:57,425
Rym: Mario assuming it's a decent conversion what tabletop RPG board game card game miniatures game Would you like to see as a video or computer game?

730
00:45:57,445 --> 00:45:58,109
Rym: This is all of them.

731
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:03,430
Scott: Yeah, any any board game or any board game not RPG or tabletop game?

732
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:11,789
Scott: But a board game card game or miniatures game can be a computer game and that will always make it better because well It won't always make it a hundred percent better

733
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:12,352
Rym: But it will

734
00:46:12,452 --> 00:46:19,702
Scott: always allow you to play that game without dealing with the setup or dealing with the rules Administration and it'll help you learn the game at the very least.

735
00:46:20,063 --> 00:46:29,450
Scott: So as far as I'm concerned every Bored miniatures and card game should also be have a video game form because that can only be good.

736
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:32,590
Rym: It cannot be bad now in terms of role-playing games.

737
00:46:33,232 --> 00:46:36,384
Rym: I've thought about this a lot and now I suddenly realize we should.

738
00:46:36,484 --> 00:46:44,191
Rym: this would be a decent programming project We should try to work on because this would be so great especially at least for those of us who will have laptops playing burning Wheel.

739
00:46:44,372 --> 00:46:48,812
Rym: Yep, but a companion system to a tabletop rope I mean one.

740
00:46:48,832 --> 00:46:54,842
Scott: a companion system is one thing but like they're trying at D&D now with their fourth edition is trying to basically make It so you can play D&D online.

741
00:46:55,631 --> 00:47:04,041
Rym: I can see a way to play burning wheel online if everyone had video chat because my office has this thing where like all the Offices have constant like video chat and audio chat.

742
00:47:04,162 --> 00:47:16,119
Rym: Yep, and that sort of thing coupled with a network companion system companion cube that could Deal with all the die rolls centrally and just you know Keep track of all your crap for you.

743
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:17,990
Rym: and like you're doing a dual wits.

744
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:27,090
Rym: it does all the picking you can do all the picking and it it like iterates through all the things and does all the Rolling for you and maybe like the DM could approve and disprove afford.

745
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,661
Scott: Yeah, you just choose your you know, you just choose your action.

746
00:47:29,702 --> 00:47:31,470
Scott: then it goes poop and it says what happens.

747
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:33,235
Rym: You know anything like that.

748
00:47:33,315 --> 00:47:40,053
Rym: to let people who live far apart play a game like burning wheel online be awesome Super awesome.

749
00:47:40,715 --> 00:47:51,050
Rym: and now I feel like you me and Alex should make a companion system for burning wheel not for the whole system But just to track a character as and I'm sitting there with my laptop with my character sheet in the game.

750
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:54,844
Scott: I definitely like having compute, you know laptops as a companion system.

751
00:47:54,885 --> 00:48:01,068
Scott: You're still playing a tabletop game Maybe even still rolling real dice, but being able to not have a piece of paper, but use your laptop.

752
00:48:01,108 --> 00:48:01,650
Scott: That's good stuff.

753
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:10,710
Rym: No, just in burning wheel very specifically every time I test a skill I just tell it how many dice I rolled and it takes care of all the tracking every other tracking of the advancement.

754
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,054
Scott: Yeah, yeah, that's good stuff too.

755
00:48:12,075 --> 00:48:14,182
Rym: We could make that pretty handily.

756
00:48:14,202 --> 00:48:15,345
Rym: Yeah, we probably should.

757
00:48:15,366 --> 00:48:15,988
Scott: that's good stuff.

758
00:48:16,068 --> 00:48:16,529
Rym: Let's do it.

759
00:48:16,771 --> 00:48:17,921
Rym: Yeah, maybe you want to.

760
00:48:17,941 --> 00:48:19,933
Scott: I don't know Stuff to do.

761
00:48:19,973 --> 00:48:26,069
Scott: first assuming the same what video or computer game would you like to see a material equivalent to?

762
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,723
Rym: They've already made a railroad tycoon as a board game, which is fine.

763
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:30,366
Rym: I'd like that.

764
00:48:30,447 --> 00:48:35,783
Rym: Yep Obviously, I want to see portal the board game.

765
00:48:36,486 --> 00:48:43,821
Scott: Yeah, you know While it goes really well from board game to video game It doesn't really go so well in the other direction so much.

766
00:48:44,363 --> 00:48:46,050
Scott: I mean like Half-Life 2 the board game.

767
00:48:46,452 --> 00:48:47,520
Scott: They may doom the board game.

768
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,023
Scott: kind of crap.

769
00:48:48,064 --> 00:48:49,091
Scott: world will craft the board Do.

770
00:48:49,111 --> 00:48:56,910
Rym: the board game is just one of those hero quest type game Yeah, which are fun until like we played hero quest again not too long ago with Alex.

771
00:48:57,031 --> 00:49:03,769
Scott: I think what it is is when you take a board game and turn it into a computer game You're basically it's the exact same game just in a different format, you know.

772
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:05,696
Scott: But saying converting a like.

773
00:49:05,716 --> 00:49:07,924
Scott: when they convert video games to be board games.

774
00:49:08,185 --> 00:49:10,736
Scott: It's actually a completely different game Just happens at the same name.

775
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:21,727
Rym: going back board game turned into a video game specifically Twilight struggle, especially if you change the rules to take advantage like if it were a well-done Computer game that were otherwise a lot like Twilight struggle.

776
00:49:21,747 --> 00:49:22,330
Rym: They'd be awesome.

777
00:49:22,531 --> 00:49:23,374
Scott: yeah be good cuz.

778
00:49:23,414 --> 00:49:30,430
Rym: Twilight struggle suffers primarily from the fact that it's uh, a Board game and I have to twiddle all the time are also probably.

779
00:49:33,152 --> 00:49:37,569
Scott: But yeah video games into board games isn't the greatest because it's really a different game entirely.

780
00:49:37,669 --> 00:49:43,330
Scott: doom The board game is not the same as doing the video game, but you could take say settlers of Catan you put it on the computer.

781
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:44,273
Scott: It's unchanged.

782
00:49:44,854 --> 00:49:46,619
Rym: So obviously you got to adapt it.

783
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:47,541
Rym: make it first-person.

784
00:49:47,822 --> 00:49:50,269
Scott: Yep, but I mean yet video game to board game.

785
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:50,589
Scott: Not good.

786
00:49:51,513 --> 00:49:56,390
Rym: What is your opinion of the new art style story direction of Advance Wars DS 2?

787
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,498
Rym: Do you like the fact that they dropped all the CEOs for new ones?

788
00:49:58,518 --> 00:49:59,562
Scott: I don't really care.

789
00:49:59,603 --> 00:50:03,417
Rym: Yes one reason alone I've transcended Advance Wars.

790
00:50:03,638 --> 00:50:04,321
Rym: I'm done with it.

791
00:50:04,682 --> 00:50:05,726
Rym: The game is solved.

792
00:50:05,846 --> 00:50:06,710
Rym: It's not that hard.

793
00:50:07,191 --> 00:50:12,470
Rym: I beat Advance Wars 1 & 2 with all S's on normal and advanced campaign.

794
00:50:12,811 --> 00:50:32,124
Rym: I beat everything in the DS except all the war rooms that were already in Advance Wars 2 because I didn't want to do them Again, I went every time the game and all the new CEOs didn't really add anything to the game in terms of strategy Because they were all effectively either Brokenly powerful or worse than just great or Hawk.

795
00:50:32,526 --> 00:50:32,746
Scott: Yep.

796
00:50:33,468 --> 00:50:34,992
Rym: It was just They.

797
00:50:35,474 --> 00:50:43,450
Rym: they couldn't extend the game other than making more maps Unless they completely redid the game because the CEOs were no longer a paper-rock-scissors.

798
00:50:44,052 --> 00:50:52,606
Scott: You know all we know about the game so far is from the screenshots that I've seen but it mostly seems like a sort of Graphical style revamp more than a gameplay revamp.

799
00:50:52,687 --> 00:50:53,330
Rym: if they hadn't gotten.

800
00:50:54,513 --> 00:50:56,582
Scott: But there's a few more like motorcycles and stuff.

801
00:50:56,602 --> 00:51:06,430
Rym: if they hadn't gotten rid of the old CEOs They would have had to leave grid in and unless they gimped him or something Which would have made all the fans of Advance Wars except me bitch and moan.

802
00:51:07,073 --> 00:51:10,070
Rym: Then the game would have still been kind of a little tiny bit broken.

803
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:10,492
Scott: Yeah, it'll.

804
00:51:10,552 --> 00:51:14,870
Scott: it'll depend on what the the powers of all these new CEOs are which are yet to be revealed.

805
00:51:17,372 --> 00:51:24,318
Rym: What would you have to say is your personal weirdest video game moment, I have an easy answer to that one All right, you don't have anything.

806
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:33,607
Scott: not really weird moments Playing counter-strike and like weird graphical glitches or somewhat and doing I don't know.

807
00:51:33,687 --> 00:51:37,944
Rym: there was one time I was playing Castlevania 2 a game that unnerved me as a kid.

808
00:51:38,144 --> 00:51:39,490
Scott: Anyway, I have a moment.

809
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,096
Scott: Okay, so you can go.

810
00:51:41,276 --> 00:51:45,270
Rym: All right, so I'm playing Castlevania 2 and I was always fascinated.

811
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:56,744
Rym: I was trying to get to areas that Seem mysterious that I couldn't get to and I was just I would go around that game throwing holy water everywhere and looking and one time the game kind of glitch and I ended up.

812
00:51:57,045 --> 00:52:28,285
Rym: it was in like the third or fourth mansion and There's like water in the ceiling like you can see water above the highest place you could get to and I ended up glitching and stuff and I end up getting up there and Then there was a glitchy area above that and it was full of nothing But those hanging dead skeleton bodies and they were all moving up and down Uh-huh, and as a kid I was up there walking around and it was just really weird and it really creeped me out and I couldn't get out and I Eventually turned the game off kind of a nerves.

813
00:52:28,305 --> 00:52:36,530
Scott: Mm-hmm One time I was playing Megaman 2 and I remember I was a little kid I think a babysitter was over or something and I was fighting bubble man fight bubble man.

814
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:40,330
Scott: And then I jump up and the door, you know the little doors that go into bubble man.

815
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:49,477
Scott: So, you know like the Megaman boss doors it opened and I exited bubble man's room But the bubble man music was still playing and I was like what the fuck What the fuck.

816
00:52:49,819 --> 00:52:51,110
Scott: that door is not supposed to go that way.

817
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:52,406
Scott: It's a one-way door Yeah.

818
00:52:53,072 --> 00:53:04,883
Scott: And then I go back it opens again and it lets me back into bubble man's room and I guess I'm still fighting him Kinda, but it's super glitched out and there's like platforms I can't see and everything's fucked up and I don't know what the hell was going on.

819
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:12,839
Scott: and then I just sort of did everything I could do in that room with my little NES controller just playing around Figuring out what the hell this glitch was going.

820
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,929
Scott: Whoa until I had to go to bed.

821
00:53:15,739 --> 00:53:16,470
Rym: There was one time too.

822
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,761
Rym: I was playing Metal Gear and I went.

823
00:53:18,781 --> 00:53:26,174
Rym: I was going into the room with the supercomputer but I ran back like I ran back out the door by accident and I went back in and The game glitched.

824
00:53:26,315 --> 00:53:29,485
Rym: and I just skipped the supercomputer and I was in the room with big boss.

825
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:36,119
Rym: Oh, yeah spoilers, but Spoilers for Metal Gear Metal Gear for the NES.

826
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:37,363
Rym: Yeah, you know what big boss.

827
00:53:37,644 --> 00:53:39,470
Rym: He's trying to murder you the whole time.

828
00:53:39,892 --> 00:53:42,827
Rym: He's actually the bad guy and you can only kill him with rockets.

829
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:46,730
Scott: All right What is more annoying an impossibly hard game or a stupidly easy one?

830
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:50,183
Scott: Neither of them are annoying cuz I just stopped playing either one.

831
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:58,350
Rym: I don't know a stupidly hard game Or an impossibly hard game I would beat my head against to try to become good as a kid.

832
00:53:58,512 --> 00:53:59,506
Rym: It depends on how.

833
00:53:59,607 --> 00:53:59,810
Scott: okay.

834
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:00,653
Scott: Here's the thing right.

835
00:54:01,055 --> 00:54:09,285
Scott: if it's stupidly hard in a way that I is just you know If it's stupidly hard, right then I wouldn't even try.

836
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:09,807
Scott: I'd be like fuck.

837
00:54:09,827 --> 00:54:10,870
Scott: this is just stupid, right?

838
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:14,355
Scott: like but if it was actually a Challenge like a challenge that was.

839
00:54:14,596 --> 00:54:18,148
Scott: that meant that my skill or my figuring out skills were low.

840
00:54:18,168 --> 00:54:27,770
Scott: as you know If I actually felt that I was inadequate and I was not Succeeding where others have succeeded and it was my fault that I was not succeeding then I would keep beating my head against it.

841
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:39,640
Scott: You know, but if it's just stupidly easy, I just like yawn and I stopped playing, you know I guess if it has to be so impossibly hard Well, if it's impossible, then I just wouldn't play it either.

842
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,210
Rym: the difficulty of this game is legendary.

843
00:54:42,522 --> 00:54:43,533
Scott: Yeah It has to be.

844
00:54:43,573 --> 00:54:50,096
Scott: the only time that a game can be annoying to me is if it's not Impossibly or stupidly hard.

845
00:54:50,176 --> 00:54:58,928
Scott: is just heart is just above what I can do and I have to build up to it and all those Hundreds of times I fail until my skill grows will be frustrating.

846
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:01,395
Rym: maybe Alright, we're at it.

847
00:55:01,576 --> 00:55:02,139
Rym: This is the end.

848
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:03,585
Rym: This is the last question.

849
00:55:03,605 --> 00:55:08,262
Rym: Oh, no Do you think big FPO is a dumb question?

850
00:55:08,342 --> 00:55:10,090
Rym: Oh, well, we can do a little bit of history here.

851
00:55:10,631 --> 00:55:16,190
Rym: Do you think big FPS games can still be distributed using the share where model that made doom so popular?

852
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,212
Scott: Uh-huh share where is dead?

853
00:55:17,373 --> 00:55:19,660
Rym: Well share where is stupid share?

854
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,463
Rym: where is dead share?

855
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,770
Rym: where has been dead for over a decade?

856
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:27,946
Rym: Some people still make it but it's stupid share where is not a viable business model.

857
00:55:28,027 --> 00:55:29,030
Rym: No one cares about it.

858
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,510
Rym: It's a crap idea at best.

859
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:37,854
Rym: There are demos now and you know what the demo for bio shock did really well and a lot of people probably bought bio shock Because of that demo.

860
00:55:38,014 --> 00:55:39,721
Rym: yeah a demo is not shareware.

861
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:42,504
Scott: back in the day the shareware was basically All right.

862
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:50,259
Scott: We'll give you the game most of it share where an annoying message on it And if you pay us money, we'll give you the rest of the game.

863
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:56,401
Rym: share where only existed because there wasn't an easy ubiquitous way to distribute software.

864
00:55:56,441 --> 00:55:58,087
Rym: there was no internet like there is now.

865
00:55:58,107 --> 00:56:04,197
Rym: so People would sell discs of shareware and then if you liked it You could mail for the full game and things.

866
00:56:04,298 --> 00:56:17,009
Rym: and I paid $5 for a share where of doom won Mm-hmm, and then I pirated the wads to get real doom from a BBS that I dialed into pretty much share What was something that existed before the days of the CD ROM you see?

867
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:28,092
Scott: Because you would get share where on floppy disk for free and then if you liked it You would send away to get the rest of the game on a bunch of floppy disks or you would dial into a BBS and pirated Or that.

868
00:56:28,192 --> 00:56:37,350
Scott: but when once the CD ROM came around, you know people could just buy CD ROM with the whole game on it at CompUSA and that was pretty much like all right.

869
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:41,390
Scott: You know share where I started to go downhill and then the internet just put the final nail on the coffin.

870
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:42,594
Scott: Everyone could download everything.

871
00:56:43,056 --> 00:56:47,370
Scott: also, you know, it's either freeware or open source or proprietary.

872
00:56:47,591 --> 00:56:49,015
Scott: Those are pretty much the three ways.

873
00:56:49,196 --> 00:56:52,466
Scott: also any no matter whether which one of the three it is.

874
00:56:52,526 --> 00:56:54,051
Scott: a demo is probably a good Idea.

875
00:56:54,272 --> 00:56:59,230
Rym: also while share where was just the method used when doom came out?

876
00:56:59,851 --> 00:57:06,490
Rym: I don't think share where had anything to do with doom being successful was successful because it was the first real FPS.

877
00:57:07,431 --> 00:57:08,617
Scott: Yeah, pretty much straight up.

878
00:57:08,898 --> 00:57:11,435
Rym: It was also Pretty 3d.

879
00:57:11,776 --> 00:57:14,048
Rym: I mean it was actually kind of 3d.

880
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:15,574
Rym: It was a 3d game.

881
00:57:15,675 --> 00:57:19,250
Scott: Wolfenstein 3d was kind of 3d but less much less.

882
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:22,146
Scott: It's woven snake one was the one that was really 3d.

883
00:57:22,186 --> 00:57:22,428
Scott: first.

884
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:23,433
Rym: The thing is quick.

885
00:57:23,513 --> 00:57:26,850
Scott: one was the worst game than but even quake one didn't let you aim up and down.

886
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:30,647
Scott: So really it was quake - that was the first real 3d all the way.

887
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:39,876
Rym: Well, what I would say is that doom - well doom itself was the first real FPS quake - was the first Modern FPS.

888
00:57:39,976 --> 00:57:41,241
Scott: Yeah, that's that's about right.

889
00:57:41,884 --> 00:57:44,694
