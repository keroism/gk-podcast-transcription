1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,286
Rym: It's Monday October 8th.

2
00:00:11,647 --> 00:00:12,148
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:16,920
Rym: I'm sick, and this is GeekNights tonight since Scott is indeed sick.

4
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,818
Rym: We talked about something a little boring printers.

5
00:00:24,342 --> 00:00:33,763
Scott: Let's do this so I'm not Above the weather.

6
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,487
Rym: Oh, what was that?

7
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:36,690
Rym: What's going on Scott?

8
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,305
Scott: Um This show's not gonna be easy to do.

9
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:44,133
Scott: I don't think Now.

10
00:00:44,173 --> 00:00:45,015
Rym: now why is that?

11
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:47,001
Rym: I mean to some.

12
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:52,005
Rym: someone like you who you know very very loudly proclaims They never get sick, and he never.

13
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:55,053
Scott: They never.

14
00:00:55,093 --> 00:01:03,635
Scott: but you know sometimes less often than other people like or Scott didn't go to work today, and he's feeling really sick uh-huh.

15
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:08,218
Scott: and Yeah Maybe I should just say less.

16
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,210
Scott: so the show doesn't waste a lot of time.

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,649
Rym: And but I suggested we just skip a show, but you wanted to do this.

18
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:21,929
Scott: I gotta prove that I'm better than all those other Podcasters who who just skip shows at the drop of the Hat they come out with like one show a month.

19
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:26,705
Rym: One show a month if we're lucky yeah, so like we're better than all you.

20
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:27,890
Scott: we're doing shows and we're sick.

21
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:29,268
Scott: We don't let shit get in our way.

22
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:30,339
Scott: We're better than you.

23
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,248
Scott: you suck.

24
00:01:32,654 --> 00:01:37,886
Scott: If you ever try to say that you're better than us in any way I'll say I did a show when I'm sick, and if you?

25
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:42,509
Rym: well I think you would have said you did a show when you were sick or I say not.

26
00:01:43,552 --> 00:01:44,557
Scott: So you gotta do.

27
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:46,406
Scott: you got to do a show and I've got.

28
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:48,398
Scott: I don't know what I've got But there's not.

29
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:49,424
Rym: I know what Scott's got.

30
00:01:49,545 --> 00:01:56,229
Scott: he has a cold But when there's you got to be in worse condition than me and do a show before you can say anything about me.

31
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:58,000
Rym: Well anything about you.

32
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:05,989
Rym: in regards to podcasting Also, it's not like this gets you a free pass out of anything also in completely unrelated news.

33
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:12,950
Scott: We used to do these like Harris polls, and it's basically you sign up, and they send you links in the email.

34
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:22,360
Rym: Yeah You know the only reason I stopped doing that Was because I got a bunch of Harris points, and I asked for a knife set And it was like a $80 knife set and it never came.

35
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:28,750
Scott: See you I see I did it and I asked for a simpson season 1 on DVD.

36
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:34,520
Scott: After I got enough points for doing enough surveys And they gave me simpson season 1 on DVD, and I still have it.

37
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,355
Scott: so I kept doing it and then I decided today They've been emailed.

38
00:02:38,436 --> 00:02:42,725
Scott: they email me like about once a week You know and I decided I didn't want to do these polls anymore.

39
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,374
Scott: I got tired of them I didn't care anymore.

40
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:47,989
Rym: the reason I always did him not so of one because I always wanted to win that 10 grand.

41
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:49,817
Scott: Yeah, every time you do a survey.

42
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:56,696
Rym: There's a chance to win $10,000, but more importantly I did them just because I I Noticed and Scott.

43
00:02:56,756 --> 00:02:59,850
Rym: I think would agree that I was often the outlier

44
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,091
Scott: Because

45
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:09,996
Rym: I always showed you some of the like pending results as you were going and you could always see like wow That's that little lump that lump is me But it's really the results

46
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:11,930
Scott: of the end because they don't want to influence your choices

47
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:20,281
Rym: Yeah, but you can always see like huh like most people watch you know 20 hours of TV a week There's Rym the only person who said zero

48
00:03:20,623 --> 00:03:26,630
Scott: yep, but you know I also Partially did them because I felt like I was having a say because someone you know no one.

49
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:30,051
Scott: They don't make a poll unless some company is doing market research You know.

50
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:42,838
Scott: so if I'm answering some come that is gonna factor into the the numbers that some company is paying for and they're gonna Change their decisions slightly based on what I have as a result to try to I guess throw my way What little weight I had around more.

51
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,810
Rym: I always gave very extreme answers.

52
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:51,291
Rym: I don't like voting but in companies It's like if I didn't like something a little I'd give it a zero and if I liked it at all I give it a 10.

53
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:58,699
Scott: Yep, so I used to do these things for a long time And you know I only ever the only you get even every time you do when you get points And you also get the chance to win $10,000.

54
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:09,865
Scott: I never won because if I did I'd pay off my car loan, but You know I got these points and at first I spent the points on the Simpsons season 1 DVD But then I never spent the points again.

55
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:14,885
Scott: so today I go and I have enough points to buy the biggest prizes they offer right.

56
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:20,048
Scott: so I'm looking through and I'm like what the hell Should I get with these stupid points, and it's like a fancy watch.

57
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:25,741
Rym: Luggage Electric grill luggage is kind of expensive.

58
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:26,705
Rym: I should have gotten that.

59
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:29,823
Scott: I don't need luggage though And it takes up space which I also don't have.

60
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:32,418
Scott: get rid of your own luggage But I have perfect luggage.

61
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,550
Scott: it takes up a lot less space because it's a duffel bag.

62
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:42,282
Rym: I'll let on eBay, and that's all my duffel bag sell the old the new luggage on eBay, but hey no Why not get some cash instead of whatever you're gonna get?

63
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:47,803
Scott: no so so to my amazement There was also like some iPod dock boom boxes things which I thought about getting.

64
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:52,259
Scott: there was a 2.1 stereo system I thought about getting because that's what I've been kind of looking for.

65
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,054
Scott: you should have gotten that but it was actually a DVD player That came with 2.1.

66
00:04:56,054 --> 00:05:01,477
Scott: Speakers, so I'm not sure how it hooked up, so it might have been useless, but regardless I ended up getting something.

67
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:09,308
Scott: I need a lot which is the Sennheiser Wireless RF headphones, so we'll wait to see if they show up.

68
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:17,270
Rym: You realize the problem with the headphones is not the wire here But it's the splitter and the fact that we're using one headphone hole for two people.

69
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:20,750
Scott: I know, but I still think it'll be vastly superior to my current situation.

70
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:25,147
Scott: And how does it plug in with a either the big or the small headphone hole?

71
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:25,750
Rym: it has both.

72
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:42,529
Scott: Yeah It said it actually said to my amazement the little information they provided me about this product was that it had it 1/8 inch stereo mini jack with a quarter inch converter And I'm like huh look at that, so I clicked get because that was the best thing I could have gotten for all that time I spent

73
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:43,681
Rym: Right.

74
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:51,665
Rym: so in the news I got to talk about this because it's you know it's the news and everyone's buzzing about it And it's all the big deal, and I have a few things to say.

75
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:52,188
Rym: and that's it.

76
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,770
Rym: The RIAA won its first jury trial.

77
00:05:56,662 --> 00:06:01,886
Rym: Oh no Now that would have been you know bad news like what everyone always said.

78
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:05,095
Rym: if there was a jury trial They'd lose because everyone hates the RIAA.

79
00:06:05,176 --> 00:06:10,430
Rym: and while that's true the the facts of this case make it a little bit interesting for one.

80
00:06:11,077 --> 00:06:15,330
Rym: From what I can read Almost everyone on the jury didn't even own a computer.

81
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,091
Rym: Yeah, like they didn't know anything about technology at all They.

82
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:21,903
Scott: it's the same problem with judges don't know juries don't know.

83
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:28,729
Scott: this is why we need a situation in which There are expert witnesses intelligent judges and juries that either know about computers or no juries.

84
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:37,482
Rym: instead They had expert witnesses who just said whatever they wanted him to say And - I gotta be the expert witness me call me the lawyers call me.

85
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:45,350
Rym: the instructions the judge gave to the jury very much Interpreted the law in a very specific way that may or may not be the end interpretation of this law.

86
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:48,846
Scott: Yeah, I hear they're appealing which is I guess of course.

87
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,710
Rym: They're gonna appeal.

88
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:52,291
Scott: You kind of have to these days You know.

89
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:57,289
Rym: but also there's a bunch of little things that can be learned for all of you budding pirates out there.

90
00:06:58,132 --> 00:07:16,130
Rym: One the only reason this lawsuit actually worked was because this person Had a name online a handle if you were like many people do and this person was well associated with that handle and this person pirated the music of their choice from Kazaa with the same username.

91
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:18,938
Rym: Real smart good game.

92
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:28,470
Rym: rule number one if you're gonna pirate something use bit torrent and Don't have a username on some stupid cuz I kind of site because those sites are all worthless.

93
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:39,244
Scott: Yeah, and also it was sort of obvious that this person actually was pirating lots of music Intentionally and knowingly and all that like the the facts of the case.

94
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:40,789
Scott: It's like wow the person totally did it.

95
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:51,067
Rym: Even worse it looks like one of the defenses was that oh well I had a computer party and anyone could have downloaded those songs And the guy's a week as defense.

96
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:52,634
Rym: well That's not that bad of a defense.

97
00:07:52,695 --> 00:08:03,209
Rym: the problem is they showed records that the same device had been connected continuously to as far as the cable company could see for all that time and That device was not a router.

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,990
Rym: No And there was all this actual evidence that she really didn't have any defense there.

99
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,753
Rym: He or whoever was.

100
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,319
Rym: I don't even know who were the trial was for I?

101
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:19,310
Rym: Mean all I have to say is that if anything like that happened to us we have an insecure wireless access point.

102
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:22,863
Scott: Well, it's not as it's not so insecure, but it's using WEP.

103
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:24,730
Rym: It's a hundred percent insecure.

104
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:27,983
Scott: Yeah, yeah to anyone intelligent, but normal people.

105
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:28,947
Scott: It's completely locked out.

106
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:29,730
Scott: They don't know what they'll do.

107
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:43,645
Rym: Yeah, but the problem is I almost worry that even if I didn't do something but if someone just used our access point and did something shady online if The jury is gonna be a bunch of people who don't even own computers, and I don't even understand what the internet is I?

108
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,257
Rym: Don't really have much confidence in me being found innocent of something I'm actually innocent of let alone getting off of something.

109
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:55,268
Scott: I might have done yep, so it really just kind of sucks.

110
00:08:55,328 --> 00:09:11,949
Scott: I mean Basically it imagine if we had to go and sit on a jury in the year 3,000 and it was a case of like you know the the some guy made He made some mischief with his teleporter, so like we don't even know how teleporters work.

111
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,464
Scott: So the facts of the case are completely lost on us.

112
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:15,309
Scott: We don't understand.

113
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:17,557
Scott: Are you really peers at that point?

114
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:18,179
Scott: you know does it?

115
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:19,001
Scott: is it really?

116
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:19,904
Scott: I mean we always.

117
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:25,490
Scott: it's sort of vague and and Subjective what jury of your peers really means and people always argue about it.

118
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:47,118
Scott: but I think clearly that when you are dealing with subject matter that you the person who is the defendant or perhaps the the plaintiff clearly understand that if the jury also does not understand it and if a Expert witness testimony is not enough to make them understand it Then they are clearly not your peers.

119
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,303
Scott: and that is.

120
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:51,154
Scott: that is one case where I'll say they're not your peers And you need to get a different.

121
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:56,815
Rym: well the best part is it looks like the RIAA even in all the you know cases They made against this person.

122
00:09:57,477 --> 00:10:05,468
Rym: one of them was that she is not some illiterate dumb computer user But actually was very tech savvy, and then she knew full well that she was doing or ha ha ha.

123
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:11,594
Scott: no Well, I guess on a scale maybe more tech savvy than the jury, but not as Evidence was.

124
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:21,259
Rym: this person had a Bachelor of Science in an unrelated field and because this person had graduated from college Obviously they are tech savvy and also.

125
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:24,930
Rym: I think this person had known to play online games once or twice in the past.

126
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:43,115
Scott: Wow, yeah, if that makes you tech savvy then Fucking Maven's here, I'm fucking like a genius if that for if that person savvy I don't know a word used for me triple plus savvy Maybe sal V Sal V like.

127
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:44,338
Scott: you know salve like.

128
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:46,704
Scott: you put salve on your instead of cream Scott.

129
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:52,763
Rym: you haven't even had any Sudafed lately, so I Don't think you know what you know.

130
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:55,960
Rym: salve savvy Whatever Scott.

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,729
Rym: What do you got in the news?

132
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,601
Scott: Okay, so you know the the Linux BIOS.

133
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:01,230
Scott: everyone talks about cuz right now your computer.

134
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:02,715
Rym: Not many people talk about that.

135
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:07,030
Rym: not many people know what that is okay, so your computer has this BIOS right the by.

136
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:08,469
Rym: It's probably Phoenix BIOS.

137
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:11,284
Scott: It's some sort of you know IBM PC BIOS.

138
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:15,990
Scott: if it's a PC Max the new max have like this open a firmware thing is completely different.

139
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:21,010
Scott: The most PC is pretty much every piece you're gonna buy us is BIOS, and we're not gonna talk about the BIOS.

140
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:26,751
Rym: It's a whole episode talking about by should do a show on that because it's kind of interesting and I think very briefly think It is.

141
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,319
Rym: your computer has changed a lot in.

142
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,042
Rym: you know the last.

143
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:36,489
Rym: I don't know 10 minutes, but especially the last decade The BIOS of computers has not changed very much.

144
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:43,049
Scott: Yes, the purpose of the BIOS back in the day was you turn basic input output system Not built-in operating system.

145
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:51,342
Scott: So it's basically your computer turns on and the first thing it does is it goes to the BIOS and says hey BIOS I got to start doing something here.

146
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:51,967
Scott: You know or else.

147
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:52,410
Scott: What's it gonna?

148
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,515
Scott: Do it's gonna do something first?

149
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:55,504
Rym: your computer has to know what I mean.

150
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:56,850
Rym: you think oh my computer just boots.

151
00:11:57,473 --> 00:11:58,559
Rym: How does it know how to boot?

152
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:00,269
Rym: How does it know to start booting?

153
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:03,250
Rym: What does it do first when you put electricity into it?

154
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,877
Rym: How does electricity turn into a booting?

155
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:06,383
Rym: and yes, so I was does all that?

156
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:07,850
Scott: the BIOS helps with a lot of that.

157
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,530
Scott: But back in the DOS days right DOS didn't know dick DOS is dumb as shit.

158
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:18,269
Scott: That's why when you install the game in DOS and need to tell every single game that you had a Sound Blaster 16 And what IRQ it was?

159
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:24,450
Scott: Yeah, so the BIOS is sort of was the helper in those days.

160
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:29,569
Scott: That's why you didn't need to like tell DOS your video card drivers because the BIOS would help you out, right?

161
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:41,365
Scott: Nowadays, we don't need the BIOS to figure out that shit because Linux and Windows and Mac all these you know modern operating systems We don't need to tell them what where our sound card is.

162
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:43,213
Scott: they're very intelligent And like.

163
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:47,330
Scott: right now if you boot, let's say you have a computer with Windows or Linux on it, right and a BIOS.

164
00:12:47,912 --> 00:13:07,730
Scott: Basically, you turn a computer on the BIOS counts your RAM and it checks what kind of CPU you have and it does all this Shit, and then your operating system starts to boot as soon as the BIOS is done and then your operating system Ignores everything the BIOS just did and does it all on its own a thousand times better than the BIOS did.

165
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:17,428
Scott: The only reason you need the BIOS is if you want to use a shitty operating system like DOS from the olden days Which I guess if you it's kind of good that it's there if you want to play old DOS games and install DOS that You would have this

166
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:18,972
Rym: DOS box

167
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:22,664
Scott: I know right but also free DOS which you would still need the BIOS free

168
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:23,707
Rym: DOS EMU.

169
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,359
Scott: Okay, okay But you know what?

170
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:27,455
Scott: I'm saying You want to get.

171
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:31,330
Scott: you say if you want to get the real experience over the real experience?

172
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,136
Rym: You mean the horrible experience?

173
00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:34,220
Scott: Yes, that's what I'm saying.

174
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:36,087
Scott: But it's the true experience.

175
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:42,367
Rym: games like Suddenly crashing into a sea of ASCII and then a DOS prompt and boot disks.

176
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,270
Scott: Don't forget boot disks.

177
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:46,906
Rym: So boot disk because I didn't have enough random exact I bet right.

178
00:13:47,187 --> 00:13:56,276
Scott: so hitting f5 manually loading mouse drivers because we don't use DOS anymore We really don't need the BIOS anymore We don't need to have.

179
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:58,990
Scott: the computer doesn't have to do that much when it turns on.

180
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:07,342
Scott: all it has to do is like get like say hey see that kernel over there low to go and The operating system takes care of the rest.

181
00:14:07,523 --> 00:14:10,750
Scott: and if you got rid of the BIOS People have gotten rid of the BIOS.

182
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,010
Scott: They have these machines running Linux BIOS, which basically turns the computer on those Linux.

183
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:19,683
Scott: They can boot the machine from like nothing to ready to go in like three seconds.

184
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:21,207
Scott: It's ludicrous, right?

185
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:24,479
Scott: So Take that a step further.

186
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:25,264
Scott: I didn't even think of.

187
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:26,050
Scott: this is genius.

188
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:34,470
Scott: There's a thing that someone's coming out with called splash top And what they did is even better than getting rid of the BIOS to put a Linux BIOS, right?

189
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:38,406
Scott: Basically this motherboard with no hard drive at whatsoever.

190
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,133
Scott: No hard drive No disk drives.

191
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:45,810
Scott: just the motherboard with a CPU and some RAM and a monitor plugged in right?

192
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,273
Scott: You turn this thing on.

193
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:50,384
Scott: they got flash on the draw on the motherboard boots fucking.

194
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:51,066
Scott: they got Linux.

195
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,073
Scott: in that flash It turns on.

196
00:14:53,294 --> 00:14:54,177
Scott: you got Firefox.

197
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:55,140
Scott: You got Skype.

198
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:56,003
Scott: You got Linux.

199
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:58,170
Scott: your mouse works it right in the BIOS.

200
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:00,218
Rym: You know, I've seen things like that before.

201
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:09,310
Rym: there was a. there was talk a long time ago But I don't know how far like this wasn't anything practical where people made a BIOS where you could check your email, right?

202
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,013
Scott: But that's not news.

203
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:15,097
Scott: That's not news because I am Scott and you know that if I see something like this I'm like that's bullshit.

204
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:15,941
Scott: You're never gonna see that.

205
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:16,865
Scott: in the end a product.

206
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:17,830
Scott: you could buy a new egg.

207
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,038
Rym: So do we see this as a product we can buy a new way?

208
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:27,966
Scott: if you want you can go and buy the aces p5 E3 deluxe and it's got this shit and I am so getting that.

209
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,529
Rym: Oh my god See this is the problem.

210
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:36,490
Rym: So getting that don't bother waiting for the next good thing to come out and buy your computer cuz you know what?

211
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,440
Rym: The next good thing is gonna come out every three months.

212
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:44,637
Scott: anyone who's thinking about buying a PC Aces p5 e3 deluxe motherboard.

213
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:45,761
Scott: There is no other.

214
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:53,003
Rym: if that is is the one I might have broken my Unbroken streak of only ever buying a bit mother below the streak.

215
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:53,946
Scott: It's so broken.

216
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,009
Scott: This is the motherboard.

217
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:55,370
Scott: people.

218
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,439
Rym: Hopefully Scott won't break any other streaks tonight.

219
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,766
Scott: aces p5 e3 deluxe.

220
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:02,290
Scott: buy this motherboard.

221
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:04,260
Scott: It is the shit you can.

222
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,044
Scott: you know that.

223
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:10,645
Scott: plus, you know That Linux is gonna work with all the stuff on the motherboard because Linux is on the motherboard.

224
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:12,010
Scott: You can't go wrong.

225
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,237
Scott: It's gonna work.

226
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,310
Scott: It comes with Firefox and Skype, right?

227
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:23,397
Scott: So like we always have computer problem, you know what if I think about that if you know We always have you know, if we didn't have two computers or more than one computer You have a computer problem.

228
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,141
Scott: computer doesn't work.

229
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:24,402
Scott: you go.

230
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:24,825
Scott: Ah shit.

231
00:16:25,106 --> 00:16:25,689
Scott: What do I do?

232
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:32,171
Scott: I can't even look up the answer to my problem this computer if everything fails as long as your CPU and your RAM are still Good.

233
00:16:32,552 --> 00:16:39,789
Scott: Boom you turn this on your network interface and your network interface and your network connection Right as long as the motherboard itself isn't broken.

234
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:48,330
Scott: You can turn this baby on get your Firefox and your Skype get some help and fix the thing without having to have two computers To play the slight devil's advocate.

235
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:54,690
Rym: I can do that now with a live CD because the odds of enough being broken to where a live CD won't work.

236
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,154
Rym: But yet the motherboard is fine.

237
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:57,197
Rym: That's not that great.

238
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:00,466
Scott: But what if your computer basically had a live CD built in?

239
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,690
Rym: that's nice.

240
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,026
Rym: That's update that Firefox in there.

241
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:04,609
Scott: It's quite hot.

242
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:11,250
Scott: The only - I can see to this is that the motherboard is kind of expensive, but it's so worth how expensive I think like $350.

243
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,217
Rym: Hey, I Paid a hundred bucks for my motherboard.

244
00:17:16,277 --> 00:17:19,126
Scott: I know so my mother board has ten serial ATAs.

245
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,569
Scott: It is an expensive motherboard.

246
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:26,496
Rym: So if you if you're the penny pincher, I gotta say it's not worth it yet $300 I think about it.

247
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:27,842
Rym: This is just her mother board.

248
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:29,630
Scott: This is just the first motherboard.

249
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,056
Scott: Oh, yes, but it has it.

250
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:31,538
Scott: It's real.

251
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:34,471
Rym: So I'm excited, but I'm not willing to pay 300.

252
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:42,630
Scott: The other thing is, you know I'm probably if I didn't just upgrade my video card and my RAM I probably would have gone out and bought this despite the price because I'm crazy like that.

253
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:54,114
Scott: but if Since I'm gonna be waiting anyway until you know I guess my computer is completely old and busted in like two or three more years, but I'm two or three more years I'm getting a motherboard.

254
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:54,857
Scott: that's got this shit.

255
00:17:55,278 --> 00:18:08,137
Scott: No doubt and it's pretty cool and anyone with you know, the money This is where it's at Things of the day.

256
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,030
Rym: So I don't think I've used this before.

257
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:11,753
Rym: Well, I've.

258
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:18,722
Rym: we might have seen something similar to it and I know a lot of people have made jokes like this before but this Is probably the best done version of this.

259
00:18:18,742 --> 00:18:22,806
Scott: I think I've seen something like this But same people doing something slightly different.

260
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:23,370
Scott: I don't remember.

261
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:29,630
Rym: I think it's just part of this trend that college humor is more and more becoming the center of all funny videos on the Internet.

262
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,870
Rym: That aren't just a baby ripping paper and falling over trying to drink from a hose.

263
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,390
Scott: It's sort of like the slash dot.

264
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:47,015
Scott: It's like if like dig in YouTube and then the other end you have slashed on college humor, you know It's sort of like college humor only picks the really good ones or they make them, you know, and it's always Everything they have there is.

265
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:56,469
Scott: it is either quality or at least you can see it be quality to someone whereas unlike dig videos It's like some stuff gets dug up and you're like what the fuck is this shit like that YouTube poop thing?

266
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,697
Rym: Yeah, anyway, this is just one of those.

267
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:15,120
Rym: what if people talked in the real world the way they talk on to Internet and It's a pretty accurate representation of the average kind of conversation that takes place Representation of the stereotypical internet conversation, you know what?

268
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,722
Rym: go to FARC.

269
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:17,989
Rym: that's pretty much what's going on.

270
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:21,450
Scott: Yeah Yeah, go like something awful for him plenty arcade for I don't know.

271
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,581
Rym: I think the highlights are when the captchas come into play.

272
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:33,269
Rym: Yeah, just when he's like read this and the guys like Yeah, that was good stuff the the cap check and just the one guy who's like that's gay Gay.

273
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,760
Rym: Yeah, people actually type that.

274
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:39,530
Rym: you'll see people type that whole thing.

275
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,170
Rym: I just said out they sure do and I like it was okay.

276
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,959
Rym: I didn't really laugh out loud, but I found it funny.

277
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:47,050
Rym: I laughed out loud at the end.

278
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:57,407
Scott: It's sort of like it's one of those things where it's not actually funny, but it's sort of it's like, you know It's like you just smile and nod and you know, and you know, this thing has to exist.

279
00:19:57,467 --> 00:20:04,770
Rym: It's like yep At the end when the guys are like first thing they're guys like ah fuck I just I cracked up I couldn't stop.

280
00:20:05,091 --> 00:20:05,814
Scott: Yeah, it's a good one.

281
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:08,666
Scott: All right, so, you know them model rockets.

282
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:09,710
Scott: you like model rockets.

283
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:13,082
Rym: Um, we haven't done a show on model rockets have we?

284
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:14,386
Scott: I've only made like five.

285
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:22,812
Rym: I was heavily into model rocketry as a child and also the laws in Michigan were much laxer than they were in, Connecticut Or New York.

286
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:23,495
Rym: I made some.

287
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,769
Scott: I made most of mine in Pennsylvania where the laws are much laxer.

288
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:31,100
Scott: So Um, yeah model rockets are cool, you know, it's even cooler.

289
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,486
Scott: model rockets that look like stuff like.

290
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:37,545
Rym: I had a model rocket That looked like an x-wing but it was little and I broke it.

291
00:20:37,565 --> 00:20:44,888
Scott: Yeah Well, this guy made one that is an x-wing big like real big like I guess as big as a real x-wing.

292
00:20:44,908 --> 00:20:47,759
Scott: It's real big It's it's it's really big.

293
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,427
Rym: It's not as big as a real x-wing.

294
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:58,440
Scott: No, but it You mean you mean I guess Wow This thing is a real x-wing.

295
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,548
Scott: but so how big?

296
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,355
Scott: There's no such thing as a real x-wing.

297
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:03,258
Scott: then how big is one?

298
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,710
Rym: You know how big one is long ago and far away.

299
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:07,718
Scott: No, but think about this.

300
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:09,130
Scott: right Star Wars universe.

301
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:12,230
Scott: Everything is a long time ago in a galaxy far far away, right for all we know.

302
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,013
Rym: They're all midgets.

303
00:21:13,214 --> 00:21:14,419
Scott: for all we know everything.

304
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:17,150
Scott: there is half size of what it is here or twice size.

305
00:21:17,191 --> 00:21:17,949
Scott: They're all Giants.

306
00:21:18,271 --> 00:21:18,652
Rym: You know why?

307
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:19,636
Rym: we know that's not true.

308
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:23,650
Rym: the same reason why Gulliver's giant couldn't be the surface area thing.

309
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:29,149
Rym: There are inherent qualities to size and very large things act differently from very small things.

310
00:21:30,712 --> 00:21:33,670
Rym: Yeah, that's why ants can lift a hundred times their weight.

311
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:47,579
Rym: But if an ant was the size of a human not only could it not lift as a hundred times its weight But it would be crushed by its own body in gravity Gravity the great Gravity because you pull based on not.

312
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,650
Rym: you pull based on mass, but you don't pull more if something's heavier.

313
00:21:52,171 --> 00:21:54,557
Scott: Yes, okay you pull he pulls.

314
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:55,519
Rym: he's about that.

315
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,905
Rym: I shouldn't say that because heaviness has nothing to do.

316
00:21:57,925 --> 00:22:01,682
Rym: yeah, you know what Great equalizer.

317
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:02,869
Scott: It doesn't discriminate.

318
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:06,475
Scott: Okay Right regardless.

319
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:12,919
Scott: some dude made a model rocket of an x-wing and well What do you think would happen if someone actually tried to launch that?

320
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:14,163
Rym: it would explode.

321
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:15,849
Scott: well here you go.

322
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:22,209
Scott: video For your eyes free viewing on internet all over the internet the guy who did the y-wing.

323
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:26,712
Scott: I think he did that in the past because you don't get to see there might be a video elsewhere on the internet of the Y-wing.

324
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:28,419
Rym: he's not gonna fly.

325
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:30,488
Scott: I think the y-wing is more successful actually.

326
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,023
Rym: well He probably just put two really big rockets in it.

327
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:34,070
Scott: I think that's what he did.

328
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,441
Scott: I'm not sure, but but yeah, so check this out.

329
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:41,668
Scott: if you like Star Wars or rockets or explosions right or fire.

330
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:44,941
Rym: But Scott's kind of sick as you we might have noted.

331
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,610
Rym: so we didn't want to do one of our like a shows.

332
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:54,330
Rym: We didn't want to talk about something that requires research or anything where we have a lot of loud and violent opinions like biases.

333
00:22:56,535 --> 00:23:04,111
Rym: We could have gone on a while But instead we're gonna do a real briefly because there's not a lot interesting to say about this topic and Scott was really excited about It.

334
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:08,610
Scott: so I think it's one of those things where it's a really boring topic at least to most people.

335
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,169
Scott: But I kind of know enough about it, and I think it's kind of interesting.

336
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:14,252
Rym: well It's also funny.

337
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,677
Rym: How quickly timing.

338
00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:17,241
Rym: I remember when I was in high school.

339
00:23:17,803 --> 00:23:24,003
Rym: if you bought a computer you bought a printer and Every computer had a printer attached to it like every single computer.

340
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:27,295
Scott: or yeah, or if you're at school There's a computer lab with a printer.

341
00:23:27,597 --> 00:23:34,324
Rym: Yeah, but like the printer was seen as this Absolutely essential thing and everyone just always had.

342
00:23:34,344 --> 00:23:46,724
Scott: well because back then before Internets was widespread the primary use of a computer besides playing games writing papers right typing something Oh and looking at the online encyclopedia and watching that same.

343
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:52,333
Scott: I'm talking about before those days You know I mean like you had a something with like a 486.

344
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:52,915
Scott: What could it do?

345
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:56,190
Scott: you could it was basically an infinitely better typewriter?

346
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,550
Scott: But the it was still a type.

347
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:02,750
Scott: You know you're still using it for the goal of getting your thing printed on paper or mostly handed into the teacher.

348
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:07,781
Rym: Honestly my primary goal using a computer back Then was to play scorched earth and stuff.

349
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,006
Scott: that was also my goal.

350
00:24:09,026 --> 00:24:09,990
Rym: cracked by kill fit.

351
00:24:10,091 --> 00:24:12,787
Scott: But printing was also necessary in fact essential.

352
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:17,109
Scott: Meanwhile nowadays not so much printing going on I mean a lot of work.

353
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,925
Rym: But that's just because paperless office is one of the biggest lies of this decade.

354
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:22,049
Scott: I don't know I barely print.

355
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:22,290
Scott: it work.

356
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,920
Scott: There's a lot of PDF mailing going on.

357
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,470
Rym: you work for a much cooler company.

358
00:24:25,652 --> 00:24:35,829
Scott: I have to print sometimes But it's usually what I want to have like I print out the seating chart of the office and like pin it up on my Desk wall thingy you know, but they mail it to me as a PDF.

359
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:36,291
Scott: They don't.

360
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:44,327
Rym: well my company never saw fit to give me a laptop or a PDA or anything even though that sort of thing would Probably save them hundreds of thousands of dollars in wasted time.

361
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:44,830
Scott: awesome.

362
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:48,868
Rym: So I have to print out like work orders and crap to carry around with you.

363
00:24:49,713 --> 00:24:50,880
Scott: Cuz you're shown to people.

364
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,845
Scott: yeah, I don't move around.

365
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:52,610
Scott: I sit at one desk.

366
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,762
Rym: Yeah, I move around which is good because when I'm bored.

367
00:24:54,822 --> 00:24:56,190
Rym: I could just get the hell out of my office.

368
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:59,468
Rym: Yeah, and I just make up excuse like yeah, I'm going to.

369
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:00,916
Scott: well I don't even need an excuse.

370
00:25:00,936 --> 00:25:02,867
Scott: if I want to leave the office and say I'm going to Best Buy.

371
00:25:02,907 --> 00:25:04,214
Scott: I'm going to Staples I'm going to.

372
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,626
Scott: you know I'm in the city at some time.

373
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:07,510
Scott: people need to go places.

374
00:25:07,812 --> 00:25:08,841
Scott: I'm going to get a haircut.

375
00:25:09,023 --> 00:25:09,850
Scott: I'm going to whatever.

376
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:14,010
Rym: I think the turning point for me was RIT because I went to RIT and I brought a printer.

377
00:25:14,773 --> 00:25:18,105
Scott: I also brought a printer an HP deskjet 820 CSE.

378
00:25:18,186 --> 00:25:18,687
Scott: I brought my 810 C.

379
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,764
Rym: Yeah, and we both had a printer.

380
00:25:21,844 --> 00:25:22,890
Rym: each one of us had a printer.

381
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:29,829
Scott: I bought that printer for 150 dollars when I was like 18 in high school and Didn't use our printers so much.

382
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:39,570
Rym: I printed out a color goat C and taped it to Scott's orange juice because he'd Never seen it before and he'd avoided it all that time.

383
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,774
Rym: I figured that was the only way to get him was to pull the the one-two punch And I kept.

384
00:25:43,894 --> 00:25:46,708
Scott: I just reminded me that my orange juice is they still don't make.

385
00:25:46,729 --> 00:25:48,877
Rym: oh That's a story.

386
00:25:48,897 --> 00:25:50,550
Scott: I think I said been said on the podcast.

387
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,379
Rym: Yeah, but other than that I never.

388
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:54,689
Rym: Wow goat C was one of the things I printed.

389
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,120
Scott: That's why I'm getting all sick.

390
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,790
Scott: It's because it's been enough time I don't have that orange juice that would cure all my disease news.

391
00:26:00,452 --> 00:26:07,370
Rym: But the thing I didn't use the printer anymore because all my professors wanted things turned in electronically except my one really dumb liberal arts.

392
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:09,641
Scott: Well, my computer teachers want to turn electronically.

393
00:26:09,721 --> 00:26:12,634
Scott: some liberal arts teachers wanted stuff printed out But I didn't have to do that.

394
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:22,330
Scott: many papers, you know that the dreaded mythical like super long paper I never had to do that ever the longest paper I ever had to write in my entire life was like 12 pages long.

395
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:25,140
Scott: I think the longest one I had to write was like 10 pages.

396
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,585
Scott: Maybe I don't know.

397
00:26:26,746 --> 00:26:27,850
Rym: granted I'd use APA.

398
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,379
Scott: It's really easy and I double spaced come on.

399
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:36,241
Rym: But yeah, even if I needed to print it was a college campus I always went to the computer lab and printed it over there.

400
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:44,483
Rym: Then I went over to the surly lab assistant It was always surly and said could I have my print out and he'd go And get up and give it to me.

401
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:51,450
Scott: and then yeah, but yeah I occasionally printed from my desk yet, but it would seem to be most of the time It just sat there printed from it sort of in bursts.

402
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:52,673
Scott: Yeah I didn't.

403
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:53,998
Scott: I could have lived without it.

404
00:26:54,259 --> 00:27:00,322
Rym: desk jets if you don't because they were designed for an era Especially because we had two old desk jets where they were used a lot.

405
00:27:00,804 --> 00:27:04,929
Rym: if you don't use a desk yet It stops working pretty quickly.

406
00:27:05,654 --> 00:27:08,330
Scott: Well, let's let's talk about different kinds of printers right originally?

407
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:13,438
Scott: Well, I guess originally there were all kinds of different kinds, you know There's kinds that like use the for plotting.

408
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:16,690
Scott: they like grab pens with robotic arms and drag them around the paper.

409
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:17,798
Scott: Those do exist.

410
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,250
Scott: They're good for like AutoCAD stuff.

411
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,022
Rym: We had a couple at RIT for the IT stuff that we use.

412
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:22,946
Rym: they were really awesome.

413
00:27:23,026 --> 00:27:23,850
Scott: They just call them plotters.

414
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,713
Scott: I think yes.

415
00:27:24,753 --> 00:27:26,038
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, there's.

416
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,884
Scott: there's all kinds but the main kinds.

417
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:37,230
Scott: originally there was the dot matrix printer Which was you know people out there the ones that go The ones with the paper that has the holes in the side and then you tear the holes off and you play with the hole.

418
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,429
Rym: Yeah, a lot of times the paper was like alternating green and white or green and yellow.

419
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:46,890
Scott: Paper would stick together sometimes and cause a big jam and the paper came in one continuous sheet.

420
00:27:47,171 --> 00:27:52,898
Scott: yeah, it'd just be one big sheet of paper either by special paper to go in the printer so that the roller could roll the paper out.

421
00:27:53,384 --> 00:27:57,887
Rym: and Basically, they were called dot matrix because they were just a matrix of dots.

422
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:10,790
Scott: Yep there was a there's a little ribbon of ink and there was a matrix of dots and it would move the ribbon of ink back and Forth and the dots would either hit or not hit and anything you print it out would basically either be it's like pixel or no.

423
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:16,121
Scott: That's why you know you've seen all those printouts like they used to have that banner printing program for the Apple.

424
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:21,060
Scott: to that every school would use too much and You would make every kind of banner the school needed.

425
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:33,348
Scott: they'd print out this big long banner from the Apple - and some people had the color dot matrix Apple - printer which the ribbon had like You know four different colors of ink on there and it would go through like four times.

426
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,654
Scott: and whoo It was all fancy.

427
00:28:34,955 --> 00:28:44,830
Rym: those printers are shitty and people say oh they still have their uses They don't have any use anymore forget it They all the uses they have exists solely because a lot of companies do things in really archaic ways.

428
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:45,655
Rym: But I digress.

429
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:52,763
Scott: yeah, there's like a lot of people have a very old point of sale system or something that only works with incredibly old equipment.

430
00:28:52,783 --> 00:29:00,386
Rym: they always claim but what if I need to fill out an Existing form with carbon paper on it to which I say you shouldn't be using carbon paper.

431
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:09,579
Scott: Yes, that is correct Okay, so the next kind of printer that anyone cared about was the desk jet bubble jet Whatever and this is probably what you're used to.

432
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:12,190
Scott: it's got a cartridge and it moves back and forth.

433
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,301
Rym: It just sprays ink on a piece of paper.

434
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:15,166
Scott: That's all it does.

435
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:15,810
Scott: It just goes.

436
00:29:16,492 --> 00:29:18,198
Scott: It just sprays ink on the paper.

437
00:29:18,378 --> 00:29:19,402
Scott: It's really not interesting.

438
00:29:19,442 --> 00:29:19,803
Scott: It's got.

439
00:29:20,245 --> 00:29:21,850
Scott: maybe you've got one with that's got color.

440
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,559
Scott: So it has cyan yellow magenta and black ink.

441
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,594
Scott: so we can make any color at once by spraying little dots You know.

442
00:29:28,654 --> 00:29:30,950
Scott: and it mixes different dots together to make different colors.

443
00:29:31,512 --> 00:29:38,349
Scott: You know, you get some cyan and some yellow together and make some I guess green bluish whatever, you know I don't know the colors on what do I know?

444
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,014
Rym: Yeah, they weren't the best printers.

445
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,539
Rym: now the cartridges were expensive.

446
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,188
Scott: people still use them because I guess they're.

447
00:29:44,228 --> 00:29:44,650
Scott: they're good.

448
00:29:44,892 --> 00:29:45,620
Scott: I guess for home.

449
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:49,015
Rym: use easy Nowadays because we don't print enough.

450
00:29:49,095 --> 00:29:52,366
Rym: I guess there's there's no good solution for printing in the home.

451
00:29:52,506 --> 00:29:53,590
Rym: Every solution sucks.

452
00:29:53,871 --> 00:29:57,850
Scott: Yeah, cuz I mean the desk jet is a good technology for printing in the home.

453
00:29:58,111 --> 00:30:05,558
Scott: The problem is if you don't print off and the cartridge can dry up and the cartridges are overpriced because they have a racket going On but the printers themselves.

454
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:06,944
Scott: the technology is incredibly cheap.

455
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:08,510
Scott: It's incredibly reliable.

456
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:09,941
Scott: You know, it's very.

457
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:14,080
Scott: it doesn't print very quickly But that doesn't matter because you know, you're printing not so often.

458
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:28,822
Scott: where you're printing like a birthday card or your photos You know, you don't really need like honestly The only thing I print at home anymore and it's always the same things as us hotel reservations Confirmations map quests convention reservation confirmation.

459
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:34,678
Scott: Yeah, and that's receipts the things I buy online and Playing games.

460
00:30:35,284 --> 00:30:41,170
Scott: Yeah Sometimes I actually print out rules to games like, you know board games like liars die.

461
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,578
Scott: I print out the an entire game.

462
00:30:42,678 --> 00:30:43,121
Scott: liars die.

463
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,287
Scott: They're like games you can print.

464
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:47,037
Scott: also Paper crafts print out paper.

465
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,365
Rym: when was the last time you did a paper craft?

466
00:30:49,646 --> 00:30:50,870
Scott: when I was at that job?

467
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:51,192
Scott: I quit.

468
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,470
Scott: I made that dragon where you turn it.

469
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,550
Rym: I also made that but I printed it out in color on a wax printer.

470
00:30:56,791 --> 00:31:00,387
Scott: I did I printed out in a laser color printer at work and I stuck it in my office.

471
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:06,585
Rym: and Every day people walk by and then they just go like woo And then I took it home because I got sick of that.

472
00:31:06,806 --> 00:31:12,952
Scott: Yeah Yeah, but yeah, so this is a laser printer and Lasers.

473
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:16,810
Scott: and see the thing about the laser printer is a laser printer is actually kind of expensive.

474
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:19,925
Scott: I mean, it's like what few thousand dollars for a color laser printer.

475
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,010
Scott: That's like high quality.

476
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,734
Scott: I guess there's some.

477
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,790
Rym: they're cheaper now see black and white laser printers are dirt cheap.

478
00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:27,910
Scott: Yeah, you can get one for like a hundred bucks and I recommend that but we'll get to it.

479
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,030
Scott: Yep, but you know the the way a laser printer works.

480
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,489
Scott: I'm actually pretty proud that I know this and I think it's really cool.

481
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:38,450
Scott: I'm not gonna go into stupid detail because someone who knows better than me and more details is gonna rat me out.

482
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:44,970
Scott: But the basic fundamental way a laser printer works is this you have this plastic area, right?

483
00:31:45,231 --> 00:31:46,314
Rym: And there's a guy standing there.

484
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:48,400
Rym: he says I'm charging my laser.

485
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:48,982
Scott: Yep.

486
00:31:49,102 --> 00:31:51,770
Scott: He says I'm a charge in my laser and you shoot this laser.

487
00:31:51,991 --> 00:31:52,434
Scott: It's actual.

488
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:53,621
Scott: there's a reason they call laser printer.

489
00:31:54,023 --> 00:32:04,312
Scott: This laser shoots this piece of plastic and wherever it's a special plastic and a special laser and wherever the laser shoots the plastic the plastic gets Charged.

490
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:12,310
Scott: and then there's the toner opens up and the toner gets stuck to the plastic Wherever the plastic got shot with the laser.

491
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:14,218
Scott: So you shoot the plastic with the laser.

492
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,950
Scott: the toner touches the plastic where it got shot But it doesn't touch the plastic where it didn't get shot.

493
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:25,430
Scott: And the result is what you want to print is now in toner on the plastic.

494
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:30,750
Scott: Then it heats up and it touches the paper to the plastic or rolls the paper across the plastic.

495
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:34,590
Scott: Usually it's a roll and it does it, you know one not, you know one part at a time.

496
00:32:34,891 --> 00:32:43,235
Scott: It doesn't do the whole sheet at once and it rolls the paper across the plastic while it's hot and the toner melts and sticks to the paper instead of the plastic.

497
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:44,659
Scott: and you got your print.

498
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,144
Rym: now two interesting things.

499
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:47,488
Rym: one the toner is.

500
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:54,750
Rym: It actually looks and acts like liquid but it's actually a very very very fine solid.

501
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:55,489
Scott: It's pretty scary.

502
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:15,102
Scott: If anyone ever if you ever find like a big big like color laser printer like a big copier fax scanner at an office They'll have separate toners cartridges for each individual you know for black, cyan, magenta, yellow and They're usually clear and you could take them out and you move them back and forth and it looks like yellow Liquid or inker is inside of it.

503
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:24,650
Scott: when you look closer It's just a million really really really tiny balls So tiny that it looks like liquid if you don't get your eye really close to it too.

504
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:29,949
Rym: If you ever spill toners somewhere somehow which it happens every now and then you should avoid it.

505
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:32,779
Rym: It's not like it'll kill you but it is kind of toxic.

506
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,903
Scott: it does it sucks.

507
00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:37,676
Scott: Basically, it's not like mercury or But it is sucks.

508
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,422
Rym: It's actually easy to clean up.

509
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:42,573
Rym: But here's a little hint for all of you out there Don't get it hot.

510
00:33:42,593 --> 00:33:47,990
Rym: Yeah, if you ever have to wash toner off set the washing machine on cold.

511
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,346
Rym: Otherwise, you're going to tone everything black.

512
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:56,841
Scott: Yep okay, so That's how laser printer works.

513
00:33:57,163 --> 00:34:01,529
Scott: and if it's a color laser printer it just does the same thing with all the other colors instead of just black.

514
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:05,581
Scott: and Laser printer, you know, it's sort of this weird thing.

515
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:14,510
Scott: where for a home user for a business Obviously because for in terms of no amount of money per page you print a laser printer is unbeatable.

516
00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:16,014
Scott: It's absolutely unbeatable.

517
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:32,330
Scott: It costs you like a few cents to print out one page a laser printer, but for a home user it's sort of rough because the And a cost of the printer plus the cost of a single toner cartridge is pretty high Compared to say a desk jet which you can buy a desk jet for like 20 bucks and a cartridge for like 30 bucks.

518
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:40,739
Scott: So buy another desk jet right but the laser printer over time Will save you money compared to the desk jet.

519
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,830
Rym: now a lot of people say but I want to prints in my color.

520
00:34:44,312 --> 00:34:48,010
Rym: And the answer is think about what you print and how often you really print.

521
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:58,556
Rym: The truth is most of the printing that the average person will do is gonna be in black and white with obvious exceptions for you Know artists or people with home Businesses who need to print in kind of

522
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:02,574
Scott: thing is there are a lot of people who do like like to print their photos in The digital can now.

523
00:35:02,654 --> 00:35:06,410
Rym: in that case your best bet is to have a photo printer.

524
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,414
Scott: That's what I was just gonna say.

525
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:10,207
Scott: They make photo printers that print out photos on photo paper.

526
00:35:10,307 --> 00:35:10,890
Scott: You can get one.

527
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,476
Scott: They're very cheap.

528
00:35:11,496 --> 00:35:12,770
Rym: They're really nice really cheap.

529
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:16,820
Rym: They'll do well, they're not super cheap But they'll do what you want if you're not better than any other.

530
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,245
Rym: you are doing that a lot.

531
00:35:18,305 --> 00:35:26,334
Scott: if you find yourself printing photos from your digital camera a lot and you want quality get a photo printer or Just do that thing.

532
00:35:26,354 --> 00:35:33,220
Scott: where you go and there's like those Kodak kiosks and you put your memory card in them and they print photos Out do that thing because that thing's not so bad and they're everywhere.

533
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,689
Scott: They're in grocery stores and targets and CVS.

534
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:37,222
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

535
00:35:37,364 --> 00:35:38,352
Rym: I'll be honest There's.

536
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:45,681
Rym: I feel like there's almost no use for the average person to have a desk jet anymore And I feel like it's mostly because the cartridges are ripoff.

537
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:49,335
Scott: now some people they say, ah, but I refill the cartridge I do this I do that.

538
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:52,090
Scott: Well, here's the thing free filling a cartridge.

539
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:55,150
Scott: I guess there are you know for the most part it works.

540
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:59,447
Scott: There are places you can go to have them do it for you to avoid the trouble, you know and such.

541
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:01,479
Scott: but They try to screw you.

542
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,010
Scott: they have like DRM and stuff.

543
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:14,670
Scott: It's sort of like those coffee pods where you can't make your own, you know And it's basically sure you can save a lot of money if you do that if you go through the hassle But it's not worth it and it just sucks.

544
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:27,593
Rym: Well, I think it's more that laser printers are generally just better in every way and it's kind of the high initial investment long-term returns as opposed to short and it's small initial investment Continual investment.

545
00:36:27,613 --> 00:36:28,215
Rym: Mm-hmm.

546
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:28,877
Scott: It's.

547
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:33,170
Scott: the only other thing you got to think about with your printer is how it connects to your computer.

548
00:36:34,331 --> 00:36:37,061
Rym: The answer nowadays is just USB.

549
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:37,964
Scott: I know back in the day.

550
00:36:37,984 --> 00:36:39,609
Scott: You said those big parallel cables.

551
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:42,790
Scott: now It's USB, but some people they like to share the printer.

552
00:36:43,112 --> 00:36:43,554
Scott: You know, they want.

553
00:36:43,575 --> 00:36:47,996
Scott: they want the every, you know, if you got a lot of computers in your house Why should you buy a printer for each computer?

554
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:49,861
Scott: You can buy one printer for the whole house.

555
00:36:50,202 --> 00:36:53,633
Rym: now obviously honestly for most people They use Windows.

556
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:54,877
Rym: It's super easy.

557
00:36:54,938 --> 00:36:58,713
Rym: You just click on the right click on the printer and say share and then everyone else can print To it.

558
00:36:58,814 --> 00:36:59,036
Rym: Yep.

559
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:00,310
Scott: There's two ways to do it.

560
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,554
Scott: One way is what Rym just said.

561
00:37:01,574 --> 00:37:04,925
Scott: you plug the printer into just one computer and that computer.

562
00:37:04,945 --> 00:37:08,277
Scott: you tell that computer to share the And every other computer.

563
00:37:08,337 --> 00:37:11,290
Scott: you say find the printer that's shared and use it and it works.

564
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:12,074
Scott: It's pretty simple.

565
00:37:12,235 --> 00:37:19,987
Rym: now another thing you can do and this is actually a good idea Especially for a family or if you don't want to bother you can buy a little box with a USB hole.

566
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:26,802
Rym: Oh You plug the printer into that and some of these boxes are wireless Like you just plug them into power then and that's it.

567
00:37:26,984 --> 00:37:27,628
Rym: and some of them.

568
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:33,830
Rym: You'd like to have an Ethernet hole, but they basically serve your printer out as though it were a network printer.

569
00:37:34,093 --> 00:37:35,270
Rym: Yep, so you just print to it.

570
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:39,043
Scott: it's basically a little tiny print server in a little tiny box and it's pretty cheap.

571
00:37:39,404 --> 00:37:48,390
Scott: and you connect your printer to it and now your printer is shared and Tada, you don't have to plug your printer into a computer to have it shared amongst all the computers in the network.

572
00:37:48,952 --> 00:37:52,544
Scott: The third thing you can do is get a printer that actually has a network card in it.

573
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:54,250
Rym: Those tend to be expensive.

574
00:37:54,471 --> 00:37:55,174
Scott: Yeah, they actually.

575
00:37:55,194 --> 00:37:57,102
Scott: they make printers now that have Wi-Fi in them.

576
00:37:57,524 --> 00:37:58,870
Rym: now that I think is a good idea.

577
00:37:59,031 --> 00:38:04,970
Scott: It is it's still kind of expensive compared to any other sort of printer But it could be really useful for you.

578
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,039
Scott: I mean you're gonna spend the money on the print server.

579
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,934
Scott: or if you're gonna spend the money and having a printer with a print Server in it.

580
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:12,250
Scott: Why not get the printer obviously server in it?

581
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:14,330
Rym: If you have money to burn get the print server.

582
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:18,789
Rym: But if you just need a printer and you need other people to print to it, just use the windows sharing.

583
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:19,373
Rym: it works Fine.

584
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:20,790
Rym: don't even bother with security.

585
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:27,093
Scott: It really comes down to how much you're willing to spend how much how smart you are and how good you are at setting this Sort of thing up.

586
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:32,890
Scott: what kind of network you have going on and the physical surroundings, you know Where are you going to put the printer?

587
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,595
Scott: You know what's near that?

588
00:38:34,655 --> 00:38:36,663
Scott: is it close enough to a network connection or is it?

589
00:38:36,804 --> 00:38:38,350
Scott: is it within Wi-Fi range is it?

590
00:38:38,671 --> 00:38:41,253
Scott: Don't put your printer on Carpet like.

591
00:38:41,293 --> 00:38:42,537
Rym: don't do like we do.

592
00:38:42,898 --> 00:38:46,007
Rym: don't put it on the floor like we do if you smoke.

593
00:38:46,047 --> 00:38:48,055
Rym: don't keep it anywhere near Where you smoke?

594
00:38:48,316 --> 00:38:50,850
Rym: Yeah, don't put your computers anywhere near where you smoke either.

595
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:56,663
Scott: No your computers and your printer will fill it with dust and it kind of ruins it over time No matter what kind of printer it is.

596
00:38:56,683 --> 00:39:01,210
Scott: It doesn't matter You don't want to put your printer anywhere near any sort of dusty crap.

597
00:39:01,652 --> 00:39:02,577
Scott: You want to keep it clean.

598
00:39:02,597 --> 00:39:05,090
Scott: you also printers use a lot of power.

599
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:09,764
Rym: I mean in my thinking of that no normal printers don't late like desk jets don't.

600
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:12,433
Scott: no not so much for these laser Printers.

601
00:39:12,955 --> 00:39:21,126
Rym: do not let them share circuits with any delicate electronics And I'll give you our house if I start printing the printers downstairs.

602
00:39:21,146 --> 00:39:24,340
Rym: if I print to that printer The lights in my room dim a little bit.

603
00:39:24,923 --> 00:39:26,510
Scott: Yeah, I used to have in my room.

604
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,490
Scott: I think there's like two or three circuits in my room, right?

605
00:39:29,012 --> 00:39:40,015
Scott: I would have had it arranged in a certain way where the printer was on the same thing as like the air conditioner and some Lamps and when I would print like it would the UPS is like Watch out.

606
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:40,657
Scott: He's printing.

607
00:39:40,737 --> 00:39:44,328
Scott: Oh, no, but now I rearranged the room and I moved the printer downstairs.

608
00:39:44,368 --> 00:39:44,930
Scott: That doesn't happen.

609
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:50,610
Rym: I had to convince some people at my company once because they these people wanted like three gigantic laser printers.

610
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,155
Scott: Oh, they are separate circuits.

611
00:39:52,496 --> 00:39:58,580
Rym: These things are like as big as like in like freezers three separate circuits and They want to put them in this room.

612
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,370
Rym: and I'm like, well, there's no network drops.

613
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:03,241
Rym: And then I look and I see one outlet in the room.

614
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:05,089
Rym: Yeah, I look at that outlet.

615
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:13,255
Rym: So I find the schematics and that outlet is shared with several other outlets in other rooms And I win.

616
00:40:13,275 --> 00:40:14,762
Rym: they were like, so what are we good to go?

617
00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:20,684
Rym: and I was like hell's no You can't plug even one of these in a car electrician.

618
00:40:20,704 --> 00:40:22,410
Rym: They're like why I was like.

619
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:27,288
Scott: You should say get it go get a power strip for five bucks from staples and try it.

620
00:40:28,432 --> 00:40:30,182
Rym: I didn't want him to burn the building down.

621
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,915
Scott: I wouldn't have burned the building down It would just flick the circuit breaker.

622
00:40:32,955 --> 00:40:38,399
Rym: most thing is I read the book that came with these printers X I actually read it apparently no one else.

623
00:40:38,499 --> 00:40:38,962
Rym: What did it say?

624
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,189
Scott: dedicated lines said?

625
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:43,822
Rym: Dedicated 20 amp circuit per.

626
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:45,229
Scott: ah, that's nice.

627
00:40:46,232 --> 00:40:46,774
Scott: You know what though?

628
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:47,538
Scott: That's pretty good printer.

629
00:40:48,101 --> 00:40:49,830
Rym: You know what it's fucking awesome for.

630
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:55,919
Rym: Oh, they also wanted to put all these printers in an unventilated room Which is bad for a lot of reason.

631
00:40:55,939 --> 00:40:58,010
Scott: remember what I said about needing to heat up the toner.

632
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,694
Rym: Yeah, not a printer.

633
00:40:59,895 --> 00:41:03,167
Scott: Not only is a printer basically a computer that's doing all.

634
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:06,069
Scott: you know modern ones Anyway, they're computing all the time and doing stuff.

635
00:41:06,472 --> 00:41:13,230
Scott: They're also have motors in them and not only do they have motors But they also are purposefully making heat in order to melt toner.

636
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:17,514
Scott: So as a lot of heat coming out of that It's not enough to hurt.

637
00:41:17,554 --> 00:41:22,250
Rym: like a printer gives off a small amount of toxic gas when your laser printer when you print.

638
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,961
Rym: That's just how it works, but it's not gonna hurt you.

639
00:41:25,022 --> 00:41:26,066
Rym: It's a really small amount.

640
00:41:26,106 --> 00:41:26,950
Rym: it dissipates in the air.

641
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:27,933
Scott: It smells good.

642
00:41:28,534 --> 00:41:33,870
Rym: like computers give off toxic gas technically they make ozone a lot of the time just in really small quantities.

643
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:34,635
Rym: It's not gonna hurt you.

644
00:41:35,058 --> 00:41:39,960
Scott: not like those ionic breeze Airfares that will hurt you because they make too much ozone.

645
00:41:40,201 --> 00:41:40,884
Rym: well the old ones.

646
00:41:40,924 --> 00:41:44,610
Scott: apparently they fix that well They still they were hurting old people and they still things suck.

647
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:44,891
Scott: You're better.

648
00:41:44,911 --> 00:41:45,594
Scott: I'm just getting a fan.

649
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:50,170
Scott: Yeah, or uh what the other kind of air filter the hepa hepa whatever.

650
00:41:50,531 --> 00:41:51,435
Scott: I had one of those kind.

651
00:41:51,495 --> 00:41:53,805
Scott: It's actually a filter and not some ionic shit.

652
00:41:54,206 --> 00:42:04,080
Rym: Yeah, but They well if you want to put a bunch of printers in a airtight room with no ventilation Not good that room with hot toxic gas in a hurry.

653
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,728
Rym: It sure will all right.

654
00:42:06,788 --> 00:42:07,410
Rym: I think we're done.

655
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,676
Rym: We said we wanted to go short.

656
00:42:08,696 --> 00:42:10,907
Rym: We didn't so much, but that's fine.

657
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:20,597
