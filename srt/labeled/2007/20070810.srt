1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,640
Rym: So, you might have noticed that there's not one, but two episodes in the feed for tonight.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,760
Rym: Well, the deal is, and this hasn't happened in a long time.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,300
Rym: We used to generate a lot of outtakes, but now, not so many.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,460
Rym: Scott and I, in the middle of the FPS key bindings show, got into a little bit of argument, partly that Scott started it.

5
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,799
Rym: I'll blame him entirely, because he's not here to defend himself.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:33,180
Rym: And as a result, we argued for a good 15 minutes about moving furniture and putting spices and food and non-conformism and all this crap when we were just trying to talk about FPS key bindings.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,240
Rym: So, instead of having an hour-and-change-long episode with that stuck in the middle of it, well, I just kind of cut it out like a little tumor.

8
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:45,639
Rym: And you know how when you go to the surgery and they cut out a gallstone or whatever, they always let you keep it.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,300
Rym: At least, they used to let you keep it in a little jar.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,620
Rym: Well, I kept that argument in a little jar, and I decided that, wait, we've always said, you know, we'll put in extra shows to make up for shows we've missed.

11
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:57,658
Rym: And this is probably the first extra show we've ever put up.

12
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:04,739
Rym: If this is your first time listening to GeekNights, I'm going to note, as we always note, that this is not a normal episode of GeekNights.

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,040
Rym: This is what we like to call a special.

14
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:16,640
Rym: So if you've never listened before, you're welcome to listen to this, but I would highly recommend you check out any episode in our entire feed that does not contain the word "special" in the title.

15
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,339
Rym: That's a much better picture of what this show is.

16
00:01:20,242 --> 00:01:21,560
Rym: This is entirely unedited.

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,400
Rym: I didn't really do anything to it except apply my normal high-pass filters and whatever.

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:38,140
Rym: Enjoy it or not, a lot of you have been asking for more arguments from us, so I can say with certainty that this is pretty much a straight-up, unedited, exactly how Scott and I argue pretty much every day of our lives.

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,599
Rym: We just happen to have been sitting in front of the microphones when we started this one.

20
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:51,120
Scott: Yeah, but the way you have your things arranged, like your bed at the foot facing the desk next to the wall over there, this is not a typical furniture arrangement.

21
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,900
Rym: All right, so it's not maybe, you know, white-bred, American, midwest...

22
00:01:55,022 --> 00:01:56,460
Scott: See, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,957
Scott: You always seem to have this attitude that if something is white-bred American, it's somehow bad.

24
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,918
Scott: Or if something is the accepted default, the way that a lot of people do something, then it must be bad because...

25
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,420
Rym: Now, now, Scott, I don't want to bring up logical fallacies here, but you are begging the question.

26
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:12,839
Scott: How am I begging the question?

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:20,838
Rym: Because you've jumped to the conclusion that because I somehow, in this one instance, used some setup that isn't somehow typical of standing...

28
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,460
Scott: You do this often.

29
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,100
Scott: You do often say, with food also, you're like, "Eh, it's such a white-bred American food.

30
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:27,740
Scott: It's no good.

31
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,538
Scott: You gotta, you know, you toss all sorts of weird spices in the

32
00:02:30,578 --> 00:02:30,779
Scott: food.".

33
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:31,660
Rym: Wait, wait a minute.

34
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,740
Rym: You're saying that I'm bad because I put spices in my food.

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,020
Scott: No, not because you put spice in your food, because you are not a cook yet when you cook.

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,520
Scott: You just sort of pick spices and you toss them in there, not according to any recipe or any cooking knowledge.

37
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,440
Rym: Actually, I do it according to all the websites that I write about how to use all those spices.

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:46,880
Rym: You know what?

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,599
Rym: It works pretty well.

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,660
Scott: You know, because you used to do that before you read any websites about spice.

41
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,858
Scott: You've been doing that since RIT.

42
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,679
Rym: When I started reading those websites.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,977
Scott: No, you didn't read any websites.

44
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:58,540
Rym: Like, I read all the uses for dill, and I started using it.

45
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,780
Rym: I used dill and ham, and I used dill on grilled cheese sandwiches, and I used dill and eggs.

46
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:04,138
Rym: Any savory dish.

47
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,679
Rym: Then I looked up how to use oregano.

48
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,959
Rym: Then I looked up how to use cilantro and all those things.

49
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:13,520
Scott: You just like to do things that are not what is standard.

50
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:16,420
Scott: You are a non-conformist, in a way.

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,840
Rym: So wait a minute, wait a minute.

52
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:19,220
Rym: Here's the thing.

53
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,137
Rym: This is what begs the question.

54
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:30,158
Rym: You seem to say that somehow I do it intentionally for the intent of being different, as opposed to, like in the case of my room, I had a rational reason that-

55
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:42,658
Scott: No, but you seem to, whether you admit it or not, you seem to have this attitude that the way that is not conforming is superior, or that the conformist way cannot possibly be the best way.

56
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,840
Rym: But that's not true at all.

57
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,840
Rym: Conforming or non-conforming has nothing to do with the end utility.

58
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,600
Scott: That is correct.

59
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,880
Scott: And yet, you seem to behave in contrast with that very thing.

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,400
Rym: See, Scott, you seem to have this problem, because you accuse me of this a lot.

61
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,840
Rym: If I like a wine, Scott always says, "Ah, you just like the idea of wine.

62
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,860
Rym: You don't actually like wine.

63
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,349
Rym: It tastes like

64
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:01,655
Rym: crap.".

65
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:04,400
Rym: Or, "You don't actually like the taste of alcohol.

66
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:05,172
Rym: You just want to get

67
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:05,437
Rym: drunk.".

68
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:10,100
Rym: Or, "You don't actually like the taste of that fancy cheese versus that unfancy cheese or whatever.

69
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:14,166
Rym: You just like the idea of liking the fancy French cheese instead of the weird American cheese or

70
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:14,532
Rym: whatever.".

71
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:22,040
Scott: But I really do like those things, and I don't know- You came to like them after originally having the idea that you would like them.

72
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,020
Scott: See, not at all.

73
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,345
Scott: Yeah.

74
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,199
Rym: I'd like you to back that up.

75
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:30,379
Scott: It's not something I can prove, it's just something I observed living with you, and there's no way I could prove it to anyone else.

76
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:32,559
Scott: Because- No one else has lived with you.

77
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:35,000
Rym: I like the taste of wine, so I buy wine.

78
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:38,059
Rym: I like the taste of cheese, so I buy the cheeses I like.

79
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,100
Rym: I like the taste of spices, so I buy the spices I like.

80
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:45,380
Scott: Why do you buy the fancy, weird wines that are not common?

81
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:46,698
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

82
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:47,980
Rym: What fancy, weird wine?

83
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,774
Rym: Most of the wines I buy are the $9 specials.

84
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:57,557
Rym: The only special bottle of wine I have is a bottle of port that was given to me as a gift, and I haven't opened it.

85
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:02,720
Scott: Why don't you drink just like whatever most people drink, just like default stuff?

86
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,339
Rym: Like what?

87
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:05,260
Scott: I don't know, because I don't know anything about wine.

88
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:11,998
Rym: The default wines, I guess, that most people drink are, I don't know, Chardonnays and California wines and Merlots, which I drink all the time.

89
00:05:13,923 --> 00:05:15,640
Rym: Most of my wine is super cheap.

90
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,060
Scott: But you won't eat American cheese.

91
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,719
Rym: Because American cheese is really bland.

92
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,798
Scott: You won't drink Budweiser.

93
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,460
Rym: Because Budweiser is really flavorless and watery and crappy.

94
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:30,140
Rym: It has nothing to do with any factor other than the fact that Budweiser, to me, tastes like crap.

95
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:37,400
Scott: What things do you like are super conformist as Budweiser and American cheese?

96
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,375
Rym: I really like Dr.

97
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:38,680
Rym: Pepper.

98
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:39,303
Scott: Dr.

99
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:41,895
Scott: Pepper's, but see, that's not, Dr.

100
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:42,940
Scott: Pepper's the weird one out.

101
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:43,768
Rym: How is Dr.

102
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:44,700
Rym: Pepper the weird one out?

103
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,599
Scott: It's like Coke and Pepsi are the mainstays.

104
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,399
Scott: Those are the white bread mainstream ones.

105
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:49,922
Scott: Dr.

106
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:51,579
Scott: Pepper's the third offshoot one.

107
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,959
Rym: Because those are colas.

108
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:53,965
Rym: Dr.

109
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:55,140
Rym: Pepper's not really a cola.

110
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,020
Scott: I'm just saying, you don't like anything.

111
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,929
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, because I like Dr.

112
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:01,876
Rym: Pepper instead of Coke, somehow I'm a non-conformist and I only like Dr.

113
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:02,020
Rym: Pepper.

114
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:06,600
Scott: What do you like, what do you do that could be considered conformist in any way?

115
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:07,136
Rym: I don't know.

116
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:08,298
Rym: I own a car.

117
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:09,659
Rym: I drive places.

118
00:06:10,743 --> 00:06:11,819
Rym: Sometimes I take trains.

119
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,600
Rym: I like sandwiches.

120
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:20,940
Scott: You don't ever order like the normal sandwich, you always get a sandwich with as many extra things on it as you can.

121
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,219
Rym: What do you mean like a normal sandwich?

122
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,739
Rym: Today for lunch, I had a ham and turkey sandwich with mustard, lettuce, tomato, and onion on white bread.

123
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,300
Scott: White bread, you said?

124
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:29,426
Scott: Yes.

125
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,340
Scott: Wonder bread?

126
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,460
Rym: No, it was the white roll that they had at the sub place.

127
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,000
Scott: Ah, so it's a roll, not a white bread.

128
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,659
Scott: When was the last time you ate white bread?

129
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:42,340
Rym: A few weeks ago when I bought some white bread.

130
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,380
Scott: You bought white bread?

131
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,920
Rym: It was white Italian bread and it had sesame seeds in it.

132
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:48,740
Rym: Oh, so the sesame seeds make me a non-conformist.

133
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,300
Scott: Zane, would you ever buy a white Wonder Bread?

134
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:53,676
Rym: Wonder Bread tastes like ass.

135
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:55,479
Scott: Ah, again.

136
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,700
Scott: You always buy the weirdest non-conforming bread you can buy.

137
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,819
Rym: Wait a minute, so buying the Italian bread is weirdest non-conformist as opposed to the nasty ass Wonder Bread?

138
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,333
Rym: I'm just saying, you refuse- Scott, Scott, Scott, would you eat Wonder Bread?

139
00:07:08,353 --> 00:07:10,380
Rym: because I've had Wonder Bread before and I know what it tastes like.

140
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,338
Rym: There's a reason I avoid it.

141
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:13,000
Rym: How come you don't buy the Wonder Bread?

142
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,060
Scott: Because I don't like the taste of it.

143
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:15,780
Rym: Oh, so you're a non-conformist.

144
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:23,240
Scott: You buy the fancy weird bread because you don't want to- No, I don't buy wheat bread, but I don't go out of my way to get the weirder bread.

145
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:33,960
Scott: When you go to the bread store, you have to buy, I see you looking at all the breads and you go to the breads that are like the most oddball breads on purpose, intentionally.

146
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:36,920
Rym: Do you ever think that maybe honey oat bread tastes really good?

147
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:44,072
Scott: See, but that's the thing, is you go for it like, "Ah, here's the good breads," as to say that the plain old wheat bread is no good.

148
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:46,340
Scott: while the wheat bread is awesome, the plain wheat bread is hot.

149
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,580
Rym: But you're begging the question.

150
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,940
Scott: What question am I begging?

151
00:07:49,240 --> 00:08:01,400
Rym: You're assuming a lot here and you're kind of skipping to the conclusion that honey wheat bread or honey oat bread, which is my favorite kind of bread in the world, I somehow like it for some reason other than the fact that it tastes like honey.

152
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:07,100
Scott: Well, the first time you bought honey wheat bread or honey oat bread or whatever, right?

153
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,560
Rym: You know what I thought the first time I saw honey oat bread?

154
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,740
Rym: I remember somewhat clearly.

155
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,460
Rym: I thought, "Wow, I really like honey and I really like oats.

156
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,199
Rym: Here's a bread made out of honey and oats.

157
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:17,770
Rym: Hot shit, I'm buying

158
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:17,992
Rym: this.".

159
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:27,379
Scott: But yeah, you always try, everything you like is a non-conforming, most out of the park thing.

160
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,240
Scott: Back that up at all.

161
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,379
Scott: What do you like?

162
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:31,852
Scott: Name a single thing you like.

163
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:33,019
Scott: that is a conforming thing.

164
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:40,940
Rym: I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here, because- While you agree that because something is- Beer, all right?

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,599
Rym: You brought up beer.

166
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,919
Rym: I think Coors and Budweiser taste like shit, but you know what?

167
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,180
Rym: I like Labatt Blue and I like Red Stripe a lot.

168
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,819
Rym: Red Stripe's one of my favorite beers.

169
00:08:52,341 --> 00:09:07,388
Scott: I'm just saying is you, while you agree that something is not better because it is non-conformist, you behave and act in a way in where you tend to approve more of things which do not conform and you go

170
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:09,779
Rym: out of your way- But you haven't backed that part up at all.

171
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:19,759
Scott: To consume and patronize things and behave in such a way that it is as far from the norm or as far from what you believe is the norm of America as you possibly can.

172
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,960
Rym: But that's not true at all.

173
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,937
Scott: But that's what you do.

174
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,839
Rym: But you haven't backed that up at all.

175
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,099
Rym: In fact, I grew up in the Midwest, right?

176
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:29,999
Rym: I put ketchup on my eggs.

177
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,738
Scott: That's weird.

178
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,538
Rym: How is that weird?

179
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,678
Scott: That's weird.

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,479
Rym: You realize that everyone there does that?

181
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:36,860
Scott: Yeah, it's weird.

182
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,179
Rym: I put salt on my watermelon like people do.

183
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:39,819
Scott: That's also weird.

184
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:40,760
Rym: That's what you're supposed to do.

185
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,260
Rym: It tastes better.

186
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,999
Scott: No, you're not supposed to do that.

187
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,296
Scott: Yes.

188
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:42,566
Scott: No.

189
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:45,900
Scott: All right, anyway, let's go back to the FPS in there.

190
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:49,780
Rym: I don't know if I can because apparently I'm such a non-conformist.

191
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,865
Rym: I think I got to break the-.

192
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:54,357
Rym: if you're going to put this label on me, then I guess I got to go with it.

193
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,189
Scott: Yeah.

194
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,060
Rym: I'll be like Anime Pulse.

195
00:09:59,044 --> 00:09:59,500
Rym: So go ahead.

196
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,515
Rym: Talk about your FPS-ing.

197
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:01,398
Rym: All right.

198
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,213
Rym: Chicken.

199
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:09,038
Rym: So- Interrupting guy.

200
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:11,387
Scott: An otaku generation.

201
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:13,680
Scott: that was an interrupting guy, I listened to it today, but I couldn't.

202
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,999
Rym: Why were you listening to Otaku?

203
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:20,140
Scott: Otaku Generation is like the worst podcast- I said that I would listen to any Otakon report.

204
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:21,700
Scott: I'll talk about this later.

205
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,499
Rym: That was a mistake.

206
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,460
Scott: All right, let's go back- You know what?

207
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,791
Rym: I think I'm going to review them first.

208
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:27,740
Rym: next time we do a Geekbot.

209
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:28,617
Scott: All right, let's go back now.

210
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:29,640
Rym: Back to what?

211
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,519
Rym: I'm a non-conformist.

212
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,720
Rym: I'm just letting it free flow here.

213
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,659
Rym: I'm like Fast Karate.

214
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:34,839
Rym: It's your fault.

215
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:37,619
Scott: Can we do the episode now?

216
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:38,800
Rym: Maybe.

217
00:10:39,461 --> 00:10:41,639
Rym: We'll see where the non-conformity takes me.

218
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:45,500
Scott: Are we actually going to do the episode or what?

219
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,137
Rym: That's up to you.

220
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:47,640
Scott: Am I a non-conformist?

221
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,700
Scott: I'm ready to do it or are you going to be the interrupting guy?

222
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:51,100
Rym: Am I a non-conformist, Scott?

223
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,778
Rym: Yes, you are.

224
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:56,156
Rym: Am I a non-conformist for reasons other than the fact that that just happens to be the things that I like?

225
00:10:57,701 --> 00:11:08,040
Scott: I think that yes, but you have successfully come up with a indefeatable argument in where I cannot successfully argue that that is the truth.

226
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,460
Rym: But you didn't even defeat my primary argument, so it doesn't really matter that you can't defeat my bullshit argument.

227
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Scott: I'm saying that's the way it is, but your argument saying you are not is foolproof because there's no way to prove what is in your mind.

228
00:11:20,121 --> 00:11:22,500
Rym: My argument- But that's not even my argument.

229
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,900
Rym: My argument was that you didn't have any evidence at all.

230
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,759
Scott: I have evidence.

231
00:11:26,181 --> 00:11:28,300
Rym: All you did was beg the question and jump to conclusions.

232
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:44,720
Scott: You go out, you do, I observe that you go out of your way to do things in a non-conforming fashion and behave in a way that gives people around you the idea that you approve of things which do not conform more than you approve of things that do conform.

233
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,856
Rym: That's quite a statement and I noticed that you haven't backed it up with any single shred of evidence.

234
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,500
Scott: That is what I observe living with you.

235
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:51,259
Scott: That's all I got.

236
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,760
Rym: So all you've got is anecdotes and you don't even have anecdotes.

237
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,200
Rym: You have one assertion with no backing.

238
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,980
Scott: Because I don't remember my specific observations, but I lived with you long enough.

239
00:12:04,402 --> 00:12:05,420
Scott: What else do you want me to do here?

240
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,540
Scott: It's not like a scientific- Potatoes!

241
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:06,820
Rym: Chicken!

242
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:07,712
Scott: Chicken!

243
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,719
Scott: Are we done here?

244
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:09,757
Scott: I'm tired of this.

245
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:12,860
Rym: Alright, go ahead.

246
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,240
Rym: Talk about your FPS crap.

247
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,360
Scott: Are you going to do your chicken?

248
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:15,748
Rym: Maybe.

249
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:17,940
Rym: Just go ahead.

250
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,700
Rym: Let's see what happens.

251
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,900
Rym: Like I said, this is free flow.

252
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:25,358
Rym: Did I break you?

253
00:12:27,484 --> 00:12:29,300
Scott: I just wanted to go back to the FPS show.

254
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:30,979
Rym: I don't even care about that anymore.

255
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:31,777
Rym: What the hell?

256
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Rym: Because I already did my piece.

257
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,800
Rym: I already got my say out.

258
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,060
Rym: I already gave everyone my say.

259
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:38,780
Rym: In fact, I have more.

260
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,559
Rym: I could keep talking.

261
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:42,959
Rym: About that keyboard that I wrote stuff all over.

262
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:45,580
Rym: I had the overlay for my own keyboard.

263
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,168
Rym: Yeah.

264
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:46,840
Scott: Great.

265
00:12:47,562 --> 00:12:48,019
Rym: Alright, go on.

266
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,336
Rym: Talk about your boring FPSs.

267
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:52,500
Rym: I don't want to win any more arguments tonight.

268
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,291
Rym: Scott!

269
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:56,399
Rym: Do the show!

270
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,239
Rym: How come you keep laughing?

271
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,800
Scott: Because I'm not done laughing yet and because I know you're going to interrupt.

272
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,860
Rym: I'm waiting for you to do the show.

273
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,576
Rym: I won't interrupt you.

274
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:03,780
Scott: Alright.

275
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:04,838
Rym: Just don't laugh.

276
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,379
Rym: Can you keep from laughing?

277
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,040
Scott: I don't know.

278
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,100
Scott: Where are we going to cut off that and- I'm waiting.

279
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:11,958
Rym: Do the show.

280
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:12,696
Scott: Go on.

281
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:15,980
Scott: Why are you all intentionally trying to mess me up, Barry?

282
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:18,452
Rym: How am I intentionally trying to-?

283
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:19,840
Rym: Now I'll play those arguments.

284
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:23,160
Rym: All I'm doing is asking you to continue the show like you wanted.

285
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,038
Rym: I'm giving you everything.

286
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,178
Scott: No, but you're all like, "Come on.

287
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,199
Scott: Continue the show.

288
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:26,446
Scott: Come

289
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:26,593
Scott: on.".

290
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:30,760
Scott: In a way that implies that you are not going to continue the show as normal.

291
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,960
Rym: So what you're saying is that simply by my tone of voice, I can prevent you from continuing the show from both bits of laughter?

292
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,940
Scott: No, you can't prevent me from continuing the show.

293
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,939
Rym: Because you keep cracking up.

294
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,480
Scott: But I am hesitant to continue the show because I think that you are going to not go through with it and that I'll have to restart again.

295
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,240
Rym: But the thing is, you're reading into a lot of stuff because the words I said were that I will not interrupt you and I'll let you continue the show the moment you start.

296
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:55,991
Scott: All right.

297
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:57,600
Scott: So you're not kidding?

298
00:13:57,841 --> 00:13:58,798
Rym: I'm not going to interrupt you.

299
00:13:59,341 --> 00:13:59,779
Rym: I'm ready.

300
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,460
Rym: It's free flow, but I'm going to let you flow for a while.

301
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,119
Scott: I think you're going to screw something up.

302
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,837
Rym: Well, go ahead.

303
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,879
Rym: The onus is entirely on you.

304
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,512
Scott: The onus.

305
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:12,420
Scott: Well, you're looking- smiling.

306
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:15,399
Scott: How long has this been?

307
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,138
Rym: You don't have a problem here, Scott.

308
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:19,240
Scott: You're making a problem on purpose.

309
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,399
Scott: Did you take some drugs before I got home?

310
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:22,540
Rym: You just keep laughing.

311
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,319
Rym: Just do the show.

312
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,212
Scott: All right.

313
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,760
Scott: Wow, this hasn't happened in a long time.

314
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:36,680
Rym: I'm not actually doing anything, guys.

315
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:37,759
Rym: I'm really just sitting here.

316
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,800
Scott: And no, he turns around, looks at me and smiles.

317
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:41,600
Rym: Wait a minute.

318
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,340
Rym: So I have the power by turning around and looking at you to completely derail you and prevent you from speaking.

319
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,077
Scott: No.

320
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:55,159
Rym: I have so much psychic power that with a mere glance, I can- it's like Tasha's hideous laughter that seventh level spell.

321
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,159
Scott: It's a Morty giggly right now, and it doesn't take much.

322
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,400
Rym: All right, Scott, I won't turn around and look at you.

323
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,220
Scott: You're going to do something.

324
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:05,980
Scott: Wow.

325
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:10,279
Scott: When was the last time we had a show where we got completely derailed and we had to cut it out?
