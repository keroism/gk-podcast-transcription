1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,448
Scott: It's Monday September 24th.

2
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:12,491
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:15,640
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,659
Scott: Malware what it is how not to get it and how to get rid of it.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,397
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:36,700
Rym: Well on Friday we went to a metal concert though We means everyone but Scott who stayed home and went to bed other people did not go besides me.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,716
Scott: How many other person how many people were there total in the whole group in the whole place?

8
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:42,860
Rym: Oh in the whole place?

9
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:44,409
Rym: I don't know a hundred.

10
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:49,974
Scott: So you're telling me that Everyone meaning seven billion went now.

11
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:50,980
Scott: It was seven billion minus.

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,205
Rym: I thought that was really lame.

13
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:58,189
Rym: out of the front row crew who was coming to our house for the weekend Only two people did not attend this concert.

14
00:00:58,249 --> 00:01:01,440
Rym: And in fact two other people who did not stay for D&D attended this concert.

15
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:03,206
Scott: Oh, I didn't know that.

16
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:14,289
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, we went to a fin troll concert, which is I'm just gonna call it heavy metal because I don't really care much about all the different Is it hardcore metal?

17
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:15,839
Rym: Is it folk orchestral?

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,388
Rym: Gruntle sub architect metal.

19
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:18,830
Rym: I don't know.

20
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:24,071
Rym: I I kind of ignore sub genres in music but anyway, it was a pretty badass concert.

21
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:31,400
Rym: went on real laters at the chance in Poughkeepsie, but Something interesting happened well beyond the fact that we got to see fin troll live.

22
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:39,138
Rym: So, you know any concert like this a whole bunch of bands will play and as we learned from the tool concert We went to back and we were at RIT.

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,724
Rym: Sometimes those bands suck Particularly phantomas.

24
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:46,311
Scott: Yeah, do we tell that story?

25
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:48,160
Rym: I don't know if we did enough and I'm just gonna skip it.

26
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:51,860
Rym: All right, if we didn't tell the story, maybe someone will tell us we didn't tell it.

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,340
Rym: But uh, we're at this concert and a band comes out and they're okay.

28
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,006
Rym: I mean they weren't great, but they weren't terrible.

29
00:01:57,046 --> 00:02:01,060
Rym: So I'm chilling and then the announcer comes out of the MC.

30
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:01,682
Rym: Who's?

31
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:06,240
Rym: this gigantic awesome black guy is the same guy who was there the last time I went to the chance.

32
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,775
Rym: I think he's the owner or something or at least he's like the permanent MC.

33
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:10,979
Scott: He's he's the guy.

34
00:02:11,242 --> 00:02:13,380
Rym: He's big and jolly and he's a really cool guy.

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,639
Rym: He always comes out and he has funny things to say and he gets the crowd together and he's real jovial and it's cool.

36
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:28,335
Rym: And he comes out and he introduces the next band and he says now I want to warn all of you that this band is not exactly metal But I think you might like him seriously.

37
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:33,255
Rym: give these guys a chance I this might be up your alley and he basically just kept saying, you know, check this band out.

38
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:34,500
Rym: Give it a chance.

39
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,504
Rym: This is gonna be pretty cool.

40
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:45,200
Rym: You're gonna like it and then the band comes out and They're kind of mediocre, all right They say Jesus a lot and we're debating with each other.

41
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:49,974
Rym: Are they a Christian metal band or are they just being ironic about it?

42
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:51,297
Rym: Cuz I don't understand bands.

43
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,240
Scott: Why would they come there?

44
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,126
Scott: Why would don't they usually stick together?

45
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:55,591
Scott: Well, no, it wouldn't matter.

46
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:57,257
Scott: This isn't fintral like pagan.

47
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:58,160
Rym: Well, that's the thing.

48
00:02:58,562 --> 00:03:00,069
Rym: We're not sure if it's a Christian band.

49
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:00,693
Rym: We're leaning toward.

50
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:05,771
Rym: no because fintral The the thing about fintral is they're basically a pagan band.

51
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:11,310
Rym: when fintral came out on the stage after their first song They basically said how do you feel about?

52
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,824
Rym: Christians and the crowd is like He was like.

53
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:21,379
Rym: tonight we will have a song about how to enjoy Christians by cooking them.

54
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,120
Rym: They're like super anti-christian is kind of funny.

55
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,886
Rym: But so we're debating.

56
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:28,910
Rym: is this fan Christian?

57
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:34,334
Rym: and they kept saying Jesus, but whatever I think you could have been saying something bad about him.

58
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:35,520
Rym: We couldn't tell it was metal.

59
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,800
Rym: It was blah blah blah blah blah Jesus blah blah Jesus blah.

60
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:49,084
Rym: Then he made a pose the main singer of someone being crucified and he was not being ironic About the fourth or fifth time.

61
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,749
Rym: He did that we started to suspect.

62
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:56,106
Rym: and then the last song they played was entitled yay God Uh-huh.

63
00:03:56,428 --> 00:04:00,084
Rym: So yeah, there were Christian metal which independent of that They were pretty crappy.

64
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:05,220
Rym: all their songs sounded the same and the worst thing is the guy was dancing on stage.

65
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:11,640
Rym: It was as though he had read a book on how to dance on stage, but he did it technically very well.

66
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:18,380
Rym: But it just ended up looking really really stupid enforced and the crowd was basically just standing there ignoring him and he came over.

67
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:25,418
Rym: He's trying to like clap and get the crowd to clap and the people in the front are just kind of staring at him with This look of what the fuck you trying to get me to do.

68
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:30,909
Rym: At one point he starts singing right in the face of this girl Who's just looking at him like you've got to be kidding me.

69
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:37,093
Rym: and then he like puts his hand in her face like blah And she moves to bite him and he backs off like shit.

70
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:39,280
Scott: Yeah, it was a metal concert.

71
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:45,000
Rym: Yep, so, uh the band gets off the stage and another band plays Lazarus, which was fucking awesome.

72
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:46,126
Rym: And then another band plays.

73
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:49,202
Rym: they're kind of mediocre and before a fintroll I comes out.

74
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:52,491
Rym: the cool MC comes out and he has a few words to say.

75
00:04:53,052 --> 00:05:01,395
Rym: I'm gonna paraphrase, but he basically says to us now apparently black star incorporated which is the crappy Christian metal band that played.

76
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:11,759
Rym: I Thought that I somehow Disrespected them by saying that they were in a metal band and the crowd starts to yell, but he says well I'll get into that I'll get to that.

77
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:20,140
Rym: So I have a message and I'd like to say a few words about black star Incorporated and how I may or may not have introduced them in a level of respect involved.

78
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,247
Rym: Fuck you black star Inc.

79
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:25,400
Rym: Fuck you goddamn pussies your music sucked.

80
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:31,200
Rym: You're one of the worst bands that has ever played at the chance and the fact that you I didn't disrespect you.

81
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,659
Rym: You're not a metal band and I warned the audience that the audience doesn't hate you because I told him you weren't metal.

82
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:38,849
Rym: the audience Hated you because you sucked ass.

83
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,220
Rym: I hope you're still here so you can leave in shame.

84
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:42,424
Rym: Fuck your parents.

85
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:44,872
Rym: Fuck your uncles and anyone who was here to see you.

86
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:51,464
Rym: So without further ado fintro It was Quite hilarious.

87
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:56,971
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know a guy who runs a small place like that, you know He doesn't have anything to lose.

88
00:05:57,011 --> 00:05:58,120
Rym: He doesn't answer to anyone.

89
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,775
Scott: He doesn't mean to lose by insulting some crap band that probably didn't bring.

90
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:04,520
Scott: no one came there to see black star incorporated.

91
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:08,919
Rym: I am NOT saying oh they sucked because they were Christian metal and all that does.

92
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:10,735
Rym: granted I never heard Christian rock.

93
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:11,220
Rym: that was good.

94
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,046
Rym: But if anyone can find me some I'll give it a go.

95
00:06:13,648 --> 00:06:17,540
Rym: the band independently of being Christian metal was just really crappy.

96
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:18,664
Scott: Yeah, but think about it.

97
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,530
Scott: He knows the customers here.

98
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:23,520
Scott: That's the kind of thing to make the customers like him and come back.

99
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:24,905
Rym: I'll go back course.

100
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:25,728
Rym: I like the chance.

101
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:26,611
Rym: the two concerts.

102
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:29,060
Rym: I've been to there have been about what I expected kind of awesome.

103
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,686
Scott: It's how small places like that are.

104
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:31,610
Scott: they're all kind of cool.

105
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,036
Scott: if they're not kind of cool.

106
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:34,080
Scott: They're not around anymore.

107
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:36,640
Rym: Sadly, I forgot to bring jeans with me to work.

108
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:45,152
Rym: So when I took the train up to the concert, I ended up going to this metal concert wearing white pressed dress pants And black dress shoes.

109
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:47,684
Scott: Yeah That's one problem.

110
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:53,500
Scott: I always have at concerts is I want to be in the concert with nothing but jeans and a t-shirt, right?

111
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,368
Rym: But remember a tool.

112
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:55,640
Rym: they even took away your carabiner.

113
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:58,539
Scott: Yeah, but it's like that's all I want to have on me.

114
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:04,226
Scott: The problem is I got to have my keys to get back to my car possibly my wallet Maybe a ticket or something.

115
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:07,580
Scott: It's like I have to have this stuff because it's but there's nowhere to put it.

116
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:08,845
Scott: But I don't want to have it.

117
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,875
Scott: I just want to wear jeans and t-shirt nothing else.

118
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,000
Scott: It's very difficult.

119
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:16,500
Rym: Luckily Alex drove there drove to work as you know, we didn't want to take the train home late at night.

120
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,680
Rym: In fact, I think the last train would have been after the concert ended.

121
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,960
Rym: So I just left all my crap in his car.

122
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,550
Rym: I went in there with my wallet so that I could buy booze.

123
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,280
Scott: Yeah, and in my defense for not going I mean first of all, I was tired.

124
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,576
Rym: I mean, I had a whole day of shoe shopping and he was just exhausted.

125
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:33,444
Scott: It was a few people Frickin.

126
00:07:33,464 --> 00:07:34,580
Scott: I got home.

127
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,998
Scott: I would have had to like leave immediately for the concert with no time at home and I had stuff to do.

128
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:45,633
Scott: and I was tired and I Heard seen fintral on YouTube and I was not so impressed.

129
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:47,077
Rym: So I was impressed.

130
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:47,939
Rym: I really liked fintral.

131
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,150
Rym: granted I'll admit I liked Lazarus more because they were very.

132
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:57,080
Rym: Lazarus was very much the kind of standard 80s early 90s metal that I really really liked.

133
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:06,555
Scott: Yeah But give it a choice between like driving like 20 minutes to Poughkeepsie staying there for hours and hours and hours driving 20 minutes back and going to bed at like 2 a.m.

134
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:14,680
Rym: Or Well to speak in Scott's defense - I was at a heavy metal concert and the band that played before fintral.

135
00:08:15,263 --> 00:08:18,077
Rym: I fell asleep during it because I was so tired.

136
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,189
Rym: There you go Emily and I both just kind of fell asleep.

137
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,179
Rym: And then I realized the irony of that the next day.

138
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:28,360
Scott: I hope that the band as I awoke and everyone in the house is sleeping.

139
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:40,630
Rym: I just hope that the band that was playing didn't see me cuz that That would really have to be a kick in the balls if you're playing at a metal concert and you're on stage and there's some Dude, and a girl next to him asleep.

140
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:47,075
Scott: Yeah, but I mean seriously though I woke up like three hours before everyone else on Saturday and did a whole bunch of stuff.

141
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:48,360
Rym: Yeah, I was exhausted.

142
00:08:48,542 --> 00:09:04,857
Rym: I do also want to say that I Have and so does Scott and most of us in the crew have semi expensive super awesome musicians earplugs that They reduce their not expensive like $14 compared to normal earplugs, which are like 50 cents.

143
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:05,900
Scott: Are they really?

144
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,960
Rym: Yeah, you can buy a sack of normal earplugs at Home Depot for like nothing.

145
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:11,667
Scott: Let's see how much they actually cost.

146
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:12,149
Scott: hold on who.

147
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,460
Scott: they have new versions for small ear canals.

148
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:17,540
Rym: Ah, well, you know we talked about isolation earbuds.

149
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:26,121
Rym: These are kind of the same thing But they're specifically made for playing in or being at concerts and that they reduce the volume overall like 10 20.

150
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:27,651
Rym: But how many deficit decibels you want?

151
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:28,980
Rym: but they do it evenly.

152
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,820
Rym: So if you wear it like normal foam orange earplugs, the music sounds kind of crappy.

153
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:47,500
Rym: but if you don't wear earplugs you do fantastic amounts of damage to your hearing in short order and by the time the band you actually went to see plays because they always play last your ears are fatigued and usually feel like Shit, unless you're already half deaf from going to concerts

154
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,784
Scott: They're $12.

155
00:09:48,784 --> 00:09:55,002
Scott: and yeah going to just one concert without earplugs will do permanent damage to your hearing Period.

156
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:57,411
Rym: end of story and I've been to like three.

157
00:09:57,592 --> 00:10:05,180
Scott: well, I guess if you want to like some classical music Maybe not, but it depends on the real close and there's a full orchestra or some fucking earplugs.

158
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,044
Scott: Yeah, in fact,

159
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:10,947
Rym: I'll even say I played in bands in high school not just hot like in the high school But I played trumpet and especially

160
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,273
Scott: they have hornet instruments

161
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:20,136
Rym: playing in a band Will fuck your hearing up pretty quickly and I do have a minor amount of hearing loss right about in the range where my trumpet was

162
00:10:21,144 --> 00:10:21,712
Scott: it happens.

163
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:30,528
Rym: but The fact that several of our friends were at this concert without earplugs was quite disturbing to me to be honest Because I was wearing the super fancy head.

164
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:33,439
Scott: I wear earplugs in like dealers rooms at conventions.

165
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,547
Rym: Yes I start I wear earplugs on the train.

166
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:37,554
Rym: I wear earplugs on the subway a lot of times.

167
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,920
Rym: if I'm driving I'll wear them.

168
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,189
Scott: Yeah, well driving not so safe.

169
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:43,960
Rym: Well, it's okay because remember these aren't no sound at all.

170
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,563
Rym: These are all.

171
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:46,676
Rym: sound is attenuated by I think 15 decibels.

172
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:47,962
Scott: I think it's 20.

173
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:51,740
Scott: I forget you can get 30 decibel ones if you want, but the ones we have are 20.

174
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,550
Rym: You can also get like 5 decibel ones.

175
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:55,480
Scott: Yeah, those would be okay for driving.

176
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,414
Scott: You can pick the amount of attenuation you want Yeah, but the ones they sell the ones that I'm talking about are $12 in their 20s.

177
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:03,026
Rym: Yeah, they're totally worth it.

178
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:05,980
Rym: If you go to more than one concert in your life buy a pair of these.

179
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:08,540
Scott: Yeah, they come in a little thingy so you can carry them around with you.

180
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,780
Rym: The music will sound better because your ears won't get fatigued and you won't get a headache.

181
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,162
Rym: It's kind

182
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:25,780
Scott: of funny like if you go to a concert and they just start up like a metal concert especially where they start it up and if you let you try to listen is Right and you put the earplugs in and suddenly it sounds like their album is playing and you're like, oh man

183
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,162
Rym: It's so

184
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:27,663
Scott: awesome.

185
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:28,024
Scott: Yeah.

186
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:30,090
Scott: All right, right news.

187
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:32,096
Rym: Oh, yeah, you got some news for us.

188
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:36,080
Scott: being Monday night I do as far as I'm concerned, right?

189
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,617
Scott: There are two types of personal computers for normal people in their houses home users.

190
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:42,380
Rym: not ten types.

191
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:44,099
Scott: No two types and two.

192
00:11:45,241 --> 00:12:01,930
Scott: yes, the the two types are number one the completely normal computer for like your mom who wants to browse the web and do normal email and I am and normal stuff and then does the serious machine for someone who wants to Play games and Photoshop and edit videos.

193
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,880
Rym: I are serious cat and my computer are serious business.

194
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,395
Scott: Yes, there are two types of computers for home users at any one per moment in time.

195
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:15,072
Scott: There is a best Computer for the normal person and a best computer for the crazy person.

196
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:16,295
Scott: in terms of price.

197
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:20,648
Scott: I mean in terms of performance $10,000 is always the winner.

198
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:25,837
Scott: Yeah, but but in terms of price performance ratio there is always one sweet spot for each machine.

199
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:43,523
Scott: and until now the crat the normal computer for normal people in terms of a PC that you build has been an AMD machine because of and if you buy you can you can go out to Newegg and buy an Nvidia.

200
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:49,513
Scott: well, not the motherboard won't be made by Nvidia but a motherboard with Nvidia chips all over it.

201
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:59,796
Scott: that for like $100 contains a video card a sound card a network card Everything except pretty much the RAM the CPU and a hard drive.

202
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:01,060
Rym: now think about that.

203
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,000
Rym: If you have a computer that's just surfing the web and whatever that's everything you need except the actual processor and RAM.

204
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:11,720
Scott: Yeah, they have Nvidia because they make the n-force chips and all this other stuff.

205
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:16,960
Scott: The n-force chips is like a whole computer almost on two chips except for the CPU and RAM.

206
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:21,635
Rym: Yeah, and I mean a lot of people especially people our age who kind of grew up during the.

207
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:29,400
Rym: the only way to build a Usable computer is to build it yourself because there was a time when to make a powerful computer There's really the only way to make something that was reasonably priced.

208
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:38,609
Rym: yeah, if you the the common wisdom was onboard components are shit usually because of the Previous issues with that with the wind modems.

209
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,214
Scott: Yeah, and that's most.

210
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:41,980
Scott: wind modems like ISA modems.

211
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,026
Rym: Yeah, but like does that sort of thing?

212
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:44,207
Rym: like?

213
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:48,440
Rym: embedded components were crap embedded sound cards just were shitty and embedded video cards were slow.

214
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:55,840
Rym: but nowadays unless you're Podcasting or something an onboard sound card no matter who made it is more than enough and totally perfect.

215
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,385
Rym: You will not be able to hear this.

216
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:57,646
Scott: most.

217
00:13:57,646 --> 00:14:04,600
Scott: 99% of people just need to hear stereo sound and an onboard sound card Will do that with no hit to your performance.

218
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:13,114
Rym: Yep sound card technology in terms of making the audio sound good For consumers has not other than fancy stuff like surround sound or whatever.

219
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:19,520
Rym: in terms of playing stereo audio Has not significantly improved in like eight years All right.

220
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,508
Scott: So, you know every other component is the same way.

221
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:26,640
Scott: most people just want to look at 2d imagery an onboard video card.

222
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,383
Scott: Does that now?

223
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:30,837
Scott: most people just want to get a network connection an onboard Nick.

224
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:31,500
Scott: does that now?

225
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,140
Scott: So what do you care if it's on board or not?

226
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:42,346
Scott: So the cheapest way to get a computer for like your mom to just browse the web was to get an nVidia n-force IGP which is see.

227
00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:49,337
Scott: most n-forces don't have IGP which means you still need to go out and get a video card Separately and put it in your AGP or PCI Express x16 slot.

228
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:58,335
Scott: But if you get an IGP, there's a video card built in to your Northbridge, which is like well I don't have to buy a video card that saves you so much money.

229
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,200
Scott: I'm buying the computer.

230
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:01,709
Scott: You can't say no if you don't need 3d.

231
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,720
Scott: In fact, it does 3d, you know weak 3d pretty well.

232
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:06,819
Scott: You could probably play like half-life 1 with one of those things.

233
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,004
Rym: Oh, you could easily play.

234
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:10,333
Rym: the half-life 1 requires you get all.

235
00:15:10,373 --> 00:15:11,899
Scott: you could definitely play quake 1 & 2 with.

236
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:16,158
Scott: you know You won't get like 60 FPS constantly, but you could play reasonably with one, right?

237
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:26,840
Scott: So the problem here for Intel has been that if you want to get an Intel Chip instead of an AMD chip and you don't want to spend a lot in the computer.

238
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:33,938
Scott: That's gonna be troublesome because you're gonna have to get some sort of Intel motherboard with an Intel video card on board and it.

239
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,640
Scott: You know, it's it's more expensive.

240
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:44,360
Scott: But Nvidia the news is this that Nvidia has said they're going to make an n-force chip with the IGP for Intel.

241
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,554
Scott: So now the cheapest and best computer for your mom might not be AMD.

242
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:54,440
Rym: when Nvidia gets this stuff rolling man Intel has just been wrecking AMD left and right.

243
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,909
Scott: I don't know because AMD is actually hitting back those.

244
00:15:57,949 --> 00:15:59,874
Scott: there's like the new quad-core octoron.

245
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:02,060
Scott: things are supposedly like the shit.

246
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:11,854
Rym: Well, yeah But at the same time the next iteration of the core 2 and all those is supposedly going to be the same Super-efficient architecture but ramped up another gigahertz.

247
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:12,517
Rym: it could be.

248
00:16:12,557 --> 00:16:22,560
Scott: but at the moment I think if I remember what people were saying you could get one of these like quad-core Octorons for like a few hundred dollars, which is like a ludicrous price for like the best chip out there.

249
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:36,003
Rym: Well the problem it's hard to say because Intel and AMD compete with each other but they compete with each other in two completely separate arenas the home user PC and the enterprise server Server PC.

250
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:41,100
Scott: There's also the laptop arena, which oh, yeah the third arena which Intel has been completely dominating.

251
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:47,981
Scott: Well in terms of consumers and PC's they also compete in other areas that you don't notice because you're just as far as you care About.

252
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:48,523
Rym: it's those three.

253
00:16:48,563 --> 00:17:02,920
Rym: and well Intel almost always had the advantage on power consumption Which is why they always win the laptop or I mean Especially back in the day like in the AMD k7 era an AMD laptop was perhaps the most laughable idea in the world.

254
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:05,589
Scott: Yeah, pretty not so good granted.

255
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,958
Rym: They were cheap, but the battery lasted like five minutes.

256
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,284
Rym: Yep Alright, right.

257
00:17:10,545 --> 00:17:32,559
Rym: So I find this very interesting and I guess it was kind of expected but according to this article on slashdot Linux is going to be installed at every single school in Russia by 2009 that they're generally trying to just give up on Windows and Outfit all their schools with PCs and servers and all the IT stuff they need running Linux.

258
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:35,639
Scott: Someone must actually be thinking about something there.

259
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:45,087
Rym: There's a lot of speculation both by me and people onto internet as to why this is the case and I think I'm just I'm not Gonna bother with the article I'm just gonna break it down as to why I think

260
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:49,294
Scott: someone in a position of power to make a decision was convinced by someone Intelligent.

261
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:53,333
Rym: Oh, yeah but I mean like actual direct reasons as in the cause and effects think of this.

262
00:17:53,734 --> 00:18:04,435
Rym: that used to be that a lot of developing countries or even developed or mostly developed countries they used Windows because they just pirated it and Microsoft couldn't really do anything about it.

263
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:10,856
Rym: I mean Microsoft couldn't really tell Russia to stop Russians from pirating because they had no leverage.

264
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:34,355
Rym: the same thing with China and India and all these Countries, but as these countries become more and more quote-unquote Legitimate in the world marketplace and start competing like actually for serious, you know for real in the marketplace there are international agencies and regulations and law enforcement bodies and organizations that can Do bad things and trade sanctions and all that sort of thing to a country like Russia.

265
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:45,509
Rym: if they continue to allow software Piracy to happen and the more legitimate the economies of these countries get in terms of a modern international market the more pressure is on them to not allow piracy.

266
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:52,833
Rym: and Russia being somewhat smart must have realized that hey We were only using Windows because it was free.

267
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:56,648
Rym: now that we have to pay for it Why don't we just use Linux because it's free.

268
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,472
Rym: Yeah.

269
00:18:57,672 --> 00:19:01,909
Scott: Yeah, that's obviously a logical thing But you know, who knows what actual?

270
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,700
Scott: well, there's more chronic process ended in this decision.

271
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:16,097
Rym: In Russia unlike in say the United States the government or whatever bodies control different arms of the government Have a lot more power to just say this is the way you're doing it.

272
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:22,407
Rym: Fuck you Yeah, so if someone higher up says alright Why don't we standardize the country on X?

273
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:26,040
Rym: because it'll be cheaper overall and we can standardize on support and blah blah blah blah.

274
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:27,974
Rym: They can just force people to.

275
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:33,420
Rym: but in America It's really hard to force companies or public institutions to do anything.

276
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:34,938
Scott: It sure is.

277
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:39,520
Rym: And in the end, I think this is gonna be a good thing because oh, there's no doubt about that.

278
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:48,088
Rym: what are the primary reasons that Windows has a large user base among nor like people who are into technology is just that It's the OS they used first.

279
00:19:48,188 --> 00:20:01,794
Rym: because if you use any UI or any OS first That's gonna be the one you're comfortable with and a lot of people really don't understand their computer enough to be able to Understand that doing this in this operating system is analogous.

280
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:08,119
Rym: understand all the hackers come from Russia But if you start on Linux, you'll be more likely to use Linux.

281
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:15,383
Scott: Yes in general because I can't say that's why in the early days Apple pushed their Apple twos and their Macs into the school So heavily.

282
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:32,980
Scott: but you know and it was until later that you know Windows Dominated the business world that schools switched not because the the apples and the Macs were no good But because they realized that with the kids Using the apples and the Macs weren't being prepared to for the business world where Windows was the winner.

283
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:38,400
Scott: So that's you know, it eventually came down from the top, you know into the colleges and the high schools in the middle schools.

284
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:47,399
Scott: None of the elementary schools pushing out the apples yep, but originally it was the apples because Steve Jobs and they pushed it in there really hard knowing that was gonna help them.

285
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:49,080
Scott: and It kind of did.

286
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,028
Scott: I mean you have people who were in.

287
00:20:51,068 --> 00:20:57,256
Scott: they were kids played the Oregon Trail on their apples and Nowadays, they're buying iPods and using their Mac books.

288
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:04,680
Rym: now I'm not gonna make the argument that Using Linux instead of Windows will make these kids better at using computers because it's really not the case.

289
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:13,840
Rym: What is gonna happen is they're just gonna be used to using Linux and most people no matter how educated they are Just are never going to understand exactly how their computers work.

290
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,178
Rym: They're going to understand how to make the computer they use do what they want to do.

291
00:21:17,198 --> 00:21:33,106
Scott: though I do think that in Russia more a greater percentage of people understand because Russia seems to have a lot of a Larger or at least from my perspective, you know with my just my feel for my Hackers and those types in.

292
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:37,943
Rym: I would argue that the only reason that is true is because the laws are a lot more lax in Russia.

293
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,900
Rym: it could be easier to get away with that stuff.

294
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,400
Scott: It could be but you know Russia has all sorts of things coming out of it like the all of mp3s and such.

295
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:45,386
Rym: Well, that's again.

296
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:47,620
Rym: That's just because the copyright laws are different there.

297
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:54,573
Rym: How many people who are quote-unquote Russian hackers are actually u.s People just working with Russian people because they don't want to get caught.

298
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:57,284
Rym: It's hard to say it could be Of course granted.

299
00:21:57,344 --> 00:22:02,099
Rym: maybe this kind of gray market black market culture has facilitated people.

300
00:22:03,924 --> 00:22:06,718
Scott: You know when the kids are all wares in there they're learning to.

301
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:08,655
Scott: you know They go from script kitty to a kid.

302
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:09,240
Scott: you actually knows.

303
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:15,425
Rym: I guess you could have a point because I think back to when the US was still the wild wild west and Much of what I learned about computers.

304
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:20,120
Rym: I learned from being in that wares scene and trying to hack and crack and dollars.

305
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:28,756
Rym: Yep things of the day.

306
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:30,279
Rym: now last week.

307
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:35,814
Rym: I talked about Captain don't tase me bro, and how he totally deserved to be don't tase me bro.

308
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,656
Scott: Don't tase me bro.

309
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:37,539
Rym: Don't tase me, bro.

310
00:22:38,881 --> 00:22:44,700
Rym: Well of course the internet responded and like the internet does there were a whole bunch of mashups.

311
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,140
Rym: I think there's one on dig that was just MC hammer dancing.

312
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:55,766
Rym: But every time you would have said can't touch this it cut to the guy saying don't tase me And things like that.

313
00:22:56,107 --> 00:22:56,588
Scott: don't tase me.

314
00:22:56,729 --> 00:23:05,473
Rym: of all of those there's one that stood out and I awarded the Lateral thinking mashup award of the week alrighty.

315
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:07,900
Rym: I don't think this will be a regular thing.

316
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:09,805
Rym: It is basically.

317
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:23,100
Rym: I mean you could just watch the video, but in case you don't want to it's just that scene from Star Wars Where the Emperor shocks the ever-living shit out of Luke and all it does is dub over Luke's dialogue with don't tase me, bro.

318
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:24,154
Rym: Don't tase me, bro.

319
00:23:24,356 --> 00:23:28,106
Scott: Seriously Only now at the end.

320
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:30,254
Rym: do you want us to understand?

321
00:23:30,615 --> 00:23:32,120
Rym: It's just it's too perfect.

322
00:23:32,722 --> 00:23:35,210
Rym: I mean in general it seems like there's sort of this.

323
00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:42,738
Rym: like people talk about lateral thinking and lateral thinking puzzles We're like how do you get out of the room if the doors are all locked and blah blah blah blah blah?

324
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:46,233
Rym: and the answer Is something weird kind of like a Buddhist riddle or a cone.

325
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:47,720
Scott: or how do you make a mashup at it?

326
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,543
Scott: Don't tase me, bro.

327
00:23:48,563 --> 00:23:50,874
Scott: That'll make all the nerds laugh up Star Wars.

328
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:51,618
Scott: There's the one.

329
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:55,753
Rym: well It seems like internet people particularly Farkers and 4-channers.

330
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:57,860
Rym: There's all those different cultures on the internet.

331
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:03,614
Rym: There are connections between events that happen and various things in popular culture.

332
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:07,647
Rym: that and it's perfectly obvious To the internet person who thinks of it.

333
00:24:07,687 --> 00:24:20,580
Rym: they see a video of a guy being tasered and the first thing they think is That's just like when the Emperor tasered Luke Make that mashup while normal people they don't think sideways like that that the thought wouldn't even cross their mind.

334
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,580
Scott: But if they see it they go oh shit.

335
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:30,719
Rym: I feel like YouTube and Fark and 4chan something awful in all these places internet culture.

336
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:41,480
Rym: They're kind of Fostering this environment where the lateral thinking is rewarded And I'm really curious to see how that is going to affect art and literature over the next decade.

337
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:46,127
Rym: I think it's actually going to be a significant movement Possibly in a bad direction.

338
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:49,740
Scott: Yeah, I think the problem though with lateral thinking is that forward thinking suffers.

339
00:24:52,362 --> 00:24:53,728
Rym: That was that was very aptly put.

340
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:54,953
Rym: you get a golf clap.

341
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:56,059
Scott: all right all right.

342
00:24:56,822 --> 00:24:59,674
Scott: So you know a rice paddy.

343
00:24:59,694 --> 00:25:01,040
Scott: you ever seen a rice paddy?

344
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:03,607
Rym: You mean a place where rice is grown.

345
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:04,330
Scott: Yeah, you know.

346
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,680
Scott: you know how it's arranged like the rice is all in rows.

347
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,464
Scott: Yeah, right.

348
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:10,700
Scott: Have you ever seen the actual rice plant?

349
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,587
Rym: I've seen pictures of them on like Wikipedia.

350
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:14,751
Scott: Yeah, what's it look like?

351
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,980
Rym: looks like a plant in water.

352
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:20,060
Scott: Yeah, so you know there's different kinds of rice, right?

353
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,472
Rym: Yeah, there's like jasmine rice and brown rice and various other rices.

354
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:25,154
Scott: Well.

355
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:25,956
Scott: Did you know that?

356
00:25:26,117 --> 00:25:27,120
Rym: Honda civic yep?

357
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,538
Scott: Well, you know the red rice.

358
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:30,646
Scott: You know the leaves of the red rice plant.

359
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:34,277
Scott: they're sort of dark and the leaves of the normal rice plant.

360
00:25:34,477 --> 00:25:35,220
Scott: They're sort of green.

361
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:43,900
Scott: So what if you are planting rice in these rows and you strategically place red rice and normal?

362
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:51,995
Scott: Green rice in such a way that From above your rice paddy looks like something because you have multiple colors to work with.

363
00:25:52,797 --> 00:25:55,065
Rym: I think if someone did that That'd be pretty damn cool.

364
00:25:55,146 --> 00:25:57,877
Rym: I wonder if anyone's uh done anything like that.

365
00:25:57,897 --> 00:26:01,231
Scott: gee I wonder what all these pictures of people have done that are.

366
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:03,560
Scott: huh how interesting are these pictures from like?

367
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,289
Scott: Helicopters of rice patties with pictures on them.

368
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,857
Scott: They're actually like you think.

369
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:12,120
Scott: okay someone You know wrote something in the rice paddy or made a picture.

370
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:15,000
Scott: You know it'll be about the quality of say like a crop circle.

371
00:26:15,582 --> 00:26:18,471
Scott: This is way better quality than you think it is.

372
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:23,718
Scott: rice is a small plant high resolution Imagery and lots and lots of like.

373
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:30,760
Scott: you know Bored Japanese people who got a lot of time on their hands to get it just right and they do it every year.

374
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,080
Scott: They've had practice, and they've got all season to wait for it to grow.

375
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,966
Scott: So they're not gonna screw it up when they plant it.

376
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:39,960
Rym: wow so uh a crappy somewhat poorly done crop circle.

377
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,178
Rym: Obviously no human technology could create that and it had to have been done by an advanced alien race.

378
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,898
Rym: yet Yet this high-resolution rice images piece of cake.

379
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:55,000
Scott: yes There's this high-resolution picture of like a geisha for that appears from the sky in a rice paddy, huh?

380
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,106
Scott: Yeah, yeah that made by aliens.

381
00:26:57,147 --> 00:27:04,300
Scott: They came down with their laser guns and drew it in the rice In Japan by changing the colors of the leaves.

382
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:13,540
Rym: I just saw this one As a kid where there was like there was a crop circle and the crop circle expert was like see how these are bent.

383
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:15,508
Rym: There's no way you could do that without.

384
00:27:15,528 --> 00:27:20,140
Scott: and then a guy took a stick in a rope and made the no not even then I saw the one with the stick in the rose like that.

385
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:29,297
Rym: But it was the guy as an expert and he just took our stock and he Bent it like bit right in front of the guy, and it looked exactly the same Yep, and the guy was like well different.

386
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,366
Scott: No the one I saw was like God.

387
00:27:31,386 --> 00:27:32,952
Scott: they were like look see how though it's.

388
00:27:33,072 --> 00:27:34,457
Scott: it's in a spiral right.

389
00:27:34,517 --> 00:27:36,580
Scott: so the guy's like That is kind of strange.

390
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,363
Scott: It's in a spiral.

391
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:41,700
Scott: if something landed on it from above it would just been flattened straight down instead of in a spiral.

392
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:44,774
Scott: So it had to be some sort of spinning alien ship right.

393
00:27:45,176 --> 00:27:53,344
Scott: so some other guy goes Uh-huh, and he takes a stick and a rope and he sort of holds on to the rope puts the stick under his foot And he walks.

394
00:27:53,866 --> 00:28:03,060
Scott: he starts somewhere in the crop, and he just starts walking in a circle Crushing the corn with the stick on his foot, and it makes a spiral circle of crushed.

395
00:28:03,622 --> 00:28:04,647
Rym: I think the moral is.

396
00:28:04,707 --> 00:28:19,227
Scott: anyone who thinks crop circles are made by aliens is stupid Yep, yep, and anyone who thinks high-resolution rice paddy images are made by Now people in America Was only Japanese people could do.

397
00:28:19,268 --> 00:28:26,998
Rym: I think the only logical conclusion of this is to make a rice paddy representation of a Honda Civic Thus blowing up the earth.

398
00:28:27,963 --> 00:28:35,839
Scott: Sure, I think we need to make a rice paddy image of the Emperor shocking some guy The don't see our death star.

399
00:28:36,906 --> 00:28:38,637
Scott: Go see go see rice paddy.

400
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:39,100
Scott: Oh my god.

401
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:40,784
Scott: No, we had to get.

402
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,999
Scott: no we just need a picture of a plain rice paddy, and then we need to Photoshop it.

403
00:28:45,582 --> 00:28:47,574
Rym: Oh that could be but I'd rather have the permanence.

404
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:50,971
Rym: well not permanent I guess because the rice isn't gonna be there forever.

405
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:52,136
Rym: Yep, right.

406
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:56,330
Rym: so tonight I realize this is a topic a lot of people ask us about.

407
00:28:56,351 --> 00:29:01,373
Rym: you know that they get some spyware on their machine or Something's wrong with their computer, and they ask us ribbon Scott.

408
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:02,700
Rym: How could I get rid of this virus now?

409
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,710
Rym: Can I not get viruses in the future?

410
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,540
Rym: and no one seems to understand?

411
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,988
Rym: What viruses and Trojans and all those things actually are?

412
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:12,038
Rym: and even worse people don't seem to like the answers we give?

413
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:13,747
Scott: no They don't seem to like the answers.

414
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:15,458
Scott: you want to talk about what they are first or it's like what.

415
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:23,574
Rym: yeah well, I think the purpose of this episode very specifically is to Prevent more people from emailing us the same questions over and over again.

416
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:24,316
Scott: all right cool all right.

417
00:29:24,336 --> 00:29:26,996
Scott: so first question What is well?

418
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,400
Scott: I think the biggest see the problem is the definitions of words like virus and Trojan and malware and spyware.

419
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,283
Scott: Is that there's.

420
00:29:33,323 --> 00:29:34,888
Scott: some of them are subsets of others.

421
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:38,339
Scott: some of them are not the same as others and there's quite a bit of.

422
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:43,458
Scott: It's not like big disagreements like everyone sort of generally agrees what they are, but there's not like this.

423
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:43,840
Scott: firm.

424
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:44,927
Scott: This means this.

425
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:52,920
Scott: this means that yeah, we're gonna give a broad Yeah, I'm gonna mostly give you what I think slightly combined with what Wikipedia thinks at the current moment in time.

426
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:58,139
Scott: So the first one I think the largest category it personally is malware.

427
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:03,320
Rym: Yes I mean people say oh spyware whatever where I think it all is classified as malware.

428
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:04,923
Scott: Yeah I mean malware.

429
00:30:05,063 --> 00:30:08,452
Scott: mal is bad Latin root where software.

430
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:14,811
Scott: if you have some sort of software that is bad Be it spyware a virus a Trojan a worm.

431
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:16,697
Scott: It's all malware.

432
00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:19,750
Scott: It's all bad Where simple is that okay?

433
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:26,502
Rym: I just couldn't help thinking like malware wolf Malware wolf Plus.

434
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,588
Scott: some lateral thinking you got going on.

435
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:32,700
Rym: believe that the word where originally was a root that meant man.

436
00:30:33,021 --> 00:30:35,209
Rym: So theoretically malware could you?

437
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,237
Rym: you are very malware.

438
00:30:37,257 --> 00:30:42,368
Rym: it could be like and Very bad, man, bro.

439
00:30:43,011 --> 00:30:44,557
Scott: I'm trying to combine like and throw up and virus.

440
00:30:44,638 --> 00:30:46,559
Scott: It's not working anyway.

441
00:30:47,901 --> 00:30:53,040
Rym: So the next thing well that we should define malware very how I would define malware?

442
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,783
Rym: Just straight up.

443
00:30:54,185 --> 00:31:06,374
Rym: I mean you obviously probably think oh, I know what malware is is any Code that is on a PC that does things that the owner of the PC would not Intend it or know about it doing.

444
00:31:06,394 --> 00:31:10,050
Scott: yeah Anything that's bad anything you don't want yeah any.

445
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,277
Rym: I mean I consider DRM to be malware.

446
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,183
Scott: Oh, yeah, definitely Anything.

447
00:31:14,363 --> 00:31:15,366
Scott: yep all right.

448
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:18,254
Scott: so a virus a virus.

449
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:25,306
Scott: I sort of say that like you know every Viruses is pretty much everything, but like spyware It's sort of like it's on it.

450
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:30,789
Scott: first thing about a virus that makes it different from say spyware Is that you didn't put it there.

451
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,514
Scott: it got put there on.

452
00:31:32,534 --> 00:31:34,400
Scott: it doesn't announce its presence.

453
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:35,466
Scott: It's not like you see it.

454
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:38,200
Rym: Yeah viruses are the oldest form of this sort of thing.

455
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:49,738
Scott: yeah, a virus will be like you got an infected file and You you know it attached itself somewhere, and it's running and doing things without you knowing perhaps replicating itself.

456
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:55,657
Scott: in fact some people say it must replicate itself for it to be a virus and it spreads to other files and it infects.

457
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,251
Rym: I Wrote a few very weak viruses when I was in high school.

458
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,300
Rym: Yeah, mostly to steal documents from my friends.

459
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:12,054
Rym: Examples of viruses would be like that Michelangelo virus yep or form or the ogre oh the Monster.

460
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:15,099
Rym: that was a real virus Jabberwocky yep.

461
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:21,859
Rym: And a lot of them are really kind of benign and funny and a lot of them are really really bad like the ogre Which just encrypted your hard drive?

462
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,703
Scott: Yeah But it's basically a program.

463
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,005
Scott: That's probably doing something evil.

464
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:34,705
Scott: it spreads around from file to file generally and You didn't put it there.

465
00:32:34,725 --> 00:32:39,657
Scott: it sort of crept in somehow usually maybe on a floppy disk or on a CD.

466
00:32:39,677 --> 00:32:46,020
Scott: or you Downloaded something and it was infected or someone gave it to you who knows.

467
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:50,876
Scott: So a worm a worm is a little is kind of similar to a virus.

468
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:51,880
Scott: It's a little hidden thing.

469
00:32:51,920 --> 00:33:00,617
Scott: You didn't even know it's there, and it's doing bad stuff, but worms specifically Replicate over the network, and you don't have to do anything.

470
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,990
Scott: if your computer Just plugged into a network a worm can just walk right in.

471
00:33:04,472 --> 00:33:06,800
Scott: like what was that one that happened when you're on IT?

472
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,167
Scott: That was huge like the Natchez or the?

473
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,592
Rym: I don't even remember.

474
00:33:10,732 --> 00:33:11,173
Rym: you know cuz.

475
00:33:11,474 --> 00:33:14,969
Rym: it's not a concern to be anymore to be honest but it basically what.

476
00:33:14,989 --> 00:33:16,719
Scott: the how the how that worm spread is.

477
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:24,380
Scott: Windows has security vulnerability in it and you could Send some packets to a Windows machine that was not patched.

478
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:41,211
Scott: And if you sent those packets to the Windows machine properly the Windows machine would open itself up Copy move some bits around on its hard drive and thus cause it to do some bad things as well as begin spreading this virus to other windows.

479
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:48,915
Rym: the worm to other windows machines is a big deal because Standard viruses and Trojans and things they can't really spread themselves.

480
00:33:49,076 --> 00:33:50,440
Rym: an idiot has to spread them.

481
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,680
Rym: But a worm can get you without you doing anything.

482
00:33:52,861 --> 00:33:52,961
Rym: you

483
00:33:52,981 --> 00:34:10,020
Scott: could just have a computer brand new from Dell say right Windows installed Windows patched all the way and if there is a Vulnerability to some sort of worm on that you know in Windows at the current time And you just plug it into a network and another computer on that network is spreading the fire at the worm.

484
00:34:10,643 --> 00:34:11,047
Scott: You got it.

485
00:34:11,268 --> 00:34:12,799
Scott: It's on there, and now you're spreading the worm.

486
00:34:13,523 --> 00:34:14,206
Scott: I mean a worm.

487
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:19,411
Scott: the thing is with a worm even if it doesn't do anything bad to your computer It takes up network bandwidth.

488
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:21,502
Scott: It's it's automatically bad No matter what.

489
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:27,460
Rym: well, and it's it'll probably eventually especially now with the current culture of hackers out there or crackers.

490
00:34:28,643 --> 00:34:31,935
Rym: Yeah Yeah, is that you'll be spamming people with Viagra?

491
00:34:32,378 --> 00:34:32,800
Scott: probably?

492
00:34:33,384 --> 00:34:37,956
Scott: But yeah most worms just infect your computer And then they most worms and viruses and everything.

493
00:34:37,996 --> 00:34:42,620
Scott: these days The vast majority of them try to turn your computer into a spam sending machine.

494
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:47,152
Scott: So all right I guess the other one we could talk about is a Trojan.

495
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,320
Scott: a Trojan a Trojan.

496
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:50,909
Scott: It's a lot like.

497
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:59,840
Scott: I don't know why I was saying Trojan Is a lot like well a Trojan horse from the Greek story of old where you know a wooden bunny is driven up.

498
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:09,543
Rym: You know you get an email From your mom's and sister's uncle's friends nephews cousin, and it says hey check out this funny flash video file Exe.

499
00:35:09,623 --> 00:35:12,230
Rym: so you double click on it, and you see a funny flash video.

500
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:15,499
Rym: well that funny flash video executable was you know?

501
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,480
Rym: 400k of flash followed by four megabytes of malware.

502
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:20,885
Scott: Yeah, it's you know.

503
00:35:20,905 --> 00:35:37,717
Scott: you go and someone gives you something or someone appears to be giving you something that Disguises itself as a picture or a video or a video game or something and you click on it, and you say yes Yes, yes, yes, yes, and you've just opened a horse and a whole bunch of Greeks jumped out and stabbed you

504
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:38,580
Rym: right.

505
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:41,294
Rym: But that's enough of that because we've talked about some of these things before.

506
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:42,580
Scott: I think that about covers.

507
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,146
Scott: El spyware is the only one left.

508
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,310
Scott: do we have to say something about?

509
00:35:45,431 --> 00:35:46,997
Scott: yeah spyware is sort of.

510
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:54,006
Scott: you went there was it's this piece of software usually free and You went and you got it.

511
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:55,350
Scott: You knew what you were getting like.

512
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:55,651
Scott: hey.

513
00:35:55,772 --> 00:35:56,755
Scott: I need a video player.

514
00:35:57,036 --> 00:35:58,160
Scott: There's a video player.

515
00:35:58,502 --> 00:36:02,380
Scott: I will download this video player and install it and sure enough it plays video.

516
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,423
Scott: Maybe not well, but it's a program that does what you thought like Bonsai buddy.

517
00:36:07,483 --> 00:36:21,070
Scott: right it gives you a little funny bonsai buddy on your desktop, but in the meantime It's also looking at information on your computer and sending it to someone else far away So that they can make money off of you.

518
00:36:21,131 --> 00:36:23,000
Rym: I mean Gator did whatever it claimed to do.

519
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,974
Scott: I don't even know I think it like helps you remember passwords.

520
00:36:25,994 --> 00:36:27,060
Rym: Yeah, that's awesome.

521
00:36:28,462 --> 00:36:34,240
Rym: The deal with these is that if you actually read all like what it tells you when you install it They don't pretend at all.

522
00:36:34,262 --> 00:36:37,431
Rym: I mean It's like we are going to take your data and do this and this and this.

523
00:36:37,451 --> 00:36:43,855
Scott: we're also probably gonna use your CPU cycles to Conduct evil business maybe and while it's shady you agreed to it.

524
00:36:44,216 --> 00:36:45,200
Rym: you put it on there.

525
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,010
Scott: Yeah, some things don't say they're spyware like you know it's.

526
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:51,967
Rym: it's not obvious that it's by where you almost in that case You wouldn't call it spyware.

527
00:36:51,987 --> 00:36:53,860
Rym: You just call it a virus straight up.

528
00:36:53,900 --> 00:37:05,535
Scott: It's sort of difficult to always like to really accurately label like large groups of malware because you know There's there's two components to any malware, and that is the vector and what it is.

529
00:37:05,596 --> 00:37:06,560
Scott: you know like you could have.

530
00:37:07,423 --> 00:37:12,806
Scott: You know the worm has the network as the vector, but once it's installed It's kind of like a virus.

531
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:21,995
Scott: or you know spyware is like using a trojan vector But once it's installed you just installed software that had a trojan style vector of infection.

532
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:29,240
Rym: before we get to the next part Which I think is the part you all want to hear about I would like to say one thing and this is kind of important.

533
00:37:29,743 --> 00:37:34,319
Rym: the plural of the word virus is viruses.

534
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,524
Scott: Really straight up.

535
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:37,708
Scott: There's fire.

536
00:37:37,728 --> 00:37:39,554
Rym: I know it's not fire.

537
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:41,300
Scott: I I gotta look this up now.

538
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:44,065
Rym: I I am a hundred percent I'll bet you without.

539
00:37:44,085 --> 00:37:51,416
Rym: well actually it's more complicated than that because the word virus Really doesn't have a plural and it never did because the original word.

540
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,542
Rym: I think it meant like Venom.

541
00:37:53,683 --> 00:38:04,716
Scott: all right according to the Wikipedia in the English language the standard plural of virus is Viruses the most frequently occurring form of the plural and refers to both the biological virus and a computer virus.

542
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:18,324
Scott: well the less frequent Variations viri and viri are wrong because the word viri means like man or vitality are virtually unknown in edited prose and no major dictionary recognizes them as Alternative form.

543
00:38:18,424 --> 00:38:22,380
Rym: the reason is if you I mean Latin had many more sort.

544
00:38:22,722 --> 00:38:26,180
Rym: I'm not gonna get into this because it's complicated if you don't know about language at all.

545
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:33,347
Rym: But basically Latin had a lot more ways of writing words or declining words or Conjugating words things like that.

546
00:38:33,788 --> 00:38:35,313
Rym: so you had a lot of different ways.

547
00:38:35,353 --> 00:38:46,928
Rym: you could write the same word depending on the context It was being used and there were different rules depending on the root word as to how you pluralize things or past tense things like I made the phrase past tense.

548
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:50,135
Scott: Yeah, I like how alumnus becomes alumni.

549
00:38:50,196 --> 00:38:54,230
Scott: so virus you think you would become Viri but no virus isn't the same route.

550
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,479
Scott: nope, but you know what sheep become sheep eye.

551
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:04,120
Rym: Yeah, basically the the plural is virus and this was drilled into my head.

552
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,229
Rym: This is a computer.

553
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,640
Rym: yeah viruses of virus.

554
00:39:06,922 --> 00:39:13,252
Rym: This was drilled into my head by more than one professor at RIT Continuously, and it's kind of a pet peeve of mine.

555
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:23,612
Rym: and while you can argue about a lot of other words There is really no academic source in the world and no credible source in the world that pluralizes Viruses virus as viri.

556
00:39:23,774 --> 00:39:24,760
Scott: Yeah, it's viruses.

557
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:26,144
Rym: So the.

558
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:29,300
Rym: the important thing about this episode is what we're gonna talk about next though.

559
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,519
Rym: Cuz this is what you want to hear and this is what people ask us the most.

560
00:39:32,224 --> 00:39:32,305
Rym: It.

561
00:39:32,728 --> 00:39:34,540
Rym: the second part of this is how do I get rid of them?

562
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,349
Scott: We're mostly gonna be repeating like one sentence over and over.

563
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:38,513
Rym: Yeah, first and foremost.

564
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:40,600
Rym: How do you protect yourself from viruses?

565
00:39:40,701 --> 00:39:42,231
Rym: We're not gonna talk about the history.

566
00:39:42,472 --> 00:39:43,680
Rym: We're not gonna talk about the past.

567
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,666
Rym: We're gonna talk about right now today.

568
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,090
Rym: How do you avoid viruses.

569
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,915
Scott: step one step one?

570
00:39:49,517 --> 00:40:01,851
Scott: You need either a software firewall of some sort on your machine or Some sort of network level protection a NAT router Just a normal router that you buy at the store a linksys router.

571
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:06,740
Scott: if you plug it in and use it and it you get A connection by default it is protecting you.

572
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:14,190
Scott: You cannot get a worm if you are using a router Unless someone else in your house is spreading the worm.

573
00:40:14,531 --> 00:40:15,896
Rym: Well, there is an exception to that.

574
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:22,052
Rym: if you use if you have that Plug-and-play whatever that automatically do not enable universal plug-in play.

575
00:40:22,092 --> 00:40:23,736
Scott: Do not enable UP NP.

576
00:40:24,037 --> 00:40:25,039
Scott: Do not turn that on.

577
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:36,319
Rym: Yes That is theoretically useful but what it actually does is let your computer if it gets compromised at all or if your router gets Compromised a virus or a worm could just open up your router and let stuff.

578
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:41,957
Scott: Yes See the purpose of UP NP, you know We always talk about port forwarding and how you have to kind of like figure out what ports to enable.

579
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:44,325
Scott: and kind of tricky UP NP does that automatically.

580
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:49,562
Scott: UP NP basically makes it so that let's say iTunes wants to open up a port so we can do Something.

581
00:40:49,984 --> 00:40:53,699
Scott: it lets it be smart enough to do it on its own bit torrent actually uses UP NP.

582
00:40:54,344 --> 00:40:59,140
Scott: And you said you don't have to do your MIT You don't have to figure out the port forwarding to be ready for most things.

583
00:40:59,361 --> 00:41:07,160
Rym: You don't need to forward ports at all because the way NAT works Almost anything a normal person is going to do on a PC does not require port forwarding then that just works.

584
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:13,521
Scott: So don't enable UP NP unless you really know what you do and don't enable port forwarding unless you know what you're doing And why.

585
00:41:13,903 --> 00:41:25,940
Scott: and then if you don't if you do those things and you have a router or software firewall like the zone alarm or something No one can get you with a worm unless they bring the worm into your house on like a laptop or something, right?

586
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:32,752
Rym: So you might say well Rym and Scott, that's well and good But how do I avoid getting spyware and malware and viruses and all everything else?

587
00:41:32,832 --> 00:41:41,400
Rym: and the answer is and I can't stress this enough Don't use Internet Explorer which will say shield you already from like 80% of what's out there.

588
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,935
Rym: Yeah, and to don't click on shit if you don't know what it is.

589
00:41:46,317 --> 00:41:48,486
Scott: Don't trust Anything.

590
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,038
Rym: if your mom if you don't file don't open it.

591
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,379
Scott: Yep, unless it's a picture if you are looking for like say an image editing program or something.

592
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,045
Scott: Maybe that's not.

593
00:41:58,085 --> 00:41:58,989
Scott: that's a bad example.

594
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:02,120
Scott: Let's say you're looking for an mp3 playing program.

595
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,559
Scott: You just want to try a new one, right?

596
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,690
Scott: So you're going on to the internet and you find a new one.

597
00:42:06,213 --> 00:42:12,785
Scott: unless you can confirm Without any doubts that it is not spyware Do not download it.

598
00:42:12,885 --> 00:42:14,830
Scott: assume everything is spyware.

599
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:20,314
Scott: assume if you go on Pirate Bay and there's a pirated version of a game Assume that it's full of viruses.

600
00:42:20,355 --> 00:42:21,502
Rym: until proven otherwise You know what?

601
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:23,531
Rym: The answer is it almost always is full of ours.

602
00:42:23,552 --> 00:42:28,660
Scott: if you're going to download a movie on BitTorrent assume it's full of viruses.

603
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:37,180
Rym: Well, here's the thing that the real answer is do not execute Any file executable or not that you get from the internet from an untrusted source?

604
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:46,559
Rym: Some files don't need to be executed and because software is robust It's very difficult for looking at a JPEG file or looking at it.

605
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,606
Scott: But it's happened.

606
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:48,230
Scott: there were.

607
00:42:48,250 --> 00:43:06,771
Rym: there were bugs with like Wmf files and there is stuff like that, but things like that are pretty rare and you can avoid 98% of viruses if you just don't run exe files or bin files or .scr files or .bat or .com files.

608
00:43:06,831 --> 00:43:07,112
Rym: Yep.

609
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:09,800
Rym: Luckily .bat you can just open it and look at what it's doing.

610
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,791
Scott: I know I know but most people won't understand it.

611
00:43:11,811 --> 00:43:15,040
Scott: They'll open it up into the same gibberish They'll get if they open up an exe file.

612
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,899
Rym: Yeah, but - I mean if you go to a website and you are you're using ie.

613
00:43:20,522 --> 00:43:28,460
Rym: There are a lot of exploits especially for pre 7 versions of ie Where you don't have to click on anything and you'll just be infected because you went to the website.

614
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:39,496
Scott: Yep Even so if you whenever you're browsing the web even with Firefox even with ie 7 even with opera Right and you go to a website and it says would you like to do something?

615
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:39,818
Scott: Yes.

616
00:43:39,898 --> 00:43:51,388
Scott: No unless you are 1020% sure that you're at the absolute correct website and that you want to do what it is asking you to do And you know what it's about to do.

617
00:43:52,031 --> 00:43:56,751
Scott: say no always Never say yes Unless you are a million percent sure.

618
00:43:56,771 --> 00:44:01,894
Scott: because if you say yes And it's good as you start doing something evil and then you're done game over.

619
00:44:02,155 --> 00:44:03,459
Rym: Yep, and that's it.

620
00:44:04,004 --> 00:44:11,079
Rym: It's just don't use ie Have a net firewall don't go to shady sites and download things and then run them.

621
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,308
Scott: Yeah, don't go to shady websites period.

622
00:44:13,328 --> 00:44:19,252
Scott: I mean someone said safe Google safe leak Dudes where's calm not safe.

623
00:44:19,373 --> 00:44:19,996
Scott: Don't go there.

624
00:44:20,096 --> 00:44:25,200
Rym: Don't do anything there Don't trust anything and if you're gonna go there at least use Firefox or something.

625
00:44:25,481 --> 00:44:26,749
Rym: Hopefully don't don't.

626
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:36,780
Rym: not being on Windows is a huge help But even if you're on Windows You'll be reasonably safe if you use Firefox or the equivalent and you're generally canny about what you click and don't click on.

627
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:50,000
Scott: Yeah, if you are smart and you don't trust if you are Untrust giving enough and you are so good like me that you never install anything stupid You do not need an antivirus program.

628
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,317
Scott: they're just going to waste your system resources.

629
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:59,706
Scott: an Antivirus program can only help you if you're stupid and you try to install viruses And they will tell you yours.

630
00:44:59,746 --> 00:45:02,937
Rym: they're useful if you gave this computer to your mom now.

631
00:45:02,977 --> 00:45:14,561
Scott: That's also useful Yes, but if you are smart And you do not let shit get on your computer like I'm right I'm using Windows a lot lately to play Team Fortress 2 so I'm browsing the web on it And I'm.

632
00:45:14,702 --> 00:45:16,089
Scott: I am and on it and stuff like that.

633
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:17,717
Scott: right no problems.

634
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:22,455
Scott: No Antivirus I'm behind in that router so worm can't get in and I don't.

635
00:45:22,816 --> 00:45:23,900
Scott: I keep the computer up to date.

636
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:28,880
Scott: I always do all the windows updates on Black Tuesday, and I don't click on stupid shit.

637
00:45:29,262 --> 00:45:31,293
Scott: And so far the computers like new.

638
00:45:31,534 --> 00:45:36,440
Rym: as far as Windows is concerned Three viruses or malwares in my entire life.

639
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:43,502
Rym: The first one was the form virus that I got from a diskette that I borrowed from someone in Starbase when I was in middle School.

640
00:45:43,582 --> 00:45:45,050
Rym: Wow and you know what.

641
00:45:45,673 --> 00:45:52,050
Rym: and once I realized I had it I didn't get rid of it because it didn't do anything bad And I started collecting viruses as a result and somewhere.

642
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,940
Rym: I still have a bunch of floppy disks with old like DOS viruses.

643
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,626
Rym: Yeah, the second one.

644
00:45:56,686 --> 00:46:02,507
Rym: I got was I don't remember, but I remember I got a virus at some point It was like in the early days of spyware.

645
00:46:03,069 --> 00:46:03,811
Rym: and the third one.

646
00:46:03,851 --> 00:46:10,010
Rym: I got was when I rebuilt this new computer I installed windows and downloaded a bunch of wares as a test.

647
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:17,580
Rym: I determined that every single piece of pirated software I downloaded contained viruses, and then I reformatted and reinstalled windows.

648
00:46:18,621 --> 00:46:29,240
Scott: The only time I ever got a virus and knew about it was back in the in the days like I guess like 2002 3 ish when like the crazy worms are going around the internet fucking everything up.

649
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:31,058
Scott: Oh, yeah, not she and everything right?

650
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,518
Scott: Coincidentally at that time without even me thinking about it right we were at RIT.

651
00:46:36,618 --> 00:46:40,111
Scott: obviously I rebuilt my computer because it was just that time.

652
00:46:40,151 --> 00:46:41,054
Scott: you know I knew I was doing it.

653
00:46:41,496 --> 00:46:46,000
Scott: so I reinstalled windows I connected to the network and I started doing windows updates pretty much immediately.

654
00:46:46,543 --> 00:46:56,175
Rym: But the crazy worm was spreading around the network so fast between when Scott rebooted after installing windows and when he clicked windows update to get the patch.

655
00:46:56,475 --> 00:46:57,699
Rym: he was already infected.

656
00:46:57,879 --> 00:47:03,280
Scott: and then Like the next day RIT kicked me off the network as I was spreading the worm, and I was because RIT is smart.

657
00:47:04,401 --> 00:47:05,347
Rym: It'll go too long for that.

658
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:06,575
Scott: I didn't even realize I had it.

659
00:47:06,595 --> 00:47:07,360
Scott: It was so fast.

660
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,453
Scott: Yeah, there was no way I could have gotten it that fast.

661
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,620
Scott: No I got it that fast.

662
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:19,080
Rym: It's too much for this show, but in a future show some months from now We'll probably do one on like corporate security and corporate virus dealing because it's a total different ballgame in that world.

663
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,999
Rym: But yeah RIT is one of the few entities that is smart about it.

664
00:47:22,482 --> 00:47:25,420
Scott: So if you're not dumb you're not thinking happen to your computer.

665
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:31,860
Scott: And if you are dumb you need an anti-virus to back you up when you're dumb But even then it's not gonna help you a hundred percent.

666
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:35,092
Scott: They're not perfect so and they're gonna make your computer slower and crappier.

667
00:47:35,212 --> 00:47:40,260
Rym: the final question that we get all the time is Rym and Scott I was dumb and I got a virus or whatever.

668
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:45,920
Rym: How do I get rid of it and forget the past in the present the current state of the world?

669
00:47:46,720 --> 00:48:03,600
Rym: The real answer is you cannot because due to root kits and the way modern viruses work Once a computer has ever been compromised you can never ever Trust that that computer is wholly free of compromises again for the rest of its life unless you reformat and reinstall.

670
00:48:03,722 --> 00:48:04,838
Scott: Yeah, I mean you can trust it.

671
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:06,267
Scott: You know to do some things.

672
00:48:06,287 --> 00:48:13,620
Scott: they can trust it to go to dig and to load dig properly But you can never a hundred percent trust that software on that machine ever again.

673
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,383
Scott: You can always.

674
00:48:14,664 --> 00:48:16,933
Scott: you know it might be sending all your personal information out.

675
00:48:16,993 --> 00:48:17,917
Scott: It might be key logging.

676
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:18,700
Scott: you have no idea.

677
00:48:19,081 --> 00:48:20,085
Scott: There's no way to know.

678
00:48:20,145 --> 00:48:28,330
Scott: I mean your spy bots and your you know ad-awares work Very poorly compared to the way they use your clam av.

679
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:33,820
Scott: you can clean the computer up to a certain degree Using tools, and if you're really lucky.

680
00:48:34,782 --> 00:48:45,360
Scott: You know maybe you only got one little virus, and you happen to have a tool That's really good at getting rid of that virus, and it may it might make you perfectly clean But there's no way to know you're perfectly clean.

681
00:48:46,102 --> 00:48:47,025
Scott: No way to know.

682
00:48:47,065 --> 00:48:51,972
Rym: you can monitor your traffic for months and months and run all these things and if you see anything you Can prove.

683
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:52,178
Rym: yep?

684
00:48:52,400 --> 00:49:00,764
Rym: I was still infected But you can never be sure about that computer again, so if you care about your data at all if you've ever been infected Back your shit up.

685
00:49:00,925 --> 00:49:02,030
Rym: and when I say back your shit up.

686
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:08,480
Scott: I mean back up non executable files Yeah, back up your mp3s and your JPEGs and whatever and that's it back.

687
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:10,057
Scott: It looks like DVDs or something.

688
00:49:10,178 --> 00:49:14,031
Rym: any Program on your computer is suspect for the rest of that computer's life.

689
00:49:14,071 --> 00:49:29,008
Scott: until you reinstall and then even when you you know back Up all those files make sure that after you reinstall You know before touching any of those files you mount you sort of get them in on a read-only Basis and you scan them with every fucking scan thing.

690
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,254
Scott: you have to make sure that there's nothing attached to them.

691
00:49:31,274 --> 00:49:34,986
Rym: because I see the answer Is reinstall.

692
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:36,893
Rym: that's the only way to know and I'm sad.

693
00:49:37,013 --> 00:49:37,535
Rym: and that's it.

694
00:49:37,656 --> 00:49:40,865
Rym: and in a corporate environment That's the only solution.

695
00:49:40,926 --> 00:49:54,080
Scott: imaging yeah, if you're infected fuck you your computer's gone Yep, so if you actually something I recommend to to make it You know like I'm at the point where I do a lot of my stuff on the web I use Google for as much as possible.

696
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:54,763
Scott: You know it really.

697
00:49:54,783 --> 00:50:02,380
Scott: it used to really matter like being at school on the school computer Sucked because all my stuff was on my computer at home on my hard drive.

698
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,635
Rym: You know I carried a zip disk around and I had my next Samba shares.

699
00:50:05,655 --> 00:50:06,780
Rym: that worked most of the time.

700
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:09,108
Rym: It wasn't good enough nowadays.

701
00:50:09,449 --> 00:50:11,255
Scott: do as much as you can on the web.

702
00:50:11,857 --> 00:50:12,840
Scott: use a thumb drive.

703
00:50:13,262 --> 00:50:14,467
Scott: You know have a laptop.

704
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:20,610
Scott: that helps, but you know and that way it doesn't really matter What computer you're at or what operating system?

705
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:21,071
Scott: It's running.

706
00:50:21,111 --> 00:50:23,680
Scott: as long as you have a web browser and a connection to the internet.

707
00:50:24,103 --> 00:50:26,216
Scott: It's like I'm at home almost no matter where I am.

708
00:50:26,236 --> 00:50:26,820
Scott: I mean at home.

709
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,266
Scott: I'm still slightly more at home.

710
00:50:28,286 --> 00:50:30,575
Rym: I mean theoretically if I go to any computer.

711
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:31,680
Rym: I've got steam.

712
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,700
Rym: I could just get all my steam games anywhere and play them.

713
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:41,337
Scott: Yeah, I mean like if I used to be like when I had to reformat was like God I have to reinstall all those applications.

714
00:50:41,397 --> 00:50:48,368
Scott: now I I'm like using a clean install of Windows with Firefox And it's as good as me being in my Linux.

715
00:50:48,609 --> 00:50:56,671
Rym: whatever my windows has all the windows updates the drivers for my shit Firefox the acrobat reader and steam and those are the only pieces of.

716
00:50:56,711 --> 00:50:59,540
Rym: so I have audacity for backup emergency, but I've never used it.

717
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:09,008
Scott: Yeah, so if you sort of arrange yourself into a position where you are not reliant on Sort of desktop applications you can like.

718
00:51:09,429 --> 00:51:14,410
Scott: I could like reformat the windows today, and it's so little effort because it It's no different.

719
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:15,500
Scott: It doesn't matter to me.

720
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:26,960
Scott: So if there's a virus and it's not gonna be a hassle for me to reformat because that's the kind of computing environment I use is one where it's not dependent on the operating system or very many local applications.

721
00:51:27,361 --> 00:51:28,664
Scott: Reformatting is no problem.

722
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:29,867
Scott: so viruses who cares?

723
00:51:29,907 --> 00:51:31,010
Scott: reformat end of story.

724
00:51:31,151 --> 00:51:37,740
Scott: who cares also of course if you use Linux Or even Mac or anything that's not windows.

725
00:51:38,521 --> 00:51:39,404
Scott: Yes, whatever.

726
00:51:39,765 --> 00:51:41,291
Scott: You know people argue.

727
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:42,415
Scott: Oh less people use it.

728
00:51:42,455 --> 00:51:43,860
Scott: That's why there's less viruses for it.

729
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,172
Scott: We're not even gonna touch on that are not even gonna make all those arguments.

730
00:51:47,212 --> 00:51:49,360
Scott: those arguments could go on for two episodes.

731
00:51:50,224 --> 00:51:58,600
Scott: The reality is if you use the other operating systems besides windows You can be stupider and also be much safer.

732
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:09,700
Rym: It is pretty much almost impossible to get some sort of spyware or virus short of downloading questionable code Which there isn't that much of and running it on your Linux box with root permission.

733
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:12,649
Rym: There is almost no way to compromise.

734
00:52:12,669 --> 00:52:14,616
Rym: you could try to compromise your Linux box.

735
00:52:14,656 --> 00:52:15,700
Rym: you'd have a little bit of trouble.

736
00:52:15,941 --> 00:52:17,165
Rym: I mean you'd have to know what you were doing.

737
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,231
Scott: yeah, and even Vista.

738
00:52:19,552 --> 00:52:22,080
Scott: You know it is a lot better than Windows XP.

739
00:52:22,321 --> 00:52:26,417
Scott: It's pretty hard to get Vista to have bad stuff on it without saying yes.

740
00:52:26,457 --> 00:52:26,638
Scott: Yes.

741
00:52:26,678 --> 00:52:26,859
Scott: Yes.

742
00:52:26,899 --> 00:52:29,877
Scott: Yes Yes, when a bunch when the evil thing tries to do its bidding yep.

743
00:52:30,902 --> 00:52:36,520
Rym: So if you're really worried about security and viruses and all that and you're not gonna switch to Linux or a Mac get Vista.

744
00:52:36,661 --> 00:52:41,921
Rym: There's no reason not to and you'll thank yourself and just don't Anything.

745
00:52:41,981 --> 00:52:43,487
Scott: don't trust anything.

746
00:52:43,688 --> 00:52:48,861
Scott: every program that you aren't a hundred percent sure about is evil File.

747
00:52:49,142 --> 00:52:54,940
Rym: don't open it until you have verified that it's me and even then think do I really trust that Rym character a hundred percent?

748
00:52:55,301 --> 00:53:01,420
Rym: Would I trust him with the ability to see every single thing on my hard drive and find out that I'm into?

749
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,031
Rym: Furry scat porn yeah, or whatever you're into.

750
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:06,958
Scott: or would you trust him not to?

751
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:11,816
Scott: Download a bunch of furry scat porn onto your computer to frame you and not even do what?

752
00:53:11,836 --> 00:53:12,920
Rym: would I trust him to fuck me?

753
00:53:13,362 --> 00:53:22,817
Rym: You also have to think what I trust the person who is sending me this file To know enough about computers to not have been infected themselves and then be passing it on to me through stupidity.

754
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:31,862
Scott: trust Absolutely nobody and you will be safe, and you won't need to waste your stupid computers resources on Antiviruses.

755
00:53:32,123 --> 00:53:33,889
Scott: you won't need to reformat so often.

756
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:37,440
Scott: you won't need to worry if you just don't trust shit.

757
00:53:38,023 --> 00:53:41,444
Scott: Everyone is out to put evil things on your computer Everyone.

758
00:53:41,825 --> 00:53:48,297
Rym: so all that aside we have announcement to make about the show and that Sometime in the next month or two we're not entirely sure when.

759
00:53:48,317 --> 00:53:49,806
Scott: but oh good I totally forgot.

760
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:52,140
Rym: we're going to do something that we did a long time ago.

761
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,123
Rym: That was super awesome.

762
00:53:53,143 --> 00:53:53,926
Rym: a lot of people liked it.

763
00:53:54,006 --> 00:53:55,572
Rym: where we did a question show.

764
00:53:55,612 --> 00:54:03,700
Rym: you all sent us your questions about us And we answered them honestly for about an hour and change and we're gonna do that again, but a little bit differently.

765
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,589
Rym: It's going to be per episode.

766
00:54:06,669 --> 00:54:18,671
Rym: so if you have any questions about science technology Computers Linux anything at all related to technology and science Send it to us either by email or more importantly.

767
00:54:18,992 --> 00:54:24,412
Rym: I'd rather you join the forum and post it there sometime tonight I'm gonna make a thread about it and sometime in the future.

768
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:25,275
Rym: We're once.

769
00:54:25,315 --> 00:54:27,987
Rym: we have enough good questions We're going to do a Monday show.

770
00:54:28,027 --> 00:54:31,020
Rym: that is nothing, but us answering your questions now.

771
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,129
Scott: Here are some guidelines.

772
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:36,251
Scott: cuz I'm gonna be honest with you I am NOT going to answer crappy questions.

773
00:54:36,311 --> 00:54:38,400
Scott: a crappy question is basically as good as no question.

774
00:54:38,822 --> 00:54:42,177
Scott: So here are some guidelines if you want your question to actually be answered on the show.

775
00:54:42,217 --> 00:54:46,211
Scott: number one Make your question clear and concise.

776
00:54:46,252 --> 00:54:47,456
Scott: I got to know what you're asking.

777
00:54:47,476 --> 00:54:48,340
Scott: be able to give an answer.

778
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:51,980
Scott: Don't be like ramble ramble ramble ramble ramble, and then I don't know what you're asking.

779
00:54:52,101 --> 00:54:53,108
Scott: Don't be I'm not even.

780
00:54:53,188 --> 00:54:53,913
Scott: I'm not even gonna like.

781
00:54:53,954 --> 00:54:54,840
Scott: try to figure it out.

782
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,765
Scott: I'm just not gonna answer.

783
00:54:55,845 --> 00:54:57,615
Rym: don't be the don't tase me bro guy.

784
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:01,470
Scott: Yes Number two keep it kind of short.

785
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:06,079
Scott: if you write like an essay or the question at the end No, we don't want to hear what you have to say.

786
00:55:06,461 --> 00:55:08,187
Scott: It's you want to hear what we have to say.

787
00:55:08,247 --> 00:55:11,558
Rym: don't try to impress us with your four paragraphs of Linux knowledge.

788
00:55:11,598 --> 00:55:14,248
Rym: before you ask Your question just ask the question.

789
00:55:14,489 --> 00:55:21,891
Scott: keep it short because I have to read your question on the air And if your question is two sentences I'm a lot more likely to just read your question number.

790
00:55:21,911 --> 00:55:32,800
Rym: the next if your question can be answered Trivially through Google and does not require Clarification beyond the first few links on Google don't ask we're not gonna answer.

791
00:55:33,101 --> 00:55:35,289
Rym: You could have answered it well before we do this.

792
00:55:35,309 --> 00:55:42,134
Scott: show yes, don't ask us something you can answer Yourselves or a question that is just a piece of information.

793
00:55:42,315 --> 00:55:44,382
Scott: ask us something that requires You know.

794
00:55:44,402 --> 00:55:51,686
Scott: like like a try to make them more like discussion topics then like don't ask What's the best thing?

795
00:55:51,746 --> 00:55:53,492
Scott: Well, that's I guess a good discussion time.

796
00:55:53,512 --> 00:55:54,254
Rym: Don't ask us.

797
00:55:54,555 --> 00:55:56,120
Rym: How do I set up a lamp server?

798
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:58,206
Rym: Ask us I'm new to Linux.

799
00:55:58,507 --> 00:56:01,236
Rym: Oh, how would I go about learning how to set up a lamp server?

800
00:56:01,397 --> 00:56:02,280
Rym: There's a big difference.

801
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:06,111
Scott: Yeah, don't say what's the command to show me?

802
00:56:06,151 --> 00:56:07,615
Scott: What files are in our directory?

803
00:56:07,896 --> 00:56:08,157
Scott: ask?

804
00:56:08,418 --> 00:56:09,120
Rym: What's the file?

805
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:16,200
Scott: Yeah, ask you know, what are some really clever commands, you know, cuz that's a discussion now.

806
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,524
Rym: These can also be personal questions related to science and technology or Monday night Pretty much.

807
00:56:20,926 --> 00:56:26,470
Rym: the board is open and if you ask a smart question You're gonna get a smart answer or at least a sarcastic answer.

808
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:29,520
Scott: Yeah, and if you ask a bad question, we will ignore you.

809
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,327
Rym: Yes, it's not like.

810
00:56:30,408 --> 00:56:32,504
Rym: oh if you ask a really dumb question We're gonna make fun of you.

811
00:56:32,525 --> 00:56:35,480
Scott: We might make fun of you if it's if it's that kind of question.

812
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,453
Scott: So try to avoid that.

813
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:39,308
Rym: if you don't want All right Let me go to this way if your question smart will answer it.

814
00:56:39,388 --> 00:56:41,154
Rym: if it's dumb will answer it snarkily.

815
00:56:41,636 --> 00:56:44,231
Rym: if your question is lame We're not gonna answer it.

816
00:56:44,392 --> 00:56:53,253
Scott: Yeah, so think about the questions you're sending in carefully and Send them in because we want quantity but quality isn't gonna.

817
00:56:53,274 --> 00:56:55,140
Scott: you know quality quality is gonna get through the sieve.

818
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:01,140
Rym: I recommend that you go into the forums and read the thread where these questions are posted and don't duplicate questions.

819
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:12,727
Rym: And also if you if you post them publicly like that You're gonna get a lot more Discussion and maybe follow on questions before we get around to answering them and you might get a lot more interesting Discussion as a result.

820
00:57:12,928 --> 00:57:13,350
Rym: Yeah.

821
00:57:13,411 --> 00:57:16,587
Scott: All right, just so people, you know Don't like try to avoid doing this.

822
00:57:17,029 --> 00:57:25,420
Scott: if you know the forum goes and answers your question You know because you post a question in the forum like tomorrow and then people start answering it in like another thread or something.

823
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:32,260
Scott: If it's still a good question, we'll still answer it on the show Feeling we're gonna need all the good questions we can get to fill out an hour.

824
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:37,275
Rym: Yes, plus as rockin as our forums are you're a very small minority of the listenership.

825
00:57:37,556 --> 00:57:45,523
Rym: Yep by the same token This is a good chance as you haven't joined our forums to join them because I got to admit I hang out in my own Forum something.

826
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:47,010
Rym: I never thought I would do in my whole life.

827
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,260
Scott: Yeah, I thought I might do that one day.

828
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,608
Rym: Well, but our forms are actually cool.

829
00:57:51,748 --> 00:57:53,575
