1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,290
Rym: It's Monday, October 22nd.

2
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:11,773
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:13,920
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,859
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,418
Rym: Tonight, a fresh Windows Linux OS X.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,398
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,460
Rym: Ah, over the weekend we all went to the Renaissance Fair.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,159
Rym: Well, everyone but Scott.

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,193
Scott: Ah, I stayed home and went, ah.

10
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:40,020
Rym: Yeah, though, I mean, I like Ren Fairs.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,295
Rym: I'll admit, Scott, that a Renaissance Fair might not be 100% up your alley.

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:46,225
Rym: Yeah.

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,140
Rym: But at the same time, something kinda awesome happened.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,020
Rym: Well, I mean, it was an awesome time for all of us in general.

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,220
Rym: We hung out at Jess's house, which was like super cool.

16
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:56,440
Rym: We did all this stuff and ate food.

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:02,980
Rym: But we're at the Renaissance Fair and I had my turkey leg and I had my soup in a bread bowl and my other soup in a bread bowl and my dumplings.

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,040
Rym: And this Renaissance Fair, they have such an awesome racket going.

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,320
Rym: Like the amount of money they made was probably staggering.

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,940
Scott: Ah, the amount of money I saved then must be equally staggering.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,498
Rym: Well, the reason is very simply that they have it set up so that if you, say, are at the Renaissance Fair and you like wine.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,480
Rym: A lot of people go to these things like wine.

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,280
Rym: There's wine and beer everywhere to drink.

24
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,540
Rym: There's a winery set up, a permanent one, at the entrance/exit to the Renaissance Fair.

25
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:36,553
Rym: And they ran a 25% off if you buy a case of 12 or more.

26
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:44,418
Rym: And they had a limited selection of very specific wines and tasting, just open tasting.

27
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:52,380
Rym: So people are coming out of the Renaissance Fair in a rush at the end of the day after the big joust and everything and they're all kind of intoxicated anyway.

28
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:55,180
Rym: And they come upon free wine tasting.

29
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:56,940
Rym: And then they see a discount.

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,119
Rym: And people were buying hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars of wine, all of them, including me.

31
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:06,500
Rym: Thing is, the wine was actually really well-priced.

32
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,640
Rym: And while their reds were kind of really generic, all their special wines were actually pretty damn good and really cheap.

33
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,180
Scott: You probably could have saved some money if you went to the state discount liquor store or something.

34
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,205
Rym: It depends.

35
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,919
Rym: I buy my liquor at places like that.

36
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,509
Scott: Eh, whatever.

37
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,330
Rym: I tasted the wine.

38
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,754
Rym: It was good.

39
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:24,440
Rym: I got a bunch of spicy wine.

40
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,100
Scott: You were already intoxicated when you tasted that wine.

41
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:27,219
Scott: I wasn't actually.

42
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:33,540
Scott: They could get you drunk and then they'll give you, like, you know, frickin' hobo wine.

43
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:34,953
Rym: You'd be like, "Wow, hobo is

44
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:35,459
Rym: awesome!".

45
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,386
Rym: That's the other thing.

46
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:38,040
Rym: A lot of people don't know how to taste wine.

47
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,539
Rym: I mean, when I was tasting the wine, I was spitting it out.

48
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,680
Rym: Because if you actually want to taste wine, if you don't spit it out, you're going to get drunk real quick.

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,960
Rym: And then you're not going to be able to tell what tastes good or not.

50
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,840
Rym: You're going to come home with a bunch of hobo wine.

51
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:53,300
Scott: When I was reading that article about wine counterfeiting...

52
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,159
Rym: Did you read the whole thing?

53
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,220
Scott: I read most of it.

54
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,780
Rym: I skimmed it, but yeah, it was pretty interesting.

55
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:00,440
Scott: But there was a guy in there who would get these stupidly expensive wines.

56
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,200
Scott: And when he would taste them, he would taste them with a bunch of other people.

57
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:07,592
Scott: And he would make sure everyone swallows it, because he's like, "I didn't spend the frickin' thousand dollars.

58
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:08,096
Scott: You just spit it

59
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:08,338
Scott: out.".

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Scott: See, for me, that's different.

61
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,624
Scott: But then people would bring, like, spittoons and hide them in their laps, because the amount of stuff that they were going to have to drink, they were like, "Oh my god.

62
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:20,078
Scott: I don't want to get plastered and fall over like a

63
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:20,459
Scott: doofus.".

64
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,099
Scott: But meanwhile, the guy who was doing it, it's like, "Eh, he just drinks it

65
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:24,260
Scott: all.".

66
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:24,864
Scott: He's like, "Whatever.

67
00:03:24,884 --> 00:03:27,199
Scott: You could probably drink, like, five bottles, that'd be

68
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:27,300
Scott: fine.".

69
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,439
Rym: You know, there was a really good Master Keaton about that.

70
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:31,660
Scott: A guy who could just drink everyone under the table?

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,639
Rym: Well, no, there's like this ancient bottle of wine, like the most fat...

72
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,997
Scott: Oh, so Master Keaton, it's insured by Mr.

73
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:38,499
Scott: Keaton.

74
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,920
Rym: Well, in the end, Master Keaton wants to taste it, and he's so nervous.

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,730
Rym: He's like, "I don't know if I can deal with this.

76
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:46,758
Rym: I'm afraid to drink it.

77
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:47,079
Rym: I don't

78
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:47,200
Rym: know.".

79
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:51,320
Rym: But, so I didn't actually get drunk, just because, meh.

80
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,673
Rym: But, our friend Peter Olson bought something awesome.

81
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:55,978
Rym: Something that is...

82
00:03:56,622 --> 00:03:58,080
Scott: An inflatable flail?

83
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,103
Rym: No, no, no.

84
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:01,140
Rym: Though he found an emo Viking helmet.

85
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,240
Rym: It was a Viking helmet, but the horns pointed down.

86
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:04,000
Rym: Alright.

87
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,983
Rym: But he didn't buy that.

88
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:09,620
Rym: What he bought was a real, awesome, like, drinking horn.

89
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,880
Scott: A drinking horn?

90
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,911
Rym: A drinking horn.

91
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:12,700
Rym: A real one.

92
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,260
Scott: See, I want to get one of those bags to drink, like, the wine.

93
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,983
Rym: They had those.

94
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:20,000
Rym: They also had the wooden mugs and the leather mugs that you can just strap to your belt.

95
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,305
Scott: I don't need the mugs.

96
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:22,692
Scott: I like the bags.

97
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,480
Scott: They just kind of squeeze it into your mouth.

98
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,099
Rym: A wine skin?

99
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:25,989
Scott: Yeah, skin.

100
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,699
Scott: That's what it's called.

101
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,070
Rym: But he bought it, and then he went to a beer stand.

102
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:32,119
Rym: He was like, "Could you rinse this out and fill it with beer for

103
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,220
Rym: me?".

104
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,929
Rym: And they were like, "That's enough beer to kill a man.

105
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:35,999
Rym: I'm going to give you one glass of beer poured into

106
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:36,079
Rym: it.".

107
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,660
Rym: The thing will hold a whole bottle of wine, even though it doesn't look that big.

108
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:40,235
Scott: Wow.

109
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:41,480
Rym: It's quite impressive.

110
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,100
Rym: So, we're at the joust, and Peter's drinking from his drinking horn, and we didn't pay attention.

111
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:47,289
Rym: We just showed up at the joust.

112
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:48,640
Rym: First to go to the human chest, right?

113
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,460
Rym: Which is Sir Walter Raleigh versus some evil dude.

114
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,082
Rym: No, no, so whatever.

115
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:54,065
Rym: It's like a cheesy plot.

116
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:59,520
Rym: They're fighting, and they're going to fight over the governorship of Ireland and whatever, and then there's some evil going on.

117
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:00,905
Rym: Then we get to the joust.

118
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,734
Rym: We're like, "All right, this is going to be cheesy and awesome.

119
00:05:02,754 --> 00:05:03,115
Rym: Whatever.".

120
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:06,900
Rym: And we didn't realize that we sat on the evil side.

121
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,840
Rym: You know, it's like one crowd of the crowd is for the good guys, like on the queen side, Queen Elizabeth, and everyone else is on the bad guys' side.

122
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,423
Rym: Ah.

123
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,999
Rym: So, we're sitting there, and we don't know what to expect, and then when the cultists came out...

124
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:20,900
Scott: All right.

125
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,792
Rym: Pete and I were like, "Oh, man!

126
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:23,799
Rym: God!".

127
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:31,800
Rym: We got more into it because I didn't expect cultists and sacrifice and evil plots to summon a demon knight to kill everyone and take the throne.

128
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,366
Rym: Uh-huh.

129
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,017
Rym: And then, you know, when the cultists come out, right, they start playing all this music, and I think to myself, "Wait a minute.

130
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:39,559
Rym: Wait a

131
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:39,800
Rym: minute.".

132
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:40,700
Scott: Are they playing Slayer?

133
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:41,782
Rym: "Wait a minute.

134
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:44,046
Rym: This sounds familiar, these

135
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:44,547
Rym: lyrics.".

136
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:50,357
Rym: And I turn to Pete, and he turns to me, "Archangel, Darkangel, lend me thy light.

137
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:51,138
Rym: Not

138
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:51,439
Rym: here.".

139
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,039
Scott: Not here, yep.

140
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,480
Rym: And then they played some other Cradle of Filth song, and they played some... It was unexpectedly awesome.

141
00:05:59,782 --> 00:05:59,967
Scott: Uh-huh.

142
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,120
Rym: And in the end, the good guys won.

143
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:02,604
Rym: Boo.

144
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,648
Rym: But the thing is, it played out really well.

145
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:09,100
Rym: I expect a yo cheesy whatever when the time came to pull the evil.

146
00:06:09,642 --> 00:06:13,419
Rym: The cultists just fucking rush everyone with swords and start killing them, like straight up.

147
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,030
Rym: Uh-huh.

148
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,600
Rym: So, uh, then we leave.

149
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,580
Scott: At least they died honorably.

150
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,500
Rym: So then we leave, and we're on, you know, we get our wine, and we're on the road home, and we stop at a gas station to get some Red Bulls and pee and all that, you know, go to the pee station and all that business.

151
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,500
Scott: The pee station?

152
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:28,520
Scott: And I see... What did that pee station smell like?

153
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,438
Rym: Smelled like pee.

154
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:36,860
Rym: Uh... So from a distance, I see one of the cultists from the Ren Faire going in, you know, someone dressed in, like, all these black robes.

155
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,315
Rym: And I'm like, "Aw, man, it's one of the

156
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:38,779
Rym: cultists.".

157
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:43,594
Rym: Once we got in, it turned out that it was actually unrelated to the Renaissance Faire.

158
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:45,180
Rym: It was just a Muslim woman in a burqa.

159
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:50,133
Rym: And I'm so glad I didn't go and be like, "Man, you were awesome.

160
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,099
Rym: I was totally on your side right up to the

161
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:52,360
Rym: end.".

162
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,480
Rym: Yeah.

163
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:53,808
Rym: Yeah.

164
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:57,919
Rym: But the Renaissance Faire was worth it.

165
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,400
Scott: Yeah.

166
00:06:59,223 --> 00:06:59,819
Rym: That's all I got?

167
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:01,019
Scott: No, that's not all you got.

168
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,240
Rym: Well, it's not all I got?

169
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:02,960
Scott: No, it's not.

170
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:03,879
Rym: What else do I got?

171
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,612
Scott: Something that's actually related to Monday.

172
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:06,600
Scott: I guess somewhat.

173
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:08,040
Rym: Oh, I got a new job.

174
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,410
Scott: Yeah.

175
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:09,458
Rym: I got a new job.

176
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:09,987
Scott: Yay.

177
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:12,920
Scott: Now you have to stop complaining about your shit job.

178
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:21,460
Rym: Honestly, I don't think you're ever going to hear me talk about my job again, because my new job is, like, more awesome than I could have expected.

179
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,400
Scott: If you ever complain about it, you won't hear the end of it from me.

180
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,103
Rym: No, you won't.

181
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:28,280
Rym: You won't hear the end of it from me, because I'm excited about this job.

182
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:32,657
Rym: For the first time since I left college, I'm excited about a job.

183
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:33,320
Rym: Think about that.

184
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:34,886
Rym: I'm excited about work.

185
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:37,959
Rym: About a nine to, well, a seven to four job.

186
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:39,118
Scott: Great job.

187
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,268
Rym: Yeah, I'm all up in this business.

188
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,394
Rym: I'm up in this grill.

189
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:43,420
Rym: This job is my parliament.

190
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,760
Scott: So, news.

191
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:45,163
Rym: So?

192
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:45,700
Rym: News?

193
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,766
Scott: Yeah, we missed two weeks of news here.

194
00:07:47,786 --> 00:07:52,200
Scott: There's a lot of stuff to catch up on, but that means since I'm only picking one, I gotta pick the big one.

195
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:53,899
Rym: Whoa, what's the big one?

196
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,335
Scott: Obviously, it's all about some monkeys of a variety.

197
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,980
Scott: The Gibbon variety, I think.

198
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,498
Scott: Gutsy Gibbon.

199
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:03,540
Scott: It's out.

200
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,523
Rym: Yeah, and we got a lot to say, surprisingly.

201
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:08,426
Rym: Not because of Gutsy Gibbon.

202
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:17,960
Rym: Gutsy Gibbon's fine, but people are really excited about Gutsy Gibbon, but for reasons that aren't quite what they perhaps should be excited about.

203
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:28,860
Scott: Yeah, I mean, basically what's going on here, right, is the tech, the word on the tech news beat is that, "Oh, people are disappointed with Vista, so everyone's going to the Gutsy Gibbons, oh

204
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:28,940
Scott: man.".

205
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:36,832
Rym: You go to any blog that talks about Linux distros, and they're always like, "Gutsy Gibbon is like a leap forward for Linux.

206
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:40,477
Rym: This is like Linux on the desktop, all the way, everything's great.

207
00:08:40,517 --> 00:08:41,799
Rym: This is like the second coming of

208
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,179
Rym: Jesus.".

209
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:48,052
Scott: There are all these tech journalists who are like, "I tried Linux and Ubuntu many, many times, but this is finally the one.

210
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,234
Scott: that's the business.

211
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:51,498
Scott: Oh man, all the other ones sucked, but this is the first one.

212
00:08:51,518 --> 00:08:51,979
Scott: that's the real

213
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:52,240
Scott: deal.".

214
00:08:52,340 --> 00:09:04,900
Rym: So, Scott, I mean, Gutsy Gibbon obviously is the second or third coming of Jesus Christ our savior, so what did they, I mean, do they have like a new kernel memory management thing that just blows us away?

215
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,372
Scott: Well, it does have the 2622 kernel instead of the 2620 kernel.

216
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,960
Scott: Thank fucking God!

217
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,680
Scott: Of Feisty Fawn, which is a vast improvement, especially if you are using a laptop or something.

218
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,459
Rym: A laptop or a lot of new 8-bit motherboards.

219
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:19,479
Scott: Well, I guess.

220
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:23,240
Rym: From what I read, it looks like my motherboard will actually work with this kernel.

221
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,549
Scott: Maybe.

222
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:26,639
Rym: I can turn my turning 8-bit off back on.

223
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:34,100
Scott: Secondly, it has a new thing for printing, so now, like, if you've ever not been able to get your printer to work in Linux, your troubles are over.

224
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,340
Scott: Like, even, I know a lot of people, they couldn't get their printer to work in Windows either, just because setting up a printer is kind of, you know, hard for most people.

225
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:47,120
Scott: Well, I think the reason for that- If you've ever had trouble setting up a printer, I think it's easier to set up a printer in Gutsy Gibbon than in any other OS ever.

226
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:51,238
Rym: Well, the thing with Windows printers, because I can get this out of the way real quick, is that- They suck?

227
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,900
Rym: Well, no, it's that the context in setting up a printer in Windows can fool you in one specific time.

228
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:10,418
Rym: If you have a printer that has its own NIC, or like, its own IP address out there, or it's a server that serves a printer as though it's just a standalone printer, like, directly printing to an IP address, you think, "Yeah, network printer.

229
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:11,399
Rym: I want to set up a network

230
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:11,680
Rym: printer.".

231
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:12,581
Rym: No.

232
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:18,596
Rym: You have to set up a local printer, and then under local printer, choose TCP/IP local port.

233
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:21,119
Scott: Now, that- I've never seen that.

234
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,657
Rym: Yeah, if you want to print directly to an IP printer, you have to set up a local IP port.

235
00:10:25,878 --> 00:10:31,202
Scott: If you try to- It's what I used to just type in a URL, like, using, like, IPP cups, I would type in, like- Because that's different.

236
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:32,645
Rym: That's not direct IP printing.

237
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:33,427
Rym: That's mitigate.

238
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:38,880
Rym: That's, like, moderated printing through- It might be an embedded server, but that's different from embedded direct printing.

239
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,518
Scott: Whatever.

240
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:42,094
Rym: Yeah, but a lot of printers do that.

241
00:10:42,114 --> 00:10:43,100
Rym: A lot of people have trouble with that.

242
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,421
Scott: You know what?

243
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:51,000
Scott: If you have a network printer, and you're on the network, and the network printer is working, and you're using Ubuntu, you can click search for network printers, and they'll all show up.

244
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,160
Rym: Yeah, now, I'm glad- that's a problem that should have been solved, like, ten years ago in computing.

245
00:10:57,342 --> 00:10:57,988
Scott: Alright, let's see.

246
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,180
Scott: What else is different?

247
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,569
Rym: But are there any, like, great leaps forward?

248
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,620
Rym: Why is this the best Linux to ever come out?

249
00:11:04,382 --> 00:11:05,204
Scott: I don't know.

250
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:06,888
Scott: What else did they change?

251
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:11,119
Scott: I mean, it's a little easier to configure your, uh, X, like-.

252
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:19,680
Scott: This is the first time where I didn't have to actually edit the Xorg.conf to make stuff work, even with two monitors, or using my laptop with a strange resolution, so that's a bonus.

253
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:32,900
Scott: However, because I'm using Nvidia, I had to do some weird combination of using the new Ubuntu, uh, graphical configuration thing, and the Nvidia graphical configuration thing, until I got it just right with my two monitor deal.

254
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:33,319
Scott: Yeah.

255
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,480
Scott: But, if you ignore the Nvidia stuff, you can just do it straight with the Ubuntu, and it should work, I guess, okay.

256
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,360
Rym: So what's the revolution of Gutsy Gibbon?

257
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:43,627
Scott: Uh, what else did they change?

258
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:48,800
Scott: Oh, sound support is worse than it was in the previous, uh, Ubuntu.

259
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,418
Scott: But it was worse in Feisty than it was in- what?

260
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:51,679
Scott: Ugh.

261
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,260
Scott: Basically, they got the same sound configuration dialogue, right?

262
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,520
Rym: Oh, the one that doesn't do anything?

263
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,159
Scott: Right, so I changed all- in Feisty, I was able to change all the options to say, "Hey, use the optical output of my sound

264
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:02,420
Scott: card.".

265
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:08,260
Scott: I did the same thing in Gutsy, didn't work, I had to manually configure using the Alsa configuration file.

266
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:15,600
Rym: And you might all remember my Feisty problems, trying to get anything to work, that's why I'm using Jack right now, but that's partly ReSound's fault.

267
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,940
Scott: ReSound's, uh, the ReSound package for Ubuntu still crashes when you try to record, and you still need to use Jack.

268
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:26,360
Rym: Granted, I don't mind using Jack, because Jack is actually- A little better technically somewhere?

269
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:33,100
Rym: It's more robust, it seems, in that I have not- never had a problem with any process causing my audio to skip.

270
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:34,342
Scott: Mhm.

271
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:35,546
Scott: Oh, right, obviously.

272
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:40,780
Scott: The, uh, the one change is they added the Compiz Fusions by default.

273
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:54,700
Rym: So, now what does this say about Linux journalism, in that the Linux that gets, like, more attention than any Linux ever, like, this is Linux, this is the best thing ever, it is now perfect, is that they added some iCandy.

274
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:02,340
Scott: Yeah, basically, if you install Gutsy Given, there's three options, no iCandy, normal iCandy, and super iCandy.

275
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:10,980
Scott: And no- regular iCandy is the default, as long as you have some sort of 3D card that your- that Linux is, you know, supports.

276
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,120
Scott: It's like, I have an Intel card on my laptop, it just set normal by default, and it worked.

277
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:23,080
Scott: I had an Nvidia on my desktop, which means after I installed the Nvidia driver, which is, like, one click, uh, it starts working.

278
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:27,894
Scott: And if you're using an ATI card, I guess it's also one click to set up the ATI stuff now.

279
00:13:28,135 --> 00:13:29,740
Scott: At least I think so, I don't know, actually, no.

280
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,639
Rym: Yeah, I haven't even really used Gutsy yet, so.

281
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,860
Scott: Yeah, but the basic iCandy is just, you know, drop shadows, little window animations, changing desktops makes a little slidey effect.

282
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,140
Rym: See, I like stuff like that, it doesn't get in your way, as long as it- die actually doesn't get in your way.

283
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:50,900
Scott: My personal philosophy on iCandy is, I want to make my computer easier to use, and I wanna use my computer more efficiently.

284
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:54,360
Scott: So, if it helps me use the computer more efficiently, I want it.

285
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,840
Scott: If it looks good, and doesn't hurt my ability to use my computer efficiently, sure, why not.

286
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,580
Scott: But if it in any way makes it harder for me to use the computer, I don't care how pretty it is, get it out of my face.

287
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,691
Scott: Like, those wobbly windows, fuck 'em.

288
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:09,460
Scott: They're just fucking me around, and it's bullshit.

289
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:17,700
Scott: So yeah, basically, the only real substantial change, other than printing and stuff, to this latest Ubuntu, is iCandy.

290
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:26,630
Scott: And suddenly, everyone, after all these years of having these true, rightful complaints about, you know, Linux, they'd be like, "Oh, I can't use Linux, it doesn't support this.

291
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:27,797
Scott: Oh, I can't use Linux, it doesn't support

292
00:14:27,837 --> 00:14:27,958
Scott: that.".

293
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,760
Scott: They, for years and years and years, people had these legitimate complaints about why they weren't using Linux, right?

294
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:36,380
Scott: And most of those complaints are still perfectly valid.

295
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:40,858
Scott: But suddenly, they forgot all those, because now there's iCandy, and they're going, "Woo, Linux, second

296
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:41,220
Scott: coming!".

297
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:45,598
Scott: And I'm like, "Wow, wow, journalistic integrity right out the

298
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:45,919
Scott: window.".

299
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:50,100
Scott: And I'm the Linux user, who's been using it when it was shitty and still is shitty.

300
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,540
Rym: I just find it kind of hilarious, to be honest.

301
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:59,660
Scott: Yeah, I don't get it, but it shows that people, all they really care about is iCandy, hence the Apple fanboyism, you know?

302
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:00,603
Scott: "Oh, it's so much

303
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:00,804
Scott: easier.".

304
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:14,979
Scott: No, it's just iCandy messing with the psychology, or I don't know what the fuck it is, but they've proved to me once and for all, I now firmly believe that people, most people, really just care about iCandy, and technology is just an excuse they use.

305
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:24,720
Rym: So, in other big news, I feel like I'm almost obligated to talk about this, but Radiohead, you might have heard of them, they're a somewhat popular band, I hear.

306
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:26,480
Scott: I know they're a rock band.

307
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,120
Scott: Weren't they in that, were they the band from The Scott Teneman Must Die, or is that another band?

308
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:32,880
Scott: You know, I don't remember.

309
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:33,958
Scott: I think it might have been.

310
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,838
Rym: Uh, yeah, I think it was.

311
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,367
Scott: Yeah.

312
00:15:36,532 --> 00:15:36,697
Scott: Anyway.

313
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,158
Scott: Okay, so now I kinda little know more about who they are.

314
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:54,440
Rym: Radiohead, if you aren't aware, released their new album titled In Rainbows online by themselves, and they had their servers up and everything, and they basically released it with the idea that you can pay however much you wanna pay.

315
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,378
Scott: Can I pay zero?

316
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,546
Rym: Yes, you can.

317
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:58,380
Rym: If you wanna pay zero, you can pay zero.

318
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:58,895
Rym: Alright.

319
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:02,000
Rym: We're just gonna put it up there, no DRM, no nothing.

320
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:06,180
Rym: Just, you're gonna download straight up, unencumbered files to do with as you please.

321
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:18,600
Rym: And, uh, a lot of people went in a lot of directions about, you know, oh, they're gonna, everyone's just gonna hit zero, or one guy's gonna get it for zero, and then it's just gonna be all over the torrent, so they're not gonna make any money, blah blah blah blah blah blah.

322
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:39,840
Rym: They didn't really say, like, they didn't wanna release how many sales they actually get, or what people are actually saying, but there's a lot of rumors about what the information was, and guesses seem to be that one to two thirds of people paid zero, but there's an article here stating that it is believed that they made between six and ten million dollars.

323
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,309
Scott: It's possible, I mean, for every person.

324
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:46,880
Scott: that's, you know, most people are just gonna pay zero, or like a dollar, or something like that, right?

325
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,497
Scott: It's like a long tail, but there's very few people who are like, "I love Radiohead, here's a thousand

326
00:16:52,538 --> 00:16:52,939
Scott: dollars!".

327
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,784
Scott: You know, 'cause it's like finally a chan-.

328
00:16:54,824 --> 00:17:09,156
Scott: I mean, 'cause, like, think about it, back in the day, you know, remember people would download MP3s and peer-to-peer networks, and then, like, send checks to the artist to say, you know, "I don't wanna buy your CDs 'cause I hate the record company, but here's some money for you, the artist, 'cause I know if I buy the CD, you're gonna get, like, five cents, but here's ten

329
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:09,459
Scott: bucks.".

330
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:12,560
Scott: And those checks all came back, 'cause, like, we can't accept your money.

331
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:20,898
Scott: Now, here's a chance for people to actually give money directly to the artist and no one else, so some people are gonna give a lot of money, and most people are just gonna get their MP3s.

332
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,839
Rym: Plus, I mean, I can think of bands where I'd give 'em a few bucks.

333
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,540
Rym: Yeah, I'll give, you know- Buck and I supremacy?

334
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,858
Scott: I'd give them some bucks.

335
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,840
Rym: Yeah, but, I mean, we don't really know exactly how successful this was from a monetary perspective.

336
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,440
Rym: What we do know is that the album was downloaded crazily, absolutely batshit crazily by a lot of people.

337
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,039
Scott: That's a good PR move right there.

338
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:44,439
Rym: And, see, I think that's it.

339
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:54,638
Rym: In the next couple years, I think we're gonna see a few more, you know, every now and then some big name is gonna buck the trend and say, "All right, we're doing it the way you geeks want it, let's see what

340
00:17:54,678 --> 00:17:55,119
Rym: happens.".

341
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,283
Scott: I mean, think about it this way, right?

342
00:17:57,524 --> 00:18:03,080
Scott: Radiohead, not even on my radar, I didn't even know who they were, just barely anything, right?

343
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,705
Scott: Now, they did this.

344
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:09,339
Scott: Odds are, I'm gonna at least listen to their music once to be like, "Oh, that's who they

345
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:09,480
Scott: are.".

346
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:14,472
Scott: Because they did this, they got someone to listen to their music.

347
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:15,376
Scott: Huge.

348
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:16,180
Scott: That's huge.

349
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,385
Rym: Now, plus, think of this from another perspective.

350
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:23,800
Rym: Say you're a little struggling indie band and you just put your music up in the same kind of deal.

351
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,872
Rym: Like, "Hey, download our

352
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:24,953
Rym: MP3s.".

353
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:27,120
Scott: Not gonna get as much play as Radiohead.

354
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,000
Rym: But while you're not, I almost feel like the future of music is gonna be in this long tail.

355
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:41,340
Rym: And at that point, getting yourself known, especially if you don't have to pay anyone to get you known, you don't have to pay a marketing machine, to take your face and put it on billboards.

356
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,560
Scott: No, but what Radiohead did have to do is, first of all, they had the "pre" being known by getting their face on billboards, which helped a lot.

357
00:18:48,700 --> 00:19:04,300
Scott: And second of all, this latest move, while they didn't, I guess, at least as far as I know, it wasn't advertised on television or anywhere like billboards and such, it was put in newspapers and websites and blogs of everyone going, "Oh man, Radiohead is giving away their music for free.

358
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:06,717
Scott: You're just a musician, no one's gonna talk about

359
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:06,797
Scott: it.".

360
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,752
Rym: Well, the thing is, some people will, because this is the big scale.

361
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,820
Rym: Make the little microcosm, the little tiny analogy example.

362
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,700
Rym: The little indie band will do it and get talked about on the little indie band blogs.

363
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,499
Rym: It'll be like this tiny little storm of publicity within the realm of that kind of music.

364
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:31,933
Scott: Until this becomes a commonplace practice, which it actually is among many indie bands, so no one will talk about it, because it's like saying, "Someone came out with a new CD.

365
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:32,216
Scott: Oh my

366
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:32,438
Scott: god.".

367
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,350
Scott: Well, no, not "Oh my

368
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:33,431
Scott: god."

369
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:34,019
Scott: It happens every day.

370
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:35,571
Rym: See, you kind of jumped my point.

371
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,479
Rym: That's what I was getting to.

372
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:43,500
Rym: This, in my opinion, is not a revolution in music distribution or bands making money or anything like that.

373
00:19:44,020 --> 00:20:00,720
Rym: I think that this is just one stepping stone on the way to a future that is basically going to be the long tail of a whole bunch of bands competing in the effectively free market space and ones that are good eventually filtering to the top purely on their own merit and making money from live shows and merchandise.

374
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:10,140
Scott: Yeah, I mean even the really big people today, I mean I heard some numbers from places that Madonna made less than $20 million on some albums.

375
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:10,574
Scott: Oh no!

376
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,080
Scott: But she made like $600 million from concerts and stuff.

377
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:15,108
Rym: But remember, there are different kinds of artists.

378
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:18,160
Rym: Madonna definitely does those stadium concerts.

379
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,620
Rym: A million people come and you do a whole bunch in a row.

380
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,089
Scott: And those are my favorite kinds, I would not mind.

381
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,660
Scott: Not Madonna specifically, but stadium awesomeness.

382
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:31,980
Rym: I don't know, my favorite kind of concert is the smaller, more intense- The stadium places.

383
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,180
Rym: I don't know, I really like the up close and personal like little scummy jazz band somewhere.

384
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:46,640
Rym: But I think the important thing about this is that this radio-ed thing, even if it's not like the end all, like this is not how music is going to be distributed, and eventually this sort of thing is just going to be commonplace.

385
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,175
Scott: Eventually music, you will just think in your mind and then music will appear.

386
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:51,100
Scott: Oh wait, you can do that already.

387
00:20:51,360 --> 00:21:01,659
Rym: But what I think is that this is going to be a turning point in that the media, the mainstream media, not the geeky media, but the real world like, "Today in Iraq a bomb blew

388
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:01,880
Rym: off.".

389
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:03,500
Scott: Old school crap media.

390
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,919
Rym: You know, like the guy on CNN.

391
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:17,858
Rym: I think those people are talking about this as, "Wow, this band bucked a trend and did something weird, and they're going to make a bunch of money, and this is going to turn the record industry up on its

392
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:18,079
Rym: head.".

393
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:26,217
Rym: I think financial types might see this and it'll put that seed into their heads of, "Maybe we should invest in alternative distribution of music or

394
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:26,580
Rym: something.".

395
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:27,340
Scott: Eh, whatever.

396
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:38,360
Rym: I feel like if nothing else, this put into the consciousness of the previous few generations that maybe the record industry is not going to be the way it's always been in the future.

397
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:46,240
Scott: I think the interesting story that I saw people talking about was how even though they're doing this, a lot of people are still downloading the stuff from peer-to-peer networks.

398
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,140
Rym: Well, I think the reason for that is that peer-to-peer is still easier.

399
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,967
Scott: Well, it's not that it's just easier.

400
00:21:51,008 --> 00:22:03,253
Scott: I think the thing is that I realized recently is that a whole generation or two of people from us on down have grown up and the way that they know to get music is peer-to-peer networks.

401
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:03,900
Scott: That's what they learn.

402
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,923
Scott: It's like, "How do you get music?

403
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:06,268
Scott: A peer-to-peer network.

404
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:09,018
Scott: Use LimeWire, use Nutella, use Kazaa, use

405
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:09,359
Scott: whatever.".

406
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:11,620
Scott: That's the way they know to get music.

407
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,418
Scott: So if there's ever a time to get music, they don't even know, "Go to a website, use your iTunes, Wi-Fi,

408
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:17,880
Scott: whatever.".

409
00:22:18,223 --> 00:22:20,400
Scott: They know, "Go to a peer-to-peer network and get

410
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:20,460
Scott: it.".

411
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:33,440
Scott: That's how they know and that's what they're going to do and continue doing until they learn something else, if someone changes their learning, which is incredibly difficult because you can see people like my parents, they grew up learning how to get music was to buy an album.

412
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,575
Scott: And even though they know, I tell them, "Just frickin' don't do that.

413
00:22:37,595 --> 00:22:38,157
Scott: You're wasting your

414
00:22:38,197 --> 00:22:38,378
Scott: money.".

415
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:41,500
Scott: They do it anyway because that's what they learned and it's incredibly difficult.

416
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,500
Rym: Are you sure they don't do it because they don't want to be a pirate or steal?

417
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,358
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

418
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:45,765
Scott: Ah.

419
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:48,668
Scott: Because they just don't unlearn.

420
00:22:48,728 --> 00:22:49,551
Scott: People don't unlearn.

421
00:22:49,772 --> 00:22:50,676
Scott: They don't learn new things.

422
00:22:50,696 --> 00:22:51,640
Scott: They stick with what they know.

423
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,122
Rym: See, I don't know.

424
00:22:52,142 --> 00:23:01,300
Rym: I could definitely see people making the argument that they don't do that sort of thing just because they don't want to be a sub-media pirate or they feel like they're stealing and they don't want to do it.

425
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,724
Scott: But they don't even go and buy.

426
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:07,460
Scott: They could save money by just buying non-DRM tracks on iTunes, which is non-DRM tracks now.

427
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:07,939
Rym: Not many.

428
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:11,535
Scott: No, every track on iTunes is now non-DRM for a dollar.

429
00:23:11,575 --> 00:23:12,620
Scott: Yes, they changed it recently.

430
00:23:13,382 --> 00:23:16,200
Rym: But non-DRM, is it MP3 or is it still some other format?

431
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,920
Scott: Well, it's AACs, but you're listening on an iPod and you could burn a CD.

432
00:23:20,462 --> 00:23:21,780
Rym: Yeah, not everyone has an iPod.

433
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,016
Scott: Yeah, but you could burn a CD and you could convert.

434
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:27,700
Rym: I'm just never happy because a dollar is just way too much.

435
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,820
Scott: A dollar is just way too much for me as well, but it's still cheaper than a frickin' CD at the store.

436
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,389
Scott: But anyway, yes, that's the point.

437
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:35,779
Scott: People don't unlearn.

438
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:43,900
Rym: Things of the day.

439
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:56,980
Rym: So Emily showed me this the other day and partly because we've been on the other side of this for a long time, this is someone's blog post on eight ways to drive a graphic designer mad.

440
00:23:58,121 --> 00:23:59,479
Rym: And it's kind of really...

441
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,971
Scott: Hey, can you make something for me?

442
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:02,060
Scott: Something cool-looking.

443
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,440
Rym: When you send a graphic designer a document, make sure it's made with a program from the Microsoft Office Suite.

444
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:17,520
Rym: If you have to send pictures, you'll have more success in driving them mad if instead of sending a JPEG or a raw camera file, you embed the pictures inside of a Microsoft Office document like Word or PowerPoint.

445
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,692
Rym: Don't forget to lower the resolution to 72 DPI.

446
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,956
Rym: When you send them a higher version later, make sure the size is at least 50% smaller.

447
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:27,260
Rym: Awesome.

448
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:37,680
Rym: Because honestly, I've had that happen to me a lot where someone will have to send me a screenshot or a picture and they just put it in a Word document and then send me the Word document.

449
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,720
Rym: And on the other token, we've been on the side where we need art.

450
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,731
Rym: So we talk to an artist and we say, "Make us

451
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:45,993
Rym: art.".

452
00:24:46,073 --> 00:24:46,878
Rym: And they say, "What do you

453
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:47,120
Rym: want?".

454
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,766
Rym: And I say, "I don't know.

455
00:24:49,148 --> 00:24:49,991
Rym: Make it arty.

456
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:51,317
Rym: Make it look like something

457
00:24:51,377 --> 00:24:51,698
Rym: good.".

458
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,152
Scott: I mean, this is sort of the thing where it's like.

459
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:58,700
Scott: I encountered this problem with people when I'm trying to help them with their computers.

460
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:03,120
Scott: And I recognize that they can't tell me what the problem is.

461
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,360
Scott: They're incapable of doing it because they lack the vocabulary.

462
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,100
Scott: They lack the understanding of the computer.

463
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,727
Scott: They can't tell me what's wrong with it.

464
00:25:10,787 --> 00:25:13,120
Scott: I need to pretty much go and investigate it myself.

465
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,937
Scott: This is why you don't call a mechanic and say, "Yeah, my car is making a chugga-chugga-chugga

466
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:17,219
Scott: noise.".

467
00:25:17,903 --> 00:25:22,140
Scott: You freaking take it to the mechanic and let him look at it because that's the only way he's going to be able to figure anything out.

468
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:32,560
Scott: So with a graphic designer, it's much more difficult because they're not trying to fix something that's broken and you lack the vocabulary to tell them, but they can still figure it out by looking at the broken thing themselves.

469
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:37,860
Scott: They need to know what you want and you still lack the vocabulary.

470
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,260
Scott: So it's incredibly difficult to communicate.

471
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,262
Rym: And I can just imagine, well, I know how it is because Emily tells me all the time how frustrating it is to have to

472
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:47,746
Scott: create

473
00:25:48,187 --> 00:25:56,337
Rym: something creative for someone who is unable to tell you what they want and the only thing they can really say is, "No, that's not

474
00:25:56,478 --> 00:25:56,518
Rym: it.".

475
00:25:58,184 --> 00:26:06,219
Scott: All you can really do is just keep making stuff and try to, you know, figure out, you know, sort of inch your way closer to kind of what they want, you know.

476
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,219
Rym: Well, from my perspective and what I've learned...

477
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,700
Scott: You have to do a lot more work than you'd have to do if they were able to accurately express their desires.

478
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,920
Rym: Actually, I think the problem is a lot of people try to have too much influence over their creative people.

479
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,333
Scott: That is a problem.

480
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:21,019
Rym: that also happens.

481
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,326
Rym: Once we said, "Fuck it.

482
00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:23,372
Rym: You're an artist.

483
00:26:23,613 --> 00:26:24,297
Rym: Make us something.

484
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:24,739
Rym: We'll use

485
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:24,840
Rym: it.".

486
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:26,689
Rym: And very quickly we got something.

487
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:29,000
Rym: and once we just said, "We're gonna trust that person's judgment.

488
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,517
Rym: Otherwise, why are we going to pay

489
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:30,699
Rym: them?".

490
00:26:31,365 --> 00:26:33,200
Rym: We got something really good almost right away.

491
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:36,159
Rym: And it wasn't what we pictured originally, but you know what?

492
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,405
Scott: We're not artists.

493
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:38,714
Scott: We're not gonna picture something good.

494
00:26:38,754 --> 00:26:39,660
Scott: That's why we want artists.

495
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,916
Rym: If I could picture something good...

496
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:44,420
Scott: Yeah, if I could picture something good, I wouldn't need the artist, would I?

497
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:45,743
Scott: Alright.

498
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:47,900
Scott: My thing of the day is just one photo.

499
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:49,560
Scott: It's a photo of a trailer.

500
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,658
Scott: And in front of this trailer, there are two signs.

501
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,740
Scott: Well, there's three signs, but two of them are redundant.

502
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,434
Scott: One of the signs says, "Computer

503
00:26:57,474 --> 00:26:57,796
Scott: repair."

504
00:26:58,421 --> 00:26:59,629
Scott: And one of the signs says,

505
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:00,756
Scott: "Tomatoes."

506
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:06,520
Scott: And I could see that being my sort of retirement there.

507
00:27:07,763 --> 00:27:11,555
Rym: It's funny how we're so... I mean, you heard our Thursday show and the questions.

508
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:12,180
Rym: We're ambitious.

509
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:20,380
Rym: And we're constantly fighting for more and striving for more and making more money and doing more podcasts and becoming big and famous and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and take over the world.

510
00:27:21,123 --> 00:27:29,917
Rym: And yet at the same time, we both almost envy the life of, you know, "Have a little house out in the middle of nowhere and tend to the

511
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:30,339
Rym: cattle.".

512
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,497
Scott: Yeah, this is like the Zen of Scott is a trailer that says, "Computer repair,

513
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:36,078
Scott: tomatoes.".

514
00:27:36,702 --> 00:27:37,659
Rym: I can almost say that that...

515
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,336
Scott: "Grow my tomatoes, fix

516
00:27:39,356 --> 00:27:39,720
Scott: computers.".

517
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:41,124
Rym: That might be my perfect light.

518
00:27:41,145 --> 00:27:45,920
Rym: It's like if I could have a little computer repair shot and, I don't know, a little podcast.

519
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,297
Scott: Yeah, just...

520
00:27:48,262 --> 00:27:51,060
Rym: Plus, Scott really likes growing tomatoes and he grows pretty good tomatoes.

521
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,596
Scott: It's not up to you whether the tomatoes you grow are good or not.

522
00:27:54,617 --> 00:27:55,280
Scott: It's up to the plant.

523
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
Rym: It's up to you to a degree.

524
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,140
Scott: All you do is you take a dirt-to-tomato converting machine and you put it in the dirt.

525
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,920
Rym: No, because you have to make sure the machine is well oiled.

526
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,153
Rym: I mean, what if the tomatoes start turning black?

527
00:28:06,173 --> 00:28:07,280
Rym: You gotta give them some calcium.

528
00:28:08,845 --> 00:28:10,760
Scott: If that starts happening, you screwed up already.

529
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:14,090
Scott: It's either gonna work or it's not.

530
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,760
Scott: You just put the pieces together and you wait.

531
00:28:16,103 --> 00:28:17,112
Scott: Yeah, it's not like a...

532
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:27,480
Rym: Right, so we did last week, questions week, and of course we have another four to five hours of questions week to use as filler whenever we go out of town in the near future.

533
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,240
Scott: Some of it already recorded, some of it not.

534
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,020
Rym: Yeah, partly because I was tired and lazy and Scott was also kind of tired and lazy.

535
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:41,940
Scott: Yep, but during the questions week, we got some questions that had such long answers to them, we could just use them as episode ideas instead of questions.

536
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:45,900
Scott: So let's start that up because we didn't have a lot of episode ideas coming up.

537
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,468
Rym: So someone asked us, "What do you

538
00:28:48,508 --> 00:28:48,689
Rym: do?".

539
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:51,138
Rym: I mean, you're obviously technology guys, you know the business.

540
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,320
Rym: "When you make a brand new computer and you install Windows on

541
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:55,380
Rym: it.".

542
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,120
Rym: But we're gonna expand that to pretty much any operating system.

543
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,399
Scott: Yeah, we're gonna do Windows, Linux, and OS X.

544
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,252
Rym: Yeah, I think we'll do those three.

545
00:29:02,696 --> 00:29:03,200
Rym: In that order.

546
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,700
Scott: For a desktop, not for a server.

547
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,812
Rym: Got a new computer, it's your home desktop, yours.

548
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,660
Rym: Not someone else's, not for your mom, but yours.

549
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:11,943
Rym: Alright, it's new.

550
00:29:12,244 --> 00:29:13,648
Rym: I've got the Windows CD.

551
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:16,094
Rym: In what order, like what do you do?

552
00:29:16,616 --> 00:29:17,378
Rym: What things do you do?

553
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:18,080
Rym: What's the order you do?

554
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,434
Rym: It's kind of like when you move into a new house, like what do you unpack first?

555
00:29:21,896 --> 00:29:22,920
Rym: The answer is the computer.

556
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,420
Scott: Okay, well first let's say the things that are true for all the operating systems, right?

557
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,480
Scott: The first thing is I get all the available updates, no matter what.

558
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,340
Rym: To the BIOS.

559
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:36,271
Scott: Okay, the BIOS, but the operating system.

560
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,820
Scott: We're talking about after you install the operating system.

561
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,180
Rym: Alright, so I install Windows, I go to Windows Update.

562
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,066
Scott: Yep, I install Linux, I go to the update.

563
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:42,949
Scott: OS X, update.

564
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:44,675
Scott: I update everything I can update.

565
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:46,140
Scott: All the way to the maximum.

566
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,820
Rym: Now, not like special drives, only the things that the operating system gives you.

567
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:56,940
Rym: Like, for Windows, the first thing I do is go to Windows Update, install everything, reboot, install everything, reboot until there's nothing left to install.

568
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,060
Rym: That my Windows is the most up-to-date it can be.

569
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,420
Scott: Yep, default Windows.

570
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,733
Rym: Now, I don't even install video card drivers or anything at this point.

571
00:30:05,773 --> 00:30:08,220
Rym: Just the bare minimum to boot Windows.

572
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,120
Scott: And the next thing is the video card driver, which you don't need to install on OS X, but you do need to install on Linux.

573
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,493
Rym: The only exception is if you have a motherboard that requires motherboard drivers.

574
00:30:18,015 --> 00:30:19,360
Rym: I will often do that before I do the...

575
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,559
Scott: That's not really applicable anymore because if you...

576
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,814
Rym: My current motherboard did not work properly in Windows XP.

577
00:30:27,055 --> 00:30:28,980
Rym: The USB didn't work for shit.

578
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:31,179
Scott: Even after updating the XP all the way?

579
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,064
Rym: Yeah, USB didn't work for crap.

580
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:36,754
Rym: The hard drives were kind of okay, but not all the controllers worked.

581
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:38,800
Rym: The ethernet kind of worked, but not really.

582
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:42,840
Rym: So, I actually then installed the motherboard drivers.

583
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,628
Scott: That's weird.

584
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:46,478
Scott: That's like a thing of the past, but I guess...

585
00:30:47,326 --> 00:30:48,340
Rym: It depends on the motherboard.

586
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:54,400
Scott: Yeah, but you want to install your video card drivers so you can set proper resolutions and get your 3Ds on and all that stuff.

587
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:59,700
Scott: Even if you have just some sort of integrated video card, you're either going to have an Nvidia or an ATI, most likely.

588
00:31:00,222 --> 00:31:03,180
Scott: And they have a driver, even if it's like the shittiest card in the universe.

589
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:09,100
Scott: And you need that driver to get the stuff to actually work better than the default Windows driver is going to do you for.

590
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,143
Scott: Okay, so next.

591
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:21,840
Scott: Because, nowadays... Back in the day, you'd actually have to install... I remember, even in 2000, 2001, if I had a fresh operating system, I had to install a lot of applications.

592
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:23,044
Scott: A whole mess of them.

593
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:25,433
Scott: Because everything was desktop applications.

594
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:27,280
Scott: And now, everything is web applications.

595
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,774
Scott: I use Gmail, so I don't have to install any email clients.

596
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:32,080
Scott: I use Google Calendar.

597
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,346
Scott: I don't have to install any calendar stuff.

598
00:31:33,386 --> 00:31:34,170
Scott: I use Google Docs.

599
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:35,880
Scott: I don't even need OpenOffice anymore, really.

600
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:38,599
Scott: But, can't use any of those things without...

601
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,384
Rym: Plus, games.

602
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,120
Rym: I used to have to install all my games.

603
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,680
Scott: Now you just install Steam, right?

604
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,780
Scott: And on the other operating system, you're not playing games.

605
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,032
Rym: So, I'll say straight up, this is the exact order.

606
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:50,460
Rym: I installed things at a new computer.

607
00:31:50,581 --> 00:31:54,080
Rym: It's Firefox, and then I'll make sure Firefox is updated.

608
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:56,259
Scott: Then an IM client, depending on OS.

609
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,440
Rym: Actually, now, I don't do that anymore.

610
00:31:58,661 --> 00:31:59,059
Scott: Oh, really?

611
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:06,180
Rym: Now, I just go and get all my Firefox extensions, and then I just use Gmail and the embedded things.

612
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,360
Rym: I don't chat so much anymore.

613
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:15,420
Scott: The embedded thing is okay when I need it, but I use the same Google Chat with the domains thing.

614
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:17,620
Scott: But, I use CoPete on Linux.

615
00:32:17,962 --> 00:32:20,460
Rym: I'd use ADM if I could, because ADM is like the best thing ever.

616
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,124
Rym: I don't know.

617
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:21,749
Rym: I don't care.

618
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:22,394
Rym: It's the duck.

619
00:32:22,555 --> 00:32:23,200
Rym: The green duck.

620
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,200
Scott: The duck, but the duck is only on OS X. You can't get the duck on the other operating systems.

621
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,208
Scott: And in Windows, I actually can't.

622
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:31,440
Scott: There's no more good IM client for Windows.

623
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,298
Scott: I mean, there's Pidgin, formerly known as GAIM, but it's not really as good as CoPete or ADM.

624
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:39,080
Scott: It's kind of crummy.

625
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,400
Rym: Yeah, and part of that, too, is I chat when I'm away from home.

626
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,540
Rym: When I'm at home, I'm usually too busy to chat, except on weekends.

627
00:32:46,843 --> 00:32:48,640
Rym: I don't chat the way I used to.

628
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,540
Rym: I use forums and kind of time-shifted communication instead of real-time communication.

629
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:54,900
Scott: Do you want to go through?

630
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,640
Scott: I know we did a whole show on Firefox extensions, but I'm sure it's changed since that time.

631
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,800
Scott: Do you want to just list the ones you used?

632
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,740
Rym: I installed something to put things in Delicious, which is pretty much just for GeekNights.

633
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,480
Scott: I used the Delicious tag, like the buttons.

634
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:10,860
Scott: Not the full Delicious extension, just the regular, the one that adds two buttons.

635
00:33:11,101 --> 00:33:12,819
Rym: I install Adblock and the Filterset G.

636
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:16,760
Scott: I use Adblock Plus, which comes with its own Filterset subscription stuff.

637
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,637
Scott: I don't need the Filterset G.

638
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,725
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't matter.

639
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:20,560
Rym: Sometimes I do it manually, but the key is Adblock.

640
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:21,479
Scott: Adblock Plus.

641
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,240
Rym: And beyond that, I don't use much.

642
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,120
Rym: I install Farkit because I am still a Farker, tried and true.

643
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:35,040
Scott: I install Google Browser Sync, which is what I use to keep my bookmarks synchronized between my desktop, my work computer, and my laptop.

644
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,800
Rym: If I had a laptop, I would also do that, but because I do not have a laptop, I don't bother.

645
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,819
Scott: What about your home and your work?

646
00:33:40,383 --> 00:33:41,609
Rym: I work, I don't bookmark things.

647
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,375
Rym: The only thing I go to at work is, I mean, I don't read webcomics or anything there.

648
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:45,900
Rym: I do it at home.

649
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,220
Rym: The only thing I do at work is, you know, check my email.

650
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,239
Scott: I check all my sites and all my places.

651
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:51,484
Rym: I just don't.

652
00:33:51,605 --> 00:33:53,540
Rym: I have an RSS feed that I look at the titles for.

653
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,978
Scott: Yeah, I'm looking at my Google Reader at work.

654
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:03,660
Rym: Plus, to be perfectly honest, my new job, I don't think I'm going to be just surfing around the internet because I think I'm going to be doing fun work, like actually enjoyable work.

655
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:09,860
Scott: Then I install Firebug and Web Developer Toolbar, which are for developing web stuff.

656
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,840
Scott: So if you're not web developing, you don't need that shit.

657
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:17,753
Rym: Yeah, I installed that when I was, like, that kind of stuff at RIT, but I don't do web development anymore.

658
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:18,900
Rym: That's kind of Scott's job.

659
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,440
Scott: If you're JavaScripting and CSSing and HTMLing, you need that shit.

660
00:34:22,601 --> 00:34:23,619
Scott: Otherwise, you don't need that shit.

661
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,335
Rym: Yeah, that is now Scott's job in the GeekNights family.

662
00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:28,280
Rym: I work on other things.

663
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,938
Scott: So, other than that, what else do we install here?

664
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,848
Rym: Pretty much nothing anymore.

665
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,815
Rym: I just, I mean, I install Steam.

666
00:34:36,058 --> 00:34:36,600
Rym: I get it going.

667
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,447
Scott: Oh, I got to install the Flash plugin.

668
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:41,020
Scott: I got to install Acrobat Reader, you know.

669
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,699
Scott: And for all those people who are like, they use some other PDF reader, that's fine.

670
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,659
Scott: I still actually like Acrobat Reader, especially the newest versions, actually not bad.

671
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,708
Rym: You know why I didn't think of those?

672
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:57,244
Rym: For all that stuff, to be honest, I don't even think about them until I go to a website or I download a PDF and it's like, "You can't look at

673
00:34:57,285 --> 00:34:57,425
Rym: this.".

674
00:34:57,466 --> 00:34:57,908
Rym: I'm like,

675
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:57,969
Rym: "Oh.".

676
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,840
Rym: And then I install it because it takes a second.

677
00:35:00,823 --> 00:35:03,000
Rym: After all that, I install Winamp.

678
00:35:04,226 --> 00:35:04,920
Scott: I don't use Winamp.

679
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,967
Rym: Or if I use iTunes, iTunes.

680
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:13,607
Rym: Because in Windows, one, I don't listen to music in Windows anymore, but if I did, I'll install Winamp.

681
00:35:13,948 --> 00:35:20,106
Rym: But nowadays, since all my music is in Linux on a riser partition by itself, I just, I don't even bother.

682
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:21,211
Rym: I don't even have Winamp.

683
00:35:21,271 --> 00:35:26,440
Rym: I have no way to play MP3s except the Windows Media Player, which doesn't matter because I'm only in Windows to play Steam games.

684
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,866
Scott: Yeah, in Windows, I have iTunes.

685
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:28,589
Scott: I don't really use it.

686
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:31,220
Scott: I use the iTunes downstairs, but that's only for podcasting.

687
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,488
Scott: In Linux, I use Amaroq for my stuff.

688
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:38,299
Scott: And the thing is, I use all these KDE applications like Amaroq and Copete, but I don't use KDE.

689
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,660
Rym: In Linux, I use Win- uh, yeah, not WinMX.

690
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:42,665
Rym: XMMS?

691
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,391
Rym: XMMS.

692
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,649
Scott: You can use Audacious.

693
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,480
Scott: It's the same thing.

694
00:35:45,861 --> 00:35:47,009
Rym: XMMS is kind of shitty.

695
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,440
Rym: I just use it because I don't care.

696
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:55,280
Scott: Use Audacious or something, you know, what's the other- you could use like Beat Media Player, VMPX, I guess it's called now.

697
00:35:55,581 --> 00:36:00,160
Rym: Yeah, I just haven't bothered because I listen to most of my music on my iPod and not in my room anymore.

698
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:00,460
Scott: Yep.

699
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:06,920
Scott: I also install New Cash, which is available for Windows and Linux to manage my finances, which I store on a thumb drive.

700
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,063
Rym: I might start doing that.

701
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:17,037
Rym: The only reason I didn't is that it's always been my philosophy, once I had money, was that I will spend all the money that I'm going to spend and get everything that I want.

702
00:36:17,097 --> 00:36:17,760
Rym: that is reasonable.

703
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:18,658
Scott: I still do that.

704
00:36:19,031 --> 00:36:19,200
Scott: Yeah.

705
00:36:19,401 --> 00:36:20,238
Scott: I just keep track of it.

706
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:24,900
Rym: And as long as I know that I- I mean, I just- if I ran out of money, that means something's wrong.

707
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,720
Rym: And I don't run out of money, so nothing's wrong.

708
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:32,179
Rym: It's not like- to keep track of my money would never have made me say, "Maybe I should spend less

709
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:32,460
Rym: money.".

710
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:37,947
Scott: No, I don't look at the- my finances or accounting and make decisions like, "Oh, I should spend less money.

711
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:38,692
Scott: I'm spending too much

712
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:38,974
Scott: already.".

713
00:36:38,995 --> 00:36:39,800
Scott: I don't even think about it.

714
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,170
Scott: I just keep track.

715
00:36:41,653 --> 00:36:41,995
Scott: That's all.

716
00:36:42,015 --> 00:36:42,660
Scott: I just keep track.

717
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,444
Rym: Yeah, I used to.

718
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:45,300
Rym: Now that I make a lot of money, I probably will again.

719
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:45,701
Rym: Yeah.

720
00:36:46,143 --> 00:36:49,340
Scott: Plus I can go and see like how close my student loans are to being paid off.

721
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:50,246
Rym: Well, see, that's the thing.

722
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:52,160
Rym: I have no debt, really, anymore.

723
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:54,680
Scott: But, you know, keep track of my credit card.

724
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,560
Rym: My credit card just paid off every month.

725
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:57,570
Scott: I know, mine is too.

726
00:36:57,732 --> 00:36:58,460
Scott: But I just keep track.

727
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:12,820
Scott: I also use numeric, because what happens- if you try to open up like a spreadsheet and it tries to open up in OpenOffice, OpenOffice is slow to open, even on like my solid state hard drive laptop, even on my dual core at work, right?

728
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:17,140
Scott: So I use numeric, which is a spreadsheet that opens faster and is better.

729
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:20,720
Rym: But yeah, honestly, in Windows, that's pretty much it.

730
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,560
Scott: Oh wait, no, in Windows, there are two other things I install.

731
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,376
Scott: I install Putty and WinSCP so that I can SSH and SCP.

732
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,820
Rym: I often will install Launchy if I'm going to use the computer a lot.

733
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,479
Scott: Oh yeah, if I'm using the computer, I'll use Launchy.

734
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:37,060
Rym: And Sigmund, because I want to have just a thing.

735
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,605
Scott: Actually, I'm tired of Sigmund.

736
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:43,000
Scott: WinSCP and Putty are enough for me, because I just SSH to another machine and use that.

737
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,320
Scott: Screw the Sigmund, which is all cool.

738
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,511
Rym: Well, I use Sigmund mostly for other stuff, like just writing bash scripts.

739
00:37:47,552 --> 00:37:49,860
Rym: if I happen to be in Windows and I need to write a bash script for something.

740
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:51,900
Scott: Oh, I guess.

741
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,640
Rym: Yeah, and when I was learning Python, I just installed Python in Sigmund and was using that.

742
00:37:57,662 --> 00:38:00,400
Scott: Yeah, but you don't even need Sigmund to learn Python in Windows.

743
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,879
Rym: Yeah, I had Sigmund anyway.

744
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,559
Rym: Obviously, I don't have any real important- like there's no other applications that matter to me.

745
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,079
Scott: Yeah, I think that's the point, is that back in the day, right?

746
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:17,779
Rym: You'd be installing your WinMs, and your WinZips, and- I'd go to all the shareware sites and get, like, all the little utilities I used.

747
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:25,680
Scott: I'd be getting, like, different video players and audio players, and I'd have to install, like, six or seven different plugins instead of just MPlayer.

748
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:31,740
Scott: You know, I'd have to go and install, like, RealPlayer, QuickTime, Windows Media Player, Flash, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

749
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:46,300
Scott: A million things all over the place, and now, the desktop matters less and less and less, and this is why- This is what has allowed Linux and Mac to sorta come up on Windows, is 'cause Windows is the king, because your desktop applications really mattered.

750
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:51,460
Scott: And that's what you used most of the time, and they ran on Windows, and that was it, and you used another operating system.

751
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,740
Scott: You didn't have desktop applications, you had nothing.

752
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,408
Scott: Now, it's all web applications.

753
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,540
Scott: Doesn't matter what the hell you use, it's got a web browser, you're good to go.

754
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,377
Scott: I mean, you could use a Wii.

755
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:07,980
Scott: If I was stuck with just the Wii, it would suck, 'cause the interface is kinda, but I could live, I could do all my stuff with just the Wii.

756
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:10,239
Scott: Plus, now that it has USB keyboard support.

757
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:17,160
Rym: So, Linux is kind of a slightly different world because of package repositories in terms of what I install.

758
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:18,359
Scott: Uh, yeah, I guess.

759
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,220
Rym: I mean, and also the fact that there aren't usually as many updates.

760
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:25,420
Scott: Uh, I guess it's just that you do the updates once, like, whoosh.

761
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:32,940
Rym: Yeah, and it just works, I don't worry about it, but after I update a Linux box, I install my podcast crap, but that's just 'cause I'm a podcaster, you guys can ignore that.

762
00:39:33,942 --> 00:39:35,339
Rym: I don't install a lot.

763
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:42,560
Rym: I kinda, it's kind of like, on the Linux box, when I make a new one, I spend most of my time configuring my desktop.

764
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,840
Rym: 'Cause Windows, you know, you get something.

765
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,060
Rym: In Linux, I move stuff around, I make it, like, my perfect desktop, and I spend a lot of time.

766
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:53,000
Scott: Oh yeah, I spend a lot, I go through every single preferences option, I make sure I go to the Firefox preferences, you know.

767
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,400
Scott: But I make sure to set everything, 'cause the defaults are not what I want.

768
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:10,800
Rym: But in Windows, other than making every window list all, like list, and I get rid of all that sidebar crap, and I make it don't hide system files, don't hide hidden files, don't hide extensions from me, and all that.

769
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,180
Rym: Other than that, I don't fiddle with the Windows much, but Linux, I fiddle with everything for, like, four hours.

770
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,158
Scott: Maybe not for four hours, but...

771
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,440
Rym: I fiddle and fiddle and fiddle and I make everything perfect, and then, I really just install applications on an as-needed basis.

772
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,538
Rym: Like, I'm sitting there, and I think, "I wanna do X. Oh, I don't have

773
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:27,679
Rym: X.".

774
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,497
Rym: A lot of times, with the new Linux box, I'll type a command, and it won't go, and I'll be like,

775
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:31,759
Rym: "Oh.".

776
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,400
Scott: There's actually a cool feature that came in, in Feisty, again.

777
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:41,480
Scott: If, let's say, you have a new Linux box, right, it doesn't have Vim, and, well, I guess it does have basic Vim, but it doesn't have, like, gVim, right?

778
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:44,600
Scott: And, you need, if you wanna have real Vim, you gotta install it.

779
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,060
Scott: So, let's say you got a new Feisty fresh install, you type gVim.

780
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,500
Scott: It'll say, "Yeah, we don't got gVim installed, type this to install

781
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:52,560
Scott: it.".

782
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:53,778
Rym: That's hot.

783
00:40:53,980 --> 00:41:03,600
Scott: Yeah, you could type in, like, any command, and, if it's a command, it's real, and it knows about this command, but the package you need to actually run that command is not installed, it'll tell you.

784
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,940
Scott: Like, if you type "lame," like, here, let me do it right now in my gutsy, here, in my laptop.

785
00:41:07,585 --> 00:41:07,733
Scott: "Lame.".

786
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:09,840
Scott: The program "lame" is currently not installed.

787
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,016
Scott: You can install it by typing, "sudo apt-get install

788
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:13,338
Scott: lame.".

789
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:23,640
Rym: Now, think, I mean, just the ramifications of this, that, kind of this on-demand application installation, coupled with the desktop thing, I don't even think about what applications I use.

790
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:29,878
Scott: Yeah, it's not even, like, Windows, where, "Oh, I need an application, go out, search the web, find an EXE

791
00:41:29,938 --> 00:41:30,299
Scott: somewhere.".

792
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:36,058
Scott: It's just, "Type this, and the program will be installed, and let's see how long it takes,

793
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:36,259
Scott: here.".

794
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:45,920
Rym: And thus, we can get into OS X, which is even a different ballgame, 'cause I turn it on, and it's got almost everything I need.

795
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:48,220
Scott: Except a lot of this stuff is kinda crummy.

796
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:48,920
Rym: Yeah.

797
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,099
Scott: At least the iLife stuff.

798
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:58,280
Rym: Yeah, I mean, we're not, like, graphic designers, we don't use all the Photoshop-y things, so, the Mac just does all the basic stuff automatically.

799
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,100
Rym: I mean, I go install Firefox, and I go and, you know, the same kind of thing I do with Windows.

800
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:10,040
Rym: I install Firefox, I install the Duck, I install Chicken of the VNC, 'cause that's the best icon of any open-source program in the history of the world.

801
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,819
Scott: I also, I install the X-Type VNC viewer on anything that doesn't allow Chicken of the VNC.

802
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:16,298
Rym: Ah, Chicken of the VNC.

803
00:42:17,964 --> 00:42:19,180
Scott: It's just, it's so great.

804
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:20,038
Scott: It is pretty great.

805
00:42:20,944 --> 00:42:21,839
Scott: Uh, what else is there?

806
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:22,661
Rym: I don't know.

807
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:28,140
Rym: Other than that, it's weird, OS X, despite being, you know, kinda Linux-based.

808
00:42:28,802 --> 00:42:29,453
Scott: Unix-based.

809
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:29,840
Scott: It's Unix.

810
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,280
Rym: I do it the same way I do Windows, where I go out and get applications and install them.

811
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,219
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

812
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,180
Scott: Like, I go to a- You can go out, get, and install Fink, and then use Fink to install things, you know, in the Unix style.

813
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:51,320
Scott: But a lot of those things are sorta, they work sorta behind the scenes, down in like the, it's weird, OS X feels like it has this dark underworld to it.

814
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,039
Scott: It's like, on the surface, it's the shiny, easy-to-use OS.

815
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,480
Scott: It doesn't give you all the options of a power OS like Windows or Linux, but, you know, it does everything most normal people need to do.

816
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:08,280
Scott: And for anyone who's not a power user, it's beyond awesome for them, because it keeps everything they don't care about out of their way, and it works.

817
00:43:08,923 --> 00:43:12,820
Scott: But if you, you can actually get down to business with it, but it's all hidden, down under.

818
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:36,040
Scott: Like, you start getting in with Fink, you got these terminals opening up, and you got this, this X Windows thing going, and it's starting to do all this weird undercover stuff, and things start to get funky, and it's- That's the part I don't like, because I need to do that stuff, and it sorta gets in my way, because it does sorta treat that stuff as like a second-class citizen to the, I guess, the shiny front stuff.

819
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:40,040
Scott: So, that's, in Linux, you know, everything is an equal citizen, in a way.

820
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:52,220
Scott: And it's a smooth experience, no matter what application you're using, you know, it's not like, "Yeah, you got this weird X Window thing coming, you gotta configure separately, and, yeah, you know, this guy, this application starts that application, and...".

821
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,300
Scott: You know, how much trouble did we have trying to get that challenge run, fire the thing to work on the Mac?

822
00:43:56,942 --> 00:43:59,340
Rym: Yeah, but it looked so good once we got it to run.

823
00:43:59,921 --> 00:44:10,800
Scott: Yeah, I realized what, doing that, you know, why things on the Mac look so good, and it's because if you just write an application, just, you know, just a bleh application that pops a window up, right?

824
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:16,028
Scott: The libraries on OS X are actually written to make it look nice.

825
00:44:16,088 --> 00:44:23,820
Scott: The individual programmers who write applications don't have to do anything extra to make stuff look good in the Apple way, and that's why everything looks awesome.

826
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:38,580
Scott: Because stuff by default, like, you could take an application that's, you know, ready to run on every OS, like a cross-platform app, run it on Windows, run Linux, run on OS X, on OS X it looks great, because it just, you know, the command that says "Open Window" on Linux just opens a window.

827
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,140
Scott: On OS X it, like, fades in a window with the right decorations on it and everything.

828
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:50,480
Rym: Yeah, to the point that now when we do shows, we actually bring the Mac with us, because it's just, it's a better displayer of things than any laptop we own.

829
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,219
Scott: Bus is really small.

830
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:52,082
Rym: Yeah, it is.

831
00:44:52,142 --> 00:44:59,676
Rym: And especially, it's actually smaller and easier to deal with than a laptop, because we don't need a screen for it, we're gonna plug it into a projector.

832
00:44:59,717 --> 00:45:01,460
Rym: We just plop it down, plug it in, turn it on.

833
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,433
Scott: Yeah, the problem is the mouse and keyboard action for it.

834
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:04,420
Scott: We solved the keyboard part.

835
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,480
Rym: Yeah, now we just have to solve the mouse problem.

836
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,220
Rym: We need just a nice Bluetooth mouse.

837
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,920
Scott: But the only one that they have for Mac is that Mighty Mouse, which sucks.

838
00:45:13,303 --> 00:45:13,389
Rym: Yeah.

839
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,315
Scott: So I need a Bluetooth mouse that'll work with a Mac.

840
00:45:16,335 --> 00:45:17,200
Scott: that's not the Mighty Mouse.

841
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:30,940
Rym: But, see, this question would have been a lot more relevant, I don't know, five years ago than it is now, because now I almost feel like, for a techie, what I do with the process of setting up a new computer has gotten easier and easier and easier.

842
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:39,900
Scott: Yeah, and it's sort of gotten less meaningful, in a way, 'cause, like, that's, like, I can just, I reinstalled, when Gutsy came out, I did fresh installs.

843
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:46,280
Scott: I mean, back in the day, if you did a fresh install of Windows, that meant you were gonna have to spend a couple days before you were back, you know, up to full efficiency.

844
00:45:46,362 --> 00:45:46,445
Scott: Yep.

845
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,320
Scott: I'm at full efficiency with a fresh install of frickin' any Linux.

846
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,100
Scott: Like, even Dapper Drake, I'm at full efficiency.

847
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,540
Scott: You know, it doesn't really matter.

848
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:02,500
Rym: And even Windows, I'm there right away, because the only things I need to download or get are pretty much things like Steam and drivers.

849
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:04,240
Rym: I mean, I already use OpenOffice.

850
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,317
Scott: Yeah, I installed Firefox.

851
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,580
Scott: Good to go, I'm done.

852
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:10,901
Scott: Any machine, any computer with Firefox on it, I'm at 100%.

853
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:15,140
Scott: I mean, I can do some tweaks here and there to make it a little bit better, which I do on all my machines.

854
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:17,419
Rym: Firefox is effectively our operating system.

855
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,339
Scott: Effectively, I mean, there were people thinking about making, you know, just disks, you would just boot, and it's Firefox, and that's it.

856
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,980
Scott: And I don't, that's such a bad idea, especially not in the future.

857
00:46:27,261 --> 00:46:27,900
Rym: Yeah, we're getting there.

858
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:28,558
Scott: We're getting there.

859
00:46:29,242 --> 00:46:30,620
Scott: Alright, is there anything else to say here?

860
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:31,538
Rym: I don't know, I think that's it.

861
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:37,680
Rym: We went long every night last week, so I don't feel bad about not going long tonight, and I'm getting kinda hungry.

862
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,120
Scott: Good, let's go eat and watch stuff.

863
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,690
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

864
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:50,290
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

865
00:46:51,011 --> 00:47:02,190
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com, where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

866
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:08,430
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week, covering four different brands of geekery.

867
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:10,618
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

868
00:47:10,678 --> 00:47:13,130
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

869
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:19,070
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

870
00:47:19,531 --> 00:47:27,590
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com, or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

871
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:31,130
Scott: Just click the link that says "Send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

872
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:36,280
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

873
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,990
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website, which has everything.

876
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,430
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

877
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,990
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
