1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,807
Rym: It's Thursday October 25th.

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:12,710
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,040
Rym: I'm goth and this is goth night tonight.

4
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:17,920
Rym: We got the goth goth goth goth.

5
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:25,387
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:32,512
Scott: So Rym did I get home at my usual time today?

7
00:00:32,873 --> 00:00:34,780
Rym: Uh no you got home a little bit late.

8
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,505
Scott: Oh, why do you think that might be?

9
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:37,407
Rym: I don't know.

10
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:42,040
Rym: maybe because I lost all track of time not being at work today.

11
00:00:42,703 --> 00:00:44,008
Scott: No, no that wasn't it.

12
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:45,715
Scott: I actually did get home late in usual.

13
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:54,091
Rym: It's hard to say I mean It feels like it was I don't know years ago that you went to work And I've just been living in this house all this time.

14
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:56,240
Scott: Yeah, that's what it feels like when I'm home sick.

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,585
Scott: It's except.

16
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:58,308
Rym: I'm not sick.

17
00:00:58,629 --> 00:00:59,171
Rym: It's great.

18
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:01,360
Scott: Yeah, it won't be great in another week or so.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,772
Rym: Yeah, you gotta go back to work, but I gotta keep going back to a job.

20
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:11,259
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but anyway I leave work and as usual I go down in the subway, and I wait for the choo-choo.

21
00:01:11,982 --> 00:01:14,793
Scott: So I'm waiting and I'm waiting and sometime.

22
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,520
Scott: you know some days you go wait longer than others.

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:23,299
Scott: But this day I had waited about the usual waiting time you know and it sort of passed And it's like huh, I've never had to wait this long.

24
00:01:23,802 --> 00:01:32,380
Scott: I realized not only was my train not coming the uptown six train I hadn't seen a single four or five or six train go by in either direction.

25
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:36,091
Scott: That's not good, and the platform was getting mighty full.

26
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:41,034
Scott: and since I was not at a major Express stop There weren't so many announcements going on.

27
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:43,628
Scott: and usually if the already Didn't you think it would matter?

28
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:46,100
Rym: the last time I heard an announcement on the subway?

29
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:53,504
Scott: it was attention passengers Delay In some places.

30
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:56,935
Scott: you can hear the announcements if we're at Grand Central at 14th Street.

31
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:57,617
Scott: You can hear the announcement.

32
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:58,540
Rym: I don't know where else.

33
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:02,393
Scott: So it also depends a lot on the person using the intercom.

34
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:04,180
Scott: you know and how well how good they are at it.

35
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,226
Rym: I love the guys on the subway itself.

36
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:06,627
Rym: like that.

37
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,580
Rym: the actual trains who they'd make stop burger burger next up.

38
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,308
Rym: We're so little effort in.

39
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:14,920
Rym: they're like next opposite next up is gonna.

40
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:20,650
Scott: Yep, anyway Eventually the train comes.

41
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:22,299
Rym: so did you fight your way onto it?

42
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,684
Scott: No, it actually what.

43
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,693
Scott: it was pretty crowded, but wasn't that crowded?

44
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:29,797
Scott: some people just didn't get on wusses Which is good, and it takes me to 14th Street.

45
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:50,802
Scott: basically They're like announcement announcement something something something and what I gathered from the garbled announcements was that there was some sort of criminal investigation at 125th Street and That they had to turn the power off at 125th Street Which can only mean that there was something involving someone getting pushed on the third rail and police had to go down into the track Probably

46
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:51,746
Rym: just a bum jump.

47
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:53,431
Scott: It could have been a bum jump.

48
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:54,555
Scott: It could have been a bum push.

49
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:55,779
Scott: who knows what it was?

50
00:02:56,685 --> 00:03:03,191
Scott: All I know is that whatever it was Basically caused the four or five and six trains in both directions.

51
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,180
Rym: now for those of you who aren't New Yorkers or Americans or anything?

52
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,600
Rym: The four five six is pretty much the most important subway in Manhattan.

53
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:16,200
Scott: Yeah, it caused it to stop completely pretty much in both directions for a long time.

54
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:25,293
Scott: And you know someone asked us last week during questions week about what we thought about Mandatory minimum sentencing kind of stuff and we said that stuff sucks.

55
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:35,045
Scott: well on the other hand You know obviously there was some sort of crime involved because there's a police investigation right now What the crime was?

56
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:37,880
Scott: it could have been pushing it could have been killing it could have been who knows right?

57
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,082
Scott: It could have been who knows.

58
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:43,959
Scott: but when you sentence someone right you know you take the crime into account.

59
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,300
Scott: someone You know robbed a bank, okay?

60
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:51,056
Scott: I really think that they need to take into account more than they already do.

61
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:55,059
Scott: well Damages caused by your well example.

62
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:21,060
Rym: well I'm gonna say there's been legislation Pending or come up periodically in a lot of places and I read an article a couple years ago where there was one part of Texas where they actually passed a law to this effect where if you're in a car accident yeah, and it's shown that you caused it and like fully like it's your fault and You delay people like they're they're statutory fines to make up for the delays You have caused to the economy as a result of blocking like rush hour traffic.

63
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,769
Scott: Yeah, and this is the thing that I think is good.

64
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:35,813
Scott: actually because you know you can't figure out I mean I guess in an ideal world right you would figure out Every person who is delayed because of the problem you caused and exactly how much Damage it did to each individual person and make you pay them all right.

65
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,937
Rym: the thing is you can't do that.

66
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:57,800
Rym: the thing is then There's these that that almost brings up the problem of the stupid mistake lottery where you know a lot of people drive poorly But not poorly enough to crash every day, but just pretty poorly where you know they're not paying attention And they run a red light or they're not paying attention And they take a turn too fast and usually they're lucky enough like there isn't a car in the other lane.

67
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:08,158
Scott: They and also our traffic system has enough safety buffer is built into it where you can kind of drive shittily and still get Away with it, but a lot of people they they're not driving extra shittily.

68
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:17,939
Rym: one day They just the buffer isn't there and they end up hitting someone and whoa betide You caused the accident the day that Bill Gates is trying to drive through Yonkers.

69
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:19,362
Scott: Yeah, I know.

70
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:28,620
Scott: so I think you know a good solution is just okay since we can't figure out everyone you have to pay Right exactly how much damage you did to each and every one of them.

71
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:33,580
Scott: We'll just take a bunch of your money, and we'll give it to the state and that I guess will alleviate taxes.

72
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:38,416
Rym: I'm of the model the people all their unit of damages should go to the state no matter what.

73
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:43,700
Rym: yeah even better They should go into a specific fund that can only be used for civil infrastructure improvements.

74
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,940
Scott: Well, I guess you know if it's traffic related.

75
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:48,800
Rym: Oh, yeah, and if there are other things then anytime there's punitive damages.

76
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:54,580
Rym: They should somehow be set up where they can only be put toward fixing the problem that caused the crime in the first place.

77
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:01,269
Scott: Yeah, but I mean basically all I'm trying to say is that if you commit a crime You know and you know there's the direct harm.

78
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,493
Scott: your crime does you know?

79
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:02,654
Scott: you?

80
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:05,102
Scott: you robbed a bank you took a thousand dollars in The bank.

81
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:18,560
Scott: well you go to jail for robbing a bank, and the bank gets a thousand dollars back Whatever, but if that caused like you know the bank to close down and now a bunch of small business people couldn't do their Business at the bank all day and that caused all this other trouble.

82
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:21,275
Scott: But you got to take that other trouble into account.

83
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:25,459
Scott: usually it's traffic You know subways and cars because that's the easiest place for this kind of thing to have.

84
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:30,231
Scott: well I thought it happens in other places And I think when you do that we got to let you know.

85
00:06:30,312 --> 00:06:33,711
Scott: look you look at all the trouble you Actually caused.

86
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:34,660
Scott: doing your bullshit.

87
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:36,348
Rym: Well is the thing I mean you pay for it.

88
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:36,569
Scott: cuz.

89
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:40,956
Rym: then the flip side of that is the no harm No foul side of what if you?

90
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:48,417
Rym: Committed a big crime, but the actual damage you it did just by a by chance were very very low.

91
00:06:48,778 --> 00:07:00,159
Scott: well then I Actually think if you know that the something should only be a crime if you're infringing on someone's rights or causing harm And I think well well well well here's the problem with that.

92
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:11,420
Rym: Yeah, if you if you allow no harm no foul in the legal system, then if you Attempt a crime and fail it there's nothing to stop you from attempting it again, and you're not punished in any way.

93
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:18,447
Scott: But you see I think actually Attempting a crime right I guess failing You could.

94
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:19,540
Scott: you could just say okay?

95
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:24,780
Scott: You're you're you know we have to you don't punish them in terms of financial damages like we're taking money.

96
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,840
Scott: Oh, I say look you're a danger to society.

97
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,886
Scott: We need to put you in a jail.

98
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:32,626
Rym: so a low example for I run a red light And I don't hit anyone.

99
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:33,089
Rym: well.

100
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:33,914
Rym: I didn't hit anyone.

101
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:36,567
Rym: no ticket great I'm gonna always run red lights.

102
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:39,500
Rym: cuz the odds are I'm not gonna hit it because now you're a danger to society.

103
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:45,140
Rym: So dangerous society, but you were saying before that oh, we just go after the actual damages you caused.

104
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:46,300
Rym: What if you haven't caught energy?

105
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,804
Scott: I didn't say I mean having.

106
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:50,373
Scott: I didn't say just go after the damage you caused.

107
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:53,948
Scott: I said make sure that people know The damage they caused.

108
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:55,900
Scott: that normally isn't paid attention to okay.

109
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:12,272
Rym: so you want an asymmetric system where you have the fines and punishments for crimes and if you happen to cause a problem for someone else unforeseen like You're in a minor car accident, but because you're in a tiny minor car accident Someone rich behind you has

110
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,960
Scott: nothing to do with someone rich behind you.

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,502
Scott: But it's like.

112
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:15,104
Scott: you know.

113
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,769
Scott: you got to make the person realize.

114
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:24,880
Scott: look you know you you because of your negligence You caused this incredibly large amount of traffic to be packed up for hours.

115
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,958
Scott: They'll care and you have to get to make them realize that if someone caused all that trouble You know make them pay some money to the state.

116
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,020
Rym: But then you set up a system where if you're in an accident in rush hour you ever cause a problem that has unforeseen consequences.

117
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,866
Rym: Freak accidents could.

118
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,335
Scott: it's not an unforeseen consequence.

119
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,159
Scott: It's totally for a scene.

120
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,431
Scott: You know that if you get an accident in rush hour You'll cause a lot of traffic compared to getting in an accident.

121
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:49,139
Rym: Are you going to pay our fine?

122
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,999
Rym: representative of the problems you have caused?

123
00:08:52,862 --> 00:09:00,480
Scott: Not represent, but you know they should just make them realize look We're adding on this extra thing because of all the trouble you cause all you're really bad and sort of encourage.

124
00:09:00,861 --> 00:09:06,179
Scott: You know safer driving during rush hour because make it worse to get an accent or you know stuff like that.

125
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:15,839
Rym: I think the best way around that would be if the police officers who respond to accidents once they know whose fault It was we're just not polite or maybe yelled at him laid into a little bit.

126
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,475
Scott: Maybe I know you don't actually just got to play weeaboo with everyone who I got a.

127
00:09:21,535 --> 00:09:22,739
Rym: here's a great way around this.

128
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:34,580
Rym: if you Cause an accident and the police are able to determine that you cause the accident Which is a science by the way Then you have to appear for whatever length of time at the place where you caused the accident.

129
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:41,380
Rym: So people driving by can see you with one of those puritan signs like the scarlet letter.

130
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:46,455
Rym: That's fine, or you have to wear a badge some kind of yellow badge on your shoulder.

131
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:48,523
Rym: that with a picture of a car I don't know.

132
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:51,191
Scott: I delayed like take those police in.

133
00:09:51,231 --> 00:09:53,358
Scott: was it Taiwan or Thailand?

134
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:57,760
Rym: China Like See I'd wear the Hello Kitty.

135
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:00,469
Scott: I like bots Mars.

136
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:03,940
Rym: I was about to say liking Hello Kitty is just a side effect of liking bots Maru.

137
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,247
Scott: Yeah, I like but tomorrow Hello Kitty sex.

138
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:08,153
Rym: Hello Kitty is kind of awesome though.

139
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:10,440
Rym: Not really can't really underestimate yellow Hello Kitty.

140
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:12,670
Scott: Well, there's that other guy that the pachaco.

141
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,493
Scott: I thought you would like him.

142
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:26,254
Rym: So speaking of Underestimating people the federal government in the United States set up something called the terror watch list You know because Americans are deathly afraid of terrorism.

143
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:33,937
Rym: terror watch this like Osama bin Laden Despite the fact that there really has been almost zero terrorism in the history of the United States.

144
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:44,990
Rym: and you know Oh, there's terrorists everywhere and we got a yeah But yet there hasn't been a terror attack since September 11th, and it's really easy All those terror attacks.

145
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,520
Scott: and weren't there terror attacks in other countries?

146
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:59,320
Rym: Oh, yeah Cuz remember we arrested those kids who were on vacation and then we looked at their vacation footage and said yeah They were filming Disneyland so they could blow it up, but it's just films of them laughing and running around Disney anyway.

147
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:09,134
Rym: So we've set up this terror list where people who were suspected terrorists are on the list and we like give them extra scrutiny and if they try to fly we don't let him.

148
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:12,730
Rym: and Well, there's almost a million people on that list.

149
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:12,990
Rym: Now.

150
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:14,174
Scott: There's a million terrorists.

151
00:11:14,315 --> 00:11:14,696
Scott: Oh, man.

152
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:15,900
Scott: We're in big trouble the curt.

153
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,132
Rym: There are seven hundred and fifty five thousand people on the terror watch list.

154
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:23,080
Rym: They've adding an average of two hundred thousand people per year.

155
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:30,980
Rym: 548 people every day as far as our government concerned become terror suspects.

156
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:36,812
Rym: uh-huh, uh And even better all the studies they've been doing lately.

157
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:38,658
Scott: So when is everyone gonna be a terrorist?

158
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:39,180
Scott: what year?

159
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,659
Rym: I think I think it's kind of like when I was in high school and they had student of the week.

160
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:50,280
Rym: and I remember I was like, oh great student of the week cuz someone cool was student of the week The first week of school.

161
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:54,239
Rym: but then Some and they someone else was student of the week and someone else was student of the week.

162
00:11:54,924 --> 00:12:03,440
Rym: And then I discovered that they've set it up to where effectively Every single person in the school will be student of the week at some point in their four years.

163
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,272
Rym: They keep track everyone gets it.

164
00:12:05,553 --> 00:12:06,459
Rym: Everyone gets it once.

165
00:12:08,884 --> 00:12:10,314
Rym: Yeah, so this terror watch list.

166
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:13,859
Rym: I Don't know what else I can say about this news.

167
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:14,542
Rym: It's just.

168
00:12:14,663 --> 00:12:17,634
Rym: it's staggering to me that it still exists and even better.

169
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,200
Rym: It doesn't even work.

170
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:23,644
Rym: They do a bunch of studies and they show the people on the list can just get on planes anytime They want.

171
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:26,038
Scott: the answer to this is obvious, right?

172
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:26,781
Scott: They date.

173
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:30,097
Scott: somebody decided that it was a good idea to come with this list.

174
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:35,760
Scott: some politician You know would would use this list like I made this list as part of their campaign to show how tough they were in terrorism.

175
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,713
Scott: Whatever right politics generated this list.

176
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:43,979
Scott: someone in the government It's their job to manage this list and then I want to lose their job.

177
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:47,396
Scott: So they're just constantly adding people to list and that that explains the whole thing.

178
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:48,320
Scott: It's just bureaucracy.

179
00:12:48,401 --> 00:13:00,877
Rym: What's great is the list is really poorly done like there are so many cases you can see these on FARC all the time where like an Infant will be denied from flying because it happens to have the same name as some guy who might be a suspected terrorist.

180
00:13:01,218 --> 00:13:05,109
Rym: Yeah Awesome, yeah, the u.s.

181
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:10,651
Rym: Is really kind of great right now, but luckily I Think it's gonna come to an end because I'm not.

182
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:14,687
Rym: I wanted to talk about politics for my news But Scott didn't want me to for some reason.

183
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:20,191
Scott: I'm just kind of tired of it all but in the u.s That the Republican everyone knows it sucks GeekNights.

184
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,020
Scott: talking about it isn't telling anyone anything new.

185
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:24,621
Rym: I'll enlighten everyone out there who may not be a u.s citizen.

186
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:29,799
Rym: the Republicans in the United States are currently almost unelectable and don't have any candidates.

187
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:37,300
Rym: so Their reign is over and it's pretty much for the presidency coming down between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.

188
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:44,460
Scott: And you know be awesome like if like if Hillary gets like Democratic nomination or something like Obama goes Republicans something like that.

189
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:45,949
Rym: I don't think that's gonna happen.

190
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,016
Scott: No, but that'd be crazy cool.

191
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:51,239
Rym: Yeah But but I but I thought Ron Paul was gonna save the day.

192
00:13:52,702 --> 00:13:57,512
Scott: Yeah, I think Ralph Nader and Ross Perot win before Ron Paul.

193
00:13:57,732 --> 00:13:58,754
Rym: god Ralph Nader.

194
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:01,118
Rym: yeah, you were cool in the 80s.

195
00:14:02,527 --> 00:14:03,356
Scott: He's really tall.

196
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:06,467
Scott: Someone is freakishly tall.

197
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:07,732
Scott: I saw Ralph Nader once.

198
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:08,856
Scott: he could like fucking play.

199
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:09,760
Scott: He's like Michael Jordan.

200
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:14,795
Rym: He's really thin though like really kind of gangly and skeletal like Michael Jordan like Skeletor.

201
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:16,500
Scott: Yeah, he's also old.

202
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:17,600
Scott: He's like 60 something.

203
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:22,070
Rym: Yeah, I think that's all we have to say holding tall.

204
00:14:22,637 --> 00:14:32,379
Rym: so this guy in 1955 named Homer Jacobson You know you said Homer Jay and the fact that you didn't say Simpson through my brain for a loop.

205
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:35,812
Scott: Jacobson not Jake Simpson, but Homer Jay.

206
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:37,780
Rym: the Simpson comes next anyway.

207
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:45,417
Scott: He was a chemistry professor in Brooklyn, and he wrote a scientific paper entitled information reproduction in the origin of life.

208
00:14:45,437 --> 00:14:49,650
Rym: and The paper may or may not have been so great.

209
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,155
Rym: It wasn't so great actually.

210
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:51,576
Scott: well.

211
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:58,236
Scott: He's in the paper He's speculated on the chemical qualities of Earth in the hedean time which is billions of years ago, and such-and-such.

212
00:14:58,296 --> 00:14:59,480
Scott: right regardless.

213
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:12,375
Scott: Some creationist nutjobs saw his paper written in 1955 and they decided that because of this one scientific paper That creationism is true, and here's the evidence this one scientific paper.

214
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:18,628
Scott: now I Don't want to go into the usual Creationist you know stuff of why they're wrong.

215
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:22,440
Scott: because they're wrong they're wrong, but I do want to say one thing here, right?

216
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,992
Scott: If the creationist right it's it.

217
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,600
Scott: This is so backwards.

218
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:33,250
Scott: There they say the science is wrong And then you use a scientific paper to say that science is wrong.

219
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:40,020
Scott: you if you say the scientific paper is right because it's scientific Then all the other things that you disagree with are right because they're scientific.

220
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,746
Scott: It's like you can't have it both ways.

221
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:45,860
Scott: you can't use some scientific papers as evidence and some are just bullshit.

222
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:55,800
Rym: You know it's a course like the less like Lesson we learned in the new game from valve called portal where you can't have your cake and eat it, too.

223
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:57,428
Scott: It's much less.

224
00:15:57,468 --> 00:15:58,597
Rym: you have a portal gun.

225
00:15:58,617 --> 00:16:01,149
Scott: well It's sort of like how you know they treat their Bible.

226
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:07,478
Scott: they sort of pick and choose the parts they want and they think they Can do the same thing with science, and they don't realize it's it's sort of an all-or-nothing.

227
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:10,980
Scott: you either You know you don't have to be here to every scientific paper is all true.

228
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:18,560
Scott: But you the fundamental tenets of science and the scientific you know process you either go by them, or you don't.

229
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:20,505
Scott: You can't really.

230
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:21,650
Rym: so why did he?

231
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:23,700
Rym: why specifically did he retract the paper?

232
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Scott: I didn't actually say retracted the paper yet, but he retracted the paper.

233
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:32,115
Rym: So why Scott did he I mean did he do it just because the creationists were using it?

234
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:33,680
Rym: did he do it because the paper?

235
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:35,107
Rym: Was old and incorrect?

236
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:42,920
Scott: well it actually says here that Dr.. Jacobson's retraction is the noblest is in the noblest tradition of science.

237
00:16:43,863 --> 00:16:46,020
Scott: This is according to the editor of American scientist.

238
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:56,020
Scott: They said that his letter shows The distinction between a scientist who cannot let errors stand no matter the embarrassment or of public correction.

239
00:16:56,141 --> 00:17:07,153
Rym: All right, well I people who cling to dogma I've actually been reading more about this and yes the paper has many wrong assertions in it and the scientist who wrote it basically said You know what I mean.

240
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:14,458
Scott: it was written in 1955 and contrary to a creationist would have you believe Older information is not more correct.

241
00:17:15,723 --> 00:17:18,640
Scott: You know it's like they always act like this is older.

242
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,185
Scott: It's ancient wisdom therefore.

243
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:27,165
Rym: It's more correct if we go find how older religion is then Christianity's got Some competition from the Jews.

244
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:30,416
Scott: it's got the Jews a competition from like.

245
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:36,403
Rym: I guess you know cyclopeans Zeus might have something to say.

246
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,364
Scott: yeah this paper.

247
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:44,841
Scott: I guess in 1955 was you know legitimate science, but since then We've learned better than that and we realize it's not so right.

248
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:49,909
Scott: and since it's being used in a bad way This guy was was smart and he got rid of it.

249
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:59,560
Rym: But I think is I don't think it was that noble of him because he's old enough to where he's not going to lose any Fame or any prestige by retracting a fan.

250
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:05,141
Scott: actually I think the problem of him Retracting the paper is now that creationists go.

251
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:06,025
Rym: Oh look.

252
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:07,390
Scott: Yeah, they had some science.

253
00:18:07,491 --> 00:18:10,626
Scott: That was that was proven us us right and now they were attracting it.

254
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:11,350
Scott: yeah look at that.

255
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:16,587
Scott: Yeah, and it's sort of giving them more ammo with their crazy conspiracy logic even though real logic.

256
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:17,370
Scott: that doesn't work out.

257
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:20,853
Scott: Yep It's funny.

258
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:24,489
Scott: I like the crazy conspiracy nuts right and the creationist sort of disagree.

259
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:26,958
Scott: usually I mean you know they're they're sort of like you know you did.

260
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:34,704
Scott: it seems like the the people on dig who are saying that 9/11 was you know a controlled 9/11 was caused by the fake Apollo moon landing.

261
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:38,230
Scott: exactly and Ron Paul I didn't seem like being covered up by the media.

262
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:43,750
Scott: It doesn't seem to me like there's a big overlap between those people and the creationists, but their logic is the same.

263
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,799
Rym: Anyway things of the day.

264
00:18:53,282 --> 00:19:01,820
Rym: So I'm gonna paraphrase this story because I read it on FARC a couple weeks ago And I just found a link to it again, and you can read for all the juicy details.

265
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:04,406
Rym: It's very Cathartic to read.

266
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:04,989
Rym: this is one.

267
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:07,380
Rym: This is an inspirational story for our time.

268
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:18,893
Rym: This is something that you should hold your head high and just look upon it as an example of how you should live your life Mmm, so basically what happened was a kid.

269
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:23,960
Rym: some teenager went to a convenience store Bought a bottle of malt vinegar.

270
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,159
Scott: I'm all.

271
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:28,209
Scott: Is he gonna cook something what's?

272
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:34,225
Rym: he tried to drink it to get drunk God's sake Vomited all over himself.

273
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:35,649
Scott: That's that's what's gonna happen.

274
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,993
Scott: Don't drink malt vinegar.

275
00:19:37,013 --> 00:19:37,736
Scott: I mean you can't.

276
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,260
Scott: you barely drink regular vinegar.

277
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:39,742
Scott: How you gonna drink?

278
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:48,097
Scott: Oh my god, so I just don't drink malt cider vinegar at least it won't take Or red wine vinegar.

279
00:19:49,908 --> 00:20:02,120
Rym: Okay so The mother of this kid drags the kid into the convenience store and Demands an apology from the clerk who happened to be working there that day for selling her kid this dangerous substance.

280
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:08,514
Rym: clerk says Vinegar no law says I can't sell it to a kid.

281
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:11,810
Rym: I Didn't think he'd drink it.

282
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:13,400
Rym: I'm sorry your kids stupid.

283
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:15,345
Scott: Yeah, tell him.

284
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:29,733
Rym: so woman goes off and makes complaints and gets the management of the store and they're like did the kid told my kid that he could have them all vinegar and that if you drank it he'd get drunk and that it'd be okay to drink.

285
00:20:29,753 --> 00:20:32,704
Rym: and The manager says to the clerk.

286
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:35,312
Rym: Well, uh, since you told the kid to drink it.

287
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:39,610
Rym: You should apologize to the kid and The mother's standing there with the kid.

288
00:20:40,193 --> 00:20:42,344
Rym: and the clerk says Apologize.

289
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:45,801
Rym: I didn't say that the kids making shit up Alright.

290
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:51,500
Rym: now at this point we would have been at an impasse because we wouldn't know exactly what occurred on that day.

291
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:59,803
Rym: But luckily it luckily in store the convenience store had security tech tapes and these tapes recorded audio and video 24/7 nice.

292
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:11,060
Rym: So like the manager of the store and like the big manager like the to the boss and the boss's boss of this clerk Are pretty much like demanding that this guy apologize.

293
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:18,840
Rym: So he's like fine Let's watch the tape and if on the tape you see me it I tell this kid he can drink it.

294
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:33,711
Rym: Not only will I quit my job But I will donate the last months of my salary to this kid and his mom and I'll give a written formal apology and everything alright, so they go and get the tapes and they watch him and Kid walks up.

295
00:21:34,116 --> 00:21:37,131
Rym: Hi Hi, that'll be four dollars.

296
00:21:37,393 --> 00:21:38,819
Rym: Thanks walks out.

297
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:43,174
Scott: Is it is this story like confirmed true or is this like just a tale?

298
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:44,960
Rym: I've seen multiple sources for it.

299
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:47,868
Rym: So it's very likely true at least most.

300
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:49,433
Scott: it could be a little souped up.

301
00:21:49,614 --> 00:21:54,992
Rym: maybe if it's apocryphal It doesn't matter because the moral of the story stands regardless.

302
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:55,815
Scott: Yeah, it's like an ace up.

303
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:57,260
Scott: think of it as like an ace of spable.

304
00:21:57,481 --> 00:22:02,377
Scott: It's whether you know, the lion and the mouse didn't really talk, but you still learn a lesson from it.

305
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:03,120
Scott: That's still true.

306
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:08,889
Rym: So then the mom comes back in with a dad who's a lion *Laughter*.

307
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:23,315
Rym: So now the manager like the manager watch this thing and they see what the clerk saw and what the mom saw and they all saw it.

308
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,369
Rym: and The manager says apologize.

309
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,900
Rym: He just kind of acts like he didn't see what he just saw.

310
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:37,838
Scott: He says apologize to this kid this kid and his mom and he says no Yeah, you tell him it's only a convenience store job, what's the worst you can happen?

311
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:39,709
Rym: yeah Well, I mean, it's kind of a small town.

312
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:41,540
Rym: Like it's a pretty good job for that kind of place.

313
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,859
Rym: I guess you were a teenager, especially if you don't have you know a degree or anything or a Cisco cert.

314
00:22:47,502 --> 00:22:49,799
Rym: Well, actually if Cisco cert that probably a good job for you.

315
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:50,846
Scott: Yeah, but you know what?

316
00:22:50,926 --> 00:22:52,898
Scott: I bet this kid wasn't even supposed to work that day.

317
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,680
Rym: Well, the mother then starts claiming.

318
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:06,899
Rym: The mother starts claiming that the tapes were doctored doctored by the store to cover up the gross malfeasance.

319
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:16,699
Rym: So the manager again is like kid apologize to this mother or we're firing you and the kids like fuck this Your kid's stupid and he leaves.

320
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:19,129
Rym: Yeah Now it would have ended at that.

321
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:25,880
Rym: the manager apparently kept calling the guy Leaving him messages like you're a shitty person for quitting this job on such short notice.

322
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,300
Rym: You're terrible and and you shouldn't have you're made my business suck because you ruin this.

323
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,771
Rym: The Luckily and I never thought I'd say this.

324
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:36,354
Rym: Luckily.

325
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:44,420
Rym: There was a union and Was a union and for the convenience store clerk and also the owner of the whole chain of like convenience stores.

326
00:23:44,500 --> 00:24:00,459
Rym: and one thing led to another and it ends with the kid getting his job back and a retroactive raise the Manager being fired the managers manager being demoted and docked a bunch of pay the woman never getting her apology And I assume the kid is still a dumbass.

327
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,311
Scott: But finally a story with a correct ending now on FARC.

328
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:16,275
Rym: It was funny because half the comments were yeah yeah, yeah, yeah and The other half were Jesus all this trouble and the police getting involved in all this.

329
00:24:16,536 --> 00:24:21,959
Rym: when the kid could he just Apologized swallowed his pride and everything would have worked out and they could just continue down their way.

330
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:31,695
Rym: And my response to that is very simply What kind of life do you live that you lack the simple dignity to stand up for?

331
00:24:31,795 --> 00:24:39,940
Rym: what little pride you have For when someone is lying about your character outright to swallow your pride and accept that?

332
00:24:40,421 --> 00:24:42,147
Rym: That makes you a sad person.

333
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:43,511
Scott: This is how to get ahead in life.

334
00:24:43,551 --> 00:25:00,098
Scott: You find these people who would rather, you know lie and and you know and and You know deprecate themselves and I believe you mean degredate degredate themselves prostate themselves before people and you know and take blame for things that is undeserved.

335
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:03,769
Scott: and and You know have no pride in themselves and no self-respect.

336
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:06,497
Scott: if you find these people take advantage of them.

337
00:25:06,517 --> 00:25:07,339
Scott: That's how you get rich.

338
00:25:08,764 --> 00:25:16,176
Scott: You find these people who won't stand up for themselves No matter what because there's they just don't want to ruffle any feathers because they'd rather just apologize.

339
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:19,799
Scott: and and you say You crack use crack you scratch my car.

340
00:25:20,526 --> 00:25:20,999
Scott: No, I didn't.

341
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:25,500
Scott: Yes You did give me a hundred dollars to pay for the damages and they'll give it to you cuz I'd rather not ruffle any feathers.

342
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:26,605
Scott: And that's how you get rich.

343
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:29,376
Rym: that I skipped over a lot of the details.

344
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:31,445
Rym: if you want to read the story You can find all the links to it.

345
00:25:31,465 --> 00:25:32,711
Rym: I'll link to one of the accounts.

346
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,860
Rym: and yeah, I felt good about that.

347
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,440
Scott: Yeah, I think the moral of the story is it shows you the difference between dignity in dignity and no dignity.

348
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:44,256
Rym: It's like no lack of dignity is the default.

349
00:25:44,296 --> 00:25:44,940
Rym: by default.

350
00:25:45,421 --> 00:25:51,560
Rym: You don't have no dignity except for the basic dignity inherent in being a living thing and being a sentient living thing.

351
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,856
Scott: No, no dignity are is the boss and the people on FARC who don't want to ruffle feathers.

352
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:58,040
Scott: Those people have no dignity.

353
00:25:58,481 --> 00:25:59,925
Scott: They don't care about themselves.

354
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:01,950
Scott: They just don't want to ruffle any feathers.

355
00:26:01,991 --> 00:26:02,151
Scott: Now.

356
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:03,795
Scott: The clerk has dignity.

357
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:05,540
Rym: the clerk straight up dignified.

358
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:06,966
Rym: He is dignified.

359
00:26:06,986 --> 00:26:08,151
Scott: He's double dignified.

360
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:10,180
Rym: He is he is replete with dignity.

361
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:13,153
Scott: Yep, and the mom and the kid are.

362
00:26:13,214 --> 00:26:14,640
Scott: well, maybe not the kid the kids just stupid.

363
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:15,980
Scott: But the mom is indignant.

364
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:24,646
Rym: I I note that the kid while stupid about the malt vinegar is probably smart in terms of lying about the clerk Because he knows his mom.

365
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:28,779
Rym: He of course knows how his mom's gonna react and also Apple not falling far from tree.

366
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,011
Scott: I Just want to point out the kid.

367
00:26:33,112 --> 00:26:34,260
Scott: bargo bargo bargo bargo.

368
00:26:35,402 --> 00:26:36,646
Rym: You know, why'd you bargo?

369
00:26:36,706 --> 00:26:38,132
Rym: everywhere kid drank malt vinegar.

370
00:26:38,172 --> 00:26:38,914
Rym: mom who?

371
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:40,460
Rym: why the fuck kid?

372
00:26:41,582 --> 00:26:46,640
Rym: That guy told me to yeah knowing that the mom's anger would be redirected at the guy.

373
00:26:46,900 --> 00:27:01,040
Scott: It's so weird right the way parents like most parents least that I've seen right if their kid is lot is is You know lying about something they did like, you know, the mom comes like did you spill that all over the floor?

374
00:27:01,963 --> 00:27:02,872
Scott: No, yes, you did.

375
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:03,579
Scott: you're lying to me.

376
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:12,533
Scott: But when it's like, you know The kid blames it on someone else the parent will defend their kid Even if you know, it's like you believe your kid a hundred percent.

377
00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:17,360
Scott: when you think someone else is to blame I think but you'll know your kid is lying immediately.

378
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:29,474
Rym: man, if I come home and drank a bottle of malt vinegar and thrown up all over my house and My tried to say that some guy told me to do it My dad would have just laughed and told me to clean it up pretty much.

379
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:31,324
Scott: Yeah, but yeah I asked.

380
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:35,869
Scott: I actually looked up the definition of you know To make sure because we've been using that word a lot lately.

381
00:27:35,889 --> 00:27:42,872
Rym: Yeah, I think we use it in the very specific sense in The the best way to see it is fat indignant woman.

382
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:44,860
Rym: Yeah, you've met her she's out there.

383
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:52,472
Scott: Yeah, but the actual definition the dictionary is sort of like, you know, if someone's angry about injustice Then they are indignant.

384
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:58,320
Scott: and you know If you take that right then we're often angry about injustice.

385
00:27:58,421 --> 00:28:06,537
Scott: I mean if in this story like, you know The mom and the and the managers had won then we us complaining about that would be technically indignant.

386
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:14,900
Rym: when we complain about Indignance what we are actually complaining about are people who are indignant yet are lacking the initial dignity to give them cause.

387
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:15,964
Scott: It's sort of like.

388
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:19,860
Scott: it's certainly people who are falsely indignant, you know, it's like this righteous indignation.

389
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,665
Scott: We're just sort of like what we have where you know We're in this.

390
00:28:24,845 --> 00:28:28,134
Scott: we're righteous exactly, but our indignity is righteous.

391
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:34,251
Scott: Whereas this lady she was indignant She was upset about what she viewed as injustice.

392
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:37,360
Scott: The problem was is she was on the side against justice.

393
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,196
Scott: So it's sort of this false indignation that makes us so indignant.

394
00:28:41,618 --> 00:28:52,912
Rym: I think falsely indignant people see just they seek perverse justice in order to Justify to themselves their inflated and undeserved sense of dignity.

395
00:28:53,153 --> 00:28:58,439
Scott: Yes, whereas people actually have dignity They don't really get upset because they know they're right.

396
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,772
Rym: So I assume your thing of the day is something about a car.

397
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:04,759
Scott: good because that I told you before.

398
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:07,639
Rym: well Not only that but you've been talking about this a lot.

399
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:11,920
Scott: I've done this I think twice as a thing of the day before but now it's the real deal.

400
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:21,371
Rym: It doesn't matter what your actual thing of the day is I think your real thing of the day is just the same as the previous ones which is the thing I'm about to talk about is awesome pretty much.

401
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:27,880
Scott: the Tokyo Motor Show is Happening very recently maybe a day ago, maybe still now.

402
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:37,957
Scott: I'm not quite sure what the dates are but it basically happened as far as you're concerned and at the Tokyo Motor Show They revealed many cars many many cars all the cars that matter.

403
00:29:38,017 --> 00:29:42,040
Scott: basically One of those cars is long-awaited.

404
00:29:42,744 --> 00:29:52,139
Scott: One of those cars is perhaps the most intimidating Motor vehicle that is street-legal in any country and that car is of course the Nissan GTR.

405
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:54,634
Rym: You know, I'm not like.

406
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:56,603
Rym: I like cars But I'm not like a car nut.

407
00:29:57,024 --> 00:30:07,491
Rym: and but there are a few cars that I picture myself driving and I imagine just this Immensely enjoyable like somewhat transcendent experience.

408
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:11,785
Rym: Yeah, and it pretty much comes down to the RX7 and the GT.

409
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:13,832
Scott: are X7 is not so exciting in real life.

410
00:30:13,872 --> 00:30:14,373
Rym: Yes, it is.

411
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:14,995
Rym: I've been in it.

412
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:16,520
Rym: It's crazy fast.

413
00:30:18,061 --> 00:30:22,500
Rym: It's really scary to be in an rx-7 that's being driven by a competent driver at high speed.

414
00:30:22,941 --> 00:30:26,292
Scott: It's scary to do that in any car, but the GTR.

415
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:28,800
Scott: I'm not gonna tell you everything there is to know about this.

416
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:29,562
Rym: I'll sum it up.

417
00:30:29,623 --> 00:30:30,566
Rym: It's a robot car.

418
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:32,772
Rym: It basically drives for you.

419
00:30:33,274 --> 00:30:35,140
Scott: Well specifically, right?

420
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:42,879
Scott: this is the first ever car to have an Independent transaxle four-wheel-drive system.

421
00:30:43,381 --> 00:30:59,256
Scott: now the original GTR which was you know Semi four-wheel-drive had the Atessa ETS system which is basically a Computer that does traction control to make it so easy to drive the car that you can basically just floor it and turn the wheel Like you're playing grant trees, but

422
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:01,927
Rym: if you start to slip, it'll just correct on its own.

423
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:14,770
Scott: Yeah This independent transaxle four-wheel-drive system, so each individual wheel It's not its own thing and they all wheels have power going to them in varying degrees.

424
00:31:15,552 --> 00:31:16,615
Scott: That that's like.

425
00:31:17,137 --> 00:31:19,785
Scott: that's the technology they ban in f1.

426
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:21,170
Scott: That's what we're talking about here.

427
00:31:21,472 --> 00:31:29,630
Scott: You can literally get in this car being a shitty driver Floor it and just turn the wheel when you get to turns and not even look at the brake.

428
00:31:30,091 --> 00:31:36,850
Scott: You know unless you're going downhill or something crazy and you'll probably beat a guy in a Porsche most likely it is that crazy.

429
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:40,980
Scott: The car is I think $70,000 which is not bad.

430
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:43,269
Rym: I could yeah, you know, I'm not gonna.

431
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:47,944
Scott: of course It's Japan only right now, but who knows the car is not pretty but it does.

432
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:49,670
Scott: it is very intimidating looking.

433
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,076
Scott: It is a scary motherfucker.

434
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:52,220
Rym: I like the way GTR.

435
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,670
Rym: slow cuz they look just powerful.

436
00:31:54,991 --> 00:31:59,910
Scott: Yeah, it looks like it doesn't look like it like a Ferrari like oh man like there's a beautiful work of art.

437
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:03,084
Scott: It looks like you know, it's the personality of the car, which is.

438
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,109
Scott: I'm going to fuck you up.

439
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:08,190
Scott: And like the original GTR there was like a video screen.

440
00:32:08,451 --> 00:32:12,769
Scott: Not really like a video screen to watch movies on but like a screen in the car that we would let you show.

441
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:17,090
Scott: like all These different displays like g-forces and you know different meters and things.

442
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:26,214
Scott: The new one has the same kind of screen only updated for modern times and that screen Not unintentionally.

443
00:32:26,595 --> 00:32:32,049
Scott: all the user interface of that screen was designed by the developers of Gran Turismo, huh?

444
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,199
Scott: Anything else I had to say about this car?

445
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:46,707
Scott: you can just read on the website, but Be on the lookout for GTR's and if you don't really understand the craziness That is the GTR and you know the aura of this beast Scott.

446
00:32:46,727 --> 00:32:47,330
Rym: You want to buy one?

447
00:32:48,171 --> 00:32:49,535
Rym: We could easily afford it.

448
00:32:49,936 --> 00:32:50,477
Scott: we could.

449
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:52,282
Rym: we could share a GTR.

450
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:53,726
Scott: you what am I gonna do with it?

451
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:54,950
Rym: drive it to Otakon?

452
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,016
Scott: Yeah, we're gonna fit our stuff in it.

453
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,005
Rym: We wouldn't need to bring anything.

454
00:32:59,025 --> 00:32:59,989
Rym: We'd have a GTR.

455
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:02,476
Scott: We just saw a car drive.

456
00:33:02,496 --> 00:33:07,217
Scott: you drive my car to Otakon all this stuff and I'll drive the GTR to Otakon and then I'll be there before.

457
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:08,530
Rym: actually I got a better idea.

458
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:12,744
Rym: You drive your car to Otakon with all the stuff in it, and I'll drive the GTR.

459
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:19,510
Scott: Yeah, okay fine But then I'll drive the GTR from Otakon to Wildwood, and I'll be there in like a half hour.

460
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:28,109
Rym: But speaking of GTR's tonight We're gonna talk about something that I've always found fascinating because as you all know has nothing to do with GTR's.

461
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:29,714
Rym: obviously You know I've been doing that a lot.

462
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:30,457
Rym: I do a segue.

463
00:33:30,477 --> 00:33:38,523
Rym: That's just a complete non sequitur, but like speaking of fire water I've had a few that were actually clever, but not many.

464
00:33:38,543 --> 00:33:54,401
Rym: uh-huh right but As you know we were really into the 12 Byzantine emperors podcast and as Many of you should know part of what happened at the with the West the Western Roman Empire fell was that The Visigoths moved in and not getting into all the history, but tonight.

465
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:59,019
Rym: We were talking about the Visigothic invasions of Beacon, New York.

466
00:34:00,229 --> 00:34:02,799
Scott: ah What what century did they come here?

467
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:05,950
Scott: Uh the aughts before or after George, Washington?

468
00:34:07,096 --> 00:34:27,389
Rym: You See there's kind of an inside joke in the crew well in between me and Scott and Emily But we often entertain guests because where we live you know Scott And I have always been kind of the center of the front row crew and while some of you out there friends May be listening might balk you can't pretend that wasn't true as long as we were in college.

469
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,301
Rym: Where did anyone ever gather, but our apartment?

470
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:32,610
Rym: where did anyone ever get together, but around us?

471
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:35,650
Rym: Where did anyone ever go to a con, but if we went yep?

472
00:34:36,893 --> 00:34:39,083
Scott: You know and it's like I remember that time.

473
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:46,590
Scott: if anything proves it remember that time We wanted to go to the city, and we said all right This is what we got to do and the people didn't do it, and then they were like blaming it on us.

474
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:49,925
Rym: I think what proved it more than anything was at the Otakon.

475
00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:56,277
Rym: the first time Scott And I did a panel together, and we lost our voices just from all the GeekNights stuff we were doing at Otakon.

476
00:34:56,319 --> 00:35:07,050
Rym: so we could not talk and the whole crew was gonna go to Wildwood after the con and Scott and I were waiting for Yuko because she had some stuff to do and we were giving her a ride.

477
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:09,398
Rym: So that was gonna take a couple hours.

478
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,789
Rym: the rest of the crew could have left at any time.

479
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:17,850
Rym: They were waiting for us, and they just kind of stood around like waiting for us to make a move.

480
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:19,829
Rym: They were hungry, but they wouldn't go eat.

481
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:21,897
Rym: They wanted to leave, but they just wouldn't.

482
00:35:22,178 --> 00:35:24,286
Rym: they waited for us to give them direction because we didn't.

483
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:25,190
Rym: they just stood there.

484
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:32,990
Rym: Yep, it was beautiful, but all that aside we often entertain large quantities of our Visigothic friends.

485
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:40,870
Rym: We call them Visigoths because we have never had our friends at our house without them permanently damaging large swatches of our house.

486
00:35:41,751 --> 00:36:02,355
Scott: Yeah, I mean you no matter what you do unless you mean It's it's easy to have like a few people come over to your house for like you know a quiet evening and not have anything You know damaged or not have a hard time to clean up Pretty much no matter who you invite even if you invite like a bunch of grandmas over to your house You know if there's a lot of people coming to your house They're gonna fuck shit up.

487
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:07,251
Scott: so you know and the longer they stay there and the more they stay there the more people They

488
00:36:07,472 --> 00:36:07,613
Rym: are

489
00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:15,625
Scott: the more you're gonna need to feed them the more they're gonna need to go to the bathroom the more they're gonna need To shower the more stuff they're gonna bring and the more they're gonna fuck up your shit

490
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:20,202
Rym: stop wonderfully They're coming tomorrow for another weekend.

491
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:22,230
Scott: I wonder how many of them will listen this episode before coming.

492
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,719
Rym: I wonder if any of them will be angry.

493
00:36:24,202 --> 00:36:24,806
Scott: Oh tough.

494
00:36:25,107 --> 00:36:30,126
Rym: Yeah, luckily They've gotten better, but I guess well We'll start at the beginning like before cuz they've gotten better.

495
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:36,050
Scott: anyone complains Let's do it at their house partly because we've been jerks about it, but yeah, we kind of had to be jerks about it.

496
00:36:37,355 --> 00:36:39,241
Scott: How long were we not jerks about it?

497
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:39,643
Scott: years?

498
00:36:40,024 --> 00:36:41,730
Rym: well one thing we did notice is that in colony?

499
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,628
Rym: We didn't care cuz that apartment was in a trash state all the time.

500
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:46,814
Rym: pretty much It was.

501
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:50,733
Scott: it was a college apartment on campus tiny And in.

502
00:36:50,893 --> 00:36:59,028
Rym: it was a dungeon and we'd crammed like 20 people into a building a little room That barely had enough space for two people to live in.

503
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:01,375
Rym: yeah Those were good times.

504
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:03,326
Scott: then again people weren't sleeping in it besides us.

505
00:37:03,587 --> 00:37:04,895
Scott: so much Yeah But it wasn't.

506
00:37:04,915 --> 00:37:06,490
Scott: it was never a lot of people sleeping in it.

507
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,133
Scott: Maybe like one or two.

508
00:37:07,153 --> 00:37:12,970
Scott: remember those two drunk girls wandered in randomly and played DDR with us And they didn't even mess anything up, but not even spilling a drop of beer.

509
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:14,461
Rym: They were probably some of the best houseguests.

510
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:15,126
Rym: We've ever had.

511
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:15,670
Scott: maybe.

512
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:23,229
Rym: Well, I forgot about that until just now, but I didn't I digraph right.

513
00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:28,764
Rym: so We let in addition all that we live central to the front row crew the fruit.

514
00:37:28,804 --> 00:37:35,908
Rym: the crew lives up in Albany and out in Philly and down and and dirt, but we're at that like epicenter of the front row crew.

515
00:37:35,948 --> 00:37:39,810
Rym: so of course Geographically speaking we host Dungeons & Dragons monthly.

516
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:45,388
Scott: Yeah, cuz I mean if we did it in Albany well Then some people would have to drive like three hours, and we would have to drive one.

517
00:37:45,428 --> 00:37:45,710
Scott: ever you know.

518
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:52,319
Scott: But if we had it down in Philly the Albany people have to drive like four hours And we would have to drive like you know an hour.

519
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,550
Scott: so having it in the middle is the least.

520
00:37:54,992 --> 00:37:56,980
Scott: No one has to make an incredibly long trip.

521
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,530
Scott: We sort of get the best average trip time.

522
00:37:59,672 --> 00:38:00,910
Scott: You know keep it low as possible.

523
00:38:01,152 --> 00:38:02,461
Rym: We also have the biggest house.

524
00:38:02,502 --> 00:38:03,630
Rym: well except for ugly Fred.

525
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:08,489
Rym: But that house is inhabited by other people too that might not take kindly to pre-hab.

526
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:08,830
Rym: is a god.

527
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:11,050
Scott: Have a house that is most conducive.

528
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:13,786
Scott: I mean even our house is not conducive to D&D playing.

529
00:38:13,806 --> 00:38:15,770
Scott: if we had a basement It would be so much better.

530
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,212
Rym: You know what.

531
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:20,630
Rym: our house would be perfectly conducive to it if people did not also spend the night

532
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:31,130
Scott: That's true, but yeah our house is not so conducive to it You know, but it's the most conducive house We have that only geeks live in and we can make a ruckus and all that stuff where you know we couldn't really do that.

533
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:44,944
Scott: It's say my parents house You know which is only about an hour from here because well my parents live there, and there's no really big Actually considered because it wouldn't be that much money Just getting a ballroom at one of the hotels near us.

534
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:53,083
Rym: every time we have D&D Yeah, for like you know like half a day and just charge everyone You don't split up the cost and just ready during yeah get catered.

535
00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:54,930
Rym: that we're thinking about doing that in the future.

536
00:38:55,152 --> 00:38:56,101
Scott: It's not a bad idea.

537
00:38:56,444 --> 00:38:59,299
Scott: so yeah I mean we pay a lot of money when people come over.

538
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:01,890
Scott: it's just sort of invisible because it's you know you don't realize.

539
00:39:02,314 --> 00:39:08,230
Scott: Oh, you spend a lot more at the grocery store And you had to buy like you know cups and plates and things and the damages.

540
00:39:09,233 --> 00:39:21,025
Rym: But the thing is our friends We know they're capable of not being Visigoths because when we go to say Wildwood and stay at our friend's Gojo's house and the beach There that place is immaculate.

541
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:26,350
Scott: when they leave it Is a jerk to everybody and makes everyone clean up.

542
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:27,722
Rym: And I guess we learned her lesson.

543
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:32,970
Scott: because sort of threat She sort of threatens because she's like I'm letting you stay at this wonderful beach house.

544
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:41,570
Scott: And just because you're staying at this wonderful beach house You know for free where normally would cost a fortune you sort of feel you know obligated like I'm not paying anything to be here.

545
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:45,226
Scott: I'm gonna be as nice as I can and be as clean as I can and you know what.

546
00:39:45,347 --> 00:39:54,790
Rym: that's what you should do except for Captain Hugh shall not be named who sat in the couch Clipping his toenails into the couch, okay, okay?

547
00:39:54,871 --> 00:39:57,589
Scott: Yeah, but that's what you should do is what I just said and that's what we do do.

548
00:39:58,112 --> 00:40:06,730
Scott: But when people come here you know because you know we're not someone's mom We're you know their friends and not their friend's mom, and we're also just really laid-back.

549
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:12,990
Rym: I mean we sound kind of like her on the show because we're opinionated, but in terms of actually living our lives.

550
00:40:13,071 --> 00:40:15,574
Rym: We're pretty laid-back Very laid-back.

551
00:40:16,055 --> 00:40:19,023
Scott: we care a lot less about the cleanliness than our friend's mom does.

552
00:40:19,364 --> 00:40:23,358
Scott: and because our house isn't you know it doesn't feel Like a privilege to come to our house.

553
00:40:23,398 --> 00:40:26,410
Scott: You know it's not like you're getting to stay on the beach for nothing.

554
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:28,161
Scott: It's like you just go into your friend's house.

555
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:29,228
Scott: It doesn't feel like a privilege.

556
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:30,358
Rym: granted Were I not here?

557
00:40:30,419 --> 00:40:33,504
Rym: Scott would live in abject filth Rym we're not here.

558
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:34,088
Scott: I would live in.

559
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,707
Scott: No, you would live in abject filth, and that wasn't here.

560
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:47,836
Rym: Yeah Well, I sadly our third opinion is out getting food currently so we can't Quarry.

561
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:53,070
Scott: just as actual evidence though I want to say that back in the days when we were in colony right County is pretty much always a mess.

562
00:40:53,652 --> 00:41:05,578
Scott: But whenever any one of us either one of us was out like you know going home or something like that for it Spotless thousand ago, so if any one of us was alone the house is spotless But the two of us together be a mess.

563
00:41:05,618 --> 00:41:07,790
Rym: well part of that was whenever one of us was alone.

564
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:15,310
Scott: It also meant that the rest of the visigoths weren't around either Usually and usually meant we had time to clean and I think if either of us left lived alone.

565
00:41:15,591 --> 00:41:23,470
Rym: We would have time to clean you know and then stuff would be clean, but yeah I just remember that like the first few times we had you know the majority the front row crew over.

566
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:41,629
Rym: We're not talking about a crazy party like our Slightly famous New Year's parties that are kind of epic, but a mess is expected after a party, but just playing D&D That people broke like five glasses and just hit him like and to this day No one ever admitted to it, but we found broken glasses.

567
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,658
Scott: There was a broken glass in the sink.

568
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,143
Rym: someone broke it.

569
00:41:45,665 --> 00:41:46,810
Scott: no one fessed up.

570
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,479
Rym: There was another broken glass behind the couch.

571
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:50,723
Rym: I wasn't sure how it got there.

572
00:41:51,285 --> 00:41:52,208
Rym: things were knocked over.

573
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:56,518
Rym: there were spills Everywhere dirty dishes everywhere half-eaten food.

574
00:41:56,578 --> 00:41:56,738
Rym: ever.

575
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,010
Rym: I found more half full cans of soda than I found empty cans.

576
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:02,119
Scott: That's something that you know.

577
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:03,390
Scott: people sort of fight with me on this.

578
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,545
Scott: But you know the way I drink beverages Scott is a freaking weirdo.

579
00:42:06,585 --> 00:42:10,382
Scott: people say is weird And it is different from everyone else, so I'll just let that go for now.

580
00:42:10,824 --> 00:42:21,230
Scott: and when I drink something I either use a cup right out, and if I do use a cup I fill the cup with beverage and then I hold it in my hand until it is done And that usually doesn't take very long.

581
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:25,444
Scott: I usually drink the whole thing in one go or two goes at the most you know.

582
00:42:25,604 --> 00:42:30,464
Scott: like if it's something particularly difficult to drink I guess hot chocolate takes me a while to drink because I don't to burn my see.

583
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:31,348
Rym: you're just weird real.

584
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:33,821
Rym: people Have a glass and they like to nurse a drink.

585
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:37,830
Rym: you set it down on a coaster somewhere And you just you drink it while you're being social right?

586
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,073
Rym: But I like beverages.

587
00:42:39,134 --> 00:42:47,963
Scott: people when they come over they seem to have a it's not just you know nursing a drink or What it is they want unattended, and they never go back to it.

588
00:42:48,224 --> 00:42:57,730
Rym: one is that I have a well Extensive collection of liquor right like I basically have a fully stocked bar and I really I can make any normal drink.

589
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:03,748
Rym: The only drinks I can't make are drinks that only old men like really old men make a Harvey Wallbanger.

590
00:43:03,808 --> 00:43:14,210
Rym: Yeah Harvey Wallbanger is not good But I can make all normal drinks.

591
00:43:14,311 --> 00:43:20,230
Rym: I can't make stupid frat boy drinks because those drinks are stupid And I can't make frou-frou drinks because those drinks are also stupid.

592
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,470
Rym: I can make normal drinks and everyone seems to want to drink and that's fine.

593
00:43:24,992 --> 00:43:31,823
Rym: But everyone will like want to drink something different and everyone will make like a weird drink And then they'll only drink like a little bit of that drink.

594
00:43:31,863 --> 00:43:38,330
Rym: then they'll want to make another weird drink And then I'll find like eight half-finished drinks, and that's a lot of liquor that people wasted.

595
00:43:39,331 --> 00:43:52,248
Scott: Yeah, and not only that but it's like the thing that bothers me the most is not that you don't finish your drink right It's if you don't finish your drink at least you know even if it's expensive liquor And you feel bad just dump it down the sink and wash the glass or something you know.

596
00:43:52,268 --> 00:44:01,767
Scott: yeah They take this glass they leave glasses and cans Half full or mostly full or even untouched and then they walk away from them.

597
00:44:01,988 --> 00:44:10,070
Scott: at least if you're good Gonna hold on to it and drink it pick it up Carry it with you where you're going and set it down someplace new and don't set it in a precarious position.

598
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,662
Scott: I mean how many times has there been like a half full can of soda?

599
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:16,096
Scott: someone just leaves it on the floor And then it tips eventually?

600
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:20,370
Scott: yeah, and it's like you don't know especially with an aluminum can if it's full or empty.

601
00:44:20,837 --> 00:44:21,427
Scott: There's no way to know.

602
00:44:22,232 --> 00:44:30,050
Rym: Yeah, the other fun thing was that until we just luckily we don't eat or we actually don't eat or drink What the rest of the visigoths eat or drink anymore?

603
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:38,899
Rym: Which has kind of saved us a lot of money because we really in our fridge is just juice and seltzer water and Very and Red Bull and pretty much nothing else.

604
00:44:38,919 --> 00:44:43,781
Scott: because they drink all those $2 Red Bulls and don't even think you know it's like You go to a restaurant with someone right.

605
00:44:44,043 --> 00:44:47,103
Scott: they actually think you know Oh, we should you know split if you share something.

606
00:44:47,123 --> 00:44:48,050
Scott: they feel like they should split it.

607
00:44:48,191 --> 00:44:50,409
Scott: You know you buy someone something I feel like they should pay you back.

608
00:44:51,253 --> 00:44:56,682
Scott: But if they drink a Red Bull out of your fridge Which is $2 the Red Bull is more expensive than most of the liquor.

609
00:44:56,762 --> 00:44:57,524
Scott: I own I know.

610
00:44:57,585 --> 00:44:58,487
Scott: it's like you know.

611
00:44:58,728 --> 00:44:59,290
Scott: it's so weird.

612
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:01,570
Scott: It's like they feel like like if we have a bag of cookies.

613
00:45:01,892 --> 00:45:04,327
Scott: They feel like oh, we can eat their cookies, and they just eat them.

614
00:45:05,252 --> 00:45:07,240
Scott: What if those are like $10 cookies?

615
00:45:07,562 --> 00:45:14,990
Rym: well if I'm just if I'm at someone's house And I want to drink I usually ask the host or the person like could I have something to drink unless it's a house that?

616
00:45:15,511 --> 00:45:21,239
Rym: I you know family and even then I can say like yeah, I drank some of your orange juice or usually I just drink water.

617
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:21,803
Scott: well.

618
00:45:21,823 --> 00:45:23,892
Rym: That's cuz you're weird Whatever.

619
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:35,350
Rym: I drink other things as most people do but luckily we don't drink soda anymore like crap soda High fructose corn syrup water yeah, and even worse the lot of them drink diet soda Which I still I don't get that times a million.

620
00:45:35,471 --> 00:45:36,749
Scott: Yeah, it's just fucked up.

621
00:45:37,232 --> 00:45:41,209
Rym: And I remember that they once we stopped having things that like I just don't keep dr.

622
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:52,090
Rym: Pepper or anything around anymore And I actually hide my Red Bull and all my fancy boiling sodas and things whenever they come and as a result they always open the fridge Stare and the fridge is fully stocked.

623
00:45:52,455 --> 00:45:54,896
Rym: There's a lot to drink But nothing they like.

624
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:59,355
Rym: they need high fructose corn syrup water and then they go out and buy a bunch And then they drink it all warm.

625
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:04,328
Scott: and now we know that if we see a high fructose corn syrup undrunken It wasn't us.

626
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:09,889
Rym: I think they drink about half of what they buy and they leave the rest in unfinished cans all over the house.

627
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,414
Scott: maybe maybe All right.

628
00:46:14,534 --> 00:46:19,419
Scott: anyway on the show we're gonna tell you I guess the rest of the time we have gonna We already do.

629
00:46:19,439 --> 00:46:20,123
Scott: we have time left.

630
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:21,089
Scott: Yeah, we got time all right.

631
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,436
Scott: I'm gonna tell you some tips.

632
00:46:22,797 --> 00:46:27,481
Scott: if you want to have Goths come over to your house how to Keep your house from getting totally destroyed.

633
00:46:27,864 --> 00:46:28,065
Scott: rule

634
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:33,532
Rym: number one While I mean I'd like to drink especially real drinks like alcohol I like

635
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:35,973
Scott: how most of it is just involving drinks But there's a lot more than that

636
00:46:36,515 --> 00:46:42,161
Rym: out of glass glasses like nice tumblers or you know wine glasses or whatever And if you're having a nice party you should do that.

637
00:46:42,181 --> 00:46:50,309
Rym: if you have a few friends over you should do that But if you can't if your friends can't be trusted to return glasses to the kitchen or to not break them.

638
00:46:51,232 --> 00:46:56,510
Rym: Red solo cups yep give every one of the start one red solo cup write their name on it, and that's it.

639
00:46:56,963 --> 00:47:03,319
Scott: Yeah And say you're not getting another one and they have to clean that one out or they have to at least like show you like I'm throwing this away.

640
00:47:03,339 --> 00:47:05,150
Rym: I want to drink something different.

641
00:47:05,372 --> 00:47:07,130
Rym: Hey, I have another red solo.

642
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:12,226
Scott: I think the first rule though is is only be as mean and jerkish as you have to be.

643
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:16,045
Scott: it's like you know if they Keep it relatively clean, and you don't have to jerk them around.

644
00:47:16,085 --> 00:47:16,850
Scott: don't jerk them around.

645
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:22,430
Scott: But it's sort of like wait, and then you know as their level of you know gothicness goes up.

646
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:25,050
Scott: You know increase your level of Jerusalem is to counteract.

647
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:25,772
Rym: We'll give you the levels.

648
00:47:25,812 --> 00:47:27,637
Rym: level one your real glasses.

649
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:32,129
Rym: level two your crappy plastic glasses that are only used when friends come over.

650
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,659
Rym: level three pile of red solo cups.

651
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,570
Rym: level four named red solo cups.

652
00:47:37,872 --> 00:47:39,989
Scott: Yeah, level five you treat everyone like children.

653
00:47:40,832 --> 00:47:43,019
Rym: Sippy cups sippy cups god.

654
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:44,625
Rym: We should buy sippy cups.

655
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:48,253
Scott: good not a bad idea All right.

656
00:47:48,855 --> 00:47:58,050
Scott: next thing you got to do when the gods come over is sort of like you know you You got to make people realize you know how much money it you know they're costing.

657
00:47:58,271 --> 00:47:58,513
Scott: I mean

658
00:47:58,654 --> 00:48:09,240
Rym: when we first the first time we had D&D at our house And we said like we'll provide all the snacks and everything we provided literally like $300 worth of snacks and drinks all told for the weekend,

659
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:15,770
Scott: and then we said you know we expect that when you guys come here Next we're not gonna provide snacks and drinks you will provide your own.

660
00:48:16,111 --> 00:48:17,637
Scott: So what do they bring next time?

661
00:48:17,657 --> 00:48:21,010
Scott: look at the level that we have provided and you will get an idea of the level we?

662
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,092
Scott: Expect you to provide.

663
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:34,106
Rym: we provided breakfast lunch dinner snacks drinks everything yep for the whole even got the high quality brand of Hot dogs and blankets instead of the low quality store brand, and I made hors d'oeuvres, and it was.

664
00:48:34,147 --> 00:48:35,010
Rym: it was a nice time.

665
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:48,190
Rym: So uh the next time People cooked something and made a big mess and didn't clean up after it, but that's a whole separate problem Yep, but it wasn't that much money worth of and it wasn't enough food for everyone so we had to supplement.

666
00:48:48,351 --> 00:48:52,650
Rym: So we basically ended up spending about a hundred dollars worth of our snacks anyway.

667
00:48:53,451 --> 00:48:58,310
Rym: Yep, fast forward to the third time no one brought anything, and they ate all our food.

668
00:48:58,751 --> 00:49:02,943
Rym: yeah, fast forward to the foot the next time people came and we didn't.

669
00:49:03,244 --> 00:49:15,314
Rym: we made sure that all our food was hidden and Everyone was super hungry the whole time and no one they brought like crappy like you know those really cheap like sour cream rumple whatever Potato chips.

670
00:49:15,395 --> 00:49:16,400
Scott: I hate any of those.

671
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,425
Scott: like I like snack food.

672
00:49:17,445 --> 00:49:21,790
Scott: You know don't get me wrong You know as much as I rag on fast food and unhealthy snack foods and shit.

673
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:24,200
Scott: Yeah, I like me a pretzel or a potato chip.

674
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,666
Scott: You know I've changed chips.

675
00:49:25,786 --> 00:49:25,886
Scott: when

676
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:29,792
Rym: I was in high school I could eat like a whole bag of Cheetos Yeah,

677
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:37,798
Scott: but any of that stuff that has like the flavoring like if it's a real potato chip I'm down, but if it's like one of those flavor potato chips I mean is what is a difference?

678
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:40,187
Scott: like like you have some actual like onion dip.

679
00:49:40,207 --> 00:49:40,770
Scott: that's good stuff.

680
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:45,147
Scott: But like the fake flavor powder is really what bothers me the most.

681
00:49:45,247 --> 00:49:48,159
Scott: even if it's a flavor I like it's like I can't eat fake flavor powder.

682
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:49,083
Scott: all tastes like combos.

683
00:49:49,144 --> 00:49:50,027
Scott: It's disgusting.

684
00:49:50,168 --> 00:49:55,588
Rym: Oh god Well, I think our issue was and of course this is just turned into awesome bitch about our friends for an hour.

685
00:49:55,869 --> 00:49:57,594
Rym: awesome So easy episode.

686
00:49:57,614 --> 00:50:06,369
Rym: something potato chips right we provided the dark russets like the nice fancy awesome potato chips And then when it's their turn they brought the cheapest.

687
00:50:06,389 --> 00:50:09,047
Rym: well I guess the second cheapest potato chips you can buy.

688
00:50:09,067 --> 00:50:12,960
Rym: yeah Basically the store-brand stuff yeah, and we provided like dr.

689
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:14,064
Rym: Pet like real soda.

690
00:50:14,385 --> 00:50:15,669
Rym: They brought like dr.

691
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:23,173
Scott: W Dr.. W. Actually, you know Wegmans had a great selection of store brands even though I never drank it.

692
00:50:23,555 --> 00:50:25,644
Scott: they had a wide selection of store brand stuff.

693
00:50:25,664 --> 00:50:26,689
Scott: shop right does not have that?

694
00:50:26,749 --> 00:50:27,333
Rym: no It doesn't.

695
00:50:27,413 --> 00:50:28,621
Scott: it does not really like a dr.

696
00:50:28,842 --> 00:50:31,112
Scott: S. You know they don't have Mr..

697
00:50:31,132 --> 00:50:34,590
Rym: Pibb, but even then that Wegmans stuff wasn't as good as actual soda.

698
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:43,528
Rym: But then again none of that is good as you know like boiling soda, but that stuff's expensive And no one's gonna bring that to our house, so there's no way I'm gonna provide that to my friends anymore.

699
00:50:43,548 --> 00:50:46,210
Scott: Yeah Yeah, what else you do?

700
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:50,866
Scott: I guess if you really have to you can like duct tape your like fridge and your cupboards shut.

701
00:50:51,127 --> 00:50:52,113
Scott: you know to sort of be Like.

702
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,114
Scott: you know cuz someone walks up You know they don't even think.

703
00:50:54,134 --> 00:51:01,021
Rym: you know we did that and one of our friends Came up to me in my room like Friday night and says hey Rym.

704
00:51:01,803 --> 00:51:16,801
Rym: I was looking for glasses, and there was tape I don't know where it came from on your cupboard, so I cut it all and yeah And I was like oh god Like didn't you think maybe that tape was for you.

705
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:17,845
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like.

706
00:51:18,106 --> 00:51:19,070
Scott: you know you put the.

707
00:51:20,351 --> 00:51:23,945
Scott: What you had to do if you're hosting anything is you put the stuff out that people are.

708
00:51:23,985 --> 00:51:25,170
Scott: so you want people to eat.

709
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:33,932
Scott: you Put it out and anything hidden you keep it hidden and like if you got malamar's you gotta lock that shit up and like your bedroom closet, they'll eat Everything.

710
00:51:34,193 --> 00:51:38,090
Rym: we started finally and now they all bring their own food, and I don't like any of their food.

711
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:40,781
Rym: It's really crappy usually, but we just we let them bring.

712
00:51:40,801 --> 00:51:43,090
Scott: I also don't like their food, and we eat from our hidden food.

713
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:49,016
Rym: That's like hidden up in our rooms throughout the time yeah, but ah I forgot where I was going with that.

714
00:51:49,056 --> 00:51:51,043
Rym: I had something I wanted to say, but I don't care anymore.

715
00:51:51,064 --> 00:52:05,810
Rym: Yeah, but like Figure out how much food you're gonna provide and I guess as long as other people will either pay or reciprocate then yeah go for it, but if Money becomes a problem just stop providing food, and they'll deal with it on their own.

716
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:07,216
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's one thing.

717
00:52:07,296 --> 00:52:10,830
Scott: if you're hosting you know like a Christmas party that you invited people to you know.

718
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:14,810
Scott: Then you're like a host and you invited people to a party at your house like our New Year's party.

719
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:16,699
Rym: We just we buy catering every year.

720
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,005
Rym: We don't charge people money.

721
00:52:18,025 --> 00:52:21,170
Rym: We just cater here We got a bunch of food or hosting a party.

722
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:28,642
Scott: But if just if it's people just come into your house for an event you know and they're sort of make it you know I mean it's you want to be hospitable and set.

723
00:52:28,702 --> 00:52:30,230
Scott: let people make themselves at home.

724
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:35,190
Scott: You know you don't want them to feel like they're they're at some event, and they can't you know be relaxed and whatever.

725
00:52:35,311 --> 00:52:37,230
Rym: But but I've seen their apartments.

726
00:52:37,631 --> 00:52:42,304
Scott: Yeah, but if they make themselves at home and their home is it's like not good.

727
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:45,775
Scott: like you don't want a homeless person making Themselves at home in your house.

728
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:49,490
Scott: I mean well most homeless people who are you know dirty and you know?

729
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:57,150
Scott: But stabbin con not saying yeah exactly the stabbin kind They make themselves at home in your clean house your home is gonna be a big sty.

730
00:52:59,774 --> 00:53:01,030
Rym: Yeah, well like food.

731
00:53:01,452 --> 00:53:12,730
Rym: Actually one one of our other friends had the same Takes the same issue with all of our friends because she does the same thing that we like to do But we kind of stopped doing because no one seems to appreciate her care.

732
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:19,178
Rym: but like we'll actually make like nice hors d'oeuvres and fancy things and bring out like a Tray of cheese and crackers and nuts and fruit.

733
00:53:19,218 --> 00:53:22,050
Rym: like food nice food here you go.

734
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:30,182
Rym: And she does the same thing when people come over and the rest of our friends pretty much look at it and go Eat it all and that's it.

735
00:53:30,725 --> 00:53:33,136
Rym: nope no no Thank you know anything.

736
00:53:33,157 --> 00:53:35,447
Rym: just they eat it all and then they're still hungry, and then they bitch about all.

737
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:36,030
Rym: they're still hungry.

738
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:38,943
Scott: I don't even need to thank you because I don't really care about matters.

739
00:53:39,024 --> 00:53:44,295
Scott: I just need okay Thank me by not fucking up my house Or I don't know.

740
00:53:44,757 --> 00:53:46,867
Rym: bring some hors d'oeuvres next time so I don't have to.

741
00:53:46,887 --> 00:53:48,054
Scott: yeah It's like.

742
00:53:48,074 --> 00:53:49,101
Scott: I don't need you to say thank you.

743
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:49,886
Scott: I need you to act.

744
00:53:50,067 --> 00:53:53,610
Scott: thankful I just need you to not do things that suck.

745
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:56,643
Scott: Luckily it feels like I'm paying you.

746
00:53:57,326 --> 00:54:01,367
Scott: you know stuff I'm giving you things and then you're you're taking more things away.

747
00:54:01,609 --> 00:54:02,893
Rym: luckily There's one saving grace.

748
00:54:02,934 --> 00:54:11,230
Rym: very few of our friends actually drink wine so I can always open a bottle of the wine and do all The nice and but in the end everyone gets like a small glass.

749
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:13,768
Rym: They don't even finish it, and then I just get to drink most of the bottle.

750
00:54:14,871 --> 00:54:17,641
Scott: Way to go yeah, I know I like.

751
00:54:17,661 --> 00:54:20,250
Scott: why you should do is you should take some Hobo wine?

752
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,557
Scott: Right you should you finish a bottle of real wine.

753
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:23,621
Scott: take Hobo wine.

754
00:54:23,962 --> 00:54:24,464
Scott: take a funnel.

755
00:54:24,965 --> 00:54:26,410
Scott: fill the real wine with the Hobo wine.

756
00:54:26,656 --> 00:54:29,237
Scott: Right well I did that be like who wants a wine.

757
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:33,636
Scott: here's some wine for you, and you pour it from your fancy wine bottle But it's Hobo wine.

758
00:54:33,656 --> 00:54:35,690
Scott: you don't have everyone Hobo wine that they're not gonna finish.

759
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:37,242
Scott: I think you drink your nice one.

760
00:54:37,262 --> 00:54:39,579
Rym: I think what I'm gonna do Maybe not this time, but yeah, I'll.

761
00:54:39,619 --> 00:54:40,705
Rym: probably if I can't I'll get time.

762
00:54:40,726 --> 00:54:41,249
Rym: I'll prepare it.

763
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:50,077
Rym: I'll set it up to where I'll have some crap wine that is actually crap like bad wine nitrate And this.

764
00:54:50,158 --> 00:54:56,950
Rym: so anyone who any of our friends who listen to this episode before they come tomorrow We'll we'll know and be ready for this, but let's go like tomorrow.

765
00:54:57,131 --> 00:54:59,923
Scott: Let's go down to the to the and get some Thunderbird hell.

766
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:01,270
Scott: I'll buy some on the way home from work.

767
00:55:01,451 --> 00:55:01,894
Rym: Yeah, do it.

768
00:55:02,155 --> 00:55:04,290
Rym: I'm gonna get red red whatever wine.

769
00:55:04,632 --> 00:55:10,610
Rym: I'm gonna get the the Hobo wine basically and I got some nice wine bottles And I let's be a test not even at the Visigoth thing.

770
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:12,238
Rym: I'll just find out.

771
00:55:12,258 --> 00:55:14,630
Scott: try what we could try with beer - I can go get some steel reserve.

772
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:20,310
Rym: I'm just gonna find out which of our friends cuz I you know whenever I pour wine people I was like Oh, this is a good Chianti.

773
00:55:20,492 --> 00:55:21,259
Rym: I like the taste of.

774
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:30,150
Rym: it's very duh And I can tell to a degree like I think a lot of people take wine way too seriously and make a lot of shit Up, but there is good wine and there's bad wine.

775
00:55:30,492 --> 00:55:32,988
Rym: I have drank wine that was terrible and I've had wine that was good.

776
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:38,208
Rym: But I think a lot of our friends just say things that they don't actually know and they can't tell.

777
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:40,418
Rym: and if I gave him Hobo wine they'd probably say oh, this is good.

778
00:55:40,479 --> 00:55:40,901
Rym: It's sweet.

779
00:55:40,961 --> 00:55:41,866
Scott: It's sweet.

780
00:55:41,906 --> 00:55:42,750
Scott: It tastes like grape juice.

781
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,194
Scott: I mean I've tasted it even though.

782
00:55:44,214 --> 00:55:44,715
Scott: I don't like it.

783
00:55:45,116 --> 00:55:45,437
Scott: Hey Rym.

784
00:55:45,878 --> 00:55:47,703
Scott: What's the word Thunderbird?

785
00:55:47,723 --> 00:55:50,149
Scott: has it sold good and cold?

786
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:52,640
Scott: What's the jive birds alive?

787
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,324
Scott: What's the price?

788
00:55:53,324 --> 00:55:53,767
Scott: 30 twice?

789
00:55:57,411 --> 00:56:07,769
Scott: I got some pictures of us drinking the Hobo wine and while that was MD 2020 That's hope I think Thunderbird will be more convincing because it's like a white wine and not like you know It doesn't look like grape juice.

790
00:56:08,252 --> 00:56:11,950
Rym: I got a really nice Riesling that I finished a while ago and I still have the bottle.

791
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:14,579
Rym: I'll refill that Riesling bottle with Thunderbird.

792
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:19,801
Scott: The thing is if just one person knows listens to this episode They'll tell everyone else only if they're jerks.

793
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,269
Rym: it will serve two purposes.

794
00:56:21,449 --> 00:56:32,050
Rym: one We'll find out who among our friends are traitors And two we'll find out if no one is a traitor who among our friends is a tool when it comes to saying wine tastes good.

795
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:38,366
Scott: Hahaha Cuz I feel like oh, yeah, you should hype it up be like, oh, this is a fancy jury.

796
00:56:38,547 --> 00:56:42,210
Rym: Oh French wine I know I'll go straight up like this is like a gorgeous war winner.

797
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:45,161
Rym: Like this is one of my like fancy spice wines that I really like.

798
00:56:45,522 --> 00:56:46,425
Scott: cuz I drink it.

799
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:48,813
Scott: they say oh wow This is really great.

800
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:49,495
Scott: That's Thunderbird.

801
00:56:49,796 --> 00:56:51,300
Rym: I'll be like, this is an Alsatian wine.

802
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,683
Rym: Can you taste the spices?

803
00:56:53,185 --> 00:56:54,187
Rym: Yeah, I can.

804
00:56:54,669 --> 00:56:56,567
Rym: that's that's mad train.

805
00:56:57,755 --> 00:57:00,485
Rym: The only spice is in there Hobo P.

806
00:57:02,771 --> 00:57:05,380
Scott: Well, this show has turned into a lot more of a beverage show.

807
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,002
Scott: such a please.

808
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,170
Scott: you people are always arguing for food shows.

809
00:57:08,471 --> 00:57:17,129
Rym: Yeah, the real thing is we've mostly solved the Visigoth problem and they're better even though the last time they came over They broke our screen door.

810
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:21,350
Rym: Wow, like just ripped it and none of them will admit to have done it.

811
00:57:21,411 --> 00:57:22,609
Rym: But we know one of them did it.

812
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:28,231
Scott: So the thing is I can kind of sympathize that a little bit because sometimes you break something you don't realize, you know It's.

813
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:32,736
Scott: it's like you break a glass, you know, you're like if you just drop it, you know You broke it.

814
00:57:32,777 --> 00:57:33,950
Scott: There's no question, right?

815
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:47,096
Scott: But sometimes like you put a glass in the sink and then you're trying to do dishes You know like something might fall onto the glass and cry which means you were doing the dishes wrong But you might not realize that it actually happened, you know, like you might be walking, you know You bump into the screen door.

816
00:57:47,116 --> 00:57:47,960
Scott: You just keep walking.

817
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:52,822
Scott: You don't even realize that you just broke it, you know Anything can happen has happened to me.

818
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,108
Rym: I don't think it can.

819
00:57:54,128 --> 00:57:55,053
Rym: well Just I'm.

820
00:57:55,114 --> 00:57:58,010
Scott: it's happened to me in the past where I've broken something not realized it.

821
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:04,055
Scott: But then later when it was pointed out, I would say oh I remember I must have broke it when this happened I don't know.

822
00:58:04,075 --> 00:58:06,049
Rym: but then again we pointed out and no one

823
00:58:06,641 --> 00:58:06,968
Scott: I know

824
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:16,141
Rym: Yeah plus I just can't imagine being so unaware of my body that I would just crash into things and knock things because that's the other people knock things over like well

825
00:58:16,181 --> 00:58:17,710
Scott: it is it is crowded and people are

826
00:58:18,274 --> 00:58:18,960
Rym: Move around

827
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,130
Scott: a lot in a very crowded.

828
00:58:20,913 --> 00:58:25,090
Rym: Point out that neither Scott nor I have ever knocked something over during a session of Dungeons & Dragons.

829
00:58:25,532 --> 00:58:35,957
Scott: Well, the only argument I can make as to why that would be the case Like, you know devil's advocate we're really skinny Is that you know you.

830
00:58:36,037 --> 00:58:47,710
Scott: you can sort of walk through your own house in the dark without looking You know and into our house even though they come here often is still a Slightly stranger place and they don't have the the sort of muscle reflex of going around the house.

831
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:49,990
Scott: Like if it was dark, they might fall over in our house.

832
00:58:50,070 --> 00:59:01,830
Rym: Oh, but to play the anti devil's advocate the things they knock over are things that are like like they're trying to maneuver around the table to sit back down at the D&D table and they just slam into the table and knock everything over.

833
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:06,124
Scott: I think also we a few of our friends are generally clumsier than we are.

834
00:59:06,545 --> 00:59:07,368
Rym: Oh, yeah, definitely.

835
00:59:07,388 --> 00:59:09,473
Scott: Yeah Anything else?

836
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:14,510
Rym: Well, I think the real what it came down to in the end was like a few times ago.

837
00:59:15,072 --> 00:59:22,630
Rym: We just were jerks about it straight up and we pissed off all our friends by basically saying Don't trash our house or we're not playing games here.

838
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:27,890
Rym: In fact, we even said, you know, we're gonna play D&D Sunday morning and the house was an absolute disaster.

839
00:59:28,051 --> 00:59:33,030
Rym: So we just said no D&D is being played until the house is back to the way it was before.

840
00:59:33,992 --> 00:59:37,783
Scott: When I was trying to enforce that decision you were not really backing me up.

841
00:59:37,844 --> 00:59:39,689
Rym: so cuz you were being crazy about it.

842
00:59:40,313 --> 00:59:41,439
Rym: You went a little beyond.

843
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:41,821
Scott: you got it.

844
00:59:41,842 --> 00:59:42,767
Scott: You got to back me up or else.

845
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:43,250
Scott: It doesn't work.

846
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,203
Scott: They'll just be like, yeah, whatever we're playing but the thing is we didn't play.

847
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:50,641
Scott: we waited cuz I wouldn't I backed you up Yeah, but they didn't clean up as much as they could.

848
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:52,630
Scott: it, you know, it wasn't a hundred percent clean.

849
00:59:53,004 --> 00:59:58,639
Rym: Yeah well part of the problem was that there were a bunch of messes and we went to each one and we're like Look at this pile of crap.

850
00:59:58,679 --> 00:59:59,564
Rym: who made this pile?

851
00:59:59,605 --> 01:00:01,114
Rym: and no one would fess up Who did that?

852
01:00:01,134 --> 01:00:02,605
Rym: and everyone would say it wasn't me.

853
01:00:02,827 --> 01:00:06,620
Scott: don't get mad Because it isn't any individual person for any individual mess.

854
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:10,215
Scott: if any one of our friends came over they would make no mess basic.

855
01:00:10,255 --> 01:00:11,388
Rym: well except Scott Johnson.

856
01:00:12,893 --> 01:00:13,458
Scott: Guys make it fun.

857
01:00:13,478 --> 01:00:14,690
Scott: Scott Johnson is too easy.

858
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:23,749
Rym: But Scott actively is funny because he makes a big mess whenever he arrives anywhere But the mess contracts and disappears the moment he leaves cuz he keeps track of all his stuff.

859
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:25,014
Scott: cuz bit Yeah, cuz basically what does?

860
01:00:25,075 --> 01:00:27,989
Scott: he just brings a bunch of unnecessary shit over his thing?

861
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:30,398
Rym: Well, but some of it is very very necessary.

862
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,485
Rym: It is like the GameCube games.

863
01:00:32,787 --> 01:00:33,730
Rym: Yeah, and the DVDs.

864
01:00:34,032 --> 01:00:36,490
Scott: So basically I think another thing you can do to help unless you have a lot.

865
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:39,489
Scott: It's like when we go when I go over go to my relatives house, right?

866
01:00:40,172 --> 01:00:42,906
Scott: But we just always been like no one even thinks about it.

867
01:00:42,986 --> 01:00:49,010
Scott: right is When I go and all of our family does this right we go to my aunts any aunts any uncle any grandma anything?

868
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:52,181
Scott: When you walk in the door They be person.

869
01:00:52,202 --> 01:01:01,016
Scott: the people who live in the house Sort of take all the coats and things right all the coats and all the bags and everything and they bring it up and they Put it in someone's bedroom.

870
01:01:01,378 --> 01:01:03,370
Scott: The thing is no one's sleeping over.

871
01:01:03,511 --> 01:01:08,809
Scott: So it's like, you know, if you're staying for dinner and then going home No one's going in the bedrooms, you know.

872
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:13,590
Scott: So they put all the stuff on like a bed in one of the bedrooms and then when everyone leaves they all take it out.

873
01:01:14,072 --> 01:01:16,419
Rym: That's what all civilized people do exactly.

874
01:01:16,801 --> 01:01:19,610
Scott: but you know because people are staying the night.

875
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:26,090
Scott: We can't have a system like that and we need to sort of force people like keep as much as their stuff out as possible In their cars or and stuff.

876
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:31,750
Rym: Well, I think the real problem there too is that people bring a lot of stuff and they just let it get everywhere.

877
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:36,230
Scott: And every every Sunday when people leave a lot of stuff by everyone leaves stuff behind constantly.

878
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:38,950
Rym: We've started just throwing a lot of it away without saying anything.

879
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:42,847
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I just the socks left behind every time that aren't mine and aren't rims.

880
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:43,350
Scott: Just throw them out.

881
01:01:43,864 --> 01:01:46,958
Rym: Yeah people leave bathrooms our bathroom every time they leave.

882
01:01:46,978 --> 01:01:50,788
Rym: we have like four new conditioners and two new shampoos and we have two loofahs.

883
01:01:50,809 --> 01:01:51,852
Scott: we Have loofahs.

884
01:01:52,093 --> 01:01:53,338
Scott: that the loofahs are?

885
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:56,189
Scott: they left the loofahs on the stairway?

886
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:00,782
Scott: I'm hanging on the railing to the stairs outside the bathroom.

887
01:02:01,243 --> 01:02:03,550
Scott: who even puts a loofah there to begin with?

888
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:06,317
Scott: Perhaps you do not know what it is.

889
01:02:06,337 --> 01:02:09,230
Scott: Do you hang the loofahs on the stair railing in your house?

890
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:12,101
Rym: I just like saying loofah loofah loofah.

891
01:02:12,202 --> 01:02:20,839
Scott: You know what loofah is backwards aloof a fool Yeah, but it just came down to.

892
01:02:20,879 --> 01:02:24,949
Rym: we had to be jerks about it and it kind of an episode.

893
01:02:24,969 --> 01:02:29,284
Rym: yeah Well, it kind of worked and they don't mess up our house nearly as badly as they used to.

894
01:02:29,304 --> 01:02:34,248
Rym: and now we just have to Teach them things like people always say oh and they'll like they do the dishes like.

895
01:02:34,368 --> 01:02:36,545
Scott: one time Someone did the dishes with the bathroom sponge.

896
01:02:36,828 --> 01:02:42,857
Scott: Yes It's partially my fault for leaving that sponge there in the first place But it was pretty obvious.

897
01:02:43,118 --> 01:02:45,245
Scott: one was a dish sponge and one was a horrible.

898
01:02:45,305 --> 01:02:49,915
Scott: one was covered in hairs Or just I don't know.

899
01:02:50,316 --> 01:02:51,259
Rym: we just had to be jerks.

900
01:02:51,621 --> 01:02:54,630
Scott: and having a dishwasher does also give us a big disadvantage.

901
01:02:55,136 --> 01:03:03,610
Rym: Yeah, not having dishwasher I mean, I think the only real complaint I have now is that people bring way too much stuff and they leave it all over The place and they just I mean I go to their house.

902
01:03:03,771 --> 01:03:11,989
Scott: I bring basically two bags like, you know The bag I carry every day with like my laptop my DS and stuff and a tiny duffel bag and that's it.

903
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:15,970
Scott: And or even if I bring people come to our house with freaking luggage for a weekend.

904
01:03:16,352 --> 01:03:17,580
Scott: What the hell like.

905
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:24,950
Rym: this is what we do at cons to and it works So well when I show up at a hotel room and this is why we don't stay with anyone anymore our hotel room for cons.

906
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:26,897
Rym: Now it's pretty much like just me and Scott.

907
01:03:27,058 --> 01:03:29,528
Rym: Yeah, and I'm never getting hotel rooms for people again.

908
01:03:29,588 --> 01:03:41,730
Rym: Good God, but We all like go find a little area in the hotel room or the house or whatever and all my stuff will be Compacted into that tiny little area except for the bathroom stuff, which I compact into an area in the bathroom.

909
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:45,424
Rym: Yep, or usually actually I leave all my bathroom stuff in my area.

910
01:03:45,504 --> 01:03:49,850
Rym: if I go bring it back and forth to the bathroom I carry it all to the bathroom that I carry it all out sometime.

911
01:03:50,052 --> 01:03:52,410
Scott: Actually, I have a little toiletry bag that I use, you know.

912
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:55,470
Scott: But for a while, I didn't have the toiletry bag because my brother stole it.

913
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:57,650

01:04:03,233 --> 01:04:04,770

01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:12,016
Rym: we just kind of we talked about doing this episode right after they came the last time and it took us about a month to Get around to actually doing it.

918
