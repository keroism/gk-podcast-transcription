00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,709
Rym: It's Monday September 3rd.

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,692
Rym: I'm Rym.

00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:16,242
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,138
Rym: Wonderful Spam.

6
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:25,378
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:42,240
Scott: For those of you who do not live in the United States or not familiar with the United States and the things that go on here today Monday September 3rd is a holiday known as Labor Day.

8
00:00:42,863 --> 00:00:46,840
Scott: It's a holiday that exists pretty much just so that no one has to go to work.

9
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,003
Scott: It doesn't really.

10
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:49,467
Scott: there's nothing else to it.

11
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:51,813
Scott: It's Labor Day where you don't do any labor.

12
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,160
Rym: there were fireworks, and that was it.

13
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:59,677
Scott: Yeah, it's not really an exciting day except for the fact that you know this is long stretch in.

14
00:00:59,797 --> 00:01:06,540
Scott: you know of time On the calendar after the summer where you know there haven't been any days off of work since July.

15
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:10,519
Scott: So they figure you know well We'll toss another day off work.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,784
Scott: Just you know Labor Day

17
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:26,658
Rym: now traditionally what late the way Labor Day is celebrated is the majority of Americans will get into cars and Then get up early sometime in the beginning of the weekend Attempt to drive at least 400 miles and get stuck in traffic for pretty much an entire day.

18
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:36,040
Rym: Yeah, they'll then get to a tourist spot overpay for a hotel Not be able to sit on the beach because there's a billion other people on the beach have a miserable time.

19
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:45,679
Rym: as soon as they try to barbecue it'll rain and Then they get in their car only to find that everyone else is trying to go home at the same time And they spend the entire Monday in the car.

20
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:52,749
Scott: Yep, so we decided on Labor Day just to stay home, and we figured hey We'll do a GeekNights also.

21
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:55,926
Scott: You know I mean I was gonna do laundry But I forgot.

22
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:56,910
Scott: you know three days.

23
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,834
Scott: I could have done laundry.

24
00:01:57,854 --> 00:01:59,180
Rym: I didn't man you didn't do laundry.

25
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:01,249
Rym: I did every piece of laundry.

26
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:01,871
Rym: I own.

27
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:04,020
Rym: there is nothing dirty except my dress pants.

28
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,570
Scott: I really need to do something - I don't know.

29
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,336
Scott: I'm gonna wear tomorrow, but So I'll do a GeekNights and stay.

30
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:12,153
Scott: I'll do laundry tomorrow though.

31
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,340
Rym: I gotta say we got a lot done.

32
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:20,072
Rym: I mean I know Scott's been posting about the new website design We're working on and we've been working on for like two years.

33
00:02:20,313 --> 00:02:21,457
Rym: Yeah, but now it's coming along.

34
00:02:21,477 --> 00:02:28,259
Rym: We're getting close Yeah, and we've actually got a lot of banners and flyers coming working on the t-shirts and all that and got all that stuff done.

35
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:31,760
Rym: Also, we did you know domestic stuff.

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,178
Rym: I cleaned the house, and we went shopping and I got to say I Was taken aback by a product that I saw in the store.

37
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:42,714
Scott: well We went to eat yesterday like the barbecue place because you know we didn't want to cook.

38
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:47,037
Scott: so and across the street was the grocery Store and we went in to get some meat that we could eat today.

39
00:02:47,178 --> 00:02:49,110
Rym: granted We were dumb, and we didn't get buns.

40
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,512
Rym: well.

41
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:50,800
Scott: We got buns of the grass station.

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,554
Scott: It was all right, but in the grocery store.

43
00:02:53,594 --> 00:02:56,024
Scott: We saw this package of What was it?

44
00:02:56,104 --> 00:02:57,870
Rym: diced pork diced ham.

45
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,558
Rym: the thing is nice to walk in and it's not refrigerated or anything.

46
00:03:00,578 --> 00:03:06,073
Rym: just in the middle of This aisle hanging like from a stick with a thing sticking through it like hooks.

47
00:03:06,655 --> 00:03:08,460
Rym: are these packages of diced ham?

48
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:09,142
Scott: They're.

49
00:03:09,162 --> 00:03:10,747
Scott: they're obviously vacuum sealed.

50
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:14,680
Scott: you know the plastic was right up against the ham and there was no air or liquid or anything.

51
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,391
Scott: It's just like little cubes of ham all bunched up Completely sealed tight with plastic.

52
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:22,000
Rym: now that in itself is no big deal.

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,920
Rym: I really like ham and I really like diced ham, but the way it was packaged It looked like one of those fake plastic vomits.

54
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:35,644
Rym: It was like a flat piece of plastic and in the middle of the plastic was this three-dimensional bulge of ham Pink chunks.

55
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,359
Scott: did it look like someone vomited up pink junk?

56
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:42,299
Rym: now I'm a man who really likes his ham, but I got a little nauseous looking at it.

57
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,880
Scott: It was not a pleasant thing to behold.

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,071
Scott: I don't know if anyone was gonna buy something like that at.

59
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:50,199
Rym: the girl must buy it because they were selling it.

60
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,203
Rym: there was A lot of it there.

61
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:54,337
Scott: the grocery store sells a lot of things that nobody buys you know.

62
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:56,204
Rym: so Yeah, yet.

63
00:03:56,224 --> 00:03:57,734
Rym: They don't sell a lot of the things I want.

64
00:03:57,995 --> 00:03:58,237
Scott: I know.

65
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:08,456
Rym: Remember when they had koalas marched that one time and we bought like all of them Yeah, and then that night we realized that there's more trans fat in those than anything else we eat.

66
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:12,339
Scott: Yeah, so whatever Grocery stores we need better ones.

67
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:13,543
Scott: It sucks.

68
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:14,486
Rym: Yeah, well.

69
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,168
Rym: That's the problem.

70
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:19,420
Rym: We live in a very a fast gentrifying area, but it hasn't all gentrified yet.

71
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,610
Rym: So the only grocery store, it's like.

72
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:35,700
Scott: it's funny that in like the town of fish kill there's like two or three grocery stores, and then like Wappingers Falls and Poughkeepsie like a bajillion grocery stores and Beacon the city of Beacon the city of Beacon there's one really shitty shitty grocery store.

73
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:36,084
Scott: That's not.

74
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,520
Scott: even you might as well not exist.

75
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,062
Scott: It's so shitty.

76
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:43,096
Rym: I can say that I have never in my life gone into that grocery store without incident.

77
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:44,260
Scott: bad incident.

78
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:45,966
Rym: Yes, that will never get.

79
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:52,049
Rym: very rarely will someone say without incident and be referring to good things I could be a good incident anyway.

80
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:52,290
Rym: Hi.

81
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,274
Rym: Let's like running a foul.

82
00:04:53,355 --> 00:04:58,661
Scott: our food acquisition situation is not Ideal.

83
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,513
Rym: yeah, yeah our hunting and gathering not so optimal right now.

84
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:02,974
Scott: Nope.

85
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:08,313
Scott: We're mostly the Like this you know the the wise men and someone else hunts and gathers.

86
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:14,246
Rym: the worst thing is if we lived in the city Well one we wouldn't have to worry because there's a million places to get good food But - we could just have one.

87
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,434
Rym: don't someone deliver groceries to us every day.

88
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:21,588
Scott: Yeah, but they don't have the giant Supermarkets in the city like we had you know.

89
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:23,455
Rym: ah they're good enough.

90
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:24,620
Rym: I don't know what your problem is.

91
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,573
Scott: Yeah, because they're just normal sized supermarkets.

92
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:27,874
Scott: It's not.

93
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,140
Scott: you'll find like a little stop-and-shop.

94
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,820
Scott: You won't find like a super stop-and-shop or a Wegmans down there, right?

95
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,800
Rym: Anyway, yeah, you know the news cuz I don't really want to talk about food on a Monday.

96
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,780
Scott: No, I'm tired.

97
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:40,265
Scott: Why is every podcast?

98
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:44,720
Scott: people seem to just want to talk about food and the listeners want the podcasters talk about food?

99
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,678
Scott: Why don't you watch like the Food Network on TV or something?

100
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:48,020
Scott: well?

101
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,906
Rym: They seem to not want to actually hear about food.

102
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:52,094
Rym: They want to hear about funny stories relating to food.

103
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:53,178
Scott: I don't get it it.

104
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:57,959
Scott: Most requested podcast discussion topics are always food.

105
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:05,263
Rym: Well one of the most popular episodes was one where we had our friend Adam on and all I know let's talk about food Candy episode.

106
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,630
Scott: like Dave and Joel always get bothered about food, too.

107
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,900
Rym: Well because they live in Philly so uh they really.

108
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:13,366
Rym: I was about to make a joke.

109
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:16,015
Scott: stop asking us to talk about food or zombies.

110
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:17,480
Scott: Yeah, all right anyway.

111
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:25,234
Rym: So you all use Google I assume because Google is really the only search engine in the world well at least in the English-speaking world worth of shit.

112
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:29,460
Rym: In China Google's not number one now.

113
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,720
Rym: There's a lot of reasons for that, but the number one The Great Firewall of China the Great Wall of Fire.

114
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:42,650
Rym: Yeah, the Great Firewall the number one search engine in China is something called Baidu B-a-i-d-u and there's a lot of reasons for that.

115
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,814
Rym: probably number one is that?

116
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:49,659
Rym: I'm not sure but I I would wager That it just doesn't index things that the Chinese firewall is gonna block.

117
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:50,945
Scott: I'm pretty sure it doesn't.

118
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:59,120
Rym: Google often will just pop up and say sorry we can't actually link you to there But that rest assured if you weren't a Chinese citizen you could view a website on the other side.

119
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:00,465
Scott: I think that's what it does.

120
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:01,067
Scott: I'm not sure

121
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:04,320
Rym: Google's a lot better about it than all the other companies out there like yeah

122
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:19,417
Scott: Yeah, yeah No the thing is is like originally the old search engines like you know whatever they all lost out to Google in the first place because Google didn't have Google was able to clear its index of all the 404 pages

123
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:20,863
Rym: Back in the day.

124
00:07:20,883 --> 00:07:31,640
Rym: if you went on Yahoo or even a Alta Vista digital or web crawler a lot of time Search and like five of the first ten search results were 404s and the other five were spam.

125
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:39,020
Scott: Yeah, so that's sort of the reason that Google took off is because of lack of 404s and actual good worthwhile results.

126
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:43,366
Rym: And now you know Google also took out off for the same reason.

127
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:44,670
Rym: originally Yahoo did in that.

128
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:51,913
Rym: originally the Yahoo front page like Google was just hey Here's the search bar, and it was very minimalist and very simple.

129
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,560
Rym: and Google is still that way.

130
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,200
Rym: But Yahoo and every other search engine just has all this garbage on the site that you'll net.

131
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:59,990
Rym: There's no reason you would ever need to click on those links.

132
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:00,954
Rym: They're not efficient.

133
00:08:00,974 --> 00:08:02,440
Rym: They're not gonna take you anywhere useful.

134
00:08:03,142 --> 00:08:07,637
Rym: Nope, but Baidu basically has the same business model as Google.

135
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:12,260
Rym: at least Google searches They just have text ads and other than that they have the entire Chinese market.

136
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:14,928
Scott: Yeah, so what's the news about Baidu?

137
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,837
Rym: the news is that Baidu is still beating Google?

138
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:18,660
Scott: That's it.

139
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:28,556
Rym: well, actually I brought this up partly because there's a kind of tangential discussion where I Realized as I was going on dig looking for an article like this and I saw this article.

140
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:29,299
Rym: I kind of sparked it.

141
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:37,509
Rym: There really aren't any Good web 2.0 Indexing nice sites in any language other than English.

142
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:45,440
Rym: Well, there are but not many And not of the scale or quality of things like dig and slash dot.

143
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:52,996
Scott: Yeah, well, I think part of that is because most of the internet is in English first of all and second of all, you know, they're just the.

144
00:08:53,761 --> 00:09:07,696
Scott: While you know people in South Korea and Japan and in all these other countries are crazy internet users There aren't really, you know, and while a greater percentage of their country is wired and wired faster Just the quantity of people.

145
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:16,001
Rym: Yeah Article about how in a lot of northern Europe and the Scandinavian countries They have like the hundred megabit fiber just to their house yep,

146
00:09:16,563 --> 00:09:33,013
Scott: and while a large percentage of their you know, relatively smaller nation is all wired and intelligent and using the web the number of people just flat number of people who are using the internet in Like the US and China are the big ones and everyone else not so much.

147
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:46,877
Rym: also just in terms of internet culture I mean, it seems like if you go to the majority of the Japanese web like Japanese websites and Japanese news sites and all that They look almost exactly like the US web looked in the like middling later 90s.

148
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,489
Scott: Yeah, I don't really has.

149
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:50,655
Scott: it must have just Japan.

150
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:51,500
Rym: That was just an example.

151
00:09:51,681 --> 00:10:04,192
Scott: I know I definitely think there is something to be studied involving like, you know the the cross-section between the the culture of the the Meat world and the culture of the tech world in different countries.

152
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:17,996
Scott: because it seems like in the US While our tech is a lot lower than a lot of other places like South Korea It seems like I don't know There's a bunch of people who really care about it pushing it forward and I guess in other countries.

153
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:22,680
Scott: while there are people like that There's not enough to actually make a big dent or a big present I don't know.

154
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,699
Rym: It might also just be a cultural thing and that partly because the internet I mean like it or not world.

155
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:33,760
Rym: the US Basically invented and built the internet and I mean now it's the international thing and that's awesome.

156
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,160
Rym: But for a long time it was mostly a US thing.

157
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:43,749
Rym: Yeah, and as a result, it seems like the people who are on the internet in the US not like the average Joe But like the techie people.

158
00:10:44,354 --> 00:11:00,351
Rym: there's a lot Longer relative history of using the internet and maybe I have a feeling that if we fast-forward 10 years Japan and all these other places will look a lot like your internet does now and will look well I'd say like web 3.0 but web 3.0 still doesn't mean anything useful.

159
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,757
Scott: No, but yeah, we've got.

160
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:08,840
Scott: I don't know We do have a lot of foreign listeners and things but they're all coming to our English only site.

161
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:14,720
Rym: There is one Japanese website that is all in Japanese that links to us often called Ultimo spell peen.

162
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:17,039
Rym: Yeah, I gotta ask Emily to read the site for me.

163
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:22,220
Rym: Yeah, I translated it once automatically and I remember we almost used it as our tagline.

164
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,040
Scott: It said it links to anime world order on the left side.

165
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,949
Scott: So I think it's some anime loving blogger who's Asian.

166
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,240
Rym: but it said something to the effect of GeekNights is a power podcast.

167
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:32,624
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

168
00:11:32,644 --> 00:11:33,387
Rym: I was proud of that.

169
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:35,573
Rym: All right, that's all I got.

170
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:37,800
Scott: Okay, so this is pretty weak.

171
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,787
Scott: Also, you know sauce.

172
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:42,777
Scott: Yeah, you know everyone on dig is always like we want a picture section.

173
00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:43,580
Scott: We want a picture sec.

174
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,108
Rym: Well, they should have a picture section.

175
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:46,354
Scott: They should and they did.

176
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,560
Scott: they say they're working on it.

177
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,420
Scott: You know that it'll be out soon enough.

178
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,460
Scott: I mean they upgraded the dig homepage already to like prepare for the inevitable picture sec.

179
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,185
Rym: I like what they did with the dig homepage.

180
00:11:56,205 --> 00:12:10,765
Scott: Yeah, but somebody with with pearl and I guess Supposedly they say seven hours of coding using the dig API made a site called dig pics calm and It's a dig picture section.

181
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:12,693
Rym: I dig up part of that kid.

182
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:14,359
Scott: The glove is thrown.

183
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:16,488
Rym: Granted he used pearl.

184
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:21,243
Scott: Well, I know but the point is is that Open source?

185
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:37,475
Scott: that one advantage of it that people don't often see is that you can just make a release Even if stuff isn't really perfect or if stuff isn't a hundred percent complete like right away and It sort of looks like when someone does this that they're showing up, you know dig like.

186
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:38,479
Scott: ah, they're showing up.

187
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,390
Scott: dig dig just Probably could have done this in five hours if they wanted to.

188
00:12:43,671 --> 00:12:46,780
Scott: the thing is this isn't integrated with the dig website.

189
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:53,577
Scott: This isn't bug tested so crazily thoroughly to be handled, you know with a bajillion dig users.

190
00:12:53,958 --> 00:13:02,420
Scott: This isn't You know Tested to integrate with all the other parts of the dig website like the profile and all that other stuff in new interesting ways.

191
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:03,684
Scott: You know, it's just.

192
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:09,300
Scott: you know, basically I mean when you look at it, that's what do you expect from a dig picture section?

193
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,198
Scott: But I'm pretty sure the actual dig picture section is gonna be way above and beyond what this is.

194
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:19,020
Rym: But at the same time with open source stuff, it's cool that people can do things like this.

195
00:13:19,263 --> 00:13:20,019
Scott: Oh, it's very cool.

196
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,646
Scott: And that's that's how I mean.

197
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:29,617
Rym: you're a corporation and some kid on the internet just because he's bored Could just take a product that you've released and make it better and you like what they did.

198
00:13:29,677 --> 00:13:32,071
Rym: you could just say hey We're taking that Congratulations.

199
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:32,658
Rym: You want a job?

200
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,626
Scott: Yeah, but this I don't think that this is.

201
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:38,877
Rym: no this is not that that was kind of another tangential discussion.

202
00:13:38,897 --> 00:13:45,813
Scott: Yeah But yeah, anyway, yeah If you're looking for a dig picture section dig pics.com is.

203
00:13:45,913 --> 00:13:47,780
Scott: I guess we'll hold you over until the real deal.

204
00:13:47,941 --> 00:14:09,063
Scott: Yeah, where you don't want to go as Bay image Bay image not so god things of the day All right, so my friend he told me that he bought some one of these things recently and for lack of a better Monday type Thing of the day.

205
00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:10,649
Scott: I'll just show you this cool thing.

206
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:11,673
Rym: So a friend.

207
00:14:11,994 --> 00:14:13,038
Rym: Yep a friend.

208
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,263
Rym: Yep Okay, right.

209
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,093
Scott: So what this is is it's actually a computer.

210
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:19,020
Scott: It's just a very small computer.

211
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,224
Scott: It's like what is?

212
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:21,930
Scott: it's got to be less than let's see.

213
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:26,667
Scott: It's six point seven inches by Eleven point four inches by.

214
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:29,316
Scott: yeah, it though that's the size of the case.

215
00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:31,464
Scott: This is really tiny It's like a little square.

216
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,970
Rym: Well, I like to go ATX.

217
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:34,756
Scott: It's not even ATX.

218
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:46,330
Scott: It's just a very small Like square circuit board and it's got an AMD geode x86 processor Some RAM hunt like 128 megs or whatever.

219
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,635
Scott: It's got a bios.

220
00:14:48,816 --> 00:14:50,460
Scott: It's got a serial ATA port.

221
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:53,093
Scott: It's got compact flash.

222
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:56,424
Scott: It's got freaking PCI slot.

223
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,388
Rym: All right, it's got.

224
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:58,191
Scott: it's loaded right?

225
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:05,415
Scott: It's a whole computer on this very small thing But most of all it's got four network interface holes right there.

226
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:06,639
Scott: One, two, three four lined up.

227
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:15,360
Scott: So if you want to I don't know make a router with say that's also, you know Not like a piece of crap links is that only does what it's been programmed to do.

228
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:24,262
Scott: but actually like a full-on router running Linux with a full firewall and the DHCPs and the DNS is and you know the whole Business.

229
00:15:24,763 --> 00:15:29,720
Scott: you could just get one of these little guys and install your Linux on there straight up and there you go.

230
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:32,440
Scott: And it's a little tiny thing doesn't even need cooling.

231
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:35,132
Scott: You know, I guess it needs a heatsink, but it doesn't need a fan or anything.

232
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:38,061
Scott: It's really tiny and really efficient Huh?

233
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:38,723
Rym: That's kind of cool.

234
00:15:38,844 --> 00:15:40,669
Scott: Yeah, I think oh, okay.

235
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:42,174
Scott: Maybe it has two PCI slots.

236
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:42,535
Scott: I don't know.

237
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:46,990
Scott: It's a. it's really crazy Like yes USB holes.

238
00:15:47,351 --> 00:15:48,135
Scott: It's got everything.

239
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:49,300
Scott: It's a computer.

240
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:55,514
Scott: So actually if you needed a computer, but you only needed to like browse the web You could probably get away with this thing.

241
00:15:55,574 --> 00:15:56,239
Rym: How much is it?

242
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:57,118
Scott: I don't know.

243
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,359
Rym: Let's see because if you just need to browse the web, you can buy a really crappy computer for very little money.

244
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:10,125
Scott: Well like a hundred and Okay, that's worth it.

245
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:13,058
Scott: the net five five oh one, okay, wait, hold on that was the net.

246
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:13,520
Scott: four five.

247
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:16,510
Rym: Oh one way to do your research captain Scott.

248
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:17,855
Scott: Okay, the five five.

249
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:21,779
Scott: Oh one the better one Is like three hundred dollars, huh?

250
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,213
Scott: It's still not so bad considering you're the size you're getting.

251
00:16:25,595 --> 00:16:28,573
Rym: it's smaller than a Mac mini But then you need to get a monitor and all that.

252
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:29,500
Scott: Well, you need that.

253
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,854
Rym: Anyway, yeah get a Mac because if you really just need like a crap computer like just I need to surf the web And that's it.

254
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:38,539
Scott: Oh, you can get the $20 motherboard that we got or not?

255
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,749
Rym: Even that just buy a used crap.

256
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:45,080
Rym: Oh laptop on eBay the batteries price shot But you're gonna plug it in and use it as a desktop.

257
00:16:45,324 --> 00:16:46,079
Scott: Yeah, you could do that too.

258
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:48,373
Rym: I mean if you really need crap go and get crap.

259
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:49,520
Rym: don't get like the fancy.

260
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,900
Scott: But if you want small and quiet, you know, plus this is mostly better for uses say a router than as a computer true.

261
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:59,298
Scott: Anyway, speaking of crap, you don't need four network cards in your computer.

262
00:16:59,338 --> 00:16:59,540
Scott: Do you?

263
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:02,270
Rym: Actually, I have two already.

264
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:03,859
Scott: Yeah, but how many of them do you use?

265
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,644
Rym: Well, well currently one.

266
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,290
Scott: and how many you ever gonna use?

267
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,140
Rym: I'm gonna have three eventually when I put that other Nick in.

268
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:12,286
Scott: That's right.

269
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:12,951
Scott: Okay.

270
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:28,510
Rym: Anyway, so Speaking of crap if you want to read a really bad piece of journalism You should check out this article called girls of ghost hunting by some woman named Christina Silva The time staff writer for the st.

271
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,900
Rym: Petersburg Times in Russia.

272
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:35,185
Scott: No Tampa, uh Florida st.

273
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:35,568
Scott: Petersburg.

274
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:35,991
Scott: Yes.

275
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:37,200
Rym: Yes, not Russia.

276
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:43,984
Rym: You know, I'd rather see something like this in Russia than the US but I've lost almost all my respect for the st Petersburg times.

277
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:47,300
Rym: not that I had much to begin with but not that I even knew the paper existed.

278
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,003
Scott: I guess I knew.

279
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:51,019
Scott: you know in theory, but I didn't actually consciously know.

280
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:55,014
Rym: This is an article about a group of women who call themselves spirits.

281
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:56,740
Rym: Spirits is an acronym.

282
00:17:56,921 --> 00:18:11,349
Rym: I'm not gonna bother saying what it stands for stupid people And really into I don't know whatever stupid people and some letters But They are self-proclaimed ghost experts.

283
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,114
Scott: I'm a ghost expert.

284
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:13,736
Scott: They don't exist.

285
00:18:13,956 --> 00:18:15,340
Scott: Yeah, I know everything there is to know about.

286
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:23,193
Rym: It's kind of like way back when every time there was a flame war on FARC about religion I just posted a link to the religion and God fact the god fact.

287
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,197
Rym: Is there a god?

288
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,200
Rym: I'm an expert on religion.

289
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:26,932
Scott: I know everything there is to know about religion.

290
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:27,959
Scott: It's all lies.

291
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,228
Rym: Anyway So, uh this article they kind of.

292
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:46,766
Rym: I don't know how this reporter gave so much credulity to these people but she basically just goes with them and takes everything they say at face value and they even so show pictures of their made-up garbage equipment and It has all the classics.

293
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:50,198
Rym: like they used an IR meter and they saw a cold spot.

294
00:18:50,278 --> 00:18:53,147
Rym: Oh shit It's a ghost not a draft or anything.

295
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:57,340
Scott: Yeah, it couldn't possibly be I don't know a poorly insulated wall.

296
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:07,099
Rym: so then they get some sort of or a piece of metal some sort of electromagnetic meter and they're like if there's a ghost here make it spike and it's spiked.

297
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,734
Rym: if You're male make it spike and it spiked.

298
00:19:09,754 --> 00:19:17,860
Rym: and then they had this conversation with the ghost and I'm not sure if it's just entirely made up or if the reporters just stupid or what.

299
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,349
Rym: but It bothers me that Semi legitimate press like the st.

300
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:28,246
Rym: Petersburg Times and it's not just them a lot of press in the u.s give credence to this bullshit that

301
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:28,827
Scott: when

302
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:49,030
Rym: speaking with an idiot someone who actually believes in ghosts and that sort of thing and claims to have evidence of ghosts and Especially when that evidence is easily and immediately debunked by anyone the fact that they won't just dismiss these people as idiots, but instead they'll interview them and Actually write an article about them and put it in the paper.

303
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,940
Rym: That doesn't just say I talked to an idiot.

304
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:53,285
Rym: He thinks there's ghosts.

305
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:54,249
Scott: well, you know, it's.

306
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,240
Scott: we go around and we see you know idiots on the internet.

307
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,561
Scott: We see idiots on the street and we have to realize that there's idiots all over the place and we see them all over the Place.

308
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,866
Scott: we interact with them all the time.

309
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:07,720
Scott: These idiots are not from any particular profession.

310
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:09,620
Scott: They are in all professions equally.

311
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:14,840
Scott: So there are idiot journalists their idiot plumbers and there's smart journalists and smart plumbers.

312
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,126
Scott: Yeah, any profession.

313
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:18,355
Scott: you can think of their idiots in that profession.

314
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:23,356
Scott: and when they're journalists You're gonna find out because eventually they're gonna write something idiotic.

315
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,107
Scott: if there's an idiotic author You're gonna find out cuz their book will be stupid.

316
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:28,214
Scott: So it's just the people who are in.

317
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:37,806
Scott: I see stupid people the people who are in a position their occupation doesn't reveal their idiocy to the public is You know is when you.

318
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:38,970
Scott: you know, you don't know about it.

319
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,308
Rym: So see at least to this woman's credit the grammar and spelling were Okay.

320
00:20:42,695 --> 00:20:45,557
Rym: Yeah Because the editor and it wasn't as bad as some other.

321
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:54,553
Rym: I mean I've read some journalistic articles in the past where I could do their job better and I don't know I've never been a reporter, but I could do their job better right now.

322
00:20:54,694 --> 00:20:55,196
Rym: Just bet.

323
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,900
Scott: Yep That's I could do a lot of jobs better than people do it, but you know what my job pays more.

324
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:06,461
Rym: Yeah and I'd and the thing is is that I'd rather be a journalist if I could make the same money just writing newspaper articles that I make.

325
00:21:06,522 --> 00:21:09,877
Rym: now go apply to do it because they won't pay me that much money.

326
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:11,727
Scott: Yeah Oh some of them might.

327
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:13,536
Scott: it's just hard to get that kind of job.

328
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:17,715
Rym: Yeah Maybe I should apply to be a tech writer for some local paper or something.

329
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:18,982
Scott: try to do something I don't know.

330
00:21:19,082 --> 00:21:23,243
Rym: Yeah, if I could make it actually if I could make even half my salary I might just quit.

331
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:25,671
Rym: go do that instead go for it.

332
00:21:26,113 --> 00:21:26,454
Rym: Oh, well.

333
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:28,623
Rym: Yeah, it was kind of a lame thing today But you know what?

334
00:21:28,906 --> 00:21:30,820
Rym: I'm really sick of just doing stuff on day.

335
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,859
Scott: You're lucky we're doing a show today cuz it's like a holiday and stuff.

336
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:36,630
Scott: So that's why I'm putting crap news and things of the day.

337
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:41,770
Rym: seriously anything I find if it's not on dig It's gonna be on dig by the time we do the show.

338
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,517
Rym: Yeah, there's no way to avoid it.

339
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:46,540
Rym: Nope Unless we really dig into the depths of the internet.

340
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,473
Rym: But then it's not really a legitimate thing of the day because I didn't just see it.

341
00:21:49,754 --> 00:21:51,060
Rym: I sought it out and that's different.

342
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:52,425
Rym: Yeah, oh, well.

343
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:55,256
Scott: All right, so let's get on with it then tonight.

344
00:21:55,678 --> 00:21:59,656
Rym: spam Spam Spam Scott really doesn't like spam.

345
00:21:59,676 --> 00:22:03,949
Rym: I think it's okay While it's kind of disgusting when you get it out of the can.

346
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:06,840
Rym: I'll admit a spam sandwich is actually really good.

347
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,304
Scott: No, it's disgusting.

348
00:22:08,364 --> 00:22:09,106
Scott: I'll never eat it.

349
00:22:09,648 --> 00:22:10,550
Rym: Have you ever tried it?

350
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,793
Rym: Yeah, when?

351
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:13,358
Scott: when was like a kid?

352
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:14,120
Rym: Are you sure?

353
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:15,887
Scott: I'm sure.

354
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:16,790
Rym: how did they prepare it?

355
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,915
Rym: You can't just eat it out of the can.

356
00:22:17,955 --> 00:22:18,597
Rym: that's disgusting.

357
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:24,028
Scott: That's Well, it was you know with some other stuff But it wasn't like changed in any way.

358
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:24,831
Rym: like what for you?

359
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:25,152
Rym: cube it?

360
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:28,424
Rym: you put it on some crackers with some dip and some Sauce and maybe some cheese.

361
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:30,993
Scott: It's a disgusting pink cube of disgusting.

362
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:32,358
Rym: It's not really a cube.

363
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:34,820
Scott: It doesn't It's disgusting.

364
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,852
Scott: Anyway, hey, we're gonna actually talk about the other kind of spam.

365
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:42,100
Rym: Yeah, we're not gonna go into technical crap.

366
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,351
Rym: We're not gonna get into the history of spam.

367
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:46,280
Rym: and the first spam was sent on November.

368
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:54,579
Scott: It was that guy from digital whatever and digital equipment corporation on a news group saying hey You know buy my computers.

369
00:22:55,142 --> 00:23:00,320
Rym: No, it wasn't that Quaker running around chiseling that picture of himself laughing about Thompson's insoluble plate.

370
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,560
Rym: No, see we're not gonna get into it.

371
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,448
Rym: But there there's a fine line between advertising and spam.

372
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,795
Rym: and just for the sake of discussion.

373
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:18,860
Rym: We're just dining spam as Unsolicited communication in quantity in email not just an email because you can spam people over.

374
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,820
Scott: I am you can spam you can but this term spam most specifically refirms to email.

375
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:26,530
Rym: I don't know anymore because I mean blog spam.

376
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:28,719
Rym: or is that a separate word like blogosphere, huh?

377
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:35,154
Scott: Yeah, I guess because it's the same thing I think done by the same Bob people started using the word mostly when it.

378
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:41,920
Scott: you know Cuz email is the first place that most people who were Experiencing spam and then spam sort of got all over everything else.

379
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:44,916
Rym: The only thing I would disagree with that is usenet.

380
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:49,658
Scott: usenet was fast Yes, but that's not when people start it's not when the word entered the vernacular.

381
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:50,060
Rym: you see me.

382
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:51,164
Rym: Well, when was that?

383
00:23:51,244 --> 00:23:53,453
Rym: I mean, where was spam first?

384
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:59,294
Scott: spam was first in the news groups But people didn't you know really start saying spam a lot or using the word a lot.

385
00:23:59,374 --> 00:23:59,816
Rym: did they?

386
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:00,960
Rym: when was the first time someone?

387
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,535
Rym: said spam?

388
00:24:02,403 --> 00:24:03,348
Scott: For I don't know that.

389
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:04,052
Scott: I don't know either.

390
00:24:04,253 --> 00:24:05,660
Scott: We know that was the first spam.

391
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,463
Scott: We don't know what.

392
00:24:06,603 --> 00:24:09,674
Scott: that was the first time someone called it spam.

393
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:10,175
Scott: That's very.

394
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:11,500
Scott: it's a totally different story.

395
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:15,940
Rym: Oh, well, I think email spam and usenet spam at least for the sake of discussion are effectively the same thing.

396
00:24:16,242 --> 00:24:20,546
Scott: Yeah, if you want to discuss it on that higher level share I mean basically the I.

397
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:28,869
Rym: the problem here if you break it down is simply that anytime you have a Cost of zero or effectively zero to do anything.

398
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:34,717
Rym: There is absolutely no disincentive to not do it At his purest form.

399
00:24:34,757 --> 00:24:35,019
Rym: that's it.

400
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,361
Rym: I mean.

401
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:38,732
Rym: in the past it cost money to send a letter to someone.

402
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:45,733
Rym: so if you wanted to send a letter to everyone in town saying buy Thompson's insoluble plates you had to spend postage.

403
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:46,996
Rym: it cost you something.

404
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:48,802
Rym: it might not have been much but it was something.

405
00:24:49,584 --> 00:24:53,639
Rym: and whenever there's a cost involved there's diminishing returns and all that sort of business.

406
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,340
Rym: but With the Internet if you already have an internet connection.

407
00:24:57,882 --> 00:25:02,959
Rym: It is effectively free to send as much communication as you want 24/7 and there's nothing to stop you.

408
00:25:03,683 --> 00:25:23,328
Scott: So if you're gonna send out some sort of spam Even if ninety nine point nine nine nine nine percent of people Delete it or ignore it or get it filtered out if like three people Read it and like one of those people actually buys the product that you're selling and you aren't they Spammers are legitimately selling their products.

409
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:27,200
Scott: if you try to buy penis pills from spam you will get them granted.

410
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,871
Rym: There was that awesome guy who bought the penis pills tried him They didn't work and then he sued the spammer.

411
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:32,735
Rym: and I wonder what.

412
00:25:32,795 --> 00:25:33,600
Scott: I wonder what came of it?

413
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:34,478
Scott: I don't know.

414
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:42,340
Scott: Yeah But the point is is that it cost them basically nothing to send these emails out if they make one sale from that.

415
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:51,980
Scott: They just made money for nothing almost and so if you're a company selling stuff Having a spammer send out a bunch of spam is not the worst market.

416
00:25:52,060 --> 00:26:07,848
Scott: It's you know, it's at least with that, you know exactly how much your sales you're getting per dollar spent on the advertising Whereas with say a bulletin board in Times Square it could a bulletin board Billboard in Times Square.

417
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:10,948
Scott: you have no idea what that's doing for you could do nothing for you You don't know.

418
00:26:11,457 --> 00:26:17,260
Rym: plus I mean not just look at it from the spammers perspective but from the sysadmins perspective for the normal person's perspective.

419
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:18,620
Rym: Think of a nightclub.

420
00:26:19,122 --> 00:26:24,800
Rym: Imagine a nightclub in a really popular place like in New York City in Times Square on New Year's Eve.

421
00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:32,983
Rym: Imagine if that nightclub didn't have a cover charge and no bouncer was at the gate and there was nothing to stop people from just Shoving their way in.

422
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:36,292
Scott: it would just become packed until the fire marshal kicked everyone out.

423
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:38,318
Rym: or like any health insurance.

424
00:26:38,378 --> 00:26:54,260
Rym: and in America There's a thing called a copay where basically While your insurance is gonna cover like a hundred percent or ninety-nine percent of whatever your medical stuff is They often will have this copay where if you go to the doctor no matter what they cover You have to pay like ten or fifteen dollars.

425
00:26:54,401 --> 00:26:58,100
Scott: Yeah, if I go to the doctor, I gotta give them like 20 bucks to the doctor every time I go.

426
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:02,928
Scott: So if I really need to go to the doctor I'll go to the doctor and give them 20 bucks.

427
00:27:02,928 --> 00:27:06,684
Rym: 20 bucks is effectively nothing for me because I don't go to the doctor all The time.

428
00:27:06,764 --> 00:27:08,560
Scott: yeah, but let's say I was a hypochondriac.

429
00:27:09,403 --> 00:27:11,351
Scott: Would I go to the doctor five days a week?

430
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:12,837
Scott: No, it's $100 a week.

431
00:27:12,857 --> 00:27:13,640
Scott: That's a lot of money.

432
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:18,240
Scott: So if it was zero dollars to go to the doctor and I was I have a contract.

433
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:22,618
Scott: I just live in the doctor's office because I'm crazy and it would cost me nothing.

434
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,960
Rym: now Like that's why there's so little spam on say AOL instant messengers.

435
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:37,260
Rym: They have this rate limiting thing where any given account ever tried to send someone a million Messages and I am real quick and notice how it kind of keeps blanking out your send button logger logger.

436
00:27:37,462 --> 00:27:42,532
Rym: There is a lot of al instant messenger spam though but not nearly as much as there would be if they didn't limit it like that.

437
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:51,120
Scott: the other thing that prevents you from seeing a Lot of AOL instant messenger spam is the fact that there's a feature that says don't let me receive messages from people who are my buddy.

438
00:27:51,281 --> 00:27:52,364
Rym: Never selected that.

439
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:53,689
Rym: Oh, and you know what?

440
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:56,338
Rym: I got almost no instant messenger spam ever and I put my.

441
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,482
Rym: I am Everywhere.

442
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,000
Rym: it was all over the place and all my websites forever and I never really got spam.

443
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:07,780
Scott: Yeah, I remember there was a time period where there was a lot of I am spam on and especially nail is the messenger.

444
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:09,596
Scott: But now there's not so much well one.

445
00:28:09,657 --> 00:28:13,149
Rym: back then I remember they cracked down and they Severely decreased the rates.

446
00:28:13,189 --> 00:28:16,967
Rym: if you try to type a bunch of messages really quick It doesn't let you it slows you down.

447
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,380
Rym: and that way if you've got spam accounts, they're just gonna send spam out.

448
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:24,819
Rym: You can't send so many spam out at a time and eventually you're not gonna be able to send anything at all.

449
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:35,460
Scott: Yeah, I think they also added to the default aim client a sort of warning feature that lets you say hey That's a spammer who just messaged me and I think they've pretty much solved spam on that.

450
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:36,445
Rym: Remember the?

451
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:47,219
Rym: I remember in high school and even in early RIT Remember those morning wars you'd suddenly get into on aim Yeah people where every now and then like I'd message my friend like hey bucko what's going on?

452
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:50,674
Rym: And then he'd be like Warren as many times as possible.

453
00:28:50,774 --> 00:28:51,136
Rym: Haha.

454
00:28:51,176 --> 00:28:51,718
Rym: I got you.

455
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:54,947
Scott: Yeah, that was kind of silly.

456
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:59,043
Scott: it's another reason not to use a list of messenger but anyway Spam is.

457
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:08,620
Scott: you know, it's actually kind of surprising how AOL was able to stop spam mostly I guess as far as I can see on their instant message network because it's really hard to stop it anywhere else.

458
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,557
Rym: Well, the reason the core reason that AOL could stop it was that it was their network.

459
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:14,380
Rym: They owned it.

460
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:16,509
Rym: They can make whatever changes they want.

461
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:18,016
Rym: They can do whatever they want to the servers.

462
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:18,980
Rym: They can change the clients.

463
00:29:19,101 --> 00:29:20,169
Rym: They can block clients.

464
00:29:20,673 --> 00:29:33,020
Rym: They have the power Email but the technological way that email is made Email was designed back in a day when the idea of spam was unheard of that like the idea of a virus or anything bad.

465
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:39,140
Scott: Well, they thought about it, but they realized that you know, it was being used on Computers that didn't have a lot of power.

466
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:50,739
Scott: They were very small amounts of memory and very small amounts of processor being used by a lot of people and it was a way for a bunch of people who were all using the same computer to send messages to each other.

467
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,535
Scott: and Basically they did.

468
00:29:52,596 --> 00:30:04,300
Scott: they Expanded that framework to all the way up to working on the internet without really, you know Rewriting it completely which is what it needed and I'm talking to like in terms of the protocols and all that.

469
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:19,309
Rym: It was just that in the early days of the internet, you know quote unquote the internet Generally, most everybody knew everybody and if someone did something shady like send out a million emails, ah, haha Everyone knew who it was and they just blocked him and got

470
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:19,811
Scott: rid of him.

471
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:29,017
Scott: people did think about the potential for spam but you know They didn't do anything about it or they they didn't have the processing the computer resources to do anything about.

472
00:30:29,197 --> 00:30:33,137
Rym: when the internet was a closed Garden, it was very difficult to get away with crap like that in general.

473
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:36,448
Rym: Yep, and Email has not changed since then.

474
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:44,580
Rym: the way and like one of the things was open relays Which that is a problem that has finally been solved just by everyone blocked anyone who had an open relay.

475
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:51,039
Rym: But back in the day email was set up to be super reliable and the email would get there come rain or sleep.

476
00:30:51,099 --> 00:31:05,500
Scott: nor Because because every email server was an open relay which meant if it got an Email message and the email message wasn't for someone using that server Then the email server would pass it on its way to whatever email server is supposed to go to.

477
00:31:06,103 --> 00:31:17,260
Scott: So you would have these email servers just passing Messages all around to each other and the email message would always get there because there were so many email Servers that there was always a way for the message to get to his destination.

478
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:21,360
Scott: However, the problem was is that because of all these open relays?

479
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:33,162
Scott: Anyone could send a message to anyone using any server any bajillion number of servers without you being able to know who sent it or they could pretend they sent it as someone else and it and it used to Be really easy.

480
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:37,900
Rym: I used to often send email to people with just completely forged headers and no one could tell.

481
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:40,027
Rym: Of course those days are long gone.

482
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:42,720
Scott: Luckily now everyone's disabled open relays.

483
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:48,200
Scott: So but the thing is this, you know, the internet is much more reliable and TCP IP is is better.

484
00:31:48,662 --> 00:31:52,720
Scott: So people, you know, your man your mail server connects directly to the destination.

485
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,605
Rym: TCP IP is better.

486
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:55,288
Rym: What do you mean?

487
00:31:55,308 --> 00:31:56,753
Scott: What do you mean?

488
00:31:56,793 --> 00:31:58,720
Rym: How is TCP IP better than it was then?

489
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,523
Scott: Well, it's not.

490
00:32:00,147 --> 00:32:07,240
Scott: the protocol itself is not better But the fact that the internet, you know that there's not a bunch of dial-up modems and now it's a bunch of five

491
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:11,341
Rym: Because the way you said that I was thinking TCP IP hasn't changed You know

492
00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:14,695
Scott: back in the day, you know, you try to make it TCP IP connection.

493
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:16,040
Scott: It was not so reliable.

494
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:26,353
Scott: Sometimes you get timeouts and things just because the internet sucked and now because the internet doesn't suck and if you use TCP IP 99% chance even better than that the message is gonna get through.

495
00:32:26,373 --> 00:32:35,046
Rym: but in terms of email spam I never really cared about it because to be honest and I guess Scott myself and John C Dvorak are very similar in this regard.

496
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:36,752
Rym: We never really got spam.

497
00:32:37,032 --> 00:32:40,143
Scott: Well back in the ancient AOL days I got spams.

498
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:44,760
Scott: Yeah, I never had a well when I was a little kid using AOL that didn't really bother me.

499
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,222
Scott: I didn't care.

500
00:32:45,243 --> 00:32:47,093
Scott: You know, I didn't use my email for anything important.

501
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,440
Scott: I didn't check it all that often.

502
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:49,967
Rym: I never got spam on Prodigy.

503
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:51,415
Scott: I mostly just played gemstone.

504
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:52,480
Scott: I didn't read the emails.

505
00:32:52,701 --> 00:33:03,440
Scott: Yeah, then at RIT I was getting spams, you know after at first I didn't get any spams, you know I had that, you know brand new Email account at RIT, you know, not so many spam.

506
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:10,260
Scott: But then spam started pouring in from all the people who were sending it to everyone at RIT or to random things at RIT.

507
00:33:10,441 --> 00:33:17,452
Scott: so I started using a spam filter like the one that comes in Thunderbird and I stopped getting spams.

508
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:18,540
Scott: It was all filtered out for me.

509
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:26,664
Rym: I didn't bother because to be perfectly honest once I got to college I almost entirely stopped using email and I did everything through IM and Anytime like.

510
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:30,646
Scott: I never checked my email because all there were just different things I did through IM than what I did through email.

511
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:35,564
Rym: The only things I did through email were automated things and interaction with businesses But never talking to people.

512
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:39,157
Scott: Yeah, I never really talked to people with the with the email at college.

513
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:40,000
Rym: Well now I do.

514
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:41,779
Rym: Yeah, now I do but we'll get to that.

515
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:45,000
Scott: Yeah, but when I was in college email was not for talking to human.

516
00:33:45,121 --> 00:33:47,835
Scott: Well, I guess talking to professors but never talked to friends with it.

517
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:48,660
Scott: that or family.

518
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,590
Rym: See I didn't use email to talk to professors.

519
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:55,140
Rym: Well one, I never talked to professors, but I didn't do it that often either.

520
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:58,733
Rym: We were in IT so we had to use first class.

521
00:33:58,754 --> 00:33:59,880
Scott: Oh, right, right, right.

522
00:34:00,242 --> 00:34:03,440
Scott: But I used it to talk to professors a few times and you know things like that.

523
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:12,478
Scott: But it was always for business communications Which is what I used email for in college never for personal communications and there was spam but it was all filtered out.

524
00:34:12,638 --> 00:34:14,809
Scott: So It was filtered out.

525
00:34:15,172 --> 00:34:16,040
Scott: What what's the problem?

526
00:34:16,561 --> 00:34:24,940
Rym: I don't know, but I started using email again with Gmail and all that and I'm not gonna get into the whole Why I use email again why Gmail is awesome and all that business.

527
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:33,179
Rym: But I'm gonna say this if you if spam is a problem for you There is really only one solution you need to even consider and that is using Gmail.

528
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:43,518
Rym: I don't want to sound like a Google fanboy but Gmail blocks almost all the spam in the world and it's almost never wrong and it's Far away the best free email thing out there.

529
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:48,859
Scott: yeah, and sometimes when I do get a spam like sometimes like a spam will get through I mark it as spam.

530
00:34:48,879 --> 00:35:03,860
Scott: and Sometimes like for a day or two someone will figure out a way to get a specific type of spam into into Google right and I'll get like a few of those Maybe three messages that are all similar, you know in a couple days and I'll mark them all as spam and then they're gone.

531
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,373
Scott: And it's so such a small amount that I don't even reckon.

532
00:35:07,453 --> 00:35:09,240
Scott: It doesn't even register in my mind.

533
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:10,579
Scott: You know, it's not like in the olden days.

534
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:20,019
Scott: We had to be like delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete, you know Now it's just I mark one messages spam maybe a week.

535
00:35:20,803 --> 00:35:24,300
Scott: That's a lot actually right like one a month and that I don't even notice it.

536
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:32,852
Rym: Yeah and consider this we have you know GeekNights at front recruit calm and GeekNights at gmail.com the Sheer amount of spam that is hitting those two address.

537
00:35:32,953 --> 00:35:34,880
Scott: Oh if I look in the spam, let's look at the spam folder.

538
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,987
Scott: Let me go look absolutely ludicrous.

539
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:38,652
Rym: the amount of spam that hits those things.

540
00:35:38,692 --> 00:35:41,240
Rym: but Gmail's filter is just freaking amazing.

541
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:43,199
Scott: Yep, let's go look in this.

542
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:45,446
Rym: How many do we get in the last?

543
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:48,055
Rym: I don't know whatever interval is convenient for you to look at.

544
00:35:48,316 --> 00:35:51,225
Scott: well my spam folder Currently has here.

545
00:35:51,506 --> 00:35:55,197
Scott: Let's look at today about a page of spam in the past 24 hours.

546
00:35:55,217 --> 00:35:56,923
Scott: Wow So, let's see.

547
00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:58,973
Scott: Is this I think a hundred messages here about?

548
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,520
Rym: I guess that's quite a bit of spam.

549
00:36:01,302 --> 00:36:03,132
Scott: Yeah, maybe a hundred spams a day.

550
00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:04,420
Scott: That's that's a lot.

551
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:05,462
Rym: I think the only like.

552
00:36:05,482 --> 00:36:21,270
Rym: the thing that really got me about spam when I was in RIT was that Partly because I checked my email over all over campus and partly because RIT was the way it was I Usually just SSH or telnet it into one of the big Unix boxes and then ran pine or elm to check my email.

553
00:36:21,953 --> 00:36:25,010
Rym: So deleting a bunch of spams was really annoying.

554
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,282
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I only did that when there was no alternative.

555
00:36:29,302 --> 00:36:32,173
Rym: Well, plus back then Thunderbird wasn't so great yet It crashed a lot.

556
00:36:32,193 --> 00:36:33,077
Scott: Well it back.

557
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,301
Scott: it was a period of time.

558
00:36:34,341 --> 00:36:38,016
Scott: I used Eudora and there's a period of time Using like the squirrel.

559
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:41,309
Rym: as long as I was at RIT, I pretty much only use pine and elm.

560
00:36:41,891 --> 00:36:47,510
Scott: Yeah, I used a bunch of different clients and now eventually just settled with the Gmail and give everything else the finger.

561
00:36:48,594 --> 00:36:49,597
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty much on.

562
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:53,210
Rym: I mean Google would have to do something pretty fucking evil for me to leave Gmail.

563
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:55,356
Rym: Yeah, oh, well, well think about.

564
00:36:55,376 --> 00:36:57,503
Rym: the worst thing Google can do to me is tell the truth.

565
00:36:57,805 --> 00:36:59,290
Rym: They could reveal all my emails.

566
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:05,610
Rym: Oh, no, look Rym made fun of that one podcast that he's friends with the people who do it, but he doesn't like their show.

567
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:06,795
Scott: Oh, no.

568
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:07,196
Scott: Yeah.

569
00:37:07,437 --> 00:37:10,290
Scott: Well, I think it's still weird that you know, there are some people out there.

570
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,742
Scott: We're still complaining about spam and it's like you have a filter.

571
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:14,726
Scott: They all work.

572
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:15,770
Rym: Why don't something scary?

573
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:17,154
Rym: At work.

574
00:37:17,595 --> 00:37:20,870
Rym: I was explaining to someone that Google has an email thing called Gmail.

575
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:26,170
Rym: Wow, and I learned that almost no one at my job knows about or uses Gmail.

576
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,942
Rym: They all have like Yahoo accounts or hotmail accounts and they just don't work.

577
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:39,520
Rym: one guy just doesn't have the internet at home And he I was like, yeah, I'll send you an email if I need whatever in the morning and he's like I can't check my email till I get into work.

578
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,354
Rym: I Can't fathom that.

579
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:42,857
Rym: I'm sorry.

580
00:37:43,098 --> 00:37:45,247
Scott: Well, they can't fathom us not having cable.

581
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:45,950
Scott: It's the same thing.

582
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,015
Rym: Yeah, I guess that's true.

583
00:37:47,396 --> 00:37:50,369
Rym: But obviously and clearly we're right and they're wrong.

584
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:54,222
Scott: Well, actually there's something else I want to talk about.

585
00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:55,269
Scott: is I saw this word.

586
00:37:56,012 --> 00:38:05,910
Scott: It seems like it's someone's intentionally trying to coin this word, you know, it's not like one of those words that's coined You know, I guess naturally or organically like a meat space or spam, right?

587
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:11,928
Scott: Basically, they're trying to coin this word bacon BACN not BACO at BACN.

588
00:38:13,054 --> 00:38:15,970
Rym: And no well, no thumbs down.

589
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:18,279
Scott: Anyway, what it refers to?

590
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:20,230
Scott: I think that we do need a word for this.

591
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:27,542
Scott: I don't know if bacon is the right word, but all those emails that you get that aren't spam But they're not real emails either.

592
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:32,634
Scott: like, you know Your registration with the forum Here's your activation code.

593
00:38:32,795 --> 00:38:39,090
Scott: or here is your weekly update something or here is the email from cron or here is you know?

594
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,190
Scott: The notification that you got a message on some website.

595
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:50,070
Rym: I gotta say I don't need a word for that because to be honest I just set up filters to where all those things are put into relevant categories and then I don't even think about them.

596
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:52,050
Scott: Yeah, I also do the same thing.

597
00:38:52,110 --> 00:39:00,550
Scott: However, there's some people out there who are trying to think up perhaps a more Intuitive and useful way to handle all the the sort of bacon messages.

598
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:04,205
Rym: I'm okay calling it bacon, but BACON.

599
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:08,920
Rym: Yeah Taking the O out does not make it cooler.

600
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,326
Scott: It makes it web 2.0.

601
00:39:11,326 --> 00:39:17,426
Rym: No, that's like web 2.7 Because it's not semantic yet and it's not useful like web 2.0.

602
00:39:17,426 --> 00:39:22,410
Scott: It's just stupid Yeah, but in some ways I think bacon is the new spam.

603
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:27,043
Scott: I mean if I look at my email, right, but that's not bad I want it some of it.

604
00:39:27,104 --> 00:39:27,850
Scott: I want some of it.

605
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,930
Rym: I don't know you want then it's spam if you didn't want it, but see that sort of thing.

606
00:39:32,111 --> 00:39:34,386
Scott: It's like I didn't want it, but I sort of signed up for it.

607
00:39:34,427 --> 00:39:39,364
Scott: Like look here Here's an invoice I get every month from there with the hosting bill on it, right?

608
00:39:39,785 --> 00:39:41,049
Scott: I don't ever look at it.

609
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:48,070
Scott: It just fills up my inbox with more messages, but it's not spam because it's not an unsolicited someone trying to sell me something.

610
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,924
Scott: It's just a message in my inbox that I really don't want to see.

611
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,670
Rym: so it's well though that's for record-keeping.

612
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:54,495
Rym: You don't need to see it.

613
00:39:54,515 --> 00:39:56,849
Rym: what I for all those things what I do is I set up a filter.

614
00:39:57,252 --> 00:39:59,370
Scott: I do have a filter, but it's still there.

615
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:06,568
Rym: I have a label a category goes into it skips my inbox and goes straight there and it's already marked as red So I don't even look in there.

616
00:40:06,931 --> 00:40:12,450
Rym: But if I need to look up for whatever reason an old invoice or an old record, they're all there ready to go.

617
00:40:12,531 --> 00:40:13,590
Rym: Yeah, I've invented space.

618
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,117
Scott: I do the same thing, but it there.

619
00:40:16,237 --> 00:40:21,110
Scott: I think there could be a way of handling them more like gracefully because I don't know.

620
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:22,286
Scott: That's why people are thinking about it.

621
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:26,870
Rym: They're not gonna want to host a website that archives all that crap for you to look at on a moment.

622
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:27,934
Scott: They don't need to do that.

623
00:40:27,974 --> 00:40:28,335
Scott: that there's.

624
00:40:28,456 --> 00:40:32,169
Scott: there's other things we could do with these messages that I think they're giving them to you.

625
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:37,350
Rym: You if you wanted you could set up a thing that automatically not something they can do something we can do.

626
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:44,256
Rym: Yeah, you know what you should do it take them have them automatically populate some database You've got and delete from your email.

627
00:40:44,377 --> 00:40:45,421
Scott: You could do something like that.

628
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:46,465
Scott: Yeah, I did do that.

629
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,850
Scott: then something like that.

630
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:51,352
Scott: But yeah, people are working on something like that ways to handle bacon That is.

631
00:40:51,412 --> 00:40:54,805
Rym: that is interesting as long as you're saying the O in the bacon.

632
00:40:54,825 --> 00:40:56,090
Rym: I'm cool with whatever you do.

633
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,341
Scott: Yeah, they're spelling it BACN to be cool.

634
00:40:58,743 --> 00:41:00,090
Rym: I'm not gonna do that.

635
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:03,741
Rym: Yeah, and I think I can resist that one because it's not a name change.

636
00:41:03,782 --> 00:41:04,624
Rym: It's a name coining.

637
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:05,808
Scott: it is it is.

638
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:15,680
Rym: It's not like the the revolution or capstone or physical plants physical plant Facilities management service or that Phoenix web browser.

639
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,624
Rym: That was so awesome.

640
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:17,587
Scott: Oh, man.

641
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:18,170
Scott: That was the best web.

642
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,524
Scott: I love that web browser lot better than shitty-ass Firefox.

643
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:21,469
Scott: I want you to bring it back.

644
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:22,977
Rym: Firebird wasn't so great.

645
00:41:23,017 --> 00:41:24,484
Rym: But Phoenix that was where it was at.

646
00:41:24,504 --> 00:41:25,710
Scott: It was definitely where it was at.

647
00:41:27,591 --> 00:41:29,297
Scott: Do you have anything else to say about spam?

648
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,850
Scott: not really people who send it are kind of scummy.

649
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:38,550
Scott: But on the other hand a lot of the people who receipt like there are some places that send on.

650
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:47,650
Scott: You know, there's unsolicited spam, but then there's you signed up for it and now you're getting it spam Which is I sort of don't have sympathy for those people but also because they should be filtering.

651
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:50,548
Rym: Yeah, but the answer once again just use Gmail.

652
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,274
Rym: There's no reason not to.

653
00:41:52,615 --> 00:42:02,672
Scott: there is one more thing to discuss and that is some people out there do want to send Legitimate mass emails, you know, that's not spam usually bacon actually they.

654
00:42:02,994 --> 00:42:17,770
Scott: there's someone who has a legitimate reason to send email to a lot of people and Because of anti-spam measures by say AOL and Yahoo and Google You need to jump through these tremendous hoops of all sorts to get white-listed by these people or else all your emails get blocked.

655
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:23,655
Rym: my take on that and I've always been this way and I've noticed that Culturally on the internet.

656
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:30,550
Rym: There's been a shift toward this way of thinking not quite to my extent But in the early days of spam there were two camps.

657
00:42:30,912 --> 00:42:31,334
Rym: There was the.

658
00:42:31,696 --> 00:42:51,355
Rym: I don't think there's a bunch of ways you could break it up or call them different things but on one side there are the people who believe that Getting all the email intended for you is better is more important than blocking all the spam and the other end Blocking all the spam is more important than getting all of the email sent to you and I have always been one of those people I tended to.

659
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:56,797
Rym: I would rather not see any spam and Miss the occasional email that looked like a spam.

660
00:42:57,439 --> 00:42:59,524
Rym: then ever get spam but not miss email.

661
00:42:59,565 --> 00:43:00,367
Scott: Yes, I agree.

662
00:43:00,607 --> 00:43:08,490
Scott: as an email Receiver I agree that I would rather see no spam and miss a few emails intended for me.

663
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:18,770
Rym: Originally, however, the culture was the opposite and I just think the internet culture has shifted lately and people basically out So fed up with spam that they said, you know what fine block it all.

664
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:22,990
Rym: I don't give a shit block all of China cuz I'm not gonna get email from there anyway in that kind of business.

665
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:27,697
Scott: However as an email sender it is frustrating for example our forum.

666
00:43:27,817 --> 00:43:32,481
Scott: when you sign up for our forum, it sends you an email that says Congratulations, you have been approved.

667
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:40,450
Scott: where your forum membership is clear You know you can go sign in if using hotmail you don't get that message because their spam filter filters us out.

668
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,776
Scott: But again, it's not spam.

669
00:43:42,157 --> 00:43:46,676
Rym: The answer is Gmail because Gmail blocks almost none of that I know but it's see.

670
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:50,710
Scott: as a reader I use Gmail, but I can't force anyone else to use it.

671
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,779
Scott: So I am in a situation where I am forced.

672
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:54,963
Scott: I have in a message.

673
00:43:55,043 --> 00:43:57,390
Scott: I want to send to someone using hotmail.

674
00:43:57,912 --> 00:43:59,841
Scott: I really wanted to get through.

675
00:43:59,921 --> 00:44:03,138
Scott: so they know that they're approved for the forum They wanted to get through.

676
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:13,325
Scott: but it's not happening and it is Frustrating that my non spam is treated as spam and in order to get that undone is such a crazy amount of work It's not worth it.

677
00:44:13,991 --> 00:44:17,503
Rym: I guess I'm just of the mind of I'd rather screw the senders than the receivers.

678
00:44:17,804 --> 00:44:22,661
Rym: because if the receivers keep getting screwed That there there's just people stop using email.

679
00:44:22,982 --> 00:44:23,263
Scott: Yeah.

680
00:44:23,524 --> 00:44:23,705
Scott: Yeah.

681
00:44:23,865 --> 00:44:24,026
Scott: Yeah.

682
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:30,308
Scott: Oh, well And the thing is there's no other way to like contact any people I block with a broad brush.

683
00:44:30,388 --> 00:44:36,087
Rym: at RIT I actually blocked any email pretty much any email from outside of the United States at one point.

684
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:43,448
Rym: Yeah Because that's where all the spam came from back then and I didn't receive email from people outside of the US back then.

685
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:47,049
Rym: and the Few people I knew overseas that I wanted to talk to I used aim.

686
00:44:47,612 --> 00:44:48,679
Rym: so I just blocked it all.

687
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,435
Rym: and now Gmail don't have to worry but I'll like adblock.

688
00:44:52,475 --> 00:44:56,490
Rym: right if I ever see an ad I block that entire domain at the lowest level.

689
00:44:56,952 --> 00:45:00,130
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure that probably makes some web pages look pretty ugly.

690
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:01,160
Rym: Oh, it does but you know what?

691
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:05,910
Rym: a lot of those web pages They don't look ugly because it's just text now and there's no graphics.

692
00:45:07,191 --> 00:45:08,035
Scott: It's pretty good stuff.

693
00:45:08,337 --> 00:45:11,290
Rym: The only thing I don't do that for as far cuz I like to see the little Florida tag.

694
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:12,933
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

695
00:45:13,535 --> 00:45:16,485
Scott: Oh, well, I think we're done talking about spam here.

696
00:45:16,646 --> 00:45:18,993
Scott: if you get spam You suck.

697
00:45:19,434 --> 00:45:21,580
Rym: use Gmail use some technology.

698
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,024
Scott: it all works really well.

699
00:45:23,546 --> 00:45:24,889
Scott: if you send spam you suck.

700
00:45:27,054 --> 00:45:29,813
Scott: And if you're trying to send something that's being blocked as fan That's frustrating.

701
00:45:30,154 --> 00:45:36,903
Rym: and if you the only other thing if you're trying to have a mailing list like an email list Those are so obsolete.

702
00:45:37,306 --> 00:45:43,458
Rym: Oh, yeah, seriously Get a forum or a blog RSS or an RSS or a blog.

703
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:48,214
Rym: or if you're gonna do a mailing list do it through Gmail with Collaboration or something.

704
00:45:48,254 --> 00:45:50,201
Rym: don't just do a straight-up like list.

705
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:53,050
Scott: Yeah, the old-school listservs are not cool.

706
00:45:53,192 --> 00:45:56,034
Scott: They should all die in a fire Like the only people use.

707
00:45:56,857 --> 00:46:00,747
Scott: some people have like the listserv news group integration where it's sort of like they.

708
00:46:00,787 --> 00:46:03,590
Scott: they get copied to Each other's groups are equally obsolete.

709
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:06,003
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why so many people still use them.

710
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:08,313
Rym: IBM uses them internally But that was kind of cool.

711
00:46:08,374 --> 00:46:11,645
Rym: that in the real world news groups are no longer useful.

712
00:46:11,665 --> 00:46:13,210
Rym: There's far better technology.

713
00:46:13,591 --> 00:46:16,801
Scott: Yeah, I don't even know news servers are just so confusing.

714
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:19,970
Rym: well like like that whole side of the internet internet.

715
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,574
Rym: you know listservs news groups and IRC.

716
00:46:23,135 --> 00:46:24,016
Rym: all that's left over.

717
00:46:24,056 --> 00:46:33,170
Rym: there are people who don't know there are better solutions and Really really shady people doing really really shady things because the authorities don't really know how to deal with that old stuff.

718
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:42,949
Scott: Yeah, that's the old underground like original internet communication protocol stuff And it's mostly basically a bunch of nerds and a bunch of underground action that God we should talk about.

719
00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:44,256
Rym: the old IRC.

720
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:45,805
Rym: those were not good days.

721
00:46:45,925 --> 00:46:46,730
Scott: No not good days.

722
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:50,870
Scott: Not the only IRC that's worth going to is like free node, but you're just a bunch of open-source people.

723
00:46:51,131 --> 00:46:53,301
Rym: Yeah, but even then I just I don't care enough.

724
00:46:53,381 --> 00:46:55,852
Scott: I don't go there unless there's no other solution I can find.

725
00:46:55,912 --> 00:46:58,600
Rym: I'm never gonna load up Merkur perch again ever.

726
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,790
Scott: I could just use you know my aim client to go on there.

727
00:47:08,895 --> 00:47:11,477
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

728
00:47:11,497 --> 00:47:13,678
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

731
00:47:32,324 --> 00:47:36,480
Rym: Mondays are science and technology Tuesdays We have video games board games and RPGs.
