00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,676
Scott: It's Wednesday February 7th.

2
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:15,988
Scott: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,027 --> 00:00:19,009
Scott: We review shoujo kakumei utenna.

4
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:27,337
Rym: Let's do this All right, so today odd Something kind of interesting after me.

5
00:00:27,397 --> 00:00:30,106
Rym: I was walking into a Starbucks on my way home from work.

6
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,190
Rym: I wanted a Starbucks.

7
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:33,678
Rym: I wanted a cookie and I wanted some espresso.

8
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:35,704
Scott: There's a Starbucks doesn't have good cookies.

9
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:37,590
Scott: They're all weird crazy cookies.

10
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:39,156
Rym: I got a standard cookie.

11
00:00:39,196 --> 00:00:39,899
Rym: It was pretty good.

12
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:42,570
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is for various reasons.

13
00:00:42,771 --> 00:01:05,476
Rym: I have the Russian national anthem stuck in my head, you know And I just happened to be whistling it as I walked in and there was this guy you know kind of obviously college-age stand in there outside the coffee shop like looking through a book and He gets his look on his face and he looks up at me as I'm walking by and he says That's a Russian national anthem.

14
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:10,585
Rym: and I said, hey, yep, and I went in and got my coffee and my cookie And then I went on my way.

15
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:13,036
Scott: It's a good thing.

16
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:15,330
Scott: You don't know the the Israeli national anthem?

17
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,125
Scott: It's much catchier and it gets a lot more attention if anyone recognizes great granted.

18
00:01:20,306 --> 00:01:28,089
Rym: the other day I was walking into one of these hospitals and I was also humming the Russian national anthem.

19
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:30,038
Scott: What the hell's wrong with you?

20
00:01:30,058 --> 00:01:31,103
Rym: It's been stuck in my head.

21
00:01:31,263 --> 00:01:32,589
Scott: You can't even read cerulex.

22
00:01:33,072 --> 00:01:34,722
Rym: No, I can you know what I can?

23
00:01:34,742 --> 00:01:35,949
Rym: it's just I read it wrong.

24
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,679
Scott: Yeah, right you got me doing this all pockner.

25
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,261
Scott: now you suck.

26
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:44,249
Rym: yeah pockner is an in-joke from high school ECCP.

27
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:53,849
Rym: Okay, yeah, but I'm humming it and I'm walking by all these old people waiting at a hospital slash nursing home And one of them looks up at me.

28
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:57,663
Rym: now I don't know I can't know ever if this guy knew it.

29
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:02,528
Rym: if I just you know Maybe he's just an old man in a hospital, you know, it hurts.

30
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:07,487
Scott: when he peed He saw a young punk kid with long hair and he said girl or maybe he was just going girl.

31
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:09,798
Rym: cuz it hurts when he Pees, I don't know who knows.

32
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:12,150
Rym: but the thing is I'm humming the Russian national anthem.

33
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,870
Rym: He looks up and I would swear that the look he was giving me was damn this country going to hell.

34
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,538
Rym: Communists wandering around.

35
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:22,110
Scott: I think it's safe to assume that you know.

36
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:32,404
Scott: But the other question is, you know, if he was an old man, even if he was all crotchety and anti commie He still has to be smart if he recognizes the Russian national anthem.

37
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:32,684
Scott: Yeah.

38
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:37,038
Rym: Yeah plus I mean back then Communism take it or leave it.

39
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:39,008
Rym: the Soviet Union wasn't the best place to live.

40
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:39,370
Rym: It's not.

41
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:43,880
Scott: It doesn't mean the national anthems are no good.

42
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,245
Rym: no, actually I really like their night.

43
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:49,903
Rym: in fact, I like all Old-school Soviet Russian music a lot.

44
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:51,830
Scott: It's always a problem.

45
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:59,477
Scott: You know when something is like a song, you know has maybe let's say someone made a really racist song But it was such a good song.

46
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:06,430
Scott: like you like listening to it cuz it sounds good There's good music there, but it's also horribly racist.

47
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:10,310
Scott: You know, if you don't agree with it somehow listening to the song can cause you trouble.

48
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:12,510
Rym: That's come up with a lot of reggae music.

49
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:19,752
Rym: Well, maybe not a lot but more than you'd expect where if you actually listen to the lyrics, they're really kind of homophobic and anti-gay Really?

50
00:03:19,852 --> 00:03:21,057
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of weird.

51
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:24,790
Rym: Maybe it's just a few of the songs I listened to but it was kind of weird.

52
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,270
Scott: No woman no cry, I don't think.

53
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:40,087
Rym: Anyway I don't want to talk about this cuz I don't want to give these people any I don't know press But at the same time I got to talk about how dumb this is.

54
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:46,719
Rym: So the finalists have been announced for those BS anime awards.

55
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:54,330
Rym: Oh, yeah the American anime Awards Which I cannot say for sure and this is strictly my opinion.

56
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:56,570
Rym: So I can't be sued for any sort of slander.

57
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:08,670
Rym: But it is my belief that the anime American anime Awards are nothing more than a scam - they're just a crack to either make some money or get enough clout to trick people into giving them money.

58
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:16,312
Scott: I think the only reason the anime Awards exist is because one some guy thinks he's all smart and he says You know what?

59
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:20,110
Scott: Anime is all popular here now, and there isn't an award ceremony for it.

60
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:25,050
Scott: We should make one and another guy says hey, you know what this New York Comic Con is gonna be big.

61
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,570
Scott: It's gets way out of control.

62
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:33,850
Scott: I mean they already sold out the Saturday You know and anime has got to get a bigger presence to show that we're bigger than those stupid superhero comics.

63
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:40,549
Scott: So we're gonna have our award ceremony at the same time Right down the road in a hotel.

64
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:41,493
Rym: I just.

65
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,650
Rym: it's got to be a scam and I'm not exactly sure how they plan to make money off of it.

66
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,638
Rym: But it's just.

67
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,030
Rym: it's such crap.

68
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:51,550
Scott: It's just a big press event where they push anime by having awards.

69
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,072
Scott: You know.

70
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:57,369
Scott: that way all the companies can put little label on their DVD case that says what an American anime award.

71
00:04:57,429 --> 00:04:58,815
Rym: OMG Yeah, speaking of that.

72
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:09,980
Rym: I mean, I'm not gonna read this list of the things that got nominated by this stuff But one they've got categories like best actor best actress Best actor in a comedy best cash.

73
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:17,686
Rym: now, that's the one that really bothers me because best actress or actor whatever You know good voice actor considering that a lot of voice actors are on board with this thing.

74
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:21,093
Rym: I can understand that Best cast.

75
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:24,020
Rym: now, does that mean best voice acting cast?

76
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:26,827
Rym: or does that mean best character cast?

77
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,794
Scott: I Have no idea.

78
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:33,275
Rym: because if it's and if it's if it's the former I don't know.

79
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:36,050
Rym: and even then all the anime they pick I mean what?

80
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,970
Rym: FLCL fma ghost in the shell standalone complex second gig in a yasha and Naruto.

81
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:44,186
Scott: I think the major problem with these awards is twofold.

82
00:05:44,246 --> 00:05:53,675
Scott: number one It's the categories are ill-defined and the requirements for what's nominated or ill-defined and it's sort of fast and loose Like they don't even care.

83
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:57,049
Scott: and the second problem is it's an entirely fan voting.

84
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,849
Scott: now I have no problem if you have won the category of fan favorite or something like that.

85
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:02,973
Scott: But to have.

86
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:18,190
Scott: I mean most award ceremonies, you know, I don't even respect the Oscars Which are probably the premiere award ceremony on the planet, but if you're gonna get if you're gonna approach Respectable levels you got to have some method that it you know, at least has criteria.

87
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:25,870
Scott: We're X, you know experts in the field in quotes, you know Yeah vote by some ballot or something.

88
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,469
Scott: You need to have some sort of system that at least someone can look at it and go, huh?

89
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,404
Scott: There's some credibility here and not just random picks by fans that have no meaning.

90
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:40,507
Rym: they had a poorly put together Woefully inaccurate and broken online voting thing.

91
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:50,650
Scott: Yeah the thing that really bothers me is just how some of this stuff turned out because It seems like anything goes in this no matter what year it came out as long as he came out in America.

92
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:53,568
Scott: Right and they have a category best manga.

93
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:57,850
Scott: now Don't even get me started on why there's a vote for best manga in the anime Awards.

94
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,782
Scott: That's like having a vote for like best TV show at the Oscars.

95
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:11,336
Rym: more important beyond all that I gotta read the list of what's nominated for best manga and I think it will be painfully obvious to everyone out there one What's missing from this.

96
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:18,462
Rym: and well there bleach death note fruits basket Naruto and here's the one that really burns me.

97
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:20,190
Rym: neon Genesis Evangelion.

98
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,583
Rym: Oh if it stopped right there, I would have said alright because that's actually a really good month.

99
00:07:23,664 --> 00:07:26,989
Rym: Okay, um colon angelic days.

100
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:34,168
Scott: Alright now Considering there's no time limit on this and it's the American Anime Awards.

101
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:37,300
Rym: So Anime, I have a nomination.

102
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,882
Scott: What's your nominee?

103
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:39,788
Rym: I'd like to nominate a Hinata re.

104
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,937
Rym: yeah I was on with Tezuka G.

105
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:43,524
Scott: I don't know that's tough.

106
00:07:43,987 --> 00:07:46,814
Scott: I mean, uh Maybe we should nominate.

107
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:47,536
Scott: I don't know.

108
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:48,921
Scott: maybe ghost in the shell.

109
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:50,586
Scott: Yeah, how about Akira?

110
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:51,428
Rym: Ah, Buddha?

111
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:55,260
Rym: Oh gee, I don't know almost everything Tezuka did.

112
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:58,070
Scott: I mean, there's no time limit on these things, right?

113
00:07:58,151 --> 00:08:00,090
Scott: I mean these things came out in very different years.

114
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:07,216
Scott: They've got stuff on this list like a Rhonda one-half OVA all the way up to like Helsing ultimate Oh, which is even out yet.

115
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:09,604
Rym: Alright best anime feature Akira.

116
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:16,319
Rym: Alright, I'll respect that Inuyasha movie for Pokemon movie 8 what the hell.

117
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,308
Rym: the Fullmetal Alchemist movie and advent children.

118
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:31,657
Scott: Yeah If you're gonna do best anime feature, I could respect the awards I could respect Akira being on the list But if you're not gonna have I don't know Any Miyazaki's on the list?

119
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:33,101
Scott: You're not having.

120
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:36,090
Scott: I don't know what else could go on there.

121
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,756
Rym: I don't know everything good ever.

122
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:40,024
Rym: I mean look at best comedy talk about.

123
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:40,626
Rym: they've got.

124
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:42,847
Rym: oh my god is TV Which is a very new show.

125
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:47,329
Rym: flcl Koto chop surprised the internet even knows what that is anymore.

126
00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:49,931
Rym: run my head now.

127
00:08:50,292 --> 00:09:02,010
Rym: Rama was the big thing a long time ago, but I Rarely run into anime fans who have even they even know what Rama is these days and The Tenchi Muyo OAV which wallet is hilarious again.

128
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,916
Rym: No one watches Tenchi anymore.

129
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:05,200
Rym: How did this get voted up?

130
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,966
Scott: I don't I have no idea.

131
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:09,380
Scott: I think that this award is just a bunch of crack of shit.

132
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:10,985
Scott: No one cares about it.

133
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:12,952
Scott: And that's that's all it's gonna be.

134
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:17,666
Rym: so we're never gonna talk about this again Unless I don't know.

135
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:20,380
Rym: maybe we'll talk about how stupid it is after they have the awards.

136
00:09:21,022 --> 00:09:30,880
Scott: All that you should know is that if anyone ever tries to brag about winning the American Anime Award Or if they're proud of winning an American Anime Award, you should look on them with disdain.

137
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:36,151
Scott: disdain That's the word that should be used.

138
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,619
Rym: alright, so what do you got for me?

139
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:43,820
Scott: Well, you know when you watch movies from Japan, they usually have logos at the beginning of all the companies that made them.

140
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,814
Scott: Well, I guess that's true in America, too Yeah, and you seem to notice the same logos recurring like.

141
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:55,614
Scott: you'll notice touchstone Which is actually Disney in disguise or new line or Miramax or Universal.

142
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:57,760
Rym: my favorite one was always the Easter Island guys.

143
00:09:58,282 --> 00:10:06,388
Scott: Oh, yeah, so in Japan when you watch certain things, you notice emotion, which is the Easter Island guys Which I think is actually a secret codename for just Bandai movies.

144
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:07,311
Scott: that I'm not sure.

145
00:10:08,113 --> 00:10:13,647
Scott: and you'll also notice things like Toho Which is usually before a Godzilla movie.

146
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:16,837
Scott: and another one you'll notice is the one with the little Phoenix bird.

147
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:17,860
Scott: This is katakawa.

148
00:10:18,502 --> 00:10:22,096
Scott: Well katakawa happens to be a very smart company.

149
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:27,554
Scott: very smart Because what they are going to do is they are going to sell sell.

150
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:29,500
Scott: so I must assume DRM is gonna happen.

151
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:53,611
Scott: But they're going to sell some of their movies about 200 of their movies in the United States on Bit torrent, so I imagine there's going to be some sort of system where you go to their website And you pay the money and then they give you a torrent file and then you run the torrent file and you Get the movie in some sort of DRM format, and then you watch it.

152
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:58,487
Scott: That's the only way this could possibly work, so That's pretty smart of them.

153
00:10:58,588 --> 00:10:58,969
Scott: actually.

154
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:06,815
Rym: yeah, I mean it's as if a dozen Local American anime companies went oh snap and were suddenly silence.

155
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:07,176
Scott: Well.

156
00:11:07,196 --> 00:11:08,580
Scott: It's mostly not gonna be anime.

157
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,020
Scott: I mean they're bringing over the ring the live-action one.

158
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:22,386
Scott: So Expect you know a lot of these live-action Japanese movies are probably gonna be big-time ones you've seen before But in a list of 200 this bound to be some good stuff We've never seen.

159
00:11:22,446 --> 00:11:31,523
Scott: and if it wasn't DRM Or if it was DRM didn't played in Linux even I might be willing to actually pay Maybe.

160
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:33,912
Rym: yeah, I mean a lot of these movies.

161
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:39,260
Rym: We really like to say I mean one of the primary things I do at anime cons now is watch live-action Asian cinema.

162
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:43,216
Scott: Oh, that's the best part because you go to the anime rooms, and it's all stuff.

163
00:11:43,256 --> 00:11:44,300
Scott: You've seen stuff.

164
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,732
Scott: You know what it is stuff.

165
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:46,700
Scott: That's coming out soon.

166
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,483
Scott: You don't care about.

167
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,180
Scott: you're not wasting your time in an anime con seeing it because you could see it later on DVD.

168
00:11:52,182 --> 00:12:00,060
Scott: If it's live-action stuff you at a convention usually It's not gonna be easy to get those DVDs in the United States with subtitles.

169
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:10,362
Scott: So the ability to watch them there is special so it's worth your time at a convention to go to that room Especially since a lot of times at least maybe it's just because of the kinds of live-action movies We like.

170
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:16,020
Rym: they're also the kinds of things that are very much enhanced by having a lot of like-minded people in the room with you.

171
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:28,193
Scott: Yep, well, it's actually Kadokawa like has a US like subsidiary or something that's actually doing all the work And it's gonna put the subtitles and all that jazz on there.

172
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:28,475
Rym: Well.

173
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:29,580
Rym: I guess we'll see how this goes.

174
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,527
Rym: I mean this could usher in a new era.

175
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,143
Scott: it could and if I see good stuff on there I'm like.

176
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:43,510
Scott: I don't know if I'd buy it if it's DRM But I would definitely write them an email like if you weren't DRM I totally would give you like a hundred dollars.

177
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:44,978
Scott: you get all those movies.

178
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:53,812
Rym: OMG Things of the day now.

179
00:12:53,993 --> 00:13:00,369
Rym: as you are all aware I threw down with a theme week my own theme week on my things the day this week And I have to continue it now.

180
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:01,394
Rym: the theme was Hitler.

181
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:05,492
Rym: it was born to be alive And I've already had two born to be alive one of which had Hitler.

182
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:08,834
Rym: so to make up for that second born to be alive I gotta have another Hitler in here.

183
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:19,060
Rym: Thus this is someone took a movie about Hitler and Replaced the subtitles with something very funny about Hitler trying to get a new car.

184
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:23,580
Scott: I said the original movie about Hitler was like a serious historical movie, right?

185
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:34,697
Scott: I'd imagine so I don't like a historical drama where it's not exactly what was real, but it was you know An interpretation of what actually happened in a dramatic cinematic fashion something like that.

186
00:13:34,817 --> 00:13:46,120
Rym: see I'm not really sure it I didn't look into it, but the fact remains that Hitler trying to get a new car is actually pretty funny Especially especially cuz it's so true everything he says about cars.

187
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:51,200
Rym: Yeah, that is kind of sad that part, but it's it's just interesting to watch Hitler.

188
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,453
Rym: You know the horrible dictator, and he just wants a new car.

189
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:58,245
Scott: well actually a really good Hitler actor Not the actual Hitler.

190
00:13:58,867 --> 00:13:59,028
Rym: well.

191
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:08,240
Rym: Yeah, I mean there was that rare video of the actual Hitler with his rice doubt civic, but All right, so what do you got?

192
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:17,106
Scott: well, I'm sure everyone is aware of the sport of competitive eating Aka food fighting.

193
00:14:17,888 --> 00:14:21,177
Rym: I'm aware of it in the sense that some Japanese guy always wins.

194
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:22,160
Scott: Yeah, there's that guy.

195
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:22,939
Scott: What's his name?

196
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,534
Scott: Kobayashi, he's like the grand famous master of eating lots of food.

197
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,660
Rym: for some reason all I think is Kaiser.

198
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:41,080
Scott: So say yeah, well, there's this whole Article on wired about this girl Who sort of I don't know she's like the hot stuff in the food eating these days named Natsuko, Sony.

199
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:45,876
Scott: She's 21 years old five feet four inches, and she weighs 95 pounds.

200
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:48,004
Scott: Get this ready.

201
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:51,696
Scott: she can guess how many pieces of sushi she can eat in 30 minutes.

202
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:56,359
Rym: all right in 30 minutes I could eat about a little over 30 pieces of sushi.

203
00:14:57,082 --> 00:15:02,180
Rym: So maybe for your stomach like get full embargo it would be full where I wouldn't feel so good.

204
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,568
Rym: But I think I could eat 30 pieces of sushi in 30 minutes.

205
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:13,040
Scott: She can eat a hundred and eighty three pieces of sushi ah And she can eat 20 pounds of food in one sitting.

206
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,288
Scott: So so part of this wired article.

207
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:20,600
Scott: this is a video the Kobayashi guy eating dumplings and stuff here And there's some others.

208
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:39,977
Scott: There's some other videos and a lot of text in the article But my thing of the day is the video at the top which shows a generic Japanese daytime variety TV show and this chick who's actually kind of cute and She starts off the show by weighing herself, and it's like 43 kilograms.

209
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:45,319
Rym: I thought you're gonna say pounds, and I was picturing this tiny little stick of a.

210
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:48,708
Scott: no She's not that tiny, but she's pretty small.

211
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:50,754
Scott: She's a little Japanese person right?

212
00:15:51,336 --> 00:16:01,366
Scott: she weighs 95 pounds and They have this giant bowl of ramen bigger than like all of us could eat this bowl of ramen Collectively, and it would be a good meal.

213
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:06,819
Scott: It's like kind of like getting a giant sub you know yeah, and She eats.

214
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:11,458
Scott: She just keeps eating it and like all these other people on the show cuz you know how these shows go.

215
00:16:11,498 --> 00:16:21,799
Scott: you've watched enough of them on YouTube You know they're eating their normal food and laughing it up and telling jokes and she's saying stuff and I can't tell what they're saying cuz I don't know the language, but they're saying funny stuff.

216
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:31,990
Scott: and She just keeps eating keeps eating keep playing keep playing and this bowl Like disappears over time and at the end.

217
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,516
Scott: She weighs herself again, and it's 50 kilos.

218
00:16:36,322 --> 00:16:41,740
Scott: She had she put seven kilos of food in her stomach, and she even says like Nana kilo.

219
00:16:43,187 --> 00:16:46,651
Rym: Wow Yeah, I don't know how I feel about this sport.

220
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:47,635
Rym: I can't imagine.

221
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:48,599
Rym: That's good for you.

222
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:49,951
Scott: I can't imagine.

223
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:50,940
Scott: It's good for you either.

224
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,174
Rym: I mean we just ate at the cafe Maya, and I ate more food than I should have.

225
00:16:55,194 --> 00:17:10,589
Rym: there was a piece of fried banana with cheesecake and ice cream a little tiny piece sitting on the plate and I couldn't bring myself to eat it, and I still feel kind of bloated my stomach sticking out like ah Imagine eating this thing had to be.

226
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:13,700
Scott: I don't know how many bowls of ramen could have fit in this giant bowl.

227
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,650
Rym: You know what you can't eat ten bowls of ramen.

228
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:17,358
Scott: I guess seven kilos of ramen.

229
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:22,780
Rym: God that's a lot of Robin right, so let's get out into something more erudite.

230
00:17:47,606 --> 00:17:53,800
Rym: So like we said we're gonna review shoujo kakumei utena which is one of our favorite anime ever.

231
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,242
Rym: It's in.

232
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:55,467
Rym: it's in the top list.

233
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:57,997
Scott: It's I like it a lot, and it's like rims.

234
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:09,103
Rym: super favorite Yeah, like pretty much this and irresponsible captain Tyler Just do it for me, but in particular utena is probably in my top three anime ever and Scott isn't at least your top ten I guess.

235
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:11,459
Scott: yeah, probably it's really good.

236
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:21,111
Rym: Yeah now surprisingly a lot of people don't know a lot about it or haven't seen it partly because it's 39 episodes long and partly because It doesn't look like the kind of show it actually is.

237
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:31,310
Scott: it's a very deceptive show I mean when you first look at imagery from the show you think of like a Really froofy kind of like.

238
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:39,100
Scott: you might think it's gonna be like or on high school Or you might think it's gonna be like rare, so you might think it's gonna be like Rosa Versailles.

239
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,943
Scott: Yeah, like that.

240
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,407
Scott: now part of it's not.

241
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:43,393
Rym: I mean it actually is stylistically.

242
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:49,192
Rym: it draws a lot from things like Rosa Versailles If you ever watch brother dear brother Which you shouldn't.

243
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:55,440
Rym: These style like the way the world works and the way people talk to each other kind of reminds me of it.

244
00:18:56,382 --> 00:19:01,908
Rym: It's not actually like any of those shows and I Guess I mean honestly even me.

245
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,100
Rym: I probably wouldn't have given the show a second look.

246
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,873
Rym: I mean I had seen like one episode of it the first episode.

247
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,700
Rym: I thought all right the show's kind of whatever.

248
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:10,890
Rym: I don't understand it.

249
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,000
Rym: It looks like some shoujo crap.

250
00:19:12,883 --> 00:19:17,800
Rym: But of all things Dwayne the stoner Caused me to watch the rest of the show.

251
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,293
Scott: To give you an idea of how the show is weird right.

252
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:28,857
Scott: let me read for you the genres Listed on the anime news network encyclopedia ready Drama okay show Joe all right.

253
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,439
Scott: Yeah Fantasy all right they got swords and stuff.

254
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,750
Scott: Psychological huh that doesn't fit does it.

255
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,452
Rym: I can only fit.

256
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:37,275
Rym: I mean what.

257
00:19:37,315 --> 00:19:38,720
Rym: I would put that on perfect blue.

258
00:19:39,443 --> 00:19:46,869
Scott: Yeah, maybe millennium actress, but perfect blue isn't fantasy or show Joe I.

259
00:19:48,241 --> 00:20:01,111
Rym: Maybe it's some sickos fantasy, but it's not fantasy like candidates fantasy, but yeah I mean you look at utenna without knowing anything about it, and you see pretty boys cute girls Princesses swords high school.

260
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:02,580
Rym: you think all right?

261
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,184
Rym: It's all pink and pastel.

262
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:08,056
Rym: in fact the show is real pink and real pastel, and you think man.

263
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,320
Scott: This is gonna be bad.

264
00:20:09,844 --> 00:20:12,100
Rym: So real bad for one.

265
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:23,115
Rym: They're all the people who are older and wiser than me in the ways of anime would talk about utenna in these reverent terms like oh ten of blah blah blah and they'd make references to it fairly often.

266
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:43,129
Rym: and Then one day I was visiting stoner Dwayne with a friend of mine Ken and among other things They were watching a bunch of utenna so we watched two episodes with them from what I now know is the middle of the black rose saga and it was amazing and Scary and weird and dark.

267
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:51,480
Scott: imagine watching card captor Sakura and having it be Actually scary and fucked up, but it looks like card captor Sakura.

268
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:56,333
Rym: I mean I realize now that this show is probably not what I think it is.

269
00:20:56,954 --> 00:21:02,631
Rym: and then I saw this anime music video To tenna though this much the one I've listed to the cars one.

270
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,380
Scott: Oh not the oh baby, baby.

271
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:10,664
Rym: Yeah that one set that's got cars, okay, it's mostly from the car saga I guess.

272
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:12,795
Rym: but yeah the hit me baby one more time.

273
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,318
Rym: anime music video Which is also one of my favorite AMVs ever?

274
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:26,520
Rym: But while that AMV is funny and hilarious it also shows scenes from the show that are really kind of you wonder What's actually going on in the show because it looks actually really serious and really well put together.

275
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:33,353
Rym: But I guess before we go any further Utenna was directed by kunihiko Ikuhara.

276
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:37,887
Rym: Oh he this is oh Yeah warning lights.

277
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:44,900
Rym: now the thing is he is one of the few anime directors I knew about by name before I listened to anime world order.

278
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:45,926
Rym: I actually and about.

279
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:51,083
Scott: I actually knew about this guy to remember this name Ikuhara Ikuhara.

280
00:21:51,224 --> 00:22:00,640
Scott: now hear the name Ikuhara in relation to anime which isn't gonna happen too often, but if you hear this name Watch out now you might think wait a minute.

281
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:06,748
Rym: I can't think of anything you kuhara's done and the answer is he didn't do much Because he's scary.

282
00:22:06,949 --> 00:22:09,500
Rym: the thing is scary does not preclude.

283
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:14,509
Rym: Awesome this guy for what it's worth for whatever weird issues.

284
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:27,440
Rym: He may have Created a great freaking show and there's no way the show would have been even though even though it might not all be Because of him it definitely would have would not have happened without him at worst.

285
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:33,376
Rym: He is like George Lucas in terms of he accidentally made something awesome exactly cuz he.

286
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:34,820
Scott: that's a great analogy there.

287
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,000
Rym: Basically he worked on Sailor Moon, and you know he did a good job on it.

288
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,334
Rym: He had a lot to do with it, but Sailor Moon is what it is.

289
00:22:41,354 --> 00:22:48,900
Rym: Yeah, it's no It's Anna and according to the story He was bored with Sailor Moon because he while he you know he had control of all various aspects of the show.

290
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,018
Rym: He didn't have really any artistic control, and they wouldn't let him do.

291
00:22:53,761 --> 00:23:08,342
Rym: quote interesting things unquote that he wanted to do with the series that that that warning lights, so Eventually he went to form this group called B. Papa's with among other people the the famous Chiyo Saito Mm-hmm.

292
00:23:08,643 --> 00:23:16,547
Rym: now Chiyo Saito tends to be very cute and show Joey and he kuhara tends to be very creepy and when you combine the You get Utena.

293
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:22,127
Scott: yeah if you read the original Utena manga Which is by Chiho Saito and no one else.

294
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,773
Scott: it's a cute show Joey thing.

295
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:27,240
Scott: there really isn't this scary stuff so much?

296
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:29,615
Rym: Yeah, no before we go any further.

297
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:30,400
Rym: I'm saying that a lot.

298
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,900
Rym: I mean, it's really hard to talk about this show, but without spoiling or just telling you the whole story.

299
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,623
Rym: I know warning out.

300
00:23:35,643 --> 00:23:37,270
Rym: We're not gonna spoil the show at all.

301
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,580
Rym: We're being very careful about he's not in this episode.

302
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:44,620
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna do a spoiler show way down the road or a spoiler week or whatever we need to do.

303
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:47,047
Rym: But we're not talking about the movie.

304
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:48,652
Rym: Don't even watch the movie.

305
00:23:48,672 --> 00:23:51,400
Rym: Don't even look at the DVD cover of the movie.

306
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,410
Scott: We're only talking about the TV show.

307
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,455
Scott: There's only two words.

308
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,520
Scott: You need to know about the movie.

309
00:23:55,721 --> 00:23:56,787
Scott: You know what those words are in.

310
00:23:56,908 --> 00:23:58,015
Rym: I know what those words are.

311
00:23:58,095 --> 00:23:58,860
Scott: you tell me the first word.

312
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,400
Scott: I'll tell you the second word naked cars.

313
00:24:01,601 --> 00:24:03,125
Rym: We're not fucking kidding.

314
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:11,372
Scott: if you watch the Utena movie the only reason you should watch that movie is to find out what we Mean when we say naked cars, and you know what.

315
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:14,586
Scott: if you end up doing that you're gonna Be sorry you tend.

316
00:24:14,606 --> 00:24:15,531
Scott: a movie is bad.

317
00:24:15,752 --> 00:24:16,818
Scott: We're not talking about it.

318
00:24:17,744 --> 00:24:22,691
Scott: Well, I guess we'll price will refer to it I'll say one tenement is bad only the TV show is good.

319
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:25,862
Rym: the Utena movie as bad as it is is however Beautiful.

320
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:30,800
Rym: it is a moving art book much like shamanic princess was a moving art book with almost nothing to it.

321
00:24:30,949 --> 00:24:41,939
Scott: Yeah and if you want to understand how creepy Ikuhara is the Utena movie is what happens when you let Ikuhara have pretty much complete control over all the artistic everything.

322
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,935
Rym: and Yeah, naked car naked car and razor blade incest.

323
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:48,240
Scott: that's exactly right.

324
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:58,093
Scott: That is why the Utena TV show is much better because it is Ikuhara But he is heavily restrained But not restrained so much that he does not have any influence at all.

325
00:24:58,434 --> 00:25:00,080
Scott: and hence the Utena TV show.

326
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:01,205
Scott: Which is the awesome?

327
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:04,300
Rym: now Utena is about a lot of things.

328
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:10,480
Rym: I mean if you ask someone who has seen all of Utena what it's about they can't tell you without spoiling everything.

329
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:18,157
Rym: I mean they can't give you a straight answer, and it's not like the matrix We're like once you know like oh, it's about that as opposed to that.

330
00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:25,100
Rym: Oh, okay It's actually Complicated to the point that there is no simple answer as to what Utena is about.

331
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:29,052
Rym: You really can't say in any small number of words what the show is about.

332
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:33,086
Rym: all we can really tell you is what the show Appears to be about.

333
00:25:33,628 --> 00:25:38,591
Rym: it is basically the story of a girl whose parents are dead And she's very sad.

334
00:25:38,611 --> 00:25:43,660
Scott: and she's a young girl And she's at some high school, and it's a high school with dorms and everyone lives there.

335
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:43,805
Scott: Well,

336
00:25:43,847 --> 00:26:04,094
Rym: then yeah but but way before that when she was a young girl her parents were killed and she said and she has no reason to Live and a prince appears a straight You know fairy book fairy tale Prince appears, and he kisses the tears out of her eyes and tells her blah Something childish about you know being a prince and growing up, and you know the world is good.

337
00:26:04,114 --> 00:26:09,630
Rym: It's okay that kind of thing and She decides that when she grows up.

338
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:11,296
Rym: She wants to be a prince.

339
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:12,500
Rym: She doesn't want to be a princess.

340
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,100
Rym: She doesn't want to be saved by anyone like she just was by this prince.

341
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:20,338
Rym: She wants to be a prince herself, and that's kind of a strange thing for a girl to want to be.

342
00:26:20,358 --> 00:26:22,385
Scott: yeah It's kind of freaky.

343
00:26:22,826 --> 00:26:24,472
Rym: Yeah, that's what the show is about.

344
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:26,659
Rym: they tell you this a bunch of times to let you get going.

345
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:30,211
Scott: We're at the beginning of like the first bunch of episodes.

346
00:26:30,512 --> 00:26:32,760
Scott: They show you this little like prologue.

347
00:26:33,282 --> 00:26:36,031
Scott: You know story of the fairy tale of.

348
00:26:36,473 --> 00:26:38,520
Scott: you know the girl who wants to grow up to be a prince and all that.

349
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:41,011
Rym: But that's all in the past where the show really picks up.

350
00:26:41,353 --> 00:26:43,000
Rym: is that utana the main character?

351
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:47,140
Rym: She is going to this high school this prestigious school.

352
00:26:47,381 --> 00:26:51,315
Rym: It's a high school and a middle school stuck together, and it's a boarding school.

353
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,649
Rym: It's Weird that's the first way to put it.

354
00:26:54,689 --> 00:27:04,860
Rym: It's a weird anime crazy architecture pretty people walking everywhere Weird angles and giant classrooms and fancy fancy fancy fancy.

355
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:09,420
Scott: No classes though think or on but less ornate, but still crazy.

356
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:22,140
Rym: Yeah And you know she's attending here and at one point she sees a woman a girl who goes to the school Arguing with a male student, and you know she comments like ah some sort of lovers quarrel, ha ha ha.

357
00:27:22,783 --> 00:27:28,951
Rym: And then she sees the guy just haul back and smack the girl And that crack a like the pimp hand.

358
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:30,560
Rym: no, I'm not talking just like a slab.

359
00:27:30,861 --> 00:27:34,319
Rym: This is the open palm equivalent of a punch to the face.

360
00:27:34,774 --> 00:27:38,165
Scott: Yeah Like she falls down And it's just laying am?

361
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:41,334
Rym: that pimp hand was double-sized and she's about to react.

362
00:27:41,735 --> 00:27:44,806
Rym: and then she sees that you know Oh this other guy stopped it.

363
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,875
Rym: this other guy intervened like okay.

364
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:51,791
Rym: It's cool Fast forward a little bit and now she's got her friend walk about.

365
00:27:51,811 --> 00:28:01,700
Rym: her really really good friend who goes to the school with her walk Has Feelings for one of the members of the student council sayonji who has the green haired guy.

366
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:02,789
Rym: That's all you need to know.

367
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:03,716
Rym: you'll recognize him.

368
00:28:03,978 --> 00:28:06,306
Scott: yet You can tell people apart in the show by hair.

369
00:28:06,406 --> 00:28:08,853
Scott: Utena has pink hair welcome eyes brown hair.

370
00:28:08,874 --> 00:28:12,526
Scott: sayonji has green hair toga I'm a man red hair.

371
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,615
Rym: He's the awesome jury has orange hair.

372
00:28:14,815 --> 00:28:15,799
Rym: Miki has blue hair.

373
00:28:16,544 --> 00:28:18,496
Scott: Everyone else sister has purple hair.

374
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:21,069
Scott: yep Not gonna tell you any of the care.

375
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:26,872
Rym: We can't tell you any other characters But anyway, so then her friend walk about his feelings for sayonji.

376
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:32,624
Rym: now sayonji is the guy who's just beating up his girlfriend So she writes him a love note and she's excited about it.

377
00:28:33,307 --> 00:28:39,087
Rym: one thing leads to another and sayonji just takes this love note and Instead of responding to it or throwing away or whatever.

378
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:47,135
Rym: He just pays it to the school bulletin board and this causes is Embarrassment concern and crying in walk about.

379
00:28:47,155 --> 00:28:48,120
Rym: this is a pretty horrible thing.

380
00:28:48,301 --> 00:28:56,427
Scott: You can see this whole beginning of the show here is all sort of a generic shoujo Romance high school kind of plot.

381
00:28:56,447 --> 00:28:57,953
Scott: There's nothing weird going on.

382
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,805
Scott: There's no crazy psychological or fantasy stuff.

383
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:09,751
Rym: and while there's this prince thing the way it's presented it feels more like a Tale or a story and not like something that actually happened to her.

384
00:29:10,112 --> 00:29:14,878
Rym: yep, so you know whatever if this was the show It's just some generic show about kids in school.

385
00:29:15,744 --> 00:29:19,524
Scott: Yeah, but at this point it's not even as good as What's it called.

386
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:20,789
Scott: boys over flowers?

387
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:21,953
Rym: What's a honey or a dango?

388
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:22,957
Scott: Yeah, it's not even that good.

389
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:28,160
Rym: yet now Here's where the show takes the first turn the turn where you realize that the show is not all it appears to be.

390
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,533
Rym: So she goes and confronts the sayonji guy straight up.

391
00:29:31,694 --> 00:29:33,080
Rym: He's the captain of the kendo club.

392
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:39,995
Rym: She takes a kendo sword and challenges him to a duel Because she's pissed at him and he doesn't seem to care about what he did to this poor girl.

393
00:29:40,437 --> 00:29:43,123
Rym: He says oh Can't fight me.

394
00:29:43,183 --> 00:29:47,177
Rym: I'm the captain of the kendo team, but then he notices the ring that she's wearing.

395
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:53,516
Rym: you see She wears this ring that has the pretty much the logo of the show that rose seal.

396
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:55,822
Rym: you'll see this everywhere Constantly.

397
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:58,675
Scott: they just shove it in your face like they'll just have a scene.

398
00:29:58,695 --> 00:30:07,027
Scott: It's not even animated It's a still frame and they pan across the still frame and they'll have this rose like spinning on the screen in random places And it's all.

399
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:08,233
Scott: you can't miss it.

400
00:30:08,454 --> 00:30:09,540
Rym: it is ever-present.

401
00:30:10,046 --> 00:30:12,625
Rym: hmm, and She had this ring.

402
00:30:12,665 --> 00:30:16,940
Rym: now supposedly she got it from this Prince way back when the other thing happened.

403
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:30,945
Rym: But sayonji he sees it and he shows that he has the same ring and he says oh You're one of the duelists meet me in the dueling arena in the forest behind the school at tonight And she's like what the fuck?

404
00:30:30,965 --> 00:30:31,346
Scott: All right.

405
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:32,791
Rym: I'm not allowed to go back there.

406
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:42,979
Rym: Okay, and she shows up and Alright, she climbs this stairwell after the ring opens the door and you start getting the twinges of maybe this is a fantasy.

407
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,398
Rym: and then an interesting song plays.

408
00:31:18,650 --> 00:32:36,162
Scott: Oh Oh Oh It's one of my favorite songs ever.

409
00:32:36,403 --> 00:32:39,640
Scott: yeah that song Really in the stock footage rolls.

410
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:40,123
Scott: Don't forget.

411
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:44,250
Scott: Yeah when she's walking up the stairs Oh that little animation of her walking up the stairs is awesome.

412
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:45,990
Rym: Yeah, that look at determination on her face.

413
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:51,730
Rym: But yeah, she's why she walks up this giant staircase that has no right to exist by the laws of physics.

414
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:55,244
Rym: Yep, she gets to the top and it's hard to describe.

415
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,469
Rym: you'll just have to find a picture of it.

416
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:07,950
Rym: There is basically a dueling arena in the sky on this giant pillar and there's a giant castle Hanging from the ceiling hanging not from the ceiling from the sky.

417
00:33:08,171 --> 00:33:10,480
Rym: it is just floating in the sky upside down.

418
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:19,363
Scott: the top of the castle is pointing down Onto your head like if the castle fell you would die because it's above.

419
00:33:19,463 --> 00:33:21,430
Scott: it's fucked up really fucked up.

420
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,449
Scott: It shouldn't be but it's there.

421
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:28,510
Rym: So you watch the show to that point and now you realize the show is probably not about what I thought it was about.

422
00:33:29,112 --> 00:33:31,965
Rym: To not go into what happens that I mean.

423
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:38,150
Scott: at the front one part You're like oh that poor girl got slapped and oh our friends feelings are hurt.

424
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,635
Scott: I'll defend my friends feelings.

425
00:33:40,077 --> 00:33:40,900
Scott: and then you go.

426
00:33:41,402 --> 00:33:42,145
Scott: what the fuck is there?

427
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:45,809
Scott: a castle hanging from the sky two different shows.

428
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:49,030
Rym: So this isn't really a spoiler because you learn all this right away.

429
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,256
Scott: This is all in episode one.

430
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:54,595
Rym: the actual plot of utenna which you learn at this point Is that in the school?

431
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:57,586
Rym: There are people who wear these rose seals.

432
00:33:57,606 --> 00:33:58,650
Rym: They are drawn to the school.

433
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,974
Rym: They all end up at this school.

434
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:03,185
Rym: wearing the rose seal ring means that you're a duelist.

435
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:08,969
Rym: at the school There is the Rose bride and currently it is anti-hymemia.

436
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:13,601
Rym: Whoever has currently won the duel wins.

437
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:16,270
Rym: the Rose bride has control over her.

438
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:20,955
Rym: That might sound weird, but that's exactly what's going on And that's all they tell you.

439
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,627
Scott: if you like you want to know the details like what does control mean?

440
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:24,190
Scott: blah blah blah.

441
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:27,065
Scott: It's all answered in the show kind of not really.

442
00:34:27,507 --> 00:34:32,324
Rym: yeah, well We really can't go into more but suffice to say this is kind of a weird thing.

443
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:32,824
Rym: you know.

444
00:34:32,926 --> 00:34:35,955
Rym: magical dueling arena Castle floating in the sky.

445
00:34:36,295 --> 00:34:41,530
Rym: you're fighting duels with members of the student council of this school in order to win control.

446
00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:49,167
Rym: Some girl who goes to the school who seems to have absolutely no will of her own other than to be the Rose bride to Whoever has won her

447
00:34:49,996 --> 00:34:50,217
Scott: mm-hmm

448
00:34:51,308 --> 00:35:19,901
Rym: and That is what the show is about and the members of the student council and utenna and other people from outside End up dueling with each other with varying stakes ranging from you know fighting with wooden swords to Fighting to the death with actual swords with the purpose of gaining control of this woman in order to unlock the castle of the sky to gain eternity and To essentially smash the world's shell for the sake of the revolution of the world.

449
00:35:20,262 --> 00:35:20,803
Scott: Yeah, it's.

450
00:35:21,124 --> 00:35:23,450
Scott: it's crazy fucked up abstract shit.

451
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,395
Scott: They never make clear.

452
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:26,083
Scott: What's really going on until the end?

453
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:27,450
Rym: see there are a lot of ways.

454
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:29,480
Rym: I said you know we're talking about what utenna is about.

455
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,430
Rym: we've already told you two things that it's about.

456
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:38,221
Rym: Really utenna is a straight-up Anime, you know just a straight-up face value.

457
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:39,024
Rym: It's an anime.

458
00:35:39,065 --> 00:35:40,190
Rym: weird stuff like that happens.

459
00:35:41,054 --> 00:35:44,330
Rym: It is also a fully self-consistent very well done science fiction.

460
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,083
Rym: It is also a fully self consistent very well done fantasy.

461
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:54,230
Rym: It is also an Adolescence metaphor straight up mm-hmm.

462
00:35:54,511 --> 00:36:03,254
Rym: It is also a number of a number of other metaphors straight up, and it is combinations of all of those Inside of itself.

463
00:36:03,555 --> 00:36:09,813
Scott: It's also a pretentious art flick with lots of fucked-up symbolism that you're not supposed to understand because you're not as smart As Ikuhara.

464
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:15,576
Rym: yeah, except the thing is I mean there are a lot of shows that put you know symbolism and sometimes It's obvious sometimes.

465
00:36:15,657 --> 00:36:16,904
Rym: It's arbitrary sometimes.

466
00:36:16,985 --> 00:36:17,649
Rym: It's just BS.

467
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:19,817
Scott: Utenna is not subtle.

468
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:20,701
Rym: Well.

469
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,390
Rym: It is subtle in some ways sometime.

470
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:26,109
Rym: It is subtle in that you will see a symbol you will know what it symbolizes.

471
00:36:26,612 --> 00:36:38,660
Rym: You will think you've got it down and then 20 episodes later They'll show you something and you'll think back to that symbol you saw 20 episodes ago And you'll suddenly realize that you were an idiot And you didn't understand anything.

472
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,425
Rym: and now you get it.

473
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:45,830
Rym: yeah This is a show where symbolism is bleeding out of every single instant.

474
00:36:46,311 --> 00:37:00,540
Rym: Everything that happens in the show every point of direction every I guess camera angle every expression on a character's face everything that's going on in the background is directly relevant Self-consistent and they're on purpose.

475
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:03,930
Scott: and sometimes it's there on purpose just to mess with you.

476
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,385
Rym: There's one point in the middle where it's like the show they'll just keep you showing stuff.

477
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:09,590
Scott: They'll show you stuff.

478
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,232
Scott: That's weird.

479
00:37:10,513 --> 00:37:18,114
Scott: like this character keeps playing with a stopwatch and ever and you'll just hit the button at random times seemingly random times And they'll show it.

480
00:37:18,134 --> 00:37:24,899
Scott: they'll zoom in on the stopwatch as he starts it and stops it and pushes the lap button And it's like why the fuck did they keep showing the stopwatch?

481
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,710
Rym: yep, or the best example of that is really the student council.

482
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:42,957
Rym: You see the school is run by the student council which includes all of these duelists and they're conducting the duels and they are running the school based on the orders of quote the ends of the world.

483
00:37:42,977 --> 00:37:47,292
Rym: they get letters from the end of the world about what to do and They follow.

484
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:48,597
Rym: they follow these letters straight up.

485
00:37:48,637 --> 00:37:48,919
Rym: It says.

486
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:51,570
Rym: Oh have a duel someone should fight so-and-so blah blah blah.

487
00:37:51,691 --> 00:37:52,422
Scott: It's fucked up shit.

488
00:37:52,807 --> 00:38:04,388
Rym: now They also have the student council meetings and the student council meetings are where you see a lot of the ranging from extremely subtle to Extremely hit you over the head with it.

489
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:17,890
Rym: metaphorical scenes like they'll be talking and there'll be an apple and then the apples cut up and Or they'll be talking and playing darts But someone's standing in front of the dartboard or a train goes by and it muffles some of the words.

490
00:38:18,273 --> 00:38:18,837
Rym: You heard me.

491
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,580
Scott: a train goes by Or there's an apple and then suddenly the apple is full of forks.

492
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:26,389
Rym: yeah, Oh God don't remind me of that.

493
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:30,822
Rym: yeah Yeah, no the thing is this stuff all sounds weird like totally weird.

494
00:38:30,962 --> 00:38:34,027
Rym: whatever why the show is just like Excel saga only trying to be serious.

495
00:38:35,392 --> 00:38:37,562
Rym: Just keep playing keep playing.

496
00:38:37,723 --> 00:38:39,090
Rym: this stuff is all.

497
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:44,870
Rym: It's really hard for me to get across just how deep this show actually is in a non pretentious way.

498
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:54,110
Scott: Yeah Now the thing about the show that really that I notice is that Unlike other shows which just have a plot and then follow the plot along until its conclusion.

499
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:58,127
Scott: You know they have the build-up then they have the the exposition and everything like that.

500
00:38:58,952 --> 00:39:01,193
Scott: utenna has this Structure.

501
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:08,996
Scott: it's like a very defined structure like each episode follows this defined structure, and then each season Follows the whole structure.

502
00:39:09,076 --> 00:39:11,785
Scott: It's sort of like the same thing three times.

503
00:39:11,865 --> 00:39:12,186
Scott: really.

504
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:13,450
Scott: yeah, there are three seasons.

505
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:16,130
Rym: The show is like this recursion in and of itself.

506
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:19,009
Rym: I mean there's the main thread of the plot which goes through the whole show.

507
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:35,557
Rym: But there's one character who has this whole set of subplots that like they'll be like normal episode normal episode normal episode Nanami episode which are usually silly and funny and crazy and over-the-top with Thousand X potent curry sauce.

508
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:37,502
Scott: I love the thousand X potent curry sauce.

509
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,110
Scott: those actually harken back a lot to the manga.

510
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:51,702
Rym: But if you take all of those episodes out of the show and string them together and watch them as a show in and of Themselves they tell the story of the entire show just in a different way.

511
00:39:52,584 --> 00:40:02,410
Rym: if you take like the second story arc the Black Rose saga Apart and watch it on its own it kind of tells the same story of the show just in a different direction.

512
00:40:02,811 --> 00:40:07,485
Scott: Yeah, now the way each episode is structured is you know you'll come in they'll show you that.

513
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:13,890
Scott: maybe if it's an early episode They'll show you that fairy tale thing all right and the plot will kind of pick up where it left off.

514
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:17,050
Scott: And you know you'll see some characters doing some stuff.

515
00:40:17,692 --> 00:40:25,519
Scott: And then you know there's a bunch of different characters in the student council and usually you only Concentrate heavily on one of them in any one time.

516
00:40:26,061 --> 00:40:35,227
Scott: and it sort of starts each season with the lesser Important ones and it get it builds up to the bigger ones the more important people on the student council.

517
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:37,093
Scott: towards the ends of the season You know.

518
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:57,163
Scott: so you'll start out with an episode and you know it'll be dealing with the plot of always Zutena because she's the main character and one person on the student council and It sort of shows you everything and people are getting along people aren't getting along and then eventually You know everything sort of builds up to the maximum and then the shadow girls show up.

519
00:40:57,644 --> 00:41:01,670
Rym: now the shadow girls are another one of those very interesting things about this shot.

520
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:06,890
Rym: They're the student council meetings, and there are the shadow girls, and they serve a number of purposes.

521
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,790
Rym: They're almost like the Greek chorus.

522
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:17,670
Rym: they're kind of like the vibe of the students or What people are saying about what's going on even though?

523
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:22,010
Scott: They just talk about monkeys and UFOs and submarines and pirates and God knows what?

524
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,150
Rym: Yeah, it's just they're there.

525
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,817
Rym: They add another layer to this show.

526
00:41:26,977 --> 00:41:34,348
Rym: and all I really have to say is if you're watching utenna pay Attention to what those shadow girls are saying and you'll understand the show a lot better.

527
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:35,976
Scott: Yeah, or less.

528
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:37,806
Scott: Yeah, if you think about it too hard.

529
00:41:37,866 --> 00:41:38,650
Scott: You might hurt yourself.

530
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:48,349
Scott: So after the shadow girls come you always 99% of the time hear that music again, and it's time for the duel.

531
00:41:48,369 --> 00:42:04,880
Scott: and Pretty much, you know sometimes it only takes one episode for them to build up to a duel sometimes takes two episodes But there's pretty much most of the time a duel at the end of every episode and then at the beginning of the next episode It's another student council character, and we continue with their plot.

532
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:08,350
Rym: Yep now the we you know they've got these different story.

533
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:15,241
Rym: I mean the show is basically broken up into four story arcs or four seasons And they have really three, but there's a little.

534
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:17,230
Scott: the end is like a tiny little season in its own.

535
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,956
Rym: Yeah I mean basically there's the student council saga or at the beginning and It's kind of like.

536
00:42:21,976 --> 00:42:24,008
Rym: this is the first bit of the show the first 13 episodes.

537
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:25,373
Scott: Less weird.

538
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:34,430
Rym: yes, if you watch the first 13 episodes up until the last five minutes of the last episode episode 13 You'll think all right this show didn't get so weird.

539
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,238
Rym: I don't know what Rym you can actually trick it.

540
00:42:36,298 --> 00:42:38,991
Scott: you could actually tell someone that that's the whole show and they would totally believe It.

541
00:42:39,272 --> 00:42:42,489
Rym: yeah except for that tiny cliff at the very end.

542
00:42:42,837 --> 00:42:49,110
Scott: Yep The last five minutes of the 13th episode are what prevent it from just being the end of the show entirely because it could have been.

543
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:50,418
Rym: So that's before we continue.

544
00:42:50,740 --> 00:43:01,098
Rym: if you're going to give utenna a chance And you're seriously going to trust us on this you have to watch beyond the first 13. the first 13 are good But they are not the meat of utenna.

545
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,310
Rym: They are not what we rave and go nuts over.

546
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:05,849
Rym: They are not what made us love the show.

547
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:09,582
Rym: They are just good enough to set you up for what is about to come.

548
00:43:09,843 --> 00:43:11,609
Scott: I actually like the first 13 the most.

549
00:43:11,629 --> 00:43:15,239
Rym: I Like them because they're still very deep and there's a lot of.

550
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:20,901
Rym: I mean the symbolism in this show is just so amazing and that Might sound pretentious, but you can die in a fire.

551
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:22,710
Rym: It's actually really amazing.

552
00:43:23,231 --> 00:43:24,558
Scott: It's not that amazing.

553
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:26,590
Scott: a lot of it is just kind of silly and random.

554
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:31,935
Rym: Yeah But until you know when you've seen the whole show and you go back and you see you can Wear it was coming from.

555
00:43:31,975 --> 00:43:36,310
Scott: that's the problem with the show is that when you watch it through for the first time a lot of?

556
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,009
Scott: The stuff is silly and random and there's no going around it.

557
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:49,421
Scott: But if you watch it a second time once you know everything then a lot not all of but a lot of the silly random Crap actually meet make sense.

558
00:43:49,522 --> 00:43:51,150
Rym: It's like what the fuck how did the hell?

559
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:57,769
Rym: They do that and not just make sense like there'll be a throwaway gag about something right and you watch it the first time through The show you're like haha, whatever.

560
00:43:58,672 --> 00:44:00,745
Rym: Then you watch the show again, and you know what's been going.

561
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:07,008
Rym: like you know the plot You know what I've seen the end You know everything and you'll see that throwaway joke and it's not funny.

562
00:44:07,068 --> 00:44:09,982
Rym: in fact It's kind of disturbing or and terrible.

563
00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:14,668
Rym: yeah like you watch you like wow What kind of show is this yeah?

564
00:44:15,671 --> 00:44:18,118
Scott: Imagine if you watch Star Wars and it was Star Wars.

565
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:28,085
Scott: then imagine if watching Star Wars a second time it was Completely different and all the jokes were actually like suddenly turned into dark humor instead of slapstick.

566
00:44:28,105 --> 00:44:34,450
Rym: like you know when there's the Jawa traders Right mm-hmm, and you know we met they go with the Jawa traders, and they're kind of antagonistic and whatever.

567
00:44:35,212 --> 00:44:40,489
Rym: What if at the end of Star Wars Luke joined the Empire and genocided all the Jawas?

568
00:44:42,132 --> 00:44:44,970
Rym: And he'd been planning to do that from the start and he always hated them.

569
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:57,030
Rym: And then you go back and you watch the show and from the beginning again the movies you're like oh Yeah, cuz you know he doesn't like the Jawas you're like hey, he doesn't like him cuz he wants to go kill him all.

570
00:44:57,974 --> 00:44:59,850
Scott: Yep, it totally changes the way you look at it alright.

571
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:02,076
Scott: So that's the structure of like an episode.

572
00:45:02,517 --> 00:45:10,703
Scott: the structure of a season right is that they start with the small end of the student And they work their way up and then something crazy happens.

573
00:45:11,024 --> 00:45:16,789
Rym: yep and crazy is Generally ever-increasing as the season and episode numbers increase.

574
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:22,650
Scott: yeah It's like any season starts off kind of easy to understand and a lot of mundane things are happening.

575
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:27,809
Scott: And then as you get closer to the 13th episode because it's what 39 episodes right.

576
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:34,170
Scott: yep Yeah, the 13th episode with this three seasons 13 each you it gets really freaking weird and crazy.

577
00:45:34,772 --> 00:45:37,704
Rym: Yep, so again watch the first 13 episodes.

578
00:45:37,945 --> 00:45:38,467
Rym: They're good.

579
00:45:38,728 --> 00:45:40,214
Rym: They're deep they're interesting.

580
00:45:40,816 --> 00:45:48,570
Rym: the 13th episode will kind of let you in on what's actually going on and Then starting with episode 14 the black rose saga.

581
00:45:49,272 --> 00:45:51,960
Rym: That is when the show becomes what it actually is.

582
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,604
Rym: the show becomes dark.

583
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:55,530
Scott: Yeah, the thing is the black rose saga.

584
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:56,622
Scott: It's like you should watch it.

585
00:45:56,764 --> 00:45:59,529
Scott: It's important You know and that's part of why the show is great.

586
00:46:00,112 --> 00:46:08,984
Scott: But you could actually not watch it and just go straight to episode 25 25 25 and you wouldn't know the difference you wouldn't miss anything.

587
00:46:09,025 --> 00:46:17,910
Rym: the black rose saga is like this recursive Cyclical part of the story that doesn't really need to be there and kind of just tells the story again from a different.

588
00:46:18,051 --> 00:46:24,687
Scott: It's like the second 13 episodes are the same as the first 13 And they're the same as the last 13 only they're not.

589
00:46:25,412 --> 00:46:26,617
Rym: The only real difference is that.

590
00:46:26,998 --> 00:46:36,710
Rym: well, I guess other than the things we can't talk about Yeah, is that the first 13 the the issues that you're dealing with are mostly things that I mean.

591
00:46:37,052 --> 00:46:53,328
Rym: They end up being sad or serious or scary but at the same time they're also very not the biggest deal like ah there was a love triangle and someone ended up losing out or someone was heartbroken or someone has problems with their family or their sister.

592
00:46:53,348 --> 00:46:56,057
Rym: and While they're serious issues, they're not.

593
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:00,050
Rym: you know end of the world kill yourself horribly depressing things.

594
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,570
Rym: The black rose saga it's the same.

595
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:12,749
Rym: You know the same structure of the show except the problems the characters are dealing with and the reasons they have for dueling are So much more sinister and horrible.

596
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:25,610
Scott: And then in the third season which we're not going to talk much about except for the fact that it is called the cars Season by us anyway, yes, it's called the Akio saga or the the end saga by most normal people.

597
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,577
Scott: We call it cars because there are many.

598
00:47:27,597 --> 00:47:35,087
Scott: you'll know why when you watch it and there are many cars in it Specifically one car which looks like a red Miata, but it's not really a Miata.

599
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:35,890
Scott: It just looks like one.

600
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:40,190
Rym: Yeah, and then there's like the last five or six episodes are kind of the end of the world song.

601
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:45,490
Scott: Yeah, like when you get towards the end of the the cars series, you know towards the end.

602
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:51,229
Scott: The last few episodes are just way out weird and they don't really kind of go with the cars even though they do.

603
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:51,530
Rym: yeah.

604
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:52,152
Rym: But you'll know.

605
00:47:52,353 --> 00:47:57,290
Rym: I mean, you know exactly when that happens because each of these story are really like the last two gets weird.

606
00:47:57,693 --> 00:47:58,922
Rym: Well, yeah, but there's a break.

607
00:47:59,063 --> 00:48:09,575
Rym: once cars ends There's a definitive point where there's a duel and after that duel that is when the show takes a turn like the show ends and Then it doesn't end.

608
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:12,129
Rym: it's really hard to explain but the show will end.

609
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:14,140
Rym: you like All right, all the duels are done.

610
00:48:14,482 --> 00:48:15,870
Rym: whatever is going to happen has happened.

611
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,137
Rym: all we have now is the epilogue.

612
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:19,642
Rym: what happened because of this?

613
00:48:20,485 --> 00:48:23,616
Rym: and the epilogue is Actually the end of the show.

614
00:48:23,656 --> 00:48:26,406
Rym: the epilogue is the part where everything is revealed.

615
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:27,389
Rym: you figure it all out.

616
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:28,513
Rym: I was.

617
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:39,673
Rym: I can say in all seriousness that when we watch this for the first time and there was a bunch of us It was like us and Lara and I forget who I figured it out like a few minutes before they revealed it Like I didn't.

618
00:48:39,995 --> 00:48:44,680
Scott: I wasn't a hundred percent sure so I didn't open my mouth Which is why a lot of people don't believe me.

619
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,970
Rym: I believe you because I was almost there.

620
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,422
Scott: I was like I was like could it be could it be?

621
00:48:50,683 --> 00:48:51,184
Scott: but I was like.

622
00:48:51,285 --> 00:48:56,500
Scott: I didn't know how it could be You know, but I was like it could be that it could be.

623
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,245
Scott: that is it that?

624
00:48:58,846 --> 00:49:04,205
Scott: and then all of a sudden They come out and they're like, not only is it that but this is how it was done.

625
00:49:04,465 --> 00:49:05,509
Scott: Booyah, and I'm like

626
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:12,527
Rym: no But there is a point in near the end where something happened something pretty bad happens to a real

627
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:13,049
Scott: bad

628
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:32,223
Rym: and There's this metaphor with candles going on just so anyone who's seen the show is will know or when you off the show we're Anthony him EMEA the Rose bride is holding this candelabra with candles and one by one the candles go out and Then the third candle goes out and we know at this point what this is symbolizing.

629
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:38,006
Rym: and then it happens and we're all taken back like everyone in the room kind of gasped like we didn't think it would really happen.

630
00:49:38,066 --> 00:49:38,648
Rym: and it happened like.

631
00:49:38,669 --> 00:49:50,842
Rym: and Then we're watching and we see something in the background and we backed it up to make sure we saw it and Two people in the room scream like actually screamed when they noticed it.

632
00:49:51,584 --> 00:49:53,250
Scott: It's pretty fucked up shit right there.

633
00:49:53,571 --> 00:49:55,076
Rym: Yeah, this show is not for kids.

634
00:49:55,116 --> 00:49:58,026
Rym: The show is not for people who don't like being depressed.

635
00:49:58,408 --> 00:50:00,177
Scott: Yeah It's not.

636
00:50:00,438 --> 00:50:04,336
Scott: if you don't like being scared or freaked out You shouldn't watch this either.

637
00:50:04,557 --> 00:50:07,147
Scott: Yes, you're so dumb that you won't understand what's going on.

638
00:50:07,227 --> 00:50:09,812
Scott: then you'll just be like It does.

639
00:50:10,254 --> 00:50:12,620
Scott: you can't just watch this show casually.

640
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,244
Scott: I think is one of the problems with it.

641
00:50:14,485 --> 00:50:16,290
Scott: You have to pay fucking attention.

642
00:50:16,431 --> 00:50:26,010
Rym: That's why I mean, I'm really glad that the first time I saw the show We pretty much watched the last ten episodes in a row non-stop Partly because we couldn't bring ourselves to stop.

643
00:50:27,312 --> 00:50:29,530
Rym: It's not like that, but there are some scenes.

644
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,942
Rym: There's some powerful scenes and there's been a lot of.

645
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:42,779
Rym: I mean people talk a lot about Chiyo Saito and how she writes things and how sometimes what she would do is come up with a scene like an idea for a scene and then write whatever she's writing around that scene.

646
00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:51,536
Rym: and I'm not sure where I heard this but someone told me that her idea for utenna would resolve revolved around one scene that she had come up with.

647
00:50:52,769 --> 00:50:57,530
Rym: and When that scene happens in the show, it's a very powerful moment, but it is not the only powerful moment.

648
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:00,989
Rym: They're the scenes in this show like the stage scenes.

649
00:51:01,351 --> 00:51:05,406
Rym: There are probably 10 or 12 of them that are just absolutely amazing and how well they're executed.

650
00:51:05,426 --> 00:51:07,012
Scott: Mm-hmm All right.

651
00:51:07,112 --> 00:51:09,119
Scott: Now let's talk about three other things.

652
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:10,284
Scott: We gotta talk with the animation.

653
00:51:10,444 --> 00:51:13,356
Scott: Yep, the music and the voice acting All right animation.

654
00:51:13,376 --> 00:51:14,040
Rym: very briefly.

655
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:18,336
Rym: The animation is not bad However, it's so bad.

656
00:51:18,577 --> 00:51:29,788
Rym: The opener is really well animated openers and the closers are pretty cool and they obviously Save up their budget in order to animate the last few episodes better than the rest of the show.

657
00:51:29,808 --> 00:51:32,094
Scott: and while the Animation is bad.

658
00:51:32,114 --> 00:51:34,540
Scott: The character design is great.

659
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:44,990
Rym: The character design looks kind of weird, you know tall angular Bishonin bishoujo people crazy costumes that I don't even really like them that much but some reason they're okay.

660
00:51:45,512 --> 00:51:49,110
Rym: But the character designs are so iconic and so strong.

661
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:54,410
Rym: It's like, you know in an opera there's the light motifs like the little song that plays when a character, you know appears.

662
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:58,730
Rym: These character designs act like their own light motifs Like.

663
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:03,924
Scott: they're so iconic of the characters and mostly the hair color of everyone is so different.

664
00:52:04,165 --> 00:52:11,930
Scott: you identify people by their hair color And the color of their hair kind of matches the character really well, and it's all yeah, perfect.

665
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:15,022
Rym: Also every character, you know, they're associated with this color.

666
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:17,050
Rym: and you know, we talked about those spinning roses.

667
00:52:17,772 --> 00:52:26,003
Rym: Every now and then you'll be watching and suddenly there'll be a frame around the action with four roses spinning of One of the hair colors of a character.

668
00:52:26,306 --> 00:52:30,021
Rym: Oh, yes But sometimes it's white and not a color of a character.

669
00:52:30,563 --> 00:52:33,543
Rym: and this sound just bear with me but that means something.

670
00:52:33,563 --> 00:52:43,384
Rym: and After you've seen the show once and you watch it again and you you kind of figure out what that is trying to tell you The viewer it again puts the show in an entirely different perspective.

671
00:52:43,424 --> 00:52:46,313
Rym: and when I say entirely different perspective This show.

672
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:51,728
Rym: a lot of times you'll be going along and suddenly if you realize something your perspective on the show is 180 degrees.

673
00:52:52,771 --> 00:52:52,994
Scott: Yep.

674
00:52:53,742 --> 00:52:57,779
Rym: Now, yeah It's like in the matrix when he wakes up and he's a battery.

675
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,370
Rym: in terms of it's like that level of wait a minute.

676
00:53:01,914 --> 00:53:03,749
Rym: Yeah, oh man, I get it.

677
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:13,170
Scott: Yeah, but for the most part the animation is lots of panning over still frames Lots of you see a character's face and only their mouth moves.

678
00:53:13,892 --> 00:53:18,530
Rym: Some of the duels are really really well animated but many of the duels are barely animated.

679
00:53:18,631 --> 00:53:21,649
Scott: It's like a picture of a guy with a sword a picture of a girl with a sword.

680
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:25,439
Scott: You know a picture of the swords hitting while the screen shakes.

681
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:29,490
Rym: sometimes they'll cover the action with a giant spinning rose.

682
00:53:30,011 --> 00:53:31,375
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

683
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:34,443
Rym: Yeah, of course that again it could mean something.

684
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:36,969
Scott: It could be just saving money on animation.

685
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:40,770
Rym: now Here's my hypothesis and I found a few people who agree with me.

686
00:53:41,213 --> 00:54:01,810
Rym: I think that part of what made Utena as good as it was Was that they were so constrained in their animation budget and they were so constrained in their time frame that they ended up having to come up with really really creative ways to get a lot of information across and a lot of Symbolism across in a very short span of time with very little animation and very little budget.

687
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:05,702
Scott: There is definitely something to be said for the fact that it's you're all.

688
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:13,950
Scott: it's always easier to be more creative and more Interesting when you have some sort of limitations, you know when you have no limits, it's really hard to do anything.

689
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:17,490
Scott: But that's awesome because you can do anything, you know.

690
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:21,550
Scott: So it's it's difficult when someone puts some limits on you, even if they're artificial limits.

691
00:54:21,972 --> 00:54:32,768
Rym: that's what you can get creative because you're doing more with less and Utena does that pretty well and also because the animation is kind of you know Slow and choppy and still frames through a lot of the show.

692
00:54:33,572 --> 00:54:37,529
Rym: Whenever important things happen it ends up being animated really well.

693
00:54:38,831 --> 00:54:43,328
Rym: They can as well as they could have and in the last few episode is a lot of repeat footage to like.

694
00:54:43,348 --> 00:54:48,870
Scott: when she walks up The stairs to the dueling arena, you'll see that same footage like in most of the episodes.

695
00:54:49,131 --> 00:54:52,383
Rym: Yep, kind of like the transformation sequence in a magical girl show.

696
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:53,025
Scott: Yeah, it's.

697
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:54,310
Scott: it's pretty much only longer.

698
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:58,376
Rym: However, that song and also, you know The song means a lot and it really does.

699
00:54:58,396 --> 00:55:04,781
Rym: I'm glad they left that stock footage in because it really like the stock foot Really sets you up for the duels.

700
00:55:05,022 --> 00:55:12,489
Rym: Yeah, like it gets you in this Kind of strange move once you know how the show goes and you just take the show at face value just running with it.

701
00:55:12,549 --> 00:55:16,480
Rym: now That music and that opening sequence really set you up.

702
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:23,170
Rym: if you're in a big way and the duels feel so much more powerful because of That well all the music in this show is really powerful and sets you up for crazy stuff.

703
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,816
Rym: Yeah, now we really have to talk about that.

704
00:55:24,856 --> 00:55:28,790
Rym: The music in utenna is also one of the things that made it amazing.

705
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:30,315
Rym: We talked a while ago about.

706
00:55:30,335 --> 00:55:34,730
Rym: you know music and anime and how like a show like initial D is nothing without its music.

707
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,056
Scott: No initial D without music is nothing.

708
00:55:37,437 --> 00:55:39,642
Scott: utenna is less than nothing without music.

709
00:55:39,943 --> 00:55:46,087
Rym: or and also like a show like dot hack sign Which was a crap show, but it had amazing music that pulled it.

710
00:55:46,127 --> 00:55:46,690
Rym: just the music.

711
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:51,769
Scott: Yeah, the music of hack sign was able to pull me to episode 13 where nothing happened until then.

712
00:55:52,372 --> 00:55:56,090
Scott: But without the music utenna is nothing but with the music it is everything.

713
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:08,620
Rym: I don't know how I would describe the music in utenna other than that half of it is instrumental symphonic music with maybe a little bit of jazzy stuff in there and the other half of it is rock Opera chorus music.

714
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:10,350
Scott: it's kind of crazy.

715
00:56:10,692 --> 00:56:11,053
Scott: We're gonna.

716
00:56:11,074 --> 00:56:14,810
Scott: we'll play some of it for you in the episode, but it's awesome All right.

717
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,356
Rym: Now the story there is.

718
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,190
Rym: for one reason or another Ikuhara wrote most of the lyrics to the dual song.

719
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:20,953
Scott: Okay.

720
00:56:20,973 --> 00:56:22,458
Scott: Yeah, every time there's a duel.

721
00:56:22,638 --> 00:56:29,198
Scott: There's a song that plays during the duel, you know and Each duel has its own song.

722
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,290
Scott: now these a lot of episodes and there's a lot of duels.

723
00:56:32,854 --> 00:56:38,263
Rym: So there's a lot of songs and they're all Very very distinctive like each one.

724
00:56:38,303 --> 00:56:44,770
Rym: like if you've seen the show You'll hear one of the dual songs for the most part and you'll remember which duel it was from to a certain degree.

725
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:45,974
Rym: Maybe I don't really remember.

726
00:56:45,995 --> 00:56:48,745
Rym: I mean you'll forget a lot of the black rose ones, but I remember.

727
00:56:48,966 --> 00:56:52,782
Rym: I've seen the show three times But there are three or four of the duels that I hear the song.

728
00:56:52,862 --> 00:57:06,730
Scott: It's like ah, oh, man Yeah, but it's not like an initial D. if they play a certain eurobeat song during a race You remember which race had which eurobeat song playing, you know, now the lyrics to the songs are very strange.

729
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:09,259
Scott: They're fucked up and most of the time.

730
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:18,228
Scott: Whoa, like my favorite one is a Jurassic Cretaceous Night, yeah, it talks about all the different ages of dinosaurs.

731
00:57:19,733 --> 00:57:30,523
Rym: It's kind of crazy again If one if you're watching the show for the first time as much as I want to say you should don't even try To read the lyrics to these songs while you're watching the duel.

732
00:57:30,543 --> 00:57:32,130
Rym: just pay attention to what the characters are saying.

733
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:37,770
Rym: There is no way you will be able to follow those lyrics and the duel and figure it all out.

734
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:42,748
Scott: Yeah, and it's not like I don't even know what the hell spirit of Milla Billy's era Mira Billy suit.

735
00:57:42,768 --> 00:57:47,790
Scott: Yeah That still really doesn't have that much meaning and it's not really necessary.

736
00:57:48,551 --> 00:58:03,250
Rym: Yeah, well it's not necessary though after you've seen the show a bunch of times if you just like you already know what the characters saying if you watch what the lyrics are and what they're translated as They're about as relevant as something like that could be and some of them seem like they're not that well inspired.

737
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:04,996
Rym: But some of the duels the songs are.

738
00:58:05,177 --> 00:58:09,110
Scott: yeah, some of the duels the songs make more sense than Jurassic Cretaceous.

739
00:58:09,273 --> 00:58:10,089
Scott: What are the other eras?

740
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:12,490
Rym: Because the thing is even that song.

741
00:58:12,972 --> 00:58:20,335
Rym: You could you could I could at least make an argument as to what that song was trying a pretty weak one But yeah You could you give me that week?

742
00:58:20,355 --> 00:58:28,117
Rym: because eco horror like pointedly wrote the lyrics on by himself for each duel And the music itself.

743
00:58:28,157 --> 00:58:33,253
Rym: He got it scored by a man named J a Caesar Caesar.

744
00:58:33,434 --> 00:58:34,377
Rym: I've seen his name before.

745
00:58:34,397 --> 00:58:36,546
Rym: I think he actually has another name in Japanese.

746
00:58:36,586 --> 00:58:37,209
Rym: I don't remember it.

747
00:58:37,711 --> 00:58:46,176
Rym: Mm-hmm and all the other music was composed by some other guy and that other guy also did some of the work for the duel choruses, but I Don't think we need to talk about anymore.

748
00:58:46,196 --> 00:58:49,030
Rym: I'm just going to play two or three of the dual songs for whole things.

749
00:58:49,572 --> 00:58:50,436
Rym: Yeah, they're real short.

750
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:53,187
Rym: All right, just so you get an idea of what kind of music this is.

751
00:58:53,207 --> 01:01:31,970
Scott: All right Oh Oh Oh Oh.

752
01:02:30,203 --> 01:02:32,678
Scott: The last thing we got to talk about is the voice acting.

753
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:41,158
Scott: now The problem here is that in a show where there's not a lot of animation and you're gonna need some pretty good voice acting To get everything across.

754
01:02:41,178 --> 01:02:49,202
Rym: Yeah I mean luckily they put almost all of their animation effort into the characters eyes and the character designs do emote a lot Yep.

755
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:53,800
Scott: Well the voice acting in Japanese is awesome.

756
01:02:54,161 --> 01:02:55,705
Rym: It is so excellent.

757
01:02:56,127 --> 01:03:09,980
Rym: it I mean not only is it so excellent and amazing and not only did these actors Go all out and do exactly what this show needed But Scott's gonna tell you a little bit about perhaps our favorite voice actor ever.

758
01:03:10,301 --> 01:03:23,092
Rym: Yeah, who is not only Kiryu Toga my favorite character in any anime ever other than maybe captain Tyler but he is Everyone cool in every anime I've ever liked just about yet.

759
01:03:23,173 --> 01:03:32,372
Scott: There is a guy and his name is Takehito Koyasu, right and He was Toga in utenna, which is a very important character in a tenet.

760
01:03:32,412 --> 01:03:33,836
Scott: Perhaps my favorite character in the tenet.

761
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:37,725
Scott: He's also Takahashi Ryo Suke.

762
01:03:37,826 --> 01:03:41,276
Rym: He is also initial D. Hoto Hori from Fushigi Yugi.

763
01:03:41,296 --> 01:03:46,728
Scott: He is also Moolah Flaga in Gundam seed.

764
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:51,512
Scott: he's also like a bajillion other Characters that you love.

765
01:03:51,673 --> 01:03:53,544
Rym: he is in Everything.

766
01:03:53,564 --> 01:03:56,276
Scott: he is in everything and everything he is in.

767
01:03:56,296 --> 01:04:00,891
Scott: he is awesome And I don't know what else I can say about this guy then.

768
01:04:00,931 --> 01:04:02,960
Scott: he's the greatest Japanese voice actor to ever live.

769
01:04:03,334 --> 01:04:10,519
Rym: Yeah And the thing is he can only really play like this one kind of at least as far as all the roles I've heard him in because he's done a lot of stuff that I've never seen.

770
01:04:10,802 --> 01:04:16,303
Rym: Yep, he plays the iconic Really really cool guy Mm-hmm.

771
01:04:16,464 --> 01:04:19,159
Rym: His voice is just so dark and deep and smooth.

772
01:04:20,001 --> 01:04:21,627
Rym: Yep, I don't know.

773
01:04:21,668 --> 01:04:22,671
Rym: This guy's just amazing.

774
01:04:22,752 --> 01:04:23,876
Rym: I would love to meet him.

775
01:04:23,977 --> 01:04:30,629
Rym: He's one of the few Japanese voice actors in the world I would actually Honestly really want to meet and talk to.

776
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:32,760
Scott: he was Ken shiro and new fist of the North Star.

777
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:35,630
Scott: Oh, I'm just going on the list picking up crazy stuff here.

778
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:38,380
Rym: Yeah, he I think he's a boba boba boba boba.

779
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,586
Scott: He's bud mint in KO century.

780
01:04:41,847 --> 01:04:43,933
Rym: Oh bud mint best character in that show.

Scott: He's Luke Valentine and hell sing.

782
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,780
Scott: He's bonbon gatekeepers.

783
01:04:51,881 --> 01:04:53,609
Scott: Wow, yeah, he's a lot of stuff.

784
01:04:53,629 --> 01:05:00,779
Scott: he's in some Harlock he's in samurai Champloo He's ill palazzo and Excel saga as well as some other characters in Excel saga.

785
01:05:01,741 --> 01:05:04,511
Scott: God, this guy is like the god of voice acting.

786
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:13,853
Rym: now and when he's in a show, you know The voice acting is gonna be good at least his voice acting Yeah, but seriously not to disparage any of the other voice actors in utenna.

787
01:05:13,973 --> 01:05:14,956
Rym: I yeah, they're all.

788
01:05:15,096 --> 01:05:17,083
Scott: whoever they did whoever they were They were all awesome.

789
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:17,826
Rym: Now.

790
01:05:17,846 --> 01:05:29,310
Rym: I wish this weren't the case, but I have to say utenna in America has Unequivocably the worst dub ever done.

791
01:05:29,852 --> 01:05:31,517
Rym: I say that with authority.

792
01:05:31,597 --> 01:05:39,860
Scott: Good fucking God It is so bad as to be painful and unwatchable under any circumstance.

793
01:05:40,524 --> 01:05:44,950
Rym: Now you might say but wait a minute There's got to be some hentai with the worst dub.

794
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:47,220
Rym: and the answer is there might be but I haven't seen the answer.

795
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:51,092
Rym: The answer is probably but the reason this is the worst worst dub ever?

796
01:05:51,112 --> 01:05:58,880
Rym: because not only was the Japanese voice acting just so good but the show Relied so much on voice acting and was so good.

797
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:04,720
Rym: This is probably the biggest disparity in quality of dub to quality of show ever.

798
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:11,620
Scott: Yeah, I think it's just that you know, there are some shows that don't require such a great voice acting.

799
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,340
Scott: You know, you can get by with an easy voice acting.

800
01:06:14,481 --> 01:06:17,880
Scott: So if you just do a standard effort voice acting the show will still come off.

801
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:22,292
Scott: All right, who tenor requires the highest quality of voice acting?

802
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,900
Scott: Yeah, I think a good example nearly impossible to be satisfactory.

803
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:39,771
Scott: So putting in the same effort as you put into another show like if you take the raw, you know The numerical quality of the voice acting from with tenor and put it on another show you might say oh, it's okay job But no fruit Anna.

804
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:41,422
Scott: It's a terrible job It's.

805
01:06:41,803 --> 01:06:48,380
Rym: I mean, I watched like four episodes dubbed near the beginning and they were painful and I thought you know what?

806
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,186
Rym: It's got to get better.

807
01:06:49,509 --> 01:06:50,639
Rym: It's gotta get better.

808
01:06:51,202 --> 01:06:56,940
Rym: I watch dubs from near the end of the show and not only is it not better But it might have gotten worse in some ways.

809
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:57,321
Rym: It's just.

810
01:06:58,144 --> 01:07:00,693
Rym: I can't describe to you how bad this dub is.

811
01:07:00,774 --> 01:07:01,576
Rym: Don't watch it.

812
01:07:01,878 --> 01:07:02,560
Rym: Don't watch it.

813
01:07:02,821 --> 01:07:05,691
Rym: I know when anime world order tells you not to watch something you watch it.

814
01:07:05,972 --> 01:07:06,855
Rym: We're I'm not kidding.

815
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,160
Rym: Don't watch the dub.

816
01:07:08,521 --> 01:07:18,216
Scott: Yeah, I mean this even has a couple good voice actors like Crispin Freeman and some other people But they're not good in this show and they might be good other times.

817
01:07:18,236 --> 01:07:18,960
Scott: They're not good here.

818
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:19,802
Rym: I wonder why.

819
01:07:19,823 --> 01:07:21,147
Rym: I mean did they not get the show?

820
01:07:21,247 --> 01:07:22,952
Rym: did they not where they just directed?

821
01:07:23,033 --> 01:07:23,554
Rym: poorly?

822
01:07:23,795 --> 01:07:25,420
Rym: maybe that their writing was bad?

823
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:29,117
Rym: I mean I have no idea the dialogue ever know the dialogue in the show?

824
01:07:29,177 --> 01:07:36,158
Rym: part of the problem Is that it's very complex, and it's layered with metaphor upon metaphor, and I think it was really hard to translate that.

825
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:37,363
Scott: yeah It could be.

826
01:07:38,146 --> 01:07:41,179
Scott: I don't know the voice acting in the English dub is bad.

827
01:07:41,621 --> 01:07:43,588
Scott: Utena must be watched with subtitles.

828
01:07:43,648 --> 01:07:44,752
Scott: There is no alternative.

829
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:46,920
Scott: anything else we can say about this crazy show?

830
01:07:47,742 --> 01:07:48,746
Rym: I mean all I can really say.

831
01:07:48,766 --> 01:07:53,140
Rym: eventually I'd love to do one or more episodes on Utena and what I really feel about.

832
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,320
Scott: Yeah, we noticed that Rym just can't stop talking about it.

833
01:07:55,644 --> 01:08:03,365
Rym: I mean I had to check myself And I like every time I was starting to talk about the plot I could pretty much tell you the entire plot the order of All the God.

834
01:08:03,867 --> 01:08:06,900
Rym: I could talk an entire show just about toga.

835
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,730
Rym: Seriously, I could do a whole show just on toga.

836
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:14,886
Rym: his motivation where he came from where he's going all the things that happen to Him why it's important?

837
01:08:14,906 --> 01:08:15,830
Rym: what metaphors were there.

838
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:17,015
Scott: I don't think anyone wants to hear that.

839
01:08:17,095 --> 01:08:17,819
Rym: no probably not.

840
01:08:17,859 --> 01:08:21,291
Rym: however I've been to some decent panels on Utena over the years.

841
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:23,538
Rym: actually there was a really good one at Katsucon last year.

842
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:29,779
Scott: Utena Is a show that you can just have a lot of panels about because there's just so much stuff.

843
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:37,867
Rym: You can just keep talking and talking and talking and talking, but the thing is unlike Ava which people do the same thing for Ava the debt.

844
01:08:37,886 --> 01:08:40,060
Rym: there's only so much depth to Ava.

845
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,407
Rym: I mean obviously the also.

846
01:08:41,506 --> 01:08:43,939
Scott: Utena does have 13 more episodes yes, which helps out.

847
01:08:44,201 --> 01:08:48,979
Rym: But obviously the psychological depth of Ava whether you like it or not is actually really deep and really well done.

848
01:08:49,404 --> 01:08:59,438
Rym: But in terms of the rest of Ava It's not as deep as a lot of people try to make it out to be and it's really hard To have a real argument about what Evangelion means beyond the psychological stuff.

849
01:08:59,578 --> 01:09:05,234
Rym: mm-hmm Utena you a lot of people agree as to exactly what Utena is about.

850
01:09:05,354 --> 01:09:07,120
Rym: if they've seen it all once you've seen it all.

851
01:09:07,501 --> 01:09:16,120
Scott: It's very hard to argue against a lot of the things that mostly because the main thing they just come straight out with it Yeah, and everything else sort of falls off of that.

852
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:16,582
Scott: It's sort of.

853
01:09:16,602 --> 01:09:17,466
Scott: it's sort of like.

854
01:09:17,969 --> 01:09:25,131
Scott: you know it's sort of like there's a tree And you're trying to see the tree all right And you're not sure what shape the trunk is or what kind of tree it is.

855
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:25,854
Scott: and you got.

856
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:35,920
Scott: you see leaves and maybe you See some fruit and then at the end of the show They're like they show you a picture of the trunk, and you're like motherfucking goddamn sons of bitches.

857
01:09:36,582 --> 01:09:40,238
Scott: And then the rest of it kind of follows is like well now they know what the fucking trunk looks like.

858
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,714
Scott: yeah Everything else is fucking you know obvious.

859
01:09:42,774 --> 01:09:45,000
Scott: now great Oh, oh well That's terrific.

860
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:55,669
Scott: And then you start looking around the tree and seeing all the things that are obvious you just hadn't thought of and you just want to Frickin hit your head against the wall sometimes yep Especially watching the show the second time through.

861
01:09:55,990 --> 01:10:01,237
Rym: it's one of the few shows and we've said this but really Watching you ten of the second time through is an entirely different show.

862
01:10:01,257 --> 01:10:03,688
Scott: all right I think I know how I want to end this a little here.

863
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:04,370
Scott: all right.

864
01:10:04,511 --> 01:10:05,514
Scott: now one piece of.

865
01:10:05,836 --> 01:10:12,216
Scott: I'm not gonna spoil the show For you, but here's a piece of advice to help keep you a little bit more sane.

866
01:10:12,577 --> 01:10:22,240
Scott: when watching utana Every episode just keep asking yourself this question you ready how the fuck is a castle hanging from the sky?

867
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:25,213
Scott: How the fuck is a castle hanging from the sky?

868
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:26,920
Scott: what the fuck yeah?

869
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:31,800
Scott: You keep asking yourself because he eventually what happened to me is I just accepted it.

870
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:36,849
Rym: I'm like oh, there's a castle hanging from the sky of course yeah It's not just the castle everything in the show I mean.

871
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:41,926
Rym: when utana first runs into these duels her reaction is basically What the fuck is this shit Charles?

872
01:10:42,348 --> 01:10:45,399
Scott: and then by episode 3 it's no longer what the fuck it's.

873
01:10:45,459 --> 01:10:46,654
Scott: oh yeah That's the way it's gonna be.

874
01:10:46,674 --> 01:10:59,294
Scott: yeah You know now a lot of anime as never stop asking yourself How the fuck the castle is hanging from the sky and then the show will make a lot more sense to you And you will not be driven completely batshit into the Arkham assignment.

875
01:10:59,575 --> 01:11:04,610
Rym: so in the end really just I Can't recommend shoujo kakumei utana enough.

876
01:11:04,771 --> 01:11:07,400
Rym: It is seriously an absolutely amazing anime.

877
01:11:07,481 --> 01:11:09,319
Scott: Oh, how do we buy the DVDs?

878
01:11:10,501 --> 01:11:10,984
Rym: Just buy them.

879
01:11:11,124 --> 01:11:12,794
Scott: Yeah, who are they from CPM?

880
01:11:12,814 --> 01:11:13,598
Rym: I think I think so.

881
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:14,522
Scott: I don't there.

882
01:11:14,643 --> 01:11:21,647
Scott: they should be kind of cheap now if you buy three separate box sets one for each season But they're really bad DVDs.

883
01:11:21,808 --> 01:11:26,160
Scott: actually yeah, well they get the menus are terrible and the extras are terrible.

884
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:32,157
Rym: It's partly just because they're kind of older DVD especially the first season the first season of utana that I bought.

885
01:11:32,418 --> 01:11:33,020
Rym: I play bad.

886
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:36,853
Rym: Yeah, yeah was so like old-school DVD menu.

887
01:11:37,194 --> 01:11:42,458
Scott: Yeah, they're pretty bad DVDs But they're cheap and there's a lot of episodes per disc and they're kind of worth it.

888
01:11:42,518 --> 01:11:45,534
Rym: and also I mean they're only bad DVDs in terms of the extras and stuff.

889
