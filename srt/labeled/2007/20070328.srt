00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,798
Rym: It's Wednesday March 28th.

2
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:12,620
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:14,828
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:19,050
Rym: tonight We review the first volume of Keiko Takemiya's to Tara.

5
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:21,727
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,517 --> 00:00:31,136
Rym: So a while ago we decided to have a couple of contests here at GeekNights since we had a bunch of various free stuff to lay around and We thought it'd be fun.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,930
Rym: and one of those contests Which is over is relevant to tonight.

8
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:40,190
Rym: And I must say you guys really disappointed in terms of telling us about the worst anime ever.

9
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:41,053
Scott: I don't know.

10
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:42,900
Scott: are people just not paying attention to?

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,306
Scott: people want contests.

12
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:45,450
Scott: Do you not want contests?

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:53,970
Rym: Well, we got a lot of entries But I'll be honest the entries were all pretty crap or didn't really follow the rules so much or didn't actually do what we asked.

14
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:55,675
Scott: Yeah, and they're you know.

15
00:00:55,695 --> 00:01:06,790
Scott: while there were you know some entries there weren't a lot compared to how many people I know We're out there listening to this also compared to the Thursday night contest which got more quality entries than I know how to deal with.

16
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:09,079
Scott: Yeah, so what the hell guys?

17
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:11,690
Scott: maybe we just won't give out a prize because everyone lost.

18
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:18,329
Rym: I just don't think anyone's actually seen that much bad anime Or if they have they don't obviously have the ability to write effectively about it.

19
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:25,963
Scott: Yeah, when we say hey, we want you to write something and you just say yeah, this anime was pretty bad That does that's that?

20
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:28,335
Rym: no I suppose I didn't want to have to say that.

21
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:29,719
Rym: I guess grammar counts.

22
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:32,729
Rym: some of them are just not readable and some of them it.

23
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:35,239
Scott: It's like you didn't even write a paragraph.

24
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,488
Scott: most of these things are less than two sentences.

25
00:01:37,628 --> 00:01:42,706
Scott: now compare I was and if I was gonna enter this contest I would have written a multi paragraph essay.

26
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:53,710
Rym: now compare They expected to Thursday night where not only we get a ton of entries for the worst podcast in the world contest But a few of the entries pushed the one or two page mark.

27
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:57,383
Rym: They wrote diatribes about how bad these things were with examples.

28
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:59,250
Scott: Yeah, that's what you got to do people.

29
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,970
Scott: You're not gonna get free stuff without doing some work here.

30
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:08,658
Rym: Yeah, so we're gonna go through them, but if no one gave us a good entry We're not gonna give you the MD guy soundtrack.

31
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,870
Rym: No well mail you something maybe but it's not gonna be MD guys.

32
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:13,426
Rym: No, it's too good for you.

33
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,848
Scott: Well, it's pretty bad.

34
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:17,293
Scott: Maybe they'll be.

35
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:17,916
Scott: I don't know.

36
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:21,630
Scott: I didn't actually look at all the entries and with a lot of time and care.

37
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:26,005
Scott: So maybe there is one in there, that's good enough, and we can give them the empty guys.

38
00:02:26,326 --> 00:02:28,314
Scott: Yeah, maybe I don't know I gotta go look.

39
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:31,250
Rym: so in the news you can't have ten years of Pokemon.

40
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,457
Scott: Actually you have a lot more than ten years of Pokemon.

41
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:46,155
Rym: well in April the TV show Pokemon that indoctrinated millions of young children around the world into the wonderful fantastic world of marketing is Gonna be ten years old.

42
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:47,360
Scott: now think about that.

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,830
Scott: the Pokemon TV show is ten years old.

44
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,231
Scott: You know what.

45
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:56,090
Scott: the Gameboy game is older, and the manga is older, so Pokemon is real old.

46
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:57,112
Rym: Thing is though.

47
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:58,496
Rym: They're not that much older.

48
00:02:58,557 --> 00:03:02,490
Rym: It surprises me in one that Wow Pokemon came out a long time ago.

49
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:08,381
Rym: I feel old, but then at the same time Wow Pokemon wasn't around nearly as long as I feel like it was.

50
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:18,290
Scott: well see the thing is Pokemon came out in the mid to late 90s and it's the mid to late 2000. so all that stuff that came out around then is becoming a decade old and it's kind of scary.

51
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:30,310
Rym: But when I was in when I first got to RIT I remember you know you think back when I was a freshman in college to When Pokemon was around or whatever and I couldn't imagine a time in my life where there was no Pokemon.

52
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,369
Rym: I couldn't fathom the idea that there was once a time when I never heard of Pikachu.

53
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:40,066
Scott: I Can because there was such a time when I was no one who is born from here on out.

54
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:43,880
Scott: in Western society We'll be able to do so let alone Eastern society.

55
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:45,526
Rym: Yeah, maybe North Korea.

56
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:46,750
Rym: They might not know about Pokemon.

57
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:53,010
Scott: I mean, I just saw a picture yesterday of an airplane with Pokemon like paint job on it or a giant Pokemon decal.

58
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:53,833
Scott: I couldn't tell which.

59
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:57,006
Scott: well just the other day right on the plane you get Pokemon stuff.

60
00:03:57,307 --> 00:04:05,998
Rym: just the other day We were playing Smash Brothers since it's the best game on the Wii right now And I used Pikachu like three times.

61
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:09,690
Scott: yeah, cuz you like to use Pikachu because yes, he's super cheap.

62
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,586
Scott: He is that lightning that comes down from the sky so no one can attack you from above.

63
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:16,677
Scott: they can only attack you from the Against mediocre players.

64
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:19,927
Rym: Pikachu is cheap and amazing against anyone knows what they're doing.

65
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:20,829
Rym: Pikachu is kind of useless.

66
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:27,410
Scott: Yeah, just the thing is if someone else is Pikachu you can't come at them from above because he'll drop the lightning on you.

67
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,182
Rym: Yeah, if I'm playing against people who actually know what they're doing.

68
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,568
Rym: I almost always use Falco.

69
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:33,376
Scott: Yeah Oh, you're not.

70
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:34,541
Scott: we're not that good at that game.

71
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:36,149
Rym: Anyway, most I'm better than you.

72
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,973
Scott: No, you're not.

73
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:41,170
Scott: most people who know what they're doing at the game kick both our asses though real hard.

74
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,617
Scott: We don't even have a chance to do damage.

75
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:51,050
Rym: Yeah, luckily whenever the new one comes out I imagine I'm gonna sit down and put actual effort into being the best there ever was or at least in the top million.

76
00:04:51,251 --> 00:05:02,030
Scott: Yeah, and since I'm hoping that it uses more Wii type controls and less old-school fighting type controls I'll actually have a chance of because my old-school fighting type control skills are not so high.

77
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:09,610
Scott: so if it's all about Wii controls I can definitely get ahead and Maybe be the best there is at Smash Brothers brawl.

78
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:12,784
Rym: So there's really nothing else I can say about Pokemon.

79
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:15,602
Rym: being 10 years old I could make it you can't something.

80
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:24,818
Scott: 10 Pokemon joke but I already did and it's kind of lost his position as Pokemon came out when I was like in high school and High school 10 years ago.

81
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:27,830
Rym: God damn don't think about it because then you're gonna remember.

82
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,997
Rym: I mean remember that stupid sci-fi thing.

83
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,302
Rym: I was watching wild palms.

84
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:34,172
Rym: I saw that when I was like 11.

85
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:42,138
Scott: So, you know Makoto Shinkai the guy who did plays promised and voices of a distant star and Some other stuff that we never saw.

86
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,467
Scott: but now I realize it exists and I kind of want to see it.

87
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:47,418
Rym: of things He is done that I have seen he's batting a thousand.

88
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,430
Scott: Yeah, he's made basically two things that I've seen.

89
00:05:51,013 --> 00:05:53,708
Scott: They've both been basically the same only different.

90
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:57,763
Rym: Yep We both disagree a little bit as to which one is better, but I agree.

91
00:05:57,884 --> 00:05:59,510
Rym: I would agree that they're both very good.

92
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,461
Rym: I really liked place promised and I really like toshino car.

93
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:06,792
Scott: Well, his new thing is called Biyoko's.

94
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:08,202
Scott: no be also crew.

95
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:10,973
Rym: five centimeter Five centimeter.

96
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,619
Scott: that's called five centimeters per second.

97
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,850
Scott: people aren't quite sure but it might be called five centimeters per second.

98
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:18,573
Scott: Okay show.

99
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:32,890
Rym: All right now considering that I've seen two different works by this guy I'm gonna hazard a guess that this somehow involves a boy and a girl who like each other in some way and then are Separated and are either trying to come back together or cannot come back together.

100
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:35,903
Scott: Yeah, basically that's what it is he's.

101
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,530
Scott: it's a three-part movie.

102
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:45,799
Scott: I guess I don't know if you'd call it an OAV, but it's like three separate 30-minute things that go together and You can get part one on the bit.

103
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,093
Scott: Torrance right now with the fansubs Uh-huh.

104
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:53,650
Rym: It seems like this guy might be a one-trick pony, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

105
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:54,534
Scott: No, it's it's not.

106
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:56,242
Scott: it's sort of like the guy who does snatch.

107
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:57,810
Scott: Yeah, he's Madonna's husband.

108
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:04,399
Scott: I think I Richie, you know, he only has a one trick but his trick is real good And I don't mind him doing that trick again.

109
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,847
Rym: He dodges bullets.

110
00:07:05,987 --> 00:07:10,863
Scott: Avi It's like who else is a one-trick pony that does real good at that.

111
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:12,950
Scott: one trick Nintendo Nintendo's real.

112
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,550
Scott: Yeah, make a Mario game make another Mario game.

113
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:22,510
Rym: See, I can't say Satoshi khan because wall you see something that he did and you think wow Satoshi khan did that?

114
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,708
Rym: No, they're all still really unique and amazing and different.

115
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:32,396
Scott: Yep It is sometimes hard to tell between someone who has a distinctive style Or artistic.

116
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:39,804
Scott: I don't know theme Versus someone who is doing the same thing every time, you know, like Tezuka.

117
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:42,494
Scott: if you see a Tezuka work, you know immediately It's a Tezuka.

118
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:44,828
Scott: It's like, you know a Van Gogh painting when you see it.

119
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:47,650
Scott: But Van Gogh is not a one-trick pony and neither is Tezuka.

120
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,473
Rym: Well, the problem with.

121
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:50,622
Rym: that is we'll get into in the rest of the show.

122
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:55,750
Rym: to most people who read manga If you look at any manga from the 70s, you'll think wow, that's a Tezuka.

123
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:03,085
Scott: Yeah, possibly Maybe so, but yeah, I guess you'd have to know who Tezuka was though.

124
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:04,410
Scott: Some people don't even know.

125
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:09,334
Rym: Well, if you knew if you showed him Phoenix and all those things look at this Look at this look at this.

126
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:12,250
Rym: and then you handed him something else from the 70s and said look at this.

127
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:13,827
Rym: They'd say by the same guy, right?

128
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,065
Rym: Things of the day.

129
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:25,715
Rym: now, there's a show in Japan called challenger on fire.

130
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:26,939
Rym: I don't know very much about it.

131
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,027
Scott: It involves setting people on fire.

132
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,897
Rym: it might rabbit it might damn.

133
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:32,600
Scott: that's awesome.

134
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,054
Rym: I want to see this see the way this particular episode works.

135
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:46,560
Rym: my thing of the day That is is that they've got a hundred people in Japan many of whom are cosplay And the goal is they've asked all of them to name a hundred anime characters.

136
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:54,992
Rym: So they all sit there with a little whiteboard and a shield between all the people around him on this big thing And they'll show an anime character like cutie honey or tuxedo.

137
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:59,047
Rym: come in or Asuka and then Everyone left to write down the character's name.

138
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,311
Scott: Oh, okay.

139
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,335
Scott: I thought it was name on.

140
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:02,820
Scott: I can name 100 anime characters.

141
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,030
Scott: It was just naming them.

142
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:05,100
Scott: I could come up with a hunch.

143
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:10,175
Rym: I guess it's recognize and know how to spell the name of a hundred anime characters.

144
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:19,047
Scott: see not that would be okay in English But it's actually harder in Japanese because a lot of the characters like a complicated kanji in their name and while you might go Oh, that's so-and-so.

145
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:25,840
Rym: if you don't know the kanji your SOL I'm not sure the rules of how exact they had to be and you could always just write things out in Kana.

146
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,219
Rym: So it wouldn't have been that big a deal.

147
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,404
Scott: Yeah I could tell.

148
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:30,493
Scott: I can always tell someone got it right because they would.

149
00:09:30,713 --> 00:09:31,015
Scott: I couldn't.

150
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:33,428
Scott: well I couldn't understand what they were saying 100%.

151
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:35,139
Scott: you would see when they showed the answer.

152
00:09:35,764 --> 00:09:40,231
Scott: You know there'd be some symbols under the picture of the character And then you look at what the people wrote on their whiteboard.

153
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,820
Scott: if the symbols match they got it right.

154
00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:43,445
Rym: I was very happy.

155
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:47,257
Rym: I've learned enough hiragana that I actually recognized a few characters written names.

156
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:48,120
Scott: Holy crap.

157
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:54,260
Rym: Yeah, if I could only learn katakana and more than one kanji, and then maybe any amount of Japanese grammar.

158
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:55,409
Rym: But anyway, I digress.

159
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:56,639
Rym: now it starts out.

160
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:02,760
Rym: Okay And very quickly the number of contestants dwindles because ever if you get one wrong you're out done forever.

161
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:04,265
Scott: What single elimination?

162
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:05,289
Rym: single elimination?

163
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:08,400
Scott: that's tough especially if they throw like an obscure character right away?

164
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,993
Scott: But what if everyone gets it wrong?

165
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:10,679
Scott: does everyone out?

166
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,244
Rym: I'm not sure how they did it.

167
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:24,938
Rym: see the things entirely in Japanese and while I picked out a few phrases like at one point He says the anime loving fan in green has lost or something to that effect that I have no idea What was actually going on?

168
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,204
Rym: But it's easy to see.

169
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:34,400
Rym: you can watch and figure it out, and they always say the name of the character Even though they don't write it in English so you can play along with the game and see if you knew him.

170
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:39,060
Rym: I'll admit that after the first few I didn't know any of them for a while.

171
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:43,218
Scott: I barely knew any of them like I knew Asuka, and I knew Kenshiro.

172
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:43,560
Rym: Kenshiro.

173
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:55,059
Scott: I knew some other ones Yeah, but a lot of these are just obscure like I knew that one of the guys is from like the super plastic wrestling Whatever it is, but I didn't know the character's name.

174
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,451
Rym: Well the funny thing was some of them that were.

175
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,440
Rym: I had no idea never seen him before.

176
00:10:59,782 --> 00:11:03,420
Rym: But you see all the contestants like oh duh, and they write it down like nothing.

177
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:07,493
Scott: Yeah, it's like that must be some show some old show that we've never seen.

178
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:09,560
Rym: that must be like a goofy or a Donald Duck.

179
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:12,873
Scott: You know this would be a fun thing to do at a convention.

180
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:16,546
Rym: so actually I've already added that To our con repertoire.

181
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:27,060
Scott: Yeah, we just need to get a hundred pictures of anime characters on a laptop, and then yeah That's like you're making a PowerPoint And you just push space to reveal the name and you push space to go to the next picture.

182
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:29,080
Rym: I've already sketched out exactly how we'll do it.

183
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:36,740
Rym: I'm gonna append to our Otakon I guess resume And we'll see if we do this at any cons with or instead of the anime match game.

184
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:38,340
Scott: Let's prepare it and do it in the future.

185
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,680
Rym: Maybe we could do it at katsu-kan or something we could do to some of the small cons this year.

186
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:57,540
Rym: Yeah, definitely like a test out, but anyway the other cool thing is that they've got some guests like special guests competing one of whom is Akira Kamiya who I've met at an amazement, and he is a super awesome voice actor who has been in pretty much everything.

187
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,906
Scott: Yeah, he's a big-time guy.

188
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,254
Scott: voice acted a whole shit ton of care.

189
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:05,903
Rym: He's right up there with my man Takahashi Rioske.

190
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:07,091
Scott: you forget his real name.

191
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:11,218
Rym: I do forget his me too But yeah, he's as good as that guy.

192
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:13,726
Rym: yeah He's also super awesome and super funny.

193
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:18,520
Rym: the field of competition narrows very quickly to these two dudes.

194
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:24,418
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of weird because the field of competition has some super nerdy people in it and some cosplayers And it's kind of scary.

195
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:32,929
Scott: But the two dudes left at the end seemed kind of like normal geeky cool dudes and eventually the guy gets to like 75 if it comes down to one man.

196
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,105
Scott: He makes it to like 75 or yeah cuz even though he's the winner He's beating everyone else.

197
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:37,930
Scott: everyone else is out.

198
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,553
Scott: remember.

199
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:40,080
Scott: It's a hundred anime characters.

200
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,867
Scott: He you know he has to make it to a hundred.

201
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:44,456
Rym: now in the end you can't name 100 anime characters.

202
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:52,120
Rym: in the end The saddest thing is the character that comes up is Zenigata from Lupin and now everyone knows that Agata.

203
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,983
Scott: He knows an Agata obviously.

204
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:55,265
Scott: I mean it's obvious.

205
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:56,887
Scott: It's freaking said Agata.

206
00:12:57,048 --> 00:13:04,974
Rym: It looked like he didn't know Zen Agata's full name or he had trouble figuring out what kanji to write and he Puts around a little.

207
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:07,083
Rym: he failed and they knocked him out of the competition.

208
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:08,950
Scott: Yeah, I think he couldn't write the name correctly.

209
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,291
Scott: That's.

210
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:15,489
Rym: I need someone who understands Japanese to watch this and tell me what he actually wrote so I figure out why he lost.

211
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,590
Scott: if He didn't know Zen Agata, then this completely changes everything.

212
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:23,390
Rym: How could you know all those characters and not know Zen Agata?

213
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:26,766
Scott: I don't know if an American knows Zen Agata, and you don't that's.

214
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:27,570
Scott: that's for shame.

215
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:28,533
Scott: All right.

216
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:31,363
Scott: my thing of the day is a new blog.

217
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:34,594
Scott: the blog has only been going since last month But it was.

218
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:37,385

00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:41,215
Scott: the blog is Miotd.com.

Scott: Miotd stands for mecha image of the day.

Scott: my thing of the day is the image of the day.

00:13:52,492 --> 00:13:53,316
Scott: It's pretty awesome.

224
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:56,169
Rym: Huh I could see a few of our friends really digging that.

225
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,032
Scott: yeah There's a guy.

226
00:13:57,052 --> 00:14:03,970
Scott: it says on the bottom of the blog cap copyright Patrick McFarland images copyright at original artists.

227
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:14,283
Scott: So there's a guy Patrick McFarland who I must assume is making this blog and every day He finds an awesome mecha image and posts it And I think he's going to continue doing so.

228
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:17,699
Scott: he started last month And he shows no signs of slowing down.

229
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:29,709
Scott: and today's image is an awesome High-resolution CG rendering of my favorite mecha the vf1 s from Macross And it is quite awesome.

230
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:36,110
Scott: So if you like mechas perhaps robots or planes or other?

231
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:42,550
Scott: Mechanical bits from anime you should subscribe to the RSS feed of mecha image of the day.

232
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:47,487
Rym: So these these aren't mechas that are also girls and not that I've seen yet, okay?

233
00:14:48,672 --> 00:14:51,590
Scott: That's that's yet to peruse the entire archive.

00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:55,904
Scott: But let me give you an example of some of the things you will find in there.

00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:11,970
Rym: what mecha was in Star Wars?

239
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,619
Scott: It's an imperial star destroyer size chart.

246
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:35,295
Rym: We wanted to review right away, but we actually for the last couple weeks due to some sort of insanity Have a schedule.

247
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:39,790
Rym: we have an internal calendar, and we actually planned out the show months in advance.

248
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,579
Rym: Yes, so so as a result.

249
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,439
Rym: we ended up doing other things first and while we wanted to do this We've just gotten to it now, and

250
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:57,000
Scott: we basically you know Every month we'll sit down and we'll come up with show ideas for the next weeks and weeks and weeks And that way we won't come home every day going.

251
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,144
Scott: Why do we do the show on?

252
00:15:58,667 --> 00:15:59,169
Scott: I don't know.

253
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:05,710
Rym: granted We've planned out months worth of Mondays Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and we've got like one Thursday ready to go.

254
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:07,758
Scott: Yeah, yeah, we'll work on that.

255
00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:09,123
Scott: We'll work on that this weekend.

256
00:16:09,665 --> 00:16:14,326
Rym: Yeah, anyway tonight We're going to review something that has come out very recently so recently in fact.

257
00:16:14,386 --> 00:16:21,781
Scott: if you Google around You're not gonna find too much about it unless you know how to type it in Japanese where I'm sure you could find a whole Bunch of stuff in Japanese.

258
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:37,458
Rym: probably yes But Keiko Takemiya's to Terra or Terra a or towards the Terra or however you want to translate it it's a manga that was written in the early 70s by obviously Keiko Takemiya and Before we get any further.

259
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:39,974
Rym: I just like to say that I really like it But maybe it's cuz.

260
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:42,570
Rym: I've been on a kick for this old 70s kind of manga lately.

261
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:43,654
Scott: I don't know.

262
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:51,950
Scott: I think it's just this is the kind of thing that if my My likes were a bowling alley this sort of things is strike right down the middle.

263
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:55,018
Rym: Oh, so you're into the shonen eyes space drama.

264
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:59,190
Scott: No not really, but it's the it's see it's not really shown an eye.

265
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:00,449
Scott: I mean well not yet.

266
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:02,115
Scott: No Yeah as far as I can tell.

267
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:09,809
Scott: see this is published by in the United States by By vertical ink and vertical ink are the people who published you know?

268
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:15,356
Scott: ode to kirohito And all that other good stuff like now.

269
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:16,299
Rym: it's very uh.

270
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,728
Rym: vertical ink as in vertical incorporated not as in vertical ink.

271
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:21,950
Scott: oh yes Yes, that's right vertical incorporated.

272
00:17:23,352 --> 00:17:33,340
Scott: And they published this and when they were marketing it right they were like check out the new sci-fi Epic from the master of shoujo Keiko Takemiya.

273
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,764
Scott: well shoujo in space.

274
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,008
Scott: It's Star Trek shoujo.

275
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:36,670
Scott: check it out.

276
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,390
Rym: They're really pushing it as though it's shoujo, and I've also seen a lot of people call it an emo manga.

277
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:46,290
Scott: Yeah, that was on the bookmark that I took from the vertical ink booth at the New York.

278
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:47,855
Rym: Oh, yeah, it is on this bookmark.

279
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:48,477
Scott: It said.

280
00:17:48,698 --> 00:17:49,200
Scott: What does it say?

281
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,410
Rym: read it the bookmark says in space?

282
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:59,889
Rym: No one can hear you cry to Tara the hit sci-fi emo manga by shoujo master Keiko Takemiya.

283
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:08,250
Scott: now I don't know if they're just lying with this marketing or Pretending that it's a shoujo in order to get sales because shoujo is popular in the US.

284
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:13,889
Scott: I don't know, but first of all Keiko Takemiya is definitely a shoujo manga artist.

285
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:25,930
Rym: well I think that is primarily because here they kind of say that oh from the master of shoujo See Takemiya is considered by a lot of people to be one of the founding mothers of shoujo as a genre or an idea.

286
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,048
Scott: Yeah, she's pretty much invented like be shown and in shown and I type stuff in the 70s.

287
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:30,851
Scott: Well, she was

288
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:44,228
Rym: a part of this group of people called the fabulous 49ers who I don't know much about But according to Publishers Weekly they were a group of woman artists and writers who quote Established and solidified the girls comics industry in Japan in the mid and late 70s.

289
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:54,290
Scott: Yeah, apparently the other most significant person in that group was her former roommate, so It it's one of those tight-knit groups of people that you know busts out.

290
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:57,564
Rym: Yeah, well I had heard the term fabulous 49ers before now.

291
00:18:57,644 --> 00:18:58,428
Rym: I know what that is.

292
00:18:58,448 --> 00:18:59,861
Scott: yeah I think I heard a new world order.

293
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:09,375
Rym: now There's also a claim that Takemiya gave rise or was the founder of the idea of the genre of Bishounen manga?

294
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:14,339
Rym: because she wrote something called kaze toki no uta Song of wind and trees.

295
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,090
Scott: I think I've heard of that before.

296
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:32,957
Scott: Anyway, all that is true But if you read to Tara volume 1 without anyone telling you anything The only answer that I think you can come up with is that to Tara at least volume 1 is a shounen siren Sci-fi manga, it's not shoujo.

297
00:19:32,977 --> 00:19:34,602
Scott: It's not be shounen.

298
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:35,986
Scott: It's not shounen.

299
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,110
Scott: I it's a man.

300
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:37,332
Scott: It's.

301
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:39,165
Scott: it's like a Tezuka sci-fi.

302
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:39,930
Scott: It's like Phoenix.

303
00:19:40,071 --> 00:19:44,449
Scott: It's the same exact genre as Phoenix volume 2 or Phoenix volume 6.

304
00:19:44,449 --> 00:20:03,390
Rym: granted I can see how people might want to call it shoujo or have shoujo leanings because it does focus a lot on characters personal thoughts and emotions and Interactions and possible love triangles and all that sort of thing a lot more than what you might expect from a typical OMG people in space blowing things up Yep,

305
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:09,245
Scott: and while there isn't any be shown and shown and I action in volume 1 there is definitely.

306
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:13,643
Scott: I can definitely see the series Going there in volume 2 or 3.

307
00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:23,140
Rym: Well an ishi verticals director of marketing and publicity says straight out that the Homosexuality comes in later volumes and there are only three volumes.

308
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,465
Rym: So it's got to be coming pretty quick.

309
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:33,830
Scott: as long as it's not yaoi No, it is manga is good enough that I can tolerate some shown and I action if the story around it is good.

310
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:41,490
Scott: It's sort of like how in ghost in the shell you tolerate the three pages of you know Random lesbians and big boobs because the story is still good enough.

311
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:51,079
Rym: Well, the thing is those specific pages and that ghost in the shell while obviously no one can argue that they weren't just Gratuitous gratuitous horrible pornography.

312
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:56,438
Rym: Yep at the same time the point that was being made There was actually fairly interesting.

313
00:20:56,498 --> 00:21:01,789
Rym: It just probably could have been made in a less sheer otastic way.

314
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,594
Scott: Perhaps perhaps it could.

315
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:10,957
Rym: I mean I can think of a couple ways I could make that point perhaps with stick figures that would convey the same meaning.

316
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:14,682
Scott: I Could convey the same meaning without any pictures at all.

317
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:19,670
Scott: I Could just use some words and in many different languages.

318
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:25,349
Rym: But anyway to Tara is a fairly complex story and it is written in the 70s.

319
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,693
Rym: so the art looks.

320
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:34,479
Rym: if you didn't know anything about this artist and you pick this up and you would read any of Tezuka's works you might just think wow.

321
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,829
Rym: This looks a lot like Phoenix or a lot like Tezuka.

322
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:42,230
Scott: Yes I mean I looked at it and I said wow, this looks a lot like Tezuka except there are two key differences.

323
00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:47,105
Scott: Number one the number one obvious difference between the art in this and the art in Tezuka's works.

324
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:48,710
Scott: Is that the characters?

325
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:53,964
Scott: Faces and head shapes are a lot more shoujo-y than Tezuka-y.

326
00:21:54,204 --> 00:21:56,350
Rym: Yeah, they have larger eyes larger pupils.

327
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,790
Rym: Yeah, they're a lot more expressive and a lot more realistic with small noses.

328
00:21:59,892 --> 00:22:06,910
Scott: Yep The bodies their bodies and like their poses and the clothing and all that sort of stuff is a lot like Tezuka.

329
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,297
Scott: But the faces are definitely.

330
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:13,370
Scott: they have a little bit of Tezuka in them, but they're mostly modern shoujo type faces.

331
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:22,689
Rym: Yeah, though all the normal faces very often will cut away to almost Tezuka style humor or Little weird sketchy drawings or that sort of thing.

332
00:22:22,971 --> 00:22:33,121
Scott: Yeah, depending on the level of zooming and you know, if it's a little panel on the side It might be more like Tezuka, but if it's a big panel, you know Where someone's standing up and it's all close in on one character.

333
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:35,490
Scott: You'll get the full drawn-out shoujo face.

334
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:52,950
Scott: secondly when she draws spaceships or Mechanics or things she puts a lot more detail and draws it a lot more in a modern style than Tezuka Like Tezuka would draw like a cartoony spaceship like, you know a little pointy rocket bit with some holes in it.

335
00:22:53,010 --> 00:23:00,990
Scott: You know like a little circular window She draws a highly detailed rocket ship that it looks a lot more like it would be fit into a Kira or something like that.

336
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:11,622
Rym: then Anything Tezuka would ever draw though I remember if you read Phoenix you see that it uses a lot of very interesting Composition some of which works very well and some of which is just confusing.

337
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:17,229
Rym: and there's a lot of that into Tara, too But it's a lot more subdued and generally makes a lot more sense.

338
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:27,330
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't seem too highly Experimental with like layouts or anything like that, but it doesn't just stick to normal boring layouts.

339
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:28,800
Scott: There's definitely some exciting stuff.

340
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,008
Scott: She just doesn't go crazy with it.

341
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:40,390
Rym: Yep There's a lot of profile zoomed in shot on the side while people talk next to it or Various almost a montage of different things while speech is happening.

342
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:50,750
Rym: now the story of two Tara is both simple and complex at the same time and Actually reminds me of a great many other words some of which came before and some of which came after this.

343
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,134
Scott: Yeah, I mean you can't help.

344
00:23:52,395 --> 00:24:04,687
Scott: but when you read this unless you are so uncultured and unwell read You can't help but feeling like you've read this story before like you've heard it before in a million other places Even if you can't quite put your finger on it.

345
00:24:05,231 --> 00:24:07,405
Scott: And I wonder this was made in the early 70s.

346
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:14,569
Scott: now was this the first time this story was told and we missed it until now because language barrier.

347
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:20,063
Scott: or Is this just another telling of the story that we've heard a thousand times?

348
00:24:20,444 --> 00:24:22,510
Rym: Well consider that it does remind me a lot.

349
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,829
Rym: It's just of one thing in particular a brave new world.

350
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:29,121
Scott: It's a little bit of brave new world going on there only in brave new world.

351
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:34,665
Scott: The children were sort of engineered before Conception I guess, you know in test tubes.

352
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:38,558
Scott: Yeah, and in this one They seem to engineer the children after they get out.

353
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:48,272
Rym: see the story is that the earth at that we live on they call it Tara over time eventually becomes overpopulated depleted and generally Untenable.

354
00:24:48,372 --> 00:24:51,080
Rym: it's on the verge of collapse and humans can't live there anymore.

355
00:24:51,621 --> 00:25:05,344
Rym: So with our vast technology we spread out into space and humans decide that the only way to save their planet and they also I guess they assumedly decide that saving the planet is the highest priority above all else for whatever reason

356
00:25:05,745 --> 00:25:05,966
Scott: that

357
00:25:06,387 --> 00:25:21,252
Rym: they must strictly control the way the planet is used and not let everyone come back to the planet in order to Perfectly use all the resources and ingenuity that humans have available to make the earth the paradise home It once was.

358
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:26,690
Scott: and to do this, of course, obviously you put a computer in charge because people suck.

359
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:29,300
Rym: Yes, I believe they call it superior dominion.

360
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,010
Rym: It's a system where children are born.

361
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:36,626
Rym: This is this isn't really a spoiler so much because this is generally brought about early on.

362
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:40,890
Rym: but we're not gonna go into very much Detail because there are a lot of things you really don't want ruin for you in there.

363
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,472
Rym: There's

364
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:42,637
Scott: a lot of things you don't want ruined

365
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:59,007
Rym: but basically children are raised in space by the computer and by the system and then brainwash along with technology to Have the chance of actually going to earth and then it on earth putting all of their effort toward making earth a better place Or a habitable place.

366
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:16,110
Scott: Yeah, it basically like they raise you in a certain way and then they fuck you and then they raise you in a certain way And then they fuck you and then eventually if you don't if you stick it within the system and you know Do that what the system wants you to do to the best, you know awesomeness and you're the super elite kind of guy.

367
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:20,768
Scott: You'll end up on earth and now get to go to Tara where all humans want to go.

368
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,440
Rym: now This is one nominally like a lot of stories.

369
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:30,670
Rym: We've read before there was one volume of Phoenix That was very specifically about all of the migrants and emigres from earth long ago.

370
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:35,070
Rym: Always want to return to earth and earth doesn't let him come back because it's too small and can't hold them.

371
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:41,150
Scott: It's also similar to Phoenix volume 2 future where computers run the world because humans fucked it up.

372
00:26:41,972 --> 00:26:52,268
Rym: now that is the nominal background of what's going on, but the actual plot has more to do with the fact that a Byproduct of this system is that certain people bit by bit?

373
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,143
Rym: Have started to manifest various things that you can almost call psychic powers.

374
00:26:57,203 --> 00:26:58,949
Rym: In fact, it's frayed up ESP.

375
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:09,374
Scott: Yep It's sort of this part of the plot with these separate people who are cast out, you know for having psychic powers feels a lot like x-men or Like the matrix.

376
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:13,008
Scott: maybe you know where certain people get out of the matrix because they're different.

377
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:15,522
Rym: now these people who have the ESP.

378
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:20,459
Rym: they're called the moo are Killed or cast out as soon as they are discovered.

379
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,225
Scott: Well, it's mu so it might be mu.

380
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:23,489
Rym: It's probably moo.

381
00:27:23,752 --> 00:27:24,508
Scott: Yeah stuff to tell.

382
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:27,859
Rym: Anyway, the they're cast out or killed.

383
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,810
Rym: they they don't want people to even know that this sort of thing exists.

384
00:27:32,472 --> 00:27:38,970
Rym: So the society adapts by coming up with ways to detect these people and dispatch of them early on so they can't cause any trouble.

385
00:27:39,453 --> 00:27:47,205
Scott: And of course, they're a group of them that were Unsuccessfully dispatched that are up to some sort of business.

386
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:48,830
Scott: Yes that I won't spoil.

387
00:27:49,082 --> 00:28:04,558
Rym: Yes You do learn this right away that some of the two of the early main characters who are obviously both moo and living among these exiled people are soldier blue the quote visionary first leader of the moo and Pfizer's the quote blind fortune teller.

388
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,708
Scott: soldier blue is the best character in the whole manga.

389
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:09,479
Rym: I don't know I really like Keith onion.

390
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:10,910
Scott: Yeah, he's alright.

391
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,692
Scott: If you haven't had any soldier blue you see the story

392
00:28:13,913 --> 00:28:33,813
Rym: starts with Jomi Marcus Shen who lives in a normal life is a normal kid kind of bright in this whole system and one thing leads to another and there are implications that he may or may not be a moo and His parents worry about this and his friends yell at him and I really don't want to go any further without ruining What happens.

393
00:28:33,873 --> 00:28:37,970
Rym: because it goes the plot moves at a rather quick clip to put it lightly.

394
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:39,356
Scott: Yeah, it's it.

395
00:28:39,738 --> 00:28:42,170
Scott: even though the plot moves really quickly.

396
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:56,545
Scott: I think it sort of has to move pretty quickly early on because the first at least half of this volume They're just sort of setting up the universe and the characters still I mean they introduced like really important characters Around the halfway point.

397
00:28:56,686 --> 00:29:05,090
Scott: it's like whoa You know and it doesn't really feel like the actual Main story starts until like the last third or quarter of this volume.

398
00:29:05,231 --> 00:29:06,598
Rym: Well, this volume has three parts.

399
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:15,450
Rym: part one follows Jomi Marcus Shin the nominal main character through everything that happens to him his interactions with soldier blue and Pfizer's and it's good.

400
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:22,930
Rym: Part two kind of starts the story over in that it gives the history and everything just like the first part did.

401
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:23,773
Scott: Well, you got it.

402
00:29:23,874 --> 00:29:27,930
Scott: I think the reason that's there is because it was originally published serially in some anthology.

403
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,205
Scott: Yes, so you had to retell that bit.

404
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:37,790
Rym: but also It doesn't even talk about Jomi or any of these people and it focuses on Keith onion and all the people around him.

405
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:48,636
Rym: These are people who are a part of this system Very much the system that you didn't know much about but was hinted at in the first part and you see this whole thing again From an entirely different perspective.

406
00:29:48,997 --> 00:30:04,708
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like here's something going on in this part of the universe you know in this period of time and here's something going on in a different part of the universe around the same period of time and Then of course as in everything that does this the two things collide.

407
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:05,130
Scott: OMG

408
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:22,110
Rym: Yes now I very much enjoyed the second part a lot more than the first part partly because now it's a much more clinical look at how the society actually works and Kind of the veil is pulled off from your eyes and now you see everything at least everything as far as the main character can.

409
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:33,430
Scott: Yeah, see I did like the second bit more than the first bit But I felt like there was this potential of greater liking for this through the plot that was going on in the first bit.

410
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,848
Scott: It just stopped advancing when it was gonna get to where I wanted it to be.

411
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:50,229
Rym: Well, I'm sure and maybe volume 2 it's gonna get there and that's the part I'm really gonna like the second bit which really lets you see kind of the inside of how the society works Reminds me so much that it's almost painful of the paranoia role-playing game.

412
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:59,390
Rym: I would say that the the society that has been created here without ruining much is almost exactly in the spirit of paranoia.

413
00:31:00,213 --> 00:31:05,830
Rym: It doesn't have the same silliness that paranoia doesn't have the silliness depending on how you play.

414
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,596
Rym: There are different ways to game.

415
00:31:07,636 --> 00:31:08,238
Rym: that that's true.

416
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:14,061
Scott: And while the system is not as complex as the system in paranoia It is definitely reminiscent.

417
00:31:14,202 --> 00:31:15,891
Rym: I think it is as complex inter I mean.

418
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:26,090
Rym: they talk a lot about not fraternizing with people in different levels and there's the elites and Then there's the elite elites and there's the members and society is stratified and it's exactly like I mean paranoia.

419
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:35,969
Rym: The game breaks up into three levels of I guess Cerebral ness when you play and this reads exactly like a game of the highest most serious level of paranoia would be.

420
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:47,583
Scott: Perhaps perhaps it's definitely very similar And I wonder if the tell the guy who wrote paranoia ever read this as opposed to the first part Which in a few ways almost reminds me of Battlestar Galactica.

421
00:31:48,305 --> 00:31:49,410
Rym: I don't know about that.

422
00:31:49,872 --> 00:31:52,442
Scott: I definitely feel like it's more of an x-men kind of thing.

423
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,430
Rym: What's the plot of Battlestar Galactica?

424
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:56,838
Scott: You're in space.

425
00:31:57,322 --> 00:31:58,450
Scott: Some people are evil.

426
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:01,467
Scott: You have to teleport every so minutes.

427
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:05,961
Rym: All right Never mind that that's not the the relevant.

428
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:07,766
Scott: No, but think you see how it goes with x-men.

429
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:08,548
Scott: is that x-men?

430
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:09,110
Scott: there are mutants?

431
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:11,872
Scott: who are cast out of society and You know.

432
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:15,662
Scott: next men like what most of times people tell the story of the x-men.

433
00:32:15,682 --> 00:32:18,610
Scott: they concentrated one character like kitty pride or something.

434
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,264
Scott: they show someone who's a normal person and they're you know living with their parents.

435
00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:29,230
Scott: and then all of a sudden they find out they're A mutant and their parents cast them out and then they run away and then they find refuge with the x-men.

436
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:32,129
Rym: Oh, I'm not disagreeing that x-men is also very much like this.

437
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:34,136
Rym: But look at there's two things going on.

438
00:32:34,297 --> 00:32:38,530
Rym: on one hand this first bit with Jomi is very much the x-men thing of people who?

439
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,766
Rym: Are different or cast out because they're different and normal people are afraid of them.

440
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:42,168
Rym: Mm-hmm.

441
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:57,606
Rym: but at the same time there's this whole idea that I think is going to be a lot more important later the Journey home trying to find your origin trying to get a group of displaced people Through the desert for 40 days and find home or paradise or whatever.

442
00:32:57,646 --> 00:33:00,877
Rym: while this first part That is the true plot of Battlestar Galactica.

443
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:09,449
Scott: while this first part of the first volume is a lot like x-men I definitely feel like it drops the x-men as soon as that first part is over and it goes into.

444
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:11,776
Scott: you know The rest of the story which is completely different.

445
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:25,015
Rym: now an ishi that that woman who is the public the PR person for this Says that to Tara was largely influenced by quote Japan student movements of the 1960s when college campuses became hotbeds of political unrest.

446
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:36,138
Scott: huh, I wonder what sort of Political thing like ties this has because they don't know enough details about Japanese Politics to find any correlations between this and that.

447
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,943
Rym: and also apparently the.

448
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:43,746
Rym: the writer was very much a fan of Osamu Tezuka and she was influenced greatly by him.

449
00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:47,130
Scott: that was Painfully obvious just by looking at it.

450
00:33:47,210 --> 00:34:04,814
Scott: yeah, it's actually really cool to look at this manga because I like Tezuka manga, and I like modern manga and You don't really ever get to see how manga got like it's like you know that modern manga that you read today like Death Note or one piece or Naruto is influenced by Osamu Tezuka.

451
00:34:05,034 --> 00:34:10,474
Scott: all manga and anime is influenced by Osamu Tezuka the same way that all like Animation in the u.s.

452
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:13,304
Scott: Is influenced by Disney because Tezuka was influenced by Disney.

453
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:14,389
Scott: so I mean come on.

454
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:18,326
Scott: But we see the modern manga, and we see the Tezuka manga.

455
00:34:18,346 --> 00:34:23,150
Scott: just because he's Tezuka We get to see his stuff, but you don't really get to see how it goes in between.

456
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:31,112
Scott: It's sort of like if someone told you that you know there are monkeys And there are people and they never showed you the any of the in-between monkeys Which we have seen.

457
00:34:31,254 --> 00:34:39,469
Scott: and evolution is real, but with manga like I knew there was an evolution of manga But I never got to see the missing links, and this is one of those missing links.

458
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,270
Scott: It's so half shoujo II style art and half Tezuka art.

459
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:50,330
Scott: And it has elements a lot of elements of Tezuka storytelling and elements of modern manga storytelling, and it's together.

460
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:57,069
Scott: yeah, and it's really cool because Manga from this era that I assume must be similar is not published in English.

461
00:34:57,169 --> 00:34:58,437
Scott: often This might be the first time

462
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:16,030
Rym: and even if you haven't read a lot of manga Don't worry about picking up something like this because while it's old it Reads a lot like modern manga and you won't have trouble following it for the most part other than there's a few times where it's Hard to tell who's speaking, but that's more just a function of how the art is done, and how the speech bubbles are drawn.

463
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:30,662
Scott: Yeah, you know actually now that I think about it This could be not you know because it's a great work on its own But it might be a very useful work of all the people who like Modern manga, and they refuse to read anything that looks old or might be old.

464
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:42,070
Scott: you could give them this and they could enjoy it You know because of the way it is a modern manga But you could use it as a bridge to pull them over to the other side and get them to read the older good stuff.

465
00:35:42,572 --> 00:35:44,500
Scott: You know that they are now that if they looked at now.

466
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,630
Scott: They would be unwilling to read now.

467
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:59,902
Rym: I believe it's worth mentioning that there was a movie adaptation of this made in I believe uh-huh, I don't know anything about it and I don't even know who the director is Hideo onchi.

468
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:01,850
Rym: There's nothing on the anime news network encyclopedia.

469
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:04,439
Rym: I didn't feel like doing any further research.

470
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,410
Scott: I highly doubt this movie is available in English anywhere.

471
00:36:07,871 --> 00:36:12,103
Rym: It looks like it was released in the u.s.. On VHS in the 90s really.

472
00:36:12,123 --> 00:36:13,207
Scott: That's a VHS.

473
00:36:13,247 --> 00:36:13,828
Scott: I gotta get.

474
00:36:13,848 --> 00:36:17,358
Scott: yeah I'm not looking at for that at the anime cons and the dollar bins.

475
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:20,086
Rym: more importantly toward the Terra.

476
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:24,116
Rym: a TV show is Debuting very soon.

477
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:26,063
Scott: Yes in like in a few months.

478
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:41,590
Scott: You're gonna see a few months now According to this April 7th so on April 7th like I guess the week after that because depending on how fast they fans of it You're probably gonna see to Tara episode 1 on the bit Torrance with subtitles in English.

479
00:36:42,051 --> 00:36:47,310
Scott: That's pretty freaking awesome a brand new anime series with modern animation, and it's gonna be way cool.

480
00:36:47,692 --> 00:36:49,647
Scott: We should link to the Japanese website for that.

481
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:54,203
Rym: well There's a picture here on the anime news network about it and the character designs.

482
00:36:54,925 --> 00:36:56,570
Rym: It's hard to say without seeing the move.

483
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:03,624
Rym: I'm not sure it looks like they're gonna take a somewhat interesting take on Translating these character designs into animation.

484
00:37:04,126 --> 00:37:12,030
Rym: I do think they're pretty though They remind me a tiny bit of duo say uh a tiny bit, but not they definitely have the old leaning still there.

485
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,513
Scott: Yeah, I haven't seen enough of them But I they.

486
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:19,350
Scott: I think they remind me a little bit from what I remember of like all the of the stars.

487
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,590
Scott: Is you know like the crests of the stars and the banners of the stars?

488
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,101
Rym: Yeah, I don't know how much of those have you seen?

489
00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:27,165
Scott: barely any cuz.

490
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:31,848
Scott: I saw about half of Christ But I seen barely of that and I've seen barely of screenshots from this.

491
00:37:31,948 --> 00:37:34,018
Scott: so That's what I'm going on.

492
00:37:34,581 --> 00:37:36,429
Rym: and now what else can we say?

493
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:38,634
Scott: It's an awesome manga.

494
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:39,938
Scott: You should buy it.

495
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:45,111
Scott: you can get this manga on Amazon for 12 less than $12.

496
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:49,529
Scott: all right, it's like twice the size of a regular manga.

497
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:54,426
Rym: yes It is quite hefty and there are only going to be three volumes, so you're not.

498
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:57,619
Rym: even if you don't like it It's not like you're committed to something huge.

499
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,557
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you buy it, and you don't like it You don't have to buy two and three.

500
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:06,870
Scott: no one's making you and if you do like it You can get the ending of this thing in two more volumes.

501
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:13,936
Scott: You can have a whole manga series without having to buy a hundred volumes of something you know even like Death Note is like 12 Or 13 volumes.

502
00:38:14,198 --> 00:38:17,989
Scott: This is just three and on Amazon They're eleven dollars and sixteen cents.

503
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:22,545
Scott: So you if you like it you have no excuse not to buy the whole thing and read the whole thing.

504
00:38:22,946 --> 00:38:30,888
Scott: the next volume The current volume the first volume came out in February the next volume will be out in April and the final volume It'll be out in June.

505
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:39,043
Scott: so if you're the kind of person doesn't like to wait in June just go out and buy all three at once and You probably won't have a problem if you buy them on Amazon.

506
00:38:39,344 --> 00:38:46,809
Scott: if you try to find them in the store You might have a little bit of trouble But I've actually seen these around so it might not be as hard as you think to find them.
