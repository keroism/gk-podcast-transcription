1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,980
Scott: It's Monday February 5th, I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:18,839
Scott: Tonight we discuss the IT professionals toolbox.

3
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:22,157
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,549
Rym: You know, we were actually somewhat productive this weekend.

5
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:28,460
Scott: We were productive this weekend, but now I'm all.

6
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:31,547
Rym: How come we got plenty of sleep?

7
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:33,093
Rym: Well, you got plenty of sleep last night.

8
00:00:33,153 --> 00:00:39,660
Scott: I stayed up playing civilization - again I did but I ate very off schedule today, which kind of messed me up.

9
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:45,246
Scott: And also I you know, I got this tough job switching situation Trouble to go through.

10
00:00:45,447 --> 00:00:46,392
Scott: as soon as that's all over.

11
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:46,995
Scott: I'll be all set.

12
00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:48,221
Rym: Uh-huh Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:54,316
Rym: Yeah, but we did a lot of work on the DVD which will be coming out sooner than you might expect But not as soon as you might hope.

14
00:00:55,662 --> 00:00:56,426
Rym: Yeah, more importantly.

15
00:00:56,446 --> 00:01:02,310
Rym: We also finally have decided to make some promo CDs Which you'll only be able to get if you come to katsu-kan.

16
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:08,028
Scott: Yes, there'll be katsu-kan exclusive promotional CDs So if you come to katsu-kan you get one.

17
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,460
Scott: if you don't come to katsu-kan, you don't get one.

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,145
Rym: Well, they are technically exclusive.

19
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:12,928
Rym: That is correct.

20
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:13,670
Rym: It is not a lie.

21
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,760
Scott: And we're gonna do that at every convention for now on probably.

22
00:01:17,204 --> 00:01:27,359
Rym: Yeah, I mean it doesn't take as much effort Basically, we just record an opening bit and then we stick a random episode of GeekNights on after it And then we got to burn a whole mess of CDs.

23
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:30,420
Rym: Yes, and let's take stock of the burners we have in this house.

24
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:37,040
Rym: We have my plex tor 820 scuzzy from before CD RW's were commonly available.

25
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,069
Rym: That doesn't even work properly anymore.

26
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,194
Scott: It's so useless.

27
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:41,420
Scott: It effectively doesn't count.

28
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,805
Rym: I can't make it work in Linux.

29
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:44,832
Rym: that scuzzy card is just too busted and old.

30
00:01:45,394 --> 00:01:46,900
Scott: I met you could it just be hard?

31
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:47,804
Scott: It wouldn't be worth it.

32
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:48,326
Rym: I couldn't.

33
00:01:48,386 --> 00:01:49,310
Rym: with the token effort.

34
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:50,315
Rym: I was willing to put forth.

35
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:51,400
Scott: I said wouldn't be easy.

36
00:01:51,802 --> 00:01:55,159
Scott: We've got a plex tor 8 for 32, which is my first burner.

37
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,503
Scott: I paid $150 for it in 1999 or 2000.

38
00:01:56,503 --> 00:02:05,648
Scott: I forget probably 99 and Yeah It's it's not in a computer.

39
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:06,331
Scott: I've got it.

40
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:08,600
Scott: See I got this thing I bought which is pretty handy.

41
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,068
Scott: We're actually gonna talk about this today in our in our episode.

42
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:21,960
Scott: It allows you to take any IDE drive that you have be it a CD ROM or a hard drive or anything and Turn it into a USB drive.

43
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:30,675
Scott: So we have the CD burner attached to a $20 crap computer With this device and it's effectively an external CD ROM.

44
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:34,409
Rym: after we finish the show I'm going to attempt to actually burn something over this link.

45
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:35,313
Rym: I imagine it'll work.

46
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:35,754
Rym: It did.

47
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:36,658
Scott: I tested it yesterday.

48
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:36,959
Scott: It worked.

49
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:40,030
Rym: Yeah, well, we'll see if it works on the $20 motherboard.

50
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:41,595
Scott: That's a good question.

51
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:44,428
Scott: I did test it with a Windows and Nero.

52
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:46,380
Rym: see normally I wouldn't be Larry at all.

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,272
Rym: I mean a motherboards a motherboard but this goddamn motherboard 20 bucks to get what you pay for you got exactly that.

54
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:52,795
Scott: it works.

55
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:54,060
Rym: We're lucky it works.

56
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,183
Rym: It didn't work at first.

57
00:02:55,223 --> 00:03:00,891
Scott: anyone out there who's poor in the poor house and you are willing to suffer with a computer that kind of works.

58
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:04,458
Scott: $20 motherboards the way to go All right.

59
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:05,663
Scott: What else?

60
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:07,490
Scott: Oh, I've got a burner in my computer.

61
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:07,992
Scott: That's a very.

62
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:09,760
Scott: it's a relatively new Plex store.

63
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:16,120
Scott: The thing is I bought it and I was like who is my first DVD burner, but I never had to burn a DVD with it.

64
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,272
Scott: I just bought a DVD burner and I burned many CDs with it and work just fine.

65
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:25,467
Scott: and about many months after buying it I tried to burn a DVD and it didn't work.

66
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:27,775
Scott: It's the only unreliable Plex store.

67
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:33,232
Scott: I've ever seen in my entire life And I could that flex stores have a really good warranty.

68
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,520
Scott: I'm just too lazy to send it in to get it fixed.

69
00:03:35,642 --> 00:03:36,859
Scott: So it's just a CD burner.

70
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:46,209
Rym: Last and least we bought a brand new light scribe DVD drive to make people a $30 light on CD-burner and it works amazingly.

71
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,096
Scott: Yeah compared to the hundreds of dollars.

72
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:49,662
Scott: I paid for that flex store That doesn't work.

73
00:03:49,723 --> 00:03:50,185
Rym: The thing is.

74
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:53,780
Rym: back in the day a Plex store was the gold standard.

75
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,651
Rym: I mean you guys might not remember kinda is.

76
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:58,017
Rym: it doesn't matter anymore at all.

77
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,845
Scott: It doesn't matter though I wouldn't buy one anymore.

78
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,400
Rym: So it's not really the gold standard because silver works just fine.

79
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,243
Rym: So don't even bother.

80
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,773
Scott: if I was a super professional I would buy one.

81
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,520
Rym: I wouldn't there's no reason to uh.

82
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:14,740
Rym: But yeah back in the day way back For some of you might be too young to remember that CD burners didn't work.

83
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:20,539
Scott: Yeah, you would buy a burner and the more money you spent the less often it would screw up.

84
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:26,463
Scott: It's like you would buy a $50 burner All right But oh it's only gonna actually work 30% of the time.

85
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:33,658
Rym: you'd have to decide based on how much CDs cost and how much your time is worth how expensive a burner You're going to buy and how many?

86
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:43,560
Rym: Coasters were willing to put up with and the thing was the only burner that could work all the time Was the Plex store and the Plex store cost a lot more money than anything else.

87
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:49,639
Scott: That's why I paid a total of probably more than three hundred dollars for two Plex stores and Rym has one, too Yep.

88
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:57,913
Rym: And I went above and beyond because I decided I would like to be able to burn things while I do other things on my computer Which back then you really couldn't do even with a Plex store.

89
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:02,100
Rym: if your computer didn't have a lot of RAM Which most computers didn't you couldn't play quake?

90
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,680
Rym: You couldn't have more than one or two ie windows open.

91
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,002
Rym: It would just mess up your CD or with the Plex store would be all fancy and slow down the burn so it wouldn't mess Up.

92
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:13,300
Scott: Yeah, it depends on which Plex store you had.

93
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:15,300
Scott: They added more technology to them over the years.

94
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:21,820
Rym: So I being a fancy lad who knew a little bit of our computers a little bit I decided that scuzzy was the way to go.

95
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:28,987
Rym: So I got a scuzzy card and a scuzzy burner and let me tell you I could burn CDs at 8x While I played quake.

96
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:29,911
Scott: that was good.

97
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,679
Rym: I was very pleased with that.

98
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:36,834
Scott: Yeah, yeah, oh well nowadays it doesn't matter just get a burner for 30 bucks.

99
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:37,837
Scott: they all work perfectly.

100
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:38,880
Scott: they burn everything.

101
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:41,419
Scott: It's like dual layer is not even a big deal anymore.

102
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:42,926
Scott: You just burn whatever you want.

103
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:48,397
Scott: the big deal in the future is gonna be the HD DVD and the blu-ray burners Which I don't really care so much.

104
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:50,980
Scott: Well, I'd like one read them even if you make them.

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,276
Rym: I'd really like to have something like that just to back up GeekNights considering.

106
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:54,538
Rym: Yep.

107
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:57,828
Rym: I agree Considering that GeekNights won't fit on anything.

108
00:05:57,868 --> 00:06:01,620
Rym: We have other than a hard drive or a veritable pile of DVDs.

109
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:09,077
Scott: Yes, however Distributing I mean if we distributed data blu-ray discs or data HD HD DVD discs.

110
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:09,960
Scott: No one could use them.

111
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,599
Scott: That's why we have to put out a DVD set.

112
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,965
Rym: Yeah, but internally if I could buy for a reasonable price an HD DVD or a blu-ray burner I probably would.

113
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,694
Scott: yeah that the price is gonna go down.

114
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:20,780
Scott: I'm gonna start looking into it.

115
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,763
Scott: Here's the problem.

116
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:23,088
Scott: in six to twelve months.

117
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:26,500
Scott: You'll be able to get them for less than $200, but here's the problem.

118
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,960
Rym: There are other formats on the horizon already that are so much better.

119
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:39,780
Rym: There's really no real like the technology is moving so fast that Moving to blu-ray and HD DVD doesn't seem like it even really matters because the next generation is gonna be even better.

120
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:47,260
Scott: also, you always have to count in the Price of you know getting a NAS with a raid 5 and a whole bunch of hard drives or something like that.

121
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:58,059
Rym: Yeah, those aren't always the best option because those let you have live backups But they don't really let you unless you really want to be fancy have the you know Definitive back.

122
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,080
Rym: You know more for enterprise stuff than us.

123
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,979
Rym: But say you want to back up a file regularly as opposed to just having a backup of the most current file.

124
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,347
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I know what you're saying.

125
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,870
Rym: All right.

126
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:07,595
Rym: It's not a thing.

127
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:11,168
Rym: Most people care about Nope in the news now.

128
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:16,748
Rym: This shouldn't really be news to anyone out there, but the AP wire had a story I'm looking to it on the Guardian, but it doesn't really matter.

129
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,775
Rym: No one's writing checks anymore.

130
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:21,467
Scott: Oh Gee, that's a big surprise.

131
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,291
Scott: I haven't written a check.

132
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:23,577
Scott: I don't write checks other than for rent.

133
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:24,280
Scott: Oh, we gotta pay rent.

134
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:25,524
Rym: You have to pay rent.

135
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:26,547
Scott: Oh, it's the fifth.

136
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:26,928
Scott: I'll pay it.

137
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:30,700
Rym: Yeah, okay, but no checks really aren't being used anymore.

138
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:40,200
Rym: Checks are being used primarily by very old people The primary uses of checks now seem to be nothing more than paying a few utilities.

139
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:44,140
Rym: But even then a lot of people are doing it online or through their bank or through other services.

140
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:53,935
Scott: I pay absolutely every bill and do all of my money management via ATMs the Internet and the only thing I have to do with the check is rent.

141
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:55,180
Scott: nothing else requires a check.

142
00:07:55,441 --> 00:08:09,500
Rym: Well even better most people old people especially who use checks on a regular basis for you know Grocery store transactions and whatnot are paying their bills don't seem to realize that checks don't really float anymore And they're not processed mechanically anymore.

143
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:14,980
Rym: Usually they're converted into an electronic format and then build just like a direct checking thing.

144
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:26,500
Rym: Yep, and this is really starting to screw a lot of old people who are used to the fact that if you write a check It won't actually hit your account for another several days, so you can kind of float money and live on the edge.

145
00:08:27,323 --> 00:08:28,839
Scott: Yeah, I never even thought about that.

146
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:41,291
Scott: You know I've always got actually been kind of pissed when I used to write checks way back in the day before I had you Know any other possible way of paying for certain things like I would buy stuff on the internet And then mail a check and then get the stuff.

147
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:43,260
Rym: Wow see luckily my was a long time.

148
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:53,850
Scott: My parents got me a credit card when I was 16, so I've just pretty much always had a credit card Yeah, but no when I used to do that I was kind of pissed that it took so long like I wanted.

149
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:57,000
Scott: the second that you know the check was brought to the bank.

150
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,860
Scott: I wanted that to be registered so I could go online and see that the money was taken out.

151
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:02,848
Scott: And if it took three days, I was kind of pissed.

152
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:05,819
Scott: so the fact that it's quicker now is better for me.

153
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:09,439
Rym: Yeah, I definitely never floated checks usually because I didn't want to risk it.

154
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:14,035
Rym: I mean I had a bank that if you overdrafted they gave you like a $40 per day fee.

155
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:21,519
Scott: Oh Yeah, yeah, I just think checks are kind of silly and outdated, and we should stop using them all together.

156
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,147
Rym: well No, they're still used for a lot of things.

157
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,760
Rym: I mean large purchases are often done with cashiers checks.

158
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,900
Scott: I'm talking about personal checks only obviously cashiers checks and money orders and all those sorts of personal checks.

159
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,959
Scott: Oh, you don't have a place a lot for charity donations.

160
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:41,849
Rym: If you give money to a charity you want to give it in a verifiable way And checks are the easiest and best way to do that.

161
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,647
Rym: plus most charities aren't equipped to take credit cards Then your charity sucks.

162
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:47,109
Rym: Well.

163
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,520
Scott: No because the charity can take PayPal or something.

164
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:52,712
Rym: No, because PayPal and credit cards have one major thing in common.

165
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,097
Rym: They skim off the top.

166
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:54,800
Scott: that is true.

167
00:09:55,101 --> 00:10:05,036
Scott: However, I think there really needs to be some sort of law that says if someone is a legitimate charity that you can't skim off The top when they take credit card donations and such because that's actually a pretty annoying problem.

168
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:14,698
Scott: a charity will get like $10,000 of donations from people and only get like $8,000 because the credit card company charges of money, and it's really annoying.

169
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:19,925
Rym: yeah Maybe some credit card companies do that or maybe there's some loopholes We don't know about.

170
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:20,630
Rym: maybe there's.

171
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,958
Scott: all I'm saying is if it's not true It should be true.

172
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:32,695
Scott: No If I donate five dollars to a charity with a credit card on PayPal The charity should get the entirety of that five dollars and PayPal and the credit card company get nothing.

173
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:42,886
Rym: now what I what I actually Get from this news is that it must be a slow news day because the AP wire is running this and this article doesn't really have Anything of note in it.

174
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:48,140
Scott: I mean everything I said like a recent occurrence to trigger this news not something that's old.

175
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:48,842
Scott: It's usually.

176
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:49,424
Scott: that's what happened.

177
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:50,247
Rym: No nothing's happened.

178
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:56,628
Rym: in fact a lot of the data in this article is from 2003 Oh, but the article was posted today.

179
00:10:56,648 --> 00:10:58,234
Rym: You've said oh, I like ten times today.

180
00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:00,020
Scott: Yeah, I guess cuz my stomach is I?

181
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,606
Scott: Okay, okay, I told you I ate lunch when I got home from work at 4 and then ate I don't know my stomach hurts.

182
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:08,396
Rym: They don't say oh, I say it doesn't hurt.

183
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:09,039
Scott: It's just kind of.

184
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:13,250
Rym: I'm not saying that you're saying stuff, but I'm pointing out specifically that you're saying.

185
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:13,772
Rym: Oh, hey.

186
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:18,770
Scott: Oh, hey, oh What the dyslexic rabbi say?

187
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:20,097
Rym: what did he say?

188
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:20,479
Scott: yo?

189
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:23,688
Rym: All right, but yeah this article.

190
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:40,965
Rym: the only interesting thing here, and it surprises me Immensely that apparently the part of the government that handles processing checks on a national level you know through the Federal Reserve and all that is cutting back on all of the Offices that do that.

191
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:41,788
Scott: wait a minute.

192
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:45,240
Scott: Did you just say a government agency is cutting back the government?

193
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:48,148
Scott: Someone's here at the door.

194
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:48,895
Scott: Let me go see who it is.

195
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:51,704
Rym: Alright, whatever.

196
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,467
Rym: You're doing is lame.

197
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:54,175
Scott: Just made sure it's Satan.

198
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:55,340
Scott: He needs a he needs a winter coat.

199
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:57,506
Rym: Yeah, that was really late.

200
00:11:57,526 --> 00:11:59,313
Rym: is that that was absolutely?

201
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:01,000
Rym: oh my god you say.

202
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:16,271
Rym: But yeah, the government is actually shutting down a lot of these processing centers and by 2008 18 of the 45 that exists now Will remain Awesome, well, maybe even though You know the credit cards are skimming off the top.

203
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:23,500
Scott: Maybe I'll get some tax money back is not Because I'm not paying for all those people that handle all these checks.

204
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:34,203
Rym: I have a feeling that for every dollar We're saving from this there's something going on in certain parts of sand coated areas of the world that might be preventing us from getting Any money back.

205
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:36,129
Scott: yeah, that's you know surprisingly.

206
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:38,759
Scott: That's not the biggest money sink, but it is pretty sucky.

207
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:45,470
Rym: Well, it is because a lot of those graphs you look at and you point out a lot about you know Oh look how much Social Security and all those take.

208
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,780
Scott: yeah, well those Social Security is sort of outside of the budget.

209
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,837
Rym: It's a different thing entirely yeah, but those graphs aren't the best.

210
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:56,460
Scott: no It's still because the problem is no one really knows because the budget is just so big and complicated.

211
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:00,744
Scott: I mean didn't like Bush just submit a budget to Congress that was like well No, it's not point.

212
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:03,120
Scott: six trillion dollars people know very much.

213
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:12,920
Rym: It's just the issue of it's very easy to make a graph Regarding the budget and percentages or gross amounts to prove whatever you want to prove about the government being efficient or inefficient or whatever.

214
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:15,009
Scott: Yep, that's true all right.

215
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:16,113
Scott: so my news.

216
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:17,700
Scott: You know the electric slide.

217
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:22,163
Rym: Yeah, it's a generally mediocre dance Dance move.

218
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:26,756
Rym: from before I was cognizant of the fact that dancing existed in the world.

219
00:13:27,177 --> 00:13:29,760
Scott: you gotta be It's electric.

220
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:39,129
Rym: I remember in fifth grade our teacher for whatever reason taught us the hustle the electric slide and Something else and that's good for you.

221
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,811
Scott: in second grade.

222
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:42,080
Scott: They taught a square dancing even better.

223
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:46,255
Rym: I remember it science Olympiad at the regional tournament right.

224
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:47,720
Rym: they taught us this dance.

225
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,800
Rym: They called it the Mexican hustle, and you know we all thought it was cool.

226
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:59,598
Rym: We all did it and years and years later that Macarena Craze that went across the United States part of that craze were you?

227
00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:00,583
Scott: yes I was.

228
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:02,472
Scott: I have a Macarena mix CD.

229
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:03,900
Scott: It has like 16 Macarena's.

230
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:09,220
Rym: No, I vaguely remember you telling me that I think I'd blocked it out of my mind like in Phoenix right with those chains.

231
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:10,926
Scott: I got it for free from Columbia's.

232
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,050
Scott: I didn't pay for it.

233
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:13,476
Rym: Did you choose it however?

234
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:19,191
Rym: Yes, no no I gotta ask because For this one case despite the fact that I'm a geek.

235
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:21,360
Rym: I think I was ahead of the pop-culture curve.

236
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,386
Rym: I learned the Macarena.

237
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:30,609
Rym: did the Macarena love the Macarena got sick of the Macarena and decided it was stupid before the Macarena even existed.

238
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:39,576
Scott: and It hit me like I got in right at the beginning like a week before it was on the television, and then I got out two months later.

239
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,009
Scott: The thing is that was the period of my life like I was around 13 years old.

240
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,850
Scott: ish All right, so they're like a million bar mitzvahs to go to and you danced it at every single one.

241
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:52,330
Rym: I see there's nothing like that in white bread suburban culture.

242
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:55,889
Rym: The only time I ever went dancing is when some friend of the family got married.

243
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:59,881
Scott: Okay, so anyway the electric slide.

244
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:07,244
Scott: some guy Kyle Matulius right whatever he's a. he's an engineer at Linden lab.

245
00:15:07,344 --> 00:15:08,830
Scott: Oh, maybe he's an engineer at Second Life.

246
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:18,310
Scott: Anyway, he received a DMCA takedown notice about a video Daddy shot at a convention showing three people doing the electric slide.

247
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:28,062
Scott: apparently some guy copyrighted the electric slide and He's sending DMCA takedown notices to every person on YouTube with the electric.

248
00:15:28,123 --> 00:15:28,745
Scott: wait a minute now.

249
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:30,490
Rym: specifically he copyrighted it.

250
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:31,902
Rym: It says copyright not patent.

251
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:39,670
Scott: yep You can copyright the choreography for dances and then enforce the copyright against anyone who publicly publicly performs the dance.

252
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,429
Scott: So says Jason Schultz attorney for the EFF.

253
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:52,130
Rym: What I would point out to the world in this issue here Is that according to copyright statute unless it's different specifically for choreography?

254
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,570
Rym: Once you create something or do something it's automatically copyrighted.

255
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:00,981
Scott: Yeah, and other radically is illegal to move.

256
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,630
Scott: I could interpret no because that would have expired already.

257
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:04,148
Scott: Okay

258
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:13,590
Rym: However, it is illegal to do what I'm doing right now because I know no one has ever done this before In the exact way that I'm doing it and if anyone does this I'm suing your ass

259
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:18,530
Scott: Yeah, and the other thing is this guy also made some complaints about people doing the dance poorly.

260
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:25,448
Scott: Well, if they're doing it poorly, they're not doing it the exact same way that you've copyrighted doing Yeah, that's a slightly modified it.

261
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,170
Scott: Well, no because they're not allowed to remix the dance.

262
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:32,630
Scott: But if you do that, how do you know that jumping up and down and just you know?

263
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,840
Scott: Waving your hand isn't a remix of the electric.

264
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,930
Rym: are you sure this isn't some sort of fake news?

265
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,897
Scott: This is definitely a real news.

266
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:42,630
Scott: It's on CNET and it's from a staff writer at CNET.

267
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:49,168
Scott: Wow, and a lot of people are even sued some daytime talk show the Ellen DeGeneres show.

268
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:49,710
Rym: Did he win?

269
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:50,532
Scott: I don't know.

270
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,235
Scott: He's trying.

271
00:16:51,617 --> 00:16:52,763
Scott: he's basically saying wait a minute.

272
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:53,104
Rym: Wait a minute.

273
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,250
Rym: Has he won a single lawsuit?

274
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,961
Scott: No, all he's doing is sending DMCA takedown notices, right?

275
00:16:58,081 --> 00:16:58,844
Rym: Oh, that's nothing.

276
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:07,290
Rym: Yeah, I mean as far as I'm concerned There's so many stories on FARC, you know Someone's suing someone over blah and the fact of the matter is you can sue anyone for anything at any time.

277
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:09,640
Rym: The real question is is he going to win?

278
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,429
Rym: and I don't know but I'm gonna bet.

279
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:11,569
Rym: no.

280
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:16,805
Scott: Anyway, he's sending out the DMCA takedown notices and we'll see what comes of that.

281
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:18,270
Scott: You know, it's it's nothing.

282
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,866
Scott: Yeah, the thing is you can copyright a dance, which is kind of interesting.

283
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:22,810
Scott: I didn't realize you could do that.

284
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:27,069
Rym: Well, we'd better copyright the dance that we do for the mamalayo.

285
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:36,348
Scott: Maybe we should yeah, and then anyone who puts videos of it on YouTube is gonna get fun Unless the original creator of the dance finds out.

286
00:17:36,842 --> 00:17:45,866
Scott: Yeah The thing that bothers me is it says here Richard silver filed the copyright for electric slide in 2004. the electric slide was created in 76.

287
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:46,409
Scott: What the hell?

288
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:47,511
Rym: Huh?

289
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:48,757
Rym: Something doesn't add up.

290
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:49,943
Scott: How does that work?

291
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:50,566
Rym: I got a question.

292
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:51,410
Rym: How old is this guy?

293
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,679
Rym: I have no idea because if he didn't create it and he just filed the copyright Then it's bullshit.

294
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,283
Scott: Supposedly.

295
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,007
Scott: He's the creator.

296
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:04,390
Scott: That's what it Supposedly and I mean the only place I've seen it actually say he was the creator.

297
00:18:04,731 --> 00:18:08,443
Scott: It said the quote creator of the electric slide.

298
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:10,650
Rym: Let's try to track him down and talk to him.

299
00:18:11,752 --> 00:18:13,482
Scott: All right, it's all you go for it.

300
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:13,964
Scott: All right.

301
00:18:13,984 --> 00:18:14,990
Scott: I think it'll be hilarious.

302
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:16,980
Rym: I'd like to talk to this guy if nothing else.

303
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:24,350
Rym: I wish the internet would send him DVD upon DVD of videos of themselves doing the electric slide and or other dances.

304
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:29,782
Scott: We should Do the electric slide like everywhere instead of walking.

305
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:31,550
Rym: that might be a little difficult.

306
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:33,800
Rym: I mean we used to skip all over the place.

307
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,190
Scott: I actually kind of forget how to do the electric slide.

308
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,295
Scott: I mean, I remember some parts.

309
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:41,796
Scott: you slide clap and turn to the side Alright, whatever.

310
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:43,184
Rym: I remember the Macarena better.

311
00:18:43,204 --> 00:18:49,354
Scott: Yeah, I do God You know, it's.

312
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:53,228
Scott: I think it's time for a new dance craze, yeah, you know what the the hurry.

313
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:55,936
Scott: That's a Japanese dance craze.

314
00:18:55,997 --> 00:18:57,704
Scott: I think it's time for another American dance.

315
00:18:57,824 --> 00:18:59,190
Rym: I don't think it can happen anymore.

316
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:04,230
Rym: I mean most dance clubs these days tend to play like house crap at least the ones around here.

317
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,378
Scott: No, the thing is the dance craze is like the Macarena.

318
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:07,402
Scott: We're never in clubs.

319
00:19:07,724 --> 00:19:09,310
Scott: It's all about weddings and bar mitzvahs.

320
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,334
Rym: Yeah, you know what like that?

321
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:11,418
Rym: weddings and bar mitzvahs?

322
00:19:11,478 --> 00:19:12,401
Rym: now don't see.

323
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:14,730
Rym: I mean the last wedding I went to the only silly dance.

324
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,946
Rym: They did it all other than you know, the hustle which gets played ever.

325
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:18,730
Scott: We got the chicken dance.

326
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,876
Scott: We got the hustle we get the like.

327
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:20,419
Scott: here's the slide.

328
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,364
Scott: We got the Macarena.

329
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:22,370
Scott: We got that cotton.

330
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,040
Rym: Here's the thing they did cotton-eyed Joe right?

331
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:25,884
Rym: I remember this.

332
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:27,270
Rym: at the last two weddings I went to.

333
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:29,199
Rym: No one knew how to actually dance it.

334
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:29,862
Rym: They just danced.

335
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:31,228
Rym: Ah played the hustle.

336
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:34,270
Rym: No one knew how to do the hustle.

337
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,822
Rym: My mom knows how to do the but no one at this wedding did the.

338
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:39,897
Scott: I've always wanted to learn how to do the hustle But I learned it when I was a kid.

339
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,003
Scott: I know I keep forgetting.

340
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:42,189
Rym: I remember about half of it.

341
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:44,010
Scott: We should get a video that tells us how to do it.

342
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,947
Rym: I'm sure there is one probably on YouTube probably violating the copyright of the guy who created it.

343
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:55,590
Rym: Ooh Yeah, all right, yeah you people out there wonder why we're always so pissed off about copyright laws because things like this happen.

344
00:19:56,112 --> 00:20:00,710
Rym: I mean, it's one thing to argue that artists should get credit for their work and compensation or whatever.

345
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:05,589
Rym: But when something like this happens, that's that's another straw on this camel's back.

346
00:20:06,951 --> 00:20:08,561
Scott: Hamels backs been broken for a long time.

347
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:22,720
Rym: So I got new camel two humps Things of the day and I gotta say I'm throwing down when it comes to things of the day this week.

348
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:24,479
Scott: What are you throwing down?

349
00:20:24,941 --> 00:20:36,199
Rym: Well, uh one thing led to another and I've decided that I have an interesting theme this week a theme that I don't think Scott will be able to top and I give Scott until next week to come up with a theme.

350
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:39,342
Scott: So we're gonna sort of had this dueling Theme.

351
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:44,864
Scott: thing of the day is for this week all of rims things of the day will have a theme and my things that they'll Be normal next week.

352
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:46,650
Scott: all my things today will have a theme.

353
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:52,633
Rym: see I was debating if I should make it a kind of thing Where I'll do the four things the day and then over the weekend.

354
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:56,700
Rym: people can guess what the theme was But I think I'm is so obvious.

355
00:20:56,941 --> 00:21:00,133
Rym: Kinda the theme isn't quite as obvious as you'd think you might think.

356
00:21:00,173 --> 00:21:01,719
Rym: it's obvious from day one.

357
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:07,538
Rym: Day two is probably gonna throw you for a loop day three is gonna bring you back around and day four You're probably gonna cry.

358
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:13,819
Rym: Okay, right now you see before way back We did a theme week on things of the day and it was hockey fight week.

359
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:17,119
Rym: That was well and good because there are more than eight hockey fights in the world.

360
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:26,000
Rym: But if we try to do any kind of unified thing today theme week We realized that now we have to find eight related things of the day that are all at least above the line.

361
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:29,840
Scott: Oh, it's not easy unless it's something, you know already existing.

362
00:21:30,262 --> 00:21:33,860
Rym: So thus I'll tell you the story of how I came upon this because I've come upon it twice.

363
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:42,998
Scott: I was watching I think Random Family Guy episodes and clips on YouTube and YouTube has that handy feature when you're done watching a video It says hey check these out.

364
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:50,539
Rym: So I was just surfing through them by clicking on the recommendations and after Family Guy it eventually took me to a Spanish Family Guy.

365
00:21:50,862 --> 00:21:53,380
Rym: Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma Toma.

366
00:21:54,042 --> 00:22:00,915
Rym: And then in the bottom, right I see a picture of Hitler and I think Hitler a. How is this related?

367
00:22:01,397 --> 00:22:09,400
Rym: So I click on it and It was the short version of my thing of the day and I thought it was Entrancing and hilarious.

368
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,839
Rym: Forgot about it, totally forgot about it, this was weeks ago.

369
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,119
Rym: Fast forward to this weekend.

370
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Rym: I'm sitting around, I'm watching random space ghosts on YouTube.

371
00:22:20,262 --> 00:22:20,369
Scott: Oi!

372
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,220
Rym: One thing leads to another, and I end up watching Monty Python instead.

373
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,860
Scott: Why would you watch Monty Python on YouTube when you have every DVD of it?

374
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,700
Rym: 'Cause it happened to be recommended to me, and it was a sketch I liked.

375
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,110
Rym: Alright.

376
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,513
Rym: And then I noticed that the recommended sketch is one of my favorite sketches, one that I've used at the thing of the day before, Mr.

377
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:38,036
Rym: Hiltter.

378
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,268
Scott: Mr.

379
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:39,839
Scott: Hiltter?

380
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:49,499
Rym: So I click on it, and sure enough, related to this video, was uh, the same video I had seen before, except this time it was the full version.

381
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:50,840
Scott: Oak snaps.

382
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,180
Rym: Thus, my thing of the day, and my theme, are one and the same.

383
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,640
Rym: They're Adolf Hitler, born to be alive.

384
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:00,920
Scott: I think that's all you gotta say about that.

385
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,319
Rym: I think that's all I have to say about that.

386
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:08,160
Rym: I'll warn you, this is one of those videos that if you watch it, one, the song is going to get stuck in your head.

387
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,580
Rym: Two, you're gonna get the video stuck in your head.

388
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,100
Rym: And three, you're really gonna start thinking about this video in weird--.

389
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:28,471
Rym: I mean, if you listen to this and watch it more than a few times, it's almost like you forget what Hitler really did, and you only remember him saying, "Born... born to be

390
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,278
Rym: alive.".

391
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:33,300
Scott: Yeah, we learned that this song was a one-hit wonder from before our time.

392
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,619
Scott: God, this is-- In case you're wondering.

393
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:43,120
Rym: This guy, Patrick Hernandez, did a bunch of disco music, I guess, and this is apparently the only song he ever did that anyone remembered.

394
00:23:44,285 --> 00:23:44,540
Scott: Alright.

395
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,540
Rym: And someone decided to make a Hitler music video to it.

396
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,140
Scott: Why they chose this song, I don't know.

397
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:51,480
Scott: You could've made a Hitler video to all sorts of songs.

398
00:23:51,660 --> 00:24:02,260
Rym: Why they chose Hitler, but though I gotta say, the voice acting-- Well, the voice sync between the guy, Patrick Hernandez, and Hitler is really well done, considering the quality of the footage.

399
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,860
Scott: It's about as well done as it could be, considering the circumstances.

400
00:24:07,023 --> 00:24:08,659
Rym: I particularly like the use of horns.

401
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:10,180
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's a good one.

402
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:11,519
Rym: And the use of Nazi youth.

403
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,599
Scott: Yeah, too much Nazi youth going on.

404
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:20,139
Rym: Alright, so now that my awesome thing of the day is out there, I can sit back and drink brandy.

405
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,799
Rym: What have you got?

406
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,640
Scott: Alright, well, there's a story on some dude's-- I guess it's his blog, I'm not sure, that made the rounds.

407
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,859
Scott: And it's pretty short, so I'm just gonna read the whole thing.

408
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,498
Scott: He says, "Well, my father heard about Vista coming on the

409
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:32,760
Scott: news.".

410
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,480
Scott: For anyone who doesn't know, Vista came out last week.

411
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:40,520
Scott: "Since he was interested in getting it, he asked me to obtain it and install it on his computer, and he would give some cash in return.

412
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,434
Scott: I told him I was gonna do that, but instead, I installed

413
00:24:44,454 --> 00:24:44,715
Scott: Ubuntu."

414
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:46,416
Scott: Ubuntu!

415
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:54,300
Scott: "Later, when it came home from work, I showed him his new Vista install, complete with the latest office and Solitaire.

416
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:04,617
Scott: It's been a few days since that, and now he says Bill Gates is better than Steve Jobs and brags about how OS X on my iMac is obsolete compared to Vista on his

417
00:25:04,697 --> 00:25:04,918
Scott: PC.".

418
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:07,520
Rym: So, when's this guy gonna let him in on the secret?

419
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,333
Scott: "I will continue with the prank for some weeks, after which, I'll tell him the truth and give him back his

420
00:25:12,413 --> 00:25:12,654
Scott: money.".

421
00:25:14,027 --> 00:25:14,299
Rym: Wow.

422
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:25,839
Rym: I don't know what to say other than, I don't think Microsoft's inherent old-school monopoly or the preference people seem to have for Windows is as strong as everyone thinks it is.

423
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,756
Scott: Well, I think it just shows the power of branding and, you know, ideas.

424
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:32,113
Scott: It's like people go, "Ah, a new

425
00:25:32,153 --> 00:25:32,698
Scott: Windows!".

426
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,779
Scott: You know, they don't actually know about their computing or think about it.

427
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,179
Scott: And it just, you know, this is just circumstantial evidence here.

428
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:48,400
Scott: But I truly do believe that Linux is better for a lot of people if they would just accept it.

429
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,760
Scott: And if you, you know, the thing is, because you say to them, "You're gonna use Linux instead of Windows.

430
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,938
Scott: That's a change and they're afraid of it and they don't want to go for

431
00:25:57,018 --> 00:25:57,058
Scott: it.".

432
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:03,279
Scott: But if there's no change for them to be afraid of and you give it to them, it is better for them.

433
00:26:03,502 --> 00:26:04,499
Scott: They just don't know it.

434
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:16,300
Scott: And they'll like it if they would give it a try and be more open-minded and get rid of their misconceptions about what Linux is or, you know, lose their fear of the unknown and change.

435
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:28,220
Rym: Yeah, the only thing is, like some people, I'd love to give it to my parents, but they have a lot of old Windows weird proprietary programs that they really like to use and don't exist in Linux.

436
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:29,521
Scott: Yeah.

437
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,579
Scott: The other thing is my parents, they browse the web.

438
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,109
Scott: They browse the web.

439
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,100
Scott: They do email, instant messaging.

440
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:46,840
Scott: All that normal stuff that everyone does, email, web browsing, instant messaging, watching videos, photo management, all that sort of stuff.

441
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,780
Scott: Linux, perfect, no problems.

442
00:26:48,861 --> 00:26:49,360
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

443
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,080
Scott: Especially Ubuntu.

444
00:26:50,602 --> 00:26:50,998
Scott: Ubuntu.

445
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,339
Scott: You know, what the hell.

446
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:59,920
Scott: This guy also has a funny Photoshop here of a Windows Vista Ultimate box, only he replaced the Windows logo with the Ubuntu logo.

447
00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:01,680
Scott: It's kind of nice.

448
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:11,600
Scott: So yeah, if anyone out there is thinking about getting Vista, I tried it out for five seconds in the store, and it looked like Windows to me with a big bar on the side and some fancy graphics.

449
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,360
Rym: All right, a bar on the side, eh?

450
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:15,280
Scott: Yeah, you can put widgets in it and stuff.

451
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:16,539
Rym: I don't know about that.

452
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,720
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure you could probably make it go away, but yeah, that's what Vista is.

453
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:29,040
Scott: And, you know, if XP is no longer supported and you're tired of it, before you try out Vista, you're going to erase your hard drive anyway.

454
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,980
Scott: Why not try Ubuntu first?

455
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:31,987
Scott: It won't hurt you.

456
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:32,839
Scott: It's free, free.

457
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,600
Scott: Okay.

458
00:27:34,144 --> 00:27:36,340
Rym: Right, so we're both computer professionals.

459
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:44,580
Rym: I'm an IT professional and Scott's a CS professional, and we carry around with us in various situations a number of tools of the trade.

460
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,800
Rym: I mean, if you see a plumber and he's going to do some plumbing, he brings plumber's equipment with him.

461
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,380
Rym: A carpenter brings carpenter's equipment.

462
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,175
Scott: So you might be asking, "You know, carpenter's got his hammer and nails, plumber's got his

463
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:54,517
Scott: wrench.".

464
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:59,280
Rym: What on earth do computer people have as the tools of their trade?

465
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,699
Rym: I mean, it's not quite as clear cut as a lot of people might think it is.

466
00:28:03,286 --> 00:28:04,220
Scott: No, it is not.

467
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,580
Scott: I mean, a monkey wrench really doesn't help you with a computer.

468
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:08,939
Scott: Neither does a hammer and nails.

469
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,419
Rym: Hammer and nails might.

470
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,980
Scott: Hardly ever, though.

471
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,940
Scott: It's not a common tool.

472
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,239
Rym: If you need to destroy a hard drive in a hurry.

473
00:28:16,423 --> 00:28:17,559
Scott: You know, we don't need chainsaws.

474
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,860
Scott: All the standard tools you see at Home Depot, you know, power drills, not too useful for computer guys.

475
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,260
Rym: However, Dremel, incredibly useful.

476
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,739
Scott: Well, for hacking or modding, yes.

477
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:30,940
Scott: But for normal computer use, not so much.

478
00:28:31,262 --> 00:28:33,580
Rym: Also as a low-powered electronic screwdriver.

479
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,460
Scott: Yeah, I think an electric screwdriver is better than a Dremel.

480
00:28:38,103 --> 00:28:38,939
Rym: Yeah, but we're geeks.

481
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,220
Rym: We want to have the most functionality for the least money.

482
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,579
Scott: That is true.

483
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,020
Scott: So obviously we're going to have the Dremel.

484
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,679
Scott: Electric screwdrivers can be had for pretty cheap if you don't want the best one, though.

485
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,219
Rym: We always want the best one.

486
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:48,839
Scott: No, you don't.

487
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,319
Rym: Oh, no, you always want the second best one.

488
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,239
Scott: That brings us to the first tool every computer guy ever needs.

489
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,100
Scott: The Phillips screwdriver.

490
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,020
Rym: Yeah, always.

491
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,920
Scott: The standard sized Phillips screwdriver is a computer guy's best friend.

492
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,460
Scott: I mean, I just keep buying more of them because I can't have enough.

493
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,898
Scott: See, I got like five.

494
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:19,919
Rym: But actually, ever since I started working at this new company, I have, see, we'll talk differently because there's the, you know, what you have around the house versus what you bring if you know you're going to be fussing with someone's computer versus what I carry around as a professional in my professional life.

495
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:21,560
Rym: And the three very different sets.

496
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:22,520
Scott: They are very different.

497
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:36,159
Rym: In my professional life, I was given a tool set that includes a very nice, very sturdy manual ratcheting screwdriver that has ratcheting is good, has about 20 different heads for it.

498
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:43,899
Rym: Every different size of screwdriver ever, including the hex bits, the hex bits with the holes in them and the proprietary HP bit.

499
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,319
Scott: Ooh, a proprietary HP bit.

500
00:29:46,521 --> 00:29:48,060
Rym: Yes, for working on HP racks.

501
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:51,099
Scott: Ooh, if you could only get the Nintendo bit, that's the big one.

502
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:52,080
Rym: Actually, you know what?

503
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:53,840
Scott: Or do you have the Tri-Wing?

504
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,439
Scott: That's also a good bit to have.

505
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,439
Rym: I probably, you know what?

506
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,000
Rym: I haven't even gone through a quarter of these things yet because I don't need them all in my day-to-day work.

507
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,420
Scott: The Nintendo bit's actually called GameBit.

508
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:04,639
Scott: It actually has a name.

509
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,439
Scott: I think it also opens old Macs, like Mac Pluses and Mac 512Ks.

510
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,900
Rym: I'm fairly certain I have enough stuff in my toolkit to open any Nintendo thing.

511
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,140
Rym: Perhaps, perhaps.

512
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,740
Scott: Anyway, yeah, you need a Phillips screwdriver.

513
00:30:16,101 --> 00:30:20,098
Scott: I prefer this most standard basic one you can get, but anyone will do.

514
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:22,460
Scott: If you like ratcheting, ratcheting's great.

515
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,460
Scott: Magnetism, magnetism is great.

516
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,439
Rym: Yeah, one thing.

517
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,360
Rym: A lot of people worry about using magnetic screwdrivers around computers.

518
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,360
Rym: You're really not gonna hurt anything.

519
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,160
Scott: Not with a magnetic screwdriver, anyway.

520
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,760
Rym: I mean, hard drives are pretty resilient now.

521
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,160
Rym: You'd have to put a magnet on it, Yeah, you would have to take a strong magnet, like a neodymium.

522
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:49,260
Scott: Well, maybe not a neodymium, but a neodymium would screw it up for sure and put it on your hard drive to screw it up, or on your CRT monitor.

523
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,080
Rym: But aside from hard drives, nothing else is gonna get hurt at all by a magnet.

524
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,019
Scott: As long as it's off.

525
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,419
Scott: You don't wanna mess around with your computer when it's on.

526
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,660
Rym: Well, you shouldn't be messing around with your computer anyway if it's on.

527
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,700
Rym: Now, here's one way, however, that you can screw up a computer with a magnet.

528
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,840
Rym: Take a magnet and affix it to the end of a power drill.

529
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,259
Rym: Turn it on and allow the magnet to spin.

530
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,939
Scott: Yes, that will screw up the computer for sure.

531
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,640
Rym: But yeah, a magnetic screwdriver is not going to hurt your computer.

532
00:31:16,023 --> 00:31:17,698
Rym: I really don't worry about that.

533
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,539
Scott: It's actually very useful for when, if you're having to drop a screw onto the motherboard, you can pick it up with the magnetic screwdriver.

534
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:25,980
Rym: Or you just won't drop it in the first place 'cause it stuck to your screwdriver.

535
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,679
Scott: Oh, that too.

536
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:29,940
Scott: Another good thing, a lot of computer screws.

537
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,380
Scott: There seems to be this one screw.

538
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:41,640
Scott: It's not the only screw you'll ever find in a computer, but it's very common that not only is it Phillips, but also you can sometimes use a normal flathead screwdriver on it if you suck.

539
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:45,980
Scott: But it also is sort of hex-shaped around the Phillips hole.

540
00:31:46,523 --> 00:31:48,740
Scott: And you can use this other sort of screwdriver.

541
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:49,707
Scott: It's not enough.

542
00:31:49,728 --> 00:31:50,900
Scott: I really want to call it a screwdriver.

543
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,939
Rym: You mean a socket wrench?

544
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:53,857
Scott: It's not really a socket wrench, no.

545
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:55,552
Rym: It's a socket.

546
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:56,420
Rym: It's just a small one.

547
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,120
Rym: It's the same mechanism as a socket wrench.

548
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,040
Scott: Yeah, it basically has a hexagon hole in the end of it.

549
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,459
Rym: Yes, it's a small socket.

550
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,620
Scott: Anyway, they're very useful.

551
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:16,360
Scott: And I actually, whenever I have the opportunity to use one, I often do because I can screw things tighter and more easily than with a Phillips, and there's no worry about stripping any weak screws or anything like that.

552
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:27,459
Rym: Well, what I actually use those for a lot was, at one point at IBM, we were on a very shoestring budget, and I had to put hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of data-less Linux clients out there.

553
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,020
Rym: Now, we had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of old computers.

554
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,460
Rym: They're pretty fast, but they weren't being used for anything.

555
00:32:34,982 --> 00:32:39,160
Rym: So we decided we could use these as the Linux clients, you know, image all the hard drives.

556
00:32:39,562 --> 00:32:42,540
Rym: I had a script that would change everything so they'd all be unique, whatever.

557
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,178
Rym: Not going to get into the details there.

558
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:57,300
Rym: And it turned out that due to a long series of events that goes back to some sort of corporate espionage between China and Japan a long time ago, a good half of the motherboards on these things had exploded capacitors.

559
00:32:57,884 --> 00:32:58,120
Scott: Awesome.

560
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,260
Rym: Now, we didn't have any budget, and I really needed to finish this project.

561
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,180
Rym: So I sat down and replaced hundreds of motherboards.

562
00:33:05,981 --> 00:33:08,480
Rym: And in order to do this quickly, I came up with a process.

563
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:13,340
Rym: And the fastest way to unscrew and screw those motherboards back into those cases was with a socket.

564
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,700
Rym: At a power socket, it sets the right speed.

565
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,099
Rym: I just went vzzzip, vzzzip, all in a row.

566
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,479
Scott: All right, so after the screwdriver, the obvious need tool.

567
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,120
Scott: Oh, and your hands and your eyes, those are very important tools also.

568
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,640
Rym: Yeah, now, there's the static strap that you don't really need.

569
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,218
Rym: A lot of people use those because they're paranoid, and...

570
00:33:32,782 --> 00:33:33,245
Scott: It helps.

571
00:33:33,507 --> 00:33:35,420
Scott: If you are paranoid, it is guaranteed.

572
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,637
Rym: A much better way is just to hold on to something that will ground you.

573
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:44,080
Scott: Yeah, don't wear wool socks and a sweater and roll around on the wool carpet and then work on your computer.

574
00:33:44,801 --> 00:33:50,537
Rym: Yeah, don't work on your computer if it's frigidly cold or really, really, really dry out unless you have to.

575
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,520
Scott: Mm-hmm.

576
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,740
Scott: Just avoid any possible chance of creating static electricity.

577
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,499
Scott: You know, hold on to something metal.

578
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,560
Scott: Hold on to your computer's case.

579
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,940
Scott: Hope it's a metal case.

580
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,660
Scott: If it's a plastic case, that's not going to help you.

581
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,720
Rym: But we're not really talking about it.

582
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,960
Rym: We're talking more about the tools you bring.

583
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:09,195
Rym: But if you don't know how to deal with grounding yourself properly, you can get one of those wrist straps.

584
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:09,920
Rym: They work alright.

585
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,540
Rym: The key is, you actually have to click them on to something grounded.

586
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,080
Rym: Don't just click them to something metal.

587
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:15,880
Rym: That's not going to do anything.

588
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,018
Scott: I mean, just wearing the wrist strap isn't going to help you.

589
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,380
Scott: It has this little, you know, wire with an alligator clip.

590
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,719
Rym: No, but I saw a guy working on a computer once at a company that I won't name.

591
00:34:24,422 --> 00:34:26,458
Rym: And he was working on it, and he had a wrist strap on.

592
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:32,079
Rym: And the little alligator clip coming out of the wire on it was clipped to the case of the computer he was working on.

593
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,040
Rym: Now, the computer was not plugged in and was not grounded in any way.

594
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:37,079
Scott: Not so good.

595
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,918
Scott: You generally click it to, like, I don't know.

596
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:41,879
Scott: Well, you know what's always grounded?

597
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:48,500
Scott: Supposedly, those screws right in the middle of a power outlet that hold the thing on, those go right into the grounding.

598
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,580
Rym: Yeah, I actually made a little thing where I could stick it into the third hole on a grounded power outlet.

599
00:34:54,203 --> 00:34:54,998
Scott: That's a good way, too.

600
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,640
Rym: And I always grounded myself that way if I was working on anything sensitive.

601
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,300
Scott: Be careful not to kill yourself, though, when going near the outlet.

602
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,960
Rym: Yeah, it'd be pretty hard for me.

603
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,660
Rym: In fact, I couldn't physically stick that thing in the wrong hole.

604
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,200
Scott: No, you couldn't, because you were smart.

605
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,120
Scott: But an idiot could very easily kill himself playing around with power outlets.

606
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,520
Rym: Not with that mechanism, because it's wide and fat.

607
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,160
Rym: It won't even go into the normal holes.

608
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,679
Rym: You would have to sit there, filing the edges down enough to shove it into that hole.

609
00:35:18,881 --> 00:35:19,260
Scott: Anyway...

610
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,560
Rym: It would take you about 15 minutes to kill yourself.

611
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,100
Scott: Anyway, yeah, so a grounding method of some sort could be a useful tool for a computer guy.

612
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,753
Rym: Well, you see a lot of those kits that people sell, like, "Oh, a computer, whatever

613
00:35:31,793 --> 00:35:31,995
Rym: kit.".

614
00:35:32,743 --> 00:35:34,140
Rym: Don't bother with anything like that.

615
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,180
Scott: Yeah, I bought the cheapest one from Radio Shack.

616
00:35:36,361 --> 00:35:43,860
Scott: I think it's still available, but the only tools in there that I needed were the screwdriver, the hex bit, and two other bits.

617
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,879
Scott: One of them was sort of this grabber.

618
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,339
Rym: And... The grabber's useless.

619
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,419
Scott: The grabber is useful occasionally.

620
00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:52,160
Rym: I've never needed to use the grabber.

621
00:35:52,220 --> 00:36:00,480
Rym: Any time I've dropped something where the grabber might be useful, I could either just reach it on my own, or I could tilt the computer slightly and it would roll to safety.

622
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,659
Rym: Also, the grabber very easily can scratch things.

623
00:36:04,382 --> 00:36:05,780
Scott: That's only if you suck with the grabber.

624
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,112
Rym: But why bother with the grabber?

625
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:07,840
Rym: The grabber's useless.

626
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:10,879
Scott: I've used the grabber many times when anything else would have failed.

627
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,840
Scott: What would have failed?

628
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,091
Scott: I drop screws a lot.

629
00:36:13,596 --> 00:36:13,980
Scott: A lot.

630
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,300
Rym: Well, you should get a magnetic screwdriver instead.

631
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,067
Scott: I should, I should.

632
00:36:17,127 --> 00:36:26,480
Scott: But, anyway, yeah, if you drop screws, they make these little grabbers where you push a button on the top, and these three little metal guys come out, sort of like a claw, a little tiny claw.

633
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,160
Scott: that's exactly the right size for you.

634
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,535
Rym: I'll warn you right now, don't think, "Hey, and grab yourself with it.

635
00:36:31,595 --> 00:36:31,797
Rym: That

636
00:36:31,837 --> 00:36:32,119
Rym: hurts.".

637
00:36:32,241 --> 00:36:33,079
Scott: It does kind of hurt.

638
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,308
Scott: A lot.

639
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,940
Scott: Yeah, 'cause they're pointed little metal guys.

640
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,020
Scott: But, you know, it's the perfect size for grabbing a screw.

641
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:46,619
Scott: So let's say you drop a screw, and the screw is in between the video card and the CPU and a capacitor, and you're like, "Ugh, God, how am I gonna get that out of

642
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:46,800
Scott: there?".

643
00:36:47,002 --> 00:36:48,799
Scott: The grabber goes "whoop" and pulls it right out.

644
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:50,800
Rym: Yeah, or your magnetic screwdriver.

645
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:52,064
Scott: It depends.

646
00:36:52,226 --> 00:36:57,959
Scott: But, yeah, it's a handy tool to have when working with screws that can fall into tight places that you need to retrieve.

647
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,574
Scott: 'Cause you can't leave the screw there.

648
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,099
Scott: That's no good.

649
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,240
Rym: But those kits come with a bunch of other crap.

650
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,460
Rym: Like, a lot of times, they'll come with a continuity tester.

651
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,139
Rym: that's never going to be useful to you.

652
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:08,259
Scott: I didn't even get one of those.

653
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,320
Rym: They'll come with two specialized tools.

654
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,080
Rym: One of which exists solely to remove ICs from breadboards.

655
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,160
Scott: And you will never need to do that.

656
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,340
Scott: They also have another tool that puts ICs in breadboards.

657
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,540
Scott: Yes, you will- There's a chip pusher and a chip ripper.

658
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,140
Rym: That was the other thing I was gonna mention.

659
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,330
Rym: You don't need them.

660
00:37:24,693 --> 00:37:26,778
Scott: You will never- You needed them a hundred years ago.

661
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,300
Rym: You know what you need them for today?

662
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,900
Rym: And even then, usually you don't.

663
00:37:30,462 --> 00:37:38,680
Rym: If you screw up your BIOS so royally that you can't even recover it, which is hard to do because- A lot of BIOSes aren't even on those kind of ICs anymore.

664
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,340
Rym: Yeah, but most BIOSes now come with an unrideable recovery sector.

665
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:43,919
Rym: you can boot from in an emergency.

666
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,360
Rym: With a jumper or something.

667
00:37:45,942 --> 00:37:48,100
Scott: You never gonna need to replace a BIOS chip, trust me.

668
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:49,280
Scott: It's so rare.

669
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,339
Rym: But my motherboard right there, I could replace it.

670
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,780
Rym: So if I screwed up the BIOS, I could probably order a BIOS chip.

671
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:04,180
Scott: You know, I never used the chip pusher, the one that puts the ICs on the boards, but I did on occasion use the chip ripper because it was really good for ripping jumpers off.

672
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,857
Rym: I am the pusher robot.

673
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,640
Scott: It was really good at grabbing jumpers off of things.

674
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,527
Rym: See, here's the thing.

675
00:38:08,668 --> 00:38:09,919
Rym: I have a nice jumper grabber.

676
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,120
Scott: Oh, well that's a tool that you need, is some sort of jumper grabber.

677
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,094
Rym: I recommend needle nose pliers.

678
00:38:16,154 --> 00:38:16,900
Rym: They work just as well.

679
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,280
Scott: Needle nose pliers I think are the best, as long as they are needly enough.

680
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:23,880
Scott: I've tried to use needle nose pliers that were less needly, didn't work.

681
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,820
Rym: Of course the thing is, jumpers are fast becoming obsolete.

682
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,520
Rym: I mean, back in the day, you had to switch like 10 jumpers on your motherboard to make it even boot.

683
00:38:32,082 --> 00:38:33,699
Scott: That $20 motherboard had a lot of jumpers.

684
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,740
Rym: It did, but nowadays, most hard drives don't need to set any jumpers, because cable select or serial ATA...

685
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,760
Scott: Yeah, serial ATA doesn't need jumpers anymore.

686
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,384
Rym: And you know what?

687
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:46,560
Rym: Contrary to popular belief, non-serial ATA hasn't need jumpers for a long time.

688
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,899
Rym: Cable select just works.

689
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,820
Scott: Yeah, cable select usually works, but I still like to set the jumpers.

690
00:38:51,605 --> 00:38:52,058
Scott: I like to.

691
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:58,119
Rym: You know, I used to, and I unset them all when I started moving hard drives around between all the computers in my room.

692
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,900
Rym: Because I kept making them master slave, and it just wasn't worth it.

693
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,980
Rym: So I just pulled all the jumpers out, they were all cable select, worked like a charm.

694
00:39:04,401 --> 00:39:05,200
Rym: Hey, awesome.

695
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:14,180
Rym: Also, my old RAID thing that I never really got working from way back in the day, wouldn't work unless everything was set to cable select.

696
00:39:14,842 --> 00:39:15,478
Scott: Whoa, crazy.

697
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,760
Rym: I never really figured out why, and I didn't really care.

698
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,320
Scott: Yeah, I just wouldn't ask the question.

699
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:22,320
Rym: Really important.

700
00:39:22,983 --> 00:39:26,580
Rym: We talked about you need the Phillips head screwdriver, even though most things have thumb screws.

701
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,299
Rym: You still need that screwdriver, believe me.

702
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:34,340
Scott: Yeah, I've had thumb screws that just won't come out, and I need to put a Phillips screwdriver into the thumb screw to get it off.

703
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:39,360
Rym: Independent of that, you need a flathead screwdriver, but you need a special one.

704
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,360
Rym: You need a flathead that is effectively just a mini crowbar.

705
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,540
Rym: Needs to be really durable, really solid, yet small.

706
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:53,220
Rym: And the reason is, with modern socket processors, usually there's this weird mechanism that holds the heat sink on.

707
00:39:53,942 --> 00:39:54,980
Scott: Oh, I didn't even think of that.

708
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,398
Scott: You're smart.

709
00:39:55,941 --> 00:40:03,280
Rym: Because at IBM, I encountered that, because my computer is so old that I had a slot A in there for the longest time.

710
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:09,060
Scott: Yeah, when you install the heat sink on a socket processor -- Well, this is how to install a processor on a motherboard, a modern processor, right?

711
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,680
Scott: First, there's a little lever on the motherboard.

712
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,919
Scott: You pull the lever out and up.

713
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,040
Scott: That's easy enough, right?

714
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,939
Scott: You can do it with your hand.

715
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:17,220
Scott: Then you drop the chip into the slot.

716
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:20,780
Scott: That's pretty easy, because there's only like four possible ways it can go.

717
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,700
Rym: And it'll only actually go in one of those ways.

718
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,779
Scott: Yeah, if you have to push the CPU down, you just screwed up your CPU.

719
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,060
Rym: Yeah, you just set it on there and wait for it to fall in.

720
00:40:28,223 --> 00:40:28,999
Scott: And it falls into the holes.

721
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,079
Rym: It usually lines up.

722
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:34,320
Rym: There'll be one clipped corner, and line the clipped corner with the clipped corner on the socket.

723
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:35,480
Scott: Yeah, it's not hard.

724
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,199
Scott: Then you put the lever down.

725
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,760
Scott: Now the CPU is installed, but you need to put a heat sink on top of it.

726
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:46,740
Scott: Well, the heat sink is a big block of metal, and it has this metal clamp that kind of swings back and forth.

727
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,878
Scott: What, the clamps?

728
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,777
Scott: Yeah, the clamps.

729
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,300
Scott: And sometimes they have fancy clamps.

730
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,800
Scott: Sometimes they have really simple clamps.

731
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,240
Scott: The way the clamp works is the plastic socket that the CPU just went into, on two sides of it, will have these hooks.

732
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,020
Scott: And you take the metal thing on the heat sink.

733
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,760
Scott: Well, first you rest the heat sink on the CPU in the correct orientation.

734
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:10,380
Scott: Then the metal thing that swings back and forth, you put it under the hooks on one side.

735
00:41:10,441 --> 00:41:11,340
Scott: You can do that with your hand.

736
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:11,778
Scott: It's easy.

737
00:41:12,363 --> 00:41:20,460
Scott: But now you have to get the other side of this metal thing under the hooks on the other side, which requires a lot of pushing.

738
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,058
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people are really afraid, you know, how fragile their processors are.

739
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:29,760
Rym: But you'd be surprised how much force is actually used to hold a heat sink directly against that thing.

740
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,880
Scott: It is very important that the heat sink does not fall off.

741
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:38,940
Rym: Therefore, this clamp is very-- It's that it has to be perfectly tight and sealed effectively.

742
00:41:39,482 --> 00:41:41,399
Rym: Yes, and-- I mean, it's not going to fall off.

743
00:41:41,822 --> 00:41:45,940
Scott: And the equipment is made to withstand the amount of force required to install the heat sink.

744
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,578
Scott: Don't worry.

745
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,980
Rym: Now, keep in mind, it's taken to withstand normal, gradual force.

746
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,479
Rym: Don't hit it with a hammer.

747
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:54,919
Scott: No, don't do that.

748
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,200
Rym: But the thing is, to get it in there, there's a slot for a flathead screwdriver.

749
00:42:00,723 --> 00:42:09,520
Rym: If you use a cheap screwdriver, especially if you try to use one of those little black ones, you know, the little, like, eyeglass screwdrivers, even though they fit in there just fine, you'll just bend it right in half.

750
00:42:09,914 --> 00:42:10,059
Scott: Yep.

751
00:42:10,441 --> 00:42:21,780
Scott: You need to get a nice, sturdy flathead screwdriver, stick it into there, and then you will be able to easily, with a little bit of practice, push that metal clamp under those hooks and have your heat sink installed properly.

752
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:30,880
Scott: So if you're ever doing heat sinks on or off, you need that flathead screwdriver, because you also needed to get the heat sinks off to push it down under the hooks and then out.

753
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,865
Rym: Now, other than things like extra screws and all that, there's really, in a basic level, nothing else.

754
00:42:35,905 --> 00:42:37,200
Rym: you need to work with computers.

755
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:42,739
Scott: No, I mean, you could do 99% of computing tasks with those tools and your hands.

756
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:50,000
Rym: However, let's say that you also are going to be doing some troubleshooting, or, you know, these are just things you should also just always keep around your house to mess with computers.

757
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,439
Rym: Not so much tools, but just useful bits.

758
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,032
Rym: First and foremost, and I can't recommend this enough, get a power supply tester.

759
00:42:57,113 --> 00:42:57,880
Rym: They're real cheap.

760
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:06,200
Rym: You plug them into a power supply, you turn them on, they trick the power supply into thinking that a motherboard is plugged in, and they allow you to power up a power supply.

761
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:15,939
Rym: 90% of the time, if you can power up a power supply, the power supply is good, and now you know that the problem is something with your expensive motherboard as opposed to your cheap power supply.

762
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:25,760
Scott: The reason that you need a power supply tester, but you don't need a specific tester for anything else, is because power supply problems are usually a little trickier to diagnose than other problems.

763
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:31,260
Rym: You know, I mean, let's say I-- No, no, really, these things by default only test if a power supply is dead.

764
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:31,896
Scott: Yeah.

765
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,498
Rym: Because if the power supply is dead, then-- Well, if the computer doesn't turn on.

766
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:38,300
Rym: All right, any number of things could be wrong.

767
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,220
Rym: So the first thing you should test is the power supply because most of the time, that's the problem.

768
00:43:42,861 --> 00:43:46,280
Scott: Yeah, we learned that lesson the hard way in the year 2001.

769
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:53,200
Rym: Yeah, partly because power requirements for PCs had gone up quite a bit suddenly, and we didn't keep track of that.

770
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,419
Scott: Nope, no one told us.

771
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,027
Rym: We were trying to use 200 and 300 watt power supplies on 400 and 450 watt computers.

772
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,420
Scott: Yeah, it didn't turn out so well.

773
00:44:01,823 --> 00:44:06,679
Rym: But the thing is, power supplies-- I mean, you might wonder, how does the computer know to turn the power supply on?

774
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,919
Rym: Because the power supply turns on independent.

775
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:10,378
Rym: It turns on.

776
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,980
Scott: I mean, the power button that you push to turn your computer on is connected to the motherboard.

777
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,100
Scott: The motherboard is connected to the power supply.

778
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,540
Scott: So turning on the power supply, the motherboard has to do something.

779
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,530
Rym: Yeah, basically, it shorts out two of the pins on that connector.

780
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:28,800
Rym: you shove into the motherboard, especially the old standard ATX power supply connector.

781
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,437
Scott: Yeah, the old ATX connector said 20 pins.

782
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,399
Scott: The new ones have 24, which sucks.

783
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,000
Scott: No one told me about that either.

784
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,079
Rym: You might think, why can't I just short those pins out and test it?

785
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,860
Rym: And the answer is, the power supply is smarter than you.

786
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:46,098
Rym: If it doesn't notice a load on the wire itself out there, it won't turn on.

787
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:56,480
Rym: So power supply testers are a thing that you stick onto the wire, you turn it on, and not only does it short those things out, but it has a bunch of resistors, and it puts a load on the power supply.

788
00:44:57,162 --> 00:45:01,499
Rym: Now, you can't turn these things on for more than, I don't know, 10 or 15 seconds, so they start heating up.

789
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,860
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much just a tester.

790
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,920
Scott: Click, it's working, click.

791
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:13,880
Rym: Now, you can use these also, if you're more adventurous, with a voltimeter to see if the power supply is actually good, but they're also fancy power supplies.

792
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:19,500
Rym: In general, you really don't need to, because nine times out of ten, if the power supply is dead, it's just not going to turn on at all.

793
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,879
Scott: Yeah, power supplies these days are really smart, and they have a lot of logic and things in them.

794
00:45:24,282 --> 00:45:30,100
Scott: So if you hook up too much stuff to a power supply, and it's not going to be able to power everything, it just won't turn on.

795
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:35,380
Rym: Also, if it will turn on but is giving bad voltage, you can go to your BIOS and look at the voltage coming in.

796
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,920
Rym: The motherboard knows, and the motherboard can tell you if it's bad.

797
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:38,501
Scott: Yep.

798
00:45:39,007 --> 00:45:40,040
Scott: All right, what other tools are--.

799
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:47,039
Scott: Oh, number one, if you're working with, let's say, some IDE hard drives, you want to have some extra cables.

800
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:50,820
Scott: If you're working with SATA hard drives, you want extra SATA cables.

801
00:45:51,403 --> 00:45:56,600
Scott: Any sort of little wire that's going to be inside the computer, pretty good idea to have some sort of backup.

802
00:45:57,441 --> 00:46:01,860
Scott: Get some extra Ethernet cables, video cables, USB cables.

803
00:46:02,363 --> 00:46:04,080
Scott: All kinds of cables are useful to have.

804
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,380
Scott: You never know when the cable's the problem.

805
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:10,838
Scott: Or, "Oh, I need to hook up something extra, but I don't have the cable to do

806
00:46:10,919 --> 00:46:10,959
Scott: it.".

807
00:46:11,763 --> 00:46:16,798
Rym: Yep, it's always good to have a power supply adapter splitter just in case you need one more device.

808
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:17,593
Scott: Yep.

809
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,799
Rym: Of course, you don't want to use too many of those.

810
00:46:20,222 --> 00:46:21,409
Scott: Nope, nope.

811
00:46:21,651 --> 00:46:23,220
Scott: An extra CPU fan.

812
00:46:24,684 --> 00:46:27,295
Scott: Now, you might be thinking, "Ah, CPU fan, they're kind of

813
00:46:27,336 --> 00:46:28,019
Scott: expensive.".

814
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,020
Scott: Well, usually you buy one CPU, it comes with one fan, how are you supposed to get an extra one?

815
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,100
Scott: Let me tell you, many times an extra CPU fan has come in handy.

816
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:37,434
Rym: Yes.

817
00:46:38,122 --> 00:46:45,259
Scott: How often do you go to fix someone's computer and it was just a problem of they never cleaned their computer, their CPU fan full of dust, now it doesn't work?

818
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,837
Rym: Of course, very important, always carry around the can of air.

819
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,180
Rym: Oh, you forget the can of air.

820
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:52,880
Rym: Look, it's right there, it's in my closet.

821
00:46:53,662 --> 00:46:58,360
Scott: Yeah, can of air is, I think it's up there with the Phillips screwdriver, we shouldn't have forgotten it this long.

822
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,400
Rym: No, because I don't bring it everywhere, I only bring it if I know I'm going to clean a computer.

823
00:47:01,847 --> 00:47:02,380
Scott: That is true.

824
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,479
Rym: If I don't know I'm cleaning your computer and I come to help you and your computer needs cleaning, that's the end of our day.

825
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:08,218
Scott: Yep.

826
00:47:08,622 --> 00:47:09,700
Rym: I'm not cleaning a computer.

827
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,700
Scott: That is a common problem.

828
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:17,440
Rym: But the easiest way to clean out a computer is just to take it outside and spray all the relevant bits with compressed air.

829
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,420
Rym: Now, make sure you use a can of compressed air.

830
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,120
Rym: Don't use a compressor.

831
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,940
Rym: Compressors can make static electricity.

832
00:47:24,523 --> 00:47:25,080
Scott: That is correct.

833
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,100
Rym: You want to use cans of compressed air.

834
00:47:28,464 --> 00:47:29,340
Rym: Don't try to be clever.

835
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:36,820
Scott: Yeah, and while you go to the store and those cans of air that you see at Staples or whatever are kind of expensive, just deal with it.

836
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,279
Scott: You're not going to get them cheaper anywhere else.

837
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:38,920
Rym: Yeah, really.

838
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,380
Rym: I mean, if you try really hard you can save a couple bucks.

839
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,120
Rym: Just keep a can of air around.

840
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,400
Rym: They actually last quite a while.

841
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:45,900
Scott: And they are really useful.

842
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,340
Scott: Really useful.

843
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,699
Rym: Actually, you always want to have two cans of air because I'm not going to get into the physics here.

844
00:47:53,341 --> 00:47:56,520
Rym: You guys should know this stuff since most of you have gone through at least high school.

845
00:47:57,261 --> 00:48:02,779
Rym: If you have a can of compressed air and you use it for more than a trivial amount of time, it starts to get cold.

846
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:07,079
Rym: The colder it gets, the less effective it's going to be until it warms up again.

847
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,420
Rym: However, you don't want to just warm it up with a heater because then it'll explode.

848
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,479
Rym: And you'll kill yourself.

849
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,059
Scott: So what you basically need to do-- That's a YouTube video.

850
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,760
Scott: Throw a can of compressed air into a fire.

851
00:48:15,862 --> 00:48:16,679
Rym: That's a bad idea.

852
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:17,679
Scott: That's a great YouTube.

853
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,519
Rym: But you've got to have two.

854
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,419
Rym: So you use one.

855
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,960
Rym: And the moment it starts getting really cold in your hands, you set it aside, let it warm up while you use the second one.

856
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,538
Rym: And you switch off between the two.

857
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:31,520
Rym: Otherwise, you're going to waste a lot of your air at a much lower pressure and not get your money's worth.

858
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,600
Scott: That is correct.

859
00:48:33,121 --> 00:48:39,220
Scott: And sometimes a lot of people, they're dumb, and they use one and it starts getting cold and it stops squirting out air.

860
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,200
Scott: They think it's done even though they only used it for five seconds.

861
00:48:42,964 --> 00:48:44,080
Scott: I've seen that happen a lot.

862
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:49,540
Rym: Also, if you want to have fun, you can turn it upside down, and now you basically have a liquid death ray.

863
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,280
Scott: Don't do that unless you know what you're doing.

864
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:52,778
Scott: It's dangerous.

865
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:53,998
Rym: Yeah, it's also really fun.

866
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:54,980
Scott: And dangerous.

867
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,939
Rym: Yeah, don't try this at home, kids.

868
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:02,379
Rym: But yeah, also, you need to carry around things like, I don't know, an Ubuntu CD.

869
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:06,739
Scott: Yeah, not everything that you need for tools is hardware.

870
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,560
Scott: There's a lot of software stuff that can be really even more handy.

871
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,060
Rym: Yep, we don't really need to go into all of them, especially not specifics because it changes a lot.

872
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,420
Scott: The only specific one I want to mention is the OPH crack CD.

873
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:27,639
Scott: I've never used it myself, but from everything I hear, supposedly, you can just use this CD to break into a Windows machine if the password is messed up.

874
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:34,959
Rym: I have actually broken into dozens of Windows machines as a part of my job at IBM and at RIT.

875
00:49:35,721 --> 00:49:36,600
Rym: I didn't use that, though.

876
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,358
Rym: I used a boot disk called a Stroomy that did the same thing.

877
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,600
Rym: Basically, there are four different ways to hack Windows passwords.

878
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,369
Rym: I don't know if these work on Vista, but they work on XP, they work on 2000, they work on NT.

879
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:52,360
Rym: 98's a whole different bag.

880
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:53,217
Rym: Don't even worry.

881
00:49:53,621 --> 00:50:02,800
Scott: The thing is, you will probably run into a Windows machine that you can't log into as administrator or someone forgot a password, and these CDs are really handy.

882
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,980
Scott: Some of them might take a while to break the password.

883
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,680
Scott: Some of them don't take any time at all.

884
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,880
Rym: No, they don't break the password.

885
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,618
Rym: That's not what they do.

886
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:09,620
Scott: Some of them do.

887
00:50:10,024 --> 00:50:11,700
Rym: No, you can try to break the password.

888
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,680
Rym: That's going to take forever.

889
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,019
Rym: It's generally a losing proposition and you don't want to do it.

890
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:20,059
Rym: The best way to do it, I forget what the tool is, but on the Stroomy thing, you can find it.

891
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,220
Rym: Maybe I'll post in the forums.

892
00:50:21,743 --> 00:50:27,780
Rym: But what you do is you use a hash function and you can basically change someone's password to whatever you want.

893
00:50:28,263 --> 00:50:29,860
Rym: You can't get their password.

894
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:35,360
Rym: The only problem here is that if they have encrypted volumes, you won't be able to access them unless you figure out their password.

895
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:43,378
Rym: However, if they left any data non-encrypted, especially if they're not the brightest user, you can usually find hints as to what their password actually is.

896
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:44,340
Rym: Uh-huh.

897
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,218
Rym: But, yeah.

898
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:47,559
Rym: Also, I always carry around a DBAN disk.

899
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,220
Rym: DBAN is pretty much my favorite nuke a hard drive in a hurry disk.

900
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,598
Scott: My favorite is, oh, DBAN, Derek's Boot and Nuke.

901
00:50:55,703 --> 00:50:58,520
Scott: I was like, I use a different one, Derek's Boot and Nuke.

902
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,359
Scott: And then I was like, wait a minute, DBAN is Derek's Boot and Nuke.

903
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:08,309
Rym: Yeah, every company I've ever left, I always DBAN my hard drive whenever I quit.

904
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:08,872
Rym: I'm done.

905
00:51:08,892 --> 00:51:10,260
Rym: Here's my blank computer.

906
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:17,520
Scott: Yep, Derek's Boot and Nuke is basically the CD that you boot off of it, and it will completely erase whatever hard drives you tell it to.

907
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:26,540
Scott: Not just erase, but super erase, so that there is basically no mathematical possibility of recovering the data off of that hard drive ever.

908
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:30,959
Rym: It has various Department of Defense standards in it, all sorts of different things you can do.

909
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:34,260
Rym: It's highly effective, it's very fast, it's very good.

910
00:51:34,602 --> 00:51:43,619
Scott: It will make a hard drive, the entire hard drive, full of zeros or full of ones or whatever, and no way to figure out what those zeros or ones used to be in any point in time.

911
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:51,720
Rym: Yep, and of course, if you're working on, you know, Muggles PCs, it's a good idea to have a Windows 2000 and a Windows XP CD, just in case.

912
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,020
Scott: Ubuntu CDs, Knopik CDs, those are very useful.

913
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,040
Rym: Just have a CD binder full of stuff, flash drives full of stuff.

914
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:08,600
Scott: Yep, the most useful thing about a live CD, really, is just, you know, if their computer's broken, and you need to go on the internet to find some answers, the live CD's gonna be your only way unless they have two computers.

915
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,439
Scott: You know, a laptop is also a really good idea.

916
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:32,700
Scott: If someone has a computer that's not working, or maybe an internet connection that's not working, get a laptop with some Wi-Fi or some, you know, cell phone type wireless with some Evdu and a PCMCIA card, and that way, no matter what someone's situation is, you have a working computer that you can use to revive the other not working computer.

917
00:52:33,224 --> 00:52:37,979
Scott: It's very hard to fix a broken computer when you don't have a working computer to help you out.

918
00:52:38,562 --> 00:52:44,400
Rym: Yep, or not even a working computer, but at least a set of all the parts of a computer that are known good.

919
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:49,819
Rym: That way, you can play the process of elimination game where, "Well, I can't make that hard drive work.

920
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,679
Rym: Let me see if this hard drive works.

921
00:52:52,061 --> 00:52:52,585
Rym: Oh, it does!

922
00:52:53,028 --> 00:52:53,975
Rym: Mister, your hard drive's

923
00:52:54,016 --> 00:52:54,318
Rym: broken.".

924
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:55,629
Rym: Or, "Oh, it doesn't.

925
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:56,578
Rym: Maybe something else is

926
00:52:56,618 --> 00:52:56,780
Rym: wrong.".

927
00:52:57,421 --> 00:52:58,639
Scott: You know what else is really useful?

928
00:52:59,103 --> 00:53:00,240
Scott: A mouse and a keyboard.

929
00:53:00,522 --> 00:53:03,399
Rym: Yes, now, we fucked up once.

930
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,880
Scott: We fucked up a couple times.

931
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,611
Rym: Make sure that you bring along a USB mouse and keyboard and-- A PS/2 adapter.

932
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:19,020
Rym: Yes, because we went to Citicon with our Mac, and we were all happy, and we had this cheap keyboard and mouse that we just brought with us.

933
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:24,013
Rym: We get there, and we're about to set up our podcasting rig, and I go behind the Mac, and I just go,

934
00:53:24,355 --> 00:53:24,577
Rym: "Huh.".

935
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,696
Rym: And I go to Scott and say, "Scott, here, plug this

936
00:53:26,716 --> 00:53:27,059
Rym: keyboard.".

937
00:53:27,182 --> 00:53:27,776
Rym: And he's like, "What?

938
00:53:27,797 --> 00:53:27,879
Rym: Why?".

939
00:53:27,981 --> 00:53:29,033
Rym: And he goes down, and he goes,

940
00:53:29,094 --> 00:53:29,276
Rym: "Huh.".

941
00:53:30,442 --> 00:53:32,760
Rym: The Mac doesn't have a PS/2 port, anyway.

942
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,420
Scott: And we had a PS/2 keyboard.

943
00:53:34,761 --> 00:53:35,459
Rym: I could cry.

944
00:53:36,288 --> 00:53:36,373
Scott: Yeah.

945
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,120
Scott: So get a USB keyboard and USB mouse.

946
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,479
Scott: You can get really cheap ones.

947
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:45,019
Scott: And get the little-- the green adapters that turn USB into PS/2.

948
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,331
Scott: They're super cheap and common.

949
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:47,200
Scott: I have, like, a sack of them.

950
00:53:47,261 --> 00:53:48,099
Rym: Or the purple one.

951
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:49,272
Scott: Oh, the purple one.

952
00:53:49,374 --> 00:53:49,739
Scott: Ooh, yeah.

953
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:50,760
Scott: That's for the keyboard.

954
00:53:51,247 --> 00:53:51,720
Rym: Not that it matters.

955
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,640
Scott: The green one's for the mouse.

956
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:52,769
Rym: Yep.

957
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:53,169
Rym: Yeah.

958
00:53:54,621 --> 00:54:05,699
Rym: Now, I guess-- I mean, we've talked a bit here, but before we end, we are professionals, so maybe you'd like to hear-- I won't go into a lot of detail-- but the kind of stuff I carry around in the course of my daily duties at my job.

959
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:13,220
Rym: 'Cause I carry around a very specialized set of equipment far above and beyond anything the vast majority of you would ever need.

960
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,020
Rym: And in fact, I don't need most of this stuff in any of my non-work life ever.

961
00:54:17,941 --> 00:54:19,680
Rym: Of course, I carry everything we just talked about.

962
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,380
Rym: I have this gigantic briefcase.

963
00:54:21,941 --> 00:54:23,040
Rym: It's like-- God.

964
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,760
Rym: It's like a foot and a quarter wide and two feet wide the other way and two feet tall.

965
00:54:28,184 --> 00:54:29,719
Rym: It's this massive, heavy thing.

966
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:35,879
Rym: I carry around, like, a 1-meter, a 2-meter, and a 4-meter fiber cable with various connectors on the end.

967
00:54:36,521 --> 00:54:42,800
Rym: I carry around, like, four different lengths of Ethernet cable and a couple of crimpers and some crossover cables and all that stuff.

968
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,057
Scott: Oh, those are real useful, you know, to just--.

969
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,220
Scott: Hey, crap, I need another Ethernet cable.

970
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,534
Scott: 'cause someone wants me to hook up a router and they don't have an extra.

971
00:54:49,635 --> 00:54:49,858
Scott: Make one.

972
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:50,322
Rym: Yep.

973
00:54:50,464 --> 00:54:52,020
Rym: Or a recent incident.

974
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:57,040
Rym: Oh, we're hooking up two active devices, yet none of us have a crossover cable.

975
00:54:57,101 --> 00:54:58,180
Rym: Why isn't this working?

976
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:58,988
Rym: Help us, Rym.

977
00:54:59,191 --> 00:54:59,678
Rym: Help us.

978
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:00,915
Rym: Ha ha ha.

979
00:55:01,981 --> 00:55:02,920
Scott: I will just make one.

980
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:03,940
Scott: What's the colors again?

981
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:04,780
Scott: Bring a little guide.

982
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,519
Rym: White, orange, orange, white, green, blue, white, blue, green, white, and brown, brown is a B connector.

983
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:14,439
Scott: Yeah, if you can't remember the colors, like, Rym can remember the colors, bring a little piece of paper.

984
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,320
Rym: Don't worry about knowing those things.

985
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,180
Rym: Just print out a little thing and carry it on you.

986
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:18,700
Scott: That's what I said.

987
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,699
Rym: Yeah, because I know it 'cause I do it a lot, but you don't need to know it.

988
00:55:22,881 --> 00:55:25,159
Rym: And if I didn't have the job I have, I wouldn't know it.

989
00:55:25,543 --> 00:55:27,259
Scott: Have we had to look it up how many times at RIT?

990
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,007
Rym: God.

991
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:28,520
Scott: Every day?

992
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:30,720
Rym: In fact, I don't even need to know it at my current job.

993
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,837
Rym: I needed to know it at IBM.

994
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:34,400
Rym: I don't need to know it here because here we just buy cables.

995
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:35,899
Scott: Oh, that's no good.

996
00:55:36,483 --> 00:55:37,400
Rym: Eh, pros and cons.

997
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:37,820
Rym: Yeah.

998
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,620
Rym: But yeah, I carry around a full set of tools.

999
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:52,520
Rym: Now, when I say a full set of tools, I mean ranging from socket wrenches to hammers to power, everything, you know, for building server racks and putting together routers and UPSs and batteries.

1000
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:53,480
Scott: Oh, that reminds me.

1001
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,019
Scott: You know, you need cable ties.

1002
00:55:55,524 --> 00:55:57,060
Scott: Cable ties are real useful.

1003
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:04,020
Rym: Now, if you can afford it, this sounds silly, but they're actually expensive, your best bet is always Velcro.

1004
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,000
Scott: Velcro cable ties are like the sexiest cable ties you can get.

1005
00:56:08,346 --> 00:56:09,200
Rym: They're solid gold.

1006
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,960
Scott: Especially if you're even sexier, you can get multicolored labeling Velcro cable ties.

1007
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,640
Rym: Yeah, now I carry around approximately 50 to 100 feet of Velcro with me at all times.

1008
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:20,512
Rym: Mmm.

1009
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:26,700
Rym: It might be in the trunk of my car or in one of my other duty bags, but I have it available 'cause that stuff's handy.

1010
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,960
Rym: I also carry around some very interesting things.

1011
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:35,720
Rym: I carry around a fluke, which is basically a super, super, super cable tester.

1012
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:39,040
Rym: It also is a toner, so I can figure out where a cable goes.

1013
00:56:39,882 --> 00:56:41,800
Rym: I carry around two different labelers.

1014
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,740
Rym: I mean, it doesn't matter so much in your house.

1015
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,540
Rym: You know, you don't need to label-- You could use the cheap labeler from Staples.

1016
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:49,317
Scott: That's like 20 bucks.

1017
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,260
Rym: Yeah, but even then, you don't need to label your computer my computer.

1018
00:56:52,381 --> 00:56:53,420
Rym: You know it's your computer.

1019
00:56:53,521 --> 00:56:54,838
Rym: You know which computer it is.

1020
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:59,640
Rym: You don't suddenly forget, "Oh, is this my computer sitting on my desk with my porn on

1021
00:56:59,660 --> 00:56:59,700
Rym: it?".

1022
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:04,279
Scott: Yeah, you don't suddenly forget, "Hey, which video cable coming out of my computer is the video

1023
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:04,480
Scott: cable?".

1024
00:57:05,361 --> 00:57:06,820
Scott: Let me label it video cable.

1025
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,539
Rym: Yep, so I carry around a normal, you know, actually a normal Circuit City whatever brother labeler.

1026
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,720
Rym: And I label the fronts of servers and switches and whatever.

1027
00:57:16,702 --> 00:57:17,574
Rym: But that's whatever.

1028
00:57:17,594 --> 00:57:18,000
Rym: That's nothing.

1029
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,180
Rym: I also carry around a Brady labeler.

1030
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,753
Rym: Now, this thing was like 500 bucks.

1031
00:57:23,421 --> 00:57:28,020
Rym: It's good God, but it looks like a heavy duty piece of equipment.

1032
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,340
Rym: It's like super awesome construction yellow with shock mounts.

1033
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,660
Rym: It takes these gigantic cartridges of all different kinds of labels.

1034
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:43,320
Rym: You know if you look in like a plumber's closet or like at a gas station, like a power station or some kind of industry thing.

1035
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,960
Rym: You see those gigantic like fancy labels on like gas pipes and oxygen pipes and all that.

1036
00:57:49,761 --> 00:57:53,520
Rym: This is the machine, pretty much the only one that people use to make those things.

1037
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,157
Scott: So that's what it is.

1038
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,780
Rym: Yeah, and I have all the different kinds of labels.

1039
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:01,780
Rym: I have ones that will resist acid, ones that will go outside, whatever.

1040
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:05,798
Rym: Very cool are the ones that I use on, like say I'm doing a...

1041
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,680
Scott: Do you ever use the ones that resist acid?

1042
00:58:08,442 --> 00:58:10,739
Rym: No, I just have them because I have a bunch of cartridges.

1043
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,640
Scott: One day you're going to have to label a computer in an acid bath.

1044
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,059
Scott: You're going to use those.

1045
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:17,060
Rym: Actually that would have been handy at IBM.

1046
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:18,660
Scott: Oh man, scary.

1047
00:58:19,301 --> 00:58:21,380
Rym: Yeah, IBM was actually a scary place to work sometimes.

1048
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,800
Rym: I mean I'd be next... There was a vat of a fucking deadly chemical.

1049
00:58:26,263 --> 00:58:27,720
Rym: Like touches me, I'm dead.

1050
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,296
Rym: Cancer.

1051
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:32,359
Rym: There was a vat bigger than our house, full of it.

1052
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:37,320
Rym: And there were like these double walls and this retaining pool around it in case it broke or something.

1053
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:40,660
Scott: At least you got some safety there so you'd be able to run away if something happened.

1054
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,220
Rym: But just every day if I went into that part of the factory I'd walk by it.

1055
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,512
Rym: I'd always just kind of look at it like...

1056
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:49,451
Scott: I would also go... I would walk fast.

1057
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,179
Rym: Of course then there were the Tachikomas and I'd totally forget and play with them.

1058
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:53,656
Rym: Yeah.

1059
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,199
Rym: No really, we had these little robots but...

1060
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,319
Scott: Yeah, they weren't Tachikomas.

1061
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,200
Rym: No, but they were as close to a Tachikoma as we've gotten in this world.

1062
00:59:00,721 --> 00:59:02,340
Scott: I think there's better out there, but anyway.

1063
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:02,820
Rym: Yeah.

1064
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:07,900
Rym: Alright, but this labeler will also make self-laminating cable labels.

1065
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,960
Rym: So say you got a switch or a router with like a thousand cables coming out of it.

1066
00:59:12,321 --> 00:59:17,200
Rym: They're all labeled with this fancy little labeler that makes these awesome little self-laminating wrap around a cable.

1067
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,540
Rym: Everything's repeated, perfect label.

1068
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,860
Scott: So some guy comes along and he goes "hehehehe" and he unplugs every cable from the router.

1069
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:29,580
Scott: And the cables go like to another room somewhere and there's no way to tell which cable goes to which computer somewhere else.

1070
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:33,020
Scott: They're all labeled so you can just pick them up and put them back in the switch and you're all good.

1071
00:59:33,381 --> 00:59:42,120
Rym: Yep, or more likely if I'm fixing a problem that got caused somehow and I'm unplugging a bunch of stuff in order to diagnose it.

1072
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,739
Rym: And then now I'm done and I gotta plug all that stuff back in.

1073
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:45,820
Scott: Yeah.

1074
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,320
Rym: I mean, it's real easy to unplug something and not know where to put it.

1075
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:51,980
Scott: Hey, I'm here standing holding 50 blue cables.

1076
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:56,300
Scott: I don't know where they go, I can't pull them out, I can't possibly find the other end.

1077
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,319
Scott: There is no way to do that, it would take hours.

1078
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:02,399
Scott: When they have to go back in the right holes on this box.

1079
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:02,877
Rym: Yep.

1080
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,552
Scott: Oh gee, there are 25 times 25 possible combinations.

1081
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,060
Rym: And of course, last and not least, other than, you know, I carry a bunch of weird stuff around.

1082
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,100
Rym: Like a tile puller to pull tiles up in a data center, raised floor and all that.

1083
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:25,360
Rym: But I've got this little metal bit that I got from someone who got it from one of the HP contractors who came in and installed a server rack one time.

1084
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:29,480
Rym: I don't know if anyone out there has ever worked with modern server racks.

1085
01:00:30,103 --> 01:00:33,700
Rym: But essentially they're these little square bits that you put screws into.

1086
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,260
Rym: And you stick these bits at the rack elevations where you want to install your servers.

1087
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,080
Rym: It's a pain in the ass to install these things in anything.

1088
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:46,059
Rym: And you basically have to sit there crying trying to use a pair of pliers to manhandle the thing in.

1089
01:00:46,721 --> 01:00:48,019
Rym: I have this little bent piece of metal.

1090
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,319
Rym: And with that, I can put a hundred of them in in the time it'll take someone with a pair of pliers to put one in.

1091
01:00:54,146 --> 01:00:54,419
Scott: Awesome.

1092
01:00:55,081 --> 01:01:03,039
Rym: And if you ever, ever end up working with any HP person who is building a rack for you, ask them if you can have one of their little thingies.

1093
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,799
Rym: And they'll know exactly what you're talking about and they'll give you one.

1094
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:08,339
Scott: Ooh, handy trick.

1095
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,339
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

1096
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:13,160
Scott: Who else makes rack mount stuff that you might need to ask for a different metal thingy?

1097
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,080
Rym: Actually, IBM, pretty much racks are standard.

1098
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:21,440
Rym: IBM uses a different metal thing that's far more complicated, but serves the same purpose.

1099
01:01:21,904 --> 01:01:22,075
Scott: Okay.

1100
01:01:23,062 --> 01:01:29,440
Scott: I've never actually mounted anything in a rack, even though I've... Well, no, I've mounted ATX mid-towers in racks.

1101
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:31,779
Rym: See, it's weird.

1102
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:37,200
Rym: Like, we've... Scott's... I've mostly worked... In fact, I've only ever worked at monolithic, gigantic companies.

1103
01:01:38,143 --> 01:01:40,160
Rym: And Scott's only worked at very small companies.

1104
01:01:40,342 --> 01:01:42,400
Rym: And we both make the same amount of money.

1105
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,340
Rym: It's just totally different work environments.

1106
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,065
Scott: Yep.

1107
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,420
Rym: Like, you'll write code for a server.

1108
01:01:47,902 --> 01:01:50,618
Rym: And I'll have to install, like, a hundred UPS's.

1109
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:51,459
Scott: Haha.

1110
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:52,920
Rym: That sucked.

1111
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:53,549
Scott: Yep.

1112
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:54,639
Rym: That really sucked.

1113
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,420
Scott: How much did it suck?

1114
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:57,917
Rym: You know how much a UPS weighs?

1115
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,059
Scott: Oh, that reminds me of something else you need to bring with you.

1116
01:02:00,481 --> 01:02:01,720
Scott: A freakin' power strip.

1117
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:02,479
Scott: Good God.

1118
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:02,728
Rym: Yes!

1119
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:05,260
Rym: Bring a power strip with you everywhere you go for the rest of your life.

1120
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,080
Rym: Even if it's a shitty two dollar one.

1121
01:02:07,441 --> 01:02:07,756
Scott: Bring it.

1122
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:12,639
Rym: Yeah, you will never have enough power outlets unless you build a house that has nothing but power outlets.

1123
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,164
Scott: Yeah, you'll go to someone's house, you'll be like, "Oh yeah, can you do something to my

1124
01:02:16,205 --> 01:02:16,599
Scott: computer?".

1125
01:02:16,884 --> 01:02:17,190
Scott: "Oh yeah,

1126
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:17,413
Scott: sure.".

1127
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:22,940
Scott: "Oh look, there's enough outlets, but you have these giant AC adapters and I can only use three outlets.

1128
01:02:23,481 --> 01:02:24,696
Scott: I wish I had another power

1129
01:02:24,716 --> 01:02:24,999
Scott: strip.".

1130
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:31,200
Rym: God, there was that one year, way back, we all went to the shore with our friend Scott Johnson and his family's awesome beach house.

1131
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:32,659
Rym: So we're all hanging out there.

1132
01:02:33,121 --> 01:02:33,718
Rym: We're all geeks.

1133
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:38,360
Rym: We all bring, like, three or four things each that need to be recharged.

1134
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:42,100
Scott: I had an iPod, a cell phone, a DS, and a laptop.

1135
01:02:42,744 --> 01:02:43,800
Scott: And I brought a power strip.

1136
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:46,599
Rym: So multiply that by everyone in the crew who was there.

1137
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:50,179
Rym: And there aren't enough outlets on that island for all of us.

1138
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,319
Scott: Let alone- I brought a power strip for me.

1139
01:02:53,721 --> 01:02:54,878
Rym: I brought a power strip for me.

1140
01:02:55,401 --> 01:02:57,619
Scott: And people who didn't, it sucked for them.

1141
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:00,860
Rym: Yeah, you generally want to bring a power strip everywhere you go.

1142
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,879
Scott: Lots of cell phone power swapping going on.

1143
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:06,260
Scott: People who had the same cell phone kind of benefited.

1144
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:09,940
Scott: And, you know, everyone has a DS and the DS chargers are all the same.

1145
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:10,292
Rym: Yup.

1146
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:11,871
Scott: Oh, except people with DS lights.

1147
01:03:11,931 --> 01:03:12,820
Scott: I think is different, isn't it?

1148
01:03:12,921 --> 01:03:13,217
Scott: Or is it?

1149
01:03:13,603 --> 01:03:14,078
Rym: I don't even know.

1150
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:15,539
Scott: I'll get one one day.

1151
01:03:15,741 --> 01:03:17,720
Rym: I'd assume it is, just because Nintendo's that way.

1152
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,180
Scott: I don't know, I think they actually changed it on this one.

1153
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:20,560
Scott: I'm not sure.

1154
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:21,680
Rym: No, I mean, I'd assume it is different.

1155
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:22,158
Scott: Oh, okay.

1156
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:22,760
Rym: That's where I was going.

1157
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:24,580
Scott: Well, the SP and the DS have the same one.

1158
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,380
Scott: But the micro has a different one.

1159
01:03:26,561 --> 01:03:28,860
Scott: And I don't even think the light is the same as the micro.

1160
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:30,139
Scott: We gotta check on that.

1161
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:30,999
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

1162
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:31,578
Rym: I don't even know.

1163
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:32,898
Scott: Someone will tell us.

1164
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,140
Rym: 'Cause the thing is, Nintendo's got me by the balls.

1165
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:38,020
Rym: And if I want their product, I'll just buy it and take it like a man.

1166
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:38,486
Scott: Yeah.

1167
01:03:39,063 --> 01:03:39,212
Scott: Oh well.

1168
01:03:40,281 --> 01:03:42,880
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's been a DS flood, but that's not what we're gonna talk about.

1169
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,019
Rym: God, I still, as much as cool as the Wii is, I've played the DS more still.

1170
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:47,600
Scott: At least right now I am.

1171
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:51,380
Scott: There's been like three DS games in rapid, four DS games in rapid succession.

1172
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,599
Rym: Alright, on that note, I gotta solve the mystery of who shot that guy.

1173
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,100
Scott: And I have to go hit a lot of monsters with swords.

1174
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:07,850
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1175
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:10,430
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1176
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:22,350
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

1177
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:28,589
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1178
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:39,250
Rym: Mondays are science and technology, Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs, Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1179
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:47,729
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

1180
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:51,290
Scott: Just click the link that says "Send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

1181
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:56,809
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

1182
01:04:57,070 --> 01:05:00,150
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website which has everything.

01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:13,270
Scott: This means you can do whatever you want with it, as long as you give us credit, don't make money, and share it in kind.

1185
01:05:14,134 --> 01:05:17,610
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1186
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:21,150
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
