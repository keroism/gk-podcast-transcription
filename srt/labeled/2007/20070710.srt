1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:02,584
Scott: Wow today.

2
00:00:02,604 --> 00:00:07,900
Scott: I've said it before but it's true today is the hottest goddamn day.

3
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:09,204
Rym: warm today.

4
00:00:09,224 --> 00:00:10,630
Scott: it's very warm today.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,934
Scott: it's intolerably warm.

6
00:00:11,954 --> 00:00:12,938
Scott: I got home.

7
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,425
Scott: my tomato was falling over.

8
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:21,052
Scott: I had to go to Home Depot and get some sticks to hold the tomato up and everything I work.

9
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:21,935
Scott: I didn't every work to do.

10
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:24,085
Scott: I sat there bored for six hours.

11
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:27,783
Rym: meanwhile I'm just exhausted and this tetanus shot is not doing me any favors.

12
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:31,800
Rym: I gotta say yeah it basically everything sucks except bacon.

13
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:40,622
Scott: yes not everything sucks bacon and everything does not suck but it's con season.

14
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:44,437
Scott: real soon this weekend begins the onslaught of doom.

15
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:46,166
Rym: yeah we'll have a normal episode tomorrow.

16
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:46,749
Rym: don't worry about.

17
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:48,779
Scott: yes and stuff is bothering us now.

18
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:55,903
Scott: so today we're just gonna do a special episode like 10 minutes or not very long episode.

19
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,150
Scott: this is a special episode.

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,186
Rym: in fact this is I want to point out this might be one step below a special.

21
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,175
Rym: this might be a flash whoa.

22
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:03,421
Rym: anyway continue what.

23
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:09,153
Scott: yeah I would you say if you have never listened to GeekNights before this is not a normal episode of GeekNights.

24
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:15,673
Scott: this is a Rym and Scott are really tired and lazy episode of GeekNights but we still want to put something in the feed so we don't look like shit talker.

25
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:16,599
Rym: you see the words.

26
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,382
Rym: the assholes the word special for us means Rym and Scott are too lazy to do a real show.

27
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:22,347
Scott: think of it this way.

28
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:27,490
Scott: you know sometimes a webcomic artist puts up like just a pencil sketch without any words or colors.

29
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:32,266
Scott: this is it's basically a dead dead Rym and Scott day.

30
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,976
Rym: yep so I need to go to sleep.

31
00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:36,664
Scott: there's no news there's no things of the day.

32
00:01:36,684 --> 00:01:37,731
Rym: well there's a ton of news.

33
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:39,483
Rym: I really want to talk about it kind of news.

34
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:41,857
Rym: I want to talk about the PlayStation 3 price draw.

35
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:42,884
Scott: I don't care about that.

36
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:46,327
Rym: I care about that because I want to tell everyone it doesn't freaking matter yeah whatever.

37
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:48,255
Rym: anyway forget all that.

38
00:01:48,336 --> 00:01:49,260
Scott: get all that bullshit.

39
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:54,787
Scott: we're just gonna talk about a happy little game that everyone well I guess maybe some people should play.

40
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:56,476
Rym: I'm actually really sour on the game.

41
00:01:56,536 --> 00:01:59,454
Scott: yeah I was really hot on it and then I was really sour.

42
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:06,665
Scott: the game we're gonna talk about today is a nice happy little non collectible car game called chrono knots from looney labs.

43
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,876
Rym: looney labs makes a lot of fun little things.

44
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,322
Scott: looney labs they make the flux.

45
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:12,510
Scott: they make the nano fictionary.

46
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:16,062
Scott: they make Aquarius which I have.

47
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:17,367
Scott: they make chrono knots.

48
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:28,786
Scott: of course they make a bunch of fun little games and the themes of these games are really fun and the games are really fun and I've heard that the people who make the games are really cool and I would not doubt that for a second.

49
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:32,104
Rym: so chrono knots which we're gonna talk about very briefly.

50
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:32,748
Rym: in some.

51
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:42,058
Rym: the way the game works is you lay out the history of the world in cards many of which can be flipped over the history of the modern world like it starts in the late 1800s and goes all the way up to like the 80s.

52
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,986
Rym: in the 90s yeah it's like you know World War one World War two and all that up until nuclear bombs.

53
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:49,011
Rym: yeah near like.

54
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:54,314
Scott: the events near the end are like you know Challenger exploding and World War three stuff like that.

55
00:02:54,575 --> 00:03:01,994
Rym: right now you all play as travelers and the thing is there's a bunch of different travelers they all have different goals and every player gets a different one.

56
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:08,645
Scott: secretly yes the story is that there are many different universes and in each universe history happened differently.

57
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:14,674
Scott: you know in one universe there was a nuclear explosion in World War two like on London or so.

58
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:20,082
Scott: I'm just making stuff up because I don't really remember the details like in another universe the Lusitania didn't sink right.

59
00:03:20,664 --> 00:03:29,822
Scott: so you're a time traveler and this you're in a universe with a bunch of other people and everyone sort of shares the same universe this row of cards.

60
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:43,477
Scott: it's actually a grid of cards and everyone on their turn attempts to manipulate all the cards on the board in such a way that your universe the universe that you the traveler are from is the one that comes to be.

61
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:51,446
Scott: for example if you are squadron's the cockroach from the future you want World War three to happen now.

62
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:53,576
Scott: that's the only way in which you can exist.

63
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:53,938
Rym: now.

64
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:57,724
Rym: there's two really cool things about this game and one effect that you all have a secret mission.

65
00:03:57,764 --> 00:03:58,733
Rym: you don't know what everyone else's me.

66
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:00,486
Scott: yeah you don't know what the other people are trying to do.

67
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:03,322
Scott: you just know that the other people are trying to do something.

68
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,612
Scott: that's not what you're trying to do.

69
00:04:04,632 --> 00:04:07,187
Rym: so there can be a lot of bluffing and a lot of stuff like that.

70
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:12,113
Rym: yeah I believe it's a complete information game but not a perfect information game.

71
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:15,010
Scott: yes you you don't know what other people have in their hands.

72
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:16,378
Rym: is the thing something like that?

73
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,587
Rym: I might have gotten the terminology wrong.

74
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:17,969
Rym: it's late.

75
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,163
Rym: yes I'll talk about game theory another time.

76
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:22,695
Scott: basically you have a deck of cards.

77
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:25,466
Scott: you put out the history of the world and you set it to the default.

78
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:34,342
Scott: true I guess true history right and everyone has some cards and on your turn you sort of draw and play cards and the cards do things.

79
00:04:34,402 --> 00:04:38,222
Scott: some cards let you draw more cards some cards let you alter the history.

80
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:39,991
Scott: some cards are artifacts.

81
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:40,393
Scott: you can.

82
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:46,864
Scott: you can get like collections of artifacts to do cool things like if you get all the Mona Lisa's you might be able to win or something like that.

83
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:50,555
Scott: you know and you can.

84
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:54,188
Scott: on the board there are two types of cards in the history.

85
00:04:54,229 --> 00:05:00,757
Scott: there are lynchpin events in history and there are just normal events and the way it works is the lynchpins.

86
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:02,444
Scott: you flip them over right.

87
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:18,048
Scott: so let's say the Lusitania sinking let's say I flip that over I look on the board and there's a cool system with these various symbols and I'm like okay if the Lusitania didn't sink then that means that this card over here about World War one.

88
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,123
Scott: we're gonna flip that over and it turns into like a paradox card.

89
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:45,366
Scott: right and basically you try to you know someone else might need that card to not be a paradox or maybe they have a card in their hand that says you know I don't know Archduke Ferdinand not assassinated kills assassin right but they can't play that card unless the card that's currently occupying the spot is set to paradox.

90
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:52,970
Rym: you see what I'm saying I don't know if I'm explaining it that basically you manipulate history to change the configuration of the board and everything has far-reaching consequences.

91
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:59,282
Rym: and once the board is in the configuration of your players victory condition you win immediately in the games over.

92
00:05:59,383 --> 00:06:06,131
Scott: yeah so it's kind of a fun game because the actual theme of the game is hilarious if you've never played it before.

93
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:10,352
Scott: I mean yes the text on the character cards is funny the artifacts are funny.

94
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:15,538
Scott: the different historical situations that can come up are funny like oh man look at that.

95
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:20,863
Scott: there's a history in which John Lennon wasn't assassinated and now he's protesting the space shuttle.

96
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:22,551
Scott: oh man that's hilarious.

97
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:25,788
Rym: now the other neat thing is that we talked about those paradoxes.

98
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:27,742
Rym: there are two interesting things that can happen in the game.

99
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:33,569
Rym: one if too many paradoxes appear on the board and no one fixes him the world ends and everyone loses.

100
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:40,442
Scott: yeah unless you there's one person one character where if you have that character you win in that situation now I do.

101
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:52,426
Rym: if there if you set the history up a certain way World War three happens and then there is just no history beyond that point yep it's pretty cool when that happens actually.

102
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:53,290
Rym: so the game.

103
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:54,295
Rym: I highly recommend.

104
00:06:54,315 --> 00:07:02,301
Rym: playing this game at a con with someone else who owns it with a bunch of people who collectively have never played it before yeah it'll be hilarious if you've never played it before.

105
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:03,487
Scott: the thing is like guillotine.

106
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:04,833
Scott: yes these games.

107
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:06,562
Scott: it's a non collectible card game.

108
00:07:06,582 --> 00:07:15,113
Scott: it's a game that's just a deck of cards and an instruction book and you don't have to collect anything even though there is an expansion and it's like about 10 15 bucks something like that.

109
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:23,167
Scott: it's actually a pretty big deck of cards but you're only gonna play it so many times before you're bored of it and you don't really play it again.

110
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:30,680
Rym: yeah because the humor runs out and once you strip the humor in the theme away it's a fairly straightforward manipulation game.

111
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:42,250
Scott: yeah the game pretty much comes down to you know everyone is manipulating this shared resource to try to configure it the way they want and basically whoever wins comes down to what cards you draw.

112
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:47,737
Scott: you know what you draw the cards that allow you to switch the board to be the way you want then you win.

113
00:07:48,079 --> 00:08:00,061
Rym: it's a simplified version of let's say you had a game where four people take turns making one move on a Rubik's Cube and everyone has a secret configuration that if the cube looks like that they win yep and you just go around until someone makes it.

114
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:02,209
Scott: yep that's pretty much what it is.

115
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:04,396
Rym: so don't buy the game.

116
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,741
Rym: I really I like it.

117
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:11,651
Rym: I like looney labs but it's not really that worth buying unless you're the kind of person who tends to have people over.

118
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:12,616
Rym: aren't so into gaming?

119
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:17,768
Rym: or you meet new people all the time and you want something you can whip out that will entertain them quickly and easily.

120
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:22,051
Scott: yeah definitely good for the families and the kids and that sort of thing.

121
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:22,293
Scott: you know.

122
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:26,438
Scott: you just whip this thing out with some people who aren't necessary for gamers that care about gaming.

123
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,889
Rym: this isn't gonna do it for you you know except unless if you're at an Akan with friends and you've never played this before.

124
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:33,601
Rym: it is really fun the first couple time it is.

125
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,645
Scott: it's really fun a bunch of times until you've seen every all the content and that the humor is gone.

126
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:43,950
Scott: but it's really good for entertaining normal people and it's actually looney labs.

127
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:56,229
Scott: games are a really great gateway into getting normal people to sort of slide them on in because you can slide them from looney labs over to like Steve Jackson games and then once you're in Steve Jackson games you can go just about anywhere.

128
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,146
Scott: you know but yeah I don't know it's it's worth it.

129
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:06,457
Scott: ten bucks fifteen bucks for some people not for others and it's grown or not you can get it just about anywhere.

130
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:13,156
Scott: oh it's also good filler like if you're having a big gaming night and in between some big heavy games you can whip this out for just like a quick little.

131
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:15,269
Scott: you know refresh it's good for that.

132
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,925
Rym: it's also good if you got too many people over to all play one game.

133
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,580
Rym: everyone who's not hardcore can just play this and have fun.

134
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,168
Rym: while the other ball though I don't want to say well the men are playing their family game because they're definitely not true.

135
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:32,065
Rym: but more if you're not like if you don't care about board games to the kind of freakish level that we care about board game and you

136
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:37,774
Scott: want to play a game that's not a typical American game and you know you want to have something that's got a lot of humor in it.

137
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:39,945
Scott: it's way to go right.

138
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:44,205
Rym: so on that note stay tuned tomorrow night when we'll be back to our regularly scheduled GeekNights.

139
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:45,952
Rym: but I'm going to bed.

140
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:49,679
Scott: I'm going maybe take a shower and then go to bed madness.
