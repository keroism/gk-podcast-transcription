1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,157
Scott: It's Monday November 12th.

2
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:12,080
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,127
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:14,930
Scott: tonight.

5
00:00:15,413 --> 00:00:18,389
Scott: I teach you about surround sound because you don't know shit about it.

6
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,397
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:31,109
Rym: Well, we finally did it.

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,010
Rym: This has been a long time coming Scott and I have been debating this for many years even back before it was an option.

9
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:38,856
Scott: We probably should have done it earlier.

10
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:42,670
Rym: I wish I'd done it earlier, but I guess the stars were in line.

11
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:44,236
Rym: We kind of randomly decided.

12
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:47,409
Rym: All right, let's uh, actually go there and do it.

13
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:49,497
Rym: But we weren't sure if we were gonna do it.

14
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:54,738
Rym: We went there and we were just thinking all right, we'll look We'll uh, we'll touch.

15
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:56,425
Rym: I don't know if we'll actually go all the way.

16
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:57,430
Rym: I had looked and touched.

17
00:00:57,711 --> 00:00:59,198
Scott: I had looked and touched previously.

18
00:00:59,218 --> 00:01:00,102
Scott: I did not to look.

19
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:01,830
Scott: I did not need to look and touch again.

20
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:03,040
Scott: I had already been there.

21
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:04,209
Scott: It was not a new experience.

22
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,825
Rym: I touched one of these before but the other one I'd never actually experienced it.

23
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,470
Rym: once I actually felt it against my back.

24
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,150
Rym: It was it was fantastic.

25
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:20,130
Scott: Well, there was one that I experienced for a short time But there was another one that I experienced for a very very long stint, you know, perhaps over a year.

26
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:22,975
Rym: I think it's a good idea that you got that extender at the top.

27
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:25,620
Scott: Yeah, the extension at the top definitely helped out.

28
00:01:31,494 --> 00:01:33,150
Scott: I wouldn't laugh if it wasn't contagious.

29
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,108
Rym: I'll have you okay?

30
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:42,125
Rym: so Scott and I Finally went and bought real office chairs.

31
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:43,570
Rym: I wouldn't even use the word chair.

32
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,937
Rym: I think at this point throne is appropriate.

33
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:47,582
Scott: I think throne is appropriate.

34
00:01:47,602 --> 00:01:53,467
Scott: I mean until I can't get my business hammock from Scorpio, so this is I guess second best.

35
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:59,918
Rym: Yeah, I'll just we started laughing because Emily is our studio audience and she lost it.

36
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,280
Scott: She definitely lost it.

37
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:10,259
Rym: But Seriously, so I bought not the old Aeron chair, but the new Aeron chair like the newest fanciest Aeron.

38
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,280
Scott: I didn't even realize that the Aeron chair was updated like when I worked at that.

39
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,127
Scott: You know middle of nowhere office that I quit.

40
00:02:16,248 --> 00:02:18,015
Scott: they had a bunch of Aeron chairs there and I could.

41
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:24,146
Scott: they were like more Aeron chairs than people, you know, there's one person and like 20 chairs, but they were.

42
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:29,847
Scott: I didn't realize at the time like I sent him they weren't so great, you know I mean they were great best chair.

43
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:32,680
Scott: I had sat in up till then but not amazing great.

44
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:39,600
Rym: I mean I'd sat in him before too and I remember always thinking it's real good, but it's not a thousand dollars good, right?

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,181
Scott: Well, actually those at the time I think they were $800.

46
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:53,763
Scott: But the point is is that I didn't realize that that chair that I had was the lowest end oldest version Aeron chair and nowadays they have Posture fit.

47
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:58,940
Scott: they have a much updated much newer version much higher end Aeron chair with more features.

48
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,261
Scott: So we

49
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:00,265
Rym: went to Sam flax

50
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:04,080
Scott: and flax if you don't know is basically staples, but fancy

51
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:12,555
Rym: Let me put it to you this way, you know when you go to staples you find some like pimply 18 year old And you're like, hey, I want that office chair that $80 office chair.

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,980
Rym: Bring me a box and then an hour later they stumble out with it here.

53
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:20,960
Rym: It was like we had a basically a personal salesman.

54
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,129
Rym: It was a lot like buying a car.

55
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:23,560
Scott: He's definitely making a big Commission.

56
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,823
Scott: I think that helped his enthusiasm But he just.

57
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:31,976
Rym: it was very interesting to be serviced with that level of just what I mean.

58
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:33,600
Rym: would sir like to try this?

59
00:03:34,242 --> 00:03:39,560
Scott: And if I could do a whole Thursday episode about the the degradation of customer service in the retail industry?

60
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:46,100
Scott: But I'll just keep it at this when I was a kid a kid like three years old My mom would take me to the mall right the same mall.

61
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,371
Scott: But now is just a crap hole crap mall.

62
00:03:49,014 --> 00:04:04,560
Scott: and there was a shoe store there I think was Buster Brown and I would go there and this old man who was the cool old shoe, man he would measure my foot and he would pick a shoe that he said thought would be good for my foot and he would put it on my foot and then I'd walk Around and he'd be like, huh?

63
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:14,520
Scott: and he would actually try to sell us the shoe and he'd be real nice and he'd put it in a box and he'd take My old shoes and take care of them and he'd see put the laces in and it was his level of service.

64
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:17,653
Rym: I mean go you'd go to the Disney Store in the mall.

65
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:19,019
Rym: There'd be animatronics.

66
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:26,541
Rym: Yeah people would be dressed up at the mall and all the stores would have very helpful people standing at the door welcoming you selling you Things.

67
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:33,431
Rym: if I went to the gap or whatever place you buy clothes from nowadays punk kids There'd be a salesperson who would recommend things.

68
00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:40,160
Scott: Yep, then one day I went to buy shoes and there were just boxes of shoes sitting there and I was like what the fuck is this?

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,591
Scott: is someone gonna come and measure my foot?

70
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:43,905
Scott: and That was the end.

71
00:04:43,945 --> 00:04:46,695
Scott: and from then on I just had to get used to the fact that.

72
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:51,280
Scott: well and I did eventually get used To the fact that I look at the shoe is on this display.

73
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:55,307
Scott: I have to find a box in my size instead of saying hey Do you have this in my size?

74
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:57,279
Scott: go in the back and find it for me, you know?

75
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,220
Scott: And I find it in my size and to try them on myself figure it out myself some place.

76
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,099
Scott: mostly don't even have the frickin measuring things out there right and it sucks.

77
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:13,700
Scott: and Then in New York City, I went to buy shoes, you know Like three years ago because I had to you know dress up for that job.

78
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:17,967
Scott: I quit when I when I did work in the city and said the middle of no Did you dress up just for the day?

79
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,777
Rym: you quit like you come in in a suit and tie?

80
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:29,475
Scott: Yeah, I quit yeah, but I Went to floor chime I think which is you know in a shoe store a men's shoe store.

81
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:31,000
Scott: Well, mostly a men's shoe store.

82
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:39,660
Scott: Well, yeah, that's the handbag Yeah and the old man Measured my foot and he went in the back and he got the size and he did the whole thing and he was talking it.

83
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:50,654
Scott: And I'm like, wow this level of service still exists in New York City in the city where things are priced higher and People demand a higher level of service.

84
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:51,459
Scott: and I'm saying, huh?

85
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,617
Scott: it's sort of worth it to pay more to get the service that I demand.

86
00:05:56,677 --> 00:05:58,785
Scott: that I Became unused to that.

87
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:02,600
Scott: now realized that I miss and I want plus.

88
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:05,397
Rym: I mean I sat down in one of the normal Aeron chairs.

89
00:06:05,457 --> 00:06:08,832
Rym: I'm like, alright This is I don't know if I want to spend $900 on a chair.

90
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:09,193
Rym: This is nice.

91
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:14,079
Rym: I like the mesh because my butt won't sweat when I'm doing the show.

92
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:19,886
Rym: But at the same time it wasn't like this revelation It wasn't some sort of transcendent experience.

93
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:32,380
Rym: and then it's pointed out to me that the Aeron chair next to that one is the new Model the newest model the fanciest one that exists and I sat in it and it was like a completely different chair.

94
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:32,621
Rym: It was

95
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:40,285
Scott: totally different like I had sat in an Aeron chair for months and months and months like every day and I sat in That new one and I was like, whoa This one is totally different

96
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:45,372
Rym: and the guy was showing me how to work it and the different angles and the way it floats And the way it works and it.

97
00:06:45,453 --> 00:06:48,689
Scott: there was very One thing that really turned me away from that chair.

98
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,115
Scott: that was how complicated it was.

99
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:51,500
Scott: You keep manipulating all the levers.

100
00:06:51,520 --> 00:07:00,675
Rym: that's fine though because there's two position two basic states that are easy to switch between the sitting and typing and the front five degrees elevated.

101
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:02,060
Rym: that apparently will like it'll.

102
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,505
Rym: It's great for podcasting.

103
00:07:03,545 --> 00:07:04,107
Rym: What can I say?

104
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:04,308
Scott: Yeah.

105
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:05,412
Scott: Well, you're Herman Miller.

106
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:11,864
Scott: Aeron chair might have two states but my human scale freedom chair has infinity state.

107
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:17,725
Rym: now Scott way back and always talked about this freedom chair and You know the head of there.

108
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:28,100
Rym: and the thing is there's the normal freedom chair and then there's the one With the headrest and the headrest adds like a hundred to two hundred dollars to the price It has like 150 dollars, but you can't add the headrest later.

109
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,800
Scott: So you have to decide when you buy it if it's headrest or no head rest.

110
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:34,614
Scott: I'd always thought other things like the gel seat and the gel armrest.

111
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:38,463
Scott: you can change later, but not I was like $150 for a headrest.

112
00:07:39,004 --> 00:07:44,708
Rym: what the balls but I sat down in it before Scott did and Let me tell you that headrest.

113
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:53,560
Rym: I I don't know how we did it But like I leaned back and it would move Differently from the rest of the chair and I was always comfortable no matter what position I was in.

114
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:02,720
Scott: It was I think the reason I like the freedom chair the most over the Aeron chair is that basically I like to sit You know in in weird ways my posture sucks, but I like it.

115
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:02,941
Scott: It's.

116
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:07,660
Scott: I'm very comfortable when something is pressing against my back called lumbar support, right?

117
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,120
Scott: Well, no, I mean like my entire back all the because the lumbar is key for me, right?

118
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,065
Scott: So it is key.

119
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:15,158
Scott: everyone's all the chairs have that if they're worth a shit.

120
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:24,080
Scott: But you know what I would do a previous jobs is I would put the armrest of the chair up on the desk Right to sort of keep the chair in a reclined position.

121
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:25,545
Scott: That I was always.

122
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:29,679
Scott: gravity was always pulling me into the back of the seat to us to put pressure on my back.

123
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,890
Scott: the freedom chair has very few levers.

124
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,913
Scott: that has an up-down lever and you can move these the Pad of you know the seat pad forward and back, right?

125
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:41,565
Scott: I'll probably put it all the way back Other than that.

126
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:49,025
Scott: Oh, you can also move the armrests around but other than those three things There are no other levers on the chair but it just moves.

127
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:50,169
Rym: you just move.

128
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:53,380
Scott: you just move the way you want to move to get in the position you want to be.

129
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,575
Scott: And the whole chair moves with you and is applying constant pressure to my entire back.

130
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:06,684
Scott: and there's a non headrest version Which I sat in and was amazing and if I really needed to save that hundred and fifty dollars I would have gotten it.

131
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:17,019
Scott: but the headrest one is just more $150 more and I wasn't originally gonna go for it, but I did and it is awesome.

132
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:22,340
Scott: So yeah for it to show up It'll arrive probably the day after tomorrow.

133
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:23,947
Scott: It'll arrive this week.

134
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:25,514
Scott: definitely there's no doubt about that.

135
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:28,691
Scott: for the amount of money we're paying They're gonna give us the high-class service.

136
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:37,900
Rym: Um, I just The fact that we just drop more money on office chairs than we've spent on the entirety of GeekNights to date.

137
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:45,270
Scott: Well you think about I sit in the chair a lot and the chair I have now I had since like 1998 the worst thing I'm

138
00:09:45,572 --> 00:09:50,075
Rym: the guy pointed out, you know It's only 40 bucks to ship one within Manhattan and I realized

139
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:51,140
Scott: could have had it sent to your office.

140
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,479
Rym: Now I'm thinking this is bad, but I feel like I should have to.

141
00:09:56,361 --> 00:10:00,115
Rym: Yeah, because between sitting in the chair I'm sitting in now, which is a nice chair.

142
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:05,973
Rym: I spent like 400 bucks for this I don't know eight years ago, and it's a nice chair, but it's starting to fall apart.

143
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:12,120
Rym: It's old and I Sit in this chair most of my time and I sit in my chair at work the rest of my time.

144
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:13,629
Rym: There are very few chairs.

145
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:15,460
Rym: I sit in more than those two chairs combined.

146
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:21,780
Rym: I feel like I should spend the money to have the absolute best thing to put my ass on that I can get.

147
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:25,678
Scott: Yeah, I do sit in the office chair a bit more, but I figure I'm.

148
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:37,100
Scott: you know I'm not gonna work at the job forever Even though I have no problems with it now and there's a good chance that you know one day I mean, you know the building that we're running out of room So we might move and then there might be a chance for the company to buy me a good chair a better.

149
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:43,366
Scott: I mean the chair I work at have is not so bad now Plus if I buy one for work and then I stop working there I might work somewhere else.

150
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,340
Scott: that gives me a chair and I'll have a redundant chair.

151
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:46,243
Scott: You know, it's

152
00:10:46,323 --> 00:11:02,980
Rym: I gotta say the primary reason I didn't just buy another one was very simply that I just started my new job and I wondered how it would look if in my second week of work I just roll an errand chair in one day and stick it in my little space.

153
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,206
Scott: Yeah, it might not be too good.

154
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:07,074
Rym: I imagine would have been hilarious.

155
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:13,060
Scott: No, but yeah People say these chairs, you know that the he's right.

156
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,600
Scott: The price does keep going up and I tried to get a deal on eBay because I didn't want to pay the ludicrous price.

157
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:19,828
Scott: But it's just impossible to try to get a deal.

158
00:11:19,988 --> 00:11:20,611
Rym: So not worth it.

159
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:23,220
Rym: it the chairs are great and they're worth the money.

160
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,963
Rym: I'm serious.

161
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:27,396
Scott: Yeah, plus it's gonna last me, you know, probably I mean this chair lasted me.

162
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:27,939
Scott: how many years?

163
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,183
Scott: Six seven eight.

164
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:39,339
Scott: I assume that this chair will last me like 20 to 25 years Hopefully if not more plus I can replace the you know, the seats and the cushions if they get screwed up.

165
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:43,215
Scott: yep, I like my current chair where the cushions is screwed up and that's the end of it.

166
00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:51,100
Rym: just really goes in with our whole philosophy of Instead of buying a bunch of crap like a lot of people do I'm willing to spend money for quality.

167
00:11:51,682 --> 00:12:01,700
Rym: so I guess if I want if I'm gonna get something I Yeah, and like I'll spend a lot of money on a few very good things than a lot of money on a bunch of crap.

168
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,919
Rym: I don't need a thousand DVDs, but I'd really like to have one really good DVD.

169
00:12:06,261 --> 00:12:15,497
Scott: Yep, and a chair that I sit in at my computer is something I use a lot and is very important and will make a big Difference, you know, where is something else that I might use?

170
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:16,100
Scott: very rarely?

171
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:17,569
Scott: I like, you know my toaster oven.

172
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:18,515
Scott: I can afford to get a $20 toaster.

173
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:22,173
Rym: Yeah, actually currently we will we have the toaster oven.

174
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:33,413
Scott: the actual toaster we own cost $4 and 98 cents and target and for the amount that we use it and the difference it makes in our lives the $20 toaster the $30 toaster wouldn't really improve our lives.

175
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:34,859
Scott: It's an awful toaster.

176
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:38,654
Scott: It's garbage, but it does what we need barely it overheats.

177
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:40,060
Rym: It can't do a bagel for crap.

178
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:43,571
Scott: Well, it's not a bagel toaster the worst hosting anyway.

179
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:46,420
Rym: Yeah, so should buy a thousand dollar toaster.

180
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:47,844
Scott: Yeah, cuz we toast.

181
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:51,194
Scott: if I toast it every day I would but I don't right.

182
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:56,660
Scott: so news I guess This is an old news from last week, but I want to talk about it.

183
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,399
Scott: Anyway, cuz I didn't talk about it last week.

184
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:03,320
Scott: There are some guys and I'm not even gonna go into any details on this because I don't really care.

185
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:09,780
Scott: The point is is that they are coding the basically what amounts to a stupidity filter for the Internet's.

186
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:11,806
Rym: Oh, you're gonna talk about this.

187
00:13:11,846 --> 00:13:16,967
Scott: Yes, they you know, I I don't know what software, you know Principle it works on.

188
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:21,859
Scott: it could work, you know, similarly to a spam filter I imagine but I guess it could work in other ways as well.

189
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,145
Scott: That doesn't matter.

190
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:33,620
Scott: the point is they're gonna make some sort of filter that will detect Stupid posts so or stupid typing so for example read somewhere that it was kind of like a Bayesian thing.

191
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,530
Scott: Yeah, that's similar to a spam filter.

192
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:48,085
Scott: the way this would work I guess in theory as I've heard it described is let's say you try to post on a blog and you say something like Well, I think that's jolly good and you should blabbity blah and it would say Congratulations, you're British.

193
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:50,011
Scott: Yes, and then you go.

194
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:55,988
Scott: let's say you go to that blog again later and you say man It would say and you click post.

195
00:13:56,248 --> 00:13:58,515
Scott: it would say sorry your post is too stupid.

196
00:13:58,575 --> 00:14:00,060
Scott: try writing something more intelligent.

197
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,491
Rym: You know, it's kind of like warning cat-like typing detected.

198
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:06,360
Scott: Yeah, I imagine this also could be used for email.

199
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,440
Scott: You could be like, you know, it would like highlight the emails which are stupid.

200
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,680
Scott: You could just not read those ones and then read well more and more because our forums are getting to the point where?

201
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,461
Rym: Mr.

202
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:23,100
Rym: Perry doesn't around so often and he doesn't get you guys as much as he should and Waters poison does what he can but he can't get all of you and I don't have time to look at the stupid farm.

203
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:24,208
Scott: I'm too lazy.

204
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:34,749
Rym: So, uh Once something like this is in a workable state you can bet your collective asses that stupid types Typing will just be blocked outright on our forums.

205
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,472
Scott: Yep, pretty much.

206
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,959
Scott: I'm gonna use this on pretty much everywhere I can get.

207
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:45,796
Scott: I Hope I imagine that it could have some sort of algorithm like detect spelling mistakes detect grammatical errors Some sort of percentage wise.

208
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:53,262
Scott: definitely well I could see what I look at like the the amount of typing and then look for like standalone use and or if you just Train it.

209
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:54,627
Rym: I mean you say this is a stupid.

210
00:14:54,667 --> 00:15:02,342
Rym: put rate every post on a scale of one stupid to five stupids Yep, and then five stupids being the most of the least stupid, uh Either way.

211
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:04,750
Scott: Yeah, I think it would just work just fine.

212
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:10,497
Scott: being stupid or not stupid as opposed to rating on a scale of stupids I mean I could see it being very elegant.

213
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:12,989
Rym: in the end These sorts of things tend to turn out that way where it wouldn't.

214
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,098
Rym: I mean if someone makes a typo that happens.

215
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:26,523
Scott: everyone makes mistakes, but if someone consistently ends sentences and poorly placed prepositions It would definitely, you know have some sort of leniency wouldn't be like oh you made a spelling mistake You're stupid.

216
00:15:26,603 --> 00:15:29,418
Scott: It would probably, you know be like, okay your post is like 10% stupid.

217
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,976
Rym: It's kind of like how the Supreme Court decided what pornography was, you know, I'll know it when I see it.

218
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:37,705
Rym: I Know a stupid post.

219
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:39,793
Rym: when I see a stupid post I can pick them out.

220
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:44,436
Rym: if I can get a computer to Within 80% do the same thing.

221
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:47,619
Rym: for me The Internet's gonna be a much better place to be.

222
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:56,458
Scott: I think this is great And I think that I will mostly only go to websites that use this sort of thing At least websites with user comments and forms and whatnot.

223
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:59,628
Rym: So Speaking I'm not even gonna try that sort of segue.

224
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,620
Rym: New York State has had some issues with Facebook lately.

225
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:11,640
Rym: I'm not gonna get into all of them But one of the big issues is that they seem to and this isn't just with Facebook or New York State.

226
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,238
Rym: This is kind of a broad American problem.

227
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:14,500
Rym: where?

228
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:22,806
Rym: Any sort of social networking or internet thing will be used by people of all ages and there's no way to verify Anyone's identity easily.

229
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:40,423
Rym: as a result a lot of people Possibly say things they maybe shouldn't have said a lot of people who say they're 18 or obviously 11 and occasionally there are sexual predators and other problems and More and more.

230
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:56,849
Rym: it seems like parents and lawmakers are doing everything they can to punish The people who provide these contents and these services and prevent them from giving us good stuff Instead of just forcing parents and or schools to teach kids how to not Give their social security number to strangers on the internet

231
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,920
Scott: or you know parents watching the hell what your kids are doing.

232
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:05,079
Rym: I mean remember butters never get into a car with a stranger unless it's a limousine.

233
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:10,440
Rym: Yep, and I guess the rationale there is that Facebook is kind of I mean parents don't get it.

234
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,576
Rym: They look at Facebook or myspace or any of these places and to them.

235
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:14,260
Rym: It's a limousine.

236
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,109
Rym: It's just a place that it's run by a corporation.

237
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:27,855
Rym: It must be safe, and that's obviously not true, but I think this problem just comes out of the fact that the Generational gap in terms of understanding of technology by and large is just widening.

238
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,688
Rym: there are exceptions But you can't pretend that isn't the general.

239
00:17:31,748 --> 00:17:40,375
Scott: the question I have here right is that basically Facebook is doing something right and New York State has a problem with it, but where is Facebook like, California, right?

240
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:41,740
Scott: I?

241
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,121
Scott: Don't know.

242
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:45,757
Scott: so so why should anything New York State matter to Facebook like I?

243
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,040
Scott: Guess they you know wouldn't they'd have to sue them under like a federal law because they're doing business across state borders, right?

244
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,363
Scott: So I that's.

245
00:17:53,403 --> 00:18:03,010
Scott: the thing that I'm struggling to understand is how and one individual state has a problem with a national Or an international company, and how what they say even matters.

246
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,078
Scott: shouldn't it be require federal action to do anything?

247
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,344
Rym: well It's more.

248
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:10,546
Rym: It wasn't really lawsuits or anything It was just them.

249
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:15,039
Rym: a lot of this was just tongue-lashing and garbage just saying well You should do this and you should do this.

250
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,108
Rym: They're trying to force them to do.

251
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:17,720
Scott: they could do that all you want, but Facebook.

252
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:19,814
Scott: I shouldn't be obligated unless right.

253
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:26,820
Scott: see I'm not a lawyer I don't know either, but that's it's sort of weird to me that like you have these companies You know like internet companies like Google and stuff.

254
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,015
Scott: You know we know the problems like Google in China, and that's an issue of.

255
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:38,040
Scott: you know international stuff Which which makes sense, but where certain states have different laws and these companies you know that are you know basically?

256
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:46,553
Scott: Worldwide are forced to change their ways because one state has a problem And it changes the ways for everyone because you can't change it for just one state.

257
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:48,139
Scott: that well as basically impossible.

258
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,859
Rym: the issue I'm more interested in is just the idea that People are always saying oh Facebook should do something about this.

259
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:57,519
Rym: What pray tell do these people expect Facebook to do?

260
00:18:58,643 --> 00:18:59,549
Scott: These people don't expect.

261
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:00,999
Scott: they don't understand that so they can't.

262
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:09,020
Rym: People in Congress and parents just don't understand the technology so they make demands of the technology that are infeasible.

263
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,491
Rym: I mean what ban anyone under 18?

264
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:13,520
Rym: how you gonna tell credit card doesn't count.

265
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:17,566
Rym: I had a credit card when I was 16. you can use your parents credit card You can generate a card number.

266
00:19:17,606 --> 00:19:18,008
Rym: nobody.

267
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:24,852
Scott: you cannot expect someone to make a real a realistic Expectation if they don't understand the thing that they're complaining about.

268
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:36,888
Rym: and I wonder when this idea I mean the very vague broad idea behind this of parents and lawmakers Making demands of technology that are infeasible.

269
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:39,696
Rym: at what point is that going to explode one way or the other?

270
00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:42,445
Rym: at what point our laws Gonna ruin the internet?

271
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:46,160
Rym: or at what point our old people going to die of old age?

272
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:57,588
Rym: I know that it's never going to become feasible So I don't know that stupidity filter will probably prevent the majority of 14 year olds from posting on the internet for at least Another 12 years.

273
00:19:57,649 --> 00:19:58,354
Scott: that might help.

274
00:19:58,414 --> 00:19:58,676
Scott: Yes

275
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:16,280
Rym: So things of the day While I don't think we ever used it as a thing of the day But there hasn't been nearly as much Team Fortress 2 machinima as I've hoped for now

276
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:20,960
Scott: I think I think the problem with that is that you know with something like quake, right?

277
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,560
Scott: There's very little done for you.

278
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,431
Scott: It's pretty much you got the quake guy and you got some bad guys and that's it.

279
00:20:25,712 --> 00:20:38,080
Scott: and because there's so little done for you But you still have to work within these huge constraints that you get really creative machinima going on Whereas with Team Fortress 2 it's sort of like all the work is done for you already.

280
00:20:38,623 --> 00:20:40,594
Scott: So what machinima can you really do?

281
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:41,600
Scott: the game is machinima?

282
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,524
Rym: I think the other problem is just that.

283
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:50,143
Rym: for me at least the real appeal of machinima was that it wasn't easy to do and It wasn't done.

284
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:57,487
Rym: and seeing it like when I saw father's frags father frags best at a LAN party in Southfield I'd never seen anything like that.

285
00:20:57,527 --> 00:20:58,291
Rym: That was amazing.

286
00:20:58,351 --> 00:20:59,657
Rym: who would even think to do that?

287
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:04,760
Rym: now It's kind of easy to make machinima and I don't care about it a lot anymore.

288
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:10,140
Scott: Yeah, I mean I care about machinima the same way I care about other short funny videos or perhaps long funny.

289
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,080
Scott: Yeah, they have to be good or not even funny.

290
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:12,883
Scott: But you know, it's.

291
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:23,139
Scott: it's basically just someone made a movie in some Length and they distribute it in some way and they happen to use a game engine to make the movie.

292
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,388
Scott: Yep That's that's all it is.

293
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,417
Rym: It's machinima.

294
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:29,756
Rym: It's not Doesn't mean anything useful to me because it's just it's a video on YouTube.

295
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:30,600
Rym: Is it funny or not?

296
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,221
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

297
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:31,923
Scott: I don't really.

298
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:32,304
Scott: you know.

299
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:39,866
Scott: prejudice between live-action or animation and machinima is just a different animation tool But we talked about a briefly.

300
00:21:40,026 --> 00:21:46,792
Rym: Ignis sold us which the first half of it is actually I think an extremely well done work And the second half goes nowhere.

301
00:21:46,993 --> 00:21:52,240
Rym: Yep, but This is probably the funniest team fortress to machinima to date.

302
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,219
Rym: If you don't count the actual official animations from the team fortress to do the machinima is made by valve.

303
00:21:58,946 --> 00:22:02,406
Scott: But yeah, it's funny Mostly voice acting.

304
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:02,707
Rym: Yes.

305
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:05,758
Rym: The voice acting is just dude it muscles coming out lips.

306
00:22:07,322 --> 00:22:11,340
Scott: It's mostly a work of voice acting that happens to use machinima's but it's good.

307
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:16,578
Rym: Yeah, now it's on the start of that pure pointed show that I haven't really watched and I don't know much about.

308
00:22:16,638 --> 00:22:17,825
Rym: so that is Not my thing of the day.

309
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:20,380
Rym: My thing of the day is just the machinima at the beginning.

310
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:23,093
Scott: No, as long as at the beginning you can just stop at the mckinmas over.

311
00:22:23,214 --> 00:22:24,420
Rym: Yeah, which is what I did.

312
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:26,687
Scott: All right, my thing of the day.

313
00:22:26,827 --> 00:22:30,740
Scott: I'm not sure how old this is, but I discovered it recently and that's well screw everybody.

314
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,187
Scott: It's cicada calm calm and it's.

315
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:37,760
Scott: I'm not sure exactly what there is to know about it.

316
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,280
Scott: There's music on this website and I assume there are people at this website who made this music and the music is very video gamey.

317
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:50,179
Scott: I mean, they've got like some Metroid tracks here, but Basically, they've got two album.

318
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,240
Scott: They got a bunch of albums on this site and most of the I haven't listened to nearly even most to all of them.

319
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:03,229
Scott: But there are two there is technology crisis and technology crisis - and these are basically full albums You can just download and listen to.

320
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,760
Scott: but I think they are fully copyrighted.

321
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:07,880
Scott: So I'm we might have to ask to get permission to use them in another way.

322
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:14,997
Scott: but you can download the mp3s for free and It's an album of music that sounds like it should be music from a video game.

323
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:15,720
Scott: Like you're like man.

324
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,288
Scott: This is an awesome video game soundtrack.

325
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,073
Scott: What game is it from?

326
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:19,460
Scott: It's not from a game.

327
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,393
Rym: That's kind of like pirate baby cabana battle whatever where man.

328
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:24,397
Rym: what video game is that?

329
00:23:24,457 --> 00:23:27,660
Rym: It's not a video game It's just a movie that looks like one sort of like that.

330
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,130
Scott: Yeah, but this website has a whole lot of music that's pretty awesome.

331
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:43,145
Scott: Geeky rockin music a varying quality and If you're looking for something to listen to here is a treasure trove that will provide you with many hours of listening pleasure for no money.

332
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:48,993
Rym: so it came up in the forums recently partly because also on the whole internet.

333
00:23:49,435 --> 00:24:02,467
Rym: because well partly because we talked about it and I Made an offhand comment that I will defend at the end of all this but the idea of Dolby Pro logic and the problems with guitar hero and all that business and It made us realize that one.

334
00:24:02,628 --> 00:24:03,773
Rym: that's something we could talk about.

335
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:11,765
Rym: because while I have been writing a Podcasting guide for some time and I'll finish it someday and publish it somehow Scott did something similar.

336
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:14,232
Rym: that isn't done, but he's worked a lot on it.

337
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,480
Rym: about computer audio right and consumer audio.

338
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:32,757
Scott: basically, you know a lot of people seem to understand, you know parts of audio that are like You know, okay the CD the audio comes off the CD with the laser and they understand near the speakers Like okay, the electricity comes into the speaker and the magnet goes back and forth and it makes sound.

339
00:24:32,777 --> 00:24:35,076
Rym: but you know How few people know there's a magnet there.

340
00:24:36,064 --> 00:24:38,159
Rym: Okay, but okay a few people even.

341
00:24:40,421 --> 00:24:41,265
Scott: Speaker works.

342
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:44,620
Scott: an analog electric signal comes into the speaker.

343
00:24:44,881 --> 00:24:46,408
Scott: There is a magnet in the speaker.

344
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:49,260
Scott: The electrical signal is a wave.

345
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:50,184
Scott: It's analog.

346
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:53,719
Scott: the air right moves according to the wave sound comes out.

347
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:55,525
Scott: Learn something today.

348
00:24:55,545 --> 00:25:00,220
Rym: I could make a digital speaker with servo motors that vibrated cones.

349
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:04,520
Scott: This is how heart people turn all sorts of random electronic devices into speakers.

350
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,100
Scott: They just send electrical anything with a moving part.

351
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:14,229
Scott: You just send an analog electrical signal into it that can power it at the right voltage and it'll make it move According to the analog wave.

352
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:16,160
Scott: and if things move in a wave they make sound.

353
00:25:16,421 --> 00:25:21,696
Rym: Well, the one interesting thing people should know is just that there's no difference between a microphone and a speaker.

354
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:22,017
Rym: Yep.

355
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:23,822
Rym: Anyway, yep Okay.

356
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:28,558
Scott: So today I'm going to teach you and Rym will help about surround sound.

357
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:30,728
Rym: mostly I'll let Scott talk but I'm go.

358
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:33,280
Rym: I'll jump in with all the relevant audio engineering bits.

359
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,059
Scott: Yes, the first thing you need to know before you know about surround sound is about mono sound.

360
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:39,752
Scott: Mono sound is just mono.

361
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:41,380
Scott: It's one one one track.

362
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:49,709
Scott: So if you have one speaker just one that vibrates one magnet and you take a mono track You can hear the whole thing with one speaker, right?

363
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:50,171
Scott: There's all.

364
00:25:50,211 --> 00:25:51,617
Scott: the noise comes out of one speaker.

365
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:54,270
Scott: That's a mono is stereo sound.

366
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:59,434
Scott: you have two Speakers, it's 2.0 two speakers and no subwoofers.

367
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,121
Scott: That's when people say 5.1.

368
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:04,552
Scott: They mean five speakers and one subwoofer, right?

369
00:26:04,552 --> 00:26:06,458
Scott: 6.2 is six speakers and two subwoofers, which is stupid.

370
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:06,900
Rym: now.

371
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,195
Rym: There were those I believe they were called quadraphonic records a long time.

372
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:11,420
Scott: I'm gonna talk about quadraphonic.

373
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,060
Scott: Yeah, that went nowhere that my dad had one, but so did my dad.

374
00:26:15,745 --> 00:26:17,840
Scott: He had a quadraphonic receiver, but only two speakers.

375
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:26,078
Scott: But anyway stereo sound 2.0 you have two speakers and you can actually send different audio to the left and different audio to the right.

376
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:29,200
Scott: and it's basically The way they do this is they have two monos.

377
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:37,365
Scott: You just have twice as much sound and it takes up twice as much data and you don't lose any data because you have just Two different mono tracks.

378
00:26:37,385 --> 00:26:39,774
Scott: you said one out one wire and one out of different wire.

379
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:51,440
Scott: and you sort of you know You create your music in such a way where you decide when you're making the music or audio Which sounds are gonna come out of left in which you come to come out of the right and it sounds really good.

380
00:26:51,521 --> 00:26:52,456
Scott: You can do cool stuff with it.

381
00:26:52,962 --> 00:26:59,800
Scott: Like, you know, you'll you'll be playing you listen to some music and like, you know The guitar will be rocking on the left of the bass be rocking on the right and it sounds totally awesome.

382
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:02,106
Scott: That's the stereo sound is now.

383
00:27:02,307 --> 00:27:07,180
Rym: Well, I guess I because stereo sound is just the way it doesn't always have to sound stereo.

384
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:07,904
Rym: It's just yep.

385
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,820
Rym: That is when you have two streams of audio going to two speakers.

386
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:18,880
Rym: Now you can with trickery use those two speakers to make surround sound that sounds totally real to people.

387
00:27:19,182 --> 00:27:21,640
Rym: Yep, and the math of that is complicated.

388
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:23,688
Rym: But basically all you have to do is you can.

389
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,040
Rym: the reason we hear in stereo and the way that works is one.

390
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:27,824
Scott: We have two ears.

391
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:30,900
Rym: not only do we have two ears, but our ears are not both identical.

392
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:36,360
Rym: Usually someone want someone's right or left ear is a little bit higher lower shapes a little bit different.

393
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:37,850
Scott: Everyone's ear is crazy different.

394
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,400
Scott: You got bones in the ear that make a difference.

395
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,289
Scott: You got the shape of your ear.

396
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:41,420
Scott: that makes a difference the position.

397
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:51,254
Rym: You notice how a lot of animals or humans too if they hear a sound or they wander instinctually You'll kind of cock your head a little bit and you'll move your head around a little bit.

398
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:55,369
Rym: and there's all these ways that animals Can define where sound is coming from.

399
00:27:55,389 --> 00:28:01,386
Rym: and here in stereo, but the way we actually tell basically Essentially boils down.

400
00:28:01,606 --> 00:28:08,038
Rym: the brain figures it out to the difference the delay Between when one ear hears it and when the other ear hears it.

401
00:28:09,262 --> 00:28:14,511
Rym: And because our ears are shaped we have other Mechanisms to determine if something is in front of us or behind us.

402
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:22,739
Rym: because theoretically if our ears were identical We would not be able to tell between the sound that was exactly in front of us and exactly behind us.

403
00:28:23,222 --> 00:28:26,180
Rym: Mmm, but we can tell and there are a lot of reasons for that.

404
00:28:26,502 --> 00:28:28,580
Rym: But the shape of the head and everything have an effect.

405
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:47,757
Rym: But basically if you mess with sound like say I say, all right I'll take this frequency range and I'll phase shift it or something or I'll delay it out of the left speaker but not the right speaker a Tiny fraction of a second, but then this frequency range I'll delay even more and this frequency range.

406
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:48,680
Rym: I'll delay even less.

407
00:28:49,524 --> 00:28:57,600
Rym: Each one of those bands will sound Physically like it's in a different part of the room because your brain says well I calculated this delay.

408
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,609
Rym: Therefore the object is right there.

409
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:10,740
Scott: Hmm and a lot of Computer games have used this to great effect a lot in the day before, you know The the current, you know right now if you want to play a game and surround sound a lot of them just use.

410
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:12,219
Scott: You know DTS or whatever.

411
00:29:12,642 --> 00:29:16,097
Scott: But you know some of them use creative EAX kind of sound blaster stuff.

412
00:29:16,218 --> 00:29:17,443
Scott: back in the day There was what a C3.

413
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:21,780
Scott: It wasn't a C3 was um, I'll take no what the hell a track?

414
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:23,294
Scott: No, what the fuck was it called?

415
00:29:23,476 --> 00:29:23,880
Scott: forget it.

416
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,735
Scott: It began with an a because he ate all that like sound blaster stuff.

417
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:31,571
Scott: you pretty all those words I said were things that have other things to do with audio.

418
00:29:31,631 --> 00:29:33,700
Rym: No, that was just reverb the creative thing.

419
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,388
Rym: They they acted like it was fancy.

420
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:36,313
Rym: You know, this is like the.

421
00:29:36,554 --> 00:29:37,298
Rym: it's just reverb.

422
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:41,833
Scott: Yep But yeah, there was another competitor that began with an a that got killed by a 3d.

423
00:29:41,873 --> 00:29:42,375
Scott: Yes a 3d goddamn.

424
00:29:44,422 --> 00:29:46,830
Scott: And that was basically this what Rym is talking about?

425
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,720
Scott: using stereo sound to sound like surround sound?

426
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:53,558
Rym: Specifically I'm talking about doing it myself because I've done it all I do it.

427
00:29:53,598 --> 00:29:53,940
Rym: It's fun.

428
00:29:54,060 --> 00:30:00,720
Rym: I used to take music that I had and do that to it and I'd bring like I could bring the trumpet part.

429
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,060
Rym: So it sounded like the trumpet part was next to me and everything else was far away and all this fun stuff.

430
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:11,029
Scott: So yeah, so in stereo sound is pretty good And that's why most things you listen to today are in stereo sound.

431
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,400
Scott: FM is you know FM radio is stereo am radio as well.

432
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,259
Rym: It helps that we have two ears.

433
00:30:16,521 --> 00:30:17,847
Rym: I mean binaural recording.

434
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:20,217
Rym: you can record things perfectly.

435
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:25,078
Scott: Yep You can you know, this is why headphones, you know, you have two speakers in them.

436
00:30:25,942 --> 00:30:26,564
Scott: Stereo is great.

437
00:30:27,206 --> 00:30:28,149
Scott: It's that's all there is to say.

438
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:31,040
Scott: So then we some guy came up with quadraphonic.

439
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,529
Scott: I cannot can talk about this much but quadraphonic was.

440
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,716
Scott: it came and it went with good reason.

441
00:30:35,797 --> 00:30:36,599
Rym: It was more.

442
00:30:37,442 --> 00:30:45,026
Scott: Four speakers was basically four speakers with four full audio tracks and you had to get special records Because this is that old right.

443
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:47,876
Scott: and you had a special receiver and you had to have four speakers.

444
00:30:47,936 --> 00:30:48,739
Scott: and it was ludicrous.

445
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,037
Scott: and you Know it's something that rich fancy people bought and there weren't too many quadraphonic records.

446
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:53,740
Scott: and that was it.

447
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,425
Scott: This was like.

448
00:30:54,506 --> 00:30:55,413
Scott: then it went away early.

449
00:30:55,494 --> 00:31:04,133
Scott: audio files If anything tells you my dad had a receiver capable of quadraphonic But he only had two speakers and he had stereo records on his stereo turntable.

450
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:11,270
Scott: So, okay, so Later on eventually people decided hey Surround sound we can do cool stuff.

451
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:11,792
Scott: Like what have you had?

452
00:31:11,812 --> 00:31:13,380
Scott: a whole bunch of speakers in the movie theater?

453
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,915
Scott: We could make it sound like stuff is coming all over the place and in the movie theater.

454
00:31:17,996 --> 00:31:19,200
Scott: It is pretty awesome.

455
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,872
Scott: You can get wicked Star Wars action going on and it.

456
00:31:22,334 --> 00:31:27,235
Scott: you know things in like, you know The what's it called the Omni max or theaters and stuff you can.

457
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:30,516
Scott: I'm X I'm X. Well, Omni max is better than I'm X but what it's?

458
00:31:30,536 --> 00:31:40,489
Scott: all the same You can get really cool special effects If you have lots of speakers lots of powerful speakers and you determine in production time which audio comes out of which speakers.

459
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:42,238
Scott: and that's pretty cool stuff.

460
00:31:42,258 --> 00:31:47,040
Scott: and People eventually said hey, I can afford to get a lot of speakers speakers achieve.

461
00:31:47,664 --> 00:31:50,239
Scott: Why can't I have that awesome cinematic experience in my house?

462
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,485
Scott: Well, you can you can.

463
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:54,411
Scott: you can get surround sound in your house.

464
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:57,440
Rym: The problem is it's not quite that simple.

465
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,399
Rym: I mean how many old movies are recorded in?

466
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:08,272
Rym: Surround sound almost has a. Blanca doesn't have 5.1 audio tracks.

467
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,520
Scott: Here's another thing, right?

468
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,360
Scott: Okay, you want in surround sound right five point one audio tracks with no loss of data.

469
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:21,960
Scott: Well, you know how big a wave file is of like say, you know a three-minute song, right?

470
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,283
Scott: No, even a flack.

471
00:32:23,403 --> 00:32:27,594
Scott: Okay, so you compress losslessly a Five minute song.

472
00:32:27,775 --> 00:32:29,339
Scott: right that is stereo sound.

473
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,806
Scott: that's a lot of data that can be like 40 megs.

474
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:37,188
Scott: this podcast right compressed An hour in mp3 heavily compressed can be like 40 megs.

475
00:32:38,271 --> 00:32:42,404
Scott: Take a 90 minute movie now take six tracks of audio.

476
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:46,364
Scott: So three times stereo and Make it lossless.

477
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:51,290
Scott: That is still have room for the movie and still have room for the movie on a four gigabyte DVD.

478
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:52,157
Scott: It's not happening.

479
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:54,574
Rym: Plus the movie is gonna be HD.

480
00:32:55,196 --> 00:32:55,859
Rym: and then what?

481
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,422
Scott: and then what?

482
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:58,370
Scott: Okay, so you put it on a gigantic blu-ray.

483
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,678
Scott: So you fit the HD movie on the gigantic blu-ray.

484
00:33:00,698 --> 00:33:01,099
Scott: Guess what?

485
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,310
Scott: There's no room for the six channels of lossless audio.

486
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,117
Scott: Also six channels of lossless audio.

487
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:07,458
Scott: Okay.

488
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:11,370
Scott: How are you gonna transfer those from your DVD player to your receiver to your speakers?

489
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:12,874
Scott: You don't have that.

490
00:33:12,915 --> 00:33:24,890
Scott: you're gonna have six wires coming out of your Frickin stereo or one e player one digital wire, but then you have to have a fairly Good bus to say a day even if you have a digital wire, okay, so you have one digital wire.

491
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:32,324
Scott: You know ludicrously fast It has to be to be able to transfer enough data in You know so that the audio comes out without being delayed.

492
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:38,927
Rym: now computers could do it But are you gonna spend a computer's worth on just the audio part of your DVD player?

493
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:39,890
Scott: No, that's not gonna happen.

494
00:33:40,512 --> 00:33:47,890
Scott: So they've invented many technologies to do surround sound and I will explain them all briefly Or at least the ones you care about briefly.

495
00:33:48,392 --> 00:33:50,019
Scott: The first one was Dolby surround.

496
00:33:50,280 --> 00:34:02,143
Scott: Dolby surround is what they used in the movie theaters back in the day And basically what they did is they took stereo sound analog stereo sound and on each One of the two channels they phase shifted another channel.

497
00:34:02,504 --> 00:34:14,716
Scott: now this if you played this out of normal speakers It wouldn't sound quite right because you have this, you know audio on top of audio but the receiver the equipment that received the signal would take the audio and Basically split up.

498
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:16,123
Scott: because you know, you have two waves.

499
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:17,429
Scott: one is phase shifted.

500
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:23,652
Scott: So when something's in phase that's when the humps of the waves meet the humps of the waves and the dips in the waves Meet the dips.

501
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:28,094
Scott: So if you phase shift it you have these humps meeting the not You know sort of off.

502
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:33,987
Scott: and when you face if you have a phase shifted wave on top of another phase shifted wave with math You can split them up again.

503
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:41,764
Scott: So if you have four you have stereo sound Four waves to a phase shifted on top of each other to create a new wave.

504
00:34:41,784 --> 00:34:43,110
Scott: then you split it up on the other end.

505
00:34:43,712 --> 00:34:45,197
Scott: Now you can have four speakers worth.

506
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:49,130
Scott: so they did left right center and rear and that was the original Dolby.

507
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:51,717
Scott: You know just no normal Dolby surround.

508
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:55,210
Scott: then they came out with Dolby Pro logic.

509
00:34:55,871 --> 00:35:00,128
Scott: Dolby Pro logic was basically Dolby surround but better.

510
00:35:00,149 --> 00:35:06,010
Scott: in Addition they had another feature and this feature allowed you to take stereo sound, you know.

511
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:11,722
Scott: So if you had a CD right back in the day with just Dolby surround You couldn't listen to a CD and surround sound.

512
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,250
Scott: you put a stereo CD in there.

513
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:15,070
Scott: It was like the quadraphonic record days.

514
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,067
Scott: If you had a stereo record, it would only play out of two speakers.

515
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:23,389
Rym: now You could probably make it play out of four But it would just play the same thing out of two in the same thing out of the other two.

516
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,306
Scott: Yeah, you could duplicate say okay, whatever you're playing on the front right play on the back, right?

517
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:28,310
Scott: That doesn't really help you though.

518
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,382
Scott: It's just stereo sound with more speakers and more loudness.

519
00:35:31,803 --> 00:35:33,952
Scott: It doesn't actually surround sound You can't.

520
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:40,670
Scott: you won't hear the x-wing flying around behind you but not in front of you You know, you won't hear the laser going over your left shoulder towards your front, right?

521
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:46,276
Scott: so Dolby Pro logic what they did is using some math that I'm not going to explain.

522
00:35:46,397 --> 00:35:54,200
Scott: they had a system where you could take a stereo CD or a stereo audio signal and it would figure out a way to split that up.

523
00:35:54,461 --> 00:35:59,376
Scott: not split it up so much but do math and Calculate a diff a new.

524
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:01,422
Scott: it would generate a brand new.

525
00:36:01,483 --> 00:36:08,210
Scott: not brand new but from the stereo sound it had He would figure out what should go on the center channel and what should go on the rear channel.

526
00:36:08,691 --> 00:36:15,214
Scott: So even if you didn't have a surround sound DVD or laserdisc because that was in the Dolby Pro logic one days It was laserdisc.

527
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:22,209
Scott: You could still hear your CDs in Surroundish sound on your all your speakers and it wouldn't just be copying.

528
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:27,304
Scott: Then came Dolby Pro logic 2 which is mostly what we're using these days.

529
00:36:27,404 --> 00:36:31,335
Scott: What Dolby Pro logic 2 does is Is not really?

530
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:39,267
Scott: you know, it takes the same old Dolby Pro logic and improves upon it and It also allows you to take mono audio, right?

531
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:53,832
Scott: And if you put it in matrix mode, it can actually up mix the mono to be stereo Right to to surround sound and it also takes around sound stereo sound and can upgrade it to 5.1 instead of 4.0.

532
00:36:53,832 --> 00:36:58,832
Scott: So now your normal old CD that you bought at the store with Dolby Pro logic 2.

533
00:36:58,832 --> 00:37:07,201
Scott: You can listen to that in 5.1 surround sound and it's not like the people making the CD Decided in advance what audio would come out of which speakers or anything.

534
00:37:07,623 --> 00:37:11,730
Scott: the receiver that you're using just sort of figures it out And you can put it in different modes.

535
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:20,924
Scott: you can put in matrix mode movie mode music mode game mode and Depending on which mode you pick it Changes the way it figures out what comes out of the other speakers and it sounds different.

536
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:26,429
Scott: and that's why when you push those buttons On your stereo, it says haul movie whatever and that's what it's doing.

537
00:37:27,252 --> 00:37:32,850
Scott: Dolby Pro logic 2x is the same as Dolby Pro logic 2 only they added support for 6.1 and 7.1.

538
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:38,426
Scott: So if you're one of those crazies with seven speakers in a subwoofer, you're to your stereo CD.

539
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,650
Scott: you can hear on all your speakers.

540
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:48,210
Rym: I'll be honest I like surround sound but it's never really been worth it to bother with the mess and the wires and wireless sucks.

541
00:37:48,811 --> 00:38:03,317
Scott: But Dolby Pro logic specifically is a way for you to take non things that aren't in surround sound and listen to them on your surround sound system and they will sound better and they will be on all your speakers in a Good way.

542
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:06,096
Scott: that sounds good if you things are set up right now.

543
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:06,598
Rym: why did I?

544
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:23,922
Rym: because I made a throwaway comment about this sort of thing in a preview show and Basically, the reason I said that was simply that the majority of people who have surround sound systems and use this sort of thing Have no idea how it works now not in terms of math or in terms of the signals or whatever You know, I don't care if you know that.

545
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:24,649
Rym: you don't need to know that.

546
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:30,809
Rym: You don't need to know how internal combustion works to drive a car But you need to know what all those buttons on the dashboard do.

547
00:38:31,371 --> 00:38:34,402
Rym: Yeah, and a lot of people and I've been to their houses.

548
00:38:34,743 --> 00:38:40,002
Rym: They'll have a surround sound system and It's not in surround sound and it never has been.

549
00:38:40,062 --> 00:38:44,037
Rym: they don't have it set up right at all And they always like oh I got the surround sound.

550
00:38:44,098 --> 00:38:47,870
Rym: It's great, but it's not surround sound and they can't even tell they don't know.

551
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:48,517
Scott: they don't know.

552
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:48,599
Scott: and

553
00:38:49,752 --> 00:38:59,072
Rym: Especially with the pro logic it always acts like yeah, it's working Yeah, it's in surround and it might kind of be but not really and not so great Nope,

554
00:38:59,533 --> 00:39:04,330
Scott: so right now people complaining about guitar hero 3 on the Wii and they're like, oh my pro logic doesn't work.

555
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,630
Scott: Well, no actually you're a fool.

556
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:22,650
Scott: and in fact It could be possible that the pro logic would not be working properly and they still wouldn't even know because if it wasn't working properly Stereo sound would come out their receivers would turn with pro logic it to surround sound and they wouldn't know anything was wrong Even though something very well could be wrong because they have no clue how it works.

557
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:48,170
Scott: However, the on the GameCube or you know the Wii or something if you you know You can say some of the games are in Dolby Pro logic 2 or whatever Which means they specially constructed and did the phase shifting whatever, you know to decide, you know in advance What would come out of what speakers but still is just a stereo, you know audio signal and it also, you know Tells your receiver ever to go into game mode, you know, which is so it sounds the way they wanted to sound in games.

558
00:39:48,956 --> 00:40:03,530
Scott: But the problem in guitar hero the reason people are noticing a problem is because the game is broken and it has mono audio and Mono audio can only be upgraded to surround sound with pro logic if you're using pro logic 2 in matrix mode.

559
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:16,230
Scott: so because of that people are looking at the receivers and they're seeing that the little pro logic light isn't turning on and They're realizing that sound isn't coming out of any of the speakers except like one in the middle or just like the front ones.

560
00:40:16,852 --> 00:40:21,050
Scott: And now they realize there's a problem even though they have no clue what the problem is or why or anything.

561
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:24,085
Rym: So the game is however broken.

562
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:25,010
Scott: the game is yes.

563
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:33,696
Scott: I do think Non mono sound is is I have to say not acceptable and they really should sort of put a map put the game out again With stereo sound with some sort of recall.

564
00:40:34,138 --> 00:40:39,881
Scott: not but and again, I've been playing the game with mono sound You know on our stereo TV with no surround sound.

565
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:40,705
Scott: We don't have any surrounds.

566
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:41,870
Scott: We just please TV speakers.

567
00:40:42,372 --> 00:40:43,458
Scott: I haven't noticed any problem.

568
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:44,583
Scott: It sounds great to me.

569
00:40:44,603 --> 00:40:45,246
Scott: I don't really.

570
00:40:45,307 --> 00:40:45,950
Scott: I didn't even notice.

571
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:49,360
Rym: well, I didn't notice it one but this has nothing to do with that.

572
00:40:49,862 --> 00:40:59,650
Rym: the practice mode in guitar hero 3 is Garbage because when you play it at any slow speed almost every song just sounds like a horrible noise.

573
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:02,215
Scott: That is that is true Unlistenable noise.

574
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:04,062
Scott: Yeah, I think stereo might help that.

575
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:06,129
Rym: Yeah, but probably not.

576
00:41:06,915 --> 00:41:13,984
Rym: I'm not that confident But - there's a bunch of songs for if you activate star power at certain times.

577
00:41:14,406 --> 00:41:15,890
Rym: It sounds really bad.

578
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:18,249
Scott: Yeah, it's true really bad.

579
00:41:18,892 --> 00:41:25,850
Scott: So the only other thing I have to teach you about here is all those other surround sounds the DTS the Dolby digital.

580
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:28,570
Scott: These are all digital surround sound, right?

581
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,958
Scott: This is something completely different from what pro logic is.

582
00:41:31,018 --> 00:41:46,160
Scott: pro logic takes an analog stereo signal and makes it into you know Set figures out and sends audio to your speakers depending on what came in this digital someone in advance, you know decided Exactly what audio would go to which speakers.

583
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,690
Scott: and it's it's digital like an mp3 or a WAV file at zeros and ones.

584
00:41:50,051 --> 00:42:00,249
Scott: Right and the zeros and ones get sent to your receiver and your receiver looks at those zeros and ones and then figures out What analog audio signals to send to which speakers based on the zeros and ones?

585
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,909
Scott: Now the first thing you need to know is about PCM.

586
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:03,572
Scott: All you need to know.

587
00:42:03,632 --> 00:42:05,299
Scott: a PCM is this a WAV file?

588
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:05,981
Scott: is PCM?

589
00:42:06,282 --> 00:42:09,904
Scott: you take an analog audio signal and stereo You turn it into zeros and ones.

590
00:42:09,924 --> 00:42:16,044
Scott: that's called PCM Surround sound DTS and Dolby digital all those things use something that's not PCM.

591
00:42:16,486 --> 00:42:17,670
Scott: Well, it is PCM, but it's not.

592
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:25,390
Scott: It's called AC 3 but AC 3 is is you take say 5.1 channels of audio and you compress them.

593
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,252
Scott: It's lossy.

594
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:27,476
Scott: You're losing audio.

595
00:42:27,516 --> 00:42:28,239
Scott: It's not full.

596
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,850
Scott: It's not like if you had three stereo waves separately for six channels.

597
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:32,674
Scott: It's less than that.

598
00:42:32,694 --> 00:42:35,930
Scott: You're losing something like when you make an mp3 and you lose audio.

599
00:42:36,251 --> 00:42:37,595
Scott: You're losing something when you do this.

600
00:42:37,876 --> 00:42:42,290
Rym: granted the point of mp3 is that you lose audio that nominally humans can't hear right?

601
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:44,397
Scott: But AC 3 is you're losing something.

602
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:49,377
Scott: so it's not full six channels, but you'll notice a lot of audio files They're listening to like Oh DTS.

603
00:42:49,437 --> 00:42:50,180
Scott: Oh, it's so much better.

604
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:50,682
Scott: Not really.

605
00:42:50,763 --> 00:42:54,175
Scott: No, it's just more speakers DTS and all these things.

606
00:42:54,215 --> 00:43:03,248
Scott: what they do is they take six channels of audio and using AC 3 they are able to make a PCM wave.

607
00:43:03,529 --> 00:43:09,390
Scott: that Actually and using some crazy thing that I can explain contains a lot more audio.

608
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,820
Scott: But you know, they had to compress it which is how it fits.

609
00:43:12,503 --> 00:43:23,504
Scott: they send that AC 3 Which is also PCM kind of over to the receiver and the receiver says oh DTS a I see This is DTS AC 3. what audio do you want me to send?

610
00:43:23,544 --> 00:43:24,870
Scott: to which speaker and in advance?

611
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,957
Scott: It was decided which audio would go to which speaker.

612
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:34,425
Scott: so your receiver takes splits up decodes that AC 3 Which is all zeros and ones and figures out what audio to send to which speaker.

613
00:43:34,947 --> 00:43:35,690
Scott: and that's how it works.

614
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:42,070
Scott: That's that's all there is to digital surround sound and digital surround sound is pretty damn good And I think it's it has a lot of uses.

615
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:48,370
Scott: For example, if you want to hear those x-wings flying around behind you the DTS Adobe digital is the way that's gonna happen.

616
00:43:49,391 --> 00:43:54,330
Scott: If you want to play half-life 2 and bad guys shooting behind you, this is also how that's gonna happen.

617
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,130
Scott: Yeah, that's is how it works.

618
00:43:56,211 --> 00:43:59,251
Scott: The thing is you need to have a Surround.

619
00:43:59,372 --> 00:43:59,854
Scott: you need to have.

620
00:43:59,895 --> 00:44:02,428
Scott: first of all the sound that you're listening to has to be encoded.

621
00:44:02,468 --> 00:44:22,482
Scott: this way the hardware that is sending it to your receiver has to be sending it in a digital form with like an optical audio cable of some sorts or you know and the receiver has to support that particular format and then you have to have enough speakers to connect and have all those outputs go out and Most people have no clue how they had to set that up or how it works or anything.

622
00:44:23,205 --> 00:44:24,250
Scott: and that's how surround sound works.

623
00:44:24,834 --> 00:44:26,287
Scott: That's that's really all there is to it.

624
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:34,719
Scott: There's I mean anything more would be like the math of how they split these things up and how the waves fit and how they do The compression which you really don't care about.

625
00:44:34,779 --> 00:44:35,321
Scott: I don't care.

626
00:44:35,642 --> 00:44:45,776
Scott: most movie theaters as far as I know They just go full-on and they just have you know, a track of audio fully and lossless for every single You know channel that they want.

627
00:44:46,036 --> 00:44:46,418
Rym: do they?

628
00:44:46,438 --> 00:44:48,003
Scott: I'm pretty I think they do.

629
00:44:48,324 --> 00:44:49,046
Rym: I'm just curious.

630
00:44:49,488 --> 00:44:50,070
Scott: That's my guess.

631
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,054
Scott: Why wouldn't they?

632
00:44:51,075 --> 00:44:56,729
Scott: you know, they get these movies with these digital projectors, you know Why wouldn't they just send one more disc with the audio on it?

633
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,310
Scott: I don't know, but are you sure if they don't do that?

634
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:06,881
Scott: They probably just use like that, you know, the most DTS you can use which would probably be like, you know I guess what 6.2 channels something like that.

635
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:07,323
Scott: I don't know.

636
00:45:07,644 --> 00:45:09,916
Rym: Yeah, I think we're done for tonight though We stayed late in the city.

637
00:45:09,996 --> 00:45:11,465
Rym: So yeah, I want to go to bed.

638
00:45:11,526 --> 00:45:22,650
Scott: Yeah, but in general I think the the opinion is you know Despite how surround sound works in my opinion Unless you're really listening to one of those movies that needs surround sound like the matrix or Star Wars or something.

639
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:31,088
Scott: Or unless you're playing a video game like, you know counter-strike We're hearing the bad guys behind you or it's a really cinematic game like a Resident Evil.

640
00:45:31,108 --> 00:45:41,090
Scott: Maybe Surround sound is largely useless and sort of a vanity thing A lot of people buy to show off like ooh, look I have surround sound when really it's it's not it's not that great.

641
00:45:41,411 --> 00:45:45,069
Scott: I mean I have surround sound on my PC for you know games so I can hear people behind me.

642
00:45:45,573 --> 00:45:47,809
Scott: But in the living room, I we just use the TV speakers.

643
00:45:54,413 --> 00:45:56,601
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

644
00:45:56,681 --> 00:45:59,150

Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

647
00:46:17,832 --> 00:46:20,001
Rym: Mondays are science and technology Tuesdays.

648

Rym: We have video games board games and RPGs.

649
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:27,930
Rym: Wednesdays are anime manga comic nights and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

650
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:36,514
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to GeekNights at front row crew comm or you can send audio feedback Via audio.

658
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:08,226
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

659
00:47:08,527 --> 00:47:09,830
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
