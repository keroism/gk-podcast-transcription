1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,906
Scott: There's so much going on.

2
00:00:01,966 --> 00:00:04,494
Scott: I mean I got new parts of my laptop.

3
00:00:04,595 --> 00:00:06,280
Rym: I've got like eight new things of the day.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,040
Scott: There's like bunch of things of the day and newsies and it all everything's so great.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,696
Scott: We got loads of show material, but we're not gonna use any of it.

6
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:15,680
Rym: No, not at all.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,648
Scott: No, we're holding on to everything.

8
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,440
Scott: All the cards are firmly planted against the chest.

9
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:25,200
Scott: Today is yet another day of ask Grim and Scott week.

10
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:29,018
Rym: Listen to I don't know Tuesday October 16th or Monday October 15th.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:39,100
Rym: And even if you don't like I don't know computers or video games or any of that I'd say listen to them anyway, because we've been getting more feedback about these episodes than from frickin anything else.

12
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:43,314
Scott: Yep, all this week and perhaps even another week in the future.

13
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:51,095
Scott: We are going to just answer listener questions, and that's all we're gonna do and Basically some of the the rules about this.

14
00:00:51,196 --> 00:00:56,116
Scott: first of all We are not going to give credit to who asked the question so none of that.

15
00:00:56,276 --> 00:00:58,365
Rym: Joey Jojo Shabbat who writes.

16
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:05,013
Scott: first of all that takes up a lot of time and second of all that really can affect the psychology of how we answer the question, so we just got rid of that.

17
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:18,620
Scott: and Second of all, we're just gonna I don't know answer the questions perfectly literally like well, that's been Scott's thing Yeah, but I mean a lot of people ask questions, you know, and it's obvious what they really asking.

18
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:22,760
Scott: But if I answer the question literally is just yes or no, and then that's not what they want.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,493
Rym: So now also we're doing this from pieces of paper.

20
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:28,560
Rym: We don't have any like screens open in front of us.

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:28,821
Rym: We're.

22
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:38,072
Rym: we're kind of running it like it's a radio talk show and people just called in and asked these questions other than Going through quickly to make sure everything in the list was actually a question.

23
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:39,858
Rym: We didn't even read him ahead of time.

24
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:49,612
Scott: Nope So shall we begin because all yesterday and the day before it was like we only got through half the questions And I believe we're going to get through half the questions.

25
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:52,665
Rym: if that because there's a lot of them here, okay Well, let's get started.

26
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:55,260
Rym: All right, so do you torrent any comics?

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,193
Rym: I have torrented one comic in my life and that was death note.

28
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:01,020
Scott: I didn't torrent death note.

29
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,350
Scott: I guess I'm gonna direct.

30
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,784
Rym: I'm not gonna say I mean Obviously.

31
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:08,380
Rym: they're using torrent in the generic sense of download of scans lation.

32
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:09,660
Scott: I never use bit.

33
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:19,320
Scott: Well, actually they could be specifically referring to torrents because I know that every week They put out torrents that had for example every Marvel and DC comic that came out this week and stuff like that.

34
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:21,560
Scott: So no, I do not torrent any comics.

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,617
Scott: I buy comics with money on paper and I read webcomics that are supposed to be free online.

36
00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:28,519
Scott: and that's it.

37
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,700
Scott: The only I read the scans lations of death note back in the day, but I own all of death note now.

38
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:35,495
Rym: so I guess part of it was that one.

39
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:40,654
Rym: I E-readers aren't there yet and physical media are still better for reading comics.

40
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:46,738
Rym: in my opinion and to Scans lations are often inaccurate kind of crappy in many times.

41
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,524
Rym: three It's not like manga.

42
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:49,848
Rym: is that much money for?

43
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:57,737
Rym: I haven't been excited enough about a manga since death note To actually want to go through the effort of reading it ahead of time instead of just waiting.

44
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:04,660
Scott: Yep All right This one is only to Rym but I think I'm gonna outlaw that and say everyone we both answer every quest.

45
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,804
Scott: How come for Wednesday?

46
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:10,900
Rym: a lot of our listeners asked questions just to us because I noticed the next one's the same way.

47
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:19,269
Scott: Yeah, I think that was might have been the same person asking both questions might have been anyway Rym, even though it's spelled wrong.

48
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:20,896
Rym: How can you spell that wrong?

49
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:23,169
Rym: It's in the feed It's rims thing of the day.

50
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,859
Rym: every day people email me.

51
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:30,300
Scott: Anyway, who is your favorite character in all of comics including manga what you know, whatever all the comics?

52
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,180
Rym: I would say that's kind of a crap question.

53
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,718
Rym: Yeah That's like asking who's your favorite character in a movie ever or in a novel ever?

54
00:03:37,738 --> 00:03:38,360
Rym: where in that case?

55
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,184
Rym: It's a cross between Horatio hornblower and the Count of Monte Cristo, but I digress In comics, I don't know.

56
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:49,280
Rym: I I'd have to say it's a cross between Ozzie Mandias and Rasha.

57
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:55,263
Scott: It's also a good one It's.

58
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:57,314
Rym: that kind of question is really hard to answer.

59
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,300
Rym: I can just say characters.

60
00:03:58,461 --> 00:03:58,842
Rym: I mean what?

61
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:08,080
Rym: a character that I identified with the most a character that I thought was an interesting character Even though oftentimes I don't identify with at all or sometimes hate characters that I think are great.

62
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:14,982
Scott: Yeah, I don't even have ryuk sure There whatever.

63
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:19,856
Rym: so Scott if you were married with a child obviously a hypothetical question what?

64
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:23,700
Rym: what anime character Would you be proud to name your child after?

65
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:28,160
Scott: I'm not a freak so I wouldn't name my kid after an anime character.

66
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:32,056
Rym: I think my answer is that if I had a child their middle name would be get her beam.

67
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:35,084
Scott: get her beam Hurricane John.

68
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:36,308
Rym: get her beam to cost her.

69
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:40,324
Scott: Oh, yeah, I don't know Scott rust hurricane Ruben I don't know.

70
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:52,500
Rym: when I was younger in my teens I often thought yeah if I ever have a kid their middle name is totally gonna be something from literature and I Guess you could include anime manga comics in that and I think you could draw a name from that sort of thing.

71
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:52,902
Rym: Well,

72
00:04:52,942 --> 00:05:08,468
Scott: yeah, if I interpret this question differently into where I didn't actually have to name my child after an anime character But sort of an anime character that has qualities that I would like you know that I think are good and I would be proud if my Offspring grew up to be like that character Roger

73
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:08,789
Rym: Smith.

74
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,394
Scott: Roger Smith's a good one.

75
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:15,295
Rym: Togusa is pretty good Misato, I just really like Misato.

76
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:15,958
Scott: talk to me.

77
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:18,349
Rym: Yeah, cuz talk to me.

78
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,549
Rym: He learns he gets better Those kinds of characters.

79
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:22,273
Scott: I don't know.

80
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:23,439
Rym: All right, let's move on.

81
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:28,259
Scott: If you had to pick up an underwear pervert title, which one would it be?

82
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:30,052
Rym: I would be just be the amazing Rym.

83
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:31,824
Scott: the amazing Rym I can't.

84
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:32,709
Rym: I mean, I don't know.

85
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:36,327
Rym: if I was a superhero my name would just be Rym I wouldn't put anything in front of it.

86
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:38,074
Scott: Well, I'm currently purchasing.

87
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:47,696
Scott: I think the only underwear pervert title I'm purchasing right now is Marvel Comics presents, which is a brand new series And it's one of those ones where it's not actually like a continuing thing.

88
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:48,740
Scott: It's like an anthology.

89
00:05:48,901 --> 00:06:02,547
Scott: so it's like you get four random stories in it each each month and I always buy all those things because They never sell and they always go out of print and then they come up with a new one every few years and I'm the Only one who likes them apparently, but I love those things.

90
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:07,020
Scott: There's random stories hit or miss random artists random writers.

91
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:08,046
Scott: It's like whoo.

92
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:10,680
Scott: It's like a total grab bag and I love that action.

93
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:19,905
Rym: So I guess of all the underwear pervert literature in the known world it's either, you know Watchmen or Batman the animated series.

94
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:22,355
Rym: Yeah, because they didn't say they said title.

95
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:23,740
Rym: so I'm going with Batman.

96
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:32,100
Scott: Yeah, what they really mean is that like a title that's currently coming out and you know, which yeah I don't care Batman the animated series is like the best underwear pervert thing ever.

97
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:38,015
Scott: It is and I tried to buy an issue of Batman strikes Which is sort of like the Batman the animated series a comic equivalent.

98
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:38,296
Scott: It does.

99
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:39,019
Scott: it doesn't measure up.

100
00:06:39,702 --> 00:06:42,635
Scott: Okay, have either of you seen the anime desert punk?

101
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:43,800
Scott: I've heard of it, but I've never seen it.

102
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:45,697
Rym: I've also heard of it and not seen it.

103
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:50,019
Rym: I thought for a second it was this other anime, but I don't think that's the one I'm thinking of.

104
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,214
Scott: Nope Do you have any interest in any anime coming out next season?

105
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:55,900
Scott: How about the season just passed?

106
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Rym: Let's talk about just I don't know very very recent anime that we were excited about cuz I'd have to go with baccano.

107
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:02,744
Scott: It's a good one.

108
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:03,728
Rym: I'm really excited about.

109
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:03,928
Rym: Yeah.

110
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:09,828
Scott: So last season I would say baccano and this season I have yet to watch the first episode.

111
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:13,220
Scott: but Gundam double-o might be the second coming of Gundam wings.

112
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:14,505
Scott: So that could be good.

113
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:17,015
Rym: or you're excited about it because you haven't seen it yet.

114
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:20,576
Rym: That's happened before Show and then I don't know it's.

115
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:23,228
Scott: I mean it's a Gundam show I haven't seen and it's not Gundam.

116
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:23,911
Scott: see destiny.

117
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:25,680
Scott: So there's a chance it could be good.

118
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,680
Scott: And if there's a good Gundam show, hooray, if it's not, I'll just won't watch it.

119
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,463
Rym: What was that show?

120
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:43,320
Rym: we were all excited about because we didn't listen to Emily and we didn't realize it was the same show And it started out all Aboardage and samurai pirate fighting on the high seas and politics and then it turned into gay samurai and nothing more.

121
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:49,640
Rym: Yeah, I was excited about that for the first five minutes and then it turned out to be like some BL thing.

122
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:52,329
Scott: Yeah guy harem instead of a girl harem.

123
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:54,677
Rym: It was a guy harem with all guys who like all guys.

124
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:59,095
Scott: All right What do you think of controversial or taboo subject?

125
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:00,100
Scott: anime for example?

126
00:08:00,702 --> 00:08:04,427
Scott: kohikaze Or konomo no jinkan, which I've never heard of?

127
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,895
Rym: I think I am all.

128
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:17,867
Rym: when it comes to any controversial media I'm always of the mind that one freedom speech people unless they actually harm people in the making of media, you know, like Then there's no it's a snuff film.

129
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:21,920
Rym: Yeah, then there is nothing wrong with making it no matter what it is.

130
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:32,003
Rym: I don't think that any subject it that could possibly be conceived of it should be taboo in terms of Writing about it or expressing feelings or thoughts or ideas about it but at the same

131
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:38,183
Scott: time has nothing to do with whether I'm going to like it or not or whether I think that other people Should watch it or not

132
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:39,347
Rym: at the same time.

133
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:43,260
Rym: I feel free to form opinions about people who enjoy such media.

134
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:44,419
Scott: I do as well.

135
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,968
Scott: so it pretty much comes down to.

136
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:47,509
Scott: I mean like.

137
00:08:47,951 --> 00:09:08,812
Scott: it's like you could even pick any taboo subject like you know murder or genocide or something and you could you you could have genocide be the focus of a comic or an anime or a video game or movie or any any art form that you know story a narrative art form and You could do it tastefully or Tastelessly.

138
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:12,086
Scott: and if you do it tastefully then it might be enjoyable.

139
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:18,150
Scott: and if you do it tastelessly Then it's crap and I think anyone who you know enjoys it is a pretty terrible person.

140
00:09:18,412 --> 00:09:21,290
Rym: Sometimes that goes over the line into hilarity.

141
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,594
Scott: It sometimes does.

142
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:28,330
Scott: so it pretty much comes down to whether you do it tastefully or not and that is sort of subjective.

143
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:34,914
Scott: But there seems to be some sort of societal agreement on what's tasteful and what's not for you know like you can have.

144
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:43,287
Scott: you know you go to the art movie the art theater and you see a movie that happens to have a Sex scene in it and then you go to the porn theater and you just see you know hardcore banging.

145
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:44,070
Scott: There's a difference.

146
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,013
Scott: They're both sex.

147
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:49,730
Scott: They're both rated X or whatever, but one of them's tasteful one of them's not.

148
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:53,141
Rym: So, uh, what anime is your latest favorite?

149
00:09:53,181 --> 00:09:55,450
Rym: I'll assume that means just any anime not just new stuff.

150
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:06,686
Rym: Well latest favorite my latest favorite right now is I'm finally finishing up Master Keaton And I'm finally finishing up gone kotsuo and they're both the business.

151
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:10,259
Scott: I Haven't watched anime in a month or two.

152
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:10,881
Scott: I don't think.

153
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:12,566
Rym: in fact actually I'm.

154
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:19,030
Rym: I mean I've only got four episodes left of Master Keaton and I'm really sad because I really really like that show.

155
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:22,010
Scott: Yeah, I'm probably gonna watch it on the train sooner or later.

156
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,893
Scott: I beat the Zelda.

157
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:27,809
Rym: the only problem with Master Keaton is that I feel as though it peaked early or may.

158
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:28,937
Rym: I'm not sure we were.

159
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:35,630
Rym: the seasons broke up in Japan But there's one episode called the Cali man of the desert and it happens about two-thirds the way through.

160
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,356
Rym: I think it's episode 25 or 26.

161
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:41,706
Rym: I don't remember but Good God was that that could have been the Master Keaton movie.

162
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:45,002
Rym: as far as I was concerned That was everything that makes that show awesome.

163
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:54,610
Scott: Uh-huh, but moving on Let's see, oh what are your opinions of theatrical releases of anime in the US or elsewhere?

164
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:56,981
Scott: Uh, you know, I like it.

165
00:10:57,082 --> 00:10:58,470
Scott: when they put anime in a movie theater.

166
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,970
Scott: It's one of the few times I'll actually get off my ass and maybe go to the movie theater depending on the end.

167
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,710
Rym: I've caught almost every major anime release in the last several years.

168
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:08,469
Rym: I missed one in particular, but I caught it.

169
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:20,889
Scott: I didn't even I got to tell you I didn't even realize the concept of anime in the theater until I think 1992 thousand when I was in Israel and Princess Mononoke was in the theater there with you know Like English with Hebrew subtitles or something like that.

170
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:22,590
Scott: I didn't actually go see it there.

171
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:27,959
Scott: but I saw the movie poster and I was like, oh and some other guy on the trip had seen it and he was raving about it the whole time.

172
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,780
Scott: and Yeah, I like it when they put anime in the theater.

173
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,904
Scott: I go see it.

174
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:34,310
Scott: What what other opinion do you want?

175
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:34,693
Scott: I don't know.

176
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,470
Rym: I mean, it's great seeing I think.

177
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:42,237
Scott: Yeah, I think that they should market it more heavily and put it in more theaters and they're like, oh No one goes to see it.

178
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:43,769
Scott: The theaters is in our pact.

179
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:46,986
Scott: You just had to push it out more and then more people will see it.

180
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:54,330
Scott: It's like come on Yeah, I mean you take the sales in the theaters It's in and multiply them by you know, the number of theaters in a wide release.

181
00:11:55,171 --> 00:12:02,762
Rym: That's a lot more money than they actually make especially considering that they don't promote anime in theaters for shit And it wouldn't cost that much to do it.

182
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:10,866
Scott: and I and it's not like oh I just want you gotta do is put like the ad in the newspaper Right in the you know in the movie section that says come see this movie.

183
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:22,113
Scott: What a bunch of awards Yeah, and you buy show time you buy a couple of reviews and local papers That's really cheap and then you freaking put like a commercial on TV during like the local news at night like for a week I don't know.

184
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:36,741
Rym: I don't want to get into our opinions on the anime industry in general, but I just think that I Get the impression that most of the American anime industry is won by old school anime fans or new school anime fans And they don't seem to have much business sense at all.

185
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:43,902
Rym: and while maybe oh, it's a labor of love They just want this stuff to come out at the same time They're not really doing anything to spread the genre.

186
00:12:43,922 --> 00:12:47,192
Rym: well not the genre the medium yep Alright.

187
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:48,737
Rym: Oh, this is a good one for Scott.

188
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:50,602
Rym: What comic publishing company.

189
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:53,410
Rym: Do you believe most reliably produces the best content?

190
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,870
Scott: This is a hard question right here because there are a lot of things like I could say vertigo.

191
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,678
Scott: But the problem is vertigo is not a publishing company.

192
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,570
Scott: vertigo is actually an imprint which means it's DC Comics.

193
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,781
Scott: They just put a different label to separate those from the DC Comics.

194
00:13:08,243 --> 00:13:10,210
Scott: so pretty much most vertigo comics are awesome.

195
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,896
Scott: But that's not a publishing company.

196
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:12,638
Scott: It's an imprint.

197
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,841
Scott: so publishing company if you're talking about reliability We have to go by percentage.

198
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:20,175
Scott: like the percentage of the stuff They put out that's quality.

199
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:24,754
Scott: so if a company came out with one comic, and it was high quality Then they're the winner.

200
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:29,450
Scott: they got a hundred percent versus someone other company that puts out a hundred things and 99 of them are good.

201
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:33,009
Scott: Then they're not the most reliable even though they put out more good stuff.

202
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:36,321
Scott: So most reliably produces the best content.

203
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:41,617
Scott: well the one that I know for sure is Reliable is vertical not vertigo.

204
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:45,730
Scott: vertical incorporated, which is actually not strictly a comic publisher.

205
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:47,419
Scott: They are a book.

206
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:54,470
Scott: basically they publish Japanese books in English But they're putting out all the Tezuka and the keiko Takami, and they never put out anything bad ever.

207
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:57,190
Scott: It's a hundred percent across the board so vertical incorporated.

208
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:03,890
Scott: But there's a chance that red five comics could be the second hundred percent comic publisher.

209
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:12,928
Scott: they are putting out the atom robo and such you know by the Brian clevenger of 8-bit theater fame, so you should buy that at the style of that.

210
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:19,629
Scott: I mean It's already in the stores now if you want it But it's coming for me at the end of the month, and I liked 8-bit theater a lot.

211
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,279
Rym: But goddamn is that comic exactly what I want?

212
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:30,039
Scott: imagine like Indiana Jones more badass and a robot a cool robot But not not wise kraken robot.

213
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:32,990
Rym: you're imagining a robot, and you're not imagining the right kind of row.

214
00:14:33,994 --> 00:14:37,970
Rym: And this is pretty much almost the same spider-man plus, Indiana Jones plus robot.

215
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:41,800
Rym: Which comic book author is most reliably involved in the best project?

216
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,702
Rym: so Samu Tezuka.

217
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,527
Scott: some with Tezuka, but he's dead.

218
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:50,905
Scott: so living Brian cave on Brian cave on he can write no wrong all right good now.

219
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:52,069
Rym: You can do this really long one.

220
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:58,008
Scott: During the last 10 years the rate at which comic books are being adapted to an audio visual media is increased in the audience.

221
00:14:58,048 --> 00:14:58,989
Scott: consumption is grown.

222
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:01,441
Scott: EG spider-man x-men to prevent that etc.

223
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:03,430
Rym: correct use of eg good job.

224
00:15:03,691 --> 00:15:06,590
Scott: Do you think this signifies a change on the product side of audio-visual?

225
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,537
Scott: Entertainment on the consumption side of it.

226
00:15:08,818 --> 00:15:13,196
Scott: if those in charge of audio-visual entertainment keep producing comic book movies Well the audience keep watching it.

227
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:14,843
Scott: or will they get bored and move on to the next fag?

228
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:15,225
Rym: well.

229
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:19,465
Rym: I point out that spider-man 3 and x-men 3 didn't do so.

230
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:20,389
Rym: well and we're crap.

231
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:31,332
Scott: I Want to point out that the only thing the only thing that is to be learned from all these comic book movies Is that you know we used to think we used to joke about like all Hollywood's run out of ideas They keep putting out.

232
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:33,539
Scott: see no they've really run out of ideas.

233
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,221
Scott: They're basically.

234
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:35,645
Scott: Hollywood has no writers left.

235
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:41,802
Scott: They can't come up with a single Interesting or new movie plot or script.

236
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:44,430
Scott: or you know whether they call it screenplay.

237
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:46,041
Scott: I mean you don't have any of them.

238
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:49,679
Scott: there are exceptions I think very few compared to what it used to be.

239
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,430
Rym: I think the I mean I wouldn't go quite that far.

240
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:59,977
Rym: But I would say that I think the general problem is that the Hollywood industry is as it has been at many points in its Existence very risk-averse right now.

241
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:01,722
Scott: Yep, so they're just.

242
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:02,424
Scott: you know it's.

243
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:16,870
Scott: it's relatively easy to Adapt say a comic to a movie than it is to adapt say a book to a movie because you already sort of have like these Storyboards done for you and stuff like that and you could even do like a Sin City job where it's like a direct translation.

244
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:18,639
Scott: You know so it's.

245
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:20,970
Scott: it's very you know Hollywood people.

246
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:26,969
Scott: They like to turn comics into movies and they're optioning comics to turn into movies all the time And it's proven to be a success in the past.

247
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:32,173
Scott: So if it's proven to be a success in the past they want to take a risk on doing something else like writing a brand New screenplay.

248
00:16:32,454 --> 00:16:35,907
Scott: they'll do something that they at least know has kind of worked in the past.

249
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:39,440
Rym: plus remember Normal like most people out there the audiences.

250
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:41,790
Rym: They don't know that V for Vendetta was a comic.

251
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,861
Rym: They don't know that yeah, he was a comic.

252
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:46,055
Rym: No one knows that 300 was a comic.

253
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:52,145
Scott: yeah They might say you know on the the movie poster like based on the graphic novel.

254
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,510
Rym: or no one looks at that.

255
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,230
Scott: They might you know in the bookstore people might see it.

256
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:02,786
Scott: But the vast majority of people have no idea Like even if you put it right in front of their face like what to say V for Vendetta.

257
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:05,336
Scott: right right at the beginning of V for Vendetta it says DC Comics.

258
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:08,690
Scott: most people you say hey V for Vendetta like oh, yeah, that was a good movie.

259
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:10,175
Scott: They don't even know this fucking comic.

260
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:10,958
Scott: They don't know Alan Morris.

261
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:11,621
Scott: They don't know anything.

262
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:14,009
Scott: so Hollywood people are just gonna milk it.

263
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:20,349
Rym: So anime in the HD DVD blu-ray versus the DVD format worthwhile or not?

264
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:27,127
Scott: Well first of all I mean, I'm not I'm asking a question here I don't know, but how many anime were actually made in HD?

265
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,750
Scott: I mean if the anime is not made in HD like I don't know Akira.

266
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:43,339
Scott: well Akira was made on film so you could transfer that to HD, but Say what an old anime that wasn't made on film for the movie theater say initial D Initial D is not gonna do any bad.

267
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:45,129
Rym: initial D would look like shit in HD.

268
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:47,298
Rym: Well, I mean I like initial D.

269
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:50,050
Scott: Hey Eric, how I bebop can I bebop wouldn't do so well in HD.

270
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:51,917
Scott: It's made for a TV screen.

271
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:52,961
Scott: It's not widescreen.

272
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:53,563
Scott: It's not HD.

273
00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:57,076
Scott: It's it's just normal Resolution whatever.

274
00:17:57,216 --> 00:17:59,590
Scott: well putting it on an HD DVD isn't gonna help it out.

275
00:17:59,891 --> 00:18:02,338
Rym: I watched some of the Bandai visual like.

276
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:04,264
Rym: check out how high quality this stuff is.

277
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,868
Scott: oh yeah, see that was freedom They were showing.

278
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:10,720
Scott: What I'm saying is what is made in age.

279
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:18,029
Rym: what I'm saying before you interrupted me is that yeah I watched some of that stuff, and you know what it didn't really look much better than.

280
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:22,050
Rym: There's no reason to buy anime on an HD DVD.

281
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:30,613
Scott: I mean we watched freedom right the first episode on a downloaded fan sub so even less than DVD quality and still look pretty Fucking amazing.

282
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:40,130
Scott: I mean it was more amazing admittedly on the HD TV from the you know at Otakon But not worth the price of an HD DVD player an HD.

283
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:41,900
Rym: Well look at this an HD TV.

284
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,159
Rym: unless you had them side by side You would not be able to tell.

285
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:51,890
Rym: and it's just for anime of course I don't think it's even worthwhile for movies me there let alone for and then the price comes way down.

286
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:54,803
Rym: Yeah, especially since anime attempts to be a lot simpler.

287
00:18:54,823 --> 00:18:56,693
Rym: You know cell shading that sort of thing It's not.

288
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:59,628
Rym: it's not the kind of thing that's gonna be benefited in any way.

289
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:03,007
Scott: Yep, except well freedom is actually like one of the.

290
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:06,081
Scott: you know If there's an anime that's gonna benefit that's gonna be.

291
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:07,788
Rym: yeah, but what I was saying was that didn't really.

292
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:07,869
Rym: yep.

293
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,281
Scott: Okay Why is the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is so popular.

294
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,090
Rym: and what is Haruism all right for the first part?

295
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:16,812
Rym: It's.

296
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:19,346
Rym: I haven't seen it yet, but a lot of my friends have and I've read about it.

297
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,089
Rym: I want to see it.

298
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:23,390
Rym: It's just a really clever funny good show that's well animated

299
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:33,646
Scott: And I think it's a show from what I've heard that is sort of you know made to like target the fans Right at the core the same way that you know a lot of video games like just they.

300
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:37,037
Scott: they know their audience And they go straight for it with everything.

301
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:37,579
Scott: They've got.

302
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:37,880
Scott: you know.

303
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,307
Scott: this show is like we know what otaku like.

304
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:44,961
Scott: let's stroke Every part of them that likes to be stroked and this show does it.

305
00:19:45,523 --> 00:19:47,190
Rym: so in terms of what is hurry ism?

306
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,990
Rym: And I've also seen it written as Haruhi ism now the same as Naruto ism only for Haruhi.

307
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:59,963
Rym: I mean I've seen a lot of people trying to make it out to be something more, but and Unless there's some academic dissertation.

308
00:20:00,003 --> 00:20:09,909
Rym: I'm missing from what I can gather It's just one of those memes yeah where people kind of worship Haruhi in this kind of funny way And it looks very 4chan-y, and that's all I really have to say about that.

309
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:14,270
Rym: So can you actually get caught torrenting anime?

310
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:22,812
Scott: Well the first question is a technological question for Monday, which is yeah, you actually get caught torrenting anything which Technologically?

311
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:36,490
Scott: yes, there are things you can do to make it harder for anyone to to create reasonable doubt as to whether you were Torrenting or not and what you were torrenting and stuff like that including encryption and proxies and who knows what or even just reason.

312
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:38,078
Rym: I mean getting caught is not the thing.

313
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:41,333
Rym: what I think you really mean is could there be any Consequences?

314
00:20:41,454 --> 00:20:47,681
Rym: and it depends on if you were torrenting something that has been released in the United States yet Or not and it depends who is watching.

315
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:49,650
Scott: for example there have been in the past.

316
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:57,230
Scott: I think the closest people have come to dangerous situations is when Bandai Japan said do not pirate solid-state society.

317
00:20:57,331 --> 00:20:58,119
Scott: We will come get you.

318
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:10,229
Rym: do not fansub it but even then there's not much they could have done because being sued by a Japanese company when you're US citizen and Getting get them getting to the point where they can identify you from an IP and all that.

319
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:15,426
Rym: I'm not a lawyer, but it seems highly unlikely it is.

320
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:16,750
Scott: there is not nothing.

321
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:17,513
Scott: It's not like.

322
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:28,530
Scott: I can't say there's nothing to worry about, but if you just pay attention to anime news a Come at least the current the current situation Companies will make a threat before they do anything.

323
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:29,434
Rym: I'm just saying there's.

324
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,482
Rym: I'm pretty sure there's nothing to worry about at all.

325
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:36,922
Rym: the only time you would need to worry is if you Were torrenting or pirating things that have been released in the u.s..

326
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:39,050
Scott: Straight torrent fansubs and anime ski.

327
00:21:39,271 --> 00:21:42,461
Scott: I would say you're 99% safe if you're torrenting trigon.

328
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:44,969
Rym: well one you shouldn't be torrenting trigon and two.

329
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,674
Rym: Well yeah, that's it.

330
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:47,717
Scott: Yeah, you deserve what you get.

331
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:52,310
Scott: all right does the definition of anime include made in Japan?

332
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:55,290
Scott: I can something be made in the US and be accepted as an anime?

333
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:55,892
Scott: You know what?

334
00:21:55,952 --> 00:22:08,366
Rym: I don't care about this anymore because there's there's two camps, and they're mutually exclusive and on one side They're the anime world order types who say by definition It is anime if it is animated and from the nation of Japan.

335
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:14,810
Rym: and on the other side There's people who say yeah, it's just anything animated that looks like that or it's just anything animated at all.

336
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,553
Scott: But then what if some?

337
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:23,756
Scott: there's a lot of things that are made you know for Japan like look crayon Shin-chan doesn't look like anime style But that's an anime or even even better.

338
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:29,150
Rym: the word anime or anime is a French word that just means animation.

339
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:34,210
Scott: Well and also the word is you know animation and they just shorten it to anime.

340
00:22:34,351 --> 00:22:35,073
Rym: But even better.

341
00:22:35,194 --> 00:22:39,390
Rym: in Japan from what I gather they call a lot pretty much anything animated.

342
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,436
Scott: Yeah, the Simpsons.

343
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:42,889
Scott: if you go to Japan and you say is the Simpsons an anime?

344
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:49,872
Scott: They would say yes, the Simpsons is an anime because they don't have a different word for something from their country and something from another Country.

345
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:56,079
Scott: they just use the word anime for all Animation whether it's movies or TV or from whatever country.

346
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:03,186
Scott: the only reason we use the word anime is because we like to make a Difference between things that come from our country and things that come from.

347
00:23:03,206 --> 00:23:10,069
Rym: well actually no I was going to say because I noticed that this didn't really happen with French animation It's just with Japanese stuff.

348
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:20,250
Rym: And I think the reason is that for most anime fans when they saw anime It was just in general what they saw was very very different from American media.

349
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:31,090
Rym: the stories were just very different and a lot anime seemed like a genre to a lot of early fans just because The storytelling was a lot different the visualization was a lot different.

350
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,372
Rym: It was.

351
00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:44,590
Rym: it was better in a lot of people's eyes And they kind of associated all those things that they saw in anime as this kind of Overarching genre and this is why these people became anime fans rather than fans of animation from around the world in general.

352
00:23:44,993 --> 00:23:51,690
Rym: So the real answer is that it doesn't matter at all And if you ever argue with someone over whether something is anime or not you really need to get a life.

353
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:58,030
Scott: Yeah, I mean just if you want call everything animation or start calling the Simpsons anime if you want to be really Japanese.

354
00:23:58,151 --> 00:24:14,103
Scott: but I guess the only thing I have to say is that as As I like words to be useful, and if we have words You know I like to give them the definition that makes the most sense in terms of using them in ways that make Conversation easier and allow communication to be you know facilitated.

355
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:15,910
Rym: for example the argument over.

356
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:20,109
Rym: You know they decided that Pluto is no longer a planet and there were people who?

357
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,430
Rym: Protested this and I think all of those people are categorically stupid.

358
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:32,670
Rym: yeah, because the reason Pluto is no longer a planet is because we've realized that there's a bit a bunch of things that are Bigger than Pluto or the same size as Pluto out there.

359
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:41,619
Rym: And if we call Pluto a planet then we either have to call all those things planets too or the word planet now means dick Yep, so I like words to have to be useful.

360
00:24:41,699 --> 00:24:46,336
Scott: so speaking that we speak the English language and not the Japanese language I think in English.

361
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:49,288
Scott: You know we've taken a lot of foreign words like croissant.

362
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,310
Scott: right We don't say hooked roll or something like that.

363
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,419
Scott: You know it's much easier to say croissant.

364
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:02,150
Scott: so we can take words from other countries like Anime and use them for our own purposes, and I think for the purposes of usefulness in language.

365
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:12,007
Scott: I think it is good to use the word anime to mean Animation from Japan or for Japanese audience is the most useful way to use the term and that's what I use it for.

366
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:16,210
Scott: but whatever Like if someone says I'm not gonna get hung up about it and go crazy.

367
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,700
Rym: Well like a lot of people say oh avatar is very anime isher.

368
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,783
Rym: It's very much like anime.

369
00:25:20,803 --> 00:25:23,130
Rym: You know what that's kind of true?

370
00:25:23,591 --> 00:25:31,170
Rym: It's a lot of the elements of avatar are very similar to a lot of elements commonly seen in Japanese animation.

371
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:32,636
Rym: Yeah, so there in fact.

372
00:25:33,037 --> 00:25:37,636
Rym: I ran into a kid while I was at work, and he was playing the Naruto game And I just started to talk to him.

373
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:38,721
Rym: He's a little kid, and I was like.

374
00:25:38,762 --> 00:25:40,793
Rym: so uh what other cartoons he like?

375
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:48,442
Rym: he's like yeah, Naruto and One Piece and Avatar and he considered all three of those to be anime from Japan.

376
00:25:48,803 --> 00:25:52,234
Rym: and when I told him that avatar was made in the US He didn't believe me.

377
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:52,897
Rym: He's like Americans.

378
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:53,941
Rym: Can't do something that good.

379
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:56,310
Rym: Yeah, I just found that funny.

380
00:25:56,531 --> 00:26:02,717
Rym: Yep, all right, so if more anime could go in the direction that music has been ie Downloadable for a fee.

381
00:26:02,818 --> 00:26:04,869
Rym: again good use of ie correct mm-hmm?

382
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:08,061
Rym: What do you believe would be the most profitable price per episode?

383
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:08,221
Rym: well?

384
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:13,798
Rym: Let's see 26 episodes in an average series 2 bucks It's close.

385
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:20,570
Scott: I think right now I'm willing to pay like 40 bucks for a thin pack of a 26 episode thing, but I'm getting DVDs.

386
00:26:20,731 --> 00:26:23,528
Scott: So it's gotta be less than 40 bucks for 26 episodes I don't know.

387
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:30,808
Rym: I'd almost be willing to pay a little bit more for the convenience and the fact that I can watch it as it comes out And I don't have to deal with physical media, which I'm getting more and more sick of.

388
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:34,194
Scott: I don't like.

389
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:36,301
Scott: I see I would like see.

390
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:38,830
Scott: actually here you go ready per episode basis.

391
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:40,856
Scott: I say five bucks an episode.

392
00:26:40,936 --> 00:26:47,566
Scott: right, but first episode is always free and you can pay 40 bucks to get the whole season.

393
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:51,423
Rym: well I'll go one step further and say I'll say that I don't buy anime and it's.

394
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,754
Scott: and I'm yeah Netflix it all right That's the thing.

395
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:54,720
Rym: I'm fee.

396
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,585
Rym: I'm getting to the point.

397
00:26:55,645 --> 00:27:06,581
Rym: and it's not just anime It's all media other than video games because it doesn't really work with video games, but for all like movies and of any kind I have no desire to buy anything ever.

398
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:11,570
Rym: and the idea of buying a DVD is Kind of important to me because it's just like I don't like face.

399
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,913
Scott: Yeah I don't like owning things you know taking up physical space in my house not even that even Digitally.

400
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:21,450
Scott: if I'm gonna watch it once why should I pay to keep it around on a hard drive somewhere?

401
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,473
Rym: You know I'm just.

402
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:26,910
Rym: I'm of the mind that I would I would pay to be able to rent digitally anime.

403
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:32,550
Rym: The problem is renting is the same as owning unless you add DRM, but you know what if anime were digital?

404
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,769
Rym: I'd probably buy it if it was cheap enough and then delete it.

405
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:43,250
Scott: Yeah So it's got to be the basically this the equivalent price of Netflix in the series and then Watch him and then delete them.

406
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,036
Rym: I mean I only buy anything.

407
00:27:45,176 --> 00:27:48,969
Scott: well any you know DVD if it's but I do want to be able to download if I'm.

408
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:59,176
Scott: if They're technically saying that I own them I won't be able to download it again Whenever I want in case I want to show a friend or something or in the very least if it's no DRM So I can back it up.

409
00:27:59,236 --> 00:27:59,518
Rym: However.

410
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:01,189
Rym: I want yep, okay?

411
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:04,216
Scott: Why do anime?

412
00:28:04,336 --> 00:28:07,389
Scott: opening song lyrics never make any sense?

413
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:18,863
Rym: All right well part of that is that most of what you're thinking about is either Engrish II kind of openings like the opener to Nana Which is just any time.

414
00:28:18,883 --> 00:28:26,594
Rym: a lot of Japanese songs Just kind of do that and a lot of times the lyrics don't make any sense particularly in just you know pop music and Sadly a lot of j-rock.

415
00:28:26,995 --> 00:28:32,129
Scott: wait listen think about some songs in the u.s.. Right like some Britney Spears song.

416
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,939
Scott: no No, no like songs that really they're.

417
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:37,082
Scott: they're concentrating on the.

418
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:44,477
Scott: what the lyrics are is is the primary thing in the music Comes second right like for example Christian music or you know things like that.

419
00:28:44,517 --> 00:28:49,151
Scott: where they really want to put they already figured out the words first and the music Second.

420
00:28:49,252 --> 00:29:05,014
Scott: so what ends up happening is the music sort of suffers and the the words they have to sort of gimmick the words around And like add in like syllables here and there to make it sound right and not be stupid or impossible to sing Anime music.

421
00:29:05,175 --> 00:29:14,210
Scott: what they tend to do is rather than worry about what they're saying first and foremost They actually worry about the music first and foremost and as a result the lyrics often.

422
00:29:14,651 --> 00:29:25,098
Rym: Actually, I was going to say that a lot of anime put out in the late 80s and 90s had openers that were basically just pop Songs sometimes semi-popular pop song.

423
00:29:25,118 --> 00:29:34,870
Rym: that also or song is that they were trying to then make popular and like for example The opener to Dominion Tank Police in Japan is crap pop nothing.

424
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:44,093
Rym: I kind of like the song since every move I like the song actually like it's kind of a guy could listen to it, but How did you know?

425
00:29:44,113 --> 00:29:57,670
Scott: it's that I was also a problem of Japanese people writing a song in English because the English sounds cool Not because they know what the English means all the time, but there are a lot of Anime songs openers and closers where the lyrics like for example gone kotsuo.

426
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:00,736
Scott: That's written by a French guy.

427
00:30:00,816 --> 00:30:02,140
Rym: Yeah, but even Jean-Jacques.

428
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,264
Rym: What's his name Jean-Jacques?

429
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:03,886
Scott: better now?

430
00:30:03,926 --> 00:30:04,388
Scott: Yes.

431
00:30:04,729 --> 00:30:11,069
Rym: Yes But listen to that song and the lyrics are basically here's the plot of the count of Monte Cristo.

432
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:13,382
Scott: Yeah, but he's a he's a very famous song.

433
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:21,658
Rym: Yes, our Utena is an example or it doesn't matter not so much the opener because actually the openings a day But the opening song to Utena.

434
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,370
Rym: actually the lyrics like they kind of fit.

435
00:30:25,178 --> 00:30:30,565
Rym: They don't fit perfectly But they kind of make sense in the way that most pop kind of songs make sense.

436
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:35,529
Rym: and the dual music Usually doesn't mean much but at the same time it sounds really cool.

437
00:30:36,276 --> 00:30:37,829
Rym: All right, I don't have anything else to say.

438
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:42,810
Rym: What is the average production value of an anime movie and series per episode?

439
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:45,123
Scott: No idea if I know millions of dollars.

440
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,310
Scott: it depends on the show.

441
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,381
Scott: I mean some shows are stupidly cheap and they spend nothing on them.

442
00:30:49,421 --> 00:30:52,592
Scott: and some shows they spend a zillion dollars on like goes In the shell.

443
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:57,010
Scott: and some shows some movies are stupidly cheap and some cost a zillion dollars.

444
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:05,740
Rym: It's and that's not even getting into the cost of you know, releasing things in America where no one ever says anything The cost of marketing or producing merchandise or all the.

445
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,084
Scott: you know millions of dollars.

446
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:09,110
Scott: There you go five bucks.

447
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:11,457
Scott: Why is CG used in anime?

448
00:31:11,517 --> 00:31:13,644
Scott: anything that is CG seems that it can be drawn.

449
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:15,450
Scott: instead you say that about anything.

450
00:31:15,693 --> 00:31:24,749
Scott: Okay, first of all, right You know, you look you're watching an anime and you'll you'll say oh that looks like CG, you know Cuz it'll be like some 3d battleship or something like that.

451
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:25,913
Scott: Do you realize that?

452
00:31:26,214 --> 00:31:32,294
Scott: no no anime that you watch nowadays except for Sazae-san is Animated on cells.

453
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:38,457
Scott: everything is done entirely with computers full metal alchemist whole things computers Hara hey, Susan, man whole thing is computers.

454
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:39,802
Scott: It's all CG.

455
00:31:39,862 --> 00:31:41,246
Scott: The 2d is CG.

456
00:31:41,687 --> 00:31:42,269
Scott: Everything is CG.

457
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:46,869
Scott: So I think what you're all you're noticing is the 3d stuff that looks different than the 2d.

458
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,336
Rym: So and there are two reasons.

459
00:31:48,537 --> 00:31:56,470
Rym: one a lot of times especially in a lower budget show It's a lot if something's three-dimensional or has to move three-dimensionally like really three-dimensionally.

460
00:31:57,132 --> 00:32:00,687
Rym: It's a lot cheaper to make some CG than it is to animate that.

461
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:08,099
Scott: Yep But if you watch some of the higher production value shows say goes in the shell The 3d looks 2d.

462
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,366
Scott: You won't even notice that this 3d there.

463
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,190
Scott: It's so subtle because they spend a lot more money on their technology.

464
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:18,409
Scott: So the real thing you basically you're saying is I don't like it when they don't spend enough money on their 3d.

465
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,354
Scott: And I agree if someone's gonna put 3d in their anime Why you know?

466
00:32:22,655 --> 00:32:29,281
Scott: you should just spend more money on it to make it look right and not stand out like a sore thumb like A Scooby-doo, it's bet you're better off doing a 2d.

467
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:31,190
Scott: if you don't, you know, huh right along those lines.

468
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:34,020
Rym: What is your opinion on CG animation in an anime?

469
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,010
Scott: aesthetic wise I like it when it doesn't Scooby-doo.

470
00:32:37,451 --> 00:32:39,497
Rym: Yeah, I mean some shows use it really well.

471
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:46,005
Rym: some shows are initially some yeah PlayStation 1 graphics for the win All right.

472
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:51,267
Scott: In what ways is a manga better or worse than a novel counterpart?

473
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:52,010
Scott: on the same note?

474
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,710
Scott: What are the dis and advantages of an anime versus live-action?

475
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:01,170
Rym: You know, I could give a long complicated answer and I have a lot to say but it really just comes down to.

476
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:04,038
Rym: It's a different medium and different me.

477
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:06,145
Scott: It's like saying how's this painting?

478
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:07,990
Scott: How would this painting do in sculpture?

479
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,743
Rym: How would this painting do in scrimshaw?

480
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:11,829
Scott: Yeah, how would this?

481
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:19,476
Rym: needle point do in a live-action Musical with children's choir?

482
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:20,259
Scott: exactly.

483
00:33:21,022 --> 00:33:23,129
Scott: It's like there's different mediums of art.

484
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:37,064
Scott: You can express yourself in different ways, you know with with ink on paper with oil on canvas with Limestone on chisel whatever and There's different things to know about each medium and they're all different.

485
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:40,681
Scott: and there's a dissident Advantages to all of them and there's.

486
00:33:40,741 --> 00:33:42,170
Scott: none of them are better or worse.

487
00:33:42,511 --> 00:33:43,154
Scott: I did any other.

488
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:45,706
Rym: I mean I could say cuz I there's a lot of things to say.

489
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:47,393
Rym: just papercraft I just think it.

490
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:49,521
Rym: it wouldn't be interesting to go through all the.

491
00:33:49,882 --> 00:34:02,467
Rym: well in manga you get to Visually make the frame and make the scene but in a novel you have to describe it and leave it up to the imagination Whatever and not going to go and describe the difference of every artistic medium ever.

492
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:03,130
Scott: there's a lot of them.

493
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:07,410
Rym: Why do you think people generally look down on cartoons anime, whatever?

494
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:19,510
Rym: In Japan, I mean, it's not like everyone watches the ghost in the shell anime or anything But it's generally kind of an American thing where cartoons are kind of looked down upon.

495
00:34:19,831 --> 00:34:23,103
Scott: Yeah in Scandinavian countries Donald Duck is the business.

496
00:34:23,565 --> 00:34:24,710
Rym: I should live in Scandinavia.

497
00:34:25,331 --> 00:34:26,678
Rym: Everything's telling me to move there.

498
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:27,219
Scott: I know.

499
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,670
Scott: however, you know, it's pretty much in America.

500
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:36,118
Scott: we have had a culture and because of things like the Comics Code Authority and censorship on television.

501
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:53,165
Scott: and you know animation and comics and those sorts of things were generally relegated and Culturally assumed to be mediums of art in which you could only create art For the enjoyment of by children and not for any other demographics.

502
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:55,393
Scott: and of course, that's false Completely.

503
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:59,190
Scott: you can mix you can appeal to any target demographic in any artistic medium.

504
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:02,986
Scott: You can make paper craft for one-year-olds paper craft for million-year-olds.

505
00:35:03,106 --> 00:35:03,669
Scott: It doesn't matter.

506
00:35:04,793 --> 00:35:14,526
Scott: but because that was the way it was for so long and because that was the you know, The impression people had and sort of the the dogma of the society it stuck around.

507
00:35:14,587 --> 00:35:27,650
Scott: and now the old people Pretty much anyone 30 and older and even people younger than that even little kids Nowadays, you know, they think that cartoons are for kids and some things are breaking that like Adult Swim, you know.

508
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:35,382
Rym: But at the same time that's why a lot of your 13 year old girls are reading scary hardcore reality and their mom has no idea.

509
00:35:35,402 --> 00:35:43,102
Scott: Yep, so Yeah, as soon as you know Pretty much when the old people die that will be a thing of the past.

510
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:49,890
Rym: I just there's a related question right here How do you how would you change cartoons anime whatever so that they would be taken more seriously?

511
00:35:50,555 --> 00:35:52,186
Rym: One I wouldn't I wouldn't even bother to.

512
00:35:52,227 --> 00:35:52,670
Rym: I don't care.

513
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,930
Scott: The only way you could do it is with a massive expensive PR campaign.

514
00:35:57,111 --> 00:35:59,501
Rym: Well, no, I think it's the question really hits upon this.

515
00:36:00,144 --> 00:36:11,667
Rym: a lot of people who have like a we It's almost like a lot of we and anime people have this almost inferiority complex of my thing is serious business and the world's got to take my business seriously.

516
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:13,372
Rym: and I got to get people to Respect.

517
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:17,330
Rym: and you know what if I like something I don't care if other people respect it or not.

518
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,401
Rym: I like it because I like it.

519
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:22,699
Scott: Yeah And yeah short of a massive PR campaign.

520
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,646
Scott: You got to wait till all the old people die.

521
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:25,870
Scott: That's pretty much all you got.

522
00:36:26,195 --> 00:36:26,846
Rym: Oh my god.

523
00:36:27,512 --> 00:36:29,740
Rym: Okay, I just read what the next question is.

524
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:31,125
Rym: Okay, you can read it.

525
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:32,169
Scott: Let me find it.

526
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:34,753
Scott: Hold on Do you?

527
00:36:34,894 --> 00:36:37,990
Scott: you have been given an arbitrary large amount of money to create an anime manga.

528
00:36:38,111 --> 00:36:38,918
Rym: Oh, I guess I skipped about.

529
00:36:38,938 --> 00:36:40,330
Rym: I was looking at a different question anyway.

530
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:42,616
Scott: Okay.

531
00:36:42,677 --> 00:36:43,142
Scott: Oh wait.

532
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:44,854
Scott: Oh Cuz I was okay.

533
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:45,155
Scott: I got it.

534
00:36:45,396 --> 00:36:45,517
Scott: Good.

535
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,204
Scott: What is the main purpose of hentai?

536
00:36:47,224 --> 00:36:48,370
Scott: to beat off?

537
00:36:49,193 --> 00:36:51,200
Scott: That is is it just something funny at all?

538
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,750
Scott: watch with friends who are most people actually getting off.

539
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,777
Rym: Most people are actually getting off to it.

540
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:58,446
Rym: Good God now hentai.

541
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,209
Scott: see the main.

542
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:03,000
Scott: you're asking What is the main purpose of hentai which is for perverts?

543
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,570
Scott: hentai means pervert in Japanese for perverts to get off?

544
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,830
Scott: That's the main purpose.

545
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:19,465
Scott: however a side effect is that you can use something that perverts get off to in an ironic fashion to entertain yourself if you Put it in the right context for a side effect.

546
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:20,510
Scott: That's not the main purpose.

547
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:29,029
Rym: I mean the good thing is if you go to you can always tell you go to an anime con and every big one there'll be some sort of hentai showing or something somewhere.

548
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:39,629
Rym: and Sometimes especially if it's a bigger crowd if you go into that room It's mostly people like us and they're laughing hysterically and MST3K the whole thing.

549
00:37:40,453 --> 00:37:43,950
Rym: But every now and then you go to a small con you walk into the hentai room.

550
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:50,332
Rym: There's five guys and they're just watching it and that's super creepy super creepy All right.

551
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,625
Scott: So here's the reason I messed up and picking the right question.

552
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:57,290
Scott: The next question is Do anime manga comics need to be taken more seriously?

553
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,284
Scott: That is lack of respect for anime manga comics a major problem with those media for you.

554
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:02,228
Rym: No, it's not.

555
00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:03,267
Rym: All right All right.

556
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,836
Scott: Now here's the question I started to read.

557
00:38:05,037 --> 00:38:10,923
Scott: you have been given an arbitrarily large amount of money to create an anime manga Comic or to hire someone to create it for you.

558
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:12,170
Scott: What is created?

559
00:38:14,573 --> 00:38:17,669
Rym: That's a really difficult to answer open question.

560
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:20,301
Rym: I Couldn't say it all what I do.

561
00:38:20,402 --> 00:38:24,110
Scott: I couldn't pick just one But I'll just pick something that happens to be on my mind lately.

562
00:38:24,611 --> 00:38:32,010
Scott: I would take the plot of a shounen fighting show but make the fighting actual choreographed fighting like cowboy bebop and not stupid.

563
00:38:32,112 --> 00:38:32,950
Scott: I will use this technique.

564
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,216
Scott: I was this technique and it only.

565
00:38:34,296 --> 00:38:37,430
Scott: it would be less than 39 episodes and it'd be the best show ever.

566
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:38,428
Scott: You know what I would do?

567
00:38:38,772 --> 00:38:54,150
Rym: I don't I can't say what the creative direction would be But I would try to get together the talent of the world to create a new good serious Not really science fiction but fantasy anime because there aren't a lot of really good like straight-up.

568
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,782
Scott: Would it be more like a slayers or more like more like eska flown a?

569
00:38:57,842 --> 00:39:00,370
Rym: I think something kind like that robot in there.

570
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,726
Scott: Throw a little bit of school in there appeals to the wide audience.

571
00:39:02,746 --> 00:39:03,310
Rym: something like that.

572
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,944
Rym: I quality music as component is one of my favorite shows ever.

573
00:39:07,185 --> 00:39:08,510
Rym: the other thing is just out of the blue.

574
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:10,509
Rym: I just thought of this because I've always thought about this.

575
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:17,591
Rym: I'd either make a movie adaptation of the plot of Final Fantasy 4 or an OAV adaptation of the plot of Final Fantasy 6.

576
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:22,610
Scott: I might do also do something like an Akira television series to actually sort of adapt the manga.

577
00:39:22,951 --> 00:39:28,029
Scott: That might be tough the correct way, but if you had money, yeah, it says arbitrarily large amount of money.

578
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:32,963
Rym: Alright, the next question is what is the next step for anime?

579
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,407
Rym: Where is the medium going?

580
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:35,410
Scott: It's not going anywhere.

581
00:39:35,652 --> 00:39:37,610
Rym: Well, I think there are two answers.

582
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:52,597
Rym: there's what's the next step as it should be and what's the next step as it is because as it should be is the anime industry in America kind of coming together to try to mass-market this stuff and where I see it going is Nowhere,

583
00:39:52,637 --> 00:39:54,128
Scott: it's not gonna keep going as it's

584
00:39:54,148 --> 00:39:54,430
Rym: going.

585
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:57,281
Rym: I feel like it's kind of stagnating in the US and it.

586
00:39:57,763 --> 00:39:59,490
Rym: it doesn't worry me yet, but it's not a good.

587
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:00,976
Rym: It's not growing.

588
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:02,442
Rym: It's kind of like it's treading water.

589
00:40:02,562 --> 00:40:09,250
Rym: That's all it's been able to do for a long time Yep, and I feel like it wouldn't be that hard to start swimming, but no one seems to try.

590
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,293
Rym: I mean no one.

591
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:13,361
Rym: when was the last time an anime company took a risk.

592
00:40:13,401 --> 00:40:14,605
Rym: That wasn't a stupid risk.

593
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:15,367
Rym: No.

594
00:40:15,387 --> 00:40:16,450
Rym: Yeah, I rest my case.

595
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:18,550
Scott: What's the next step for comics?

596
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,078
Scott: Where is the medium going both artistically and financially?

597
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,390
Rym: this one's easy trades all the way and I think issues are gonna disappear.

598
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:31,570
Scott: I think it'll take a while because as the you know Again, all these people are holding on to it fiercely and there's like a big tradition of it.

599
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:37,150
Scott: But I think as time goes on the issues are gonna go down and down and the trades are gonna go up and up.

600
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:44,949
Rym: I also think the traditional idea of a superhero is going not disappear because nothing disappears, but spider-man will always be there Don't worry.

601
00:40:45,252 --> 00:40:57,777
Rym: I just think that on average that sort of aesthetic of you know The costume wearing superhero will disappear except in ironic senses nostalgic senses and Watchmen style sense.

602
00:40:57,857 --> 00:40:59,928
Scott: It might take a long time because you were gonna have to.

603
00:40:59,948 --> 00:41:00,511
Scott: you know Cuz.

604
00:41:00,551 --> 00:41:12,870
Scott: basically things are being kept the way they are Because the existing fan base which is not really growing or shrinking so much is sort of Maintaining a status quo and holding on to it for dear life.

605
00:41:13,051 --> 00:41:41,088
Scott: But the only thing that's gonna slow that down is When those people who have been underwear pervert fans since the Stan Lee days and continue to collect now and forever When they actually again start dying or you know Start stop collecting or whatever and the people of this crazy collector's mentality stop doing it then Marvel and DC and all them will be forced to abandon their superhero ways and try to do something new or Let the medium go by the wayside and become super niche and it'll be just.

606
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:52,290
Rym: you know indie stuff because it's happening that the traditional comic industry is not doing well and You know so-called indie comics and all these kind of doing better than it did it after the crash in the nine.

607
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,374
Rym: But that's not saying much.

608
00:41:53,394 --> 00:41:56,003
Scott: Yeah, but it's not like some super mega bucks thing.

609
00:41:56,063 --> 00:41:57,890
Scott: It's just doing what it's always been doing.

610
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,840
Rym: So, uh, how do you make a good webcomic?

611
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,188
Rym: What do you look for in one a penny arcade?

612
00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:05,056
Scott: Okay How do you make a good webcomic?

613
00:42:05,237 --> 00:42:06,845
Rym: I think it there's.

614
00:42:06,865 --> 00:42:07,850
Scott: no it's really easy.

615
00:42:07,951 --> 00:42:09,290
Rym: All you have curious if you'll say the same thing.

616
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,277
Scott: I say all right you use.

617
00:42:11,357 --> 00:42:14,950
Scott: you need to have some sort of artistic talent or find someone with artistic talent, right?

618
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:21,910
Scott: But it doesn't matter if your talent level is low as long as your potential is high and You know, you need to find someone with some writing talent.

619
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:35,553
Scott: But it doesn't matter if it's currently low as long as has a high potential and then you just need to keep making Webcomics keep making them don't stop and whatever you do improve yourself in art and writing in Every comic.

620
00:42:35,593 --> 00:42:40,510
Scott: as long as you constantly improve you will eventually have a great comic case in point.

621
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:42,419
Rym: Look at the first year of penny arcade.

622
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:44,950
Scott: look it go by go to the store and look at the penny arcade books.

623
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:47,277
Scott: Look at the first one and look at the current one.

624
00:42:47,538 --> 00:42:48,340
Scott: They improved.

625
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,844
Scott: That's why they're gods now.

626
00:42:49,905 --> 00:42:54,419
Rym: Look at something else like You're trying not to name a certain comic.

627
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:56,225
Rym: I know which one you're thinking of.

628
00:42:56,265 --> 00:42:58,835
Rym: All right, fine mega Tokyo, okay That's not the one I was thinking.

629
00:42:58,895 --> 00:43:02,270
Scott: it's improved some but largely it's unchanged.

630
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:06,765
Scott: The writing is just as bad as it's always been and the art really hasn't improved.

631
00:43:06,805 --> 00:43:16,268
Rym: that means if you know what mega Tokyo started going and I thought a really good direction and then it I'm not sure where it went in the last couple weeks Yeah, I got any other ones that haven't improved at all.

632
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:21,330
Scott: What about that one you read like CR college roomies from hell one that looks the same now as it always did.

633
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:24,122
Rym: No, he actually looks super better compared to how it does it.

634
00:43:24,404 --> 00:43:27,296
Rym: you own the first I don't know year of that.

635
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:29,425
Scott: Bob and George never got never improved.

636
00:43:29,465 --> 00:43:30,630
Rym: Bob and George was never good.

637
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:31,434
Scott: Well, he was it was.

638
00:43:31,474 --> 00:43:35,914
Scott: no it was when they made Joe about flash man and quick man And wood man.

639
00:43:35,954 --> 00:43:36,697
Scott: then it was downhill.

640
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:37,158
Scott: guy there.

641
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,105
Rym: those are the three examples you always give.

642
00:43:39,165 --> 00:43:44,579
Scott: did they ever make a fourth joke Flashman quick man wood man eat man.

643
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,066
Rym: Did they ever make a fifth Joe airman?

644
00:43:47,287 --> 00:43:48,230
Scott: No, they didn't know.

645
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:50,604
Scott: Snake man, that was dumb.

646
00:43:50,765 --> 00:43:53,895
Scott: No see Beginning of the comic.

647
00:43:53,915 --> 00:43:54,939
Scott: it was all downhill from there.

648
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,144
Scott: Luckily the comics over now.

649
00:43:56,586 --> 00:43:57,550
Rym: Oh god, that was a bad guy.

650
00:43:57,912 --> 00:44:06,400
Rym: but in terms of specifics, I think a Lot of people approach the webcomic world I think in the wrong way and that You can't.

651
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,209
Rym: you can tell a serious story You can do a comedy you can do whatever you want.

652
00:44:09,551 --> 00:44:17,369
Rym: But the thing with a webcomic is that whatever your update schedule is one It has to update consistently or people won't read it to.

653
00:44:18,152 --> 00:44:24,848
Rym: When you put something up whatever unit you update in whether it's a page of volume a panel.

654
00:44:24,868 --> 00:44:29,110
Rym: It doesn't matter That in and of itself has to be enjoyable.

655
00:44:29,473 --> 00:44:38,030
Rym: I mean you can't have like just The Wednesday comic this week doesn't go anywhere because it's just set up for the Friday comic.

656
00:44:38,331 --> 00:44:39,395
Rym: That'll kill a webcomic.

657
00:44:39,836 --> 00:44:45,355
Rym: every single one while it can tell it can take you a story and while it can be consistent Has to have something.

658
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:53,646
Rym: one thing that happens like one unit of progression one unit of enjoyment Something that makes it stand at least somewhat on its own.

659
00:44:53,686 --> 00:44:59,290
Scott: if you want to learn How to do that very well look at order the stick because he knows when all that is like the best web.

660
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:04,606
Scott: He knows when he doesn't have enough in his single page to really do anything on its own.

661
00:45:04,626 --> 00:45:11,646
Scott: and he'll do these multi-page Releases so that every update has stands on its own as something enjoyable.

662
00:45:11,766 --> 00:45:21,454
Rym: like look every order of the stick Advances the plot a little bit has a joke at like one main joke probably a side joke and some foreshadowing Almost every single one.

663
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:22,617
Scott: It's a great comic.

664
00:45:22,898 --> 00:45:24,883
Rym: Oh, it's definitely one of the top two.

665
00:45:25,324 --> 00:45:27,530
Scott: Okay, will Naruto ever die?

666
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:27,933
Scott: I don't know.

667
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:28,824
Scott: I don't watch the show.

668
00:45:28,864 --> 00:45:29,370
Scott: I don't read the model.

669
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:32,960
Scott: I know if the character will not die permanently ever.

670
00:45:33,381 --> 00:45:38,640
Rym: I'm certain of that at best and I don't think this will happen They would kill him at the end to save everyone.

671
00:45:38,661 --> 00:45:40,509
Rym: He'd probably kill himself, but that's beside the point.

672
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:50,450
Rym: The show Naruto the idea of Naruto the reruns of Naruto the Phantom of Naruto Much like old generals and much like Dragon Ball will never die.

673
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:54,770
Rym: It will just fade away and then always exist at this baseline level forever.

674
00:45:55,694 --> 00:45:56,948
Rym: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

675
00:45:57,993 --> 00:46:03,410
Rym: All right, if you could ask Alan Moore one question, what would it be?

676
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,820
Scott: I don't really have a question for Alan Moore.

677
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:10,330
Scott: That's like, you know, I'm dying to ask him So I'll probably just ask him like hey, why are you so crazy?

678
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:12,978
Rym: Down a bit who's your barber?

679
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:15,348
Scott: Yeah, who's not your barber?

680
00:46:15,368 --> 00:46:22,463
Rym: All right I know what I'd ask the next one because they listed a bunch of people Kazuo Koike and my question would be are you for serious?

681
00:46:22,965 --> 00:46:24,430
Rym: Yeah, you just are you just playing?

682
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:26,749
Scott: Cuz something like that.

683
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:36,050
Rym: I really don't know if the things he like some of the things he did Like if he knew how crazy and I ran stupid they were well not stupid, but you know just weird and scary.

684
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:43,493
Rym: But I wonder if he understood what he was making when he made it or if he was just crazy Stanley.

685
00:46:43,574 --> 00:46:45,510
Rym: actually, I gotta answer this.

686
00:46:45,773 --> 00:46:49,200
Scott: I know what you're gonna answer how I say the same thing But we saw actually at the New York comic-con.

687
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,810
Scott: We saw him from like a hundred we did.

688
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:56,055
Scott: He was surrounded by this throng of courtiers Yeah, and I was just like hey I think that's Stanley.

689
00:46:56,075 --> 00:46:56,518
Scott: and it was.

690
00:46:56,538 --> 00:46:59,092
Scott: and then he hobbled away like an old man Which is what he is.

691
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:04,770
Rym: and my question for you Stanley what the fuck was up with you bolding random words?

692
00:47:05,011 --> 00:47:10,027
Rym: It's not like you bolded words that should have been in because you've bolded random words just randomly.

693
00:47:10,268 --> 00:47:10,950
Scott: what the fuck.

694
00:47:11,512 --> 00:47:16,170
Scott: I would actually you know sort of have a bigger question that includes the random bowling.

695
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:17,735
Rym: Oh, there's the other question with me.

696
00:47:17,996 --> 00:47:19,060
Rym: Why did you use words?

697
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,943
Rym: You didn't understand?

698
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,889
Scott: Well, I basically asked him in general You know, do you looking back now?

699
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:29,910
Scott: Do you honestly think that that you know, your writing was high quality or do you think it was you know terrible?

700
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,669
Rym: He would say yes it was.

701
00:47:32,513 --> 00:47:36,540
Scott: Yeah, all right Osamu Tezuka, uh, I don't even know what to ask.

702
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:37,102
Scott: I couldn't.

703
00:47:37,243 --> 00:47:39,190
Rym: I wouldn't feel okay asking him.

704
00:47:39,852 --> 00:47:44,415
Rym: I'd ask him out for a drink because I think he's one of the He's.

705
00:47:44,435 --> 00:47:46,689
Rym: I have so much respect for the late Osamu Tezuka.

706
00:47:46,891 --> 00:47:50,469
Rym: I mean, I just finished Apollo's song a little while ago and god damn.

707
00:47:51,153 --> 00:48:02,436
Rym: Also as an aside, I just would like to say that I know a lot of you are listening now Probably also listen to anime world order and they recently reviewed Apollo's song and I'm not gonna you know rip into them or anything But you're

708
00:48:02,456 --> 00:48:04,370
Scott: gonna wait until we review Apollo's song to do that.

709
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:08,350
Rym: What I would like to say is that I don't think they got it at all.

710
00:48:08,912 --> 00:48:14,650
Rym: And I just I really don't think they got it and as a result, I think their review really didn't do that comic justice.

711
00:48:15,313 --> 00:48:21,380
Scott: Well, I would basically as Tezuka, you know greedily like hey What was gonna be happening in the rest of Phoenix?

712
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:22,425
Scott: because he didn't finish it.

713
00:48:22,445 --> 00:48:33,450
Rym: I Just finished reading what was created and uh, yeah, actually I'd ask him if I'm right about Apollo's song Though I'm pretty sure I am because yeah, I don't want to spoil that comic.

714
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,718
Scott: Why isn't Tezuka more popular in the USA?

715
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:41,330
Rym: one Americans by and large don't like comics like any kind of comic.

716
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:56,869
Rym: I mean manga is popular but it's not like the average Joe reads manga and comics and like So less popular than and Tezuka being black and white and being so different looking than even anime, you know Manga style comics also.

717
00:48:57,251 --> 00:48:58,554
Rym: Tezuka is really disarming.

718
00:48:58,574 --> 00:49:08,838
Rym: you read Tezuka like Oh to carry hedo or Apollo's song or Phoenix and it looks goonian light-hearted But and there's jokes like every third panel But it was kind of random and bleh.

719
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:14,105
Rym: those comics hit on issues Really hard that make a lot of people especially in the u.s.

720
00:49:14,346 --> 00:49:15,170
Rym: Really uncomfortable.

721
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:19,305
Scott: And I think the biggest thing is that really the it's sort of inaccessible.

722
00:49:19,345 --> 00:49:20,690
Scott: I mean most of his stuff.

723
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,438
Scott: I mean he's got Phoenix's published by Viz.

724
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:28,050
Scott: he's got a few things published by Dark Horse Which are kind of hard to get and the rest is published by vertical ink.

725
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,119
Scott: These are not easy things to get at.

726
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:32,710
Scott: these are not things that are marketed widely or advertised.

727
00:49:33,134 --> 00:49:34,990
Scott: Most people in the country don't even know who Tezuka is.

728
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:39,654
Scott: I think if people knew who Tezuka was and they were like, you know They they hyped him up.

729
00:49:39,794 --> 00:49:44,150
Scott: as you know with again a PR campaign like Tezuka is as good as Walt Disney.

730
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,142
Scott: Oh my god, his stuff is amazing.

731
00:49:46,202 --> 00:49:47,450
Scott: It's so crazily popular.

732
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:53,430
Scott: We're putting it everywhere and if you give people the impression that it is already popular then it will become pop, you know It's funny.

733
00:49:53,530 --> 00:50:07,530
Rym: I was gonna interrupt you but I didn't because I had to sniff and I would have said the exact same thing if there was just a marketing campaign of Osamu Tezuka the Japanese Walt Disney the greatest comic author ever and they just pumped it.

734
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:08,874
Rym: Yeah, does it do greatly?

735
00:50:09,095 --> 00:50:10,219
Scott: Also, they're gonna.

736
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:13,490
Scott: they're starting to colorize all of Tezuka's manga that the Tezuka.

737
00:50:13,812 --> 00:50:20,548
Scott: Actually, I I'm kind of really looking forward to How much it's gonna cost when it comes out here, but maybe that'll help a little bit.

738
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:21,412
Scott: I don't know I don't know.

739
00:50:21,995 --> 00:50:23,481
Scott: All right crossover question.

740
00:50:23,602 --> 00:50:25,570
Rym: Oh, I can read this one cuz it's long.

741
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:31,518
Rym: Okay, you've expressed distaste for underwear pervert comics But what do you think of underwear pervert video games?

742
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,130
Rym: Did they suffer the same stigma as licensed branded movie video games?

743
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,394
Rym: Have you paid?

744
00:50:36,414 --> 00:50:41,470
Rym: I guess he means played any of the Marvel titles like X-men legends or Marvel?

745
00:50:42,612 --> 00:50:44,682
Rym: Let me answer I want to answer to but you can do it.

746
00:50:44,702 --> 00:50:45,647
Rym: All right, you can go.

747
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:50,930
Scott: Okay, so There there's nothing inherently good or bad about an underwear pervert video game.

748
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,777
Scott: I mean you make a good spider-man video game.

749
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:54,423
Scott: you sadly almost no one did.

750
00:50:54,603 --> 00:50:56,731
Scott: you can make a bad spider-man video game like the Attar.

751
00:50:56,771 --> 00:50:59,784
Rym: actually, I think the Atari 2600 is one of the better spider-man.

752
00:50:59,804 --> 00:51:03,670
Scott: the Sega Genesis one We have to take pictures of the bosses is actually a really good.

753
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:05,335
Rym: That's coming from me.

754
00:51:05,415 --> 00:51:06,661
Rym: I hated the Sega, but you know what?

755
00:51:06,702 --> 00:51:08,290
Rym: That was a damn good spider-man game.

756
00:51:08,872 --> 00:51:10,399
Scott: X-men arcade good game.

757
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:13,150
Rym: the walk across the side smashing things won.

758
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:16,381
Rym: Yeah, Captain America nothing moves the blob except Cyclops.

759
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:23,570
Rym: the Captain America arcade game also quite good But uh that x-men legends game that that game was crap.

760
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:26,340
Scott: It's just gauntlet our world of Warcraft.

761
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,886
Rym: one of our friends hyped it up like man.

762
00:51:27,906 --> 00:51:28,688
Rym: This game is awesome.

763
00:51:28,729 --> 00:51:32,690
Rym: Check it out Oh my god, and we finally played it and I was like, it's just gauntlet.

764
00:51:33,394 --> 00:51:35,830
Rym: It's better than gauntlet at being gauntlet.

765
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:38,830
Rym: But that's like saying world of Warcraft is better than the realm.

766
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,258
Rym: Yeah in world over here play gauntlet.

767
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:50,250
Scott: if you like gauntlet and you like the the under x-men Then you'll like x-men legends cuz it's just gauntlet with x-men instead of green wizard and red warrior.

768
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:54,627
Rym: I think the worst thing is that the game has this leveling mechanic that was kind of cool.

769
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:55,811
Rym: grind aside Like.

770
00:51:55,891 --> 00:52:01,086
Rym: it was really cool except half the powers didn't do Jack and it just wasn't fun.

771
00:52:01,547 --> 00:52:02,510
Scott: and it also didn't matter.

772
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:03,717
Scott: It's like you get skill points.

773
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:07,799
Scott: It doesn't matter what you put the skill points in You just you can automatically spend them.

774
00:52:07,819 --> 00:52:08,603
Scott: You'll do just fine.

775
00:52:08,643 --> 00:52:09,306
Scott: You can't lose.

776
00:52:09,548 --> 00:52:11,276
Scott: It's gauntlet Alright.

777
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,490
Rym: Yeah, you really can't lose it.

778
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:17,970
Scott: Nothing inherently good or bad about a game that uses an underwear pervert license to try to sell itself.

779
00:52:18,412 --> 00:52:23,293
Scott: The thing is is that you know, you can make a good game and you can make a bad game Whatever.

780
00:52:23,313 --> 00:52:26,010
Scott: Okay, would you guys be okay?

781
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:29,970
Scott: If someone would continue the Phoenix story from the two pages the testicle left before he died?

782
00:52:30,151 --> 00:52:31,114
Scott: Probably not.

783
00:52:31,335 --> 00:52:41,889
Rym: I say yeah, you know why that sort of thing happens all the time and While it's effectively a glorified fanfic at the same time if someone's a good writer and they

784
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:46,170
Scott: well I guess I guess anyone's allowed to try it go go nuts, you know, do whatever you want.

785
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:55,533
Scott: But I think the odds of someone doing it well enough to the point where I would respect it and consider it to be the actual continuation of Phoenix Nothing.

786
00:52:55,633 --> 00:53:04,743
Rym: I would consider that to be a work in and of itself kind of a. they took this core story and Everything that they knew about it and they just wrote something based on it.

787
00:53:05,205 --> 00:53:06,470
Rym: I think it's like an adaptation.

788
00:53:06,591 --> 00:53:08,078
Scott: Yeah, let anyone try go nuts.

789
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,305
Scott: You're free to do so.

790
00:53:09,325 --> 00:53:10,350
Scott: All right expression.

791
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:15,049
Rym: But what would it take to get anime quote mainstream unquote recognition in the

792
00:53:15,129 --> 00:53:15,370
Rym: u.s.?

793
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,356
Rym: Why hasn't this been done yet real?

794
00:53:17,396 --> 00:53:22,334
Rym: simply it wouldn't take much and the American anime industry is run by morons And they all that.

795
00:53:22,354 --> 00:53:27,855
Scott: the other problem is that they have to take a big risk and spend a lot of money on Marketing in PR.

796
00:53:27,995 --> 00:53:28,356
Scott: They're not.

797
00:53:28,436 --> 00:53:33,233
Rym: I mean they take risks on stupid things, but they don't take and also they're so secret It.

798
00:53:33,395 --> 00:53:34,610
Rym: uh, yeah, we talked about that a lot.

799
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:38,122
Rym: Okay, I'll ask this one because I we both have a lot to say about this one.

800
00:53:38,202 --> 00:53:40,430
Rym: Why do DVDs cost so freaking much in?

801
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:44,640
Scott: Japan People in Japan are dumb and they're willing to pay a lot for DVDs.

802
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:49,270
Rym: I think the Japanese anime industry Well, really just media in Japan.

803
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:56,641
Rym: They kind of for a long time took advantage of the Japanese people and I don't know if it I mean I think there's a lot of reasons.

804
00:53:56,701 --> 00:54:04,117
Rym: but it ended up that They price things very high and people were willing to pay it and as a result The prices stayed really high.

805
00:54:04,499 --> 00:54:08,415
Rym: and then Japan tried to sell stuff in the US and the US said $40 for a DVD.

806
00:54:13,532 --> 00:54:17,350
Rym: So Japan started selling, you know, they'd license it so that DVDs would be cheap in America.

807
00:54:18,036 --> 00:54:22,318
Rym: but then Japanese people started Re-importing because they're like how come that DVDs?

808
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:26,270
Rym: 20 American dollars in America and 80 American dollars here?

809
00:54:26,932 --> 00:54:33,935
Rym: Yeah, so as a result, they don't license stuff to America right away, which hurts the American industry Which makes the licenses worth.

810
00:54:33,995 --> 00:54:35,359
Rym: it's like this cycle of crap.

811
00:54:35,781 --> 00:54:44,950
Scott: Another thing is that in America you realize, you know DVDs sell a lot maybe because they have lower prices, but also I guess because Americans watch a lot of things.

812
00:54:45,112 --> 00:54:53,950
Rym: I think the total output of Shows that are then put on DVD in America is a lot higher than Japan total just because there's a lot more TV in America.

813
00:54:54,191 --> 00:55:05,104
Scott: I also I get the feeling also that you know The anime is on TV in Japan and I get the feeling that most people just watch it on TV and that only Sort of otaku were likely to buy it on DVD.

814
00:55:05,164 --> 00:55:14,330
Scott: Yeah a lot of the time A lot less people purchasing so and they're they're crazy fans and crazy fans are willing to pay more because they're crazed fans.

815
00:55:14,551 --> 00:55:25,310
Scott: Yeah, the kind of people who are gonna buy Bandai visual DVDs in the u.s So When are you going to do final thoughts episodes when I rewatch anime series?

816
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:31,030
Rym: Actually, we're going to do one either next week or the week after because there is one show if we don't do it.

817
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:39,641
Rym: Oh, no there is one show that we both remember enough to give our full final thoughts on and Scott just has to watch Ava again and eska flown a again.

818
00:55:39,662 --> 00:55:43,693
Scott: And I'll tell you what as soon as I finish Phantom hourglass.

819
00:55:44,155 --> 00:55:46,184
Scott: I'll start watching Evangelion on the train.

820
00:55:46,546 --> 00:55:48,377
Rym: Ah, see at the same time I was kind of waiting.

821
00:55:48,437 --> 00:55:52,048
Rym: cuz I kind of want to watch it again, too And we have a couple friends who have never seen it.

822
00:55:52,511 --> 00:55:55,425
Rym: Oh, but at the same time, what are we gonna get together in marathon anime?

823
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:56,330
Rym: We don't have time for that.

824
00:55:56,531 --> 00:55:57,274
Scott: No, it's not gonna happen.

825
00:55:57,615 --> 00:55:58,218
Rym: But yeah, I'm not.

826
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:00,367
Rym: should I say the title we're gonna do final thoughts on.

827
00:56:00,387 --> 00:56:01,030
Scott: it's up to you.

828
00:56:01,413 --> 00:56:02,018
Rym: I think I should.

829
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:10,710
Rym: just if you're listening We're very likely going to do a final thoughts on Trigon All right in the near future because I think a light kind of like Apollo song.

830
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:12,697
Rym: I think a lot of people misinterpret what it was saying.

831
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:13,219
Rym: Okay.

832
00:56:14,002 --> 00:56:16,110
Scott: Do you think that nonfiction graphic novels?

833
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:23,250
Scott: Eg also a correct use of again the 9/11 report a graphic adaptation will ever be a major force in the American comic book market.

834
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:25,396
Rym: You know, I don't know.

835
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:25,997
Rym: I don't.

836
00:56:26,098 --> 00:56:30,570
Rym: I think if comics became more mainstream than things like that would become equally mainstream.

837
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:31,798
Scott: Yeah, I guess you know.

838
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:40,009
Scott: there there's another graphic non-fiction graphic novel the plot by will Eisner which is sort of the the true history of the.

839
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:42,615
Scott: What's the stupid conspiracy?

840
00:56:42,695 --> 00:56:44,981
Scott: Jew book the brother the elders is ion?

841
00:56:45,021 --> 00:56:45,863
Scott: Yeah, ever book.

842
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,129
Scott: Yeah, I have that and it's pretty good.

843
00:56:49,452 --> 00:57:07,879
Scott: Yes, there just really aren't that many Non-fiction graphic novels out there and I think if someone you know came out with one with good timing, you know They hit on an issue that was like, you know Very big at the time and they did a very good job of it and they market it properly that they could you know Really make a big hit.

844
00:57:07,919 --> 00:57:09,230
Scott: there is definitely a potential there.

845
00:57:10,312 --> 00:57:11,918
Scott: Have I seen any examples?

846
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:13,684
Scott: No, I haven't really seen anything.

847
00:57:13,704 --> 00:57:15,370
Scott: that's that you know is gonna make it happen.

848
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:17,864
Scott: I don't think this 9/11 report graphic adaptation did that?

849
00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:18,810
Scott: Well, I never heard of it before.

850
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:21,020
Rym: I've heard of it because it was all over FARC.

851
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:23,250
Rym: Okay, but along the same lines.

852
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:26,790
Rym: Uh, how common are nonfiction manga in the Asian comic book market?

853
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:30,502
Rym: I vaguely recall you guys mentioning something about a manga history of ramen.

854
00:57:30,702 --> 00:57:35,662
Scott: I think they are more common than nonfiction I think is in the American comics.

855
00:57:35,682 --> 00:57:40,803
Rym: broader answer is just that Manga isn't like this special thing in Japan.

856
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:45,650
Scott: It's just another medium Yeah, and there's nonfiction in it as well as fiction.

857
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:55,550
Scott: I mean, I already already know they have like business manga which tells stories about businesses and I imagine is Historical manga which tell like, you know stories from history pretty accurately.

858
00:57:55,711 --> 00:58:00,690
Scott: I you know, I'm sure they had lots of drama to really get people going on it and stuff.

859
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:02,257
Scott: But I'm sure it exists.

860
00:58:02,297 --> 00:58:03,161
Scott: everything else exists.

861
00:58:03,282 --> 00:58:05,110
Scott: Why wouldn't you know nonfiction exists?

862
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:08,199
Scott: Okay, so this one is actually a Thunderdome.

863
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:09,463
Scott: we should do another Thunderdome episode.

864
00:58:09,523 --> 00:58:11,370
Rym: Oh, so you're skipping those other two questions.

865
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:15,234
Scott: Okay Now everyone's thinking.

866
00:58:15,274 --> 00:58:15,616
Rym: Oh, man.

867
00:58:15,656 --> 00:58:15,957
Rym: I want that.

868
00:58:15,997 --> 00:58:16,901
Scott: Yeah, I'm skipping them.

869
00:58:17,524 --> 00:58:18,307
Rym: Yeah, they're kind of crap.

870
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:19,030
Rym: Not that I look at him.

871
00:58:19,231 --> 00:58:20,178
Rym: Okay, I'll answer.

872
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,226
Rym: I'll do this one real quick.

873
00:58:21,468 --> 00:58:25,650
Rym: All right What's the most you've ever paid for a comic anime manga and the biggest steel deal ever scored?

874
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:28,804
Rym: We bought all of master Keaton for like freaking nothing.

875
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,050
Scott: Yeah, that was pretty damn cheap.

876
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,335
Rym: That was so worth it.

877
00:58:31,877 --> 00:58:34,126
Rym: And the most was just in the early days.

878
00:58:34,568 --> 00:58:42,070
Rym: I paid like Some stupid amount of money for the VHS box set of the original Tenchi Muyo OAVs.

879
00:58:42,451 --> 00:58:45,038
Rym: It was like thirty five forty dollars of VHS.

880
00:58:45,138 --> 00:58:48,026
Scott: I think for all six volumes of Akira.

881
00:58:48,106 --> 00:58:59,859
Scott: I paid full retail price For anime, I bought all the gassaraki on dubbed VHS and for a single comic I never really five bucks.

882
00:58:59,919 --> 00:59:04,535
Scott: I paid for like x-men number one, I guess but I Don't know.

883
00:59:04,839 --> 00:59:12,370
Scott: I guess I spent Like 30 bucks to get like a hardcover, you know, like come in a book like a graphic novel.

884
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:15,145
Scott: But I you know, I guess those big red stars the volumes.

885
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:20,690
Rym: I paid a lot for those I guess one I could say if you talk most expensive in terms of dollars spent per unit quality.

886
00:59:22,055 --> 00:59:40,870
Rym: I forget what it was called but there's a picture of it in a picture I got from my mom of my bedroom when I was younger and It's a comic I think it was by Margaret Weiss and it was something about dragons, so, of course I bought it and Effectively I paid infinity for it because there was zero content worthwhile in it and I paid some amount of money.

887
00:59:41,731 --> 00:59:43,123
Rym: Good God was that horrible.

888
00:59:43,183 --> 00:59:48,190
Rym: and I even like Lied to myself and said I liked it because I didn't want to admit that I'd spent that money.

889
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,818
Scott: All right, the other question that we skipped.

890
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,707
Scott: I'm just gonna ignore cuz it's so generic.

891
00:59:51,827 --> 00:59:52,637
Rym: Oh it is All right.

892
00:59:52,863 --> 00:59:53,150
Scott: All right.

893
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:55,130
Scott: So back to the Thunderdome gonna read the whole thing.

894
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:56,857
Scott: Who would win in a battle?

895
00:59:56,918 --> 00:59:59,750
Scott: spike Spiegel and the swordfish or a starbuck in the Viper?

896
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:08,387
Rym: I don't know who starbuck star is is a character from Battlestar Galactica Who in the modern Battlestar Galactica is a woman, but it doesn't matter.

897
01:00:08,427 --> 01:00:09,090
Rym: I think it's kind of cool.

898
01:00:09,151 --> 01:00:17,290
Rym: They did that but in both Starbuck is a badass one of the best fighter in space pilots in the known human world.

899
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:18,755
Scott: What kind of weapons does that thing have?

900
01:00:18,996 --> 01:00:22,910
Rym: actually the Viper is fairly equivalent to the swordfish really?

901
01:00:23,713 --> 01:00:27,720
Scott: Doesn't really have that many weapons other than the big Of it and which is kind of unwieldy.

902
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,906
Scott: It's not really a gunship.

903
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:35,390
Rym: So let me put it this way So she's flying and she's lying in the equivalent of an a-wing with extra weapons.

904
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:36,253
Rym: That's a x-wing.

905
01:00:36,614 --> 01:00:41,510
Scott: an x-wing Oh x-wing frickin wedge antilles could own spike in an x-wing.

906
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:46,488
Scott: I mean spike is a good pilot, but the swordfish really isn't that powerful as as a fighter.

907
01:00:47,151 --> 01:00:55,270
Scott: It's it's you know, it has fighter abilities and it shoots its laser But it that's really all it has and an x-wing which is actually a military vehicle.

908
01:00:55,591 --> 01:00:59,348
Scott: He'd be owned he'd be toast but at the same time you take him out.

909
01:00:59,408 --> 01:01:04,850
Rym: my answer I think is much more clever and I hope everyone agrees All right So and I'm not gonna ruin cowboy bebop.

910
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:05,352
Rym: But it is.

911
01:01:05,513 --> 01:01:11,549
Rym: they kind of make reference to this in the first episode and they bring it up a lot and the movie Brings it up like super.

912
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:21,139
Rym: but spike Spiegel the only way he could possibly die is in a very specific situation because Spike Spiegel doesn't say he has to die.

913
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:21,942
Scott: He just loses.

914
01:01:22,002 --> 01:01:23,166
Rym: He can't win a battle.

915
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:24,110
Rym: He cannot lose.

916
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:25,577
Rym: I am up cuz it's a space battle.

917
01:01:25,617 --> 01:01:28,110
Rym: You can't lose a battle like that and not die.

918
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:28,813
Scott: He can.

919
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,281
Scott: now your ship is damaged.

920
01:01:30,301 --> 01:01:31,105
Scott: You're floating in space.

921
01:01:31,125 --> 01:01:32,010
Scott: Then someone picks you up and goes.

922
01:01:32,633 --> 01:01:33,456
Rym: I don't think that could happen.

923
01:01:33,496 --> 01:01:34,882
Scott: I think I'm gonna gun them all the time.

924
01:01:35,143 --> 01:01:36,950
Rym: Well Gundam is different in the real world.

925
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:40,025
Rym: I'm pretty sure your cabin would depress your eyes and you die immediately.

926
01:01:40,065 --> 01:01:41,050
Scott: Well, you're wearing a spacesuit.

927
01:01:41,753 --> 01:01:43,502
Rym: How does spike wear a spacesuit when he's in his?

928
01:01:43,682 --> 01:01:45,210
Rym: uh swordfish sometimes?

929
01:01:46,152 --> 01:01:47,929
Rym: Does he think back sometimes?

930
01:01:49,031 --> 01:01:50,316
Scott: He's puts on a space suit a few times.

931
01:01:50,356 --> 01:01:50,617
Scott: All right.

932
01:01:50,918 --> 01:01:54,010
Rym: Yeah, I just don't think spike could lose because of various plot.

933
01:01:54,151 --> 01:01:56,802
Rym: I think that spike would just win due to some crazy thing.

934
01:01:57,163 --> 01:01:59,176
Rym: Starbuck would just go insane or something I don't know.

935
01:01:59,237 --> 01:02:02,357
Scott: Here's an easy question What are the good and bad parts of Naruto?

936
01:02:02,397 --> 01:02:03,982
Rym: good parts funny ninja school.

937
01:02:04,162 --> 01:02:07,356
Scott: funny ninja school and the characters are really awesome At least most of them.

938
01:02:07,537 --> 01:02:08,889
Scott: bad parts everything else.

939
01:02:09,394 --> 01:02:16,870
Scott: Seriously, all right What point in your lives did you go from OMG all cartoons from Japan are awesome to anime jadedness?

940
01:02:17,272 --> 01:02:20,070
Rym: Well, it's you know, people say oh you're jaded about anime.

941
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:27,407
Rym: It's more than when I first found out about Japan cartoons, you know Japanimation anime on the sci-fi channel.

942
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:27,648
Rym: Yep.

943
01:02:27,689 --> 01:02:33,190
Rym: Me too It was different and that alone made it amazing because it wasn't like things I'd seen.

944
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:33,872
Scott: Yeah, I mean I was.

945
01:02:33,892 --> 01:02:35,398
Scott: it's all relative you see.

946
01:02:35,478 --> 01:02:42,162
Scott: so when I was watching even though some of the things I watched were amazing Like say galaxy express 3 9 on sci-fi channel.

947
01:02:42,744 --> 01:02:58,762
Scott: I was also watching Like fatal fury on the sci-fi channel and it was relative to what I had already Experienced in my life and at that point in my life the things that I had experienced in terms of animation We're not nearly even close to being as amazing as fatal fury even so.

948
01:02:59,163 --> 01:03:01,570
Scott: that's why everything was so awesome to me early on.

949
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:15,990
Scott: But as I watched more and more anime and more and more amazing anime like the works of Satoshi khan Otomo and Miyazaki and reading manga of Tezuka They you can start to see when things are not so amazing because you've seen something even better than that.

950
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,816
Scott: And that's when you start getting jaded.

951
01:03:18,076 --> 01:03:22,390
Rym: It's kind of like once you ride the Millennium Force the super bad rollercoaster.

952
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:22,812
Scott: Yeah, it's like you.

953
01:03:22,852 --> 01:03:27,494
Rym: if you're not gonna have fun on the blue streak anymore because it just it pales by comparison Exactly.

954
01:03:27,534 --> 01:03:28,661
Scott: You go to the amusement park.

955
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:30,230
Scott: You've never ridden a roller coaster in your life.

956
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:32,910
Scott: You ride the hundred-foot Twinkie and it's awesome.

957
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:37,815
Scott: Then you ride the 200 foot and you go, holy shit, then you ride the hundred foot again you go man That's how it goes.

958
01:03:38,237 --> 01:03:40,670
Scott: so when I first watched anime it was it was the hundred footer.

959
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:43,282
Rym: All right Should we end on this one?

960
01:03:43,685 --> 01:03:44,430
Scott: pick whatever you want?

961
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:48,684
Rym: Cuz it we've gone about an hour as always right and this one's this one's aid.

962
01:03:48,744 --> 01:03:50,570
Rym: and what are your opinions on?

963
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:52,253
Rym: Otak in?

964
01:03:52,594 --> 01:03:54,480
Scott: what are Otak in our otaku kin?

965
01:03:54,641 --> 01:03:55,484
Scott: What are otaku kids?

966
01:03:55,504 --> 01:03:56,467
Rym: Oh, you didn't read that thread.

967
01:03:56,527 --> 01:03:57,812
Scott: No, I didn't All right.

968
01:03:57,872 --> 01:04:07,243
Rym: Well, uh, you know other kin theory entropes no People who think they're vampires or dragons or werewolves or anything like that.

969
01:04:07,384 --> 01:04:09,089
Scott: Yeah those scary people.

970
01:04:09,249 --> 01:04:14,281
Rym: well Otakin and this is a self-made term, but there seem to be a lot.

971
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:17,749
Rym: I read a few serious business writings from these people.

972
01:04:20,011 --> 01:04:26,830
Rym: They see manga or comics or sometimes it's something else and it's not like they identify with the character.

973
01:04:26,931 --> 01:04:30,330
Rym: It's not like they like see parallels to the character.

974
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:34,342
Rym: It's not like they feel a spiritual connection to like the story from the book.

975
01:04:35,145 --> 01:04:48,530
Rym: It's that they believe somehow That they are that character or that their soul is that character and that book existed just to show them or that book Was written by someone who was channeled into their past life.

976
01:04:49,811 --> 01:04:52,303
Scott: And they're not jobs with psychological problems.

977
01:04:52,624 --> 01:04:53,367
Scott: Go see a shrink.

978
01:04:53,407 --> 01:04:53,950
Scott: end of story.

979
01:04:54,050 --> 01:05:02,670
Rym: No, I think it's a much more interesting phenomenon because I don't think it's any different than all these other You know, but the theory entropes and the people are also not jobs.

980
01:05:02,794 --> 01:05:02,921
Scott: Well,

981
01:05:02,942 --> 01:05:23,969
Rym: no what I think it is is that a lot of people when they're young and they're going through puberty and just you know young becoming Adults becoming like adult sentient people they have feelings that they don't quite understand or explain and a lot of people attribute these to various Things but I think a lot of people attribute these to mystical experiences or to supernatural experiences or things along those lines.

982
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:36,310
Rym: and I think at that point when you're a very impressionable person and you have experiences like that Your experiences tend to be shaped by the things that you think about a lot or the things that are going on in your life.

983
01:05:37,114 --> 01:05:51,077
Rym: and I think this new phenomenon is coming out just because the primary audience of a lot of manga and comics these days are people who are in that time period and all these kind of subcultures are Psychologically almost identical.

984
01:05:51,157 --> 01:05:52,622
Rym: and I think it's just what you've come across.

985
01:05:52,903 --> 01:06:00,190
Scott: in my armchair psychologist kind of way I always viewed the people who think they're like You know a furry or they they sort of you know live in a fan.

986
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:00,874
Rym: Well, it's not.

987
01:06:00,974 --> 01:06:02,081
Rym: it's not hard to be a furry.

988
01:06:02,121 --> 01:06:03,147
Rym: You just have to like furry.

989
01:06:03,268 --> 01:06:10,730
Scott: I know People actually think like I am a sea otter, you know, and like they you know that that's really what gets them.

990
01:06:11,352 --> 01:06:18,992
Scott: I think that with those my armchair psychologist opinion is that those people have a very poor Self-image.

991
01:06:19,052 --> 01:06:24,247
Scott: So what they do is they replace the shitty self-image which in many cases is there's.

992
01:06:24,387 --> 01:06:25,490
Scott: they are a poor self-image.

993
01:06:25,651 --> 01:06:26,355
Scott: I look down on that.

994
01:06:26,476 --> 01:06:34,350
Scott: what they really are as well, you know, they're usually you know Kind of in people you don't want to hang around and they replace their own self-image with this.

995
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:34,932
Scott: You know.

996
01:06:35,073 --> 01:06:43,470
Scott: other image that they like say that their favorite character from you know Some anime and they say I'm not this shitty disgusting smelly stupid person that I am.

997
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:55,001
Scott: I'm actually that other person that I really like and they replace their horrible self-image with a better self-image and then they sort of get Self-esteem, but it's not self-esteem for themselves It's self-esteem for what they wish they were.

998
01:06:55,021 --> 01:06:56,290
Scott: and this is why it's a problem.

999
01:06:56,310 --> 01:07:00,790
Rym: You know, I would say that for I don't know I couldn't give a percentage but I maybe half of them.

1000
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:03,770
Rym: I think that that is probably a somewhat valid assessment.

1001
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:07,305
Rym: But I think what I said is I think that I say we're both not psychologists.

1002
01:07:07,325 --> 01:07:08,189
Scott: So this is just woo.

1003
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:09,353
Scott: Yeah, that's our guess.

1004
01:07:09,373 --> 01:07:13,830
Rym: This is what makes sense to us what I will say because that's my opinions and not my opinions.

1005
01:07:13,992 --> 01:07:15,144
Scott: Yeah, you have an opinion here.

1006
01:07:15,165 --> 01:07:15,650
Scott: I'm not a psycho.

1007
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:15,911
Scott: My

1008
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:42,890
Rym: opinion straight up is that it's it's almost more sad and I think I was talking to Emily about this and she brought this up a lot to that if someone's gonna have this kind of mystical experience or this like super like this thing in their life the spiritual idea and They base it on a Japanese comic they read as opposed to on something that just sprang from their creative consciousness It's like it's just like a one level down in terms of less sad.

1009
01:07:43,431 --> 01:07:44,214
Scott: Yeah, it.

1010
01:07:44,896 --> 01:07:51,759
Rym: I'd much rather someone believed something interesting that they made up than believe something That was just in a comic that some guy wrote to make money.

1011
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:52,401
Scott: Mmm.

1012
01:07:52,883 --> 01:07:59,862
Rym: I mean I Would ask to one of these people so, uh, I'm actually Superman from Superman.

1013
01:08:00,973 --> 01:08:04,123
Rym: And if they think that's stupid well mirrors and such.

1014
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:04,585
Scott: Yep.

1015
01:08:04,605 --> 01:08:06,130
Rym: All right, maybe we could do one or two more.

1016
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:09,570
Rym: I don't want a black maybe but my kettle is black.

1017
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,024
Scott: Do it do whatever you want go you wanna do another one.

1018
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:13,411
Scott: do whatever you want It's up to you.

1019
01:08:13,873 --> 01:08:18,169
Rym: Where do I get a good supply of one-shot Western comics along the lines of DMZ?

1020
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:21,707
Scott: Amazon calm or in stock trades calm.

1021
01:08:21,768 --> 01:08:26,729
Rym: next Why is it that the uglier the person the more sexual the cosplay costume they wear?

1022
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:28,638
Rym: That's not true at all.

1023
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,288
Rym: That's just what stands out.

1024
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:35,345
Scott: Yeah, I mean there are hot people wearing hot costumes ugly people wearing cover-up costumes.

1025
01:08:35,404 --> 01:08:36,950
Scott: is there's all sorts of stuff going on.

1026
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,310
Scott: It's a totally mixed up across the board.

1027
01:08:39,731 --> 01:08:50,129
Scott: It's just that when someone ugly or someone scary is wearing a particularly revealing and unattractive Costume it stands out like a little freaking don't know?

1028
01:08:51,013 --> 01:08:55,630
Rym: Don't forget that there's a large subculture of the ironically bad cosplay.

1029
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:59,066
Rym: You know a big fat guy who dresses like Sailor Moon, but that guy's cool.

1030
01:08:59,145 --> 01:09:00,915
Rym: Yeah, that's the thing It's you can't.

1031
01:09:01,457 --> 01:09:05,236
Rym: don't just because you see someone in it like a scary cosplay Don't judge him based on that.

1032
01:09:05,336 --> 01:09:05,477
Rym: now.

1033
01:09:05,899 --> 01:09:13,889
Rym: if they also smell and tell you about their D&D character Then yeah, but if if you see Sailor Bubba Sailor Bubba is an awesome, dude.

1034
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:20,649
Scott: Seriously, there's another question on here that has the same answer Which is why are the vast majority of cosplayers people that would never want to see naked?

1035
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:22,948
Scott: That's because those are the people that stand out like a sore thumb.

1036
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:28,250
Scott: You don't notice all the completely average looking cosplayers because they don't stand out very much.

1037
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,149
Scott: They're just mixing in with the herd.

1038
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:33,260
Scott: You only notice the really hot ones and the really ugly ones.

1039
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,627
Rym: now hot not isn't sexually attractive, but hot isn't.

1040
01:09:36,029 --> 01:09:36,310
Rym: damn.

1041
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:38,478
Rym: That's a good cosplay exactly all right.

1042
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:41,750
Rym: Let's end on this cuz I like this question all right as of today.

1043
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:42,193
Rym: What is your?

1044
01:09:42,273 --> 01:09:44,709
Scott: I like the one above it want to do both, okay?

1045
01:09:45,151 --> 01:09:47,323
Rym: All right, I'll ask this one, and then you do the other one.

1046
01:09:47,444 --> 01:09:52,029
Rym: okay as of today What is your favorite AMV and what makes it so?

1047
01:09:53,657 --> 01:10:00,170
Rym: I Have to say two because one is a hit me baby one more time set to utana.

1048
01:10:00,632 --> 01:10:02,782
Rym: It's not the Britney Spears cover.

1049
01:10:03,023 --> 01:10:04,410
Rym: well not really cover, but original.

1050
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:06,249
Rym: It's a cover by a rock band.

1051
01:10:07,132 --> 01:10:14,572
Rym: And I think that video aside from one comedic insertion is just amazing on levels that I really can't get into without Derailing the show.

1052
01:10:14,853 --> 01:10:20,610
Rym: it's technically excellent the concept is solid the song fits perfectly and it's funny.

1053
01:10:20,911 --> 01:10:24,325
Rym: But if you've seen the show it's also really serious and really meaningful.

1054
01:10:24,365 --> 01:10:25,409
Rym: It's just like the best AMV.

1055
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,817
Scott: I will pick the Mambo Leo.

1056
01:10:28,298 --> 01:10:32,190
Rym: the Mambo Leo is just one of those perfectly executed.

1057
01:10:32,692 --> 01:10:33,476
Rym: Pump you up.

1058
01:10:33,657 --> 01:10:34,501
Rym: so well done.

1059
01:10:34,541 --> 01:10:35,907
Rym: It's painful AMVs.

1060
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:40,281
Rym: Yep In fact that was the last thing the last AMV.

1061
01:10:40,341 --> 01:10:42,067
Rym: I ever showed at the RIT anime club.

1062
01:10:42,609 --> 01:10:43,674
Scott: all right Here's the question.

1063
01:10:43,694 --> 01:10:44,217
Scott: That's good.

1064
01:10:44,317 --> 01:10:44,820
Rym: I got.

1065
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:45,644
Rym: I got to say one more.

1066
01:10:46,046 --> 01:10:47,912
Rym: I got to jump in 25 25.

1067
01:10:47,912 --> 01:10:49,037
Scott: that's okay.

1068
01:10:49,177 --> 01:10:51,828
Rym: I think that is also one of the best anime music videos ever made.

1069
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:52,330
Rym: It's a good one.

1070
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:52,974
Scott: I think it's one of the best.

1071
01:10:53,175 --> 01:10:55,610
Scott: I think it is anyway all right.

1072
01:10:55,711 --> 01:10:58,069
Scott: Here's a question that I could actually take up a whole episode with.

1073
01:10:59,072 --> 01:11:03,709
Scott: If you could have any anime manga or video game mecha Which would you take now?

1074
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:11,530
Scott: This is a very difficult question because do not be deceived if you're gonna ask which is the strongest you could say Voltron.

1075
01:11:11,691 --> 01:11:14,401
Scott: But that might not be what I want with Voltron.

1076
01:11:14,461 --> 01:11:15,766
Scott: I need four other people.

1077
01:11:15,827 --> 01:11:16,690
Scott: what a pain in the ass.

1078
01:11:17,272 --> 01:11:23,895
Rym: Not only that, but you know it's relative because I would say that the only thing that could match Voltron would be I don't know the Ava.

1079
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,726
Scott: Yeah, so yeah in an Ava.

1080
01:11:25,746 --> 01:11:26,490
Scott: You don't want that either.

1081
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:27,879
Scott: That's not practical for everyone.

1082
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:29,690
Rym: use Ava's great, and I'd love an Ava.

1083
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,075
Rym: Here's my problem with an Ava.

1084
01:11:31,657 --> 01:11:35,109
Rym: that is not a world with Ava's is not a world you want to live in right.

1085
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:38,504
Scott: so We're assuming that we're gonna live in the current existing world.

1086
01:11:38,565 --> 01:11:42,057
Scott: only I'm gonna have this robot So you know or mecha of some sort.

1087
01:11:42,077 --> 01:11:46,449
Rym: so in that case oh, I almost said bokurano, but then I remembered right.

1088
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:52,050
Scott: so You want to pick something that's incredibly practical and would make your life better like a Gundam would be a good choice.

1089
01:11:52,453 --> 01:11:54,205
Scott: You know cuz a Gundam is very practical.

1090
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:54,950
Scott: for the normal world.

1091
01:11:55,030 --> 01:12:06,470
Scott: It's usually no power especially something like the Zeta Gundam right or or freedom Gundam You know which can fly into and out of outer space and it can power itself and maintain itself.

1092
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,081
Scott: You know I might a punk kid.

1093
01:12:08,121 --> 01:12:08,564
Scott: It's so easy.

1094
01:12:08,584 --> 01:12:09,370
Scott: a punk kid can fly.

1095
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:14,527
Rym: I might go with a guy my left from Escaflowne because they just run on my soul or whatever.

1096
01:12:14,627 --> 01:12:15,590
Rym: so they just work forever.

1097
01:12:16,531 --> 01:12:22,990
Scott: Anything that requires too many people is right out and anything that is you know sort of requires a power source.

1098
01:12:23,412 --> 01:12:25,182
Scott: It runs out of energy is sort of right out.

1099
01:12:25,202 --> 01:12:25,584
Rym: You know what?

1100
01:12:25,685 --> 01:12:26,630
Rym: there's an obvious answer.

1101
01:12:26,811 --> 01:12:28,500
Scott: No, I have the obvious answer.

1102
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,250
Scott: Oh no the big O is not so good.

1103
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:33,945
Scott: Yes, it is not sort of in your full control all the time exactly.

1104
01:12:33,965 --> 01:12:34,407
Scott: You know what.

1105
01:12:34,488 --> 01:12:35,050
Rym: it doesn't matter.

1106
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,647
Rym: It's so cool that I take it anyway.

1107
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:38,416
Scott: all right I have the perfect answer.

1108
01:12:38,536 --> 01:12:43,398
Scott: now the the first answer obviously is the most practical of all mecha Which is the Valkyrie from Macross.

1109
01:12:43,419 --> 01:12:45,530
Scott: you know it turns to do a plane perfectly.

1110
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:49,822
Scott: You know jet plane or a robot or the in-between right.

1111
01:12:49,903 --> 01:12:52,410
Scott: the problem is just it's just little old Valkyrie.

1112
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:53,355
Scott: It's not that powerful.

1113
01:12:53,395 --> 01:12:56,050
Scott: I mean f-16s or f-22s could come and take you out.

1114
01:12:56,150 --> 01:13:07,510
Scott: So you're not really king of the world which is why the obvious answer is the entire Sdf-1 Macross which comes with a whole fleet of Valkyries, so you have no problems there.

1115
01:13:08,631 --> 01:13:10,517
Rym: You complain about needing four people.

1116
01:13:10,557 --> 01:13:11,179
Rym: now you need like.

1117
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,784
Scott: there's the sdf-1 macross.

1118
01:13:12,864 --> 01:13:13,346
Scott: see that's.

1119
01:13:13,406 --> 01:13:18,690
Scott: if you want to fly it around in Space and stuff you need a whole crew and a whole fleet of people and everything right.

1120
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,523
Scott: But if you're just sitting on the ground it's gonna get full of dust.

1121
01:13:21,744 --> 01:13:22,990
Rym: you're not gonna mop that thing.

1122
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:24,416
Scott: You don't need to mop the thing.

1123
01:13:24,456 --> 01:13:25,400
Scott: It's self-repairing.

1124
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:26,605
Scott: It's self powering.

1125
01:13:26,685 --> 01:13:27,750
Rym: is it self mopping?

1126
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,456
Rym: Yes, where does it say that?

1127
01:13:29,576 --> 01:13:32,506
Scott: it's little robots that go around the ground and they clean it up.

1128
01:13:32,586 --> 01:13:33,630
Rym: and who maintains those?

1129
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:35,859
Scott: They maintain themselves.

1130
01:13:35,879 --> 01:13:38,370
Scott: oh, I'm sure it doesn't matter because you get power.

1131
01:13:38,511 --> 01:13:39,758
Scott: It does it itself.

1132
01:13:39,798 --> 01:13:40,602
Scott: does it has?

1133
01:13:40,643 --> 01:13:41,709
Scott: it has an power plant.

1134
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:45,626
Scott: It doesn't matter because I get a few of that just sitting on the ground.

1135
01:13:45,947 --> 01:13:48,050
Scott: on its own It's like a city just sitting there.

1136
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:48,974
Scott: It's like so lame.

1137
01:13:49,014 --> 01:13:49,978
Rym: you know what you just said.

1138
01:13:50,299 --> 01:13:54,489
Rym: if I could have any robot in the world it would be New York City But just me exactly.

1139
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:56,135
Rym: That's lame.

1140
01:13:56,155 --> 01:13:56,960
Scott: It's awesome.

1141
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,232
Scott: It's not as New York City with me Just me.

1142
01:13:59,372 --> 01:14:08,690
Scott: if New York City with just me in it and two aircraft carries full of f-22s that transform You know what then I'll take my big oh, and I'll punch your city up.

1143
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:09,755
Rym: What are you gonna do about it big?

1144
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:13,094
Scott: Oh is like not even as big as like the pinky finger But you know what.

1145
01:14:13,214 --> 01:14:13,858
Rym: what are you gonna?

1146
01:14:13,879 --> 01:14:15,630
Rym: Do you can't pilot that thing by yourself?

1147
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:16,575
Rym: You can't even make it move.

1148
01:14:16,917 --> 01:14:19,029
Scott: I can go up to the bridge and fire the main gun.

1149
01:14:19,652 --> 01:14:20,716
Rym: Are you gonna point that at me?

1150
01:14:20,736 --> 01:14:21,920
Rym: you need a gunnery person?

1151
01:14:22,342 --> 01:14:24,390
Scott: No you can that all in from one spot.

1152
01:14:24,771 --> 01:14:25,495
Rym: No, you can't.

1153
01:14:25,535 --> 01:14:26,841
Rym: you can't watch those shows.

1154
01:14:26,961 --> 01:14:28,850
Scott: This is why this would take a whole episode to answer this.

1155
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:31,817
Scott: Sdf1 macross is the perfect choice.

1156
01:14:32,299 --> 01:14:34,529
Scott: either that or super stardestroyer.

1157
01:14:35,491 --> 01:14:36,696
Rym: That's not a robot.

1158
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:37,640
Scott: It's a mecha.

1159
01:14:37,942 --> 01:14:38,966
Rym: How is that a mecha?

1160
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:40,894
Scott: That's a Shit, it's a mecha.

1161
01:14:40,975 --> 01:14:41,597
Rym: It's a space shit.

1162
01:14:41,617 --> 01:14:42,059
Scott: It's a mecha.

1163
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,568
Rym: I think I think the definition of mecha is has arms superstar has arms.

1164
01:14:47,118 --> 01:14:47,769
Scott: Hi Death Star.

1165
01:14:52,294 --> 01:14:52,940
Scott: All right, we're done.

1166
01:14:53,001 --> 01:14:53,909
