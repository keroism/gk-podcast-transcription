Scott: We promised like double time that we would never advertise on GeekNights or Sell ads on GeekNights.

7
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:43,459

Scott: there's get sponsors for GeekNights or anything like that.

9
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:50,735
Scott: but Eventually you know.

10
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:55,336
Scott: I guess you know like if someone came and offered us like a billion dollars We wouldn't be able to refuse.

11
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:56,261
Rym: Scott is the one.

12
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:57,890
Rym: this was his idea, and he accepted it.

13
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,408
Rym: So I'm just gonna let him tell you what is going on.

14
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,695
Scott: So I guess I don't know.

15
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:08,110
Scott: should we dilly-dally or like beat around the bush, or you should get right to it.

16
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:09,214
Rym: Think you know.

17
00:01:09,274 --> 00:01:11,202
Rym: we always say you know everyone has a price.

18
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:13,290
Rym: There's a point at which you can't refuse.

19
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,092
Rym: I mean think about it.

20
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:18,603
Rym: say someone said hey, would you punch your mom for five bucks?

21
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:21,069
Rym: No how about fifty five hundred?

22
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,548
Scott: Thousand fifty million, and then your mom would say hit me.

23
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:28,774
Scott: So even you know.

24
00:01:28,854 --> 00:01:34,234
Scott: no matter how much you make a promise and how much you know you're the type of person who will never Break promises.

25
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,370
Scott: there is always some set of conditions in the world.

26
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:38,577
Scott: You know who know you?

27
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:40,570
Scott: they you might not even be able to conceive of them.

28
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:47,820
Scott: But there might be like this incredibly rare Circumstance of events where you will go back on your promise.

29
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,341
Scott: granted

30
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:54,842
Rym: for me to go back on my word would often take some Sort of I don't know promise of supernatural powers

31
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:56,448
Scott: something like that maybe

32
00:01:56,488 --> 00:01:56,870
Rym: wings

33
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:05,276
Scott: but anyway, we we have gone back on our word in a way and I am simultaneously

34
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:06,203
Rym: pleased

35
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:15,150
Scott: but also Ashamed to announce that this episode of GeekNights is sponsored by the letter.

36
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,279
Rym: That's enough of that.

37
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:23,910
Rym: we learned our lesson last year.

38
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,310
Scott: Goddamn, what lesson did you be learning last year?

39
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,990
Rym: Talking like a bad pirate for more than about 20 seconds via mighty painful.

40
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,165
Scott: I heard it also be painful for the listeners.

41
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,270
Rym: ears, right?

42
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:44,658
Rym: Peg ear it however be talked like a pirate day One of our most sacred holiday.

43
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:49,295
Rym: it honestly it is one of the few holidays I actually celebrate.

44
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:51,425
Rym: I really do celebrate it and there aren't many.

45
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:57,290
Rym: I don't celebrate Christmas I I celebrate Thanksgiving in that I end up going to people's houses and having part.

46
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,883
Rym: But I don't celebrate it as a holiday and I know for a long time.

47
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:08,997
Rym: It's pretty much that International Day of Slayer, which I may or may not ever be able to celebrate again And yell at the sky day,

48
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:20,290
Scott: yeah, but I mean, you know it back in the day You'd have holidays and you'd celebrate the holiday, you know nowadays I guess there are people out there who do celebrate the holidays, but there are most holidays.

49
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:26,385
Scott: I mean, I might do something be like, you know, it's a holiday there Therefore my mom's having a dinner at her house.

50
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:29,330
Scott: So I go to it, but I don't actually actively celebrate the holiday.

51
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:33,630
Scott: Holiday one holiday to holiday three and holiday four Chinese food.

52
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:37,544
Rym: Yeah, it only happens on Christmas and then you set off the alarm in the house.

53
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:39,010
Rym: Yeah, but then the police come.

54
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:43,931
Scott: But it's not like I'm actively celebrating the holiday for what the holiday is Except.

55
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:47,021
Scott: well, the thing is I don't think about presidents on Presidents Day.

56
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,044
Rym: I think who?

57
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:49,007
Rym: four-day weekend.

58
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:49,970
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

59
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:59,430
Rym: I think the thing is that a long time ago when a lot of these holidays were celebrated more fervently It was that the holiday itself was an important part of culture and was celebrated.

60
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:12,994
Rym: And I think this is generally true more and more of our generation and the you know So-called internet generation that those holidays don't mean much to us other than especially those fake card company holidays Mother's Day.

61
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:15,810
Scott: Fuck you not fuck mothers, but fuck you Mother's Day.

62
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,522
Scott: I'm no I'm done buying cards.

63
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:30,367
Rym: if anyone didn't realize the thing is and my family at least as Accepted this because when they realized after many years that it wasn't just me forgetting It was just that I refused to buy trite gifts for any holiday.

64
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:38,389
Scott: if I buy a gift It's I'm not gonna spend five dollars and a piece of cardboard for you and I'm not gonna buy you a gift Just because it's a certain day of the year.

65
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,960
Scott: I'll buy you a gift if I see something that I think you would.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:54,510
Rym: what I was saying is just that these holidays used to Have cultural meaning but our generation at least many of us in it or at least myself and Scott and many of our friends Holidays that are that's not part of our culture anymore.

67
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,610
Rym: My culture is much more related to things on the internet and talking like a pirate.

68
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:08,991
Rym: so holidays like International Day of Slayer are part of me and I celebrate them because I celebrate Slayer and all that it stands for Yep.

69
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:09,332
Scott: Yep.

70
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:16,192
Rym: However, I didn't celebrate International Day of Slayer the way it was supposed to be celebrated because I probably would have been fired and Arrested.

71
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:24,606
Scott: Yeah, it's always difficult that some of these geeky holidays, you know, I guess it's like anything like, you know Those people who say oh, it's my religion to like smoke weed all day.

72
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:25,830
Scott: It's 420.

73
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,310
Scott: Yeah, well, it sort of doesn't work if you actually have to go and interact with the world.

74
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:35,528
Rym: I mean, I had to meet a client today if I had said I be the communication specialist in stalling.

75
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:39,535
Rym: you switches Over with the executives.

76
00:05:39,635 --> 00:05:47,448
Scott: No, I don't think so either, you know, so your options are you know to either take the day off or not celebrate your holiday to the fullest.

77
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:53,230
Rym: I Celebrate it in that I'm excited about it all day, even if I don't get to do much about it during the day.

78
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:56,221
Scott: I I spoke like a pirate when I went to the GameStop today.

79
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:59,172
Rym: I always will well one I'll always do it.

80
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:02,662
Rym: whenever I'm I see a person who I think might be cool.

81
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:03,985
Scott: It's not employees.

82
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:05,510
Rym: It's definitely a test.

83
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,529
Rym: Hey, remember when we were in with the best GameStop ever?

84
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:14,090
Scott: Yeah, it was so in an Otakon in you know, there's like this mall attached to the hotel that we stay in.

85
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:21,165
Rym: We really crappy mall - yeah and before we went to Wildwood myself Scott and Pete went to this mall because Scott decided he needed shoes.

86
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:23,190
Rym: So he wanted her on the mall.

87
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,103
Rym: He didn't find his shoes and then couldn't find a purse to match him.

88
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:30,722
Scott: enough with this stupidity There's a GameStop in the mall and the game stuff.

89
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:32,990
Rym: I went to this GameStop while Scott was looking for shoes.

90
00:06:33,031 --> 00:06:34,368
Scott: I was at the GameStop also.

91
00:06:35,572 --> 00:06:37,525
Rym: You couldn't find shoes with the right here.

92
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:42,643
Scott: They had The GameStop had two of the coolest GameStop employees ever.

93
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:45,030
Scott: they actually knew games and cared and they were cool.

94
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:50,749
Rym: Yep, cuz at first I mean it was normal GameStop banner and I was like whatever and the girl was kind of snarky.

95
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:53,659
Rym: But at the same time she expressed she said kind of like.

96
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,630
Rym: I forget what game but a really shitty game was awesome.

97
00:06:57,473 --> 00:06:59,843
Rym: And I look and I think huh should I interact with this person?

98
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:00,807
Rym: Yes, I should.

99
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:01,430
Rym: What are you talking about?

100
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,172
Rym: That game's crap.

101
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:03,015
Rym: She's like, huh?

102
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,140
Rym: You're right blah blah blah.

103
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:05,324
Rym: I was being snarky.

104
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:05,986
Rym: Check it out.

105
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:06,729
Rym: How snarky I am.

106
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:09,353
Rym: No, I was.

107
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:10,717
Rym: I was paraphrasing the meaning.

108
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:14,670
Rym: she said something else but the meaning of her words was check out how snarky I am.

109
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:21,190
Scott: Yeah anyway We're not gonna talk like a pirate the whole show because last year people complained.

110
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,888
Scott: Well, I can my throat would complain even though my throat is like twice rims throat.

111
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:27,755
Rym: Yeah Well, the thing is we're getting.

112
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:29,781
Rym: we're getting better at this our voices.

113
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:30,905
Rym: I mean Otakon.

114
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:36,157
Rym: despite doing four shows I didn't lose my voice Me either but it was.

115
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:38,870
Scott: I was quite tired and I'm actually kind of tired now.

116
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,895
Scott: I mean, I think I need some extra because we stayed up all night playing a game that may or may not have come out One extra hour.

117
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:47,050
Rym: Yeah, but you also stayed up the previous night waiting for the game.

118
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:49,768
Scott: I think so not much though longer than you should have.

119
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:57,030
Rym: Yeah Anyway, anyway, it is anime manga comic day in addition to being a dishing addition to being talked like a pirate day.

120
00:07:57,452 --> 00:08:01,187
Rym: So speaking of pirates, you might have heard of this anime called one piece.

121
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:14,940
Rym: Ah now one piece, uh I don't want to get into how I feel about one piece that the concept the style the aesthetics the characters the story Everything about this show is awesome.

122
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,507
Rym: And it's so up my alley.

123
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:20,297
Rym: I could cry Yeah, but the actual show is just crap.

124
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:23,056
Scott: The manga is also Like.

125
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:23,439
Scott: I read.

126
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,110
Scott: I have 11 volumes of the manga.

127
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,483
Scott: I own them right and like cuz I read like the first couple volumes.

128
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:29,186
Scott: they were awesome.

129
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:37,283
Scott: and then Like it got to a point where I realized that like, okay The last two volumes are just the same fight and it didn't stop.

130
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,289
Scott: and then it got back to awesome.

131
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:49,547
Scott: And then there was like two volumes of a fight and then eventually like in volumes 9 10 11 They fight the fish man, and they're just fighting the fish man for like three volumes and nothing happens.

132
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:50,369
Scott: and I'm like, what the hell?

133
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,970
Rym: It's one of those just shown in fighting shows that goes on forever.

134
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,450
Scott: But then in volume 11 like they get back to business and it's awesome.

135
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:07,029
Scott: And I'm like if only they cut out the fighting parts and made them like, you know Like just ten pages maybe of like there's a fight who wins and they just stuck with.

136
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:09,329
Scott: you know The way they're doing stuff for all the plot stuff.

137
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:12,488
Scott: It'd be like one of the best manga ever out by like 200 volumes of it.

138
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:22,570
Scott: but of course there would only be like 50 volumes because there's 150 volumes of Punch kick bite who knows what and I can't deal with that.

139
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:34,170
Rym: But aside from that the issue here is very simply that many of you may or may not have seen the English adaptation of one piece What is notoriously horrendous?

140
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,756
Rym: I believe there's a relevant VG cats about it.

141
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:44,416
Rym: that pretty much sums it up for you, but it awful might be a word terrible Disgusting Vomit a shis.

142
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,310
Rym: it's absolutely horrid.

143
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:52,630
Rym: I mean, I generally don't like a lot of dubs, but this one stands out for being particularly bad.

144
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:56,603
Scott: Particularly even more bad is the the hip-hop ish opening song.

145
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:58,309
Scott: They replaced the actual opening song.

146
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:00,536
Rym: man Why can't it be like Italy they have?

147
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:04,409
Scott: like the Italian opener to one piece is better than the Japanese.

148
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:04,650
Scott: open.

149
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,101
Rym: It's like the best opener to any anime ever.

150
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:08,387
Scott: I wouldn't go that far.

151
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,150
Rym: name a better one.

152
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:13,362
Rym: I really like the master Keaton opener, but try gun openers pretty cool.

153
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:17,869
Rym: It's okay the I like the song But the opener itself isn't great.

154
00:10:18,353 --> 00:10:22,096
Rym: Okay good song and Open like an opener as a whole.

155
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:25,368
Rym: watching the one piece under seed has really awesome opening.

156
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:30,462
Rym: all right Yeah, I got to give you that Gundam seed head this way just pumping me the fuck off.

157
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:37,869
Rym: it sure did all right anyway, so Funimation, I don't know if we've talked about this or not is read dubbing one piece.

158
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,106
Scott: Well, what happened was that there the other people are putting out one piece, and then they stopped.

159
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:50,170
Scott: and good Yeah, then these people picked up one piece And they're putting out the volumes of one piece on DVD from where the other people left off.

160
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:53,825
Scott: But they're doing the dub better, and I guess they're doing it uncut.

161
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:54,870
Scott: ish all right.

162
00:10:55,453 --> 00:11:02,565
Scott: And I forget what the status was if they're going to re-release the older Volumes to like make up for the ones the other people screwed up or not.

163
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:03,590
Rym: I could have looked that up.

164
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:08,920
Scott: I just didn't care because I don't really Actually really old news that the fact that they're redoing it.

165
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:17,870
Rym: the news is you if you live anywhere near Atlanta Or if you can wait, I don't know 24 hours for someone to upload whatever thing they film from it.

166
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:22,950
Rym: They're going to premiere the new dub at anime weekend, Atlanta, which I believe is this weekend.

167
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,266
Scott: Oh, I know a bunch of people who be there.

168
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:30,446
Scott: yeah Anime world order and all those people a bunch of other anime podcasters that aren't GeekNights.

169
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:31,289
Rym: I don't know.

170
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:31,690
Rym: it's weird.

171
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,070
Rym: I there was a time when I would have gone to like any anime convention like just about it.

172
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,624
Rym: Atlanta is not that far away, but we got stuff doing this weekend.

173
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:39,845
Scott: Well.

174
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:40,368
Rym: It's more.

175
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:40,950
Rym: It's more than that.

176
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:46,389
Rym: It's that I can't we do so much stuff now with GeekNights that I just I can't justify going to a spike.

177
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,568
Rym: uber Con is probably the smallest con I could justify taking the time to go to.

178
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,532
Scott: well It's a gaming.

179
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:57,263
Rym: I can justify going to a lot smaller gaming con than anime con, but like the smallest anime Con I could really go to now is katsu con.

180
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:03,370
Scott: Yeah, maybe But in you know this like this weekend is going to be a crazy weekend of geekery.

181
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,634
Scott: There's all sorts of crazy geeky.

182
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:11,236
Rym: Yeah, because I'm doing the pregame for my first burning wheel game the first burning wheel campaign Our group has ever run.

183
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,770
Rym: that happens to be possibly about pirates.

184
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:29,117
Rym: Yeah, not right away, but eventually and we're also playing D&D and a bunch of other stuff, but also here I'm going to quote from anime news network the episodes which feature voice actress Colleen Clink beard clinking beard.

185
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:32,088
Scott: she was the girl on the way right in our match game.

186
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:38,480
Rym: Oh no no no I just I point out is talk like a pirate day and That's quite a pirate surname there.

187
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,027
Scott: Oh, oh it is you're right.

188
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:41,907
Scott: Yes thinking beer.

189
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:46,405
Rym: However dispelled on animators network as clink beard they did it.

190
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:48,010
Scott: did they do that on purpose for pirate day?

191
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,174
Scott: Or is that a mess up?

192
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:55,455
Rym: You know I'm not going to disparage anime news network because they're the only Useful press we get.

193
00:12:55,796 --> 00:12:56,759
Rym: so I'll just leave it at that

194
00:12:57,281 --> 00:13:02,038
Scott: all right, so my main man Kazuo Koike

195
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:07,037
Rym: known for various things that we may or may not have talked about Otakon and maybe not he's

196
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,884
Scott: known for lone wolf and cub believe it had gotten

197
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:10,490
Rym: in trouble for possibly

198
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:12,435
Scott: He started a new company.

199
00:13:12,997 --> 00:13:33,504
Scott: the company is called Kazuo Koike Gekiga Sonjuku company limited and what this company is going to do is They're going to teach mangaka and other manga type creators about copyright and Intellectual property because a lot of them don't know and you know.

200
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:40,185
Scott: so this is going to be like hey Manga people now you can learn if people are ripping you off, and you can sue them and whatnot.

201
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:43,356
Scott: and I guess Kazuo Koike You know is sort of like.

202
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:44,641
Scott: I guess try to.

203
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:50,930
Scott: I guess he feels that like manga people He knows that manga people are getting scans lated and all this sort of business.

204
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,530
Scott: And he knows that a lot more manga people are making a lot of money by selling their manga to the u.s.

205
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:01,110
Scott: So he's trying to educate them into you know knowing their rights to intellectual property, so they don't get ripped off.

206
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:06,448
Rym: I mean, it's hard to say what the true motivation or result of this is going to be.

207
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:22,289
Scott: oh, yeah I have no idea, but that's what it seems like to me, and it's apparently this is an extension of his You know manga artist training program Which has been around for a long time and like a lot of famous mangaka have graduated from Kazuo Koike's manga training program.

208
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:36,808
Rym: like Rumiko Takahashi and other people's see I don't know how much piracy in America among English speakers would affect manga Because I don't think that the Japanese are going to be reading the English Scanslations of the manga in their country especially in manga so cheap.

209
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:48,237
Scott: no But I think that say if something gets like heavily pirated over here like that You know it might not be you know harder to license So you get less money for it seems to be.

210
00:14:48,257 --> 00:14:50,063
Rym: there's something is heavily pirated over here.

211
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:53,537
Rym: that just is a signal that hey This is super popular.

212
00:14:53,618 --> 00:14:55,125
Scott: I know, but you know who knows what?

213
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:55,869
Rym: those jetties are great.

214
00:14:56,672 --> 00:14:58,237
Scott: They always they think backwards when it comes.

215
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:05,330
Rym: as far as we know they always license things based on Pay us a giant pile of money, and then do whatever you want in America.

216
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:10,428
Rym: Yeah, so it wouldn't really affect them unless the American company was unwilling to pay.

217
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:18,820
Scott: and well We know the Kazuo Koike must think that mangaka are clueless when it comes to Intellectual property and he's gonna edumacate them.

218
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:21,150
Rym: We'll see what you prevent piracy.

219
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:30,369
Rym: I things of the day.

220
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:33,841
Rym: I've stumbled upon this randomly when I was setting up a way.

221
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:39,999
Rym: if we're gonna go to uber con in any official capacity if we're Just gonna go and play games Sadly are things that they have nothing to do with pirates.

222
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:42,167
Rym: No not at all because that that's totally lame.

223
00:15:42,187 --> 00:15:43,373
Rym: what I'm gonna Find?

224
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:44,441
Rym: a video of a pirate.

225
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:48,359
Rym: Maybe that one from That weird show with the girl with pink hair.

226
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:49,644
Scott: That's what I was just about to say.

227
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:57,390
Rym: yeah, no lazy town I'm not gonna do anything like that, but I stumbled upon this while I was looking into uber con and Apparently uber con.

228
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,219
Rym: I don't know if this is official or what, but I think it is.

229
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,930
Rym: it is a promo for the convention itself.

230
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,138
Scott: Oh, and it's not a bad idea.

231
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:07,603
Scott: you want people to come to your convention.

232
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:10,657
Scott: put a video on YouTube like hey look at our Convention it's all cool.

233
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:11,019
Scott: Well.

234
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,690
Rym: I've never seen anything like this before.

235
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:21,469
Rym: I don't know if other cons do it and I know like Otakon or something like that wouldn't do it because Otakon Doesn't really want more people to show up until the hotel expansion is built

236
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,510
Scott: And even then they only want enough people to show up extra to fill that hotel.

237
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:30,990
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's tough because like the new remember what happened at the New York Comic Con when they advertised heavily.

238
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:34,884
Scott: Yeah They advertised on television bad move for a geek convention.

239
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:37,587
Scott: cuz now everyone and their mother shows up And you don't have room for them.

240
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:37,750
Scott: well

241
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:42,427
Rym: I mean the real issue is that one New York City has more people in it than a lot of countries and

242
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:44,133
Scott: more geeks than A lot of places

243
00:16:44,414 --> 00:17:03,850
Rym: yes, and two it's very easy to get to the Javits from anywhere in the downstate area Especially for one day, but more to the point advertising in mainstream media in any capacity for any kind of geeky con I Honestly think does super super well, and I think anime world order touched on this a while ago.

244
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:19,470
Rym: But you realize that people like us who are you know we're geeky and we're into geeky things like we watch anime Or we read comics, but we're also on the internet, and we talk about it And we consume media related to but not directly coming from our interests.

245
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,998
Rym: Yeah, we're actively geeky.

246
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:28,069
Scott: I mean I don't just play video games You know, but I also go out and I read blogs about video games, and I forum about video games.

247
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:29,990
Scott: We're podcast about video game.

248
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,271
Scott: We're

249
00:17:30,492 --> 00:17:39,350
Rym: on the radar and all of you are on the radar too because you listen to things like this The majority of anime fans the majority of comic fans the majority of manga fans

250
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,105
Scott: The vast majority like 90% don't

251
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:51,510
Rym: even know that Conventions exist or at most they know there's a local con that they go to every year, and that's it.

252
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:53,618
Scott: Yeah, I mean most video game people.

253
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:06,007
Scott: they they might read a video game magazine Maybe and they kind of go to their game stop every once in a while And they see what's on the shelf and they see if there's anything they like and all that stuff that like.

254
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:09,269
Scott: we see that You know we say oh, it's just hype blah blah blah blah blah.

255
00:18:09,732 --> 00:18:10,616
Scott: That's all they get.

256
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:11,279
Scott: is that hype?

257
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:17,770
Rym: if they even get that and that more importantly They're not on the radar in the sense that they don't talk about their video games on the internet.

258
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:23,650
Rym: So the internet and all the press around geekery tends to become kind of a an echo chamber where?

259
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:34,189
Rym: We see the news that we're interested in and the news agencies and the news people and I guess people like us Talk about the news that we think we're all interested in and those people are just totally out of that loop.

260
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:36,295
Scott: Think about this right.

261
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:37,480
Scott: here is an example.

262
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,370
Scott: Team Fortress 2 right just came with the beta and everything.

263
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:49,829
Rym: Most video game people have no clue, dude I was playing fortress forever and when I brought up Team Fortress 2 hardly anyone knew what it was.

264
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:53,409
Scott: Yep, I mean there was like one guy who was like yeah, it's coming out whoo.

265
00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:01,130
Rym: But anyway a promo like this I think is actually a great idea especially for a con that can and wants to expand.

266
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:05,110
Rym: I mean say you didn't know anything about gaming and you didn't know that they're like you play games.

267
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:10,630
Rym: So you didn't know there was a gaming con or you didn't know what they were about and you saw this hot shit.

268
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:11,526
Rym: I want to go to that.

269
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:17,002
Scott: Yeah I mean what's better advertisement for a convention than videos of the convention on YouTube?

270
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:21,901
Scott: people can see what actually goes on there and If that's something they would like they'd be like, oh man.

271
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:23,690
Scott: Look there's something going on at that place.

272
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,596
Scott: I want to go to that place also.

273
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:32,479
Rym: this promo in particular is very well done and it is an exact Indication of what uber con is like.

274
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,724
Rym: to the point cuz.

275
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:35,090
Rym: I've been going for a number of years.

276
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,704
Scott: I watched it and I was like, oh, I'm an uber con.

277
00:19:36,744 --> 00:19:36,926
Scott: Oh wait.

278
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:37,329
Scott: No, I'm not.

279
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:38,414
Rym: I mean I went for.

280
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:43,171
Rym: yeah, I went for a while but before Scott even when I would have you had one time before I Went.

281
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:46,182
Rym: yeah, that was a long time before it was one time.

282
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:48,310
Scott: Yeah, you went to one more uber con than me.

283
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,133
Rym: Yes, I did.

284
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:51,806
Rym: And you know what all our other friends have only been to one uber con.

285
00:19:52,027 --> 00:19:54,302
Rym: Yeah, it's true I played more Lou Crane than you.

286
00:19:54,323 --> 00:20:00,850
Rym: Oh, no But The con is the same every year like it's the same people.

287
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:01,553
Rym: There's the.

00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:05,190
Rym: if you watch this video like we're watching it and it's like all right all that guy.

Rym: I know those kids.

00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:08,910
Rym: I played a game with that guy.

292
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:10,357
Rym: I played a game with that guy.

293
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,769
Rym: that is katsu and Alex our friends.

294
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:16,100
Scott: Yeah, this video has our friends playing guitar hero in it.

295
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,003
Scott: It's pretty cool.

296
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:18,468
Scott: We didn't even expect that.

297
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:19,929
Scott: and then oh look there They are okay.

298
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:26,333
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is I thought back and every uber con I've ever been to I see the same people the same vendors the Same everything.

299
00:20:26,353 --> 00:20:31,214
Scott: it was even one guy that I always saw at uber con and I saw him at kinetic con and I was like Do I know you from somewhere?

300
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:32,680
Scott: He's like probably uber cause.

301
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,466
Scott: the only con I go to this is the first non uber con con I've been to and I'm like, oh man, I seen you.

302
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:43,630
Rym: Yep So uber con is kind of like this close-knit family of gamers in Jersey, North Jersey.

303
00:20:44,331 --> 00:20:48,654
Rym: If you're a gamer totally check out uber con, it's awesome and we'll be there Alright.

304
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:50,022
Scott: check this thing of the day already.

305
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:51,389
Scott: This made me laugh a lot.

306
00:20:52,012 --> 00:20:55,545
Rym: You know the lol cats and the pursuant lol rats.

307
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:56,348
Scott: Yes.

308
00:20:56,449 --> 00:21:00,700
Scott: Well It was bound to happen if it was obvious if you thought about it.

309
00:21:01,282 --> 00:21:04,049
Scott: lol thulu kathulu photography cheeseburger.

310
00:21:05,949 --> 00:21:08,350
Scott: I Has color it from beyond space.

311
00:21:08,611 --> 00:21:15,441
Rym: I think my favorite one is cat like tike it typing Detected and it's kathulu trying to type kathulu for talking.

312
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:18,170
Scott: I made you a fish god cult, but I eat it it.

313
00:21:18,572 --> 00:21:20,770
Scott: I'm off your coast mutating your village.

314
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:28,416
Rym: I was actually laughing out loud when I read because I've seen like the one or two of these every now and then but a Bunch of them together.

315
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:30,970
Rym: It's kind of like a bunch of evil artifacts all in one room.

316
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,472
Rym: It's just it.

317
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:36,650
Rym: the power of the south then overwhelms is greater than the individual part.

318
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:43,782
Scott: It's like when a guy detects magic and there's like a magic rod and he goes Magic rod and a guy detects magic in like the magic throne room and he goes blind.

319
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,429
Scott: your sanity has flavor nom nom nom.

320
00:21:47,237 --> 00:21:48,530
Rym: So back to piracy.

321
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:59,860
Rym: we're gonna talk about piracy and copyright and all that business and how it relates to the anime industry because anime is really this weird gray area and there's still there.

322
00:22:00,201 --> 00:22:14,263
Rym: there hasn't really been a consensus as to how to deal with it and It's changed so much even in the past few years that I mean remember when we got to school like when we got to RIT the idea of digital fansubs online was still unheard of.

323
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:27,792
Rym: and when I downloaded the eskaflowne Fansub and burned it to a CD and brought it to club People freaked out and half the club was like you're a dirty pirate and half the club was like I see the future Yep, like.

324
00:22:27,832 --> 00:22:32,263
Scott: I didn't even really understand what was going on at first like digital.

325
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:33,746
Rym: What I don't guess.

326
00:22:33,827 --> 00:22:45,039
Rym: I mean I had 40 or 50 VHS tapes that were fansubs of things that I'd gotten from fansubbers from either mailing them VHS's or from buying them for like $2 each.

327
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:48,852
Scott: and then someone had a CD-ROM that had the eskaflowne in the movie and I Was like what?

328
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:49,975
Rym: Yeah, I don't get it.

329
00:22:50,216 --> 00:22:56,756
Rym: and for me the CD-ROM I made because I downloaded it from a website Yep, and I thought wait a minute.

330
00:22:57,157 --> 00:23:01,930
Rym: What if more Japanese shows that I can't get ahold of are on the internet?

331
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:04,780
Scott: Well, really this to me this is the issue here right?

332
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,110
Scott: you look at something like music piracy, right?

333
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,521
Scott: Well, I guess music piracy of music from the record labels, right?

334
00:23:10,742 --> 00:23:13,050
Scott: You're in the country where these things are available.

335
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:15,139
Scott: They are making these things available to you.

336
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,863
Scott: They're in the store.

337
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:16,566
Scott: You can buy them.

338
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:17,671
Scott: the original one It's.

339
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:18,373
Scott: it's not like.

340
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:22,910
Scott: it's inaccessible, you know, and the only reason the pirate it is just did not pay.

341
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:24,600
Scott: You know cuz you don't you don't want to pay for it.

342
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,505
Scott: It's right there.

343
00:23:25,646 --> 00:23:26,149
Scott: There it is.

344
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,735
Scott: It's not like some other place.

345
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:29,763
Scott: gets it first and then you get it later.

346
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:31,649
Scott: It's not like you know.

347
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,989
Scott: It's in a different language and you need to translate it.

348
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:37,843
Scott: It's just if you pirate it, you're you're just.

349
00:23:37,863 --> 00:23:40,253
Scott: you're avoiding paying for it Which you know.

350
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:49,850
Scott: when I was in high school in college, I was all about pirating things, you know video games music Whatever because I had a lot of free time and not a lot of money.

351
00:23:50,211 --> 00:24:04,689
Scott: So even you know moral quandaries aside and of course all this is illegal I Felt it was in my best interest to pirate things because I had plenty of time to go and dig around Peer-to-peer networks to get the music and not enough money to buy it.

352
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:11,723
Scott: So pirating got me more stuff and I was spending time I didn't care about and saving money, which I didn't care about.

353
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:15,140
Rym: see the thing is though It's weird how I always treated anime differently.

354
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:34,247
Rym: I mean I pirated music like Constantly possibly maybe not deniability here since I'm talking to an audience But I may or may not have downloaded many many many many many gigabytes of music from American labels foreign labels Whatever and I fired in movies maybe and all those things, but I never.

355
00:24:34,768 --> 00:24:49,249
Rym: well, it's funny I never I would say I never pirated anime, but I did download fan subs and I guess the difference in my mind and aligns a lot of anime fans Especially back then was that a lot of that anime was not available in English period.

356
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,773
Scott: yeah I mean legally.

357
00:24:50,954 --> 00:24:52,037
Scott: there is no question all.

358
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:52,839
Scott: it's all illegal.

359
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,103
Scott: It's all illegal.

360
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:55,467
Scott: There is no question about it.

361
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:56,510
Scott: No dispute, whatever.

362
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:01,215
Scott: but morally like You know it's like morally.

363
00:25:01,296 --> 00:25:04,668
Scott: I sort of justified myself pirating music because the evil record companies.

364
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:05,310
Scott: They're overpriced.

365
00:25:05,491 --> 00:25:06,474
Rym: I didn't justify it at all.

366
00:25:06,514 --> 00:25:10,930
Rym: I thought I'm totally stealing this because technology lets me I also did that too.

367
00:25:11,191 --> 00:25:13,860
Rym: I never even once said to myself what I'm doing is right.

368
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,402
Rym: I thought man.

369
00:25:14,442 --> 00:25:15,626
Rym: This is totally awesome.

370
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:16,509
Rym: He's totally illegal.

371
00:25:19,471 --> 00:25:22,845
Scott: Like I guess more of the time I would justify pirating software.

372
00:25:22,866 --> 00:25:27,464
Scott: like you know yeah This is they can't possibly expect me to pay $800 for the software.

373
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,010
Scott: I absolutely need to do these things.

374
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,103
Rym: You know I never did that either when I pirated software.

375
00:25:31,123 --> 00:25:40,210
Scott: I thought goddamn I just stole 800 bucks, but when it came to anime you know the moral justification was this is a Japanese thing.

376
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:42,610
Scott: It's not gonna be available over here.

377
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,534
Scott: It's like it.

378
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:47,470
Scott: There's no way that I can ever see this in my language without breaking the law.

379
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:50,390
Scott: It is a work of art that is inaccessible to me.

380
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:54,997
Scott: It's like if you went into the museum and someone put a piece of cloth over the painting And I'm just lifting up the cloth.

381
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:56,645
Scott: what what's so bad about that?

382
00:25:57,087 --> 00:26:07,649
Rym: you know but Obviously technology in the last five to ten years has changed things dramatically and also because of interest in anime spawned largely from these original fan subs and whatever.

383
00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:17,150
Rym: Anime is super popular in the US and most anime That's I mean most anime period gets released in English legally, and you can just go buy a DVD.

384
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:22,597
Scott: Yeah, I mean a lot of people have even been like oh, this is never getting released over here And then it does it's.

385
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,770
Scott: you know it might not be a good release.

386
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:29,710
Scott: It might be an overpriced release bandai visual, but it comes out.

387
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,596
Scott: I mean they're putting out crazy shit.

388
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:39,930
Scott: the only stuff that really isn't getting released is like super old Obscure stuff like if it's old, but it's got any measure of popularity.

389
00:26:40,171 --> 00:26:40,935
Scott: It's coming out.

390
00:26:41,035 --> 00:26:42,784
Rym: Sazai-san's not getting released.

391
00:26:42,824 --> 00:26:45,114
Scott: No Sazai-san is something That's not gonna get released.

392
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:51,763
Scott: You know, but I mean isn't crayon Shin-chan is on like Cartoon Network Like you know they got.

393
00:26:51,864 --> 00:26:55,609
Scott: go lion Which is what Voltron was in Japanese is gonna be coming out.

394
00:26:56,212 --> 00:27:01,150
Scott: All this stuff that we said this will never ever ever be in released in the US legally.

395
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:02,577
Scott: It's coming now.

396
00:27:02,939 --> 00:27:05,170
Rym: You know this is the point where a normal show.

397
00:27:05,271 --> 00:27:15,920
Rym: We just we talked about the history and we talked about you know well at the gray area this and here the blah blah blah blah and we're gonna skip all that and just get right to How we feel about it today as it stands.

398
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,659
Rym: forget the past forget the rationales in the past Forget but fan subs brought the industry up.

399
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:22,141
Rym: Whatever.

400
00:27:22,763 --> 00:27:24,869
Rym: Here's how we look at it right now.

401
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:42,053
Scott: Well right now the way I look at it is this right if there's an anime that is Super duper old right and the odds of it coming out in the US are super super low for example Space runaway idaeon right that's not coming out here, man It's just not it.

402
00:27:42,435 --> 00:27:45,427
Rym: or if it does it'll come out a long time for now and we'd probably just buy it.

403
00:27:45,527 --> 00:27:47,090
Scott: or a legend the galactic heroes.

404
00:27:47,891 --> 00:27:52,642
Scott: Right that show yeah, but these shows people are fansubbing them and rightly so.

405
00:27:52,703 --> 00:28:13,870
Scott: they are making an old work of art that I That while yes, it's all illegal but if I had my way and I think a lot of people agree that's so old it should be in the public domain and There's no way any person who doesn't speak Japanese and doesn't want to spend a lot of money to buy DVDs from a foreign land which is also sort of illegal to buy region 2 DVDs and play them in the US.

406
00:28:14,031 --> 00:28:16,389
Rym: I mean it varies from country to country and all these things.

407
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:19,169
Rym: but Region law I won't get into it.

408
00:28:19,313 --> 00:28:19,465
Scott: No.

409
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:26,403
Scott: But like it is illegal to say buy a Japanese DDR machine to bring it to the US and play it Yep, and it was the music is licensed Yeah.

410
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:33,110
Scott: And it's similarly illegal to say buy a legend of the galactic heroes region 2 DVD from Japan and watch it in the US.

411
00:28:33,732 --> 00:28:41,750
Scott: So you could probably do it legally if you paid certain tariffs basically illegal for you to experience This work of art in a way that you can understand.

412
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,598
Rym: Oh, I thought I'm forget the legal argument.

413
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:49,282
Rym: if it is or is not actually legal because of that I have no problem, right?

414
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:55,581
Scott: I have no moral quandary with Downloading a fansub of that show and watching it even though it's illegal.

415
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:57,927
Rym: Well, I was just gonna say regarding region 2 DVDs.

416
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:04,830
Rym: Ah The fact that DVDs are so expensive in Japan pretty much precludes me from ever buying a Japanese DVD no matter what.

417
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:10,890
Scott: Nope, pretty much unless they decide to go with reasonable pricing which also extends to Bandai visuals releases.

418
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:12,516
Scott: Yes, it does which I might.

419
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:13,520
Rym: I'll be honest.

420
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:14,625
Rym: I might just pirate them.

421
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:15,890
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

422
00:29:16,191 --> 00:29:18,282
Rym: Maybe the price is just too much.

423
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:19,870
Scott: The price is just too much.

424
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:20,091
Scott: I'm.

425
00:29:20,151 --> 00:29:22,659
Scott: probably what I'm gonna do is Netflix them or

426
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,063
Rym: if Netflix even bothers to get

427
00:29:24,103 --> 00:29:37,310
Scott: I'm gonna wait an incredibly long amount of time like a couple years and then they'll have to bring the prices down because all these retailers who just were stupid and bought them will Have all these extra copies lying around and they can't get rid of them and they'll be in a discount bin one day.

428
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:40,664
Rym: But anyway, here is the way I like right now in terms of fansubs and all that.

429
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:41,910
Rym: I look at it pretty simply.

430
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:46,150
Rym: I want to watch what's on in Japan right now, like I was watching on TV.

431
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:50,970
Rym: So what we do is I download, you know, the fansubs of shows that are coming out right now.

432
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,982
Rym: You know episode 1 episode 2 episode 3 and watch them and see if I like them.

433
00:29:54,705 --> 00:30:11,030
Rym: if a show is really good I'll probably just keep watching it as it comes out in Japan until it finishes and then I'll be done with it if I don't super like it and Or I just don't watch it even though I did like it and eventually once it's released once it comes out in the u.s.

434
00:30:11,692 --> 00:30:14,381
Scott: Which is taking less and less time then at that point.

435
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,210
Rym: I have absolutely zero justification for fansubs.

436
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,357
Rym: I'll delete him if I've got him.

437
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:21,758
Rym: I won't even think about watching him and I'll just Netflix the DVDs.

438
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:22,020
Rym: notice.

439
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,806
Rym: I didn't say bye.

440
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:29,050
Scott: Yep I will buy the DVDs if it is a show that I know I'm gonna watch more than once because it's awesome.

441
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:36,250
Scott: And if it's in like a reasonably priced thin pack box set of some sort, I'm not buying individual DVDs anymore.

442
00:30:36,612 --> 00:30:38,622
Scott: I'm not buying huge DVD boxes.

443
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:41,377
Scott: forget that I don't have space on my shelf And that's a price.

444
00:30:41,437 --> 00:30:43,309
Scott: I'm not willing to pay when I could go with Netflix.

445
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:47,290
Rym: Yeah, Netflix, honestly Netflix is the sole reason I stopped buying anime, right?

446
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:52,870
Scott: But if you sell me your 26 episode show for 40 bucks and a little tiny box, I'll totally buy that.

447
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:59,310
Rym: Well, the thing is a lot of anime they're not like so great that I would like go out and spend money to see.

448
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:00,604
Scott: It's got to be a good show.

449
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:07,474
Rym:  no No What I'm saying is what I would do is that kind of show if it were available on TV in the u.s Like it is in Japan.

450
00:31:07,494 --> 00:31:11,510
Rym: I would probably have a TV in cable and just watch that anime.

451
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,382
Scott: Well, a lot of the shows are on TV in the u.s.

452
00:31:14,422 --> 00:31:16,069
Scott: But the thing is I don't have a TV.

453
00:31:16,391 --> 00:31:17,255
Rym: Well, no, they're not.

454
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:20,570
Rym: they're on TV far after I was wanting to see them.

455
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:24,490
Rym: Oh, but now I'm talking like right now a show this out right now in Japan.

456
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:30,230
Rym: I would just watch it on TV as it's on in America as it's on in Japan in America if that was available to me.

457
00:31:30,531 --> 00:31:31,738
Scott: Yeah, see sort of the other.

458
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:34,998
Rym: the thing is is well, but you know I say I'll watch it on TV.

459
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:43,568
Rym: when I say watch anything on TV That means I would also own a TiVo and I would watch it whenever I wanted blocking out or skipping all the commercials.

460
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:44,993
Rym: now Funny.

461
00:31:45,314 --> 00:31:48,485
Rym: so if it were legal like say why was watching one piece in the u.s.

462
00:31:48,526 --> 00:31:49,690
Rym: On Cartoon Network or whatever?

463
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:52,458
Rym: Alright, I would use a TiVo right?

464
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,550
Rym: I would watch it whenever I wanted and I would skip the commercials.

465
00:31:57,132 --> 00:32:01,870
Rym: So effectively I've gotten the same thing that I would have gotten if I'd watch the fan sub.

466
00:32:02,474 --> 00:32:06,158
Scott: Well, the thing is is is the way Advertising works.

467
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:18,370
Scott: I don't want to start talking about this But the TV network if you TiVo it even though you block the ad when I say Number goes up by one and they can tell the advertiser that one more person is watching even though they can get more money.

468
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,317
Rym: But the thing is I didn't actually watch the ad.

469
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:21,140
Scott: I does it.

470
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,207
Scott: Yeah, but that doesn't matter all but plus two.

471
00:32:23,267 --> 00:32:25,737
Rym: when I say TiVo I mean, you know myth TV.

472
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:27,404
Rym: Yes, I wouldn't pay for a TiVo.

473
00:32:27,424 --> 00:32:28,830
Scott: No, I wouldn't pay for TiVo either.

474
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:30,992
Scott: But yeah, that's you know the.

475
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:42,329
Scott: if you TiVo did or myth TV'd it the The TV company would still get money from the advertiser, but they'd be scamming the advertiser, but that's what anyone who's Sells ads is doing anyway.

476
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:50,173
Rym: Well, the point I'm trying to make is I'm making a purely functional argument that functionally and I'm not using this is not a justification argument It's just.

477
00:32:50,194 --> 00:32:51,789
Rym: I note it as interesting.

478
00:32:52,530 --> 00:33:06,050
Rym: watching a fan sub of a show that's on TV in Japan as it comes out is Pretty much the same as Watching the show as it comes out legally through legal means but not watching the commercials.

479
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:07,474
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

480
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:09,960
Rym: So functionally there's no difference between the two.

481
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,790
Rym: but legally and some would argue morally there is and I find that interesting.

482
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:19,650
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is that I pretty much refuse morally speaking to buy something sight unseen.

483
00:33:19,771 --> 00:33:25,041
Scott: I mean you wouldn't buy anything without seeing it at least some of it first, you know You wouldn't buy a car without looking at it.

484
00:33:25,122 --> 00:33:26,390
Scott: Someone has like a car under a sheet.

485
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:27,535
Scott: Do you want this car?

486
00:33:27,576 --> 00:33:28,158
Scott: ten bucks?

487
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,510
Scott: Like I don't know what they could be a piece of poop under that sheet.

488
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,073
Scott: What do I know?

489
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,150
Scott: you always you got to see something before you pay money?

490
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,205
Rym: That's either a really big piece of poop or you're really credulous.

491
00:33:37,427 --> 00:33:38,010
Scott: Yeah, who knows?

492
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,723
Scott: It could be a piece of poop in the car on the seat.

493
00:33:40,924 --> 00:33:41,909
Scott: I'll smear it in who knows.

494
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:46,059
Scott: Anyway, so the way things work now is that sure?

495
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:49,990
Scott: some anime series are on American television be it Cartoon Network or something else.

496
00:33:50,431 --> 00:33:53,138
Scott: Some movies are actually in the theaters and I go to see those.

497
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:57,470
Scott: you actually the Miyazakis and the the Satoshi Kans and whatnot.

498
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:03,530
Scott: But a lot of the anime especially the ones that I'm interested in are not on television in the u.s.

499
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,873
Scott: I don't have a television.

500
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:08,299
Scott: I'm not gonna get television or pay for cable because it's not worth it to me.

501
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:20,830
Scott: and The only way for me to see these shows is Netflix which I'll do or buy DVDs and I'm you know the Netflix queue is well, you know sort of cheap is limited and DVDs are expensive.

502
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:25,956
Scott: and I'm not gonna Netflix or get something on DVD if I haven't seen it now.

503
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:30,920
Scott: if I was in Japan I'd be able to see it for free on television and block ads with the TiVo.

504
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:32,204
Scott: But in the u.s.

505
00:34:32,264 --> 00:34:34,170
Scott: I can't do that and there's a fan sub.

506
00:34:34,492 --> 00:34:35,214
Rym: except in the u.s.

507
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,120
Rym: I can with fan subs exactly.

508
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:44,060
Scott: So I go and I get the fans up and I that's my ice You know, I'm gonna see it to decide if it's worth watching anymore.

509
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:45,620
Scott: It's it's my moral.

510
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:51,480
Scott: I guess I feel it's my moral right to see something before I go in with any sort of amount of money for it.

511
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,929
Scott: Yeah, of course up is the only way for me to do that.

512
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:57,402
Rym: the exception to that I guess would be movies as opposed to TV shows.

513
00:34:57,422 --> 00:35:03,000
Rym: Oh, yeah, because I don't see the sixth sense before I go to the theater to see the sixth sense.

514
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,040
Rym: No, but I guess I have the sixth sense.

515
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:10,800
Scott: But that's the other thing is like I usually don't see an anime movie and let until it actually comes out in the u.s.

516
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,872
Rym: Well, the thing is partly because we live in downstate New York.

517
00:35:13,932 --> 00:35:17,165
Rym: if an anime movie comes out in the u.s There's a good chance.

518
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:20,580
Rym: It'll be in the theater and we just go see it in the theater exactly, which is awesome.

519
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,346
Scott: And also if it you know The movies tend to come out in the u.s.

520
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:26,700
Scott: And there tend to be trailers that I can see on the internet for free legally.

521
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:36,064
Scott: Also, you know while a lot of the anime companies now are getting wise they're like selling downloads of their shows and they're putting some Free episodes up.

522
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:38,736
Scott: they're putting them up way after the.

523
00:35:38,756 --> 00:35:42,027
Scott: you know Japanese have it on their television.

524
00:35:42,088 --> 00:35:42,268
Rym: Yeah.

525
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:43,875
Rym: Now we know there are reasons for this.

526
00:35:43,996 --> 00:35:45,020
Rym: a lot of people speculate.

527
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:46,219
Scott: I just can't do it any faster.

528
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:59,020
Rym: Well, no a lot of people speculate that the reasons many shows are released far later than they I guess technically could have been because There's some fansubbers who do a bang up freaking job right away or pretty quickly.

529
00:35:59,382 --> 00:36:03,600
Rym: There's also some fansubbers who totally suck, but I'm not gonna talk about that I don't even care who fans up something.

530
00:36:04,102 --> 00:36:18,211
Rym: But it seems like in a lot of cases the Japanese company will put some sort of stipulation like yeah You can license our show but you can't release it until x-date because we're afraid of Re-importation because American DVDs cost less than half what Japanese DVDs cause.

531
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:23,787
Scott: and I say to that that the I actually I'm not even joking Or you know hyperbole in here.

532
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:30,649
Scott: I think the Japanese companies that are selling DVDs are Highway robbing the Japanese people.

533
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,282
Scott: the prices they charge for DVDs are Criminal.

534
00:36:34,965 --> 00:36:35,849
Scott: it's really criminal.

535
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:38,640
Scott: a DVD cost less than like a dollar to print.

536
00:36:39,141 --> 00:36:43,232
Scott: Alright the show, you know, you made your a ton of money for that show on.

537
00:36:43,513 --> 00:36:46,885
Scott: you know TV with your advertisements and whatnot You.

538
00:36:46,966 --> 00:36:49,020
Scott: you can sell the DVDs for like 20 bucks.

539
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:51,379
Scott: I bet I'll you know the same price we sell them for here.

540
00:36:51,812 --> 00:36:57,760
Scott: Yeah I bet a whole bunch of people will buy them who don't normally buy things because you charge so much freaking money for them.

541
00:36:58,061 --> 00:36:58,463
Rym: I mean we.

542
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:04,010
Rym: part of it was just that they kind of have a monopoly on the market Partly due to all this region locking crap that's around.

543
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:09,189
Rym: and I mean it's hard to say how the Japanese Economy and market would deal with cheaper DVDs and whatever.

544
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:22,537
Rym: but the point is regardless of the reasons and regardless of what would happen if they lowered them the prices are way too high and Obviously the Japanese people know this because the Japanese companies are super afraid of competition from their u.s.

545
00:37:22,597 --> 00:37:25,998
Scott: Licenses and capitalism you lose.

546
00:37:26,922 --> 00:37:34,565
Rym: But to really simplify it here's how I go about it very very simply if a show has not been released in the u.s Yet I'll watch the fan subs.

547
00:37:35,006 --> 00:37:42,672
Rym: if it's been released in the US and it's a show that I want to see again and show To other people I'll buy it a whole box set immediately as soon as

548
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:48,100
Scott: long as there is a box set that you can buy And it's not like individual DVDs for 30 bucks each.

549
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:54,407
Rym: yeah, if it's a show that I don't want to own and there aren't many shows I want to own I'll Netflix it and that'll be the end of it.

550
00:37:55,217 --> 00:38:01,839
Rym: and The only other thing I can say is that if there's a bootleg pirated copy fuck whoever's selling it.

551
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:11,500
Scott: Yeah, I mean the only thing that's really changed in terms of myself Is that you know back in the day if there was a show that you know was available in the u.s.

552
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:18,580
Scott: On DVD that I wanted to own and watch again and again I couldn't afford it and I had plenty of free time and no money.

553
00:38:19,022 --> 00:38:23,100
Scott: So I would actually you know download it in lieu of purchasing it.

554
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,493
Scott: But it's not like if I downloaded it.

555
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:26,719
Scott: I wouldn't purchase it.

556
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,121
Scott: It was.

557
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,672
Scott: I couldn't purchase it even if I didn't download it.

558
00:38:29,713 --> 00:38:31,360
Scott: so they weren't really losing money.

559
00:38:31,781 --> 00:38:35,372
Scott: And now that time is more valuable to me than money.

560
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:42,960
Scott: I'll buy it if I want it and So they're getting all the money from me that they were ever gonna get whether or not fan subs existed.

561
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:49,580
Scott: In fact, they're getting more money from me because if I wasn't able to see the fan sub and know I wanted the show I wouldn't have bought anything.

562
00:38:50,322 --> 00:38:56,882
Rym: But I do want to take a moment to talk a little bit about actual pirates as in the people who sell People

563
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:59,433
Scott: who are on boats with rocket launchers to hold up your boat or

564
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:06,588
Rym: the people who sell you know Chinese bootleg copies of anime or whatever For actual money for a profit

565
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,100
Scott: or the people who take fan subs off the internet burn them the CDs and sell them

566
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:12,457
Rym: Yeah, or in particular in the mall.

567
00:39:12,538 --> 00:39:17,737
Rym: here I mean we have a cool anime store in the mall and we have another mall that's not as crappy.

568
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:23,980
Rym: and in that mall There's another anime store and the anime store in the mall sells straight-up bootlegs.

569
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:29,405
Scott: Yeah, not even joking like yeah, these are bootleg right here in the mall We're selling them.

570
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:33,180
Rym: and the thing I want to say cuz I remember anime world order talked about this up in depth.

571
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:44,660
Rym: And if actually if you want to learn about the anime bootlegging quote-unquote industry Search for the anime world order episode about that because they go into very interesting detail and it's actually talking about mafias and stuff.

572
00:39:45,465 --> 00:39:47,338
Rym: The only point with I disagree with them on.

573
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:57,320
Rym: And while I don't disagree with them when it comes to like posters and wall scrolls and all those things even CDs But when it comes to anime DVDs There is no excuse.

574
00:39:57,842 --> 00:40:03,400
Rym: There is no way you could see a bootleg anime DVD and not know immediately that that's a bootleg.

575
00:40:03,683 --> 00:40:05,400
Rym: They're always packaged really weird.

576
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:12,160
Scott: The colors are always weird the colors are faded and the packaging is not like DVD packaging you see in Best Buy.

577
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,860
Scott: I mean, you're always getting a whole bunch of episodes and like very few discs.

578
00:40:16,221 --> 00:40:19,131
Scott: It'll be like season one through three of Naruto for 50 bucks.

579
00:40:19,513 --> 00:40:21,520
Scott: There is no way that is not a bootleg.

580
00:40:21,947 --> 00:40:22,660
Scott: It's obvious.

581
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:32,874
Rym: people Chinese writing all over the bag will notice that the cheap DVD they see from the guy at on the street is Weird looking compared to the one they saw in Best Buy.

582
00:40:32,894 --> 00:40:33,819
Rym: There was a lot more money.

583
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:35,404
Rym: I know it's not like.

584
00:40:35,444 --> 00:40:36,267
Rym: they say oh, it's cheap.

585
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:36,788
Rym: I'll buy it.

586
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:37,691
Rym: Haha pirate.

587
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:39,577
Rym: It's they really don't know.

588
00:40:39,657 --> 00:40:44,059
Rym: and if that's true I think you've got problems because it's not that hard to tell.

589
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:47,049
Rym: Yeah, I can say with certainty that I've never been fooled.

590
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,678
Scott: I've never ever been fooled by a bootleg DVD.

591
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:53,940
Scott: They're obvious Super obvious when a DVD is not profession.

592
00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:01,289
Scott: I think the part of the problem though is that people sort of they might not realize that You know, they're the even this big.

593
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:04,580
Scott: this thing exists the bootlegging, you know, it's like they see a DVD for sale.

594
00:41:04,802 --> 00:41:06,820
Scott: It's a DVD for sale what they don't know it, you know

595
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:22,786
Rym: I could see that I guess outside of urban areas But in like in New York City if you go anywhere You're gonna run into some Chinese woman at some point who says DVD want DVD DVD and if you can make eye contact with her She'll open her coat and she has a bunch of Super shady looking.

596
00:41:22,806 --> 00:41:23,570
Rym: they usually just

597
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,197
Scott: have my sheet on the side for like

598
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,502
Rym: four bucks Yep,

599
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:34,251
Scott: and I think people who buy those I think most of them know they're bootlegging like hey getting move your Jeep Whatever, you know that they really don't you know,

600
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,240
Rym: I mean if someone knows it's a bootleg.

601
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,563
Rym: I still think you're a crappy person for buying the bootleg, but as long as you're not lying to yourself I don't hate you.

602
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:51,476
Scott: Well, I think the problem is is even if they're not lying to themselves like yeah buying a bootleg They don't really have in their mind like what that really means down the line.

603
00:41:51,496 --> 00:42:04,420
Scott: They're just like yeah, this is Technically shady whatever it does They don't actually understand, you know like the whole like what's behind that DVD and how you know this bootleg came to be and and the whole market behind it ever.

604
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,587
Scott: they don't understand or even think about those things.

605
00:42:06,848 --> 00:42:11,297
Scott: and I think if they did they might think twice before buying the bootleg DVD or Not who knows?

606
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:19,125
Rym: Yeah, but it just it frightens me that so many that there is such a market for bootlegs because it's not like they're Well done like that.

607
00:42:19,426 --> 00:42:23,000
Rym: I like those old sewn May CDs, which I got burned by those a couple of times.

608
00:42:23,281 --> 00:42:29,978
Rym: Yeah, well not really burned by them because honestly the sewn May CDs were super high quality and a lot of times They were better than the actual CD.

609
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:37,000
Scott: Yeah, I mean you just take the actual CD you copy it perfectly like they're perfect.

610
00:42:37,462 --> 00:42:41,199
Rym: But the DVDs like they're so obviously bootlegs.

611
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:55,377
Rym: You'd have to be really dense to not realize that this DVD is there's something wrong with it that there's something shady going on Yeah, and I think a lot of people who say oh I got burned Yeah, I didn't realize it was a bootleg are just lying to cover for the fact that they bought a bootleg.

612
00:42:55,658 --> 00:43:00,331
Scott: Yep, and You know if you're gonna buy bootleg what that's?

613
00:43:00,352 --> 00:43:02,940
Scott: the other thing that's because the fan subs exist.

614
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:05,100
Scott: It sort of makes the bootleg stupid.

615
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:10,100
Scott: It's like you're either gonna if you're trying to save money just get the stupid fans up.

616
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,539
Scott: At least you're not giving money to some bootleg scum guy, you know.

617
00:43:14,242 --> 00:43:18,398
Scott: And if you're not trying to save money and you're gonna buy it buy the real deal.

618
00:43:18,478 --> 00:43:20,599
Scott: It's better You're gonna get more of your money.

619
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:23,448
Scott: Why would you settle for some piece of shit bootleg?

620
00:43:23,689 --> 00:43:26,096
Scott: if you're willing to pay for something buy something?

621
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:27,545
Scott: That's actually quality Don't?

622
00:43:27,851 --> 00:43:27,973
Scott: yeah?

623
00:43:28,095 --> 00:43:28,319
Scott: shit.

624
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:29,949
Scott: I mean remember that you can get better.

625
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,799
Scott: you can get better than shit for free.

626
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:35,892
Rym: You got Johnson bought that planet s bootleg and it was the fat.

627
00:43:35,932 --> 00:43:42,339
Rym: basically it was okay for two episodes and Then the fan subs degenerated into literally gibberish.

628
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,280
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's like you can get better than shit for free and you can get amazed.

629
00:43:46,421 --> 00:43:49,320
Scott: You know a really really awesome copy for money.

630
00:43:49,681 --> 00:43:54,557
Scott: Why would you ever pay money less money than the awesome copy for worse than the free one?

631
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:59,232
Scott: It makes no sense I think even regardless of the harm that bootlegs cause.

632
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:08,131
Scott: you're only making a stupid decision for yourself When you buy a bootleg because you could get better with a fan sub and if you're willing to pay money You can get better for your money.

633
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:13,939
Rym: All right on that note I wish you all a yaring talk like a pirate day, even though it's almost over.
