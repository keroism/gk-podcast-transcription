00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,305
Rym: It's Thursday March 15th.

2
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:12,188
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:14,835
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,600
Rym: We ramble a bit about vacationing.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,415
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:35,639
Scott: So I'm on the train on the way home reading this book that I'm reading the adventures of Cavalier and clay and it's a damn good book and it deserved its Pulitzer Prize, but I'm not done with it yet Uh-huh, but anyway, you should all read it.

7
00:00:36,222 --> 00:00:40,160
Scott: I'm looking at the cover of the book and on the cover of the book is the Empire State Building.

8
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:46,753
Scott: I'm just looking at it and I'm like, you know what I Can go there if I want to any time you want.

9
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,260
Rym: it's right there you pay a fee.

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,813
Rym: They let you go up and look at the city and I've only been up there once.

11
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:57,400
Scott: my grandma took me there when I was I don't know how young real young maybe eight maybe ten, you know, I don't know.

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,212
Rym: I've never been in the Empire State Building let alone up it.

13
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:02,020
Scott: So I said to myself, you know what?

14
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:04,587
Scott: No reason I can't go up there.

15
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,576
Scott: So I'm gonna I'm gonna go up there.

16
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:08,865
Scott: Maybe tomorrow No one could stop me.

17
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:09,948
Rym: well, I don't know.

18
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,296
Rym: maybe it'll be closed maybe it's it's.

19
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:13,560
Scott: actually I went to the website.

20
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:18,119
Scott: it's surprisingly open like half for half of the week.

21
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:24,140
Scott: You can go up there like 1 a.m And they'll let you up in the elevator all the way to the the observation deck.

22
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:26,995
Rym: Now maybe the one day you decide to go be the day.

23
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:27,578
Rym: There's a jumper.

24
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,451
Scott: If there's a jumper that how does that bother me?

25
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,800
Scott: Who's at the top when the jumper is at the bottom?

26
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:38,260
Rym: I'll bet if someone jumped off the Empire State Building they would close it for at least a few hours.

27
00:01:38,902 --> 00:01:40,988
Scott: I'm gonna go look up and see what happens.

28
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:41,731
Scott: besides it's real.

29
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:44,580
Scott: It's actually from what I remember when I went there.

30
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:45,083
Scott: I don't know.

31
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,419
Scott: I guess almost 20 years ago.

32
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:53,720
Scott: I don't know how old but it's pretty hard to actually jump off the highest observation deck.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:05,386
Scott: that's like a hundred something floors up is inside you're looking out windows and The observation deck where you're outside is like on the 80th something floor And there's big fences.

34
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:08,860
Scott: You'd have to be pretty awesome to get over that fence.

35
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:17,428
Rym: I remember when I was up in Canada and I went to the CN Tower with a bunch of kids from my high school and Not only is it difficult to jump off the CN Tower.

36
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,953
Rym: It's impossible.

37
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:26,260
Rym: the observation deck the highest one They let us get to actually had this cage kind of around the entire thing all the way out to the edge.

38
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,849
Rym: There was no way to get out.

39
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:42,328
Scott: Yeah, the only other really tall building I've been to the top of is the tallest building in Israel and The observation deck was basically you're on a floor and you went out and there was sort of like a balcony You know around the edge of the floor.

40
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:45,660
Scott: so you could go all around the building, but it was like a balcony.

41
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:52,100
Scott: So there was actually a roof above your head the next the bottom of the next floor and there was a fence around the side.

42
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:55,815
Scott: So you would have to basically break open the fence to get out and fall off.

43
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:59,510
Rym: the one thing I learned I mean, I didn't actually see anything from the CN Tower.

44
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,096
Rym: There was nothing but clouds.

45
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,224
Scott: I Remember I saw a lot.

46
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:07,720
Scott: I still remember I've only been to the Empire State Building once all to the top of it once.

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,980
Scott: I've been near it a zillion times and I've went in the bottom part a couple times.

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,280
Scott: But I've only been to the top once and I still remember that all the little cars they were so small.

49
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:32,939
Scott: Oh my god, the cars are so small and you can see pretty much everything like you walk around to one side Statue of Liberty is over there and you walk around the other side and you're like, oh look There's the rest of New York over there and there's New Jersey over there and there's the boats over there.

50
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:44,780
Rym: And but the primary thing I learned was that most people are Incredibly skittish even if all signs and all knowledge and all engineering point to perfect undeniable safety.

51
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:46,003
Scott: Yep, there.

52
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:53,655
Scott: I mean if you look over the edge, it's just sort of like this natural sort of vertigo inner ear kind of feeling That you know, it's like whoa.

53
00:03:54,267 --> 00:04:02,392
Rym: I don't know I didn't get maybe was just because I couldn't see anything but clouds but I actually on a dare Me and another friend of mine climbed out onto the fence and then back.

54
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:06,540
Rym: Yeah, cuz the fence was solid steel There's no way that was gonna break.

55
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,919
Scott: Yeah, some people like whoa and then they run away.

56
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:21,040
Scott: But like if I I look over the edge and there's sort of a natural internal subconscious Whoa, but then if I just stay there for a few seconds, it's like alright cool Yeah, but there were a lot of people who wouldn't even go near that fence.

57
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:31,740
Rym: They kind of hugged the wall ten feet back and obviously were shaken Wusses and it wasn't just like one person who's afraid of heights cuz that I can understand but it was the vast majority of people.

58
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,442
Scott: Wusses.

59
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:38,360
Rym: more interesting was inside that floor cuz you know the top of the CN Tower is like this UFO kind of thing.

60
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,432
Scott: Yep, it's still like the Space Needle but not inside it.

61
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:43,280
Rym: There's glass under you.

62
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,439
Rym: You can walk on glass and just look down at the ground.

63
00:04:46,184 --> 00:04:48,420
Scott: Yeah, and times glass elevators can get you.

64
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:51,712
Rym: You know how many people would not walk on that glass.

65
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:53,640
Rym: and at one point I had nothing to do with this.

66
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:07,013
Rym: But I was standing on the glass looking down and a couple of my friends were standing on the glass looking down and an unnamed other friend of mine walked over and stood on the glass and then proceeded to Get everyone's attention and then jump up and down as hard as he

67
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,199
Scott: was about to say.

68
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:11,578
Scott: But that's the thing about standing on glass is I you know?

69
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:16,240
Scott: Looking down of course would be the same as the you know the whoa and then you get cool.

70
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:20,655
Scott: But I would you know glass is sort of fragile most glass.

71
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:22,020
Rym: It was like six inches.

72
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:30,816
Scott: I know I know but most glass you encounter in your everyday life is fragile and easily Breakable and like if you stood on say the windows to your house, you might break them.

73
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:44,440
Scott: So When you encounter something that looks almost exactly the same Like even I would sort of have to get down and test it and be like, okay It's six inches thick and then I would stand on it, you know, well it was expected that you stand on it.

74
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,033
Rym: It was all over like the floor was covered in these giant tiles.

75
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:48,836
Scott: Yeah, then I've been.

76
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:57,832
Scott: I'd be fine with it as long as I trust that the engineer of the building and the fact that I don't see dead bodies or anyone else falling down is enough for me.

77
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:02,657
Rym: It's always like I remember we were at the New York Comic Con and they're all.

78
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:07,518
Rym: there's rails everywhere to make sure you don't fall off all those balconies and walkways.

79
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:11,240
Rym: and Imagine any modern public building like a mall.

80
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:11,801
Rym: Yeah You

81
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:26,760
Scott: know in a shopping mall when you're on the second floor Like the hallways in the mall are only on both sides of the mall and in the middle There's usually like a big hole and you can look down Into the first floor of the mall and there's a railing that goes around to keep you from falling onto the first floor.

82
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,580
Rym: Imagine if there were no rails.

83
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,100
Rym: Yeah, I've been in a couple of buildings that were kind of like that and it's always a little bit not necessarily unnerving.

84
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,259
Rym: Maybe it's just because so few buildings are like that.

85
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:46,280
Rym: But also at the same time I can't really bemoan that fact because without the railings I wouldn't really blame someone for just walking off because sometimes you just stop paying attention.

86
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:54,016
Scott: Yeah, see if it didn't have the railings like I if I was alone in the mall I would be pretty confident just walking down the hallway with no railings.

87
00:06:54,056 --> 00:07:03,420
Scott: Yeah, maybe all right But there's other people there and also, you know I don't like to I don't like to have to really pay attention to not falling off.

88
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:06,019
Rym: It'd be like if you were driving without the lines on the road.

89
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:14,020
Scott: Yeah Cuz while I might not You know be stupid enough to walk off the edge and fall down to the first floor and hurt myself or possibly die.

90
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:22,362
Scott: I might slip and fall or I might bump into someone or someone that might bump into me or who knows that lady might ricochet Something.

91
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:27,460
Scott: someone might drop something like what if I drop something, you know, and I get down on my hands and knees.

92
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:33,159
Rym: It's like what if you're just walking and then your cell phone rings So you reach to grab it and in that second you just walk right off the edge?

93
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:36,009
Rym: Yeah, I can see that happening all the time.

94
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:38,738
Scott: It's it's good to have railings like that there.

95
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,790
Scott: Yeah It's good to have a fence around the top of the Empire State Building.

96
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:45,340
Rym: But yeah, anyway a little bit of news here.

97
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:54,657
Rym: this is kind of close to home because I was looking on dig for stories to bury and I saw a story involving some sort of crazy voodoo ritual.

98
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:55,279
Scott: what?

99
00:07:55,299 --> 00:08:00,560
Rym: and I would have just I wouldn't have buried it because it just looked like an interesting story.

100
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,399
Rym: But I was drawn to it because I thought I saw the word Yonkers.

101
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:18,111
Rym: So upon further investigation I see the word cemetery and I think back that whenever the sawmill Parkway floods I have to take this little detour around and right next to my work There's this big cemetery at Yonkers and I'm thinking there's no way.

102
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,154
Rym: there's no way.

103
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:26,175
Rym: and I read the story and sure enough this happened Right next to my work and it wasn't just any normal voodoo ritual.

104
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:27,660
Rym: I suppose I should start from the beginning.

105
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:40,753
Rym: so police were called because apparently there had been some suspicious people around and Then upon investigation they noticed that six of the headstones had been knocked over face down grave tipping.

106
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:48,680
Rym: now As of the time of this posting they hadn't actually looked to see whose names were on those gravestones.

107
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,619
Rym: They're gonna investigate that to try to you know, figure out who did this.

108
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:53,367
Rym: But that wouldn't have been a big deal.

109
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,080
Rym: in and of itself vandalism happens in graveyards fairly often.

110
00:08:56,705 --> 00:09:04,800
Rym: they also noticed that there was a pumpkin and Inside of the pumpkin was some animals heart covered in pepper and full of needles.

111
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:12,458
Rym: alrighty Also was were various accoutrement of some sort of voodoo or Santeria or whatever.

112
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:14,460
Rym: all those Interesting religion.

113
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:21,543
Scott: It's someone who spells You know like magic with a CK at the end and says I'm a Wicca It has a pentagram neck.

114
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:23,710
Rym: or at least someone who believes that they're a practitioner.

115
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:34,672
Rym: because actually I've read many stories recently where especially in Florida there has been a rise in Finding the evidence of those sorts of rituals as immigrants conduct them at night.

116
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:35,494
Rym: Uh-huh.

117
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:36,316
Rym: It was just.

118
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:38,683
Rym: I mean, it's not like they're harmful It's not gonna hurt you.

119
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:47,049
Rym: if you see someone hung a small piece of chicken from a tree in the middle of the woods Well, it might get you with its bad odor.

120
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:51,036
Rym: Yeah or rotting or if you're running through the woods You just kind of smack into it.

121
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:11,852
Rym: So they found a bunch of other things and I think the thing that they found that was most interesting Was and I'm quoting effectively a plastic rooster wrapped in a red bandana Buried halfway into the ground Also wrapped in some Calvin Klein underwear and pinned to.

122
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:14,099
Rym: this was a note with a person's name on it.

123
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:17,549
Scott: So do you remember that episode of Ren and Stimpy?

124
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:20,439
Scott: That was my thing of the day with the bad juju on Tuesday the 17th.

125
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,980
Scott: That the fact that that reality is crazier than that episode of Ren and Stimpy.

126
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:38,953
Rym: Wow investigators believe that they looked at well that the heart was actually outside of the pumpkin and Forensic analysis revealed that the heart was in the pumpkin and then was taken out.

127
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:44,760
Rym: and they believe that that was a ritual symbolizing ripping the victim's heart out of his body.

128
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:46,591
Scott: So the guy's a pumpkin.

129
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:59,002
Rym: I guess The funny thing is there's a reasonable chance They're gonna catch whoever's involved because they knocked down the six gravestones and they wrote the name of their victim on the thing and all This stuff.

130
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:04,360
Rym: so all they have to do is find the people who had the things done to them or the families.

131
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:13,425
Rym: Find out who's enemies of this family and then I'm sure along with the descriptions of the shady individuals who were hanging around that night I think it's gonna be funny.

132
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:15,894
Scott: I just want to see these voodoo people.

133
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:16,797
Scott: cuz voodoo people.

134
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:17,680
Scott: they gotta look funny.

135
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,763
Scott: There's no way.

136
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:23,660
Scott: there's no way that it's gonna be like some clean-cut guy and wearing like a suit and a tie.

137
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,539
Rym: It's not like the Mormons.

138
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:30,580
Scott: Yeah, it's gonna be some crazy Baron Samity type shit, and it's gonna be mighty entertaining to see voodoo people.

139
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:42,258
Rym: What if it's just an immigrant and he had a kid here and the kids just a dumb funk and he tried to do some Old ritual that he didn't know anything about and he's just some 13 year old going to high school.

140
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,247
Rym: That's our middle school or whatever.

141
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:46,151
Rym: that'd be middle school.

142
00:11:46,512 --> 00:11:47,858
Scott: That'll be kind of I don't know.

143
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,083
Rym: I don't know I could.

144
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:52,577
Rym: half of me would say these are this is people who have some sort of crazy religion.

145
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,920
Rym: half of me would Say these are punk kids who read something on to internet.

146
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,160
Scott: Yeah, yeah, you know Randy doesn't Randy sell those Randy voodoo dolls say voodoo me haha doesn't work.

147
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,787
Rym: I don't know if he's sold him, but I've seen him.

148
00:12:04,948 --> 00:12:05,309
Rym: Yeah.

149
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:07,640
Scott: He's like yeah here go voodoo me all you want.

150
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:19,351
Scott: I'm not worried about it It's not real All right, so Rym we've often talked about the fact that you know It's kind of sad that it's easy to get away with murder.

151
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,840
Rym: Yeah, it is pretty easy to get away with murder.

152
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:38,132
Rym: I mean Scott and I have conversations like this a lot and along with the front row crew where if you if Someone wanted to commit a murder and they didn't and they wanted to get away with it And they actually didn't have a motive other than getting away with it There's no way they'd be caught if they're even halfway intelligent.

153
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:38,714
Scott: Yep.

154
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:50,497
Scott: But anyway, so one thing you're gonna want to do to make sure you don't get caught if you're planning on murdering someone is To go on the Google and search for how to commit murder.

155
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,860
Scott: I Recommend actually doing the search You know so that you can get away with it and perhaps learn something about murdering.

156
00:12:57,362 --> 00:13:08,315
Scott: Well, I guess if you want to be successful, I don't know even though I don't want you to be okay anyway But make sure that you delete your search histories and perhaps.

157
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,445
Rym: Okay, so your hard drive So Google didn't give it up.

158
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:15,580
Rym: It was just whoever knotted the murder was Google didn't give it up.

159
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,410
Scott: Basically, you know, they were suspected of murder.

160
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,268
Scott: the cops came and took the computers the cops Investigated the computer and oh, let's see.

161
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:24,453
Scott: What's in this search history?

162
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:34,833
Scott: how to commit murder instant poisons undetectable poison Fatal digoxin doses Wow, huh?

163
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,480
Scott: I wonder who killed this guy.

164
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,420
Scott: Could it have been his wife who searched on Google for how to kill?

165
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,524
Rym: This is interesting because what how to kill from tank, please Kill.

166
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:46,147
Rym: see.

167
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:47,856
Rym: she should have just bought that book with cash.

168
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:48,680
Rym: She would have been all set.

169
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:50,569
Scott: Yeah, then burn the book when you're done.

170
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:52,417
Rym: actually, I don't think in tank police.

171
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:52,960
Rym: that was a book.

172
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,208
Rym: I think it was a periodical.

173
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,819
Scott: It was definitely a magazine.

174
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:07,779
Rym: Anyway, this is an interesting dichotomy because at one on one hand this woman was smart enough to use Google as opposed to any other Search engine and was smart enough to do her research.

175
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:10,287
Scott: Then she was also stupid enough to get caught.

176
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:14,420
Rym: You know what she might be smart and just not computer savvy.

177
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:26,280
Scott: Yeah, I mean even without this incredibly damning testimony that you know be of the people who investigated the computers They suspected her enough to take the computers and get a warrant to search them in the first place.

178
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,839
Scott: So she can't be that smart.

179
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:37,778
Rym: See, that's the one good thing is while it's easy to get away with murder nominally It's not nearly as easy to get away with murder where you have an actual motive.

180
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:39,645
Scott: Yeah It's like if I killed a Rym.

181
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:42,036
Scott: that's real hard to get away with.

182
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:51,760
Scott: if I killed Random guy who lives in another state while I was passing through the town on a road trip There's almost no chance of getting caught less as a camera.

183
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,960
Rym: That's why serial killers are so scary because a lot of times they don't have any connection to their victims.

184
00:14:57,341 --> 00:15:09,140
Rym: They pick them semi randomly or maybe based on you know, they want to kill blonde Asian pygmies or whatever there and they also barely leave any evidence behind or they leave a ton of evidence.

185
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,637
Rym: But because there's no lead the evidence is useless.

186
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,300
Rym: Yep I mean, all right, you got fingerprints You got DNA got a picture of the dude with his mask on.

187
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:22,939
Rym: That doesn't help you at all If you have no idea who it is have no lead at all don't even know what state to look in.

188
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:26,673
Scott: Yep, but yeah one thing you're gonna I guess.

189
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:37,229
Scott: if you don't want to get caught You should search on Google for how to do your crime better and maybe you'll find this episode That will tell you to keep your computer secure.

190
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:43,104
Scott: perhaps deban them or something, but don't do that because uh I want you to get caught.

191
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:44,810
Rym: Well, don't do it to commit murder.

192
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:46,335
Rym: do it for something good.

193
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:47,138
Scott: Yeah.

194
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:56,347
Rym: Yeah Things of the day.

195
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,254
Rym: I'm a big fan of roller coasters.

196
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:03,900
Rym: when I was in high school I was a much bigger fan of roller coasters mostly because back then I could still ride them.

197
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:05,405
Scott: We can still ride them now.

198
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:07,572
Scott: We don't even though we want to.

199
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:10,040
Rym: well because they're all very far away.

200
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:18,294
Scott: Well, I tried to get everyone to go that this past summer and we ended up not going Partly because every time we all got together we had better things to do.

201
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:19,700
Rym: that didn't require as much travel.

202
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:21,526
Scott: Yeah, I mean we could have done it.

203
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:25,400
Scott: just people didn't you know want to put in the requisite time and effort in money?

204
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:26,243
Rym: well I hate to say it.

205
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:32,570
Rym: the real issue for me is that I've been to Cedar Point and I really if I'm gonna ride roller coasters again.

206
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,416
Rym: I want to go to an equivalent park.

207
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,669
Scott: I Think it's just because you've only been to Cedar Point.

208
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:40,320
Scott: You don't realize that other places also have good rollercoaster?

209
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,565
Rym: Yeah, but they only have one or two.

210
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:49,073
Scott: Cedar Point has more roller coasters in one place than any place in the world Perhaps but other you know crappy places only have one or two like Six Flags.

211
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,060
Scott: New England has like five or six.

212
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:56,010
Scott: Oh, oh five or six have a lot Maybe even ten.

213
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,040
Scott: I don't know I haven't counted.

214
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:59,993
Scott: But yet there are other places have enough roller coaster point.

215
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:01,319
Scott: is there's rides to be worth it?

216
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:03,740
Rym: Yeah, cuz the problem is they're all kind of far away.

217
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,830
Rym: We'd have to drive a couple hours, and they'll cost a lot to get into.

218
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:09,319
Scott: that's what it cost to do those things.

219
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:13,872
Scott: Yeah, it's cheaper than Disney World Which is like hundreds of dollars to get in first.

220
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:16,765
Rym: actually if you like roller coasters There's no reason to go to Disney World.

221
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,030
Rym: as much as I like Disney World.

222
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:20,720
Rym: They they pretty much have crap for roller coasters.

223
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:22,968
Scott: Yeah, it's not a roller coaster park.

224
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:23,952
Scott: It's a theme park.

225
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:26,079
Scott: Yeah, big difference you go there for a different reason.

226
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:27,708
Rym: Yeah, I mean you go to Cedar Point.

227
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:30,040
Rym: you pretty much have to be hardcore about roller coasters.

228
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,004
Rym: You're not gonna have fun.

229
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:31,867
Rym: There's nothing else there.

230
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,352
Scott: Yeah, these are the most.

231
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:35,400
Scott: other places tend to have more of a variety.

232
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:36,616
Scott: They have other things.

233
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,914
Scott: Concentrate just on the roller coaster.

234
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:40,740
Rym: well when I was a kid.

235
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,525
Rym: That's what I was into.

236
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:43,739
Rym: I really liked roller coasters for a variety of reasons.

237
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:48,000
Rym: But anyway this I've ridden almost every kind of roller coaster.

238
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:52,860
Rym: I could go at great length about all the different kinds, and how you might think one's one kinds the other whatever.

239
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:56,878
Rym: There's a kind of roller coaster that I did not know existed until now.

240
00:17:58,062 --> 00:18:09,630
Rym: I guess you would call it a human-powered steel coaster meaning Effectively you get in these bicycle like contraptions And you ride it on a roller coaster track.

241
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:12,699
Scott: now, what if you're not strong enough to make it up the hill?

242
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,751
Rym: I Imagine that either there's a lift to get you to the top Then you only have to get up the little bits.

243
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:21,812
Rym: if I designed it I mean the website doesn't say no one answered that question for me.

244
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:28,873
Rym: if I designed it I'd make it with kind of a ratchet mechanism like you know when the roller coaster clicks going up You know what that clicking is.

245
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:33,040
Rym: in most cases It's actually little hookies going click click click click click.

246
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:38,418
Rym: So if the chain breaks or they lose power or whatever instead of falling back down it just sits there.

247
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:40,044
Rym: Yep That's what that is.

248
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:41,852
Rym: I would put the same thing on this.

249
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:46,038
Rym: so if you get tired going up the hill You just stop as opposed to falling to your death.

250
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,529
Scott: ah That's a good idea, but what if you like?

251
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,038
Scott: what if one person is really you know unfit?

252
00:18:53,141 --> 00:18:54,668
Scott: And they take forever to get up the hill?

253
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:57,460
Scott: they're blocking the person behind them and that could ruin your ride.

254
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,100
Rym: I also imagine that they have contingencies in place or maybe because it's Japan.

255
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,312
Rym: They just don't let fatter unfit people on.

256
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,620
Scott: oh, it's Japan all right.

257
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:08,340
Rym: Yeah, it's actually at a washes on high land park in okayama.

258
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:13,840
Rym: Uh-huh, and the thing is most roller coaster parks are built in flat open land.

259
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:18,440
Rym: This thing is built like on the side of a mountain and this roller coaster just on this mountain.

260
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:26,534
Scott: Maybe it's easier to build then because you can use the mountain as the support for the higher parts of the roller coaster And that's you have to build less supporting poles.

261
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:26,695
Rym: Well.

262
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:27,540
Rym: They did that in Vegas.

263
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:32,851
Rym: They built a roller coaster whose hill was on top of a big building Yeah, which was kind of cool.

264
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:37,252
Rym: the roller coaster was kind of crap But that was just the fault of the roller coaster design not the idea.

265
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:39,440
Rym: yep, but check out these pictures this thing.

266
00:19:40,002 --> 00:19:44,680
Rym: It's very difficult to frighten me or to a nerve me or anything all right any amusement park ride.

267
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:49,780
Rym: I once rode a ride that is banned in every state of the Union except Michigan and Kentucky.

268
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,623
Scott: What ride is that?

269
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:54,899
Rym: it's this carney ride that basically you spin around in a big?

270
00:19:55,261 --> 00:20:02,729
Rym: Circle and inside of the circle there are four pods and the pods spin around Independently and the ride is not controlled by a computer.

271
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:17,716
Rym: the ride is controlled manually by a carney with three big levers Uh-huh, and he has to manually Spin all the different bits and move it around and time it and if he does it wrong the ride can generate enough force To actually crush you.

272
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:20,027
Scott: You ever ride the roundup.

273
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:21,111
Rym: I don't know.

274
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:23,740
Rym: I know I don't know much about carney rides.

275
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,167
Rym: I only know a lot about roller coasters.

276
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,137
Scott: Oh, I think I found the roundup.

277
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,062
Scott: yep here It is.

278
00:20:28,142 --> 00:20:29,187
Scott: I found a picture of it on.

279
00:20:29,307 --> 00:20:31,015
Rym: is the round up worse than chaos.

280
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:32,100
Scott: This is the roundup.

281
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:34,193
Rym: Oh, I've been on those.

282
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,060
Rym: you base are awesome.

283
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,261
Scott: You're.

284
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:45,057
Scott: basically there's a big ring and the ring has around the edge of it a fence And you stand up against the fence in his little booth.

285
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:49,974
Scott: It's a centrifuge Yeah, and you hold on to it, and it spins around and then it drops out.

286
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:54,752
Scott: no and then it goes up Goes around and up hence the roundup.

287
00:20:55,133 --> 00:21:00,440
Rym: well when I went to space camp One thing that had there was the same kind of deal only didn't go up.

288
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,515
Rym: It just went around in a circle and the floor drops away, and you just kind of get.

289
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:05,780
Rym: sit there stuck against the wall.

290
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:11,420
Rym: Well while we were riding at the guy running it says well you kids keep quiet if I do something awesome.

291
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:16,400
Rym: And we all said yes, and he proceeded to because he was in the control booth area in the center.

292
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:19,282
Rym: That doesn't spin or like it spins But at a different rate.

293
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:27,779
Rym: he got up and he jumped over to where we were and stood straight up totally horizontal and ran around The centrifuge jumping over all of us kids.

294
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:29,847
Scott: Those are good right good time.

295
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:31,111
Rym: and then he pulled out.

296
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:42,759
Rym: he had a can of beer with him and all this other stuff And he's tossed it around with the other guy doing all these tricks and awesome stuff And then he warns us again not to say anything And then he gets back in the center slows the thing down and lets us all get off.

297
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:45,088
Scott: So a human powered roller coaster.

298
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:47,035
Scott: you say human powered roller.

299
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:48,340
Scott: it might be crazy enough to work.

300
00:21:48,902 --> 00:21:52,696
Rym: I particularly like the third right-hand corner of fear or whatever.

301
00:21:52,716 --> 00:21:53,840
Rym: they call this one corner.

302
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,969
Scott: Do they really call it the third corner of fear?

303
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:57,254
Rym: they call it something like that.

304
00:21:57,495 --> 00:21:58,720
Scott: Do you pass out in that corner?

305
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,431
Rym: Pori katani, okay, couldn't deal with this.

306
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:05,223
Scott: I wonder how many people got that initial D Joke, and how many didn't.

307
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:09,779
Rym: well it's Thursday, so only the coolest of cool people listen to Thursday, okay?

308
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,915
Scott: Anyway, so flicker is obviously the photo album of the 21st century.

309
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:20,020
Scott: if you don't know about flicker Have you been living under a rock or what?

310
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,978
Rym: It's one of those drop the e to talk about the way twit classifies websites.

311
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:42,755
Scott: well You know I don't often usually think about flicker in terms of me putting my photos somewhere so that they can be downloaded a lot without losing bandwidth to me or without costing me a lot of money, and I never really think to go and say I wonder who what really cool people are on flicker like.

312
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:48,737
Scott: imagine if someone was like I don't know like my mom's cousin who's a geologist, and she goes to volcanoes and stuff.

313
00:22:48,757 --> 00:22:50,699
Scott: if she had a flicker That'd be pretty damn cool.

314
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:54,851
Scott: Well, you know it'd be even cooler, and it actually exists.

315
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:58,180
Scott: the Los Angeles fire department has a flicker.

316
00:22:59,423 --> 00:23:01,220
Rym: I like I like firemen pictures.

317
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:13,219
Scott: It's really awesome because you have pictures like the pictures that are the newest are of the Los Angeles Marathon of 2007 and all the people who like passed out, and they're wheeling them away on wheelchairs and stuff.

318
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:21,485
Scott: and Then they got slightly less recent pictures of them putting out a brush fire in some park with Helicopters carrying water.

319
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:27,588
Scott: and then they got pictures of some lady who drove a car into a swimming pool And this car is at the bottom of a swimming pool.

320
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:37,740
Scott: and basically any time the Los Angeles fire department sees something crazy There must be someone there who's taking these really good pictures and putting them up in this.

321
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:42,882
Scott: I'm pretty sure official Los Angeles fire department flicker And it's.

322
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:46,759
Scott: it's pretty the photos are really high quality, and it looks official to me.

323
00:23:47,522 --> 00:23:56,968
Rym: Well my dad is actually I mean he's high up in the Detroit fire department one of the top dogs And when I was a kid I remember whenever we went for walks He he had the nose for cuz.

324
00:23:57,008 --> 00:23:59,800
Rym: actually you'd be surprised how many house fires there are in Detroit.

325
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:10,419
Rym: But if he smelled a fire we track it down, and it may sound weird But a pastime of my family was watching houses burn as firemen tried to save them.

326
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:12,940
Rym: Hey, he'd also listen to the scanner.

327
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,460
Rym: We drive out and watch fires fairly often more often than you'd think would be prudent or expected.

328
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:26,270
Scott: Well you can relive that by looking at this flicker account because there's a lot of fires and a lot of car wrecks And a lot of firemen putting them out.

329
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:27,920
Rym: I do like pictures of fire a lot.

330
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:35,079
Rym: I mean I remember the the calendar my dad gave me when he was this internal fire department calendar And it was just pictures of houses on fire.

331
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:38,519
Scott: Here's a car upside down next to a fire truck.

332
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,692
Scott: They're cutting down a tree with a chainsaw.

333
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,220
Rym: they got any of them using the jaws of life.

334
00:24:45,661 --> 00:24:47,609
Scott: I'm sure there are jaws of life pictures.

335
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:48,994
Rym: I like the jaws of life a lot.

336
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:49,857
Scott: I also like the up.

337
00:24:49,938 --> 00:24:56,140
Scott: Here's like Like la fire department command staff salutes chief bamatter.

338
00:24:57,521 --> 00:24:59,914
Scott: Okay, fire chief and first lady of the fire department.

339
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:01,100
Scott: Oh, there's some sort of ceremony.

340
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,319
Scott: They're all wearing their firemen uniforms of fanciness, huh?

341
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,285
Scott: There's all kinds of good pictures in here.

342
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:07,530
Scott: if you like fire.

343
00:25:08,072 --> 00:25:08,895
Scott: You like firemen.

344
00:25:08,915 --> 00:25:10,180
Scott: This is a good flicker.

345
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,149
Scott: If you look at it, there's a lot of pictures.

346
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:14,640
Rym: I don't think there's anyone who dislikes a well-oiled fireman.

347
00:25:15,123 --> 00:25:19,062
Scott: There's 54 pages of pictures here Up.

348
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:24,160
Scott: the very first picture is the official seal of the LA fire department and the second picture is the US flag.

349
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:33,140
Rym: So we were downstairs with Alex and Emily eating tacos that I'd made And we were trying to come up with a show to do tonight as we seem to be doing lately.

350
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:35,159
Rym: We're not really planning ahead these last few weeks.

351
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:37,505
Scott: No, no planning ahead at all.

352
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,993
Scott: We should plan ahead next week this weekend.

353
00:25:40,635 --> 00:25:41,217
Rym: I will see.

354
00:25:41,237 --> 00:25:44,632
Rym: luckily It looks like all of our plans to go out of town have followed through.

355
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:46,100
Scott: We'll see what happens.

356
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:49,559
Scott: I got stuff to do no matter what happens So it doesn't matter to me.

357
00:25:50,021 --> 00:25:58,239
Rym: but we realized that pretty much the best resource we have to figure out what to do Thursday shows on is Other people who are in our house.

358
00:25:58,822 --> 00:26:05,036
Scott: Of course usually when we ask people what to do the show on they come up with the same ideas we have or they come Up with no good ideas and it's not very helpful.

359
00:26:05,238 --> 00:26:08,937
Rym: tonight We got a bunch of good ideas and probably the best one at least the easiest one to do.

360
00:26:08,978 --> 00:26:14,080
Rym: right now We're gonna talk a bit about family vacations and vacationing and travel and all that.

361
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,286
Scott: Well, it is spring break.

362
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,160
Scott: I think for a lot of people if now if not soon.

363
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,728
Scott: So vacations are pretty relevant topic in that regard.

364
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:33,989
Rym: Yeah, plus it it's kind of interesting how my life as a geek well first as a as a child and then as a geek child and now as and then as a college geek and now as a full-grown geek how Vacationing always has these different connotations.

365
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:37,360
Rym: and it's changed as to what I consider a vacation as time has gone on.

366
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:48,503
Rym: Mmm, I mean it went from the family vacations You know driving in a van with the whole family including grandma down to Florida and back and then you know to college where we didn't Have any money.

367
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:52,359
Rym: so vacations were like go to a con and not have food to eat.

368
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,559
Scott: Vacation was sit in the apartment and I'd have to do schoolwork.

369
00:26:55,901 --> 00:26:58,451
Rym: I got to admit those are still some of the best vacations I've ever had.

370
00:26:58,692 --> 00:27:01,924
Scott: those were some damn good vacations that summer We spent at RIT.

371
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:06,340
Rym: not going to RIT was probably one of the best summers of my life.

372
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,905
Scott: It's definitely one of the best summers.

373
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:08,808
Scott: I cannot deny.

374
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:13,985
Scott: and then now we have money again sitting around playing putt-putt DDR listening to euro beat.

375
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:14,988
Scott: good times.

376
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:17,035
Rym: Yeah, I'd work at de Bella's play order.

377
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:21,919
Rym: You go five times a day Randomly driving to the beach or trying to play badminton with Luke.

378
00:27:23,222 --> 00:27:24,827
Rym: Those were good days one time.

379
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:25,449
Scott: We tried that.

380
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,256
Rym: No, we tried to play badminton twice.

381
00:27:27,557 --> 00:27:28,018
Scott: We did we?

382
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:28,500
Rym: we did.

383
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:30,500
Rym: We didn't succeed in playing the second time.

384
00:27:30,742 --> 00:27:33,100
Rym: We couldn't find all the bits cuz we lost something on the net.

385
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:36,071
Scott: I actually saw a really good badminton video on the internet.

386
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:40,871
Rym: So I'll find it uses thingy today next week, man I was really good at badminton when I was a young kid.

387
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:41,574
Scott: I was also.

388
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:43,020
Scott: I'm probably still really good at bad.

389
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,024
Rym: I'm terrible at it now.

390
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:47,820
Scott: I mean, I'm not good like I could play professionally or a competition.

391
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,412
Rym: No, you ever see my professional badminton thing.

392
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:51,075
Scott: Well, that's the thing.

393
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:52,120
Scott: I was gonna use the thing of the day.

394
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:53,347
Scott: so of course, I've seen it.

395
00:27:53,428 --> 00:28:00,839
Scott: but I'm better than Most at people at badminton because I actually tried to play it a lot.

396
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,474
Scott: Nah, I'm also okay at volleyball a little bit.

397
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:05,056
Rym: I'm.

398
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:06,080
Rym: it's surprising.

399
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:13,132
Rym: I'm better at volleyball than you'd expect but yet at the same time I often will fail Spectacularly at the critical moment in volleyball.

400
00:28:13,252 --> 00:28:13,675
Scott: That's pretty.

401
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:14,540
Scott: I'm equal in skill.

402
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,246
Rym: I think I can serve really well.

403
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:27,540
Rym: really what like people were making fun of me at IBM and the volleyball team where this Intramural thing going because I was generally useless and I could set up for a spike Kinda, but half the time I'd send it off in the middle of nowhere.

404
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:31,714
Scott: See spiking is the only like real deficiency I have in volleyball.

405
00:28:31,754 --> 00:28:34,484
Scott: just as I can't jump high enough He's spiking I could do.

406
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:35,367
Rym: I couldn't set up.

407
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,614
Rym: I couldn't return a normal volley.

408
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,220
Rym: All I could do was spike.

409
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:41,159
Scott: Do you know the technique kinda?

410
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:42,705
Rym: People taught me.

411
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:44,254
Rym: Yeah, I just I wasn't good at.

412
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:45,079
Rym: I always screwed it up.

413
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:46,480
Scott: Yeah, don't screw up.

414
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:51,036
Rym: But here's the thing I would surprise everyone cuz the one thing I could do really well is serve.

415
00:28:51,237 --> 00:28:52,160
Scott: So everything's not hard.

416
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,109
Rym: Well, no, I could do the jump overhand serve.

417
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,160
Rym: that came in like a bomb and no one ever returned it.

418
00:28:56,381 --> 00:28:57,209
Scott: I do that too.

419
00:28:57,229 --> 00:28:57,612
Scott: Yeah.

420
00:28:58,137 --> 00:28:59,780
Scott: Yeah It's not difficult.

421
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,840
Rym: So I'd get like eight points for my team and then I'd spend need like the rest of the match until I was losing ten points.

422
00:29:06,281 --> 00:29:06,984
Rym: Yes, pretty much.

423
00:29:07,004 --> 00:29:07,788
Scott: Yeah, good job.

424
00:29:07,868 --> 00:29:09,173
Rym: So as a result, I was useless.

425
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:10,740
Scott: You're the MVP of the other team.

426
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:11,263
Rym: Oh, yeah.

427
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:11,847
Rym: All right.

428
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,583
Rym: But anyway, yeah, so Vacations.

429
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:17,533
Rym: now we're cons and Wildwood and all that.

430
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:18,235
Rym: now that we have money.

431
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:22,716
Rym: We're actually considering doing Vacations again actually planning to go somewhere.

432
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:23,380
Scott: I want to go.

433
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:33,171
Scott: I think what I want to do is I want to go far away Because most of the time when I was vacationing as a kid I mean we never left the East Coast pretty much.

434
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:37,660
Scott: I've never been west of Michigan in Ohio I've never been west of Chicago.

435
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:44,300
Rym: Maybe I mean I've been as far west as Chicago in the north and I've been as far west as parts of Tennessee in the South.

436
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:52,150
Scott: I've been as far south as Florida and as far north as Canada Ontario and I've been as far east as Israel.

437
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:55,983
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of crazy and backwards Yep.

438
00:29:56,204 --> 00:30:06,920
Rym: Well, I mean as a young kid every year our family always went on two vacations And one of the vacations was always to Cedar Point for a weekend Mm-hmm or sometimes just a day depending on finances and time or whatever.

439
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:17,810
Rym: But I went to Cedar Point every single year of my life and when I was two years old My parents brought me along until I moved away to RIT and I haven't been back since See pretty much every year.

440
00:30:17,871 --> 00:30:20,303
Scott: My family would go on a Most years.

441
00:30:20,864 --> 00:30:22,609
Scott: my family would go on a real vacation.

442
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:29,509
Scott: That was about a week long maybe longer to somewhere often It was a New Hampshire or Florida.

443
00:30:30,051 --> 00:30:33,140
Scott: once I think we went to Lake George with some cousins and had a little cottage.

444
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,083
Scott: that was a fun time.

445
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:44,113
Scott: a lot of a lot of has silly memories for that one power outages and as Result water outages and hilarity my brother stealing M&Ms.

446
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:46,320
Scott: Yeah, a lot of good anecdotes on that one.

447
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:53,267
Scott: But you know also I think probably more than once every year we would go on like a day trip somewhere like oh Let's go to museum.

448
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:56,969
Scott: Let's go somewhere else That's you know, and we just do stuff.

449
00:30:57,271 --> 00:30:58,396
Rym: we did a lot of things like that.

450
00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:01,146
Rym: that just seems All families do that.

451
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,793
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't really count as vacation.

452
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:06,379
Scott: But yeah for real vacation We would do it like once a year go somewhere.

453
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:10,808
Rym: See we always had the Cedar Point vacation Which was like the family ritual it came down to.

454
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,400
Rym: they'd always pack up the back of the station wagon in bed.

455
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,380
Rym: So me and my little brother could lay there playing our little games our game gear Gameboy or whatever for the two-hour drive.

456
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:25,413
Rym: It's amazing how when I was a young kid a two-hour drive was this eternity.

457
00:31:25,994 --> 00:31:31,436
Rym: and if I wasn't entertained at every moment along The way I would be so crushingly bored that I just couldn't stand it.

458
00:31:31,576 --> 00:31:34,084
Scott: That is true I agree entirely.

459
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:35,810
Scott: and now a two-hour drive is nothing.

460
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,054
Rym: I know a two-hour drive.

461
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,688
Rym: That's not this less than a day trip That's the normal course of business.

462
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:42,395
Scott: Yeah, I remember driving to New Hampshire.

463
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:47,720
Scott: if I look at a map now It's only like four or five hours to get there to you know to the place you went to vacation there.

464
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:49,145
Rym: But you remember it being this.

465
00:31:49,185 --> 00:31:53,380
Scott: but I remember it being this incredibly long boring drive.

466
00:31:53,742 --> 00:31:55,936
Scott: But now I could drive there if I wanted to.

467
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:56,640
Scott: it's not a big deal.

468
00:31:56,841 --> 00:31:59,675
Rym: I think part of it to take the adult position here.

469
00:32:00,057 --> 00:32:03,300
Rym: when you're a kid You don't have as many memories as an adult.

470
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:08,240
Rym: You don't need to spend as much time in reverie or thinking about your past or recalling things or relaxing.

471
00:32:08,902 --> 00:32:13,760
Rym: You were trying to do as much as you can in as little time as possible with spastic kid energy.

472
00:32:14,363 --> 00:32:15,226
Scott: I don't know what it is.

473
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:16,392
Rym: But now I'm older.

474
00:32:16,552 --> 00:32:18,119
Scott: array for portable video games.

475
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:30,560
Rym: Yes but aside from that the big vacation my family went on is we drove down to Tennessee a bunch of times or we went down to West Virginia for the Jeep jamboree so my mom could fiddle around with off-roading and jeeps and all that fun stuff.

476
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:32,334
Rym: Went on a lot of camping trips.

477
00:32:32,758 --> 00:32:39,720
Rym: one time we took my grandparents giant conversion van and drove down to Florida and back for Disney World and a whole bunch of stuff.

478
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:47,446
Rym: I remember going to the Cape Canaveral Space Museum and Space Camp and Huntsville and all sorts of just you know Typical family vacations.

479
00:32:47,868 --> 00:32:50,940
Scott: Yeah, we did the same shit most of the time we want a vacation.

480
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,885
Scott: I don't remember a single vacation.

481
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:55,352
Scott: we went on where there weren't video arcades involved.

482
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:56,294
Scott: It was pretty much.

483
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:57,898
Scott: Hey, let's go play video games.

484
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:04,960
Rym: Yeah Actually, I was spoiled with arcades cuz cedar point has one of the biggest old-school arcades out there.

485
00:33:05,462 --> 00:33:06,789
Scott: You haven't been to sesame place.

486
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:07,814
Rym: Oh, it's not the biggest.

487
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:08,538
Rym: I can't pretend.

488
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:08,980
Rym: It's the biggest.

489
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:17,340
Scott: The place we went to in New Hampshire Was the fun spot is there which is pretty much the arcade of the country perhaps of the world?

490
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,249
Scott: We went there because fun spot was there.

491
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:23,320
Scott: my parents pretty much like gave up on going to places.

492
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,631
Scott: You know that happened to have an arcade and we went to the.

493
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:29,080
Scott: we went on vacation to the arcade.

494
00:33:29,221 --> 00:33:31,550
Scott: That was also a lake so my mom was happy.

495
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:33,760
Scott: there was a lake and there were restaurants and touristy crap.

496
00:33:34,202 --> 00:33:37,678
Scott: But we would spend a lot of time playing mini golf and video games.

497
00:33:37,939 --> 00:33:42,880
Rym: yep I remember one time when we were at Cedar Point, and it was stupidly hot out in the middle of a heatwave.

498
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:46,430
Rym: It was over a hundred degrees So we had to get out of the heat for a little bit.

499
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:52,780
Rym: we weren't gonna stand in line for an hour and die Even though not too long after that they put in these misters, which are actually really cool.

500
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,676
Rym: They misted you in line with a big fan and water, so you didn't get hot.

501
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,200
Scott: sounds good to me Yeah But anyway.

502
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:10,431
Rym: So we went into this arcade the giant arcade at Cedar Point and me my little brother my mom and two other kids Rotated in and out on a Simpsons arcade machine until we beat it.

503
00:34:10,954 --> 00:34:12,158
Scott: Yeah, Simpsons arcade.

504
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:14,172
Rym: Yep It was a dumb game, but you know what?

505
00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:17,275
Rym: for some reason It's just the vibe of playing it with a bunch of people.

506
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:17,840
Rym: it can't be beat.

507
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:23,840
Scott: Yeah, all those all those games that ran on the same system Ninja Turtles X-men and Simpsons.

508
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:25,024
Scott: I'm sure there were others.

509
00:34:25,406 --> 00:34:27,754
Scott: the dungeon dragons is similar, but not quite the same.

510
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:29,440
Scott: better definitely better.

511
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:37,620
Scott: I don't think it's better, but the the Cooperative four or more player beat-em-up arcade games definitely need to see a comeback.

512
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:40,609
Rym: Well in general any sort of cooperative gameplay.

513
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:43,378
Rym: I want this more and more and I'm lacking it more and more.

514
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:45,484
Rym: yeah I mean we ghettoize.

515
00:34:45,505 --> 00:34:50,320
Rym: it will play Advance Wars against the AI and teams or things like that, but it's not the same.

516
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:56,011
Scott: No, it's not the same at all Alright, so I remember I never really thought about.

517
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:58,860
Rym: I mean I just assumed every area summertime time for the vacations.

518
00:34:58,961 --> 00:35:00,006
Rym: They're always over the summer.

519
00:35:00,368 --> 00:35:02,036
Scott: No they weren't always over the summer with us.

520
00:35:02,076 --> 00:35:08,959
Scott: like sometimes we would go on a vacation in the winter you know to go to Florida and Sometimes you go vacation in the summer.

521
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,499
Scott: Sometimes you go vacation in the spring.

522
00:35:12,281 --> 00:35:23,680
Scott: Actually, I think most of the vacations were in the spring or the winter vacation You know from school because in the summer we typically went to summer camps and other things and thus it wasn't vacation vacation time.

523
00:35:24,023 --> 00:35:31,220
Rym: Yeah, I mean I remember the first trip I went on like major trip by myself was flying down to Florida for the citrus bowl with the band.

524
00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:39,800
Rym: But I wouldn't really call that a vacation because while I spend time on the beach in a Disney World and all that I also spent a lot of time working because it was a band outing.

525
00:35:40,403 --> 00:35:41,891
Scott: When I went on vacation my family.

526
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:48,558
Scott: if we went to an amusement park It was all is probably one in Florida like a Disney World or Universal Studios or something like that.

527
00:35:49,121 --> 00:35:53,271
Scott: Most of the time we went to normal Amusement parks like Six Flags.

528
00:35:53,793 --> 00:35:55,260
Scott: it was never with my family.

529
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:07,980
Scott: It was always with summer camp or with school or with some other you know group that didn't involve my Blood relatives see that wasn't until I had a car and then because I guess I didn't go to camps or anything.

530
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:17,579
Rym: But I remember once I had a car and I realized that wait a minute I can go to Cedar Point or the beach or whatever anytime I want.

531
00:36:18,463 --> 00:36:21,897
Rym: My junior year of high school, I went to Cedar Point like 12 times.

532
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:37,304
Scott: Yeah, basically if you went to school in Connecticut or at least where we went to school It was pretty much a close to 100% guarantee that your school was gonna take you on some vacation Somewhere if you paid.

533
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:39,332
Scott: and you know, what's funny side of the permission slip?

534
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:47,380
Rym: all the schools in southeast, Michigan Every single one of them at least all the public schools all the trips other than you know field trips and everything in the summer.

535
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,469
Rym: We're always to Cedar Point and nowhere else.

536
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:54,440
Scott: Yeah, they typically always took us to Riverside But which is became Six Flags New England.

537
00:36:54,701 --> 00:37:04,580
Scott: They also would take kids to Boston and when you're at elementary school in Connecticut They will take you to the freakin mystic aquarium and mystic village like a thousand times.

538
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:06,548
Scott: You will get so sick of going to mystic.

539
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:07,793
Scott: You'll just want to kill yourself.

540
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,668
Rym: Oh, no, there is one other place We always went to always there.

541
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:14,800
Rym: I forget what it was called, but there was this historical reenactment village.

542
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:15,992
Scott: Oh, yeah Sturbridge Village.

543
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:16,679
Scott: you would go there too.

544
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:26,819
Rym: Yeah I forget what ours was called but we'd have to live there like the pioneers for a whole day and it was this Competition and at the end the judges based on what you had done would decide whether or not you lived.

545
00:37:27,222 --> 00:37:28,106
Scott: Oh, it wasn't like that.

546
00:37:28,227 --> 00:37:30,580
Rym: But I remember bartering with the Indians.

547
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:37,980
Rym: I end up giving the Indians guns so we could get food and then the Indians used the guns to raid the village and took The food back and then we all died.

548
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:39,845
Rym: Yeah, it was awesome.

549
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:40,849
Scott: That sounds more awesome.

550
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:41,230
Scott: what we had?

551
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,720
Scott: we typically cuz it's all colonial up in New England.

552
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:48,800
Scott: Yeah, so everything it tends to just be like you go to Sturbridge village.

553
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:54,879
Scott: It's a village and like you'll go into say the Baker and they're actually just selling cookies in there.

554
00:37:55,342 --> 00:38:01,995
Scott: But the lady's dressed up like a colonial lady and she's you know teaches you about colonial baking and tries to sell you cookies.

555
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:04,565
Scott: and then you go into like another building and like.

556
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:08,498
Scott: this is what schools were like in the when it was colonial times.

557
00:38:08,598 --> 00:38:17,794
Rym: and But for the mess blacksmith day to skip a bit for the last several years Vacations for us at least for Scott and me and the rest of the front row crew.

558
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:24,956
Rym: front row crew have basically become Going to Wildwood for a week after Otakon because conventions are not vacations for us.

559
00:38:24,976 --> 00:38:25,478
Rym: their work.

560
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:26,260
Rym: They're fun.

561
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,047
Scott: Well their work now they used to not be work.

562
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:31,479
Rym: Yeah, but if they weren't work, I don't know how many I would go to.

563
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:32,547
Scott: That's true.

564
00:38:32,748 --> 00:38:38,680
Scott: I mean once you've been to some It like there's not much for us to do outside of work at conventions any.

565
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,900
Rym: Yeah, I mean I would go to Otakon or I'd pick one or two conventions and go to them every year no matter what.

566
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,578
Rym: But I wouldn't go to 10 or 20 conventions a year like I do now.

567
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:50,536
Scott: No that pretty much if I wasn't doing anything conventions other than being an attendee.

568
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:54,288
Scott: at this point I'd pretty much only go to Otakon.

569
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:01,850
Rym: Yeah, but it seems like there's a definite distinction between Vacations for relaxing and vacations for doing.

570
00:39:02,492 --> 00:39:04,640
Scott: well if you're doing is it really a vacation?

571
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:05,383
Rym: I don't know.

572
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:12,344
Rym: I mean a lot of people seem to look at vacation as time away from their mundane work life Enjoying themselves somewhere Mmm.

573
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:15,760
Rym: I mean I've gone on some vacations where I did stuff the whole time.

574
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:24,216
Rym: I crammed as much as I could in and I've been on vacations Particularly that half a month or so where we lived in Wildwood where I didn't do anything.

575
00:39:24,276 --> 00:39:27,936
Rym: I just laid on the beach and That's what we've been doing a lot lately.

576
00:39:27,976 --> 00:39:32,239
Rym: every year It's like we do Otakon the big trip, and then we just lay on the beach for a week.

577
00:39:32,802 --> 00:39:34,270
Scott: I think that's the way it's got to be.

578
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:38,248
Scott: if we didn't land a beach for a week after Otakon We would be DED yep.

579
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,052
Rym: Well remember.

580
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:40,940
Rym: We couldn't talk for about three days.

581
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:43,528
Scott: It's true the most recent one.

582
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:48,597
Rym: Yeah, I'm not looking forward to what's gonna happen at this Otakon Especially if they let us do all the stuff we've proposed to do.

583
00:39:48,617 --> 00:39:54,537
Scott: yeah You know actually I think there's a kind of vacation that we haven't really gone on at least yet is business trips.

584
00:39:54,617 --> 00:39:59,276
Scott: like my dad Goes to a lot of places on business like to do business.

585
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:00,120
Scott: I want that work.

586
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:09,440
Scott: I've done that for IBM several times Yeah, but you've never gone on like a business trip to say Ireland or California or actually South America.

587
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:14,120
Rym: I probably could have if I'd stuck around IBM longer because we did do a lot of work with some people in Dublin.

588
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,564
Scott: Oh, that's good.

589
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:20,880
Rym: Yeah, in fact a guy from there came to our department a bunch of times to do business trips.

590
00:40:21,442 --> 00:40:21,904
Scott: That's cool.

591
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:25,940
Rym: all I remember is that because IBM paid for it he got a rental car.

592
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:27,520
Rym: That's the only way to get around in America.

593
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:39,878
Rym: He got a sports car and I remember one day I was walking out of the office And I'm ready to go home and I see him getting into his little sports car that he's rented and he tore out of that Parking lot at over a hundred miles an hour.

594
00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:42,713
Rym: He was enjoying that.

595
00:40:42,794 --> 00:40:46,860
Scott: I definitely Eventually wanna if I have to keep working for a long time.

596
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:50,015
Scott: I want to have a job where there's some sort of business trips going on.

597
00:40:50,276 --> 00:40:52,466
Rym: a lot of jobs I've looked at but didn't apply to.

598
00:40:52,526 --> 00:41:08,599
Rym: they always say, you know a percentage of travel like this job involves 40% Travel or 20% travel and they always present it like it's a bad thing Like somehow that's gonna be some sort of detriment that I'm gonna have to go into Interesting places as opposed to just sitting in a cube all day.

599
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:11,391
Scott: I think the problem is a lot of business travelers.

600
00:41:11,892 --> 00:41:16,600
Scott: when they travel, you know A lot of people are just too serious about their work.

601
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,209
Scott: They go somewhere they do their work.

602
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,340
Scott: Maybe they're the kind of people who are afraid of being someplace new.

603
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:33,418
Scott: You know that the traveling itself actually not always pleasant, you know, not everyone likes to fly on planes Yeah, but you always get to fly business class yeah, but that's not always that exciting trust me.

604
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:36,712
Scott: and You know you're tired when you get there.

605
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:38,079
Scott: you have business to do.

606
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:43,780
Scott: You don't get a whole lot of time to hang out and do what you want because they make you come back pretty quickly.

607
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:46,693
Rym: Well the same time a lot of people do business traveling.

608
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:50,277
Rym: they spend a lot of time doing nothing the whole evening in the hotel, what are you gonna do?

609
00:41:50,297 --> 00:42:02,830
Rym: and That's not a problem for people like us because we have things like Ds's and the internet so we can enjoy ourselves no matter where we are We can always do something if nothing else.

610
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:07,900
Rym: if I had to go on a two-week business trip I could catch up on all my reading and I could catch up on all my video games.

611
00:42:08,461 --> 00:42:15,519
Scott: Yeah, I mean that is one thing is that I think a lot of business travelers might not make the most of their time in other places.

612
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:22,498
Scott: But I could also see that it'd be upsetting if you were someone who tried to make the most of your time and you didn't Get enough time out there.

613
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:23,604
Rym: Well what you do?

614
00:42:23,885 --> 00:42:27,480
Rym: I know a lot of people do this like say you got a business trip to I don't know Japan.

615
00:42:28,002 --> 00:42:29,227
Rym: So and the business trip is a week.

616
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,999
Rym: take a week's vacation right after it.

617
00:42:32,441 --> 00:42:35,679
Rym: Stay in Japan on your own dime for the rest of the week and enjoy it.

618
00:42:36,122 --> 00:42:37,519
Scott: Yeah, you could try and go for that.

619
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:39,242
Scott: It's not always easy You know.

620
00:42:39,342 --> 00:42:41,492
Scott: but and plus you have to you got.

621
00:42:41,773 --> 00:42:47,139
Scott: usually when you spend your vacation days You're planning that well in advance and business trips seem to sort of come up.

622
00:42:47,522 --> 00:42:48,147
Rym: No, they don't.

623
00:42:48,187 --> 00:42:49,580
Rym: only if it worked for a weird company.

624
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,416
Scott: Yeah, I don't think they would tell you about your trip somewhere else like a year in advance.

625
00:42:55,957 --> 00:43:00,559
Rym: I have most business trips I've known generally when I'd be going months and months and months ahead of time.

626
00:43:01,402 --> 00:43:01,924
Scott: That's not bad.

627
00:43:02,225 --> 00:43:06,480
Rym: granted all my business trips were two super lame places, but I'm not gonna get into that.

628
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,234
Scott: I guess we just won't know enough about business trips until we go on some.

629
00:43:10,435 --> 00:43:10,696
Scott: though.

630
00:43:10,816 --> 00:43:21,240
Rym: whenever hotels I mean whenever we get hotels for Otakana Katsucon, and you know the hotel always has business or pleasure I always say business because I'm doing more business than I have anything else.

631
00:43:22,443 --> 00:43:23,110
Scott: It's a funny one.

632
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:28,200
Rym: Yeah But honestly we're and we're gonna see who else wants to go in on us.

633
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,256
Rym: But probably next summer we're thinking of actually going on a trip to overseas somewhere.

634
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,000
Rym: We're not sure where.

635
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,206
Rym: yeah We got a lot of vague ideas.

636
00:43:34,689 --> 00:43:36,680
Rym: I guess this isn't a contest or anything.

637
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,109
Rym: But where do you guys think we should go?

638
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,619
Rym: where should Rym and Scott spend a week?

639
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:47,908
Scott: Yeah, I think my ideas are pretty much to go see ancient shit like go to Greece Go to Rome and go to South America.

640
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:50,736
Scott: Yep anywhere where there's ancient stuffs.

641
00:43:51,197 --> 00:43:52,120
Scott: I want to see old shit.

642
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,473
Rym: I mean not to say that I don't want to go everywhere.

643
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:59,020
Scott: I mean I'd love to spend time in Ireland If I had a plane I would just fly around the world and see everything.

644
00:43:59,442 --> 00:44:02,980
Rym: But I mean really we're thinking Italy Greece and somewhere along the Mediterranean.

645
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,030
Rym: I kind of want to go to Turkey.

646
00:44:05,412 --> 00:44:06,236
Scott: Turkey is not so bad.

647
00:44:06,256 --> 00:44:06,597
Scott: I'll go.

648
00:44:06,618 --> 00:44:07,120
Scott: something's warm.

649
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:11,000
Scott: No warm is good, so the Alps are out.

650
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:12,742
Scott: So it's Everest.

651
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:15,089
Rym: Everest can wait didn't you want to climb Mount Everest?

652
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:16,151
Scott: I do, but it's cold.

653
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:17,254
Scott: I?

654
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:23,079
Scott: Want to go up there because I didn't realize that you could see space from up there.

655
00:44:23,723 --> 00:44:29,839
Scott: But I also don't want to go because it's hard and it's cold Yeah, and a lot of people die and a lot of you will die and they just leave you there.

656
00:44:30,286 --> 00:44:41,440
Rym: Yeah plus I mean think about it all the technology we've got and all the Massive amounts of planning and engineering and time and effort you can put into climbing Mount Everest and a lot of people just still die.

657
00:44:42,103 --> 00:44:45,359
Scott: Couldn't we just make like an Everest evader or something all right?

658
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,832
Scott: Just like fly up there with a helicopter, and I fly back down.

659
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,720
Rym: I don't think you could do helicopters.

660
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,830
Rym: I don't think it would be too wise.

661
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:53,352
Scott: why not?

662
00:44:53,493 --> 00:44:53,815
Rym: well one.

663
00:44:53,855 --> 00:44:54,940
Rym: the air is thinner that high.

664
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,551
Rym: I don't know how high helicopter you can go.

665
00:44:56,571 --> 00:44:57,517
Scott: bring some air with you.

666
00:44:58,463 --> 00:44:59,468
Rym: I'm talking about the air.

667
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,594
Rym: the helicopter flies in.

668
00:45:00,714 --> 00:45:01,699
Scott: I know bring some with you.

669
00:45:03,102 --> 00:45:05,795
Rym: So you're saying pressurize the earth.

670
00:45:06,257 --> 00:45:12,660
Rym: yep, yeah Plus wouldn't taking an escalator kind of defeat the point of climbing Mount Everest?

671
00:45:13,183 --> 00:45:19,075
Rym: Uh if the point is to see space then no I think the point is more to prove that you can do it.

672
00:45:19,156 --> 00:45:20,140
Scott: see I don't really care about that.

673
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,164
Scott: I just I was.

674
00:45:21,265 --> 00:45:24,579
Scott: actually I had no interest in seeing Mount Everest until I heard that you could see space.

675
00:45:25,161 --> 00:45:26,466
Rym: You heard that from an anime.

676
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:27,067
Scott: That's right.

677
00:45:27,188 --> 00:45:28,412
Rym: Yeah, all right.

678
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:30,157
Rym: I think we've gone off to some tangent.

679
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:31,662
Rym: so before we wrap this up Don't forget.

680
00:45:31,983 --> 00:45:33,206
Rym: We've got a contest going.

681
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,016

682

Rym: There's a bunch of rules.

685
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:46,273
Rym: you can read the forums for details.

686
00:45:46,655 --> 00:45:47,780
Rym: it has to have a website.

687
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,252
Rym: It has to have existed for at least 20 episodes.

688
00:45:50,313 --> 00:45:51,137
Rym: I forget all the details.

689
00:45:51,177 --> 00:45:51,740
Rym: They're written down.

690
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,146
Scott: Yeah, don't just send us a link.

691
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:55,598
Scott: you got to tell us why it's the worst podcast ever.

692
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,960
Rym: also I will tell you guys now We've gotten a lot of entries and several of them are really good.

693
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,546
Rym: So I want you to enter.

694
00:46:02,686 --> 00:46:04,613
Rym: don't skimp on this bonus points.

695
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:09,460
Rym: if it's a popular podcast that sucks But you're up against some pretty stiff competition.

696
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:17,868
Scott: Also, it's gonna take us a while to listen to all these podcasts and judge based on your descriptions and the podcasts Which one is really the worst and who should win.

697
00:46:17,888 --> 00:46:20,820
Scott: yeah, so don't expect a winner to be announced very soon.

698
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:24,591
Rym: Also, I gotta say some of these podcasts.

699
00:46:24,651 --> 00:46:27,259
Rym: I listen to them a little bit and some of the write-ups you guys sent in.

700
00:46:27,279 --> 00:46:31,552
Rym: I Am dumbfounded at how bad some of these podcasts are.

701
00:46:31,632 --> 00:46:33,460
Rym: I really didn't expect it to be that bad.

702
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:34,465
Scott: Yeah, it's.

703
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,034
Scott: it's sort of like I can draw.

704
00:46:36,134 --> 00:46:40,020
Scott: if I try to draw something I'll draw some stick figures, maybe something a little better than a stick figure.

705
00:46:40,142 --> 00:46:41,259
Scott: It's bad, you know.

706
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:55,400
Scott: But imagine if I drew that bad stick figure Put it up on a deviated art and said check out my awesome arts and then kept drawing them For weeks and weeks and weeks without acting like they were awesome and was totally serious about it.

707
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:23,640
Rym: I'm not sure if it's hilarious or sad yet because on one hand I hate to rag on someone who is on their own dime Providing content to the world trying to do something because they think it's good someone who has a hobby is excited about it But at the same time it's really hard not to have a rofl session about a super nerdy kid Trying in halting halting nerd speak to explain the difference between Captain America and Captain Marvel.

708
00:47:26,317 --> 00:47:29,192
Scott: So They're both dead.

709
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:32,249
