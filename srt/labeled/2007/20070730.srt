1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,948
Scott: It's Monday July 30th.

2
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,172
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:15,480
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:21,880
Scott: Tonight we talked briefly about portable audio recorders while Rym suffers.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:32,244
Rym: Let's do this Well after the weekend of Otakon and the week at the shore.

6
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:32,787
Rym: We're back.

7
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:33,390
Rym: We're bad.

8
00:00:34,173 --> 00:00:36,261
Rym: I'm a little sick still a little sick.

9
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:37,465
Scott: You're a lot sick.

10
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,690
Rym: I'm only a little sick now.

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,078
Rym: I was a lot sick during the week.

12
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:44,058
Rym: you see Otakon was well and good but I caught well.

13
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:53,448
Rym: actually Emily got sick at the con the oda flu as it were and I didn't exhibit symptoms until the second day at the shore, and I recovered mostly.

14
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:58,110
Rym: but as a result I couldn't talk for most of our quote-unquote writers retreat.

15
00:00:58,251 --> 00:01:03,550
Rym: So the crew got to hang out in a very strange environment where Rym is mostly quiet.

16
00:01:04,352 --> 00:01:06,800
Scott: Yeah, and I didn't get sick.

17
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:08,104
Scott: I wonder why that is.

18
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:10,492
Rym: yeah, I got pretty bad sinuses I always have.

19
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:13,545
Scott: why don't you get some sort of permanent fixing going on?

20
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:14,529
Rym: because there's no such thing.

21
00:01:15,252 --> 00:01:15,995
Scott: There's a such thing.

22
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:18,003
Scott: there is of sinus surgery or something.

23
00:01:18,124 --> 00:01:19,509
Rym: There's nothing that can be done about that.

24
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:22,801
Scott: Yeah, don't suck in the first place anyway.

25
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:23,724
Rym: I'm mostly back.

26
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:24,446
Rym: I can talk now.

27
00:01:24,506 --> 00:01:25,610
Rym: I just have to talk quietly.

28
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,049
Rym: I've got the gain way up on my microphone, and I'm trying not to strain myself, but at least we're here doing a show.

29
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:36,430
Scott: Yeah, I guess doing a show sick is better than not doing a show at all and I got a few quick.

30
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:38,749
Scott: I know a lot of other podcasters that would just give up.

31
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,130
Rym: I know a lot of podcasters who give up for far less than we give up.

32
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:47,910
Scott: I know a lot of professional TV people who just be like got my voice is slightly and not coming in today.

33
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,295
Rym: Yeah, so take that internet.

34
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:53,130
Rym: Yeah, but before we get started we have a bunch of errata and all that from last week.

35
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:58,664
Rym: To all of you new listeners I'm sure you are aware that last week was mostly filler episodes.

36
00:01:59,026 --> 00:02:00,190
Rym: a lot of your pride from Otakon.

37
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,358
Rym: You're probably wondering where your Otakon coverage is.

38
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:04,164
Rym: you're gonna have to wait till Wednesday.

39
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:05,810
Rym: you see Monday for GeekNights.

40
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,829
Rym: Here is science and technology and computers and Linux and all that crap.

41
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:12,063
Scott: And you want me to continue because you don't want to talk.

42
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:22,450
Scott: so on Tuesday we talk about the video games and sometimes the board games and Even more rarely the RPGs, but we might actually talk about those more often.

43
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:30,270
Rym: We're gonna have a lot more RPG talk as time comes on because we're gonna start playing Pretty much everything that Luke crane ever said a word about when we talk to him.

44
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:37,590
Scott: And the Wednesdays we cover the animes and the mangas and the comics and the visual arts of geekiness.

45
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:49,027
Scott: So that is the day where your Otakon coverage will reside because Otakon is a convention of otaku generation Which is mostly the anime and the manga also a kind of crappy podcast.

46
00:02:49,267 --> 00:03:01,136
Rym: Yeah But also if you are one of those anime fans since I figure most of you and I saw a lot of you hitting the Feed so I know you're there if you're looking for anime stuff I suggest that you listen to.

47
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:02,844
Rym: two weeks ago on Wednesday.

48
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,110
Rym: We had a normal episode.

49
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:17,624
Rym: We reviewed ConnectiCon and I'd suggest to all of you who might have been looking for it last Wednesday We had special guest host Dave and Joel from fast karate for the gentleman Do one of the best episodes of GeekNights that has ever been aired.

50
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:19,150
Scott: but Rym screwed up.

51
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,629
Scott: You see we uploaded the episode in advance.

52
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:29,326
Scott: however, we uploaded it well beyond the quota on Libsyn and So Rym uploaded it and he checked it and he said all is well.

53
00:03:29,447 --> 00:03:30,170
Rym: and all was well.

54
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,716
Rym: I listened to it from Libsyn.

55
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:33,543
Rym: I sent the link to Dave and Joel.

56
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:34,587
Rym: I was like check this out.

57
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:42,679
Scott: It works Yep, and then you know, I said it to automatically post to the website and everything Yep, and the Monday posted just fine.

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,870
Scott: the Monday to the Tuesday posted just fine.

59
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,118
Rym: There was no Thursday.

60
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:56,890
Scott: to all of you who are saying we screwed that up, too we were gonna make a Thursday episode similar to the Thursday episode from the last week of awesome, but Rym said oh, we'll just make it tomorrow morning.

61
00:03:57,272 --> 00:03:58,437
Scott: And then we didn't like.

62
00:03:58,477 --> 00:04:03,979
Rym: the reason I said that was that we've recorded what like five Various episodes and bits that day.

63
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:07,150
Scott: Yeah, but it wouldn't have taken long to make that tiny five-second episode.

64
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,560
Rym: It was already like 11 and I hadn't even packed for Otakon yet.

65
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:12,640
Scott: It took me like 10 minutes to pack for Otakon Whatever.

66
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:15,790
Scott: Yeah Anyway, the point is there wasn't a Thursday episode.

67
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:21,874
Rym: We could probably go back and put it Thursday episode there we could but if you tried to listen to the Dave and Joel It is up now.

68
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:24,363
Rym: It has been up since actually yesterday.

69
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:29,427
Scott: Yep, but it Rym went over the Libsyn quota and it got deleted.

70
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,222
Rym: Yes I do this podcast by myself and I put it over the quota.

71
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:37,755
Scott: We went through great effort to Get it uploaded again.

72
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:39,440
Rym: Yeah, you want to hear a funny story.

73
00:04:40,021 --> 00:04:52,810
Rym: my computer currently my awesome new computer There's a problem with Linux and the onboard NIC which doesn't manifest in Windows It's only Linux and it basically makes my NIC periodically throw out a lot of bad packets.

74
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,905
Scott: I'll have to investigate this problem with closer scrutiny's.

75
00:04:56,267 --> 00:05:00,550
Scott: but yeah There's a problem with his network card and his computer and his Linux.

76
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,890
Rym: So thus we weren't able to through all of our magic log into my computer from afar and up.

77
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:11,250
Scott: We went through such great Technological feats that I will not describe because they'll probably be bore many people even though it's a Monday show.

78
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,178
Rym: We should do a show on remote access though.

79
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:22,550
Scott: We should do a show on what access but basically we Connected to the server in the sky and from there we went through a VPN to mock to computer in the house.

80
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:29,673
Scott: And then from there we told the router to open up a port so we could reconfigure the router to open up a port To.

81
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:42,450
Scott: well, we made an SSH tunnel so that we could visit the router With a web browser reconfigure the router to open a port to rims computer Connected directly to rims computer and then failed to do so because rims computer has this problem.

82
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:50,217
Rym: Yep, even worse was before that I had to get Emily who was at home to turn my computer on and I thought alright I'll just call her and get her turn my computer out.

83
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:55,649
Rym: and then I realized as I walked her through all the steps that it Is not a trivial process to turn my computer on.

84
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:58,670
Scott: well The problem is you turned off the power in all different places.

85
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:03,488
Scott: I turned off the power on my computer in only two places not all three places.

86
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:07,630
Scott: Well part of it I turned the UPS I guess technically four places if you count these circuit breaker.

87
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:11,790
Rym: So I had the UPS and the power supply switch in the back and then the switch in the front.

88
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,580
Rym: Luckily it boots to Linux by default.

89
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:15,150
Rym: So I didn't have to mess with any of that.

90
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,685
Scott: Yeah, I only turned off the power supply switch and the computer itself.

91
00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:19,630
Scott: Not the UPS.

92
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:25,443
Scott: I kept my UPS on because it also powers my clock But of course I got home and the clock was screwed up.

93
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:28,477
Scott: Anyway, yeah Which is awesome.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,818
Scott: That's why I don't put the 9-volt battery in my clock I just put the.

95
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:33,210
Scott: I just put the clock into my UPS.

96
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,061
Rym: Yeah I used to plug my clock into the UPS but I rearranged my bedroom and now the UPS is too far away and I'm not.

97
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,116
Scott: You can use the extension cord though.

98
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:46,310
Rym: I'm not gonna run an extension cord halfway around my room.

99
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,596
Scott: Okay, then get the 9-volt battery.

100
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,500
Rym: I'm gonna get the 9-volt battery.

101
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,263
Rym: That's a good plan.

102
00:06:49,444 --> 00:06:50,830
Rym: Actually, I'm thinking of getting a new alarm clock.

103
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,446
Rym: I've had the same alarm clock since like you get one of those fancy ones of the iPod dock.

104
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:56,750
Rym: I don't need that.

105
00:06:56,911 --> 00:07:00,552
Rym: I'm using an alarm clock from like 1990.

106
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:01,856
Scott: you could get the old-fashioned kind.

107
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:05,467
Scott: that's mechanical with the hammer that goes back and forth between two bells.

108
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,270
Scott: ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding.

109
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,070
Rym: See I've only had two alarm clocks in my life.

110
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:09,214
Rym: I had the one I had.

111
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:10,418
Rym: now I use it now.

112
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:13,208
Rym: that sound the sound my alarm clock Nate makes.

113
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,750
Rym: I Could hear that from like a mile away.

114
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:23,327
Rym: It's the worst sound in the world as far as I can tell because that has ruined Dreams and woken me up for work in school for well over a decade.

115
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:31,685
Rym: Yep Before that I had a Care Bears alarm clock that When it rang it was louder than anything you've ever.

116
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:36,452
Rym: I don't know how it was so loud But my parents actually gimped it so it wouldn't be so loud So wouldn't?

117
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:38,399
Rym: we wouldn't wake up screaming every morning.

118
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,205
Scott: I had a. I had this alarm clock.

119
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:41,048
Scott: that was clear, right?

120
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,287
Scott: You could like see through it and it was.

121
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:48,450
Scott: you know It was a standard alarm clock and I had that for a long time and then I don't know what happened to it.

122
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:55,117
Scott: I don't remember it breaking but I Eventually, it was gone and I got the one I have now which is a Radio Shack one Which is I got.

123
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:57,331
Scott: it must have been in high school sometime I don't know.

124
00:07:57,773 --> 00:08:03,070
Scott: but the point is one time my mom ordered me a Super Mario alarm clock.

125
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:08,310
Scott: It was the kind with the hammer and the two bells and she ordered it from the JC penny catalog.

126
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:11,850
Scott: We went to the JC penny counter to pick it up and it was broken.

127
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:13,842
Scott: So she sent it back and she didn't get me a new one.

128
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:19,569
Scott: Ah Rob So I never had a Mario alarm clock, even though I should have had a Mario alarm clock.

129
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:23,450
Scott: If I had that Mario alarm clock, I'd probably still have that Mario alarm.

130
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,742
Rym: They should make a new Mario alarm clock one that plays I'm sure.

131
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:28,770
Scott: in Japan they have Mario alarm clocks.

132
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:30,100
Rym: Let's get one.

133
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,253
Scott: All right, sure Right.

134
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:35,844
Rym: Anyway, and my last little bit of errata here if I sound different.

135
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:37,570
Rym: it's because my throat is a wreck.

136
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,394
Rym: It's a piece of shit.

137
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,323
Rym: My throat is a bloody wreck.

138
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:41,750
Scott: Everyone donate us money.

139
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,542
Scott: I don't we don't ask for money, but Rym needs a new larynx.

140
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:46,188
Scott: So money is needed.

141
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:46,570
Rym: It's funny.

142
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:48,070
Rym: I've always had problems with my voice.

143
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:55,117
Rym: I lose my voice pretty easily and over the years like last Otakon Scott and I both lost our voices Not from doing live shows.

144
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:56,121
Rym: we survived all that.

145
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:59,770
Scott: the problem at Otakon is it's crowded and loud and you We talk a lot.

146
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:01,930
Rym: Mostly we talk a lot.

147
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,650
Scott: No one would have ever guessed that and when you talk a lot and it's loud you talk loudly so people can hear you.

148
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,275
Scott: It's like talk.

149
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:13,930
Scott: if I talked at a concert the whole night I would lose my voice because I'd be talking over the concert a lot.

150
00:09:14,151 --> 00:09:24,490
Rym: Well even worse is the fact that the front row crew is a whole generally especially more so in the past than now Centers around us and if we don't take charge nothing gets done.

151
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,130
Rym: We're starting to wean everyone off of that.

152
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:36,507
Rym: But back then that year we pretty much heard it the entire crew around the entire con and we made all the dinner Arrangements and involved a lot of yelling to get people we're going to this restaurant at eight.

153
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:37,370
Rym: meet us there.

154
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,035
Rym: Well, I'm going back to the hotel room.

155
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:40,540
Rym: You've got the hotel key, right?

156
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:43,730
Scott: Yep, and thus we lost our voices this year.

157
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:47,250
Rym: We pretty much told everyone to go screw themselves and deal with it on their own.

158
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:52,330
Rym: We spent much of the con sitting at our artists alley table taking turns talking to random passers-by.

159
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,355
Scott: Yeah, I still.

160
00:09:53,415 --> 00:09:55,908
Scott: I almost lost my voice at that artists alley.

161
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,315
Scott: that day At least I tired it out.

162
00:09:57,676 --> 00:10:01,994
Scott: cuz I would be like you want to take the fanboy feud survey Blah blah blah.

163
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:03,559
Scott: Do you know about podcasts?

164
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,642
Scott: Blah blah blah.

165
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:05,545
Rym: You don't need an iPod.

166
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:08,235
Scott: You don't need an iPod Blah blah blah.

167
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,259
Scott: What was the other thing?

168
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,344
Scott: Oh Carcassonne.

169
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:11,589
Scott: This is what Carcassonne is.

170
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,135
Scott: Yep We had three things that I three spiels I had to give and we took.

171
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:18,370
Rym: we kind of took turns giving the different ones as one of us would rest and it was.

172
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,089
Rym: It was a good time.

173
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:23,110
Scott: It was good times, but three spiels over a loud artists alley tiring.

174
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:27,030
Rym: But at least I because my voice goes bad much easier than Scott's.

175
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:35,261
Rym: I actually read a bunch of things about how vocalists and singers and people don't lose their voices and It worked for not born with larynxes of Rym.

176
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:36,910
Rym: So it worked pretty well.

177
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:43,838
Rym: actually the techniques I breathing right and making sure I make the voice come from the right part of the throat and Open everything up and all that business.

178
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:46,430
Rym: and I didn't lose my voice at all at Otakon.

179
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:49,566
Rym: I lost my voice when I got sick and the post nasal drip destroyed me.

180
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:53,321
Scott: Yep Anyway, that's let's talk about tech stuff.

181
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:55,170
Scott: All right Scott talk about the rest later.

182
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:58,990
Rym: What do you got in the news since we missed I don't know almost two weeks worth of internet.

183
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:00,856
Scott: Well, there was so much internet.

184
00:11:00,956 --> 00:11:12,768
Scott: Actually, I just sort of marked all my RSS feeds as red because I don't care It's not worth me my time to read like two thousand items of RSS news when maybe a hundred of them I actually care about.

185
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:20,690
Scott: But one thing did catch my eye and that is that the koan I audio 7 is now available in the United States.

186
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:29,550
Scott: Uh-huh, you can get the 8 gig one Which is red for two hundred and twenty dollars about or the 4 gig silver one for a hundred and sixty dollars now.

187
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:32,490
Scott: Why is this news that there's a new mp3 player?

188
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:37,590
Rym: Well one think about how big those are compared to how much they cost and compare them to say I don't know an iPod.

189
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:38,910
Scott: Well, yeah.

190
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:59,907
Scott: But also let me discuss why the kawan I audio 7 is such an important player that you should take note of Especially if you're the kind of person who wants a portable audio and maybe video player Wants a small one and does not want an iPod and doesn't want to be beholden to any sort of you know DRM type things or anything like that.

191
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,610
Scott: The kawan iota 7 is an mp3 player.

192
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:09,506
Scott: It's also a video player but it kind of sucks as a video player because you need to convert videos of the special tool To play on it.

193
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:15,839
Scott: But regardless of that it plays mp3s Flaks and oggs without problem.

194
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:16,702
Scott: just plays them.

195
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:19,010
Scott: There's barely any other players that do that.

196
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:20,314
Scott: It's got flash.

197
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:21,297
Scott: it works.

198
00:12:21,377 --> 00:12:22,501
Scott: It's just a normal drive.

199
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,270
Scott: It has a normal USB hole in the bottom of it.

200
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,475
Scott: No weird plugs at all.

201
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:28,181
Scott: So you plug it in USB.

202
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:29,366
Scott: It looks like a drive.

203
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:32,097
Scott: you drag files onto it You're done on the front.

204
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:40,350
Scott: It's got like, you know the stop button in the play button and It's got this slide II thing that lets you like slide around like an iPod.

205
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:47,413
Scott: It also lets you click forward and click back just once and it also lets you hold down either end of the slide II bit To go really fast.

206
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:57,029
Scott: So it gives you actually a lot more flexibility in moving around the menus than the iPod wheelie does and It's cheap and it's awesome.

207
00:12:57,572 --> 00:13:04,730
Scott: The only thing that's wrong with it is that the volume control or There's extra buttons on the side for volume control and mode change.

208
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:11,458
Scott: it does have a microphone and I'm pretty sure it can record things and Not that we care about that anymore.

209
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:12,121
Scott: We care about that.

210
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:22,255
Scott: Yeah, we'll get to that and I would say that if you are the kind of person who needs a portable media playing device and does not want an iPod This is the new winner.

211
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:33,525
Scott: The only major problem I see with it is that it is about you know It's about the size of an iPod nano face wise and maybe even smaller But it's about as thick as three or four iPod nanos.

212
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:34,670
Rym: That's not so bad.

213
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,535
Rym: It's not a deal-breaker, but it's still kind of.

214
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:39,424
Scott: however as a result the battery.

215
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:40,828
Scott: guess how long the battery lasts.

216
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:41,530
Rym: I don't know.

217
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:44,649
Rym: seven years 60 hours.

218
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:45,953
Rym: It's not too bad.

219
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:49,403
Rym: my iPod nano which isn't that old already only lasts a couple hours.

220
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:52,150
Scott: mine lasts like six ish hours.

221
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:59,357
Scott: When it was new it lasted seven ish hours 60 hours dams This thing.

222
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:00,529
Scott: you just don't need to plug it in.

223
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,241
Scott: So yeah, cool anyone listening to this on their computer?

224
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:07,869
Scott: go buy this player and listen to it on that instead.

225
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:08,933
Rym: I don't know.

226
00:14:08,953 --> 00:14:09,916
Rym: I'm still kind of holding out.

227
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:13,930
Rym: I think I'm gonna keep my some semi crappy, but yet functional iPod nano.

228
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:15,839
Scott: Oh, I didn't say I'm gonna run on this.

229
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:23,686
Rym: I think my plan in general is I'm gonna keep this thing Until the perfect mp3 player appears and then I will pay almost any amount of money to have that sound.

230
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:26,315
Scott: basically right now My phone and my iPod.

231
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:30,330
Scott: I'm gonna keep them until they are dead and the point at which they are dead.

232
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,090
Scott: I will you know find if the if the best thing does not exist yet.

233
00:14:34,592 --> 00:14:40,961
Scott: I will just continue traveling the low cheap road of subsistence Until the perfect thing comes.

234
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:43,832
Rym: of course the perfect thing is pretty much Wi-Fi.

235
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:48,065
Rym: subscribe to podcasts on it and it just downloads them whenever it gets internet access.

236
00:14:48,165 --> 00:14:51,957
Scott: only ever have to plug it in to charge Removable rechargeable battery.

237
00:14:51,977 --> 00:14:53,643
Rym: Yeah, that's for you want to configure it.

238
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:55,710
Rym: It's just a website lee free of DRM.

239
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:57,057
Scott: Just put files on it.

240
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:59,290
Scott: Yeah good interface small.

241
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:04,810
Rym: So anyway, I bring this up only because it's kind of relevant to what happened at Otakon.

242
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,097
Rym: But apparently a lot of you might have seen this.

243
00:15:07,117 --> 00:15:15,699
Rym: but Fox 11 which is for Los Angeles the local guy there did some sort of Expose on this band of terrorists car.

244
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,885
Scott: Yeah, I'm not a hundred percent sure.

245
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:19,870
Scott: This is actually a real Fox News story.

246
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:22,949
Rym: I'm at www.my Fox la.com.

247
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:25,295
Scott: My Fox la.

248
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:28,365
Scott: that's not like fox.com slash la or something.

249
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:29,650
Scott: It's a tough call.

250
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:32,558
Rym: I'm pretty sure this is legitimate Scott.

251
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:33,080
Rym: No,

252
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,842
Scott: I'm just saying

253
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:49,220
Rym: anyway, this is a video of Someone who really doesn't seem to understand what the internet is about and a bunch of other people who are victims of the internet Partly because they don't understand what it's really about Talking about the evil terrorist ways of places like 4chan.

254
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,880
Rym: now for those of you who don't know 4chan is pretty much just a sea of pornography Mostly the futanari variety.

255
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,784
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

256
00:15:56,845 --> 00:15:59,294
Rym: Don't look that word up Do not you really don't?

257
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:02,843
Scott: if you don't know what futanari is you don't want to know what futanari is.

258
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:05,290
Scott: f-u-t-a-n-a-r-i.

259
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:06,630
Rym: See, I'm glad you spelled it now.

260
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:13,990
Rym: This is kind of like back in the day when you kept hearing people say Goatsy or tub girl and you think I wonder what that is and they'd say oh you don't want to know.

261
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,649
Rym: But then you got curious and then you looked and then you realize that they were right.

262
00:16:18,372 --> 00:16:20,379
Scott: Well, you don't want to know what futanari to me.

263
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,450
Rym: I think that the futanari no one on 4chan actually likes it.

264
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,903
Rym: I think that is 4chan's defense against normal people.

265
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:28,830
Rym: normal people go in see that and go.

266
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,658
Scott: Ah, I do not think that it is that futanari is.

267
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:38,070
Scott: I don't think defense is the only purpose of futanari on 4chan But it is one of the purposes of having that there.

268
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,739
Rym: It must have some other hidden purpose that we don't know about.

269
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:43,770
Scott: maybe it's code who like futanari go to 4chan.

270
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:46,742
Rym: I can't imagine there's that many people who like futanari.

271
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:48,770
Scott: I think there's a lot of people who secretly like futanari.

272
00:16:49,393 --> 00:16:49,735
Rym: I don't know.

273
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:50,580
Rym: I don't see the appeal.

274
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,330
Rym: but then again, there's a lot of things I don't see.

275
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:52,815
Scott: I don't.

276
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:54,150
Scott: I don't see the appeal either.

277
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,200
Rym: but yeah what I suggest?

278
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:04,654
Rym: you watch this because it's kind of hilarious and - I would like to point out that our friends Pete and James at Otakon did a Documentary.

279
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,030
Rym: they had a James had a camera and released a portion of a documentary.

280
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,849
Rym: Yeah, they started a documentary of 4chan and they filmed the line to get into the panel.

281
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:17,040
Rym: They couldn't actually film the panel because they wouldn't let cameras into the panel.

282
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,130
Scott: This is quickly turning into an Otakon review show.

283
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:22,069
Rym: Yeah, well, it's kind of people want to hear about this.

284
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:30,893
Rym: We'll talk about this more once it's done But suffice to say the video footage that they got from the 4chan line at Otakon was up Interesting.

285
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:31,797
Rym: See King?

286
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,083
Rym: Fuck yeah.

287
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:34,449
Scott: That's the only one we're gonna do.

288
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:42,810
Rym: I think 4chan has infected the front row crew a little bit but more importantly I think they're gonna go all the way and make an actual documentary because I think I don't.

289
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:48,810
Rym: I'm gonna paraphrase Pete, but he basically said I went in expecting to see something hilarious and make fun of it.

290
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:56,967
Rym: I came out somewhat shaken and Realized that there's something far deeper and more profound and at the same time all the more horrifying going on here.

291
00:17:57,348 --> 00:18:02,072
Rym: Yep Okay, the real moral of this news story however is very simple.

292
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:09,790
Rym: people who don't understand the internet don't seem to realize that the internet is the wild wild west and You've got to protect yourself.

293
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:13,021
Rym: It's not that there's some evil anonymous clan out to get you.

294
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:15,790
Rym: It's that you haven't protected yourself from the internet.

295
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:16,904
Rym: It's not that hard to do.

296
00:18:17,872 --> 00:18:23,450
Scott: I like how they seem to think that there's an actual group calling itself anonymous that is doing these bad things.

297
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,279
Scott: I'm opposed to just you know anonymous people.

298
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:27,522
Scott: I don't know.

299
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:30,070
Scott: Yes people fear what they do not understand.

300
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:31,769
Scott: This is old and known.

301
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:43,570
Rym: consider this a preview because we're gonna do a show probably in the next couple weeks on 4chan and anonymity and all that and of course John Gabriel's creator internet fuckwad theory up the most important theory on all internet knowings.

302
00:18:50,811 --> 00:18:52,338
Rym: Well so much for more talk about that.

303
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:54,910
Rym: It looks like it's time for things of the day.

304
00:18:55,657 --> 00:19:05,790
Rym: I hate to have to explain this again But since we have a bunch of new listeners I figure I might as well at least warn you that This is the part of the show where we talk about the things we've seen that might have been hilarious on the internet recently.

305
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:12,850
Scott: Well, I haven't been on the internet for like a week and a half So you're getting something that's right at the top cuz I just cleared out everything.

306
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,725
Scott: I am NOT looking back if anything cool happened on the internet and last week.

307
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:18,090
Scott: I don't know about it.

308
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,502
Scott: So if you actually send me a link, I won't say that's so old.

309
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:22,165
Scott: I seen that.

310
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:25,838
Scott: I'll say awesome something I haven't seen but make sure it's from the last week.

311
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,528
Scott: if it's from two weeks ago, you'll be puns.

312
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:30,698
Rym: Yeah Alright, so what do you got for me?

313
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:32,850
Scott: So check this video, right?

314
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:39,277
Scott: There's someone they have a house and they're sitting in the house Looking at their front door.

315
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:40,843
Scott: probably it's from the inside.

316
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:43,070
Rym: I feel like your story should be interspersed with brack.

317
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:44,809
Scott: That did it done.

318
00:19:46,898 --> 00:19:49,227
Scott: And they look at the doggy door.

319
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:52,000
Rym: done done done all right, that's enough of that.

320
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:59,366
Scott: and Through the doggy door comes one of the better animals the raccoon.

321
00:19:59,386 --> 00:20:03,989
Scott: I Really like raccoons are alright except the rabid ones.

322
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:04,733
Rym: I like them.

323
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:05,857
Rym: I like raccoons cuz one.

324
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:07,765
Rym: they have little human hands and they manipulate things.

325
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:08,970
Rym: they pick stuff up and they're very.

326
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:16,717
Rym: They're very intelligent looking and they seem to have some sort of glimmer of understanding of what they're about to do Especially when it's something mischievous.

327
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:17,760
Scott: I don't know.

328
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:24,957
Rym: I like the idea of raccoons more than actual raccoons But anyway, well thing is I've never had actual raccoons mess with any of my stuff So I have no clothes.

329
00:20:24,978 --> 00:20:26,550
Scott: they used to mess with their trash all the time.

330
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:30,050
Scott: We had to seal that trash up with some bungee cords or else they'd be getting in there.

331
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,309
Rym: We just had a really heavy lid on the trash and the raccoons couldn't get to it.

332
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,236
Scott: Yeah, our trash not heavy lids.

333
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:36,240
Rym: We also had dogs.

334
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:36,922
Scott: Yep.

335
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:42,409
Scott: Anyway, it's raccoon Pokes through the doggy door dumb dumb dumb.

336
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,155
Scott: And he reaches into the house like with half his body But not the other half his body.

337
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:55,029
Scott: and they're sitting there videotaping this raccoon and it's just sitting there like hey what's up, but it's glowy eyeballs and it's evil burglar mask.

338
00:20:55,049 --> 00:21:08,890
Scott: and it grabs this little rug sitting by the front door and And it pulls it out the doggy door it steals it a Raccoon wearing a burglar mask broke into their house and stole their carpet.

339
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:13,264
Scott: Oh my OMG raccoons in your house stealing your carpets.

340
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,737
Scott: I has a rug That's.

341
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:17,428
Scott: that's this video.

342
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:30,050
Rym: So over the week which we in the front row crew every year called the week of awesome the week we spend usually down in Wildwood at our friend Scott Johnson's house Instead of you know, wherever else we'd go just sleeping on the beach and doing all sorts of things.

343
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:42,390
Rym: we spent part of it with Yuko and Ananth and the two of them kept making some inside jokes and eventually They realized that I did not understand the inside jokes because I had not seen the video to which they were referring.

344
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,430
Scott: Read a book.

345
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:49,370
Rym: They then tried to find said video and it was up taken down from most of the places that had been posted.

346
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:57,670
Scott: That's because most of the places it was posted It was posted on YouTube and just about every other result on Google was a link to the YouTube that was taken down.

347
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:00,279
Rym: I think there were a couple of different youtubes taken down.

348
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,570
Scott: even so there were all links to YouTube where it was taken down.

349
00:22:03,811 --> 00:22:07,670
Rym: Suffice to say if the link to this thing of the day breaks just keep looking for it.

350
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,633
Rym: You'll find it somewhere.

351
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:12,165
Rym: If anything it might re-air at some point perhaps.

352
00:22:12,526 --> 00:22:18,409
Rym: if we only watch television Now people try to show us stuff for things of the day all the time And I was like, alright, whatever to show it to me later.

353
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:20,235
Rym: But they persisted.

354
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:31,410
Rym: they decided that it was too good to let go and they spent a good while looking for it and Eventually, they found it and they showed it to me and I can't pretend that I didn't laugh out loud.

355
00:22:31,531 --> 00:22:32,969
Scott: It's it's too awesome.

356
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:37,270
Scott: Should we should we go through the lyrics one at a time and then just have let leave it at that?

357
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,750
Rym: Well, first off this is something that actually aired on television on BET black entertainment television.

358
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:47,930
Rym: It was a written recorded and produced by Bomani Amer aka not a rapper.

359
00:22:48,432 --> 00:22:54,997
Rym: Yep, it seems like a pretty cool guy - I'm kind of interested in the rest of his music now Although he does say that he's not a rapper.

360
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:59,230
Scott: He's a poet with a hip-hop styling which is a rapper.

361
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:01,937
Scott: That's like saying I'm not a string.

362
00:23:01,957 --> 00:23:05,366
Scott: I'm just some elongated cloth used to tie things up.

363
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:11,324
Scott: I'm not a car I'm just a four-wheeled vehicle used to transport people around town.

364
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:13,190
Scott: That's basically what this guy's saying.

365
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,898
Scott: That's the only thing I could find wrong with him though.

366
00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:15,782
Scott: Everything else is cool.

367
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:19,180
Rym: so far from what I can gather though I didn't research this too deeply.

368
00:23:19,562 --> 00:23:27,090
Rym: he made this song and BET decided that they liked it and they wanted to get their team to animate it for him and then they made a music video.

369
00:23:27,652 --> 00:23:32,648
Scott: Yeah, it's actually I'm usually not a fan of the music videos, but this one's pretty good.

370
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:33,089
Scott: I like it.

371
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,138
Scott: It's gets good stuff.

372
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:41,030
Rym: a quote from this article This video is a great example of how the best animation can convey complex messages with great clarity and humor.

373
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,569
Rym: Now I would like to warn all of you that the video is not safe for work.

374
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:48,350
Scott: Well only because it has bad words.

375
00:23:48,517 --> 00:23:57,550
Rym: Yeah and some of you may or may not be offended by this but I would like to point out also that Scott and I are not racist and I contend that this video is not racist either.

376
00:23:57,631 --> 00:23:59,327
Rym: This video has nothing to do with race.

377
00:24:00,032 --> 00:24:05,050
Rym: This video is everything to do with hip-hop culture regardless of whether or not you're white black or purple.

378
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:12,930
Scott: Well, not so much the hip-hop culture But you know a certain part of the hip-hop a subset of the hip-hop culture that involves spinner rims.

379
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:15,323
Scott: Yes, because there is also the hip-hop called the.

380
00:24:15,363 --> 00:24:25,410
Scott: that's actually the largest Subset of the hip-hop culture because I there is the sex subset of hip-hop culture Which is all cool and underground and caring about poetry and music that is separate.

381
00:24:25,652 --> 00:24:28,010
Rym: There's also the subset aka nerd core.

382
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:32,450
Scott: There are many cores, but we're mostly talked targeting the main core.

383
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:40,462
Rym: so the primary lyric the chorus if you will of this work is read a book read a book read a motherfucking book.

384
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,836
Scott: and What are the other ones?

385
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:44,644
Rym: let's see by land.

386
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:48,270
Rym: brush your teeth Wear deodorant speeds.

387
00:24:49,473 --> 00:24:50,681
Scott: It's called speed stick.

388
00:24:50,902 --> 00:24:51,869
Rym: It's not expensive.

389
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:55,274
Scott: It's not expensive.

390
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:57,660
Rym: I highly recommend you watch this.

391
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,870
Scott: I find it absolutely hilarious see myself watching it two more times tonight.

392
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,795
Rym: Well, we have to show it to Emily when she gets home.

393
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:05,597
Scott: Oh, absolutely.

394
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:12,690
Rym: I Gotta say I'm gonna check out the rest of this guy's music though.

395
00:25:13,032 --> 00:25:15,929
Scott: Yeah, you can buy it on iTunes if you're into that sort of thing.

396
00:25:17,512 --> 00:25:23,410
Rym: So our main bit tonight gonna be a little bit short because my throat is pretty much at the end of its wits right now.

397
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,799
Rym: I don't know how much longer I'll be able to talk.

398
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,249
Scott: It's end not the end of its wits.

399
00:25:26,973 --> 00:25:30,490
Rym: See when I start saying something wrong, I can't just you know, oh I had a cue and edit it out.

400
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,450
Rym: I gotta really be judicious with the words I use.

401
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:39,116
Scott: So why are you saying a bunch of useless words right now and your voice is running out because my pride demands that I cover It up.

402
00:25:39,157 --> 00:25:44,548
Scott: Haha Alright, so tonight we're gonna talk about portable audio recorders.

403
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:50,848
Scott: now Basically, we as podcasters have a great need for a portable audio recorder.

404
00:25:50,968 --> 00:26:04,459
Scott: by that I mean a device which you can carry is powered by batteries in which can take an audio input signal and save it and then later deliver that signal to be used for other purposes.

405
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,346
Scott: and Well, we used to.

406
00:26:07,406 --> 00:26:09,514
Scott: you know, these devices have been around for a long time.

407
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:12,723
Scott: I mean cell phones can do this Frickin.

408
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:15,280
Scott: they used to have little tiny tape recorders that could do this.

409
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:30,659
Scott: they still do that you can get a device that does this all over the place, but We've never needed one really in our lives even though I mean I've had cell phones that could do it and I've had Other things that could do it and just never use that feature because it wasn't something we needed.

410
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:36,220
Rym: Yep I mean in high school, I use that stuff a lot But I could just borrow the debt from the music teacher if I needed to record anything.

411
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,280
Scott: I had a Fisher Price tape recorder as a kid that it had built-in microphone.

412
00:26:39,342 --> 00:26:39,758
Rym: I did too.

413
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:47,079
Rym: I actually apparently my brother and I recorded a little radio show all the time and I'm trying to find out if my mom still has the tapes laying around.

414
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:56,899
Scott: Yeah, that'll be some GeekNights specials for you Rym age 5 awesome, but yeah anyway as Podcasters we were looking for a new one.

415
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,503
Scott: You know something we could actually use for the podcast that we went to a convention mostly conventions But also other places.

416
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:10,220
Scott: we could record what went on there without having to carry a computer around or anything like that.

417
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:19,300
Rym: Yeah last year's Otakon We brought the Mac and the monitor and the compressor and the mixer and all the microphones and everything and that worked really well.

418
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:31,519
Rym: But I gotta say putting that stuff in packing it up taking it out putting it back together Was totally not worth it sucked ass base even though the episode we recorded with all that is still our most popular episode, huh?

419
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:39,551
Scott: But anyway, so we started looking for a solution to the problem and all the other Podcasters were using these I River thingies.

420
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:51,420
Scott: and well the I River is basically an mp3 player that happens to also be able to record audio and I wasn't really a fan of that so much and it didn't seem like it made the highest quality recordings.

421
00:27:51,621 --> 00:27:58,000
Rym: Yeah, I mean I'll admit whenever I tried to listen to other people's podcasts, and they tried to interview anyone the audio was usually atrocious.

422
00:27:58,462 --> 00:27:59,788
Rym: Yeah, like unlistenable.

423
00:27:59,908 --> 00:28:04,128
Scott: so the I River was no good, so he said all right Let's go to the Best Buy and see what they got.

424
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:26,100
Scott: and they have at the Best Buy audio recorders They got tape ones which tape ones while they are useful if you're just like trying to record a lecture or if you're say Interrogating someone or taking personal notes as you walk around you know in observing things at the zoo Maybe not too useful for us podcasting mostly because it's not digital

425
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:33,298
Rym: Yep, meaning I have to sit there and at one-to-one time record onto my computer from the tape to get the data off of it.

426
00:28:33,318 --> 00:28:42,680
Rym: and I actually borrowed one of these from my friend Scott Johnson at Katsucon like two years ago And I went around trying to interview people to you know do stuff with the audio.

427
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:47,114
Rym: And I learned that when I came home, and I had this tape full of audio.

428
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:51,859
Rym: There was not a single Functional tape player in our entire house.

429
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:56,860
Scott: There's actually a the thing you can buy for your computer that goes in a five and a quarter inch bay.

430
00:28:57,321 --> 00:29:03,880
Scott: That will if you put cassette tapes into it will convert them to digital file formats with a piece of software.

431
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,293
Rym: Yeah, but by then it was too late.

432
00:29:05,394 --> 00:29:09,674
Scott: Yes, of course We're not gonna go out and buy one of those devices for a one-time use anyway.

433
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:10,758
Rym: the first thing failed.

434
00:29:10,838 --> 00:29:12,123
Rym: the second thing I put it into cuz.

435
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:13,389
Rym: we think we had a bunch of them.

436
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:13,610
Rym: There's.

437
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,253
Rym: none of them worked.

438
00:29:14,554 --> 00:29:15,739
Rym: the second one destroyed the tape.

439
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:22,912
Rym: I Respooled it into a different cassette and then three and four also failed and then I gave up And I think I threw the cassette away.

440
00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:23,599
Rym: good idea.

441
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,771
Scott: Anyway, so tape suck.

442
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:27,000
Scott: we didn't want to deal with tapes plus.

443
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,902
Scott: We'd have to buy tapes.

444
00:29:27,943 --> 00:29:28,805
Scott: fuck that right.

445
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:34,180
Scott: so we bought this Sony thing and until someone dropped it and broke it ahem it.

446
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,427
Scott: It worked, but shittily.

447
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:39,295
Scott: basically the audio quality recorded was bad.

448
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:46,780
Scott: it recorded at low bit rates But if you plugged a microphone into the hole on the bottom of it and you ran filter you did post-production on the audio.

449
00:29:46,881 --> 00:29:50,180
Rym: It wasn't too bad granted It was an eighth inch jack.

450
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,160
Rym: So I had to convert to a quarter inch and then plug in like a big Radio Shack microphone.

451
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,870
Rym: So the microphone was bigger than the recorder.

452
00:29:57,071 --> 00:29:59,480
Scott: Yes, also the recorder.

453
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:02,931
Scott: You know, it didn't have too much space, but it could hold a lot.

454
00:30:03,272 --> 00:30:05,260
Scott: enough hours of music enough battery time.

455
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:12,176
Scott: But to get the music off of the recorder It was DRM DRM on something I recorded out in the real world.

456
00:30:12,217 --> 00:30:19,560
Rym: by pushing a button We run the house special crappy windows software that didn't work in Linux or the Mac to get the audio off.

457
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:22,114
Scott: Yes, only provided this software is the Sony's.

458
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:30,673
Scott: by the way, of course Sony gave this special software was the only way to get the stuff off of the player and as soon as you got it Off the player the DRM was gone.

459
00:30:30,713 --> 00:30:31,518
Scott: It was a way for an mp3.

460
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,085
Scott: So what the fuck?

461
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,531
Scott: why have to DRM in the first place?

462
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:36,177
Scott: just make mp3s on a disk.

463
00:30:36,218 --> 00:30:36,760
Scott: god damn it.

464
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:40,412
Rym: It was one of the crappiest things ever, but it was still like 80 bucks.

465
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,138
Scott: Yeah, but it broke.

466
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:43,765
Rym: Yeah Well, it was broken.

467
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:45,995
Scott: Yes, 80 bucks down the toilet.

468
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:47,260
Rym: Yeah, I didn't work.

469
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,014
Rym: I got a few interviews out of it, but it just.

470
00:30:49,074 --> 00:31:02,000
Rym: it was kind of crap You know, so while it served the purpose of walk around a con and interview people kind of okay it didn't serve all the other purposes like Record a backup stream of audio or plug it into a panel and record the whole panel.

471
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:13,240
Scott: Yes another reason we wanted a portable audio recorder is that what we could set up is we could Take an output from our mixer because one output from the mixer goes to the computer where it's recorded and turned into the show.

472
00:31:13,702 --> 00:31:17,520
Scott: We could take another output from the mixer and send it into the portable recorder.

473
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:22,754
Scott: Thus if the something happens to the computer the portable device has batteries.

474
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:32,772
Scott: so we won't lose the show Basically no matter what happens if we simultaneously record the show to the backup Portable recorder and of course the Sony thing could not do that.

475
00:31:33,535 --> 00:31:34,860
Scott: So we started looking for devices.

476
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:49,576
Scott: We needed a device that was a portable recorder Recorded relatively high quality had sufficient battery life and recording hours Wasn't too big and heavy and stupid wasn't crazily stupid expensive that we couldn't afford it.

477
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:58,998
Scott: and when you plugged it into a computer to get the files off was just MP3 files or just WAV files and didn't give us shit and didn't require special software.

478
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,808
Rym: now I did a bunch of research.

479
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:09,220
Scott: I did a bunch of research as well And basically I found that they're a device that we wanted does not really exist so much.

480
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:13,636
Scott: I mean there were the low-end devices like the Sony thing and those things are garbage.

481
00:32:13,676 --> 00:32:14,560
Rym: They're not worth the money.

482
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,555
Scott: Yeah, unless you're basically walking around doing personal crappy recording not for a podcast or any.

483
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:20,819
Rym: and then there's the hack together.

484
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:26,963
Rym: solutions Like buy the thing to stick into your iPod or buy the thing and all that the entire mid-range product line We're all these.

485
00:32:27,284 --> 00:32:30,940
Scott: turn your mp3 player into a recorder or get an mp3 player.

486
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:36,840
Scott: That's also a recorder like the creative Zen thing, which is also a recorder and those things take pretty crappy audio.

487
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,165
Rym: Yes, you got a fiddle with them.

488
00:32:38,185 --> 00:32:39,109
Rym: They don't always work so well.

489
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:41,840
Rym: And also you can't plug a real microphone into them.

490
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,276
Rym: Yep, I mean some of them you can but well not a real microphone.

491
00:32:45,376 --> 00:32:51,140
Scott: for the most part They're better than these Sony craps, but they're not dedicated recording devices.

492
00:32:51,280 --> 00:33:02,480
Scott: They're mp3 players that happen to be able to record or their cell phones that happen to be able to record or their Smart trios that happen to be able to record and they don't really well suited to the recording.

493
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,720
Scott: You just happen to be able to do it sufficiently.

494
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:09,457
Scott: and I wasn't about to go and buy an mp3 player just for the recording feature.

495
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:15,760
Rym: and From what I read all the ones that would work on our iPods were really really crappy and also really expensive.

496
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:17,513
Scott: Yes, mostly cuz we had iPod nanos.

497
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:18,440
Scott: They were pretty expensive.

498
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:26,139
Scott: But even if we had a regular iPod and not a nano the thing that makes it record decently is still like $200 which is a lot of freaking money.

499
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:32,456
Rym: But the problem was the next step up was basically professional audio recorders in the 600 to 1200 dollar range.

500
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,333
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you didn't get the mp3 player there wasn't like a $300 product.

501
00:33:38,373 --> 00:33:40,580
Scott: That was an awesome recorder for podcasters.

502
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:41,509
Scott: That doesn't exist.

503
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:42,680
Scott: I couldn't find one anywhere.

504
00:33:43,061 --> 00:34:00,332
Scott: The only the next best thing was a $500 badass recorder that like professional TV and radio NPR type people would use to do interviews in the field or like police would use to you know Interrogate record interrogations and FBI people would use.

505
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,480
Scott: there wasn't any mid-range product.

506
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,540
Rym: So think about this on one end the top of the budget scale for consumers.

507
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:07,624
Rym: Cuz pretty much.

508
00:34:07,664 --> 00:34:14,329
Rym: I think the real issue here is that they don't make these products for consumers at all And I can think of a lot of reasons why they might not.

509
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:16,880
Scott: there isn't a great demand other than podcasters.

510
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:17,728
Scott: It's also there.

511
00:34:17,768 --> 00:34:19,000
Rym: I mean back with debt and all that.

512
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:27,094
Rym: There was definitely this idea that the recording industry as a whole wanted to keep Professional recording equipment out of the hands of the public.

513
00:34:27,114 --> 00:34:28,280
Rym: that made it easy to pirate things.

514
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,650
Rym: That's why debt was so hideously crippled.

515
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:40,233
Scott: if you bought anything that cost a reasonable amount of money I mean imagine if people could get awesome badass recorders Right actual things that recorded in quality and brought them to concerts.

516
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:44,188
Scott: instead of bringing tiny little tape recorders They're using their cell phone to record.

517
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,016
Scott: then they can get it for like 300 bucks.

518
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:53,208
Scott: That'd be pretty dangerous because people have awesome concert recordings as opposed to Scratchy bootleg concert recordings.

519
00:34:53,650 --> 00:35:02,220
Rym: So between the in the gap here on one end You've got like that $80 piece of crap with a 16 megabyte flash in it that you can't even remove and DRM all over.

520
00:35:02,922 --> 00:35:06,493
Rym: And then you've got the Marantz PMD 660 which we ended up buying.

521
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:10,927
Scott: yeah, we basically bought the lowest end Professional thing we could find.

522
00:35:10,987 --> 00:35:14,661
Scott: I mean we could have gotten the 670, you know, I kind of wanted this 7.

523
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:15,224
Scott: Yes, it was.

524
00:35:15,264 --> 00:35:18,544
Scott: basically we could get an even fancier professional thing But we didn't.

525
00:35:18,605 --> 00:35:25,060
Scott: we got the least professional Professional thing because it was the cheapest thing that met our needs and we didn't have another choice.

526
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:28,800
Rym: Now the thing is this thing is badass and it met all of our needs a hundred percent.

527
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,429
Rym: It's got two XLR inputs phantom power.

528
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,014
Rym: It's got a million different modes.

529
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:33,836
Scott: the phantom power.

530
00:35:34,097 --> 00:35:34,960
Rym: It just takes flash.

531
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:38,679
Rym: It'll record like a hundred and seventy hours the way we've got it set up right now.

532
00:35:39,072 --> 00:35:45,360
Scott: Yeah The only complaints I have about the device is that it takes four double-a batteries and they don't last very long.

533
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:55,893
Scott: If you're actually recording they last about four hours not long enough considering the fact that with my 4 gig compact flash card I can record like an ungodly number of hours of audio.

534
00:35:56,294 --> 00:35:57,800
Rym: Luckily I can mitigate that.

535
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,354
Rym: I'm thinking of just buying a lithium battery pack for it.

536
00:36:00,474 --> 00:36:01,500
Scott: That sounds like a good idea.

537
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,740
Rym: They're not that much money surprisingly and they're actually made for this device.

538
00:36:04,908 --> 00:36:06,728
Scott: Yep Good things about the device.

539
00:36:06,788 --> 00:36:13,860
Scott: basically everything it records in high quality Even though a lot of people on the internet were complaining about the preamps on the device being shitty.

540
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:18,573
Scott: It's good enough for us and it's way better than any consumer product.

541
00:36:18,674 --> 00:36:19,717
Rym: It's good enough for 90% of people.

542
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:24,280
Rym: Yeah, I mean in the audio you can see the problems with the preamps.

543
00:36:24,622 --> 00:36:30,840
Scott: Those problems are not going to be apparent If it's really a problem for you and you need perfect quality.

544
00:36:31,182 --> 00:36:34,197
Scott: There are people that are actually selling this device with.

545
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:44,859
Scott: they Replace the preamps for you with better ones and then sell you the device And if you really need it that you can go that route, of course You could also just use the line in and use your own preamp, huh?

546
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:45,982
Scott: Huh?

547
00:36:46,383 --> 00:36:52,220
Scott: Yeah, but basically the thing it records it plays back it can record multiple tracks.

548
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:53,812
Scott: It can auto level.

549
00:36:53,832 --> 00:36:54,598
Scott: it can.

550
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:56,505
Scott: God, it does.

551
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:59,602
Scott: every can edit the audio on the device You could.

552
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:10,920
Scott: the device is a USB drive so you can just get the audio off or you can take the compact flash out And plug it into a compact flash reader and get the files that way because they're just waving mp3 files and they just work.

553
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:16,060
Rym: Yep, and I side effect of that is if you need to you can use this as a straight-up card reader in your computer.

554
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:18,710
Scott: Yeah, if you need a compact flash reader, the problem is is a one.

555
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,320
Scott: it's a USB 1.0 compact flash readers.

556
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,091
Scott: It's a little bit slow, but it's it's frickin useful as all hell.

557
00:37:25,151 --> 00:37:27,398
Rym: It's got a pretty good stereo mic built in.

558
00:37:27,418 --> 00:37:34,040
Scott: Yep Yeah, if you just put it on a table and push record without using any external microphones it can record pretty well.

559
00:37:34,402 --> 00:37:36,397
Rym: I recorded almost everything we did at Otakon.

560
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:37,845
Rym: most of that I'm not gonna put in the show.

561
00:37:37,905 --> 00:37:42,540
Rym: the quality is not good enough, but not because of the device But just because of the setup of recording.

562
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:49,560
Rym: Yeah part of that is due to the fact that as much as I love Otakon Their AV teams are really good except for giving me an audio feed.

563
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:56,680
Rym: Every time I ever try to get an audio feed out of them It's the signal-to-noise ratio is to the point that it's absolutely useless.

564
00:37:56,786 --> 00:37:59,327
Scott: Yeah because basically at Otakon there's these people.

565
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:12,820
Scott: they contract out all their AV to a company I called DSL and They provide the projectors and the screens and the audios and the microphones and the mixers and all that stuff To all the rooms at Otakon that need AV and they do a good job.

566
00:38:12,983 --> 00:38:27,831
Scott: and you know you always see the DSL techs running around doing what they're supposed to do and they get the job done, but Because this is equipment that's used often in a lot of conventions and things and It's you know that company makes a lot of money if they don't replace their equipment.

567
00:38:28,112 --> 00:38:32,018
Rym: also as I look the way they set the equipment up is Not optimal for what I want to do.

568
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:40,650
Scott: Also, basically all they care about is people sitting in front of the room talking to a microphone and the audio comes out of the Speakers without hurting people.

569
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:41,940
Scott: that's what they care about.

570
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:51,800
Scott: So making sure that the signal-to-noise ratio is good or that it's nice It'll be a nice recording signal coming out of their mixer is not one of their high priorities.

571
00:38:53,020 --> 00:39:05,032
Rym: So it's difficult to record panels at Otakon through the equipment at least Yeah, but anyway, since I have this device and we have all that recording time We're recording everything we do mostly so we can listen to ourselves and improve.

572
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:06,276
Rym: Yep, which is good.

573
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:07,600
Rym: And you know archival footage.

574
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:11,754
Rym: Maybe we'll make some Specials or extras out of funny things that might have happened.

575
00:39:12,378 --> 00:39:12,519
Scott: Yep.

576
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:20,207
Scott: So in the end if you're someone who needs to record audio out in the wild You can get a piece of crap.

577
00:39:20,669 --> 00:39:34,720
Scott: if that suits your needs if you don't care about quality or anything like that And you don't care about using pan in the ass software to actually get the audio off The device or if you never even want to get the audio off the device at all Then there's plenty of things you can just pick up for like 50 bucks at the store.

578
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:42,145
Scott: if you need something better than that, you're pretty much gonna have to buy something professional or Suffer with a lesser solution.

579
00:39:42,185 --> 00:39:51,840
Scott: that doesn't do everything you want and the lowest professional thing will do everything you want and probably more Than what you want unless you are a professional and it sucks.

580
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:59,486
Rym: Yeah, though what this has all taught me and I've been leaning this way before I think I've talked about it once or twice But now I'm pretty much solid in this belief I've.

581
00:39:59,506 --> 00:40:02,486
Rym: there are only two Classes of purchases for me in my life.

582
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:11,372
Rym: at this point if I need something I will either buy the cheapest thing that will get Job done minimally or I'm going to buy exactly what I want.

583
00:40:11,472 --> 00:40:14,260
Rym: I'm not gonna buy some middle-ground compromise anymore.

584
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:15,620
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

585
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:21,050
Scott: Basically if I need to do something I'm either gonna get the Pete the most bargain.

586
00:40:21,111 --> 00:40:23,860
Scott: I can get something that does the job for like five bucks.

587
00:40:23,982 --> 00:40:24,960
Rym: Like what I do with cell phones.

588
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:31,951
Rym: I take whatever cell phone is free no matter what until the perfect cell phone arrived which currently doesn't exist at for a price I'm willing to actually I'd say it doesn't exist at all.

589
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:35,158
Scott: doesn't exist not in the US anyway Which means it's not perfect for me.

590
00:40:35,661 --> 00:40:41,808
Scott: So yeah, I'm gonna buy the cheap bargain thing for five bucks that gets the job done Even though I have to suffer.

591
00:40:41,828 --> 00:40:43,880
Scott: I save a lot of money on it and I get the job done.

592
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:56,145
Scott: I don't care unless the perfect product exists that fits my needs exactly in which case I will pay almost any price and I will get that device and Portable audio recorders.

593
00:40:56,205 --> 00:41:01,560
Scott: Basically we bought the bargain price and it basically didn't get the job done.

594
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:04,760
Rym: Not only did it not get the job done it got broken immediately.

595
00:41:05,142 --> 00:41:13,672
Scott: So we basically we bought the cheapest thing that will get the job done while simultaneously Buying something expensive that meets all our needs.

596
00:41:13,692 --> 00:41:15,320
Scott: because they were the same product.

597
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:18,515
Scott: Cuz nothing less than that would have gotten the job done.

598
00:41:18,535 --> 00:41:20,422
Scott: Oh So sad.

599
00:41:20,442 --> 00:41:24,475
Rym: so so I gotta say this thing is worth every single single freaking penny.

600
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:25,177
Rym: We've spent on it.

601
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:26,060
Rym: This thing is beautiful.

602
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:39,413
Scott: Yeah, the only thing I can say that I'm disappointed about it Is that from the pictures online it looked like it was going to be one of those heavy Really rugged rubberized like, you know, you could kick it across the room professional black

603
00:41:39,615 --> 00:41:39,919
Rym: really

604
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:45,935
Scott: Dangerous devices but upon further inspection, it's relatively light which I guess is good.

605
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:49,025
Scott: weight wise because carrying it around But it's not.

606
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,814
Scott: it doesn't feel like it's the strongest plastic.

607
00:41:51,874 --> 00:41:52,436
Scott: It is though.

608
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:56,254
Scott: You could kick it across the room But it doesn't have that feel of.

609
00:41:56,695 --> 00:41:59,220
Scott: I am tough and badass and you could beat the shit out of me.

610
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:02,019
Rym: So you're saying that perception matters more than reality to you?

611
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:05,008
Scott: What I'm saying is that I really like that.

612
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:10,769
Scott: when devices are all rubberized and have the thick plastic in this one I thought it was gonna be like that and it was not.

613
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,095
Rym: we could rubberize it.

614
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:16,215
Scott: Ooh That might interfere with the internal microphone of the speaker though.

615
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,180
Rym: It doesn't matter.

616
00:42:17,261 --> 00:42:25,480
Rym: My only real complaint is the internal microphone is pretty good in stereo But it's not great and I think I'm still gonna have to drop like a hundred bucks or two on a real boundary microphone.

617
00:42:26,081 --> 00:42:31,199
Scott: Yeah, a boundary microphone is also something we've been looking into and I think we'll just tap.

618
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:34,353
Scott: maybe We're not gonna need one for a long while now.

619
00:42:34,474 --> 00:42:35,700
Scott: So let's just hold off on that.

620
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,705
Scott: Yes, I mean it's something.

621
00:42:36,785 --> 00:42:38,171
Rym: earliest is gonna be December.

622
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:39,357
Scott: We're not probably not even gonna need it.

623
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:41,487
Rym: then February will definitely need.

624
00:42:41,507 --> 00:42:44,360
Scott: we're gonna need one in February probably maybe earlier for uber con.

625
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,864
Scott: Maybe you're right.

626
00:42:45,924 --> 00:42:49,300
Rym: It depends cuz I kind of want to record a whole session of burning wheel.

627
00:42:49,685 --> 00:42:50,679
Scott: Mmm, good call.

628
00:42:51,521 --> 00:42:56,080
Scott: But yeah, we won't need one for a few months at the least in six months at the most probably.

629
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:58,674
Scott: So we'll hold off on that and buy other things instead.

630
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:06,771
Rym: But yeah at any rate I'm sorry, if this was a little bit slower than our normal format of GeekNights a little less give-and-take I was avoiding talking as much as I can.

631
00:43:07,012 --> 00:43:15,380
Scott: let myself avoid talking and Fix your throat for tomorrow cuz I don't want to have to talk about some video game or something with alone.

632
00:43:15,602 --> 00:43:16,469
Rym: I expect by tomorrow.

633
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:17,800
Rym: We'll be back at our full stride.

634
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:23,394
Rym: So if you get a judge GeekNights based on episodes you're listening to I'd listen to at least one more before you judge.

635
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:24,320
Scott: It's not just awesome.

636
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:34,520
Scott: How when you know when we create the theoretical influx of new listeners from convention season We make the crappiest shows we can make and we mess up putting an episode online.

637
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:41,599
Rym: And yeah It might be something to do with the fact that we always go out of town for pretty much two weeks Right after we get all these new listeners.

638
00:43:42,282 --> 00:43:45,954
Scott: Maybe that's not the best strategy for listeners, but it's a great strategy for us.

639
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:46,395
Scott: Yes.

640
00:43:46,556 --> 00:43:47,298
Rym: I needed that week.

641
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:49,510
Rym: God damn Yeah, yeah.

642
00:43:49,772 --> 00:43:54,703
Scott: Oh well Tune in the rest of the week and by next week We'll be proud.

643
00:43:54,783 --> 00:44:03,319
Scott: next week will probably be like the best for awesome episodes of GeekNights ever Assuming that every episode of GeekNights is better than the last and assuming that none of us die.

644
00:44:04,181 --> 00:44:05,042
Scott: That could happen.

645
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:06,445
Scott: I might poison you.

646
00:44:13,516 --> 00:44:16,060
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

647
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,290
