1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,377
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 18th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:09,638
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:13,386
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,874
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:19,749
Rym: Tonight, we talk about voice acting and voice actors and that whole space.

6
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:22,708
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:29,930
Rym: So tonight begins the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the New York Rangers.

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,450
Scott: Well, we're gonna lose, almost definitely.

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,770
Rym: Scott is obligated to say that for fear of angering various gods, I guess.

10
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:38,654
Scott: Well, no.

11
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:39,946
Scott: In this case, I actually don't.

12
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:43,866
Scott: If you watched, I saw all three or four games.

13
00:00:43,926 --> 00:00:44,810
Scott: I don't remember how many.

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,925
Scott: We played against this team this season.

15
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:47,509
Scott: It was four.

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,449
Scott: Not crushed like every time.

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,210
Scott: The one game we won was because Georgia had some amazing shutout.

18
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,390
Scott: The other three games, they completely dominated us.

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,123
Scott: I saw two of those games in person.

20
00:00:58,143 --> 00:00:58,930
Scott: We just got crushed.

21
00:00:59,330 --> 00:00:59,398
Rym: Yep.

22
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,950
Scott: They are the rock to our scissors.

23
00:01:03,172 --> 00:01:03,674
Scott: But you know what?

24
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:04,397
Scott: I don't care.

25
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,210
Scott: I am happy to have just made it this far.

26
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,830
Rym: I mean, the game seven that we just watched, what was the prize?

27
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:11,950
Rym: At least four more hockey games.

28
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,970
Scott: That was, yeah, but two of them at home, right?

29
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,332
Scott: So it's like.

30
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:17,529
Scott: all I wanted was some playoff games at MSG.

31
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,669
Scott: I got more than I expected to get.

32
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:24,850
Scott: And I am satisfied and my expectations have been fulfilled.

33
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:28,329
Scott: And anything from here on out is just bonus gravy.

34
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,190
Scott: I'll be thrilled if we get even more.

35
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,470
Scott: But I don't, I'm okay because the sooner it ends, right?

36
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,450
Scott: It's like a win-win either way at this point, right?

37
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,010
Scott: If we keep going, obviously that's a win because we win more, right?

38
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:41,528
Scott: That's great.

39
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:50,110
Scott: But if we lose, the sooner we lose, A, the sooner I can just stop spending my nights watching hockey and do something else.

40
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,450
Scott: Enjoy this nice weather, go outside or whatever.

41
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:55,670
Scott: And B, that'll save us a lot of money.

42
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:03,190
Scott: Because every time the Rangers make more games happen at home, the garden comes and just takes money from us because we clicked.

43
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,070
Scott: And we clicked a button that said yes, you can do that.

44
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,126
Rym: And that amount of money goes up.

45
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:09,369
Rym: As deeper it gets, the more that number goes up.

46
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:15,870
Scott: And as soon as there stop being more games, I can get rimmed to compensate me for most of that money.

47
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,290
Rym: Yeah, because I might have used a significant percentage of those tickets.

48
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:27,770
Scott: I looked at the numbers and sadly, it's not going to be so straightforward to calculate how much money you have to give me.

49
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,369
Scott: But I came up with a formula that I think is fair.

50
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:35,949
Rym: Oh, because we don't know the price of the individual games anymore or something like that?

51
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,750
Scott: So, I mean, no one listening gives a shit.

52
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,270
Scott: But basically, we know the prices of the playoff games exactly, right?

53
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:53,370
Scott: The prices of the regular season games, if we divide the total amount paid by the number of games, including preseason games, then there is a number.

54
00:02:54,071 --> 00:03:06,289
Scott: But last season, when it ended early because of the pandemic, there were three games of six total tickets in which we were compensated for those games with credit to the current season.

55
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:14,950
Scott: And the amount credited was more per ticket than an even division of the total price.

56
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,730
Scott: So that means that we don't know the actual face value of all the tickets.

57
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,990
Scott: I could just assume that that price is the price of the regular tickets and then price down the preseason tickets.

58
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,096
Scott: But then we've also got to worry about.

59
00:03:30,397 --> 00:03:34,490
Scott: there were games where we sold the tickets to third parties and we got random amounts of money.

60
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:39,050
Scott: And there were games that we gave away for free to people, right?

61
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:46,430
Scott: And there were also free gift card monies that you used entirely to buy one jersey.

62
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,410
Scott: So you owe us back two-thirds of the gift card monies.

63
00:03:51,270 --> 00:04:00,030
Scott: So with all those things combined, I think I have to deploy a percentage-based formula for the non-playoff games.

64
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:01,389
Rym: It's probably close enough.

65
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:06,405
Rym: So the first game at home, I guess, will be on Sunday at like 3.30 p.m.

66
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,059
Rym: In the news.

67
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,072
Rym: So last time I went to Anime Central was 2003, is what I want to say.

68
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,238
Scott: Four lifetimes ago.

69
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:20,922
Rym: I went in 2002.

70
00:04:20,922 --> 00:04:23,680
Rym: I went again in 2003.

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,659
Rym: There were some of the best anime cons I've ever been to for a lot of reasons.

72
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:35,340
Rym: Never bothered going back, but I'd always heard until yesterday with this news good things about Anime Central.

73
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,300
Rym: It was one of the larger anime cons, like one of the biggest ones in the Midwest.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,220
Scott: I can imagine if we lived in the Midwest, that would have been like our Otakon instead of Otakon.

75
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,380
Rym: Yeah, it seems like it was big and solid and just continuing to get better, just like pretty much all anime cons were.

76
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,120
Scott: Or maybe it would have been our anime Boston, you know, but anyway.

77
00:04:53,164 --> 00:04:53,980
Rym: So what happened?

78
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,737
Scott: Or Anime NYC.

79
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:57,278
Scott: Which I've never been to.

80
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,260
Rym: As you know, there is a global pandemic continuing.

81
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,218
Rym: It's killed a million people here.

82
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,519
Scott: It's gotten worse.

83
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:07,240
Rym: In fact, it's getting worse and worse and worse right now.

84
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,379
Rym: A bunch of my coworkers have it.

85
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:12,419
Scott: I have some ill coworkers and I am now again hiding.

86
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:21,780
Scott: I'm only doing inside activities, outside activities, and going to hockey games with the most ridiculous, most powerful mask that hurts my face.

87
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:28,840
Rym: But even now, so one of my coworkers got it right around when I got it, even though I didn't interact with him like a couple months ago.

88
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,399
Rym: He just got it again.

89
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:31,904
Scott: Mm-hmm.

90
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:32,759
Scott: Mm-hmm.

91
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,220
Rym: Yup.

92
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:47,380
Rym: So anyway, pretty much all fan conventions, except for Paxis and a handful of others, have basically dropped all of their vaccine requirements and mask mandates and basically anything that was even making them remotely safer.

93
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:48,599
Rym: Can't say safe.

94
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:50,054
Scott: Even Paxis.

95
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,736
Rym: Which did everything as well as you can do it, still had one of the staff die of COVID.

96
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,380
Scott: Right, Paxis killed somebody, right?

97
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:10,180
Scott: It's like someone made a thread that was basically, I was going to write something along those lines of Paxis killed somebody, which is absolutely true, but someone else wrote it even more angrily than I did, right?

98
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:27,320
Scott: Which is like, you know, it's like no, even the best gaming convention in the universe, right, is not worth, you know, to make it happen, the price of somebody dying before they would have died otherwise is too high a price to pay for just about anything.

99
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:30,878
Scott: So outside of COVID situations- Let alone just some gaming con.

100
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:36,420
Rym: So does that apply to non-COVID things like someone trips in the stairwell?

101
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:39,489
Scott: I mean, it depends.

102
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,480
Rym: It's like, you know- Someone gets drunk at the con and drunk drives and dies?

103
00:06:45,901 --> 00:07:01,800
Scott: The difference here is that you know that- Oh yeah, yeah, COVID- By having the convention, you are creating, you know, this particular scenario of a large amount of people in an enclosed space while the, you know, a deadly virus is there.

104
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:07,040
Scott: It's like, you know, the conditions for someone falling down a stairwell exist everywhere there are stairwells, right?

105
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,880
Scott: That stairwell person might have fallen down the stairwell in their home or their office or a business or wherever, right, if they didn't come to the con.

106
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,179
Scott: That condition is just existing because stairs are a thing.

107
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:24,180
Scott: But by creating the con, you are creating a new dangerous circumstance that would not have otherwise existed.

108
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:33,700
Rym: So, I have one other question because this is the question everyone's gonna have to grapple with and I do not think that I'm arguing anything here in particular.

109
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:40,160
Rym: But based on what the CDC's been saying, this might be as good as it gets forever.

110
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:43,580
Rym: It's entirely possible.

111
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:52,440
Rym: And if that's true, then the choice becomes are there cons again at all or not, full stop, with this being the deadly environment.

112
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:56,979
Scott: I mean, you know, if there's...

113
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,140
Rym: Like, what if COVID is just endemic forever because of all the failures of governments?

114
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,820
Scott: Well, endemic is different from what we have now, right?

115
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:05,889
Rym: Well, it might not get better than this.

116
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:07,740
Rym: This might be what it looks like when it's endemic.

117
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:17,700
Rym: There's two or three waves a year, there's booster shots one or two times a year, but they're not 100% effective, and there's just people die of it for the rest of our lives.

118
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:20,538
Scott: I mean, that could be a thing.

119
00:08:21,582 --> 00:08:24,139
Rym: That seems to be the most likely course.

120
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:33,659
Scott: Let's say that, you know, tornadoes come through once a day and that's just a thing, right?

121
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,059
Scott: Everywhere.

122
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:35,506
Scott: There's no hiding from it.

123
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:36,672
Scott: It's an earth-wide thing.

124
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:38,340
Scott: Wherever you live on earth, tornadoes...

125
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,999
Rym: I mean, that's kind of what it was like in the summer when I was in Michigan as a kid.

126
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:43,126
Scott: Right, but I mean, I'm saying everywhere.

127
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:43,769
Scott: There's no running.

128
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:46,240
Scott: There's no living somewhere else as an alternative, right?

129
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:51,634
Scott: So in that case, it's like, well, you hide in the basement once a day, right?

130
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:54,080
Scott: That's what you would just do, right?

131
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,219
Scott: It's like to avoid the once a day tornado, you would hide in the basement once a day.

132
00:08:58,483 --> 00:08:59,750
Rym: So what if it could come at any time?

133
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,400
Rym: Then you're not going to like stay home.

134
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,780
Scott: You have to be prepared to get to a basement at any time and expect to use the basement once a day.

135
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,066
Scott: No.

136
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,080
Scott: Right?

137
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:11,248
Scott: It's just unless you are, you're not going to just walk around.

138
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:13,234
Scott: You're not going to say, "Tornadoes every fucking day.

139
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:13,554
Scott: You know what?

140
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,359
Scott: Today, I'm going to stay outside when the tornado

141
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:15,660
Scott: comes.".

142
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,393
Scott: That's your last day, right?

143
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:18,219
Scott: You're not going to do that.

144
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:27,720
Scott: So if COVID is just like this for the rest of our lives, you're not just going to go and eat inside at a restaurant, right?

145
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,337
Scott: It's like we're going to change our, hopefully change our society.

146
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,304
Rym: I don't think we will, though.

147
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:35,955
Rym: I am very confident society will literally 100% give up if that's true.

148
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:50,800
Scott: Well, if COVID really does stay like this for a long enough period of time... The people who give up, right, will die.

149
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,579
Rym: Up off percentage of the world.

150
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,300
Scott: Eventually, the people who are left are the people who aren't the give up people.

151
00:09:58,261 --> 00:09:59,085
Rym: Not necessarily.

152
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:02,160
Rym: The death rates are not that high to cause that type of outcome.

153
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:04,144
Scott: But who knows?

154
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:05,872
Scott: It could be a strain that comes through, right?

155
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:06,977
Scott: We never know.

156
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:11,044
Scott: The point is, I'm not going to stop.

157
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:17,440
Scott: If tornadoes came every day, even if for 10 years, 20 years, I would never go outside during the tornado.

158
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,562
Rym: Alright, so I just have a question for you.

159
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:26,940
Rym: If it's about, not the current spike, but the otherwise general background, if it stays around this level forever, will you ever go to a con again or you'd never go to a con again?

160
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:30,140
Scott: I guess it's going to depend, right?

161
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:46,380
Scott: Unlike the daily tornado, there could be circumstances in which the convention... Okay, they had the convention during a time when the numbers are mega low, and the circumstances of the convention are good.

162
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,432
Scott: The convention itself is going to be so good that it's worth going to, etc.

163
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,940
Rym: Because one thing that's almost definitely not going to happen, I doubt any cons will have masks or vaccine mandates by next year.

164
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,889
Scott: Yeah, I mean, we're going to Madison Square Garden for three hours.

165
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:09,420
Scott: There's no mask mandate, but I wear the most serious mask available, and so far it's worked.

166
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,760
Rym: And we're also some of the only people who are wearing masks in the whole arena.

167
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,559
Scott: Right, so it works even though it's a one-way mask.

168
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,517
Rym: Well, TVD, if it works or not, we might just be lucky.

169
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:18,899
Rym: so far.

170
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,671
Scott: It works so far.

171
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:21,619
Scott: That's why I said so far.

172
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,894
Rym: Anyway, Anime Central is in a unique case, and they have fucked up badly.

173
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:30,320
Rym: This is like an unrecoverable situation.

174
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,256
Rym: So they had vaccine requirements, like PAX does, and they had a mask requirement, and they were going to do their event.

175
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:37,420
Rym: They're still going to do their event.

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:50,360
Rym: They had announced officially, weeks ago, that to clarify, because people were worried that the rules would change, that the rules would not change before the con.

177
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:54,220
Rym: That masks were going to be required, and the vaccine checks were going to happen.

178
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:04,860
Rym: Yesterday, maybe two days ago, they officially announced that they're dropping the mask mandate, and they're dropping the vaccine requirement, and they're not giving refunds to anyone.

179
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:12,440
Scott: Well, see, forget, you know, passing about the discussion about, you know, putting lives at risk to just have an anime con, right?

180
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:22,280
Scott: It's like, if you have a thing, and you sell the thing, and then you change your mind about what the thing is after you sold it.

181
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,913
Rym: And the thing has a disclaimer saying that they can basically screw you over without any recourse at any time.

182
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:30,520
Rym: Every convention in terms of service has something like that.

183
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:36,819
Scott: They do indeed, but invoking such a clause still makes you a piece of shit, regardless.

184
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,240
Scott: It's like, yes, legally, you can do this, but the fact that you did this, go fuck yourself.

185
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,160
Rym: Now, they're doing it with the same rationale that every other nerd convention did it with.

186
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,800
Rym: The government let us do it, so we're good.

187
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,822
Rym: Well, they're not even saying it.

188
00:12:50,842 --> 00:12:58,200
Rym: They're saying the government changed its guidelines, and the convention center is following those, so we have no choice but to follow those.

189
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,320
Scott: They could have done what AnimeNext did.

190
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,240
Rym: Now, what it appears, one thing that might be going on, it sounds like- AnimeNext did something different, didn't they?

191
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,180
Rym: AnimeNext has a very different contract.

192
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:10,659
Scott: I am aware, but I'm just saying.

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,598
Rym: Yes, but it looks like the convention center also said, "We're not gonna make our staff wear masks, nor are we gonna help you with your mask

194
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:19,019
Rym: bullshit.".

195
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:21,680
Scott: That's the Midwest.

196
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,721
Rym: Yep.

197
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:46,740
Rym: So, the only thing I really gotta say about this is, if you bought a badge to AnimeCentral, and you feel uncomfortable going now because of this ridiculous change, which is extra egregious considering they specifically said they would not do this, I would suggest you Google something called "credit card chargeback," and that is how you get a refund.

198
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,400
Rym: Thanks to the terms, right.

199
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:55,460
Rym: The con might ban you for life, but if enough of you do that, you're basically gonna ban AnimeCentral for life.

200
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:07,720
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, the terms of service of the ticket purchase, right, the terms and conditions, I guess, because it's not an internet service or whatever, but it's like, you're not gonna be able to go to small claims court to get the money back, right?

201
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:19,543
Rym: But, chargeback on the credit card- Oh, you almost definitely could go to small claims court and get the money back, because a convention like this, there is no universe where they show up to small claims court and you get- That's a good point.

202
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:23,697
Scott: But if they do show up, you're probably gonna lose, because they'll just point out the term and that's it, right?

203
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:24,400
Scott: There's no refund.

204
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:31,238
Scott: But, I guess if the judge is ornery, the judge might read that term on their own and say, "It says no refund.

205
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:31,619
Scott: Get out of

206
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:31,780
Scott: here.".

207
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:37,340
Scott: But, yeah, if they don't show up, there is a good chance you just win by default, because the judges just do that.

208
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,439
Scott: Especially if a thousand- I'm not a lawyer, I don't know.

209
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,020
Rym: Especially if thousands of nerds all sue them to small claims court simultaneously.

210
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:47,398
Scott: The credit card chargeback is much easier, right?

211
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,459
Rym: And the credit card company will pretty much have your back.

212
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,280
Scott: Yeah, the only penalty for that is gonna be that, you know, you get banned from Anime Central.

213
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:55,941
Rym: Yep.

214
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:57,284
Rym: It is possible.

215
00:14:57,385 --> 00:15:02,800
Rym: Anime Central could, like, basically sue you and try to send collections after you via the credit card and dispute it.

216
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,060
Scott: For the price of one- It would cost them more to send the collection person to- It absolutely would.

217
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,308
Scott: The money that they would get back for the price of one ticket.

218
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:14,000
Scott: Also, you could just get a different credit card or a friend to buy tickets to a future Anime Central.

219
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:24,560
Rym: Yeah, also, in my experience, it is- All I will say is that I have, many times in my younger, poorer life, been at anime conventions without a badge and no one has ever noticed.

220
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:35,473
Rym: But, anyway, the broader picture that you'll have to start thinking about is, this is pretty much, I'm confident, the last year.

221
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:40,400
Rym: any conventions are gonna even have the pretense of taking measures against COVID.

222
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:47,000
Rym: And everyone's gonna have to collectively decide how they're gonna proceed in terms of gatherings of any kind.

223
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:57,660
Rym: And based on the numbers I've seen, conventions have not seen that much of a drop-off in attendance this year so far, compared to pre-COVID times.

224
00:15:59,001 --> 00:15:59,161
Scott: Yep.

225
00:15:59,982 --> 00:16:07,014
Scott: I mean, you know, somewhere, right, there's a COVID virus factory and it's like rubbing its hand.

226
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:09,117
Scott: It's like, "Yes, I played the long game.

227
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,279
Scott: Yes, it is now

228
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:10,640
Scott: working.".

229
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:20,600
Rym: But there is this situation where the ship might have sailed and society has to decide how they want to live.

230
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:25,270
Rym: And I just can't imagine a future if, five years from now, masks were still required.

231
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,020
Rym: I think most people completely give up, regardless of the risks and consequences.

232
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:31,400
Scott: Well.

233
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:37,279
Rym: In some other news, this looks like an I-Nu-Oh trailer that you just sent me.

234
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,698
Scott: Yeah, we've been talking about I-Nu-Oh for a while, 'cause you know we're always waiting for big-time anime theatrical movies to come.

235
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:44,540
Scott: Those are our favorites.

236
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,320
Rym: Especially by the big directors like Yuasa, Makoto Shinkai.

237
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:52,959
Scott: Especially since I haven't watched a new TV anime in quite a while.

238
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,740
Rym: Oh yeah, you didn't watch Orbital Children, the best anime I've seen in at least six years.

239
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,020
Rym: Also Arkane, the best cartoon I've seen in the last decade.

240
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,224
Scott: We've been waiting for I-Nu-Oh for a while.

241
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,271
Scott: We've known about it for a few years now.

242
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:10,099
Scott: It's finally imminent, like next month imminent.

243
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,752
Scott: And here is a, sorta I guess a trailer, right?

244
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:16,720
Scott: With no English subtitles or dub or anything.

245
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:27,240
Scott: For that movie, and now you can really, this more than any clip I've seen previously, really tells you what the movie is gonna be like and about.

246
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:30,368
Scott: And it seems pretty hype, and I wanna see it.

247
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:34,540
Scott: Masaaki Yuasa has been terrific in almost everything that he's done.

248
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,269
Rym: Yuasa is already one of those greats.

249
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,620
Rym: I would wanna show you, when I say Batt in a Thousand, I have to look at the list.

250
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,060
Rym: Real close to Batt in a Thousand.

251
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Scott: Also of note, I didn't send Rym a Link for this, but there was Shin Godzilla, the live action movie directed by Anno, which was maybe the best or second best Godzilla movie thing ever made.

252
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:01,023
Scott: It was really good.

253
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,046
Scott: I loved it, anyway.

254
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,054
Scott: Most people I know loved it.

255
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:07,340
Scott: I guess there might be some who didn't, but whatever.

256
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,774
Scott: And there's been teasers coming through that they're gonna make a whole universe of like, Shin whatever, right?

257
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:16,300
Scott: Shin Ultraman, Shin Kamen Rider, right?

258
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,320
Rym: Expand this, give me Shin Snatch.

259
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:27,731
Scott: That's not a... But anyway, Shin Ultraman came out.

260
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:31,860
Scott: It is in the theaters in Japan now, and it is number one at the box office.

261
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,945
Scott: So, bring me the Shin Ultraman with English subtitles, quickly.

262
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:45,740
Scott: I never even... I can say I know what Ultraman is, but I've never watched an episode or a movie or anything of Ultraman ever.

263
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,980
Scott: I just know what Ultraman is and what he looks like and what his deal is because I'm a nerd.

264
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:52,878
Scott: But I still want to watch this movie.

265
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:05,380
Rym: So, in some other news that leads into our main bit a bit, Crunchyroll, there's a whole situation going on with anime voice acting in America for dubs.

266
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:07,580
Scott: Which gave us a great Wednesday show idea.

267
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,420
Rym: Yeah, and Crunchyroll and that sort of... In the main bit, we're gonna talk about voice acting just overall, not even just in anime.

268
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:22,640
Rym: But in the anime world, there's a lot going on here and you're gonna have to read this article and learn more about this whole space.

269
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,035
Rym: But to summarize, during COVID, voice acting was difficult to do.

270
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,560
Rym: It wasn't safe to do in person.

271
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:35,540
Rym: So a lot of it was done remotely, but doing it remotely did reduce the quality, greatly increased the expenses.

272
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:42,700
Rym: But it also opened up voice acting roles to a much broader and more diverse set of actors.

273
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:48,460
Rym: So there are a lot of positive and negative aspects of this opening up remote.

274
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:56,980
Rym: Simultaneously, Crunchyroll is responsible for most of the dubs that happened in America for anime.

275
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:06,120
Rym: And the studio they use is basically in Texas and they really want all the work to happen in Texas for a lot of reasons.

276
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,000
Scott: Well, they merged with Funimation, which was a big news when he talked about it.

277
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:15,560
Scott: That now there's basically one major anime player in the US now, The End.

278
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:21,800
Scott: It's not like the old days where there was so much competition and companies are starting and failing all over.

279
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:29,680
Scott: It's Funimation, Crunchyroll, they're on top but everyone else is on a much lower level.

280
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,480
Rym: So there's a group of voice actors trying to unionize.

281
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,440
Scott: If you're a voice actor to voice act anime, it's like that's the sole employer now basically.

282
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,713
Scott: The other companies, like say Discotek, they're not dubbing much.

283
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,980
Rym: And then other stuff is done like Disney will do something itself for a big Ghibli movie that they're going to release.

284
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:58,890
Rym: So all this is leading to a big conversation around how voice acting and dubbing gets done.

285
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,410
Rym: There's a big unionization effort.

286
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:07,550
Rym: There's voice actors who aggressively want to be back in the studio because the equipment they have at home sucks.

287
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,150
Rym: There's voice actors who are kicked out of the industry because unless they move to Texas, they can't get a job anymore.

288
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:20,850
Rym: This is all in the backdrop of Texas has turned into a failed fascist state to the point that a lot of people are fleeing Texas.

289
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:22,196
Rym: Rightly so.

290
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:23,184
Rym: So it's unethical.

291
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:31,370
Scott: If you're a business who cares about money, operating in Texas is great if you just care about money because like low taxes, low regulations.

292
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:40,670
Rym: But a lot of businesses are having to curtail their Texas operations because people who are qualified to do these jobs are fleeing the state at high rates.

293
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,790
Rym: And very few people are willing to move to Texas to take a job unless they're desperate.

294
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:47,687
Rym: So there's a lot going on here right now.

295
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:51,790
Rym: And it's hard to say where this is all going.

296
00:21:52,851 --> 00:21:58,109
Scott: One factor that I brought up on our Discord, which is when we were discussing this earlier today, which you should join.

297
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,510
Rym: Our Discord is pretty good.

298
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:00,652
Scott: Right.

299
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:03,810
Scott: Is that if you are a voice actor and you go to a studio.

300
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:04,591
Scott: Right.

301
00:22:04,651 --> 00:22:12,910
Scott: There is an engineer there, a sound engineer, audio engineer, and they're taking care of all the hardware, software, you know, mixing everything for you.

302
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,598
Rym: But also you're in a facility.

303
00:22:14,638 --> 00:22:15,884
Rym: There's a quiet room.

304
00:22:15,964 --> 00:22:17,270
Rym: There's the sound dampening.

305
00:22:17,891 --> 00:22:18,032
Scott: Right.

306
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:22,250
Scott: But the point is you can focus entirely on acting and your job.

307
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:22,651
Scott: Right.

308
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:28,010
Scott: If you voice act from home, there is no audio engineer for you.

309
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:29,950
Scott: You are now your own audio engineer.

310
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:33,890
Scott: You are being paid the same amount of money, presumably.

311
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:35,869
Scott: And you are now doing two jobs.

312
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:45,808
Scott: You could have a scenario where you give remote access to your computer to an audio engineer who's remote and they come in and they audio engineer you.

313
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:46,930
Scott: software wise.

314
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,969
Rym: So let me break down what that looks like if I because I'm an audio engineer.

315
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:58,050
Scott: But hardware wise, like they can't do anything for you other than like you can show them what your hardware looks like and they'll tell you what buttons to press.

316
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:05,130
Rym: It's even worse if I because I have done audio work for a few small video games.

317
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,709
Rym: I've done audio work for a bunch of things over the years, of course, producing gig nights forever.

318
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:17,149
Rym: And one of the things that I rely on is that I know the physical environment things are recorded in.

319
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:21,190
Rym: And I have built pipelines based on that.

320
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:24,150
Rym: I have a pipeline for Scott from home that took a while to set up.

321
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:26,249
Rym: I have a separate pipeline for if Scott is here.

322
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:27,841
Rym: I have one pipeline for me.

323
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:29,110
Rym: I have one pipeline for Emily.

324
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:42,530
Rym: If I have to merge audio, especially dialogue that was recorded in multiple separate environments, that increases my workload by an order of magnitude.

325
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:48,250
Scott: That is, I mean, you're still going to have to send in your recorded WAV files to be mastered, mixed, whatever.

326
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:48,792
Rym: Oh, yeah.

327
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:52,070
Rym: But now every WAV file needs bespoke work.

328
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:55,250
Rym: It's almost like color matching in film.

329
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:56,054
Scott: Right.

330
00:23:56,074 --> 00:23:58,850
Scott: Well, that person still has their job and they're doing that part of it.

331
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:04,990
Scott: But their job is now we're talking about the engineering that is done during the recording session.

332
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:12,508
Scott: The person who is at the board while the recording is happening, adjusting the levels and that sort of thing, that that job is now gone.

333
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:16,270
Scott: And this voice or remote and poor.

334
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:21,890
Scott: And now this voice actor has to do it themselves and isn't being compensated extra for doing that.

335
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:33,170
Rym: But I'm saying also the studio now has to hire more audio engineers or pay the people who are doing that work a lot more because they have to post work, not the during recording work.

336
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,691
Rym: Yeah.

337
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,729
Rym: The post work is a lot more than the pre-work.

338
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:37,611
Scott: Right.

339
00:24:37,732 --> 00:24:46,230
Scott: But now also write the forgetting about the the the the actual quality of the audio recording, like, you know, that quality.

340
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:51,370
Scott: But think about the quality of the acting of someone who is fully immersed in acting.

341
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:56,670
Scott: It has no other distractions versus someone who is acting and then has to adjust shit.

342
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:01,910
Scott: Also, also now has to do a worse job of acting as on one hand, remote recording.

343
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:12,070
Rym: As we noted before, there is direct evidence that it broadened the diversity of voice actors and gave a lot of what wider audience of people who are good at this job the ability to do it.

344
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:24,030
Rym: But it also really only became accessible to people who have those skills and had the equipment to be able to do this from home or they were subcontracting out and reducing their own salaries.

345
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,210
Rym: I don't there is no good answer to this.

346
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,850
Rym: I mean, obviously, we got to get this stuff out of Texas because I don't think Texas can be saved in the short term.

347
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,010
Rym: It's probably unethical to even send money to Texas.

348
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:44,590
Rym: But that aside, I can I don't see a way to resolve this because it is irrespective of all other externalities.

349
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:50,930
Rym: It is objectively higher quality work to do this in professional studios with people in person.

350
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:56,770
Scott: Well, I mean, it's also higher quality work to get all the actors in the studio together to sort of the cast.

351
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,962
Scott: I forget what the word for it.

352
00:25:57,982 --> 00:25:58,650
Scott: The ensemble.

353
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:00,400
Rym: Well, that's what we used to see.

354
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:01,829
Rym: That was in the early anime dubs.

355
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:10,830
Rym: American anime dubs were usually produced the way a lot of American cartoons were, where every voice actor's performances were recorded completely independently of each other.

356
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:12,969
Rym: And they'd be all merged together in post.

357
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,330
Scott: And the Japanese ones typically did the ensemble.

358
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:23,070
Scott: Now, obviously, the pandemic messes up your ensemble, even if you bring people in studio, regardless of what different countries practices were.

359
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:23,551
Scott: Right.

360
00:26:23,692 --> 00:26:29,930
Scott: But it's like if they actually cared about making the best dub, it's like they would do the ensemble thing.

361
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,514
Scott: Right.

362
00:26:30,554 --> 00:26:31,461
Scott: And they never did that.

363
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:32,710
Scott: So there was never a care.

364
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:42,670
Scott: So even worse, the best dub that the care is just get a dub because we've done the math and we figured out that if we only do subtitles, we won't get enough views.

365
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:47,630
Scott: And the money it costs to do the dub will get us this many more views, this many more sales.

366
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:50,690
Scott: And it comes out to be worth it as long as the dub is cheap enough.

367
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:57,450
Scott: And the quality of the dub, it's like it doesn't seem to is not going to increase the views and sales.

368
00:26:57,712 --> 00:26:59,489
Scott: So it's not worth it to them to do that.

369
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:00,391
Rym: Yep.

370
00:27:00,772 --> 00:27:03,059
Rym: And even worse, ensemble recording.

371
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:06,790
Rym: Like technically what Scott and I are doing now is an ensemble voice session.

372
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:07,817
Rym: The two of us.

373
00:27:07,998 --> 00:27:09,389
Rym: We have infrastructure set up to do this.

374
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:14,410
Rym: Let's forget how moderately complex it was to set this infrastructure up.

375
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:21,390
Rym: This literally doubles the post-production time I need to spend to get a GeekNights episode live.

376
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,017
Rym: It literally doubles it.

377
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,729
Rym: There's a bunch of extra work I have to do.

378
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:31,470
Rym: And that's just with two people where one, I sent Scott the fucking microphone he uses.

379
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,410
Rym: And two, I trust Scott to know how to set up a microphone.

380
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,869
Scott: Plug it into a box.

381
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:40,681
Rym: You set your levels the right way.

382
00:27:40,781 --> 00:27:41,504
Rym: There's stuff there.

383
00:27:41,564 --> 00:27:42,970
Rym: Your audio is well recorded.

384
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:51,090
Rym: But it's double effort just to have one person who's not in the studio in an ensemble recording.

385
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,506
Rym: And it doubles again for every additional person.

386
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:55,189
Rym: Ten people.

387
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:02,990
Scott: I don't think you're going to do a voice acting ensemble where everyone is remote because you're losing the whole interactive part of the people.

388
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:06,010
Scott: It's like in the delay on it wouldn't work, right?

389
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:08,961
Rym: Never mind the local time stamps.

390
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,450
Rym: The timing will be slightly off on every recording.

391
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:15,270
Rym: I have to fuck with Scott's audio because it's impossible to line up audio.

392
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,589
Rym: The clocks are not the same clock.

393
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:29,189
Rym: And even beyond that, have you noticed for the last three years, and it's not just GeekNights, many podcasts, many podcasts, the hosts talk over each other a little bit more than they used to.

394
00:28:29,732 --> 00:28:32,249
Rym: And they run over each other a little bit more than they used to.

395
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:35,279
Rym: That's because this is not real time.

396
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:38,650
Rym: There are slight delays and ebb and flow of the network infrastructure.

397
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:45,929
Rym: And those delays add up to the same thing you see in live news broadcasts where there's a pause like, "Back to you,

398
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:46,230
Rym: Andy.".

399
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:51,150
Rym: And there's a pause before Andy responds and says, "Thank you, John," and does his thing.

400
00:28:51,711 --> 00:28:53,790
Rym: So all of that combined makes it infeasible.

401
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,590
Rym: Never mind the fact that voice actors get paid shit because capitalism.

402
00:28:59,698 --> 00:28:59,890
Scott: Yep.

403
00:29:00,912 --> 00:29:04,390
Rym: And like you pointed out, I haven't watched a dubbed anime on purpose.

404
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,528
Rym: I can't remember the last anime I watched dubbed in purpose except Cowboy Bebop.

405
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,646
Rym: The dubs, I would never watch an anime dub.

406
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:15,130
Rym: Why would I?

407
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:20,209
Rym: Generally, any media, I'd like to see the original audio subtitles if I can.

408
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:27,030
Rym: And dubs almost, I think, are becoming more of a checkbox in the anime industry in America.

409
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:30,529
Rym: So they can say there's a dub and potentially syndicate on TV.

410
00:29:31,132 --> 00:29:35,050
Rym: And also an accessibility function for people who couldn't read subtitles.

411
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,653
Rym: And I think that's it.

412
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:43,749
Rym: So that's even more reasons beyond just the fact that it doesn't make them money, why the quality of the dubs actually doesn't really matter that much.

413
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:46,718
Scott: To the producer.

414
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,401
Rym: Yeah.

415
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,180
Rym: Or even to the consumers, frankly.

416
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:52,860
Scott: There are some consumers that care a lot and some that don't.

417
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,100
Rym: Yep.

418
00:29:53,221 --> 00:30:01,019
Rym: But I still get the impression the majority of people who watch anime to the level that they know Crunchyroll exists, care about anime, and are invested in it.

419
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,680
Rym: Those are the kinds of people who tend to watch things subtitled anyway.

420
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,850
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

421
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,136
Rym: So, I can only do this once.

422
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:17,770
Rym: Every year there's a song competition in Europe called Eurovision.

423
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:18,523
Rym: You might have heard of it.

424
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,910
Scott: What about the ripoff of America's Song Contest?

425
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,749
Rym: Oh my god.

426
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,745
Rym: So, Eurovision, I love Eurovision.

427
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:38,550
Rym: But I gotta say, 2022, as far as I have seen, I haven't watched every song, but I've seen most of them so far, it is one of the better Eurovisions of the last five years.

428
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:39,528
Rym: This is an above.

429
00:30:40,376 --> 00:30:41,190
Scott: By our measures.

430
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:41,630
Scott: Yeah.

431
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:48,990
Rym: In terms of what I want from Eurovision, 2022 is delivered in a way that the last four years of Eurovision have not.

432
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:51,030
Rym: This is a good Eurovision.

433
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,330
Rym: So, what I'm going to link to, my thing of the day, there are a bunch of great songs.

434
00:30:56,132 --> 00:31:01,530
Rym: But mine, my thing of the day is, every year in Eurovision there's that one song.

435
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:08,250
Rym: The song that people talk about and maybe make memes of or get stuck in their head and they laugh about.

436
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,429
Rym: The weird one.

437
00:31:09,891 --> 00:31:10,308
Rym: The one.

438
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:19,330
Rym: And this year I think that one is a song called Give That Wolf a Banana by a delightful band called Subwoofler.

439
00:31:19,972 --> 00:31:24,970
Rym: Whose shtick is that they're dressed up as yellow wolves and they sing about eating grandmas.

440
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,309
Scott: Wait, Subwoofler?

441
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:26,782
Scott: Yup.

442
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:27,394
Scott: Oh, like woof?

443
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:28,099
Scott: Like a dog?

444
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,946
Scott: Why wouldn't it be Subwoofer?

445
00:31:29,511 --> 00:31:30,930
Rym: It's Subwoofer.

446
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:34,030
Scott: So, Subwoofer.

447
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:34,430
Rym: Okay.

448
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,529
Rym: S-U-B-W-O-O-L-F-E-R.

449
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:44,346
Scott: Okay, but keeping the original word, subwoofer, woof, is like dogs.

450
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:45,570
Scott: go woof, so do wolves.

451
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,410
Rym: Oh, they're equally good.

452
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,048
Rym: The old meme was you have a big dog and that's a woof, you have a tiny dog and that's a subwoof.

453
00:31:51,412 --> 00:31:54,670
Scott: Right, but it's like, subwoofer also makes sense pun-wise.

454
00:31:55,271 --> 00:32:01,170
Scott: It's like, without seeing the word, you couldn't know which pun they were going for because both of them are valid.

455
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,370
Rym: Oh my god, I found another.

456
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,390
Rym: So, I'm going to link to this too because it would be cheating to use this twice.

457
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:17,990
Rym: I just found a video that Subwoofer put out officially that teaches you how to do the dance in their Eurovision performance.

458
00:32:19,612 --> 00:32:20,416
Rym: We can learn this dance.

459
00:32:20,456 --> 00:32:23,189
Rym: This is not harder than Mambileo.

460
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,049
Scott: Well, do your dance.

461
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,610
Scott: Maybe I will.

462
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,509
Scott: Dancing Rym TikTok.

463
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,249
Rym: I'll be making a Patreon exclusive, so what are you at?

464
00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:44,550
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, at least not recently at all, like actually many years ago already, there was a moment at which the United States turned off the analog over-the-air television.

465
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:44,900
Scott: Yep.

466
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:50,930
Scott: And we, I think we've used this thing of the day, like, you know, some broadcast like final moments stuff, right?

467
00:32:51,611 --> 00:33:00,828
Scott: But there was a time even before I was alive, which was the moment when, you know, it's like they had television running live 24/7, right?

468
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,112
Scott: In the United States, right?

469
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:11,050
Scott: Or at least, you know, much of it was live, but there was always a broadcast going 24/7 over the air and they only had black and white TV.

470
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:14,369
Scott: And then one day they had color TV.

471
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:28,910
Rym: And the way we've done, we've talked about this on GeekNights before, color TV just used extra signal space and trickery in the existing black and like the existing TV signals that worked on black and white TVs.

472
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:34,410
Rym: So you could broadcast something in color, but a black and white TV receiving it would work just fine.

473
00:33:35,124 --> 00:33:35,269
Rym: Yeah.

474
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,348
Rym: That's important for this.

475
00:33:36,617 --> 00:33:36,809
Rym: Right.

476
00:33:37,372 --> 00:33:41,365
Scott: But anyway, so it's like, okay, so you're, you're in the 1950s, sixties, whenever it was right.

477
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:49,030
Scott: And it's like you go out and you buy yourself, you got to be saved up some money and you got a black and white TV at home.

478
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,069
Scott: You go buy a color one.

479
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:50,930
Scott: Right.

480
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,349
Scott: And you set it up and you turn it on.

481
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:59,010
Scott: And it's like at that time, it's like, you know, it's like some of the channels going to be black and white.

482
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:01,010
Scott: And some of them went to color already.

483
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:01,161
Scott: Right.

484
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,450
Scott: Big time channels.

485
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:02,850
Scott: Right.

486
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:07,130
Scott: You know, because obviously they weren't selling color TVs before there were any color channels.

487
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:10,449
Scott: But the TV network also had to switch.

488
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,130
Scott: There had to be a moment and a precise moment for the dog in a channel.

489
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:15,010
Rym: Right.

490
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:20,850
Scott: A precise moment at the TV station where they said, all right, we're all broadcasting black and white pictures.

491
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:21,610
Scott: Right.

492
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,310
Scott: Well, we got new cameras in the studio.

493
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:28,330
Scott: And at this moment, we're going to switch and broadcast color over the air instead.

494
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:28,830
Scott: Right.

495
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,708
Scott: We're going to flip a switch.

496
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:41,350
Scott: And if you were watching TV at that moment on a black and white TV, you wouldn't realize you wouldn't really notice much happening, except maybe the image getting a little bit better, but still being black and white.

497
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:48,150
Rym: Or possibly getting worse because sets for TV were designed for black and white TV for a long time.

498
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:53,130
Rym: And they had to be designed differently for color for it to look good for a bunch.

499
00:34:53,130 --> 00:35:02,130
Scott: But sometimes the color image, you know, the source, the cameras were so much better that it's like if you're, you know, a lot of black and white TVs, a color signal would look better.

500
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,790
Scott: Even though anyway.

501
00:35:04,351 --> 00:35:05,234
Scott: But there was.

502
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:08,950
Scott: if you had a color TV, you'd be watching a TV channel that was in black and white.

503
00:35:09,131 --> 00:35:14,810
Scott: And if you happen to be watching at that one moment in all of history where the channel switched to color, what would you see?

504
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:26,130
Scott: Well, here's a YouTube video of a recording of the news in Iowa at the moment that this channel two in Iowa switched from black and white to color.

505
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:31,789
Rym: I love how he walks across to like the other set that they had built with a different set of cameras pointed at it.

506
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:32,734
Scott: Yep.

507
00:35:32,754 --> 00:35:33,178
Scott: Well, that's how.

508
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:34,570
Scott: that's how big of a switch it was.

509
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:34,811
Scott: Right.

510
00:35:34,831 --> 00:35:39,390
Scott: They had to switch these cameras, stop broadcasting those cameras, start broadcast.

511
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:39,611
Scott: Yep.

512
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:43,590
Rym: They even switch his love like after he gets to the new desk.

513
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:48,470
Scott: Well, they didn't have wireless ones in those days, so he had to eat the wire for the love he was using.

514
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,697
Scott: Just couldn't reach across to.

515
00:35:49,878 --> 00:35:52,030
Scott: he couldn't walk across the studio while wired up.

516
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,471
Scott: Right.

517
00:35:52,511 --> 00:35:57,048
Rym: So, you know, they did have back then, though, the only girl sure.

518
00:35:58,371 --> 00:35:58,732
Rym: S.M.

519
00:35:58,732 --> 00:35:59,994
Scott: 57.

520
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:00,235
Scott: Sure.

521
00:36:00,796 --> 00:36:08,090
Scott: But anyway, so yet here is exactly what you would have seen if you had a color TV in Iowa in whatever year this was.

522
00:36:08,451 --> 00:36:15,470
Scott: And we're watching the news when the whole network switched permanently from broadcasting black and white to broadcasting color.

523
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:23,029
Rym: In the moment, the geek guides book club book is nine, five, scam it within the next month or so.

524
00:36:23,331 --> 00:36:24,114
Rym: We'll just do the show.

525
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,399
Rym: I'm real.

526
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:26,865
Rym: I think this weekend I might even finish it.

527
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:27,990
Rym: It's a good book.

528
00:36:28,692 --> 00:36:33,950
Rym: I do want to read the sequels, even though the listener did say that the sequels weren't as good.

529
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:43,630
Rym: Well, they said two people said the sequels weren't as good, but they also said that the sequels focus on something very different in this universe from what the first book focuses on.

530
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:49,066
Rym: But what they said the second and third book focus on is actually the kind of thing I'm way into.

531
00:36:49,587 --> 00:36:50,350
Rym: So we'll see.

532
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,079
Scott: It could be sort of like Hyperion.

533
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:55,350
Scott: By the way, the author of Hyperion is awful.

534
00:36:56,552 --> 00:36:58,538
Scott: We learned that way after doing that episode.

535
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:01,949
Rym: Also, he got worse and worse as time went on.

536
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,778
Rym: And he's written a few good books, but he's a bad person.

537
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:06,740
Scott: Right.

538
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,729
Scott: But anyway, it could be like that where like the first book or two.

539
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:11,592
Scott: Right.

540
00:37:11,692 --> 00:37:12,736
Scott: It's like there's the story.

541
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:16,210
Scott: But then there's also like the book itself is, you know, a great book.

542
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,795
Scott: Bad people can make good things.

543
00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:18,036
Scott: Right.

544
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:21,850
Scott: But then after that, it's like not as good.

545
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,222
Scott: But there's that you still have some desire to know what happens.

546
00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:27,530
Scott: that could keep you going to reading bad books.

547
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,502
Rym: That's why I read all 14 books of The Wheel of Time.

548
00:37:30,904 --> 00:37:31,065
Scott: Right.

549
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,230
Scott: Same deal with Dune, right?

550
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:38,250
Scott: It's like you read this book and then, you know, you keep going because you want to know what happens, even though they're not good anymore.

551
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,733
Scott: But you just want to know what happens.

552
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:40,094
Scott: Yeah.

553
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:47,630
Rym: I started just reading wikis about shows and about books if I don't want to bother.

554
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,292
Rym: That's what I do.

555
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:49,516
Scott: Life's too short for that shit.

556
00:37:49,757 --> 00:37:50,058
Rym: Yep.

557
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,864
Rym: Love, for example, Attack on Titan.

558
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,590
Rym: First season, really intrigued.

559
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,015
Rym: Second season, got worried.

560
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:58,850
Rym: Went and read a wiki, realized there was no reason to watch any more of that show.

561
00:37:59,790 --> 00:37:59,890
Scott: Right.

562
00:37:59,951 --> 00:38:00,172
Scott: I can.

563
00:38:00,473 --> 00:38:04,570
Scott: If all I want to do is know what happens, I can do that in a lot less time than it takes to watch the whole thing.

564
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:05,151
Rym: Yep.

565
00:38:05,854 --> 00:38:09,610
Rym: Attack on Titan is kind of a stinker if you actually watch more of it.

566
00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:17,890
Rym: If you haven't watched the new Attack on Titan, my advice to you is if you have fond memories of the old one, just let them remain fond.

567
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,736
Rym: Don't go back and watch He-Man again.

568
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:22,205
Rym: That's all I'll say.

569
00:38:22,406 --> 00:38:22,707
Rym: It's bad.

570
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,092
Rym: So let's get into it.

571
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:27,037
Rym: Voice actors, voice acting.

572
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:32,070
Scott: We did a big news on voice acting, which gave us the idea to do an episode on it, which we never have done.

573
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,916
Scott: Obviously, we have no experience.

574
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:36,687
Scott: We have almost no experience voice acting.

575
00:38:36,707 --> 00:38:37,610
Scott: I'm not going to say zero.

576
00:38:38,031 --> 00:38:44,345
Rym: We have voice acted in a handful of zero-budget productions over the years.

577
00:38:45,488 --> 00:38:46,530
Rym: Like Valiant Denim.

578
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,093
Scott: One and a half.

579
00:38:47,516 --> 00:38:48,321
Rym: Yes, exactly.

580
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:49,570
Scott: That was the one I was thinking of.

581
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:57,024
Rym: I have recorded voice performances for two or three peoples, depending on what you count.

582
00:38:57,846 --> 00:38:59,650
Rym: They're audition tapes to be voice actors.

583
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:02,879
Rym: I've also recorded voice acting for some video games.

584
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,990
Rym: I've recorded voice acting for trailers for some Kickstarter.

585
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:10,709
Rym: I've got a little more direct experience, but I don't want to overstate that.

586
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:14,683
Scott: I've done narrating at the school play, which is sort of like voice acting.

587
00:39:14,783 --> 00:39:16,890
Scott: Only people can see you standing over there in the corner.

588
00:39:18,211 --> 00:39:20,575
Rym: I've been the emcee of many a function over the years.

589
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:23,942
Rym: I have narrated technical and instructional videos.

590
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:27,048
Rym: That's actually something I've done professionally for 20 years now.

591
00:39:28,892 --> 00:39:35,203
Scott: The point is that voice acting inherently is the same as acting acting.

592
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:37,267
Scott: Stage acting, movie acting, TV acting.

593
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:39,090
Scott: The only difference is that nobody can see you.

594
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:49,690
Scott: So you have to express the character that you are portraying only with the power of the sounds that you can make with your body.

595
00:39:50,632 --> 00:39:51,936
Scott: It doesn't have to be just your voice.

596
00:39:51,976 --> 00:39:55,806
Scott: You could use any part of your body or device that makes noises.

597
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:57,510
Scott: Usually it's just your voice, though.

598
00:39:58,391 --> 00:40:03,342
Scott: If they want to add noises of some other sort, the audio people can do that on their own.

599
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:06,350
Scott: They don't need the voice actors to do that other stuff.

600
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:13,342
Scott: You don't need to be in there voice acting a Star Wars cartoon, making lightsaber noises with your mouth.

601
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:15,828
Scott: They can add those in on their own.

602
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:16,430
Scott: They don't need you.

603
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,852
Rym: What was the thing I saw?

604
00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:30,629
Rym: where you can clearly see actors in one of the recent Star Wars' at a few points in the final cut of the movie clearly saying "pew pew" or making some sort of laser sound with their mouth as they're firing?

605
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:36,356
Scott: So there's sort of two major things going on.

606
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:44,710
Scott: One of them is that you have to have this ability to speak usually in a different voice than your natural voice.

607
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,793
Rym: Well, there's very much two kinds of voice actors.

608
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:50,941
Rym: There are professional voice actors who have an array of voices.

609
00:40:51,502 --> 00:40:55,510
Rym: They have a range of character voices they could do and they can make up new ones.

610
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:03,770
Rym: So you show them a character, you collaborate with them, and together you come up with the voice of a character that they then embody.

611
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:11,250
Rym: But then you've got people like John Benjamin who, everything they voice act, they sound the same and it's fine.

612
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:14,554
Rym: Or like Bender.

613
00:41:15,034 --> 00:41:28,770
Rym: Sometimes there's a voice actor, even if they can do multiple voices, either their natural voice is really good for voice acting or a voice that might have been part of their repertoire just became an iconic voice that they use for much of their career.

614
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,953
Scott: Rest in peace, Gilbert Gottfried.

615
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:38,720
Scott: The voice he spoke, whenever he was in public, that was not his natural speaking voice.

616
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,981
Scott: That is well known.

617
00:41:41,062 --> 00:41:47,209
Scott: I've heard his real "natural speaking voice" and it is not "Hey, I'm Gilbert

618
00:41:47,229 --> 00:41:47,609
Scott: Gottfried.".

619
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:53,656
Scott: But he just talked like that in every professional setting.

620
00:41:53,696 --> 00:41:57,902
Scott: If he was being interviewed, if he was voice acting, he had the one voice that he did.

621
00:41:57,942 --> 00:42:03,990
Scott: He didn't do other voices and he only used his natural voice in private settings.

622
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:18,030
Rym: Similar to GeekNights, if you see us do panels and you're listening to this, we're not acting acting, but the way we talk on a show like this is not how I talk when I'm just living my life.

623
00:42:19,215 --> 00:42:20,790
Scott: But that's not an intentional thing.

624
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:26,078
Rym: No it's not, but it's an artifact of the fact that we're talking to a microphone without an audience.

625
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:33,850
Rym: Also it's an artifact of the nature of a podcast, but we shout and yell and all this stuff that in real life we're a lot more subdued.

626
00:42:35,371 --> 00:43:06,770
Scott: The point is that even if you are a regular actor, stage, screen actor, people are seeing you, having the ability to have a natural voice that is particular, like say Sean Connery, have a voice that you do that is particular in some way, or have the ability to do lots of voices, are just tools of even a stage and screen actor.

627
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:26,310
Scott: So a voice actor is basically, it's like you just highly specialize in this one aspect of acting, which is that tool set only and not in expressing yourself with your facial expression or your hands, even though you might do those things as well, no one will see them.

628
00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:36,925
Scott: And this is why you do see often, especially productions with more money, can use stage and screen actors for voice acting because they also have those skills.

629
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:40,510
Scott: Voice actors just specialize in those skills exclusively.

630
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:50,927
Rym: So a thing that I think is worth noting is there has been a little bit of a change in this industry, not so much with anime, but with the rest of the voice acting world.

631
00:43:50,968 --> 00:43:52,250
Rym: I saw some articles about it recently.

632
00:43:53,331 --> 00:44:20,250
Rym: It's obvious in retrospect, if you think about what's popular, there is increasing demand for voice actors who are also professional singers because a lot of animated shows in particular have more and more music in them, which is drastically limiting the pool of people who are qualified to be both a professional voice actor who can do a character and who can sing professionally at the level that would be needed for a show.

633
00:44:20,731 --> 00:44:30,867
Rym: In the past, a lot of the way that was handled, even in movies, was to have someone who sounds kind of like the voice actor sing when the voice actor needed to sing.

634
00:44:30,887 --> 00:44:32,910
Rym: A lot of old Disney movies did that.

635
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:41,264
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it always comes across great because even in the real world, people, you know, just people you meet, it's like they sing in one way.

636
00:44:41,384 --> 00:44:45,070
Scott: and when they, you know, it's just meet a person who's a singer and isn't an actor at all.

637
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,711
Scott: They sing.

638
00:44:47,413 --> 00:44:50,178
Scott: They don't sound like they do when they talk, right?

639
00:44:50,218 --> 00:44:52,522
Scott: They clearly have a different singing voice.

640
00:44:53,664 --> 00:44:55,447
Scott: It might be related to the talking voice.

641
00:44:55,507 --> 00:44:56,990
Scott: It might not be, right?

642
00:44:57,251 --> 00:45:00,901
Scott: You know, there's even people who have like very strong accents, right?

643
00:45:00,982 --> 00:45:03,790
Scott: And their singing voice has a completely different accent, right?

644
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:12,309
Scott: It's like, you know, there's a thing people are like, "How come when people from the UK sing, they sound like they have a US accent,

645
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:12,650
Scott: right?".

646
00:45:12,731 --> 00:45:14,361
Scott: It's like there's a whole thing about that online.

647
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:15,790
Scott: You can look it up, right?

648
00:45:17,931 --> 00:45:22,962
Scott: So using someone else to do the singing part is not out of the ordinary.

649
00:45:22,982 --> 00:45:24,385
Scott: It totally works great.

650
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:26,450
Scott: Like the audience almost never knows.

651
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:33,170
Scott: But it is more expensive because you're hiring someone who is a professional singer first to do the singing.

652
00:45:33,612 --> 00:45:37,207
Scott: If you hire the one voice actor to do the singing and that, right?

653
00:45:37,227 --> 00:45:37,830
Scott: You can save money.

654
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:46,150
Rym: But it also greatly complicates the production because now you have to figure out in advance exactly what will be sung and won and get all those takes separately from the voice acting.

655
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,034
Rym: It's harder to change things on the fly.

656
00:45:48,475 --> 00:45:54,730
Rym: It's harder to have a character naturally come in and out of singing, which also is increasingly common.

657
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,830
Scott: Song recording is different from voice recording.

658
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:01,910
Rym: And I think that's only going to continue.

659
00:46:03,395 --> 00:46:05,310
Scott: As long as musicals are popular.

660
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:13,950
Rym: And right now, especially in animation in the US, musical animation is only getting more popular and only becoming a bigger piece of the pie.

661
00:46:15,292 --> 00:46:20,422
Scott: I think it's always been huge in children's content, right?

662
00:46:20,462 --> 00:46:23,930
Scott: There's always been songs, even if they're like little nursery rhyme type songs.

663
00:46:24,432 --> 00:46:27,029
Scott: That's just always been there, right?

664
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,806
Rym: So another aspect of all this...

665
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,215
Scott: It's spread more, right?

666
00:46:31,436 --> 00:46:37,350
Scott: I think The Simpsons did it once in a while, but then you had the other shows doing it frequently.

667
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:44,610
Rym: So another aspect of this is a lot of acting, but voice acting has particular concerns around this.

668
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:59,130
Rym: It is also not a sport in the competitive sense, but it requires a certain amount of physical luck in terms of are your vocal chords and lungs and head and face shape conducive to voice acting?

669
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:02,890
Rym: Like there are things that could get in your way, especially if you will play multiple characters.

670
00:47:03,492 --> 00:47:07,250
Rym: You can have injuries just like you could on the set of a play or the set of a movie.

671
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:09,780
Rym: A lot of voice actors destroy their voices.

672
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:11,730
Rym: It's a problem in the industry.

673
00:47:12,212 --> 00:47:15,410
Scott: You need vocal coaches, vocal training if you're going to do it, right?

674
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:19,240
Rym: I mean, Scott and I had to learn significantly.

675
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,650
Rym: We used to lose our voices after every major con, me way more so than Scott.

676
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:30,870
Rym: I had to learn to talk differently, and I talk differently with a microphone than I do in person just hanging out with people.

677
00:47:31,951 --> 00:47:38,203
Scott: Sure, but there are people who... It's like you might be able to talk in a really funny voice, right?

678
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:39,810
Scott: And you think I could be a voice actor, right?

679
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:43,790
Scott: All your friends are super entertained by your funny voices that you do, and you're great.

680
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:49,470
Scott: All right, go and do that funny voice for five, six hours, seven hours.

681
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,790
Scott: And also do the same lines over and over again.

682
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:57,410
Rym: You've got to say a line in that same funny voice, but it's a sad line.

683
00:47:57,591 --> 00:47:58,595
Rym: Can you still do it?

684
00:47:58,795 --> 00:47:59,739
Rym: Can you act it?

685
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,470
Rym: Or can you just do the facile voice?

686
00:48:03,112 --> 00:48:04,656
Scott: And the endurance aspect, right?

687
00:48:04,696 --> 00:48:09,790
Scott: It's like if you can't do it, then it's not an easy job at all, right?

688
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:20,590
Scott: And people, when they think of voice acting, especially when we do this on GeekNights Wednesday, you're mostly thinking about it in the context of cartoons and animation, right?

689
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:26,850
Scott: Animated content, whether it's computer-generated, hand-drawn, 2D, 3D, whatever, video games, right?

690
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:29,075
Scott: That's what you're thinking about.

691
00:48:29,095 --> 00:48:36,070
Scott: And the fact is there is a lot more content out there that requires voice acting than just those things.

692
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:39,110
Scott: Those are just the most visible things, right?

693
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:44,590
Scott: There are also lots and lots of, say, instructional videos that need narrators, right?

694
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:49,350
Scott: There are lots and lots of live-action things that are still dubbed, right?

695
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:50,755
Scott: You've seen Star Wars, right?

696
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:54,990
Scott: James Earl Jones, everybody knows, was not in the Darth Vader costume.

697
00:48:55,130 --> 00:49:01,550
Rym: Hell, a lot of old movies, but they still do this when they need to, less often because obviously it really hurts the acting.

698
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:14,470
Rym: A lot of movies, especially older movies, would do ADR and dub over the on-screen spoken lines of the actors because microphones weren't that good, especially in the past.

699
00:49:15,131 --> 00:49:24,710
Scott: Someone would go in and act in a movie, and then after they acted in the movie on the set, they would go into the audio booth and record their own voice over themselves.

700
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:29,219
Rym: And the worst part is it's so obvious that that was happening.

701
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,250
Rym: now that you can see a lot of these old movies and old TV shows in high-resolution remastering.

702
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:38,180
Scott: That's why it's really good if you have a Darth Vader who doesn't have a mouth that moves.

703
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,330
Scott: You can put any voice you want on there.

704
00:49:41,931 --> 00:49:58,010
Rym: Another really increasingly complex part of this is diversity in casting, especially because if you can't see the person, some people who are wrong try to argue that it doesn't matter if a white person plays a black person, for example.

705
00:49:58,552 --> 00:50:00,589
Rym: All that matters is the voice that comes out at the end.

706
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:25,290
Rym: And obviously that is not true, and obviously there's a lot of nuance in that whole conversation, but voice acting also requires a certain amount of expertise in accents, in language, in languages, in being able to learn and speak in particular accurate sub-dialects depending on what kind of character you're playing.

707
00:50:25,951 --> 00:50:28,930
Rym: These are technical, learned academic skills.

708
00:50:30,311 --> 00:50:36,368
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if you go out there, it's like, you know, I could do a Scottish accent, like, "Oh,

709
00:50:36,548 --> 00:50:36,929
Scott: milady!".

710
00:50:37,992 --> 00:50:44,930
Scott: And it's like, you know, it's like, if I do that, it's like, yeah, you realize that I'm making fun of Scottish voices, right?

711
00:50:45,511 --> 00:50:50,810
Scott: Which actually I think are cool, despite, you know, characters like Sean Connery and Scoop McDuck, right?

712
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:59,390
Rym: But look at Apu and the right and correct controversy around that accent and that voice acting.

713
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:07,110
Scott: I can say that every Scottish person that I have met and known to be, you know, have an acquaintance with has been a really cool person.

714
00:51:07,452 --> 00:51:07,648
Scott: So anyway.

715
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,429
Rym: In fact, I remember the cool Scottish dude that we ran into a few times.

716
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:13,569
Scott: That was one of the people I was just thinking of.

717
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,185
Rym: We went to the sci-fi museum together.

718
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:15,630
Rym: It was a good time.

719
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:20,050
Scott: There was also that engineer guy who was a Scottish person in New York who played games with a bunch.

720
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:20,916
Scott: That guy was cool, too.

721
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:21,623
Scott: I forget his name.

722
00:51:21,683 --> 00:51:22,410
Scott: Sorry, person.

723
00:51:23,152 --> 00:51:25,549
Scott: I think you listened to GeekNights at some point a hundred years ago.

724
00:51:29,251 --> 00:51:31,460
Scott: If I go and do that voice, right?

725
00:51:35,534 --> 00:51:37,750
Scott: It is nowhere near accurate, right?

726
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,210
Scott: It's so off, right?

727
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:42,004
Scott: It would drive a Scottish person wild to hear.

728
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:51,690
Scott: And if I'm doing that for a character, even if it was for, you know, if it was for a stereotype character, well, that's just offensive, right?

729
00:51:52,110 --> 00:52:05,930
Scott: And if it was for a character who was just like, you know, let's say it's a new My Little Pony and there's a pony with haggis on its ass or a golf club and a bagpipe on its ass, right?

730
00:52:06,234 --> 00:52:07,088
Scott: And I voiced that.

731
00:52:07,812 --> 00:52:09,950
Scott: It's like, that's not right.

732
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:12,834
Scott: It's like that character should sound like a Scottish person.

733
00:52:12,854 --> 00:52:13,335
Scott: sounds.

734
00:52:13,415 --> 00:52:22,890
Scott: you get a Scottish person or someone who has studied the Scottish accent so well and practiced it so much that they are on.

735
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:25,850
Scott: Think about which is probably going to be a Scottish person.

736
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:39,790
Rym: It would take to be a voice actor who is acting not just a correct Scottish accent, but the correct Scottish accent of a character who is currently intoxicated as opposed to not intoxicated.

737
00:52:40,131 --> 00:52:51,310
Rym: Or even worse, what if you are voice acting an Englishman in a period drama who is trying to do and failing to do a fake Scottish accent because he is a spy?

738
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:54,609
Rym: How good of a fucking voice actor do you have to be to pull that off?

739
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:56,147
Scott: You have to.

740
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,170
Scott: And then you're let's say you're a voice actor.

741
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,890
Scott: You it's like, OK, you've learned the Scottish accent, right?

742
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:02,109
Scott: Well, now you have to sing.

743
00:53:03,196 --> 00:53:04,089
Scott: And now you're right.

744
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:08,210
Scott: It's like, OK, you're even a really simple scene, right?

745
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:11,130
Scott: You're on a roller coaster and you have to scream.

746
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:15,090
Scott: It's like scream like a Scottish person screams on a roller coaster.

747
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:17,570
Scott: Fucking know that, right?

748
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:21,550
Scott: It's like voice acting is so hard, right?

749
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,609
Scott: It is this really hard job that doesn't pay enough.

750
00:53:24,511 --> 00:53:26,230
Scott: They got to work too hard, right?

751
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,468
Scott: It's underappreciated, et cetera, et cetera.

752
00:53:30,392 --> 00:53:46,490
Scott: And as we talked about in the news, most of the people producing dubs, right, especially for translated works, right, where they're producing a non native language dub, don't really give a shit about the quality.

753
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:52,910
Scott: And it's to the point where this is the old dub subs debate.

754
00:53:53,452 --> 00:53:55,009
Rym: Well, where's the point to this day?

755
00:53:55,512 --> 00:53:58,929
Rym: If they if I hear if you put something out in the other room and don't let us see it.

756
00:53:59,992 --> 00:54:06,250
Rym: Scott and I could with, I suspect, 100 percent accuracy tell you that it is one of three things.

757
00:54:07,315 --> 00:54:08,829
Rym: It is from an anime dub.

758
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:14,329
Rym: It is from a video game or it is from something else that is more professionally done.

759
00:54:15,477 --> 00:54:15,908
Scott: Pretty much.

760
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:16,787
Scott: Right.

761
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,869
Scott: But if they don't care about the quality of it.

762
00:54:20,279 --> 00:54:20,530
Scott: Right.

763
00:54:21,151 --> 00:54:25,630
Scott: Even if I am listening to actors in a language I don't know.

764
00:54:26,091 --> 00:54:26,195
Scott: Right.

765
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:31,710
Scott: You know, the original Japanese language or French language or whatever language the original language was.

766
00:54:32,831 --> 00:54:39,970
Scott: It's like whichever dub cast, the directors and the and the actors did the best job.

767
00:54:40,663 --> 00:54:40,890
Scott: Right.

768
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:54,630
Scott: It's like you, as long as you're able to hear it, it's like they can get across the emotions better than even someone else doing a worse job in your native language.

769
00:54:54,712 --> 00:54:55,629
Scott: And that is why.

770
00:54:56,283 --> 00:54:56,450
Scott: Right.

771
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:59,830
Scott: I don't go for the subtitles because it must be the native language.

772
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,910
Scott: I go for the subtitles because the acting is actually better.

773
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,650
Scott: That production was the production that did the best job of voice.

774
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:15,710
Rym: I mean, if I didn't have a job, I would try to learn languages of my favorite literature enough to read books in those native languages.

775
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:21,550
Scott: But I'm saying if somebody came and told me right that there was an anime made in Japan and it was a great anime.

776
00:55:22,253 --> 00:55:25,970
Scott: And the original language of the anime was Japanese.

777
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:30,710
Scott: But the Japanese voice actors fucking phoned it in and did a shit job.

778
00:55:31,671 --> 00:55:33,869
Scott: They they hired cheap actors who weren't any good.

779
00:55:34,036 --> 00:55:34,142
Scott: Yeah.

780
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:38,790
Scott: But that the Italian dub crew.

781
00:55:39,341 --> 00:55:39,590
Scott: Right.

782
00:55:40,113 --> 00:55:41,209
Scott: For the Italian audience.

783
00:55:41,744 --> 00:55:41,930
Scott: Right.

784
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,329
Scott: Did an incredible job.

785
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:45,610
Rym: I think I would watch it in Italian with English subtitles.

786
00:55:46,398 --> 00:55:46,648
Scott: I would.

787
00:55:47,172 --> 00:55:48,770
Scott: If I had that information available.

788
00:55:49,403 --> 00:55:49,550
Scott: Right.

789
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:54,210
Scott: And I knew that the English dub was also, you know, not not a high quality one.

790
00:55:54,854 --> 00:55:56,750
Scott: I would seek out the Italian dub.

791
00:55:56,878 --> 00:55:57,010
Scott: Right.

792
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:02,830
Scott: I want it's like if you had a choice, like you're watching a movie or you can't do this with with regular live action movies.

793
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:12,470
Scott: You can't be like, you know, you know, I would have really liked, you know, Star Wars better if instead of Mark Hamill, it was, you know, someone else.

794
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,019
Scott: Right.

795
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:15,149
Scott: Gilbert Gottfried.

796
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:15,305
Scott: Right.

797
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:20,990
Scott: It's like no matter what country you're in, if you got eyeballs and you watch Star Wars, there's you're looking at Mark Hamill.

798
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:21,849
Scott: That's who you're looking at.

799
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:23,489
Scott: You're not seeing anyone else up there.

800
00:56:23,774 --> 00:56:24,690
Scott: You can't change it out.

801
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,629
Scott: But with voice acting, you can change it out.

802
00:56:27,171 --> 00:56:34,930
Scott: And if one actor did a better job than another actor, you can go out and hear the better actor or actress instead.

803
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:40,490
Scott: And why wouldn't you write if subtitles in your native language are available now?

804
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:50,090
Rym: The other problem in the industry is, one, a lot of anime fans, just like everyone who plays video games, wants to make video games and they're willing to sacrifice a lot to do it.

805
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:56,430
Rym: A lot of people who watch anime in the American anime fandom want to be voice actors because of the weird.

806
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:09,890
Rym: I think it's mostly because of the weird ecosystem in America where the voice actors on anime are treated as bigger celebrities than they are in the context of conventions, which has led to a lot of weird outcomes.

807
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:11,649
Rym: But I don't think we need to dwell on that.

808
00:57:11,931 --> 00:57:13,810
Rym: If you've been to anime cons, you know what I'm talking about.

809
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:21,790
Scott: I think it is interesting that in Japan, it's like there definitely is a Seiyuu can become famous, right?

810
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:24,330
Scott: It's like it's to the general public, it seems, right?

811
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:26,490
Scott: It's like they're known people, right?

812
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:30,970
Scott: Just like other actors are known, voice actors are also known quantities, right?

813
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:38,090
Scott: In the United States and other parts of the world, it's like you could be the voice actor for something enormous, right?

814
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:43,210
Scott: So they're hugely popular and be a complete unknown to everybody.

815
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:46,990
Scott: People might know your voice when they hear it and never have heard of you, right?

816
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:49,590
Scott: Nerds might know of some of these people, right?

817
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,746
Scott: But the general public does not know, right?

818
00:57:52,370 --> 00:58:01,310
Scott: The voices of major, major characters don't appear on late shows or walk red carpets.

819
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:14,270
Rym: So one weird thing I've noticed, the people who do voice acting, who are not anime people, who get a treatment similar to the anime people, is basically anything that nerds care a lot about.

820
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:25,650
Rym: So if a popular cartoon that has a presence at like the San Diego Comic Con, the voice actors in that show, every nerd knows who they are and they're treated like celebrities.

821
00:58:26,051 --> 00:58:34,770
Rym: But a super famous, important actor who does a voice in a movie that's animated, the nerds don't tend to get that way about them in America.

822
00:58:36,852 --> 00:58:39,670
Rym: But I think that says more about fan culture than about anything else.

823
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:45,748
Scott: Right, I mean I was saying like if you look at something hugely popular, say Frozen, right?

824
00:58:46,594 --> 00:58:47,630
Scott: That's a mega hit, right?

825
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:52,365
Scott: All the voice actors on that are also already famous people, right?

826
00:58:52,846 --> 00:58:53,950
Scott: On their own, right?

827
00:58:54,111 --> 00:58:55,168
Scott: So at least most of them are.

828
00:58:55,611 --> 00:59:00,190
Scott: But if you look at The Simpsons, it's like, it's like, it's mega huge, right?

829
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:01,943
Scott: It's like we know who the people are.

830
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,730
Rym: Now, Simpsons nerds care a lot.

831
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:10,310
Scott: No, nerds in general know, but the general public all would all know Homer Simpson's voice.

832
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:11,509
Scott: Everybody, right?

833
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:15,489
Scott: But if you said, "Alright, who's the voice of Homer

834
00:59:15,509 --> 00:59:15,730
Scott: Simpson?"

835
00:59:15,792 --> 00:59:16,489
Scott: They don't fucking know.

836
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:19,128
Scott: If you told them that person's name, they'd be like, "I don't know who that

837
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:19,289
Scott: is.".

838
00:59:19,992 --> 00:59:21,878
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like there's.

839
00:59:21,938 --> 00:59:28,130
Scott: no, even at the top of the voice acting game in the United States, you don't get general public fame.

840
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:32,810
Scott: You only get nerd fame, even outside of anime, right?

841
00:59:32,951 --> 00:59:35,850
Scott: Even outside of things that are important from other countries, right?

842
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:53,550
Scott: So that's, it's that, like you said, when it comes to the nerds who do know, there becomes a weird culture around those people who are the voice actors because, right, it's like a special treat in a way for them to appear.

843
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:59,147
Scott: It's like, you know, even though I don't give a shit about them, like when I go to conventions, when I did go to conventions, right?

844
01:00:00,351 --> 01:00:08,950
Scott: It is really fun to meet a voice actor and if they actually are so gracious enough to do the voice, despite people constantly grasping on to the voice.

845
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:09,708
Rym: Say the line, Bart.

846
01:00:10,591 --> 01:00:13,550
Scott: Right, it's like, it is entertaining, right?

847
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:15,830
Scott: It is pleasurable, right?

848
01:00:15,971 --> 01:00:18,330
Scott: And they have that power with their, it's just, you know.

849
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:19,690
Rym: It kind of breaks your brain a little bit.

850
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:29,216
Rym: Like the few times I've been like talking directly to a voice actor and they slip into the character voice, there's this moment where the brain just goes, "What?

851
01:00:29,256 --> 01:00:31,427
Rym: How is that coming out of a human's mouth in front of me right

852
01:00:31,467 --> 01:00:31,648
Rym: now?".

853
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:36,510
Rym: Like there's this, it's slightly surprising, even if you see it coming and you know they're about to do it.

854
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:42,110
Scott: It's the same thing you get when you, you know, see any talented person do their talented thing, right?

855
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,309
Scott: You watch a basketball player do a ridiculous dunk.

856
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:50,189
Scott: You watch a, you know, expert pianist, right, play a piano amazingly, right?

857
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:52,725
Scott: You see a singer sing amazingly, right?

858
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:58,470
Scott: And you see some person, right, do this voice, like holy shit, wow, right?

859
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:01,804
Scott: It's like the same holy shit, wow kind of thing only, right?

860
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:07,287
Scott: You know, if Lebron goes around the street, he doesn't have people saying, "Do a dunk, do a

861
01:01:07,307 --> 01:01:07,508
Scott: dunk.".

862
01:01:08,012 --> 01:01:08,162
Scott: Right?

863
01:01:09,694 --> 01:01:11,110
Rym: Right, but also people don't know who the hell he is.

864
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:11,609
Rym: Tony Hawk!

865
01:01:12,832 --> 01:01:17,590
Rym: If anyone actually recognizes Tony Hawk, "Do a kickflip" is the first thing they will yell.

866
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:25,470
Rym: It's basically, it's the freebird of seeing Tony Hawk and recognizing that's Tony Hawk.

867
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:38,410
Scott: Right, you know, you know, people who have a talent of performing, other people want them to perform because they're so good at it that it brings joy to those who witness it and experience it.

868
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:47,170
Scott: And I'll admit, if you're a voice actor and people are telling you to do the voice, right, all the time, if they know at the conventions, thankfully not when you're not at the conventions.

869
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:49,449
Rym: I'll be honest, I would never get tired of that.

870
01:01:50,311 --> 01:01:52,270
Scott: On the one hand, it's annoying, right?

871
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:59,950
Scott: But on the other hand, it's like that is recognition that your voice is so amazing that people want to hear it.

872
01:02:00,534 --> 01:02:02,889
Scott: So it's like a good and a bad at the same time.

873
01:02:03,231 --> 01:02:06,210
Rym: Even our tiny, like, ageless level of fame.

874
01:02:06,851 --> 01:02:12,310
Rym: When we were going to conventions, how many people come up to us like, "You just did a panel about bad games for an hour.

875
01:02:12,932 --> 01:02:15,707
Rym: I would like you to tell me why my game is bad right

876
01:02:15,747 --> 01:02:15,868
Rym: now.".

877
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,958
Scott: I'd be like, "Because your face is bad.

878
01:02:18,019 --> 01:02:18,762
Rym: Get out of here,

879
01:02:18,863 --> 01:02:18,963
Rym: kid.".

880
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:21,062
Scott: "Because I don't like your

881
01:02:21,082 --> 01:02:21,306
Scott: face.".

882
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:21,731
Rym: But

883
01:02:21,911 --> 01:02:22,453
Scott: I actually,

884
01:02:23,256 --> 01:02:39,530
Rym: it's funny, the only voice actors that I can just name off the top of my head are ones that either I know because I'm a nerd who pays a lot of attention to something specific or they're nerdy pop culture things that are hard to avoid, mostly from eras when I was really into that.

885
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:55,330
Rym: And I've seen a lot of anime with fantastic voice acting and yet I don't remember the names of any of those people anymore even though I watched one episode of Escaflowne and then I was trying to learn more about Miyasakamoto.

886
01:02:55,892 --> 01:03:00,810
Rym: But I think that's just because I'm older and I have less time to spend on frivolous pursuits.

887
01:03:03,721 --> 01:03:18,290
Scott: So there's one last phenomena that I've noticed a bit over time which is there'll be famous people who are not necessarily voice actors, right?

888
01:03:18,911 --> 01:03:25,929
Rym: Ah, but they get attached to an animated movie usually because then they can say their name like "Gilbert Gottfried is in this

889
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:26,110
Rym: movie.".

890
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:27,058
Scott: That's not what I'm talking about.

891
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:28,410
Scott: That's not what I'm talking about at all.

892
01:03:30,351 --> 01:03:34,983
Scott: But they have a distinctive voice that is known, right?

893
01:03:35,264 --> 01:03:37,430
Scott: Or that you've heard that voice somewhere.

894
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:38,389
Rym: Well, like Thunder Throat.

895
01:03:40,193 --> 01:03:41,730
Scott: Sure, rest in peace that guy.

896
01:03:44,811 --> 01:03:53,950
Scott: And they'll get gigs voice acting on shows usually as cameos or as other characters or something like that, right?

897
01:03:54,430 --> 01:04:00,650
Scott: So, for example, you could watch a lot of children's cartoons and it's like you'll be surprised.

898
01:04:01,151 --> 01:04:03,390
Scott: Weird Al just shows up a lot, right?

899
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:07,069
Scott: It's like if you aren't thinking about it really hard.

900
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:08,489
Rym: I mean, he was in My Little Pony.

901
01:04:09,272 --> 01:04:19,689
Scott: Right, if you're not thinking about it hard or aware of it in advance or it's like you just hear someone doing a voice and then it's like, "Wait a minute, that's the Weird Al

902
01:04:19,709 --> 01:04:19,890
Scott: voice.".

903
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:21,896
Scott: No, that is Weird Al doing that voice.

904
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:26,609
Scott: He got hired to do voice acting on that show for one episode as that one character.

905
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:41,828
Rym: Sometimes you get the situation with like a Lorenzo music where there's someone who sounds close enough to a well-known voice, in this case Bill Murray, that people hire this person to basically make people think they heard Bill Murray.

906
01:04:45,402 --> 01:04:45,749
Scott: Kind of.

907
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:47,304
Rym: Yeah, that happens though.

908
01:04:47,324 --> 01:04:47,789
Rym: That's the thing.

909
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:50,777
Scott: Well, I mean, the Thunder Throat guy died.

910
01:04:50,917 --> 01:04:54,530
Scott: I've heard movie trailers recently where it sounds really similar.

911
01:04:55,270 --> 01:05:01,429
Rym: So, that actually leads into the last topic I wanted to bring up and we'll have to wrap up soon because important hockey is going to start in 15 minutes.

912
01:05:02,371 --> 01:05:18,150
Rym: But voice acting faster than a lot of other acting, I'm not going to say is going to be made obsolete, but technology can replace low-quality voice acting pretty easily.

913
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:18,890
Rym: Deep fakes.

914
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:19,677
Scott: Low quality?

915
01:05:19,718 --> 01:05:20,529
Scott: Yes, very much.

916
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:21,010
Rym: Yep.

917
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:33,449
Rym: So, the things that are going to happen in this industry that we have to deal with is people who are dead or retired or who for moral reasons refuse to work on a show, let's say.

918
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:40,630
Rym: Deep fakes could just perfectly recreate their voice, good enough for a voice acting gig, and someone else does the performance.

919
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:43,910
Rym: And it just sounds like that person did the performance.

920
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:49,010
Scott: It depends on if you own the rights to like your likeness, right?

921
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:49,698
Scott: So, like just today.

922
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:56,050
Rym: There are already big debates around what actually fully constitutes a likeness or not.

923
01:05:57,556 --> 01:05:57,860
Rym: Of course.

924
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:02,850
Rym: I don't want to look like Bill Murray, but what if I just happen to sound exactly like Bill Murray?

925
01:06:03,892 --> 01:06:05,288
Scott: Well, like I was saying, just today, right?

926
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:13,790
Rym: You know, Stan Lee in his latest years- What if I train a model on Lorenzo Music's voice to then recreate Bill Murray's voice indirectly?

927
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:18,250
Scott: Anyway, Stan Lee in his very latest years, right?

928
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:25,010
Scott: There was all sorts of fiascos involving elder abuse and whatnot and signing contracts without, you know, forging a signature on stuff, right?

929
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:34,090
Scott: But just today, literally, Disney paid the company that was, you know, the one that forged the signatures or whatever, right?

930
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:38,430
Scott: Stan Lee's company to license for like many, many years.

931
01:06:38,611 --> 01:06:39,450
Scott: I think it was 20 years.

932
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:39,842
Scott: Look up.

933
01:06:40,171 --> 01:06:42,850
Scott: There'll be articles about it today, about how many years this deal was.

934
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:47,490
Scott: They licensed from Stan Lee's POW Entertainment, whatever it's called, right?

935
01:06:47,871 --> 01:06:59,890
Scott: His, you know, likeness, right, for a large amount of time so that they can basically recreate a Stan Lee in whatever Marvel shit they want to recreate him in, right?

936
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:10,350
Scott: And if they have a way to make a computer talk like Stan Lee or, you know, sell a GPS voice Stan Lee for your car GPS or, you know, they're going to do it.

937
01:07:10,672 --> 01:07:11,809
Scott: They got the license for it.

938
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:12,710
Scott: They're going to do it, right?

939
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:21,150
Scott: So, if someone tries to sound like you and you're a famous voice, you know, get the - make sure that, you know, you get a licensing deal for that shit.

940
01:07:22,294 --> 01:07:22,404
Rym: Yep.

941
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:39,850
Rym: But also, that'll all be moot because we're going to get to the point to where much like with, you know, motion capture and everything else, even if we have a person doing the acting, we will very likely see increasingly heavily computer modulated performances that come out of that acting.

942
01:07:40,211 --> 01:07:45,144
Rym: So then, no longer does the original actor really have control over that?

943
01:07:45,184 --> 01:07:46,668
Rym: because what's the voice the audience hears?

944
01:07:46,748 --> 01:07:47,470
Rym: and what's the likeness?

945
01:07:47,891 --> 01:07:49,630
Rym: It's the AI generated audio.

946
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,489
Rym: You've just got someone basically working the controls behind it.

947
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:54,509
Scott: Yeah, could be, could be.

948
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:59,590
Scott: Okay, I just want to end the show by mentioning that there is a book that's been on my wish list that I haven't read yet.

949
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:07,570
Scott: I don't know if it'll be GeekNights Book Club material, but famous voice actress Megumi Hashibara wrote a whole fucking book.

950
01:08:08,252 --> 01:08:14,490
Scott: She wrote a whole book called The Characters Taught Me Everything Living Life One Episode at a Time, and it's been on my wish list.

951
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,279
Rym: Oh, that sounds so good.

952
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:18,069
Rym: I'm really invested in that already.

953
01:08:18,691 --> 01:08:27,430
Scott: It's got five stars and it's on Amazon and it's got, it's 17 bucks for this book and I've been meaning, it's been on my wish list.

954
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:40,950
Scott: I've been meaning to read it whenever and that book exists and that book can probably tell you a lot about the life of voice acting, right, from one of the, you know, the S-tier stars of voice acting of all, you know, time.

955
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:48,750
Rym: And I don't know if you ever, if you ever need me and Scott to voice act for you, all I can say is what you hear now, that's the only voice either of us can do.

956
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:55,870
Scott: If you want to hire me to voice act, you'll have to wait for me to join the voice acting union and then you can hire me through the union.

957
01:08:57,111 --> 01:09:03,669
Scott: If you somehow like my voice that much and can't find an actor to actually do it and you're aware of the fact that I have no acting skills.

958
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:05,955
Rym: That's something I'd be willing to do without joining a union.

959
01:09:06,316 --> 01:09:11,050
Rym: If we got the valiant denim team back together for one last episode.

960
01:09:11,312 --> 01:09:12,089
Scott: That seems unlikely.

961
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:14,950
Rym: That seems extremely un, uh, possible.

962
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:23,527
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

963
01:09:23,567 --> 01:09:28,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

964
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,939
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

965
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:36,888
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

966
01:09:37,029 --> 01:09:41,120
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

967
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:45,136
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

968
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:49,490
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

969
01:09:49,691 --> 01:09:52,580
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

970
01:09:52,841 --> 01:10:30,140
Rym: And the Patreon Patreons for this episode of GeekNights are... Uh, I wonder if any of you thought I was going to try to do an accent or a weird voice for this, but I absolutely am.

971
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:35,140
Rym: This is hard enough to do as it is to read all these names that quickly, let alone to do it in a weird voice.

972
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:41,720
Rym: So other than one brave person who appears to have typed it out in an accent, this is all you're getting.

973
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,576
Rym: So, uh, all I leave you with is...

974
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,579
Scott: La granuit, mons le pamplemousse.

975
01:10:47,902 --> 01:10:48,515
Scott: La granuit!

976
01:10:52,701 --> 01:10:54,199
Rym: This isn't Miss Hoover's class.

977
01:10:54,903 --> 01:10:58,500
Rym: Uh, do not know this mad monselle, ouvert, of which you speak.

978
01:10:59,101 --> 01:11:00,009
Scott: What's happening?

979
01:11:00,373 --> 01:11:01,039
Scott: Where am I?

980
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,426
Scott: Sacre bleu!

981
01:11:03,091 --> 01:11:04,280
Scott: What a foolish question!

982
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:07,259
Rym: You're at West Springfield Elementary School!

983
01:11:08,141 --> 01:11:09,200
Rym: West Springfield?

984
01:11:11,025 --> 01:11:12,658
Scott: I'm at the wrong school!

985
01:11:16,181 --> 01:11:16,672
Scott: En français!

986
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:19,935
Rym: Bonjour!
