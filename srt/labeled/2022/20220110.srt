1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,088
Rym: It's Monday, January 10th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:10,410
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,149
Rym: And this is GeekNights' Night.

4
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:16,960
Rym: We're talking about package managers.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,920
Rym: Or package management.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,877
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:24,572
Scott: So, I ski a lot.

8
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:25,660
Rym: You know, that's a thing I do.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,088
Rym: COVID has kind of messed that up.

10
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:28,800
Rym: Like, I can only really ski in a local mountain.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,928
Rym: And even then, it depends.

12
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:31,280
Rym: Like, I can't go indoors or whatever.

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,540
Rym: So, I stumbled upon a video, because I watch a lot of skiing videos.

14
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:37,070
Rym: I watch a lot of tutorial videos.

15
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,500
Rym: I watch a lot of training videos.

16
00:00:38,882 --> 00:00:40,111
Rym: I watch a lot of technique videos.

17
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:40,816
Rym: I watch pros.

18
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:41,320
Rym: I watch amateur.

19
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:45,058
Rym: It's part of how I stay engaged with the sport in the summer.

20
00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:47,080
Rym: And in the winter.

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,380
Rym: So, over the weekend, on Sunday, I watched a video that just came into my feed.

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,084
Rym: And it was called "Le

23
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:53,688
Rym: Tunnel."

24
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:55,500
Rym: The hardest slope on earth.

25
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:58,560
Rym: And it's a famous slope in the Alps.

26
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,753
Rym: Like, this is an Alps ski slope.

27
00:01:01,135 --> 00:01:01,478
Rym: A piste.

28
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:04,156
Rym: And, uh, I know about this slope.

29
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:04,780
Rym: I know it exists.

30
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:05,564
Rym: But I didn't know.

31
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,540
Rym: people talked about it as being the hardest slope in the Alps.

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,380
Rym: So, I watched this video, and it's, of course, this run has this really cool tunnel.

33
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,439
Rym: Like, you get to the top of the mountain.

34
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:19,500
Rym: And then you ski really slowly through a fucking, just, like, tiny tunnel cut through the mountain.

35
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:22,280
Scott: Is it, like, rocks above you and below you?

36
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:22,964
Rym: And below you.

37
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:25,500
Rym: And you've got, like, four feet on either side of you.

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,430
Scott: What if it fills with snow, though?

39
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:28,700
Scott: They gotta shovel it out.

40
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,420
Rym: They make snow and, like, push snow in there so you can ski through it.

41
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,764
Scott: 'Cause basically- No, no, no.

42
00:01:32,805 --> 00:01:33,067
Scott: Oh, yeah.

43
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:34,720
Scott: 'Cause snow wouldn't be inside of it.

44
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,920
Scott: But I meant, like, if it snows too much, the whole thing could be, like, a hundred percent filled.

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,684
Scott: Oh, they gotta dig it out.

46
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:40,414
Rym: They got, like, a complex on both sides.

47
00:01:40,515 --> 00:01:41,400
Rym: It's real long.

48
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:43,980
Rym: There's a rope in there, so you gotta pull yourself along.

49
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,199
Scott: But it's not hard.

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,288
Scott: But if somebody in front of you is stuck, and someone else comes shushing through at that time- No, you can't get that fast.

51
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:53,220
Rym: You're basically, like, ski-walking through this thing.

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,334
Rym: It's not- It is in no way difficult.

53
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:56,180
Rym: It's just really cool.

54
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,539
Scott: So- Oh, okay.

55
00:01:57,882 --> 00:02:06,160
Scott: People are afraid of this thing, but it's not, like- Well, I guess the- Oh, I guess it sounds like the major danger would be if it collapses, which seems unlikely.

56
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:13,760
Scott: Or if you get stuck in, but it seems like there's a lot of staff maintaining it, so- So, the major danger seems to be that- Does it have lighting inside it?

57
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:13,965
Scott: Oh, yeah.

58
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:14,539
Rym: It's fully lit.

59
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,924
Rym: Like, I'm honest.

60
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:20,480
Rym: If I put skis on you and told you to get through this tunnel, you would get through it just fine.

61
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,260
Scott: Well, I mean, it has a rope, so I could just- You said I pulled myself along.

62
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:28,780
Rym: And if you- And it'll, like- There's slight, gentle slopes where you, like, very slowly crawl forward.

63
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,662
Scott: Well, I got- I got a rope, so- Yep.

64
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,840
Rym: So, anyway, you get out of it, and there's the real slope.

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:41,960
Rym: And sure enough, this video shows a ton of people in the Alps really, really struggling to get down this steep, difficult-looking slope.

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,939
Rym: But as I watch it, this slope does not look that hard to me.

67
00:02:47,382 --> 00:02:51,840
Scott: And my immediate instinct, because I'm a wiser- Is it just a sheet of- Is it just a sheet of ice?

68
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,671
Rym: So, it's steep, like, 35 degrees.

69
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:56,119
Scott: It's- Okay, that's pretty steep.

70
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,686
Rym: It's scrapey and icy.

71
00:02:57,726 --> 00:03:01,880
Rym: Like, you hear the people skiing, and it just sounds like- [squeaking].

72
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,449
Rym: There is no puffy snow on this thing.

73
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,597
Scott: Big bumps, like, moguls everywhere, and people are just wiping out- Oh, so you don't want to put your ass on the floor?

74
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:11,840
Rym: No, and people are just wiping out left and right.

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,879
Rym: But I'm watching it, and I think that does not look hard.

76
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:22,499
Rym: So, because I'm nearly 40, and wiser than I was, say, 20 years ago, I don't immediately think, "I could do

77
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:22,740
Rym: that!".

78
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:24,047
Rym: I think, "What am I

79
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:24,409
Rym: missing?".

80
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:26,400
Scott: I'm clearly missing something.

81
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,324
Scott: The camera needs to get a side view, so maybe there's, you know, something- Oh, no, so I went further.

82
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,180
Rym: I went and, like, looked at the actual slope, like, stats, topography.

83
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,547
Rym: Like, what is the angle of this thing?

84
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,253
Rym: I watched a bunch of other videos.

85
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:41,060
Rym: A lot of people talk about how it's crazy hard.

86
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,859
Rym: Alps people, like, hurt themselves all the time on it.

87
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:53,020
Rym: So, I look, and it's not steeper than one of the steepest double black diamonds than Hunter Mountain.

88
00:03:55,601 --> 00:04:00,620
Rym: It's not even that different than Claire's Way at Hunter Mountain, a slope that I ski all the time.

89
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:12,620
Rym: And basically, what I determined from digging around for a couple hours, I was really invested in this, is that this slope is only hard to very good skiers who have never skied in the eastern United States.

90
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:19,019
Rym: Because the primary reason this slope is hard is that it's steep and mogul-y, and the snow is garbage.

91
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,000
Rym: But it's only garbage by the standards of most of the world.

92
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:32,640
Rym: The northeastern United States, the snow is generally so shitty that that's the kind of snow I'm usually skiing on already.

93
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:41,892
Scott: So, basically- So, Europeans who are used to skiing in the wonderful Alps, if they come to the US for shitty skiing- They would just die.

94
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,539
Rym: at Hunter Mountain on the double blacks, like, honestly.

95
00:04:45,481 --> 00:04:53,340
Scott: So, what you're telling me is that Rym sees a situation and he determines an explanation to aggrandize himself.

96
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:02,591
Rym: No, no, no, what I'm saying is I am 100%, because I had an Alps trip that had to get deferred because of COVID, but I- The explanation must be that I am the best.

97
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:03,820
Scott: There's no other possible explanation.

98
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:11,980
Rym: It's more that, because there's an alternative to this, is if the snow is good, skiers in the rest of the world are way better than me.

99
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:13,543
Rym: I can't ski in that shit.

100
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:21,482
Rym: It's just East Coast skiing means that this particular slope that a lot of professionals say is very hard- Not racers.

101
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:26,880
Rym: The other thing I determined is that people who race, this is like the easiest slope in the world for them.

102
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,228
Rym: And those are people who are way better than me.

103
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,320
Rym: Those are the people who are skiing stuff that I won't ski even on the East Coast.

104
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,257
Rym: But, basically, what I'm committing to is once COVID is to the point where I can travel again, I'm gonna go ski this thing.

105
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,320
Rym: Absolutely.

106
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:43,664
Scott: Bring a GoPro in the tunnel.

107
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:45,348
Rym: I will absolutely bring a GoPro.

108
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:47,373
Rym: I'll livestream ski in this thing if I can.

109
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:50,420
Rym: This slope is not that hard.

110
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:51,782
Scott: Okay.

111
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,220
Rym: So, yeah, that's the most exciting thing that happened to me.

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,783
Scott: Rym will fall off this thing.

113
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:58,528
Scott: I mean, you know what, though?

114
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,372
Rym: It is about as dangerous as slopes.

115
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:01,234
Rym: I do do that.

116
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,380
Rym: I have been it pretty hard before.

117
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,047
Scott: I want to see the GoPro video.

118
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,896
Scott: It might be a snuff film.

119
00:06:06,936 --> 00:06:07,580
Scott: We gotta watch out.

120
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:16,499
Rym: But I think to start, later this winter, once there's more snow, I'll go ski Claire's Way, which is the absolute same steepness.

121
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,824
Rym: And basically, it's almost the same trail.

122
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:22,653
Rym: So, I'll ski that on GoPro first.

123
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,600
Rym: You'll probably see me bite it because that slope's real hard.

124
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:29,311
Rym: So, yeah, that's what I got.

125
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:30,920
Rym: I haven't done anything else because of COVID.

126
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,825
Scott: I haven't done anything.

127
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:33,637
Scott: I'm sitting inside doing my biz.

128
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:33,919
Scott: That's it.

129
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:42,660
Rym: Also, if any listeners have skied this thing before in Europe, let me know if I'm missing something, but a couple hours of research doesn't seem like this thing's that big a deal.

130
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,053
Rym: Anyway, in a little bit of news, once again about Europe, the U.S.

131
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:50,520
Rym: is having a lot of trouble with COVID, like above and beyond.

132
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,269
Scott: The whole world is having trouble with COVID.

133
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,280
Scott: That's been true for several years now.

134
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,162
Rym: But the U.S.

135
00:06:55,202 --> 00:07:03,460
Rym: is having extra problems in that we have way more aggressive anti-vaxxers and way more anti-vaxxers in our own government defining policy.

136
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:13,680
Rym: But this is an article on Waypo about how basically all of Europe is starting to treat this, and it's interesting because this is where there's going to be a huge departure.

137
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,034
Rym: One by one, European nations are basically saying, "If you're not vaccinated, we're going to block you out of basically everything.

138
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,597
Rym: You can't go anywhere.

139
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:22,038
Rym: You can't do

140
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:22,560
Rym: anything.".

141
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:26,460
Scott: Yeah, the best one I saw, this is the best thing I've seen in Quebec.

142
00:07:27,928 --> 00:07:28,578
Rym: Oh, yeah, yeah.

143
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:36,400
Scott: In Quebec, Canada, they will not let you buy alcohol or weed if you are not vaccinated.

144
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,635
Rym: You want to fix this problem instantly in the

145
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:40,077
Rym: U.S.?

146
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:42,721
Rym: ?

147
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:45,129
Scott: Yeah, I know how to fix it instantly in the U.S You ready?

148
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:48,560
Scott: You can't buy gasoline if you're not vaccinated.

149
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,985
Rym: Well, in France, compare the messaging, too.

150
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:56,436
Rym: In France, the president basically said, "Openly, I want to piss off anti-vaxxers.

151
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,618
Rym: If I piss them off, I've done my

152
00:07:57,658 --> 00:07:57,919
Rym: job.".

153
00:07:58,741 --> 00:08:03,600
Scott: Yep, and that's a place where people vote, right?

154
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:18,440
Scott: Why is that person who is an elected person, who's voted for in a democratic representative kind of government, not afraid to anger voters yet in the United States?

155
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:26,460
Scott: It's like why the president is so afraid of making any voter angry and won't insult anybody.

156
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:36,557
Rym: I think it would be especially considering that as big a problem as anti-vaxx sentiment is in the United States, those people are a minority of the population.

157
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:38,299
Rym: They're just overrepresented in the government.

158
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,432
Rym: Vaccination measures are generally broadly popular in the U.S.

159
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:45,980
Rym: They're just not electorally viable because of our broken system.

160
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,520
Scott: All I'm saying is it's okay to insult people when you're a representative.

161
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:56,460
Scott: Ad hominem attacks are okay when they're true.

162
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,280
Rym: I'd like to see our president tell white people who refuse vaccination to go fuck themselves live on TV.

163
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,321
Scott: That's right.

164
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:08,668
Scott: If the president said literally the words, "Go fuck yourself," to someone who deserved it, that would get him votes.

165
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,911
Scott: It wouldn't hurt anyone.

166
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:11,992
Scott: He's not losing votes.

167
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:13,474
Scott: He's already lost those votes.

168
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:14,154
Scott: He can't get them.

169
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:17,538
Scott: He's only going to increase the enthusiasm by doing that.

170
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:18,840
Scott: Why not do it?

171
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:21,847
Rym: But that's sort of what I'm getting at.

172
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:27,340
Rym: I want to see that, but in America, the only politicians who do that are the bad, crazy right-wing ones.

173
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:31,380
Rym: I feel like someday we'll get there.

174
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,218
Scott: They've got all the wrong policies, but they've got some of the right techniques.

175
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:35,600
Scott: A few.

176
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:42,320
Rym: So anyway, you got any tech news that isn't just the horrific pandemic that we're still stuck in?

177
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,479
Scott: Yeah, well that's not tech news really.

178
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:45,720
Scott: Science news?

179
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:57,640
Scott: So because of the horrific pandemic that we're still stuck in and its related supply chain issues and all the other things that are going on, inflation and whatnot, there's a lack of chips, silicon.

180
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:07,540
Scott: And one thing that contains chips but doesn't need to contain chips is printer ink cartridges.

181
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:15,760
Scott: So you think in a chip shortage, you're obviously, if there's something you manufacture, if you can manufacture it without the chip part, you're going to do it, right?

182
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:23,300
Rym: But Black Dynamite, I make money primarily by using DRM to prevent people from using reasonably priced printer ink in my garbage business model.

183
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,683
Scott: Right.

184
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:28,354
Scott: So first of all, printer popularity is just way down in general.

185
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:30,080
Scott: People just don't have printers a lot these days.

186
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,700
Rym: That's why I have a laser printer because I use it so rarely.

187
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:34,042
Scott: We'll talk about that.

188
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:40,634
Scott: But people do have printers tend to still buy the inkjet ones and the cartridges.

189
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:43,720
Scott: for a long time, they've included microchips in them.

190
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,288
Scott: And it's like it's just a plastic tub of ink.

191
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:48,134
Scott: Why do you need the chip?

192
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:50,120
Scott: The chip serves two functions.

193
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:58,278
Scott: One, it helps to accurately measure how much ink is remaining so that you can display in the software exactly how much ink is remaining, which is handy.

194
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,120
Scott: That's handy.

195
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,022
Scott: My laser printer can't do that.

196
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:15,000
Scott: But two, it allows them to be like, hey, if someone else makes a plastic tub of ink and tries to sell it and you put it in your printer will, you know, see the printer will try to detect that and be like, hey, you can't use that cartridge.

197
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,565
Scott: So different companies handle this differently, right?

198
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:21,088
Scott: So HP is the worst one.

199
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:30,140
Scott: What HP does is not only will the cartridge not work, right, but they've got like some sort of subscription bullshit service.

200
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,711
Scott: You got to like sign up and like get cartridges or it's like the worst one, right?

201
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:37,017
Rym: So we had to have done, you're going to buy inkjet.

202
00:11:37,057 --> 00:11:38,260
Scott: Don't buy the HP one.

203
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:38,580
Scott: Right.

204
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:47,295
Scott: So but all the news, if you read all the headlines, they're saying Canon for Canon's printers can't get enough chips.

205
00:11:47,936 --> 00:11:50,280
Scott: So it's telling customers how to circumvent the DRM.

206
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,582
Scott: And that is not true.

207
00:11:52,383 --> 00:11:55,107
Scott: Canon never had DRM on its printers.

208
00:11:55,768 --> 00:12:04,080
Scott: What they do have is they just have an annoying message that pops up and says, hey, your ink cartridge might be, you know, shady and not an official Canon one.

209
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,321
Scott: But then it still prints.

210
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:11,229
Scott: So all Canon did is tell its users, hey, our new cartridges don't have the chip.

211
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:12,851
Scott: The message is going to pop up.

212
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:20,460
Scott: Just click ignore and print anyway, just like you could have done if you were using cheaper third party cartridges the whole time.

213
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,624
Scott: So no, Canon never had DRM.

214
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:33,338
Scott: They just had annoying messages, but they never stopped you from using a third party or in this case, first party cartridges that have no chips in them.

215
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,140
Scott: I don't think they lowered the price though.

216
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,040
Scott: So now you're paying the, I assume you're paying the same and getting less because you're not getting the chip that tells you how much ink is left in there.

217
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,501
Scott: Yeah.

218
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:51,540
Rym: About the closest interesting thing is they, they basically effectively admitted that there are quote no negative effects on print quality when consumables are used without electronic components.

219
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,667
Scott: Well, they're in that case, they're referring to using their own cartridges, right?

220
00:12:55,707 --> 00:13:05,406
Scott: They're not saying that, you know, but the point is, is that obviously I think if you're a listener of this show, you probably don't need to be told, told this, but Granted though, that was an old thing.

221
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:06,790
Rym: Like kids today don't even have printers.

222
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,320
Rym: So we were forced in the fires of being mad about printer ink.

223
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:18,800
Scott: But if there's anything in the world that has that print cartridge, razor blade business model, you should be circumventing that.

224
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,020
Scott: Yup.

225
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:23,087
Rym: The sole exception to that, but it's not the business model.

226
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,672
Rym: It's just, it's similar optically, but I want to point it out.

227
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:30,220
Rym: Many times the official battery of something is the official battery for it.

228
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,333
Scott: Well, battery is not, you know, it's a rechargeable battery.

229
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:34,196
Scott: It's different.

230
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:35,080
Scott: That's not a...

231
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,701
Rym: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

232
00:13:35,742 --> 00:13:43,640
Rym: It's not the same business model, but while I have often used bootleg batteries and things, that is definitely a buyer beware situation.

233
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,063
Scott: But that's not in the same category.

234
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,365
Scott: Cause it's not a consumable thing.

235
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:48,369
Scott: You have to keep buying, you buy the batteries.

236
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:54,680
Scott: once you keep buying razor, even if you buy, you know, the best razor blades, you got to keep re buying more of them.

237
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,762
Scott: They get dull.

238
00:13:55,822 --> 00:13:56,924
Scott: You can't really sharpen them.

239
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:01,754
Scott: That would be, uh, and the same thing with our, you know, any, I don't know if there's, there's probably other things like that.

240
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,420
Scott: where you have to, is a consumable refillable thing.

241
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:11,496
Scott: And if there's some sort of, you know, if the first party like Gillette, you know, mock, whatever blaze, I don't even know what they have anymore.

242
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:13,060
Scott: Cause I don't have been bought one.

243
00:14:14,343 --> 00:14:21,122
Rym: I have saved so much goddamn money from shifting to a safety razor back in 2005.

244
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:22,383
Scott: And there are, there are some.

245
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:34,840
Scott: I've seen these things, for example, there's like that dollar shave club where it's like, you know, they're trying to meet you halfway where like they they're selling you a subscription to the cheaper, but it's like, no, they're go get the cheapest possible thing.

246
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,446
Scott: You can buy like normal razor blades.

247
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:40,111
Scott: You can buy like hundreds of them for like a couple dollars.

248
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:44,220
Scott: I will say I do buy dollar shave club thing is like a ripoff.

249
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:50,200
Rym: I do buy these slightly more expensive feather blades instead of the cheaper burger blades, because they do cut me less often.

250
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,623
Scott: I have a, what brand do I have?

251
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,566
Rym: I've been using feather for about a decade.

252
00:14:54,586 --> 00:15:00,073
Scott: I've got, I basically have a whole like big long, I bought a package.

253
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:05,060
Rym: I bought a box on Amazon like a decade ago that was like a thousand of these blades.

254
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:14,320
Scott: I have like, I have so many, I basically, what I have is like the display case that if you were a drug store, you would put it out and people would take out little packs of five.

255
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:18,599
Scott: So it's like I open it and there's like, there's like, you know, many, many packs of five in there.

256
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,101
Scott: Yup.

257
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,816
Rym: Mine is a very similar format.

258
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,280
Rym: What I bought.

259
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,401
Scott: Yeah.

260
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:28,131
Scott: But yeah, it's like, you know, ink cartridges you should get, if you have a laser printer, no one's going to do the shenanigans.

261
00:15:28,152 --> 00:15:32,780
Scott: You could buy one toner cartridge that will, a legitimate one that will last you forever.

262
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:36,160
Scott: And your cost per print will be like almost nothing.

263
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,294
Rym: And laser printers while the upfront cost is more, unlike ink jets, that toner doesn't go bad.

264
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:46,340
Rym: If you use your printer once a year when you have to do something official.

265
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,700
Scott: That's the thing is if you, if for some reason you don't need a printer, right?

266
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:52,391
Rym: Avoid it.

267
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:52,700
Rym: Absolutely.

268
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,161
Scott: Don't get one.

269
00:15:54,442 --> 00:16:08,520
Scott: And the few times you need to print something, you could go to your local FedEx, Kinko's, whatever, and they have a system where you could just email a PDF to an email address and then it comes out of one of their printers and you pay like a few, 50 cents or something.

270
00:16:08,943 --> 00:16:10,980
Scott: And that's all you'll need for most people, I think.

271
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,380
Rym: Or I think what a lot of people do is just use whatever printer is at work.

272
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,182
Scott: You could do that too.

273
00:16:16,562 --> 00:16:27,340
Scott: But if you still go to a work, but yeah, if you don't need, if you need a printer, like you need to own one in the present day because of whatever you do, you should be having a laser printer.

274
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:27,981
Scott: There's.

275
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,248
Rym: no, I bought this laser printer.

276
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:32,455
Rym: It's a full office color laser printer.

277
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:33,178
Rym: It's gigantic.

278
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:33,880
Rym: Like I went all out.

279
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:41,460
Rym: I have not replaced any of the four toner cartridges in it since I bought it, which was like, I have this more than five years ago.

280
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,769
Scott: I have this brother black and white only, black and white only laser printer.

281
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:49,093
Scott: I've had it since at least a decade.

282
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,540
Scott: It had a problem with it, but I've managed to fix the problem thanks to a YouTube video.

283
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:56,725
Scott: And it's only on the second toner cartridge.

284
00:16:57,065 --> 00:16:59,629
Scott: The first one wasn't even a completely full one.

285
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:05,179
Scott: It was like the free one that you get with the printer that, and then I bought a real one that was 100% full of toner.

286
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,684
Scott: It's still prints perfectly fine.

287
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,247
Scott: And it even does double sided.

288
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:14,900
Scott: So, and it was, it wasn't expensive, but I guess always been a hundred bucks.

289
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,983
Rym: Always be wary of anything that appears to have this business model.

290
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:18,884
Scott: Yep.

291
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:21,287
Rym: In some other news.

292
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:32,160
Rym: Uh, so recently we were talking about, you know, there's been a lot of acquisitions just everywhere in the world lately for a lot of capitalist reasons, but, uh, the athletic got bought for a pretty paltry sum.

293
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:33,722
Scott: We talked about that last week.

294
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:41,792
Rym: So Zynga, uh, which made Farmville, uh, but that's not really how they make their money, made a bunch of other mobile junk too, which is where they make their money.

295
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:46,337
Rym: They just got bought by, uh, take two for $12.7 billion.

296
00:17:50,161 --> 00:18:07,500
Rym: So that means that that Zynga, which is makes the mobile games is worth 25 athletics according to capitalism, which tracks because in gaming games that people who listen to GeekNights play those makes so little money that they're not even worth talking about.

297
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:18,480
Rym: When you're an investor, the games that make the most money are shovelware, addictive garbage, like simplistic minimum effort, more money operating a casino than any other business.

298
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:27,520
Scott: So now the whole biggest businesses in the world are just casinos, you know, disguised as other things to avoid the gaming commission.

299
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:33,960
Rym: It's really funny how many mobile casual games are the exact same game with a different skin.

300
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:35,540
Scott: Yeah.

301
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:39,412
Scott: Or, you know, the worst part, and I can't, I can't say it enough, right?

302
00:18:39,512 --> 00:18:42,059
Scott: It's like, at least in a real casino, you can win your money back.

303
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:42,901
Scott: Yeah.

304
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:52,780
Scott: So there's like this slot machine apps in the app store that are like, you pay real money to get tokens, which basically is a number in their database.

305
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:55,023
Scott: And that lets you play a slot machine.

306
00:18:55,504 --> 00:19:00,292
Scott: And even if you win that slot machine, all you can win is more tokens to play the slot machine more.

307
00:19:00,353 --> 00:19:02,035
Scott: You cannot win real money back.

308
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:03,017
Scott: You 100% lose all the money.

309
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:14,680
Rym: But there's a bunch of stuff going on here because on one hand, don't get me wrong, I'm not denigrating simple, casual, and/or mobile games.

310
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:20,100
Rym: That is just as valid of a gaming activity as anything any of you listening to the show do.

311
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:35,299
Scott: If that app with the fake slot machine that you can't win any money also didn't cost any money and you could just spin the slot machine forever, like, I would occasionally just tap my finger on it while I was, you know, zoning out or something.

312
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:35,660
Scott: I don't know.

313
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:44,140
Rym: But also, you know, gaming, playing games, even very simple ones, entertainment software, there's a reason it's so popular.

314
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:49,896
Rym: It's so broadly popular because people like to interact with things and play games, however simple.

315
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:51,460
Rym: Like, that's not really the problem here.

316
00:19:51,981 --> 00:20:07,060
Rym: The problem that this raises, like the second point, is that capitalism has pushed this to the point that there is an infinite variety of addictive shovelware games that are probably at least slightly toxic to the psyches of the people playing them.

317
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:14,900
Scott: You're just exploiting the human brain to take money out of the wallet that is attached, that that brain is associated with.

318
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:18,197
Rym: But the third thing that's going on right now, why was this bought?

319
00:20:18,257 --> 00:20:18,860
Rym: What's happening?

320
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:27,140
Rym: Games that have something more going on don't make enough money and capitalism is pushing us to the extremes.

321
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:35,880
Rym: This is why you're seeing so many gaming companies and so many everything companies pushing into the two final frontiers of late capitalism.

322
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:42,880
Rym: NFT cryptocurrency bullshit and minimally viable shovelware.

323
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:48,335
Scott: Take two, it's like, well, we make real games, let's not make enough money, let's buy Zynga.

324
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:50,000
Scott: Well, we're still rich.

325
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:56,020
Scott: And then you also got, you know, Konami for many, many years has basically abandoned real games effectively.

326
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,239
Rym: Now they're just selling like Castlevania NFTs.

327
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,460
Scott: Yeah, it's been a long time since they've made a real game, effectively speaking.

328
00:21:03,202 --> 00:21:21,100
Rym: But the problem you're going to have to grapple with if you're a gamer of any kind, casual, super hardcore, trained, whatever, is that the entire global industry around games, just like every global industry, will make more money from this kind of crap than anything that you're probably interacting with.

329
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:24,270
Rym: And this is going to get way worse before it gets better.

330
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:26,779
Rym: This is the exact same pressure that's causing NFTs.

331
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:39,240
Scott: Well, I mean, it's just a thing where, you know, if you look at movies, right, other forms of art, you know, music, right, is they all trended towards, right, this lowest common denominator, right?

332
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:54,480
Scott: Pop music, you know, blockbuster, you know, movies and away from, you know, other things that didn't make a lot of money, but games were able to take a step further, right, into pure exploitation, right?

333
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,312
Scott: It's like, we don't need, we can go past, you know, just blockbuster video game.

334
00:21:58,352 --> 00:21:59,556
Scott: We don't need to stop there, right?

335
00:21:59,596 --> 00:22:01,020
Scott: We can just go and become a casino.

336
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:08,940
Scott: A movie can't, if movies could become casinos, Hollywood would have become casino operators, but that medium does not allow for it.

337
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,320
Rym: Yep.

338
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:17,780
Rym: And it all comes down to, to make things, we did it, we did a panel on this in ancient times, you need the before money to make anything.

339
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:26,200
Rym: But the only people who are willing to give you before money in late capitalism are people who expect you to give them back some multiple of the before money they gave you.

340
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:29,984
Rym: So, uh, keep an eye on this.

341
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:36,676
Rym: This is just one drop in the bucket of a massive consolidation and race to the bottom in every industry on earth.

342
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:38,139
Rym: That's only going to get worse.

343
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:38,820
Rym: and technology...

344
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,519
Scott: It's been happening and it's still happening.

345
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:56,460
Rym: Well, to tie this back into a Monday show specifically, it's happening the fastest in the more, the more digital and less tied to a physical reality a company or a product is, the faster this trend is going to happen.

346
00:22:56,881 --> 00:23:03,235
Rym: Because it's easier to race to the bottom on software than it is to race to the bottom on something physical you make in a factory.

347
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:05,100
Rym: It'll still happen.

348
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,200
Scott: And things physical you make in a factory are already at the bottom.

349
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,906
Rym: They're so close to the bottom.

350
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,314
Rym: Go look for a KN95 mask on Amazon right now.

351
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,656
Scott: The only thing keeping them off the absolute bottom is like people still won't buy like, you know, something made of lead.

352
00:23:20,676 --> 00:23:22,420
Scott: Otherwise they would.

353
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,650
Rym: Except a lot of countries have basically prevented you from knowing if something has lead in it.

354
00:23:26,691 --> 00:23:29,799
Rym: And frankly, I don't trust half the stuff on Amazon to not have lead in it.

355
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:31,299
Scott: It's true.

356
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:36,198
Rym: I mean, I would not trust any N95 or KN95 masks that I got on Amazon right now.

357
00:23:37,003 --> 00:23:38,072
Scott: Well, yeah, pretty much.

358
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:38,940
Scott: I don't, I can't.

359
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:39,780
Scott: Right?

360
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:57,260
Rym: So in some science news that is big deal news, this is, there are a lot of insane, very important scientific advancements that have happened over the last two years that haven't gotten a lot of attention because COVID is, of course, like this omnipresent threat.

361
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:03,520
Rym: But we just successfully launched the most complex space telescope in human history.

362
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,886
Rym: This thing is fucking gigantic.

363
00:24:06,006 --> 00:24:08,934
Rym: It is like, you really got to understand how big this thing is.

364
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:11,340
Rym: It like unfolded itself in space.

365
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:19,480
Rym: It's the successor to Hubble and it weighs half what Hubble did because material science has advanced so much.

366
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:27,580
Rym: Like astronomy and space science has advanced in ways that even nerds like just don't have the energy to pay attention to right now.

367
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:35,540
Rym: I urge you to go, if you don't have time, to read like the details of what the James Webb Space Telescope is capable of.

368
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:41,020
Rym: I'm going to link to a nine minute video that actually very succinctly explains everything going on with this.

369
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:43,659
Rym: And if you care, you can read much more about it.

370
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:52,060
Rym: But this thing is, this is like ridiculous sci-fi nonsense and material science is what made it happen.

371
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,660
Rym: NASA's still doing stuff and we'll be able to see some pictures soon enough, I guess.

372
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,460
Rym: But this thing, it mostly focuses on infrared space stuff like infrared.

373
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,825
Scott: Oh, yeah, because of redshift.

374
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:04,046
Scott: Right.

375
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:04,508
Scott: You're good.

376
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:07,200
Scott: That's how you if you want to see something further away.

377
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:07,922
Scott: Right.

378
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:08,464
Scott: It's like.

379
00:25:08,745 --> 00:25:13,020
Scott: but also that thing, even if that far away thing was like, you know, purple.

380
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,810
Scott: It's like, you know, which is more higher frequency.

381
00:25:16,871 --> 00:25:19,940
Scott: It's like by the time that purple light gets to us, it's all stretched out.

382
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:22,980
Scott: So you need an infrared camera to see further away things.

383
00:25:23,662 --> 00:25:23,722
Rym: Yep.

384
00:25:23,742 --> 00:25:26,560
Rym: And further away also means further back in time.

385
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:35,120
Rym: The James Webb Space Telescope will theoretically be able to start inspecting some of the earliest planets that were ever formed in the universe.

386
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,900
Rym: Some of the earliest stars that were ever formed in the universe.

387
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,060
Scott: Yeah.

388
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:45,037
Scott: I mean, you know, it's also why when you look out into space with your own eyeball that can only see visible light, you get everything's black.

389
00:25:45,158 --> 00:25:51,493
Scott: because it's like, yeah, there might be something there, but it's redshifted so much that there's any light coming from the mirror on.

390
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:54,640
Rym: this thing is twenty one feet in diameter.

391
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:56,423
Scott: That's good.

392
00:25:57,245 --> 00:26:01,860
Scott: So the question I have is like, first of all, right, is, you know, there's always people always joke.

393
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:03,868
Scott: And I know the answer to this.

394
00:26:03,968 --> 00:26:04,129
Scott: Right.

395
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:07,000
Scott: But it's like when they're making these telescopes, they always make a big deal.

396
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,720
Scott: Like you got to be in a clean room with no dust and everything super fragile.

397
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:12,524
Scott: And then they slap it on a rocket like.

398
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:19,260
Scott: And it's like, yeah, I understand why, you know, they had to be so gentle with it on Earth.

399
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:26,676
Scott: But the other thing that I've been thinking about is, you know, well, why don't they?

400
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:28,520
Scott: just you know, it's really slow.

401
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,609
Scott: Even the best telescopes they put in space are kind of slow at taking photos.

402
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,552
Scott: Right.

403
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:36,920
Scott: So why not just have two?

404
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:42,600
Scott: And it's like, well, if they start making another one now by the you know, they can make a better one than this already.

405
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:48,280
Rym: That's actually that is a big part of how space research is generally planned.

406
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:55,540
Rym: The idea that you get something out there in general, not just space telescopes, but anything with space, you get something out there to do initial research.

407
00:26:55,961 --> 00:27:02,540
Rym: But you don't want to keep putting the same thing out there because science does advance so fast and materials and everything.

408
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:11,420
Rym: Like if we tried to send if we tried to send something to Mars today, we could probably get something there faster if we just started later.

409
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:14,388
Scott: Yeah, because we would beat ourselves.

410
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:17,620
Scott: We would beat that thing in a race to Mars with something we made later.

411
00:27:18,242 --> 00:27:20,739
Rym: And especially if you look at deep space research.

412
00:27:22,121 --> 00:27:22,422
Scott: Yep.

413
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:30,120
Scott: But what you could have done right is, I guess, if things were funded properly by taxing rich people so much that we could afford to take care of everyone on Earth.

414
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,526
Scott: And then even have money left over for space.

415
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:33,287
Scott: Right.

416
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:38,520
Scott: Then what you could have done is like, yeah, you could have just built two at once.

417
00:27:40,121 --> 00:27:42,451
Rym: And then I see you saw contact.

418
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:44,580
Rym: Why build one when you can build two for twice the price?

419
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,021
Scott: Exactly.

420
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:54,460
Scott: It's like you could, you know, it's like building the same one again makes no sense because we could if we started building a new space telescope today, we could outdo this one.

421
00:27:54,881 --> 00:28:01,200
Scott: But if we had just for every time we made a piece for this one, made like four pieces that were identical.

422
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,867
Rym: I can explain that a little bit.

423
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:05,140
Rym: One is we don't have enough budget for that because, you know.

424
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:05,862
Scott: That's what I said.

425
00:28:05,902 --> 00:28:11,440
Scott: That's why I pay for this instead of paying for guns or, you know, tax cuts for rich people.

426
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,020
Rym: What I'll point to is, you know, you know that crazy man making his marble machine?

427
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,331
Scott: Yeah.

428
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,680
Scott: So that kind of... He could have made two pieces and made two marble machines.

429
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:34,780
Rym: No, actually, because this kind of device that is made generally like this kind of complex device is made basically bespoke and adapted and tweaked in terms of its own physical reality.

430
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,501
Rym: So it is.

431
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:41,659
Rym: it is not actually in any way efficient to make two of them at the same time.

432
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,699
Rym: You don't gain anything from doing that because they'll both...

433
00:28:47,406 --> 00:28:48,612
Scott: You gain a telescope.

434
00:28:49,115 --> 00:28:50,160
Scott: You gain a second telescope.

435
00:28:50,624 --> 00:28:52,139
Rym: Yeah, but then you also have to launch it?

436
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,959
Scott: You could put one on each side of the Earth.

437
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,388
Rym: This is out at like Grange Point 2.

438
00:28:57,388 --> 00:29:00,100
Rym: This is way different from what we've done before.

439
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,721
Scott: You could put it at the next Grange Point 3.

440
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:04,250
Scott: There's more than one is what I'm saying.

441
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,760
Scott: They don't have to occupy the same spot.

442
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,620
Rym: But anyway, I encourage you to at least learn a little bit about what it took to get James Webb up there.

443
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:18,320
Rym: Because this is one of the most important advances in astronomy in human history.

444
00:29:19,102 --> 00:29:22,910
Scott: It's also fascinating that like even the ridiculous space telescope is.

445
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,240
Scott: fundamentally it's the same as a digital camera attached to a telescope.

446
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,684
Scott: It's not like.

447
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:29,386
Scott: that's all it is.

448
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:33,580
Scott: There's nothing different about it other than that it's big and fancier.

449
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,179
Scott: It's the same fundamental idea.

450
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,020
Rym: Most of the difficulty is how do you unfold this thing in space and how do you shield it from the Sun?

451
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,200
Scott: Yep, but it's still just a giant digital camera.

452
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,580
Scott: Yeah, the sensor, lens, mirrors.

453
00:29:46,223 --> 00:29:49,740
Rym: So last news, and this actually is a direct segue into our main bit.

454
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:58,380
Rym: The NPM package manager, which many of you probably know and hate, had two libraries.

455
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Rym: Faker.js, or packages, and colors.js.

456
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:03,740
Rym: Widely used, very popular.

457
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,640
Rym: The individual who made these libraries.

458
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:15,900
Scott: One of the maintainers of those who I guess had permissions to push to the, you know, they released some updates that were malicious.

459
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:24,258
Rym: They rolled out version 6.6.6, which was not the next version anyone expected because 5.5.3 was the last version.

460
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:35,520
Scott: Anyone who had, yeah, anyone who's, you know, package.json file specified give me the newest version as opposed to give me this specific locked in version.

461
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:38,780
Rym: So they got this package.

462
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,190
Rym: So if I got colors 6.6.6 or fakers 6.6.6, these were logic bombs.

463
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,800
Rym: They were sabotaged.

464
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,100
Rym: They would just infinitely output strange characters and the words liberty over and over and over again.

465
00:30:54,402 --> 00:30:57,279
Rym: They would just destroy any project that used them.

466
00:30:57,861 --> 00:31:09,460
Scott: Yeah, the person who was behind this seems to have been disgruntled by the fact that they wrote all this code that is being used so widely by for-profit companies, which is like, yeah, that's how open source works.

467
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,031
Rym: Yeah, there are licenses that preclude that.

468
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:13,920
Rym: There's a reason no one uses those licenses.

469
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:20,600
Scott: But also B, this person seems to have gone down a conspiracy theory hole and has some issues.

470
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,720
Rym: Oh yeah, I will not repeat.

471
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,005
Scott: It's not about the person.

472
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:26,560
Scott: It's really, it's about package management, which we're going to talk about in the main vid.

473
00:31:26,861 --> 00:31:27,081
Rym: Yep.

474
00:31:27,543 --> 00:31:33,500
Rym: So yeah, if you, thankfully, if you use either of these, you already know about this problem.

475
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:41,480
Rym: And even further, NPM and everyone involved basically forced a regression to the previous known good version.

476
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,680
Rym: This person is not able to push further updates.

477
00:31:45,400 --> 00:32:00,060
Rym: And well, you can read the article to see all the details, but in the end, to tie this to the main vid, the problem and the sort of, with all things, is that if you want to use anything anyone else made, at some point you have to trust another person.

478
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:09,300
Rym: And how we navigate that, like trust, and also how we compensate people who make things, is an unresolved problem in society.

479
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,087
Rym: Like, that's a difficult problem to solve.

480
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:14,160
Rym: If there were easy solutions to this, we would not have NPM.

481
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:23,114
Scott: But anyway, things of the day!

482
00:32:23,395 --> 00:32:25,460
Rym: So this is just a really cute little thing.

483
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:33,880
Rym: This YouTube channel has some fun animatics, but this is little shorts, like 30 second clips, animatics but extremely well drawn.

484
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:42,200
Rym: It's basically if Seinfeld was furries drawn in the mid-90s Disney Afternoon style.

485
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,767
Rym: Really, really well done.

486
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:49,400
Rym: Seinfeld, Newman, George, Elaine, like, everything about this is perfect.

487
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,557
Rym: If this were fully animated, and this were on TV, I would watch every goddamn second of it.

488
00:32:54,617 --> 00:32:55,360
Rym: It's just delightful.

489
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,221
Scott: Okay.

490
00:32:58,362 --> 00:33:12,800
Scott: So I don't think I've used this guy as a thing of the day before, but there's a YouTube channel that's been around for years, and I just didn't know about it until recently, run by someone named Ben Eater, E-A-T-E-R, like a person who eats named Ben.

491
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,239
Rym: Or one who eats Ben's.

492
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,341
Scott: Maybe.

493
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,344
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

494
00:33:18,307 --> 00:33:22,760
Scott: And Ben Eater seems to be an expert at like electrical computer engineering.

495
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:35,397
Scott: You know, and basically has videos showing you how to, just using breadboards, chips, wires, you know, make, you know, a 6802 computer, right?

496
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,736
Scott: Make, you know, make computers out of nothing, right?

497
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:42,860
Scott: As a learning exercise.

498
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:46,632
Scott: And, you know, so the whole channel is thing of the day worthy.

499
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:49,040
Scott: I just didn't know about it until recently.

500
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:54,080
Scott: But the one thing I really want to highlight is the series of world's shittiest video card.

501
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,389
Scott: He basically makes a video card out of nothing.

502
00:33:58,429 --> 00:33:59,893
Scott: He starts on the VGA side.

503
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:02,240
Scott: He's like, look, I got a monitor and I got a VGA cable.

504
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:08,620
Scott: I have to make something that sends a signal into the VGA cable that will display an image on the monitor.

505
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:20,040
Scott: And he works backwards from that to, you know, bits in an image file in an EEPROM and basically with a few breadboards or three of them makes a video card effect.

506
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,666
Scott: It's technically a video card.

507
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,239
Scott: Yeah, it's the world's shittiest video, but it works.

508
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,228
Scott: And the other thing is, I guess, you know, I was not sponsored in any way.

509
00:34:30,288 --> 00:34:36,900
Scott: I've never talked to this person, but on their website, they sell kits where you can buy world's shittiest video card and put it together yourself.

510
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,444
Rym: It actually does seem pretty fun.

511
00:34:40,185 --> 00:34:43,893
Scott: It does seem like a lot of fun, but the reason I didn't do it is because what am I going to do?

512
00:34:43,993 --> 00:34:47,300
Scott: Buy it, put it together, it'll display an image and then I'm done.

513
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:55,880
Rym: I'd probably make it display a different image maybe a couple of times and then I'd be done and it would go into the closet with all my other electronics.

514
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,473
Rym: And then five years from now, I would find it, go, what the fuck is this?

515
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:01,000
Rym: And throw it away.

516
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,792
Scott: It would be a fun thing just to do for a weekend, but then it's like, what do I do with it now?

517
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:10,600
Scott: Would I really make it my main hobby and build upon it?

518
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,728
Rym: You know what would be a real fun thing to do?

519
00:35:12,808 --> 00:35:15,580
Rym: Buy a bunch of these for some computer camp post-COVID?

520
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,141
Scott: Absolutely.

521
00:35:17,221 --> 00:35:25,820
Scott: If anyone out there is doing computer education stuff, the kit to make your own computer and then program it, just buy one for every kid.

522
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:35,660
Scott: They could all build them and then either take them home or keep them and then use it again next time you have the next class.

523
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:46,460
Rym: There's just something really visceral because you look at a video card and it's so complex that there is no way to interrogate that complexity unless you are a supreme expert in graphics and all this stuff.

524
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:56,900
Rym: But to see what is technically a video card with a breadboard on the scale that I used in elementary school when I learned how adders work, that actually works.

525
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:04,720
Rym: Taking a kid through this collection of wires that you can look at and actually understand is making an image appear on a screen.

526
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:12,113
Scott: The video card in your computer, your 3080, is not fundamentally different from a digital camera strapped to a mirror telescope.

527
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:25,878
Scott: This shitty video card is not really, other than the lack of the GPU, is not fundamentally different from the bit that your 3080 is.

528
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:33,200
Rym: In fact, in some ways it's a lot like early video processing on pre-GPU devices.

529
00:36:34,381 --> 00:36:42,820
Scott: The only real difference is that your 3080, you could just send your 3080 a bitmap image and say show this on the screen and it will.

530
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:57,180
Scott: But you also could just send it some numbers and say a sphere here and a texture there and a texture and then it will render that with the GPU and to create an image to put into the frame buffer in that way.

531
00:36:57,641 --> 00:37:07,380
Scott: And that's really the only feature that the GPU offers that this thing, other than higher resolution, higher frame rate modes and display port and HDMI.

532
00:37:08,422 --> 00:37:10,020
Rym: And CUDA cores and parallel processing.

533
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:13,552
Scott: But it's still fundamentally the same thing.

534
00:37:13,874 --> 00:37:15,160
Scott: A video card is a video card.

535
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,763
Rym: And this is a topic I think about a lot.

536
00:37:16,923 --> 00:37:25,000
Rym: I think as technology progresses, one of the most important things we can do in schools is to integrate technology alongside everything else.

537
00:37:25,481 --> 00:37:34,620
Rym: And I do think there is a place for having kids learn technology by making and using what we would consider very shitty computers.

538
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,518
Rym: I learn more trying to make a TI-85 do what I want it to do.

539
00:37:39,902 --> 00:37:40,738
Rym: And there's a line there.

540
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:52,660
Scott: It's like even though there's a huge gap between this and the things that people currently use, if you understand this, well then you're way more good to go than you realize.

541
00:37:54,243 --> 00:37:58,000
Scott: All that in-between stuff is just faster with more features.

542
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:05,920
Rym: Imagine if throughout school, like in first grade, you start building a really simple adder and as you go through school, you keep adding to this device.

543
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,519
Rym: It becomes more and more complex as you go through school.

544
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,943
Rym: I think a lot about that.

545
00:38:11,003 --> 00:38:11,906
Rym: Not that I have any power.

546
00:38:12,227 --> 00:38:15,800
Rym: Talk about things that are a negative priority for the US government.

547
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:22,239
Rym: So yeah, in the meta moment, the GeekNights book club book, Tale of Genji, we are nearing the end.

548
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,422
Scott: There are.

549
00:38:24,883 --> 00:38:26,387
Scott: So the Kindle lies to you.

550
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:31,880
Scott: It thinks the end of the book is like after all the notes and credits and, you know, footnote things.

551
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,681
Scott: The actual end of the book is on page 1119.

552
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:39,748
Scott: So I am currently on page 966.

553
00:38:39,748 --> 00:38:40,531
Scott: I have 153 pages left.

554
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,135
Scott: I am 87% done, even though the Kindle tells me I'm 67% done.

555
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:52,735
Scott: So the end is nigh because I've read more than 150 pages in the past week.

556
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,080
Scott: I was on page 700 something last week.

557
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,118
Scott: So we're going to be done this week, I guess, right?

558
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:01,360
Scott: Maybe.

559
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,905
Rym: I won't be done till the end of the month.

560
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:07,420
Rym: I got about 14 chapters still to read, but I blow through them.

561
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,860
Rym: So the only thing that slows me down is every time I finish a chapter, I'm going back.

562
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,659
Scott: There are some long chapters towards the end.

563
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,400
Rym: That's the only caveat, but I'm confident.

564
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:22,299
Scott: The chapter I'm in right now, the Kindle estimated would have taken me 90 minutes total, but I fell asleep while I was reading it last night.

565
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:32,580
Rym: But every time I finish a chapter, I'm going back and reading a summary of that chapter to make sure I didn't miss anything super important or obvious.

566
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,480
Scott: Well, once you get past chapter 40 something, it's like it's hard to miss anything.

567
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,368
Rym: A lot less happens per chapter.

568
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:48,960
Rym: So yeah, I think like the first week of February, we're going to do it one to three shows on Genji.

569
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:51,076
Scott: We got to make it worth it.

570
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,380
Scott: I have picked the next book because I get to pick the next book.

571
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:00,180
Scott: I'm basically going to go on a fiesta of, it'll be like once I finish it, it'll be like a great weight is lifted.

572
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,460
Scott: I'm going to go on like a fiesta of, you know, reading other things.

573
00:40:05,422 --> 00:40:07,639
Scott: Yeah, the next book will be The Count of Monte Cristo.

574
00:40:08,984 --> 00:40:09,439
Rym: No, it won't.

575
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,299
Rym: Granted, I have been meaning to read that again.

576
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,718
Rym: I do really like that book.

577
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:15,878
Rym: Not anytime soon.

578
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,440
Scott: I learned my lesson.

579
00:40:19,645 --> 00:40:20,339
Rym: I'm glad I read it.

580
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:22,480
Rym: I've learned a lot so far and I still got to do it.

581
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,920
Scott: Yeah, no, I don't regret reading it, you know, but I still learned my lesson.

582
00:40:29,102 --> 00:40:31,420
Rym: We're not going to any cons anytime soon, obviously.

583
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,278
Rym: Please don't go anywhere if you can avoid it.

584
00:40:34,063 --> 00:40:37,640
Rym: The world's in deep shit right now with Omicron and COVID in general.

585
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,440
Rym: The last con I was at without Scott was PAX Unplugged and there was video of that panel.

586
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,560
Rym: Like I promised, you didn't need to be there.

587
00:40:44,702 --> 00:40:45,319
Rym: It's on YouTube.

588
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,260
Rym: You can hear me just fine despite the fact that I'm wearing a mask.

589
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,620
Rym: Rare game mechanics.

590
00:40:50,141 --> 00:40:50,959
Rym: I'm proud of that panel.

591
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:54,419
Rym: I don't think I have anything more to say on that topic, so I don't know if I'll ever do it again.

592
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,060
Rym: And otherwise, just stay tuned.

593
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,080
Rym: We're working on a ton of stuff.

594
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,720
Rym: Scott's cranking through our new website with the designer.

595
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,217
Scott: Working on the new website, yeah.

596
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:07,400
Rym: I'm working on, I poked more at the timecode stuff we're trying to do.

597
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:13,560
Rym: I think I can render out an MP3 with a library that does what you want, but I'm going to do a little bit of testing.

598
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:22,680
Scott: Yeah, let us know if there are any features you want on the website besides things I already know like, yeah, the search is going to not suck.

599
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,139
Scott: I'm going to make the best search, don't worry.

600
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,320
Scott: If you have any good ideas that don't exist already.

601
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,700
Scott: Also, you know, we got a Discord.

602
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,460
Scott: If you tell me an idea I already know, I'm going to tell you, yeah, I know already.

603
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,080
Scott: So, make sure, but don't let that scare you away.

604
00:41:40,783 --> 00:41:42,840
Scott: It doesn't hurt you for me to tell you, yes, I know.

605
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,300
Rym: In fact, come into the Discord, if you haven't joined it.

606
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,579
Rym: Our Discord is pretty happening and chill, and just talk to us there about it.

607
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:55,280
Rym: At some point, we're probably going to start also live streaming the show into a Discord stage.

608
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:59,160
Rym: And I'm working on a pipeline to do call-in shows occasionally.

609
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:00,559
Rym: We're not going to overdo that.

610
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,219
Rym: Kind of just waiting for video to also be in there.

611
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,380
Rym: But that's one thing I'm working on, especially now that I've finished some other projects that had nothing to do with GeekNights.

612
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:16,300
Rym: And we're working on some non-convention panels that we might do in the next few months, if it turns out that we're not going to any cons in 2022.

613
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,340
Rym: Just do a panel for nobody, just for nothing.

614
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,559
Rym: Just, hey, it's Tuesday, here's a panel, because that's actually kind of fun to do.

615
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,219
Rym: But we want to get the website and some other stuff done first.

616
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:28,785
Rym: That's all I got.

617
00:42:28,805 --> 00:42:31,940
Rym: Stay safe out there, and let's talk about package managers.

618
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,020
Rym: And there's a bunch of different topics in this space.

619
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,000
Scott: Yeah, we might have done an episode on this an incredibly long time ago, I think, related to operating system package managers.

620
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,728
Rym: Yeah, I'll take that.

621
00:42:41,748 --> 00:42:42,740
Scott: I did look that up before.

622
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,280
Scott: Last week, you want to listen to last week's show about libraries first.

623
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,620
Scott: Because package managers are basically part of the dynamic loading library solution.

624
00:42:53,362 --> 00:43:00,160
Scott: So, you know, most people are used to Windows or Mac.

625
00:43:00,961 --> 00:43:10,960
Scott: And for a long time, the way you would install software on such a computer was like, you know, get either a floppy to CD-ROM or download of a setup.exe and then run it.

626
00:43:11,481 --> 00:43:12,225
Scott: And then that would in.

627
00:43:12,266 --> 00:43:14,899
Scott: so you would get software and install it on its own.

628
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:23,120
Scott: And all these different softwares that were coming from different places would be installed alongside each other on the same computer.

629
00:43:23,641 --> 00:43:25,870
Scott: Sometimes cause problems, sometimes not.

630
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:28,080
Scott: There are ways to make it work, right?

631
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,517
Rym: And many of these things were monolithic executables that didn't even depend on anything.

632
00:43:32,597 --> 00:43:33,320
Rym: Not everything, though.

633
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:33,981
Scott: Yeah.

634
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:36,840
Scott: Like we said, if they're statically loading, it's not an issue, right?

635
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,000
Scott: If they're dynamically loading libraries, then they need to bring those libraries along with them.

636
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:50,280
Scott: And if there's conflicts, you know, those libraries, different versions of the library have to live alongside each other and load the correct ones, all kinds of things going on there.

637
00:43:51,923 --> 00:43:53,186
Scott: So the question is, well, what?

638
00:43:53,447 --> 00:43:58,440
Scott: in the Unix world, Linux especially, what they were doing was something different.

639
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:07,180
Scott: Because the software was free and open source, you didn't have to go and get the software from the person who made the software.

640
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:07,510
Scott: You could.

641
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:12,820
Scott: You could, but it was legal to redistribute the software.

642
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:21,900
Scott: So distributions, Linux distributions, what a Linux distribution is, is basically someone who went out and picked a whole bunch of software.

643
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:28,840
Scott: And they said, I have chosen this set of software to use together on top of the Linux kernel that I have also customized.

644
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,747
Scott: Download this from me.

645
00:44:32,008 --> 00:44:35,480
Scott: You can just download all the software from me only and not from anyone else.

646
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:44,240
Scott: And then I will maintain this repository of software, which is redistributed copies of the software.

647
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:48,460
Scott: And I've prepared it all in such a way that it all goes together nicely.

648
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:52,520
Scott: And you're going to update versions and apply security patches.

649
00:44:52,962 --> 00:44:58,340
Scott: And I'm going to maintain a cohesive ecosystem of software that all works together.

650
00:44:58,762 --> 00:44:58,962
Scott: Right.

651
00:44:59,123 --> 00:45:03,540
Scott: All the versions are in alignment with each other and all the libraries are, you know.

652
00:45:04,022 --> 00:45:07,120
Scott: And it's like they do all the work for you.

653
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:17,520
Scott: And when you want to install something, you just say, hey, apt get install Firefox app, get install, you know, lib SSL app, get install Python, whatever software you need.

654
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,337
Scott: You just type apt install or yum install or whatever it is.

655
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:23,026
Scott: And portage.

656
00:45:23,066 --> 00:45:23,188
Rym: Yeah.

657
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,522
Scott: Pac-Man, I don't know.

658
00:45:27,244 --> 00:45:34,840
Scott: And there's a piece of software that is like the package manager that connects to a repository somewhere where all the software is.

659
00:45:35,421 --> 00:45:39,460
Scott: And it goes and it downloads the right files and it has instructions on how to install it.

660
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:42,620
Scott: And it also knows what other software is needed.

661
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:44,349
Scott: It's like, oh, you want to install that?

662
00:45:44,429 --> 00:45:46,339
Scott: Well, you're going to need these three other things also.

663
00:45:47,102 --> 00:45:47,887
Scott: Do you have those?

664
00:45:47,988 --> 00:45:48,471
Scott: Oh, you don't.

665
00:45:48,532 --> 00:45:49,680
Scott: Well, you're going to need, you know.

666
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,706
Scott: Oh, you do have them.

667
00:45:50,786 --> 00:45:52,316
Scott: OK, well, then you don't need to install them.

668
00:45:52,336 --> 00:45:53,020
Scott: You've got them already.

669
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:57,300
Rym: Now, those Linux distributions, you could just install software you get on your own.

670
00:45:57,722 --> 00:45:58,909
Rym: And there's a bunch of different ways.

671
00:45:58,969 --> 00:45:59,774
Rym: Linux supported that.

672
00:45:59,794 --> 00:46:00,900
Rym: we're not really going to cover that today.

673
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:06,380
Rym: Like the simplistic way was you put executables in like opt, you know.

674
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,520
Scott: But so that's the other thing is that there were two kinds, at least as far as Linux distributions go.

675
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,780
Scott: There's source distributions and binary distributions.

676
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:15,161
Scott: Right.

677
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:22,620
Scott: Because some software is just, you know, for interpreted languages like, you know, Python or Perl and or Ruby.

678
00:46:23,764 --> 00:46:24,988
Scott: And it's not compiled.

679
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:28,300
Scott: So when you send someone the software, you're literally sending them the source code.

680
00:46:28,961 --> 00:46:35,460
Scott: But some programs are written in compiled languages like C or Pascal or whatever.

681
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:56,460
Scott: And so in those cases, it's like, well, you could compile the program and send someone the executable, or you could send someone the source code, the C source code, and also have them install the compiler and compile it on their own computer themselves.

682
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:03,680
Scott: And so that's what's called a source distribution like Gentoo or, you know, I think I don't know if Arch Linux still does that or not.

683
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:04,526
Scott: I don't know.

684
00:47:04,607 --> 00:47:06,059
Scott: There are some source distributions out there.

685
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:09,440
Rym: Yeah, I'm so far beyond even using Linux in my day to day life anymore.

686
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,462
Rym: But I do remember this.

687
00:47:10,763 --> 00:47:18,700
Rym: as a kid, like the first time I used Linux, the idea of a package manager was kind of shocking to me because that was not something that existed in the Windows ecosystem.

688
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,326
Scott: People didn't really.

689
00:47:20,346 --> 00:47:23,120
Scott: A lot of people who go and try to use Linux for the first time.

690
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,327
Scott: It's like that's the biggest.

691
00:47:24,367 --> 00:47:26,460
Scott: It's like it's actually easier when you think about it.

692
00:47:26,821 --> 00:47:27,245
Scott: Same thing.

693
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:28,778
Scott: It's like App Store on iOS.

694
00:47:28,838 --> 00:47:29,020
Scott: Right.

695
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:31,499
Scott: It's like, yeah, all your apps, you get them from one place.

696
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:38,240
Scott: You know, Windows and Mac have both moved towards the Linux model of having effectively an app store.

697
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:44,620
Rym: It's very notably, though, that like most people I know and even myself, I know what I know uses the Windows App Store.

698
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,642
Rym: They still just install things.

699
00:47:45,702 --> 00:47:46,323
Scott: I use it.

700
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:53,940
Scott: I there are for the really basic apps that are like, you know, like Spotify or, you know, these major apps.

701
00:47:54,301 --> 00:47:59,300
Scott: I install them from the Windows App Store because then they auto update without having their own update like iTunes.

702
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:06,860
Scott: It's better to get iTunes from the Windows App Store than from using the Apple installer, because then you won't have to deal with the Apple updater.

703
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:08,424
Scott: Right.

704
00:48:08,444 --> 00:48:10,760
Scott: You'll just get these automatic updates from the Windows store.

705
00:48:11,201 --> 00:48:18,120
Rym: It also got complicated because like Steam effectively became almost an app store just for games.

706
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:24,279
Scott: Steam is a package manager effectively, but each game sort of installs entirely on its own in its own little world.

707
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,520
Rym: They're over the era where every game would independently install its own copy of some redistributable libraries and all that.

708
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:31,465
Scott: But they still do that.

709
00:48:31,485 --> 00:48:33,218
Scott: You have DirectX every time, you know.

710
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:34,659
Scott: It's gotten a lot better.

711
00:48:35,822 --> 00:48:36,003
Scott: Right.

712
00:48:36,043 --> 00:48:37,831
Scott: So that's that's what a package manager is.

713
00:48:37,891 --> 00:48:38,072
Scott: Right.

714
00:48:38,132 --> 00:48:39,940
Scott: But there's this next level.

715
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,271
Scott: And this is where the libraries that we talked about two weeks ago are relevant.

716
00:48:43,592 --> 00:48:45,840
Scott: is that let's say you're writing a program.

717
00:48:46,261 --> 00:48:46,462
Scott: Right.

718
00:48:46,502 --> 00:48:51,158
Scott: Let's say I'm writing a, you know, I don't know, a C a C a C++ program.

719
00:48:51,861 --> 00:48:52,062
Scott: Right.

720
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:54,937
Scott: And, you know, so I need a C++ compiler.

721
00:48:55,761 --> 00:49:02,299
Scott: So I'm sitting on this computer running whatever next distribution and I go install, you know, GCC, G++.

722
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:03,301
Scott: Right.

723
00:49:03,763 --> 00:49:10,140
Scott: Well, what if that version, you know, that there's only one version of G++ available from the distribution.

724
00:49:10,582 --> 00:49:10,764
Scott: Right.

725
00:49:10,825 --> 00:49:12,059
Scott: And that's the version you're going to get.

726
00:49:12,603 --> 00:49:13,839
Scott: What if I want a newer version?

727
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:19,800
Rym: Some distributions will have things like you can tell it like it'll have a couple other options and you can enable a flag.

728
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:23,912
Scott: You could you could apply a PPA like, you know, adjust where you get.

729
00:49:23,952 --> 00:49:26,200
Scott: you tell it to get software from a different location.

730
00:49:26,641 --> 00:49:30,400
Scott: You know, like you can hook up to like the Postgres PPA to get newer database versions.

731
00:49:30,741 --> 00:49:32,164
Scott: Things like that are available.

732
00:49:32,244 --> 00:49:39,900
Scott: But, you know, it's like you want to divert from the norm and it's like, OK, and then you go ahead, you get you get your different compiler.

733
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:40,802
Scott: All right, you're good.

734
00:49:40,902 --> 00:49:43,669
Scott: And then it's like, well, now you want to.

735
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,660
Scott: you're writing a program and the program you're writing, you want to use a library.

736
00:49:48,101 --> 00:49:57,260
Scott: But, you know, so it's like, well, my distribution provides library version three, but I want to write a program using library version four or a different library.

737
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,052
Scott: Maybe I'm working on two different projects.

738
00:50:00,092 --> 00:50:02,020
Scott: I have two different software projects I'm working on.

739
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,653
Scott: One of them uses library version three and one of them uses four.

740
00:50:06,014 --> 00:50:07,339
Scott: What the hell do I do about that?

741
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:07,480
Scott: Right.

742
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,350
Scott: What the hell do I do about that?

743
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:09,994
Scott: Right.

744
00:50:10,055 --> 00:50:10,739
Scott: There's all these issues.

745
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:19,620
Scott: So what's come to be is that most major programming languages these days, I think Perl was the first major one.

746
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:26,220
Scott: I remember with CPAN, they have their own separate package manager for the programming language.

747
00:50:26,862 --> 00:50:27,082
Scott: Right.

748
00:50:27,102 --> 00:50:33,540
Scott: So Python has PyPI, Ruby has Ruby gems, you know, Node JavaScript has NPM.

749
00:50:33,941 --> 00:50:34,062
Scott: Right.

750
00:50:34,082 --> 00:50:35,647
Scott: Which is the worst garbage one.

751
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:39,180
Scott: It's really poorly managed in general.

752
00:50:40,862 --> 00:50:41,964
Scott: And it's basically so.

753
00:50:42,004 --> 00:50:57,860
Scott: now on top of your operating system package manager, where you're installing software for like the global system, you're also have a separate package manager to install libraries specific to a particular programming language.

754
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:08,860
Scott: And then on top of that, you have like environment managing things or Docker or containers or whatever you're going to use to when you're working on different projects.

755
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:09,502
Scott: Right.

756
00:51:09,522 --> 00:51:11,348
Scott: It's like project one install.

757
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:15,340
Scott: When I install things for project one, don't install them on the global system.

758
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:19,733
Scott: Use the Python package manager to install libraries in this box.

759
00:51:20,194 --> 00:51:22,140
Scott: You know, virtual environment is what they call it.

760
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,390
Scott: And then I'm working on a different project now.

761
00:51:24,731 --> 00:51:26,620
Scott: And when I install things, put them in this box.

762
00:51:27,082 --> 00:51:31,720
Scott: And that way you can have different versions of your Python, different versions of libraries, different.

763
00:51:32,261 --> 00:51:36,629
Scott: And then you got to publish libraries.

764
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:36,990
Scott: Right.

765
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,834
Scott: It's like this thing just never ends.

766
00:51:38,914 --> 00:51:42,140
Scott: It's like this is like, you know, turtles all the way down.

767
00:51:42,481 --> 00:51:42,701
Rym: Yeah.

768
00:51:42,781 --> 00:51:49,740
Rym: And if you work in a big company, you've probably got internal package repositories for things that other teams have made in your own company.

769
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:55,000
Rym: And those like I work in a company where we have several like several.

770
00:51:55,261 --> 00:51:56,670
Scott: We have we have those two.

771
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:58,180
Rym: It's some of them are mutually incompatible.

772
00:51:58,963 --> 00:51:59,224
Scott: Right.

773
00:51:59,264 --> 00:52:03,560
Scott: There's like globe, this publicly available software that's been like published for the whole world.

774
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:07,415
Scott: Someone writes a library to find the square roots of numbers or something.

775
00:52:07,435 --> 00:52:07,596
Scott: Right.

776
00:52:07,616 --> 00:52:08,520
Scott: And they publish it.

777
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:13,358
Scott: So you go, OK, install square root library and you get it from the global repository.

778
00:52:13,399 --> 00:52:13,700
Scott: It's free.

779
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,622
Scott: Everyone's got it.

780
00:52:14,683 --> 00:52:16,790
Scott: Like those two corrupted NPM packages.

781
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:17,714
Scott: One right.

782
00:52:17,995 --> 00:52:19,139
Scott: And PM install colors.

783
00:52:19,299 --> 00:52:19,460
Scott: Right.

784
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:27,516
Scott: But what if someone, you know, you make a library and you want to be able to install it repeatedly.

785
00:52:27,896 --> 00:52:28,097
Scott: Right.

786
00:52:28,137 --> 00:52:29,720
Scott: To use it in other projects.

787
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,445
Scott: But you don't want to just share it with the whole frickin world.

788
00:52:33,606 --> 00:52:42,520
Scott: Then just like Rym said, you host your own little package repository that you can publish packages to and install from.

789
00:52:42,901 --> 00:52:48,676
Scott: But I guess if you want to publish globally, then you do what the person in the news bit did.

790
00:52:48,696 --> 00:52:50,400
Scott: You publish globally, share with the world.

791
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,900
Scott: And then if people start using it and you go ahead and corrupt it, well, they're in trouble.

792
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,411
Rym: But I guess it's similar to what we talked about in the first half of the show.

793
00:52:59,214 --> 00:53:01,020
Rym: This all these different things.

794
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,820
Rym: Installing software on your Windows computer, installing an app on your phone, installing libraries to write code.

795
00:53:07,383 --> 00:53:10,440
Rym: They're all fundamentally the same thing with the same challenges.

796
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:11,660
Scott: Yep.

797
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:21,160
Scott: It's basically like these little libraries that have, you know, software and you can you have your programs on your computer that know how to talk to those libraries.

798
00:53:21,761 --> 00:53:27,100
Scott: And the libraries give you instructions on how to get the software and install it onto your computer.

799
00:53:27,461 --> 00:53:28,523
Scott: And you tell the.

800
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:32,090
Scott: you tell it, hey, this tool, go get this package.

801
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:37,340
Scott: OK, I'm getting it and get everything else that that package needs in case there's dependencies.

802
00:53:37,821 --> 00:53:37,861
Scott: OK.

803
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:43,000
Scott: And if there's a bunch of different packages, you know, make sure you sort out the dependencies between them.

804
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:43,461
Scott: OK.

805
00:53:43,722 --> 00:53:45,227
Scott: And get these specific versions, too.

806
00:53:45,287 --> 00:53:49,040
Scott: I don't just you know, sometimes I want the newest one, but sometimes I want old ones.

807
00:53:50,862 --> 00:54:08,440
Rym: And even worse, if you're in a CI/CD environment, continuous integration, continuous deployment, then you have to set up pipelines to where when any library and all the different package things you use updates, you're going to have a way to confirm that that update won't break anything you've already got.

808
00:54:09,741 --> 00:54:09,841
Scott: Yep.

809
00:54:10,082 --> 00:54:12,832
Scott: I think the way I handle that problem these days is on GitHub.

810
00:54:12,853 --> 00:54:14,258
Scott: There's a thing called Dependabot.

811
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:14,840
Scott: Have you heard of this?

812
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:15,378
Rym: I have not.

813
00:54:16,121 --> 00:54:18,815
Scott: OK, so it's been there for a while, but I guess you wouldn't know about it.

814
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:19,860
Scott: It's a programmer's thing.

815
00:54:20,261 --> 00:54:23,000
Rym: So I am basically so far removed from day to day.

816
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:23,581
Scott: Let's say you're.

817
00:54:23,602 --> 00:54:24,846
Scott: let's say you're writing a program.

818
00:54:25,067 --> 00:54:25,287
Scott: Right.

819
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:28,639
Scott: And, you know, you're writing a node, a JavaScript program.

820
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:28,860
Scott: Right.

821
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:33,348
Scott: So you're going to have a file in your code repository called package dot JSON.

822
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:39,320
Scott: And in that file is going to basically be a list of all the packages that your software needs.

823
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:39,560
Scott: Right.

824
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:43,007
Scott: So please include colors version one.

825
00:54:43,428 --> 00:54:47,696
Scott: Please include the newest version of, you know, Faker.

826
00:54:47,876 --> 00:54:48,077
Scott: Right.

827
00:54:48,097 --> 00:54:48,397
Scott: Whatever.

828
00:54:48,457 --> 00:54:49,780
Scott: All these it's just a list.

829
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:04,500
Scott: Basically, it's a JSON file, but it's effectively just a list of all the packages that your program needs to install from somewhere else in order to work, because you're not including that code directly and the versions of each thing that you need.

830
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:04,981
Scott: Right.

831
00:55:05,421 --> 00:55:16,940
Scott: So if someone downloads your code, then they just type NPM install in your directory and it will look at that file and automatically go to NPM and install all the versions of all the things.

832
00:55:17,421 --> 00:55:19,487
Scott: And it works the same pretty much every other language.

833
00:55:19,768 --> 00:55:23,338
Scott: Python has the requirements dot text, same fundamental concept.

834
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,000
Scott: Right.

835
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,747
Scott: So what depend about is on GitHub.

836
00:55:27,148 --> 00:55:31,680
Scott: is you push your code repository to GitHub and you've got one of these files in there.

837
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,883
Scott: That's a list of packages with version numbers.

838
00:55:35,225 --> 00:55:44,940
Scott: Depend about goes around if you've enabled it and it looks at that for those files and it looks at the versions in those files and it looks at the, you know, the package repositories.

839
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:50,127
Scott: And if it sees that Rym is using colors one.

840
00:55:50,568 --> 00:55:50,808
Scott: Right.

841
00:55:51,629 --> 00:55:54,433
Scott: And then it notices that colors 666 came out.

842
00:55:55,595 --> 00:55:56,075
Scott: It's going to be.

843
00:55:56,156 --> 00:55:57,377
Scott: it'll send you an on.

844
00:55:57,457 --> 00:55:59,380
Scott: the bot will send you a pull request.

845
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:03,909
Scott: That's like, hey, there's a new version security update for colors.

846
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:04,310
Scott: Yeah.

847
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:08,980
Scott: You know, please merge this pull request to update to version color 666.

848
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:16,440
Rym: So you can set up a pipeline where that pull request ends up spinning like a virtual environment and a doctor or whatever to test it and run.

849
00:56:17,261 --> 00:56:17,481
Scott: Right.

850
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:21,873
Scott: If you have CI/CD, then a pull request will automatically get tested.

851
00:56:22,334 --> 00:56:24,620
Scott: And when you merge it, it'll automatically get deployed.

852
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:31,794
Scott: So all you have to do is basically let depend about run something like it that you can trust.

853
00:56:32,195 --> 00:56:32,776
Scott: Right.

854
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,940
Scott: And then keep merging those things.

855
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:46,320
Scott: And then you should be up to date on your, you know, and if your test coverage is good, if your test coverage is not good, one of those library updates might break something and you wouldn't know because your test would still pass.

856
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:46,921
Scott: Yeah.

857
00:56:46,941 --> 00:56:54,380
Rym: But if you work in a mission critical environment, you probably want manual testing or verification independent of all that CI/CD.

858
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,040
Scott: Yeah.

859
00:56:55,781 --> 00:56:56,502
Scott: But yeah, that's so.

860
00:56:56,522 --> 00:56:59,466
Scott: that's how you can keep your libraries and things up to date.

861
00:56:59,526 --> 00:57:10,900
Scott: But like, you know, the problem here is, again, we're writing software in such a way that your, you know, most of your program is actually other things.

862
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,100
Scott: You've pulled in from other people.

863
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:19,190
Rym: Because you said there was a load bearing word and everything you said a while ago, and that was trust.

864
00:57:19,611 --> 00:57:23,540
Rym: It's not just trusting these package managers and these package maintainers.

865
00:57:23,881 --> 00:57:30,335
Rym: It's also trusting your own QA processes, your own deployment processes, how you've structured your code, trusting your own tests.

866
00:57:30,695 --> 00:57:32,800
Rym: You have to trust a lot of things.

867
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:39,772
Rym: And we've gotten to the point to where the modern day hello world, like the minimum viable program does it.

868
00:57:40,434 --> 00:57:43,980
Rym: It touches so much nonsense in many ecosystems.

869
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:53,252
Scott: And you spent a lot, you know, I spent a lot of time just doing, you know, working on this new GeekNights' website, right?

870
00:57:53,732 --> 00:57:58,760
Scott: I spent the large portion of this year just doing the environment set up.

871
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,966
Scott: I made a whole system, right, just to build.

872
00:58:01,986 --> 00:58:03,349
Scott: It didn't do anything.

873
00:58:03,429 --> 00:58:05,273
Scott: All it did was launch a blank website.

874
00:58:05,293 --> 00:58:05,934
Scott: That's all it does.

875
00:58:06,415 --> 00:58:06,676
Scott: Right.

876
00:58:07,096 --> 00:58:08,860
Scott: And that was a whole project just to do that.

877
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,723
Scott: And now working on the actual website is like a breeze.

878
00:58:12,063 --> 00:58:14,466
Scott: Mostly the RSS feeds are a lot of work.

879
00:58:14,566 --> 00:58:34,871
Scott: But other than that, it's like, you know, it's like most of the work was just getting all that foundational stuff, which is really just bringing together other people's code in an automated way so that I could write our code, which is going to be not a large percentage of the overall total code that is going to run the website.

880
00:58:36,214 --> 00:58:39,660
Scott: And I think most of what we bring to the website is the data, not the code.

881
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,041
Rym: Yep.

882
00:58:40,381 --> 00:58:44,990
Rym: And this is where this is partly like to get to get a little existential and a little roomy about this.

883
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:50,600
Rym: This is sort of this increasing relaying abstractions upon abstractions upon abstractions.

884
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:51,742
Rym: And this isn't new.

885
00:58:52,122 --> 00:58:54,465
Rym: Think about that shitty video card we just talked about.

886
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:56,649
Rym: Computing is all the same fundamental.

887
00:58:56,689 --> 00:58:58,131
Rym: It's all just adders in the end.

888
00:58:58,691 --> 00:59:00,374
Rym: We figured out adders a long time ago.

889
00:59:00,414 --> 00:59:04,760
Rym: We figured out how to add some numbers together with binary logic.

890
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,864
Rym: And we've just been expanding, expanding, expanding upon that.

891
00:59:08,405 --> 00:59:12,772
Rym: And with increased abstraction comes increased specialization.

892
00:59:13,153 --> 00:59:17,500
Rym: Whereas in the old days, a computer scientist wrote code that made the computer go.

893
00:59:17,941 --> 00:59:18,543
Rym: And that was it.

894
00:59:18,924 --> 00:59:24,400
Rym: But look at how many different subspecialties exist to make anything happen in the modern technology world.

895
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:45,480
Scott: So yeah, I think it's good for everyone to understand the concept of a package manager, some repository of software that's like an app store, but a more advanced app store that can bring lots of different pieces of software together and not just individual blobs of entire programs.

896
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:52,066
Scott: But also, you know, programs that depend on other programs to work, you know, like notepad needs the text library or whatever.

897
00:59:53,488 --> 01:00:06,520
Scott: And also on top of that, right, an entire ecosystem where you have a package manager for your whole OS and then package manager for the programming language.

898
01:00:07,261 --> 01:00:10,464
Scott: And then several different instances, right?

899
01:00:10,504 --> 01:00:15,450
Scott: Where different, you know, different containers or sandboxes where different sets of packages are installed.

900
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:24,480
Scott: And then even something like, you know, Docker where it's like they have, you know, the, the, the Docker hub, which is like a repository of images.

901
01:00:25,481 --> 01:00:29,144
Scott: So it's like a meta again, right?

902
01:00:29,665 --> 01:00:44,580
Scott: But it's just, that's the way you, you know, build software these days is basically by pulling together, you know, most of the work is pulling together pieces from various repositories in a, in a cohesive fashion and then linking them together.

903
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:59,600
Rym: There are people who, there are people whose sole job in a lot of big companies is to be the release manager as a person to coordinate the pipeline of how releases get to production from this extremely abstracted and multi-dependent environment.

904
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:01,401
Scott: Yeah.

905
01:01:01,461 --> 01:01:11,911
Scott: You could even write, you know, your program itself that ties together other programs, you could push it out to the repository as yet another program.

906
01:01:12,271 --> 01:01:12,492
Scott: Right.

907
01:01:12,872 --> 01:01:17,016
Scott: And then other people could then install your, you know, install your thing.

908
01:01:17,036 --> 01:01:20,800
Scott: But I think all the stuff that you depended on would come along with it.

909
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:34,440
Rym: The biggest sort of concern I see in this space right now, backed around trust is that one malicious packages can happen, which means you have to be you've got to protect yourself if you're just a hobbyist, whatever.

910
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:39,951
Rym: But even whatever, say you get a dodgy package for like, that's not used by a lot of people.

911
01:01:40,673 --> 01:01:42,857
Rym: And thus doesn't have as many eyes keeping an eye on it.

912
01:01:43,178 --> 01:01:44,140
Rym: And it does something malicious.

913
01:01:44,521 --> 01:01:50,529
Rym: And now you're running that on your own local PC when you're doing testing and it breaks out of the sandbox and fucks with your computer.

914
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:57,840
Rym: There's like, there are a lot of dangers of naively using packages that aren't used by a lot of other people.

915
01:01:58,261 --> 01:02:06,255
Rym: But something used by a lot of other people isn't necessarily that much safety, because in NPM, those two packages are widely used.

916
01:02:06,696 --> 01:02:08,840
Rym: And granted, people caught this problem pretty quick.

917
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:19,379
Rym: But if you had something critical that depended on those packages and your unit tests were, I guess in this case, your unit tests have to be pretty dogshit to not catch what happened if you put those packages in.

918
01:02:20,661 --> 01:02:24,367
Rym: But you can get yourself into a really sticky situation in a hurry.

919
01:02:25,028 --> 01:02:32,820
Rym: And there aren't good ways to validate how reliable and how well maintained random packages are on the Internet.

920
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,335
Scott: Open source software is provided with no warranty.

921
01:02:35,415 --> 01:02:36,079
Scott: That's how it works.

922
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:36,560
Scott: But

923
01:02:36,620 --> 01:03:05,640
Rym: open source software is also under a lot of pressure from the fact that all these cross dependencies and these packages upon packages and abstractions upon abstractions means that there's an XKCD comic from years ago that I always think back to where you can find entire ecosystems where dependencies are obfuscated through all these layers and you find out that like an entire industry is depending upon literally at its root one library where the person who wrote it died 20 years ago and no one's touched it.

924
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:06,721
Scott: Yep.

925
01:03:06,921 --> 01:03:07,702
Scott: That's how it goes.

926
01:03:08,323 --> 01:03:18,640
Scott: And the biggest source, I think, for the malicious packages is usually like if there's something is a big time package that a lot of people use like Log4j.

927
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:21,681
Scott: Right.

928
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:22,803
Scott: That's not that's just.

929
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:23,786
Rym: that was malicious.

930
01:03:23,826 --> 01:03:24,748
Rym: That was just a mistake.

931
01:03:25,329 --> 01:03:25,529
Scott: Right.

932
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:27,273
Scott: That was just bugs in the thing.

933
01:03:27,614 --> 01:03:27,854
Scott: Right.

934
01:03:28,115 --> 01:03:30,600
Scott: You know, honest, you know, security.

935
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:36,492
Rym: But it does go against the idea that more eyes means no, there aren't going to be security vulnerabilities.

936
01:03:36,752 --> 01:03:40,700
Rym: That is not necessarily true because security vulnerabilities are increasingly obscure.

937
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,121
Scott: That's true.

938
01:03:43,422 --> 01:03:48,970
Scott: But the biggest source of malicious packages is going to be typos, I think, usually.

939
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:49,510
Scott: Right.

940
01:03:49,671 --> 01:03:56,780
Scott: Because it's you don't you know, whoever pushed or if you just go and search around and are willing to install something that's not popular.

941
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:57,141
Scott: Right.

942
01:03:57,181 --> 01:03:58,984
Scott: Because usually they'll let you publish anything.

943
01:03:59,625 --> 01:03:59,865
Scott: Right.

944
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:01,428
Scott: But it's like, all right.

945
01:04:01,528 --> 01:04:06,155
Scott: You know, some weirdo published something called, you know, devil's devil's lib.

946
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,860
Scott: It's like you go install devil's lib.

947
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,561
Scott: It's like, all right.

948
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:11,945
Scott: No, you're the only one who was willing to install that.

949
01:04:11,985 --> 01:04:12,386
Scott: Good luck.

950
01:04:12,847 --> 01:04:20,120
Scott: But, you know, if you maybe there's something called colors and you accidentally pip install or npm install color and you forget the S.

951
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:20,601
Rym: Yeah.

952
01:04:20,921 --> 01:04:24,048
Scott: And it's like, ah, that was actually just a virus.

953
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:27,736
Scott: someone put up there under a name that was very close to the name of a popular thing.

954
01:04:27,856 --> 01:04:29,820
Rym: Very similar to like if you fat fingered it.

955
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:36,620
Rym: If you type URLs that are very close to real URLs, you usually get to some ridiculous malware filled spam website.

956
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:45,880
Scott: And this is why, you know, Apple, you know, in the app store, it's like for all are complaining that they won't let you in there and they have all these restrictions and always checking everything.

957
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:54,216
Scott: It's like this is why they can't be having just anyone push whatever they want into the app store because it'll be full of viruses and evil stuff.

958
01:04:54,837 --> 01:04:55,098
Scott: All right.

959
01:04:55,118 --> 01:04:55,999
Scott: They got to check it out.

960
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,505
Rym: So, yeah, this is the kind of stuff.

961
01:04:59,545 --> 01:05:06,700
Rym: If you're going to be a software person of any stripe, you have to at least understand how these things work, even if you're not working with them day to day.

962
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,130
Rym: That's why we've gone on for an hour and 10 minutes.

963
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:11,095
Rym: I'm real hungry.

964
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:11,679
Rym: Stop right there.

965
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,758
Scott: Yeah, I'm already ordering food right now.

966
01:05:16,262 --> 01:05:18,527
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

967
01:05:18,567 --> 01:05:23,560
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

968
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,940
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

969
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,887
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

970
01:05:32,027 --> 01:05:36,640
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

971
01:05:36,981 --> 01:05:40,136
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

972
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,490
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

973
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,580
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

974
01:05:48,580 --> 01:06:05,360
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyce, Link Eiji, Dread Lily, Tanner Bryant, a bunch of people who don't really want me to say their names, Chris Adon, Chris Romer, Clinton, Walton, Dex, Finn, Kashiai85, Rebecca Dunwoody, Medville34, Coward, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Horrell, Taylor Braun.

975
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:14,280
Rym: The next station is North York Center, North York Center Station, and several people who do not want me to share the screen name that they use on Patreon.

976
01:06:14,941 --> 01:06:15,743
Rym: Stay safe out there.

977
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:24,200
Rym: I hope you didn't go to MagFest if you didn't have a professional reason to be there, but if you were there, get a COVID test and please isolate for a couple weeks.

978
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:26,704
Rym: That was a really dicey situation.

979
01:06:27,345 --> 01:06:35,723
Rym: Stay safe out there, and we'll see you on Wednesday with a show about something, but for now, I leave you simply with... Five more seconds.

980
01:06:35,763 --> 01:06:36,704
Rym: I'm calling the manager.

981
01:06:36,724 --> 01:06:38,027
Rym: You think I'm kidding?

982
01:06:38,047 --> 01:06:51,774
Rym: Five, four, three, two... Welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger.

983
01:06:51,794 --> 01:06:52,800
Rym: Can I take your order?

984
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,006
Rym: Well, it's about time.

985
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:56,060
Rym: Can I get two Good Burgers?

986
01:06:56,581 --> 01:06:57,245
Scott: Oh, sorry, dude.

987
01:06:57,285 --> 01:06:58,190
Rym: I have to go get them.

988
01:06:58,412 --> 01:06:59,680
Rym: Customers aren't allowed in the bag.

989
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,799
Rym: Just give me two Good Burgers.

990
01:07:02,162 --> 01:07:04,293
Rym: Dude, I just can't give you two Good Burgers.

991
01:07:04,313 --> 01:07:05,379
Rym: You have to pay for them.

992
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:06,081
Scott: Forget it!

993
01:07:06,743 --> 01:07:07,385
Scott: Forget it!

994
01:07:07,405 --> 01:07:08,810
Scott: I've had it up to here with Good Burger.

995
01:07:09,332 --> 01:07:11,699
Rym: I can't wait for Mondo Burger to open.

996
01:07:14,241 --> 01:07:14,946
Rym: Mondo Burger?

997
01:07:16,275 --> 01:07:17,040
Scott: What's Mondo Burger?

998
01:07:20,671 --> 01:07:20,812
Scott: It?

999
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:23,842
Scott: You see that giant building there across the street?

1000
01:07:24,344 --> 01:07:26,130
Scott: The one that they've been building for ten months?

1001
01:07:29,342 --> 01:07:30,115
Rym: Oh, I see it.

1002
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:33,520
Scott: That's Mondo Burger, it.

1003
01:07:34,446 --> 01:07:36,239
Scott: Yeah, they open in, like, three days.

1004
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,906
Scott: Cool!

1005
01:07:38,966 --> 01:07:40,029
Rym: It's not cool, Ed.

1006
01:07:41,373 --> 01:07:42,155
Rym: They're competition.

1007
01:07:43,218 --> 01:07:43,940
Rym: Big competition.

1008
01:07:44,921 --> 01:07:45,304
Scott: Yep.

1009
01:07:46,251 --> 01:07:47,480
Scott: They could foot us out of business.

1010
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:48,000
Scott: That's right.

1011
01:07:49,022 --> 01:07:50,286
Scott: All right, now, now, come on!

1012
01:07:51,008 --> 01:07:53,134
Scott: Good Burger has been here for over 40 years.

1013
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:54,999
Rym: People love us.

1014
01:07:57,184 --> 01:07:57,695
Rym: Most of us.

1015
01:07:58,942 --> 01:08:01,000
Rym: And nobody is putting Good Burger out of business.
