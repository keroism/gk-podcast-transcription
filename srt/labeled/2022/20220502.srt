1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,700
Rym: It's Monday, May 2nd, 2022.

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,141
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,249
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:17,068
Rym: tonight We're talking about tech debt.

5
00:00:19,072 --> 00:00:19,781
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:29,640
Rym: It's actually, you know, despite the the forecast said it would be like low 60s, but this weekend it was actually mid 60s and super sunny.

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,030
Rym: it was way nicer.

8
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:32,396
Rym: I have realized I just can't really.

9
00:00:32,517 --> 00:00:35,008
Rym: I think the forecast until like the night before.

10
00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:46,550
Scott: now I think what happened is, you know, there were similar temperatures, you know earlier But it was very very windy and it wasn't windy over the weekend and that helped quite a bit in terms of the temperature.

11
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:47,437
Rym: It did help.

12
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:53,050
Rym: but also I'm glad we went biking on Friday So we did a big bike ride and then are on Saturday skipped work, right?

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:02,970
Rym: No, we don't Saturday because then Sunday I get up and we just go to a little light bike ride to go to that Japan fest and we see a little sign and we're like, all right five borough bike tours fucking everything up today.

14
00:01:03,753 --> 00:01:06,042
Rym: I always forget that things happening me until it happens.

15
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:15,431
Rym: There was a line of cars Completely filling Queens are our Crescent Street all the way to the end of Crescent Street because drivers didn't know that the roads were all Closed.

16
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:17,119
Scott: Google Maps indicates it.

17
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:17,963
Scott: so I don't know what people are.

18
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:19,570
Rym: you know, Google Maps is perfect about that.

19
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,903
Rym: It not only does it indicate it but it tells you how to get around.

20
00:01:21,964 --> 00:01:22,970
Scott: it's all over the news.

21
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:23,593
Scott: It's all over.

22
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:29,301
Scott: it's like what are you is not paying attention to the world at all If you're in New York City at all, it's like you can't miss that.

23
00:01:29,342 --> 00:01:29,803
Scott: It's coming.

24
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,590
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's everywhere.

25
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:37,972
Rym: I mean, my only thing about it is I avoid it as a biker mostly because it's not that long and the one time I Did it?

26
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:39,477
Scott: Well, so here's the thing, right?

27
00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:42,067
Scott: So if on the one hand right?

28
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:50,730
Scott: It's like I like that it fucks over cars But the fact that all those cars idle all you know in waiting is not probably it's you know, who knows anyway?

29
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:57,690
Scott: But it's this event where it you know, it's a big biking event because it has a lot of sponsorship.

30
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:59,836
Scott: The number one sponsor is a bank.

31
00:01:59,876 --> 00:02:08,039
Scott: they got money for this thing, right and it's the only one where New York City Closes down major roads completely.

32
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,664
Rym: Yeah, you get to bike in some places.

33
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:16,986
Scott: You can normally never bike Right and on top of that some of those roads are places where are normally you could never bike.

34
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:18,490
Scott: BQE is a highway.

35
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,461
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, Verrazano bridge has no bike lane.

36
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:23,529
Scott: people are trying to get at one it right etc.

37
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:27,789
Scott: so and then there's rest stops and and such and such.

38
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:40,122
Scott: so but in order to participate in this event, you either have to do a big charity thing, which is a lot of money or You have to pay a lot of money and fight for a ticket.

39
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:44,697
Scott: or right or you have to Volunteer and then you get a free ticket the year after.

40
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:51,278
Scott: so I did it what we did it once in 2012 and it's like All right, you know, it's it's.

41
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,510
Scott: you know, there's some fun aspect to it.

42
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,875
Scott: It's not completely unenjoyable But you know, there's.

43
00:02:56,996 --> 00:02:58,766
Scott: there's a part of the man.

44
00:02:58,806 --> 00:03:04,290
Scott: parts of it For example would be if you don't start early you get stuck behind a lot of people at the start.

45
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:19,388
Scott: yeah, if you if you Don't get to the end quickly Then basically like you want like people pile up at the finish line and you have to sort of walk like the last Quite a bit because there's no room for anyone to keep right.

46
00:03:19,428 --> 00:03:26,914
Rym: over the one year I did it having to walk about a mile before Central Park because they were just so dense like all the buyers a complete dead Stop right?

47
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:34,161
Scott: Well, you think at the finish line people cross the finish line stop the person behind them stops And if the right so it's like you think they know.

48
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:34,925
Rym: you're in New York.

49
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:35,910
Rym: if you're there's an escalator.

50
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,601
Rym: You got to start walking as soon as you get off of it.

51
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:38,850
Rym: You can't just stop, right?

52
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:45,710
Scott: So it creates this logjam at the end and soon enough people are stopping before the finish line and walking over the finish line.

53
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:55,741
Scott: Right, so they need to be like have the finish line and say keep biking keep biking until you get so far then get off Your bike right like around the corner or some shit.

54
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:58,270
Scott: so people can you know go through the finish line?

55
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:58,993
Scott: But they don't do that.

56
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:09,810
Scott: And then there's another line at the Staten Island Ferry You know because it fills up and then it leaves and now you stand there waiting Right for the next one and you so on and there's no way to bike home.

57
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:15,150
Rym: You can't even bike right normally except one way during this one of you can't go back over the Verrazano.

58
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,081
Scott: So people wait for hours to get on the Staten Island Ferry to get home.

59
00:04:18,462 --> 00:04:20,649
Scott: if they weren't one of the first people to finish.

60
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,567
Scott: So, you know, it's it's not the greatest event.

61
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:29,467
Scott: It's only 55 miles which sounds like a lot to people who aren't you know cyclists, but it's really.

62
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:32,349
Scott: you know If you can pedal like you can do it.

63
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:33,237
Scott: It's like it's.

64
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,630
Scott: there's no major hills.

65
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,770
Scott: The Verrazano is the biggest hill and it's if you know how to use a gear you can do it.

66
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,895
Scott: It's like if you if you're just fine You're gonna make it.

67
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:46,828
Rym: in the early days of you biking with that bike that was way too big for you You were just fine.

68
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:55,450
Scott: Yes, an old unhealthy person as long as they have a functioning bike on a city bike will make it eventually, right?

69
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,230
Scott: It's like a child's is gonna make it eventually, you know people do this thing on folding bikes, right?

70
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:08,619
Rym: Well, apparently it's more because you know, we want to like the Japan fest - there's this In places where there's a lot of people.

71
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,150
Rym: if there's an event that's even remotely interesting.

72
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:24,870
Rym: Either it's so expensive that only a few people can go to it or it's accessible price-wise and a million million people want to go to it and it creates logistical nightmares or Impossible waiting lists, right?

73
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,830
Scott: So the event itself is not such a great thing to you know, do it once for the experience or whatever.

74
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:31,980
Scott: But it's not right.

75
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:42,464
Scott: as bike rides go It's like you can just get on your bike and ride for free on better routes in other directions right out of the city That are longer and nicer and you know better in every way.

76
00:05:42,525 --> 00:06:00,722
Scott: there's tons of them but the thing I like about the ride is that People come and do this ride who are not, you know, the big-time Cyclists, it's like it gets someone who was normally be scared of 55 miles will come out to this thing Because

77
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:03,459
Rym: it's well-supported Big event.

78
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:18,790
Scott: it's a new right thing Yeah, and though some of those people some small percentage of them right realize after doing it Exactly what I realized like 55 miles ain't that far this ride ain't that great?

79
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,010
Rym: Well, just like every the Harlem Valley Railroad rest in peace.

80
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:28,521
Rym: There's a reason they had the hundred mile ride in the 80 mile ride But they also had the 50 and the 40 and the 20 and the 12.

81
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,665
Scott: but people do.

82
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:43,139
Scott: every year people do this bike tour, which is meh and Then some percentage of them become right the the cyclists that are out filling the other roads Right because they realize like oh wait.

83
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:44,644
Scott: I get it now.

84
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:49,239
Scott: bikes are really really efficient At least on roads is not that scared.

85
00:06:49,259 --> 00:07:08,370
Rym: the thing that I'm very happy about is because when I do go to the office I always bike now unless it's like actually raining or extremely cold like below 40 and The number of bikers and I said this last year and the year before but it just keeps going up The number of people biking to work during the rush hour is getting to the point that they got to start adding more bike lanes.

86
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,390
Rym: It's starting to be a big traffic problem.

87
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:11,675
Scott: They said they were gonna take.

88
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:15,290
Scott: give us the south outer roadway what it's still held up what this was to fuck the problem?

89
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:16,755
Rym: Oh, uh, I there's.

90
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:22,268
Rym: so part of the problem is there's a bunch of other maintenance happening that went way over schedule that they need some of the space in lanes for.

91
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:24,094
Scott: Yeah, too bad.

92
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:26,221
Scott: Just fix the upper deck without you know deal with it.

93
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:26,823
Rym: They can't.

94
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:29,594
Rym: apparently there's some stupid reason for it I'm mad about.

95
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:31,970
Rym: is at the bait where the bike path is.

96
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,804
Rym: They opened up where they used at the base the Queensborough Plaza in Manhattan.

97
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:37,310
Scott: Yeah, I don't I don't go through that hole.

98
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:38,237
Scott: I go to the old hole.

99
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,930
Rym: Oh, no, but that hole is a problem.

100
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:46,670
Rym: They leaving that hole closed was fine because only people who don't know the way around actually wanted to go out the hole.

101
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,782
Rym: It's way better to go follow the bike path anyway, but now that it's open.

102
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:56,770
Rym: There's a little stop sign there and You have bikers coming down the bridge at speed.

103
00:07:57,193 --> 00:08:08,854
Rym: They turn right and try to go straight out the hole But meanwhile, there's other people coming from the normal path who are making a you left turn across their path Onto the Queensborough Bridge.

104
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:14,370
Rym: I have seen three different bike collisions happen there because it's an uncontrolled intersection.

105
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:17,309
Rym: It's bikes like they made a really bad traffic pattern.

106
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:19,763
Scott: Anyway, it's not it's not good.

107
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:22,841
Scott: So All right news tech day.

108
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:24,470
Scott: Let's talk about some actual news.

109
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:28,901
Scott: This news is not in itself is not that exciting right?

110
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,249
Scott: It's you know, the just you know, Firefox is doing it already, right?

111
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:40,010
Scott: And Apple has theirs also, but Microsoft Edge is going to also include a built-in VPN, right?

112
00:08:40,090 --> 00:09:03,769
Scott: So the way this works is that you know, you open up your Microsoft Edge browser you visit a website your traffic is encrypted and Sent to a Microsoft server somewhere and the Microsoft server will then go and make a request from the actual web server Right and then collect the response and then send you know, the encrypted, you know response back to you.

113
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:10,946
Scott: so VPNs like this have a lot of uses some good uses some bad uses.

114
00:09:11,046 --> 00:09:12,430
Scott: some may uses, right?

115
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,282
Scott: But it's getting really popular.

116
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:25,606
Scott: for now Even the big tech companies Apple Microsoft right to provide, you know Just VPN service to just to just you at all times, right?

117
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:29,195
Scott: So Why would they do this?

118
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:29,556
Scott: Right?

119
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:35,030
Scott: It's like well, you can't use these, you know, Microsoft VPNs like watch Netflix from another country.

120
00:09:37,032 --> 00:09:41,085
Rym: All I mean this one's got a one gigabyte limit even if they didn't I assume have other.

121
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:43,249
Scott: well for you have to pay for Beyond that, right?

122
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:49,301
Scott: So that's one reason is that they might be able to get more money out of you is if you like the app You know the Apple one it's like.

123
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:50,410
Scott: you don't just get that for free.

124
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,949
Scott: You I think have to be on iCloud Plus or something like that right in order to use that.

125
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:58,143
Scott: So it's a. it's a service that they can provide cheaply easily.

126
00:09:58,183 --> 00:10:00,190
Scott: They don't have to develop it because it's deploy it.

127
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:05,968
Scott: It's really easy to do if the big tech company can manage it if every other comp company in the world has managed it.

128
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:07,834
Scott: Yeah It's so.

129
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,992
Scott: it wasn't hard for them and they can make some money on it Why not do it?

130
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:16,190
Scott: and the second reason is that hey, you know, it's a selling point, right?

131
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:21,466
Scott: It's like we can tell our customers are protecting their privacy and their security, which they are in a way, right?

132
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:25,841
Scott: You're protected from Basically two major security threats.

133
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:35,230
Scott: one the other people on your network Like if you're at a coffee shop, you know or something using a public Wi-Fi at a theater or at a square garden, right?

134
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,564
Scott: They have a public Wi-Fi.

135
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:41,870
Scott: Yeah And you use one of these VPNs even a Microsoft Apple one.

136
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,630
Scott: It's like you're protected from any shenanigans that are going on and those public Wi-Fi is airport.

137
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:53,869
Rym: Well, it gets a little tricky because TLS largely protects 99% of what anyone would do over one of those connections.

138
00:10:55,591 --> 00:11:03,180
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, and so the people on the Wi-Fi still like they can figure out your MAC address For tracking purposes.

139
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:12,390
Scott: and the last thing is like, you know If you think about it all of the unencrypted traffic that you send out your network to have any unencrypted traffic?

140
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,717
Rym: I was looking every tab I got open.

141
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:18,036
Scott: Yeah, your internet service provider Com not secure.

142
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:27,830
Scott: Yeah, that's gonna be fixed soon Your internet service provider and anyone in between you and the service provider like the coffee shop or whatever right could be.

143
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:31,161
Scott: You know looking at all your data that's not encrypted.

144
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:35,437
Scott: and even if it is encrypted, you know, for example Let's say I visit google.com.

145
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:38,090
Scott: Well, yeah, someone can see that I made a Google search.

146
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,066
Scott: They don't know what I searched for right, but they know that I made a guy.

147
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:43,170
Scott: I went to Google, right?

148
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:49,630
Scott: They still know some information especially if you got some DNS going on right if they're your DNS provider, right?

149
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:56,903
Scott: Like, you know Firefox is doing like those secure Hdns over HTTP things right which I disabled because I have a pie hole.

150
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:59,190
Scott: but they also do our L's.

151
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:08,490
Rym: Themselves that contain search strings or other metadata often leak data about you to certain services along the way Depends on how things are encrypted and whatnot.

152
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:14,572
Scott: So when these companies are, you know providing you with VPN service They can.

153
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:19,650
Scott: then if you look at their terms of service, they may or may not be collecting data about you.

154
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:38,450
Scott: They may not be collecting it in a way that can be traced back to you But at bare minimum, they're probably using that data to at least you know Look at general traffic patterns and improve Services and use that data for their own research and business decision-making and whatnot.

155
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,850
Scott: So that's why all those reasons combined.

156
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:54,749
Scott: Every company in the in the universe is trying to get you to use their VPN, right and I'm surprised We're not seeing like Verizon or anyone like that Want to fight back against this more than they already are, right?

157
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:14,770
Rym: Yeah, well, it's not it's not I guess I. it's not clear to me or I guess a lot of people exactly how every different group monetizes that kind of stuff because most of the Data people want like companies like Verizon want is mostly I assume just to drive ads And ad networks and sell that data to ad networks.

158
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:21,349
Rym: But they can do that like the websites you're visiting are already doing that to you regardless of how you access them.

159
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:32,400
Rym: Yep, the VPN can at best Obfuscate who you are, but the data point of you were a person with this profile that they guessed at Sought information about XYZ.

160
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,790
Rym: that data is still what they are seeking for ads.

161
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:39,633
Scott: yeah, I mean, I really don't you know, but There has to be.

162
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:47,298
Scott: if there's some other explanation as to why every company in the universe is starting up VPNs It's like are they actually just trying to?

163
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:51,450
Scott: you know, Microsoft and Apple do have an interest in protecting user security.

164
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:57,871
Rym: They do because they do not have an interest in other companies showing you ads on their devices Right.

165
00:13:57,891 --> 00:14:05,231
Scott: I mean, it's like that is you know, definitely going to decrease like customer service calls or you know other kinds of issues Right.

166
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:08,706
Rym: So it could also be as simple as a lot of reasons that they're doing this.

167
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:12,783
Scott: the point is All these companies are doing this for reasons.

168
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:14,690
Scott: They're not just doing it because whatever.

169
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:27,150
Rym: Also, this is wave two because there was a big wave five to eight years ago of VPNs popping up especially in a lot of Nordic countries offering their services to the world.

170
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,234
Scott: Well, but those were right.

171
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:32,450
Scott: So those are third-party via ends or like go get Nord VPN or what?

172
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:38,478
Rym: you know a lot of them were either aimed at nerds or aimed at Criminals and pirates like pretty.

173
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:44,431
Scott: I mean if you go on YouTube even today, you know One of the biggest sponsors of YouTube videos, you know it's like.

174
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:54,245
Scott: I don't I skip past the ads but I can see that it was an ad for some VPN service and Specifically are like watch Netflix from other countries with our VPN service.

175
00:14:54,285 --> 00:14:57,637
Scott: Like they say that right up They're not even hiding it which I respect.

176
00:14:57,858 --> 00:14:58,721
Scott: Yeah coming out with that.

177
00:14:59,022 --> 00:15:02,674
Scott: I respect saying we sell crime By our cry.

178
00:15:02,754 --> 00:15:03,276
Scott: I love that.

179
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,480
Scott: It's like yes, dude.

180
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,964
Scott: Don't don't beat around the bush.

181
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:11,758
Scott: I respect you for coming out with it right, it's like But the Apple and the the Microsoft ones.

182
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:13,102
Scott: they don't provide that service.

183
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:21,988
Scott: those VPNs are gonna be in your country and not help you Do that and they're only gonna be in your browser and not really for all your internet traffic all-encompassing.

184
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:27,161
Scott: So But so one way it could be services means that they're up to something.

185
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:41,947
Rym: one thing could be just trying to get people into Their general ecosystem of stuff because generally once someone starts using something they tend to keep using it Unless something stops them and it's easier to get them to pay to keep access to said thing.

186
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:47,730
Rym: another thing They could be doing would be around trying to head off competitors with ad networks and everything.

187
00:15:48,932 --> 00:15:53,010
Rym: It could also be they saw that there's a bunch of companies making money selling VPNs.

188
00:15:53,731 --> 00:16:03,060
Rym: Why not just sell one and use the free tier like with this one gigabyte limit just to get an ecosystem people using it You'll upsell to like 5% of your users.

189
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:05,249
Rym: It becomes profitable and you're good to go.

190
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:13,829
Scott: But yeah, it's you know, it's a thing now the the you know relatively past few year right development of going from VPNs.

191
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,255
Scott: where First is the thing?

192
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:22,287
Scott: companies did so you could connect to their thing to work from home Right or connect networks in different places to each other, right?

193
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,177
Scott: And then they became a thing that you would buy.

194
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:32,721
Scott: that were standalone companies and now the big tech companies are all pushing VPNs on people.

195
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:33,104
Scott: Mm-hmm.

196
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:41,583
Rym: So, uh in some other news and obviously if you want news about the Russian invasion of Ukraine GeekNights is not the place to go for that.

197
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:46,535
Rym: That is we are not journalists in that regard but one minor at what.

198
00:16:46,635 --> 00:17:07,440
Rym: one aspect of this war that reg is into technology is interesting is the asymmetry between the stated and expected capabilities of the Russian military in this case the Russian Navy and The reality of modern drone technology and anti-ship missiles and basic things were basically what just happened.

199
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:10,738
Rym: You might have seen earlier not that long ago.

200
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:22,460
Rym: Ukraine was notably the first nation in world history to sink an enemy combatants flagship Despite not having a navy of their own which was interesting.

201
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:24,349
Scott: So Russia have one boat.

202
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:30,460
Rym: No, not even I mean But they don't have like a navy like a blue water, right?

203
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:32,530
Scott: How many boats does it count to you?

204
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,480
Scott: do you need for it to be a Navy like if I get to?

205
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,873
Scott: Paper little sailboats got Navy.

206
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:41,518
Scott: all that a Navy Boats, right, you know, they go they go.

207
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:48,160
Rym: Well that Navy might be easy to defeat and I thought a lot of subjective judgment over what constitutes a name.

208
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,245
Scott: I'm just I'm just.

209
00:17:49,265 --> 00:17:50,812
Scott: what I'm saying is like what you know, it's not.

210
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:54,811
Scott: you know, like you have a Navy But then you have like an armada that's even bigger than a name.

211
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:56,379
Scott: That's like two navies.

212
00:17:57,784 --> 00:17:59,680
Scott: How many boats do you need to make a Navy?

213
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:12,536
Rym: But so way back in the Falkland Islands conflict the Argentinian land forces sunk a bunch of British ships because it's Really cheap to sink ships with like missiles and things.

214
00:18:12,878 --> 00:18:13,420
Scott: but it's funny.

215
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:19,074
Scott: That's just a basic principle of the universe Is that it's easy to destroy things and it's hard to make things we can.

216
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:22,848
Scott: everyone just played with Duplo's knows that You could build a Duplo Tower.

217
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:23,570
Scott: No, it's.

218
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:26,240
Scott: it takes a while knock one down takes two seconds.

219
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:33,880
Rym: Oh, right, but with military stuff, it's not just hard to build things It's also hard to defend against things like missiles.

220
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:44,040
Rym: So if it costs X dollars to make an anti-ship missile It'll cost 10 times or a hundred times X dollars to defend against that one missile like that's just yeah.

221
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,740
Scott: I mean think about what does it take to build a boat, right?

222
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:51,919
Scott: You need a dock dry dock and a whole factory and a bunch of people who know what the fuck they're doing.

223
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:55,630
Scott: and you need Materials and expertise and time and resources and energy.

224
00:18:55,991 --> 00:18:58,740
Scott: and what does it take to get rid of a boat something that goes boom?

225
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,574
Scott: It's like yeah Hey, whatever something there no more boat all that hard work down in the ocean.

226
00:19:04,714 --> 00:19:06,640
Scott: Goodbye countermeasure nice one iceberg.

227
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:08,448
Scott: You don't even need a boom giant boat.

228
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:09,593
Scott: They spent all that time on it.

229
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:11,340
Scott: Send it out to see one iceberg.

230
00:19:11,421 --> 00:19:12,552
Scott: That's it bottom of the ocean.

231
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:13,300
Scott: Yeah, great.

232
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:28,573
Rym: but also asymmetry in Defense is harder than offense in modern militaries in that The thing the countermeasure to a thing is so much more expensive than the thing that you can never defend yourself against anything Except with extremely advanced technology.

233
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:32,450
Scott: So anyway It's like how do you defend against?

234
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,254
Scott: you know a missile?

235
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:34,340
Scott: it's going real fast.

236
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,465
Scott: How are you gonna shoot it down?

237
00:19:35,526 --> 00:19:38,460
Scott: and then when it hits it blows up real big and real hard?

238
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,668
Scott: How are you gonna have an armor to block that?

239
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:42,655
Scott: Yeah, it's like not easily.

240
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:46,780
Rym: so today Footage was released and it appears to now be confirmed.

241
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:58,409
Rym: Russia has well had 17 of these advanced patrol boats which are some of the few ships in their Navy that are post-soviet meaning they were designed and built after the fall of the Soviet Union.

242
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:09,938
Rym: there's some of the more advanced patrol boats they've got and Ukraine just sank two of them with Basically cheap as shit drones and they publish video of themselves doing it.

243
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:14,614
Rym: So Wikipedia already updated it to so show that Russia has lost three of these things.

244
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:16,340
Scott: because apparently you're not talking about.

245
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:23,400
Rym: We're not talking about DJI drones that you can buy right now Not the drone that I've got like a DSLR hanging off of right now.

246
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:33,820
Scott: We're talking about better drones than that but not as good as like the US drones that we you know Bomb people in the Middle East with right, you know, not US war crime level of drone, right?

247
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,379
Scott: You know, we're talking about like the shittiest cheapest version of that.

248
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,349
Scott: But they are still pretty capable right.

249
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:42,176
Scott: they can fly fast ish right.

250
00:20:42,216 --> 00:20:43,120
Scott: they can stay in the air.

251
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:45,247
Scott: You can remote control them reliably.

252
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:49,380
Scott: They can carry an explosive and drop it accurately, right?

253
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,007
Scott: So that already is.

254
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:56,009
Scott: you know, despite being crappy compared to what the u.s Has made that's still pretty capable.

255
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:00,720
Rym: drone wise right but when it comes to air power And I don't want this to take up the whole episode.

256
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,328
Rym: You can read the article to see all the details.

257
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:20,394
Rym: but the technology aspect of it Is that for basically ever Everyone has assumed that a nation like Russia just like the United States or France or other like major military powers Can defend themselves against the cheapest military technology, right?

258
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:23,685
Scott: Like we just talked about like a missile is going really fast It's hard to shoot down.

259
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:24,872
Scott: It explodes really big.

260
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:30,460
Rym: It's hard to armor against Like your pal axes and all sorts of interesting technology, right?

261
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,463
Scott: The u.s.

262
00:21:31,563 --> 00:21:36,840
Scott: Drones are gonna be going so fast and they're gonna have such good targeting and they probably got stealth shit.

263
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,744
Scott: Who knows what the u.s.

264
00:21:37,784 --> 00:21:38,327
Scott: Has right?

265
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:39,392
Scott: It's like you're it's gonna be.

266
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:40,960
Rym: I don't believe there are any drones.

267
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:45,899
Scott: Then I don't know we've made those off head might be secret, right?

268
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,152
Rym: I don't know a lot about drones to be honest except what I read read.

269
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:53,308
Scott: looking at after I'm just assuming Right based on what we know about the u.s.

270
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:58,247
Scott: Spending so much money on the military that if it can exist They probably have it.

271
00:21:58,388 --> 00:22:12,505
Rym: I guess what I'm getting at is it was Pretty well assumed that this kind of attack is basically futile against the modern military like if this anti-aircraft could have shot these drones down and For whatever reason.

272
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:19,828
Rym: Russia seems like Russia's Navy and military don't actually seem to be able to field basic anti-aircraft capabilities.

273
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:28,660
Scott: and if Ukraine had tried to say send these drones to France to drop bombs on Paris France could have shot them down trivially

274
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:30,187
Rym: Which is

275
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,360
Scott: not have been a problem

276
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,136
Rym: Which is making this conflict start to look more and more exactly like how Desert Storm looked in terms of.

277
00:22:36,678 --> 00:22:41,680
Rym: it was the fourth Largest military in the world and oh it turns out it was literally obsolete.

278
00:22:42,122 --> 00:22:54,120
Rym: It's like in sieve when you've got your advanced men at arms and pike and shot Military and then one small musketman boy shows up Yeah, like it's rifleman would be in that case because pike and shot technically has muskets as part of it.

279
00:22:54,140 --> 00:23:03,294
Scott: But you get my dress a point at which you know in military wise if you've ever played any You know games are not so inaccurate in this in this one sense at least.

280
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:12,080
Scott: on that if you do have a technological Advantage, you know, it doesn't matter until it's big enough to matter and then it matters a lot, right?

281
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,900
Scott: But it also there's like oh you've if it was like, you know, you know if we had nights.

282
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:20,277
Scott: It was medieval times and I had a bunch of nights and you had a bunch of nights, right?

283
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,607
Scott: It's like, okay We're pretty equal in numbers, right?

284
00:23:22,627 --> 00:23:30,559
Scott: It's like I upgrade my nights to I don't know Some other kind of you know, so anything that's not guns basically.

285
00:23:31,802 --> 00:23:34,880
Scott: And it's like, you know, I might have new nights and you have old nights.

286
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,171
Scott: But if you outnumber me, it's like it's probably not so great, right?

287
00:23:38,232 --> 00:23:43,817
Scott: But if I just got like some guns I suddenly need way way way less night.

288
00:23:43,837 --> 00:23:50,456
Rym: like that comic We read that was one marine detachment is in ancient Rome and it takes out like two legions like that thing.

289
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:51,840
Scott: Yeah that exactly right.

290
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:52,925
Scott: Yeah, that's exactly.

291
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:57,646
Scott: but legions against Knights that would be pretty close, you know, yeah Well, it's well.

292
00:23:57,747 --> 00:24:02,818
Rym: actually depending on what was going on in the time That can actually be pretty close because there were also the equivalent of.

293
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:05,791
Rym: anyway This is gonna derail but it would still.

294
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,257
Scott: the guns would not be interesting.

295
00:24:07,277 --> 00:24:07,920
Scott: It'll be one side.

296
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:18,944
Rym: I guess what I'm getting at is if two countries are equivalent military technology most of their weapons on both sides are useless against each other or Are awash in some way.

297
00:24:18,964 --> 00:24:20,528
Rym: that comes down to numbers and logistics.

298
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:31,840
Rym: if they're close but not equal then asymmetric warfare happens Like yeah, we got a bunch of aircraft carriers But you've got a bunch of way cheaper missile boats and only one of them has to get through.

299
00:24:32,622 --> 00:24:48,070
Rym: but if there's a complete disparity like the disparities great enough then suddenly There are weapons that one side has that the other side doesn't have but their weapons that that are the army in power Normally can't use against anyone.

300
00:24:48,491 --> 00:24:55,059
Rym: but because of the lack of technology the other side They can deploy them like old a-10 warthogs that like that kind of old technology.

301
00:24:55,782 --> 00:25:03,620
Rym: it's really that's we're starting to see that happen in the Russian conflict and I don't know what that means for the future.

302
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:09,619
Rym: There's a fear that if NATO got involved they would destroy so many Russian forces so quickly that that would cause other kinds of escalations.

303
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:16,208
Rym: well Anyway anyway And another little news tiny little thing because I bumped into this.

304
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:23,133
Rym: there's a reddit thread where someone posted a picture of a wall Plug that was in an apartment.

305
00:25:23,174 --> 00:25:26,388
Rym: They moved into or a house They bought and they're like does anyone know what this is?

306
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:29,719
Rym: it looks like an Ethernet port, but it's too small.

307
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:33,049
Scott: Is it just that the telephone?

308
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,200
Rym: it's just a telephone jack, okay?

309
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,739
Scott: It's just a tell ya people don't know what a landline phone is.

310
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:43,899
Rym: I mean I haven't had a landline since we left our IT, and we unplugged that landline not too long after we moved in.

311
00:25:45,061 --> 00:25:46,064
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

312
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:49,595
Scott: I guess there might if there's one in this apartment.

313
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:51,000
Scott: I don't know where it is.

314
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,103
Scott: I there were.

315
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:53,707
Rym: there were some in this room.

316
00:25:53,727 --> 00:25:57,057
Rym: I actually replaced the faceplate, and I pushed him into the wall, so they're gone.

317
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,048
Scott: I Presumed that I might have to like.

318
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:02,940
Scott: you know there are Ethernet holes that go to the Fios thing.

319
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:08,500
Scott: That's like in the closet And then there's a Fios thing in the trash room and then an even another one in the basement and so on and so forth.

320
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,658
Scott: But and then one outside right you know the whole thing.

321
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:26,915
Rym: yeah We got a Fios in the front room and that files does provide phone service, so there must be a way for me to Pay for it and then connect a phone Box does have rj45 just on it if you open that store like there's there.

322
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:32,599
Scott: Oh, yeah, no it definitely does But they're wired up to one that's close to my desk, so why would I yeah mess around with?

323
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:32,720
Scott: oh?

324
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,760
Rym: They're not wired up to anything cuz I didn't plug him into anything.

325
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:42,460
Rym: But this apartment has rj45 or rj11 and phone cable going to every room And there's a little breakout box in the front.

326
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,260
Rym: There's just nothing's connected to just like we have coax going to every room in the apartment.

327
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,687
Rym: And that's how I get the files into the room.

328
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:52,748
Scott: I want it yeah anyway, but yeah Maybe soon they'll make houses.

329
00:26:52,768 --> 00:26:53,492
Scott: They don't even have that.

330
00:26:53,673 --> 00:26:58,330
Rym: because yeah Just give you I can put put fucking Ethernet cables in houses.

331
00:26:59,072 --> 00:27:00,777
Scott: well people don't use people just use Wi-Fi.

332
00:27:00,797 --> 00:27:01,660
Scott: people don't want that either.

333
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:12,177
Scott: I know it's want that but anyway things Of the day.

334
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:36,878
Rym: so a while back you used a thing of the day and it was that very satium video where they talked about the the brain teaser the puzzle problem of what if you have a Wire that is like a tenth of a light year long or a light second long some ridiculously long wire Put a battery at one end and a switch at the other end when you click the switch How long before the light bulb lights up.

335
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:42,969
Rym: and they did that really long video and half the internet Claimed that their answer was wrong.

336
00:27:44,293 --> 00:27:45,801
Scott: All right, well the internet was wrong.

337
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,290
Rym: yep, so they actually.

338
00:27:47,954 --> 00:27:52,959
Rym: So they released news as of April 29th 2022 and it's already got a lot of views.

339
00:27:53,561 --> 00:28:09,776
Rym: a whole bunch of even serious physicists researchers electrical engineers all sorts of very serious people Claimed that verisatium was wrong in various ways Despite their repeated clarifications, so well I mean I I mean it you know you can.

340
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:16,241
Scott: I hope that at least none of them if they're very if they were truly Very serious physicists who are knowledgeable.

341
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:21,698
Scott: I hope none of them were trying to claim things about The speed of light that were incorrect.

342
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:22,180
Rym: they weren't.

343
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:33,558
Rym: they were they were not other explanation, but yeah They were basically saying they were making a lot of funny arguments And also a lot of the internet who are not experts in these domains.

344
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,530
Rym: for a bunch of different reasons.

345
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:37,116
Rym: They were saying this video was wrong.

346
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:40,610
Scott: so very things you love to think but people like to think they know things yep.

347
00:28:41,072 --> 00:29:20,113
Rym: So they put together another video where they did the experiment with extremely expensive modern simulations as well as oscilloscopes to absolutely prove it experimentally and They did a whole a much deeper explanation of exactly what's going on to the point that they simulated the entirety of Maxwell's equations for electric fields in three dimensions for Actual circuits and use that to show all of these interactions as they occur fully completely calculated and Honestly.

348
00:29:20,153 --> 00:29:25,535
Rym: the reason I'm making this my thing of the day is not because they proved all the people on the internet who were wrong That they are in fact wrong.

349
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,142
Rym: that just happens all the time.

350
00:29:27,845 --> 00:29:30,635
Rym: these visualizations Actually made it click.

351
00:29:31,057 --> 00:29:31,559
Rym: I get it.

352
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:33,264
Rym: I don't get the math don't?

353
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,093
Rym: don't think I'm pretending that I get this math Not do?

354
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:37,195
Rym: I'm not claiming that.

355
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:40,543
Rym: but the concept of the field and why?

356
00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:43,290
Rym: the answer is 1m over the speed of light.

357
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:44,744
Rym: I get it now.

358
00:29:45,771 --> 00:29:56,424
Rym: Okay, the visual is a. it's just nuts mostly to see this like almost quanta level Simulation of an electric circuit that is not software.

359
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:59,738
Rym: I think I have access to All.

360
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:03,959
Scott: right, so There's a. there's a food if you're not aware.

361
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:06,690
Scott: Well, it's sort of a food I guess called furikake.

362
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:16,670
Scott: It's a Japanese thing or basically Dried seaweed some MSG some salt maybe some dried scallions in there garlic, you know drag whatever, right?

363
00:30:16,951 --> 00:30:25,094
Scott: It's basically like a dried sort of spice mix but a little bit chunkier right that a ground-up powdery spice mix Right, you know.

364
00:30:25,235 --> 00:30:28,110
Scott: and furikake is used in many things, right?

365
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:37,067
Rym: you could take some rice and sort of mix in furikake to basically make flavored rice and when I was poor a lot of My dinners were just rice with furikake on it and some cheap miso soup.

366
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:38,535
Rym: That was the whole dinner Yeah, you.

367
00:30:38,635 --> 00:30:41,250
Scott: and then you could like make onigiri with that flavored rice.

368
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,402
Scott: Oh, yeah, and it might not even need filling.

369
00:30:43,443 --> 00:30:55,339
Scott: if your furikake is good enough You could make a dish like a ramen and you could sprinkle some furikake on, you know I'm like a like a you know, just right on top there, you know You could get sprinkle furikake pretty much almost done anything.

370
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,482
Scott: Yeah that it goes with.

371
00:30:56,503 --> 00:30:56,824
Rym: you know what.

372
00:30:56,884 --> 00:30:57,827
Rym: actually there it's really good.

373
00:30:57,927 --> 00:31:00,870
Rym: on omelettes Yeah, it's real good.

374
00:31:02,178 --> 00:31:02,690
Scott: Yeah, sure.

375
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:07,887
Scott: So yeah, if you have not experienced, you know, and there's many kinds of furikake, right?

376
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,634
Scott: You can mix it up You can get a spicy one.

377
00:31:09,654 --> 00:31:11,079
Scott: You can get a plain one.

378
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:13,047
Scott: That's like just scallion or something, right?

379
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:14,352
Scott: or seaweed scallion That's it.

380
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:14,914
Scott: Right.

381
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:28,223
Scott: There's a whole wide world of furikake, but in this cooking video Romell, I believe his name is concox something Truly incredible even something right?

382
00:31:28,384 --> 00:31:39,329
Scott: I don't even like Dorito I don't eat chips with weird flavor powders on them, but I did for me the genius idea of Dorito furikake.

383
00:31:40,053 --> 00:31:44,750
Rym: Well consider if we step back and what is the flavor powder on a Dorito?

384
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:50,450
Rym: That is basically the science of making a flavor that is addictive to humans.

385
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,878
Scott: pretty much It's like.

386
00:31:53,898 --> 00:32:00,190
Scott: but now I'm thinking like well What other snacks can I crumble up and you know with some seaweed and some MSG and some scallion?

387
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:05,774
Rym: I mean, I'll say I don't eat Doritos anymore either for a lot of reasons I can't even remember.

388
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:11,049
Scott: It's been so long since I've attempted to eat any flavor powdered chip of any kind.

389
00:32:12,794 --> 00:32:15,321
Scott: I don't even remember what a Dorito tastes like.

390
00:32:15,502 --> 00:32:16,966
Rym: Oh, I do I can just I can.

391
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,190
Rym: I can imagine it.

392
00:32:18,652 --> 00:32:21,065
Scott: I have no memory what I try to imagine.

393
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:21,910
Scott: I know what they look like.

394
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,219
Scott: I know what the packaging looks like.

395
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,730
Scott: I know what the right and it's a triangle.

396
00:32:25,031 --> 00:32:30,266
Scott: I can imagine it going into my mouth and I have no memory of what it would the flavor actually.

397
00:32:30,286 --> 00:32:32,113
Rym: so something fascinating is happening Like I'm not.

398
00:32:32,314 --> 00:32:35,210
Rym: you remember we talked way back about when we learned about a fantasia.

399
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,982
Rym: Now some people just don't visualize things in their heads and some people do.

400
00:32:38,002 --> 00:32:45,126
Rym: I right now can Perfectly in my head simulate the sensation flavor taste everything of a Dorito.

401
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:49,229
Scott: and I get right I do that and I'm and I'm simulating it.

402
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:50,835
Scott: But there's like the.

403
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:53,804
Scott: there's no flavor being simulated because it's like an unknown.

404
00:32:53,824 --> 00:32:55,850
Rym: so something fucked up just happened.

405
00:32:56,352 --> 00:32:57,518
Rym: I tasted it in my mind.

406
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,824
Rym: I'm salivating.

407
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:00,170
Rym: I started a salad.

408
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:01,734
Rym: Fucking not kidding.

409
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,697
Rym: I am salivating.

410
00:33:02,978 --> 00:33:03,460
Rym: It's like there's.

411
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,125
Rym: there's too much spit my mouth right now.

412
00:33:05,487 --> 00:33:06,410
Rym: I'm drooling over this.

413
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,195
Scott: Well, think of let's think of a food.

414
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:10,442
Scott: You've never eaten ever right food.

415
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:12,970
Scott: I've never ever whale, right?

416
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,382
Scott: It's not imagine yourself eating some whale.

417
00:33:15,402 --> 00:33:17,494
Scott: I can't.

418
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:19,302
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm feeling with.

419
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:23,101
Rym: Wow You you nuked that memory.

420
00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:24,547
Rym: I just put that memory aside.

421
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:25,110
Rym: you nuked it.

422
00:33:25,812 --> 00:33:33,814
Scott: They must at least last millennium, but if not a couple years ago at The Baroness went.

423
00:33:33,854 --> 00:33:39,770
Rym: before they moved they added a new burger for a while and that burger had cool ranch Doritos on the burger.

424
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,219
Scott: Not not a bad idea.

425
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:45,032
Rym: You know what that was acceptable Hmm.

426
00:33:45,293 --> 00:33:47,743
Scott: Well, I mean, you know Taco Bell's were making their Dorito shells.

427
00:33:47,803 --> 00:33:49,350
Rym: And so yeah, I I've never had it.

428
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,244
Rym: I'll fuck down drooling again after you said that.

429
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:55,185
Scott: and well I've had co-workers that ate it in the past when it was a new thing, right?

430
00:33:55,225 --> 00:33:55,969
Scott: They ran out and got.

431
00:33:55,989 --> 00:34:04,501
Rym: I mean I would if I were on a road trip and my choice was Taco Bell or literally any other fast food I'd go to the Taco Bell.

432
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:11,069
Scott: I The talk the fast foods that I would place above Taco Bell are White Castle, but that's just me.

433
00:34:11,371 --> 00:34:13,715
Rym: I'm not saying it's better Arby's.

434
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:14,949
Scott: but you know, not the roast beef.

435
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:20,909
Rym: I was about to say you say Arby's you mean the Arby's chicken fingers and maybe you're getting those curly fries.

436
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:22,183
Scott: Yeah, yeah the curly fry.

437
00:34:22,203 --> 00:34:25,010
Scott: Yeah Arby's is one Bojangles.

438
00:34:27,752 --> 00:34:30,100
Rym: Even eat out of Bojangles, you don't know what a Bojangles is.

439
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,384
Scott: You just know this is disgusting.

440
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,650
Rym: Anyway this guy made for a cocky out of Doritos.

441
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:44,677
Rym: Yeah, I don't know if you actually said that It's a really good video.

442
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:45,783
Rym: It is a really good video.

443
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:50,614
Rym: I watched it right before we did the show In the meta moment.

444
00:34:51,014 --> 00:34:55,235
Rym: the geek guys book club book is Nine fox gambit.

445
00:34:55,797 --> 00:34:58,085
Scott: No, it's nine fox gambit.

446
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:58,587
Scott: nine fox.

447
00:34:58,627 --> 00:34:59,530
Scott: I believe is one word.

448
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:00,594
Rym: It is one word.

449
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:02,521
Rym: I was gonna do the thing at last.

450
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:03,524
Rym: I'm not eight fox.

451
00:35:03,926 --> 00:35:06,735
Rym: Definitely not ten fox That's right.

452
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:07,259
Scott: It's one word.

453
00:35:07,803 --> 00:35:08,609
Rym: I said I didn't disagree.

454
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:14,890
Rym: Okay, I just noticed that you've the way you framed this on the website after the Genji debacle.

455
00:35:19,692 --> 00:35:22,341
Rym: And don't forget the book club book we just did the city we became.

456
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:29,769
Rym: the sequel is coming imminently to that book probably gonna read that instantly and That one's done the book club books there.

457
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:33,825
Rym: And if you didn't know we have a book club and we've done a bunch of books.

458
00:35:34,227 --> 00:35:39,464
Scott: and if you want to read one Of those books despite it being so slow to do book clubs if you look back.

459
00:35:39,524 --> 00:35:51,948
Scott: It's like we've done quite a few Considering we're not a book club, you know Exclusive podcast and you know, we just been around so long and we read books so quickly when we do read them.

460
00:35:52,088 --> 00:35:54,873
Rym: Yep that Especially pre kovat.

461
00:35:54,913 --> 00:35:57,642
Rym: but those books if you want to you know, read the book.

462
00:35:58,004 --> 00:35:59,749
Rym: There's at least one mean pre Genji.

463
00:36:00,115 --> 00:36:05,650
Rym: Yeah, Genji There's all the at least one gig nice episode where we talk about that book so you can sort of relive it through us.

464
00:36:06,012 --> 00:36:09,150
Rym: There's also almost always a pretty long forum thread.

465
00:36:09,491 --> 00:36:14,330
Rym: Some of them are on the old forum with a bunch of listeners many of whom I assume are dead or scattered to the winds.

466
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,456
Rym: But they talked about the book too.

467
00:36:16,817 --> 00:36:21,389
Rym: You can relive the book club experience outside of time if you so wish.

468
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:28,786
Scott: I Can't think of any other meta moments other than the fact that you know weather is improving in New York.

469
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:35,650
Scott: Sorry southern hemisphere It's our turn again and the New York Rangers are in the Stanley Cup playoffs.

470
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,934
Rym: Thankfully so far.

471
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:41,370
Scott: so so far so much money that you will be in attendance at Madison Square Garden.

472
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:42,875
Scott: So will we?

473
00:36:42,895 --> 00:36:46,509
Rym: yep, let us know I would gladly say all our money.

474
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:47,171
Scott: Bye Bye.

475
00:36:47,692 --> 00:36:54,790
Rym: see wearing a mask and seeing you briefly in MSG is not more dangerous than what I'm already gonna do going to MSG.

476
00:36:55,071 --> 00:36:56,722
Scott: Yeah, I mean if we win we win.

477
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:04,370
Scott: If we lose we save money, it's like okay It's a win-win situation.

478
00:37:05,512 --> 00:37:07,721
Scott: If we get swept good we barely spent any money.

479
00:37:07,761 --> 00:37:10,793
Scott: if we win a whole bunch well my money is gone But we won.

480
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:12,258
Scott: so okay yep.

481
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:14,165
Rym: and so far the games.

482
00:37:14,185 --> 00:37:31,928
Scott: we have tickets to have Respected the GeekNights schedule, so uh hopefully GeekNights disrupted significantly by this And hopefully the bright though eventually as they have done so long ago 2016 15 and backwards 17 I guess me.

483
00:37:31,968 --> 00:37:36,565
Scott: I remember They showed some away games of later rounds in Bryant Park.

484
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:37,790
Scott: who knows if that'll happen again?

485
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,900
Scott: Everyone wants it to happen again on one hand.

486
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:41,710
Rym: I want it to happen again on the other hand.

487
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,491
Scott: Oh, we want it to happen real bad, but every time it's happened I've.

488
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:48,089
Rym: we have never seen the Rangers win a game where that screen was up.

489
00:37:48,952 --> 00:37:56,907
Scott: There are other watch parties that we can probably attend in some fashion if we get to later rounds for away games Yeah, maybe we should even throw one in the gig night.

490
00:37:56,927 --> 00:38:05,922
Rym: Siskoord We could restream the the way that all New Yorkers watch hockey Restream an already illegal restream on discord.

491
00:38:05,942 --> 00:38:07,208
Scott: see if your discord gets shut down.

492
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:11,477
Rym: hell, yeah All right.

493
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:13,350
Rym: so tech debt now.

494
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:22,210
Rym: This is a big topic and all I got to say is I can't Give a lot of specifics about some of the things I want to talk about especially from recent jobs.

495
00:38:22,572 --> 00:38:27,854
Rym: But what I will say is that for those of you who don't know pay a lot of attention to Me in my career.

496
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:32,710
Rym: I basically made my very well-paid law like good career.

497
00:38:33,432 --> 00:38:43,197
Rym: I built my entire career mostly on top of the fact that I am willing to embrace technology debt and legacy systems Understand them and help people get off of them.

498
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:51,409
Rym: That's that there is so much money to be made in knowing about old stuff Probably more money than there is to be made knowing about new stuff.

499
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:57,063
Scott: Right, so base the phrase tech debt has been I guess they.

500
00:38:57,644 --> 00:38:58,426
Scott: the internet says.

501
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:05,630
Scott: it was coined by one of these people Who a you know was one of the agile manifesto writers or whatever, right?

502
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:15,869
Scott: That may or may not be true, but I've definitely heard the term at least as early as around 2003 Yeah, but it's a. regardless of who invented the term.

503
00:39:16,351 --> 00:39:30,300
Scott: The concept is very old in terms of all sorts of engineering and you know Technological developments, but it's especially true for software engineering For reasons that I'm going to explain.

504
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:36,079
Rym: so I would argue that its pace is accelerating due to the way people make software today.

505
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:43,773
Scott: to write the the pace of the tech debt itself is accelerating and also the use of the term is Accelerating.

506
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:47,050
Scott: it's like become a more and more popular topic over time.

507
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:54,028
Scott: So what the idea is is that you know, you have engineered and built some sort of system, right?

508
00:39:54,108 --> 00:39:56,254
Scott: It could be Literally anything it's.

509
00:39:56,354 --> 00:40:01,270
Scott: obviously we're gonna mostly talk about software, but it could be like I don't know a car right, you know?

510
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,135
Scott: Or a bicycle right?

511
00:40:03,155 --> 00:40:03,556
Rym: You know what?

512
00:40:03,656 --> 00:40:05,060
Rym: I got a guy got a good example.

513
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:21,730
Rym: We could use the entertainment system in airlines Like you make a system like JetBlue did back in the day has little TVs and every seat and it has a way for Someone to watch some show or some movie or something on that little screen.

514
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,570
Rym: You got some software a little database something that makes that go.

515
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,925
Rym: Let's even skip the hardware and just talk about the software.

516
00:40:27,529 --> 00:40:27,690
Scott: sure?

517
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:32,490
Scott: Well, you make a thing and at the time you make it right you start with nothing, right?

518
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,895
Scott: It's like we're gonna make a new thing.

519
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,825
Scott: airlines have never had little TVs on them before right?

520
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:38,430
Scott: We're gonna make this right?

521
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:40,648
Scott: We came up with this idea and we build it.

522
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:53,210
Scott: So you build it with the technology you have available the knowledge you have available the resources you have available Right and you do presumably the best you can given the circumstances, right?

523
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:59,770
Scott: Now you're gonna have things a you wish you could have done better, but you didn't have the resources or time.

524
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:07,689
Scott: You're gonna have things that you write wish you could have done better But you didn't know better because this is your first time doing it.

525
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:12,362
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna have things you you know could have done better, but they weren't.

526
00:41:12,402 --> 00:41:16,188
Scott: those better ways weren't invented yet at the time right?

527
00:41:17,272 --> 00:41:18,115
Scott: You know that you made it.

528
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:33,095
Scott: and then lastly right as there are gonna be Requirements that you know there didn't exist when you started or they did exist But you couldn't fulfill them right with your initial Deployment right.

529
00:41:33,356 --> 00:41:42,350
Scott: so like maybe the initial thing was oh only you only need to show Movies that are on DVDs in this like centralized movie.

530
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:48,892
Scott: You know DVD carousel at the front of the plane, and that's all anyone can watch right yeah, and then later on It's like oh well.

531
00:41:48,912 --> 00:41:49,754
Scott: We need satellite.

532
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:51,096
Scott: You know live TV now.

533
00:41:51,137 --> 00:41:52,379
Scott: You know stuff like that right.

534
00:41:52,399 --> 00:42:11,968
Scott: so You know all of those things mean that after you build and deploy or even while you're building Right like you're building something and while you're making it you found a better way to do it, and it's like well now You have this difficult situation Right it's like well You know do I just?

535
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:18,607
Scott: Slightly modify what I've already made to incorporate the new thing.

536
00:42:18,847 --> 00:42:25,650
Scott: yep, right I could just you know I can make a change and add the new functionality or fix the problem.

537
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,218
Scott: Just get meet the requirement you know by just.

538
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:44,809
Rym: you know The DVD carousel with a little server that has a bunch of encoded video files on it But it plays the videos out through the interface that the old carousel did because that was easier to implement.

539
00:42:45,695 --> 00:42:49,837
Scott: Yep, exactly so it's like well There's better functionality we could be having there.

540
00:42:49,977 --> 00:42:55,079
Scott: everyone on the plane could be watching a different movie instead of you know only being able To choose from eight.

541
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:59,830
Scott: you know we could have a thousand movies But because we couldn't replace that interface without tearing apart the whole plane.

542
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:01,932
Scott: You know it's like yeah We were.

543
00:43:02,073 --> 00:43:05,010
Scott: we only able to make it that much better with the duct tape solution.

544
00:43:05,212 --> 00:43:12,084
Rym: Yeah, or like one seed is broken Then you have to reboot that server and everyone loses their movie and has to start over.

545
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:13,849
Rym: stuff like that starts to happen.

546
00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:19,028
Scott: Yep, and it's like you know working on the system right.

547
00:43:19,108 --> 00:43:28,623
Scott: it's like well You originally designed or you know something hopefully right that was somewhat elegant and cohesive Right, but then it's like oh the original design.

548
00:43:28,643 --> 00:43:35,912
Scott: Just doesn't accommodate these new things We want to do right going forward in the next version right the next update You know.

549
00:43:35,973 --> 00:43:47,510
Scott: and it's like now working on this system right you know initially building It was kind of fun working on it to get it to version 2 version 3 version 4 is not so fun anymore.

550
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,538
Scott: It's a pain in the ass something.

551
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:50,943
Scott: You know adding a feature.

552
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:59,770
Scott: That should be easy to add is Very very hard, and you because the current system is so you know old and janky.

553
00:44:00,031 --> 00:44:02,205
Rym: I can give a real-world example from a company.

554
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:02,970
Rym: I don't work at anymore.

555
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:03,713
Rym: It's a long time ago.

556
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:16,650
Rym: We had a system that would monitor a certain kind of transaction in high volume and Like over a middleware bus and it would show The status of all the things that were happening over that bus in semi real time.

557
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:22,148
Rym: So you play all the messages through it and it would show you what the end result was of all those messages.

558
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:28,350
Rym: cool That worked fine, but all that logic was done at runtime in the client.

559
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,599
Rym: So you play the messages to the client.

560
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,049
Rym: it calculates the state pretty easy.

561
00:44:34,432 --> 00:44:35,884
Rym: That has a lot of problems.

562
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:44,625
Rym: if you want to say Save that data for later if you want to say Have a thousand users all looking at that same data you want a thousand clients.

563
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:46,350
Rym: do these extremely intense calculations?

564
00:44:46,492 --> 00:44:48,030
Rym: Or do you want one central server?

565
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,254
Rym: Pre-calculating.

566
00:44:49,878 --> 00:44:51,125
Rym: so let's so all right now.

567
00:44:51,165 --> 00:44:56,588
Rym: We want to add a feature We want to alert on if a one of these transactions gets into a bad state.

568
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:10,979
Rym: now We're fucked because the alert record be either has to be in the clients or we have to take that client logic pull it into the server and run it there to even be able to detect the situation to raise the alert or Refactor the whole thing.

569
00:45:11,019 --> 00:45:12,489
Rym: so it was server-side from the beginning.

570
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,921
Rym: Yep, I lived through that and I chose the latter.

571
00:45:17,121 --> 00:45:18,345
Rym: I said fuck tech debt.

572
00:45:18,365 --> 00:45:19,789
Rym: we're paying this off right now.

573
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:22,136
Scott: Yeah, so that's the issue right?

574
00:45:22,196 --> 00:45:26,868
Scott: is that you know when you're working in an employment environment, right?

575
00:45:26,928 --> 00:45:29,736
Scott: It's like okay This is what we have an actual goal.

576
00:45:29,777 --> 00:45:30,860
Scott: We want to accomplish right.

577
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,404
Scott: technology is just the means.

578
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:32,866
Scott: right.

579
00:45:32,906 --> 00:45:36,044
Rym: the goal is I have a product I want to make or there's a problem.

580
00:45:36,084 --> 00:45:36,769
Rym: I want to solve.

581
00:45:37,553 --> 00:45:39,984
Scott: Right it's like I want to deliver this feature or this product.

582
00:45:40,285 --> 00:45:41,350
Scott: I want to deliver it soon.

583
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:52,196
Scott: I want it to work well right and it's like well You know if you you know don't redesign you stop to redesign your whole system So that it's always elegant and perfect.

584
00:45:52,236 --> 00:45:55,728
Scott: it incorporates everything nicely and cohesively in the best way you can.

585
00:45:55,748 --> 00:46:02,088
Scott: then Delivering anything will take a long time and cost a lot of money because you got to start from scratch.

586
00:46:02,108 --> 00:46:03,873
Scott: right you look at car Manufacturers.

587
00:46:04,254 --> 00:46:04,435
Scott: right.

588
00:46:04,715 --> 00:46:06,922
Scott: you look at in a pick some car the 2004 2005 2020. you know right?

589
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,459
Scott: It's like they're really similar.

590
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,750
Scott: They don't change the car that much year to year.

591
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:19,547
Scott: They change a little bit because they'd have to redo the whole factory right redo everything.

592
00:46:19,607 --> 00:46:20,530
Scott: They can't do that right.

593
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:24,990
Scott: They could do that once every so often right like the all-new such-and-such car.

594
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:28,022
Scott: We redesigned the whole thing every five ten years whatever.

595
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:32,095
Scott: I don't know how long cycles are But most years it's.

596
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:33,660
Scott: they just upgrade it a little bit.

597
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:41,750
Rym: you know and don't don't think that the moral of this whole episode is Build everything right the first time and don't cause that's impossible.

598
00:46:41,971 --> 00:46:42,814
Rym: It's a possible.

599
00:46:42,894 --> 00:46:56,610
Rym: there are very few places where that is the right answer and I would argue those places are the same kinds of Places where if we had functioning governments we would require certified Engineering practices like we do for things like civil infrastructure.

600
00:46:57,012 --> 00:47:00,529
Rym: You can't just build a bridge fast and loose and say you're good and deal with it later.

601
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:03,670
Scott: Yes, the bridge has to last a long as time.

602
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:13,616
Rym: Some things need to be over-engineered like the systems on ships that make them go or the things on airplanes that keep them in the air or Medical devices.

603
00:47:13,938 --> 00:47:16,028
Rym: pacemakers can't have software bugs in them.

604
00:47:16,972 --> 00:47:18,135
Scott: Yeah, exactly so.

605
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:29,270
Rym: but if you're making like something that just plays video over a little screen Are you gonna spend a hundred thousand dollars of developer time making it over engineered solution?

606
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:36,190
Rym: You're gonna spend $10,000 making something that works 99% of the time and it's a pain in the ass to upgrade and that's tomorrow's problem.

607
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:41,810
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you go to a company right like, you know my company or any other company and you're working on software.

608
00:47:42,352 --> 00:47:47,650
Scott: You're gonna come in if they have any existing software, even if they just made it five minutes ago, right?

609
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,984
Scott: They probably already learned a way to make it better, right?

610
00:47:51,646 --> 00:47:58,150
Scott: And it's like alright Are you going to rewrite it and try to make everything perfect and let the perfect become the enemy of the done?

611
00:47:58,738 --> 00:48:04,791
Scott: And if you do that You're gonna spend a lot of time and a lot of money and at the end of the day you will have nothing to show For it.

612
00:48:04,851 --> 00:48:05,354
Scott: No, right.

613
00:48:05,414 --> 00:48:06,016
Scott: It's like it's.

614
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:15,273
Rym: you know, even if you're gonna have someone like me yelling at you now You can have a product manager saying yo, we have to deliver this like it's been right years, you know It's like oh we have.

615
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:16,679
Scott: you know, we want to add this feature.

616
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,277
Scott: Oh, well, that feature is very annoying to add Considering our current architecture.

617
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:25,170
Scott: I will have to re-architect to add that feature in an elegant fashion.

618
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,977
Scott: That is you know performant and nice.

619
00:48:27,479 --> 00:48:32,450
Scott: that's going you know, and you if you spend so long doing it It's like well you just wasted all that.

620
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:41,242
Scott: It's like even if you keep your job that long you spent all that time doing it some some other company Probably did it faster and you just write like there was no point.

621
00:48:41,262 --> 00:48:42,950
Scott: No one's gonna use the thing, right?

622
00:48:43,151 --> 00:48:44,643
Scott: So you went with a duct tape solution.

623
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:50,550
Scott: you got it out You made the money you made the deal right and it's like but now you made it worse for the next thing you have to.

624
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,478
Rym: Yeah, that's that.

625
00:48:52,558 --> 00:48:56,714
Rym: so and that's the important thing to internalize the debt We're taught that we talked about.

626
00:48:56,774 --> 00:49:09,479
Rym: everyone talks about in this space is debt that your engineers have to pay at some point or not But that Choosing not to pay off technical debt comes down to.

627
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,624
Rym: is this thing end of life?

628
00:49:11,965 --> 00:49:13,389
Rym: Will it ever be end of life?

629
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:14,971
Rym: Mm-hmm.

630
00:49:14,991 --> 00:49:32,739
Scott: Well, so one strategy for for conquering this debt is you know Realizing that whatever thing you're making is so important that you needs to be right the first time and you spend lots and lots of Resources times and monies to make it right, you know, very right you design it very well.

631
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:45,160
Scott: Another way is to just have so many people working for you Google or Facebook or some shit like that Right that you can have some people making new things and people fixing things all at the same time.

632
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:45,764
Scott: You haven't?

633
00:49:45,804 --> 00:49:47,333
Scott: you can get everything done, right?

634
00:49:47,353 --> 00:49:48,118
Scott: You can just do it all.

635
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:57,208
Rym: There is a third even worse way of you have a ton of people and you can just throw More engineer.

636
00:49:57,288 --> 00:49:58,596
Rym: every time you want to update the system.

637
00:49:58,616 --> 00:50:04,280
Rym: with a lot of tech debt You just throw more engineers at it than the last time you updated that system and you scale that forever.

638
00:50:04,843 --> 00:50:06,212
Rym: I've seen that happen at.

639
00:50:06,252 --> 00:50:07,299
Scott: people can do that.

640
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:19,560
Scott: the one thing that can also happen is Engineers are human beings right and even though they need to work to live in a capitalist society Nobody wants to maintain your old cobalt bullshit, right?

641
00:50:19,801 --> 00:50:29,340
Scott: It's not fun to work especially on software But other any sort of other project that is so poorly designed and annoying.

642
00:50:29,461 --> 00:50:32,515
Scott: It's like you want things to be easy breezy, right?

643
00:50:32,576 --> 00:50:35,855
Scott: It's like, you know I can if I the new GeekNights website.

644
00:50:35,895 --> 00:50:36,740
Scott: good example, right?

645
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,784
Scott: It's like I can add.

646
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:44,273
Scott: you know, the way the new GeekNights website coming soon is done It's really easy for me to add new features to.

647
00:50:44,313 --> 00:50:45,620
Scott: it takes like two seconds, right?

648
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:50,856
Scott: If I actually spend time on it the old GeekNights websites are paying in the ass to work with.

649
00:50:51,077 --> 00:50:53,538
Scott: it's old and busted Right, it's not fun.

650
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:11,060
Scott: So it's like if it's your job to work at a company that insists on you know Having this old system keeping it operational not replacing it right because that's a weight That's just a bunch of time and money that doesn't actually result in any immediate business benefits.

651
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:21,630
Scott: Then it's not a fun place to work because it's like you're spending days and days and days doing something that should take Minutes, right if the system wasn't garbage.

652
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:40,918
Rym: I've been a product manager at three different companies and Not to give specific examples But I have many times in my career across all of these companies had teams where people quit at a high rate Just because there's a lot of tech debt in that space and it's not fun and no amount of money is gonna get someone Wanting to do that work.

653
00:51:41,582 --> 00:51:46,846
Scott: I think it's one of the reasons that you know tech people seem to love going to Startups and whatnot?

654
00:51:46,927 --> 00:51:49,420
Scott: because when you go to a startup, they don't have anything there.

655
00:51:49,501 --> 00:51:53,250
Scott: You're starting from nut You're always starting from nothing and you never have to deal with this problem.

656
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:59,765
Rym: every engineer thinks I finally get to build something the way I wanted from well getting Well, but they do.

657
00:52:00,146 --> 00:52:08,300
Scott: there is one thing and if you keep doing that over and over and it as long as you deliver something If you just start things and never finish anything then you're not anywhere.

658
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:18,990
Scott: but if you go somewhere and build something from scratch and deliver it and then skip the maintenance you just go somewhere else and Start from scratch and deliver again.

659
00:52:19,191 --> 00:52:21,200
Scott: and start from scratch and deliver in a cycle.

660
00:52:21,781 --> 00:52:35,172
Scott: you will carry forth the lessons you learned on the previous ones and each one you do will be better and better and last longer and longer and Right won't have the problems you had in our designs.

661
00:52:35,476 --> 00:52:42,898
Rym: or You build a reputation of delivering things that do actually have a lot of technical debt hanging around But you never have to pay it.

662
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:48,560
Rym: It's like an 18xx game where I get a bunch of debt and then I dump my company on Scott when he's not paying attention.

663
00:52:49,427 --> 00:52:52,686
Scott: Yep Like a bunch of money.

664
00:52:52,786 --> 00:52:55,919
Scott: and then here you go you have to buy a 5 train for this company to help.

665
00:52:56,744 --> 00:52:57,490
Scott: Not my problem.

666
00:52:57,551 --> 00:52:58,256
Scott: I sold that shit.

667
00:52:58,518 --> 00:53:03,765
Rym: Yep Now I'm of the mind because tech debt is actually a big part of my Professional career.

668
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:07,800
Rym: like that like managing that is something that is has been a big part of my job.

669
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:25,895
Scott: how much time should we spend right because at the weather is a point at which the tech debt becomes so big that Even though you won't have an immediate thing to deliver by fixing it if you do right do it over Then you'll afterwards you'll be able to do so much so quickly, right?

670
00:53:25,915 --> 00:53:31,688
Scott: It'd be like, you know, it's like putting you know Jet propellant right on your business there, right.

671
00:53:32,169 --> 00:53:35,398
Scott: and also What was I gonna say?

672
00:53:36,861 --> 00:53:38,565
Scott: Anyway, well, well, I.

673
00:53:38,585 --> 00:53:46,088
Rym: so what I can say is I think a lot about this and I do have very very well-defined professional opinions around this.

674
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,157
Rym: I'm curious if scoundrels agree with any of these.

675
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:54,958
Rym: cuz The biggest thing the most important thing I see in the concept of technical debt is that there is either one?

676
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:06,754
Rym: Person or at least one domain in a very very big company or two or in certain situations two domains of people Who should be the ones who decide how much tech debt to take on.

677
00:54:06,855 --> 00:54:19,787
Rym: and it is not the engineers the people who decide that are either the product managers or The operational teams that are not engineers that do customer support and maintain the system around the edges.

678
00:54:20,571 --> 00:54:32,458
Rym: in my mind the engineers Should be able to outline the rough effort to do something the over-engineered way the like kind of normal ish middle-of-the-roadway.

679
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:35,860
Rym: and What is the duct tape in his fucking way?

680
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:42,617
Rym: You could get this done, but the business should decide which of those is the correct option for any given products.

681
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,586
Scott: I Think that you know, I did remember.

682
00:54:45,606 --> 00:54:53,227
Scott: what I was gonna say is that the other situation is when your business Literally cannot Continue right.

683
00:54:53,489 --> 00:54:54,794
Scott: you hit the wall, right?

684
00:54:54,874 --> 00:55:00,069
Rym: So it's like, you know Check that take up the entire team, right?

685
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:03,157
Scott: Well, it's like you cannot deliver the thing you want.

686
00:55:03,337 --> 00:55:04,360
Scott: It's not real.

687
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:10,460
Scott: It's not possible or the resources to it to duct tape another thing on are just too great.

688
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,967
Scott: It's like you can't go any further.

689
00:55:12,007 --> 00:55:20,200
Scott: That's why like I said the car companies do eventually Redesign the whole car because it's like, you know, the technology changes so much at some point.

690
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,632
Scott: It's like we can't just tweak last year's model a little bit.

691
00:55:23,872 --> 00:55:30,313
Scott: The other cars are so far ahead of us Yeah, and we can't catch up to them with our existing platform, right?

692
00:55:30,353 --> 00:55:32,380
Scott: It's like you look at say chip fabs.

693
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,465
Scott: They're like listen, we can't.

694
00:55:33,545 --> 00:55:36,900
Scott: we can only design so many better chips on the on this process.

695
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:42,420
Scott: We need a new factory with less mill, you know less man animator process to go forward, right?

696
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,148
Scott: We're not getting anywhere with this right?

697
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:46,337
Scott: It's like we've hit the design limit.

698
00:55:46,378 --> 00:55:46,639
Scott: That's it.

699
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:57,600
Rym: I've been at places where we had teams that own things that hit KTL o meaning they do nothing but keep our system working.

700
00:55:58,641 --> 00:56:03,214
Rym: There is no capacity to add anything to that system or change anything about that system.

701
00:56:03,454 --> 00:56:05,520
Rym: They are constantly fixing that system.

702
00:56:05,921 --> 00:56:06,423
Rym: That's like.

703
00:56:06,724 --> 00:56:20,519
Rym: that's when that's about the point when if you didn't already declare bankruptcy on that thing You absolutely have to Right, usually the best strategy is to you know, if you've got something like that, that's really man, right?

704
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:27,297
Scott: You should see that it's man, right and not wait till that KTL o point whatever you call.

705
00:56:27,338 --> 00:56:28,803
Rym: don't pretend It's fine.

706
00:56:28,864 --> 00:56:38,400
Rym: like as a product manager the product people who work with engineering Engineering has to be very transparent about where it's like what the problems are and the product people have to actually listen to them.

707
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:46,340
Rym: Like if you and I were working on a project and you said look we are having trouble adding more features This is starting to become a problem.

708
00:56:46,721 --> 00:56:51,140
Rym: Then we there has to be a business conversation of how much will that affect us in the long term?

709
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,170
Rym: Will that tech debt get too big before we phase this thing out?

710
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,580
Rym: Like there's no one solution to this.

711
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:59,640
Rym: It's a dialogue between engineers and product managers.

712
00:57:00,022 --> 00:57:00,745
Rym: There's no one.

713
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:08,880
Scott: if you if you want to have a business that lasts a long time What you have to do is right, you know, you have to recognize on day one that this is gonna happen.

714
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:19,645
Scott: Right is that you're gonna make a thing and that thing is only gonna be able to carry on so far without some sort of redo refactor Remodel of some kind.

715
00:57:19,725 --> 00:57:23,560
Scott: right, you know, you can only fix your kitchen so much eventually need all new cabinets.

716
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:27,500
Scott: Yeah, and you got a time it you have to say all right this, you know, we're working.

717
00:57:28,022 --> 00:57:29,989
Scott: Okay, we made it we made it we delivered it.

718
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:32,258
Scott: It's working, you know and we can.

719
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:36,871
Scott: you know We can keep adding to this for this amount of time right?

720
00:57:37,293 --> 00:57:39,860
Scott: How long if we start from scratch again?

721
00:57:40,421 --> 00:57:47,320
Scott: How long will it take us to make another better one from scratch or at least redo a you know a better version, right?

722
00:57:47,960 --> 00:58:08,105
Scott: And you need to get one team of people carrying on with the first one as if it's still your business and delivering features and fixes for the customers and simultaneously Work on the next one such that once the first one hits the end like alright We can't carry that one any further.

723
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:13,140
Scott: The new one is ready and you can sell it as like a new better deal, right?

724
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,346
Scott: It's like Windows 3.1.

725
00:58:15,346 --> 00:58:17,412
Scott: We can't get any further right.

726
00:58:17,492 --> 00:58:20,500
Scott: and then Windows 95 is here a surprise, right?

727
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:30,017
Scott: It's like here it is right if you wait for Windows 3.1 to be dead and then start working on Windows 95 Everyone's gonna be using Macs by the time you're ready with Windows 95, right?

728
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:31,001
Scott: It's not.

729
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:35,376
Scott: they started working on Windows 95, you know way before Windows 3.1 was dead, right?

730
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,022
Scott: They had they.

731
00:58:37,122 --> 00:58:38,286
Scott: you know, they stagger it.

732
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:54,851
Rym: Yeah now I found the the I'd say the biggest causes of bad technical debt are either business people saying yes to things that Engineering has warned are more expensive than they realize.

733
00:58:55,192 --> 00:58:56,737
Rym: like that is a common problem.

734
00:58:57,078 --> 00:59:03,338
Rym: business people Agreeing to small features in a vacuum who don't understand the actual underlying systems.

735
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:07,069
Rym: that well I find a lot of success by saying no to people.

736
00:59:07,491 --> 00:59:11,451
Rym: very few people in those spaces tend to say no especially when there's money on the line.

737
00:59:11,773 --> 00:59:21,451
Rym: a lot of companies will Say yes to a new deal with a customer that requires a new feature that now requires The accumulation of a bunch of tech debt and no one's ever willing to pay it off.

738
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:23,980
Rym: that might actually be the single biggest cause.

739
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:30,789
Rym: and the other cause that I see most commonly is the engineers who built the first system.

740
00:59:31,351 --> 00:59:39,119
Rym: built it from one set of requirements, but Nobody in the business ever actually told them what the long-term plan was for that thing.

741
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:43,160
Rym: Like hey build a system to make video play in a plane.

742
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,733
Rym: Maybe the product manager should have stepped back and told them.

743
00:59:47,035 --> 00:59:51,603
Rym: Yeah, so five years from now We're gonna be selling this on buses cruise ships Etc.

744
00:59:51,623 --> 00:59:52,891
Rym: Like whatever the plan is.

745
00:59:53,031 --> 00:59:54,480
Rym: What are you gonna do with it in the future?

746
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:02,550
Rym: Because an engineer they might architect something very differently if they know Like what the future is.

747
01:00:02,912 --> 01:00:15,480
Rym: if I write when I used to write code I wouldn't make a separate class for something unless I thought that I had some reason to and if I was making something quick and Simple not a lot of classes a lot of a lot of kind of messy code because it wouldn't matter that much.

748
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:27,940
Scott: Hmm Yeah, this you know, this is basically, you know It's a never-ending topic because literally anyone who works anywhere engineering anything right is working with a system.

749
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:42,219
Scott: That is some inherent flaw and they're trying to make it, you know do things that weren't considerations Or weren't properly accounted for when you know the foundation of that system was set up.

750
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:50,221
Scott: Yeah And you know, even if they made the system ten minutes ago, they already found something that's like damn it I got.

751
01:00:50,322 --> 01:00:51,066
Scott: it's like that's.

752
01:00:51,126 --> 01:00:52,734
Scott: why did the nice website take?

753
01:00:52,754 --> 01:00:53,860
Scott: so, you know, it's taking so long.

754
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:54,903
Scott: It's like he find it.

755
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:57,290
Scott: I've already had to like while working on it.

756
01:00:57,370 --> 01:01:01,625
Scott: I was like shit like this RSS feed things Supporting.

757
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:12,954
Rym: I have changed this whole thing right now it's easy because in GeekNights like Scott is basically both a product manager and the head engineer because There's no there's no business person telling me and Scott what to do.

758
01:01:12,974 --> 01:01:18,040
Scott: Like no But it's like, you know you as I learn as I go along, right?

759
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:18,543
Scott: It's like I'm.

760
01:01:18,664 --> 01:01:21,219
Scott: you know, I'm redoing it because I you know, I don't want to be.

761
01:01:22,421 --> 01:01:23,966
Scott: I'm doing the redo part right now.

762
01:01:24,066 --> 01:01:28,340
Scott: I couldn't do it alongside the old one because I'm only one person.

763
01:01:29,742 --> 01:01:33,354
Rym: Now I'm not talked about enough aspect of this because there's like.

764
01:01:33,395 --> 01:01:34,920
Rym: we can't give really specific advice.

765
01:01:35,121 --> 01:01:39,900
Rym: This is a. every project is a totally different calculation in terms of technical debt.

766
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:46,583
Scott: But the thing that the fundamental calculation is still sort of the same right the big the zoomed-out calculation Well, you know what it is.

767
01:01:46,944 --> 01:01:51,259
Rym: do things eyes open and tell all the people building something what your plans are for it.

768
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,500
Scott: Well, it's like, you know, I this I want to achieve this actual real-world goal, right?

769
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,015
Scott: The engineering project is a means to an end, right?

770
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:02,560
Scott: Even if it's a bridge I want people to get across this river more easily, right?

771
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,464
Scott: How can we do that?

772
01:02:03,504 --> 01:02:06,900
Rym: Tell the people making the bridge what that what the bridge is gonna be used for in the end.

773
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,385
Rym: Don't just tell them to make a bridge.

774
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:10,894
Scott: Well, it's like we have this much money, right?

775
01:02:11,175 --> 01:02:12,660
Scott: You know, we have this much time.

776
01:02:13,121 --> 01:02:15,028
Scott: These are our goals, right?

777
01:02:15,249 --> 01:02:16,895
Scott: You know, this is what we want to do.

778
01:02:16,995 --> 01:02:18,239
Scott: This is what we need, right?

779
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:22,352
Scott: You just you lay everything out, you know and you and then you'll.

780
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:28,536
Scott: well, you know, you you got to calculate like hey You know, would it be better to just go with a ferry right?

781
01:02:28,656 --> 01:02:34,555
Scott: It's like, you know Accept all possible solutions and then once you have one in place, it's like.

782
01:02:34,635 --> 01:02:36,160
Scott: and then the next thing comes along.

783
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,089
Scott: It's like damn, you know, we want it.

784
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:39,575
Scott: We went with the ferry idea.

785
01:02:39,636 --> 01:02:40,600
Scott: That was the best idea.

786
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,739
Scott: It was the right idea at the time with what we knew.

787
01:02:43,422 --> 01:02:56,620
Scott: But now we want to get cars over and we bought a people-only ferry And the dock we made is a people-only dock and we can't get cars up on the dock Even if we went out and bought a car ferry.

788
01:02:57,626 --> 01:02:58,194
Scott: What are we gonna do?

789
01:03:00,803 --> 01:03:06,223
Scott: You know that we build a bridge or do we redo the docks and get a new and get a new ferry Right?

790
01:03:06,383 --> 01:03:11,158
Rym: and in what we're on the surface seemed like fairly equivalent situations with large platforms.

791
01:03:11,198 --> 01:03:15,120
Rym: in my career I have told people Stop all new features.

792
01:03:15,762 --> 01:03:21,020
Rym: I'm gonna give you a full year to rebuild this thing from scratch instead of adding anything to the existing platform.

793
01:03:21,684 --> 01:03:27,820
Rym: I have in very similar situations said We're just gonna keep this going because three years from now we're shutting the whole thing down.

794
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,168
Rym: Anyway, so nope, you're not gonna be architected.

795
01:03:30,469 --> 01:03:31,251
Rym: Just heat.

796
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:33,740
Rym: put more and more duct tape on it until we shut it down.

797
01:03:34,423 --> 01:03:35,729
Scott: It's like what's the calculation?

798
01:03:35,789 --> 01:03:38,120
Scott: how much money you know, how much money we gonna spend right?

799
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,264
Scott: Is it worth it to build?

800
01:03:39,284 --> 01:03:40,389
Scott: you just calculate it, right?

801
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:42,700
Scott: Is it worth it to do this or not?

802
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:48,380
Rym: But I find the the places where tech debt the interest you're paying on your tech debt gets the worst.

803
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,840
Rym: When people have the biggest problem is talked about the least.

804
01:03:51,721 --> 01:03:59,380
Rym: Tech debt is usually relatively cheap if the same team that built it originally is still the team working on it today.

805
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:07,071
Rym: But if that original team of say five people Four of them are replaced with new people over five years

806
01:04:07,492 --> 01:04:08,094
Scott: and now

807
01:04:08,676 --> 01:04:16,420
Rym: you've got to deal with tech debt That tech debt is a lot more expensive because you don't have people who know why it was built the way it was originally

808
01:04:17,301 --> 01:04:17,883
Scott: Mm-hmm,

809
01:04:18,505 --> 01:04:21,715
Rym: and especially now like right now today in this post couple

810
01:04:22,156 --> 01:04:23,119
Scott: the weird

811
01:04:23,942 --> 01:04:29,880
Rym: Sort of not quite actually post COVID time and the great resignation and engineers quitting all over the place in changing jobs.

812
01:04:30,385 --> 01:04:41,859
Rym: If any of you out there interact with technology debt There is a high chance that interest rate is gonna quadruple as people quit and you lose the only Person left who knows how that code even works.

813
01:04:42,924 --> 01:04:44,580
Scott: Well, I mean that could be a thing that you you know.

814
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:55,669
Scott: If you're a if you lose a lot of engineering employees, right that might be like, okay Well the new people who come in right and I want to attract new people Right have a new thing.

815
01:04:55,729 --> 01:05:10,899
Rym: don't have them work on the old thing, right, you know That's uh, that's a strategy I have employed to entice people to join my engineering teams over the years like hey I'm gonna let you rebuild this thing from scratch.

816
01:05:11,922 --> 01:05:14,939
Rym: Yep, people get real excited about that at least at first.

817
01:05:15,616 --> 01:05:18,469
Scott: Yeah because they can not make all the mistakes of the past.

818
01:05:18,549 --> 01:05:23,747
Scott: make all new mistakes learn from those new mistakes then go to another place and Learn from those mistakes and so on and so forth.

819
01:05:23,787 --> 01:05:25,353
Rym: and don't you're nine dot dot.

820
01:05:25,574 --> 01:05:28,305
Rym: don't think you can avoid Making mistakes.

821
01:05:28,346 --> 01:05:32,142
Rym: The only way to avoid making mistakes is to treat it like Engineering.

822
01:05:32,403 --> 01:05:36,033
Rym: with a capital E and almost no job you get anywhere.

823
01:05:36,073 --> 01:05:40,104
Rym: making software will actually treat engineering Like engineering.

824
01:05:40,204 --> 01:05:46,966
Scott: that is rare even if you weren't right, but I mean even if you work at NASA where it's capital E engineering It's like they make mistakes.

825
01:05:47,307 --> 01:05:47,587
Scott: Yep.

826
01:05:47,969 --> 01:05:49,092
Rym: They still make mistakes.

827
01:05:49,493 --> 01:05:51,680
Rym: The mistakes are sometimes even more costly.

828
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:52,865
Rym: They live one shot to do.

829
01:05:52,885 --> 01:05:56,900
Scott: that's why they make it capital E because the mistakes are so costly.

830
01:06:01,255 --> 01:06:03,790
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

831
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:08,670
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

832
01:06:08,911 --> 01:06:10,878
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

833
01:06:10,918 --> 01:06:13,910
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

834
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:20,848
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate.

835
01:06:20,908 --> 01:06:25,126
Scott: Thursdays GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons attribution 3.0 license.

836
01:06:26,392 --> 01:06:29,450
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

837
01:06:29,651 --> 01:06:32,581
Scott: But unlike those other late shows it's actually recorded at night.

838
01:06:32,862 --> 01:06:36,936
Rym: and the patreon patrons who want me to say their names at the end Of this particular episode?

839
01:06:36,956 --> 01:06:45,163
Rym: or Alan Joyce Linkichi adrenaline Tenerbrae and a bunch of people who really don't want me to say their names Chris the dog Chris rhymer Clinton Walton Dex Finn shy 85 Rebecca Dunn review.

840
01:06:45,183 --> 01:06:46,327
Rym: mad bill 34 cowards.

841
01:06:46,427 --> 01:06:48,273
Rym: Sam Erickson Sure, but horrible.

842
01:06:48,534 --> 01:06:50,522
Rym: stop all the downloading Taylor Braun.

843
01:06:50,742 --> 01:06:51,947
Rym: The next station is st.

844
01:06:52,067 --> 01:06:55,418
Rym: Andrew st Andrew station and a bunch of other people.

845
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,350
Rym: So well, yeah, we're probably going to that hockey game tomorrow.

846
01:06:59,912 --> 01:07:03,103
Rym: Do a show on Wednesday on something Scott hasn't seen orbital children.

847
01:07:03,123 --> 01:07:05,150
Rym: I don't know what Scott's watching lately.

848
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:10,728
