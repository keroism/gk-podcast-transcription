00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,488
Rym: It's Thursday, May 12th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:15,594
Rym: I'm Rym Scott's yawning.

3
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:19,092
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:19,373 --> 00:00:21,320
Rym: We are talking about swimming.

5
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,013
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,182 --> 00:00:28,658
Rym: So, uh, I was involved in a biking incident on my way to work this morning.

7
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:36,053
Rym: a minor one But there's a. there's a light getting into biking incidents a minor one, but on the way home I I was not involved in any biking incidents.

8
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:43,480
Rym: However, I Witness One of the bigger bike dramas I have ever seen like on my commute.

9
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:44,771
Rym: It was seen a few.

10
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:45,739
Scott: how big could it be?

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:55,760
Rym: It was moderately big because it kept escalating and as I was biking home I'd get to the next red light and encounter more of the like follow-up of this drama.

12
00:00:57,002 --> 00:01:08,819
Rym: Okay, so, uh on the way to work pretty straightforward I was biking to work and a cab Cut across two lanes suddenly and just went straight across the bike lane Hit the front of my city bike and then like screeched to a halt like right then.

13
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:11,512
Rym: So they bonked the city bike and there's a little dent in their hood.

14
00:01:11,532 --> 00:01:11,995
Rym: I was fine.

15
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:13,140
Rym: The city bike weighs 50 pounds.

16
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:19,725
Rym: I'm just sitting there and then the cab rolls down his window and he starts yelling at me Like it's my mate.

17
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:20,208
Scott: So there's wait.

18
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:21,435
Scott: so they cut across two lanes.

19
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:22,340
Scott: They're making a left.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,398
Rym: they were making a left like but not from the left most not from the left most from the leftmost lane.

21
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,792
Rym: and With a the bike.

22
00:01:29,832 --> 00:01:34,230
Rym: there was one of those bike Greenlight saying bikes had the right-of-way and the red left turn.

23
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,100
Rym: the light for red for left turns for cars was red.

24
00:01:37,802 --> 00:01:42,800
Scott: So you see you bonked into the side of the cab like a tee like the fronts like a very no left.

25
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:44,110
Scott: You were going straight.

26
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:45,159
Rym: I was going straight left.

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,982
Rym: He went left.

28
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:49,956
Rym: if it been a car it would be like a t-bone accident probably and I saw him coming.

29
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:52,517
Rym: but city bikes Can't stop that quick.

30
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,600
Scott: Even if you're going to jump off that you could always jump off the back.

31
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,140
Rym: I thought about it, but he was already like tires were screeching.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,550
Rym: There was a little bonk and a little dent.

33
00:01:59,893 --> 00:02:00,779
Rym: so he starts to yell at me.

34
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:05,760
Rym: So I just looked at him and I kicked the side of the cab and I put a dent in his door.

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,403
Rym: I just biked away.

36
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:08,311
Rym: Okay, that was the end of that.

37
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:10,240
Rym: like city bike was unharmed.

38
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:17,186
Rym: But on the way home, so I'm biking and I get past Really aggressively by this fixie guy.

39
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:19,412
Rym: He whistles at me and like passes.

40
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:20,375
Rym: He's just weaving like crazy.

41
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:21,659
Rym: Whatever people like that all the time.

42
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:28,740
Rym: so There's a red light up ahead and a ton of bikers are just stopped at the red light in that tiny little narrow bike path.

43
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,402
Rym: I'm like First Avenue and I'm pulling up.

44
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:33,749
Rym: I'm slowing down ready to just stop and wait for the light

45
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:33,829
Scott: and

46
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:47,620
Rym: The fixie guy is stuck in this group and he starts kind of shoving his way through the people like he's albowing people out of the way Physically gets his bike to the front and then he just like runs through the red light in front of some cars and keeps going.

47
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:48,705
Rym: Whatever that happens.

48
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,035
Rym: So light turns green.

49
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:53,543
Rym: I go with all the bikers I see I up ahead.

50
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:57,630
Rym: that guy is now again at the next red light and he's already.

51
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,470
Rym: It's clearly like trying to get through the red light.

52
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,593
Rym: He does that bike maneuver.

53
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:02,817
Rym: that always annoys me.

54
00:03:02,857 --> 00:03:06,990
Rym: that fixie people do the most where they don't want to run the red light directly.

55
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:17,214
Rym: so they kind of turn onto the street and Like the cross street and they go down it and do a little loop and come back up the other side to just sort of Skip the red light.

56
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:32,070
Rym: so he does this and on his way He his handlebar clips a scooter guy on his backpack pulls him off his bike and like he falls over And the guy's like, ah, hey and the fixie guy turns around flips him off and keeps biking.

57
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:33,291
Scott: Okay.

58
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:33,793
Scott: All right.

59
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:37,004
Rym: So that is that is not even worthy of being a geek.

60
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:38,028
Rym: I like an open ebit.

61
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:39,962
Rym: so far Here's where it gets fun.

62
00:03:40,527 --> 00:03:44,790
Rym: So Scooter guy like gets up dust himself off and light turns green.

63
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:48,030
Rym: He goes off ahead and I go off ahead and now we're just biking straight.

64
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,973
Rym: I see the fixie guy.

65
00:03:48,993 --> 00:03:52,927
Rym: then behind him is scooter guy and behind scooter guy is me.

66
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:53,489
Rym: We're just going.

67
00:03:54,271 --> 00:04:01,490
Rym: Scooter guy goes to the right a little bit Speeds up and gets ahead of fixie guy and then rams him from the side.

68
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,427
Rym: Fixie guy flips over his handlebars goes spinning the his front tire is like bent.

69
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:14,308
Rym: his phone Shatters on the ground and he's bleeding and I stopped to help him like dude.

70
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:14,970
Rym: Are you okay?

71
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:17,519
Rym: He gets up and he doesn't want to help.

72
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,825
Rym: He's like chase that guy.

73
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:19,990
Rym: I'm gonna beat the shit out of him.

74
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:27,195
Scott: So I'm just like dude, honestly is already a violent and there's already a violent angry dude Beforehand, so I'm just like.

75
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:28,238
Rym: so I just look at him.

76
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,626
Rym: I'm like, you know what fuck you.

77
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:33,408
Rym: I'm on scooter guy side I tell him that and I bike off.

78
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:38,230
Scott: So then I mean, I'm not I'm not an either of those people side, right?

79
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,570
Scott: They're violent aggressive people who deserve each other.

80
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,690
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's like if that you know, if that dude was driving a car, he'd be a road rage dude, right?

81
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:55,790
Rym: That's like and I'm of you feel like with cars One road rage should be a one strike and you never drive again Like you are too dangerous to be in charge of a vehicle ever.

82
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:56,733
Scott: I think you would be.

83
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,065
Scott: you're definitely a borderline road rage person.

84
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:05,651
Rym: I have never in my life Never once never even Uh-huh.

85
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:07,039
Rym: Honestly, why would you?

86
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,184
Rym: I would even say something like that.

87
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:09,813
Scott: I uh-huh Why are you kidding?

88
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,863
Scott: Why are you kicking some guy's door putting a dent in it?

89
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:13,130
Rym: Cuz he was yelling at me.

90
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,853
Rym: He almost hit me.

91
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:17,166
Scott: Yeah, well you caught your wave your middle finger at people all the time.

92
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,716
Rym: But that's New York That's just a friendly.

93
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:19,019
Rym: Hello.

94
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:24,020
Scott: Yeah, I See if I'm in any of those situations, I just go.

95
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,010
Scott: yeah, I know calmly calmly go out my way.

96
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:32,741
Rym: So it's just like all right, so Fixie guy eventually passes me.

97
00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:40,067
Rym: cuz he's chasing scooter guy And he catches up to him and tries to fight with him and scooter guy.

98
00:05:40,127 --> 00:06:09,934
Rym: at this point It's just like like he kind of shrugs and just feeds off and they were racing and I finally lost sight of them After they both almost got hit by a truck because they ran a red light while they were fighting with each other mmm, and Then at the very end of all this there's an old guy who'd been puttering along kind of next to me the whole time on a city bike same as me and he Pulls up next to me and he just turns to me and says that was really funny And I'm just like

99
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:10,718
Scott: kind of was.

100
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,330
Rym: and then he laughs and then I bike tell me here I am.

101
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:16,168
Scott: I mean, you know, I feel like.

102
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:23,027
Scott: You know, there are definitely people in society who for whatever reason me not being a psychologist or anything.

103
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:24,933
Scott: It's like I. just what the fuck Do I know right?

104
00:06:24,953 --> 00:06:34,644
Scott: It's like they're looking for a fight like there are clearly people who are Permanently or temporarily angry and not the kind of angry that that you know, I have.

105
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:36,790
Scott: we're like, I'm angry at an unjust society.

106
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:46,341
Rym: Yeah I'm not like the sharp anger of like say you're driving a car and you did just get t-boned by someone around a red light You would justifiably be very angry about that situation.

107
00:06:47,224 --> 00:06:47,927
Scott: I wouldn't be angry.

108
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:49,997
Scott: I'd be like, oh my god I want don't want to die.

109
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:56,909
Rym: I mean after like say you're fine and it happened I'd be angry that well be late to wherever I was going because somebody broke the law and assaulted me.

110
00:06:57,653 --> 00:07:01,348
Scott: Well, I'd be angry at the unjust society for being car centric, right?

111
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:03,559
Scott: I mean, of course Anger already exists.

112
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:03,981
Scott: I'll be like.

113
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:10,850
Scott: well another example of the thing I'm already justifiably angry about but this is the road rage kind of anger, right?

114
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:16,125
Scott: You're a person who yells you're a person who is trying to hurt other people.

115
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:32,710
Scott: You're a person who will Physically, you know, you know yell or worse act aggressively, you know in a disproportionate Response to things that happen near or adjacent to you or within your vision, right?

116
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:44,841
Scott: You know those sort people who behave in that way Right certainly exist In some quantity and They act in that way some percentage of their lives.

117
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,868
Scott: That is more than average.

118
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:48,874
Rym: Well, it's There it's the disk.

119
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:57,110
Scott: and in response in that way in acting that way Those people are you know harming?

120
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,105
Scott: Society right that society is less healthy the more people are doing that right.

121
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:08,827
Rym: so we need Demick society level interventions to try to understand this and stop it.

122
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:19,010
Scott: Yes There needs to be something that's like, you know Hey, even if you haven't, you know fucking murdered anybody or beat anyone up or anything like that, right?

123
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,894
Scott: It's like if you're an angry kind of person Right, who's?

124
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:37,707
Scott: you know acting this way and you know causing angry scenes or you know, whatever It's like you're not a person that you know should be allowed to say operate heavy machinery or That's why so much on children.

125
00:08:41,735 --> 00:08:42,600
Rym: It's three factors.

126
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:50,838
Rym: the factors are a disproportionate response to a situation repeatedly having these disproportionate responses.

127
00:08:51,199 --> 00:09:00,269
Rym: and the disproportionate response is in the context of something like You're in control of a multi-ton death machine or you are a cop with a gun.

128
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:10,090
Rym: Because like a proportionate response like, you know you see two people and they like they almost hit each other with their cars and they both go fuck you and they honk their Horns and then they drive away.

129
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:11,598
Rym: That's very different from up.

130
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:20,350
Rym: someone gets cut off and then they like Follow someone else's car all the way home and get out screaming at them which happens kind of often actually in society.

131
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:24,470
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, there's the intersection of the T intersection out my house.

132
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:29,694
Scott: They changed it, you know years ago right to make one of the streets a two-way street And it's very poorly designed.

133
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:30,577
Scott: all kinds of accidents.

134
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:32,926
Scott: one time a car crashed into the brick wall.

135
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:37,527
Scott: It was you know, wow But you know, I've seen some.

136
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:42,990
Scott: you know So little fender benders out there and most of the time you hear like screech bump, right?

137
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:52,970
Scott: You look out the window and there's two people and they pull over Right and then they get out and they go mumble mumble mumble mumble insurance insurance insurance back in the car, right?

138
00:09:53,030 --> 00:10:05,466
Scott: Maybe there's a tow, you know, but you know, it's it's not it's not common But it does happen where one person gets out and it's like they're gonna you know They're gonna like be try to fight the other person, right?

139
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:16,201
Scott: And it's like that's a person who needs some kind of help and that help should be forced upon them gets Interesting and trick for the benefit of society.

140
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:23,337
Scott: This might be a topic for another show because Unrelatedly Emily I haven't read that's a topic for a show that should have a Psychologist or a psychiatrist.

141
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:23,920
Scott: you get a guest.

142
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:25,530
Scott: Oh cuz what the fuck do we know?

143
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:25,971
Rym: Well, no, cuz.

144
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:29,805
Rym: so Emily and I've randomly we've been reading a lot about road rage and those kinds of things.

145
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:32,700
Rym: because uh-huh related to all this.

146
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:36,840
Rym: well now because There was a bunch of studies many years ago.

147
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:50,608
Rym: They're starting to add up that you know the lead poisoning I bought this is people who have lead poisoning have Objectively like this is a measurable effect Reduced impulse control increased anger and violence responses just across the board in their lives.

148
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:52,958
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, that's well known.

149
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:59,150
Rym: everyone in America who lived in America Especially in cities or near roads older than us has some amount of lead poisoning.

150
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,550
Rym: We're one of the first generations when the lead atmosphere levels were lower.

151
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:06,169
Scott: I mean, we might have lead poisoning from all those painted glass cups.

152
00:11:07,756 --> 00:11:19,030
Rym: but to Deficiencies in B vitamins like not not not not supplement nonsense, but more like Your diet is so bad that you are not getting enough B vitamins.

153
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:37,560
Rym: It's also very strongly correlated to violence and poor impulse control Mmm, and third and this was the tricky one There is some emerging evidence that there is that if you look at broad populations There is one cluster of genes and people.

154
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:49,490
Rym: it's not that people who have that cluster of gene variants are gonna be violent But a very high percentage of people who are in prison for violence have that gene cluster compared to other populations.

155
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:58,230
Rym: Mm-hmm, there's a very thorny and complex conversation around all that could be a causation correlation problem, too.

156
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,187
Scott: Right something about prisons causes people's genes to change, you know, who knows?

157
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:03,607
Rym: Yep There's that.

158
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:06,186
Rym: well So this even tracked kids in school who are?

159
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:11,090
Scott: or hey The people who putting people in prison tend to put black people in prison.

160
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:11,813
Rym: Oh, no, it does so.

161
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:15,209
Rym: these gene clusters do not correlate to any physical demographics.

162
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:30,885
Rym: Not like aid they correlate differently between men and women so far but not like black people versus white people versus Asian people Etc, but it's also could be it could be you know Low-income people tend to make babies with low-income people and in their neighborhoods.

163
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:41,630
Scott: are you know, you know, oh, yeah but but what this all leads to is Suppose we discover that us some percentage of that's who police go after police don't that rich people in jail that often?

164
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,398
Rym: so suppose we in?

165
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:55,602
Scott: we discover that there is an environmental cause for some subset of violence in society in that we can say whoever whoever created that Environmental problem is a murder company put polluted.

166
00:12:55,763 --> 00:13:08,506
Rym: the polluting company should be held responsible But also crimes the people who were impacted by that where their crimes were likely caused by that Arguably less culpable in the crimes they committed.

167
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:12,627
Scott: Yes The company that poisoned them should be to take that culpability.

168
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,130
Scott: exactly.

169
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:15,714
Scott: And did the P?

170
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:18,825
Scott: in fact, you know the people who were poisoned should sue and get.

171
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:23,541
Scott: you're right All right, you poison you.

172
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:36,950
Scott: if so if I came along and I Poisoned you right with a poison that makes you rob a bank right on your own That sounds like a really good K drama to make poison that makes you rob banks, right?

173
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,781
Scott: It's like I poisoned you and then you rob a bet.

174
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,290
Scott: the poison makes you rob a bank.

175
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,110
Scott: It's one of those mind-controlling fungus boys, and I'm not guilty of any parasite.

176
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:45,313
Scott: It's like.

177
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,770
Scott: it's like well Rym wouldn't have robbed the bank if it wasn't for the parasite.

178
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:54,250
Scott: So the parasite did it but Scott knowingly had the parasite and in knowingly put it on the Rym.

179
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:59,430
Scott: Yeah, or even if I negligently produced the parasite and put it on the Rym, right?

180
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:09,296
Scott: It's like I'm some I'm responsible for the bank robbery in some large sense more so than Rym is right, right Alright, so in the news there is actually so.

181
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:16,348
Rym: remember when kovat first hit like those early terrifying days and there was a meat shortage during that.

182
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:18,396
Rym: Like there was a meat shortage.

183
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:19,299
Rym: It was in the news.

184
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:22,510
Rym: the government like the federal government everything shortage.

185
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,355
Rym: well so that that's the news.

186
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,775
Rym: and the federal government actually took a bunch of measures to Like.

187
00:14:29,338 --> 00:14:36,506
Rym: let meat packing companies Continue to operate despite the risk of kovat and reduce safety controls and all this stuff to like.

188
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:37,850
Rym: get the meat supply going again.

189
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:44,062
Rym: bad choices, uh, so It turns out this is actually pretty breaking news from today.

190
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:50,628
Rym: There's a really big expose and Rolling Stone We now know there was never a meat shortage at any point.

191
00:14:51,573 --> 00:15:09,293
Rym: All of that was fabricated by the meat industry and they paid Lobbyists to bribe the US federal government and Trump and the Republicans to basically use this as an excuse To get rid of a bunch of OSHA controls and get and avoid all the kovat controls and kill a whole bunch of their very Low-income workers.

192
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:10,697
Scott: that no surprise.

193
00:15:10,818 --> 00:15:13,526
Rym: There was never at any point a meat shortage during kovat.

194
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:14,730
Rym: That was a Republican lie?

195
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:16,114
Scott: Yeah, of course.

196
00:15:16,154 --> 00:15:16,756
Scott: No surprises.

197
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:17,118
Scott: Yep.

198
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,870
Rym: And this article is a pretty in-depth expose of all of this.

199
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:21,429
Rym: There's gonna be hearings now.

200
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:23,034
Rym: There's a house select committee.

201
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,922
Rym: that is like we might be criminal charges.

202
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:27,526
Rym: This is all unfolding right now.

203
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:33,510
Scott: I Mean, you know the problem is is you know again, how many times can we talk about this?

204
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,490
Scott: Right if a company commits a crime basically nothing happens, right?

205
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:43,440
Scott: It's like you need to have a situation where for companies commit crimes The CEOs go are the ones who.

206
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,150
Scott: you know, it's like I'm all for abolishing prisons.

207
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:52,650
Scott: But if we're gonna have prisons They should be filled with CEOs and not with someone who robbed a convenience store for a pack of gum, right?

208
00:15:53,732 --> 00:16:00,080
Scott: Oh or someone who robbed the drugstore for baby formula because there's a baby formula shortage It's real and their baby is starving.

209
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,542
Rym: Oh, I did.

210
00:16:00,642 --> 00:16:04,316
Rym: Yeah that baby for formula shortage I don't think we have time to talk about it tonight.

211
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:10,130
Rym: And also if you just heard about that from us, that's just a shame Goddamn, you're not reading news.

212
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:15,930
Rym: Yeah, if you heard about it here first Yeah, baby that point is a shortage is a big fucking deal and a lot of kids are gonna die.

213
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:17,649
Rym: This is actually a huge crisis.

214
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:23,253
Scott: Well, you know, it's been a crisis for a while, you know, even before that the current shortage It's like they're.

215
00:16:23,394 --> 00:16:26,830
Scott: you know, baby formula is real expensive and they weren't making enough of it.

216
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,590
Rym: But now it's way like there isn't enough and there won't be for a long time now.

217
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:43,283
Scott: anyway, the point is is that you know, you could see you could be a CEO and have a company that steals a billion dollars and Basically, you know not face any really life-changing consequences.

218
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:52,790
Scott: and you can be you know a poor homeless person and rob a drugstore for $20 and at least spend a night in jail or something.

219
00:16:52,915 --> 00:17:05,868
Rym: well the salient line of always not if not worse the the line that gets repeated like the most succinct point is if a crime Has a punishment that is a fine Then that is actually simply a price tag.

220
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:09,921
Rym: Yeah, like if you were I speed in a car.

221
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:14,615
Rym: we could we could both pay any speeding ticket And it wouldn't even hurt us that much.

222
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:17,386
Rym: But if a poor person gets pulled over for even speeding a little bit.

223
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:18,390
Scott: They're fucked.

224
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:20,772
Scott: We don't get.

225
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:22,759
Scott: some countries scale it we don't we should.

226
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:25,749
Scott: but even scaling it is not solving the problem.

227
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:27,584
Rym: Nope well, the problem is cars.

228
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:31,287
Rym: but Yes You got some news.

229
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:36,309
Scott: Yeah, so there's that I talked about this in the night's forum.

230
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:41,244
Scott: It's a kpop news, but it's it's actually not entirely kpop news.

231
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:43,130
Scott: This is girl Alexa, right?

232
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,803
Scott: That's you know, I think her real name is.

233
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,150
Scott: I could look it up on Wikipedia.

234
00:17:47,311 --> 00:17:47,914
Scott: you can too.

235
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:53,269
Scott: so go ahead but her stage name is Alexa and She's from Oklahoma.

236
00:17:54,493 --> 00:18:01,929
Scott: so she's a Korean American from Oklahoma and By you can read the whole story online of by circumstances, right?

237
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:10,767
Scott: Similar to like the otaku dream that many nerds lived of like, you know going to Japan and you know Making animation like Stevie B or whatever, right?

238
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:22,455
Scott: Yeah She ended up in Korea right as a kpop star in Korea despite being from Oklahoma And that you know.

239
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,443
Scott: and was she super popular?

240
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:25,930
Scott: not really right.

241
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,254
Scott: It's like.

242
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:31,544
Scott: she was on you know One of those competition shows and she got almost no screen time and did not win.

243
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:40,350
Scott: and then a company Believed in her because she was quite talented and invested money in her and produced music for her and she was on the music shows.

244
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:46,470
Scott: She didn't have a ton of fans, right, but she wasn't like, you know Absolute no one right?

245
00:18:46,630 --> 00:19:00,024
Scott: She was sort of I'd say if you had to rank kpop popularity from like what one being Someone you never heard of and had to disband immediately with no money and five being BTS She might be like a two or two and a half, right?

246
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:00,326
Scott: Mm-hmm.

247
00:19:01,772 --> 00:19:03,817
Scott: So but you know, she was.

248
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:18,950
Scott: you know, people who really followed kpop a lot could see her right, you know Recognize her and especially in the english-speaking kpop community international kpop community Knew her because she could speak fucking English right cuz she's from.

249
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:25,730
Scott: So her content online was very accessible to people around the world.

250
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,839
Scott: It didn't have to wait for it to be subtitled or anything like that.

251
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,120
Scott: Right?

252
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:44,235
Scott: So she was getting around, you know, and Somehow in the United States they decided like the United States always foolishly does to try to take something that was popular in another country and Remake it in an American way And make it worse.

253
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:48,610
Scott: right and you know, they did that with the mass singer show, right?

254
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,929
Scott: Which is a Korean show and they did it with Eurovision, right?

255
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,469
Scott: And so they remade Eurovision in the US.

256
00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:04,379
Scott: they called it American song contest and they had a competitor from each state and Thanks to Alexa's agent And I guess their quality business skills.

257
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,030
Scott: They got her to be the representative from Oklahoma, huh?

258
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:15,430
Scott: So this this kpop girl basically is representing Oklahoma really in musically nothing, Oklahoma.

259
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:20,643
Scott: You would expect a country music right from Oklahoma.

260
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,210
Scott: All right, nothing country going on here whatsoever.

261
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:28,177
Scott: So it turns out that that show Was not a popular show.

262
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:32,769
Scott: right people it was not killing it in the ratings Exactly, right.

263
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:37,729
Scott: The mass singer thing I think ended up being more popular than than this one, right?

264
00:20:38,874 --> 00:20:44,427
Scott: Regardless She won because why a bunch of kpop people voted for her.

265
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:52,907
Scott: That's why It's the power of kpop Right, even if they weren't like number one Alexa fans like, you know, she's their favorite person ever.

266
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:54,552
Scott: It's like There.

267
00:20:54,773 --> 00:21:07,969
Scott: it's like there's a any kpop related person could have gone into this contest And as long as there was no other more popular kpop person the kpop community that you know Spoke English was gonna go and vote for them, right?

268
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:10,680
Scott: And so she won the whole thing, right?

269
00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:12,650
Scott: And in fact, I think she broke that it was funny.

270
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,349
Scott: I think she broke the trophy when she would.

271
00:21:16,302 --> 00:21:16,948
Scott: It was very funny.

272
00:21:19,052 --> 00:21:26,390
Scott: But it's just really interesting right to point out how Right, you know for all that there's many negative things to say about kpop.

273
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:41,309
Scott: We can go on all day about that but this is an example of one of kpop's positive traits the industry's positive traits in that sort of positive trait right and that they just want to be successful and make money right.

274
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:45,420
Scott: and Because it's an entertainment business, right?

275
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:48,430
Scott: They don't give a shit if you're from Oklahoma, right?

276
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,761
Scott: It's like if there's a way they can make money on you.

277
00:21:52,142 --> 00:21:54,570
Scott: It's like come on in right they'll accept.

278
00:21:54,650 --> 00:22:01,530
Scott: They got kpop people coming from, you know, all kinds of countries Thailand Japan Korea us, right?

279
00:22:01,871 --> 00:22:02,917
Scott: It's like they don't give it.

280
00:22:02,937 --> 00:22:04,364
Scott: You don't have to be Korean, right?

281
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:09,730
Scott: It's like you don't speak Korean All right, you know just you know, well you learn enough words to go on TV, right?

282
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:10,778
Scott: It's like you.

283
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:12,914
Scott: as long as you can sing a dance All right, you can.

284
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:15,269
Scott: you learn to sing the song and you don't know any other words.

285
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:17,016
Scott: great It's like just come on.

286
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:19,125
Scott: I think Alexis speaks better Korean than that.

287
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:19,768
Scott: I'm not you know.

00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:25,529
Scott: And I guess I don't speak Korean so I can't judge.

290
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:28,460
Scott: but She's not someone who learned just a few words, right?

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,470
Scott: She's been living there like four years or something.

292
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:37,106
Scott: There was like a video like, you know, she like got to see her parents in Oklahoma after like so many years Right not seeing them.

293
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:46,662
Scott: Yeah, it's like the you know, the the accepting of anyone, you know, and then also, you know At least the international fans right of kpop, you know.

298
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:11,150
Scott: It's like, you know, at least three or three and a half star here out of the five.

Scott: so That's it's something.

300
00:23:13,795 --> 00:23:15,060

00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:52,523
Rym: In dune part two the Emperor is going to be played no joke by Christopher Walken Which is the kind of casting that nerds always say?

309
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:54,990
Rym: Oh, they should make Nick Cage and Christopher Walken play.

310
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,342
Rym: It's that kind of casting but that is actually the casting.

Scott: Yep.

312
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:00,088

315
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:14,262
Scott: It's not a Christopher Walken type character, right?

316
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:25,387
Scott: It's a serious, you know dark you know dude, right like You know Like a Roman Emperor, it's you know, only not not insane.

317
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:37,722
Scott: Yeah But and Christopher Walken, you know, he has that, you know slight, you know goofy quirkiness to him Of course, I guess like he I remember in a suicide Kings.

318
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:40,530
Rym: He's a little more restrained and terrifying.

319
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:54,656
Scott: Right is is but he has that sort of You know Somewhat, you know easygoing humorousness and not the completely, you know Seriousness at all times.

320
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:57,325
Scott: but you know, it's a still even so right.

321
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:58,770
Scott: that doesn't matter, right?

322
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,449
Scott: It's not about my what I imagine the dune Emperor to be like, right?

323
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,490
Scott: It's not like the dune Emperor her last that long anyways.

324
00:25:09,626 --> 00:25:11,895
Scott: But This news though.

325
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:14,810
Scott: Usually I don't give a shit about you know, casting news has come out all the time.

326
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,753
Scott: I usually don't give a shit.

327
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:18,664
Scott: This actually makes me really want to see.

328
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,090

Rym: Way more Christopher Walken.

332
00:25:26,621 --> 00:25:27,788
Scott: I wanted to see it already.

333
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:37,222
Rym: either He is unexpected in the way He plays this character and it's amazing or he's expected in the way We think he'll play this character and I feel like that will still be amazing.

334
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:39,470
Scott: I don't see any way that this is bad.

335
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:43,415
Scott: This can only be.

336
00:25:43,436 --> 00:25:47,850
Scott: this is they're basically just announced like let me translate the announcement, right?

337
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,642
Scott: It's basically like doing.

338
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:50,568
Scott: part two is coming.

339
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:57,392
Scott: You were already gonna see it and the news today is it's gonna be more entertaining than you already thought It was gonna be.

340
00:25:57,613 --> 00:25:57,834
Scott: yep.

341
00:25:58,236 --> 00:25:58,798
Scott: That's the new.

342
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:01,428
Scott: raise your expectation without concern.

343
00:26:01,488 --> 00:26:11,945
Rym: It's like, okay I've raised my expectation without concern, but also we know for a fact That he knows how to walk without rhythm so as to not attract the worm.

344
00:26:11,965 --> 00:26:16,221
Scott: I Don't think does the Emperor ever actually have to walk without rhythm.

345
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:18,529
Rym: I don't think the Emperor ever actually has to walk.

346
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:20,916
Scott: That you're thinking of the other.

347
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:21,941
Rym: not only I'm.

348
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:24,050
Rym: I feel like the Emperor might just get wheeled around too.

349
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:32,630
Rym: So I thought the Emperor was a guy who could walk Absolutely, but I feel like he's the kind of person who had servants to walk for him if he wanted to.

350
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:36,138
Rym: Anyway, anyway in one last little news.

351
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:38,044
Rym: I got two minor convention news.

352
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:39,749
Rym: is that are funny because they're both.

353
00:26:41,071 --> 00:26:44,324
Rym: They are both two sides of the same problem.

354
00:26:44,364 --> 00:27:00,563
Rym: that happens with a lot of nerdy conventions in that the kinds of people who attend a lot of nerdy conventions bring their own unique problems and challenges to the venues that may normally be used to Regular boring people doing regular normal hotel stuff.

355
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:02,530
Scott: I mean, that's true, right?

356
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,790
Scott: Most of the conventions and conferences are really quiet, you know.

357
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,889
Scott: They're usually companies of the vendors and those sorts of things like this.

358
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:17,395
Rym: The reason the escalators break at every convention because no convention is ready for nerd conventions, right or their academic conferences Right, but there are can.

359
00:27:17,456 --> 00:27:21,510
Scott: there are conventions and conferences that are way way way worse.

360
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:26,582
Rym: Oh, yeah The young Republicans convention is the worst one as far as I can tell.

361
00:27:26,782 --> 00:27:32,762
Scott: anything that has a frat like Atmosphere right is going to be if we we've.

362
00:27:32,862 --> 00:27:38,981
Scott: we know this from talking to many Hotel convention center staff over decade plus.

363
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:41,850
Rym: go find old GeekNights episodes about Katsucon.

364
00:27:42,212 --> 00:27:50,463
Rym: we interviewed like random maintenance people and they Shared some terrifying shit mostly about the concierges.

365
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,690
Scott: you talk to hotel housekeeping, right?

366
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,489
Scott: You talk to these people, you know, and you know security guards at convention centers things like that.

367
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:08,070
Scott: You know and you learn stuff and it's like yes The worst absolute conventions are the ones that have some sort of frat like atmosphere a bunch of white boys getting drunk being bad.

368
00:28:08,231 --> 00:28:09,929
Scott: Those are the ones that destroy everything.

369
00:28:10,512 --> 00:28:12,780
Rym: Nerds kind of problem, right?

370
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:18,985
Scott: The nerds are better than that but a Problem compared to the normal quiet business things.

371
00:28:19,226 --> 00:28:21,209
Rym: So first colossal con.

372
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:23,070
Scott: I've heard of that.

373
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:25,559
Scott: I don't know what kind of con it is But I've heard is one of those generic cons.

374
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,123
Rym: as far as I can.

375
00:28:26,184 --> 00:28:27,090
Scott: I don't know where it is either.

376
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,135
Rym: You know a bunch of people who go.

377
00:28:28,196 --> 00:28:29,804
Rym: it's at the Kalahari resort.

378
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,930
Rym: I don't actually know what state that's in.

379
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,558
Rym: I mean, it's not a con will go to pretty sure.

380
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,930
Rym: they just announced they're not masking or something.

381
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:36,229
Rym: But that's not what I'm talking about.

382
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:48,550
Rym: They sent a warning To the guests of colossal con About a potentially disruptive event that will be held in the convention center during those dates.

383
00:28:48,951 --> 00:28:57,097
Rym: But the event they warned the colossal con attendees about is colossal con What.

384
00:28:57,218 --> 00:28:58,489
Rym: so they put a warning out?

385
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:08,263
Rym: I'm gonna read the exact who put the warning out the the hotel the Convention Center hotel Sent a warning to the regular guests saying warning.

386
00:29:08,845 --> 00:29:13,419
Rym: a note if you choose to stay Specifically anytime during June 1st through 5th.

387
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:20,349
Rym: There is a unique private event throughout the resort called colossal con consisting of anime gaming and Japanese culture.

388
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:26,278
Rym: In an effort to accommodate our non convention guests We are enforcing a pg-13 rule.

389
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:28,526
Rym: nudity adult behaviors are banned.

390
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:32,918
Rym: all these rules Under 18 people are not allowed to go anywhere near the waterpark.

391
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:41,870
Rym: all these rules and this seems like it was written aimed at Regular people who happen to be staying at this resort during colossal con.

392
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:51,369
Scott: So they probably sent it to everyone who had a room booked that wasn't in the room block But they also sent it to the room block for colossal con.

393
00:29:52,551 --> 00:30:02,810
Scott: Okay, so some hotel person who sends an email and it isn't some technologically advanced person just you know sent the email out Thinking too hard about it not understanding or whatever.

394
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:17,268
Rym: But what they have actually banned is they're saying the entire resort has to be a pg-13 rule and it says specifically Nudity and adult behaviors are banned in guest rooms private spaces.

395
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:19,719
Scott: How can you even do that?

396
00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:21,590
Rym: I have no idea.

397
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:25,586
Scott: Are they cameras and all the guest spaces don't stay at this hotel?

398
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:35,807
Rym: Yeah So, uh Meanwhile, there's another convention the Motor City furry con and they had to post.

399
00:30:36,027 --> 00:30:36,850
Scott: I wonder where that is.

400
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:46,910
Rym: There are actually a Huge number of furry conventions and gaming conventions in Michigan that basically nobody has heard of outside of Michigan.

401
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,510
Rym: It might be the densest other than North Jersey.

402
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,584
Rym: It might be one of the densest places for like very small nerdy gaming conventions.

403
00:30:53,986 --> 00:31:08,136
Rym: Just anyway, so They sent a letter that has gone out in the past from many other conventions many kinds of conventions But they sent a very very long letter that was like look Everyone who went to our con last year.

404
00:31:08,156 --> 00:31:10,964
Rym: You got to stop leaving vomit everywhere.

405
00:31:11,345 --> 00:31:13,210
Rym: You got to stop leaving diapers everywhere.

406
00:31:13,674 --> 00:31:15,530
Rym: You got to stop sleeping in your cars.

407
00:31:16,212 --> 00:31:18,500
Rym: They're gonna ban us if you stay if you don't stop this shit.

408
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:29,330
Rym: and it is a very long and terrifying letter detailing Everything that the attendees of this convention did that are pushing the hotel to the point of possibly not letting them ever return.

409
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,596
Rym: You can read it if you enjoy.

410
00:31:33,696 --> 00:31:38,090
Rym: I enjoy convention drama just because it's it's like watching a car wreck in the distance.

411
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:46,224
Rym: It's just fascinating to behold but anyway things Of the day.

412
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:49,717
Rym: So, uh t-pain seems like a stand-up, dude.

413
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:53,470
Rym: He He succeeded in opening a restaurant.

414
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,594
Rym: he's really excited about it.

415
00:31:54,654 --> 00:31:55,237
Rym: it's cool thing.

416
00:31:55,377 --> 00:31:56,100
Scott: He's got enough money.

417
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,329
Scott: He can buy a restaurant just pay people to run it.

418
00:31:58,651 --> 00:31:59,133
Rym: if I like.

419
00:31:59,153 --> 00:32:04,035
Rym: it'd be pretty fun to run a restaurant Like listen if I had there's a restaurant you.

420
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,200
Scott: Staten Island is the worst place.

421
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,323
Scott: We've talked about this at length.

422
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:09,051
Scott: But yeah in Staten Island there is right.

423
00:32:09,132 --> 00:32:10,215
Scott: everyone has this idea.

424
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:11,860
Scott: They don't realize it actually exists.

425
00:32:12,262 --> 00:32:13,629
Scott: It's existed for many years.

426
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:23,120
Scott: There is a restaurant in Staten Island Completely operated only by grandma's of various nations who make grandma food.

427
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:23,944
Scott: How good is that?

428
00:32:24,648 --> 00:32:25,512
Scott: It's really insane.

429
00:32:25,532 --> 00:32:26,979
Scott: There's a real place right, you know?

430
00:32:28,025 --> 00:32:30,960
Scott: So it's like you want to open one of those?

431
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,262
Scott: well you know it's.

432
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:41,924
Scott: you got to do all the work of running a restaurant or Just be wealthy enough to buy to pay rent and buy food and have grandma's do all the work You know,

433
00:32:42,706 --> 00:32:49,926
Rym: I mean I would love to just retire and be like look I Run a nerdy bar Like that would be a really fun thing to do.

434
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:56,448
Rym: if that were somehow a sustainable achievable thing that would survive capitalism I would run a nerdy Jewish deli.

435
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:58,635
Rym: Oh, yeah, but t-pain did it.

436
00:32:58,756 --> 00:33:00,000
Rym: You hope he's open in his restaurant.

437
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,152
Rym: He's really excited about it, but he posted a photo to sugar.

438
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:04,156
Scott: Where is it?

439
00:33:04,217 --> 00:33:04,518
Scott: Can we go?

440
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:05,020
Scott: is in New York?

441
00:33:05,404 --> 00:33:07,970
Rym: I don't actually know California so we are.

442
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,959
Rym: so I have the key to it.

443
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:09,663
Rym: We could go.

444
00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:11,834
Rym: we could break in if we could just open the door.

445
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:13,717
Scott: He's changed the locks by now He hasn't yet.

446
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,776
Rym: So, uh, the story is when he tweeted about the fact that he's opening the restaurant.

447
00:33:19,357 --> 00:33:22,654
Rym: He posted a picture He was holding up the key like the master key to the building.

448
00:33:23,238 --> 00:33:25,706
Rym: now Nerds always especially lock picking.

449
00:33:25,726 --> 00:33:28,333
Rym: nerds always like to point out whenever someone does this.

450
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:30,640
Rym: Hey, someone could someone's gonna copy your key.

451
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,639
Rym: You're fucked and that is true.

452
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:39,380
Rym: But my thing of the day is a video that deviant olam a guy who's famous in the lock picking community.

453
00:33:39,883 --> 00:33:42,919
Rym: He's the guy who did those elevator hacking talks at conventions over the years.

454
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:55,319
Rym: This video is only six minutes long and he actually does make t-pain ski Directly, but he shows you Exactly step by step what it takes to do that.

455
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:56,868
Rym: Like every step.

456
00:33:56,888 --> 00:33:58,840
Scott: did he go to t-pain's restaurant and open the door?

457
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:01,999
Scott: He did not and he that would make an s-tier video.

458
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:08,610
Scott: I'm not saying go open the door just like, you know surreptitiously I'm saying like go there You know with t-pain in the video.

459
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,879
Scott: I'd be like hey t-pain watch this.

460
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,433
Rym: So and he posted this video and and then t-pain and that would.

461
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:16,500
Scott: and that video would help t-pain.

462
00:34:16,841 --> 00:34:21,739
Scott: Right, it recruit him to educate the people, you know to not take photos of keys.

463
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:27,167
Rym: So it looks like t-pain saw this video because he had a follow-up thread where he was like, yeah I saw like.

464
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,277
Rym: I saw I understand.

465
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,166
Rym: Alright, what are you gonna do?

466
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:33,260
Rym: break in and steal the bar stools that we're throwing away?

467
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,304
Rym: We're renovating the place.

468
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:35,915
Rym: Like I'm gonna change the locks guys.

469
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:41,213
Scott: I'm not stupid I'm just saying you know, you at least t-pain understands.

470
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:43,020
Scott: You shouldn't take photos of keys now.

471
00:34:43,141 --> 00:34:43,536
Scott: Yeah, right.

472
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:48,940
Rym: So the two things I will say is one watch the video because you know what tools you need to do this yourself.

473
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,127
Scott: website a blank key Something to grind away at it.

474
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:57,220
Rym: Oh, you can just buy a key punch like a stencil a piece of paper.

475
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,408
Scott: It's you know, it's way easier than that.

476
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,380
Rym: Yeah, he actually so deviant even like shares these things.

477
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:08,740
Rym: He just takes the photo into Photoshop and he has templates with vector graphics of lines for different kinds of keys.

478
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:10,827
Rym: He just lines it up on the photo.

479
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:13,515
Rym: It's really straightforward like, okay.

480
00:35:13,636 --> 00:35:14,739
Scott: Yeah, and they prints it out.

481
00:35:15,122 --> 00:35:16,091
Rym: Yep, you follow

482
00:35:16,111 --> 00:35:17,100
Scott: that if the pencil paper

483
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:20,450
Rym: Cuz keys are just passwords from the photo and

484
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:22,358
Scott: we just has the numbers and

485
00:35:22,378 --> 00:35:33,985
Rym: the templates It's really easy to figure out the numbers which are basically the password because a key like a residential key is Actually just a five or six digit Numerical password.

486
00:35:34,346 --> 00:35:38,820
Rym: your key to your house is literally just a basic ass password.

487
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:43,760
Rym: Yeah, that's why lock picking is so easy because they're just really simple passwords.

488
00:35:45,282 --> 00:35:52,339
Rym: So if you ever post a photo of your keys your dad is the equivalent of typing your password into Twitter and just hitting send.

489
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:59,120
Scott: If you find someone's keys and you want to share a photo of the keys to be like hey who lost their keys?

490
00:35:59,420 --> 00:35:59,996
Scott: Come and get them.

491
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:12,740
Scott: You should hold your fist over the bottom the spiky part of the keys and just show The key chains and the tops of the keys that you know where the the ring is and that would be enough for someone to identify.

492
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,784
Scott: That's my keychain.

493
00:36:13,824 --> 00:36:17,218
Scott: Those are my keys without revealing their actual keys.

494
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:22,740
Rym: Yep God, if I lost my keychain, that would be a big fucking problem because my yubi key is on the keychain.

495
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:24,646
Scott: I have two yubi keys.

496
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,280
Rym: I have one but then I have the backup codes for everything.

497
00:36:27,441 --> 00:36:30,552
Scott: But I have backup codes for everything also, but I put.

498
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,880
Scott: I put all everything I put on one yubi key.

499
00:36:32,981 --> 00:36:34,480
Scott: I also put on the other yubi key.

500
00:36:34,761 --> 00:36:36,410
Rym: I thought about doing that and then I didn't.

501
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,234
Rym: probably should.

502
00:36:37,254 --> 00:36:45,010
Rym: next time I do the refresh I probably will but that's why I made this my thing of the day because a lot of people talk about Copying keys from photos this video.

503
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:47,800
Rym: if you watch this video, you will literally be able to do it.

504
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,845
Rym: It is so easy and so simple.

505
00:36:50,326 --> 00:36:52,752
Rym: All you need is Photoshop or something.

506
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:54,596
Rym: That's Photoshop enough.

507
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,815
Rym: I Don't think you could do it in the GIMP that easily though.

508
00:36:57,876 --> 00:37:00,450
Rym: Honestly GIMP doesn't have layers the right way.

509
00:37:00,611 --> 00:37:01,919
Rym: Anyway, what do you got?

510
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,267
Scott: so We talked about the anime.

511
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:07,452
Scott: keep your hands off eyes.

512
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:07,713
Scott: Okay.

513
00:37:07,733 --> 00:37:08,616
Scott: There's also a manga.

514
00:37:09,138 --> 00:37:15,786
Scott: It's great And the opening song for that anime is easy breezy by Is it?

515
00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:36,563
Scott: I don't know if it's Chelmeko or Kelmeko but the group that made that song is called Chelmeko or Kelmeko because Right one of the persons in that group is Rachel And the other person in the group is Momiko, right?

516
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:39,110
Scott: So it's Rachel plus Momiko is.

517
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,320
Scott: I guess it must be Chel because it's Rachel right Chelmeko, right?

518
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:49,655
Scott: Anyway, I if that's your you know, only exposure to that musical group.

519
00:37:50,256 --> 00:38:01,160
Scott: Let me tell you right they are really something and What's even more than them being really good at music is their music videos are like S-tier music videos.

520
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,868
Scott: They're all have like these original.

521
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,319
Scott: even the easy breezy one is like it's really.

522
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,031
Scott: That is not the music video.

523
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:12,001
Rym: I expected to go to that song Easy.

524
00:38:12,743 --> 00:38:18,038
Scott: the easy breezy music video, you know, I think goes along really well with the the anime, right?

525
00:38:18,098 --> 00:38:18,700
Rym: Oh, absolutely.

526
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,470
Scott: But They have a new music video.

527
00:38:23,852 --> 00:38:29,587
Scott: it came out like Pretty recently, right like a couple weeks ago, I guess right?

528
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:31,790
Scott: I don't know how recently was it?

529
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:35,422
Scott: 29th.

530
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:40,373
Scott: Okay, sure And the song is may die may right?

531
00:38:40,594 --> 00:38:42,240
Scott: I hope I'm pronouncing that properly.

532
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:44,957
Scott: I don't know what the songs about.

533
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:48,126
Rym: I played it for a second.

534
00:38:48,146 --> 00:38:48,788
Rym: I had it muted.

535
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:52,820
Rym: So I thought I had assumed this was a music video to easy breezy.

536
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:55,639
Rym: I just saw the music video and I see that it is a different song.

537
00:38:56,742 --> 00:38:58,340
Scott: Now easy breezy is a different music.

538
00:38:58,521 --> 00:39:03,540
Rym: I clicked around in the video and I saw the images from the music video and I thought easy breezy what what?

539
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,469
Scott: What I see this is their new song.

540
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:07,252
Scott: This is not an old.

541
00:39:07,734 --> 00:39:09,180
Scott: Well, this isn't the newest song, right?

542
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:15,140
Scott: I mean, I guess it's the newest music video, but I've been hearing this song on Spotify for at least a while, right?

543
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:15,946
Scott: So it's not the.

544
00:39:16,107 --> 00:39:20,006
Scott: you know, it's not like the song just dropped Right, but the music video just dropped.

545
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:33,779
Scott: and the music video is extremely creative in that it's some sort of like Parody of like, you know horror movies, right and you know the song has verses right and you know verse chorus kind of structure.

546
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:38,292
Scott: and Every time the song comes around to the next, you know verse chorus.

547
00:39:38,714 --> 00:40:02,854
Scott: the music video sort of starts again But this time plays out similarly but differently and sort of a time loop sort of thing going on While keeping the horror theme and then on the final I think it does it two or three times and on the final one Obviously, it's very different right and that's you know, how things how you how stories are told How good stories are told.

548
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:04,463
Scott: so St.

549
00:40:04,543 --> 00:40:05,968
Scott: Music video we got here.

550
00:40:06,068 --> 00:40:17,413
Scott: I looked up the music video director and the only real information I could find about them was that they also were making the directing most of Kari Pommie Pommie's music videos.

551
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:35,684
Scott: So this is like, you know very prolific high quality Japanese music video director person, so Yeah, if you aren't checking out chamico, right Their music and music videos are really good Thing of the day worthy.

552
00:40:35,705 --> 00:40:37,811
Rym: All right in the meta moment.

553
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:40,399
Rym: The GeekNights book club book is nine Fox Gandit.

554
00:40:41,284 --> 00:40:42,555
Rym: We're gonna do the show within a month.

555
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,323
Rym: Cuz I'm Steamrolling through it.

556
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:47,446
Rym: It's real good.

557
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:54,878
Rym: It's a dense dense sci-fi with abstract concepts and violent calendars.

558
00:40:56,043 --> 00:40:57,859
Scott: No, the violent calendars have appeared.

559
00:40:58,361 --> 00:40:59,505
Rym: Oh the violent cow in.

560
00:40:59,645 --> 00:41:04,420
Rym: the violent calendars are referenced very early on but I did not a regular calendars.

561
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:07,700
Rym: I did not appreciate the extent of the violence of the calendar.

562
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:12,580
Scott: Yeah, calendars came up in like the first chapter, but you didn't realize the whole book was about calendars.

563
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:16,072
Scott: main focus of the book was calendars.

564
00:41:16,695 --> 00:41:17,839
Rym: Well, yeah, it's.

565
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:22,019
Rym: uh This book is real good to me.

566
00:41:22,722 --> 00:41:35,300
Rym: But my advice to you just like with the Prince of Nothing books If there's up too many proper nouns in a row Just go with it and it'll make more and more sense if you just keep reading.

567
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:42,119
Rym: But at least the characters are very straightforward in terms of who they are.

568
00:41:42,962 --> 00:41:50,209
Rym: Compared to the Prince of Nothing books were like one character has ten different names depending on who's talking about them And there were a few characters early on.

569
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,400
Rym: I wasn't didn't realize for the same character until later.

570
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,186
Rym: I did not have that problem with this book.

571
00:41:54,206 --> 00:41:58,060
Rym: This book is just dense sci-fi dense abstract and violence.

572
00:41:58,921 --> 00:42:01,737
Rym: Alright, definitely gonna read the rest of these books.

573
00:42:01,817 --> 00:42:06,971
Scott: I think In another meta moment if you're somehow not aware, right?

574
00:42:07,031 --> 00:42:15,246
Scott: We have a presence in many online places Even places that we don't actually Inhabit ourselves, right?

575
00:42:15,286 --> 00:42:19,440
Scott: We still have GeekNights still has a page or an account or a something, right?

576
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,231
Scott: It's like there's a GeekNights Facebook page and you know what.

577
00:42:22,713 --> 00:42:24,199
Scott: there they it was.

578
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:27,700
Scott: first We had a feature that was automatically posting episodes there.

579
00:42:28,221 --> 00:42:28,823
Scott: Then it broke.

580
00:42:29,225 --> 00:42:31,191
Scott: then I turned it off because it wasn't worth the effort.

581
00:42:31,653 --> 00:42:33,860
Scott: then Facebook added a podcast feature.

582
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,245
Scott: So I'm like, okay, why not?

583
00:42:35,325 --> 00:42:36,890
Scott: Here's our RSS feed Facebook.

584
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,920
Scott: Go ahead post our episodes on our page be my guest.

585
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:42,330
Scott: And now Facebook says guess what?

586
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:43,575
Scott: We're getting rid of the pot.

587
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:44,740
Scott: We failed at our podcast.

588
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:45,583
Scott: We're giving.

589
00:42:45,623 --> 00:42:49,435
Scott: we're giving up on that right Google style and we're getting rid of that feature.

590
00:42:49,475 --> 00:42:57,860
Scott: and I'm like, okay, so If Facebook is how you follow GeekNights, I'm sorry You might want to change to something else.

591
00:42:57,981 --> 00:43:05,540
Scott: I'm not gonna delete the page or my account But I never use it and I'm probably not gonna go and do something about this for a very long time.

592
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,700
Scott: It's like it's on my list, but it's like the last item on the list, right?

593
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:10,326
Scott: Yeah, we have an Instagram account.

594
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:14,340
Scott: We don't use it really right especially not without any conventions.

595
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,940
Rym: We got Twitter which we're outside of conventions pretty much just tells you when episodes are happening.

596
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:29,954
Scott: Yeah, you know we got accounts all over but the most interactive places are most happening of all places are our forum Which is on our website, which the website is being redone.

597
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,049
Scott: We're making a lot of progress imminently.

598
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:35,836
Scott: and The forum which is linked to the website.

599
00:43:35,856 --> 00:43:43,538
Scott: There's an old forum That's a read-only archive from back in the day but there's a current forum and is also a discord server that we have right.

600
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:50,018
Scott: so Join those places if you want to interact with us and you might see benefit from doing so.

601
00:43:50,118 --> 00:43:52,225
Scott: for example Listener.

602
00:43:52,245 --> 00:43:57,708
Scott: the only listener dazzle 369 I think is the numbers on there dazzle something.

603
00:43:58,129 --> 00:44:02,060
Scott: dazzle 369 gave us the idea for today's Thursday show.

604
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:04,319
Scott: We had no fucking idea for today's Thursday show.

605
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:08,132
Scott: We're probably close to bailing on it just because we didn't have an idea.

606
00:44:08,153 --> 00:44:19,320
Scott: and then we looked in our forum and we clicked on The ideas thread and we scrolled up and in July of last year Dazzle 369 suggested to do a show on swimming and swimming pools.

607
00:44:19,964 --> 00:44:22,340
Scott: That is a show that we can do with no research.

608
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:34,440
Scott: It is something that where we definitely have 20 to 30 minutes of material to discuss Without preparation and we have not done a show on that already and therefore it is prime material for a show.

609
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:35,686
Scott: So that's what we're gonna do.

610
00:44:35,786 --> 00:44:38,700
Rym: We do have a plan for a future show while we're in the metamoment before we get into it.

611
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:53,239
Rym: So I'm just gonna ask all of you if Scott and I were to at some point in the nearing future rewatch an old James Bond movie that we probably only saw on TV with ads as kids and have not watched since

612
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,548
Scott: and Might have been censored even who knows for TV, right?

613
00:44:56,588 --> 00:44:58,815
Scott: Like what aspect ratio it for TV?

614
00:44:59,316 --> 00:45:00,700
Rym: what James Bond movie?

615
00:45:01,442 --> 00:45:06,655
Rym: Would you want us to both watch with modern adult eyes and do a review of?

616
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:07,617
Rym: I'm just curious.

617
00:45:07,918 --> 00:45:15,440
Rym: if anyone has strong Preferences they're not even gonna tell you which ones I've seen recently and which ones I haven't because I'm just curious which ones you recommend.

618
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:18,549
Scott: We did a show on James Bond show recently.

619
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:19,754
Rym: We did so.

620
00:45:19,914 --> 00:45:23,520
Rym: you can get a sense of our sensibilities around James Bond.

621
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:32,300
Rym: you know that I'm a I'm a big Daniel Craig fan and it's not gonna be one of those because I've seen all of those and With I guess two of them are great.

622
00:45:33,641 --> 00:45:34,665
Rym: Anyway, maybe three.

623
00:45:34,685 --> 00:45:36,692
Scott: Let's talk about swimming and swimming pools.

624
00:45:36,873 --> 00:45:44,800
Scott: So I lived a very Swim privileged youth Oh sent white middle-class living in a suburb.

625
00:45:45,021 --> 00:45:47,060
Rym: We both had a very similar upbringing in this regard.

626
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,100
Scott: It was a you know, I guess I was born in New York City.

627
00:45:50,201 --> 00:45:53,280
Scott: But then you know, you know, I guess then my parents we moved to Connecticut.

628
00:45:53,443 --> 00:45:57,130
Scott: But then this you know House we moved into after like when I was.

629
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:03,108
Scott: I guess maybe two or three two or three Is still the house my mom lives in today.

630
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:17,740
Scott: and that house had an above-ground pool in it when we moved into it And that pool was not torn down until after the children had gone to college and such and no one was using it anymore And it was just a pain in the ass to maintain and it was taking up space in the backyard.

631
00:46:17,961 --> 00:46:19,546
Scott: So the kid I don't vary.

632
00:46:19,607 --> 00:46:45,918
Scott: and in addition in addition to that pool that was in my own backyard We would frequently in the summer Right go to the town public pool that you could only park your car at if you had a sticker that proved You lived in the town and you had a driver's license that Indicated you lived in the town and aren't the town we lived in the suburban town Had like two or three such public pools to go to.

633
00:46:45,938 --> 00:46:49,538
Scott: yeah And on top of that, right?

634
00:46:50,883 --> 00:46:54,160
Scott: The town also had a leak that nowadays you can't swim in that lake anymore.

635
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,456
Scott: It's but it you could when when I was a kid.

636
00:46:56,476 --> 00:47:02,959
Scott: That's Yeah, and then well, I think it overrun by algaes and you know all kinds of climate change.

637
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:14,088
Scott: Yeah, and then on top of all that I frequently attended summer camps and various summer programs and went on Vacations to beaches and things of that nature.

638
00:47:14,229 --> 00:47:15,674
Scott: and it's you go to a summer camp.

639
00:47:15,734 --> 00:47:17,059
Scott: It's like you're swimming every day.

640
00:47:17,862 --> 00:47:23,340
Scott: It's like even if you went to summer camp at the YMCA that the you know at the Jewish Community Center in town.

641
00:47:23,682 --> 00:47:26,560
Scott: It's like swimming was a daily activity there, right?

642
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,363
Scott: For everybody.

643
00:47:28,665 --> 00:47:38,306
Rym: so my house was similar, but we were you know in Detroit We did not have a pool because our backyard was about the size of the room I'm recording GeekNights in right now.

644
00:47:38,326 --> 00:47:40,113
Rym: Like it was a tiny house in Detroit.

645
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:42,791
Rym: In fact, it was so tiny There was no grass.

646
00:47:42,831 --> 00:47:43,459
Rym: It was pea gravel.

647
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:50,732
Rym: When we moved to the suburbs One of the first things my parents saved up for it.

648
00:47:50,773 --> 00:47:52,500
Rym: It was a big goddamn deal.

649
00:47:53,124 --> 00:48:03,806
Rym: We got a small above-ground pool But one of those ones that has like the metal sides like a really really like built up one and We were obsessed with it.

650
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:07,100
Rym: We swam in it all the time, but it wasn't really a pool you could swim in.

651
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,259
Rym: It was just like a kid jump around.

652
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:10,584
Scott: See ours was.

653
00:48:10,745 --> 00:48:12,471
Scott: ours was the same kind of construction.

654
00:48:12,531 --> 00:48:12,852
Scott: is that?

655
00:48:12,912 --> 00:48:15,060
Scott: you know, it's four feet deep metal sides, right?

656
00:48:15,502 --> 00:48:18,580
Scott: But you could swim in it like around in a circle, right?

657
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:24,384
Scott: But mostly what I would do is come home from school or whatever Yep, splash it.

658
00:48:24,424 --> 00:48:26,510
Scott: Yeah, please all get your.

659
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:30,200
Scott: you know, super soaker battles in there, you know pool basketball.

660
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:33,910
Rym: We would jump out of the garage into it when our parents weren't watching.

661
00:48:34,821 --> 00:48:41,018
Scott: it wasn't close ours wasn't close enough to the house for jumping but our A Family friend's house.

662
00:48:41,098 --> 00:48:50,737
Scott: They also had a similar pool and They had one of those, you know decks those porches because it was one of those You know Right the houses that were like the.

663
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:55,410
Scott: the land they were on was high in the front and sloped downwards in the back.

664
00:48:55,911 --> 00:49:02,589
Scott: So the porch was you know, like, you know, even though it was at the same level as the first floor It was like a ranch with a basement.

665
00:49:03,354 --> 00:49:06,370
Scott: You know, the basement was just like it's in the back of the house.

666
00:49:06,831 --> 00:49:12,470
Scott: You could just walk right out, right, you know straight with a normal door, you know, and the porch was above that.

667
00:49:13,011 --> 00:49:19,290
Scott: So in the backyard, the porch was real high up and they they they basically had the porch.

668
00:49:19,411 --> 00:49:29,880
Scott: They built it outwards to go down to the pool so you could get to the pool without having to go on to the ground and Then that provided many opportunities for jumping.

669
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,706
Rym: We had nothing like that because it wasn't really the burbs.

670
00:49:31,766 --> 00:49:33,969
Scott: many many opportunities Jumping into that pool.

671
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:42,170
Rym: This was actually like One of those old brick row houses like in the outer rings around Detroit like in Grosse Pointe Park like that kind of place.

672
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,905
Rym: So the pool was illegal because it was too close to the garage.

673
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:47,170
Rym: It was too close to the house.

674
00:49:47,471 --> 00:49:48,453
Rym: It was too close to the problem.

675
00:49:48,574 --> 00:49:54,529
Rym: Every side of this thing was illegal in some fashion, but who's gonna do anything about it?

676
00:49:54,709 --> 00:50:06,735
Rym: So but Most of my swimming swimming was another thing that white middle-class kids, especially in the Midwest do is Get swimming lessons.

677
00:50:06,755 --> 00:50:10,284
Rym: a lot of schools just have pools and it's just a class.

678
00:50:10,485 --> 00:50:12,470
Rym: Sometimes it's not even like you're forced to.

679
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:13,556
Scott: Yeah, it's swimming lessons.

680
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:14,985
Scott: So many times right?

681
00:50:15,025 --> 00:50:20,246
Scott: Not only did we have Swimming lessons at the public pool swimming lessons at the summer camps.

682
00:50:20,326 --> 00:50:21,068
Scott: Oh, that's it, right?

683
00:50:21,129 --> 00:50:26,120
Rym: It's like I Learned like full formal swimming.

684
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,526
Rym: We had to do races in the classes.

685
00:50:28,606 --> 00:50:41,806
Rym: Like I know a bunch of strokes Like swimming was just this assumed thing and being a privileged middle-class white kid at the time I didn't realize that not everyone learns how to swim when I was a kid.

686
00:50:41,826 --> 00:50:46,903
Rym: I Just assumed like that everyone knew how to swim and I remember I was.

687
00:50:46,963 --> 00:50:49,652
Scott: I was getting swimming lessons with all the kids I knew.

688
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:54,276
Scott: yeah, it's like something like I didn't feel like anyone wasn't getting them But actually no a lot of people.

689
00:50:54,316 --> 00:50:57,430
Scott: just you know, it's like wait a minute now that I think about it.

690
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:04,610
Scott: It's like yeah, there were this many kids in school But when I went to the public pool only some percentage of those kids were coming to the pool.

691
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:05,867
Scott: The rest of them were somewhere else.

692
00:51:06,451 --> 00:51:11,830
Rym: And it wasn't until middle school when I went to some friends house because they had a. they had an in-ground pool.

693
00:51:12,212 --> 00:51:15,769
Rym: Like they were the richest people I could imagine when I was in middle school.

694
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:20,153
Rym: So, uh, you know, they just had a nice house but they had a like a smallish in-ground pool.

695
00:51:20,574 --> 00:51:29,450
Rym: and I remember going to a birthday party at this house in like sixth grade and A bunch of the kids like wouldn't get in the pool because it had a deep end.

696
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,935
Rym: they just like would not get in.

697
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:42,300
Rym: and I started to realize really quickly that a lot of those kids like Just couldn't like if you threw them in they would just think to the bottom and die Like they could not even keep their head above water if they were.

698
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,146
Scott: why we put fences around pools?

699
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:56,309
Rym: because people die and in my subdivision Multiple kids died because they would break into other families houses Like they break into other families backyards swim in the pool and drown.

700
00:51:57,393 --> 00:52:04,990
Rym: That happened multiple times when I was a kid Yeah, and the homeowners got sued because anyway, that's a whole separate conversation.

701
00:52:05,552 --> 00:52:08,022
Rym: But that was the moment I started to.

702
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:16,350
Rym: that was one of the first times I started to internalize How radically different some aspects of my childhood were from the average childhood in America.

703
00:52:16,952 --> 00:52:22,970
Scott: Yeah, I mean the answer right and then we can just talk about water anecdotes after this, right?

704
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:31,210
Scott: But the answer is that obviously Swimming lessons should be as mandatory as math lessons for all humans in the society, right?

705
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:34,657
Rym: Every majority of the have enough money to have a pool.

706
00:52:34,958 --> 00:52:42,360
Scott: if a spot majority We're not putting enough money into that public school or you could take the kids to the town pool or whatever, right?

707
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:48,500
Scott: It's like doesn't matter your town, you know There should be a pool close enough to where everyone has pool access no matter where they live, right?

708
00:52:49,822 --> 00:52:52,259
Scott: As long as he's not in a drought place, but that's a waste of water.

709
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:56,394
Scott: But it's like, you know, most of the earth is covered in water.

710
00:52:56,816 --> 00:53:10,324
Scott: unless you live in Oklahoma And never leave you're in your life you are likely to encounter a body of water right intentionally or unintentionally and You should.

711
00:53:10,404 --> 00:53:18,440
Scott: it's like yeah, you know since I left, you know The suburbs it went to college the swimming opportunities have been much less.

712
00:53:18,521 --> 00:53:20,839
Scott: It's pretty much like when I can go to the beach and that's it.

713
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,602
Rym: Oh, yeah, like why?

714
00:53:21,622 --> 00:53:23,347
Rym: like watch me or Scott's swimming today.

715
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:26,677
Rym: Our form is atrocious our speed.

716
00:53:26,697 --> 00:53:34,830
Scott: I pretty much Yeah, I pretty much swim at the beach in a relaxing swim to stay afloat and not die and that's that's the level of swim I have now.

717
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:47,460
Scott: right but You know, it's like I don't drown if I go in the water But I still know how to swim if I fell off a boat and I didn't you know And it wasn't like a mega boat where I die hitting the water or something, right?

718
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:55,583
Scott: It's like I could probably I give a fell out of rowboat or a kayak I could get back in or you in the very least you could tread water until you got help Or I could.

719
00:53:55,985 --> 00:53:56,186
Scott: I could.

720
00:53:56,327 --> 00:53:58,860
Scott: if I can't get back in the boat I could get near it and hold on to it.

721
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:09,909
Rym: Yeah I think I think any like you me Emily like most of like we could all if we had to we could probably swim across the East River like if there's like not that I want to At the problem the distance.

722
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:12,380
Scott: I think I could make it with difficulty.

723
00:54:13,002 --> 00:54:23,482
Scott: I think the problem is that depending on you know, assuming that where you land on either side you is like, you know I'm assuming I'm gonna be Flat.

724
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,766
Scott: Yeah, it's a flat wall And then you had the current I'd.

725
00:54:26,967 --> 00:54:36,118
Scott: if I tried to swim across the East River from where I live in Queens I'd probably I'd be lucky if I didn't go past the bottom of Manhattan by the time I got across right.

726
00:54:36,138 --> 00:54:41,627
Scott: but in terms of The difference I think you could do if I don't if I don't make it to the battery It's like I can't make it to Jersey.

727
00:54:41,647 --> 00:54:43,494
Scott: It's like I bet I'd be screwed.

728
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:44,096
Scott: I'd maybe I get.

729
00:54:44,317 --> 00:54:45,697
Scott: maybe it would push me to Staten Island.

730
00:54:46,704 --> 00:54:47,556
Scott: There is a beach there.

731
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:49,585
Rym: Well one to one.

732
00:54:49,605 --> 00:54:52,157
Rym: thing though that I think a lot of people don't super realize is

733
00:54:53,801 --> 00:54:54,703
Scott: Swimming fast

734
00:54:54,883 --> 00:55:10,803
Rym: is takes a lot of practice and skill and physicality and it's really good exercise and it's hard but knowing how to swim enough to Tread water not drown and slowly make your way in a particular direction That

735
00:55:10,903 --> 00:55:11,024
Scott: is

736
00:55:11,706 --> 00:55:13,171
Rym: one day's worth of instruction.

737
00:55:13,391 --> 00:55:15,980
Scott: It is not hard depends depends on the person.

738
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,492
Rym: Yeah, unless you have some people got some.

739
00:55:18,512 --> 00:55:20,200
Scott: some people have aqua phobia, right?

740
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,185
Scott: You know, they have issues.

741
00:55:21,246 --> 00:55:32,986
Rym: some people's bodies are different, you know There's nothing physical preventing you from doing it and there's nothing psychological or otherwise preventing you from doing it reasonably healthy reasonably fit.

742
00:55:33,527 --> 00:55:37,479
Rym: the motions like the mechanics of it come pretty much just come down to.

743
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:44,980
Rym: You're sort of moving your arms left and right when angling your hands and that's pushing water down keeping you up and your legs.

744
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:45,924
Rym: You're just kind of kicking them.

745
00:55:46,286 --> 00:55:49,580
Rym: Just kick them a little bit and that'll keep my head above water, right?

746
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:57,849
Scott: It's like, you know, it's the thing is right is every human who has legs at work You know learns to walk right, you know.

747
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:00,917
Scott: somewhat somewhat sort of without really even any instruction.

748
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:02,020
Scott: so much, you know.

749
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:10,692
Rym: I mean horses come out walking Immediately, but some babies also come out Naturally being able to swim like they will kind of just swim.

750
00:56:10,712 --> 00:56:12,740
Rym: They'll keep their heads above water when they get older.

751
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:18,115
Scott: They lose that right, but the you know, there's swimming, you know, this.

752
00:56:18,155 --> 00:56:22,840
Scott: we need swimming lessons because You know, you're not swimming constantly, right?

753
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,040
Scott: You're not in the water every day unless you live in like a fishing village or something, right?

754
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,100
Scott: Where you probably don't need swimming.

755
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:42,120
Rym: But also the mechanics of swimming with speed are not actually intuitive to just a human who doesn't have specialized knowledge Right, but the thing is, you know, right it swimming with speed is like running, right?

756
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,434
Scott: It's like you you don't need to do that.

757
00:56:44,555 --> 00:56:45,440
Scott: Actually, right?

758
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:51,264
Scott: it's like this kind of swimming lessons you got are basically teaching you to walk in the Right.

759
00:56:51,344 --> 00:56:54,058
Scott: It's like to walk in water not on water like Jesus.

760
00:56:54,158 --> 00:56:54,520
Scott: in water.

761
00:56:54,801 --> 00:57:07,400
Scott: We got we got all we went from basically walking like you like if you are in a free in a in a body of water Submerged and not holding on to any objects and you're not near any surface, you know, can you move around?

762
00:57:08,122 --> 00:57:10,110
Scott: According to your will at any speed?

763
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:15,978
Scott: right walking in the you know in water That's that's the kind of swimming that everyone needs to learn.

764
00:57:16,038 --> 00:57:22,046
Rym: Yep I mean what I can do like I can do like most of the basic front strokes I can do the backstroke really easily.

765
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:25,759
Rym: I can I can do a really shitty looking breaststroke, but like it works.

766
00:57:27,024 --> 00:57:31,219
Scott: dog paddle, of course Yeah, that's a dog paddles enough, you know.

767
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:37,645
Scott: Yeah, just can you get in a body of water and enjoy it and not die Danger to yourself and others.

768
00:57:37,685 --> 00:57:51,960
Rym: when I think back to my young childhood like early like kindergarten early to mid-elementary school Video games were a big part of my life, obviously Anime was a big part of my life at that time obvious like it later like as well like fourth grade onward.

769
00:57:52,562 --> 00:58:02,993
Rym: but the two things that I was sort of I guess three things that was sort of the most obsessed with as in Activities I wanted to do every day, but could not do every day.

770
00:58:03,053 --> 00:58:10,600
Rym: We're in order one ride rollercoaster Yeah to be in a big pool with a deep end.

771
00:58:13,861 --> 00:58:20,025
Scott: That's the thing is like if I think about you know, what was I interested in when I was you know At any any age right?

772
00:58:20,066 --> 00:58:22,011
Scott: What were my hobbies and primary interests?

773
00:58:22,473 --> 00:58:24,800
Scott: swimming never makes the list ever, right?

774
00:58:25,082 --> 00:58:26,600
Scott: It's like, you know, what did I care most about?

775
00:58:27,501 --> 00:58:27,803
Rym: More like.

776
00:58:27,884 --> 00:58:30,500
Rym: I want to be in a deep pool because there's lots of fun things.

777
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:39,320
Scott: Swimming was never the primary interest even if you asked me at the time I was swimming the most like what my favorite thing was like video games.

778
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,740
Scott: It's like swimming would never come up right?

779
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,819
Scott: But if you would ask me what would you like to do right now?

780
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,271
Scott: Right and swimming in the pool was an option.

781
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:51,760
Scott: It would frequently make the top of the list.

782
00:58:52,463 --> 00:59:02,560
Rym: When we had an above-ground pool as small and crappy as it was Every single day after school, I would come home and just like put in my swimsuit and jump in the pool like immediately.

783
00:59:02,821 --> 00:59:06,254
Scott: Yep, on the home Saturday home from school is the forget.

784
00:59:06,274 --> 00:59:07,800
Scott: home from school is the pool open?

785
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:09,030
Scott: Yeah, is the pool ready?

786
00:59:09,393 --> 00:59:10,140
Scott: is the weather good?

787
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:13,800
Scott: I'm going to be in the pool until dinnertime and possibly after dinner.

788
00:59:13,921 --> 00:59:17,899
Rym: Yep, my friends might just show up and get in the pool with me and we're gonna play tag in the pool.

789
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,166
Scott: Say it's walking around the neighborhood.

790
00:59:20,186 --> 00:59:21,631
Scott: Hey who wants to come in the pool?

791
00:59:21,832 --> 00:59:22,956
Rym: Yep Saturday morning.

792
00:59:23,016 --> 00:59:40,852
Rym: I'd eat my frosted flakes I'd watch some cartoons open and I would be watching out the window Waiting watching to wait for my dad to get up Go outside and do the pH test and the chlorine stuff and come back and say it's okay to go in the pool And that would drop everything and go jump in the pool.

793
00:59:41,254 --> 00:59:41,556
Scott: Did that?

794
00:59:41,596 --> 00:59:42,280
Scott: did that all myself?

795
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,695
Rym: I started doing that when I was older, but our parents did it when I was in like first grade.

796
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:50,272
Scott: All right, so Anecdotes of things that happened while swimming.

797
00:59:50,332 --> 01:00:01,360
Scott: so at the town pool Right when the town pool that we had was an L shaped pool Oh fancy that the long part of the L had obviously lanes, right?

798
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:08,895
Scott: And then the the the curved part was like a little square Right and it got deeper as it went.

799
01:00:09,136 --> 01:00:13,412
Scott: as the long part The shallowest part was the farthest away from the square right.

800
01:00:13,793 --> 01:00:15,720
Scott: as you went down the lane it got deeper.

801
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:29,820
Scott: But in the square right there's a rope separating the square of the L from the long part of the L. That was the mega deep end right like, you know, like way deep right and that was the basically the diving area.

802
01:00:29,981 --> 01:00:32,978
Scott: There was a regular old springboard like you do.

803
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:34,766
Rym: Oh, did you have an actual high dive?

804
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,860
Scott: and then there was the high dive?

805
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,620
Rym: I assume it's liability reasons why those are gone.

806
01:00:40,681 --> 01:00:47,420
Rym: But as a kid Diving was my favorite thing and that's why I was so obsessed with the deep pools because I couldn't dive at home.

807
01:00:47,461 --> 01:00:51,750
Scott: That would literally kill me Yep, and then there was the high dive.

808
01:00:51,911 --> 01:00:54,240
Scott: So, you know, I ever jump off it.

809
01:00:55,243 --> 01:00:58,130
Scott: At the time that the high dive was in operation.

810
01:00:58,151 --> 01:01:01,600
Scott: I was not yet old enough to go on the high.

811
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:07,433
Rym: I went up there when I wasn't Right off of that thing before anyone could stop me as a kid.

812
01:01:07,854 --> 01:01:09,380
Scott: I was still doing the low dive.

813
01:01:09,601 --> 01:01:18,697
Scott: I was not allowed to do the high dive but at this time that the high dive still existed The pool was like super popular right and all kinds of people.

814
01:01:18,737 --> 01:01:19,280
Scott: it was busy.

815
01:01:19,561 --> 01:01:23,093
Scott: There's a kiddie pool off to the side also, but it was popular and busy right.

816
01:01:23,494 --> 01:01:28,660
Scott: and the bet the funnest times Were you think when they call adult swim?

817
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:32,280
Scott: That's not the fun time when you're a kid because that means get out of the pool, right?

818
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:53,986
Scott: But actually the tap the pool was so busy and popular that during adult swim the kids would go to the deep end diving pool area and we'd sit on the the edge of the pool with our feet in the water right next to the high dive and Basically all the biggest dudes in town Would come and cannonball.

819
01:01:54,267 --> 01:02:05,091
Scott: Yeah, like a cannonball contest like every day in the summer Right and we'll be all like get us wet Even though they were diving so far away from us.

820
01:02:05,111 --> 01:02:08,489
Scott: Yeah, right we would get mighty wet When these kids.

821
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:09,457
Scott: it was, you know.

822
01:02:10,362 --> 01:02:15,680
Scott: But then over time it was sad because a the high dive went away and was replaced with the second low dive.

823
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,232
Rym: Yep, so I found a whole bunch of articles talking about.

824
01:02:18,513 --> 01:02:22,048
Rym: there are a lot of people ask this question Why did all the high dives disappear?

825
01:02:22,088 --> 01:02:22,791
Rym: What the fuck they were.

826
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:24,840
Rym: ability when I was a kid another all gone.

827
01:02:25,482 --> 01:02:26,846
Scott: People got hurt actually.

828
01:02:27,127 --> 01:02:31,460
Rym: No, that doesn't seem to be the main reason people were not getting heart at a high rate.

829
01:02:32,042 --> 01:02:36,640
Scott: I mean, I never saw anyone get hurt, but I assumed there was liability reasons and people were getting hurt.

830
01:02:36,701 --> 01:02:46,935
Rym: so it seems like they're actually very safe and Most of the reason they went away was a fear of people getting hurt.

831
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:48,460
Rym: That was mostly unfounded.

832
01:02:49,641 --> 01:03:05,008
Rym: Aha the other part of it is that New safety regulations came in place in a lot of places Where insurers would say oh if you got a high dive, you can't just have a teenager's your lifeguard You need a certified diving instructor.

833
01:03:05,409 --> 01:03:07,255
Rym: and every pool said well fuck that.

834
01:03:07,596 --> 01:03:10,046
Rym: I'm not paying more than minimum wage Yep.

835
01:03:10,229 --> 01:03:10,472
Scott: Yep.

836
01:03:10,513 --> 01:03:16,723
Rym: Yep It's kind of hard to hurt yourself off a high dive if you're the kind of person who would jump off a high dive in The first place.

837
01:03:16,743 --> 01:03:27,460
Scott: I mean the real danger of the high dive is, you know Besides the drowning if you can't swim or maybe landing on someone kids are fucking around under it, right landing on someone.

838
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:32,797
Scott: Somehow be you know, the dive causes you to lose consciousness or get disoriented and then you drown.

839
01:03:32,817 --> 01:03:39,219
Scott: or Hitting the board itself right with your jump is the other major danger.

840
01:03:40,502 --> 01:03:45,164
Scott: Or slipping and falling off of the board like sideways or something I did see.

841
01:03:45,184 --> 01:03:50,522
Scott: a lot of people fuck but it's sticking out so far into the water and it's the water is so deep You're still just.

842
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:51,146
Scott: you're not gonna.

843
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:53,760
Scott: you're not gonna like hit the concrete, you know when you fall off.

844
01:03:54,762 --> 01:03:56,651
Rym: So Olympic coaches are actually.

845
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,600
Rym: I found an article on Weibo talking about this.

846
01:03:59,082 --> 01:04:10,800
Rym: They're all kind of mad and there's a bunch of anecdotes of them saying yeah It really hurt diving as a sport because when the high dives disappeared, nobody got interested in diving Or we couldn't find any divers.

847
01:04:11,963 --> 01:04:16,620
Scott: The thing is I always assumed that you know, the high dives are removed from the public pools.

848
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:26,020
Scott: But I assumed that like people who are swimming seriously for sport Like those those pools still have all kinds of dives the mega high dives.

849
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:28,830
Rym: it seems like it was more that it meant.

850
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:35,133
Rym: most people never encountered a high dive and Thus didn't think about it and didn't like try to learn how to.

851
01:04:35,173 --> 01:04:38,172
Scott: but if you're a kid who goes to a swim meet You're then you're gonna see one.

852
01:04:38,193 --> 01:04:38,840
Scott: you're gonna say, you know what?

853
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,973
Scott: Maybe I'll try that instead of swimming back and forth.

854
01:04:41,195 --> 01:04:43,287
Rym: true the kid But the kid who's going to the swim meet?

855
01:04:43,388 --> 01:04:44,273
Scott: probably definitely.

856
01:04:44,394 --> 01:04:50,080
Scott: if I had ever, you know If I had ever done competitive swimming, which I never did even one time ever, right?

857
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,269
Scott: I probably would have chosen the diving over the swimming back and forth.

858
01:04:54,493 --> 01:05:03,120
Rym: as a kid when I got to a pool that had diving Boards, all I would do is dive over and over again until my parents said we had to go like that was what I would do.

859
01:05:03,642 --> 01:05:06,872
Rym: I actually was pretty good at diving - roller coaster adjacent.

860
01:05:06,912 --> 01:05:07,775
Scott: I would just do cannonballs.

861
01:05:07,815 --> 01:05:09,180
Scott: I wasn't trying to dive correctly.

862
01:05:09,403 --> 01:05:10,500
Rym: Well, I had a lot of goals.

863
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:16,420
Rym: I would have tried to dive and touch the bottom with my hand and then swim back up or I would try to do that.

864
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,759
Rym: We do that dive and swim as far as I could.

865
01:05:19,822 --> 01:05:27,065
Scott: We would throw things into the pool that sank to the bottom and then you would dive at the same time And try to grab.

866
01:05:27,085 --> 01:05:29,515
Scott: this is when there were two low dives because they obviously not work.

867
01:05:29,575 --> 01:05:31,143
Scott: if they one was high one was Yeah, right.

868
01:05:31,686 --> 01:05:32,631
Scott: So you somewhat you'd.

869
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,340
Scott: you'd both be standing on the low dive.

870
01:05:34,821 --> 01:05:40,519
Scott: Someone on the side would throw something right and then you would both jump and see who came out with it.

871
01:05:41,424 --> 01:05:43,360
Scott: It's like if you didn't get it on its way down.

872
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:47,879
Scott: You'd have to go come back up for air and dive again to go to the bottom and get it.

873
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:59,970
Rym: but to use a diving board correctly does require a Tiny amount of instruction because there is a specific technique to a springy diving board and most of the people who fall off of it Don't realize that.

874
01:06:00,595 --> 01:06:01,321
Scott: well, you know There's.

875
01:06:01,762 --> 01:06:03,208
Scott: I think you don't need much technique.

876
01:06:03,268 --> 01:06:12,184
Rym: if your technique is stand at the end and go and jump Yeah, but you know if you want to run head first or you're gonna take a step and jump Yeah, you got it.

877
01:06:12,204 --> 01:06:14,059
Rym: You gotta get a little tiny bit.

878
01:06:14,701 --> 01:06:15,447
Scott: Well, I think it was.

879
01:06:15,467 --> 01:06:27,313
Scott: you know as it was I would when I would do it I would think about it in sort of a video game sort of way and that like I'm running and I need to jump like Mario and I need to land exactly on that spot at the end, right?

880
01:06:27,694 --> 01:06:37,820
Scott: So it's like it was about timing and Spacing out the one jump so that I would land in the right spot And then once I landed in the right spot, it's like the rest is or automatic, right?

881
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,131
Scott: It's like it Springs you into the air and you'd be going the water.

882
01:06:40,412 --> 01:06:41,015
Rym: Yeah.

883
01:06:41,136 --> 01:06:48,900
Rym: Oh, yeah the coach is saying here The big problem is nobody gets the three meter training or the experience with it when they're very young.

884
01:06:49,361 --> 01:06:55,439
Rym: So they first encounter it when they're older and that seems to have impacted the skill development of divers.

885
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:04,120
Scott: Listener from other country tell us if you're not United States country still has high dives at the public town pools and such.

886
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:10,198
Rym: Yeah, I'm really curious because everything I'm reading digging around a ton of articles People were not getting hurt on these things.

887
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:16,653
Rym: Anyway, anyway the list others swimming it is dazzle 369 in the chat.

888
01:07:17,014 --> 01:07:17,977
Rym: What about pool toys?

889
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:19,983
Scott: Oh Well, I'm full.

890
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:23,720
Scott: total noodle was invented in my lifetime.

891
01:07:23,803 --> 01:07:25,024
Rym: Yeah We did not have.

892
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:31,300
Scott: I remember a time where our pool did not have Noodles and then they invented the pool noodle and then we had many.

893
01:07:31,601 --> 01:07:34,653
Rym: So we had the toys of dive in and get stuff off the bottom like we talked about.

894
01:07:34,713 --> 01:07:40,419
Rym: but the favorite toys Were the inner tubes and the giant alligator with the handles on it.

895
01:07:41,002 --> 01:07:42,430
Scott: You mean shark with handles on it.

896
01:07:42,651 --> 01:07:47,606
Rym: alligator was way better because it was flatter Animal with handles on it.

897
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:56,120
Rym: pretty much we would we would play tag of Multiple alligators and you're trying to like tag people and jump across them and not fall in the water.

898
01:07:56,641 --> 01:07:57,383
Rym: We just have.

899
01:07:57,965 --> 01:08:00,411
Rym: we just throw rocks at each other from the alligators.

900
01:08:01,053 --> 01:08:03,760
Scott: I already mentioned the basketball and pool basketball, right?

901
01:08:04,102 --> 01:08:07,844
Scott: We didn't have a water polo set up or a pool volleyball set up But some people did.

902
01:08:07,864 --> 01:08:15,560
Rym: one of my favorite things to do with Cub Scouts was to go to the Days Inn Because you could just rent the pools out at them and play water volleyball.

903
01:08:16,241 --> 01:08:25,136
Scott: Actually water a lot of towns will have like a racquet club or you know Something like that and those places will often have a pools with like, you know water polo water.

904
01:08:25,156 --> 01:08:29,050
Rym: pretty much every YMCA Has a water volleyball set up too.

905
01:08:29,752 --> 01:08:30,576
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

906
01:08:30,997 --> 01:08:33,819
Scott: That's a real Yeah, it's good.

907
01:08:33,941 --> 01:08:39,889
Scott: I know a lot of old people that play and they just sort of play it casually like, you know The same way that like old people are playing pickleball these days

908
01:08:40,291 --> 01:08:45,817
Rym: and the way and sometimes I remember one days in they had it set up where One side was just in the deep end.

909
01:08:46,241 --> 01:08:58,546
Rym: So basically that was how you could get Little kids like us to play against adults is the adults will have to tread water in the deep end and the kids are just like in the shallow end Mm-hmm.

910
01:08:58,586 --> 01:09:03,881
Scott: Yeah other pool toys beside me the super soaker really was more of a pool like as much of a pool toy as it Wasn't.

911
01:09:03,921 --> 01:09:04,768
Scott: oh, yeah, it was.

912
01:09:04,787 --> 01:09:06,500
Rym: we just have them floating around in the pool with us.

913
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,787
Scott: Sometimes you had the little kick boards.

914
01:09:08,929 --> 01:09:09,933
Scott: kick boards are fun.

915
01:09:09,953 --> 01:09:10,254
Scott: He though.

916
01:09:10,274 --> 01:09:11,800
Scott: They're mostly instructional, right?

917
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:14,267
Scott: They're still fun because one board is just like.

918
01:09:14,287 --> 01:09:17,457
Scott: ah my arms they can rest for an above-ground pool.

919
01:09:17,577 --> 01:09:29,455
Rym: I think a very common activity was using the pool itself as a toy and what we'd always do is we'd get a bunch of kids in the pool and Start walking around the edge until we got.

920
01:09:29,475 --> 01:09:30,420
Scott: oh, I forgot all about that.

921
01:09:30,581 --> 01:09:31,645
Scott: Yes, we did that too.

922
01:09:32,106 --> 01:09:35,700
Rym: And you could you could actually like if you've never done that even enough.

923
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:36,407
Rym: Yeah, you could.

924
01:09:36,528 --> 01:09:37,760
Scott: I could do it just by myself.

925
01:09:37,861 --> 01:09:44,680
Scott: I would run around the pool in a circle and then turn around and you try to fight against it Yeah, or you just ride it around on the alligator.

926
01:09:46,585 --> 01:09:48,560
Scott: We but I got all about that, but we did that a lot.

927
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,703
Rym: Yeah, it was.

928
01:09:49,723 --> 01:09:56,986
Rym: it was surprising how big of a whirlpool you could get going with a bunch of kids in a little pool Worked at.

929
01:09:57,006 --> 01:10:01,464
Scott: hey, you could definitely get a. you know You know.

930
01:10:01,584 --> 01:10:05,817
Rym: Odyssean level whirlpool scale is there in the middle and Charybdis?

931
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:11,649
Scott: Yeah So, yeah We've gone on way longer than we probably needed to.

932
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:17,431
Rym: this is what happens when we don't do GeekNights that reliably and We don't really see each other that much except during GeekNights.

933
01:10:17,912 --> 01:10:19,880
Scott: So yeah, it's it's getting warm here.

934
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,374
Scott: I'm gonna start doing some biking imminently and outside?

935
01:10:23,455 --> 01:10:26,225
Scott: not I've been doing inside bike And no specific promises.

936
01:10:26,245 --> 01:10:35,410
Rym: cuz I'm not gonna shit talk but it is likely we will make some form of content Maybe even some GeekNights episodes on location outside.

937
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:36,092
Rym: cuz why not?

938
01:10:36,253 --> 01:10:39,100
Rym: even if it's just regular GeekNights, but we're sitting outside somewhere?

939
01:10:40,306 --> 01:10:40,918
Scott: Yeah, who knows?

940
01:10:41,941 --> 01:10:43,887
Rym: That's only exciting to us not to the listener.

941
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,368
Rym: Obviously.

942
01:10:44,509 --> 01:10:45,813
Scott: I hope that we can.

943
01:10:46,054 --> 01:10:50,819
Scott: you know, I you know, I have more Swimming opportunities in the rest of my life.

944
01:10:51,563 --> 01:10:55,040
Rym: I'm looking into that for some private events just for us to go swimming.

945
01:10:55,161 --> 01:11:09,219
Scott: But the amount of money it cost to live in a place in New York City with a pool Yeah, so there is a. there's a public pool here, which I've been to one or two times and I could go to it Especially not with the work from home.

946
01:11:10,002 --> 01:11:17,839
Scott: It would be much more convenient to go to that public pool, right and you know avoid too many children The problem being the COVID.

947
01:11:19,703 --> 01:11:29,440
Scott: If I was working from home without the COVID the public pool would be like, you know The fancier buildings that have about literally double the rent that we pay down the righties.

948
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,529
Scott: They have these shitty tiny useless pools.

949
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:38,776
Rym: Ah, one of those buildings has a full-size Tulane lap pool and a small pool.

950
01:11:40,523 --> 01:11:41,691
Scott: Yeah, but the Tulane lap pool.

951
01:11:41,711 --> 01:11:43,483
Scott: Those are like dinky little pools I want.

952
01:11:43,544 --> 01:11:46,140
Scott: you know, I need an Olympic size pool, right?

953
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:57,453
Rym: As a in-ground big Actually want a lap pool because the thing I'm most interested in cuz I'm not gonna get a diving pool on the roof of a Residential building that's not.

954
01:11:57,494 --> 01:11:58,180
Rym: that's not feasible.

955
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:02,231
Rym: But what I got I could do is start swimming laps as exercise.

956
01:12:02,271 --> 01:12:11,999
Rym: that is if you think running or biking is good cardio Go go do more than one lap in a lap and tell me how hard that is.

957
01:12:12,702 --> 01:12:13,645
Scott: I'm not interested in that.

958
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:14,910
Rym: I want a very interesting.

959
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:25,829
Scott: I want to ride on the alligator and make a whirlpool And play a play a water volleyball if we do a close friends Airbnb somewhere during this COVID times.

960
01:12:25,889 --> 01:12:27,496
Rym: Well, see if there's a place that has a private.

961
01:12:27,516 --> 01:12:28,600
Scott: That's not a bad idea.

962
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:29,885
Scott: It's like I was at first.

963
01:12:29,925 --> 01:12:33,016
Scott: you're thinking beach then we were thinking lake but you know what.

964
01:12:33,337 --> 01:12:36,999
Scott: you can get up Pretty much anywhere as long as it has a pool.

965
01:12:37,301 --> 01:12:41,835
Rym: Yeah rent out a house that just has a big pool in the backyard.

966
01:12:42,337 --> 01:12:42,678
Scott: Yeah.

967
01:12:42,919 --> 01:12:51,760
Rym: Yeah Yeah, that's what I'm looking into because I got to tell you stuff like that Way cheaper than the very limited number of beach houses that can sleep that many people.

968
01:12:53,473 --> 01:13:03,070
Rym: All right Yeah, this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
