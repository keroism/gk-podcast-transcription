1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,089
Rym: It's Thursday, November 17th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:10,411
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:14,160
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,009
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:18,100
Rym: We're talking about Chinese food.

6
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:20,378
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:37,120
Rym: So, uh, once we get past the point where it's too cold to bike and it gets dark early because we, uh, stupidly leave daylight saving time and go back to bad time, there's this period between when I can ski and when I can't bike.

8
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:45,120
Rym: And while there's some hiking and a little bit of camping I can do there, I really would like it to just dump a bunch of snow and I could just go right into ski season.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,373
Rym: So it turns out, upstate New York, right now, if you don't live in the northeast of the

10
00:00:49,454 --> 00:00:49,735
Rym: U.S.,

11
00:00:49,755 --> 00:00:51,060
Rym: you probably won't even know this is happening.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:01:06,060
Rym: What might be, what is on track to be one of the larger snowstorms in New York State history is about to hit Buffalo and Rochester and is not even gonna bring a whisper to the other parts of New York State from what I can tell.

13
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:09,380
Scott: I mean, it's got the top parts and not the bottom parts.

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,617
Rym: Yeah, not even the top parts.

15
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:20,000
Rym: Only the western parts because this is not cold snow, this is lake effect snow, so it's only along the lake and nowhere else.

16
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,920
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's, uh, it's how it goes.

17
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:23,400
Rym: Yep.

18
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:34,580
Rym: But, uh, based on the reporting I'm seeing today, they're projecting what might be, if the projections are true, it's going to be one of the largest snowfalls in that region in recorded history.

19
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,180
Scott: Potential historic lake effect snowstorm hammering Buffalo up to three or four feet expected.

20
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,900
Rym: That is, that would be cool, because I would like to have an excuse to not go anywhere.

21
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,580
Scott: It's also hitting up near the top parts of New York also, but, you know, near the lake up there, right?

22
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:49,482
Rym: Yep.

23
00:01:49,703 --> 00:01:52,435
Rym: You know, it's not hitting any of the ski mountains in New York State.

24
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:53,520
Rym: Not even close.

25
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:56,852
Scott: Uh, there should be some mountains.

26
00:01:56,872 --> 00:01:57,919
Scott: You gotta go way up there.

27
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:01,788
Rym: I mean, there really aren't mountains by the lakes.

28
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:06,860
Rym: The mountain, like Hunter Mountain, and then when you head further north, you're going to start going, uh, into other states.

29
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,344
Scott: Let's see.

30
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:08,497
Scott: Check my map here.

31
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:15,319
Scott: There's no, there's no mountains up by, like, uh, what is this?

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,920
Rym: Yeah, yeah, remember, do you remember at any point at RIT, because even when I was poor, I would ski if I could.

33
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:24,088
Rym: I never really went skiing, did I?

34
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,078
Rym: There is no skiing anywhere near RIT.

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,100
Scott: You didn't have any money.

36
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:29,186
Rym: Even if I did, there's nowhere to ski.

37
00:02:29,246 --> 00:02:33,920
Rym: And also, you can get into ski resorts real cheap or free if you know what you're doing.

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:44,480
Scott: Yeah, there might be some snow if you go up to, like, you know, Saranac area, Lake Placid area, but it won't be as much as it is down low.

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,873
Scott: But, like, lakes are low, right?

40
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:46,500
Scott: They're down.

41
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:53,700
Rym: Yeah, but also this storm, this specific storm, is going to be lake effect snow, and lake effect storms are very regional.

42
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,330
Rym: And this is a traditional storm that happens over that specific lake between Michigan and New York.

43
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:06,920
Rym: Yep, so, uh, in the news, the American midterm elections happen.

44
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:19,720
Rym: And in an interesting twist, for those of you who aren't Americans, of course, American voters are by and large fickle, kind of stupid, random, never mind all the gerrymandering and evil that happens.

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,760
Rym: But there's a trend that is so common and so repeatable that it is like a conventional wisdom.

46
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:37,640
Rym: Whenever we have a president who is elected in one of our major elections, which happen every four years, no matter what party that president is, the issues literally don't matter.

47
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,758
Rym: Whatever party they are not in will invariably win Congress in the midterm election.

48
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,570
Rym: that happens between those four-year elections.

49
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,800
Rym: So every two years, we have a midterm election.

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,140
Scott: Right, so the basic logic is that, you know, basically people who are voting are always cranky.

51
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,209
Scott: You don't get a lot of happy voters who are saying, "Things are

52
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,471
Scott: great!".

53
00:03:57,511 --> 00:03:59,460
Scott: That's pretty rare for things to be great, right?

54
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,846
Scott: Now, think, when have things been great?

55
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:01,248
Scott: What year?

56
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:03,720
Scott: What year was that when everyone felt that everything was awesome?

57
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:05,279
Rym: I mean, no year that I was alive.

58
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,103
Scott: Right, no year.

59
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:22,380
Scott: So, basically, whoever's president, right, gets, you know, from people who, you know, whether even people who are paying attention and understand how government works, even those people psychologically give credit and blame to the president, even though...

60
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,840
Rym: It's unwarranted, like the president doesn't control gas prices, but yet that's a specific thing people get mad about in America.

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,546
Scott: Right, so when people vote, it's like, you know, there are some people who actually, you know, say, "Well, these are my policies.

62
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:41,225
Scott: This is what I believe in, and this is the party that most closely matches that, and I'll vote for

63
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:41,426
Scott: them.".

64
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:48,852
Scott: And there are some people who just basically have some other logic, name recognition, who knows what their logic is, right?

65
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:51,740
Scott: And a common logic is, "I'm upset.

66
00:04:52,500 --> 00:05:02,881
Scott: This party, this color is in charge, and there I don't like what the way the world is now, so I'm gonna vote the other color, and then when that one's in charge and it sucks, they'll vote the other

67
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:03,262
Scott: color.".

68
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:09,985
Scott: They just keep doing this, and it's like, can you actually meet an individual who will tell you that that's what they believe?

69
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:15,443
Scott: Maybe not, but if you look at the voting results, that pattern is there, right?

70
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:22,751
Rym: We're doing some work training, and at work I'm getting trained on like data science, and it's actually like really easy stuff.

71
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,262
Rym: I already knew, but this is like broad training for a lot of people.

72
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:38,745
Rym: And the API and the model we used as an example in the course was, "Predict who someone will vote for based on factors," and the lab guides you to the fact that zip code and race is literally all that matters.

73
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:42,398
Scott: -I mean, population density, but that's zip code.

74
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:42,960
Rym: -That's zip code.

75
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,048
Scott: -Yeah, but yeah, so it that it.

76
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:52,147
Scott: currently the president is Democrat, therefore it would be expected in this election, right?

77
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:58,030
Scott: You know, just the way things go for there to be a shift to the red side when the blue side is in charge.

78
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,139
Scott: That's, you know, it's same thing happened, right?

79
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:04,376
Scott: When Republicans are president the next election, shift over to the blue side.

80
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:12,864
Rym: -And we're talking like in our house, which has over 400 seats, like for you not Americans, a shift of like plus 30 or plus 40 seats in the opposite direction.

81
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:14,890
Rym: These are usually big shifts.

82
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:29,435
Rym: So America went into this election in our usual, you know, existential crisis on the verge of just falling apart into chaos and civil war and whatever, and the Democrats actually lost almost nothing.

83
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:31,540
Rym: They barely are losing the house.

84
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,430
Rym: This was like a, they still lost.

85
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,253
Scott: -They are losing it.

86
00:06:35,373 --> 00:06:39,107
Scott: They are losing it, so it's lost, but they're losing it by like a handful, right?

87
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:47,417
Scott: And that handful, if, you know, New York specifically hadn't had some gerrymandering drama, might not have, they might not have lost the house.

88
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:49,986
Rym: -Oh yeah, we could have moved the house.

89
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:57,094
Scott: -I mean, and it also bears repeating, even though everyone knows this already, that without gerrymandering, the Democrats would never lose the house ever.

90
00:06:57,215 --> 00:07:04,606
Scott: Like if you just count the total number of votes, right, and did a proportional representation in the house, the Democrats would be way, way ahead.

91
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:13,442
Rym: -I mean, without gerrymandering on the state level, America would have the Democrats, who were like the center-right party, and some other minority party that was the left party.

92
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:14,769
Rym: The right wing would barely...

93
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:33,488
Scott: -But the point is, is that, you know, did they, you know, even though there was the shift to the red side, as expected, and it was much less than expected in terms of the real results that matter, the vast majority of the people voting, well, I don't know vast, but the majority of the people voting voted blue.

94
00:07:33,508 --> 00:07:37,965
Rym: -Actually, this election, a slight majority voted red.

95
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:39,412
Rym: It's just, there's been a separate change.

96
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:39,613
Rym: -Really?

97
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:40,920
Rym: -Yeah, there's been a separate change.

98
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,596
Rym: Districts that are already safely red are getting redder and redder and redder.

99
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,565
Rym: Like, right wing people get all of the votes.

100
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:56,010
Rym: And meanwhile, the blue districts, like in New York City, Republicans made huge gains, but if you look at the map...

101
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,376
Scott: -But only in South Brooklyn.

102
00:07:57,396 --> 00:08:05,703
Rym: -In three neighborhoods, North Brooklyn, in one specific neighborhood, South Brooklyn, in another specific neighborhood, and Staten Island.

103
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:06,526
Rym: -Right.

104
00:08:06,546 --> 00:08:07,087
Rym: -Nowhere else.

105
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:15,819
Scott: -We gotta say, those neighborhoods are the kind of places that, you know, voted Democrat, but they were voting for people like Cuomo, right?

106
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:22,660
Scott: It's like, they are the kind of people who, you know, well, Staten Island was full of Trumpy people, right?

107
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,603
Scott: So that's different, right?

108
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:31,874
Scott: But South Brooklyn is full of the kind of person who, you know, it's like, you know, you imagine, when you go to those neighborhoods, right?

109
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:36,019
Scott: Obviously, you know, I'm not going to stereotype everyone who lives in those neighborhoods because it's very diverse.

110
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,770
Rym: -Biking through those neighborhoods, a lot of Trump flags, for one.

111
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:54,684
Scott: -Right, but just like the rest of New York City, right, you know, those neighborhoods are very diverse, but the feeling of those neighborhoods and, I guess, a large portion of the population there are, like, what you might imagine as, like, an old New Yorker, right?

112
00:08:54,704 --> 00:09:00,241
Scott: Some old Brooklyn mafia guy or, you know, some old Russian guy, right?

113
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:02,352
Scott: That's what I think of when I think of those neighborhoods.

114
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:05,728
Rym: -Or tight-knit, insular, religious communities that vote as a bloc.

115
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:07,114
Scott: -Well, that's the Northern Brooklyn.

116
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:10,406
Rym: -Yep, who, this election, mostly went Republican.

117
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:12,852
Scott: -Yeah, I mean, they have always.

118
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:13,394
Scott: -Yep.

119
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:26,713
Scott: -But the thing is, those people would vote, you know, Democrat when they saw a person like, you know, an Andrew Cuomo, who is a lot like them, right, on the, as the person to vote for, right?

120
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:34,000
Scott: But, and, you know, against, say, you know, like, they would prefer a Cuomo to a Trump, that sort of, right, demographic, right?

121
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:41,002
Scott: But, when you have, like, a woman running for governor, that kind of demographic is going to be, like, right?

122
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:47,501
Scott: Because they're still misogynist and whatnot and sexist and all those other things, right?

123
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:57,017
Scott: And so, then, you know, that kind of person, especially, you know, who's watching the news too much and believing all the lies about crime rates and all that, what nonsense, right?

124
00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:57,519
Scott: -Yep.

125
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:06,030
Scott: -That person then would vote for, I guess, the person who, thankfully, will not be the governor of New York, Zeldin, who is basically a Trump guy pretending not to be.

126
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:17,351
Rym: -Yep, he, they are, the whole narrative for all the people outside of the city in this state was, basically, "Crime is high, therefore, we should go full fascist," and that was kind of Zeldin's actual message.

127
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:20,961
Scott: -Yeah, I mean, that's always the message, right?

128
00:10:20,981 --> 00:10:21,984
Rym: -But he was polling so well.

129
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:26,421
Scott: -We've had, we've had strong, you know, it's like, there's no logic to it, right?

130
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:32,860
Scott: It's simply, it's, it's, it's a straight appeal to emotion and, you know, the simplicity, right?

131
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:36,575
Scott: It's like, you know, and it's been going on for, for decades and decades.

132
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,042
Rym: -But there's so many things wrong with it.

133
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:41,738
Rym: It's not even just, "Oh, crime is not actually historically up by these wide

134
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:41,899
Rym: margins.".

135
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:52,276
Scott: -Well, no, no, first of all, no, the first thing you have to say, you got to realize, is that when the, when the politicians come out and say, "Crime is high," right, they don't mean, "Crime is

136
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:52,537
Scott: high."

137
00:10:52,577 --> 00:10:55,184
Scott: What they're saying is black, right?

138
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:56,490
Scott: That's what they're saying, right?

139
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,237
Scott: They're saying, "Black is high," right?

140
00:10:58,598 --> 00:10:59,541
Scott: It's like, there's.

141
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:03,231
Scott: no, they're, right, they're saying, "Vote for me," right?

142
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:08,487
Scott: "I am, I am white, and I will, I will send the, I'll have more police and take care of the black

143
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:08,768
Scott: people.".

144
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:18,964
Rym: -But also, even if, even if somehow crime were really high, they're also saying, "We're just going to flood the streets with cops and make everyone's lives worse.

145
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:20,933
Rym: They're not actually going to do anything about

146
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:21,295
Rym: crime.".

147
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:34,283
Scott: -Well, I think, well, they, the problem is, is that people, I think even people on the left, right, just not the extreme left, like us, right, it's like, people just sort of have this, they don't think about it too hard, right?

148
00:11:34,303 --> 00:11:36,435
Scott: They don't investigate it, they're not taught it, right?

149
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:44,098
Scott: They just sort of have this, you know, really simple logic of like, you know, "Oh, there is crime, therefore

150
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:44,840
Scott: police.".

151
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,328
Scott: The same way you would think, "There's fire, therefore

152
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:47,970
Scott: water.".

153
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,619
Scott: Or, "There's a mess, therefore paper

154
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:50,900
Scott: towels.".

155
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,860
Rym: -But whereas if something's on fire, a firefighter will come and put that fire out and try to help you.

156
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,998
Scott: -The problem is, is that very simple logic, right, is like, "Yes, water does put out fires.

157
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:02,404
Scott: Yes, paper towel does clean up

158
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:02,544
Scott: messes.".

159
00:12:02,564 --> 00:12:03,589
Rym: -But police don't put out crime.

160
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:04,794
Scott: -Police don't solve crime.

161
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:14,155
Scott: That's a, it's just a wrong thing, right, as people don't realize that that's wrong, and it's very hard to convince someone that's wrong, because it's such a basic ingrained thing.

162
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:23,013
Rym: -Like, there was this thing that just happened recently in New York City, where if someone got attacked on the subway, while that's very rare, it's not zero, and there was a cop there on the platform.

163
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:26,867
Rym: Cop didn't do shit, cop just cleaned up after it was over, he didn't help anybody.

164
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:29,758
Scott: -Police don't prevent crimes, right?

165
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:33,735
Scott: They just don't, even if you, even if the, what if everyone in society was a cop?

166
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:35,181
Scott: It's like, would there still be crime?

167
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:41,666
Scott: It's like, it's like, we've spent billions and billions of dollars on cops, they're already everywhere, and crime goes up.

168
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:46,201
Scott: You know, the, it's obvious that if cops worked, there wouldn't be crime.

169
00:12:46,221 --> 00:12:53,635
Rym: -Even worse, people talk about how, "Oh, well, they show up, you know, they deal with the fallout from crime, the side effects of crime, they investigate crime, they solve

170
00:12:53,655 --> 00:12:53,816
Rym: crime.".

171
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:54,700
Rym: No, they don't.

172
00:12:55,001 --> 00:13:01,763
Rym: The rate at which crimes, major crimes, are solved has not risen with increased police at all in America anywhere.

173
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:14,583
Scott: -No, but anyway, but the point is, is that you, racist people will campaign, right, on crime, the media will cooperate because, you know, television, all they have to show on nightly news is crime, right?

174
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:27,049
Scott: It's like, you know, in New York City, even if the crime rate is low, it's like, there will be a handful of crimes every day, even if we reduce crime, and New York's already has less crime and is safer than most other places there are, period.

175
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:27,330
Scott: -Yeah.

176
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:51,675
Scott: -It's just that the rate is so low, but the population is so high, there's always gonna be some, some crime to report on, so if you watch New York Nightly News, no matter what year it is, no matter what the crime rate is, they've got crime stories to lead, right, that will terrify people who are watching the news, right, and convince them to vote for some candidate who comes out and says, "Yeah, crime's a problem.

177
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:54,545
Scott: The news isn't doing it because they want a particular candidate,".

178
00:13:54,565 --> 00:14:16,851
Scott: at least in most cases, some cases they do, but the news is doing it because that's what drives ratings, right, and it hurts our whole society in this way, and notice as soon as the, the day the election's over, crime's not a problem anymore, right, suddenly crime is, crime is not, right, it's like, the news is still showing those stories, but the politicians aren't talking about it anymore the day after the election.

179
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:24,542
Rym: -Except our piece of shit mayor who, after the election announced he's gonna end all cash bail reforms because that is, quote, "Why the Democrats lost

180
00:14:24,642 --> 00:14:25,124
Rym: upstate.".

181
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:28,736
Scott: -Well, that's it, right, it's, whatever, we could talk about that all day.

182
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:32,371
Rym: -Yeah, but there's something else that happened that I think is real important to touch on briefly.

183
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:38,575
Rym: In New York State, we lost a seat in the House because the state is losing population.

184
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:41,667
Rym: Let's not get into the fact that the census was not run very well.

185
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:43,875
Scott: -Who knows if we really lost population or not.

186
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:51,680
Rym: -But the city gained population, the state overall lost population, but the state, the state could gerrymander itself.

187
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,982
Rym: We could draw the districts in New York State to where there is one Republican and everyone else is a Democrat.

188
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:58,446
Rym: We kind of tried to.

189
00:14:58,907 --> 00:15:04,223
Rym: That got thrown out by the courts by the judges who were appointed by Cuomo.

190
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:08,555
Rym: -Right, well, well supported by Cuomo, appointed by Republicans.

191
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:17,622
Scott: -Okay, so New York, rightly, you know, I guess in principle at least, right, has some rules to prevent, you know, horrific gerrymandering.

192
00:15:17,642 --> 00:15:19,971
Rym: -Most blue states do, and most red states don't.

193
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:20,693
Rym: -Right,

194
00:15:20,753 --> 00:16:07,222
Scott: if every place had those rules, it would be all good, but basically they handcuffed themselves into having these rules in the first place, so that's mistake number one, right, and then mistake number two was it's like, okay, they went to go and follow the procedures that, you know, that were within the law that they created, right, and they tried to push it as far as they could, but because that law was there, they couldn't push it that far, and then what Rym just said is that, you know, it was up to some judges to decide, and Cuomo, a Democratic governor, the previous governor, right, who, you know, was forced to resign because he was such a piece of shit, he put Republic, even though he's a Democrat, he put in Republican judges, right, that's why those South Brooklyn people are okay voting for him because he was that kind of person.

195
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:16,768
Rym: -So, basically, New York State might be the reason the Democrats didn't somehow hold the House.

196
00:16:16,788 --> 00:16:27,730
Scott: -Right, it was like a couple seat tilt, the fact that, you know, New York didn't gerrymander as hard as it could have, right, could have gotten an extra seat or few, which would have tilted the entire country.

197
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,111
Scott: -Yeah,

198
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:49,018
Rym: but to put this to a positive light, the thing you should take away is not New York State drama, like New York State, we got to start this out, and I think it's doable because there aren't that many, it's not that often there'll be a Zeldin-like figure that can drag voters who normally don't vote in the state to the polls, but this was actually a huge victory for democracy and for Democrats.

199
00:16:49,058 --> 00:17:07,430
Rym: The fact that we're holding on to the Senate and we're holding on to enough power to where they can't, the Republicans can't fuck things up too badly over the next two years, and it seems like the primary reason this happened is a lot of swing states went pretty hard blue, a lot of swing districts went pretty hard blue, the primary reason was abortion.

200
00:17:07,872 --> 00:17:12,386
Rym: They take trying to ban abortion nationally, they pushed too far, and the backlash was real.

201
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:12,506
Rym: -Yeah,

202
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:31,311
Scott: you know, people don't care about, you know, the thing, if Republicans are doing evil shit, you know, Trump doing evil shit when he was president, right, and people, it wasn't going to change people's votes if he was, you know, running, you know, genocide camps for, you know, migrants crossing the border down south.

203
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:40,471
Scott: because those people who were voting for Trump are unaffected by that other than they see it on the news, and when they see it on the news they kind of like it because they're sadistic and evil, right?

204
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:40,833
Scott: -Right.

205
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:59,655
Scott: -But if the Republicans actually do something that impacts people's lives in a noticeable way, directly, immediately, right, then yeah, that's, you know, that's going to turn people out, right, so that's why gas prices turn people out and abortion is going to turn people out.

206
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:00,779
Rym: -So don't walk away.

207
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:20,720
Scott: -Basically do whatever you want as, you know, if you're running the country, it's like you don't have to follow your principles or what you said because only nerds who are paying attention to politics pay attention to that or care, right, but to get the votes of the mass populace, the things that affect their everyday lives, right, or that they believe affect their everyday lives like crime.

208
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:32,742
Rym: -So I want to, I want you to take away from this election that this was actually a surprising victory and a hopeful one, like this, this puts us in a way better position than a lot of people expected.

209
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:44,465
Rym: Do not buy into a media narrative that Democrats fucked this up or somehow in disarray, but the Democrats honestly did the best that anyone's ever done in this kind of situation before in all of American history.

210
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:48,135
Rym: So you got any news, Taylor Swift?

211
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:52,309
Scott: -Well, it's not Taylor, it's not Taylor Swift's news, right?

212
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:53,253
Scott: It's Ticketmaster news, right?

213
00:18:53,353 --> 00:18:55,642
Scott: So Taylor Swift came out with the album, right?

214
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:59,736
Scott: People love it, I don't even listen to it, I don't really care, it's not my deal.

215
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:04,187
Scott: If you like it, good for you, congrats, you know, anyway.

216
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:06,953
Scott: -Congrats?

217
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:12,694
Rym: This reminds me of way back, I met some co-workers' kid and the kid was like, "Oh, how old are

218
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:12,815
Rym: you?".

219
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:13,618
Rym: And the kid was like, "I'm

220
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,000
Rym: seven.".

221
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,810
Rym: And I was like, "Oh, congratulations, good

222
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,092
Rym: job.".

223
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:17,319
Rym: And everyone's like, "Wait,

224
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:17,419
Rym: what?".

225
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:22,801
Scott: -I mean, there are people who are like, you know, they're like huge, huge fans, like this is like a big deal for them.

226
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:23,766
Rym: -They call themselves Swifties.

227
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:24,590
Scott: -Congratulations.

228
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,765
Rym: -And no, we're not talking about the Global International Payments Network.

229
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:32,647
Scott: -I mean, there are people, like Swifties are like, you know, actual like people in the fan club, like big time, right?

230
00:19:32,687 --> 00:19:37,826
Scott: But it's like, you know, Taylor Swift's music goes beyond just the fan club, it's like everybody, right?

231
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:38,990
Scott: At least almost everybody.

232
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:43,606
Scott: Anyway, the point is, is that she's going on the tour, right?

233
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:48,686
Scott: And the tickets go on sale, so obviously it's going to be, you know, big time packing, right?

234
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:53,562
Scott: It's like, yeah, you got people reloading, you got your freaking scalpers, you got the bots.

235
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:57,800
Rym: -It's the same as PAX, we've talked about this a million times, the unsolvable problem.

236
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,582
Scott: -Right.

237
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:12,052
Scott: No matter, right, so beyond the unsolvable problem, right, the fact is, is that Ticketmaster, during the pre-sale, right, in which case, in the pre-sale is basically, it's on sale, but you need a special code, but everyone fucking knows the code, right?

238
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,562
Scott: So it's basically when it's on sale, right?

239
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:20,018
Scott: When the tickets go on sale, so many people hit Ticketmaster, it went down, right?

240
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:22,045
Scott: Because it's not that great.

241
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:33,050
Scott: And now you can go, and I think even John Oliver had a thing about Ticketmaster, but like, there are so many places, if you want to read about what's wrong with Ticketmaster, you can read and learn everything that's wrong with them, right?

242
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:50,115
Scott: All the problems with scalping, and how most of the tickets don't even get to the Ticketmaster, they're already sold, or, you know, sectioned off for other people, and how Ticketmaster's a monopoly, and obviously antitrust would go a long way towards solving that problem, and such and such and such, right?

243
00:20:50,556 --> 00:20:59,307
Scott: But Ticketmaster went down, and now basically, there's going to be the real sale is going to come, but the real sale, first of all, most of the tickets are already gone.

244
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:04,269
Scott: There's like not many left, because they were all in the pre-sale, which is the real sale, right?

245
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:14,467
Scott: It's like, but there were, you know, there's supposed to be a time at which they're just on sale, with no code necessary for the people who couldn't look on Twitter and find the code, okay?

246
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:24,124
Scott: So, but they're going to cancel that, because like, we can't handle the number of people who are going to come in, and there's almost no tickets left anyway, right?

247
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:30,245
Scott: There's like going to be a million people trying to fight over like 20 tickets per showing, or whatever concert, right?

248
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:41,599
Scott: So they just canceled that whole thing, and now that's a big ticketmaster that I think a lot of people don't realize in this discussion, right?

249
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:56,392
Scott: Is that forgetting about all the issues that everyone already knows about, and have already been discussed to death, the issue that is not discussed to death is that Ticketmaster, the company, their customer is not people who are buying tickets.

250
00:21:56,472 --> 00:22:06,290
Scott: Their customer is not even the scalpers, even though they are very friendly with the scalpers who are going to, you know, run their spots and buy all the tickets and get margins or whatever, right?

251
00:22:06,913 --> 00:22:17,941
Scott: Ticketmaster's only customer are venues, buildings in which concerts, sports, theater, and other major events that are ticketed happen.

252
00:22:18,222 --> 00:22:21,974
Scott: That is the only person that Ticketmaster gives a fuck about, right?

253
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:28,334
Scott: Because as they get with those venues, the venues sign an exclusive contract, right?

254
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:40,199
Scott: And now Ticketmaster doesn't give a shit about anything that happens after that, because number one, as long as the events happen in the venues and the venue is running itself, the tickets will get sold, right?

255
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,286
Scott: Someone is going to see that concert, right?

256
00:22:42,547 --> 00:22:53,523
Scott: And how many people see the concert has no relation to which ticket vendoring service the venue has chosen, and Ticketmaster will get a cut of all those tickets no matter what.

257
00:22:54,025 --> 00:23:03,162
Scott: It's like, it doesn't fucking matter if they provide a good service or a bad service or if buying the tickets is nice or convenient or if it's a pain in the ass, right?

258
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:04,868
Scott: It doesn't matter, right?

259
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:16,328
Scott: The Taylor Swift concert in that venue will sell out, no matter if it was Ticketmaster, Eventbrite, Telecharge, Scott Rubin's ticket company, doesn't fucking matter, right?

260
00:23:16,368 --> 00:23:21,708
Scott: Those tickets will get sold and the company that sells the tickets will get a service charge and every ticket sold.

261
00:23:21,728 --> 00:23:22,872
Scott: End of story.

262
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:34,732
Scott: So Ticketmaster, all they have to do, the only people that they have to sell to are the venue, to convince the venue to sign an exclusive deal with Ticketmaster and not with somebody else.

263
00:23:35,053 --> 00:23:42,296
Rym: Now if you think the venues have any interest in altering this arrangement, well, we've been through this before.

264
00:23:42,356 --> 00:23:49,683
Rym: Pearl Jam had a huge public fight with Ticketmaster over the same issue back when I was in like middle school, and guess what?

265
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:51,489
Rym: Fucking nothing happened.

266
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:52,472
Rym: Right.

267
00:23:52,753 --> 00:24:03,191
Scott: Okay, so as long as Ticketmaster, as soon as Ticketmaster gets that deal signed with the venue, they have that pile of money from that venue for the term of that deal, the end.

268
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,298
Scott: The rest of it, nothing else matters, right?

269
00:24:05,338 --> 00:24:13,750
Scott: As long as Ticketmaster gets the ticket sold and stays up enough, right, and provides enough service to sell the tickets, they're good, right?

270
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,242
Scott: It doesn't matter how shitty it is as long as it gets the tickets sold.

271
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:20,016
Scott: So what would convince a venue to leave Ticketmaster?

272
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:24,472
Scott: Well, Ticketmaster would have to fuck up so royally that tickets don't get sold, right?

273
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:30,394
Scott: It's like, "Ah, why is this Taylor Swift thing that should be full only half full because your site's been down that

274
00:24:30,455 --> 00:24:30,716
Scott: much?".

275
00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:32,102
Scott: That would be a problem.

276
00:24:32,202 --> 00:24:33,046
Scott: That will never happen.

277
00:24:33,086 --> 00:24:36,220
Scott: Ticketmaster stays up enough for that to not happen, right?

278
00:24:36,581 --> 00:24:39,173
Scott: What else could convince a venue to leave Ticketmaster?

279
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:45,296
Scott: Well, you would have to have a competitor to Ticketmaster, right, that can a) less service charge.

280
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:47,102
Scott: That way the venue keeps more money, right?

281
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:48,225
Scott: Money talks, right?

282
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:52,818
Scott: But b) your new service has to be proven, right?

283
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:54,804
Scott: Their venue is not going to take a risk, right?

284
00:24:54,824 --> 00:24:56,531
Scott: They know Ticketmaster is a safe bet.

285
00:24:57,053 --> 00:25:00,044
Scott: So your thing has to be proven to work, right?

286
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:06,127
Scott: As proven as Ticketmaster is, which is, you might say, not very proven, but it's like, they got the ticket sold, right?

287
00:25:06,187 --> 00:25:10,262
Scott: So you have to be, the venue is not going to take any risks, right?

288
00:25:10,323 --> 00:25:17,010
Scott: That if they switch to you and piss off Ticketmaster and can't go back to them, that not all the tickets will get sold properly.

289
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:21,691
Rym: And not just got all the tickets sold, but handled all the logistics related to how those tickets are redeemed.

290
00:25:22,193 --> 00:25:30,645
Scott: That's the last thing, right, is that you don't, people think, when they think about ticketing, they're just thinking about the base problem, right?

291
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:31,548
Scott: There are X tickets.

292
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,571
Scott: Each one is unique.

293
00:25:32,852 --> 00:25:39,114
Scott: You have to distribute them and price them and whatnot and show a seat map and the basic, right, that part.

294
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:46,882
Scott: There are so many edge cases in the ticketing business of things that happen behind the scenes, in front of the eye, on the side.

295
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:51,402
Scott: Different venues have different requirements, laws and regulations in different states.

296
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:54,954
Scott: Just so many fucking different things you have to deal with.

297
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:58,726
Scott: People returning tickets, you know, someone wants to sell it.

298
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:05,108
Scott: It is so handy, just, you know, tickets for people with disabilities and special areas, right?

299
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:09,340
Scott: There's so many edge cases that you have to deal with.

300
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:20,332
Scott: And Ticketmaster, having been in the business so long and having, you know, control of every venue already handles 100% of those use cases.

301
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:21,114
Scott: All of them.

302
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:25,570
Scott: Ticketmaster, that's why behind the scenes, I've seen Ticketmaster systems behind the scenes.

303
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:32,893
Scott: They're garbage because it's some conglomerate, it's a mess of duct tape and old bad code.

304
00:26:33,314 --> 00:26:38,955
Scott: But that piece of shit, old system, it handles every use case, all of them, every single use case is handled.

305
00:26:39,216 --> 00:26:43,027
Scott: So your competing system has to handle 100% of the use cases.

306
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:52,593
Scott: If you handle 99% of the use cases and you go to a venue and once in that venue, that use case might be ultra rare.

307
00:26:52,774 --> 00:26:54,540
Scott: It happens like once a year, right?

308
00:26:55,122 --> 00:26:56,648
Scott: But Ticketmaster handles it.

309
00:26:56,869 --> 00:26:57,792
Scott: It'll, it'll just work.

310
00:26:58,194 --> 00:27:07,473
Scott: And you don't, you don't have code for that yet because you haven't been in this business a hundred years and you don't have a code base with, you know, decades of institutional knowledge in it.

311
00:27:08,055 --> 00:27:09,179
Scott: They're not going to go with you.

312
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:12,552
Scott: They're going to go with something that doesn't meet all their needs, right?

313
00:27:12,873 --> 00:27:17,170
Scott: So you have to meet more use cases that Ticketmaster, or at least as many.

314
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,164
Scott: And even if you did that, it's like, okay, we do everything that Ticketmaster does.

315
00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:26,440
Scott: And we've proven that we're reliable and right.

316
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,871
Scott: We're going to charge you less money than Ticketmaster does.

317
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,446
Scott: First of all, how is it even possible for a new company to do all those things?

318
00:27:32,788 --> 00:27:40,175
Rym: I mean, uh, there's the secondary market companies that even they're struggling to get into that like secondary market, right?

319
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:44,507
Scott: It's like, there is no way to convince a venue to go with you.

320
00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:44,949
Scott: Right.

321
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:50,165
Scott: So the, you know, the obvious is the antitrust thing would be good, right?

322
00:27:50,326 --> 00:27:56,213
Rym: I think that's the only way to solve this would be government action, which with our current structure is I think, I think, right.

323
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:57,257
Scott: Well, yes, maybe.

324
00:27:57,338 --> 00:28:01,156
Scott: But I think, yes, a government action, but not just an antitrust government action.

325
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:09,517
Scott: I think you simply need a government action that says that clearly defines the process and procedures.

326
00:28:09,918 --> 00:28:12,326
Scott: right for selling tickets, right?

327
00:28:12,547 --> 00:28:15,518
Scott: When there is an event, it's like, you may not, right.

328
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:19,032
Scott: It has to specifically prescribe, like you can't set aside tickets.

329
00:28:19,192 --> 00:28:22,204
Scott: Every seat in the venue must be made publicly, right?

330
00:28:22,224 --> 00:28:27,146
Rym: You can't, you know, I don't think such measures would be popular among even just regular people who want to go to events.

331
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:31,061
Scott: I think you could, it depends what they are, right?

332
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:35,005
Scott: You have to be very careful with this and you have to, it's going to have to be really complicated, right?

333
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:38,826
Scott: You're going to have to worry about all different kinds of events and different venues, right?

334
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:42,140
Scott: You know, but you can at least have some more, you know, guidelines, right?

335
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,882
Scott: Where it's like.

336
00:28:43,303 --> 00:28:52,380
Scott: basically the way tickets are sold is completely, you know, defined by Ticketmaster and the venues, they in the, and the, you know, the, the people putting on the shows, right?

337
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,150
Scott: They just decide amongst themselves what's best for them.

338
00:28:55,652 --> 00:29:01,752
Scott: And the, the, the ticket buyer has no input on the process of ticket distribution, right?

339
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:16,522
Scott: So the government simply has to come in as the representative of the people and be the input on, well, you know what, we don't want to have our say as the people who attend the events, we should have some say in the method of ticket distribution.

340
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:22,766
Rym: It should be a lot like the passenger bill of rights that we can't actually like fully realize with airlines.

341
00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:23,971
Scott: That's a similar thing, right?

342
00:29:23,992 --> 00:29:30,879
Scott: The airlines run the airlines and the airports with the way they want to, but there is an FAA that does put some regulations down.

343
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:32,170
Rym: With a little heavier hand.

344
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:37,458
Rym: And they should say things like, if you bump someone on voluntarily, you owe them like a hundred thousand dollars.

345
00:29:37,498 --> 00:29:37,879
Rym: Fuck you.

346
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:38,801
Scott: Right.

347
00:29:39,103 --> 00:29:48,455
Scott: You, you know, make it so that like, yes, you have to, if, if the demand for the show is too high, you have to use some sort of random allotment system, right?

348
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:57,182
Scott: You can't take a greater percentage of the tickets of the, in the total venue space and set them aside for VIPs or whatever, right?

349
00:29:57,203 --> 00:29:59,113
Scott: You have to let the public in, right?

350
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:04,378
Scott: If you're going to sell tickets to the public, you know, you can't just, you know, get sold them to yourself as like, right.

351
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:07,851
Scott: You know, the service charges can only be so high, right?

352
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:13,713
Scott: All these kinds of rules you can put in there and that would go a long way towards fixing it because.

353
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:18,290
Rym: Well, the problem is there's no actual incentive for anyone to fix this.

354
00:30:18,411 --> 00:30:20,600
Rym: Nobody cares about this enough to vote because of it.

355
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,209
Rym: Nobody is willing to say, well, fuck that.

356
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,856
Rym: I won't go see Taylor Swift.

357
00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:27,846
Rym: If they're a Taylor Swift fan, they're just going to suck it up.

358
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:28,268
Rym: Exactly.

359
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,380
Scott: So they'll do whatever they have to do to see.

360
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:35,745
Rym: Well, literally never talk about this issue because the last thing they want is any complication or disruption.

361
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:36,568
Rym: The artists.

362
00:30:36,588 --> 00:30:43,950
Scott: Well, the one, the one thing that could disrupt them that has come close to happening right is taxes, right?

363
00:30:44,271 --> 00:30:45,273
Scott: Ticket taxes.

364
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:48,741
Scott: They are terrified of ticket taxes.

365
00:30:48,922 --> 00:30:55,322
Rym: Why do you think so many nerd conventions have memberships and badges, but they don't have tickets.

366
00:30:56,086 --> 00:30:56,327
Scott: Sure.

367
00:30:56,447 --> 00:30:59,923
Scott: But the point is, is that there have been lots of discussions in like state legislatures.

368
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:02,555
Scott: Remember in New York, you know, maybe a decade ish ago.

369
00:31:02,575 --> 00:31:03,379
Scott: I want to say, right.

370
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,838
Scott: It's like, there was almost going to be some, you know, big ticket event tax coming down.

371
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:09,424
Scott: And they were like, fuck, fuck, fuck.

372
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:16,792
Scott: They sent the lobbyist army out because if that went through, that would have shut down several ticket based businesses, basically.

373
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,213
Scott: Right.

374
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:27,877
Scott: So, because, you know, the margin goes down or the price goes up and then it's like, you know, whoever's some middleman taking a cut is now suddenly out because everyone else needs to get up.

375
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:40,827
Rym: Now, of course, there is the underlying problem that the only reason there's a middleman taking a cut on secondary market scalping, all of that is because the demand is higher than supply and the price is lower than the price point.

376
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:41,730
Rym: People are willing to pay.

377
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:45,042
Rym: And that is an unsolvable problem.

378
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:50,102
Scott: Even if even if they raise the prices to what people are willing to pay just from the outset.

379
00:31:50,624 --> 00:31:50,844
Scott: Right.

380
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:52,229
Scott: It's still.

381
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:57,932
Scott: you're still going to have, you know, these systems of unfair distribution because it's like you can't raise the.

382
00:31:58,013 --> 00:31:59,037
Scott: it's like there's like.

383
00:31:59,097 --> 00:32:01,448
Scott: it's like, OK, we'll make the Taylor's tickets a thousand dollars.

384
00:32:01,468 --> 00:32:02,814
Scott: They still sell out.

385
00:32:03,637 --> 00:32:03,818
Scott: Right.

386
00:32:03,858 --> 00:32:04,742
Scott: It's like three thousand.

387
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:05,364
Scott: It's like a what?

388
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,192
Scott: It's like you're either going to get.

389
00:32:07,252 --> 00:32:18,536
Scott: there's no line you can draw where either a there's enough there's more people that will pay the ridiculous price than there are seats or once you get too high, it's like, OK, well, now you can't even.

390
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:18,998
Scott: it's like.

391
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:21,268
Scott: it's like it's almost like there's a single dollar line.

392
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:22,795
Scott: It's like, well, there is.

393
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:26,349
Rym: And that's that's why one thing you can do is go from on that line.

394
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:31,449
Scott: You go from complete sell out to like half empty because it's like, OK, I'll pay four thousand.

395
00:32:31,489 --> 00:32:32,533
Scott: But five thousand.

396
00:32:32,574 --> 00:32:33,819
Scott: It's like, no, no one can afford.

397
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,459
Rym: That's why you do one of those auction styles where the first ten tickets are ten thousand dollars each.

398
00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:44,464
Rym: And if they don't get sold, the allotment grows to twenty and the price drops to nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars.

399
00:32:44,705 --> 00:32:48,780
Rym: And it just slowly ticks down until until they're all sold.

400
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:54,440
Scott: I think some system like that, but you'd have to remove the waiting and the and the work, right?

401
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,555
Scott: Everyone would just go and type in the amount they're willing to pay.

402
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:01,629
Scott: And then the system would just do it and email you whether you got to.

403
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:05,084
Rym: But then, of course, only rich people ever go to any major event again ever.

404
00:33:05,265 --> 00:33:10,101
Scott: But it's already kind of only there's only so many Ferraris made every year.

405
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:11,407
Scott: Only rich people drive them.

406
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,311
Scott: It's not any different.

407
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:15,966
Scott: There are plenty of other events that are less popular.

408
00:33:15,986 --> 00:33:22,549
Rym: Meanwhile, I'm going to see Emily and I are going to go see Perov Stelar in concert in like February at in New York.

409
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:23,792
Scott: Is it is it sold out?

410
00:33:24,173 --> 00:33:29,833
Rym: It was not sold out over the weekend when I checked and tickets were like fifty bucks like G.A.

411
00:33:29,853 --> 00:33:30,636
Scott: because that's not.

412
00:33:30,656 --> 00:33:31,881
Scott: that's not some huge show.

413
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:31,982
Scott: Yeah.

414
00:33:32,002 --> 00:33:33,588
Rym: You know, I just I don't.

415
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,817
Rym: I basically generally avoid huge things.

416
00:33:35,837 --> 00:33:38,085
Rym: The only huge thing I'll go to regularly is hockey.

417
00:33:38,547 --> 00:33:40,353
Rym: And we just have season tickets that we share.

418
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:52,772
Rym: So half a season share a shared half a season because, yeah, an actual season would be, well, as much as I love hockey, I could not use an entire season.

419
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:55,981
Scott: We would need some more people in.

420
00:33:56,062 --> 00:33:56,565
Rym: Yeah, we would.

421
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:57,470
Rym: That would that would be.

422
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,260
Rym: I like hockey, but I like hockey enough to go to.

423
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,845
Scott: if I was retired, I could do it.

424
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:01,327
Rym: Oh, yeah.

425
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:10,659
Rym: Well, if I can retire, if if a world exists where I can retire, I absolutely would love to be the kind of old New York guy who has a range of season ticket.

426
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:11,203
Rym: I don't even care.

427
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:12,147
Rym: Give me a terrible ticket.

428
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,614
Rym: Just go to every home game.

429
00:34:13,956 --> 00:34:16,306
Rym: Be the guy where people recognize my voice.

430
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:23,114
Scott: I mean, if you want to do it economically, you could buy them like you would buy them last second tickets from on the second hand market.

431
00:34:23,175 --> 00:34:23,456
Scott: Right.

432
00:34:23,657 --> 00:34:24,300
Scott: But I'm an old man.

433
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,022
Scott: The thing is, that would never get you into like the crowded, sold out games that only get you into.

434
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:35,444
Rym: You know, you want to be the old man who's been sitting in the same seat for 20 years and like people around you know how annoying you are.

435
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:43,219
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

436
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:47,675
Rym: So I got to step through a little history for this thing of the day because I'm going to link to first.

437
00:34:48,498 --> 00:34:51,831
Rym: This was like a TikTok meme from not even that long ago.

438
00:34:52,172 --> 00:34:53,177
Rym: Get the fuck out of here.

439
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:55,766
Rym: And it's just this little like short video that was kind of funny.

440
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,638
Scott: I didn't see the meme until Rym sent it to me.

441
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,622
Rym: I did not see the meme.

442
00:34:59,803 --> 00:35:00,967
Rym: I did not know the meme existed.

443
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:03,054
Rym: I started playing Disco Elysium.

444
00:35:03,656 --> 00:35:17,097
Rym: And one of the most popular videos about Disco Elysium is actually a meme where someone has recreated that TikTok meme in Disco Elysium with the characters in a way that makes sense to the characters.

445
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:18,121
Rym: And it's really well done.

446
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:32,416
Rym: But my thing of the day is someone has taken the concept of the meme and galaxy-brained it into the test chamber from the opening scene of Half-Life 1. very well.

447
00:35:32,436 --> 00:35:33,920
Rym: It is funny on its own.

448
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:36,529
Rym: If you understand the meme, it makes sense.

449
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:38,979
Rym: If you understand Half-Life, it makes sense.

450
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,463
Rym: And that is my thing of the day.

451
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:50,957
Scott: This would be like if we never did the original Steamed Hams and we just went straight to a Steamed Hams variation as like the first thing of the day.

452
00:35:51,077 --> 00:35:55,009
Rym: We are already two transformations deep from the original meme.

453
00:35:55,991 --> 00:35:56,814
Scott: Right.

454
00:35:56,934 --> 00:35:57,977
Scott: Okay, my thing of the day.

455
00:35:58,037 --> 00:36:06,006
Scott: So we got a problem in that we have a thing of the day policy of not using things of the day from the same source repeatedly.

456
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:06,568
Rym: Oh my God.

457
00:36:06,628 --> 00:36:10,220
Rym: Otherwise, PBS SciShow would have been my last 20.

458
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,501
Scott: Yeah.

459
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:18,381
Scott: But we have another problem in that magicians are doing amazing magic tricks, right?

460
00:36:18,522 --> 00:36:26,408
Scott: Are an often somewhat frequent source of things of the day, even since early days of GeekNights, because nerds like magic, right?

461
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:37,383
Scott: But the problem is that there's really only one major big platform for magicians to get attention on a large scale these days, which is a single television show.

462
00:36:37,844 --> 00:36:39,208
Scott: Penn and Teller's fool us, right?

463
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:47,475
Scott: And that's why the show it's like, it's like, it's just like some show on CW, but it's still going, right?

464
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:49,542
Scott: That show's been going on for a long ass time.

465
00:36:49,924 --> 00:36:51,088
Scott: It's still going on.

466
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:58,984
Scott: And it's like, yes, because that is, it's like, not like back in the day where you could be David Copperfield and get your own special or be Penn and Teller and get your own TV special.

467
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,727
Scott: that stands alone.

468
00:36:59,948 --> 00:37:01,435
Scott: That doesn't happen anymore, right?

469
00:37:01,796 --> 00:37:06,874
Scott: The only way for a magician to get like larger and more well known, right?

470
00:37:06,954 --> 00:37:08,680
Scott: Is to be on that show, right?

471
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,988
Scott: And that's, I think largely why the show exists.

472
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:12,473
Scott: And it's a good thing the show exists.

473
00:37:13,155 --> 00:37:19,921
Scott: Um, so, but the problem is anything in the day we do of a magician is probably going to be them on that show.

474
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:34,362
Scott: So, um, but what they, one good thing the show does that I like a lot is when people appear on that show, the show lets them post a video clip of their performance on their own YouTube channel.

475
00:37:35,325 --> 00:37:41,746
Scott: So if I were to go on the show somehow, even though I can't do any magic tricks whatsoever, not even fucking cup and balls.

476
00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:45,161
Rym: I mean, you, you, you can do magic tricks on the level of my thumb disappeared.

477
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:46,645
Scott: Maybe.

478
00:37:46,745 --> 00:37:46,966
Scott: Yeah.

479
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:50,174
Scott: Not, not, I'm not even that good at that one though.

480
00:37:50,856 --> 00:37:58,120
Scott: Um, then I would be able to legally post the video of me on that show on the GeekNights, YouTube channel, right?

481
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,390
Scott: They would let me legally do that on purpose.

482
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:00,672
Scott: Right.

483
00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:06,082
Scott: And so that's like, if you go on YouTube and you search for fool us, you start seeing results from all these different magicians channels.

484
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:10,498
Scott: So this particular one, someone posted in the forum, I hadn't seen before.

485
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:17,846
Rym: I've seen a lot because I've gone down the rabbit hole of this individual within 15 seconds of their, uh, opening video on their channel.

486
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:18,268
Rym: Yeah.

487
00:38:18,711 --> 00:38:23,916
Scott: I've watched, you know, I've gone on YouTube and watched full us performances for like an hour at some point, right?

488
00:38:23,936 --> 00:38:25,001
Scott: Just seeing a whole bunch of them.

489
00:38:25,322 --> 00:38:27,210
Scott: Um, especially the ones that fool them.

490
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,173
Scott: Cause those are the better ones.

491
00:38:28,214 --> 00:38:28,615
Rym: Oh yeah.

492
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,379
Scott: But this one, I hadn't seen someone posted it in our forum, which you should go to.

493
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:39,140
Scott: And it is a card magician, primarily a card magician named Danny Dortiz from Mexico.

494
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:45,963
Scott: And this guy is I think supposedly, and I believe it, the best living card magician, right?

495
00:38:45,983 --> 00:38:52,255
Scott: Like he was an apprentice of some other legendary card magician and as somehow the, the apprentice has surpassed the master.

496
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:53,522
Scott: I don't know if the master is still alive.

497
00:38:53,562 --> 00:39:00,795
Scott: He was an old guy, but like for like, they say that like from the age of four, Danny studied under this guy and it's like, I believe it.

498
00:39:00,915 --> 00:39:01,517
Scott: It seems true.

499
00:39:01,537 --> 00:39:03,384
Scott: There's evidence, there's photos of them together.

500
00:39:03,986 --> 00:39:07,960
Scott: Um, but this is just like a really happy jolly dude.

501
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:12,735
Scott: And usually when I watch magic, I can sort of guess how they did it.

502
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:14,421
Scott: Have some idea how they did it.

503
00:39:14,702 --> 00:39:14,943
Scott: Right.

504
00:39:15,344 --> 00:39:16,307
Scott: I have no fucking clue.

505
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:18,393
Scott: Right.

506
00:39:18,514 --> 00:39:20,440
Scott: The YouTube comments don't know how he's doing it.

507
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:21,022
Scott: Right.

508
00:39:21,303 --> 00:39:23,272
Scott: I don't know what the fuck this was going on here.

509
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:25,722
Scott: This guy just like makes a big mess out of the cards.

510
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:29,335
Scott: There's no way that he like kept them in order or sorted them.

511
00:39:29,355 --> 00:39:32,606
Scott: And then somehow it's just like unbelievable.

512
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:37,202
Scott: Um, whatever, but yeah, this guy's supposedly the best living card magician.

513
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:37,785
Scott: I believe it.

514
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:40,496
Scott: So watch it, uh, watch his YouTube video.

515
00:39:40,597 --> 00:39:42,162
Scott: The thing of the day is this YouTube channel.

516
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:47,478
Scott: And by the way, uh, if you pay him money, he has like courses.

517
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:49,424
Scott: He'll just teach you how to do this, these tricks.

518
00:39:49,545 --> 00:39:51,150
Scott: So I guess people know how they're done.

519
00:39:51,170 --> 00:40:05,242
Scott: Um, but, uh, I'm not about to pay to find out cause you know, if I didn't have a day job, the only thing I think I would use magic for if I learned it, cause I wouldn't go into a career in magic.

520
00:40:05,462 --> 00:40:06,908
Scott: You know what I would use it for?

521
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:13,020
Rym: I would use it to do little simple tricks, like at a gaming table while we're setting up a board game, like close up magic for one person.

522
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:14,042
Scott: Right.

523
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:17,234
Scott: I would do it for yet for the social aspect of it.

524
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:17,475
Scott: Right.

525
00:40:17,535 --> 00:40:21,593
Scott: It's like, I'm waiting in a line, you know, and it's like, impress the people nearby, right?

526
00:40:21,674 --> 00:40:24,384
Scott: Traveling in a foreign country, impress the children.

527
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:24,745
Scott: Right.

528
00:40:24,785 --> 00:40:36,650
Scott: It's like, that's, I think, you know, the level of magic that I would ever consider putting effort into learning, but really impressive magic takes too much effort and I'm lazy in the better moment.

529
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,653
Rym: The GeekNights book club book.

530
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:38,897
Rym: I'll leave the unseen.

531
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:42,975
Rym: I am going to start reading it this weekend because Scott admitted that he read at least one page.

532
00:40:42,995 --> 00:40:44,884
Scott: I have not read any further.

533
00:40:44,904 --> 00:40:45,808
Scott: I read the one page.

534
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:46,170
Rym: I'll leave.

535
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,962
Rym: the unseen is a middle Eastern cyberpunk adventure.

536
00:40:49,103 --> 00:40:52,215
Rym: And that's all you really need to notice to know that you should come on.

537
00:40:52,255 --> 00:40:56,876
Scott: It's like, you don't even need to say all those words to get us to read the book, right?

538
00:40:56,897 --> 00:40:57,921
Scott: You can just say a few of them.

539
00:40:59,146 --> 00:41:12,559
Rym: in an unnamed middle Eastern security state, a young Arab Indian hacker protects watched groups from surveillance and tries to stay out of trouble until he falls in love with the wrong woman and unleashes a forbidden text thought to be written by the gin.

540
00:41:15,122 --> 00:41:15,563
Rym: Oh yeah.

541
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:16,646
Rym: Love me a good gin story.

542
00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:26,392
Rym: Also, we will be live at PAX unplugged on Sunday, December 4th at 1130 AM Eastern time in the crab God theater.

543
00:41:26,793 --> 00:41:32,049
Rym: with why is this game taking four hours to play updated to?

544
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:41,229
Scott: maybe we're going to drive to Philly and we're going to drive back in the same day barring no unforeseen circumstances like, you know, a positive COVID test the day before or anything like that.

545
00:41:42,113 --> 00:41:46,510
Rym: So if you, if you want to see us there, see us on Sunday, we will not be at packs other days.

546
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:52,206
Rym: Uh, also partly because even if we wanted to, all the hotels are sold out, so we really have nothing.

547
00:41:52,386 --> 00:42:03,393
Rym: So we're just going to drive out and next year, 20, you mean 2023, 2023 Zenkai con.

548
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:04,797
Rym: I had panels all lined up.

549
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:05,560
Rym: I even have a hotel.

550
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:09,832
Rym: I wasn't paying attention because I only look at the packs.

551
00:42:10,073 --> 00:42:15,729
Rym: That is the most, uh, the next one on deck.

552
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:18,718
Rym: Pax East does not exist in my brain until December 5th.

553
00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:20,203
Rym: And yeah, Pax East over lives.

554
00:42:20,223 --> 00:42:20,765
Rym: Zenkai con.

555
00:42:20,785 --> 00:42:21,367
Rym: So sorry.

556
00:42:21,387 --> 00:42:23,154
Rym: Uh, that sucks.

557
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:24,720
Scott: These tickets just went on sale.

558
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,865
Scott: They're March something.

559
00:42:27,006 --> 00:42:27,608
Scott: You can look it up.

560
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:28,712
Scott: It's still four days.

561
00:42:29,054 --> 00:42:34,170
Scott: They're going to require masks thoroughly, but they are no longer requiring Vax.

562
00:42:34,531 --> 00:42:38,725
Scott: Uh, they make, make of that what you will sadly kind of make sense.

563
00:42:38,805 --> 00:42:44,109
Rym: Cause I gotta say having just gotten my physical New York state's, uh, database just doesn't fucking work anymore.

564
00:42:44,169 --> 00:42:45,940
Rym: There is no record of any of my boosters.

565
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,051
Rym: No, my doctor was like WTF.

566
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:50,619
Rym: And then he looked, he's like, they don't have mine either.

567
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:51,941
Scott: Right.

568
00:42:52,422 --> 00:42:55,811
Scott: Well, uh, anyway, yep.

569
00:42:56,152 --> 00:43:03,013
Rym: Otherwise, uh, of course, since in the collapse of Twitter, follow us on other places, our discord's cool or forums.

570
00:43:03,073 --> 00:43:03,334
Rym: Cool.

571
00:43:03,655 --> 00:43:07,189
Rym: You can even subscribe to my crap on Mastodon, but don't at me.

572
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:07,832
Rym: I won't see it.

573
00:43:07,872 --> 00:43:08,736
Rym: It's a one way feed.

574
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:10,462
Rym: Like we got stuff, go find it.

575
00:43:11,406 --> 00:43:11,546
Scott: Yep.

576
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,374
Scott: We're not hard to find on the internet.

577
00:43:13,414 --> 00:43:16,325
Scott: No matter how many platforms collapse, we still have our own websites.

578
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,442
Scott: I'm going to be making, I'm gonna be making some more websites soon.

579
00:43:20,462 --> 00:43:24,341
Scott: I'm working on making websites, GeekNights, website, Scott website, all kinds of websites.

580
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:24,682
Rym: Yep.

581
00:43:24,783 --> 00:43:27,191
Scott: I can't go wrong with website that doesn't get copyrighted except by lawyers.

582
00:43:32,701 --> 00:43:33,264
Rym: All right.

583
00:43:33,324 --> 00:43:34,570
Rym: So I guess let's just get right into it.

584
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:37,422
Rym: Put a little marker there in the audition for the main bit.

585
00:43:37,864 --> 00:43:39,930
Scott: We did a show order my dinner right now.

586
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:40,512
Rym: Oh yeah.

587
00:43:40,532 --> 00:43:42,819
Scott: It happens to be Chinese food.

588
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,909
Rym: We did a show back in June of 2018 on Indian food.

589
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,057
Rym: We've done many food shows over the years.

590
00:43:48,558 --> 00:43:54,580
Rym: Uh, so of course the most important disclaimer, we're two white dudes who live in New York.

591
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,932
Rym: We are not experts on Chinese cuisine in any capacity.

592
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:01,365
Rym: We're working from what we know about it and skimming Wikipedia.

593
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:06,583
Rym: And we're mostly focused on our personal enjoyment and experiences with Chinese food.

594
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:22,690
Scott: Uh, well I actually, I have, um, I have in my time studied the history of Chinese food briefly and attended and, uh, many museum, actually more than one museum exhibit about the history of Chinese food in America.

595
00:44:22,891 --> 00:44:23,132
Scott: Right.

596
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:35,416
Scott: I specifically even went to the food museum that when the entire place, which is only really, you know, it's not that big, it's like a garage, like a large garage, but the whole thing was a special Chinese food in America deal.

597
00:44:35,436 --> 00:44:43,266
Scott: Um, and I spent a lot of time there, but despite having all that knowledge, I am not a source for you to attain that knowledge.

598
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:56,864
Scott: Um, we can just summarize and say basically, you know, Chinese immigrants came to the U S primarily in California were very much, you know, persecuted, discriminated against, et cetera.

599
00:44:57,306 --> 00:44:57,606
Scott: Right.

600
00:44:58,148 --> 00:45:01,616
Scott: And ended up, you know, starting right.

601
00:45:01,997 --> 00:45:08,496
Scott: Businesses selling Chinese food, but it wasn't the Chinese food, the way it was made in China.

602
00:45:08,837 --> 00:45:09,098
Scott: Right.

603
00:45:09,399 --> 00:45:21,355
Scott: It was an Americanized version of Chinese food differing because of, you know, the pallets of American people, their expectations, all sorts of factors, ingredient availability.

604
00:45:21,576 --> 00:45:21,877
Scott: Yes.

605
00:45:21,897 --> 00:45:27,693
Scott: A various reasons they created what was a new ish style of food, right.

606
00:45:27,994 --> 00:45:30,200
Scott: A newish restaurant aesthetic, right.

607
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:37,337
Scott: That, you know, sort of simultaneously, you know, played into the racism, right.

608
00:45:37,858 --> 00:45:39,681
Scott: And the stereotypes, right.

609
00:45:40,343 --> 00:45:56,140
Scott: Um, while also providing something that was different and still delicious, but not authentic necessarily to the food that is eaten in various parts of China, which is, you can't even really say Chinese food as a, you know, a thing because every different part of China has different food.

610
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,249
Rym: And they're radically different.

611
00:45:58,269 --> 00:46:05,598
Rym: Like the parts of the food that comes from the parts of China near Mongolia is so different from like Sichuan food or the Chinese food.

612
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:07,147
Rym: You're probably imagining in your head the same way.

613
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:15,824
Scott: Like you can call McDonald's American food and it's like, yes, McDonald's is the same everywhere in America, but it's like the food in Florida is very different from the food in New York.

614
00:46:16,988 --> 00:46:27,433
Scott: It's like in New York, you got garbage plates and in Florida, you got, well, we'll let that, we'll let that be.

615
00:46:27,773 --> 00:46:28,675
Rym: But, uh, yeah.

616
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:34,610
Rym: So I grew up, uh, in like the white part of the Midwest in like very suburban area.

617
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:45,400
Rym: So until I got to college, honestly, I had only ever had American style Chinese food and Mongolian inspired Chinese food.

618
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:56,748
Scott: Because I'm going to guess that most of the places that had those foods in Michigan were places that were like Panda express chain ish places.

619
00:46:56,769 --> 00:46:58,414
Rym: Uh, the Chinese food.

620
00:46:58,455 --> 00:46:58,695
Rym: Yes.

621
00:46:59,017 --> 00:47:08,758
Rym: The Mongolian food was both chains, but there were also for just reasons in the area I live specifically, there was a lot of actual Mongolian food, like more than you just happened.

622
00:47:08,778 --> 00:47:11,632
Scott: You just happened to be near a neighborhood of Mongolian people.

623
00:47:11,712 --> 00:47:12,094
Rym: Exactly.

624
00:47:12,154 --> 00:47:18,446
Rym: Kind of like how, if you live in a certain part of Detroit, there's a lot of like really authentic Polish food, just like right there because there's a Poland town

625
00:47:18,808 --> 00:47:22,986
Scott: or in New Jersey, there's like areas you can live in New Jersey where there's just lots of Indian food.

626
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:31,758
Rym: And also it's not like major cosmopolitan cities like New York city, you can get food from almost any region on earth in that city.

627
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:32,761
Rym: It's a weird case.

628
00:47:34,005 --> 00:47:38,860
Rym: So yeah, but having Chinese food, but I didn't know a lot about it until college.

629
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:39,962
Scott: Yeah.

630
00:47:40,002 --> 00:47:41,246
Scott: So I right.

631
00:47:41,387 --> 00:47:45,200
Scott: Had family that, you know, I was born in New York city and flushing, right.

632
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,551
Scott: Even though I moved to Connecticut and I was like one, right.

633
00:47:47,812 --> 00:47:50,222
Scott: But my family was New York people, right.

634
00:47:50,564 --> 00:47:53,596
Scott: You know, only my immediate family moved to Connecticut.

635
00:47:53,636 --> 00:47:57,531
Scott: The rest of my family, extended family was still in, you know, New York, right.

636
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:58,956
Scott: New Jersey, et cetera.

637
00:47:59,277 --> 00:47:59,498
Scott: Right.

638
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,332
Scott: And no one ever left the, it was still very close to, it came to New York city often.

639
00:48:03,794 --> 00:48:04,014
Scott: Right.

640
00:48:04,034 --> 00:48:08,351
Scott: You know, so it's like Chinese restaurants are a thing in New York.

641
00:48:08,371 --> 00:48:10,359
Scott: There's like one on every block basically.

642
00:48:10,399 --> 00:48:10,600
Scott: Right.

643
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,205
Scott: It's like you can't.

644
00:48:13,448 --> 00:48:19,203
Scott: And while they're all serving, like mostly the same menu, kinda right.

645
00:48:19,484 --> 00:48:25,789
Scott: You know, with the same sort of repeating items that are mostly the same, you know, each one's a little bit different.

646
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:26,010
Rym: Yeah.

647
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:34,679
Rym: Like everyone, anyone who lives in New York city has like a mental map of the standard American Chinese food places near them.

648
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:37,112
Rym: And like, they're ranked by like, which what's the good one.

649
00:48:37,173 --> 00:48:38,360
Rym: What's the one that's open late.

650
00:48:38,641 --> 00:48:41,269
Rym: What's the bad one to never hit the order from.

651
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:41,611
Rym: Yeah.

652
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:46,266
Scott: So if you're in an area that's like outside of New York city, right.

653
00:48:46,346 --> 00:48:50,739
Scott: Most where there isn't, you know, a dense Chinese population, right.

654
00:48:51,382 --> 00:48:55,840
Scott: You're going to get just that sort of, you know, Americanized Chinese restaurant, right.

655
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,144
Scott: You're in Connecticut.

656
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:57,866
Scott: We were in beacon.

657
00:48:57,907 --> 00:48:59,251
Scott: We had one upstate.

658
00:48:59,292 --> 00:48:59,854
Scott: We had one.

659
00:49:00,797 --> 00:49:02,464
Scott: Um, you know, they're there.

660
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:04,495
Scott: I mean, there were, there were some Rochester too, right.

661
00:49:04,515 --> 00:49:07,630
Scott: It's like they reach pretty far away from New York city, right.

662
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:12,536
Scott: California has them, but you know, the, the, the ones in New York are just like, there's a certain style to them.

663
00:49:12,556 --> 00:49:14,205
Scott: Like they had the same menu, right.

664
00:49:14,225 --> 00:49:15,912
Scott: They're all getting like their fortune.

665
00:49:15,932 --> 00:49:17,700
Scott: cookies all come from this one factory.

666
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,307
Scott: They're all in the same wrapper, right.

667
00:49:19,468 --> 00:49:28,004
Scott: It's like, you know, the egg rolls I think are all my, you'll get like the same egg roll, like a lot of them, because I think they're like centrally manufactured, right.

668
00:49:28,044 --> 00:49:32,829
Scott: Some places are making their own, but it's like, there are certain things that are just like the same at all of these places.

669
00:49:33,051 --> 00:49:42,792
Rym: Now, you know, by different people, what does sort of side that I sort of remember from my childhood, the era of Uber Eats and grub hub and all that stuff is relatively new to America.

670
00:49:42,832 --> 00:49:48,338
Rym: When I was growing up, there were only two kinds of food that you could get delivered to a house in the suburbs.

671
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:49,704
Scott: Oh, we didn't get delivered.

672
00:49:49,845 --> 00:49:53,242
Scott: We would order it on the phone and then my dad would drive out and get it and bring it back.

673
00:49:53,262 --> 00:49:58,584
Rym: We could get Chinese food delivered and we could get pizza delivered and nothing else.

674
00:49:58,604 --> 00:50:02,021
Scott: I mean, I'm sure we could have gotten it delivered, but it's like, we just didn't.

675
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:03,408
Scott: We always went out to go get it.

676
00:50:03,448 --> 00:50:13,766
Rym: But like Chinese food, American style Chinese food and pizza were like the only two foods in my entire childhood that were commonly and easily ordered for delivery to your house.

677
00:50:14,729 --> 00:50:21,874
Scott: We would also, right, it's like some of the restaurants are clearly takeout or primarily takeout, like they have a tiny little seating area, right.

678
00:50:22,235 --> 00:50:26,573
Scott: But there were some that had seating and like we would go and eat at them.

679
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:29,749
Scott: The food wouldn't be any different, but it's like you would just go and do that.

680
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:38,426
Rym: We'd go eat at the Mongolian places, but we only ate at, I only really ate at Chinese restaurants regularly when we got to RIT and we'd go to China Gate pretty often late at night.

681
00:50:38,968 --> 00:50:43,486
Scott: Well, most of the time we would eat at one would be on, you know, Christmas, right, where you go.

682
00:50:43,526 --> 00:50:45,775
Scott: Chinese food movie situation, right.

683
00:50:45,896 --> 00:50:47,664
Scott: And you had more people, right.

684
00:50:47,704 --> 00:50:54,310
Scott: And then when you have more people and you go to one of these places, you could order and share instead of just getting the one entree for yourself, right.

685
00:50:55,213 --> 00:50:55,855
Scott: And that was nice.

686
00:50:56,817 --> 00:51:07,691
Rym: So I guess in terms of the Chinese food I like, like jumping ahead to that, I think Szechuan cooking is my favorite regional like type of food from that area.

687
00:51:07,711 --> 00:51:11,401
Rym: I just, I like all Szechuan dishes just about.

688
00:51:11,742 --> 00:51:13,967
Rym: I like the Szechuan spices.

689
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:18,237
Rym: That's my go-to, by default, bar none.

690
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:28,780
Scott: Yeah, I mean, well if you're talking, you know, authentic Chinese food, which is available in New York City, right, in Chinatown and Flushing and LIC, which is now becoming the third Chinatown.

691
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:38,980
Rym: Yeah, there are already like, there are five Chinese restaurants near us I can think of that are authentic to specific regions, only opening in the last four or five years.

692
00:51:40,241 --> 00:51:45,142
Scott: It's like, you know, if you're talking about the real Chinese food, it's like nothing beats the dim sum.

693
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:47,570
Scott: The dim sum is the champion, right.

694
00:51:48,413 --> 00:51:51,362
Rym: Of course, even that can have a lot of regional variation.

695
00:51:51,904 --> 00:51:54,753
Scott: It does, but it's like it really doesn't matter which variation it is.

696
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:57,403
Scott: I'll take any dim sum you've got.

697
00:51:57,483 --> 00:52:09,791
Rym: My favorite style of dim sum, and I could not articulate in detail all the differences because I don't know, but in my experience I have always particularly enjoyed what people will describe as Hong Kong style dim sum.

698
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:22,402
Rym: It might be a byproduct of the fact that I've spent a lot of time in Hong Kong, and I would go get dim sum there a lot, and it is different from the dim sum I get anywhere else, including the really authentic places like in New York City that we'd go to.

699
00:52:23,024 --> 00:52:26,296
Scott: Well, sadly, the one, the mega big, you know, what the Jinfeng.

700
00:52:26,456 --> 00:52:28,364
Rym: Oh my god, I'm so sad about that.

701
00:52:28,384 --> 00:52:30,755
Scott: That one closed during the pandemic, that one.

702
00:52:30,775 --> 00:52:31,660
Scott: I went there many times.

703
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:31,880
Scott: I

704
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:47,835
Rym: remember my first experience with dim sum was at RIT when Mike took us all out, and we went to the dim sum place in Rochester, and he ordered everything for us, and I'd never had that style of Chinese food before, and I remember being weirdly obsessed with the egg custard.

705
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:59,573
Scott: Yeah, I mean, well that was, you know, that was also the first time I had it, right, because it's like, you know, somehow Rochester just happened to have one of those, one or two of those places, right, and it's like we didn't have that in Connecticut.

706
00:52:59,613 --> 00:53:05,640
Rym: Yeah, and if you've never been to one of those places, like the way they're formatted typically, even in Hong Kong, they're formatted like this.

707
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:18,085
Rym: Imagine a big banquet hall, like the kind of hall you go to for like the school math awards or something, like the band night or something like that, or a wedding, and it's just filled with tables.

708
00:53:18,566 --> 00:53:19,469
Rym: The tables are huge.

709
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,956
Rym: They'll seat like 8 to 16 people,

710
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:25,669
Scott: right, like a circular table that has like 10 plus seats at it,

711
00:53:26,051 --> 00:53:30,511
Rym: and if you come in, they will just sit you down at a table with other people, and carts, unless

712
00:53:30,531 --> 00:53:32,239
Scott: you got 10 people, and you can fill up the whole table,

713
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,584
Rym: and carts will just roll

714
00:53:33,624 --> 00:53:33,985
Scott: around,

715
00:53:34,346 --> 00:53:46,317
Rym: and you basically just wave at people and flag them down and ask for specific dishes that you want, and at the end of the night, at the end of the time when you're done eating, they will just come over and have a bill of all the food you already

716
00:53:46,337 --> 00:53:46,558
Scott: missed.

717
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:46,920
Scott: You missed.

718
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:51,255
Scott: the important part is that on your table is a piece of paper, right, and so what.

719
00:53:51,295 --> 00:54:19,087
Scott: they push carts around with food, and you look at the cart, and you tell them which items from the cart you would like, and as soon as when they add items from their cart to your table, they pick up the piece of paper, and they mark down that what your table has taken those items, and then when you're done, they look at that piece of paper, and they see, you know, which items you bought at which price points, and then they charge you, right, so you basically you eat until you're not hungry anymore, so you never buy too much or not enough food.

720
00:54:19,127 --> 00:54:22,478
Scott: with this, you know, situation, right?

721
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:35,099
Scott: The only difficulty is that like you might like see an item and get it, not knowing what it is, or not liking it, or which I was always down for my because I didn't know about Chinese food.

722
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:41,100
Rym: when I first encountered dim sum, my philosophy was I will try anything, and they're pushing it around.

723
00:54:41,301 --> 00:54:49,860
Scott: If they're pushing it around and offering it to you, it's edible, and someone likes it, so I might like it, so I basically didn't actually learn the names of a lot of the dishes I would eat.

724
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:57,397
Rym: I learned to recognize things I particularly liked, but I would just point at random stuff, and it was almost always great, and the few things that weren't...

725
00:54:57,417 --> 00:54:59,387
Scott: If it wasn't good, why would they be pushing it around?

726
00:54:59,407 --> 00:55:01,579
Scott: They would try to push around what, bad tasting food?

727
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:02,304
Scott: Why would they do that?

728
00:55:02,324 --> 00:55:02,928
Scott: They're a restaurant.

729
00:55:02,948 --> 00:55:04,538
Scott: That doesn't seem like a good business idea.

730
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:16,825
Rym: I mean, I don't particularly like cartilage, and I don't particularly like intestines, like those foods I don't like, but I have tried them at dim sum places, and sometimes I've even gotten them and realized until it was too late.

731
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:20,197
Rym: It was totally fine, just not my preferred dish.

732
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:32,802
Scott: The only downside is that you might get some items, whatever's getting come around, but then you won't realize the full extent of what could be out there, and it's like you learned there are certain items.

733
00:55:33,324 --> 00:55:44,486
Scott: after you go a few times, you learn there's certain foods you really want, and it's like if you just buy the first carts that come to you, you'll be full, and then later on the cart with the thing you wanted comes.

734
00:55:44,506 --> 00:55:45,088
Rym: It's like, "No, I'm

735
00:55:45,129 --> 00:55:45,470
Rym: full!".

736
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:49,307
Rym: Yup, like the little sesame buns filled with red bean come around.

737
00:55:49,428 --> 00:55:55,956
Scott: Right, like if you really want an egg custard, it's like, "Well, you better not fill yourself up before an egg custard cart appears," right?

738
00:55:56,016 --> 00:55:56,920
Scott: And will one appear?

739
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,523
Scott: You don't know.

740
00:55:57,764 --> 00:55:58,428
Scott: Maybe there won't.

741
00:55:58,548 --> 00:55:59,292
Scott: Who knows, right?

742
00:55:59,312 --> 00:56:02,486
Scott: You might be able to... You can sometimes ask for items specifically too.

743
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:09,031
Scott: There'll be like a waiter or waitress will come, and you can be like, "I want this specific thing," right?

744
00:56:09,171 --> 00:56:13,167
Scott: And maybe there's no carts pushing that thing around, but someone will make it for you and bring it out anyway.

745
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:13,508
Scott: Yup.

746
00:56:15,254 --> 00:56:19,896
Rym: See, in dim sum, pretty much any kind of shumai dumpling, like I don't even care what's in it, I'll just get...

747
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:21,566
Scott: You can't go wrong with anything that looks like a dumpling.

748
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:25,387
Rym: Anything that looks even remotely dumpling adjacent, I'll pretty much just eat, and it's always great.

749
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:26,290
Scott: Yeah.

750
00:56:26,732 --> 00:56:33,659
Scott: All right, so in terms of the Americanized takeout Chinese food, right, the go-to items, right, is I gotta have the wonton soup.

751
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:41,165
Scott: I'm all about the wonton soup, because you get, with the wonton soup, you get the combo of dumplings and soup, right?

752
00:56:41,506 --> 00:56:51,869
Scott: You know, it's not the soup dumplings, there's like a special item, right, that are hard to eat, and you can't really deliver those, and, you know, they're delicious, but they're also not... You can't eat those too often.

753
00:56:51,929 --> 00:56:56,025
Rym: I usually throw my fried wonton strips, like those little guys, into my soup.

754
00:56:56,968 --> 00:56:57,971
Scott: Yeah, that's what they're for.

755
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,668
Scott: But, you know, some places the wonton soup just isn't good, right?

756
00:57:02,688 --> 00:57:06,503
Scott: You know, it's like the broth should be like really rich, right?

757
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:09,355
Scott: And the wontons themselves should have like a lot of flavor.

758
00:57:09,395 --> 00:57:17,950
Scott: Sometimes, like there's a bad place in our neighborhood, and it's like all their food doesn't taste like anything, but the wontons specifically, it's like they don't taste like anything.

759
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:19,276
Scott: Like there's no flavor at all.

760
00:57:19,698 --> 00:57:20,943
Scott: The soup might as well be water.

761
00:57:20,963 --> 00:57:35,316
Rym: Remember the time we were at Beacon playing Burning Wheel with the whole crew, and a bunch of our friends who weren't from the area went to the Chinese place that was across the street from Alex's apartment, because they were like, "Well, it's close.

762
00:57:35,337 --> 00:57:35,819
Rym: How bad could it

763
00:57:35,859 --> 00:57:35,940
Rym: be?".

764
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:46,805
Rym: And they poo-pooed you and me, who went to the other place on the other side of town that had good Chinese food, and I remember I tried some of the food that they had all gotten, and it tasted like nothing.

765
00:57:47,648 --> 00:57:47,868
Scott: Yep.

766
00:57:48,571 --> 00:57:50,778
Scott: It's like all these places, you know, they're not... It's not like.

767
00:57:50,898 --> 00:57:55,640
Scott: there are some chains, like, you know, Panda Express, but for the most part, like these places are not chains.

768
00:57:56,041 --> 00:58:00,103
Scott: They're all owned by different people, but they're sort of all operating from the same playbook, the same way.

769
00:58:00,123 --> 00:58:09,502
Scott: that like laundromats, dry cleaners, these other sorts of small businesses, you know, bodegas, mostly operate from the same playbook with some amount of variation, right?

770
00:58:09,702 --> 00:58:16,718
Scott: But some of them, it's like, you'll know wherever you live, you'll have a few of them, and you try them all usually, or you talk to people and you find out.

771
00:58:16,758 --> 00:58:18,887
Scott: It's like, yeah, one of them is going to be better than the other ones.

772
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:19,710
Rym: Yep.

773
00:58:20,473 --> 00:58:25,589
Scott: I know a particularly good one out in, like, Regal Park area of New York, right?

774
00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:27,897
Scott: Oh, is my food here that quickly?

775
00:58:28,058 --> 00:58:28,419
Rym: Oh, wow.

776
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:29,701
Rym: It's got some Chinese food.

777
00:58:34,226 --> 00:58:39,234
Rym: So the listener has described soup dumplings as the heron spear of Chinese food, and I cannot disagree.

778
00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:42,284
Rym: I really like soup dumplings.

779
00:58:42,425 --> 00:58:46,558
Rym: I'll even eat, like, the chain soup dumplings because you really can't go wrong with them.

780
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,590
Rym: Actually, I have... So I was just...

781
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:59,429
Scott: If you're curious how long it takes for Chinese food to be delivered, I click the button sometime during things of the day, like when things of the day were over and the food just got here.

782
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:02,142
Scott: So that's how long it takes to click a button and get Chinese food.

783
00:59:02,303 --> 00:59:02,564
Rym: Yep.

784
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:03,770
Rym: I'm not even editing that out.

785
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:04,655
Rym: I was chatting with the listener.

786
00:59:04,715 --> 00:59:09,696
Rym: The listener said, we were talking about soup dumplings in the chat, the heron spear of Chinese food.

787
00:59:11,121 --> 00:59:11,562
Scott: Perhaps.

788
00:59:11,843 --> 00:59:12,546
Scott: Perhaps it is.

789
00:59:12,566 --> 00:59:15,355
Rym: Well, because they're great, but they're only great if you get them fresh.

790
00:59:15,857 --> 00:59:21,134
Rym: Like, if you don't eat a soup dumpling within about 45 seconds of it coming to your table, you're effed.

791
00:59:22,298 --> 00:59:23,442
Scott: Yeah.

792
00:59:23,763 --> 00:59:27,574
Scott: It's a special, it's like a special, luxurious treat kind of deal.

793
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:31,506
Rym: At American Chinese places, I like the crab rangoon.

794
00:59:31,706 --> 00:59:33,372
Rym: Like, I will eat that crab rangoon.

795
00:59:33,392 --> 00:59:35,500
Rym: That's something I actually specifically really like.

796
00:59:35,521 --> 00:59:40,196
Rym: I like, and I like wontons, like, pretty much any sort of wonton-y thing.

797
00:59:40,216 --> 00:59:42,181
Rym: Yep.

798
00:59:42,542 --> 00:59:47,502
Scott: When it comes to the entree, I'll usually, I'll go for, you know, the things that are really popular, right?

799
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,870
Scott: It's like, they're popular for a reason.

800
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:55,515
Scott: The General Tso chicken, the sesame chicken, chicken with cashew nut, you know, some pepper beef kind of deal.

801
00:59:55,575 --> 00:59:57,865
Rym: I'll do, I'll do the pepper beef or like a lo mein.

802
00:59:58,026 --> 00:59:59,733
Rym: Lo mein's my, like, lo mein dish.

803
01:00:00,315 --> 01:00:00,596
Scott: Yep.

804
01:00:00,817 --> 01:00:02,784
Scott: Any kind of noodle deal, fried rice deal.

805
01:00:03,086 --> 01:00:03,347
Scott: Yep.

806
01:00:03,447 --> 01:00:04,250
Scott: All that kind of stuff.

807
01:00:04,591 --> 01:00:06,798
Scott: I love the, I love the egg roll, right?

808
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:07,421
Scott: Yeah.

809
01:00:07,842 --> 01:00:07,942
Rym: Yeah.

810
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:08,745
Rym: That's just a soup.

811
01:00:09,227 --> 01:00:12,397
Rym: Assume if I'm at a Chinese place, the egg roll came and I ate it already.

812
01:00:12,418 --> 01:00:13,641
Rym: Yep.

813
01:00:14,946 --> 01:00:31,547
Scott: Uh, you know, I like anything that's got like a big pile of vegetables, like water chestnuts and, and, you know, snow peas and all that biz, you know, tiny mushrooms and tiny corns and all the, all those guys, carrots, you know, celeries, all that biz in there, right?

814
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:32,470
Scott: And some kind of sauce.

815
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:35,095
Scott: Any one of those is fine.

816
01:00:36,058 --> 01:00:48,439
Rym: But really in terms of more authentic Chinese food, I was thinking real hard during this whole show, it's hard to beat Szechuan for me, partly because that is the style of Chinese food that has the, the numbing spice.

817
01:00:49,462 --> 01:00:53,875
Rym: And there's a lot of like dried out fish type things, a lot of salt.

818
01:00:53,895 --> 01:00:56,905
Rym: Like it just, it speaks to my, Oh God, I'm drooling.

819
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:58,230
Rym: Literally just drooled.

820
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:05,662
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

821
01:01:05,702 --> 01:01:10,864
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

822
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:16,124
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

823
01:01:16,365 --> 01:01:19,036
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

824
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:23,797
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays, and indiscriminate Thursdays.

825
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:28,134
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a creative commons attribution 3.0 license.

826
01:01:28,556 --> 01:01:31,646
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

827
01:01:31,847 --> 01:01:34,735
Scott: But unlike those other late shows it's actually recorded at night.

828
01:01:35,497 --> 01:01:41,793
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of Happy Communist.

829
01:01:42,054 --> 01:01:45,525
Rym: A bunch of people who really don't want me to say their names.

830
01:01:45,926 --> 01:01:47,030
Rym: Case care makes music.

831
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:54,913
Rym: Chris Haddad, Chris Raimond, Clinton Walton, Dex Finn, Joel Hayes, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Harl.

832
01:01:55,174 --> 01:01:56,600
Rym: Stop all the downloading.

833
01:01:56,881 --> 01:02:01,294
Rym: And several people whose names I will not say at their request who are very correctly giving us just $1.

834
01:02:01,294 --> 01:02:05,741
Rym: So yeah, we're still continuing to be on our.

835
01:02:11,673 --> 01:02:22,716
Rym: I will simply leave you with... I did it.

836
01:02:23,097 --> 01:02:25,808
Rym: Second in line and all I had to do was miss eight days of work.

837
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:28,378
Scott: With the money you would have made work and you could have bought tickets from a scalper.

838
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:29,402
Scott: In theory, yes.

839
01:02:29,984 --> 01:02:30,205
Scott: Sure.

840
01:02:31,129 --> 01:02:32,997
Scott: Give me thirty thousand tickets.

841
01:02:33,419 --> 01:02:35,690
Rym: That'll be nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars please.

842
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:38,643
Scott: Look the thing about that is I only got ten dollars on me.

843
01:02:38,663 --> 01:02:39,668
