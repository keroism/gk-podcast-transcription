1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,440
Scott:

2
00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:10,066
Rym: It's Thursday, May 26th, 2022.

3
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:14,700
Rym: I'm Rym, and I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,468
Rym: Tonight, we talk about trains.

5
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:19,313
Rym: Choo-choo.

6
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:20,376
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:25,940
Rym: We have only talked about trains once before.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,279
Scott: We've talked about a lot of trains on this show.

9
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:37,193
Rym: I'm not talking train games, but I want to point out that on October 23rd, 2013, we talked about Take the X Train.

10
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:38,820
Scott: That was an anime, yeah.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,680
Rym: That was the only show that had the word "train" in it.

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,960
Rym: Even the reviews of 18xx games don't actually say "train" anywhere in the title of the GeekNights episode.

13
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,300
Scott: Yeah, that's, you know, that's how it goes.

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,280
Scott: But yeah, I'm surprised, you know, there's some things that are just so obvious.

15
00:00:54,441 --> 00:01:01,960
Scott: Like, we had to have done an episode on that, and then of course I go and I search, and I find out, yup, it was Rym deleted that episode because it was such an obvious one.

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,980
Scott: I'll put some protections in the new website to make sure this doesn't happen anymore.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:19,040
Rym: You get to the point, I mean, I just sort of assume, any idea I have for a GeekNights episode, my brain just says, we've definitely already done that, probably in like 2007.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,800
Rym: But some things we just never got to, or some things we zoomed way in and never talked about the topic.

19
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:35,239
Scott: Alright, well, the people who are for some reason watching a podcast, even though there's nothing to frickin' see, we have no visual content, really.

20
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:42,560
Rym: I do show my web browser and what I'm looking at while we're talking, so the listener knows when I'm just reading Wikipedia, usually.

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:43,924
Scott: Okay, good.

22
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:45,599
Scott: That's usually what we do on this show.

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:53,620
Scott: And the people listening, which is, I guess, you still shouldn't do that because the podcast isn't worth listening to, but if you're, you know, that's the correct way to, anyway.

24
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:58,720
Scott: May or may not notice, I bought a new microphone, right?

25
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,940
Scott: You know, it showed up immediately when I ordered it because that's how professional audio/video places do.

26
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,000
Scott: You know, you order from them and they're like, oh, they must have like a concert tomorrow.

27
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,380
Scott: We gotta get it to them stat, right?

28
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,160
Rym: And I can say that Scott sounds better through the Discord we use to record GeekNights.

29
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:16,580
Rym: It was noticeable, and I'm gonna do a little spectral analysis.

30
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,200
Rym: I'll post it for the Patreon patrons, a little, I'm gonna do an analysis of Scott's old microphone versus this one.

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,960
Rym: That'll be really easy to do.

32
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:32,040
Scott: The reason I bought this one wasn't necessarily for its sound quality, even though I hope the sound quality is better because it costs more money than the old microphone, but really I bought it for the ergonomics, right?

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,080
Scott: So you can see this feature where the XLR connector is separated from the microphone.

34
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,580
Scott: So you can adjust the microphone's position without tugging on the XLR cable.

35
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:41,378
Scott: So that's really great.

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,899
Scott: You know, it hangs downwards, you know, as opposed to pointing straight in.

37
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:48,040
Scott: So now that means I can sit differently.

38
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:49,960
Scott: I can move the arm differently.

39
00:02:50,182 --> 00:02:51,819
Scott: It's better on my neck and such.

40
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:56,900
Scott: And because it has this built-in windscreen, which I might replace with even the big daddy windscreen.

41
00:02:57,582 --> 00:02:58,399
Scott: We'll see about that.

42
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,397
Rym: That thing is so big.

43
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:02,719
Scott: It is laughably large.

44
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:06,420
Scott: But that means I don't need the windscreen blocking my face.

45
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,600
Scott: So if for some reason someone really wants to see my face in bald head, I'm not hiding behind a black disc anymore.

46
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:20,620
Scott: But actually, you know, all those things aside, this microphone came with a feature I did not expect and greatly enjoy.

47
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:28,360
Scott: And might cause me to buy the microphone again or maybe return it and keep buying new ones if I could get away with it.

48
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,413
Scott: Is that this microphone has the smell of a brand new NES cartridge.

49
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,184
Scott: Ooh!

50
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:40,719
Scott: Mmm, it smells good.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,200
Rym: If someone can make a cologne that smells like that accurately, they'll be a billionaire.

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,649
Scott: I'll order it right now.

53
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:47,880
Scott: Let's see, does that exist?

54
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:49,679
Rym: If it exists, I'm buying it too.

55
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,515
Scott: Cologne.

56
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:57,519
Scott: The Legend of Zelda NES cartridge air freshener.

57
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,999
Rym: Nah, there's no way.

58
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,020
Scott: Den-e-nes very gentle cologne.

59
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,059
Scott: That's baby cologne.

60
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,279
Rym: I'm looking for perfume instead, just in case.

61
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,359
Scott: Game on.

62
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:09,938
Scott: What is this?

63
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:15,320
Rym: I don't think anyone has... Wait, there's NES soap, but it doesn't look like it smells like an NES.

64
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,759
Scott: NES cartridge coaster.

65
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,499
Scott: No, that's not it.

66
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:20,099
Scott: Cologne, not coasters.

67
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,160
Rym: You know, the problem is, to make that smell, it probably consists of carcinogens.

68
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,760
Scott: Of course, it's some kind of plastic box.

69
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:31,420
Rym: Lots of volatile organic compounds.

70
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,700
Scott: I mean, cinnamon is a volatile organic compound, right?

71
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,716
Scott: So don't come at me with that kind of nonsense.

72
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,600
Rym: It's a pretty good microphone.

73
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:43,020
Scott: Yeah, it's an ancient microphone.

74
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,577
Scott: This microphone's been in production since the 70s, right?

75
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:48,812
Rym: Not quite as long as the SM57.

76
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:57,319
Rym: Up until this point at home, you were using the same microphone that Lyndon Baines Johnson used as president of the United States.

77
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,340
Scott: Well, I think the reason they don't use this one is because it would look kind of silly when you're standing at a lectern.

78
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:03,204
Rym: Oh, yeah.

79
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:09,920
Rym: I remember, I was trying to figure... Because we bought the SM57 because the president used it, of course it's good enough.

80
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,748
Rym: And it was cheap.

81
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:11,599
Rym: It was way cheaper than the SM57.

82
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:12,279
Scott: It is good enough.

83
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:24,060
Rym: But then we discovered, when I did some research, because I finally figured out why the president of the United States used that microphone from Lyndon Baines Johnson to Barack Obama.

84
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,443
Rym: Pure aesthetics.

85
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:34,800
Rym: The SM58 would have been better at being the president's microphone, but someone thought the 57 looked better on TV and film.

86
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:37,880
Rym: That was the sole determination.

87
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:38,743
Scott: Oh, yeah.

88
00:05:38,763 --> 00:05:42,916
Scott: But for anyone who can't see, this is the one I got, is the Shure SM7B.

89
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,500
Scott: And I expect there's really no upgrading from this.

90
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,220
Scott: Like, this is the... I podcasted for 16 years, it doesn't look like we're going to stop.

91
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:07,397
Rym: So the microphones you've used for GeekNights, not counting the Logitech stick microphone and those shitty radio shacks in the early days, we used the SM57, then we upgraded, and Scott was using, I think, a beta 58A.

92
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,639
Rym: And then eventually I started using the beta 87A, and now Scott's on this, which is weirdly enough...

93
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:20,619
Scott: I was using the 57 again when I started podcasting from my apartment.

94
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:30,179
Rym: Also, I had to get the beta 58A that you were using repaired because the inside of it rusted from so many years of podcasting.

95
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,400
Scott: Well, I don't think that happened to this one.

96
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,240
Rym: I don't think so.

97
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,140
Scott: Because the shape of it, it's not going to happen, right?

98
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,840
Rym: Yeah, but I don't think there's going to be a better microphone for you because we're not recording music.

99
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,820
Scott: I don't think there's a better microphone just for podcasting, period.

100
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,308
Scott: It's like, what can you possibly get?

101
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:47,280
Scott: that would, you know, why?

102
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:58,460
Rym: I mean, other than highly specialized things like things for on a stage or like a bad acoustic environment, but it's a pretty good looking microphone, pretty good sounding microphone.

103
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:08,560
Rym: But I will post some screenshots of the differences between the two in a spectral analysis because I do have to remake the GeekNights pipeline, at least the Scott part of the pipeline, to make sure the audio levels mix in nicely.

104
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:12,399
Rym: And I've got to change the noise profile because I have an old noise profile for you.

105
00:07:12,902 --> 00:07:16,280
Rym: But yeah, that's just part of what it takes to make a podcast.

106
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:23,200
Rym: In the news, of course, there were so many mass shootings, like, we don't even need to talk about them.

107
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:27,440
Scott: But there is a- You know, the onion story, just, you know, roll it again, right?

108
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:28,380
Rym: No way to prevent this.

109
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,260
Scott: No way to prevent this says only country where this regularly happens.

110
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,400
Rym: So what I want to talk about is an orthogonal story that broke today.

111
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,580
Rym: And this is not even related to the three mass shootings that happened in the last few days.

112
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:56,059
Rym: This is a sea change in what kills children in the United States because as of now, guns kill more American kids than cars do.

113
00:07:57,661 --> 00:08:01,420
Rym: That is a huge statistic.

114
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:11,320
Scott: Of course, they're only counting children who died because they were directly hit by a car or were in a car when the car crashed.

115
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:20,880
Rym: Oh yeah, that doesn't even count all the kids who die as the externalities of air pollution from cars, stress from cars, lack of access to a car because there aren't any other ways to get around in most of America.

116
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,659
Scott: I mean, you could think about it this way, right?

117
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,120
Scott: There's so many ways a car can indirectly kill a child, right?

118
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:35,260
Scott: Maybe their parents die in a car crash and now the child is unsupported and orphaned and then because of that, they die from something else, right?

119
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:48,099
Scott: It's like that would never show up in the statistics as the kid died because of a car crash even though if it was not a car dominant society, the child would be alive and so forth.

120
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,380
Scott: You can think of so many such scenarios.

121
00:08:51,681 --> 00:09:03,700
Rym: But this speaks to a broader point about America and the Republican Party in America and it ties into not just this problem but also what happened with COVID and what happens with car deaths and everything.

122
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:21,640
Rym: There has been a conservative strategy in America for decades that is continuing to bear fruit where you normalize something that shouldn't be normalized and once you get it to the point to where people assume they can't do anything about it, they stop trying to do anything about it and then you win.

123
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,927
Rym: That happened with cars.

124
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:24,480
Rym: I've talked to them on the gig nights before.

125
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,380
Rym: Every other weekend or so, Emily and I go hiking or camping like way upstate.

126
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:39,240
Rym: so we drive out of the city in a car and I have seen what is clearly a fatal collision probably five times on those trips.

127
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,812
Rym: Five times in three years?

128
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:41,760
Rym: That's terrifying.

129
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:48,496
Rym: On average, one person dies per day just on those roads and yet that's not a major news story.

130
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:49,100
Rym: That's endemic.

131
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:52,160
Rym: Most people just accept that as part of the world.

132
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,398
Rym: They don't think that hard about it or they rationalize it as cars.

133
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,584
Rym: You need a car.

134
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:58,359
Rym: What are you going to do without a car?

135
00:09:58,379 --> 00:09:58,480
Scott: COVID.

136
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:00,490
Scott: And these deaths, right?

137
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:02,180
Scott: I mean, everyone's going to die.

138
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,447
Scott: It's a premature death.

139
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:05,136
Scott: Someone dies before they had to.

140
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,080
Scott: They could have had a longer, better life and brought more joy.

141
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,446
Rym: How many human years.

142
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:12,540
Rym: do cars just erase from the world?

143
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:20,700
Scott: But it's different from, you know, it's like if you die because of lightning, it's like, well, it's like, yeah, there's nothing we can really do about that.

144
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,420
Scott: You know, it's like, you know, we can have lightning rods and stuff.

145
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,305
Rym: Which we do.

146
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:26,180
Rym: We require lightning rods on buildings.

147
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:27,820
Rym: Like we teach kids about lightning.

148
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,520
Scott: Lightning is going to kill people and we can't stop lightning from happening.

149
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:39,080
Scott: But cars are, you know, the transportation infrastructure is purely something that we have.

150
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,660
Scott: It is of our own making.

151
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:46,300
Scott: And it is entirely within human power to dictate all the terms of it.

152
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:50,720
Scott: It's not the laws of physics where it's like, well, nothing we can do about that third law.

153
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:52,104
Scott: It's like, right?

154
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:56,000
Scott: Every human law can be anything, right?

155
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,082
Scott: You know, it's like.

156
00:10:57,563 --> 00:11:15,620
Scott: people, I think, lack imagination because they're always focused on the reality of what the government is, what the current laws are and how hard it is to change them based on, you know, what country you live in and what you're, you know, whether you're democracy, autocracy or whatever.

157
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:16,402
Scott: Right.

158
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:19,517
Scott: But laws can be anything.

159
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:20,040
Scott: Right.

160
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:27,600
Scott: You could if you made a new country, you know, it's like you could any idea that you could have could be the law.

161
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,879
Rym: Might not be a good idea.

162
00:11:29,883 --> 00:11:30,629
Scott: No, no, no.

163
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,920
Scott: But it's like it could be anything.

164
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:41,260
Rym: That's why the language I like to use around this is to say that every person in America who dies by car, that was a choice made by society.

165
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,819
Rym: Society chose to kill that person.

166
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,326
Scott: Yeah.

167
00:11:44,428 --> 00:11:44,976
Scott: Indirectly.

168
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:45,180
Scott: Right.

169
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:51,040
Scott: Or even if they didn't chose to kill them, you could say that they didn't care.

170
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,448
Scott: They allowed.

171
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:53,759
Scott: They just didn't care.

172
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,700
Scott: Or, you know, they chose to, you know, allow for the conditions in which that occurred.

173
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:03,386
Rym: So, you know, the same thing.

174
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:06,396
Scott: There's no however you want to however you want to put it.

175
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:07,540
Scott: None of them are good.

176
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:14,380
Rym: So the same thing is happening with covid as covid becomes like to the point where it's just going to be endemic.

177
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:17,740
Rym: That was kind of the strategy from the right all along.

178
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:23,460
Rym: Make it an unsolvable problem so that people stop trying to solve it and just I almost said live with it.

179
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,548
Rym: But of course, it kills people.

180
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:25,777
Rym: just accept it.

181
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:41,640
Rym: And the fascinating thing is that there is a scant argument for at least cars and covid in the current environment that it's very difficult to deal with them for a lot of practical reasons.

182
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,680
Rym: That's not to say we shouldn't have tried and shouldn't still try, but there's a lot of practical reasons to slow that down.

183
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:55,200
Rym: But guns are different in that nobody needs a gun to get to their like to drive to to get to school like guns.

184
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:56,908
Scott: Right.

185
00:12:56,928 --> 00:12:58,900
Scott: These other systems that we have.

186
00:12:59,061 --> 00:12:59,342
Scott: Right.

187
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:03,920
Scott: It's like we, you know, we need a transportation system, how you want to design it.

188
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:04,683
Scott: Right.

189
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:07,840
Scott: How, you know, how it functions, who pays for it, et cetera.

190
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:10,080
Scott: Those all those things can be discussed.

191
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,180
Scott: But I don't think anyone's going to say we don't need any transportation technology deployed in any means.

192
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,537
Scott: Everyone will just walk or run everywhere with their own ability.

193
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,799
Rym: There is one guy on a fixie with a whistle and lots of tattoos who says that.

194
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:25,000
Rym: right.

195
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:31,120
Scott: Society can't society cannot function without some sort of, you know, transportation technologies.

196
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:37,740
Scott: And as soon as you have transportation systems, they need some sort of governance or regulation to prevent chaos.

197
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,341
Scott: Right.

198
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:40,100
Scott: Whatever, whatever technologies they are.

199
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:45,520
Scott: Even if we invented teleporters, we would need some sort of, you know, federal teleportation authority.

200
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,420
Rym: Even in Star Trek, the Federation has the concept of credits.

201
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:55,300
Rym: So some jackass doesn't just constantly teleport everywhere all the time at everyone else's expense.

202
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:56,563
Scott: Right.

203
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,930
Scott: Like, oh, I'm never going to walk.

204
00:13:58,111 --> 00:13:59,780
Scott: If I have to move two feet, I'll teleport.

205
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:05,980
Scott: I'll teleport to the counter to get my snack and then to pay the cashier and then teleport back to my seat.

206
00:14:06,141 --> 00:14:08,760
Scott: It's like, no, you can walk that.

207
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,810
Rym: Electricity is very similar.

208
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:12,340
Rym: We need electricity.

209
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:15,620
Rym: That is like a fundamental aspect of humanity in the modern era.

210
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:18,920
Rym: But there is no good way to make electricity.

211
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,820
Rym: Every way has pros and cons.

212
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:22,680
Rym: So we agree we need electricity.

213
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:31,040
Rym: So we have to have a conversation as a society about where and how to make that electricity and what externalities are we willing to accept as a society.

214
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:33,080
Rym: But guns, we don't have to accept.

215
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,560
Scott: Yeah, guns have very, very limited necessity, right?

216
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:47,340
Scott: It's like the vast majority of people and societies and places do not need any guns for anything, anytime whatsoever.

217
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:51,040
Scott: They're a useless item for almost everybody.

218
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,620
Scott: The only people who need to have a gun, right, would be like a hunter.

219
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,018
Scott: You could even hunt, right?

220
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,939
Scott: If you need a military, we can discuss that, too.

221
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:07,420
Rym: I would argue it is very difficult to be to be pacifist in the current world.

222
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:11,900
Scott: As long as another country has a military, your country needs a military.

223
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:18,400
Scott: And then, right, certain kinds of hunting, I guess you can't hunt with a bow.

224
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,438
Scott: You're going to need some kind of weapon to do the hunting, right?

225
00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:26,000
Scott: And a gun is often the best choice.

226
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,020
Rym: But even there, we could, as a society, say bolt-action, single-shot rifles are the only allowable guns, which are fine for hunting.

227
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,460
Scott: Right, it's like there are many, there are many, many guns.

228
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,599
Rym: Maybe shotguns for bird hunting as well, and that's it.

229
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,700
Scott: Yeah, like a duck, right?

230
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,120
Scott: Yeah, it's like you're not going to bow hunt for ducks.

231
00:15:41,382 --> 00:15:42,169
Rym: I mean, people do.

232
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:43,359
Rym: I have a relative who does.

233
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:44,937
Scott: That's fucking badass.

234
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:48,480
Rym: That same relative, Scott, you know, he hunts deer for subsistence.

235
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,484
Rym: You know how he hunts them?

236
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:50,511
Rym: He doesn't use a gun.

237
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:51,800
Rym: He thinks guns are for babies.

238
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,606
Rym: He doesn't even use a bow.

239
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:56,660
Rym: He stalks them with a knife.

240
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,500
Scott: That's fucking nasty.

241
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:01,368
Scott: But good luck.

242
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:03,660
Scott: stalking a duck with a knife, is all I'm going to say.

243
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:12,658
Scott: Yeah, a deer maybe if you're like, you know, a ninja or something, but yeah.

244
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:20,900
Scott: Anyway, the point is, is that even for hunting, the guns you need for hunting, right, are a certain set of guns, right?

245
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,760
Scott: A few shotguns for, you know, ducks, birds, whatever, right?

246
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,040
Scott: And then for, even if you wanted to hunt a moose, it's like there is a gun that would be appropriate for that.

247
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:36,560
Scott: And in our society, first of all, handguns are appropriate.

248
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:42,260
Scott: I don't know that much about guns and hunting, but I know that a handgun is the appropriate weapon for hunting almost nothing.

249
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:53,720
Rym: Nope, the only cases I am aware of on earth for handguns and hunting is usually people who want to be able to mercifully finish an animal off that they wounded once they get up close to it.

250
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:54,809
Scott: Okay, good one.

251
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,417
Scott: Yeah, okay.

252
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,060
Rym: But also a lot of people shoot themselves that way because most people have no fucking idea how to use a handgun.

253
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:10,299
Scott: Now, for that use case, though, you would never need a handgun that has a large magazine or any kind of rapid fire mechanism, right?

254
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:11,842
Scott: At all, right?

255
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:15,872
Scott: It could be a slow, you know, lousy handgun.

256
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:19,119
Scott: It doesn't even need to be accurate at range because you're getting close to some animal authority.

257
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,648
Rym: I mean, actually, you could replace the handgun with a captive bolt gun.

258
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:25,617
Rym: That's what they used to murder cattle.

259
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:26,720
Rym: It's basically a gun.

260
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,860
Scott: I thought that the cattle ones, though, were usually like, you know, pneumatic or hydraulic or something.

261
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,118
Scott: Oh, yeah, but there are gun-powered- You can't really carry a compressor around with you.

262
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,839
Rym: Well, did you ever see No Country for Old Men?

263
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:39,599
Scott: Uh, yeah, but I don't remember most of it.

264
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,006
Rym: Well, that's literally one of the main plot devices.

265
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:46,720
Rym: is the one crazy guy carries a cattle gun and a compressor around with him everywhere.

266
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:59,060
Scott: Okay, but anyway, the point is the vast majority of guns are devices that are needed by nobody unless they intend to murder other humans.

267
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:05,638
Scott: And therefore, we should disallow their manufacture, sale, whatever, to the extent possible.

268
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,342
Rym: It's even worse than that.

269
00:18:07,563 --> 00:18:17,311
Rym: If one would argue that a police force needs guns, well, I want to point out that in the most recent school shooting, the cops who were there before- Well, we can talk about that.

270
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:17,878
Scott: It's a whole 'nother?

271
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:18,020
Rym: topic.

272
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,410
Rym: All we'll say is the cops who were there, go read what happened and what those cops did.

273
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,680
Rym: They refused to go in because they were afraid of getting shot.

274
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:30,080
Rym: So they waited until the guy basically offed himself and then they went in after he killed all the kids.

275
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:30,720
Scott: Right.

276
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:35,220
Scott: Could you imagine, right, you know, a house on fire and the fire department?

277
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,680
Scott: You know, sometimes the fire department won't go in because that's the right thing to do depending on the fire and the situation.

278
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:48,699
Scott: But can you imagine the fire department not going in when it's the right thing to do because they're afraid to go in?

279
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,903
Rym: My dad was a fireman.

280
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:52,506
Rym: My grandpa was a fireman.

281
00:18:53,027 --> 00:18:59,460
Rym: And what I'll say is that both of them lost a lot of friends because firefighters charge into burning buildings to save kids.

282
00:19:00,524 --> 00:19:00,800
Scott: That's right.

283
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:09,219
Rym: And one thing my dad said to me when I was really young, and I was figuring out careers, and they don't tell you what careers there are, and a lot of kids are like, "I could be a fireman or a police

284
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:09,540
Rym: officer.".

285
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,836
Rym: And I remember what my dad said was, "Nobody says, 'Fuck the fire department,' and spray paints it on a

286
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:15,096
Rym: wall.".

287
00:19:16,941 --> 00:19:17,302
Scott: That's right.

288
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:28,120
Scott: I mean, you know, we often complain about the police pointing to the horrible things that they do, right, beating up peaceful protesters, harassing churro ladies, right, you know, et cetera.

289
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:33,054
Scott: And I think more needs to be said about what police don't do, which is their job.

290
00:19:33,235 --> 00:19:34,879
Scott: They don't do what they're supposed to do.

291
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,689
Rym: They didn't help me get my stolen bike back.

292
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:38,580
Scott: They don't do anything.

293
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:38,760
Scott: Right.

294
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:49,940
Scott: Whether it's a job, large or small, the things that the police are supposed to be doing that we say are within the things we want them to do, they don't do those things.

295
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,180
Rym: I saw a great commentary.

296
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,018
Scott: And they're cowards.

297
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:58,033
Rym: Remember when the Republican coup on January 6th, and there was that one black cop who saved a bunch of senators.

298
00:19:58,053 --> 00:19:58,915
Rym: There's a video about it.

299
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:02,294
Scott: I saw a really fascinating- A cop doing what he was supposed to do.

300
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:02,739
Scott: Good job.

301
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,285
Rym: Yeah, in the commentary, there was an op-ed in Waypoet.

302
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:13,420
Rym: It was basically like, that story made the rounds and resonated because that is a shocking behavior for a police officer that is rarely seen.

303
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,661
Scott: Yeah.

304
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:23,460
Scott: Because think about how many, right, it's like, yes, the police on January 6th, the Capitol Police, were outnumbered, right, by a great deal, right?

305
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:28,931
Scott: But, you know, there's stories about a handful of them who did what they were supposed to do.

306
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:33,320
Scott: All the rest did not, you know, it's like, they might have done something.

307
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,608
Scott: Some of them were like, you know, there were those videos like waving people in and shit, right?

308
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:43,540
Scott: It's like, all the vast majority of them did not do their job, right?

309
00:20:44,422 --> 00:20:50,193
Scott: But of course, today a little while ago- And those people who don't do their job, you want to give guns to those people.

310
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:51,600
Scott: Oh, they have them already.

311
00:20:51,660 --> 00:21:01,800
Rym: Republicans in the US Senate filibustered dead the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act that would have restricted guns and investigated things like police for white supremacy.

312
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,564
Rym: They filibustered it dead.

313
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:08,199
Rym: This wasn't even a bill for the current shooting, this was the bill for the other shooting that happened a little while ago.

314
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:17,499
Scott: So, no matter how you want to interpret it, right, the point is, is that Republicans, you know- Are the leading cause of death for children in America now.

315
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,121
Scott: Right?

316
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:25,131
Scott: They are, you know, basically in favor, right, of domestic terrorism.

317
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:31,640
Scott: They want domestic terrorism to happen, they do not want government resources being used to prevent you from dying.

318
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:40,900
Scott: They want, they would rather, if given two choices, no matter what their logic is or reason for it, they have chosen that the government should not spend resources.

319
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:48,480
Scott: They think that is more important than you not dying from a person with a gun, if you're in the United States.

320
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:54,580
Scott: Given those two priorities, they chose the priority of government spends less money.

321
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,720
Scott: So, there you go, they care about government spending less money more than they care about you dying from a domestic terrorist before you would normally die by natural causes.

322
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:18,980
Rym: So, not to, but anyway, but in some other news, we're gonna talk about Twitter, but for once, it's not to talk about the technology directly.

323
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,597
Scott: Or any social media biz or anything like that.

324
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:23,741
Scott: Yep.

325
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:40,380
Scott: So, what happened here is that, you know, we've talked about on the show, especially on Monday episodes, about two-factor authentication, right, and how you should use it for everything, as much as possible, even if it's a hassle, right, because of security reasons, you don't want anyone stealing your accounts.

326
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:55,320
Scott: If you do it properly and you have your backup codes, right, you won't lose your account and you'll never have to worry about, you know, anybody busting, you know, "hacking" your Instagram, right?

327
00:22:57,581 --> 00:23:13,500
Scott: But, if you're doing two-factor authentication, you want to do it using TOTP, which is Google Authenticator with the six-digit codes, right, or any other equivalent app, or you want to do it with a physical device or biometric thing, like a YubiKey or fingerprint thing.

328
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:19,640
Rym: Or the out-of-band verification, like what Blizzard does, where there's like an app and you hit a button that says, "Yes, that was

329
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:19,700
Rym: me.".

330
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,223
Scott: Well, that's just TOTP.

331
00:23:21,243 --> 00:23:30,340
Scott: SteamGuard is also effectively, they're all just effectively the same as TOTP, but also the Apple ones, right, your face IDs, your touch IDs, those are okay as well, right?

332
00:23:32,401 --> 00:23:39,260
Scott: But, you do not want to use the SMS one, where they text you a number and you then type that number in.

333
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,602
Rym: We've talked about it at length.

334
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:41,444
Rym: It doesn't work.

335
00:23:41,564 --> 00:23:43,107
Rym: It's completely insecure.

336
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:46,934
Rym: If you're using SMS for two-factor, you might as well be using nothing.

337
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:49,399
Rym: It probably makes you less secure than nothing.

338
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:55,968
Scott: Now, what Twitter did here is evil, right, and bad.

339
00:23:56,228 --> 00:24:03,700
Scott: What they did is they had people sign up for two-factor auth using, you got to give them your phone number so you can get text messages, obviously, right?

340
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:17,174
Scott: And then, when people did that, if you read like, you know, the privacy, you know, documents and, you know, terms of service and whatever, it says, "Yeah, user, give us your phone number for two-factor auth.

341
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:20,477
Scott: We're only going to use your phone number for two-factor auth, right?

342
00:24:20,497 --> 00:24:21,799
Scott: We're not going to use it for any

343
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:22,720
Scott: shenanigans.".

344
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,082
Scott: But, in fact, they did use it for shenanigans.

345
00:24:25,522 --> 00:24:46,018
Scott: If you gave them your phone number in order to do two-factor SMS authentication, there was a period of time in which they were using those phone numbers for tracking, for advertising, even though you had given them your phone number under another pretense, which was security, and the FTC said, "We caught you.

346
00:24:46,358 --> 00:24:47,199
Scott: Pay a bunch of money.

347
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,239
Scott: You done

348
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,660
Scott: wrong.".

349
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,368
Rym: This is pathetic because Twitter is being fined a pittance.

350
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:54,573
Rym: It's a one-time fine of $150 million.

351
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,355
Rym: That rounds down to zero.

352
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,450
Scott: That might be a lot for Twitter.

353
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,260
Scott: They're not doing that well.

354
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,500
Rym: They're not doing well, but that still rounds down to zero, even by the kinds of budgets I work with at work.

355
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,980
Scott: I think that it'll get Twitter to stop, though, which is the intent, right?

356
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,325
Rym: But I want to point out, if this had happened in Europe with the GDPR, the fine would not have been $150 million.

357
00:25:13,985 --> 00:25:34,120
Rym: The fine would have been, well, either 20 million pounds, which is a lot less than $150 million, or 4% of the annual worldwide revenue from the preceding financial year of that company, whichever is greater.

358
00:25:36,082 --> 00:25:38,657
Rym: So, if you're a big company, they charge you 4% of your revenue.

359
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:40,639
Scott: I like that.

360
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,606
Rym: I like it a lot.

361
00:25:41,949 --> 00:25:43,460
Rym: There's some parts of the GDPR that are little less.

362
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,760
Scott: We could argue about the percentage, but I like the concept.

363
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:46,582
Rym: Oh, yeah.

364
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:51,276
Rym: This should be a $15 million fine for Twitter, or a $50 billion fine.

365
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:52,400
Rym: Just shut Twitter down.

366
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:55,062
Scott: Yeah.

367
00:25:55,183 --> 00:26:13,100
Scott: So, the point here is that this is yet another reason not to use SMS for authentication, or not only that, but do not give any company more of your accurate, personally identifying information than is necessary.

368
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:19,555
Scott: So, if you're buying something from a store, you're going to have to give them your name and address to get the things shipped to you.

369
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:20,637
Scott: There's no way around that.

370
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:21,880
Scott: So, give them accurate info.

371
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:22,282
Scott: Yeah.

372
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:25,319
Rym: But if they ask for your social security number, do not fucking give it to them.

373
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,201
Scott: Right.

374
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:29,005
Scott: If it's an optional field, do not fill it in.

375
00:26:29,426 --> 00:26:33,413
Scott: Just don't fill it in if it's optional ever, because it can only help them.

376
00:26:33,473 --> 00:26:36,078
Scott: It doesn't benefit you in any way to give more info.

377
00:26:36,098 --> 00:26:37,360
Scott: that is not necessary.

378
00:26:37,861 --> 00:26:38,740
Rym: Plus, they'll figure it out.

379
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,634
Scott: For example, if you go to a video game website and it says, "What's your

380
00:26:42,654 --> 00:26:43,095
Scott: birthday?"

381
00:26:43,356 --> 00:26:44,300
Scott: We can only share screens.

382
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,600
Rym: January 1, 1900.

383
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,822
Scott: Right.

384
00:26:47,862 --> 00:26:49,284
Scott: You can put in any old birthday.

385
00:26:49,344 --> 00:26:51,788
Scott: Why would you tell someone your actual birthday?

386
00:26:51,888 --> 00:27:00,320
Scott: There's no benefit to you putting in any old date that gets you in to see whatever you're trying to get to see.

387
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,849
Rym: In fact, I put fake birthdays into everything to the point that it has actually polluted the public records about me.

388
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,760
Rym: A few years ago, I got a spam that made it through the spam filters.

389
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,025
Rym: But what was notable is it was a company that was like, "Happy birthday

390
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:13,465
Rym: something."

391
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:21,076
Rym: And it listed a very specific birthday that I had put into one website and only one website.

392
00:27:21,817 --> 00:27:24,060
Rym: So, I know who sold them my information.

393
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:26,481
Scott: Yeah.

394
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:33,051
Scott: But also, with the birthday thing, a lot of companies like to send you coupons or other bonus things on your birthday.

395
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:39,400
Scott: If you spread out those dates, remember, only putting in a date if they require you to tell them your birthday.

396
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,120
Scott: But if you spread out those dates and put them at appropriate times, you can get stuff all the time.

397
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:56,100
Rym: I remember more than once when I was poor, I would casually mention, as I was a group of friends at a restaurant, that it was someone's birthday and often the restaurant would give us a little bit of free food.

398
00:27:57,422 --> 00:27:58,239
Scott: Mmm, free cakes.

399
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,360
Rym: That's real important when you're poor in college.

400
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:02,920
Scott: They might want to look at someone's driver's license, though.

401
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:08,220
Rym: I found that in practice, they don't really care enough to do so, but like Starbucks will check.

402
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,980
Scott: Don't do it at the same restaurant too frequently.

403
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:10,917
Rym: Nope, nope, nope.

404
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:18,360
Scott: But yeah, don't give out your personal information more than absolutely necessary.

405
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,327
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

406
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:28,890
Rym: So, check this out.

407
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:34,400
Rym: You may see, remember, that I used one of the better Eurovision entries from one of the better Eurovisions.

408
00:28:34,802 --> 00:28:38,580
Rym: Subwoofer's song, the Grandma Banana Yum Yum song with the wolf.

409
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,729
Rym: And Subwoofer has put out an official video.

410
00:28:42,969 --> 00:28:47,100
Rym: This is the last I'm going to talk about this video on GeekNights, this music video.

411
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,145
Rym: They put out an official video.

412
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:53,360
Rym: that is the full instructions for how to do the dance in the video.

413
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:57,309
Rym: And it's a very instructive, easy to follow video.

414
00:28:57,409 --> 00:28:58,512
Rym: Like, you could learn this dance.

415
00:28:58,993 --> 00:28:59,796
Rym: I think I'm going to learn it.

416
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:01,540
Rym: It's not more complicated than the mamalayo.

417
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:03,220
Scott: Okay.

418
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:05,099
Rym: If you want to learn the yum yum dance.

419
00:29:06,086 --> 00:29:06,396
Scott: That's it?

420
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:07,179
Rym: That's it.

421
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,021
Scott: Okay.

422
00:29:08,522 --> 00:29:11,389
Scott: So, there's this Instagram account, OneBreathDiver.

423
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,600
Scott: It's an Instagram account belonging to someone named Jules Casey.

424
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:23,020
Scott: They are a free diver and scuba diver and an award-winning photographer in Australia, according to their Instagram profile.

425
00:29:24,402 --> 00:29:27,900
Scott: And, you know, the whole Instagram account, I guess, could be considered a thing of the day.

426
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,153
Scott: Because all these amazing photos of, you know, under the sea creatures of various kinds.

427
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:35,720
Scott: And these are really good photos going on here.

428
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,920
Scott: But in particular, this one video of some scallop guys, right?

429
00:29:43,403 --> 00:29:45,912
Scott: And, you know, I mean, you've probably seen a scallop, right?

430
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:48,160
Scott: Like, after it's been taken out of the ocean.

431
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,010
Scott: You've probably seen one after it's taken out of its shell.

432
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,640
Scott: Just like a little white disc of deliciousness, right?

433
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:03,380
Scott: But a living scallop that's still, you know, doing its thing is not something I've seen too often, right?

434
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:08,672
Scott: And in this video, you can see some little scallops alive under the sea.

435
00:30:08,693 --> 00:30:10,557
Scott: And you can see how they move.

436
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,630
Scott: It's like they don't just sit in one spot their whole life, right?

437
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,393
Scott: They move around.

438
00:30:15,895 --> 00:30:17,060
Scott: How do they move around?

439
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:19,851
Scott: In a very entertaining manner, that's how.

440
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:21,780
Scott: So, watch and be entertained.

441
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:27,020
Rym: In the meta moment, the Geek Guys Book Club book remains Stein Fox Gambit.

442
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,669
Rym: I think we can do this on the next Thursday's show.

443
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:32,019
Rym: I'm going to be done with this book, like, imminently.

444
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:34,469
Rym: Uh, got a lot to say about it.

445
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,052
Rym: I like it.

446
00:30:35,193 --> 00:30:36,380
Rym: Definitely reading the sequels.

447
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,785
Scott: You know, that's how you always do it.

448
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:40,491
Scott: I feel like I could pick any series.

449
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:49,036
Scott: Like, if I did fucking Baby-Sitters Club book one, Rym would be like, after that Book Club episode, Rym would be like, "I'm on Baby-Sitters Book Club

450
00:30:49,036 --> 00:30:50,380
Scott: 100.".

451
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,060
Rym: As a kid, I got pretty deep into the boxcar children.

452
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,554
Scott: Boxcar kids?

453
00:30:55,636 --> 00:30:55,820
Scott: Okay.

454
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,148
Scott: Yeah.

455
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,733
Scott: I don't remember boxcar children, but I do remember, you know, Hardy Boys.

456
00:31:00,773 --> 00:31:02,460
Scott: I just read a few random ones here and there.

457
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,140
Rym: I read a few of the old ones, and as a kid, I didn't like them that much.

458
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,680
Rym: But there was a re-release, like a modernized Hardy Boys that was released when I was in, I want to say, late elementary school.

459
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:16,815
Rym: And it was hardcore and modern, and there was guns and spies, and I was real into that.

460
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:18,580
Rym: I read, like, 15 of those things.

461
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:32,420
Scott: There was, I keep forgetting the guy's name every time, uh, that it comes up, but there was this guy who wrote, like, a whole bunch of, um, sports, uh, fiction.

462
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,359
Scott: I'm sure I've mentioned it on the show before.

463
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:37,170
Rym: Yes, you have mentioned it on the show before.

464
00:31:37,471 --> 00:31:39,400
Rym: When we were talking about reading classes in school.

465
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,960
Scott: Those weren't a series, they were all just these individual books, right?

466
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:52,400
Scott: And then there was also, of course, uh, you know, because I was there right before the sort of Goosebumps Animorphs type kids, they came after me.

467
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:53,501
Scott: Right?

468
00:31:53,722 --> 00:31:57,634
Scott: But I was reading some, uh, not just the Hardy Boys, what were the other ones?

469
00:31:57,754 --> 00:31:59,680
Scott: There was the, uh, Encyclopedia Brown.

470
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:00,939
Rym: Encyclopedia Brown!

471
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:06,560
Scott: And there was some, anyway, Meta Moment, read this other book, Nine Fox Gambit.

472
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:10,511
Scott: And also the GeekNights website is coming along nicely.

473
00:32:10,611 --> 00:32:13,200
Scott: Oh, Matt Christopher, that's the guy who did the sports books.

474
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,219
Scott: Yep, Matt Christopher, that's the one.

475
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:17,800
Scott: Anyway.

476
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,684
Rym: Alright, so, trains!

477
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:24,457
Rym: We, uh, we actually think a lot about trains in our daily life.

478
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:25,660
Rym: Trains are really important to me.

479
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:37,920
Scott: Yeah, trains are, like, such a significant part of our lives, and we've done episodes about so many other train things, and I'm sure we've talked about it during news and whatnot, but we've never done a main bit on trains, so now is the time.

480
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:48,060
Rym: So, trains, I think, are one of the most important things to invest in as humans to help address the existential crisis of climate change.

481
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,800
Rym: Trains are more important now than they have been in a hundred years, I think.

482
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:57,640
Scott: You know, I mean, well, trains were super important when they were first invented, you know, the steam engine and whatnot.

483
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:04,580
Rym: They were really the first efficient way to travel long distances over land in the history of humanity.

484
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:15,360
Scott: Yeah, I mean, before trains, if you wanted to go over land, right, it's like you either, you know, it's like Oregon Trail, you know, it's like getting a wagon and it takes you fucking forever, right?

485
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:21,680
Scott: So not only could a train get people, but also goods, a long way, very quickly.

486
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,502
Scott: It's really funny,

487
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:39,200
Rym: when I was a kid, like a kid brain, before I went to school and learned stuff, I always thought that there was this evolution of transportation, and I thought that like walking led to scooters, led to bikes, led to motorcycles, led to cars, led to trains.

488
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,869
Rym: I thought trains were like the next step from cars.

489
00:33:42,949 --> 00:33:46,900
Rym: It was not until I went to school that I learned that cars came later.

490
00:33:48,012 --> 00:33:48,179
Scott: Yep.

491
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,940
Rym: Because trains just seem more impressive and more useful, even to my kid brain.

492
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,066
Scott: Well, they can go faster, right?

493
00:33:57,607 --> 00:34:03,420
Scott: You know, but I guess the one downside of the train that car people always talk about is the freedom of the open road.

494
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,480
Scott: The train can only go where the tracks go, right?

495
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:05,834
Rym: Yep.

496
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,340
Scott: But I would say that that is-.

497
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:14,679
Scott: But the train was such a revolution that once the train was invented, they built tracks like mad, right?

498
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,681
Scott: They're just like, "Oh my god,

499
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:16,143
Scott: trains!".

500
00:34:16,203 --> 00:34:24,940
Scott: And we had to build tracks everywhere to the point at which they were, you know, enslaving people and all sorts of horrible things just to get more tracks going to more places.

501
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:31,271
Rym: Any old city in America, under almost every street, are buried.

502
00:34:31,792 --> 00:34:35,540
Rym: Tons of old tram and train tracks from the pre-car era.

503
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:44,699
Rym: But also, this whole idea that, "Oh, well, people can go anywhere in a car, but if a train-" Society built itself around trains before there were cars.

504
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,320
Rym: The idea was, if you built a train somewhere, the fact that it's only on those rails is really important.

505
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:56,739
Rym: There's an idea of infrastructure inertia, where once the track is there, it's hard to move or to get rid of it.

506
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:04,920
Rym: So, if someone builds a track somewhere, it makes a lot of sense for towns to grow around where there's stations on those tracks.

507
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:15,717
Rym: So, the map of the train network caused the map of cities and humans existing in America, just like how before trains, rivers caused that.

508
00:35:15,757 --> 00:35:17,380
Rym: That's why every old city is on a river.

509
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:25,900
Scott: Yep, it's like, hey, you might have a place where no one can live, maybe not because it's not a livable place, but because no one can get there.

510
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:29,626
Scott: A train track that's going from A to B happens to pass that place.

511
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:38,820
Scott: Someone can get out there, just one person gets out there, build a train station, the track is there, and suddenly you have settlement happening.

512
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,948
Scott: Is it a problem that the train doesn't go everywhere?

513
00:35:43,068 --> 00:35:48,360
Scott: It's like, just live where there's a train station, or live where there's a track and build a train station.

514
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:55,699
Rym: Yep, or have an alternate means of transportation not to get everywhere you're going, but to get to the nearest train station.

515
00:35:56,784 --> 00:35:57,758
Scott: Yeah, it's, you know.

516
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:08,460
Scott: But yeah, so, you know, a train is really just like, you know, it has a schedule, you can't necessarily always go when you want, but it's like, it'll get you there when you need, right?

517
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:19,140
Scott: And if more people were using train, and more was invested in train, there would be more trains that are bigger and faster and more on time, going to more places, right?

518
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:34,460
Scott: Whereas instead, in the United States at least, we have less trains going less places, to the point at which we have like rail trails all over the place of where there used to be a train, but there isn't anymore, because the track is unused because it was replaced by trucks or whatever.

519
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,300
Rym: But the worst part is, all those rail trails?

520
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,000
Scott: Now it's just a nice hiking trail in the woods.

521
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:47,060
Rym: Like, I like them, but people have this idea that the tracks weren't necessary anymore or wouldn't be useful, and that's why they turned them into rail trails.

522
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,714
Rym: No, if they ran trains on those tracks instead, those trains would be packed.

523
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,740
Rym: They just stopped running the trains.

524
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:55,418
Scott: Yep, pretty much.

525
00:36:56,061 --> 00:37:08,620
Rym: I mean, there was a big fight, and we even talked about this on GeekNights back in like 2006 when we lived in Beacon, because there was a big plan to have Metro North, which is the commuter rail for like downstate New York to get into New York City.

526
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,973
Rym: The Metro North Railroad, along the Hudson River, only goes all the way up to Poughkeepsie, and that's where it stops.

527
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:16,500
Rym: If you want to go further north, there's no commuter rail.

528
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,060
Scott: You gotta use Amtrak, which is not a commuter train, it's a different train.

529
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:25,696
Rym: There are tons of people who commute to New York City from further north than Poughkeepsie.

530
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:27,220
Rym: Terrifying numbers of people.

531
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,640
Rym: So what they do is they drive all the way down to Poughkeepsie and park in Poughkeepsie at the end of the line.

532
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,078
Scott: Or take the Amtrak the whole way.

533
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,704
Rym: Yep, if they live far enough north.

534
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:41,040
Rym: So there was a plan to just extend Metro North three more stations north.

535
00:37:41,360 --> 00:38:02,100
Rym: They proved that those trains would be completely full, it would get a huge number of cars off the road, and all the little dipshit towns north of Poughkeepsie, their local municipal governments blocked it because they didn't want to make the commute easier because they were worried that, and you can read between the lines what they were actually worried about, city people might live up here.

536
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:03,683
Scott: Yep.

537
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:12,760
Scott: Never mind the fact that- It's like if you're worried about noise, you're not, you're clearly, that's a lie, because you have cars driving all over the place making way more noise than trains.

538
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:19,640
Rym: But never mind that those towns only exist because all the people who live there drive to Poughkeepsie to work in the city anyway.

539
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:24,132
Scott: Yeah, I mean these are all US train problems, right?

540
00:38:24,152 --> 00:38:26,920
Scott: If you look elsewhere in the world, right, trains- There's trains everywhere.

541
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:30,740
Scott: Right, especially like Japan, China, right?

542
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,325
Scott: It's like they got trains everywhere, right?

543
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:36,192
Scott: China probably even goes too far with it, right?

544
00:38:36,212 --> 00:38:38,939
Scott: They're just like, "Oh, we want to build a train here, knock it down all your houses,

545
00:38:38,999 --> 00:38:39,300
Scott: bye.".

546
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:39,550
Scott: Yep.

547
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,502
Scott: "Move over there, we're making

548
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:41,963
Scott: trains.".

549
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:45,167
Scott: But the trains work, right?

550
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:54,820
Scott: They're efficient, they're powerful, they're economically, you know, make sense, a lot of sense, and they got newer, faster, better, safer trains in every conceivable way, right?

551
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:02,779
Scott: They got freaking bullet trains, and it's like, when I was a kid, you know, it's like, you know, not riding too many trains when I was a kid other than, you know, the occasional

552
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:07,750
Rym: like- I remember the first time I rode a bullet train in Japan with Emily, and it's even one of the older slow ones.

553
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:13,640
Rym: It's, this, what I rode has nothing on the newer trains in China in the year 2022.

554
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:23,338
Rym: This train, I remember it got faster, and faster, and faster, and hit a point where I thought, "Damn, this is crazy fast," and it had a lot more getting faster to do.

555
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:24,340
Rym: that I did not realize.

556
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:25,381
Scott: Yep.

557
00:39:26,442 --> 00:39:40,120
Scott: And it's like, you know, hey, train technology has advanced incredibly, you know, it's like, sure, a bicycle is always gonna be the most efficient in terms of energy per whatever, but you can't move that amount of stuff with a bicycle, right?

558
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:53,100
Scott: It's like, you need a freight train sometimes, you need a passenger train, you know, or a mixed train or something, you know, for certain loads, it's like, that's the best way, you know, you can fit more containers on some mega freight train than you can on an airplane.

559
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:57,929
Rym: It's, most of the, like, the things that make trains faster are not technological problems.

560
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:03,420
Rym: Americans think trains are slow, and the American trains actually could go a lot faster.

561
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,324
Rym: We just haven't invested in repairing and replacing old tracks.

562
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:20,700
Rym: Like, even our Acela, the fastest train in America, it could go, like, two or three times faster if we bulldozed a small number of nimby houses in, like, a few parts of the Northeast, so the tracks could be made better.

563
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:24,632
Rym: Those trains are already capable of going way faster than they do today.

564
00:40:24,953 --> 00:40:26,899
Rym: They're basically America's bullet trains, but...

565
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:34,200
Scott: And even if those upgrades were made, those trains would still be slow and sad compared to the bullet trains of the rest of the world.

566
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:50,940
Rym: But even those slow bullet trains, if we used our slow bullet trains effectively in America, you could commute from Albany or Philadelphia to New York City on a train faster than you can drive there from, like, a little bit upstate.

567
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:55,279
Rym: It's kind of terrifying that we have not built trains in this country, and I hate it.

568
00:40:56,201 --> 00:41:00,265
Scott: Anyway, so, but yeah, when I was a kid, it's like, I knew about bullet trains.

569
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:05,832
Scott: It's like, you saw imagery of bullet trains, but I never saw one, like, in person.

570
00:41:05,912 --> 00:41:12,920
Scott: Like, it was weird that bullet trains were a thing that, like, we knew about from, like, books and photos and video or TV.

571
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:13,938
Scott: Oh, I don't know.

572
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:23,480
Rym: For the bullet trains, I never rode a train that was not a toy, like, a steam engine in an amusement park, until I moved to New York.

573
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,760
Scott: Oh, I did, because I would take the train to New York City.

574
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,143
Rym: I lived in Michigan.

575
00:41:27,163 --> 00:41:28,110
Rym: There were no trains anywhere.

576
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:29,360
Rym: No train could take me.

577
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,420
Scott: And we also took Amtrak to Florida.

578
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:34,600
Rym: Yeah, we drove to Florida, or we flew to Florida.

579
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,659
Scott: We also drove to Florida.

580
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,345
Rym: Yeah, but there weren't trains where I grew up.

581
00:41:38,425 --> 00:41:45,140
Rym: So, as a young kid, I also had this perception, like, I only ever saw old-timey trains, because they were always, like, historical trains.

582
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,186
Rym: I didn't see our freight trains.

583
00:41:47,206 --> 00:41:50,620
Rym: I didn't see, like, modern passenger trains in person until I came to New York.

584
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,812
Scott: It's, like, even though I did ride trains on occasion when I was young, it's, like, I was always disappointed.

585
00:41:56,832 --> 00:42:00,900
Scott: I was, like, you know, these, you know, they were still fun, because it's still kids and trains.

586
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:01,300
Scott: Oh, yeah.

587
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,181
Scott: It's still fun times, right?

588
00:42:02,241 --> 00:42:08,213
Scott: But I was, like, I knew bullet trains existed, even pre-internet, somehow, and I'm, like, "Where are they?

589
00:42:08,353 --> 00:42:08,974
Scott: Where do they go?

590
00:42:09,034 --> 00:42:10,116
Scott: How come I can't ride them?

591
00:42:10,176 --> 00:42:11,459
Scott: Why don't we use the bullet train?

592
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:11,880
Scott: Where is

593
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,000
Scott: it?".

594
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:14,759
Scott: You know, in New York City, there must be a bullet train there.

595
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,560
Scott: Not anywhere in the United States is there a modern train.

596
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:23,720
Rym: If there was a bullet train in New York, I could get to, we could get, like, upstate faster than flying.

597
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:24,941
Scott: Yep.

598
00:42:25,363 --> 00:42:27,376
Scott: I guess bullet train is an unfortunate name, but...

599
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,162
Rym: Nah.

600
00:42:28,892 --> 00:42:29,500
Scott: Considering.

601
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,445
Scott: Yeah, just a modern train, right?

602
00:42:32,585 --> 00:42:35,811
Scott: I still haven't ridden one, even after, you know, this much of my life is over.

603
00:42:35,831 --> 00:42:40,700
Scott: I still have not ridden on a modern train, because I haven't gone to any of the countries that have them.

604
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,180
Rym: Yep.

605
00:42:41,360 --> 00:43:06,199
Rym: But I think what's most important about trains is, aside from, you know, all the energy efficiency and the infrastructure inertia and everything, it's that I don't have that much time to live, and before I lived in a place where I didn't have to drive, I spent a lot of time piloting a car, and you can only do so much that is not driving.

606
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,220
Rym: when you're driving.

607
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:15,837
Rym: You can listen to a podcast, listen to some music, maybe have a not super intense conversation with someone, and that's about it.

608
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:17,380
Rym: You're basically wasting that time.

609
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:18,380
Scott: Yep.

610
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:26,320
Scott: It's like, if you drive somewhere for an hour, right, you get an hour older, that's almost the same as just dying an hour sooner.

611
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:36,371
Rym: I would rather take a train somewhere that takes three hours than drive somewhere in an hour, because sure, that three hours, I am limited to what I can do, but you know what?

612
00:43:36,752 --> 00:43:42,098
Rym: I'm sitting on a train with my laptop and my Switch and my phone and some snacks.

613
00:43:42,478 --> 00:43:44,140
Rym: That's what the fuck I'm doing at home anyway.

614
00:43:45,161 --> 00:43:55,019
Scott: Yeah, and it's, you know, unlike, you know, people can attempt on an airplane to join the Mile High Club, but on a train, right, you can get on a, you know, proper trains.

615
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,788
Rym: I'm in the train club.

616
00:43:56,908 --> 00:43:58,519
Rym: I am absolutely in the train club.

617
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,050
Scott: Yeah, proper trains have cabins.

618
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:02,880
Scott: You can get it on on a train.

619
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,064
Scott: I have done that.

620
00:44:04,084 --> 00:44:07,540
Rym: Full disclosure, that has happened on multiple occasions.

621
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:09,820
Scott: I'm just saying, you can do it, right?

622
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,758
Scott: You can do it on Amtrak.

623
00:44:11,342 --> 00:44:14,900
Scott: It's okay to do it, unlike on an airplane where you can get caught and get in trouble.

624
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,600
Rym: So get this, you know how Emily and I usually, if we go visit her family out in LeRoy.

625
00:44:18,702 --> 00:44:19,459
Scott: If not expected.

626
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:25,620
Rym: So we could fly to LeRoy, which is near Buffalo, like way upstate by RIT.

627
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:39,920
Rym: Flying, it's about an hour flight, actually it's like a 45 minute flight, plus an hour to get to the airport, plus an hour of security bullshit and waiting, plus getting from the airport in a car that I have to rent all the way over.

628
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:54,560
Rym: Or I can take, we can take like a six and a half hour Amtrak in a private car with two beds and internet and holes and a private toilet or a giant room with a shower and stuff in it.

629
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:06,740
Rym: And those rooms cost, the difference between a regular economy ticket on Amtrak and an economy ticket plus being in that room is less than the cost of a flight.

630
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,819
Scott: Yeah, depends where you're going, but yeah.

631
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,827
Rym: Well, when you're going, those trains, those sleeper cars are only on a few lines.

632
00:45:14,907 --> 00:45:16,389
Rym: So you know what they're not on?

633
00:45:16,729 --> 00:45:23,960
Rym: The lines that go from here to like DC, because if there were sleeper cars to DC, I would go to mag vest in a sleeper car.

634
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:25,041
Scott: Sure.

635
00:45:25,402 --> 00:45:32,040
Scott: But I mean, there's also trains out there that are like, there's a train out in California that has special cars with glass sides.

636
00:45:32,602 --> 00:45:38,439
Rym: I rode in one of those when way back we went to PAX for, uh, you know, PAX and then Scott left.

637
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:51,217
Scott: And I sit in this train and you look out the window and it's like the train ride itself becomes, you know, a special, you know, like it's now, you know, a special thing in and of itself.

638
00:45:51,297 --> 00:45:53,660
Scott: It's not just a means of getting from here to there.

639
00:45:54,801 --> 00:46:01,900
Scott: It's almost more like a, it's almost approaching like a cruise where it's like, yeah, it's getting you here to there, but it's also itself a destination.

640
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,642
Rym: It's amazing.

641
00:46:02,682 --> 00:46:09,178
Rym: The seats are sideways and you're facing giant panoramic windows and usually there's little lookout towers that you can climb up into.

642
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,900
Scott: And, but it's like their train tracks specifically go past beautiful scenic vistas that you're looking at.

643
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,868
Rym: I only rode those once, but way back and we were at that PAX West.

644
00:46:18,928 --> 00:46:23,360
Rym: after you went home, I had a lecturing gig at, uh, I think Kai Fu in Portland.

645
00:46:23,861 --> 00:46:31,960
Rym: So they paid for me to take a fancy Amtrak to Portland from Seattle and I enjoyed that Vista and it was fantastic and I'd like to do it again someday.

646
00:46:32,381 --> 00:46:33,985
Scott: Even if you don't have the Vista, right?

647
00:46:34,045 --> 00:46:40,380
Scott: It's like, you know, you think about like old style, old school train, like, you know, murder on the Orient Express, right?

648
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,080
Scott: It's like, it's like a moving dinner party.

649
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:59,720
Rym: I was, I bought a ticket to take the Orient Express to Istanbul many, many years ago, uh, because I was doing some travel for work and I was going all around Europe and all this stuff and I looked and I was like, you know what?

650
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,407
Rym: It's actually not really much more expensive than flying.

651
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:08,860
Rym: I'll just use some vacation days and I was going to take the Orient Express to Istanbul.

652
00:47:08,902 --> 00:47:09,298
Scott: But you didn't.

653
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,624
Rym: I didn't because the coup attempt happened in Turkey.

654
00:47:12,644 --> 00:47:17,932
Rym: Uh, it failed and I canceled my trip and I haven't been to Turkey since.

655
00:47:18,232 --> 00:47:20,916
Rym: and because I wasn't going to Turkey, I had to curtail that whole trip.

656
00:47:20,957 --> 00:47:22,899
Rym: So I just went to Germany and I canceled everything else.

657
00:47:24,201 --> 00:47:25,965
Rym: And then I never had an excuse to go back.

658
00:47:26,005 --> 00:47:30,455
Rym: and then there's COVID and the Orient Express goes through some troubled lands these days.

659
00:47:30,535 --> 00:47:32,540
Rym: So it's a different situation than it was back then.

660
00:47:33,462 --> 00:47:40,080
Scott: So I guess the last thing train-wise, right, is that there's this huge, you know, nerdery around trains.

661
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,720
Rym: Oh, as a kid, I was obsessed with model railroads and I was also obsessed with actual trains.

662
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,863
Scott: It's true for cars too, right?

663
00:47:47,883 --> 00:47:51,712
Scott: You got your hot wheels and you got your, you know, hot rods and car nerds, right?

664
00:47:51,732 --> 00:47:55,380
Scott: You got your airplane nerds doing flight simulator and all that, right?

665
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,989
Scott: But train nerds, it's like these nerds are every kind of transportation, boat nerds too.

666
00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:07,820
Scott: But the train nerds somehow seem different and apart from the other transportation nerds.

667
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,116
Rym: Oh yeah.

668
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:08,963
Scott: Right?

669
00:48:09,146 --> 00:48:10,300
Scott: In some kind of way.

670
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:10,681
Scott: The

671
00:48:10,702 --> 00:48:11,618
Rym: train nerds, what I find

672
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:24,300
Scott: is- I can't, it's like, it's hard to put my finger on exactly what it is because it's like, it's like there's people who make model airplanes, people who do model trains, people who go to the airport and watch planes take off, people who go to the train station and watch trains come and go, right?

673
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:31,400
Scott: It's like everything, there's no particular thing that you can say train nerds are doing that other forms of transportation nerds are not doing.

674
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,920
Rym: But yeah, if you add them all up, the train nerds stand apart and we all know this.

675
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:47,720
Scott: There's some sort of aesthetic and attitude and, you know, behavior of the train nerds that is different from the other transportation nerds.

676
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:56,860
Rym: One thing I noticed just as a kid because I was really into trains and one friend of the family, like one of the dads, he was one of those come into my basement train dads.

677
00:48:57,383 --> 00:48:59,960
Scott: And he had the whole- I knew quite a few of those, two or three of them.

678
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,580
Rym: The whole basement set up and I was obsessed with it.

679
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:06,340
Scott: If I had a basement, there's a non-zero chance I would be that.

680
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,159
Rym: Non-zero, there is a one chance that I would have that.

681
00:49:09,883 --> 00:49:10,439
Scott: Oh, wow, okay.

682
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:16,120
Rym: Because I had model, as a kid, I had HO gauge and I had a bunch of different gauge model railroads.

683
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:20,040
Scott: The tiny ones- And an oval on a flat board and it was kind of sad.

684
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,680
Rym: Oh, I had switching mechanisms and everything.

685
00:49:21,901 --> 00:49:24,300
Rym: I had all these hardcover books on like train nonsense.

686
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:34,820
Rym: But one thing I like, one of the aspects of the train nerds that seems hyper specific focus is there's this extreme attention to detail that I don't see in those other hobbies.

687
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:45,440
Rym: Like extreme attention to detail in terms of period accuracy and operational and logistical accuracy.

688
00:49:45,500 --> 00:50:05,920
Rym: Case in point, every train nerd, the highlight of their set up, if they're a basement train nerd with the basement set up, in my experience, I don't know if someone might correct me and they have a different experience, is the complicated switching mechanisms and showing off all the ways they can route the trains and simulate the real routing that happens in the real world.

689
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:22,440
Rym: Like activating and deactivating the switching and the signaling is something like most of the flight nerds I know don't hyper, like the flight sim people, they don't necessarily simulate the full ground control, air traffic control experience.

690
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,920
Rym: They mostly simulate the operating the plane experience.

691
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,620
Scott: No, there's those people who are online who are like pretending to be flight control.

692
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,643
Rym: There's a subset.

693
00:50:30,763 --> 00:50:35,520
Rym: I would say that subset of airplane people are nearly identical to train people.

694
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:42,240
Rym: I just think in train nerdery, that type of focus is the majority, where in these other communities it's the minority.

695
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,418
Rym: That is a speculative guess.

696
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:55,720
Scott: Or maybe it could be because trains in the United States have fallen so far that the train nerds have, by and large, are more overlapping with historical things.

697
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:02,818
Scott: And even though there are, there are people who do the classic cars, there are people who do the old planes at the air show, right?

698
00:51:03,881 --> 00:51:18,840
Scott: But I think maybe it could be that there's a great overlap of the train nerds with history, you know, as a percentage of train, a percentage of overall train nerds being historic train nerds, where I think a lot of car nerds are like modern car nerds.

699
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:30,880
Rym: But also you can make physical working model railroads with accurate switching and simulate a lot, a terrifying percentage of real world train stuff.

700
00:51:31,342 --> 00:51:35,040
Rym: Can't really do that with cars or planes in your basement.

701
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:46,379
Scott: I think the other thing is that the train nerds also have an element of real world preservation, at least in the United States, of geographic places.

702
00:51:47,942 --> 00:51:53,740
Scott: There might be an airfield here or there that someone is, you know, preserving and turning into a museum.

703
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,280
Scott: There might, you know, cars, like there aren't really planes, maybe an old racetrack or something here or there.

704
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:07,400
Rym: But go to any town that has a defunct railroad, there is a society of like three guys with beards who are dedicated to restoring it.

705
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:17,900
Scott: There are old stations and train tracks all over the place that have little foundations that are turning them into museums and preserving them and checking them out.

706
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,340
Rym: In Beacon, where we lived, there was, there used to be a hotel and a ski resort at the top of the mountain in Beacon, like in town.

707
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:25,983
Rym: And we go hike up there a lot.

708
00:52:26,364 --> 00:52:33,560
Rym: There was also a railroad, an inclined railroad that went from Beacon, like downtown, up the mountain to this hotel.

709
00:52:34,441 --> 00:52:41,019
Rym: And it was dilapidated, it went out of service in like the 50s and then some vandals burned it down, like what was left in the 70s.

710
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:49,540
Rym: While we were living there, there was a very vocal society of I'm pretty sure exactly seven men, all of whom had white beards.

711
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:57,159
Rym: And they were desperately, constantly, aggressively trying to raise money to rebuild that inclined railroad and then run it.

712
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:10,600
Scott: Right, because even though this collapse happened, the collapse was within the lifetimes of not slightly before our lifetime, but well within the lifetimes of many, many people who are still alive, right?

713
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:13,045
Scott: And, you know, still of sound mind.

714
00:53:13,546 --> 00:53:19,480
Scott: And they're like, hey, I remember a time where there was all this awesome shit and all that shit is gone, right?

715
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:28,117
Rym: The metro north train that used to go from Beacon across into Connecticut was still active, while many people who are alive today, like they're still alive.

716
00:53:28,157 --> 00:53:29,640
Rym: Like that was active in living memory.

717
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:35,538
Scott: Right, I mean, when you think about like us, like I guess, you know, in terms of our memory of the heyday would be like the 90s, right?

718
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:42,620
Scott: And it's like, but none of us are out there like, you know, bring back malls with all this garbage in them, right?

719
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,221
Scott: But it's like.

720
00:53:43,241 --> 00:53:50,340
Scott: we have, you know, memories of that, of like a time where there were like these things that existed that were built up and awesome that then went away.

721
00:53:50,841 --> 00:53:57,280
Scott: But if the things that we remember for the 90s being built up and awesome that went away were actually like useful things.

722
00:53:58,841 --> 00:54:07,399
Scott: Right, like I would be, you know, if it wasn't shopping malls, I would be like, hey, you know, earlier in my life, shit was cool and that shit is all gone.

723
00:54:07,419 --> 00:54:07,680
Scott: What the fuck?

724
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,241
Rym: You know what?

725
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:08,782
Rym: Here's something.

726
00:54:08,822 --> 00:54:10,445
Rym: There's one thing from our childhood, arcades.

727
00:54:10,765 --> 00:54:19,160
Rym: We are some of the, we're literally some of the youngest people who experienced an era where there were multiple arcades in every town.

728
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:26,020
Scott: Yeah, but the problem is, is like we sort of recognize that like bringing back arcades isn't really, you know, great.

729
00:54:26,862 --> 00:54:36,200
Scott: It's not really worth trying to bring back and you couldn't bring it back in the way it was and just plenty of people are preserving the machines and we can set them up anywhere.

730
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,439
Scott: And like, that's fine.

731
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:40,832
Rym: But similarly, we don't want to bring back the trains from the 70s.

732
00:54:40,892 --> 00:54:42,157
Rym: We want to make trains in 2022s.

733
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:54,360
Rym: I don't want to bring back the exact details of a 1989 arcade, but there's aspects of what happened in arcades and what those structures were that I want to reinvent and bring back.

734
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,221
Rym: What stops?

735
00:54:55,261 --> 00:55:08,820
Rym: that is primarily, actually, I think the fact that the people who want those new experiences mostly live in cities and because of capitalism, it is literally impossible to pay the rent on the space you would need to have an arcade.

736
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,619
Scott: Arcade doesn't really make economic sense in most places.

737
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:11,901
Scott: Nope.

738
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:16,520
Scott: But if somehow you could have an arcade in Japan, you can see the arcades are closing.

739
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,420
Rym: If you could somehow have arcades even before the pandemic, they would be packed.

740
00:55:20,721 --> 00:55:26,220
Rym: Look at Barcade, which kind of sucks because it's so loud and so crowded.

741
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,620
Scott: They make all their money from booze.

742
00:55:28,782 --> 00:55:31,160
Scott: It's like, I don't make the money from the arcade games.

743
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,840
Rym: Also, people are packed for deep waiting in line to play.

744
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,999
Rym: They're desperate to play the games.

745
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:35,980
Rym: It's so packed.

746
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,020
Rym: You're trying to like shove your way.

747
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,220
Scott: They're just they're just drunk.

748
00:55:38,321 --> 00:55:40,999
Scott: So they don't realize how crappy it is to play a lot of those games.

749
00:55:42,303 --> 00:55:43,159
Rym: That's me at Magfest.

750
00:55:44,262 --> 00:55:47,100
Scott: Or, you know, the games are there for the social aspect, right?

751
00:55:47,883 --> 00:55:51,698
Rym: I just I really miss the social aspect of just playing competitive games with strangers in person.

752
00:55:52,626 --> 00:55:53,219
Scott: Yeah, me too.

753
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:59,300
Scott: But I also miss, you know, you know, I guess I don't miss riding a train.

754
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,178
Scott: I just rode one.

755
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,871
Rym: But here I miss the Internet.

756
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:02,839
Rym: before spam existed.

757
00:56:04,203 --> 00:56:04,810
Rym: That used to exist.

758
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,840
Scott: So there were no such thing.

759
00:56:07,783 --> 00:56:09,819
Scott: At the end of the day, it was spam way before we got on there.

760
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,620
Rym: Well, depends.

761
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,700
Rym: So early email, I never got spam.

762
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,080
Rym: I didn't have any spam filters.

763
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,339
Scott: I got spam on AOL right away.

764
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:18,000
Rym: I didn't use AOL because I wasn't stupid.

765
00:56:19,703 --> 00:56:21,240
Scott: Not like I was choosing the Internet service.

766
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:22,880
Scott: I mean, I got off AOL pretty quickly.

767
00:56:23,762 --> 00:56:28,920
Rym: So I used burner AOL accounts with free trials to do shady shit.

768
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,860
Rym: But I never used AOL on purpose, for real, for anything other than shady shit.

769
00:56:33,381 --> 00:56:36,496
Scott: That's what my family was using until I got my own computer in like '98, '99.

770
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,360
Scott: Then I got my own service from the phone company.

771
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,640
Scott: But even that, I got spam.

772
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,939
Scott: I got to RIT, got spam.

773
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,380
Rym: I remember RIT, I got my first spam email.

774
00:56:44,982 --> 00:56:49,520
Rym: It wasn't until RIT because I reported it to RIT's IT department.

775
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:56,176
Rym: I forwarded it to abuse@rit.edu and I was like, "What the fuck is this email that came to

776
00:56:56,337 --> 00:56:56,397
Rym: me?".

777
00:56:58,062 --> 00:57:01,939
Scott: I had spam pre-RIT from non-AOL.

778
00:57:03,401 --> 00:57:15,100
Scott: Anyway, trains are awesome and even in places that do trains right, at least there are some such places in the world, it's really like train is the way to go for a lot of things.

779
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,175
Scott: There's not enough train.

780
00:57:19,384 --> 00:57:23,819
Rym: And if you're interested in what it could look like, not to build a new bullet train, we know what that looks like.

781
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,040
Rym: Actually, the president, Biden, has a proposal specifically for that.

782
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,659
Scott: Call it high-speed rail.

783
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:34,520
Rym: Yeah, well it's high-speed rail because there's different levels of rail.

784
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:39,740
Rym: Anyway, there is a real plan to build a train network in America that would transform American society.

785
00:57:40,742 --> 00:57:46,959
Rym: It's being aggressively pushed by our president and one of our political parties, and being filibustered by the other political party.

786
00:57:49,281 --> 00:57:59,920
Rym: But in New York City, there's some old freight rail that goes out through the back right corner of the city, like the back of Queens and down into Brooklyn.

787
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,499
Scott: It's more like the middle of Queens.

788
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,446
Rym: Yeah, it's not the back.

789
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:07,440
Rym: It's the part of Queens that does not have a lot of mass transit.

790
00:58:07,863 --> 00:58:10,220
Rym: Like, subway stops are few and far between.

791
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,260
Scott: Anyway, they want to put trains on tracks that are just sitting there already.

792
00:58:15,121 --> 00:58:15,960
Rym: So despite the facts...

793
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:19,840
Scott: You just have to do a little bit of work on it to hook them up to existing other places.

794
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,060
Rym: Yeah, the proposal is basically, "Hey, this old rail line would be really useful.

795
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:27,938
Rym: Why don't we just run, like put platforms on it, and run trains on it for

796
00:58:27,978 --> 00:58:28,219
Rym: people?".

797
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:52,780
Rym: And early studies showed that even though this just is random freight track that already exists, and you can't really pick where it goes, like it's gonna go where it already goes, so it just picks this semi-random path through some of the outer parts of some of the outer boroughs, they estimate that its ridership would be huge, just because people are so desperate to be able to get places not in a car.

798
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:53,921
Scott: Yep.

799
00:58:53,941 --> 00:58:57,750
Scott: In the end, trains are the best.

800
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:05,090
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

801
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:10,230

807
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,250
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

808
00:59:34,611 --> 00:59:42,149
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are A bunch of people who really don't want me to say their names.

Rym: The next station is Spadina.

811
00:59:52,662 --> 00:59:53,730
Rym: Spadina Station.

812
00:59:54,150 --> 01:00:02,490
Rym: Several people whose names I won't say and I'm going to stop right now because very important hockey is imminently incoming, so I simply leave you with something you really should have seen coming.

813
01:00:10,589 --> 01:00:11,010
Rym: My basement.

814
01:00:12,214 --> 01:00:13,850
Scott: Go show your barbecue to the basement.

815
01:00:14,931 --> 01:00:17,049
Rym: With a concrete floor, it's cool to the touch.

816
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,089
Rym: Turn off the heat, the heat's too much.

817
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:21,350
Rym: I turn on the light bulb, on the wire.

818
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,846
Rym: Turn on the dehumanifier, I'm serious.

819
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:27,728
Rym: When I flick this next switch, look you in the eye and I say, "Check

820
01:00:27,748 --> 01:00:27,849
Rym: this.".

821
01:00:29,131 --> 01:00:29,810
Rym: My trains.

822
01:00:31,254 --> 01:00:31,989
Rym: My trains.

823
01:00:33,376 --> 01:00:34,309
Rym: I got smaller ones.

824
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:35,667
Scott: Tiny little trains.

825
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,710
Scott: I come down here just to get away.

826
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:38,343
Scott: My trains.

827
01:00:39,957 --> 01:00:40,650
Rym: My trains.

828
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:42,829
Rym: It's like magic.

829
01:00:43,611 --> 01:00:44,330
Rym: Magic trains.

830
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,367
Scott: I wish these trains could take me away.
