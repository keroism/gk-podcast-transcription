1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,120
Scott:

2
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:09,187
Rym: It's Thursday, March 17th, 2022.

3
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:09,429
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:12,840
Scott: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:14,826
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

6
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:17,355
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about St.

7
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:18,760
Rym: Patrick's Day.

8
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:20,118
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:20,823 --> 00:00:21,560
Rym: The holiday.

10
00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:39,559
Rym: So yeah, we kind of had a sort of accidental GeekNights hiatus that's actually going to continue into next week due to a series of literally unrelated events that for each day we would have done a GeekNights, there was some reason why one of us couldn't.

11
00:00:40,302 --> 00:00:42,418
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't like, "Oh, let's take a week or two

12
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:42,700
Scott: off.".

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,768
Scott: It was like, "Oh, can't do the show tonight.

14
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:46,214
Scott: Oh, can't do the show tonight.

15
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:47,319
Scott: Oh, can't do the show

16
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:47,620
Scott: tonight.".

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,590
Rym: It was funny because I actually, like, I noticed that.

18
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,676
Rym: so I tweeted like, "Hey,

19
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:50,837
Rym: FYI.".

20
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:54,439
Scott: It wasn't even an out of idea situation like it sometimes is.

21
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:59,680
Rym: Many of these days we had a show queued up to do, meaning the next few weeks will be easy.

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,099
Rym: Actually, no, they won't because we're going to forget what those shows were.

23
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:04,747
Rym: I've already forgotten.

24
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,420
Rym: I remember the next Thursday show we're going to do, though.

25
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,477
Rym: See if I remember it two weeks from now.

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,894
Rym: But it's funny because I tweeted and a bunch of people were like, "Well, yeah, yeah, like, you've been doing this show for so long.

27
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:17,898
Rym: I'm surprised you never took a break

28
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:18,200
Rym: before.".

29
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:25,628
Rym: Because in retrospect, we've very rarely taken breaks from GeekNights, except at very specific times of year.

30
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:29,200
Rym: usually, like right around November, December, we've always taken a break.

31
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,899
Rym: We've always taken a break around March when there's a lot of conventions in a row.

32
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:37,140
Rym: But it's the first time we had a break just kind of in the middle of a random time.

33
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:37,977
Rym: I guess that is March.

34
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:42,192
Scott: I guess, but we're not going to the PAX East.

35
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:43,880
Scott: Well, you guess we're not going for real.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,080
Rym: Yeah, I mean, all I will be at PAX East on Thursday doing a panel.

37
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:53,077
Rym: There is a non-zero but not high chance that Scott will be there.

38
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:53,980
Rym: Probably not.

39
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,958
Scott: I think it's zero.

40
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:56,382
Rym: You think?

41
00:01:56,462 --> 00:02:02,320
Rym: So it's not technically zero yet, just like the Red Wings are not mathematically eliminated from the wildcard.

42
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:11,819
Scott: I suppose there could be some reason that could urge, but at the current time, I have absolutely no plan to go, and in fact, I plan to not go.

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:21,360
Rym: In fact, I would say the odds of Scott being with me live at PAX East are the same as the odds that the Red Wings make the wildcard slot in the Stanley Cup playoffs.

44
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,999
Scott: I don't know, I think the Red Wings have a better chance.

45
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:27,060
Rym: Uh, that does not appear true.

46
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:33,960
Rym: There's basically only, the teams that are going to get the wildcard slot are basically fighting over who has the last and second to last seed.

47
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,740
Rym: Like, there's a pretty big gap in the score, at least last I checked.

48
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,015
Scott: 55 points, and they need to catch up to...

49
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,616
Rym: 70-something?

50
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:44,759
Scott: Yeah, it's not looking good.

51
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:45,739
Rym: It's not looking good.

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:03:00,491
Rym: So yeah, on my side, I had a family emergency, which, 100% okay, like, it is resolved, but it was a medical scare that, you know, sometimes there's a, you get a phone call from a relative who doesn't call you.

53
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:06,380
Rym: often at a time, they don't tend to call you on the phone, and when you don't answer, they immediately call you again.

54
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,800
Scott: You just see the phone ringing, and it's a name of a relative you don't speak to.

55
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:12,859
Scott: It's like, you know, somebody's not doing good.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,720
Rym: Or it's one you speak to kind of often, but you don't speak to, like, in the middle of a weekday.

57
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:25,400
Scott: Right, you can just tell by the person and the time that there's something wrong with that phone call before you pick up the phone.

58
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,639
Rym: Yup, better call James Randi.

59
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,560
Rym: But it was a situation, I'm not going to share details, obviously.

60
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:35,677
Scott: It's not a psychic thing, it's just, you know, a deduction based on...

61
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:50,600
Rym: But the situation ended up being, there was a chance this could have gone real bad, and it ended up being the best possible scenario for everyone involved, and the person involved is making a full recovery, and that's exciting.

62
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:55,998
Rym: I got to go to Florida and say hi to people once COVID is a little safer and it's a little warmer, but...

63
00:03:57,105 --> 00:03:58,139
Scott: If I would go to Florida.

64
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:05,060
Rym: I mean, they live in Florida now, and it's like a zombie apocalypse still, like, avoid people at all costs.

65
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:06,679
Rym: I'm glad I live in the north.

66
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:14,380
Rym: But also, like, a hockey game came up, a friend we haven't seen in years was in town on one of the nights.

67
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,459
Rym: There's just been a lot happening, and guess what?

68
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:23,279
Rym: Next week, No GeekNights, because I'm going to be in London all week working out of my London office just for a work thing, so...

69
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,839
Scott: Coming to London.

70
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,303
Rym: Yeah, you're going to London.

71
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:30,420
Rym: It was very much, get this, it was very much a "we're going to London" situation.

72
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:37,939
Rym: Because, get this, I'm at work, you know, doing my thing, and someone messages me, and they're like, "Hey, so we should talk about the London

73
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:38,179
Rym: thing.".

74
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:39,875
Rym: And I was like, "What London

75
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:40,118
Rym: thing?".

76
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:43,935
Rym: And he's like, "You're going to be here, right?

77
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:44,337
Rym: For the

78
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:44,658
Rym: thing?".

79
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:48,675
Rym: And I had to go sort that out, but it turns out I am, in fact, going to London, so...

80
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:51,579
Scott: Well, good luck with that.

81
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,060
Scott: Yep.

82
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:54,067
Rym: At least the London weather there is better than it is here.

83
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:57,640
Rym: I biked home from work today, but it is not warm enough yet.

84
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,240
Scott: I mean, you know, it's hard to see, I think, today.

85
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:08,600
Rym: The good part of that is, it wasn't actively raining, but because it was so foggy and kind of damp, nobody else was biking.

86
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:18,100
Rym: I got home in like half the time I normally get home, because there's so much bike traffic normally that I actually run into, like, bike traffic on my way home from work when I bike home now.

87
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,638
Rym: Like, it's getting real dense.

88
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:26,120
Rym: Which is a good thing, but it means we need to take more lanes away from cars and make more bike lanes.

89
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:38,120
Scott: The congestion pricing might show up late next year, 2023, but it doesn't seem like it's going to be high enough to dissuade drivers from coming.

90
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,700
Scott: I think it seems like it's just going to try to get some revenues.

91
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:41,740
Rym: Yeah.

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:49,160
Rym: I increasingly see the most effective strategy with the least harm that's feasible in a country like America.

93
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,840
Rym: Because obviously there are ways to do this in a good way, but America is just incapable of that kind of thing.

94
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:05,240
Rym: But as to the primary thing you want to go after is reducing the number of lanes of travel, because that slows traffic, makes it more annoying to travel, so the people...

95
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:08,580
Scott: Inverse-induced demand, right?

96
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,064
Rym: But it does not remove the possibility.

97
00:06:11,124 --> 00:06:21,120
Rym: That way, people who have another option are increasingly pushed to use that option, but people who literally do not have another option still have that option available.

98
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:32,500
Rym: And there's a lot of externalities of fucking with traffic, but that seems to be the safest, least harm way to make it better for everyone in America as America is today.

99
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:38,027
Scott: But also just charging what it costs, right?

100
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:54,800
Scott: I've seen studies saying that a car driving into Manhattan on a weekday causes about 80 to even... I've seen estimates as high as $160, and who knows inflation, right, when these studies were done, right, in externalities.

101
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:08,436
Scott: Meaning that, you know, basically, collectively as a society, we are subsidizing, right, anyone... Someone drives into Manhattan on a car on a weekday, they're costing society $160 in damage.

102
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:23,120
Scott: Pollution, road maintenance, the space they take up, right, you know, slowing everyone else down, just, you know, taking up a parking spot, you know, all these factors, right?

103
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:31,436
Scott: And if they had to pay for all of those things, they might have to pay $160 just for coming in, right?

104
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:53,594
Scott: Now, if someone comes in, and then let's say it's a tourist, and that tourist sees a Broadway show and goes to a hockey game and buys three meals and stays in a hotel for $500 a night, they're effectively going to be covering the damage they've done, you know, with the money they spend,

105
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:54,435
Rym: but

106
00:07:54,995 --> 00:08:04,240
Scott: even if that's the case, what you have is sort of an indirect subsidizing of those businesses, right, by all of us, right?

107
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:09,977
Scott: So, you know, it's like, but if you go ahead and just charge someone, it's like, yeah, the toll to cross the bridge is 160 bucks now.

108
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:16,819
Scott: It's like, well, that, you know, that's not very fair to someone who needs to come and has no fucking money, right?

109
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:26,060
Scott: So you need to find a way, I think, you know, the fairest system would be find a way to charge that price, but then scale the price.

110
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:30,175
Scott: It's like if a rich guy wants to drive his car in, 1,000 bucks to cross the bridge.

111
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:31,440
Scott: Go fuck yourself, right?

112
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,580
Scott: And if a poor person drives the bridge, okay, zero dollars.

113
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,980
Rym: Yeah, until we can do things like build more buses.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,520
Scott: The rich guy paid for you, don't worry about it.

115
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,419
Rym: Like build more bus lanes, build more trains, like do the stuff to make it easier for the poor person to travel.

116
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:52,560
Rym: The other way to go, like on a higher level, I always think about the fact that roads are so heavily subsidized, yet mass transit systems are expected to break even or be profitable.

117
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,720
Scott: Yes, they should all be zero dollars.

118
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:05,320
Rym: Yeah, either we pay the real cost for both of them, in which case mass transit will be so much cheaper that people would fight desperately to get more mass transit or mass transit should be free.

119
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,960
Rym: I still say anyone with a New York City ID should be able to ride the New York City subway an unlimited number of times free.

120
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,980
Scott: No, I think don't even don't even need to put any ifs, right?

121
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:22,180
Scott: Because think about this, if you just let everyone ride, everyone, any human being to get on a subway or a bus, right?

122
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:24,080
Scott: It should be zero dollars, right?

123
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:36,020
Scott: And not only is that just, you know, fairer for everybody, but you will actually save a ton of money because now you can just tear up the turnstiles.

124
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,020
Scott: You don't need to run this this omni system.

125
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:40,839
Scott: You don't need to have these MTA employees.

126
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,020
Scott: You know, cops can do something else besides, you know, arrest people trying to jump the turnstiles.

127
00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:48,060
Scott: You know, it becomes more accessible.

128
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,279
Scott: People don't got to get the door open to get the wheelchair through.

129
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:59,460
Rym: The elevators could go directly to the platform without having to stop on a mezzanine, which is a big reason why a lot of old subway stations still don't have elevators.

130
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:04,620
Rym: There's physically nowhere to put elevators because you need two sets of elevators to handle the whole metro situation.

131
00:10:05,241 --> 00:10:05,422
Scott: Right.

132
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:14,620
Scott: And the savings, all those, there's a whole building near you, right, in a secret quote location where they count all the cash that comes in every day.

133
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:24,499
Scott: It's like if the cash is just tax money, then there is no cash coming into the transit system and they can just fire all those people.

134
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:24,880
Scott: Sorry.

135
00:10:25,982 --> 00:10:29,280
Scott: And but, you know, you get sell that building, right?

136
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,484
Scott: It's like this.

137
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:34,240
Scott: How much money is spent in order to collect money safely?

138
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:39,580
Scott: All those guards with armored armed cars filling up MetroCard machines, right?

139
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:44,560
Scott: All that infrastructure just poof, you know, how much did they invest to set up this whole omni thing?

140
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:46,960
Scott: They could have just not spent that money.

141
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,359
Rym: So here's the best way to do it.

142
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:57,360
Rym: Just make the subway free for everyone, just no tourist house or anything, but sell on, sell to tourists, passes and convince them that there's an RFID that gets checked.

143
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,720
Scott: Oh, you know that scammers will be doing that.

144
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:01,282
Rym: Oh, yeah.

145
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:05,100
Scott: Well, just to this day, we should just let those scammers get away with it.

146
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:05,521
Rym: Yeah.

147
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:10,540
Rym: Just like people sell tickets for that, the free ferries that go past the Statue of Liberty.

148
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:18,640
Rym: So you wanted to talk about Obsidian, not the Cardassian Obsidian order, but yeah.

149
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,780
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, so I've known a long time about, you know, this idea of personal wikis, right?

150
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,800
Scott: So think of like Wikipedia, but you just make one for yourself and you're the only one who ever writes in it.

151
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,182
Scott: Yeah.

152
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:33,580
Rym: And I've done this at every job I've ever had.

153
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:40,540
Rym: Like I had a wiki that I would like I ran a Twiggy wiki just for myself to organize my own work when I worked at both IBM and pipeline.

154
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:41,721
Scott: Yeah.

155
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:51,280
Scott: So I've tried a bunch of those in the in the past, but they've always been kind of meh, you know, and like, you're not, you know, it's like it's hard to stick with them and hard to keep using them.

156
00:11:51,460 --> 00:12:00,960
Rym: Well, especially because work is a is one thing because there's a certain structure to work and you can sort of mirror that structure in a wiki and the wiki only cares about like a certain domain.

157
00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:03,479
Rym: But imagine trying to wiki your actual life.

158
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:04,561
Scott: Yeah.

159
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:16,380
Scott: So on the one hand, obviously, you know, even if you have a system that works for you and you use it, you have to like not document your entire life in text form because then what life are you living?

160
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:18,205
Scott: That's weird.

161
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:19,615
Scott: Right.

162
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:20,280
Rym: Don't go overboard.

163
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,362
Scott: But yeah.

164
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:24,270
Scott: But I've used things like, you know, Google Keep, for example.

165
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:24,652
Scott: Right.

166
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:27,680
Scott: But that's you can't really keep everything in there.

167
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,788
Rym: Keep is just like a list of things.

168
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:32,980
Rym: I have to do in the near future is how I use Google.

169
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,483
Scott: I use Google tasks for that.

170
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:41,659
Scott: But, you know, but it's like, you know, there's no organization to a Google Keep or an Apple Notes.

171
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:41,960
Scott: Right.

172
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,125
Scott: There's no relation.

173
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:46,439
Scott: You know, the hyperlinking functionality is not there.

174
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:49,606
Scott: So Obsidian is this software?

175
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:50,429
Scott: that's free.

176
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,940
Scott: It's not 100 percent open source, I don't think.

177
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,823
Scott: But there are features you can pay for, like syncing.

178
00:12:57,304 --> 00:13:11,140
Scott: But you don't actually need to pay for that because you could just use like some other underlying sync, like iCloud file sync or, you know, Dropbox or something to sync the files because you're just making markdown files.

179
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:11,741
Scott: Right.

180
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:13,666
Scott: And they're much easier to write.

181
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:19,260
Scott: And this little app runs on desktop and iOS and it runs on everything.

182
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:19,761
Scott: Right.

183
00:13:19,861 --> 00:13:25,107
Scott: So you can get your, you know, to your notes about your life from anywhere.

184
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:33,857
Scott: And, you know, I think what's good about it is that the reason to do this, you know, it's like what.

185
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,980
Scott: what problem are you solving by doing this?

186
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,280
Scott: Right.

187
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:44,110
Scott: The problem that I was trying to solve was that there's often cases where I'm trying to recall information.

188
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,212
Scott: Right.

189
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:49,697
Scott: That is information that could never be Googled ever.

190
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:51,820
Scott: But also my memory is bad.

191
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:58,306
Scott: So, for example, I'm not recording everything I eat.

192
00:13:58,426 --> 00:13:58,686
Scott: Right.

193
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:01,811
Scott: But like, what did you have for lunch last Thursday?

194
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:02,532
Scott: Right.

195
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:03,533
Scott: You would never.

196
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:04,795
Scott: It's not Googleable.

197
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:05,556
Scott: Right.

198
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:05,936
Scott: It's not.

199
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:08,540
Scott: Unless you remember, you're not going to know.

200
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:15,069
Scott: But if you were to record something like that, then this would be the way to do it.

201
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:15,370
Scott: Right.

202
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,812
Scott: So but there are things.

203
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:17,513
Scott: Right.

204
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:22,560
Scott: For example, that you might want to remember for a conversation.

205
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:23,421
Scott: Right.

206
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:25,963
Scott: So let's say I go to a hockey game.

207
00:14:26,444 --> 00:14:26,704
Scott: Right.

208
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:33,191
Scott: And somebody scores their first NHL goal at that game.

209
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:33,751
Scott: Right.

210
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:42,260
Scott: It's like now, if I was going to try to Google that later, like two years later, was I I think I was at the game where that guy scored his first NHL goal.

211
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,540
Scott: I don't.

212
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,581
Scott: I don't remember, though.

213
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:44,101
Scott: Right.

214
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:50,286
Scott: You could go and find your ticket stub and then try to Google for like that person when they scored their first goal.

215
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:50,786
Scott: And right.

216
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:52,827
Scott: And that's going to take you a while.

217
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:53,268
Scott: Right.

218
00:14:53,748 --> 00:15:03,235
Scott: But if you just leave a hockey game and then, you know, a relatively medium to significant event, you know, not an everyday occurrence.

219
00:15:03,515 --> 00:15:03,755
Scott: Right.

220
00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:07,037
Scott: And just make a quick note, like, was that hockey game?

221
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:09,219
Scott: Here's the two notable things.

222
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:09,439
Scott: Right.

223
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,900
Scott: There was a DJ named.

224
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:19,809
Rym: This is remember all the all the stuff around the former guys, multiple impeachments and all these memos that keep coming up.

225
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,674
Rym: That is a really important concept of if anything notable happens.

226
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:27,438
Rym: It's not that by writing it down, you now have proof that it happened.

227
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,439
Rym: It's more that.

228
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,000
Scott: Yeah.

229
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,481
Scott: Because you can write down a lie.

230
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:32,903
Scott: It's not proof at all, but it's metadata.

231
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:37,306
Rym: It's additional contributing information to remind you what happened.

232
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:46,352
Rym: So you have this artifact you can point to from the future about that incident or remember it or corroborate that with other memos and other information other people have written.

233
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:48,853
Scott: The other problem I'm trying to solve.

234
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:49,274
Scott: Right.

235
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:56,238
Scott: Is that, you know, something happens, you know, when you're a person like me who talks on the Internet too much more than anyone should.

236
00:15:56,638 --> 00:15:56,879
Scott: Right.

237
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,000
Scott: Conversations tend to repeat that.

238
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,062
Scott: They repeat themselves a lot.

239
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:01,362
Scott: Yeah.

240
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:02,283
Rym: Right.

241
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:09,249
Rym: Like a while ago in a private discord where someone accused me of raising a topic we had already discussed.

242
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:10,510
Scott: Not not not like that.

243
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,315
Scott: I'm saying there are certain discussion topics that keep coming up repeatedly month after month.

244
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:18,778
Rym: And you want to go back and find like this is all the things I would say.

245
00:16:18,798 --> 00:16:21,040
Rym: I would have said these again in the same conversation.

246
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:30,006
Rym: So I already have a Google Doc bot that figures out if you're tweeting something you've already tweeted and just it'll auto complete the entire account like that.

247
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:33,989
Scott: But like I have a Google I have a Google Doc that has basically a list of like.

248
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,792
Scott: if someone is buying a bicycle, here are the things to say.

249
00:16:37,852 --> 00:16:38,072
Scott: Right.

250
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:39,513
Scott: But here you can go.

251
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:42,896
Scott: if you use a wiki, you can go one further where like.

252
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:46,518
Scott: let's say we're talking about some game topic for a panel.

253
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:46,778
Scott: Right.

254
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:49,040
Scott: Like people playing games slowly.

255
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:49,680
Scott: Right.

256
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,484
Scott: And it's like, you know, there's all these things that we have to say about that topic.

257
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:55,264
Scott: Right.

258
00:16:55,825 --> 00:17:00,768
Scott: And if you have all those ideas and they're all tagged and linked in like a wiki.

259
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:01,648
Scott: Right.

260
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:02,789
Scott: Then it's like, ah.

261
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:06,811
Scott: And then as you think of new ideas, if they relate to that topic.

262
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:07,392
Scott: Right.

263
00:17:07,772 --> 00:17:12,135
Scott: You put them in and over time, you're like developing your.

264
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:15,417
Scott: you know, you're not you're instead of repeating yourself over and over.

265
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:18,880
Scott: It's like you're actually a because you have the storage.

266
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,181
Scott: That's not your crappy memory.

267
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,483
Scott: Now you're developing your thoughts over time in a better way.

268
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,645
Scott: You're not like repeating thoughts you've already had.

269
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:29,107
Scott: If you've already had a thought, you'll see it there.

270
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:29,787
Scott: Right.

271
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:31,208
Scott: You know, they're all interlinked.

272
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:37,613
Scott: You can you can like and if you say, you know, maybe one day I go in and I realize like, you know, I need a new panel idea.

273
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:44,397
Scott: You know, I go in and I see, wow, this particular note has like 20 things linked to it.

274
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:48,660
Scott: I could probably turn whatever that note is about into a panel.

275
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,122
Scott: And all those 20 linked ideas are going to be the slides.

276
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:52,803
Scott: Right.

277
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:57,406
Scott: Or even though I was trying to do that intentionally.

278
00:17:57,847 --> 00:17:58,087
Scott: Right.

279
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:01,009
Scott: Just the ideas and thoughts.

280
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:08,675
Scott: You know, anytime you have a thought that's like a new thought or a or a somewhat insightful thought, you just put it in and tag it appropriately.

281
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:15,380
Scott: And then you can go look at the Web when it's time to produce content and it's like it will give back to you.

282
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:22,346
Scott: And so I've you know, usually, you know, I'm sort of my whole life I was like and writing notes.

283
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:24,308
Scott: I don't take notes at school.

284
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:32,756
Scott: I remember I think I've told this story right where I was in a class and the teacher in high school and the teacher called out another student for not writing notes.

285
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,998
Scott: And the student said, Scott isn't writing notes.

286
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:38,742
Scott: And the teacher said, Scott's getting an A. Right.

287
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:40,245
Scott: So I never took notes ever.

288
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:40,806
Scott: Right.

289
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,208
Scott: I didn't really study.

290
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:42,889
Scott: Right.

291
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,973
Scott: I just, you know, did projects and homework.

292
00:18:45,354 --> 00:18:48,960
Scott: But, you know, now only after half my life is gone.

293
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:53,466
Scott: Why do I see some value in note taking?

294
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:57,514
Rym: Especially because right now we're at an interesting point where we've been socially isolated.

295
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,920
Rym: We being the royal we not like everybody because of covid.

296
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:06,150
Rym: So we've been socially isolated for a while, alone with our own thoughts in a much smaller circle of people.

297
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:11,640
Rym: And also, Scott and I, we've been doing panels and lectures for so long.

298
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:15,885
Rym: And every now and then we do hit this point of like, wait, what that?

299
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:17,908
Rym: what the hell new thing are we going to talk about?

300
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:25,380
Rym: And they're sort of coming to a head in that because we're isolated, we're not even playing like new games and doing a lot of new things.

301
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:35,400
Rym: Meaning I keep diving back into old topics deeper and deeper with like the panels I'm doing without Scott during this slow ramp up to going back to.

302
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,761
Scott: It's like, yeah, it's like this.

303
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,626
Scott: So, you know, this sort of an intellectual standstill.

304
00:19:39,926 --> 00:19:40,247
Scott: Right.

305
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:41,368
Scott: Yeah.

306
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:49,040
Scott: Because the best thing is related to the major, you know, things that are related to major world events are advancing and everything else is sort of stuck.

307
00:19:49,381 --> 00:20:00,040
Rym: All the things that happen when you get an eclectic or different group of people communicating or you revisit an idea and then expand from it instead of revisiting it to remember where you got it to last time.

308
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:16,880
Scott: Yeah, it seems there are some apparently there are some people who subscribe to like these various, you know, systems of note taking like this, the Zettelkasten stuff or whatever, based on something some old German dude did with note cards a long time ago.

309
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:17,641
Scott: Right.

310
00:20:18,102 --> 00:20:22,651
Scott: And it's like, yeah, I'm not sticking to any of these like dogmatic systems of like.

311
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:27,520
Rym: you have to take notes a certain way, but it is certain kinds of people who have certain kinds of right.

312
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,942
Scott: But it is interesting.

313
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:34,412
Scott: So, you know, I did take some ideas because you do have to set up some sort of structure when you do this.

314
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:34,812
Scott: Right.

315
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:39,240
Scott: And I took ideas from that and I was like, oh, yeah, OK, I see what you're saying.

316
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:39,905
Scott: That makes sense.

317
00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:40,267
Scott: Right.

318
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:42,079
Scott: And it sort of works.

319
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:49,280
Scott: So if you are a person who, you know, has either of those problems, I do recommend this.

320
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:56,900
Scott: Also, a lot of TTRPG people are using this software to take notes on their games.

321
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:03,680
Rym: I was thinking about that because one thing I'm starting to struggle with is we've been playing Blades in the Dark, an RPG for the entirety of Covid.

322
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:04,522
Rym: So I've been.

323
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:10,460
Rym: this is now like the fourth or fifth longest campaign I've ever played in a tabletop RPG in my life.

324
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:18,060
Rym: And there is a rich body of the history and the proper nouns and like the things that have happened in this world.

325
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:23,640
Rym: But I just have this really long Google Doc broken down by each session and what happens in that.

326
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,500
Scott: Imagine if instead of that Google Doc, you had a bunch of really tiny notes that were all linked.

327
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,061
Rym: Yup.

328
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:29,342
Scott: Right.

329
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:30,564
Scott: You know, in like a wiki style.

330
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:38,840
Rym: Because then instead of like I've like, wait, like control F and like, wait, how many how many dealers did Bibi go through as she kept like getting them killed?

331
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,340
Rym: Like, no, I can click on Bibi and see a cluster of all the heroin dealers that Bibi is.

332
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:43,781
Rym: Right.

333
00:21:44,142 --> 00:21:44,885
Scott: Well, and right.

334
00:21:44,965 --> 00:21:46,611
Scott: Bibi would have the tag dealer.

335
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:48,820
Scott: You click on dealer and dealer would be a page.

336
00:21:49,201 --> 00:21:49,441
Scott: Right.

337
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:50,966
Scott: That would link to all dealers.

338
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:55,300
Rym: And that was the guy who sold the magic ghost mushrooms that Bibi got him arrested.

339
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:58,837
Rym: No, the other guy was selling a magic ghost mushrooms would have a page.

340
00:21:59,199 --> 00:21:59,400
Scott: Right.

341
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,807
Rym: Oh, magic ghost mushrooms are a big part of the plot right now.

342
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:05,320
Rym: We just stole a bunch from a military waste dump and we're going to make drugs out of it.

343
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,681
Scott: All right.

344
00:22:06,303 --> 00:22:10,494
Scott: But yeah, I've been using this software for a little while now and I'm still using it.

345
00:22:10,574 --> 00:22:11,256
Scott: So now I can.

346
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:12,520
Scott: I can recommend it after.

347
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:13,462
Rym: All right.

348
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:14,024
Scott: I might try it out.

349
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:19,240
Scott: I wasn't going to say anything about it because, you know, it could have been like install it, say I'm going to use it and then not use it.

350
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:19,681
Scott: Right.

351
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:26,420
Rym: Well, this could be good, especially honestly, I might try it out to to start to crystallize our more like we've got to have it.

352
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,343
Rym: We've been talking a lot.

353
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:29,813
Rym: I guess we can say it on the show because I'm not shit talking.

354
00:22:29,853 --> 00:22:31,720
Rym: I'm not promising we're going to do anything in particular.

355
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:38,000
Rym: But we've been talking a lot on our own about how to do another round of panels.

356
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:44,920
Rym: You know, guys over the years, we've had like sets of years where we do like a certain type of panel or a certain depth of a topic.

357
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:53,480
Rym: And we kind of want to do another round of old topics where we go way deeper and start to assume that people know some of these basics.

358
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:58,360
Rym: But that requires way more research and diligence than we have had time to do lately.

359
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,590
Rym: And this is a better way to organize those kinds of thoughts.

360
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:04,600
Rym: So we'll say I try this out.

361
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:12,100
Scott: So, yeah, obsidian note, I guess is what if you see like a purple gem, that's that's you found the right software.

362
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:19,460
Rym: Now, so what is plug ins and all kinds of stuff in some huge and surprising news?

363
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:30,410
Rym: Interestingly, surprising not only to us, but also to the senators who passed it, which I find utterly hilarious, but not in a way more in a ridiculous, sad way.

364
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:40,420
Rym: Daylight saving time switching back and forth in America might is about to end unless like the House fails to pass it or Biden vetoes it.

365
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,082
Scott: Well, we'll see.

366
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:44,394
Scott: It's not it's not a done deal yet, but it's it's way close.

367
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:45,920
Scott: It passed the biggest hurdle.

368
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:46,582
Rym: Yep.

369
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:51,140
Scott: Some hurdles remaining, but none of them are taller than the one it has already jumped.

370
00:23:51,540 --> 00:24:00,540
Rym: So the funny thing is getting rid of the time change has been extremely popular in America for a long time.

371
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,640
Rym: Very few people actually like the changing of the time.

372
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:13,940
Rym: But America has always been extremely divided on what should we settle on the regular time or the daylight saving time?

373
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:18,080
Scott: Well, it also depends how close you live to the edge of a time zone.

374
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,320
Rym: Yeah, I live six hundred miles away from where I used to live, and yet I'm in the same time zone.

375
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:27,998
Rym: So I had way more daylight at night when I was young than I do in New York, despite living in the same time zone.

376
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:33,512
Rym: Sun went down in like July at like nine.

377
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,820
Scott: Even in Rochester was is farther west, right?

378
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,812
Rym: So Rochester is about halfway to where I lived.

379
00:24:38,832 --> 00:24:40,820
Rym: A little more actually, a little more than halfway.

380
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,373
Rym: But I've always been an advocate of I don't care.

381
00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:46,120
Rym: I can be pitch black when I wake up.

382
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,192
Rym: I just want as much daylight as possible when I'm not at work.

383
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:50,638
Scott: That's my all.

384
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:51,220
Rym: That's all I want.

385
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,580
Rym: I literally do not care about any other concern personally than that one.

386
00:24:55,283 --> 00:24:57,099
Scott: Well, it has to be dark when I'm sleeping, too.

387
00:24:57,703 --> 00:24:58,064
Scott: Oh, yeah.

388
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:58,467
Scott: It's not.

389
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:00,980
Scott: it's not healthy to sleep with the sun shining on you.

390
00:25:01,481 --> 00:25:01,682
Scott: Right.

391
00:25:02,024 --> 00:25:04,998
Scott: And it is healthy to be outside while the sun is out.

392
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:05,400
Scott: Right.

393
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:20,280
Scott: But during the winter, if I'm right, I want to maximize the amount of time I'm awake in the sun and also dark when asleep and minimize the asleep wake time and the asleep sun time and the awake dark time.

394
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:21,001
Rym: Yep.

395
00:25:21,342 --> 00:25:29,760
Rym: But the problem with living in the part of America we live in and many places have this problem in the winter, I wake up to go to work.

396
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,542
Rym: It's dark out.

397
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,043
Rym: I go to work.

398
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:31,745
Rym: I come home.

399
00:25:32,186 --> 00:25:37,020
Rym: The sun is setting as I'm leaving work, basically, or dark when I leave work.

400
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,540
Rym: Yeah.

401
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:40,226
Rym: Though what's interesting is a lot of people.

402
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:46,120
Rym: Well, a lot of people who are very loud, but might not or not are definitely not actually a majority of people.

403
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:58,920
Rym: Their primary complaint about the plan that's going to happen, which is the one that's actually, as far as I can tell, majority popular of go to daylight saving time, meaning it gets light later and gets dark later and staying there.

404
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:13,100
Rym: The complaint against it that's primarily raised is either an archaic agricultural argument that's just not relevant to the modern era or parents complaining that kids will have to get up in the dark and that those.

405
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,320
Scott: Right.

406
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,107
Scott: So first of all, I even with the clocks that switch all the time, I got up in the dark a lot.

407
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:18,488
Scott: Yeah.

408
00:26:18,528 --> 00:26:26,860
Rym: So elementary, middle and high school, I got up before the sun rose pretty much all all school year except like May and June.

409
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:28,342
Scott: Yeah.

410
00:26:28,402 --> 00:26:28,843
Scott: That was not.

411
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:32,029
Scott: I mean, it wasn't like all the time, but it was it was almost all the time.

412
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:32,390
Scott: It's like.

413
00:26:32,811 --> 00:26:33,011
Scott: Yeah.

414
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:37,380
Rym: So but additionally, I guess what I'm saying is the only reason that happens.

415
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,263
Rym: That is not because of daylight saving time.

416
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:44,832
Rym: That is because America is so broken that parents need daycare and school to be the same thing.

417
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:50,240
Rym: And school has to start before parents have to be at work.

418
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,630
Rym: There's a lot of reasons why this is a problem.

419
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,255
Rym: that are not because of the time change.

420
00:26:55,495 --> 00:26:56,960
Rym: They're because of society being broken.

421
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:09,091
Scott: Similarly, I feel like this is, you know, you should just if you need if whatever you're doing right requires some sort of, you know, difference of time, change your damn schedule.

422
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:11,773
Scott: Tell your school says your local school systems.

423
00:27:11,793 --> 00:27:13,735
Scott: You be like, hey, make school start later.

424
00:27:13,835 --> 00:27:14,956
Scott: Make tell your job.

425
00:27:15,297 --> 00:27:16,197
Scott: I'm coming in later.

426
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,158
Scott: I'm coming in earlier.

427
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:18,800
Scott: You know, sort your shit out.

428
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:22,204
Rym: Yeah, but our society is incapable of that.

429
00:27:22,444 --> 00:27:29,274
Rym: But the other complaint and I even found an article talking about the last because the US did this in the 70s during the oil crisis.

430
00:27:29,574 --> 00:27:33,760
Rym: We went to DSC permanently for a while and then we went back and a lot of people hated it.

431
00:27:34,281 --> 00:27:41,720
Rym: But even back then, the primary argument was that kids are going to get hit by cars in the morning because it's dark.

432
00:27:42,281 --> 00:27:50,531
Scott: So studies actually show that there's less car accidents and basically daylight savings time is good for health and environment.

433
00:27:50,651 --> 00:27:51,673
Scott: Yeah.

434
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,075
Scott: Less electric light usage.

435
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:53,896
Rym: Yeah.

436
00:27:54,176 --> 00:27:57,240
Scott: You know, we're saving on energy if we stay in daylight savings time.

437
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,042
Rym: Well, they like saving time.

438
00:27:59,082 --> 00:28:00,364
Rym: There's no S on the end of that.

439
00:28:00,784 --> 00:28:01,185
Scott: Whatever.

440
00:28:03,027 --> 00:28:13,980
Scott: We also, you know, when the clocks regard, I guess it doesn't matter which one of the two clocks you go to, but the changing messes up a lot of changing of the clocks.

441
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:22,028
Scott: There are quite a lot of car crashes and other problems of like sleepy people in the morning after the clock rolls forward.

442
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,831
Rym: And when it rolls back, it happens in both time changes.

443
00:28:25,492 --> 00:28:25,772
Scott: Right.

444
00:28:25,852 --> 00:28:28,795
Scott: And not to mention, you know, just the health impact.

445
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:32,419
Scott: People will live longer and be healthier by getting more sunlight.

446
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:33,280
Scott: It's going to add up.

447
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,162
Rym: But even worse, get this back then in the.

448
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:37,363
Scott: maybe they'll be more.

449
00:28:37,543 --> 00:28:41,366
Scott: maybe there could be more skin cancer, but it's like that.

450
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:42,587
Scott: That's other things.

451
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:45,909
Rym: That's a problem that is also caused by other problems.

452
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:47,771
Rym: That is a much broader conversation.

453
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:57,118
Rym: But so even in the 70s, there was technically an uptick in kids being hit by cars on the way to school in the morning when it was dark.

454
00:28:57,418 --> 00:29:00,020
Rym: But that uptick was statistically insignificant.

455
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:07,470
Rym: And furthermore, there was a statistically significant decrease in kids being hit by cars after school.

456
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:09,833
Rym: So it was better even then.

457
00:29:09,913 --> 00:29:14,740
Rym: And the people who said it was dangerous were being disingenuous and lying to you.

458
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,463
Scott: So also in the 70s.

459
00:29:17,683 --> 00:29:17,943
Scott: Right.

460
00:29:18,144 --> 00:29:20,407
Scott: You know, kids were still walking to school.

461
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:24,112
Rym: Also in the 70s, America was still extremely lead poisoned.

462
00:29:24,753 --> 00:29:27,777
Rym: There was a lot of things going on with cars in the 70s.

463
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:29,880
Scott: Never mind the fact that still are going on.

464
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,125
Rym: Well, never mind the final point I wanted to get to that I think you were about to get to unrelated to me.

465
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:39,949
Rym: The problem there is that cars are hitting kids regardless of the light.

466
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,651
Scott: Exactly.

467
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:42,992
Rym: That's the problem.

468
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:46,755
Rym: So I'm really excited about this.

469
00:29:47,236 --> 00:29:52,220
Rym: So the weirdest thing is that no one expected this to pass.

470
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,081
Rym: The U.S.

471
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:58,707
Rym: government has made motions to do this almost every term for as long as we've been alive.

472
00:29:58,747 --> 00:30:00,248
Rym: This topic comes up every year.

473
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:11,520
Rym: It's majority popular and it doesn't pass for reasons because a handful of senators and lobbyists and interest groups will argue against it, mostly for ridiculous or capitalist based reasons.

474
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:16,483
Rym: It passed this time kind of by accident.

475
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:24,289
Rym: Basically, the Senate used a procedure known as unanimous consent, where basically the Senate says no.

476
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:30,053
Rym: OK, I guess the Senate has a really stupid rule about the filibuster needing 60 votes and all this nonsense.

477
00:30:30,113 --> 00:30:33,755
Rym: But you can always say, hey, everybody, unanimous consent.

478
00:30:34,115 --> 00:30:35,756
Rym: Does anyone disagree with this?

479
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:38,598
Rym: Because if no one does, we can just pass it right now.

480
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:40,219
Scott: And that never happens.

481
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,800
Scott: Common sense.

482
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,102
Rym: It never happens.

483
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:47,144
Scott: Because if someone says, hey, can we just have universal health care right now?

484
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:49,706
Scott: Someone's gonna be like, fuck, no, I'm not going to let that happen.

485
00:30:49,746 --> 00:30:57,452
Rym: So noted piece of shit, Senator Tom Cotton discovered after this passed that it passed and was mad about it.

486
00:30:58,293 --> 00:31:08,660
Rym: Apparently, his aides didn't bother telling him that this was going to come up for a fast track vote because they assumed that, one, nobody cares about this issue.

487
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,245
Rym: Two, there's no way it's going to pass.

488
00:31:11,466 --> 00:31:13,029
Rym: And three, there's other stuff going on.

489
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:14,472
Rym: So we're not going to bother him about it.

490
00:31:15,193 --> 00:31:16,095
Scott: So, yeah.

491
00:31:16,957 --> 00:31:18,239
Rym: Fuck you, Senator Tom Cotton.

492
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:18,560
Scott: We won.

493
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,361
Scott: This is what I keep.

494
00:31:19,441 --> 00:31:22,966
Scott: I've said this before, is that like these senators are a bunch of old people.

495
00:31:23,086 --> 00:31:27,512
Scott: If you are willing to do dirty tricks, like make sure their aides don't even know.

496
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:27,993
Scott: Right.

497
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:29,836
Scott: It just you could slip shit through.

498
00:31:30,116 --> 00:31:32,940
Scott: You just got to be dirty and not care about being dirty.

499
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:34,142
Scott: It can happen.

500
00:31:34,322 --> 00:31:35,764
Scott: It proof it happened once.

501
00:31:35,844 --> 00:31:36,004
Scott: Right.

502
00:31:36,084 --> 00:31:37,186
Scott: It's going to be pretty hard.

503
00:31:37,246 --> 00:31:39,669
Scott: It's going to be harder to slip something more meaningful.

504
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:45,236
Scott: You do like you announce a Taco Tuesdays, but you try to, I don't know, disband the U.S.

505
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:46,418
Scott: military completely.

506
00:31:46,478 --> 00:31:47,960
Scott: It would be harder to slip that through.

507
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:59,820
Rym: You announce a Taco Tuesdays for all the staff and aides, and you only announce it to the Republican staff and aides, and then you lock them all in the Taco Tuesday long enough to pass universal health care and the new Voting Rights Act.

508
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,401
Scott: It could happen.

509
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:02,824
Scott: It really could.

510
00:32:04,326 --> 00:32:05,307
Scott: They got their way.

511
00:32:05,347 --> 00:32:06,489
Scott: The rules are so wacky.

512
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,014
Scott: It's like the good of success.

513
00:32:10,214 --> 00:32:12,377
Scott: The consequences of failure are nothing.

514
00:32:12,678 --> 00:32:14,120
Scott: Your status quo is maintained.

515
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:18,908
Scott: The consequences of success are enormous benefit to all society.

516
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:22,273
Scott: Why wouldn't you constantly try it every damn day?

517
00:32:22,494 --> 00:32:22,794
Scott: Yep.

518
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:26,480
Scott: If there was a negative consequence, OK, stop trying.

519
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:33,840
Rym: So there is an example of that that was briefly attempted relatively recently, but they didn't go all the way because it wasn't going to succeed.

520
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:47,880
Rym: There is the concept of the reverse filibuster, where you bring something up for a vote, and of course, some Republican is going to filibuster it, and then you vote against your own bill, and then you bring it up for a vote again.

521
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,662
Rym: And you wait for them to filibuster it.

522
00:32:49,823 --> 00:32:52,408
Rym: You vote against your own bill, and you just never stop.

523
00:32:54,211 --> 00:32:55,574
Rym: But that's real hard to pull off.

524
00:32:55,995 --> 00:32:58,760
Rym: It hasn't been done successfully for anything important, ever.

525
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:10,294
Scott: You can just make all your senators as endurance athletes, and you keep it going until some of those old dudes die because they're so old.

526
00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:15,460
Scott: They'll literally die there, and you're young enough, you'll live, and then you can pass.

527
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,502
Scott: It's like, I'm just going to outlive you.

528
00:33:18,702 --> 00:33:19,142
Scott: Let's go.

529
00:33:19,743 --> 00:33:21,585
Scott: And you know what?

530
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:35,338
Scott: I mean, if I was a younger endurance athlete type person, it's like, you're telling me all I've got to do is out-endurance an old guy, and I can do something that will have a significant beneficial impact on all of society?

531
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:36,980
Scott: Why would you not do that?

532
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:38,973
Rym: That's an easy one.

533
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:45,180
Rym: The other thing this is going to do for me personally is, you know, my day job is in capital markets, and daylight saving time.

534
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,309
Scott: You've got to set all your clocks, your favorite, your specialty.

535
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,680
Scott: Everyone's going to be looking to hire a Rym to get the clocks right.

536
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:57,560
Rym: So of all things, get this, I can't obviously share any details, but I am far, one, NTP, mostly obsolete.

537
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,160
Scott: Well, NTP isn't even a thing anymore.

538
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:05,079
Rym: I mean, it is, but it's not, like, I would use it at home because it's easy and it works, but it's not how...

539
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,220
Scott: There are newer, better things.

540
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,322
Rym: There are newer, better ways to do that.

541
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:10,324
Rym: That problem is way more solved.

542
00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:14,751
Rym: But also, my job, I don't log into physical servers anymore.

543
00:34:14,812 --> 00:34:17,114
Rym: Like, I'm not setting the clocks like I used to.

544
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:20,760
Rym: I'm not giving lectures on how to set clocks like I literally used to.

545
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:28,896
Rym: Today, literally, unrelatedly, someone messages me inside of the company and they're like, "Hey, we're having a problem.

546
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:30,139
Rym: We heard you could help us with

547
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:30,239
Rym: it.".

548
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:37,699
Rym: Long story short, it was about the nuances of all the different timestamps in the fix protocol related.

549
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:46,300
Rym: And it was basically, I was asked to fix a clock problem because even though I'm a senior product manager who, like, doesn't, like, I don't even see source code.

550
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,458
Rym: I don't have access to get, like, I'm not allowed to interact with that stuff.

551
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,829
Rym: Somehow, everybody knows, "Oh yeah, Rym, that's the clock guy.

552
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:53,551
Rym: He knows clocks.

553
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,393
Rym: He knows this shit.

554
00:34:54,715 --> 00:34:55,117
Rym: Go bug

555
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:55,357
Rym: him.".

556
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,103
Scott: The fixed clock guy.

557
00:34:57,224 --> 00:34:58,648
Scott: Oh, we have a fixed clock problem.

558
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,036
Scott: That's why they hired you, to do that.

559
00:35:01,237 --> 00:35:02,160
Scott: That's what your job is.

560
00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:10,536
Rym: It's just, it's the domino meme of Rym learns an archaic and obscure set of two unrelated protocols in 2003 at a job at IBM.

561
00:35:12,842 --> 00:35:16,120
Rym: And now, to this day, he's the clock fixed guy forever.

562
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:17,960
Scott: Yeah, that's how it goes.

563
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:21,540
Rym: So, you have some news about our slightly better governor?

564
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,300
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, I was at the hockey game and it was Women's Empowerment Night, right?

565
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:32,299
Scott: Where they, you know, fake, you know, but it's still, you know, a fake corporate.

566
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,120
Scott: Oh, it's all performative.

567
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,900
Scott: Washing, yeah, performative, whatever.

568
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,200
Rym: Reputation laundering, performative nonsense.

569
00:35:40,102 --> 00:35:44,740
Scott: Yes, but the governor was in attendance, the governor of New York, to drop the puck.

570
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:48,900
Rym: Who, you must remember, is not Governor Cuomo, who is a piece of shit.

571
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:51,267
Scott: Yeah, he did a bunch of pieces.

572
00:35:51,388 --> 00:35:54,020
Scott: He made some piece of shit stuff going on today, but we're not going to talk about it.

573
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,147
Scott: Oh, no, fuck him.

574
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,340
Rym: We'll hope he just disappears from the limelight permanently.

575
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,660
Scott: He's trying to undisappear as of today.

576
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:21,280
Rym: But, because he basically was drum rolled out, the person who replaced him by procedure, Governor Hochul, not the best, pretty centrist, like, et cetera, right, but kind of a secret crypto progressive in that she has a way of saying very centrist things, but historically has done very progressive things.

577
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:30,040
Scott: Right, well, she's sort of like our mayor, where one minute the mayor will be like real progressive, and the next minute the mayor is like, let's bring, let's boost up the cops.

578
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,225
Rym: He's like, we're going to have bike lanes.

579
00:36:32,265 --> 00:36:32,807
Rym: That's good.

580
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:33,950
Rym: And more cops.

581
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:35,013
Rym: That's bad.

582
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:36,557
Rym: The cops will be more diverse.

583
00:36:37,038 --> 00:36:37,660
Rym: That's good.

584
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:40,055
Rym: The cops are still doing what the cops have always done.

585
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:40,639
Rym: That's bad.

586
00:36:41,044 --> 00:36:42,039
Rym: The cops don't have guns.

587
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:46,159
Scott: We're going to cut money from the schools and the sanitation department, but not the cops.

588
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:46,700
Scott: Yeah.

589
00:36:48,022 --> 00:36:50,529
Scott: But the governor is a lot of the same thing, right?

590
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:52,835
Scott: We got one minute the governor will do something good.

591
00:36:52,895 --> 00:36:54,620
Scott: The next minute the governor will do something bad, right?

592
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:08,091
Scott: So I was very, before I even sort of realized, because I wasn't paying that much attention, before I even realized that the governor was coming out to drop the puck, there were boos raining down from all over the garden.

593
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:12,400
Scott: Now, nobody quite knows why the boos are raining down.

594
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,831
Scott: Now, clearly some of the boos were from Republicans in attendance, right?

595
00:37:17,012 --> 00:37:21,020
Scott: Even though New York is very progressive, I got to say that's probably like 30%.

596
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:26,880
Rym: No, two of the recent hockey games I've gone to, a Trumpy MAGA chant started in the...

597
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,848
Scott: No, that's one guy who's like in the section behind us.

598
00:37:30,671 --> 00:37:32,276
Scott: He's usually doing it by himself.

599
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:33,800
Scott: He's just a loud, obnoxious dude.

600
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,260
Rym: No, there was a big one happening outside MSG a few weeks ago.

601
00:37:39,521 --> 00:37:41,279
Scott: I think it's that one guy who tries to start it.

602
00:37:42,621 --> 00:37:46,579
Rym: Luckily he has mixed levels of success, but not zero, which is the point.

603
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:52,020
Scott: The couple times he's done that, I've seen also people yell back at him.

604
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:55,540
Rym: I think I yelled back at him the last time we were at a game together.

605
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:56,703
Scott: I don't know.

606
00:37:57,104 --> 00:38:04,060
Scott: But anyway, there are clearly people there who are just right-wing people at a hockey game.

607
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:12,320
Scott: There's also, you're at a sporting event, I think it's probably going to skew more right than left, even in New York.

608
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:16,920
Scott: More right than the society surrounding the sport.

609
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:20,396
Rym: Well, New York City is very progressive as an entity.

610
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,351
Scott: The heat outside Madison Square Garden is 70/30.

611
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:32,599
Scott: Inside the garden is going to probably be more like 60/40, because you've got people from Jersey, Connecticut, other people coming in.

612
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:38,240
Rym: But also it's expensive, so you're over-representing wealthier people and tech pros.

613
00:38:39,061 --> 00:38:41,400
Scott: You're over-representing white people, because it's ice hockey.

614
00:38:42,843 --> 00:38:54,196
Scott: And you're over-representing men, and you're over-representing people who are toxic masculinity, representing misogynist people who are like, "Ugh, sports!

615
00:38:54,317 --> 00:38:54,819
Scott: Ugh!".

616
00:38:55,885 --> 00:38:58,860
Scott: So, you know, those people were booing, for sure.

617
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:07,840
Scott: And I think that the other factor was that even people, they're progressive people at the garden, because it's New York.

618
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:09,296
Scott: And they're going to boo, too.

619
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:16,920
Rym: It's like our old mayor, de Blasio, he was way more on-paper progressive than our current mayor.

620
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:31,280
Rym: But at the same time, he was so ineffectual that he would be booed by, like, the cops would turn their backs on him because they'd say he hates cops, yet we would boo him because he didn't defund the cops and in fact was singing their praises.

621
00:39:32,944 --> 00:39:35,536
Scott: I heard one person yell at the governor, "Go back

622
00:39:35,616 --> 00:39:36,058
Scott: upstate.".

623
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:39,739
Scott: So that was clearly a city person, right?

624
00:39:41,364 --> 00:39:53,980
Rym: One thing I should point out about Hochul, because a lot of people don't realize this, she's from western New York, which is an interesting place because the cities there, deeper blue than New York City, like, for real.

625
00:39:54,883 --> 00:39:56,060
Scott: That's like labor union town.

626
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:02,660
Rym: But the areas around those cities, they're not the deepest red in the state, but they're like the third deepest red areas in the state.

627
00:40:03,162 --> 00:40:11,620
Rym: But that area also has a lot of relatively pragmatic politics, more so than, like, the parts north of Albany that just go crazy.

628
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:20,700
Rym: So you get a weird situation where western New York, where she's from, she's very popular there because she toes a very centrist line, but has actually pushed a lot of progressive stuff through.

629
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:39,520
Scott: Anyway, so she was booed, mightily, in that one of the major issues that's going on, that's been going on in New York for a while, that we haven't talked about on the show, but I don't think really needs a whole episode, which might have related to the booing, is this bail reform issue.

630
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:53,100
Rym: If you're not from the US, in America, we have a really fucked up system where if you commit a crime, or you are accused of a crime, and you're gonna have a trial, the judge will decide if you stay in jail until your trial,

631
00:40:53,642 --> 00:40:54,045
Scott: or if you're

632
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,180
Rym: allowed to leave and come back for your trial.

633
00:40:56,382 --> 00:40:58,420
Scott: You're still presumed innocent, right?

634
00:40:58,964 --> 00:41:04,440
Scott: You haven't gone to trial and been found guilty, so you're an innocent person, but there's a concern.

635
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:10,280
Scott: It's A, you were at least suspected enough of a crime that you were arrested, right?

636
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:15,160
Scott: And presumably some evidence that it was enough to arrest you and bring you to a court.

637
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,980
Rym: Presumably because of a news we'll talk about next Thursday.

638
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:18,762
Scott: Right.

639
00:41:20,315 --> 00:41:20,859
Scott: So there's that.

640
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:30,227
Scott: And so now it's like, okay, well, if we let you go, because your trial isn't gonna be today, so we have two choices.

641
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:36,453
Scott: We can let you go, and it's like, are you gonna come back to your trial, or are you gonna run?

642
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:37,700
Scott: Even if you're innocent, you might run.

643
00:41:38,482 --> 00:41:40,120
Scott: You have good reason to run, even if you're innocent.

644
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,492
Scott: And so there's that question.

645
00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:43,280
Scott: That's question one.

646
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:48,540
Rym: That's also the question, are you likely a danger to yourself or others during this period?

647
00:41:49,282 --> 00:41:49,463
Scott: Right.

648
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:55,660
Scott: So for example, there might be someone who is a mass shooter, a common occurrence in the United States, sadly.

649
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,142
Scott: Right.

650
00:41:56,464 --> 00:42:02,559
Scott: And it's like, you see the cops, see the person mass shooting, and they arrest them somehow without killing them.

651
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:09,622
Scott: And it's like, okay, this person didn't have a trial yet, but it's like, there they are on video, mass shooting.

652
00:42:10,184 --> 00:42:17,244
Scott: It's like, even if we know this person 100% will come back for their trial somehow, I don't know why.

653
00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:18,368
Scott: Right.

654
00:42:18,649 --> 00:42:22,966
Scott: It's like, are you just gonna let this person walk around the street until their trial?

655
00:42:22,986 --> 00:42:25,340
Scott: They're gonna mass shoot again, probably.

656
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:29,460
Scott: So it's in our interest and it's common sense.

657
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:38,540
Scott: But the way this system works is you put this person somewhere, do something such that this person is not free until the time of their trial.

658
00:42:38,701 --> 00:42:43,140
Rym: But our system is really weird in that you basically, the judge will define an amount of money.

659
00:42:43,220 --> 00:43:00,020
Rym: Sometimes they set no bail, but they set an amount of money, meaning you have to put this cash up and you get it back if you show up for your court date, giving you another incentive to show up other than if you don't show up for a court date, you're literally a fugitive and you're kind of fucked anyway.

660
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:17,546
Scott: And if you can't afford that amount of money, you have this private system of bail bondsmen who will, basically, they'll pay your bail, you pay them some of the bail, like a fee, like 10%.

661
00:43:17,546 --> 00:43:17,786
Scott: Right.

662
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:18,890
Scott: They pay the bail.

663
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:21,980
Scott: And then when you show up to court, well, they get their money back.

664
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,649
Scott: But they've made a profit because you don't get your money back.

665
00:43:25,553 --> 00:43:35,223
Scott: So it's like if Rym had a million dollar bail because he was evil and then Rym would pay the bail bondsman a hundred K and then the bail bondsman would pay a million to the court.

666
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:41,319
Scott: And then when Rym shows up to trial, the bail bondsman gets back their million so that all they got was a free hundred K.

667
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:50,100
Rym: But if I don't show up, the bail bondsman literally becomes a bounty hunter with no small support from the US legal system.

668
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:50,880
Scott: Right.

669
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:58,180
Scott: So that bail bondsman is now Rym, that bail bondsman is like, well, I have to go get Rym and drag him to court to get a million dollars.

670
00:43:58,861 --> 00:43:59,082
Scott: Right.

671
00:43:59,282 --> 00:44:00,266
Scott: They're going to fucking do it.

672
00:44:00,486 --> 00:44:07,098
Rym: Now, if you need to know how obviously unfair racist broken the system is, I'm sure like John Oliver has done a very long episode about it.

673
00:44:07,921 --> 00:44:08,663
Scott: Yeah, probably.

674
00:44:09,805 --> 00:44:11,609
Scott: But yeah, it's all kinds of fucked up.

675
00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:25,440
Scott: And the problem is, is that people in New York are making all of these either ignorant or bad faith arguments that somehow like rising crime is related to the fact that we reformed our bail system.

676
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,750
Scott: We made it slightly better.

677
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:27,254
Scott: Right.

678
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:27,959
Scott: A year or two ago.

679
00:44:28,381 --> 00:44:30,365
Rym: What else could be causing rising crime?

680
00:44:30,966 --> 00:44:42,060
Rym: Extreme depression caused by social isolation, a global pandemic, a war, a crushed economy, the failing of basic social services, the collapsing infrastructure.

681
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:43,681
Rym: Right.

682
00:44:43,902 --> 00:44:48,957
Scott: But basically, we know why the crime is going up, but they're basically like, it's like, what the fuck does?

683
00:44:49,137 --> 00:44:50,000
Scott: bail has nothing?

684
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:56,740
Scott: Even if there wasn't all those other things that we knew, even if what was making crime go up was a mystery.

685
00:44:57,101 --> 00:44:57,321
Scott: Right.

686
00:44:57,381 --> 00:45:03,316
Scott: And even if crime was actually going up a lot, which it isn't, it's inflated and it's going.

687
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:05,040
Rym: it's gone up and is going up.

688
00:45:05,241 --> 00:45:09,180
Scott: But that's from those statistics are reported by cops themselves.

689
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:20,460
Rym: But also more to the point, technically going up is really misleading when you remember that it's going up from some of the lowest crime rates in like recorded history.

690
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:25,820
Scott: It's like, oh, the crime went down, you know, a thousand percent since ten years ago.

691
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,340
Rym: And then it doubled last year because there were two murders instead of one.

692
00:45:30,142 --> 00:45:30,404
Scott: Yeah.

693
00:45:30,524 --> 00:45:32,136
Scott: It's like it's actually way low.

694
00:45:32,156 --> 00:45:32,639
Scott: Right.

695
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,265
Scott: But really, bail is stupid.

696
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:39,196
Rym: A judge should just decide, is this person going to show up to court or not?

697
00:45:39,397 --> 00:45:40,620
Rym: Are they dangerous or not?

698
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,700
Rym: That should be the sole decision that gets made.

699
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:43,663
Scott: That's it.

700
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:44,850
Scott: It should either be yes or no.

701
00:45:44,891 --> 00:45:46,480
Scott: There should be no bail whatsoever.

702
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:53,480
Scott: And there's people in New York basically blaming the, you know, thinking that because we got rid of bail, that somehow crime is a problem.

703
00:45:53,600 --> 00:46:01,700
Scott: And it's like if if there really is a crime committed by some repeat offender that is out on the street, then why they shouldn't have been there.

704
00:46:01,961 --> 00:46:02,101
Scott: What?

705
00:46:02,121 --> 00:46:03,589
Scott: Why did the judge let them out?

706
00:46:03,669 --> 00:46:05,800
Scott: Why should we let that person out on a bail?

707
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:08,668
Scott: It's like they'll commit, you know, it's like they shouldn't be.

708
00:46:08,788 --> 00:46:12,680
Scott: any circumstance, no matter no amount of money that should allow them to go.

709
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:19,240
Rym: If Roberto comes back to prison a second time for a stabbing, you don't let him out until you have a trial.

710
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:19,861
Scott: Yeah.

711
00:46:19,901 --> 00:46:21,145
Scott: It's like no period.

712
00:46:21,185 --> 00:46:26,120
Scott: You can't go back out, not even for a million or 10 million or 100 million, guaranteeing that you'll come back.

713
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:31,220
Scott: It's like there should be no circumstance that you get out and then until your trial is done.

714
00:46:31,961 --> 00:46:40,460
Scott: You know, B, it's like if there isn't a reason to if we're pretty sure you're going to come back and regardless of guilt or innocence.

715
00:46:40,781 --> 00:46:40,941
Scott: Right.

716
00:46:40,961 --> 00:46:43,649
Scott: All you did was like, I don't know, Rob.

717
00:46:43,749 --> 00:46:47,320
Scott: You know, you're you're accused of, I don't know if I can rob in a convenience store.

718
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:47,841
Scott: Right.

719
00:46:47,922 --> 00:46:49,126
Scott: You weren't even armed or anything.

720
00:46:49,246 --> 00:46:49,607
Scott: It's like.

721
00:46:49,627 --> 00:46:51,594
Scott: it's like, is that person really?

722
00:46:51,654 --> 00:46:53,280
Scott: it's like what they could do, rob another convenience store.

723
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,947
Rym: It's like if they do.

724
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:55,530
Rym: Yeah.

725
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,540
Rym: Don't let him out a second time until they have their first.

726
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:57,941
Rym: Yeah.

727
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,849
Rym: Like human judges.

728
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,460
Rym: The point of a judge is to make someone was smoking weed.

729
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,096
Scott: It's someone was smoking, you know, not someone who was caught with a bunch of cocaine.

730
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,000
Scott: Were they hurting anybody?

731
00:47:07,502 --> 00:47:09,391
Scott: You know, they were just smoking cocaine, sorting it.

732
00:47:09,511 --> 00:47:10,857
Rym: What's the worst case scenario?

733
00:47:10,897 --> 00:47:11,480
Rym: if we let them out?

734
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,967
Rym: They're going to do a bunch more cocaine before their court date.

735
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:14,830
Rym: Like, sure.

736
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:18,060
Rym: I mean, cocaine shouldn't even be illegal, but that's a separate situation.

737
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,687
Scott: Some guy had some meth and you arrested him.

738
00:47:20,727 --> 00:47:21,430
Scott: It's like, why?

739
00:47:21,731 --> 00:47:24,120
Scott: Why are we paying money to put that person in jail?

740
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,153
Scott: I should clarify, cocaine should not be cause money to lock that person up.

741
00:47:28,314 --> 00:47:30,160
Scott: Why are we spending that money for no reason?

742
00:47:30,521 --> 00:47:30,681
Scott: Yep.

743
00:47:32,867 --> 00:47:35,354
Rym: Anyway, so Hoekel did something.

744
00:47:35,374 --> 00:47:36,437
Rym: We didn't actually talk about the news.

745
00:47:36,477 --> 00:47:37,480
Scott: We just talked about bail.

746
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:37,960
Scott: Right.

747
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:42,593
Scott: So basically, you know, the governor basically sort of does things secretly.

748
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:42,874
Scott: Right.

749
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:44,980
Scott: We don't know what she's going to do until she does it.

750
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,944
Scott: She's a very backroom kind of dealer.

751
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:47,605
Scott: Right.

752
00:47:48,086 --> 00:47:55,580
Scott: But yeah, they're basically she's going the bad route on this one and is trying to support undoing some of the bail reforms.

753
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:59,859
Rym: Probably because bail reform is very popular in the cities and very unpopular.

754
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,707
Scott: There's this big, you know, message.

755
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:08,180
Scott: that's, you know, completely false of like, you know, scare mongering people about crime.

756
00:48:08,521 --> 00:48:11,089
Scott: You open up a newspaper or a news TV thing.

757
00:48:11,129 --> 00:48:14,860
Scott: It's just constantly crime and fear mongering, you know, all the time.

758
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,911
Scott: That's the only news story they report is like murder in your neighborhood.

759
00:48:17,951 --> 00:48:18,994
Scott: Someone got mugged.

760
00:48:19,014 --> 00:48:20,620
Scott: It's like, you know, don't go outside.

761
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,266
Scott: It's dangerous in a house.

762
00:48:22,286 --> 00:48:22,688
Scott: Gave out.

763
00:48:22,728 --> 00:48:22,848
Scott: Yeah.

764
00:48:22,868 --> 00:48:23,872
Rym: You know, it's more dangerous.

765
00:48:24,093 --> 00:48:26,060
Rym: All the fires happening from our people.

766
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,304
Scott: I don't even know what.

767
00:48:27,585 --> 00:48:27,806
Scott: Yeah.

768
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:31,400
Scott: People don't even know what the fuck bail is or like, oh, they got rid of bail.

769
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:37,020
Scott: That means they're letting dangerous people roam around the street instead of keeping them locked up because of the bail reform.

770
00:48:37,601 --> 00:48:37,903
Scott: Right.

771
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:39,333
Scott: It's like that.

772
00:48:39,413 --> 00:48:40,259
Scott: None of that is true.

773
00:48:42,701 --> 00:48:49,120
Scott: It's safer to let your kids walk around the street now than it probably was in the in the fifties when all this people who are currently scared walked around the street.

774
00:48:49,621 --> 00:48:52,771
Rym: Also, when everyone was lead addled from leaded gasoline.

775
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,897
Rym: I'm terrified to decide.

776
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:55,800
Rym: I was saving this for Monday.

777
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,820
Rym: But just so remember, I always talked about that idea that lead poisoning was a primary cause of violence.

778
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,022
Scott: It's not an idea.

779
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:02,784
Scott: It's it's known.

780
00:49:02,885 --> 00:49:08,060
Rym: So a recent study actually went way further and like proved it more thoroughly.

781
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:14,554
Rym: And the cutoff line for measurable effects is anyone born after 1981 is below the level on the cutoff.

782
00:49:17,701 --> 00:49:24,400
Rym: We are we are according to that large study, we are just past the cutoff on no cognitive impairment from lead.

783
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:31,280
Scott: So basically any United States inhabitant from who was born prior to 1981.

784
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:31,421
Scott: Yeah.

785
00:49:31,621 --> 00:49:36,220
Scott: You know, this isn't an insult to them, but it's like there was lead in the atmosphere.

786
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,786
Scott: I think they should be able to claim, right.

787
00:49:38,846 --> 00:49:43,519
Scott: Increase your disability and get reparations from the auto industry.

788
00:49:48,909 --> 00:49:52,757
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, I got a real simple one.

789
00:49:52,837 --> 00:49:54,620
Rym: This is a video or not.

790
00:49:55,100 --> 00:50:06,040
Rym: Technically, it's a film reel that has been turned into a video from 1943, produced by the Signal Corps for the commanding general of the United States Army Ground Forces.

791
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:10,940
Rym: It was it was a restricted, classified video that, of course, is now just public domain.

792
00:50:11,702 --> 00:50:14,108
Rym: And it is called Crack That Tank.

793
00:50:15,331 --> 00:50:22,145
Rym: Might be a little on the nose considering the current global situation, but it's basically a training video aimed at U.S.

794
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:32,040
Rym: soldiers that tells them in 1943 exactly how, as infantry, to take out extremely advanced tanks of that era.

795
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,436
Scott: But there is that era with but with equipment of that era.

796
00:50:35,456 --> 00:50:36,080
Scott: Exactly.

797
00:50:36,624 --> 00:50:39,060
Scott: We have better equipment now, but we also have better tanks.

798
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:46,119
Rym: What's interesting is anti-tank equipment advanced far more than tank equipment did.

799
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,906
Rym: But that's a topic for another show if you're curious.

800
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:53,740
Rym: Tanks always lose against anti-tanks in the modern world.

801
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:08,360
Rym: So the reason I'm making this my thing of the day is not just because of the Ukraine situation, but this video is interesting because when you watch it, a lot of training videos have this sort of training video sensibility.

802
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,634
Rym: They're almost like a little too bland.

803
00:51:10,654 --> 00:51:11,500
Rym: They get a little boring.

804
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:19,020
Rym: This video is basically this army guy sitting down speaking in plain colloquial language to his audience.

805
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,732
Rym: Like, look, this tank's going to F you up.

806
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:23,220
Rym: So here's the ways to deal with it.

807
00:51:23,501 --> 00:51:24,829
Rym: You got to make sure they can't see you.

808
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:25,614
Rym: How do you do that?

809
00:51:26,198 --> 00:51:26,500
Rym: Do that.

810
00:51:27,203 --> 00:51:29,352
Rym: It's very like it almost sounds like a mobster.

811
00:51:29,452 --> 00:51:30,737
Scott: How not to be seen.

812
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:31,360
Scott: Right.

813
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:40,440
Rym: But military training materials in the US and around the world, but especially in the US are the ones I'm the most familiar with.

814
00:51:40,984 --> 00:51:42,440
Rym: This is something a lot of people don't realize.

815
00:51:42,801 --> 00:51:50,340
Rym: If you're making training material for anything, make it in the colloquial language of the people you're trying to train.

816
00:51:51,182 --> 00:51:58,180
Rym: That includes potentially swearing or using folksy wisdom, like whatever would reach your audience.

817
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,908
Rym: Don't make vanilla, generic, like...

818
00:52:00,928 --> 00:52:04,060
Scott: Everyone's just going to go to sleep if you do the formalized shit.

819
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,032
Rym: This one's more like you try to run away from the tank.

820
00:52:06,053 --> 00:52:06,435
Rym: Guess what?

821
00:52:06,475 --> 00:52:07,160
Rym: It's going to get you.

822
00:52:07,721 --> 00:52:08,990
Rym: You're better off standing your ground.

823
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:09,574
Rym: Here's why.

824
00:52:09,654 --> 00:52:10,017
Rym: Do this.

825
00:52:10,057 --> 00:52:10,420
Rym: Do that.

826
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:17,500
Rym: You can learn a lot from how the US trained soldiers during World War Two, when you're making...

827
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,996
Scott: And you get some of those annual required sexual harassment training videos to be good.

828
00:52:23,861 --> 00:52:24,121
Rym: Right?

829
00:52:24,923 --> 00:52:31,000
Rym: You just need to smart like someone, like the kind of person who would be giving a talk about that kind of topic at like a video game convention.

830
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,506
Rym: Just like, look, here's the deal.

831
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:33,309
Rym: Don't fucking do this.

832
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:34,232
Rym: Don't fucking do that.

833
00:52:35,356 --> 00:52:36,260
Rym: Anyway, what do you got?

834
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,506
Scott: So I got this really short video.

835
00:52:38,566 --> 00:52:41,680
Scott: It's actually a YouTube short, like from the YouTube short section.

836
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:54,240
Scott: I don't know where this dam is or what water it's holding back, but this person, Evan, because that's the YouTube channel, they were visiting a dam and, you know, dams have gates and you can open the gates to let the water through.

837
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,703
Scott: That's how a dam works, right?

838
00:52:56,525 --> 00:53:09,711
Scott: Apparently this dam's gate had been closed for years and it was a kind of dam where on one side, obviously water, on the other side, the ground was very, very long way down.

839
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:11,935
Scott: Way down.

840
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:14,760
Scott: Because the water had been held back so long, right?

841
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:20,631
Scott: The riverbed or whatever, it was like a long ass way down.

842
00:53:20,651 --> 00:53:25,640
Scott: And after all that time, like they opened the dam gate and they captured it on video.

843
00:53:25,881 --> 00:53:30,819
Scott: And it's like, it's pretty amazing to see that water eventually come out of there.

844
00:53:33,145 --> 00:53:34,320
Rym: This is my kind of thing.

845
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,700
Scott: Yeah, you don't see this very often and therefore it's worth seeing.

846
00:53:39,101 --> 00:53:45,480
Rym: In the meta moment, gig nights, possibly just Rym, likely not Scott, maybe rimming someone else.

847
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,729
Rym: Atari game designed Thursday, April 21st, 7 p.m.

848
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:50,093
Rym: Bumblebee Theater.

849
00:53:50,735 --> 00:53:52,500
Rym: This will be pretty much all new content.

850
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,349
Rym: I'll be playing Atari games live for the audience.

851
00:53:56,472 --> 00:54:02,334
Rym: If Paxil let me, depending on the COVID protocols, I might take a volunteer from the audience to try some of these games.

852
00:54:02,354 --> 00:54:03,017
Rym: We'll see what happens.

853
00:54:03,057 --> 00:54:03,740
Rym: It'll be a fun time.

854
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,529
Rym: The book club book is The City We Became.

855
00:54:06,951 --> 00:54:11,927
Rym: I think I'll be done with this book by the end of next week, considering that I'm going to be in London during COVID.

856
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:16,220
Rym: Spent a lot of time sitting in parks and sitting at outdoor pubs.

857
00:54:17,102 --> 00:54:19,700
Scott: We'll give the listener maybe a few weeks after you come back.

858
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:27,860
Rym: Yeah, so I'd say first or second week of April, like whatever the next Thursday episode is that lines up, we're going to do the gig nights book club book episode on The City We Became.

859
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:33,840
Scott: Then I'll probably, I'll probably then select a book that I have already read because I've read many books recently.

860
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,744
Rym: This book is just fucking great.

861
00:54:36,045 --> 00:54:38,671
Rym: It is so up the gig nights alley.

862
00:54:39,052 --> 00:54:47,036
Rym: Every time you, I mean, the premise of the book, like cities or living things, every borough of New York kind of has its own avatar.

863
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:47,979
Rym: There's a bunch going on.

864
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:54,960
Rym: Every one of the borough's avatars that I have encountered so far in this book is just a chef kiss.

865
00:54:57,741 --> 00:54:58,703
Rym: This book is so good.

866
00:55:00,888 --> 00:55:03,996
Rym: Otherwise, catch our stuff slowly.

867
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:05,720
Rym: Content is appearing at conventions.

868
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,164
Rym: We'll see how things go.

869
00:55:07,265 --> 00:55:16,280
Rym: Gig nights will keep doing its thing, but there will be no gig nights next week, except possibly I'm thinking about doing some live streams from London because I'm going to have a lot of downtime stuck in my hotel room.

870
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:19,431
Rym: So you might see a couple of live streams on the gig nights feed.

871
00:55:19,592 --> 00:55:21,620
Rym: I'll talk about things Scott doesn't like to talk about.

872
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,386
Rym: Maybe I'll talk about time and fix.

873
00:55:24,951 --> 00:55:25,433
Scott: Have fun.

874
00:55:25,654 --> 00:55:26,938
Rym: I'll do some fixed training for you all.

875
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:27,420
Rym: That'll be fun.

876
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,201
Rym: All right.

877
00:55:31,063 --> 00:55:33,526
Rym: So I want to be very clear before we get into this main bit.

878
00:55:33,586 --> 00:55:42,360
Rym: This topic, we mean no malign thoughts or intentions toward Ireland or the Irish people.

879
00:55:43,101 --> 00:55:53,800
Rym: Our ire is solely and specifically at the manner in which the average American celebrates what we are about to discuss.

880
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,902
Rym: We are talking about St.

881
00:55:54,942 --> 00:56:03,440
Rym: Patrick's Day or as we referred to it in gig nights in the old forum back in 2010, National Get Wasted Day.

882
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:04,362
Scott: Yep.

883
00:56:05,003 --> 00:56:14,720
Scott: So yeah, as someone who grew up as, you know, a Jew, a non-Irish Jew in the United States, St.

884
00:56:14,761 --> 00:56:19,660
Scott: Patrick's Day was something I didn't know about at all until I was in like kindergarten or first grade.

885
00:56:20,221 --> 00:56:22,769
Scott: And they had like, you know, some green bagels or some shit.

886
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:26,060
Scott: And they were like, you know, this party is something.

887
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:32,616
Rym: Meanwhile, me growing up in Detroit, surrounded by Irish people, partly because my dad was a fireman.

888
00:56:32,636 --> 00:56:34,300
Rym: A lot of firefighters are Irish.

889
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,440
Rym: I spent a lot of time around Irish friends, Irish family, Irish parties, Irish funerals.

890
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:41,445
Rym: So I already had a pretty good idea of St.

891
00:56:41,465 --> 00:56:41,907
Rym: Patrick's Day.

892
00:56:41,927 --> 00:56:46,420
Rym: But when I was very young, it was my second favorite holiday for one and only one reason.

893
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:47,962
Rym: The color green.

894
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:51,632
Rym: Because in preschool, I do like the color green.

895
00:56:51,913 --> 00:56:54,500
Rym: It was the day of wear green or people hit you.

896
00:56:54,961 --> 00:56:55,683
Rym: Wear green.

897
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,407
Rym: And if someone's not wearing green, go get them.

898
00:56:57,908 --> 00:57:02,760
Rym: You go to the preschool, the water tank with all the pump toys had green food coloring in it.

899
00:57:03,181 --> 00:57:06,500
Rym: And it was basically just green day as far as I was concerned as a little kid.

900
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:07,521
Scott: Yeah.

901
00:57:07,722 --> 00:57:10,680
Scott: As a little kid, it was, you know, pretty much green stuff and shamrock day.

902
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,485
Scott: But also because it was called St.

903
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:17,760
Scott: Patrick's Day, I understood that like, yeah, that's a holiday we don't, we're not going to have anything to do with us Jews.

904
00:57:19,382 --> 00:57:23,860
Rym: The other thing, I went to a private Catholic school for first through fourth grade.

905
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,485
Rym: So saints were a big deal.

906
00:57:26,525 --> 00:57:32,700
Rym: And even though even then I was an atheist, I had to pretend to be Catholic or they would kick me out of the school.

907
00:57:33,021 --> 00:57:37,359
Scott: I mean, even to this day, I don't, you know, it's like, yeah, I understand there's a saint named St.

908
00:57:37,399 --> 00:57:37,700
Scott: Patrick.

909
00:57:37,861 --> 00:57:41,040
Scott: I couldn't tell you which saint it was or what he did or why he's got a date.

910
00:57:42,521 --> 00:57:43,425
Rym: That's which one he is.

911
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:45,153
Scott: I know there's a St.

912
00:57:45,194 --> 00:57:46,500
Scott: Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan.

913
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,017
Scott: It's the same saint, but not to St.

914
00:57:50,057 --> 00:57:50,499
Scott: Patrick's.

915
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,504
Rym: But let's skip all that.

916
00:57:51,524 --> 00:57:52,650
Rym: If you want to know the history of St.

917
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,640
Rym: Patrick's Day, read the Wikipedia article I linked to.

918
00:57:54,740 --> 00:58:01,289
Rym: We're going to talk about how it gets celebrated in contemporary America, because poorly my perception of St.

919
00:58:01,309 --> 00:58:09,540
Rym: Patrick's Day up until like high school was it's the green holiday and the adults have a bad day the day after.

920
00:58:10,402 --> 00:58:16,180
Scott: Mine was it's a green holiday that I have nothing to do with and I don't care about it and I ignore it and whatever.

921
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,479
Scott: And maybe there'll be something on TV.

922
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:18,941
Scott: There's.

923
00:58:19,021 --> 00:58:19,462
Scott: no we have.

924
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:20,204
Scott: no there's.

925
00:58:20,285 --> 00:58:25,440
Rym: there was never any evidence that there's any Irish lineage in either like either side of my family.

926
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,432
Rym: So we didn't celebrate it per se.

927
00:58:28,512 --> 00:58:29,537
Rym: Like, I wouldn't be like Irish.

928
00:58:31,181 --> 00:58:31,302
Scott: Yeah.

929
00:58:31,322 --> 00:58:31,542
Scott: It's like.

930
00:58:31,582 --> 00:58:37,200
Scott: I knew of, you know, there were some people in school who were like, you know, clearly Irish people.

931
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:44,780
Scott: But I don't think I didn't have that many, you know, I wasn't super close to many Irish people, you know, whatever.

932
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:47,940
Rym: I was close to a lot of Irish people when I was a kid for all those reasons.

933
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,179
Scott: I think I had Irish friend in middle school, but that was only in middle school.

934
00:58:52,320 --> 00:59:00,580
Rym: The Simpsons really like crystallized some of my young thoughts around it being the drunken holiday because I didn't experience that part as much.

935
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:07,200
Rym: Mostly the adults would disappear, like parents would go out on a pub crawl or something and a babysitter would be there.

936
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:09,280
Rym: Parents are cranky the next day.

937
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,178
Scott: None of that for us.

938
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,824
Rym: But my perception of St.

939
00:59:12,844 --> 00:59:22,320
Rym: Patrick's Day changed rapidly and suddenly around the year 2006.

940
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:22,341
Scott: 2000s.

941
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:23,381
Rym: 2000s.

942
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,919
Rym: When particularly when Scott and I moved to Beacon, New York.

943
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,320
Scott: And I remember at RIT there was still, you know.

944
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:35,020
Rym: At RIT it was a problem, but there were a lot of other similar days that happened.

945
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:35,362
Rym: Like St.

946
00:59:35,382 --> 00:59:37,000
Rym: Patrick's Day was not the worst of it even.

947
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,503
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

948
00:59:38,724 --> 00:59:42,360
Scott: Even at RIT it didn't, actually I think at RIT I sort of forgot when it was.

949
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,180
Scott: It's like I forgot it existed almost.

950
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:48,240
Rym: It's like, oh, all the frat guys are like passed out in their airsoft hot tubs.

951
00:59:48,802 --> 00:59:49,506
Rym: What day is it?

952
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:50,311
Rym: It's not St.

953
00:59:50,332 --> 00:59:51,600
Rym: Patrick's Day, it's just Tuesday.

954
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:58,520
Rym: But it was when we lived in Beacon, because I remember we moved into Beacon and that first year we were there.

955
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:03,820
Rym: I was woken up by a lot of noise outside.

956
01:00:05,221 --> 01:00:08,380
Scott: There's probably GeekNights episodes where we talked about this as it was happening.

957
01:00:08,842 --> 01:00:11,140
Rym: Oh, there are definitely GeekNights episodes because this was the thing.

958
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:16,440
Scott: Look for a March GeekNights episode from 2005, 6, 7, 8, 9.

959
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,227
Rym: So in the city of Beacon in upstate New York on St.

960
01:00:19,267 --> 01:00:24,500
Rym: Patrick's Day there was a Beacon City tradition where a bunch of people would get together and do a pub crawl.

961
01:00:25,181 --> 01:00:34,180
Rym: And that pub crawl basically was a, it was just a ruinous mob that would march through the city pissing everything.

962
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,870
Scott: We weren't even in the downtown main street area.

963
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:39,300
Scott: People would come all the way up the street.

964
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:45,500
Rym: Yeah, we lived on the edge, edge of town, like way, like right on the edge of the next town over.

965
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:50,900
Rym: But there was a bar, the Barking Frog, that was like actually at the edge of town.

966
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:53,325
Rym: And the pub crawl ended at that bar.

967
01:00:53,846 --> 01:00:55,609
Rym: So every year, St.

968
01:00:55,649 --> 01:01:00,840
Rym: Patrick's Day was a lot of cops and a lot of fistfights and a lot of screaming.

969
01:01:01,841 --> 01:01:07,180
Rym: And then the next day just a sea of garbage, broken mailboxes and piss everywhere.

970
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:09,844
Rym: Like you think I'm exaggerating.

971
01:01:10,064 --> 01:01:11,408
Rym: It was awful.

972
01:01:11,849 --> 01:01:15,237
Rym: It was such a, like every year the whole city would be like, "We should ban it.

973
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:16,300
Rym: We can't ban

974
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:16,400
Rym: it.".

975
01:01:16,701 --> 01:01:17,888
Rym: I think the city did ban it.

976
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:19,175
Rym: It happened anyway.

977
01:01:19,235 --> 01:01:20,040
Rym: Like it was a problem.

978
01:01:20,881 --> 01:01:22,265
Scott: It's very Santa Con-esque.

979
01:01:22,325 --> 01:01:26,900
Scott: In addition to that, right, this was a time when I was taking the commuter train to the city.

980
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,104
Scott: So if St.

981
01:01:28,124 --> 01:01:33,500
Scott: Patrick's Day was during the week, right, there would be a parade like there was today in the city.

982
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:41,300
Scott: And many, many college-aged people usually, but also other people would, you know, they're not going to drive.

983
01:01:42,122 --> 01:01:47,760
Scott: They took the train into and out of the city, you know, specifically to get wasted.

984
01:01:47,920 --> 01:02:01,480
Scott: And they would be unpleasantly on the train mixed in with the commuters, making everyone else's life miserable just with their presence and loudness and, you know, some occasional vomiting and loud noises.

985
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:12,673
Rym: When we were living in Beacon, once I got a job downtown, I would wake up at 4.40 in the fucking morning to get on the 5.24 a.m.

986
01:02:12,713 --> 01:02:19,001
Rym: express train to Manhattan to be at work on time because I had to be at work at 7.

987
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:21,227
Rym: On the 5.24 a.m.

988
01:02:21,287 --> 01:02:22,149
Rym: express on St.

989
01:02:22,169 --> 01:02:26,140
Rym: Patrick's Day, there would be passed out in vomit people.

990
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:27,243
Scott: Yep.

991
01:02:27,904 --> 01:02:33,820
Scott: Now, I don't begrudge anyone, you know, their partying and their celebrating of the thing they care about.

992
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,963
Rym: I mean, go to a bank fest.

993
01:02:35,023 --> 01:02:40,240
Rym: You might find me, at least in non-COVID times, extremely drunk wandering around making a ruckus.

994
01:02:41,201 --> 01:02:41,422
Scott: Right.

995
01:02:41,643 --> 01:02:42,708
Scott: It's like it's the same thing.

996
01:02:42,748 --> 01:02:45,440
Scott: Like, I don't really begrudge people their fart car.

997
01:02:45,821 --> 01:02:50,494
Scott: The problem is, is that, you know, swing your fist until it hits another man's face.

998
01:02:50,554 --> 01:02:52,660
Scott: Your partying has become so rowdy.

999
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,504
Scott: And so, you know, it is.

1000
01:02:54,664 --> 01:03:02,120
Scott: it is crossed over into the realms of, you know, vandalism and, you know, it's like harming other people.

1001
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,342
Scott: I got it.

1002
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:04,264
Scott: Now we got a problem.

1003
01:03:04,324 --> 01:03:04,925
Rym: I found a post.

1004
01:03:04,965 --> 01:03:12,040
Rym: So I posted this on in March of 2010, which was right after we'd moved to New York to the city proper from upstate.

1005
01:03:12,461 --> 01:03:13,865
Rym: I posted this in the GigKnives forum.

1006
01:03:14,546 --> 01:03:16,531
Rym: This is a memo that I wrote.

1007
01:03:16,932 --> 01:03:19,720
Rym: So this is what I thought was notable on that day.

1008
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:25,533
Rym: Quote, I will be spending this day avoiding the drunken yelling idiots who are clogging the streets outside of work.

1009
01:03:25,794 --> 01:03:27,900
Rym: I will then lock myself indoors till the mayhem has ended.

1010
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:34,053
Rym: I literally tripped over a passed out guy walking out of a Starbucks at eleven thirty.

1011
01:03:34,434 --> 01:03:36,940
Rym: He passed out and vomited all over himself just outside the door.

1012
01:03:37,341 --> 01:03:42,877
Rym: Nearby, the police were writing citations for underage drinking and open containers to a crowd of at least 20.

1013
01:03:42,877 --> 01:03:44,060
Rym: There was vomit everywhere.

1014
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:49,960
Rym: Full disclosure, I worked right outside of Grand Central, which is basically ground zero for this shit.

1015
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:51,481
Scott: Yeah.

1016
01:03:51,522 --> 01:03:51,682
Scott: Yeah.

1017
01:03:51,722 --> 01:03:52,323
Scott: I mean, today.

1018
01:03:52,463 --> 01:04:00,620
Scott: So we have on our hockey ticket plan, one of the games that was canceled because the Islanders had too much covid was rescheduled to today.

1019
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:05,060
Scott: So today there is a hockey game between the New York Rangers and New York Island.

1020
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:09,100
Rym: That is already like brewing for a drunken fistfight.

1021
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:09,701
Scott: We sold.

1022
01:04:09,862 --> 01:04:11,850
Scott: we sold the fuck out of those tickets.

1023
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,440
Scott: There's like there was no way I was going there today.

1024
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:18,820
Rym: That's like when two waves intersect and become twice as powerful for a brief moment.

1025
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:24,935
Scott: You've got the existing rowdiness of just a Rangers, Islanders game on top of it.

1026
01:04:25,055 --> 01:04:25,255
Scott: St.

1027
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:25,897
Scott: Patrick's Day.

1028
01:04:25,937 --> 01:04:27,120
Scott: It's like, no, thank you.

1029
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:27,621
Rym: Yep.

1030
01:04:28,806 --> 01:04:31,156
Rym: I'll be watching that game from the safety of my own home.

1031
01:04:31,216 --> 01:04:31,960
Rym: Thank you very much.

1032
01:04:32,521 --> 01:04:33,078
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

1033
01:04:34,701 --> 01:04:39,149
Rym: But it's interesting how this this phenomenon of St.

1034
01:04:39,169 --> 01:04:45,160
Rym: Patrick's Day just being a goddamn disaster is mostly confined to large cities.

1035
01:04:46,321 --> 01:04:47,000
Rym: Also college towns.

1036
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,448
Rym: Yeah, but college towns tend to have this happen on a frequent basis to where St.

1037
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:57,580
Rym: Patrick's Day, in my experience in college towns, doesn't really get worse than whenever there's a big kind of party.

1038
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,219
Scott: I wonder if it's really bad at like, you know, Notre Dame University.

1039
01:05:01,089 --> 01:05:01,418
Scott: I wonder.

1040
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,544
Scott: The fighting Irish.

1041
01:05:02,905 --> 01:05:07,320
Scott: They're probably, you know, I don't know what their tradition is, but I can imagine they're going wild today.

1042
01:05:09,941 --> 01:05:15,435
Rym: But New York is really just a place where I have like pointedly avoided being out during St.

1043
01:05:15,475 --> 01:05:17,180
Rym: Patrick's Day and Santa Con.

1044
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:27,120
Rym: Those are actually the only two things that cause other than covid now that caused me to avoid going into Manhattan because I'm afraid of running into trouble.

1045
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:32,380
Scott: Yeah, it's like there are many, many holidays on the calendar celebrated by different people for different reasons.

1046
01:05:32,581 --> 01:05:36,400
Scott: And I celebrate some of those holidays and I don't celebrate most of them.

1047
01:05:36,841 --> 01:05:37,283
Scott: But St.

1048
01:05:37,343 --> 01:05:41,660
Scott: Patrick's Day is the only holiday that I anti celebrate the only one.

1049
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:47,540
Scott: I can't think of a single other holiday where I'm like, you know, I don't know, unless white supremacists have holidays I don't know about.

1050
01:05:47,761 --> 01:05:49,080
Rym: Those aren't holidays.

1051
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:50,823
Scott: Yeah, but, you know, St.

1052
01:05:50,843 --> 01:05:55,460
Scott: Patrick's Day is the only day where I'm like, get this shit the fuck out of here.

1053
01:05:58,003 --> 01:06:02,758
Rym: Like, have your drunken parties, but don't be vomiting actively on a 5 a.m.

1054
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:10,736
Rym: train into Manhattan because you pregame too hard at 3 a.m Yeah, I don't know.

1055
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:11,901
Scott: So I don't know.

1056
01:06:11,921 --> 01:06:19,060
Scott: if anyone else out there, you know, I don't have, you know, too much else to talk about a holiday that I don't just simply not celebrate, but I anti celebrate.

1057
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:24,320
Rym: Also, we've gone kind of long because we skipped a bunch of episodes and I think we had a lot of pent up talking into the microphone.

1058
01:06:24,562 --> 01:06:27,260
Scott: Intentionally, that was intentional because it's Thursday.

1059
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,143
Scott: But yeah, but if you have any St.

1060
01:06:29,183 --> 01:06:37,280
Scott: Patrick's Day anecdotes or experiences or memories of your own, why don't you come over to our communities and share them with the class?

1061
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:42,480
Scott: Yeah, and I will link to maybe you're one of the drunken vomitors and you want to defend yourself.

1062
01:06:43,121 --> 01:06:48,320
Rym: I would love to hear your accounts of why you do what you do on that day.

1063
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,419
Scott: Maybe you're a bartender who serves them.

1064
01:06:50,821 --> 01:06:56,320
Scott: Maybe you are just like us and you want to commiserate about hating drunken vomitors.

1065
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,534
Rym: But I will link to...

1066
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,184
Scott: Maybe you celebrate St.

1067
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:03,940
Scott: Patrick's Day in a non-vomitous good way with some Irish soda bread and whatnot.

1068
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,279
Scott: And you want to talk about that.

1069
01:07:06,004 --> 01:07:06,636
Scott: That's cool, too.

1070
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,420
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1081
01:08:10,222 --> 01:08:15,660
Rym: And several people who have contributed money to GeekNights that have chosen not to have me say their names out loud on the show.

1082
01:08:16,501 --> 01:08:17,819
Rym: So yeah, stay safe out there.

1083
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:29,000
Rym: If any of you are in London and would like to get together next week, I will very likely be more than happy to meet you outdoors for a pint.

1084
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,328
Rym: I'm not really going to go into a bar or anything.

1085
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:34,020
Rym: Like, it is way too soon for that COVID-wise.

1086
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:38,560
Rym: But the weather's going to be pretty nice, so I would gladly grab a pint with you.

1087
01:08:39,082 --> 01:08:44,460
Rym: I know a couple places that are open late that are right on the Timbs that are very much outdoor and pleasant, so let me know.

1088
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:50,240
Rym: I know there's a lot of listeners out there in London, and I haven't been to London since before COVID, so maybe I'll see some of you.

1089
01:08:50,859 --> 01:08:56,600
Rym: But anyway, for tonight, I leave you with a very important song.

1090
01:08:58,441 --> 01:09:00,200
Scott: Everything's gonna be okay.

1091
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,419
Rym: Bad stuff happens in the bathroom.

1092
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:08,080
Rym: I'm just glad that it happens in a vacuum.

1093
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,179
Rym: Can't let them see me with my pants down.

1094
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:18,920
Scott: Coasters Magazine is gonna be my big chance now, but I'll be out of here in no time.

1095
01:09:19,942 --> 01:09:23,080
Rym: I'll be doing interviews and feeling just fine.

1096
01:09:23,482 --> 01:09:26,459
Rym: Today is gonna be a great day.

1097
01:09:27,102 --> 01:09:30,719
Scott: I'll do Coasters Magazine and blow everyone away.

1098
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,663
Rym: Let's be clear.

1099
01:09:33,684 --> 01:09:36,810
Rym: I did absolutely nothing wrong.

1100
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:37,813
Rym: I'm not to blame.

1101
01:09:37,853 --> 01:09:38,715
Rym: It's not my fault.

1102
01:09:38,995 --> 01:09:41,140
Rym: This is just to say.

1103
01:09:41,939 --> 01:09:46,240
Rym: If Jean had pooped like every day, this would have all just blown away.

1104
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:49,429
Rym: But he'll be honest.

1105
01:09:50,331 --> 01:09:51,795
Rym: No one's gonna blame me.

1106
01:09:51,916 --> 01:09:53,118
Rym: I'll be doing just fine.

1107
01:09:53,962 --> 01:09:56,899
Rym: Today is gonna be a great day.

1108
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,959
Rym: If Teddy can't unstick my bat, I'll find another way.

1109
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,644
Rym: Hey, where's Bob?

1110
01:10:02,926 --> 01:10:05,200
Rym: I wanna tell him I can smell him from across the street.

1111
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,049
Rym: Yeah, Linda, where is Bob?

1112
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,660
Rym: I gotta do his hair for the big interview.

1113
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:09,385
Scott: Interview?

1114
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:10,320
Scott: What interview?

1115
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,260
Scott: Bob's got a big magazine interview.

1116
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,280
Scott: What, are they writing an article on guys with mustaches you wanna punch?

1117
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:15,903
Scott: Zoom!

1118
01:10:17,605 --> 01:10:18,394
