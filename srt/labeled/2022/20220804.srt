1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,589
Rym: It's Thursday, August 4th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:10,931
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:13,955
Scott: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:15,587
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:18,019
Rym: Tonight we are talking about vending machines.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,538
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,640
Rym: It's uh, it's warm today and I don't say that lightly.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,780
Rym: It was uh, one of those days where you know the office is always crazy cold.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,720
Rym: Like so cold that I'll shiver if I don't wear like a blazer.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,239
Scott: Especially considering there's not a lot of people there I met.

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,451
Rym: Oh yeah, there's like no one there.

12
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:36,320
Rym: Especially on a Thursday.

13
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:39,740
Rym: Plus all my teams are overseas anyway.

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,580
Rym: Like I actually work with very few people in the US so going to the office is always extra funny.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,120
Rym: Because everyone I'm meeting with is on a Zoom call like in Frankfurt or something.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,077
Rym: But uh, and the office is freezing and outside is like 90 degrees.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,779
Rym: But uh, it was a pleasant bike to and from work.

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,859
Rym: And uh, let's see what's going on.

19
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:00,100
Rym: We skipped a show Wednesday, Tuesday.

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:08,280
Rym: And as you the listener know, if anything that we thought we were going to talk about, any given GeekNights, once that episode's day passes it is forgotten.

21
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,279
Rym: So nothing else has happened in my life.

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,320
Scott: The uh, I mean, you know I tried to do, I tried to change my work up a bit this week, right.

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,920
Scott: And I took, you know, because I got the new work laptop.

24
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:21,391
Scott: Oh yeah.

25
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:26,399
Scott: And I'm like alright, I really don't like working with just one screen, right.

26
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,760
Scott: But let me go try to work just out on the balcony.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,720
Scott: Because at least, you know, it's trade off.

28
00:01:31,242 --> 00:01:36,398
Rym: I've done that and the only time it's been pleasant and successful is when I'm doing training and not when I'm doing work.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,980
Rym: Because there is no way to both avoid sun glare and avoid the sun being in my face directly.

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,800
Scott: Oh, neither of those was a problem.

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,499
Rym: The sun comes straight into our balcony, like head on.

32
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:57,379
Scott: Oh okay, I mean, anyway, I guess not at this time of year the sun is high enough that it goes straight down, kinda.

33
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:03,759
Scott: It doesn't get sunny in your face until like, you don't get, you will be in the shade until like noon or one.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:12,040
Rym: Yeah, the other problem is now because the heatwave out on the balcony, there are like 4,000 air conditioners all going simultaneously.

35
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,800
Scott: Right, so I had to basically, you know, the air conditioner blows into the balcony.

36
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:24,020
Scott: So I had to, when I went out there, I had to turn off the air conditioner to not be Otherwise, not only is it blowing directly on me otherwise.

37
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,320
Scott: Exactly.

38
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:30,400
Scott: And, you know, having the one screen actually wasn't too bad.

39
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,439
Scott: I managed pretty well.

40
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:44,399
Scott: So that, you know, I think it helps that the last time, like every laptop I've ever owned personally did not have a high resolution screen.

41
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,680
Scott: Whereas this MacBook Air has like a retina screen on it, right?

42
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,240
Scott: And I was like, oh, I can actually get a lot of things on the one screen without issue.

43
00:02:54,941 --> 00:03:00,360
Scott: Uh, and then I just finished working just now and, uh, that's it work again on Monday.

44
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,860
Rym: Four days.

45
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:04,479
Rym: I gotta figure out a way to get that.

46
00:03:05,182 --> 00:03:06,139
Rym: I gotta get on that somehow.

47
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,820
Scott: Come work with this.

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,720
Scott: I don't know if this company needs you for anything.

49
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,640
Rym: I mean, if they ever need a senior like director product manager.

50
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:15,740
Scott: I don't know.

51
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:16,498
Scott: We make a database.

52
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,557
Scott: I don't know how much.

53
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:20,400
Rym: What's the comic?

54
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,199
Rym: I only know how to tell people to design complex alloys.

55
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:24,039
Scott: Hmm.

56
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:28,840
Rym: Though in, uh, in minor, uh, openy bitty news.

57
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,880
Rym: So, you know, it's rollerblading season.

58
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,340
Rym: Uh, and also I've noticed skating like four wheel skating is on a huge upswing in New York city lately.

59
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:37,160
Scott: Like, oh yeah.

60
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,180
Scott: I mean, it's been on a huge, it's been an upswing for a few years, but it's like Excel this summer.

61
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:44,660
Rym: I feel like that upswing accelerated.

62
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,200
Rym: I see people everywhere.

63
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:53,658
Rym: I see a lot of people learning how to skate or blade for the first time clearly because I see how they're skating when I'm out.

64
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,380
Scott: So, uh, well, I think what's, I think what's happened is that, you know, it's been on the upswing for like quite a few years, right?

65
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,147
Scott: It started, you know, from the roller Derby then towards, you know, the, the old school retro disco day.

66
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:08,352
Rym: since around 2017, it's been on a big upswing.

67
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:15,138
Scott: But I think what's happened is maybe just the past year or two, right.

68
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,140
Scott: We've seen the capitalist response to the existing upswing.

69
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:22,060
Scott: It's like it was popular among the people.

70
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,580
Scott: Cause like, you know, it got popular just from like a, a sort of a grassroots popularity.

71
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:27,383
Scott: Like people.

72
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:37,340
Scott: just, you know, roll this, I seen a lot of people, like they would do like a, you know, they would dance in place on a vertical video on Tik TOK or YouTube or whatever.

73
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:37,957
Scott: Right.

74
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,560
Scott: And you know, it looks like fun.

75
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,538
Scott: People want to do it.

76
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,790
Scott: And I think enough people started doing it.

77
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:52,435
Scott: that there is now, you know, you see like in a fricking central park, they set up the huge roller rink where they usually an ice rink.

78
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,515
Scott: They've never done that before this year.

79
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:55,100
Scott: that I've seen.

80
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:05,580
Rym: Another consequence of this is there are a lot of knockoff bootleg adjacent brands now selling like shit ass rollerblades and roller skates.

81
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,150
Scott: The quality roller blades are.

82
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,060
Scott: roller skates are not cheap.

83
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:22,220
Scott: I mean, I have a pair of high quality styling ones are so, but now if you know that it's popular enough, it's like suddenly people are making cheap ones again, but the cheap ones are interesting.

84
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:29,219
Rym: I talked about when I got new rollerblades many years ago on GeekNights and how much the technology has advanced, but the cheap brands coming in.

85
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:31,760
Rym: So I wore out my last brake pad on my rollerblades.

86
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:43,840
Rym: So I went to buy a new one and I could buy the moderately expensive rollerblade branded standard universal brake pad, or there was an Amazon one that looked identical.

87
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:46,260
Rym: That seems like what all the cheapy people are buying.

88
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,380
Rym: That was like a dollar.

89
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,580
Rym: So I bought the dollar one.

90
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:50,177
Rym: See how it would go.

91
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,380
Rym: It disintegrated in the course of trying to use it once.

92
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,820
Scott: Yeah, it's probably just made of some random.

93
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:57,820
Rym: It was just random, right?

94
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,679
Rym: It's just way ground down to the screw.

95
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:03,840
Rym: One time when I tried to stop at speed, like it was amazing.

96
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:05,519
Rym: Just left this long black streak.

97
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:06,839
Rym: I basically bought a marker.

98
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,920
Scott: I mean, couldn't you tell that it was the wrong material when you took it?

99
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:10,240
Rym: Oh yeah.

100
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,240
Rym: But the thing is I don't use brakes that often.

101
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:16,820
Rym: You don't really need your brakes except when you're going across traffic.

102
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,080
Rym: Once you're out in the place you're going to be blading, you really don't need the brakes.

103
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:21,780
Rym: The brakes are just there as a safety mechanism.

104
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,739
Rym: So I don't hit them that often.

105
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,740
Rym: But going at speed and having to stop because there's a red light coming up, I had to break.

106
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:31,680
Rym: And I drew a 10 foot long black line on the sidewalk.

107
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:35,560
Rym: And then I scraped off the top of a screw trying to stop myself.

108
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:43,360
Scott: I wonder if the roller blade brand is really the S tier of inline skate.

109
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:44,039
Rym: Absolutely.

110
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:52,460
Rym: Right now I feel like the sweet spot is 90 millimeter wheels with the magnesium frames and the minimalist boots.

111
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,160
Scott: Yeah, I wonder what the most... There must be actual professional inline skate people, right?

112
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:10,470
Rym: So I'm already at the point where I have like... Instead of just buying blades you buy the frame and the boot and the tires and the bearings and all the pieces separately.

113
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,170
Rym: Like you choose what you want.

114
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,929
Rym: So I have this pretty complex rig.

115
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,150
Rym: The real scary ones are the speed skates.

116
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,570
Rym: Because 90 millimeters is already like double what I used to use when I was a kid.

117
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,430
Rym: And double was like standard back in the day.

118
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:26,138
Rym: I've seen 120s.

119
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:27,830
Rym: Those things are terrifying.

120
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,310
Rym: You can get those up to like 35, 40 miles an hour on a straightaway.

121
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:31,607
Scott: Hmm.

122
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:34,730
Scott: There do seem to be a couple other brands though.

123
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:35,930
Scott: Is K2 brand.

124
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,181
Rym: K2 is like the second best.

125
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:38,890
Rym: They're pretty good.

126
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,350
Rym: I used to do... I only switched to roller blade after I moved to the city.

127
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,008
Rym: I was K2 my entire life before that.

128
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:55,670
Rym: And then there's a whole bunch of basically identical looking fake brands that all have different names but all are clearly the exact same skates that are for sale on Amazon.

129
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,070
Scott: Wow, this is freaky looking one.

130
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,962
Scott: It looks like a ski moon boot with tiny wheels.

131
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,409
Scott: Like four tiny wheels.

132
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,270
Scott: And it's called them 909.

133
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,170
Rym: That sounds like it's for parks and tricks.

134
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,226
Rym: Generally use smaller wheels for hockey.

135
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,670
Scott: For aggressive skating with grinds and jumps.

136
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:17,350
Rym: Yep, that's a park skates.

137
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,369
Rym: Park skates use basically the same wheels that skateboards do.

138
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,949
Rym: And speed skates and leisure skates use those.

139
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,290
Scott: Those don't look like skateboard wheels but they are tiny.

140
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,370
Rym: Yeah but they're the same material as skateboard wheels.

141
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,010
Rym: They're a lot harder.

142
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,828
Rym: They don't grip as much.

143
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:29,889
Rym: They're more rounded.

144
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:32,830
Rym: They'll survive like grinding.

145
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:38,110
Rym: If I jumped on a bar in my blades, they would instantly stop and flip me over sideways.

146
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:41,169
Rym: They would grip the bar like a brake and just flip me over.

147
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:45,229
Rym: Yeah, there's a ton of news.

148
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:46,470
Rym: It's Thursday.

149
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,330
Rym: We can talk about anything.

150
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:49,009
Rym: And the first one probably the biggest one.

151
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:50,329
Rym: And there's more.

152
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:53,550
Rym: There is a wave of consolidation.

153
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:56,210
Scott: There's a giant Wednesday news.

154
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,570
Scott: But let's save it for Wednesday.

155
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,470
Rym: We'll save it for Wednesday.

156
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,869
Scott: We don't usually have enough Wednesday news.

157
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:00,868
Scott: It's too big.

158
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:04,330
Rym: But basically this whole wave of news is all the same story.

159
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:10,647
Rym: Big companies in a variety of sectors are all merging all their crap and consolidating yet again.

160
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:19,350
Rym: Which in my personal opinion, but not the opinion of anyone I may work for, does not bode well for the economy for the next five to ten years.

161
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,430
Scott: We already knew the economy was fucked the fuck up.

162
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:23,529
Scott: Everybody knows that.

163
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:23,970
Rym: Yeah.

164
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:28,010
Rym: So HBO Max is basically gone.

165
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,644
Rym: HBO Max is being merged into Discovery Plus.

166
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:33,693
Scott: That's really.

167
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:40,850
Scott: it's really interesting, because if you think about content wise, right, you got to, you know, think HBO Max is like one of the better content.

168
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,210
Rym: Not that is objective.

169
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:53,090
Rym: So industry surveys and studies have shown that HBO Max had the highest customer satisfaction far and away of any streaming service available in America.

170
00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:02,010
Rym: Like they were the premium top tier offering, highest customer satisfaction, highest customer retention, highest everything.

171
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,409
Rym: Like they were the best one.

172
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:04,189
Scott: Yeah.

173
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:12,529
Scott: You got to imagine, like, you know, if you think of if you just think brand wise, content wise, the ones that should go would be like Hulu.

174
00:10:12,752 --> 00:10:14,230
Scott: She just is owned by Disney, right?

175
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,829
Scott: Just merge that shit into D plus.

176
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,030
Scott: Why do you got it separated?

177
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:21,290
Rym: Or the plebeian might think, oh, well, get rid of Discovery.

178
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,270
Rym: That's just like reality.

179
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:22,758
Rym: So who?

180
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:25,550
Scott: Well, Discovery, who even pays for that?

181
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,788
Rym: Ah, so here's the rub.

182
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:32,030
Rym: Discovery has so many more viewers than than HBO Max.

183
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,369
Rym: That keeping HBO Max around is a terrible idea.

184
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:36,030
Rym: Discovery.

185
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,789
Scott: No one like who is he?

186
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,815
Scott: Who is watching the?

187
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:41,890
Rym: who subscribes to the streaming service?

188
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:42,868
Rym: Basic people.

189
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:44,256
Scott: But how?

190
00:10:44,337 --> 00:10:46,010
Scott: it's like no one talks about it.

191
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:47,270
Scott: Nobody.

192
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,349
Scott: Where are these people that are paying for this mass market?

193
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,370
Rym: And this is something that is always hard to express to people.

194
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,650
Scott: People who don't Internet and don't talk on Internet.

195
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:55,715
Scott: Yes.

196
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:56,448
Scott: Ever.

197
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,801
Rym: People who aren't online and don't give a shit what they.

198
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:05,970
Rym: the most popular shows in America are things like naked and afraid or the British Bake Off.

199
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:06,930
Rym: They're all reality.

200
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,270
Scott: British Bake Off is on Netflix.

201
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:08,770
Rym: Yeah.

202
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:15,510
Rym: But shows like that unscripted content are the far majority popular content in America.

203
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:17,350
Scott: But I mean, that's been true.

204
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:19,110
Scott: That's not just the American thing.

205
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,089
Scott: That's a worldwide thing.

206
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,069
Scott: And that's been the case for like a very long time.

207
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,403
Scott: But the problem is late 90s.

208
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,668
Rym: People who care about movies and content, who care about quality, who are interested in these things.

209
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:34,330
Rym: We all have this perception that HBO Max, which was kind of warranted, was the premium offering.

210
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,569
Rym: It had high quality, high budget, like big productions on it.

211
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,089
Scott: So things had shows people were talking about the most.

212
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:53,490
Rym: But that's not how you make money, because, one, those shows cost a lot of money to make and not that many people care enough to pay to see them.

213
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:59,990
Rym: Meanwhile, direct unscripted shovelware like naked and afraid cost almost nothing to make.

214
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,970
Rym: You can crank out just hours and hours and hours and hours of content.

215
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:06,250
Rym: Doesn't have to be of any particular level of quality.

216
00:12:07,071 --> 00:12:10,770
Rym: And people are happy to pay a pittance or watch an ad to see that kind of stuff.

217
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:13,110
Scott: Now, see, it'd be one thing, right?

218
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,770
Scott: It's like if you if you're going to make shovel content, that's just nothing.

219
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:17,509
Scott: Right.

220
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:23,608
Scott: At least have the decency to be like, you know, the K-pop industry and just give that shit away for free.

221
00:12:23,838 --> 00:12:24,028
Scott: Yeah.

222
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,910
Rym: With ads, because that's how they make their fucking money.

223
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,386
Scott: Well, they don't do it.

224
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,626
Scott: I mean, I guess this ad that I don't see.

225
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:33,250
Rym: So HBO Max was also the smallest of the major streaming services.

226
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,850
Rym: They had like 70 million subscribers.

227
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:35,939
Rym: Disney's like 130 million.

228
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,580
Rym: Netflix is like 220 million.

229
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:45,730
Rym: Even on Disney, a lot of their success and growth was around in other countries.

230
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,750
Rym: They offered a shitty tier of Disney Plus that was cheaper and full of ads.

231
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,649
Rym: And people are way more interested in that than the ad free tier.

232
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,390
Scott: Suppose they say that the Discovery one has 92 million subscribers.

233
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:00,001
Rym: Yep.

234
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:06,730
Rym: So 92 million subscribers to Discovery Plus, but nobody talks about it on the Internet because the people...

235
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:08,970
Scott: It said that HBO Max only had 48.

236
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,749
Scott: It's like, wow, okay.

237
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:10,670
Rym: Well, 48.

238
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,130
Scott: So half as many.

239
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:20,450
Rym: The number I have from some industry sources was 70 million, but the difference might be between peak and current versus actual current.

240
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,604
Scott: Hulu might be 40 something.

241
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:22,868
Rym: Yep.

242
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:37,250
Rym: But, uh, basically the big, like the funny thing is that best I can tell, HBO Max effectively cost HBO money because we actually look at where HBO generates its revenue.

243
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,630
Rym: Even now, almost all of it comes from regular old cable HBO Max.

244
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,508
Scott: People pay for the cable who aren't watching HBO.

245
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:55,170
Scott: This is something we've known about television for a long time, which is that if people had to only paid for the things they actually watched.

246
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:55,910
Scott: Right.

247
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:03,329
Scott: There's a lot of just cable channels that are like ESPN was getting like multiple dollars per cable subscriber.

248
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,110
Rym: They just disappeared.

249
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,490
Scott: Even though a fraction of those people ever went to ESPN ever.

250
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:08,890
Scott: Right.

251
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,230
Scott: They just were forced to pay.

252
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:10,525
Scott: All right.

253
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:11,930
Scott: Because it's all bundled together.

254
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:18,710
Scott: Like when you go to GameStop and you want to buy a new console, like a new PlayStation, and they bundle it with some accessories and it's like too bad.

255
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,930
Scott: You got to buy the accessories.

256
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:20,330
Scott: Right.

257
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,109
Scott: And now the accessory company makes money.

258
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:24,770
Scott: ESPN is the accessory company force.

259
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,229
Scott: People are forced to pay for their crap that they just didn't use.

260
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:29,530
Rym: Or even worse.

261
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:44,450
Rym: And this is something that I'll talk about in the thing of the day, but a lot of people, I'd say almost everyone who would listen to GeekNights is too young to remember when cable TV first appeared in the US outside of very limited rural market.

262
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,989
Scott: The whole point was no ads.

263
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:46,243
Rym: Yep.

264
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,368
Rym: Cable TV was, Hey, pay for TV.

265
00:14:48,994 --> 00:14:49,488
Rym: No ads.

266
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:53,910
Scott: It was well, even before that you could pay for HBO by itself, which we did.

267
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,105
Rym: We had a satellite dish that just had HBO.

268
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,076
Scott: Yeah.

269
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,350
Scott: People had TVs that had a switch.

270
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:03,870
Scott: It's actually said HBO physically on the TV with a mechanical switch.

271
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,510
Scott: Not, you know, no remote controls yet.

272
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,630
Scott: It's like you turn a knob and it would say HBO physically on this dial.

273
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:28,949
Rym: So basically this consolidation, there's a lot going on here, but basically HBO max effectively costs HBO money because at best, even if it got subscribers, those are people who would either cancel the cable subscription who had never had it or who had never had a cable subscription.

274
00:15:29,472 --> 00:15:32,584
Rym: They cannibalized their own much more profitable, at least in the short term.

275
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:45,670
Rym: business of just having stuff on regular cable TV, but also creating original content costs so much money and yet didn't actually attract enough users to matter in capitalism.

276
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,834
Rym: In fact, I was

277
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:54,869
Scott: one of those things that they, they invested too, you know, they could have made, you know, they're the, the, the budgets for the content were very high,

278
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:59,510
Rym: but if the budgets were low, then the content would have sucked and they wouldn't have even gotten the initial people.

279
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,950
Rym: Like I signed up to watch one show.

280
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,130
Rym: Our flag means death.

281
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:10,005
Rym: And when that show ended, I canceled my subscription and it looks like a lot of people did exactly that.

282
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:16,010
Scott: Well, I think the reason is that there's too many, you know, we all talk about this too many streaming services, right?

283
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,530
Scott: When there were just a few, right?

284
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:24,609
Scott: When it was like just Netflix by itself, you could subscribe to Netflix and you wouldn't really unsubscribe to it.

285
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:25,050
Scott: Right.

286
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:31,370
Scott: But it's like now when there's so many, it's like, well, I don't want to pay for so many at once, but I want to write, they're not bundled.

287
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:39,929
Scott: So it's actually now kind of worth it to subscribe and unsubscribe and switch around, you know, and watch different things that way.

288
00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:44,809
Scott: When there weren't so many services, people might've just stuck with the one and kept paying it.

289
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:49,450
Scott: Even if they didn't watch anything that month, you wouldn't like turn Netflix off for a month and turn it back on the next month.

290
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:50,349
Scott: That's a pain in the ass.

291
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:50,619
Rym: Yup.

292
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:58,370
Rym: So I suspect the end game of all this is a lot of streaming platforms are going to disappear and get acquired and merged into other streaming platforms.

293
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:00,670
Rym: They're going to be very few streaming platforms remaining.

294
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,730
Rym: I think a lot of existing content will disappear.

295
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,550
Scott: Fewer remaining is, you know, good and bad, right?

296
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:15,229
Rym: So I think a lot of existing content is going to disappear from all streaming services and be unavailable except via piracy or cable TV.

297
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:25,690
Rym: I also think we're going to see an absolute collapse of the scripted original content sector in America across the board.

298
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,608
Rym: I think fewer shows are going to be made.

299
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,190
Rym: Shows are going to have lower budgets and content is increasingly going to be focused.

300
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:38,515
Rym: It's going to be like what happened in the nineties when reality TV displaced like all of regular TV.

301
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,290
Rym: that's going to happen on the internet now at scale.

302
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:49,109
Scott: What I'd like to see is just, you know, the people who actually produce video content, right?

303
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:53,150
Scott: It's like some of them are on, you know, just YouTube, which is sort of direct, right?

304
00:17:53,311 --> 00:18:04,510
Scott: Still YouTube middleman, but it's like, you know, historically we've had all these, you know, middlemen because of the technological nature and the production nature of Hollywood, right?

305
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:12,750
Scott: It's like, oh, you need distributors and you need producers and you need to get your shit into theaters and you need to get your shit into stores on discs, right?

306
00:18:12,971 --> 00:18:14,389
Scott: It's like, you don't need that shit now.

307
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:17,430
Scott: You look a lot of authors, right?

308
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:22,823
Scott: Have been foregoing publishers, writing books and getting them up in the Kindle store or whatever, right?

309
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:30,790
Rym: You know, that is sustainable though, because discoverability is down across the board, coupled with the fact that with a bad economy, people can't afford to buy stuff.

310
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,890
Scott: So they're not gonna, it's a little bit more direct, right?

311
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:42,630
Scott: The point is what if I had enough money to make a movie and I wanted to make it right, but I wanted to at least come close to breaking even, right?

312
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:47,969
Scott: It's like, if you just want to make money and that's it, why would you in a movie is not the thing to invest in?

313
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:53,549
Scott: Well, that is the much more fundamental from the perspective of just a rich person who wants to get richer.

314
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,290
Scott: Art is not the way to get richer, right?

315
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,230
Scott: Whether it's big art or small art, right?

316
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:04,170
Scott: But you know, you want to make a movie and you want to at least break even, make some money, right?

317
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,930
Scott: You know, because you care about art and you're in that spot.

318
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:11,208
Scott: Why are you getting in with any Hollywood, right?

319
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,428
Scott: It's like, just go do everything directly, right?

320
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:24,886
Rym: It's like, I would argue that doing everything directly in that level of production probably doubles to triples your costs because you lose the economy of scale of the industry itself.

321
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,968
Scott: No, you still like, you know, you hire union people, right?

322
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:37,885
Rym: You know, you just- I think you underestimate how much that pipeline provides or what steps actually like a show like that goes through.

323
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:43,669
Scott: It's like, you need writers, you need camera people, you need sound people, right?

324
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,487
Scott: It's like, you know, you can hire all those people.

325
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:47,667
Scott: Stop.

326
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,049
Scott: Spin up a company to produce one movie and that's all, that's it.

327
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:52,590
Scott: The end.

328
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,630
Scott: That company makes the one movie, it doesn't make any other movie.

329
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,110
Scott: That's it, right?

330
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,850
Scott: When the movie's done, everyone go buy another company.

331
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,190
Rym: Movies are also a separate phenomenon that are not as impacted by this.

332
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,730
Rym: What's being impacted is serials, shows and non-theatrical original content.

333
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:21,710
Scott: I don't, I think that, you know, video, whether it's, you know, a one video that happens to be two hours plus or, you know, a video that's broken up into several things.

334
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:28,876
Rym: For whatever reason, and it doesn't matter why, mass market consumers make a very, very clear distinction between the two.

335
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:37,289
Rym: and mass market consumers are willing to actually pay a lot to see a movie and are willing to pay basically nothing to see something that they don't consider to be a movie.

336
00:20:38,352 --> 00:20:39,257
Rym: It doesn't matter why.

337
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:41,109
Rym: that's true, that is how they act.

338
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,590
Scott: Right, so it's just a completely arbitrary distinction though.

339
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,490
Scott: The production of them is the same.

340
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:53,140
Scott: So if you, you know, stop, don't produce, if you're making video, you have camera, people, writers, every video content.

341
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:10,117
Rym: I'm just saying that the, the fundamental problem is just that the industry, none of this is sustainable and unscripted content is going to take over everything.

342
00:21:10,198 --> 00:21:21,298
Rym: because like you said, the fundamental root cause of all of this is that all things are made because someone who has money wants to have more money and money will go wherever the cheapest dollars are.

343
00:21:21,861 --> 00:21:23,880
Rym: So never buy expensive dollars.

344
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,656
Rym: Don't spend 90 cents to make a dollar if you could spend 50 cents on something shittier to make a dollar.

345
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:45,460
Rym: In equally dire news, the worst and second worst airlines in America are merging to become the fifth largest and worst airline, worst airline in the US.

346
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:47,680
Scott: Well, worst, worst airline of note.

347
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:55,000
Scott: There's a lot of, it's surprising that there's so many like really, really tiny airlines that no one's ever heard of that like go make two stops.

348
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,700
Rym: Most people consider those shuttles or charters.

349
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,579
Rym: They call them something else.

350
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:04,975
Scott: Like when you're around though, but yeah, major airlines that you've heard of that you might actually buy a ticket from, right?

351
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,480
Scott: There's JetBlue and the other, it was Spirit.

352
00:22:09,702 --> 00:22:16,160
Rym: So Spirit is one of the few airlines on earth, Rain Air is up there too, that I refuse to fly on under any circumstances.

353
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,920
Scott: Why do you always say Rain Air?

354
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,600
Scott: It's Ryan.

355
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,300
Scott: Like the guy's name is Ryan, right?

356
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,660
Rym: You ever talk to someone from the UK or Germany?

357
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,839
Scott: Ryan, like you don't have to.

358
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,920
Rym: My coworkers fly with them all the time.

359
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,679
Scott: Their name is Ryan.

360
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:35,180
Rym: So everyone I know at work who flies them all the time because it's the only way to get around a lot of places they live, that's how they pronounce it.

361
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:41,498
Scott: I wonder if the person, the Ryan, also I'm pretty sure the Ryan guy is like a piece of shit rich guy.

362
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,799
Rym: I mean, how do you pronounce Linux?

363
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:47,199
Scott: The guy's name is Linus Dorvalds.

364
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,100
Rym: Yeah, do you pronounce it Linux?

365
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,749
Scott: You're supposed to pronounce it the way his name is.

366
00:22:53,092 --> 00:22:53,248
Scott: Are you?

367
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:59,530
Rym: Anyway, so Spirit was always on my never fly under any circumstances list.

368
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,330
Rym: The one time I flew with Spirit was such a just disastrous, ugly shit show.

369
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,108
Rym: I would never get on a Spirit plane no matter what.

370
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:13,910
Scott: JetBlue has an interesting history because JetBlue was run by like these Mormon type people, right?

371
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:26,789
Rym: When JetBlue was founded, they actually tried something that was a good idea for society, but a terrible business idea of making a budget airline that was nice enough, like this bare minimum of quality, didn't have classes.

372
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,370
Rym: There's no first class or business class, just all the seats are the same.

373
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,829
Rym: In-flight entertainment, which used to not be free back then.

374
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:34,049
Scott: Yeah, I mean, yeah.

375
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:44,510
Scott: Back in the day, like, you know, other airlines did not have, right, like TV, any kind of screen for the passengers and people did not yet have phones and tablets.

376
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,830
Scott: So it was early 2000s, no phones, no tablets yet.

377
00:23:48,362 --> 00:23:48,570
Scott: Right.

378
00:23:48,811 --> 00:23:51,250
Scott: So a screen on the plane was like amazing.

379
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:51,667
Rym: Yep.

380
00:23:52,151 --> 00:24:04,810
Scott: And a lot of other airlines, if they had, yeah, most airlines, if they had a movie, it was more like a coach bus with like a few overhead screens here and there, all showing the same movie, not like individual personal screens.

381
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,529
Scott: JetBlue in the early 2000s, every seat had a screen.

382
00:24:09,112 --> 00:24:12,182
Scott: All the seats were the same and it was satellite TV.

383
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:16,689
Scott: that was live and you could change the channels and you didn't have to pay extra for it.

384
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:21,428
Scott: It wasn't like pay for the in-flight movie and check the first class to get the check in a bag was free.

385
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,558
Rym: The terminals were like.

386
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,710
Rym: everything about JetBlue was great.

387
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,206
Rym: Like for a normal person who's not rich, JetBlue was.

388
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:28,130
Scott: JetBlue started.

389
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:31,190
Scott: It was like this, like the best possible airline.

390
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,510
Scott: Everything about it was great.

391
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,070
Scott: The only thing was it was early days for JetBlue.

392
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:36,690
Scott: They didn't go to that many places.

393
00:24:37,931 --> 00:24:43,170
Scott: But the places they did go, it was just, you know, partly because their primary hub was New York City.

394
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,709
Rym: So if you lived in New York, you basically had like the cheapest, best flights everywhere in America.

395
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:52,029
Scott: I used to go back and forth to college like so many times.

396
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:53,950
Rym: Do you have any free flights?

397
00:24:55,235 --> 00:24:58,270
Scott: I got 45 in 45 minutes instead of five hours of driving.

398
00:24:58,471 --> 00:25:02,450
Rym: I think we flew JetBlue to almost every packs all around America for a long time.

399
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:03,510
Scott: Yeah, for a long time.

400
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:08,830
Scott: But then over time, right, JetBlue, they were making some money, I believe.

401
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:09,028
Scott: Oh, yeah.

402
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,950
Rym: As far as I can tell, they were profitable.

403
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:12,590
Rym: They were doing fine, but right.

404
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:13,473
Rym: They weren't making.

405
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:16,067
Scott: capitalism demands growth and they weren't making.

406
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:17,770
Scott: they couldn't make more money.

407
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,670
Scott: They added adding more flights didn't really make them enough more money.

408
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:24,950
Scott: So, you know, it wasn't good for stock prices and whatnot.

409
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:27,950
Scott: So they had to do things to make even more money.

410
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:32,330
Scott: And eventually everything that was nice about JetBlue went away.

411
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:35,669
Rym: I remember it was like four years ago, five years ago.

412
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,329
Rym: I think it was five years ago.

413
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:37,708
Rym: Covid.

414
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,570
Rym: I've always messed up how many years ago something was.

415
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,670
Rym: The last time I flew JetBlue, the flight was late taking off.

416
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:44,930
Rym: It was late landing.

417
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,550
Rym: The bags took forever to come.

418
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,109
Rym: The in-flight entertainment didn't work.

419
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:50,008
Rym: There was just problems the whole time.

420
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,169
Scott: And other airlines are bad.

421
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,650
Scott: Other airlines started doing the screens.

422
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,870
Scott: Also, every airline has that now.

423
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,530
Scott: Plus, everyone has phones and tablets.

424
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:00,890
Scott: So I just turn off the screen.

425
00:26:02,453 --> 00:26:03,290
Scott: It's not a benefit.

426
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:12,089
Rym: But I remember the moment when I realized JetBlue might be going downhill was when they announced that they were introducing basically a first class cabin, like they added first class seats.

427
00:26:12,431 --> 00:26:18,029
Rym: Then they added a basic fare where you didn't get to pick your seat, which is the kind of thing that shit tier airlines like Spirit do.

428
00:26:19,052 --> 00:26:20,730
Rym: And it just got worse and worse and worse.

429
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:35,610
Rym: And that last year after I had this bad experience, I remember I looked online and I found out JetBlue that year was the worst performing airline in America in terms of on-time departures and arrivals by a wide margin.

430
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,069
Scott: I mean, they were the worst, but you got it.

431
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,563
Scott: The worst is basically like they're on time, like something like 70 to 80 percent of the time.

432
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,329
Scott: But it's like also everyone else is still doing better than that.

433
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:51,690
Rym: But also when they were not on time, it was by many, many, many hours.

434
00:26:51,851 --> 00:26:55,210
Rym: Not like, oh, we're 15 minutes late or like four hours late.

435
00:26:55,774 --> 00:26:56,630
Scott: So they're on time.

436
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:02,310
Scott: Performance is seventy three point four percent, which is like you think, oh, that's a pretty high number.

437
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:02,670
Scott: Right.

438
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,629
Scott: But actually out of major U.S.

439
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,750
Scott: Airlines, that's in tenth place.

440
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:12,570
Rym: So there's a lot of bad airlines doing better than JetBlue on that front.

441
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:13,470
Scott: Right.

442
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,290
Scott: Number one is Hawaiian Airlines at eighty nine point nine percent.

443
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:22,030
Scott: So if you take ten flights on Hawaiian Airlines, one of them is going to be delayed.

444
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:27,670
Scott: If you take ten flights on JetBlue, like two to three of them are going to be delayed.

445
00:27:28,371 --> 00:27:31,280
Scott: So it's like, OK, you're still very it's still.

446
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,369
Scott: delays are still unlikely, but they're twice as likely.

447
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,273
Scott: So that's like.

448
00:27:37,076 --> 00:27:49,830
Rym: but also they started doing the budget airline thing that Spirit also does, because that one time I took Spirit, they woke everybody up like in the middle of the flight with a with a loud announcement that came through every headset.

449
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:56,549
Rym: All the entertainment was paused and it was also in the air out of loudspeakers to give you this five minute pitch on their credit card.

450
00:27:57,972 --> 00:28:01,330
Rym: And then they walked around and asked everyone yes or no individually.

451
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,969
Rym: And you had to answer them if you wanted to sign up for it.

452
00:28:05,455 --> 00:28:06,409
Rym: It was awful.

453
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:12,407
Rym: There were ads playing on the screen or regardless of if you were using it, you couldn't turn the screen off.

454
00:28:13,614 --> 00:28:14,670
Rym: Also, the staff were rude.

455
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:18,370
Rym: I saw a fight in the line like it was just everything was.

456
00:28:18,552 --> 00:28:20,270
Scott: That's another thing when JetBlue started.

457
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,049
Scott: The food for the plane.

458
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:25,950
Rym: Oh, JetBlue had better food and coach than any other airline I'd ever flown in America.

459
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,690
Scott: Well, the whole the whole flight was the same seats.

460
00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:29,669
Scott: There were no separation.

461
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:30,090
Scott: Right.

462
00:28:30,191 --> 00:28:32,430
Scott: So everyone got the same food and it was free.

463
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:36,770
Scott: They would just go down and they would be like, you know, you know, which snack do you want?

464
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,329
Scott: Here's the list.

465
00:28:37,511 --> 00:28:37,830
Rym: It was nice.

466
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:38,735
Scott: Yeah.

467
00:28:39,771 --> 00:28:44,770
Scott: You know, but more now, of course, get a lot of non free shit.

468
00:28:44,878 --> 00:28:45,050
Scott: Right.

469
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:45,917
Scott: They're like pay to get.

470
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,089
Scott: you want to pay to get a meal.

471
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:53,530
Scott: You want to, you know, just started doing all the money grabbing stuff that everyone does that they didn't do originally.

472
00:28:54,892 --> 00:28:55,970
Rym: So we'll see what happens.

473
00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:04,107
Rym: But basically now there are four sort of good ish, good or good ish carriers in America in North America.

474
00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:07,430
Scott: Well, there's a lot of good ones that go to less places.

475
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:07,810
Scott: Right.

476
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,849
Scott: Like, you know, the Hawaiian Airlines, obviously.

477
00:29:10,078 --> 00:29:10,289
Scott: Right.

478
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,630
Scott: You got your Alaska Airlines in the northwest.

479
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:13,110
Scott: Right.

480
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:18,370
Scott: But, you know, you can't fly Alaska Airlines in from like New York to like in Europe.

481
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,081
Rym: My favorite airline to fly was Turkish air because it was way cheap and the food was better.

482
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:29,107
Rym: Like the food was like restaurant quality on these flights, even in like premium economy, like regular old seats.

483
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:33,449
Rym: But obviously couldn't really fly anywhere but to and from Istanbul on Turkish air.

484
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:34,009
Scott: Yeah.

485
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,338
Scott: Well, this is something I really don't understand.

486
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:41,468
Scott: is what, you know, it's not like trains where we have, you know, we know why we can't have.

487
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,529
Rym: Scott, do you want me to explain airport slots?

488
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:50,530
Scott: No, no, no, no, no, not the slots, but it's like you look at, you know, some of the airlines from around the world, right?

489
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:55,769
Scott: Like, you know, especially like Etihad and, you know, Lufthansa and some of these, you know, airlines.

490
00:29:56,232 --> 00:30:00,410
Scott: And they, you know, in the first class, at least, you know, they got some fancy.

491
00:30:00,991 --> 00:30:07,669
Rym: Yeah, you are already here's that you were comparing international flights to domestic and pseudo domestic flights.

492
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:10,728
Scott: But like even what U.S.

493
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,570
Scott: Airlines international flights, Delta international flights from the U.S.

494
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,569
Scott: has the fancy shit.

495
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:16,922
Rym: Delta.

496
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,670
Rym: You ever flown Delta one fancy?

497
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,870
Scott: The fanciest Delta plane is not Etihad fancy.

498
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:23,222
Scott: Well, no.

499
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:28,650
Rym: So depending what you're talking about, because there's there is business in first class.

500
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:31,610
Rym: Like I've flown the Delta one, whatever class for work a bunch of times.

501
00:30:32,051 --> 00:30:41,470
Rym: That is a private walled off cubicle with a bed that's completely lie flat and a real mattress and like a four star meal and all the booze you want.

502
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,330
Rym: And like a personal like a sommelier for your cabin.

503
00:30:44,813 --> 00:30:46,770
Rym: Like that is already like that is Delta.

504
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,930
Rym: You can even get that flying to Seattle.

505
00:30:49,332 --> 00:31:00,707
Rym: Not that you want to spend four thousand dollars on it, but no, what you're referring to that is a is like a special class of first class that only ridiculously dangerously rich people fly.

506
00:31:01,351 --> 00:31:06,250
Rym: I experienced it once because of Lufthansa fucked up and they basically had to get me out of flight.

507
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,410
Rym: So they gave me that and I took a shower while I was flying home and it was amazing.

508
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:14,162
Scott: But there is no airline in the like.

509
00:31:14,202 --> 00:31:18,810
Scott: no matter how rich you are in the US, if you want to take a shower on a US airline, you need a private jet.

510
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,192
Scott: You're not.

511
00:31:19,232 --> 00:31:23,290
Scott: there's no US airline that you can buy a ticket to where you can take a shower.

512
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:25,550
Scott: It's just that level is just not there.

513
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:37,890
Rym: So though that level primarily only exists on international airlines that are propped by sovereign states as part of a kleptocratic regime of some kind.

514
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:48,149
Scott: Either that or so, so even if you're rich, if you're flying on that fancy airline, some other rich person is footing part of the bill.

515
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:52,610
Rym: Well, more like some of those airlines are prestige projects for governments.

516
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,650
Rym: Like you'll notice a lot of them are owned by their respective governments.

517
00:31:56,756 --> 00:31:57,708
Scott: So they're not profiting.

518
00:31:58,131 --> 00:32:02,850
Rym: Yeah, or that's what they're profiting, but in indirect and complicated.

519
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:16,030
Scott: So if I made a US based international airline and I tried to be as fancy as the fanciest planes on Earth and buy like the best possible planes with the people who would be the people who it wouldn't work is what you're saying.

520
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:23,850
Rym: The people who would be flying those tickets on your airline would be primarily at you don't want to stereotype here.

521
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,829
Rym: These would be oligarchs from a short list of countries.

522
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,350
Scott: Yeah, that's who would be flying.

523
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:31,934
Rym: And depending, you might be able to.

524
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:36,510
Rym: US has evil wealthy people, but they're not as wealthy is the thing.

525
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,829
Scott: They just all use private jets.

526
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:38,723
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

527
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:43,950
Rym: There's a lot of complexity going on, but the end result of all this is not healthy.

528
00:32:45,092 --> 00:32:46,730
Rym: Again, the economy is not great.

529
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,707
Rym: This race to the bottom of the fuck up.

530
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:51,190
Rym: Yeah, this race to the bottom.

531
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,566
Rym: You know, the two worst airlines that are upscale merging into one terrible airline that's not the biggest.

532
00:32:57,832 --> 00:32:59,869
Rym: This is a symptom of the fact that nobody can afford anything.

533
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,632
Rym: And even just now.

534
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:06,628
Rym: I booked my flights to PAX last night and none of the flights are sold out with regular coach.

535
00:33:08,192 --> 00:33:11,710
Rym: But Delta even offers now a shit tear where you don't get to pick your seat.

536
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,730
Rym: You can't check a bag every flight.

537
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,009
Rym: The shit tear is sold out.

538
00:33:15,573 --> 00:33:16,605
Rym: That's all anyone can afford.

539
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:19,888
Scott: Well, also the price is going up.

540
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:24,529
Rym: Yeah, the fly the flights to PAX are about double what they were before covid.

541
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:28,069
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, the demand is there.

542
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,090
Scott: People want to go places, right?

543
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,467
Scott: Clearly.

544
00:33:30,731 --> 00:33:32,449
Scott: Otherwise, the shit tear wouldn't be sold out.

545
00:33:32,874 --> 00:33:34,090
Scott: But the price is too high.

546
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:34,847
Scott: It's like, come on.

547
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,230
Scott: You know, it's like, bring the price down.

548
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,279
Scott: You know, that's the problem.

549
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,930
Rym: Capitalism drives that race to the bottom because the shit tear.

550
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,607
Rym: Those are cheap dollars to go after.

551
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,889
Scott: But I'm saying lower your prices on your other classes to fill those seats.

552
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,588
Rym: Now, why bother?

553
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,429
Rym: Someone will fly or sometimes there's tax reasons to not fill them.

554
00:33:55,774 --> 00:33:56,649
Rym: They'll fill up later.

555
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:01,010
Rym: People who business travelers tend to buy tickets much closer to flight time.

556
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,529
Rym: So there's a lot of other factors going on.

557
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,850
Scott: That is an inherent problem.

558
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,395
Scott: I know, you know, that's just around.

559
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:07,282
Scott: our entire society is that there's.

560
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:22,150
Scott: there's too many benefits for people like having a storefront and not renting to anyone or or having empty seats or having a restaurant and throwing food out and not using all of going back to the HBO thing.

561
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:29,150
Rym: As part of that, Warner, they canceled a bunch of shows that were coming out, many of which were already like done with principal photography.

562
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:38,730
Rym: And they'll never release them now because they effectively make more money in terms of taxes by not releasing them than by releasing them.

563
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:39,646
Scott: Yeah.

564
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:46,050
Scott: Any time that that's the case, we're like, you know, like basically wasting saves money.

565
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:48,268
Scott: We need to change.

566
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:55,549
Scott: Like I would say it should be whatever the system is to be illegal for Amazon to destroy unsold TV inventory.

567
00:34:55,909 --> 00:35:01,430
Rym: They should have to sell them at a cut rate to the government and the government should be able to do whatever they want, including give them away for free to poor people.

568
00:35:02,132 --> 00:35:03,750
Scott: Well, I don't know if it needs to be illegal.

569
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,050
Scott: I just think there needs to be like a waste penalty.

570
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:06,262
Scott: Right.

571
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:12,490
Scott: It's like, oh, you know, you have a storefront and it's like, OK, you know, the rent is this, the property tax is this, you know, whatever.

572
00:35:12,812 --> 00:35:14,770
Scott: But it's like you're not renting to anyone right now.

573
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,330
Scott: Well, it's like, are you completely like renovating it or something?

574
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,429
Scott: No, it's just sitting there empty more than a street baron.

575
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,430
Rym: Some more enlightened.

576
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,408
Scott: You have to pay for not having it rented out.

577
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:25,091
Scott: Some

578
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:42,149
Rym: more enlightened countries, obviously not the United States, do have laws around things like if you are the holder of an apartment or you own a townhouse or a condo in a major city and you don't live in it and you aren't renting it to someone else, you get charged extra taxes for life.

579
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,710
Scott: But it's like you have an airplane.

580
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:47,010
Scott: It's going to use all this jet fuel and harm the climate.

581
00:35:47,374 --> 00:35:48,590
Rym: Those seats will fill up eventually.

582
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,450
Rym: It is, you know, a month and change before pack.

583
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,068
Scott: I'm just saying.

584
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:57,129
Scott: But it's like if you have an airplane and it's going to fly somewhere and do that much damage to the world, it better be full.

585
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,830
Scott: And if it's the airline should be penalized for empty seats, basically.

586
00:36:02,137 --> 00:36:02,328
Rym: Yep.

587
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:08,829
Rym: But simultaneously, airlines should be fucked the fuck over if they bump you nonconsensually from a flight you booked.

588
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:10,209
Scott: Of course.

589
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,910
Rym: So, yeah, one last little news.

590
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,490
Rym: We don't need to dwell on it because, frankly, just go watch the videos if you care.

591
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:28,670
Rym: But for those of you unaware, there is a fascist dipshit named Alex Jones, who is somewhat famous and infamous and terrifyingly has a huge fan following in the United States.

592
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:31,570
Scott: He's got some problems in his brain department.

593
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,962
Rym: He is a dangerous conspiratorial Nazi is.

594
00:36:35,284 --> 00:36:39,149
Rym: those are some of the most charitable things I can say about this guy who causes a lot of harm.

595
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:47,309
Rym: One of the harms he perpetrated was after the Sandy Hook massacre, where autistic kids were murdered with guns in a school.

596
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:59,870
Rym: He, on his news quote news show, spent a lot of time claiming that the shootings were fake, that those kids weren't real and actually going after the parents of the dead kids, claiming that they were liars.

597
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:07,489
Rym: And of course, those parents sued for defamation and libel and slander and all sorts of emotional harm.

598
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:10,283
Rym: They're getting death threats from not just because he didn't.

599
00:37:10,383 --> 00:37:16,950
Scott: he didn't necessarily commit a crime, or at least if he did, no prosecutor was going to do anything about it.

600
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:21,730
Rym: Well, the crimes he committed basically are boiling down to libel and slander.

601
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,209
Scott: Well, they may have committed crimes now.

602
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:26,149
Rym: Oh, yeah, there's a lot.

603
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,050
Scott: There's perjury is a crime.

604
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:32,950
Rym: So long story short, he eventually did eventually lose his lawsuit.

605
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:34,590
Rym: And you might be saying, lose his lawsuit.

606
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:36,769
Rym: But isn't the news that it's ongoing right now?

607
00:37:37,694 --> 00:37:38,969
Rym: So here's the funny thing.

608
00:37:39,694 --> 00:37:42,690
Rym: He lost the lawsuit by default at the start.

609
00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:53,030
Rym: He was found guilty without the jury having to do anything because in the course of this ridiculously long trial, he never his lawyers and him never complied with discovery.

610
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:55,490
Rym: And eventually the judge issued a default ruling.

611
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:56,968
Rym: The trial was over.

612
00:37:57,672 --> 00:38:04,609
Rym: All they're all they're deliberating is how much money he has to pay in punitive damages to the families he harms.

613
00:38:05,405 --> 00:38:05,690
Rym: Mm hmm.

614
00:38:06,092 --> 00:38:16,690
Rym: And in the course of that trial, where all they're doing is figuring out how much money he owes, he has committed several additional crimes for which he will likely be prosecuted.

615
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,650
Rym: Some of them happened in the courtroom directly.

616
00:38:21,013 --> 00:38:23,450
Rym: He threatened the lawyer of the parents.

617
00:38:23,752 --> 00:38:25,470
Rym: He appears to have threatened the parents directly.

618
00:38:26,192 --> 00:38:30,870
Rym: He committed so much perjury that you just got to watch some of those videos.

619
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:38,650
Rym: But the funniest thing that happened was this Phoenix Wright moment where he claimed he didn't have any text messages about Sandy Hook.

620
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,869
Rym: He never said anything about it.

621
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:40,608
Rym: Nothing on his phone.

622
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:48,109
Rym: The lawyer who's going after him was just showed him a whole bunch of his own text messages and you see him start to like squirm on the stand.

623
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:49,789
Rym: And they're like, do you recognize any of these?

624
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,570
Rym: He's like, no, I'm not a tech guy.

625
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:55,768
Rym: And they're like, would you believe that we have the contents of your entire fucking cell phone?

626
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:57,249
Rym: And he's like, what?

627
00:38:57,933 --> 00:38:58,826
Rym: No, you don't.

628
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:10,410
Rym: And basically his lawyers accidentally sent the lawyers on the other side the entire contents of his cell phone, which he had claimed.

629
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,410
Scott: Even if I had a lawyer, I would not give my lawyer my phone.

630
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,110
Scott: I don't give your phone to anyone.

631
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:18,410
Scott: Not your lawyer, not the other person's lawyer, not the cops, not nobody.

632
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,890
Scott: But even worse, not your child, not your partner.

633
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:28,827
Rym: This data was dated that he testified under penalty of perjury did not exist and he did not have.

634
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,695
Rym: So now he's trying to.

635
00:39:30,775 --> 00:39:34,507
Rym: now his lawyers tried to claw it back and saying you can't use that evidence against us.

636
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:40,050
Rym: And then the judge's response was basically, yeah, no, you're absolutely fucked.

637
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:43,649
Rym: And this is all on video and you can just watch it.

638
00:39:44,073 --> 00:39:45,649
Rym: And it's only going to get better from here.

639
00:39:46,372 --> 00:40:01,729
Scott: I do want to say this again, though, because it's I've seen a lot more recently, like I've been reading comments, just, you know, just not not on the specific topic, but people just casually online talking about like, oh, yeah, I was, you know, poking around my friend's phone or it's like what?

640
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:08,890
Rym: It's like, listen, though, we were out at dinner with our friends the other night and a Brando stranger needed help.

641
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:11,529
Rym: And one of our friends just handed them their cell phone to make a call.

642
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:16,650
Rym: I would never let someone touch my cell phone while it was unlocked, even in my presence.

643
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:20,790
Scott: Yeah, it's like absolutely under no circumstances.

644
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:26,910
Scott: If you have a smartphone, not just your smartphone, but your password to anything at all of any significance.

645
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:27,570
Scott: Right.

646
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,310
Scott: You know, your email, anything I don't care.

647
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:32,866
Scott: It could be, you know, your partner of 60 years.

648
00:40:33,872 --> 00:40:36,170
Scott: You trust them with your entire life.

649
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,523
Scott: Right.

650
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:40,310
Scott: There's there's no reason to distrust them in any way, shape or form.

651
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:40,970
Scott: Right.

652
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:44,150
Scott: Still, you do not tell them your password to anything.

653
00:40:44,594 --> 00:40:45,989
Scott: You do not give them your phone.

654
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:47,849
Scott: You never touch anyone else's phone.

655
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:52,430
Scott: Absolutely not under any circumstance, not even in an emergency circumstance.

656
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:52,890
Scott: Right.

657
00:40:53,192 --> 00:40:56,410
Scott: In an emergency, the phone has an emergency mode that they can use.

658
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:01,709
Rym: So even beyond that, I am not suggesting you commit crimes, but suppose you do.

659
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:08,470
Rym: If you're committing crimes, don't write text messages talking about the crimes.

660
00:41:11,454 --> 00:41:12,269
Rym: Just don't.

661
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:17,509
Rym: There's a reason it was so hard to go after Al Capone back in the day because they didn't fucking write anything down.

662
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,969
Rym: Nobody wrote anything down.

663
00:41:19,314 --> 00:41:20,189
Rym: And I saw an article.

664
00:41:20,592 --> 00:41:23,009
Rym: This was on like CNN earlier this year.

665
00:41:23,532 --> 00:41:25,990
Rym: And I think I just must have forgotten to use it on GeekNights.

666
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:36,010
Rym: But it was this mob guy doing an interview because he was like in jail and like he was going to get out soon and he was writing a book and he talked about how, yeah, young mobsters, they are stupid as shit.

667
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,229
Rym: They use their phones for everything and all the evidence is right there.

668
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,850
Rym: Like they're they're setting up slacks.

669
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:43,030
Rym: They're planning crimes in slacks.

670
00:41:43,613 --> 00:41:45,070
Rym: And this is why they keep getting fingered.

671
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:46,449
Rym: And he's just like, these kids are fucked.

672
00:41:48,035 --> 00:41:48,890
Rym: And it was really funny.

673
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:49,690
Rym: I got to find it again.

674
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,469
Rym: And we should use that as a thing of the day.

675
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:56,130
Scott: Oh, there is one more news, right?

676
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,710
Scott: After five years of K-pop news, right?

677
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,029
Scott: When it's enormous, enormous K-pop news.

678
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:04,690
Scott: After five years of waiting, right?

679
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:15,668
Scott: Girls Generation is coming back with an album, a full album from people who have people who have gone their separate ways and went to separate companies who come back single forever one.

680
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:18,389
Scott: No, it's a comeback entire album.

681
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:25,370
Scott: And, you know, as I said earlier, right, you know, K-pop people, you know, they love to make a lot of content and give it for free, right?

682
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:32,249
Scott: They basically, you know, they've been already been burying the world with free contents for like the past week.

683
00:42:32,772 --> 00:42:35,810
Scott: And starting tomorrow, it's going to be like double buried.

684
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:44,589
Scott: Like there's like a whole schedule of like, we're releasing this then and this then and this then and ninety nine point nine percent of it is all free.

685
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:47,469
Scott: It's like, where does the money come from?

686
00:42:47,852 --> 00:42:49,930
Scott: It's like, I guess, selling albums, streams.

687
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:50,666
Scott: I don't know.

688
00:42:50,994 --> 00:42:51,529
Scott: YouTube ads.

689
00:42:52,051 --> 00:42:52,365
Scott: I don't know.

690
00:42:52,970 --> 00:43:04,810
Rym: Well, I mean, the question of where does I mean, the question of where does money come from fundamentally is increasingly something that even in my professional job, I have difficulty actually saying, right?

691
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:05,332
Scott: It's like.

692
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:10,070
Scott: here's here's some examples of the contents that they've released from, you know, small stuff, right?

693
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:14,170
Scott: Like they had a photo shoot and they released a few photos each day, right?

694
00:43:14,554 --> 00:43:15,910
Scott: A little tiny teaser video.

695
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:20,389
Scott: They have like these mood sampler videos, like we're not going to let you hear the album, but you know what?

696
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,364
Scott: We'll show you a short like one minute video to give you an idea of what the album feels like.

697
00:43:26,152 --> 00:43:28,690
Scott: It's like a teaser for it out, you know, stuff like that.

698
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:29,388
Scott: Small stuff.

699
00:43:29,951 --> 00:43:38,210
Scott: They have an entire like, you know, you said unscripted reality show like they've been doing in Korea for decades plus, right?

700
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:45,110
Scott: They just because they're coming back with an album, they produced a whole series like, you know, I don't know how many episodes it's going to be.

701
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:50,967
Scott: It's already up to like four or five of like hour plus long TV episodes of them.

702
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:56,290
Scott: just like we're in a house, you know, chilling, you know, whatever, right?

703
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,248
Scott: Just watching them waste time.

704
00:43:59,251 --> 00:44:02,870
Scott: It's like, you know, well, we'll go to the beach.

705
00:44:03,032 --> 00:44:04,069
Scott: Watch us go to the beach.

706
00:44:04,636 --> 00:44:05,430
Scott: Yay, right?

707
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,601
Scott: An hour like that.

708
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:10,097
Scott: But just like, you know, they're just.

709
00:44:10,157 --> 00:44:14,031
Scott: they're just burying everyone in in content right now.

710
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:14,916
Scott: And, you know, they've been.

711
00:44:14,997 --> 00:44:21,870
Scott: it's you know, it's interesting in that, you know, we haven't seen, you know, K-pop groups, you know, even, you know, worldwide, right?

712
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,450
Scott: Boy bands, girl groups, whatever, right?

713
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:29,790
Scott: You know, teen pop stuff has always like come and gone, right?

714
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:30,529
Scott: Backstreet Boys.

715
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,270
Scott: I think they still they're somewhere, right?

716
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:34,429
Scott: I don't think they're broken up.

717
00:44:35,693 --> 00:44:37,169
Rym: I have some name I haven't heard in a while.

718
00:44:38,031 --> 00:44:39,739
Scott: I'm just saying like, you know, it's like.

719
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,970
Scott: maybe they do comebacks once in a while right here and there.

720
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:47,010
Scott: But it's like, you know, they're not like still a thing for real, right?

721
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,770
Rym: It's like they are still a thing for real.

722
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,550
Rym: The Backstreet Boys are still directly active.

723
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:57,410
Scott: Yeah, but they're not like, you know, making a huge splash with albums constantly, right?

724
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:05,870
Scott: It's like, you know, these groups, it's like they'll be like an like one more than one album per year, like constant releasing of new content in your face.

725
00:45:06,312 --> 00:45:08,550
Scott: And then they get too old for that shit and they're done.

726
00:45:08,732 --> 00:45:09,287
Scott: They go away.

727
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:15,464
Scott: You know, it's not like, you know, rock stars in the 70s who keep going until they're 100 years old.

728
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:23,049
Rym: Yeah, like if you ever go to Vegas, you'll see a lot of billboards where the first thing you will think is so-and-so is still alive.

729
00:45:23,872 --> 00:45:24,168
Scott: Exactly.

730
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,230
Scott: And still working?

731
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,150
Scott: Why aren't they retired?

732
00:45:26,573 --> 00:45:27,210
Rym: I'm still working.

733
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:27,719
Rym: I'm shocked.

734
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:28,330
Rym: they're alive.

735
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:29,287
Scott: Right.

736
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:32,968
Scott: But these girls' generation started, you know, 15 years ago, right?

737
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:41,389
Scott: When they were like in their late teens and now they're in their like early 30s, late 20s, and it's like, you know, how long are they going to go?

738
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:42,367
Scott: Who knows?

739
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:44,489
Scott: But they're going right now.

740
00:45:44,771 --> 00:45:51,147
Scott: And it's pretty funny to see them next to like actual teenagers in the same, the same scene, you know?

741
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,670
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

742
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:06,139
Rym: So speaking of HBO, my family, one of the, you know, we, we were, I was born in 1982 and our family got HBO.

743
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:13,729
Rym: Basically when it launched, we had this tiny little satellite dish and all it got was HBO.

744
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:21,229
Rym: And we would like the whole family would get together and watch movies on TV, which was a big deal back then.

745
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:31,208
Scott: And, you know, like we talked about, it used to be that you could only see a movie if you either went to a theater or rented a VHS tape, which even then was not like.

746
00:46:31,508 --> 00:46:36,250
Rym: in the early eighties, VHS was not like a saturated market yet.

747
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:37,349
Scott: It was still coming in.

748
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,266
Scott: It was still coming in.

749
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:43,369
Rym: You know, like not everyone had had VCRs when I was a kid.

750
00:46:44,232 --> 00:46:48,370
Scott: And what, you know, there weren't video rental places like maybe the mid or late eighties.

751
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:55,130
Rym: You know, I mean, we were going to video rental places, but we were going to the places that predated blockbuster video and predated like mammoth video.

752
00:46:55,170 --> 00:47:10,429
Rym: I'm talking like a little shop that had a hundred VHS tapes and like 50 Betamax tapes and a weird old guy who would just like you to ask him, you basically ask him for like what kind of movie you wanted and he'd give you options and then you pick something.

753
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:14,310
Scott: I mean, we had Blockbuster didn't come to where we were.

754
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:17,767
Scott: Blockbuster, it says on the internet was founded in 85, but it wasn't.

755
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:25,489
Rym: It didn't open in our neighborhood till I think I remember when our mammoth video went under because the low blockbuster fucked it over.

756
00:47:26,623 --> 00:47:26,770
Scott: Yeah.

757
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:29,689
Scott: It's like we had a tiny video place until then.

758
00:47:29,851 --> 00:47:31,970
Scott: But it was, you know, like you said, a tiny video.

759
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,330
Rym: So one of the point is accent.

760
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:36,690
Scott: You couldn't just watch movies whenever the hell you wanted.

761
00:47:36,811 --> 00:47:40,850
Scott: Even if you were pirating or whatever, it was an event to see a movie.

762
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:44,950
Scott: If a movie was on television, that was a big deal because it was rare.

763
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:53,870
Rym: I remember when they showed Alice in Wonderland, the Disney animated feature on TV as a big premiere, like one week night at prime time with ads and cut to shit.

764
00:47:54,391 --> 00:48:04,350
Rym: And the next day, literally everyone in the elementary school had watched it the previous night, every single person, every teacher, every kid, everyone.

765
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:04,874
Scott: Yeah.

766
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:12,430
Scott: Sometimes if something was really special on TV, right, that you like, you would never going to see again, you would get a blank VHS just to record.

767
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:13,786
Rym: Sometimes we recorded everything.

768
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,469
Scott: When the hell are you going to see that again?

769
00:48:18,252 --> 00:48:19,769
Rym: So, uh, HBO.

770
00:48:20,391 --> 00:48:25,313
Rym: My thing of the day is that they had their, their, uh, basically the eye catch or the sonic ID.

771
00:48:25,353 --> 00:48:31,510
Rym: they'd like, Hey, you're about to watch a thing on HBO that they would show right before a movie started.

772
00:48:32,132 --> 00:48:32,570
Scott: And same thing.

773
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:33,870
Scott: You know, everyone does that, right?

774
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:41,149
Scott: Like, you know, Cartoon Network has the thing at the end of the show where like, you know, the logo is there and it goes boing, boing, you know, and, uh, who else has one?

775
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:45,310
Rym: So I had watched, well, kind of like, uh, THX noise, right?

776
00:48:46,171 --> 00:48:51,418
Rym: Or you watch it, you watch a certain movies animated in Japan and the, this is going to be a very good movie.

777
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:52,890
Rym: logo and icon and crashing waves.

778
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:54,826
Scott: College Schumer had the, had the, huh?

779
00:48:58,471 --> 00:49:02,289
Scott: So, uh, I really want a GeekNights, one of those, but I can't find anyone to make one.

780
00:49:02,897 --> 00:49:03,850
Rym: I can hire someone to make one.

781
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:05,089
Rym: We got, we got some money laying around.

782
00:49:05,874 --> 00:49:07,150
Scott: I thought we spent most of the monies.

783
00:49:07,972 --> 00:49:11,730
Rym: No, we still have plenty of GeekNights, money laying around.

784
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:12,990
Scott: Oh, okay.

785
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,007
Scott: Well then I'll spend more then.

786
00:49:14,372 --> 00:49:15,549
Rym: Ah, absolutely can.

787
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:16,990
Rym: Let me know what you want to spend it on.

788
00:49:17,213 --> 00:49:18,110
Rym: Just send me invoices.

789
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:18,890
Rym: We'll chat anyway.

790
00:49:19,311 --> 00:49:29,090
Rym: So find somebody to make a, a Sonic before any of you get any, uh, GeekNights is technically profitable, but assuming Scott and I are not paid for our labor.

791
00:49:29,311 --> 00:49:33,750
Rym: So just to give you a sense of GeekNights is not profitable if we are paid for our labor.

792
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:35,692
Rym: But I digress.

793
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:43,630
Rym: HBO appears to have had four, maybe five, looks like four such openings in its history.

794
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:48,046
Rym: And I have actually only ever seen two of them, the 1982 one.

795
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:55,269
Rym: And then in 1983, they made their most iconic one, which if you watch this, it might not seem that impressive.

796
00:49:56,032 --> 00:50:02,953
Rym: Uh, go look at what it took to make CG and special effects in the year 1983.

797
00:50:02,953 --> 00:50:04,750
Rym: And this is actually pretty fucking impressive.

798
00:50:05,623 --> 00:50:05,768
Scott: Yep.

799
00:50:06,672 --> 00:50:10,210
Rym: And as a kid, this was the holy shit.

800
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,030
Rym: We are about to watch a movie thing.

801
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:16,211
Rym: Like I watched this again, the HBO intro from 1983.

802
00:50:16,211 --> 00:50:20,970
Rym: And, uh, I got this weird nostalgic excitement in the back of my brain.

803
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:28,149
Rym: I felt like a kid again, about to sit down and watch a movie, uh, which in the pre-internet era was, uh, a peak experience.

804
00:50:29,638 --> 00:50:30,108
Scott: So what do you got?

805
00:50:31,711 --> 00:50:34,950
Scott: So, uh, all nerds, right?

806
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:41,161
Scott: You know, you know, someone like me nerd, I just curious about anything that I don't know, right?

807
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:42,490
Scott: Anything that's a mystery.

808
00:50:42,813 --> 00:50:44,370
Scott: I have a curiosity for it, right?

809
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:48,570
Scott: Even if I don't have an actual interest in it, it's just like, it's a land of mystery.

810
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:49,187
Scott: I got to know.

811
00:50:49,437 --> 00:50:49,689
Scott: Right.

812
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:57,270
Scott: And one of those things is obviously something that I think everyone who's a nerd finds fascinating, which is the power grid, right?

813
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:04,250
Scott: You've all around us is this electricity that we need to maintain our, you know, society for however long we can make it last.

814
00:51:04,832 --> 00:51:06,866
Scott: And we see all this equipment around, right?

815
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,610
Scott: Like this in, in our neighborhoods everywhere.

816
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:14,070
Scott: And 90%, 99% of people have no idea what the fuck that shit is.

817
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:14,909
Scott: It's just shit.

818
00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:16,570
Scott: They don't touch invisible.

819
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:17,869
Rym: Most people, like they don't even see it.

820
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,050
Rym: It's just like background.

821
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:23,983
Scott: Yeah, you either don't see it or you do see it, but you don't know what it is and you don't care.

822
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:28,609
Rym: Maybe you run into it because you got an umbrella in front of your face and you're walking at speed down a sidewalk.

823
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:30,150
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

824
00:51:31,551 --> 00:51:35,848
Scott: You know, but it's like, you know, something happens and people, you know, something happens wrong with it.

825
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,464
Scott: People like, ah, it's broken, fix it.

826
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:41,450
Scott: But it's like, well, you know, there's these big buckets up on the pole.

827
00:51:41,552 --> 00:51:42,689
Scott: What are those buckets even do?

828
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:43,550
Scott: Why are they buckets?

829
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:47,250
Rym: What, you know, those are transformers filled with coils and oil.

830
00:51:47,997 --> 00:51:48,389
Scott: Yeah, we know.

831
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:49,249
Scott: I know what they are.

832
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:51,590
Rym: I mean, I know what all this shit is, but I'm weird about the electric grid.

833
00:51:52,391 --> 00:51:53,530
Scott: Yeah, we watch YouTube.

834
00:51:53,671 --> 00:52:00,968
Scott: So if you wonder what some of this shit is, I actually found an amazing YouTube channel, There's this dude.

835
00:52:01,091 --> 00:52:02,090
Scott: He's Canadian.

836
00:52:03,215 --> 00:52:03,909
Scott: What's his name?

837
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:07,170
Rym: It's Bob's Decline, lineman blogger.

838
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:10,370
Scott: So this dude is a professional lineman.

839
00:52:10,571 --> 00:52:15,286
Scott: His job is to go out and mess with all the dangerous power grid.

840
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:16,390
Scott: shit, right?

841
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:23,209
Scott: You know, repair it, maintain it, check on it that you're never going to go near or look at in your whole life.

842
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:26,810
Scott: And he is just showing you fucking everything.

843
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,569
Scott: He's like, this is what it is.

844
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,590
Scott: This is how it works.

845
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:30,628
Scott: This is what it's for.

846
00:52:31,032 --> 00:52:32,129
Scott: He has all the parts of it.

847
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:40,430
Scott: It's like, I feel like if you watched all his videos, you it's like, and then you obviously should go to actual training before you try to do the job.

848
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,690
Rym: You know, there's a training yard for that right near our apartment.

849
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:46,089
Rym: Like they have fake houses and all this shit just there.

850
00:52:46,884 --> 00:52:46,968
Scott: Yeah.

851
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:50,810
Scott: But it's like it would kind of half mostly prepare you for the job.

852
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:51,110
Scott: Right.

853
00:52:52,175 --> 00:52:59,190
Scott: If you watched all his videos and then went to get the actual training, it would probably be like a breeze because you would be hearing shit you've already known.

854
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:07,470
Scott: So in this one particular video, even though he's got a lot of cool ones, uh, he's got what's known as like a pad mounted transformer.

855
00:53:07,763 --> 00:53:07,910
Scott: Right.

856
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:12,130
Scott: So most of the transformers, you know, that we see in everyday life are those bucket ones.

857
00:53:12,295 --> 00:53:12,527
Scott: Right.

858
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:19,489
Scott: But there's also ones that are pad mounted, which means there's a pad of concrete and it's just sitting on the ground.

859
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:27,410
Rym: You know, those green, those green metal boxes that don't have any signs on them other than stay away that you never touched, like, you know, in the front yard of a suburban house.

860
00:53:28,641 --> 00:53:28,725
Scott: Yep.

861
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,368
Scott: And it's like, Hey, it's a box.

862
00:53:30,552 --> 00:53:31,249
Scott: It's not a bucket.

863
00:53:31,391 --> 00:53:33,390
Scott: How is it doing the same thing as the bucket?

864
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:42,450
Scott: Well, you know, it's, it's taking the voltage that's, you know, ridiculously high voltage from the power lines and decreasing it to a lower voltage, the kind your house needs.

865
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:42,847
Scott: Right.

866
00:53:43,775 --> 00:53:44,609
Scott: And how does it work?

867
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:48,010
Scott: Well, he's going to open it up and show you in this video, right?

868
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:51,450
Scott: All the mysteries of inside the green box are now revealed.

869
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:52,990
Scott: It's now really boring.

870
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:53,544
Scott: Green box.

871
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:59,429
Rym: When I was in middle school, there was, we actually had one of these in the easement in our front yard and we'd kind of play on it.

872
00:53:59,651 --> 00:54:01,769
Rym: Like it was just part of our, cause we couldn't get into it.

873
00:54:02,051 --> 00:54:04,350
Rym: They're not dangerous unless something has gone horribly wrong.

874
00:54:04,391 --> 00:54:05,609
Rym: Unless you go, go inside them.

875
00:54:06,564 --> 00:54:06,690
Scott: Yeah.

876
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:09,549
Scott: Just don't open it and you'll probably, you'll be all right.

877
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,062
Rym: Yep.

878
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:13,330
Scott: And uh, when I was going near it, it's probably, it's not the greatest idea either.

879
00:54:13,471 --> 00:54:19,530
Scott: It's not like, you know, as an adult, it's not that risky, but it's not necessary either.

880
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:27,989
Rym: Like I might like, I would consider if there wasn't anything else around sitting on one, like waiting for a bus, but uh, that's about the extent of it.

881
00:54:28,271 --> 00:54:30,408
Rym: Don't get a piece of metal and try to wedge it into the door.

882
00:54:31,631 --> 00:54:36,910
Rym: You don't say in the meta moment, the GeekNights book club book is Binti.

883
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,150
Rym: We will do the show two weeks from now.

884
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:41,530
Rym: Cause this book will not take you more than an hour to read.

885
00:54:41,591 --> 00:54:42,207
Rym: It's a novella.

886
00:54:42,896 --> 00:54:43,368
Rym: Just read it.

887
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,110
Rym: Space College.

888
00:54:44,433 --> 00:54:45,268
Rym: We'll do a show on it.

889
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:52,690
Scott: And then Scott, uh, I think, did you update the old current GeekNights' website with the book club selection?

890
00:54:52,852 --> 00:54:53,524
Rym: Of course I did.

891
00:54:54,381 --> 00:54:54,689
Scott: Oh, okay.

892
00:54:54,852 --> 00:54:55,490
Rym: It's right there right now.

893
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:57,689
Rym: In fact, I've got it up on the live stream for everyone to see.

894
00:54:57,891 --> 00:54:58,168
Scott: Okay.

895
00:54:58,931 --> 00:55:06,290
Rym: I also linked the episode we just did on non Fox gambit, uh, to the book club, uh, note on the website.

896
00:55:06,912 --> 00:55:12,369
Rym: And I will tell all of you, the listener, I did read the rest of the books in the, after nine Fox gambit.

897
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:16,270
Rym: And all I will say is that there's three, there's three in total.

898
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,047
Rym: There's three in total.

899
00:55:17,412 --> 00:55:18,663
Scott: They're a complete trilogy.

900
00:55:18,723 --> 00:55:19,510
Scott: or is there good stuff?

901
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:20,469
Scott: There's not going to be any more.

902
00:55:20,711 --> 00:55:21,830
Scott: There's a, there's a fourth book.

903
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:24,770
Rym: That's just a bunch of unrelated short stories set in that universe.

904
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,650
Scott: But those three people love to do that shit these days.

905
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:28,294
Rym: Tell a complete.

906
00:55:28,415 --> 00:55:29,849
Rym: even E and M banks did a bunch of that.

907
00:55:30,395 --> 00:55:30,966
Rym: And they're pretty good.

908
00:55:31,451 --> 00:55:35,590
Rym: But those three books tell a complete contiguous story.

909
00:55:35,972 --> 00:55:38,590
Rym: It ends in an absolutely satisfying way.

910
00:55:39,016 --> 00:55:39,890
Rym: I have no complaints.

911
00:55:40,032 --> 00:55:41,049
Rym: I love the shit out of them.

912
00:55:41,613 --> 00:55:44,027
Rym: The second and third books are even better than the first one.

913
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:47,230
Rym: Uh, a lot of interesting things happen.

914
00:55:48,132 --> 00:55:54,110
Rym: Uh, you learn some things about the moths, you learn some stuff about Judeo and what his real deal was.

915
00:55:54,851 --> 00:56:01,290
Rym: Uh, those books are about democracy and revolution and how you design a society and where the hard work is.

916
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:02,428
Scott: We knew that from book one.

917
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:13,269
Rym: But book one barely scratches the tiniest edge of a tangent to the surface of that topic compared to the second and third books.

918
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:24,470
Rym: And also I will say in the third book, uh, basically you find out what, what piece of technology in that universe is actually the Evangelions, uh, among other things.

919
00:56:24,992 --> 00:56:28,530
Rym: I absolutely recommend if you like Ninefox Gambit, read the other two books.

920
00:56:28,591 --> 00:56:29,490
Rym: They are fantastic.

921
00:56:30,383 --> 00:56:30,530
Scott: Hmm.

922
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:35,230
Scott: And, uh, some of, some of the listener disagreed.

923
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:37,550
Rym: Yeah, I don't understand.

924
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:47,930
Rym: Cause the first book is actually less compelling to me than the second two because the second two are also way more relevant to the year 2022 in the real world and the kinds of problems we're going to face as a society.

925
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:55,402
Rym: Uh, anyway, uh, I will be at PAX West on Sunday, September 4th, 1230 PM Pacific time in the.

926
00:57:00,991 --> 00:57:03,228
Scott: I'm still not getting on a plane to go anywhere.

927
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:03,865
Scott: Yup.

928
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:07,830
Rym: And it looks like Magfest announced dates on time or otherwise.

929
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:08,106
Scott: Yup.

930
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:14,570
Rym: There's a decent chance I will go to Magfest to do some panels, but, uh, it'll, it looks like they announced it'll still be a mass event.

931
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:16,290
Rym: We'll see how COVID goes.

932
00:57:16,651 --> 00:57:24,510
Rym: I can't imagine I would go to Magfest to do anything other than do some panels and otherwise mostly avoid the crowds and the con, but, uh, stay tuned.

933
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:25,470
Rym: Same with PAX Unplugged.

934
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:26,227
Rym: We'll see what happens.

935
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:29,789
Rym: I guess we can get right into it.

936
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:33,670
Rym: Vending machines, a fantastic suggestion from the listener.

937
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:43,147
Rym: Uh, the one thing we're not going to do is cover the history of vending machines because I literally know nothing other than what I just read on Wikipedia right before I called Scott to do the show.

938
00:57:44,892 --> 00:57:48,250
Rym: I pretty much only know about the modern era of vending machines.

939
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:59,410
Scott: So anything I don't know the specific history of vending machines, but the one, the only thing I do know historically is that, you know, when the vending machine was introduced, it was sort of like a wow deal, right?

940
00:57:59,511 --> 00:58:02,590
Scott: Like, you know, Holy crap, you're selling things without people, right?

941
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:05,030
Scott: You had like the automats and things of that nature, right?

942
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:10,490
Scott: It's like, you know, you could collect coin operated vending machines, go back to 1615.

943
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:10,574
Scott: Whoa.

944
00:58:10,933 --> 00:58:11,107
Scott: Okay.

945
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:12,190
Scott: It's farther back than I thought.

946
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:17,330
Rym: And there is, there are multiple accounts of one in first century, Roman, Egypt.

947
00:58:17,775 --> 00:58:18,749
Rym: It would accept a coin.

948
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:24,445
Rym: And if the, and based on the way to the coin, it would dispense Holy water from a fountain for a certain amount of time.

949
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:26,133
Scott: Wow.

950
00:58:26,771 --> 00:58:26,855
Scott: Yeah.

951
00:58:27,411 --> 00:58:29,542
Scott: I mean, I was thinking, you know, like slot machines were.

952
00:58:29,582 --> 00:58:33,510
Rym: so I was, I was thinking what 1800s, maybe like one weird thing.

953
00:58:33,831 --> 00:58:37,150
Rym: And then I come to Wikipedia and it's like 1615.

954
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:37,241
Scott: Yeah.

955
00:58:37,571 --> 00:58:39,943
Rym: Also 100.

956
00:58:39,943 --> 00:58:40,030
Scott: Yeah.

957
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:45,330
Scott: I was thinking like, you know, slot machine would be like some of the oldest kind of sort of vending machine, right?

958
00:58:45,431 --> 00:58:47,690
Scott: Just a coin operated mechanical machine.

959
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:54,514
Rym: There's a photo in the Wikipedia article of a stamp and postcard vending machine from Japan from 1904.

960
00:58:54,514 --> 00:58:55,790
Scott: No, Japan loves the vending machine.

961
00:58:55,852 --> 00:58:56,126
Rym: Oh yeah.

962
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:05,870
Rym: So, um, I guess I mostly want to talk about vending machines on a high level in terms of, you know, my anecdotes, interactions, what purpose they serve in society.

963
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:16,010
Rym: Cause, uh, vending machines used to be way more important to me when I was a kid who didn't really have my own money or my own way to get around except biking.

964
00:59:16,651 --> 00:59:27,347
Rym: So really the only things I could buy were things that my parents bought when I was in their presence for me or things I could get with like the quarters in my pocket when I was unattended.

965
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:34,128
Rym: So like going to school, there was one vending machine that had soda and it was an area students weren't supposed to go.

966
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:37,965
Rym: And I would sneak back there to like get a can of Dr Pepper with.

967
00:59:38,065 --> 00:59:40,069
Scott: our schools just had vending machines.

968
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:42,210
Scott: Like these are here to get money out of you kids.

969
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:42,650
Rym: Whoa.

970
00:59:42,951 --> 00:59:47,070
Rym: Our school had all the schools I went to all the way, even through high school had rules.

971
00:59:47,512 --> 00:59:51,790
Rym: The vending machines were not allowed to be on during school hours.

972
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:53,629
Rym: They were only on outside of school hours.

973
00:59:54,131 --> 01:00:00,190
Rym: And in middle school, they weren't allowed to have allowed to have soda pop in high school.

974
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:04,829
Scott: My first year of high school, the high school was a Pepsi high school and all had all Pepsi vending machines.

975
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,270
Scott: And then they signed a deal, right?

976
01:00:07,311 --> 01:00:08,230
Scott: It's a public high school.

977
01:00:08,511 --> 01:00:12,883
Scott: They signed a deal with Coke to buy like a new scoreboard for the football field or some shit.

978
01:00:13,293 --> 01:00:14,770
Scott: Obviously this is a bad deal.

979
01:00:15,152 --> 01:00:21,229
Scott: It's like it was a good deal for Coke and a bad one for the school, but they did it because they're, you know, whatever capitalism, I don't know.

980
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:26,328
Scott: But Coke replaced all the vending machines and all the Pepsi vending machines in the school with different ones.

981
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:35,389
Scott: And then when a surge came out, it was like there was surge all over the school because they filled the vending machines with surge.

982
01:00:37,011 --> 01:00:44,249
Rym: Yeah, basically no school I went to at any point had vending machines for soda pop that were accessible to the kids.

983
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:44,829
Scott: Oh, no.

984
01:00:45,071 --> 01:00:47,670
Scott: I remember now the surge was all over the school.

985
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:49,230
Scott: Surge is the Pepsi drink.

986
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,710
Scott: It was everywhere at school.

987
01:00:51,112 --> 01:00:53,910
Scott: And then when Coke came in, all the surge was gone.

988
01:00:56,216 --> 01:00:56,890
Scott: That's what happened.

989
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:10,988
Rym: But the other place I remember vending machines in my childhood being very prominent were specifically when we went to amusement parks like Cedar Point, because I remember one year all these vending machines appeared all over the park and it was like Pepsi branded deal.

990
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:21,170
Rym: And those vending machines were way expensive, but they were way cheaper than getting soda pop from the fountains at the actual like restaurant stalls.

991
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:28,388
Rym: And as a result, our family would like get 20 ounce things a pop from the vending machines before we got in line for rides.

992
01:01:30,794 --> 01:01:37,130
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's you know, I think also when I was a kid, it's like there were only basically three kinds of vending machines.

993
01:01:37,451 --> 01:01:39,350
Scott: There was the snack one with the coils.

994
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:40,449
Scott: You still see those around.

995
01:01:41,271 --> 01:01:44,090
Scott: And the coil spins in the food and there's different snacks to choose from.

996
01:01:44,412 --> 01:01:46,510
Rym: We got some anecdotes from RIT about those.

997
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:48,190
Scott: The big ones are at the bottom.

998
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:54,225
Scott: You had the soda can one, which got later got upgraded later in life to the bottle one, like in the in the late 90s.

999
01:01:54,690 --> 01:02:02,590
Rym: Yeah, right around when Americans as they kept drinking more and more soda, we went from the 12 ounce can being the default to the 20 ounce being the default.

1000
01:02:03,491 --> 01:02:11,070
Scott: And the third kind of vending machine that thankfully is no more, at least not in the US, was the cigarette vending machine.

1001
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:14,840
Rym: I remember there was a cigarette vending machine in every fucking restaurant I went to as a kid.

1002
01:02:15,352 --> 01:02:19,910
Scott: There was a fucking restaurant had one of those things and now they're all gone because they had a particular shape.

1003
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:22,049
Rym: They worked differently from the other vending machines.

1004
01:02:22,778 --> 01:02:22,989
Scott: Yep.

1005
01:02:23,433 --> 01:02:24,930
Scott: It was like a plunger or some shit.

1006
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:25,210
Scott: Right.

1007
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:27,369
Scott: And I remember as a kid, I was always I didn't know how to use one.

1008
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,510
Scott: I never used one myself.

1009
01:02:28,731 --> 01:02:35,689
Rym: Well, that same plunger mechanism is what most laundromats use, but I never encountered a laundromat in my life until college.

1010
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:36,908
Scott: Yep.

1011
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:39,970
Scott: So those are like the three kinds.

1012
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:44,270
Scott: But then I guess in the 2000s and going forward, right, I guess other countries.

1013
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:48,170
Rym: Well, there were things we didn't think of as vending machines that maybe don't count here.

1014
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:51,870
Rym: Like I wouldn't say the thing you used to pay for parking in a parking garage counts.

1015
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:55,530
Rym: That's a different even though it's there's no person to be a vending machine.

1016
01:02:55,751 --> 01:03:02,730
Scott: It's you had to put money in some kind of payment mechanism and then it has to dispense a good, right?

1017
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:09,750
Scott: Not a service or an actual good has to be in the machine and the machine dispenses the good to you.

1018
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:10,566
Scott: Like, here you go.

1019
01:03:11,612 --> 01:03:14,368
Scott: It's like you're paying for parking or an ATM.

1020
01:03:14,871 --> 01:03:16,229
Scott: An ATM is not a vending machine.

1021
01:03:16,632 --> 01:03:17,810
Rym: I guess I'd follow that.

1022
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,266
Scott: You're not buying the money.

1023
01:03:21,092 --> 01:03:27,030
Rym: So then the other vending machines I knew about as a kid were and these are gone now newspaper vending machines.

1024
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:33,930
Scott: I would often throw a quarter into a newspaper vending machine, open a door and on your good faith, you don't take all the newspapers.

1025
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:39,988
Rym: And weirdly, very rarely did someone just open it for a quarter and take all the newspapers because what are you going to do?

1026
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:40,744
Rym: Sell them?

1027
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,806
Scott: Like, yeah, they're not worth anything tomorrow.

1028
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:50,730
Rym: Yeah, but I also remember as a kid, those cigarette vending machines bother me because I hated cigarettes.

1029
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:51,790
Rym: I hated cigarette smoke.

1030
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:59,730
Rym: And I just remember asking my mom when I was really young, how do they check that you're an adult if you use the cigarette vending machine?

1031
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:01,389
Rym: And my answer was they don't.

1032
01:04:01,511 --> 01:04:02,450
Rym: They should be banned.

1033
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:03,690
Rym: And I was like, oh, that's right.

1034
01:04:04,911 --> 01:04:06,850
Scott: That's why they were bad eventually.

1035
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:07,432
Scott: Oh, there was.

1036
01:04:07,613 --> 01:04:15,530
Scott: actually there was another kind of vending machine that I forgot about, which is the because, you know, they're different shape and size, which is the candy and toy kinds, right?

1037
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:20,469
Scott: Where you put the corduroy in, you turn it and then either you gumball, basically gumball machine.

1038
01:04:20,631 --> 01:04:22,770
Scott: But, you know, then you got toys and balls, right?

1039
01:04:23,271 --> 01:04:25,769
Scott: Which I guess in other countries are much better than the ones we have.

1040
01:04:26,073 --> 01:04:26,989
Scott: We have really crappy ones.

1041
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:30,469
Rym: I remember we would get a homie every other time we went to Wegmans at RIT.

1042
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:32,609
Scott: Homies were a thing.

1043
01:04:33,311 --> 01:04:37,167
Scott: Yeah, I guess the homies didn't make enough money to carry on.

1044
01:04:37,448 --> 01:04:37,850
Rym: as a kid.

1045
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:40,270
Rym: I was really into garbage here.

1046
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:42,050
Rym: Candy from candy vending machines.

1047
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:42,950
Rym: I don't know why.

1048
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:43,589
Rym: Kid brain.

1049
01:04:45,752 --> 01:04:48,049
Scott: Yeah, no, I was not a fan of the vending.

1050
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:54,950
Scott: Like when I saw the candy vending machine that had like especially the one with like all the sort of different fruit, like the bananas and that was disgusting.

1051
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,629
Rym: That was the worst possible candy.

1052
01:04:56,870 --> 01:05:02,309
Scott: It's like I never ate it and I never had a desire to eat it like, you know, one gumball right.

1053
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:05,342
Scott: Well, the ones I would get, for whatever reason.

1054
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,150
Rym: as a kid, I like chiclets a lot.

1055
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:10,970
Rym: So I would get chiclets out of the chiclet vending machine like all the time.

1056
01:05:11,031 --> 01:05:11,329
Scott: I don't know.

1057
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:13,770
Scott: I would just buy chiclets in a package of chiclets.

1058
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:17,063
Rym: Now I go to the vending machine, you pop a quarter in and a handful of chiclets would come out.

1059
01:05:18,195 --> 01:05:18,909
Scott: I would not do that.

1060
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:19,850
Scott: That is what I did.

1061
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:21,730
Scott: I would buy chiclets in the checkout aisle.

1062
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:26,970
Rym: I mean, I was doing this like when I was like at the DMV with my parents.

1063
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:32,249
Rym: So I guess the Secretary of State, because it was Michigan, there'd be a chiclet vending machine and I would go get some chiclets.

1064
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:33,307
Rym: Like that was the thing.

1065
01:05:37,152 --> 01:05:42,803
Rym: So college is when vending machines actually became weirdly more important to me, which was partly that was the first time in our lives.

1066
01:05:42,863 --> 01:05:46,769
Rym: we were just completely independent, like just completely out of our own recognizance.

1067
01:05:47,254 --> 01:05:48,289
Rym: So we'd often stay out late.

1068
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:51,070
Rym: And you know, RIT is not in Rochester.

1069
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:53,910
Rym: It's actually in this small town called Henrietta.

1070
01:05:54,671 --> 01:06:00,669
Rym: So if it's after midnight there, especially back then when we were there, the campus is a lot bigger and more happening now.

1071
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:02,190
Rym: There was nothing.

1072
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:12,010
Rym: If you were hungry, if you were thirsty, there was no possible way to get anything unless you were willing to order a Papa John's pizza.

1073
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:13,078
Rym: They delivered until 2

1074
01:06:13,078 --> 01:06:13,341
Rym: a.m.,

1075
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:14,169
Rym: right?

1076
01:06:14,492 --> 01:06:16,310
Scott: Or you had a car and you could go to Wegmans.

1077
01:06:16,612 --> 01:06:16,680
Scott: Yep.

1078
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,770
Scott: So as a result, you weren't going to walk to Wegmans.

1079
01:06:20,431 --> 01:06:26,388
Rym: Also, I was deeply poor in college, so I had a lot of food just directly out of vending machines.

1080
01:06:26,931 --> 01:06:33,050
Scott: Also, RIT, we had these cards, right, with like college money, you know, which is now.

1081
01:06:33,171 --> 01:06:35,430
Scott: everyone has Apple Pay or, you know, whatnot.

1082
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:38,110
Scott: But back in those days, that wasn't a thing, really.

1083
01:06:39,052 --> 01:06:40,670
Rym: Here, buy some Michigan Scratchy dollars.

1084
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:44,670
Rym: They're just less useful than regular dollars, but you didn't pay for them directly.

1085
01:06:45,053 --> 01:06:46,590
Rym: They kind of came out of your student loan.

1086
01:06:47,332 --> 01:06:49,868
Rym: You're probably paying interest on that shit, but don't think about it.

1087
01:06:50,790 --> 01:07:00,310
Scott: Yeah, but RIT, it's like every student just had like this digital money on their student ID and they could swipe it and buy things right at food places and other places around campus.

1088
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:05,250
Scott: So, you know, it's like sort of ahead of its time, but it was a closed network, right?

1089
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:07,490
Scott: That money wasn't good anywhere else, really.

1090
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:14,409
Rym: Yeah, but I many times was hungry enough to basically assemble a meal via a couple of vending machines.

1091
01:07:17,192 --> 01:07:21,590
Rym: And once I left college, honestly, I don't use vending machines at all for anything ever.

1092
01:07:22,632 --> 01:07:25,030
Scott: I use them on rare occasion, right?

1093
01:07:25,573 --> 01:07:26,930
Rym: They're a tool of desperation.

1094
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:30,390
Scott: But yeah, I can say they're also positioned.

1095
01:07:30,692 --> 01:07:33,530
Scott: They're intentionally positioned for desperation, right?

1096
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:39,570
Scott: It's like nobody puts, you know, a vending machine in a place where there's like a bunch of stores right there.

1097
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,589
Scott: It's like, you know, why would I do that?

1098
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:42,502
Scott: Just go with that.

1099
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:45,709
Rym: But I see vending machines like that all the time.

1100
01:07:47,011 --> 01:07:51,410
Rym: Especially outside of the US, like fancy train station with fantastic food in London.

1101
01:07:52,351 --> 01:07:55,690
Rym: There will be a wall of vending machines that just has shittier food.

1102
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:56,727
Rym: That's not actually cheaper.

1103
01:07:58,072 --> 01:08:00,910
Scott: No, I don't know why I see vending machines.

1104
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:07,210
Scott: The most is places that are like inconveniently far from other places.

1105
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:07,314
Scott: Yeah.

1106
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:15,710
Rym: So like a truck stop, a rest stop that doesn't have an indoor area on a highway or like, you know, a motel, right?

1107
01:08:16,111 --> 01:08:25,250
Scott: The motel doesn't have food or the kitchen or the kitchen that it has isn't open all the time and the nearest food is like not close.

1108
01:08:25,609 --> 01:08:37,050
Rym: You just gave me a flashback to being a kid and sneaking out of our hotel room at Cedar Point in the middle of the night because I was hungry, finding a vending machine on the floor next to the ice machine and getting a bunch of snacks without my parents permission.

1109
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:39,788
Rym: My mom is watching the stream right now, so now she knows.

1110
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:43,290
Scott: It's like they'll have a vending machine there and it's like, there you go.

1111
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:51,688
Scott: Now you have if you really need a food or a water or whatever it is, it's like it is available for you to buy money.

1112
01:08:52,331 --> 01:08:54,149
Rym: What I'm noticing is interesting for myself.

1113
01:08:54,270 --> 01:09:02,229
Rym: Just talking through this is that with other ways to avoid talking to a person like I don't need to talk to a human to buy groceries.

1114
01:09:02,412 --> 01:09:04,330
Rym: So I like just ordering stuff online.

1115
01:09:04,872 --> 01:09:07,490
Rym: But with vending machines, it's actually not.

1116
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,290
Rym: I'm trying to avoid interacting with a human.

1117
01:09:09,731 --> 01:09:15,550
Rym: It's more I am desperate and vending machines are a tool that can exist in desperate places.

1118
01:09:16,332 --> 01:09:17,769
Scott: Yeah, I need a thing.

1119
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:28,689
Scott: I'm in a I need the thing now and I'm in a place and the place I am in is far away from anywhere that I could conveniently acquire the thing the normal way of acquiring it.

1120
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:31,210
Scott: And here it is right here.

1121
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:37,749
Scott: It's just in a box and I can make it spit out the thing if I either hack the box, break the box open or put money in.

1122
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:48,630
Rym: The last two times I tried to use a vending machine in any capacity, both failed and they were both at a PAX East.

1123
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:54,067
Rym: The PAX East before Covid and the PAX East before the PAX East before Covid at both of those faxes.

1124
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:57,590
Rym: I have clear memories of we're playing games in tabletop.

1125
01:09:58,255 --> 01:09:59,330
Rym: I'm really thirsty.

1126
01:10:00,472 --> 01:10:03,310
Rym: I didn't have a water bottle with me or I'm tired.

1127
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:09,790
Rym: I wanted some sugar and I instead of walking all the way out of the convention center, I walked all the way to the edge near the bathroom.

1128
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:14,249
Rym: So there's vending machines were just to get something, some sort of energy drink, don't even care what.

1129
01:10:14,931 --> 01:10:18,970
Rym: And every one of them was nonfunctional or out of beverages.

1130
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:21,530
Rym: And I failed and I walked back empty handed.

1131
01:10:22,991 --> 01:10:29,968
Scott: Yeah, I mean, so places I've used or attempted to use vending machines in recent memory at the top of Bear Mountain, right?

1132
01:10:32,174 --> 01:10:33,449
Scott: There's a vending machine up there.

1133
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:35,690
Rym: I know exactly what vending machine you're talking about.

1134
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:39,310
Scott: I think there's just vending machines up there on the top of this mountain.

1135
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,730
Scott: There's no commerce.

1136
01:10:40,873 --> 01:10:41,629
Scott: What to speak of?

1137
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:42,710
Scott: You're on the top of a mountain.

1138
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:51,710
Scott: The closest place you could get any food or water is, I guess there's bathrooms up there, but it's like there is a trail that goes down to go all the way back down the mountain.

1139
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:53,630
Scott: So there's a trail you can hike down.

1140
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:59,770
Rym: It's an extremely steep trail, but it goes straight down the mountain and it ends near a small town that does have some restaurants.

1141
01:11:00,113 --> 01:11:01,190
Rym: Not going to help you on a bike, though.

1142
01:11:01,794 --> 01:11:02,710
Rym: It's not even mountain bike.

1143
01:11:03,673 --> 01:11:05,390
Scott: Or like you go to the town park, right?

1144
01:11:06,313 --> 01:11:08,110
Scott: It's like it could be a big ass part.

1145
01:11:08,632 --> 01:11:11,630
Scott: And it's like everyone's hanging out there in the middle of a grassy field.

1146
01:11:11,771 --> 01:11:16,110
Scott: It's like, oh, we didn't bring food with us or I forgot a food or whatever.

1147
01:11:16,892 --> 01:11:18,150
Scott: Or I'm only here for a short.

1148
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:29,150
Scott: I'm walking through, but it's like this, you know, there's no restaurant in the middle of the park or the, you know, the other thing is that like a vending machine doesn't just extend over distance.

1149
01:11:29,973 --> 01:11:32,550
Scott: It also extends over time, right?

1150
01:11:32,891 --> 01:11:39,370
Scott: So consider a place where, you know, you know, hey, there's this road, right?

1151
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:47,430
Scott: It's like if you tried to open up a restaurant on that road, it's like you need a certain number of customers per day to stay in business with the restaurant, right?

1152
01:11:47,632 --> 01:11:47,786
Scott: Yeah.

1153
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:56,070
Scott: The vending machine, even if it might take a year for the vending machine to sell out, but it's like it doesn't fucking matter.

1154
01:11:56,510 --> 01:12:03,089
Rym: The only thing you're racing against is the expiration dates of the things in there, which reminds me, I remember as if you even care about that.

1155
01:12:03,272 --> 01:12:03,361
Scott: Yeah.

1156
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:08,289
Rym: It's like if you're desperate, you're at a vending machine, you're already in a desperation mode, right?

1157
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:14,110
Scott: It's like the cost to maintain the vending machine and the electricity is like, it's like the cost is so low.

1158
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:24,750
Scott: It's like, yeah, you probably don't want to put one in somewhere where you're only refilling it once a year, but the, you can put it in a place with a lot less foot traffic.

1159
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:27,510
Scott: And in fact, that's the better place you're going to want to put it right.

1160
01:12:27,851 --> 01:12:33,290
Scott: Enough foot traffic, but not too much because if it's a place with a lot of foot traffic, people don't use the vending machine.

1161
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:34,670
Scott: They use something else instead.

1162
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:35,492
Scott: We also do

1163
01:12:35,512 --> 01:12:41,042
Rym: have the privilege of having enough money to like, we are now we're rarely in the situations where we would even need a vending machine, but

1164
01:12:41,062 --> 01:12:52,370
Scott: you can make goods and serve goods available in a place where it would be otherwise unfeasible commercially to make those goods available because the population is too low.

1165
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:55,889
Rym: Some of them are also basically lottery tickets for the people who own them or ads.

1166
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:59,564
Rym: Like in airports, there's the vending machines like, Hey, Xbox 360 here, 300 bucks.

1167
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:02,110
Rym: Swipe your credit card.

1168
01:13:02,212 --> 01:13:02,969
Rym: Like those exist.

1169
01:13:03,574 --> 01:13:04,750
Rym: Those are usually just silly.

1170
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:21,469
Rym: But also if even one person buys one, but, uh, yeah, in terms of like, I really don't try to imagine when I would use a vending machine again, because especially the one use that I have is desperation at packs and they actually failed me.

1171
01:13:22,972 --> 01:13:24,982
Scott: I think the one, the other time I might use one.

1172
01:13:25,042 --> 01:13:31,490
Scott: besides, you know, the remote location scenario, uh, is the special location scenario.

1173
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:32,004
Scott: Right?

1174
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:37,070
Rym: So let's say, like captive audience in a shitty airport already behind security.

1175
01:13:37,152 --> 01:13:38,008
Rym: And that's the only thing.

1176
01:13:39,297 --> 01:13:39,769
Scott: Well, yeah.

1177
01:13:39,891 --> 01:13:41,670
Scott: So like in an airport, for example, right.

1178
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:45,770
Scott: You do see those like, uh, vending machines that have like small electronics in them.

1179
01:13:45,936 --> 01:13:46,170
Scott: Right.

1180
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:54,150
Rym: And it's like, if my etymotic died and I was on a long trip, I would consider just getting some sort of noise canceling headphone from that vending machine.

1181
01:13:54,952 --> 01:13:55,110
Scott: Exactly.

1182
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,770
Scott: But another, another scenario, right?

1183
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:59,550
Scott: You go to a bowling alley and they have a vending machine.

1184
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:05,069
Scott: It's the spirally one, the normal, but instead of snacks, it's filled up with bowling specific needs.

1185
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:05,710
Scott: Right.

1186
01:14:06,091 --> 01:14:15,909
Scott: And if you're bowling a lot, you're going to use that vending machine at least once sometime, you know, you go to, uh, don't really have that skiers or it's just have like staffed places.

1187
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:20,910
Scott: Yeah, but laundromats, they have one that spits out detergents.

1188
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:23,730
Scott: And other things, you know, dryer sheets, things of that nature.

1189
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:32,290
Rym: Yeah, but you're being rough because I have never seen a laundromat detergent dispenser that had any type of detergent I would consider using on my own clothes.

1190
01:14:34,454 --> 01:14:35,729
Scott: I mean, sure, but yeah.

1191
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:41,470
Rym: But also, like I said, I literally never saw a laundromat in person until I went to college.

1192
01:14:42,473 --> 01:14:43,809
Scott: No, I mean, I saw them.

1193
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:44,870
Rym: I saw them on TV.

1194
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:48,250
Rym: I didn't, I saw them on Seinfeld and in movies, but in real life.

1195
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:54,229
Scott: A few times, like if we had to watch something really big or whatever, but you know, or the washing machine was broken.

1196
01:14:56,612 --> 01:14:58,928
Rym: And then I guess in RIT, we had the washer, but not the dryer.

1197
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:02,430
Scott: Well, you mean in college, a beacon.

1198
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:07,409
Rym: In RIT, I had, I barely had enough money to use the washing machines, which was its own problem.

1199
01:15:08,831 --> 01:15:14,710
Scott: But the point is, is that there are, there are certain kinds of businesses that will take some of their products, right.

1200
01:15:15,033 --> 01:15:16,849
Scott: And put them into a vending machine.

1201
01:15:17,518 --> 01:15:17,750
Scott: Right.

1202
01:15:17,951 --> 01:15:24,750
Scott: So like I've seen, for example, like nerdy stores will put all of their like collectible cards into a vending machine.

1203
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:27,930
Scott: So it's like, yeah, you know, everything else that we sell, right.

1204
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,530
Scott: You know, board games, paintball guns, whatever.

1205
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:31,529
Scott: We just sell normally.

1206
01:15:32,172 --> 01:15:34,649
Scott: But if you want to buy Pokémon cards, they're in the vending machine.

1207
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:38,049
Rym: Partly because now your cashier doesn't have to deal with the punk kids.

1208
01:15:38,532 --> 01:15:39,749
Rym: They'll just deal with it on their own.

1209
01:15:40,151 --> 01:15:45,450
Rym: So it basically reduces your labor because the kids are going to buy the same number of Pokémon cards no matter how they do it.

1210
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:46,829
Scott: Mm hmm.

1211
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:53,230
Rym: Though I will say outside, like in the US, most vending machines are pretty shady.

1212
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:55,509
Scott: Like part of it is a weed vending machines.

1213
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:55,805
Rym: Yeah.

1214
01:15:56,111 --> 01:16:01,969
Rym: I've seen, I've also seen some vending machines that I think were forgotten, especially mechanical vending machines.

1215
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:13,547
Rym: I remember several years ago, I encountered in the city, in the lobby of a building, a vending machine that had gumballs in it that looked like they had all faded to white over decades of sunlight.

1216
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:15,930
Rym: Completely mechanical.

1217
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:22,789
Rym: I am confident that vending machine is forgotten and woe betide anyone who puts anything in that vending machine in their mouth.

1218
01:16:27,112 --> 01:16:30,330
Rym: I think that was enough of an excuse to have a main bit for a show.

1219
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:31,343
Rym: We can stop right there.

1220
01:16:35,232 --> 01:16:37,350
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1221
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:42,510
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1222
01:16:42,871 --> 01:16:47,910
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1223
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:50,830
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1224
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:55,590
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1226
01:17:00,410 --> 01:17:03,430
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1227
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:06,530
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1228
01:17:07,671 --> 01:17:17,350
Rym: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Link Egee, Dre, Lily Terrebray, a bunch of people who rarely don't want me to say their names.

1229
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:28,910
Rym: Chris the Dog, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Dex, Finn, Kishaya85, Rebecca Dunn, Review Madbull34cowards, Sam Erickson, Shervin von Horl, Stop All the Downloading, Taylor Braun.

1230
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:34,868
Rym: The next station is Wilson, Wilson Station and several people whose names I will not say.

1231
01:17:35,593 --> 01:17:40,210
Rym: I will say that as much as unscripted content is probably going to destroy the ecosystem.

1232
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:49,430
Rym: just like 90s reality TV destroyed TV, I also think that Taskmaster, which is an unscripted show, is actually pretty funny and I do watch it on occasion.

1233
01:17:49,812 --> 01:17:51,388
Rym: So make of that what you will.

1234
01:17:51,890 --> 01:18:11,620
Rym: But for now, I simply leave you with... This is where I make potato canishes.

1235
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:23,750
Rym: The magic and the mystery of potato canishes.

1236
01:18:26,971 --> 01:18:28,429
Rym: Little black squash balls.

1237
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:32,108
Rym: This machine creates little black squash balls.

1238
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:36,750
Rym: It means potato pancakes.

1239
01:18:38,357 --> 01:18:40,330
Rym: Little black squash balls.

1240
01:18:41,741 --> 01:18:44,389
Rym: This is where I make centipedes.

1241
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,890
Rym: I sure love to make centipedes.

1242
01:18:50,861 --> 01:18:55,459
Rym: I turn little black worms into centipedes.

1243
01:18:58,062 --> 01:19:02,178
Rym: I turn little black worms into centipedes.
