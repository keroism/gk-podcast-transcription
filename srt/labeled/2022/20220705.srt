1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,829
Rym: It's Tuesday, July 5th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:10,110
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:13,516
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,924
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,944 --> 00:00:19,680
Rym: Tonight we are talking about streaming games to devices, not like on Twitch.

6
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:22,217
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:30,740
Rym: So, uh, there won't be any GeekNights next week because, uh, at least me and a bunch of our friends are just going to the beach.

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,240
Rym: Private beach house.

9
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:38,340
Scott: I would be going to the beach, but next week, uh, you know, I haven't, I haven't worked for the past, uh, month.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,690
Rym: Oh, I am, I am well aware.

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,860
Rym: I think you have pointed out that you are not working.

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,200
Rym: Literally every time I've interacted with you via any medium for this entire period.

13
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,580
Rym: And I can't blame you because I would do the same.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,087
Scott: Uh, tomorrow I'm going to the beach.

15
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:55,194
Scott: Just, well, who's going to stop me?

16
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:56,860
Scott: I have a job to go to.

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,336
Scott: Tomorrow looks like a good beach day too.

18
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:03,860
Scott: Uh, so I'm just going to wake my ass up early and go to the beach tomorrow all day.

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:10,980
Scott: Uh, but, uh, other than that, yeah, next week, starting Monday, uh, my new job will begin.

20
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:13,299
Scott: So I guess I'm not going to go to the beach then.

21
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:21,500
Scott: Uh, however, on Friday next week, I won't be working or the Friday after that or the Friday after that.

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,000
Scott: Because, uh, that's the only reason I really accepted this job is because I'm never going to work on Friday.

23
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:27,678
Scott: That's what they said.

24
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:34,280
Rym: So... You know, like you said before, it's a situation where that's what you wanted.

25
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,397
Rym: Like, you can't say no to an offer like that if someone's like, "Here is exactly what you asked for.

26
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:38,799
Rym: We'll do

27
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:38,879
Rym: it.".

28
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:39,980
Rym: Like, all right.

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,132
Scott: Yeah, it's like, imagine going to negotiate with someone.

30
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:45,879
Scott: and they're like, "All right, what do you

31
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:46,100
Scott: want?".

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:53,158
Scott: And I'm like, "I will sell you this ballpoint pen for one billion

33
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:53,760
Scott: dollars.".

34
00:01:53,842 --> 00:01:54,313
Scott: They're like, "All

35
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:54,477
Scott: right.".

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,453
Scott: You're like, "Uh, what,

37
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:55,717
Scott: what?".

38
00:01:56,161 --> 00:02:00,019
Scott: I was like, "Uh, I guess I'm giving you the ballpoint

39
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:00,280
Scott: pen.".

40
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,339
Scott: It's like, I didn't want to give it to you.

41
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:04,680
Scott: That's why I said some ridiculous number.

42
00:02:05,363 --> 00:02:06,320
Scott: I kind of need the pen.

43
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,060
Scott: It's my last pen, but I was planning to just walk away from this conversation with pen in hand.

44
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,059
Rym: Well, just like recruiters.

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,500
Scott: But you said yes to the billion.

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,100
Scott: So I guess I can't change my mind now.

47
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:18,709
Scott: I already...

48
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,700
Rym: Yeah, like recruiters bother me all the time.

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,455
Rym: So I usually give some like, "Eh, my minimum salary is like 500

50
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:24,857
Rym: grand.".

51
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,939
Rym: I just say something to make them go away.

52
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:30,554
Rym: But if someone says, "All right, let's keep

53
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:30,917
Rym: talking."

54
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:35,720
Rym: I do keep talking to them at least a little bit further until I find out what evil shit they're up to.

55
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:37,440
Rym: And then I tell them to pound sand.

56
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:45,319
Scott: But meanwhile, I turned off all LinkedIn settings to like, "I have a job, don't leave me

57
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:45,620
Scott: alone.".

58
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,899
Rym: I have never changed my LinkedIn away from, "Don't bother

59
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:50,040
Rym: me.".

60
00:02:50,243 --> 00:02:50,920
Rym: It's never mattered.

61
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,959
Rym: It's never changed anything.

62
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:57,639
Scott: Or before I even went to day one at the new job, I've already got two recruiters.

63
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:00,279
Scott: They stopped for a little while, like a couple of weeks.

64
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:02,693
Scott: I already got two, like,

65
00:03:02,713 --> 00:03:02,895
Scott: "Hey.".

66
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:11,578
Scott: But at least now I have a new line for recruiters, which is, now when I go and I'm like, "You know, I'd really like to work four days a

67
00:03:11,618 --> 00:03:11,819
Scott: week.".

68
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,060
Rym: Now, daddy three.

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,760
Scott: I really like to work three days a week.

70
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,300
Scott: That's right.

71
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:15,656
Scott: Three?

72
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,936
Scott: Well, I already work... Anytime a recruiter talks to me, I go back, "Look, can I work three days a

73
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:21,157
Scott: week?".

74
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:23,659
Scott: I'd be like, "Right now, I work four.

75
00:03:25,186 --> 00:03:26,019
Scott: I work four now.

76
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,559
Scott: My current job, four.

77
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:29,299
Scott: So you want to pull me away?

78
00:03:29,804 --> 00:03:30,019
Scott: Three.

79
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,171
Scott: Three days a

80
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:31,395
Scott: week.".

81
00:03:31,886 --> 00:03:32,339
Rym: Some advice.

82
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,919
Rym: If you have a perk like that or a high enough salary, usually you don't want to tell a company that you're talking to to apply to.

83
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,080
Scott: No, I'd never tell them the money.

84
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,920
Scott: I would never tell them a number ever.

85
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:51,760
Scott: When people ask about money, the line I've been using that has worked well is, "I live in a New York City apartment.

86
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,552
Scott: I can see the skyline out the

87
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,137
Scott: window.".

88
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:54,698
Scott: Right?

89
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,599
Scott: You figure it out how much money I need.

90
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,138
Rym: Usually what I say lately is, "X is my minimum salary to have a

91
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:03,860
Rym: conversation.".

92
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,700
Rym: Like if it's not that, that's the bare minimum I would accept.

93
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,799
Rym: If that is not even on the table, like let's just end this right now.

94
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:12,940
Scott: I don't like to tell a number.

95
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,480
Rym: Well, I make that number pretty high.

96
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,959
Scott: Yeah, but you can get into trouble, right?

97
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:21,259
Scott: If their number was like way, way, way higher than that.

98
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,993
Rym: Yeah, but that number is high enough to where.

99
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,536
Rym: if it was higher than that, it actually wouldn't affect me.

100
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,480
Scott: Well, consider this, right?

101
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:43,620
Scott: Let's pretend that in a different universe where I had been better at school, and instead of playing battle tech in the basement, I studied more computer science.

102
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:44,960
Rym: Yeah, miserable life.

103
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:54,599
Scott: And at the time at college where we graduated, and there were like those little Google quizzes lying around in the cafe at the college, right?

104
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:06,280
Scott: And I had actually been able to do that little Google quiz, and I had gotten a job at Google as a computer programmer of some kind or software engineer in the year 2005.

105
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:17,100
Scott: And let's pretend that I had stayed at Google from the year 2005 to the year 2022, and for some reason never quit, even though there were many occasions on which my morality would have forced me to quit.

106
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:30,659
Scott: Putting all that aside, if that universe happened, by all information I have available, you would be making six to eight hundred K probably right now.

107
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,479
Scott: You're way off.

108
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:33,658
Scott: Well, you're way off.

109
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,960
Scott: No, the numbers that I have seen suggest that if you are a software engineer at Google, with how many years is that?

110
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,499
Scott: Seventeen years.

111
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,000
Rym: Oh, yeah, I guess seventeen.

112
00:05:45,422 --> 00:05:54,200
Scott: God, with seventeen years of tenure, I would be making one point seven or eight million dollars a year.

113
00:05:55,301 --> 00:06:03,560
Rym: Yeah, I did realize I recently was looking at what the actual compensation structure is for companies like Amazon and Google for some comparative research.

114
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,020
Rym: And yeah, it's like a product manager.

115
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:15,139
Rym: Like what I do now, that equivalent of those kinds of companies pays between seven hundred and twenty two point one million.

116
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,980
Rym: But anyway, it's gaming day and you're going to the beach tomorrow and I'm going to be next week.

117
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,419
Rym: So today and most likely Thursday will be the last episodes of GeekNights for a little bit.

118
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:41,820
Scott: So it's got to get situated a new job until we'll be able to do a lot of GeekNights starting to, you know, a few weeks from now to two weeks away, because, you know, I think it is pretty much going to be back to normal.

119
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:44,280
Rym: We're past all the known disruptions.

120
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:48,300
Rym: So in the news, I know I can't ignore it.

121
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,800
Rym: Got to talk about it at least briefly.

122
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,400
Rym: But there were several mass shootings in America over the weekend.

123
00:06:55,681 --> 00:07:03,900
Rym: But one of them was extremely, you know, crazy white right wing Nazi in sell a guy with a sniper rifle, basically.

124
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:10,080
Rym: But the news I have, because the real news will talk about all that in detail.

125
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:16,106
Rym: And if you really want to know the details, even though it's not going to affect your life that much, you can go read about it.

126
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:27,224
Rym: But the news I have is that we're in sort of an interesting situation now as people who live in America, in that our Supreme Court, as you may know, has basically

127
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:27,746
Scott: ended

128
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:36,086
Rym: New York State's gun laws, the laws that are the primary reason there's very few gun deaths in the state compared to like every other state that doesn't have these laws.

129
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,558
Rym: And the Supreme Court just ended them all.

130
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:39,870
Rym: So what New York?

131
00:07:40,132 --> 00:07:41,099
Scott: just some of them.

132
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,088
Rym: Well, it ended the big one.

133
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:46,966
Rym: So they basically said you got to give anyone who wants to carry a handgun the right to carry a handgun.

134
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:50,079
Rym: You can't require them to have a good reason to have one.

135
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,199
Scott: So what do you think has to be a certain kind of reason?

136
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,252
Rym: You're generalizing dramatically.

137
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:58,540
Scott: It's a very specific thing.

138
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,467
Rym: You cannot require any reason now.

139
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:06,710
Rym: You must give a permit unless there is a specific item on an enumerated list.

140
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,580
Rym: that means you should not give that person.

141
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:10,909
Rym: It's permissive as opposed to restrictive.

142
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:13,239
Rym: is basically how this is going to shake down.

143
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:37,744
Rym: New York responded by rapidly passing a law and we're going to have a referendum and a state constitution amendment basically adding a million new gun restrictions to basically prevent the outcomes of the Supreme Court decision and go even further, like some of the biggest gun restrictions the state has ever passed and basically daring red states and the Supreme Court to do anything about it.

144
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:44,283
Rym: New Jersey now, I think this news is today, basically is now doing the exact same thing.

145
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:54,160
Rym: And we're seeing a wave where all the blue states are now passing massive new gun controls because it's literally impossible to do anything at the federal level.

146
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:12,929
Rym: And we're getting to a situation, it's not a civil war, but it's something that I've seen a lot of people referring to as a cold civil war in that we're going to see very likely over the next decade in America a radical divergence between the laws in blue states versus the laws in red states and it's just going to keep escalating.

147
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:14,216
Scott: That's what Republicans wanted.

148
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:15,763
Scott: They kept yelling about states rights.

149
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:23,753
Scott: It's like, you know, that's what they wanted since the actual civil war, right, is, you know, they weren't the Confederates for all of their evil ways.

150
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:27,666
Scott: They weren't trying to conquer the union, right?

151
00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:32,400
Rym: They just wanted their, their particularly awful practice.

152
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:41,504
Scott: They would have been happy to keep being evil slaveholding people down South and let the North do whatever the North was going to do.

153
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:53,334
Scott: So today those same people are perfectly happy to, you know, let, right, you know, where they live, do that their way.

154
00:09:53,434 --> 00:09:56,742
Scott: And then, you know, where we live, do our way.

155
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:03,546
Scott: But of course, if they have the opportunity to make someone else do their way, right, they'll do that too.

156
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:19,759
Rym: Well, I mean, it's actually, it's a little simplistic because they did aggressively force Northern states and non slaveholding states to protect slave rights and they actually aggressively, you know, bleeding Kansas and all the skirmishes.

157
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:23,899
Scott: Well, yeah, they wanted, right, they wanted us to return slaves that had to run away from them.

158
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,779
Rym: Well, they also wanted to make sure that every new state was a slave state.

159
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:34,044
Rym: And there's lots of other stuff going on, but basically because Reconstruction failed, that never ended.

160
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:35,229
Rym: And here we are again.

161
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:44,565
Rym: We've got all the blue states banding together to pass massive gun restrictions, massive abortion protections, birth control protections, gay marriage protections, everything.

162
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:49,946
Rym: Meanwhile, red states are aggressively doing the exact opposite as fast as possible.

163
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:55,604
Rym: And they're going to try to use the Supreme Court to undo all these new laws that the blue states are passing.

164
00:10:56,406 --> 00:11:13,283
Rym: And all I want to say is pay attention to the first time one of these blue states or one of these compacts of blue states refuses to follow one of these things that the Supreme Court does, because at that moment, America is on a very different trajectory.

165
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,917
Scott: Well, you know, the Supreme Court has been refused before.

166
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:17,338
Scott: It has.

167
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:24,032
Rym: And here's hoping that we can fix the Supreme Court in some fashion.

168
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:30,120
Rym: But to get away from that into gaming news, because it is Tuesday and we skipped a few gig nights and everything.

169
00:11:30,543 --> 00:11:32,800
Rym: I saw you were playing a game called Nobody Saves the World.

170
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:33,902
Scott: Yeah.

171
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:39,225
Scott: You know, there's a steam sale going on right now because it's, you know, the holiday in the United States.

172
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:42,521
Scott: If you're in another country, I don't know if it's a holiday for you, Canada.

173
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:43,788
Scott: Your holiday is pretty close.

174
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,235
Scott: Like, it's July 1st, right?

175
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:46,280
Scott: Canada Day, whatever.

176
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:48,347
Scott: I think I might be wrong on that.

177
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,780
Scott: But anyway, so steam has to be a big summer sale around now.

178
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:53,605
Scott: And I didn't have to go to work.

179
00:11:54,106 --> 00:12:03,399
Scott: So given that, you know, it wasn't a day to go to the beach, I bought a steam game and, you know, followed my policy of buy, install, immediately play.

180
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:03,760
Scott: Right.

181
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:07,157
Scott: So I saw this game on there called Nobody Saves the World.

182
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:13,380
Scott: And I said, that looks like a little, you know, sort of Robotron shooty action RPG kind of deal.

183
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:14,926
Scott: And it's highly rated.

184
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:18,921
Scott: And I watched a little video for a second and I'm like, all right, looks cute.

185
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:22,009
Scott: I'll try that for, you know, $20 out of $25 total.

186
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:22,390
Scott: And I tried it.

187
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:33,864
Scott: And sure enough, it's an action RPG, you know, game where you level up, you know, you kill guys, they drop gold, you pick it up, right?

188
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:39,162
Scott: You move around and you attack or shoot in four directions based on, you know, whatever.

189
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:39,845
Scott: Right.

190
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:45,845
Scott: It's got cute characters, cute story, nice art, you know, nice calm music.

191
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:52,309
Scott: The music actually is kind of, it's not, it's not like music you would play, like at a soundtrack on purpose, but it's sort of like in the background.

192
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:57,807
Scott: It's like, about this game that's worth talking about.

193
00:12:57,847 --> 00:13:03,989
Scott: that is significant is the way that they have turned the systems on their head, right?

194
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:07,800
Scott: If you think about the normal, you know, action RPG systems, right?

195
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:11,192
Scott: The Diablo system would be like, you know, the, the model, right?

196
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:12,677
Scott: You pick a class.

197
00:13:12,798 --> 00:13:14,282
Scott: that is your class.

198
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:17,772
Scott: You know, you have stats, those are your stats.

199
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:25,116
Scott: You gain abilities as you level up and equipment as you level up and you choose them and you are built.

200
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:25,919
Scott: You're making a build.

201
00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:27,485
Scott: This is your build.

202
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:29,331
Scott: You are the wand wizard.

203
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,776
Scott: You shoot with wands.

204
00:13:30,816 --> 00:13:31,739
Scott: That is what you do.

205
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:33,485
Scott: You are the necromancer.

206
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:34,949
Scott: You summon skeletons.

207
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:36,675
Scott: That is what you do.

208
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,785
Scott: And you do it the whole game and you just get better at doing that.

209
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:41,371
Scott: one thing, right?

210
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:45,706
Scott: You polish and sharpen that one pointy stick as sharp as you can make it.

211
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:47,594
Scott: And that's how you play those games.

212
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:55,921
Scott: And I think every grindy level up action RPG I've ever played, almost all of them follows that kind of system, right?

213
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,228
Scott: This game does not do that.

214
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:06,537
Scott: What this game does, nobody saves the world is you start out as nobody, literally like this white humanoid creature that has amnesia.

215
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:07,360
Scott: Like it's nobody.

216
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:15,161
Scott: And you have one attack, which is slap and you kill some bad guys and you love and you unlock, right?

217
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:16,003
Rym: Rat.

218
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:26,005
Scott: And now you can freely, at will, at any time, freely transform from nobody into rat or vice versa.

219
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:32,714
Scott: It would be like in Diablo, if you could just change your class instantly, like necromancer, wizard, fighter, just whenever the hell you wanted.

220
00:14:32,754 --> 00:14:42,088
Scott: Like you could like swing a sword, turn into a wizard, shoot some wands, turn into a necromancer, raise a skeleton, turn back into a warrior, right?

221
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:43,632
Scott: Instantly, right?

222
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:50,554
Scott: So, and as you play with each individual, you know, you unlock these different classes in sort of like a tech chart.

223
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:54,588
Scott: And at the top, of course, is the dragon, right?

224
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:55,431
Scott: Which I haven't gotten yet.

225
00:14:56,113 --> 00:15:08,231
Scott: And with each of the different, you know, classes, creatures, transformations, there are quests to go on and the quests are specific to the class, right?

226
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:12,946
Scott: There are general quests that sort of level you up as a whole, but those are boring.

227
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:16,216
Scott: But each class has specific class quests.

228
00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:19,325
Scott: Like for the rat, it'll be, it's like, Oh, you're the rat.

229
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:19,887
Scott: Okay.

230
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:23,458
Scott: Kill 10 enemies with the rat's bite attack.

231
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:23,879
Scott: Okay.

232
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,669
Scott: Now kill 20 enemies with the rat's other attack.

233
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,435
Scott: And then you do those.

234
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:37,142
Scott: And when you do those things, the rat specifically levels up from like F to D to C to B to A. You know what that's a little bit like?

235
00:15:37,242 --> 00:15:39,067
Rym: The weapons in Secret of Mana.

236
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,852
Scott: Yes, exactly.

237
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:46,571
Scott: And however, once you get to like B rank, so let's say you get the rat to B rank, right?

238
00:15:47,013 --> 00:16:00,817
Scott: Well, what happens now, once you get a high enough rank, you unlock more ability slots, more abilities, and you can actually import abilities from other that you've unlocked on other classes to sort of mix and match.

239
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:06,112
Scott: So you can have a rat do the, the wizard's, you know, magic attack.

240
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:09,221
Scott: You could, you could assign that to like button X or Y or whatever.

241
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:14,593
Rym: Kind of like Final Fantasy 5.

242
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:19,146
Scott: It's like the rat's, the rat's normal attack is always going to be the rat's bite.

243
00:16:19,347 --> 00:16:26,777
Scott: You know, it's never going to change and you can't, the rat's basic attack, that bite, you can't move that attack onto anyone else, right?

244
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:28,463
Scott: Cause it's, that's the rat, you know?

245
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:39,546
Scott: So there's always a reason to transform, but the other three attacks on the three other buttons, you can import or export those from the other classes, as long as you've unlocked them and leveled them up sufficiently.

246
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,438
Scott: And the game will force you, right?

247
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:45,525
Scott: To do combinations on purpose.

248
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:49,080
Scott: For example, like there was a class, I was like, I was someone else.

249
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,963
Scott: I forgot who I was.

250
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:54,241
Scott: And it was like, Oh, you want to level up the, I don't know, the night or something.

251
00:16:54,281 --> 00:17:00,197
Scott: I forget which one, uh, kill 10 enemies with the rats, you know, attack.

252
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:06,776
Scott: And it's like, what it's like, it forces you to do a specific combination to get, you know, ahead.

253
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:07,097
Scott: Right.

254
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:11,214
Scott: Um, it'll be like each, there's four different attack types.

255
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:23,551
Scott: There's like, you know, bludgeoning, piercing magic and dark, I guess poison and like certain enemies will have like a shield on them so that you can only damage them with the right type of attack.

256
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:25,781
Scott: And so like, let's say you're the magician.

257
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:36,018
Scott: Most of the magicians attacks are like the magic type, but one of the quests for the magician will be like, you know, pierce the 10 enemies with the piercing thing.

258
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:47,358
Scott: And it forces you to get a piercing ability from another class, import it to the magician, find enemies who are vulnerable to that and use it on them in order to level up the magician to the next rank.

259
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:53,603
Scott: So then you could help fully unlock whatever's beyond the magician, you know, the dragon or the monk or whoever else is up there.

260
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:54,747
Scott: Right.

261
00:17:54,767 --> 00:18:00,870
Scott: So as you play the game and there's different situations in the game, like, Oh crap, I'm in a water level.

262
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,602
Scott: I better turn into the mermaid or the turtle, right.

263
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:04,465
Scott: To go in the water.

264
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:06,290
Scott: Oh, I'm in a fire.

265
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:14,698
Scott: You know, it's like you're constantly changing and rebuilding and reconfiguring and you have to level up fucking everybody.

266
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:20,762
Scott: Cause even if you're not going to use that character, you have to get their abilities to import to another character.

267
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:24,813
Scott: And it's like, you're forced to play everybody.

268
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:29,569
Scott: You can't just focus in on your one deal, your one build and level it up.

269
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:30,131
Scott: And that's it.

270
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:31,757
Rym: You have to go out to Dr.

271
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,179
Rym: Chaos.

272
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:35,149
Rym: You got to play all the family members to beat that game.

273
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:37,697
Scott: You have to play the whole game.

274
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:39,526
Scott: You're thinking about legacy of the wizard.

275
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:39,667
Scott: Yeah.

276
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,966
Scott: Like I said, the wizard, you don't have to play all the characters to beat that really.

277
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:45,576
Rym: I mean, I did see a speed run where you can do anyway.

278
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:46,520
Scott: Yeah.

279
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,462
Scott: Speed runs.

280
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:58,265
Scott: But anyway, the point is, yeah, you're sorta have to, and it's like, as the game goes on this situations, we have to like transform constantly, like, you know, transform, fight, fight, fight, transform, fight, fight, fight.

281
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:03,063
Scott: And you're constantly strategizing and reconfiguring right.

282
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,348
Scott: Making different builds.

283
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:08,386
Scott: It's like you go into a level and it's like, man, what's, you know, the situation here.

284
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:10,860
Scott: I got these bad guys, these bad guys and this water.

285
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:11,541
Scott: All right.

286
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:14,013
Scott: So how do I get a mermaid or a turtle or a ghost?

287
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:15,621
Scott: Cause the ghost can float over the water.

288
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:19,014
Scott: Like what abilities can I give them to deal with this level?

289
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:24,015
Scott: I guess maybe I'll need to use two or three guys and switch between them to get through this level.

290
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:24,598
Scott: Right.

291
00:19:24,618 --> 00:19:28,880
Scott: And it's like, if you get it wrong, you just, you just get killed because it can't even hurt anybody.

292
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:33,475
Scott: So that, you know, it's like, it makes it fun to play.

293
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:34,600
Scott: It keeps it interesting.

294
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:42,850
Scott: Uh, you know, and it's like, there are situations where like, yeah, you can't, you know, you're grinding, but you're not really grinding.

295
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:54,933
Scott: Like you could sit there and kill bad guys all day and never level up really that much at all, because you have to do it in the specified way, according to the class that you're currently using.

296
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:57,102
Scott: Otherwise it doesn't get you anything really.

297
00:19:57,142 --> 00:20:05,136
Scott: just gives you some gold, maybe, you know, and even getting a bunch of gold doesn't help because the shop sells out of like upgrade coins and then tough, tough shit.

298
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:05,417
Scott: Right.

299
00:20:05,477 --> 00:20:06,601
Rym: So should I get it?

300
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:07,223
Rym: It looks fun.

301
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:07,926
Rym: Looks cute.

302
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:15,156
Scott: It does have a two P co-op situation that I have not tried, which I think would be really fun with two people transforming.

303
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:20,477
Scott: And that would make some of the levels easier because then you wouldn't have to individually transform so much.

304
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:32,523
Scott: Like if there's two kinds of bad guys in one area, you could both be the right class to deal with those and then deal with, you know, I deal with these half of the guys and you deal with those half of the guys and so on.

305
00:20:32,603 --> 00:20:39,842
Scott: So if you like an action RPG for cheap on the PC, you know, you, uh, this is a good game, I think.

306
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:48,989
Scott: Uh, and it's really, I really like the forcing you to play all the characters system as opposed to the grind one character system.

307
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:50,654
Rym: All right.

308
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:52,800
Scott: So good, good design, good game design.

309
00:20:53,622 --> 00:20:56,540
Rym: It looks like it's on the switch and PC and let's on everything.

310
00:20:58,563 --> 00:20:58,623
Rym: Yep.

311
00:20:58,643 --> 00:21:06,796
Rym: So in some other, uh, news, uh, key forge, which has been languishing, we talked about it a while ago where they, they messed up the algorithms.

312
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:07,560
Rym: They couldn't make more.

313
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,554
Scott: There was, there was basically what, what the rumor was.

314
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:17,759
Scott: I don't know if this is confirmed is that there was a ransomware and I guess it's like, how could you lose an algorithm?

315
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:20,812
Scott: It's like, I guess there was a ransomware and it got their backups too.

316
00:21:21,474 --> 00:21:26,572
Scott: So they would have to basically read software from scratch or pay a ransom.

317
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:27,997
Rym: There's still cagey about it.

318
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:39,500
Rym: Cause even this article for with the new news says, quote, unfortunately key forage went on an indefinite hiatus in 2021 due to unspecified issues with the underlying algorithm that created new decks for the game.

319
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:39,761
Scott: Yeah.

320
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:44,605
Scott: That makes, it doesn't make any sense that like you have software and the software just stops working.

321
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:46,393
Scott: That's not a thing that happens, right?

322
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:47,960
Scott: It's like people could fix that.

323
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,450
Scott: The only explanation that really makes sense.

324
00:21:50,872 --> 00:21:52,640
Scott: I don't have any evidence that this is the case.

325
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:55,890
Scott: But it was a rumor, so it might not be true.

326
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:05,183
Scott: I don't want to get in trouble, but the only thing that makes sense is that every copy of the software and source code that they had was ransomware.

327
00:22:05,685 --> 00:22:13,594
Scott: And either they paid the ransom and the ransom, you know, I don't understand why people who do ransomware actually unlock the software, right?

328
00:22:13,674 --> 00:22:16,042
Scott: It's like, if I was a ransomware person, I'm already evil.

329
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:17,346
Scott: Give me another million.

330
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:17,446
Scott: Yeah.

331
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:22,822
Rym: I'd be like, I'd be like, thanks for the free money.

332
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,066
Scott: Your shit's still encrypted.

333
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:24,669
Scott: Deal with it.

334
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:26,897
Scott: I threw away the keys.

335
00:22:26,937 --> 00:22:27,359
Scott: Good luck.

336
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:28,601
Scott: They're right.

337
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:29,624
Scott: Doofus.

338
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:37,347
Scott: Um, you know, but I guess that would hurt anyone in the future trying to collect ransom, you know, whatever.

339
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:47,180
Scott: But the point is, is either they didn't pay, they paid in the ransom where people didn't unlock it or, you know, but yet they must've just lost all the software.

340
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:57,618
Scott: And the only option would then be to rebuild all the software from scratch, which is a Herculean effort that would not be worth what Keyforge is going to bring in.

341
00:22:57,638 --> 00:22:58,260
Scott: Right.

342
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:58,941
Scott: Yeah.

343
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:09,399
Scott: It's like once they had the Keyforge machine set up, you know, the level of popularity that had had attained made it worth it to carry on with the game because they were making more sets.

344
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,347
Scott: So clearly it was economically viable.

345
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:18,712
Rym: Well, you know, we reviewed it a while back and it was a really cool idea, but the gameplay got pretty boring pretty quick.

346
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:22,024
Rym: And I didn't even play all the decks that I own.

347
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:23,310
Scott: I mean, it was no Netrunner.

348
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:27,591
Scott: I do still have some sealed Keyforge decks, so maybe I'll keep those around anyway.

349
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:38,640
Rym: So long story short, the news today, actually from a couple of days, like a week ago, is that Asmodei is who currently has Keyforge.

350
00:23:39,422 --> 00:23:39,964
Scott: is they bought.

351
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:52,220
Rym: Fantasy Flight Games is now selling the intellectual property rights for Keyforge to Christian Peterson, who was the founder of Fantasy Flight Games.

352
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,381
Scott: Right.

353
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:58,442
Scott: So it's sort of like, you know, you ran the company, you made this game, right?

354
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:00,009
Scott: We're not making the game anymore.

355
00:24:00,511 --> 00:24:01,856
Scott: You can have the IP back.

356
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:09,103
Scott: So the IP, I guess, includes the trademark, the word Keyforge, the art, the characters, the universe, the story, all that.

357
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:11,048
Rym: And now it'll be.

358
00:24:11,128 --> 00:24:22,570
Rym: it's owned by a company called Ghost Galaxy that is, quote, developing a next generation software engine for developing procedurally generated card games similar to the system that generate Keyforge.

359
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,603
Rym: So basically this company seems like it's going to double down on.

360
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,172
Rym: what can you do with this concept?

361
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:34,860
Scott: There are at least one other people company, I think, that did a similar thing, but I don't know how successful it's been.

362
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,371
Scott: I really, I wish someone would just do it digitally entirely.

363
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:45,839
Scott: It's like if there was a card game, you know, as good, you know, it doesn't have to be, even if it wasn't Netrunner.

364
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:47,204
Scott: good, that's a big ask, right?

365
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:50,554
Scott: But just, you know, as good, better than Keyforge.

366
00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:58,019
Scott: good with a UI that was at least as good as like, the UI has to be good, like ideally Hearthstone.

367
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:05,560
Scott: good, but it could be Race of the Galaxy good, it could be, you know, Root good, right?

368
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:12,018
Scott: And as long as, you know, the UI was good enough, they were like, hey, pay a dollar, right?

369
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:23,525
Scott: Or, you know, buy a season or something and you get this many random decks, something like that, and there were people online playing it, like, I could be convinced to play that based on circumstances, right?

370
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:26,620
Scott: I'm not entirely opposed to getting involved in that kind of game.

371
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:37,422
Rym: Yeah, I mean, honestly, the only reason I eventually bounced very slowly off of Hearthstone was all the grinding for like any sort of real competitive play just wasn't worth keeping up with.

372
00:25:37,463 --> 00:25:38,119
Scott: Or paying money.

373
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:38,560
Rym: Yep.

374
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:44,559
Rym: Wasn't worth that much money to me, especially because I can just keep playing Overwatch and I don't have to pay any more money for that.

375
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:54,075
Scott: You know, Hearthstone, I did pay some monies for it, right, you know, for a while, you know, because I was playing, at the time, I was playing it a lot, right?

376
00:25:54,115 --> 00:25:58,220
Scott: So my calculation was like the amount of money that I was paying for it versus the hours.

377
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,605
Rym: Yeah, you don't know the times have changed.

378
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:07,215
Rym: I very seriously considered paying for a Fortnite Game Pass/Battle Pass thing for this current season.

379
00:26:07,235 --> 00:26:08,540
Rym: That's how much Fortnite I'm playing now.

380
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,938
Scott: That's all cosmetic shit, though.

381
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,460
Rym: Yeah, uh, yeah.

382
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,342
Scott: Yeah, okay.

383
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:18,360
Scott: I thought you're the person who doesn't open loot boxes and stays with the-.

384
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:22,020
Rym: I actually have almost a thousand loot boxes again in Overwatch.

385
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:23,180
Scott: Okay.

386
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:35,854
Rym: In some other news, this happens all the time, but it's worth noting because a lot of gamers, especially younger ones, seem to like forget that this is the thing that can happen.

387
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:47,572
Rym: So Ubisoft, known for just shutting down its old games, has announced that they are shutting down 15 of their slightly older games' multiplayer in the fall.

388
00:26:47,793 --> 00:27:03,800
Rym: So this fall, if you play, like, Auto 2070 or Assassin's Creed, like any Assassin's Creed, I guess, or there's this whole list of games that I guess had multiplayer in some fashion, but multiplayer is all gonna stop working.

389
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:05,002
Scott: Yep.

390
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:11,048
Scott: This is what happens when they have a multiplayer and they don't let people run their own servers, right?

391
00:27:11,108 --> 00:27:14,120
Scott: You can still- you want to play or have just peer-to-peer multiplayer.

392
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:29,986
Rym: It's also what happens when a game's multiplayer is not- some games are designed around their multiplayer, and some games have multiplayer, so they can put that on the box or get that little bit of extra juice in the game.

393
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:34,744
Rym: But not every game is Counter-Strike, and I did check before we did the show to make sure.

394
00:27:35,326 --> 00:27:37,434
Rym: So today, right now, go to Steam.

395
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:43,169
Rym: Number one game on Steam is still fucking Counter-Strike in the year 2022.

396
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:45,314
Rym: By a wide margin.

397
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:56,731
Scott: Yeah, you know, I think, you know, this really, you know, from a company's perspective, right, is like maintaining servers for an online multiplayer game is work, right?

398
00:27:56,812 --> 00:27:57,655
Scott: It's a pain in the butt.

399
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:58,779
Scott: It costs money.

400
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:08,213
Rym: Especially because Counter-Strike's like- I paid for Counter-Strike GO when it came out, so I could play it right now, use their servers, they're not going to get any more money out of me.

401
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:16,884
Scott: Yeah, if nobody is playing the game, and there's no revenue stream for the game, and then it's like, why would you keep those servers on?

402
00:28:16,985 --> 00:28:18,570
Scott: It just makes sense to turn them off.

403
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:34,646
Scott: You know, the problem is, is like, you know, well now, you know, it's like- it's only really bad from a preservation standpoint, and like, hey, you know, there's this- it's sort of like, you know, I guess the first thing to ever happen to this was like the BT Zelda, right?

404
00:28:34,686 --> 00:28:39,723
Scott: The satellite Zelda 1 from Japan was like the first case of this.

405
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:42,980
Scott: It's like, you can't go and have that- it was an experience that someone crafted.

406
00:28:43,481 --> 00:29:01,801
Scott: that now cannot be had, and, you know, there are things like- there are other things like, we can't experience, I don't know, tribes 2 as it was, we can't experience what it was like to fight in the game, right?

407
00:29:01,821 --> 00:29:18,560
Scott: It's like they're, you know, um, so it's like, we can't expect to preserve every experience that has ever existed, but it's a meaningful historical thing with video games, you know, we talk about it all the time, because we are still early in the history of video games.

408
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:28,732
Rym: Yeah, I mean, some of the, like, many of the first video games, like the earliest ones that ever existed, were during our lifespan or not that long before us.

409
00:29:29,254 --> 00:29:34,852
Scott: Yeah, like the earliest video games, like the pongs, were like 70s, 80s deals, right?

410
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:49,315
Scott: You know, it's like, and it's like, it's only 2022, that's like less than 50 years really of video games, and in terms of video games being a big cultural thing, like, really not until the 90s were they big, right?

411
00:29:49,375 --> 00:30:00,349
Scott: So we're talking 32 years of video games, 32 years of movies, you're talking, like, think about movies, that's like movies from the 40s, maybe, not even, right?

412
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:16,433
Scott: It's like movies from the 40s are like, you know, historical, like, monumental things, so video games that come out now are as gonna be as historical monumental as movies from the 30s and 40s are now, right?

413
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:24,034
Scott: Movies, I mean, movies from the 50s and 60s are historical monumental, right, masterpieces of all time, right?

414
00:30:24,134 --> 00:30:40,605
Scott: Hell, even some from the 90s, so, you know, so it's like the ones being made today, even though they don't seem, I mean, a lot of them are garbage, but a lot of movies in the 70s were garbage, but then there's the ones that survived.

415
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:56,900
Scott: Several video games made now are going to be all-time great masterpieces worthy of preservation, and if they have an online component that is not maintained, well, that's kind of fucked up, that's sort of like burning half of a film reel, you know, kind of deal.

416
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,241
Scott: I think

417
00:30:57,282 --> 00:31:26,879
Rym: what's really notable here, the two things that stand out to me, then we'll move on, because this is not the topic of the show, is that one, Counter-Strike is some fucking magic that it has remained so popular for so long, large, like, fundamentally unchanged, like, it's tweaked, it's gone through three different engines, there have been tweaks to it, but the core of Counter-Strike, pretty much the same as it was when we were playing, like, beta, whatever, when they added the P90, when we were at RIT.

418
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:34,726
Scott: I mean, the fundamental concept of, shoot people, try to do a thing, you're not just trying to shoot people, try to do a thing.

419
00:31:34,746 --> 00:31:36,379
Rym: If you die, you're dead, like, super realistic.

420
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,100
Scott: Yeah, when you die, you're dead, and then you wait for the next round.

421
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:40,501
Rym: Yep.

422
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:45,219
Rym: Actually, I have this weird urge to play Counter-Strike now, but I only want to play with friends, not with people who are good.

423
00:31:48,631 --> 00:31:48,820
Scott: Anyway.

424
00:31:49,160 --> 00:32:00,099
Rym: And two, that any game that's bigger than Counter-Strike, or even close to Counter-Strike, really has its own launcher and will never be on Steam, is the way that tends to go.

425
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:11,226
Scott: That's because, you know, if you're making a game that's multiplayer like that and is big, you're making money on some sort of transaction, DLCs, subscriptions, skins, pay-to-win, something, right?

426
00:32:11,286 --> 00:32:13,060
Scott: You're not making money and selling the game itself.

427
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,840
Scott: What's really messing me up, though, is that- You need to be on Steam and let them take a cut.

428
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,120
Scott: You need some sort of external payment system platform that's your own to get all the money.

429
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:30,359
Rym: Number four on this list is somehow still Team Fortress 2, and I almost want to join a server to see what the fuck is even happening in there.

430
00:32:31,726 --> 00:32:32,439
Scott: People are playing it.

431
00:32:33,604 --> 00:32:33,805
Rym: Yeah.

432
00:32:33,825 --> 00:32:37,300
Rym: But, uh, two last little newses, we'll get into, uh, the rest of the main bit.

433
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:44,563
Rym: So, uh, if you were trying to get Pokemon cards and you couldn't because there was a shortage, well, guess what?

434
00:32:44,924 --> 00:32:53,939
Rym: The Pokemon company had a strategy to get more cards into the market, and it succeeded, and you can easily get your Pokemon cards now.

435
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,208
Scott: I don't know how- it's not- I don't know if it's super easy, but you can get Pokemon cards now, right?

436
00:32:59,248 --> 00:33:02,500
Scott: They increased production dramatically, right?

437
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,966
Scott: Um, you know, it was never-.

438
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,500
Scott: it's not like they ever had an issue of supply chain.

439
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,560
Scott: It's simply that they were producing the same amount of Pokemon cards they always produced.

440
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,218
Rym: But interest seemed to have taken off.

441
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:21,739
Scott: Demand just jumped dramatically and caught them by surprise, so it took- takes a while to ramp up production in response to demand, right?

442
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,932
Scott: And now they've caught up, and I think you'll see, uh, if demand drops, which you gotta imagine it will, right?

443
00:33:29,194 --> 00:33:33,660
Scott: Then you're gonna see a glut, and it's gonna- because they'll take time to ramp the production down.

444
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,081
Rym: Good!

445
00:33:34,603 --> 00:33:37,700
Rym: I hate the secondary market in collectible card games.

446
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:44,938
Scott: Oh, I hate the secondary market too, but- is actually a decent card game.

447
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:45,139
Scott: It is!

448
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:45,541
Scott: It's-.

449
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:49,663
Scott: the only thing I have against it is- it's not the best card game, but it's decent.

450
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:50,728
Scott: I'll play it, why not?

451
00:33:51,391 --> 00:33:54,547
Scott: Um, and, you know, it has some- some unique elements to it.

452
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:59,540
Scott: Uh, is really that it's- the gambling for children is the- is the problem, right?

453
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:11,719
Scott: But, at the moment when demand drops, and the production is still high, and the market is glutted with the Pokemon cards, I am considering going out and just buying, like, a whole fuckin' box.

454
00:34:12,022 --> 00:34:14,132
Rym: If you do this, I will do it too.

455
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:15,239
Rym: There's no reason not to.

456
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:21,080
Scott: That's what I'm saying, let's just go out and buy, like, a box of boosters, like, you know, for, you know, for a reasonable price.

457
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,947
Scott: It won't be cheap, but, you know, a reasonable price, not some overpriced, right?

458
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:31,960
Scott: And then, with just whatever set that happens to be, will be our Pokemon cards for the rest of our lives.

459
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,612
Rym: I mean, for all that, I could just go home and get my magic cards, like, the revised cards.

460
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:39,040
Scott: I have them right here, I don't need to go home, I got- I got all my cards.

461
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,339
Scott: But to give you a sense of the scale, so- I still got the Netrunner cards.

462
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:55,059
Rym: Last year, the Pokemon company printed, uh, so normally, they print between one and two billion Pokemon cards a year, that's their normal rate.

463
00:34:56,902 --> 00:35:00,180
Rym: They've made 43 billion since the game launched.

464
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:06,760
Rym: Last year, they raised that, and made almost 4 billion.

465
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:11,856
Rym: This year, so far, they have printed 9 billion.

466
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:20,139
Scott: So they've printed a po- more than one Pokemon card for every person on Earth, just this year alone.

467
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:20,923
Rym: Yep.

468
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:29,960
Scott: And if you thought- If you count all the Pokemon cards ever printed, basically every human being alive right at this instant could have a handful of Pokemon cards.

469
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:36,279
Rym: 43.2 billion Pokemon cards have been printed to date, not counting bootlegs and counterfeits.

470
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:58,157
Scott: If you took all the Pokemon cards ever made, at this moment, and made a big pile, and everyone walked up to it, each person could take, like, six, seven, maybe even eight cards off the pile, and when the last human, the only remaining human with no Pokemon cards walks up to the pile, it'll have about six, seven, eight cards left in it.

471
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:07,884
Rym: Another way to put this, I'm just gonna quote this article that I linked to in Polygon, "More than a quarter of all the Pokemon cards that have ever been printed were printed between 2020 and

472
00:36:07,884 --> 00:36:10,960
Rym: 2022.".

473
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,332
Scott: I still have my Pokemon cards from the 90s.

474
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,089
Scott: They're all beat up and probably not, you know, but they're way old.

475
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:17,080
Scott: They're from the first set.

476
00:36:17,863 --> 00:36:18,451
Scott: They're legit.

477
00:36:18,714 --> 00:36:19,140
Rym: I bought 'em.

478
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:30,140
Rym: So speaking of cards that are easy to get, because cryptocurrency is basically predictably collapsing into the pile of shit that it's always been- Video cards are plentiful.

479
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:33,370
Rym: You can get top tier, like, 3080s at MSRP or below.

480
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,360
Rym: They are just- All right, Newegg, components.

481
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,080
Scott: Let's go to the Newegg test.

482
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,139
Scott: Newegg, video cards and video devices, desktop graphics cards.

483
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,080
Scott: All right, let's try to get a GeForce RTX 30-.

484
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,501
Rym: I'll go to Amazon and try to buy a 3090.

485
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:56,119
Scott: All right, let's get a 3080, and we're gonna sort by-.

486
00:36:57,023 --> 00:36:58,048
Scott: All right, I just bought a 3090 that's on sale.

487
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:01,967
Rym: 20% off for 1500 bucks.

488
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Scott: Oh, we only want new ones, and we only want ones sold by Newegg, not by, like, third party sellers, right?

489
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:11,209
Scott: All right, 800 bucks.

490
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:12,559
Scott: Isn't that the MSRP?

491
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,459
Rym: Pretty much.

492
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:19,219
Rym: And there are so many video cards on the market.

493
00:37:19,259 --> 00:37:23,380
Rym: now, like, you can just get the exact specific video card you want.

494
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,940
Rym: MSRP or close, no problem.

495
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:28,840
Rym: So, everything's coming up Milhouse.

496
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,840
Scott: All right, I mean, you know, I don't need one.

497
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:36,256
Scott: I'm still waiting for 4080, 5080, 6080, something like that.

498
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:49,980
Rym: I was gonna get a 3080, but at this point, I have to build a whole new computer by 2025 anyway, and I already put that 3080 Ti in Emily's workstation, so I think I can hold out for the 4080 and a new computer.

499
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:52,600
Scott: Yeah, 4080, yeah, probably.

500
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,663
Scott: Just wait until 2023, 2024.

501
00:37:55,663 --> 00:38:07,020
Rym: Actually, the hard thing is what I want, but they're hard to get is, so an index VR headset that has a cable that plugs in the back of your computer, and then has a junction on the end of it, and then you plug the headset into the junction.

502
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,840
Rym: So, like, if you trip and fall, it'll pull out of the junction instead of fucking up your computer.

503
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,760
Scott: Like a mag safety.

504
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:19,280
Rym: Yeah, so it's hard to get just the piece of that that goes on a computer, because what I want to do is just leave one of those plugged into both our computers.

505
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:25,300
Rym: When Emily's not using her workstation, I could just use my index on her computer at full frame.

506
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:28,000
Rym: But, uh, I can't find that cable.

507
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:37,100
Rym: Oh, because it'll be easier to swap than swapping out, like, a-- Yeah, otherwise I'd have to climb behind and unplug, like, an HDMI cable and, like, multiple USB cables and all this crap.

508
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,960
Scott: Couldn't you just-- Well, you could, A, turn the computer around backwards.

509
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:48,580
Scott: B, you could just get, like, an extension cable that has, you know, to extend from the back to the front.

510
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:53,644
Rym: Extension cables get dicey with USB 3.

511
00:38:53,644 --> 00:38:54,639
Scott: It's just got to be a good one.

512
00:38:54,982 --> 00:38:57,659
Rym: Even a good one, there's trouble you can run into.

513
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,300
Rym: You run into latency issues.

514
00:39:01,984 --> 00:39:08,140
Scott: You could also, you know, if it's a USB cable, you could just have a front USB port hooked up to the right spot on the motherboard.

515
00:39:08,461 --> 00:39:13,279
Rym: Really, it's the, uh, because I got to plug-- I have to plug the additional HDMI into the back.

516
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,119
Scott: Yeah, I was going to get an HDMI extension over to the front also.

517
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:24,379
Rym: Yeah, but that can also give you difficulties considering the high frame rate and resolution that's being pumped over that cable.

518
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,240
Scott: It's wires.

519
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:25,828
Scott: It is wires.

520
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,636
Rym: I've looked into this.

521
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:29,618
Scott: It's going to be fine.

522
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:34,480
Scott: People putting extension-- As long as it's a proper cable, it's going to be fine.

523
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,560
Rym: Well, the problem is the cable length that's already on the headsets approaches the limit of what those cables are intended to handle by itself.

524
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:48,019
Scott: Uh, I've-- every time in my life, I mean, I'm sure there are definitely instances where cables get too long and they don't work.

525
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:53,978
Scott: But every time in my life I've ever seen a, you know, a sign or a warning or some sort of limit.

526
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:57,180
Scott: that said, this is technically how long this cable can be within spec.

527
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,800
Scott: Much longer cables have functioned perfectly.

528
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,960
Rym: Yeah, depending on what you're doing.

529
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,639
Rym: USB 2, you can get away with a lot.

530
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,160
Rym: USB 3, I have actually run into problems before.

531
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:08,920
Scott: No, anyway.

532
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,156
Rym: But at the same time, that was putting, like, a 20-foot extension cable somewhere, so.

533
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,500
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

534
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:30,219
Rym: America celebrates the 4th of July by blowing things up and shooting people, but I figure we'll have two firework-related things of the day, so I'll start.

535
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:36,900
Rym: It is the 10-year anniversary of one of the most notable firework shows that ever happened.

536
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,820
Rym: San Diego 2012.

537
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,079
Scott: Wasn't this a thing-- I'm pretty sure this was a news or a thing of the day 10 years ago.

538
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,939
Scott: Someone check on it.

539
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,080
Rym: Yeah, well, if it is, then I'll eat a hat of some kind.

540
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,839
Rym: But, uh, so 10 years ago, on the 4th of July, the city of San Diego had some official fireworks.

541
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,939
Rym: Whole bunch of barges, a lot like the Macy's fireworks that we have in New York.

542
00:40:57,262 --> 00:40:59,160
Rym: They're all synchronized with the controller.

543
00:40:59,802 --> 00:41:01,118
Rym: It's a fancy professional show.

544
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:20,139
Rym: Due to a mistake, the-- instead of the show going off as sequence, the controller barge launched every single firework for the entire show in order as fast as it could, and every other barge did the exact same thing.

545
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:32,540
Rym: And what happened is amazing, and I'm glad it happened at least once, but I don't know if it needs to happen again, because that was a waste of a lot of fireworks.

546
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:39,119
Scott: Yeah, how-- it's like, it's kind of ridiculous, awesome, but dangerous, but also entertaining to see.

547
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:45,220
Rym: It is, like, as whatever you think this looks like, if you have never seen a picture of this-- It just looks like a fire.

548
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:50,240
Rym: It looks-- it looks like a nuke is going off, like, in the distance.

549
00:41:50,462 --> 00:41:52,239
Rym: It is amazing to behold.

550
00:41:53,202 --> 00:42:06,379
Rym: And the best part is, you see the crowd, if you watch this video, go from excited to worried to debating leaving to excited again, because it doesn't even last that long.

551
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:07,600
Rym: Yep.

552
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,952
Rym: We're talking 35 seconds.

553
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,320
Scott: You know, the finale of a fireworks show, they tend to, you know, they set off a lot of fireworks, right?

554
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:31,057
Scott: It's like a big ending, and it's always sort of the same, because fireworks artists, right, you know, people who figured this out, is like, they realize that's about the limit to where, like, if you set off more fireworks than that at once, it's really not enjoyable anymore.

555
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:42,660
Rym: The fancy fireworks, the Macy's ones we just watched, of course, the finale will do layers where, like, there's a low ground effect finale, and then a higher finale, and then an even higher finale to avoid that problem.

556
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:53,679
Scott: It's like, you know, it's only so many guitars you can have until such a point where it's just this solid noise, and it, you know, there's nothing to it.

557
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,238
Rym: You can only have so many backup singers screaming everything louder than everything else behind Meat Loaf.

558
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:01,909
Scott: Yeah, it's like some people, you know, there is a time and a place for that.

559
00:43:02,311 --> 00:43:11,459
Scott: just a wall of noise nonsense, but if you actually are trying to create something discernible, then there's a limit to how much you can fill, right?

560
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,619
Rym: All right, so what do you got?

561
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:24,100
Scott: So, if you don't want to set off a whole bunch of fireworks really rapidly, because there's a limit to that, why not just set off one firework that's really, really big?

562
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:28,538
Scott: The biggest ever, in fact, apparently- Sixty-two inches?

563
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:30,480
Scott: Yeah.

564
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,437
Scott: Holy shit!

565
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:35,955
Scott: If you're ever asking yourself, "What is the world's record for largest single

566
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:36,539
Scott: firework?".

567
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,898
Scott: Here it is in Colorado.

568
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:41,259
Scott: They made the world's largest single firework.

569
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:43,159
Scott: They fired it up into the air.

570
00:43:43,822 --> 00:43:45,620
Scott: It exploded really big.

571
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:45,947
Scott: Boom!

572
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:47,999
Scott: It's a pretty standard firework.

573
00:43:49,005 --> 00:43:58,117
Scott: Uh, someone in the comments did a fuck ton of math accounting for, I don't know if their math is right- I mean, the first comment is, and I quote, "Everyone gangsta till a mushroom cloud

574
00:43:58,157 --> 00:43:58,420
Scott: farms.".

575
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:01,960
Scott: Yeah, but there's a comment on the YouTube comments.

576
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:05,620
Scott: I don't know if it's true, but, you know, it could be true.

577
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:17,439
Scott: They claim to have accounted for, like, the air pressure, the elevation, the temperature, et cetera, and thus figured out how high it went, how big the explosion was, et cetera, et cetera.

578
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:17,979
Rym: That seems plausible.

579
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,540
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely, you know, math that could be done.

580
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:23,058
Rym: So here's a question I have for you.

581
00:44:24,522 --> 00:44:27,600
Rym: Why doesn't the Tsar Bomba count as the biggest firework?

582
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,000
Rym: What's the difference between a firework and a bomb?

583
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,319
Scott: A bomb is not a firework.

584
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,360
Rym: But what's the difference?

585
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,020
Rym: Because the bomb, they didn't bomb anything in particular, they just blew it up to look at it, basically.

586
00:44:37,481 --> 00:44:38,099
Rym: Like a firework.

587
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:45,618
Scott: A firework scatters, you know, like, you know, fizzle materials, right, around, and then- So does it nuke!

588
00:44:46,943 --> 00:44:49,599
Scott: And then those set on fire and create light.

589
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:55,220
Scott: A bomb, you know, it basically scatters force.

590
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,239
Rym: But a nuclear bomb also scatters a big light show.

591
00:45:01,621 --> 00:45:07,877
Scott: But it's not scatter, I guess, you know, someone on the internet, there's definitely a semantic argument.

592
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,320
Scott: But also there is a material difference between a firework and a bomb.

593
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,060
Rym: I'm just saying I'd like to know what that difference is.

594
00:45:15,342 --> 00:45:20,279
Rym: Either this is the biggest firework ever launched, or Tsar Bomba is the biggest firework ever launched.

595
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:22,320
Scott: Anyway.

596
00:45:26,303 --> 00:45:26,553
Scott: Anyway.

597
00:45:29,202 --> 00:45:36,660
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book, which, unless something happens, we'll do the show, on Thursday this week, Nine Fox Gambit, I finished.

598
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,620
Scott: There's a problem in that I read this book before it was even selected as the book club book.

599
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,959
Scott: I had finished reading it already.

600
00:45:43,383 --> 00:45:44,997
Scott: How much will I remember on Thursday?

601
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:51,019
Rym: Judeo, The Deuce of Gears, Woman Form and Man Form, Calendars, Utena Duels.

602
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,540
Scott: Yeah, you know, I remember plenty.

603
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,120
Scott: It was most memorable.

604
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,198
Rym: I've read the entire second book.

605
00:46:00,505 --> 00:46:01,679
Rym: My Warning Stand.

606
00:46:02,741 --> 00:46:06,600
Rym: Everything I've warned you about, like, just be ready for it if you keep reading.

607
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,800
Rym: And I'm gonna start the third book probably, like, this weekend.

608
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,639
Rym: Because I gotta know how this all ends.

609
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:13,974
Scott: Mm-hmm.

610
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:24,640
Rym: But yeah, otherwise, we, well, GeekNights will very likely be live, maybe with Scott, more likely without Scott, with at least one panel at PAX West.

611
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:30,319
Rym: But I will not be hanging out, or I will not be hanging out at the con, really, other than that panel.

612
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:35,460
Rym: And who knows what cons we'll even be able to go to in the foreseeable future.

613
00:46:35,561 --> 00:46:36,319
Rym: We'll see what happens.

614
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,640
Rym: It's still COVID land.

615
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:46,180
Rym: The one thing I'll tell you is that, based on looking at Twitter just now, a lot of people got COVID at Anime Expo.

616
00:46:47,162 --> 00:46:52,720
Scott: So, and the evidence is that the-- I'm not paying attention at all to Anime Expo.

617
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:59,040
Rym: Anime Expo, well, it's funny, because on one hand, Anime Expo was a, as far as I can tell, a shit show.

618
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,499
Rym: Like, it was just run like crap.

619
00:47:00,962 --> 00:47:02,900
Rym: But that's not news.

620
00:47:03,201 --> 00:47:05,260
Rym: Every Anime Expo is like, it's always been like that.

621
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,558
Rym: Before COVID, it was like that.

622
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:14,139
Rym: But there are a lot of people claiming that they tested positive shortly after Anime Expo having gone to it.

623
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:20,240
Rym: And I would believe it based on the terrifying, unmasked crowds that I saw in those images.

624
00:47:21,704 --> 00:47:22,880
Rym: So yeah, be judicious.

625
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:31,900
Rym: I would suggest avoiding cons, even if they're masked, even if they require vaccines, for at least the near term.

626
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:39,900
Rym: Because it looks like the BA5 variant of Omicron, COVID, is spreading through the US like ridiculous wildfire.

627
00:47:40,748 --> 00:47:41,838
Rym: And people are just dropping--.

628
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,600
Rym: people are coming down with this like crazy.

629
00:47:44,142 --> 00:47:45,799
Rym: So stay safe out there.

630
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,639
Rym: And cons, at least for the next several weeks, seem like a terrible idea.

631
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,400
Rym: So we're not talking about, like, streaming your game on Twitch or YouTube or whatever.

632
00:47:54,540 --> 00:48:00,799
Rym: We're talking about that game streaming on a high level-- and there's a lot of directions we can take this.

633
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,159
Rym: We might even do some other shows that zoom in on some aspects of this.

634
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:15,080
Rym: When the game you are playing is running on some hardware, somewhere, and you are playing that game on a different device.

635
00:48:16,802 --> 00:48:30,940
Scott: So this could be-- Or at least the input and output devices for the game, whether they're a monitor, a gamepad, whatever, are not directly connected to the computer that is running the game software.

636
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:47,960
Scott: There is some sort of network wired or wireless link in between, as opposed to a direct USB sort of link between the inputs and outputs and the computer that is running and rendering the frames of the game.

637
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:57,680
Rym: And this is a concept that-- it's interesting, in computing, this is actually how basically all computers worked for a very long time.

638
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,180
Rym: Nobody had a computer at their desk.

639
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:12,819
Rym: They had a completely stupid terminal at their desk that was basically just a controller that was connected via a very long, effectively like serial cable to the actual-- Or a telephone cable depending, you know.

640
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,280
Rym: To the actual computer that was sitting somewhere else and running everything for everybody.

641
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,399
Rym: And that's how all early computer games worked.

642
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,759
Rym: There weren't computers you could run games on.

643
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:27,960
Scott: Other oscilloscope games I think were-- Is an oscilloscope a computer?

644
00:49:29,322 --> 00:49:30,379
Scott: We're not going to talk about that now.

645
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:33,540
Scott: The point is, computers started out that way.

646
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:38,740
Scott: Then we had the personal computer where you actually had a small enough computer that you had one all to yourself.

647
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:47,360
Scott: And then after that, when networking started to pick up, we got the idea that there would be this thin client.

648
00:49:47,601 --> 00:49:50,960
Scott: That like, well, what if we got one really big supercomputer?

649
00:49:52,062 --> 00:49:57,399
Scott: And that way we didn't have to make so many of these personal computers that just sit around doing nothing most of the time.

650
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:03,920
Scott: We could give everybody their own really cheap computer with a really fast network connection.

651
00:50:04,921 --> 00:50:08,660
Scott: And the big computer will do all the work, right?

652
00:50:09,162 --> 00:50:14,459
Scott: And the little tiny computer that everyone has will just sort of receive and send over the network.

653
00:50:15,501 --> 00:50:21,800
Scott: And what we've arrived at in reality is some sort of combination of the two ideas, right?

654
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,428
Scott: We have this.

655
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:24,899
Scott: cloud computing is huge.

656
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:31,878
Scott: We have these massive computer warehouse places where there's shit tons of computers doing all kinds of work.

657
00:50:32,493 --> 00:50:32,720
Scott: Right?

658
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:39,780
Scott: And meanwhile, everyone has devices that often are just input and output, right?

659
00:50:40,061 --> 00:50:45,580
Scott: You do some hello Siri and it sends your voice to Amazon.

660
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,260
Scott: It processes and gets you your answers and then the answers come back.

661
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,376
Scott: If you don't have internet connection, it ain't gonna work.

662
00:50:53,065 --> 00:50:54,360
Scott: Siri is somewhere else, right?

663
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,900
Scott: You're effectively doing that when you say hello Siri or whoever, hello Apple, Google, same shit, right?

664
00:51:00,966 --> 00:51:01,600
Scott: Visit a website.

665
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,420
Scott: All the website shit's happening somewhere else, not on your computer, right?

666
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,178
Scott: Your computer's just inputting and outputting.

667
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:18,060
Scott: But your computer, your phone, your tablet, whatever is still really powerful because we still do some stuff locally, mainly gaming, right?

668
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:25,579
Scott: The idea of doing this network thin client streaming of games is an old idea.

669
00:51:25,861 --> 00:51:38,880
Scott: I remember hearing about it as early as like even the late 90s because game companies, game publishers, software companies in general wanted to do this, but game one specifically to get away from piracy, right?

670
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:43,700
Scott: They're like, well, if we don't give you the game, there's no way you can pirate it, right?

671
00:51:44,223 --> 00:51:44,840
Scott: It's the game.

672
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,880
Scott: There's one copy of it.

673
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,860
Scott: It runs on our computer.

674
00:51:47,322 --> 00:51:50,740
Scott: We can charge you money for it and you can't have it.

675
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,760
Scott: You can't modify it, whatever, right?

676
00:51:53,321 --> 00:51:55,880
Scott: And so as gamers, we didn't like that idea.

677
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:59,355
Scott: We didn't like that idea because A, we wanted to pirate games.

678
00:52:01,345 --> 00:52:02,460
Scott: That was one major reason.

679
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,640
Scott: We like pirating, right?

680
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,499
Scott: We didn't have a lot of money.

681
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,177
Scott: We were kids.

682
00:52:05,704 --> 00:52:06,659
Scott: We wanted to play games.

683
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,318
Scott: We had time.

684
00:52:07,923 --> 00:52:08,558
Scott: We didn't have money.

685
00:52:09,301 --> 00:52:10,018
Scott: So we didn't like that.

686
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,820
Scott: We also didn't like that.

687
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,580
Scott: Like, hey, well, this means how am I going to mod my games, right?

688
00:52:14,661 --> 00:52:16,860
Scott: How am I going to preserve backups of my games?

689
00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:22,719
Scott: If I pay for the game and you shut down, like we just talked about in the news, how am I going to keep playing the game?

690
00:52:23,401 --> 00:52:26,560
Scott: Um, you know, what if you change the game tribes too, right?

691
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,879
Scott: And I don't like what you changed.

692
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,860
Scott: Now I can't play the old version of the game.

693
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,180
Scott: You know, what if we, what if I lose my internet connection?

694
00:52:33,281 --> 00:52:34,920
Scott: I can't play the game now, right?

695
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,620
Scott: What if I have a LAN party, right?

696
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,699
Scott: It's like, how many copies of the game do I got to buy?

697
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,599
Scott: Everyone's got to pay you, you know?

698
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:51,419
Rym: So this idea sort of came and went and for a long time, every time this idea came, it was basically impractical and it wasn't time for it.

699
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:55,499
Rym: They were all sort of failures, bad ideas, done for the wrong reasons.

700
00:52:56,721 --> 00:53:06,019
Rym: But now in the current era, because we're going to talk about the current state of things a little bit, we have bandwidth, we have devices, like smartphones are extremely powerful.

701
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:13,340
Rym: The ecosystem is so different now to where a bunch of forms of this are perfectly viable today.

702
00:53:14,005 --> 00:53:23,920
Rym: But also at the same time, companies keep trying to do some forms of this that even if they are plausible and viable, are still just failing, which I find funny.

703
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,012
Scott: Yep.

704
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,620
Scott: So the biggest failure, right, was Google Stadia.

705
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:33,940
Scott: We've talked about it probably when it was new and we ignored it because it's not worth talking about.

706
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:39,756
Rym: I found a news from February 4th, 2022, which I queued up.

707
00:53:40,161 --> 00:53:40,858
Scott: Only five months ago.

708
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:52,800
Rym: Yeah, that basically said, according to Business Insider, Google's planning to salvage the Stadia technology and is looking for someone to buy it and or license it or use it for their own purposes.

709
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:53,840
Scott: Right.

710
00:53:53,900 --> 00:54:00,080
Scott: So the problem with Google Stadia is that the way it works is that the games are running on Google's computers, right?

711
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:03,740
Scott: And your computer, it streams you the video of the game, right?

712
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:09,340
Scott: So as long as your computer can stream 1080p video, you can see the game, right?

713
00:54:09,501 --> 00:54:13,240
Scott: It's no different than watching a 1080p stream on Netflix or anything else, right?

714
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,340
Scott: And all you have to send to Google is the inputs from your gamepad.

715
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:23,940
Scott: And there'll be some latency, obviously, but hopefully not much if your network connection is good, especially if it's wired.

716
00:54:25,324 --> 00:54:26,880
Rym: But that's a load-bearing thing you just said.

717
00:54:28,021 --> 00:54:33,859
Rym: A big problem with Stadia and with a lot of these services, even the in-house ones, we'll talk about like Steam Link in a minute.

718
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:39,680
Rym: Most people don't have, like internet got worse inside of most people's houses.

719
00:54:40,221 --> 00:54:42,060
Rym: We hit broadband, everyone had wired internet.

720
00:54:42,203 --> 00:54:43,000
Rym: that was super fast.

721
00:54:43,461 --> 00:54:54,200
Scott: Now we have even faster internet, but the vast majority of people- We're living in Fios, so you got to remember a lot of people are living in places with not as good internet connection as we have in our Fios.

722
00:54:54,200 --> 00:55:04,800
Rym: But even worse, even people with good internet, most people's in-house internet is Wi-Fi and Stadia and things like it often do not work well over Wi-Fi.

723
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:10,800
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, the newer Wi-Fis, the Wi-Fi 6s and whatnot, you get the good routers and the good radios.

724
00:55:10,942 --> 00:55:12,440
Scott: It is significantly improved.

725
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,900
Scott: There is a dramatic difference, but latency is still a thing.

726
00:55:16,222 --> 00:55:20,820
Scott: But the latency only really matters for some games in some scenarios, right?

727
00:55:21,441 --> 00:55:28,520
Scott: Even if you're playing a single-player FPS with ridiculous graphics, let's say Doom Eternal, right?

728
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:38,440
Scott: It's like single-player, that latency from that, assuming your bandwidth is good, it's not gonna be an issue, right, for normal play.

729
00:55:38,600 --> 00:56:02,380
Scott: It's only the latency is at the point where it's only an issue if, A, you've already got a network deficiency of some kind, right, or processing deficiency of some kind, or B, the game you're playing is a really tight, really real-time game, a fighting game, a multiplayer FPS, a competitive e-sport with a real-time component, right?

730
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,500
Scott: A lot of games don't even have any real-time component at all.

731
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,519
Scott: They're like a turn-based game.

732
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,420
Scott: Civilization, you could just play Civilization Stream.

733
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:09,060
Scott: What does it matter?

734
00:56:09,641 --> 00:56:11,560
Scott: It's like, it probably worked better.

735
00:56:11,842 --> 00:56:21,037
Rym: I mean, I've often played games like Hearts of Iron, like all those simulation games on my laptop in the other room, streaming with Steam Link from my desktop right here.

736
00:56:22,785 --> 00:56:27,320
Scott: Yep, so Stadia, technologically, the streaming of the games was fine.

737
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,699
Scott: What wasn't fine was the way they tried to sell it, which is like you had to still buy the games.

738
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:40,900
Scott: It's like you would get Stadia, and I know people who had Stadia from getting a free trial, and they had the free trial, the free trial ran out, and then they stopped, right?

739
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,300
Rym: I don't think I've ever met anyone who paid for Stadia.

740
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,380
Scott: Me either, but it's like you have Stadia.

741
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,819
Scott: Let's say you want to play a game, GameX.

742
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,743
Scott: You only had to buy GameX, like.

743
00:56:52,783 --> 00:56:54,140
Scott: the same way you buy it on Steam.

744
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:58,339
Scott: I don't know if the price was reduced, but you never actually get to download GameX.

745
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:08,420
Scott: You're just buying the right to stream GameX all you want, and it added to your Stadia library, and it's like, that's not gonna fly, right?

746
00:57:08,522 --> 00:57:11,759
Scott: No one's gonna do that, because they could just buy GameX on Steam.

747
00:57:12,803 --> 00:57:14,660
Scott: It's like, why would you do that?

748
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,820
Scott: That makes no sense, right?

749
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:29,080
Rym: It was interesting, because this is a problem where the technology was adequate for the use case, but no one was interested in how that was monetized or how it was delivered.

750
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:58,539
Scott: It could make sense for somebody who has enough computing horsepower to stream 1080p or 4K video, but does not have a video card advanced enough to render 60 FPS of full frames, because decoding video frames that are already rendered is less computationally intensive than actually rendering frames in real time with a GPU.

751
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:03,163
Scott: You don't want to spend $800 for a 3080.

752
00:58:03,163 --> 00:58:12,559
Scott: If someone else has a 3080, and you're basically just renting it, it's like, that might not be a bad deal, you know, just considering the scenario.

753
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,839
Rym: But it would assume that you don't need that 3080 for anything else.

754
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:20,600
Rym: Every game you want to play is on Stadia.

755
00:58:21,002 --> 00:58:23,369
Rym: If there's even one game you want to play that's not on Stadia.

756
00:58:23,409 --> 00:58:26,500
Rym: that needs a good video card, you had to buy the video card anyway.

757
00:58:26,722 --> 00:58:44,319
Rym: And that's where I think Stadia really failed in the end, was that the majority of the addressable market of a product like Stadia, when it came out, were people who played games already, and thus either already had a gaming console or already had a gaming PC.

758
00:58:45,487 --> 00:58:45,839
Scott: Or both.

759
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,158
Rym: Yeah, likely both.

760
00:58:48,705 --> 00:58:50,120
Scott: Which all had GPUs in them, right?

761
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:50,480
Scott: Exactly.

762
00:58:50,900 --> 00:59:04,860
Scott: If somehow the GPU shortage carried on, or the GPU factories exploded, and now we would centralize the GPUs into one place, but maybe not everyone should have a GPU.

763
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,880
Scott: We could talk about that, how it's sort of wasteful.

764
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,960
Scott: People have these powerful, powerful things.

765
00:59:09,262 --> 00:59:13,858
Scott: They're actually really inefficient processors that use lots and lots of electricity, right?

766
00:59:14,903 --> 00:59:22,559
Scott: And people have them just sitting in their computers, we manufactured that, which caused climate damage, and it's like, there's a lot to talk about there.

767
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:36,280
Rym: We could also point out, there's a side argument that we hit a point where from the 1080 onward, a 1080, even today, is good enough to play literally almost every PC game on Earth.

768
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:40,339
Scott: I got a 1070, and I've never found a game that I can't play perfectly.

769
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:46,699
Rym: Yeah, you might not use the most ridiculous render settings 4K 60 FPS launch.

770
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:49,258
Scott: I usually put it on 4K full settings.

771
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,060
Scott: You say that, but what game?

772
00:59:51,180 --> 01:00:02,400
Rym: Name a game that you've run at full, maximum, absolute maximum quality that can be set, 4K 60.

773
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,960
Scott: Let's see, let's go down the list.

774
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,280
Rym: 'Cause I can do that with Overwatch with a 1080.

775
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:15,722
Rym: That is the most GPU-intensive game that I can do that with, with a 1080.

776
01:00:15,722 --> 01:00:17,100
Scott: I mean, I haven't played that many--.

777
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:20,540
Rym: Well, I'm saying this is you don't play games that push the GPUs.

778
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:21,820
Rym: I know what games you play.

779
01:00:21,981 --> 01:00:23,120
Scott: But I do occasionally.

780
01:00:23,942 --> 01:00:25,456
Scott: I've played a bunch of Resident Evil games.

781
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,460
Scott: We played PUBG that one time recently for like an hour.

782
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,920
Rym: You did not turn PUBG to maximum render.

783
01:00:31,624 --> 01:00:31,878
Scott: Yeah, I did.

784
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,640
Rym: Maximum every setting?

785
01:00:34,904 --> 01:00:38,800
Scott: Well, my monitor's 4K, so I put it in 4K, and then I maxed everything else out.

786
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,245
Rym: 16 X MSAA?

787
01:00:41,466 --> 01:00:41,838
Scott: I don't know.

788
01:00:42,281 --> 01:00:43,638
Scott: There's a maximum thing.

789
01:00:44,763 --> 01:00:46,260
Scott: I'm not picking through the settings.

790
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:47,080
Scott: I don't got time for that.

791
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:47,760
Rym: I'm just saying.

792
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,160
Scott: You're not even gonna notice.

793
01:00:49,761 --> 01:01:04,300
Rym: The real point is that most people who are gamers, who play PC games, have a GPU already, and even if you have a pretty old GPU, it is good enough for 99% of all PC games that have ever been made.

794
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:11,320
Rym: In fact, my HTPC, which I'm gonna replace soon, it is-- Mine's got a 1050.

795
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:11,880
Scott: It's good forever.

796
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,715
Rym: Mine is a core-- It's a fifth generation i3.

797
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:18,732
Scott: Mine's an i3.

798
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,160
Scott: I don't know what generation, though.

799
01:01:20,421 --> 01:01:21,927
Rym: It's got a GTX 450 M in it.

800
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:26,498
Scott: All right, that's pretty old.

801
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:34,920
Rym: It can still play a lot of the Steam games that I would play in the living room, and you know what it can do perfectly?

802
01:01:35,761 --> 01:01:37,919
Rym: Steam link to my desktop right here.

803
01:01:38,884 --> 01:01:38,956
Scott: Yep.

804
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:42,339
Rym: So when I build a new HTPC, I'm not putting a GPU in it.

805
01:01:42,701 --> 01:01:47,895
Rym: I'm just gonna get an Intel CPU, because I know those can output 4K 30 to a TV.

806
01:01:48,824 --> 01:01:49,400
Rym: That's all I need.

807
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,016
Rym: I'm good to go.

808
01:01:51,565 --> 01:01:54,098
Scott: There's an argument to be made, actually, for doing the opposite.

809
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,379
Scott: It's where put the massive video card in the HTPC.

810
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:14,280
Scott: Now, when you play games on the monitor with your gamepad and you're having a party, it's gonna be-- And then the rest of your devices in your house, especially if you're an Apple person, you can get all Macs, which can't play games.

811
01:02:14,581 --> 01:02:15,319
Rym: Two problems with that.

812
01:02:15,521 --> 01:02:20,238
Rym: I want an HTPC that's so tiny, I literally tape it to the back of the TV that's mounted on the wall.

813
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:22,260
Scott: I mean, you can do that too, right?

814
01:02:22,982 --> 01:02:26,240
Rym: Two, a good video card is loud as shit.

815
01:02:28,002 --> 01:02:29,293
Scott: Only when it's doing its 3D biz.

816
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,700
Rym: And three, that's not gonna work for Premiere.

817
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,040
Rym: There's no Steam link to make Premiere work on my workstation.

818
01:02:38,704 --> 01:02:43,800
Scott: But I'm saying, if you're an Apple person, the Apple chip can handle Premiere.

819
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:48,859
Scott: The only reason the Apple computers can't play games is because the games weren't made for them.

820
01:02:49,643 --> 01:02:51,337
Scott: But Premiere is made--.

821
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:58,420
Scott: Pretty much everything other than games is already natively running on the M chips out there.

822
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:00,518
Scott: All your Adobe's and everything.

823
01:03:01,601 --> 01:03:18,679
Scott: So it's an option for Apple people to get one Nvidia GPU, basically, put it in a box in the house somewhere, and just use Steam link to stream from it to whatever computer or iPad or iPhone you want to actually play games on.

824
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:23,118
Rym: But basically, right now, today, there's sort of two options for this.

825
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:34,319
Rym: Because arguably, a lot of consoles, they're running the game locally, but they are tied to or restricted in some way based on computers somewhere else.

826
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:35,719
Rym: But that's sort of a separate problem.

827
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:46,560
Rym: But we basically either have, you have a device that streams from the cloud in some fashion, or you have a gaming PC, and you're using something like Steam link to stream within your house.

828
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,760
Scott: Those are sort of the two-- - You can use Steam link from outside your house.

829
01:03:51,602 --> 01:03:54,358
Scott: It works for games that aren't so intensive, obviously.

830
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:00,499
Rym: - It requires a little bit of a moderate amount of knowledge to set that up so it'll actually work.

831
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:01,699
Scott: - Not really.

832
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,660
Scott: You just open up the Steam app on your phone and it connects.

833
01:04:06,261 --> 01:04:11,960
Rym: That is, I have encountered people we know who struggled with that profoundly.

834
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:21,020
Scott: - All right, well, I mean, the point is, it's a really good option, I think, for not the 3D games, right?

835
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:21,171
Scott: - Yeah.

836
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:27,080
Scott: - But like the turn-based type games or the much simpler games.

837
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:32,780
Rym: - Like, look, I can use Steam link and take a sieve turn my fucking iPhone.

838
01:04:33,021 --> 01:04:33,478
Rym: And you know what?

839
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:34,699
Rym: It works.

840
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,438
Scott: - I mean, they do have sieve for iOS.

841
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:38,560
Scott: It is direct.

842
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,940
Scott: They do have a direct version.

843
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,988
Rym: - There's no sieve for iOS.

844
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:44,720
Rym: that'll run on my iPhone natively.

845
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:45,339
Scott: - I think there is.

846
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,396
Rym: - I don't think it runs on the iPhone.

847
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,109
Scott: Is it iPad only?

848
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,140
Rym: - I'm pretty sure it's iPad only.

849
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,479
Scott: - It might be iPad only, but it exists.

850
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,878
Rym: - Also, even if it ran on the iPhone, wouldn't I have to pay for it?

851
01:04:55,141 --> 01:05:01,060
Scott: - Yeah, that is one, Civilization specifically, they fucked it up and you have to buy the game like twice.

852
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,100
Scott: But basically, I still think-- - Other games that might not be the issue.

853
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:15,680
Rym: - Services that stream the games like Stadia did aren't really, like, it'll be hard for them to succeed at scale.

854
01:05:16,462 --> 01:05:20,119
Rym: And I think it's the same problem that happened the last, every time someone's tried this.

855
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:29,074
Rym: One, the average gamer who cares enough about gaming to be playing PC games already and doesn't just have-- - To buy a subscription or pay for some gaming service.

856
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,440
Rym: - Yeah, they do not trust services like that.

857
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:36,658
Rym: Like, the only reason we trust Steam is that it's been around so long and hasn't fucked us.

858
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:39,640
Rym: Nobody trusts anything else.

859
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:43,860
Scott: - Right, now, so there are some scenarios where I think this is gonna work out.

860
01:05:44,061 --> 01:05:48,580
Scott: One scenario where it's already working out is the Xbox Game Pass thing.

861
01:05:49,966 --> 01:05:53,337
Scott: The Xbox Game Pass, I tried to use it once and it didn't work.

862
01:05:54,881 --> 01:05:59,600
Scott: But I have friends who use it and it is kind of a good deal.

863
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,020
Scott: It's like, you pay a subscription and it's sort of like Netflix.

864
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:09,000
Scott: It's like, there's a lot of fucking games on there that you get for a small price, right?

865
01:06:09,141 --> 01:06:14,580
Scott: Some of them might come and some of them might go, but it's like, you just get access to this enormous game library.

866
01:06:15,161 --> 01:06:27,099
Scott: If you're not someone who has an enormous Steam library, it just makes economic sense to get the Xbox Game Pass, get all those fucking games, you know, you can probably beat them in the time that they're on there.

867
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:33,900
Scott: If you're actually playing lots of games, just like, you know, I canceled Netflix and all the other streaming services 'cause I wasn't watching anything.

868
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:39,736
Scott: But if you're actually playing lots of games and you get that subscription, you're gonna get value from it.

869
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,959
Rym: - If that Xbox service existed when we were at RIT.

870
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,699
Scott: - Yeah, it'd be so, you know, I wouldn't have had a pirate games.

871
01:06:49,743 --> 01:06:51,040
Scott: It would be just so many games.

872
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,720
Scott: I'd be like, I can just play that game came out.

873
01:06:52,861 --> 01:06:54,738
Scott: I can just play it right now without paying 60 bucks.

874
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,440
Rym: - And I think that is going to be the evolution of consoles.

875
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:13,559
Rym: I think consoles are basically just purpose-built PCs effectively that will run local games, but also integrate directly and seamlessly with the streaming platform that the company like Microsoft will run for it.

876
01:07:14,181 --> 01:07:16,900
Rym: And I think that's gonna be a big part of the gaming ecosystem.

877
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:25,840
Rym: I don't think those services will capture PC gamers though, because they will never have the coverage.

878
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:30,660
Rym: I think PC gamers are primarily going to continue to be a relatively niche audience.

879
01:07:31,241 --> 01:07:37,439
Rym: And I think they're gonna run games locally or they're going to stream games from some other local device they own.

880
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:46,446
Scott: - Well, you got to run PC gamers also, you know, include all the people who like to, you know, go on itch IO and install all kinds of weird games and emulate things.

881
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:50,219
Rym: - Things that aren't on services.

882
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:54,500
Rym: Stadia is not gonna have like quest for glory 2 on it.

883
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,760
Rym: You're buying that from GOG.

884
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,377
Scott: - It could be, you know, but you never know.

885
01:07:59,883 --> 01:08:03,940
Scott: But you know, but most people are just playing like the games that come out, right?

886
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:10,620
Scott: And so, you know, the consoles, the PlayStations, those actually don't really make money, the hardware.

887
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,380
Scott: They've always, you know, had a razor blade kind of business model from what I've heard, right?

888
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:18,959
Scott: Where they make their money selling the games and the accessories and all those things.

889
01:08:19,582 --> 01:08:22,999
Scott: And the console is just like this loss leader to get you into the ecosystem.

890
01:08:23,843 --> 01:08:33,156
Scott: And if they can do away with the console and sell you just something really cheap, that's just a video out and a network hole or build it into a TV, right?

891
01:08:33,741 --> 01:08:43,359
Scott: Like no more PlayStations, you just buy a PlayStation television, a television that has PlayStation and you buy the subscription to PlayStation that you're just always paying for.

892
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,999
Scott: And now you've got PlayStation games all the time.

893
01:08:46,682 --> 01:08:50,479
Scott: It's like, that's gonna make them more money, I think, if they can get people to sign up for that.

894
01:08:54,667 --> 01:08:58,520
Scott: So the last, did you disappear?

895
01:08:58,819 --> 01:08:59,158
Scott: - I'm here.

896
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:00,218
Scott: - Oh, okay.

897
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,060
Rym: - I just didn't say anything for a second.

898
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:03,479
Scott: - Oh, okay.

899
01:09:03,903 --> 01:09:10,759
Scott: The last streaming game situation is also something Steam has done, which is the Steam play together deal.

900
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:16,300
Rym: - Which is I think an under known and under appreciated feature.

901
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:19,799
Rym: If you don't know what this is and aren't using it, you're missing out.

902
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,359
Scott: - Right, so the way it works is this, right?

903
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:34,180
Scott: So I buy a game and this game that I buy has local multiplayer, either co-op or competitive, but local multiplayer, couch multiplayer.

904
01:09:35,662 --> 01:09:39,260
Scott: But I'm alone at home because as a pandoodle, right?

905
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,359
Scott: And no one is here to play games with me.

906
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:46,880
Scott: And my friend is at home and I paid 40 bucks for this game.

907
01:09:47,502 --> 01:09:53,359
Scott: And my friend doesn't wanna pay 40 bucks, which would then allow us to play network multiplayer.

908
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:57,740
Scott: Normally both people had to buy Counter-Strike and then you play Counter-Strike together.

909
01:09:57,861 --> 01:10:05,275
Scott: You can't, the way this works, as long as the game is a couch co-op game, well, we don't really need two copies.

910
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:05,899
Scott: then, do we?

911
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,759
Scott: Right, let's say it's, I don't know, Goldeneye.

912
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:18,759
Rym: - We just need to get all the inputs from all the players into the game and get the shared single video output, basically multicast to all the people who are trying to play the game.

913
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:29,900
Scott: - Exactly, so I boot up the game on my computer and effectively it uses the same streaming that Steam Link uses to show whatever's on my screen to my friend, Rym.

914
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:37,499
Scott: Now Rym sees the game and I see the game, even though my computer is doing all the work, Rym's computer is just playing video.

915
01:10:38,022 --> 01:10:42,980
Scott: My computer is being a Netflix with one customer, basically.

916
01:10:44,142 --> 01:10:49,320
Scott: And Rym's game pad, all his inputs from his game pad, his computer is sending them to my computer.

917
01:10:49,421 --> 01:10:57,720
Scott: and my computer thinks two game pads are plugged in, even though one of them is very far away over the network and the other one is directly plugged in by USB.

918
01:10:57,881 --> 01:11:07,480
Scott: and now we're playing couch multiplayer co-op or competitive games, even though there's only one video card that has any power to it, right?

919
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:19,220
Rym: - Now some games will get into weird states and not work that well if you have more than two players, but by and large, it does just work and that alone is extremely impressive.

920
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:25,178
Scott: - Especially if your computers are powerful, if your network is good and your computer is powerful enough, at least, right?

921
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:33,760
Scott: Then like I played Streets of Rage 4 co-op this way and you wouldn't know it wasn't local.

922
01:11:34,643 --> 01:11:40,339
Scott: I challenge anyone if I set up two computers, you wouldn't know which one was the one running it natively.

923
01:11:41,184 --> 01:11:42,640
Scott: How would you tell, right?

924
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,773
Scott: Like it would be some audio file, just 50/50 shot, right?

925
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,620
Scott: Guessing which one was the one that was native.

926
01:11:48,944 --> 01:12:11,577
Scott: Some other games you might be able to tell because if the resolution is too high and the network quality isn't perfect, it'll start to like, you'll see the resolution will sort of get a little pixely and such to maintain the frame rate, but it's really amazing and useful technology and it's like, yeah, that's actually a good reason for streaming games.

927
01:12:12,943 --> 01:12:15,640
Scott: And the final reason for streaming games, right?

928
01:12:16,042 --> 01:12:24,259
Scott: That sadly, I think is sort of incompatible with the reasons that no one would stream games is that you can prevent cheating that way.

929
01:12:25,081 --> 01:12:30,459
Scott: If the game is running on some other computer that's under no control of the players, no one can cheat.

930
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:31,679
Scott: How are you gonna cheat?

931
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:34,700
Scott: You'd have to hack into the central system to cheat.

932
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,960
Scott: It's not gonna happen, right?

933
01:12:36,343 --> 01:12:44,060
Scott: You might be able to cheat with like a Quake playing robot or something, but you're not gonna be able to cheat the traditional way that everyone's cheated, right?

934
01:12:44,563 --> 01:12:56,960
Scott: So that can ease the developer burden a lot, not having to worry about cheaters, but any game where anyone would care about real-time cheating is a game where people are gonna care about the latency of the streaming.

935
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,740
Scott: And therefore now no one's gonna play it even though it's cheat proof.

936
01:13:00,921 --> 01:13:07,400
Scott: because the only way the game is playable competitively in which the only time anyone cares about cheating is when it's competitive.

937
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:11,300
Scott: So if it's not competitive, who cares if you cheat?

938
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:13,580
Scott: If it is competitive, great, you stop cheating.

939
01:13:13,927 --> 01:13:14,559
Scott: at what cost?

940
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:16,879
Scott: Latency, now it's unplayable competitively.

941
01:13:17,283 --> 01:13:18,518
Scott: So what are you gonna do?

942
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:19,700
Scott: But that can be solved.

943
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:31,780
Scott: I think there might be a solution where like, maybe for like esports LAN parties, you have a local computer running the game and you stream it out to people on the, right?

944
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:38,160
Scott: And so now this latency is not much of an issue 'cause it's so local and so fast and yet also no cheating.

945
01:13:38,984 --> 01:13:40,037
Scott: It's possible, I don't know.

946
01:13:41,363 --> 01:13:48,819
Rym: So yeah, it's an interesting ecosystem and some things really haven't changed much in the last decade in this space.

947
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:59,900
Rym: And I encourage you if nothing else to try out all the ways this works in Steam because it mostly does just work and is honestly impressive.

948
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:12,299
Rym: And once I build a new HDPC and get a new TV in the other room, that's pretty much, I'm only gonna have one computer that has a video card and everything else is just gonna stream from that computer.

949
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:29,019
Scott: - I mean, as an idea that started out as completely reviling and no gamer would accept it under any circumstance has now shown that there is some merits to it that are positive for everyone.

950
01:14:30,142 --> 01:14:34,479
Scott: But there are still many of the demerits turned out to also be true.

951
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:42,919
Scott: So, but it's gonna be a thing more and more, especially as the technology continues to improve making it even more feasible.

952
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:17,180
Scott: - GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

953
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:20,280
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

954
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:44,398
Rym: - Ervin Von Harl.

955
01:15:45,261 --> 01:15:46,860
Rym: Oh, stop all the downloading.

956
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,258
Rym: Taylor Braun.

957
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:50,556
Rym: And I leave you tonight simply with...
