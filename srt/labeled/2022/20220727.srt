1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,347
Rym: It's Wednesday, July 27th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,347 --> 00:00:09,669
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:13,678
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,023
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:23,401
Rym: Tonight, we are reviewing Sonic X, the anime from 2003.

6
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,398
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:29,020
Rym: And just to respond to the listener, this was not because either one of us lost a bet.

8
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:35,380
Rym: Uh, we just arbitrarily decided at the end of the last show that we would review something.

9
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:39,340
Rym: Scott doesn't pay for any streaming services anymore, and this happened to be free.

10
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:40,546
Rym: It just showed up.

11
00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:42,116
Rym: I saw it at the top of my list.

12
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:42,458
Rym: I'm like,

13
00:00:42,538 --> 00:00:42,820
Rym: "Amazon?".

14
00:00:43,022 --> 00:00:44,092
Rym: And I was like, "All right, fuck it.

15
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:44,658
Scott: Sonic

16
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:44,840
Scott: time.".

17
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,680
Scott: The only streaming service I have is Amazon Prime Video because I have Amazon Prime.

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,800
Scott: And because it's a whole year, it's not like, you know, even if I decide to stop, it's like I still have it for quite a while.

19
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:56,307
Scott: And I'm using it.

20
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:58,300
Scott: I'm watching all the Bond movies on there.

21
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:02,975
Scott: And I'm like, "That's the only streaming service I got, Rym.

22
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:03,839
Scott: What anime do you want to

23
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:04,060
Scott: watch?".

24
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,670
Scott: And he just said, "Sonic

25
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:05,932
Scott: X.".

26
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:06,677
Scott: And I'm like, "Okay,

27
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:06,939
Scott: sure.".

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,426
Scott: He watched Amazon Prime.

29
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:10,793
Scott: He saw what anime was on there.

30
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,180
Scott: I guess that was the one he picked.

31
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:12,701
Rym: Yup.

32
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:14,808
Rym: Because meanwhile, I switched everything.

33
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:17,920
Rym: Right now, Paramount is what we're doing because we're watching, like, every Star Trek.

34
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:23,500
Scott: I'm waiting for a, you know, there are things that I want to watch on some services.

35
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,889
Rym: Wait until there's a critical mass.

36
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:26,320
Rym: Then you, like, make a new Netflix account.

37
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:33,020
Scott: I'm waiting for a single service to have, you know, at least a month's worth of things to watch.

38
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:38,660
Rym: The time for you will be, I think, when Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix.

39
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,720
Rym: By then, there'll be enough of a backlog of good, short stuff on Netflix for it to be worth it for a month.

40
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,260
Rym: Arcane's still one of the best cartoons I've seen in a long, long time.

41
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,340
Scott: I think the other problem is that just, you know, I don't watch a lot of TV, period.

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,940
Scott: It's like, you know, 90% of the things that everyone is watching, I just have no interest in.

43
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:12,660
Scott: So it's like, it takes the streaming, you know, for someone else who watches, you know, I say the average American amount of television, you know, Netflix would fill up with enough stuff for them to watch in, like, a month or two, even if they had, you know, binged a ton of series.

44
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:17,840
Scott: Whereas for me, it could take several years for there to be enough things I actually want to see on Netflix.

45
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,756
Rym: This is the difference between Scott, who ignores 99% of everything, and me, who only ignores 98% of everything.

46
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:24,557
Rym: [Laughter].

47
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:30,579
Rym: So there's a bunch of anime and comic and manga-related news, and one to start with.

48
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:36,580
Rym: So this was a minor incident that shouldn't have been an incident, but it generated enough buzz.

49
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,543
Rym: It's worth talking about.

50
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:42,700
Rym: Mostly, I kind of want to just dunk on Japanese companies for continuing to not understand this.

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:49,380
Rym: So apparently, Anime Expo, there was a panel about Mob Psycho 100 season, like, there's a Mob Psycho panel.

52
00:02:50,261 --> 00:03:02,579
Rym: And they had some sort of exclusive where, at the panel, they were going to show everyone the season 3 opener before other people got to see it.

53
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,965
Scott: And they were like-- And this happens at San Diego Comic-Con.

54
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:17,580
Scott: actually a lot, right, where there's trailers and previews and all kinds of things that they-- Right, it's not screenings like we had at Anime-Cons back in the day where we'd show whole shows and shit, right?

55
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:26,700
Scott: It's like, you come to a panel, they announce something, and then they show you some behind-the-scenes clip or a trailer or something, right, for the thing.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,080
Scott: And that is the first time that thing has been shown to the public ever.

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:43,800
Scott: But, at least for as long as YouTube has been around, the past 5 to 10 years especially, those things end up on YouTube basically right after the panel's over, at the same time the panel starts.

58
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,160
Scott: And also remember, these aren't, like, leaks.

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,534
Scott: At least the same day, right?

60
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:50,800
Rym: These are things that will just be on TV when the show comes out.

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,680
Rym: Like, they'll be on YouTube officially, like, sometimes days after the convention anyway.

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,080
Scott: So, for example, San Diego Comic-Con just happened recently, right?

63
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:11,239
Scott: There was a John Wick panel, they showed a trailer for John Wick 4, and then it was on YouTube the same day, possibly within hours, or I don't know what the timing exactly was, but it was the same day as the panel, within 24 hours.

64
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:16,353
Scott: So, you know, that's just how things are these days, right?

65
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:18,839
Scott: That's just the way of doing things, right?

66
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:30,900
Scott: Some people, for some reason that I don't understand, find value and pleasure in, like, being in the panel room and seeing something, like, a few minutes before the rest of the world.

67
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,396
Scott: And it's like, if you, okay, sure, I don't understand it, there's no logical reason for enjoying that, but have fun, kids.

68
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:49,220
Rym: This is not, like, I don't know, the Denver Fenton Allen thing, where, like, it was this long shared experience, and being there was probably, like, being there was somewhat different and more engaging than seeing the YouTube video.

69
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:57,740
Scott: Right, it's not a concert where it's like, yeah, they're singing the same song you can hear on Spotify, but it's, you know, it's a live performance, it's not exactly the same as, right?

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,429
Scott: This is like, this is a video that is recorded.

71
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:03,540
Scott: Watching it elsewhere is going to be the exact same video.

72
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,320
Rym: It's a minute and 30 seconds of an anime opener that's going to be on TV.

73
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:12,100
Scott: Yes, you will see it, you can watch it to your heart's content at some point.

74
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:31,620
Rym: So, someone, of course, recorded it from the panel and put it on YouTube, and the Japanese company flipped out about it, and there's a big fight among attendees, and people were, like, people were getting into the whole fear that, well, leaks are serious, if you leak stuff like this, then the Japanese companies won't give us these things anymore.

75
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:46,980
Scott: Well, that may be true, because, you know, the Japanese, we've talked on and on, there's no point in talking again about how Japanese companies have the wrong attitude about, you know, sharing their creative works, right, and their artworks on the internet.

76
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,900
Rym: Someone commented on our Utena series today, asking when we'd start it up again.

77
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,524
Scott: Right, it's like, look at, K-pop is taking over the world.

78
00:05:55,604 --> 00:06:11,840
Scott: Korea is a smaller country with a smaller economy, with, you know, basically less, it's smaller than Japan in every conceivable fashion, but yet, their cultural exports are dominating, not just the United States, right, the entire world, right?

79
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:24,000
Scott: South America, Middle East, you know, Europe, K-pop and other Korean television, Korean movies are dominating the world in, like, a Hollywood fashion, right?

80
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,355
Scott: BTS is, like, probably bigger than the Beatles ever were.

81
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,820
Scott: It could be, right?

82
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:30,721
Scott: And why?

83
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:38,052
Scott: Because they just, not only do they upload, like, the official music videos to YouTube, they upload extra shit, right?

84
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:39,133
Scott: Like, everything.

85
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:44,080
Scott: Behind the scenes, practice videos, interviews, right?

86
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:50,308
Scott: Every, like, there's, they just upload fucking everything to YouTube for free, right?

87
00:06:50,728 --> 00:07:00,420
Scott: If Japan did that, Korea would actually, I don't think if Japan suddenly changed its attitude, I think Korea would actually be in big trouble, right?

88
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:09,788
Scott: Because, you know, like, if all Japanese television, just all of it, was translated and on YouTube for free, right?

89
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:20,219
Scott: It's like, you know, if all the mangas were in English, you could just read 'em, it's like, ah shit, it would be trouble for the entertainment, you know, media production of every country.

90
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:20,940
Scott: that wasn't Japan.

91
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,202
Scott: But they don't do that.

92
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:32,075
Scott: And I think the people who are saying, well, if you do these leaks, then the Japanese companies are gonna, you know, not, you know, they're gonna, they're gonna pull back even more.

93
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:32,877
Scott: That's correct.

94
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:33,718
Scott: That's what they're gonna do.

95
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:34,960
Scott: That's how they are, right?

96
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:41,012
Scott: But that's not, that's not, I don't think that's a reason to not leak.

97
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,920
Scott: I think it's just, just deal with it, right?

98
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:51,368
Rym: I would say as, as like some random teen who's like hanging out in an anime con, that just makes the leaks funnier when they happen.

99
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:56,533
Rym: Because like I said, these are not leaks of like something that's actually exclusive.

100
00:07:56,553 --> 00:08:03,280
Rym: That's just a little bit before everyone else will see it in a panel room that people probably lined up for hours for for some reason.

101
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:03,801
Scott: Right.

102
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:07,549
Scott: So even, it's like even the consequence that they're afraid of, right?

103
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:11,437
Scott: Oh, they won't show trailers at the cons early anymore, right?

104
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,900
Scott: It's like, okay, fine.

105
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,908
Rym: I will wait in line for a long time to see a panel that is like the creators I like talking about their thing.

106
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:19,929
Rym: That's the experience.

107
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:22,592
Rym: Showing me a clip from the show I'm already gonna watch.

108
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:28,460
Rym: The show that I care about so much that I waited in line just to see the people who make it that show?

109
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:29,502
Scott: Yeah.

110
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:34,799
Scott: If they stop showing things like this at the cons because they're worried about leaks, who gives a shit?

111
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,883
Rym: I think the cons would be healthier for it, to be honest.

112
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:50,880
Rym: The cons often mistakenly get too close to the industry where the industry is doing things that won't actually draw more people to the con or even make the con experience that much better, but they restrict what the con can do in many ways.

113
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:57,305
Rym: I remember where we really learned this lesson was at PAX's where I remember Civ 5, Civilization 5 was announced.

114
00:08:57,805 --> 00:09:05,051
Rym: and I saw at PAX at a giant booth and you could play like five or ten minutes of it if you waited in this terrifying line.

115
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:09,174
Rym: I saw that booth and I thought, you know, I already preordered this game on Steam.

116
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:13,137
Rym: So why, why even engage with this booth?

117
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:15,258
Rym: I already threw my money down that hole.

118
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,280
Rym: I already threw those hours of my life away.

119
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,180
Scott: It was the time PAX East had the Portal thing and you could play Portal 2 for like a few, you know, some period of time.

120
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:29,960
Rym: I walked up behind someone else playing Portal 2 and said, oh, I think the thing that I am going to play when it comes out is going to be good based on what I see.

121
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,545
Scott: Portal 2 came out just like weeks after PAX East, right?

122
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:35,128
Scott: People waited all that line.

123
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:42,720
Scott: It's like I spent my time at PAX doing something else and then I went and played Portal 2 on my computer just shortly thereafter.

124
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:47,404
Scott: So yeah, it's like Japanese companies, they are the way they are.

125
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:48,285
Scott: They're wrong.

126
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:49,507
Scott: They should change.

127
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:51,830
Scott: But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't leak.

128
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:59,720
Scott: We should, you know, teach them, keep teaching them a lesson and if they don't, if they learn the wrong lesson, that's their problem and the consequences don't scare me at all.

129
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:14,080
Rym: I mean, you know, back when I was the director of like panels and workshops at a convention, remember occasionally there'd be a panel that had like weird like restrictions on like don't let anyone bring cameras or cell phones in and I remember very specifically how I addressed that.

130
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:21,376
Rym: I put up a one sign at the entrance that said like no cameras allowed and that was the extent of my intervention.

131
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:22,900
Rym: Whatever happened, happened.

132
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:24,021
Scott: Yep.

133
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:41,720
Scott: And there's nothing, you know, you can't, if you're in a public place, it's like, it's like, you know, sure there are times where it's rude or wrong or inappropriate or privacy invading or abusive to photograph or videotape people and you shouldn't do it.

134
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:49,372
Scott: But at the same time, you, it's just a, you know, it's a reality of the world, right?

135
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:53,359
Scott: That like it's not all, you're not always going to be able to avoid it.

136
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:56,627
Rym: Well, case in point, you know what I'm not going to do?

137
00:10:57,028 --> 00:10:58,071
Rym: Go to any concert.

138
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:01,080
Rym: that makes me put my cell phone in one of those secure bags until I leave.

139
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:01,944
Scott: Yep.

140
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:02,839
Scott: Never would do that ever.

141
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,201
Rym: Nope.

142
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:05,246
Rym: I would not go to a concert that had that crap.

143
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:06,008
Rym: And you know what?

144
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:07,271
Rym: We saw Hellsy at MSG.

145
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,434
Rym: They didn't give a shit.

146
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:10,138
Rym: Film the whole thing if you want.

147
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:10,760
Rym: They didn't care.

148
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:11,821
Scott: Yeah.

149
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:13,427
Scott: I mean, you know, it is somewhat annoying.

150
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:14,711
Scott: I go to, you know, concert.

151
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:16,618
Scott: I mean, when I was going to some concerts, right?

152
00:11:16,638 --> 00:11:17,280
Scott: There's all these people.

153
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,203
Rym: Well, then there's the opposite problem.

154
00:11:18,223 --> 00:11:22,756
Rym: I stand and there's a million people in front of me all holding their phone up, blocking my view, recording it.

155
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:24,040
Rym: That's a different problem.

156
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,463
Scott: That's slightly annoying.

157
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:26,887
Scott: And I don't understand that either.

158
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:29,213
Scott: Cause it's like only one person needs to do that, guys.

159
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:31,580
Scott: Just as long as that one person uploads it, we're all good.

160
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:31,780
Scott: Yeah.

161
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,488
Rym: Just link to that one YouTube video.

162
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,060
Rym: Every, draw lots on who gets to be the one every concert.

163
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:42,391
Scott: You know, but I guess it's like people, I don't know why people there's like, dude, do people who do that, watch those videos ever?

164
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,957
Scott: Do they go back and watch the video that they recorded at the concert?

165
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,340
Scott: I mean, they do.

166
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,783
Rym: I've never understood that.

167
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:50,166
Rym: Like, but you know, you see this a lot.

168
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:55,480
Rym: You see people who live their lives through their camera and don't actually stop and enjoy whatever it is that they're doing.

169
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,680
Scott: It's like, if I'm at a concert, will I re will I take a photo or a couple of photos and maybe a short video?

170
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,189
Scott: I would definitely take a short video cause that'll be in my short video clip and I'll like upload it.

171
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:09,715
Scott: I'll tweet it or something like that or post it on a discord or 10 seconds.

172
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:18,780
Rym: I might see that video and be like, Oh yeah, that was that concert I saw, you know, back before, uh, before the war.

173
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:20,041
Scott: Yeah.

174
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:27,137
Scott: But it's like, if I really want to relive that exact concert, I know somebody else recorded the whole thing and uploaded it to YouTube.

175
00:12:27,157 --> 00:12:28,580
Scott: So I'll search for it and there it is.

176
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:32,066
Scott: And it's like, why does you don't need that many people doing it?

177
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:39,120
Rym: So, uh, some other news, uh, the television show, well, the Netflix show stranger things.

178
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:48,480
Rym: Uh, there's an article about something happening with stranger things that is happening in a lot more places and has been happening in anime for a long time.

179
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:49,161
Scott: Yeah.

180
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:55,028
Scott: Well, I think the first occurrence of it that was really that I understood was star Wars, right?

181
00:12:55,229 --> 00:12:56,010
Scott: Special edition.

182
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:56,410
Scott: Right.

183
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:04,000
Scott: And that, you know, when the special editions came out, I was like, ah, you know, upgraded version, but we didn't understand until a little bit after that.

184
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,626
Scott: Like, Oh, they're trying to eliminate the original version.

185
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:07,067
Scott: Right.

186
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:12,779
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like the most of the time and throughout history, it's like there was artwork.

187
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:13,340
Scott: Right.

188
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:21,513
Scott: And artwork that got modified would be like a painting that someone painted over, which happens and has happened throughout all of history.

189
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:22,154
Scott: Oh yeah.

190
00:13:22,414 --> 00:13:25,419
Scott: Or a sculpture that somebody would like modify.

191
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:25,920
Scott: Right.

192
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:39,939
Scott: And it's like, um, but when it came to like, you know, books, right, it's like books had additions that were printed, but because they were distributed, the old additions are still out there.

193
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,340
Scott: Right.

194
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:49,993
Rym: Or if, or many times too, when there were new additions or updates or changes to something, even film, anything, oftentimes they were restricted to like correcting an error.

195
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:52,897
Rym: Like if there's a typo in your book, you just correct the typo.

196
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,320
Rym: The typo was not intrinsic to the work.

197
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,420
Rym: Right.

198
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:03,913
Scott: But any form of art or, or publication, basically any publication, something that had a mass printing with multiple copies, right.

199
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:08,860
Scott: Where copies were made in the, you know, it's like, whether it was music or a newspaper, right.

200
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:15,691
Scott: It's like as every printing, every official printing was existing as long as someone preserved it right.

201
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,254
Scott: Video games that had patches.

202
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:19,157
Scott: It's like, you can load up any patch you want.

203
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:20,740
Scott: Cause they're all out there somewhere.

204
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,000
Scott: Right.

205
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:27,690
Scott: Um, you know, you can buy cartridges for SNES games of like every different version of, uh, links awakening.

206
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,571
Scott: Right.

207
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:34,080
Scott: Um, you know, they're really minor differences that most people will never notice, but there, there's some bug fixes in there.

208
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,260
Scott: Right.

209
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:42,907
Scott: So, but now with the streaming times, right, people aren't actually keeping copies.

210
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:48,412
Scott: Pirates are, but most people are not keeping copies of the originals.

211
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:54,478
Scott: And you know, as you know, we stopped buying physical medias or things aren't even released on physical media.

212
00:14:54,678 --> 00:14:57,240
Scott: There aren't non pirate copies of things.

213
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,640
Rym: Yeah.

214
00:14:57,901 --> 00:15:08,793
Scott: So if you're, if you make a TV, let's say you make a movie and you stream it and you decide you want to change, edit, you forgot an edit, but people have already watched the movie and you go and you, you can.

215
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:13,559
Scott: now, if you wanted to, you could just put up a second post, like, you know, director's cut.

216
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,540
Scott: And now people can choose.

217
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:21,860
Rym: Like what happened with the Blade Runner back in the day, there was the original cut, director's cut, The Abyss, movie cut, like home video cut.

218
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:23,722
Scott: You can watch all the cuts.

219
00:15:23,842 --> 00:15:29,048
Scott: You can pick whichever one you want, but, uh, we have a situation here with Stranger Things.

220
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:32,952
Scott: They're going back and they're editing the episodes that are on there.

221
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:40,720
Scott: So if you were to watch Stranger Things now, you would not see it in the form in which it was originally streaming.

222
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,564
Scott: Unless you went and got a pirated copy somewhere.

223
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:44,225
Scott: That's right.

224
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:52,877
Scott: It's like, and it's sort of back to the olden days of painting over a painting and re chiseling a sculpture where it's like the original is gone.

225
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:53,217
Scott: ish.

226
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:54,138
Scott: Right.

227
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:55,320
Scott: Except for pirates.

228
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,763
Rym: And may or may not actually be a deep problem.

229
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:07,594
Rym: Like, for example, uh, Sailor Moon Crystal, a lot of anime airs on TV, just busted, just like bad animation errors everywhere.

230
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:10,017
Rym: And then they basically fix the whole thing.

231
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:12,280
Rym: And then they release it on other formats later.

232
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:13,421
Scott: Yeah.

233
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:14,442
Scott: I mean, a lot of manga.

234
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:19,110
Scott: when it's published in its original, you know, magazine is not the same.

235
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:25,019
Scott: You know, it gets changed a lot when they go and republish it in the, the, the talk of on compilations.

236
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,360
Scott: Right.

237
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,682
Rym: Here's a totally separate example.

238
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:29,644
Rym: Say I have a website with some stuff on it.

239
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:37,252
Rym: Very few websites post a change log where you can look at every iteration of that website that they have ever had.

240
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:40,135
Rym: You can't go see Wikipedia has a log.

241
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:40,936
Rym: Yeah.

242
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:42,357
Rym: Wikipedia does have a log.

243
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:44,899
Rym: Not many websites do, nor would I expect them to.

244
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:45,961
Scott: Nope.

245
00:16:46,682 --> 00:16:52,654
Scott: Uh, but you know, newspapers, I think should, you know, all these big newspapers have some responsibility to show what the edits were.

246
00:16:52,694 --> 00:16:56,100
Scott: There is a website that like tracks the edits to newspapers and such.

247
00:16:56,841 --> 00:17:02,249
Rym: But I guess there's a lot going on here because there's no like hard pronouncement to make here.

248
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:03,891
Rym: Some aspects of this are good.

249
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:10,359
Rym: Like, you know, a show is out, someone notices a minor error, like you've like a compositing error and you fix it like cool.

250
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:12,842
Rym: Uh, someone changes the plot.

251
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:17,366
Rym: Someone like alters some dialogue that gets into different territory.

252
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:34,420
Rym: Uh, but it also starts edging into the opposite argument of fans almost get too entitled to the works to the point that a lot of fans freak out and demand access to all these like sub iterations for their own entitled enjoyment of the show and not for any archival purposes.

253
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:34,761
Scott: Yeah.

254
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:41,393
Scott: It's like, as if, you know, while we look at Star Wars and we're like, yeah, the original one is the, is the good one.

255
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:44,820
Scott: That's not a hard and fast rule at all.

256
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,207
Rym: No, that's, that's actually one of the rare cases.

257
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:49,415
Rym: Hillyman Crystal, the new version is what everyone intended.

258
00:17:49,656 --> 00:17:50,780
Scott: The early version was just rushed out.

259
00:17:50,840 --> 00:18:01,150
Scott: Just because this, this idea that people have that just because something was like the first published edition, that's somehow the real edition, the end, right?

260
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,533
Scott: It's like, it's like, actually that's not necessarily the case.

261
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:11,920
Scott: You know, I mean, if given a set of additions of something, yeah, one of them will be like better, right?

262
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,882
Scott: Yeah.

263
00:18:12,922 --> 00:18:14,587
Scott: People may be equal and different.

264
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:15,750
Scott: People may disagree.

265
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,640
Rym: Go ask a random person which Blade Runner cut they like and you might start a knife fight.

266
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:20,940
Scott: Right.

267
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:22,908
Scott: But you know, sometimes it's more clear cut, right?

268
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:26,200
Scott: You know, the Aliens director's cut is the best.

269
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,840
Rym: Aliens is only the proper version of Aliens has those auto turrets and that full auto turret scene.

270
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:33,205
Scott: Exactly.

271
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:35,500
Scott: I didn't realize that until somewhat recently.

272
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,262
Rym: Oh, the Abyss.

273
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:36,823
Rym: Go look at that.

274
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:42,420
Rym: The Abyss was cut way more than I thought between theatrical and later releases.

275
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:43,440
Scott: Right.

276
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,563
Scott: But here's, so here's an example.

277
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:46,046
Scott: We'll go back to K-pop again.

278
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:52,400
Scott: This actually happens quite more often than you would think where they'll put out some video.

279
00:18:52,781 --> 00:19:03,120
Scott: Usually it's usually happens more like the official music video has a problem and there'll be something in the video that is controversial or causes an uproar of some kind.

280
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:03,681
Scott: Right.

281
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:07,292
Scott: And they are very responsive to up roars.

282
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:07,693
Scott: Right.

283
00:19:07,753 --> 00:19:10,040
Scott: It's like they'll fire people for up roars.

284
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,251
Scott: They'll cancel people's contracts for up roars about small things.

285
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:13,512
Scott: Right.

286
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:15,680
Scott: Unproven things, proven things, whatever.

287
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,021
Scott: Right.

288
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:23,540
Scott: So like for example, I've seen cases where like someone was wearing a shirt in a music video and they didn't speak English.

289
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:33,220
Scott: They didn't realize that the, what the shirt was saying, and then they'll go and they'll take the music video down, edit it, make a whole new one and upload it to different, the original one's gone.

290
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:33,561
Scott: Right.

291
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:39,980
Scott: They'll upload a music video and one of the people they'll have a TV show and they'll record the whole show.

292
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:40,742
Scott: Right.

293
00:19:40,902 --> 00:19:47,360
Scott: And they're going to put another episode, but in between the last episode and this episode, somebody was, uh, had a scandal, right.

294
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,888
Scott: Or at least what they would be would considered a scandal in Korea, not in the U S right.

295
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:58,400
Scott: Um, they'll edit, re edit the whole episode to remove that person as much as, as possible, blur them out.

296
00:19:58,841 --> 00:19:59,864
Scott: And it's like completely.

297
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:04,876
Scott: And then, you know, it's like, they'll do all kinds of takedowns and re uploads.

298
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,099
Scott: And sometimes it's good.

299
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,300
Scott: Right.

300
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,425
Scott: It's like, Oh, we accidentally did a racist.

301
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:09,227
Scott: Let's remove it.

302
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:09,608
Scott: Right.

303
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,853
Scott: Oh, there was some bad audio quality.

304
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:12,555
Scott: Let's fix it.

305
00:20:12,736 --> 00:20:14,360
Scott: You know, take it down, put up a different one.

306
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,272
Scott: So sometimes it's good.

307
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:17,220
Scott: Sometimes it's bad.

308
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,665
Rym: Overwatch, how many versions of Overwatch have come out?

309
00:20:19,705 --> 00:20:20,568
Rym: They just changed the game.

310
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:21,591
Rym: You can't play the old version.

311
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:22,934
Rym: The new versions Counter Strike.

312
00:20:23,175 --> 00:20:24,499
Scott: They added a whole new gun.

313
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:26,640
Scott: True.

314
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:27,302
Rym: Yeah.

315
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:34,780
Rym: So, uh, this is just a space like, like, you know, usually GeekNights, we tend to bring up a topic and then be like, and here's the way.

316
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,484
Rym: But here, this is just a big messy space where there's a lot of room for discussion.

317
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:56,340
Scott: I think, you know, on the one hand, I think that if you are making a significant popular preservation worthy artwork, that all of your additions should at least be saved somewhere for archival historical purposes.

318
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,768
Rym: Obviously not necessarily any pre-release work.

319
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:02,574
Rym: You don't need to keep the changelog of the premiere project for the 10 years.

320
00:21:02,614 --> 00:21:05,080
Scott: But it would be, it would be really nice for people to keep that.

321
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,683
Rym: It would be cool if people kept that.

322
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:09,589
Rym: That's the kind of stuff I think would really be interesting to society.

323
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:14,980
Scott: Especially people want to go back and, you know, someone needs to come and do a study on it, you know, years later and make a documentary.

324
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:23,791
Rym: So, for GeekNights, I actually do keep the raw recording session full, in full, for a year for every episode before I purge them.

325
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:28,357
Rym: And I keep the raw original audio forever.

326
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:30,940
Rym: But the actual session I get rid of after a year.

327
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:31,621
Scott: Yeah.

328
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:41,720
Scott: But, you know, it's like, you know, even just someone to do, like, you know, I go to see a museum exhibit at, you know, and it's like they have all these, you know, production, you know, art packs.

329
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:51,875
Rym: Or hell, look at what happens every time someone gets a hold of the original studio recording of any famous band's work with every individual track broken out.

330
00:21:52,216 --> 00:21:54,940
Rym: That is always a recipe for someone doing something amazing.

331
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:55,841
Scott: Yep.

332
00:21:56,062 --> 00:22:00,709
Scott: Anyway, but you should preserve these things, right?

333
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:05,236
Scott: But it's like sometimes there's good reasons to edit, sometimes not.

334
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:08,040
Scott: And we're going to have to judge on a case-by-case basis.

335
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:17,880
Scott: If somebody, you know, does paint over a painting or re-chisel a sculpture or, you know, edit something that's streaming only and now no one can see the old versions.

336
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:23,380
Scott: We're going to have to see what they changed and then judge that individually over whether it was good or not.

337
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:23,760
Scott: Yep.

338
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:38,674
Rym: So speaking of leaks from before, a while ago, this was years ago, we talked about on GeekNights, there was an animation test for a Sony Pictures Popeye movie with Tartakovsky.

339
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:40,836
Rym: Like, Tartakovsky worked.

340
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:41,997
Rym: 3D, it looked amazing.

341
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:45,180
Rym: Like, this animation test looked phenomenal.

342
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:47,772
Rym: And nothing, we never heard of it again.

343
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:48,920
Rym: That movie just never went anywhere.

344
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,625
Scott: Yep, that shit, this happens a lot, right?

345
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:57,617
Scott: It's like, you know, something will be not, you know, made or partially made, right?

346
00:22:57,697 --> 00:22:58,960
Scott: And sometimes announced.

347
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,348
Rym: Sometimes finished, sometimes a movie will be done.

348
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:06,480
Rym: Like, in the can, completely ready, and it just never gets released.

349
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,300
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, you know, we've had cases like Mouse Guard Movie or, um, what was the other one I was thinking of?

350
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,960
Rym: I mean, Nothing Lasts Forever is like the archetypical example.

351
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:17,619
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, that was released-ish.

352
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:18,451
Rym: Yeah, ish.

353
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:19,783
Rym: Ish.

354
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,488
Rym: So, this Popeye movie got way further than any of us realized.

355
00:23:25,548 --> 00:23:26,749
Rym: Now, it's funny, this is a leak.

356
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,372
Rym: I watched a bunch of it.

357
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,034
Rym: I didn't think to save it.

358
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:34,200
Rym: I'm sure you'll find it somewhere, but it has now been taken down by Sony.

359
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:41,629
Rym: But someone uploaded to YouTube an entire 87 minute long animatic.

360
00:23:41,729 --> 00:23:43,612
Rym: It is basically the entire movie.

361
00:23:44,152 --> 00:23:46,175
Rym: An animatic, like, ready to rock.

362
00:23:46,215 --> 00:23:50,000
Rym: They were basically one step before starting principal animation on this show.

363
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:53,145
Rym: And, or this movie.

364
00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:54,368
Rym: And they just never made it.

365
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:57,960
Rym: And the worst part is, from what I watched, this movie would have been amazing.

366
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:07,592
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, people spent, Hollywood, you know, big people with lots of money, you know, spend a lot of money, you know, taking things pretty far, right?

367
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:13,260
Scott: You know, they spent, when they option scripts, it's like they're paying screenwriters for those scripts, even if they don't use them.

368
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,166
Scott: You know, they're not paying much, they're paying something, right?

369
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:21,958
Scott: It's like, you know, people are buying, licensing rights to make things based on properties, right?

370
00:24:22,018 --> 00:24:23,020
Scott: And then they don't make them, right?

371
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:24,784
Scott: A Kira live action movie.

372
00:24:24,824 --> 00:24:26,829
Scott: Someone paid for that and worked on it.

373
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,372
Scott: Evangelion live action.

374
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:29,836
Scott: Someone paid and worked on that.

375
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:30,918
Scott: It never happened, right?

376
00:24:30,978 --> 00:24:31,640
Scott: It's still not out.

377
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,786
Scott: But it's like, there's money that goes into producing things and they just don't finish, right?

378
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:49,518
Scott: And so I think the lesson to learn here is, A, artifacts that are created from those unfinished things could still have value, entertainment value, because there is quality there.

379
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:51,540
Scott: There is artwork that someone put effort into.

380
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,079
Rym: Hell, I would say as a selfish capitalist.

381
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:03,320
Scott: If there are legal avenues to release those things, then the people who possess those legal rights should maybe consider doing it because you can, you know.

382
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:12,960
Rym: Well, case in point, take those assets, release them, and if they get a big response, now you've got market evidence that if you make the real movie, it'll sell.

383
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,823
Scott: That's if they actually cared, right?

384
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:25,180
Scott: And then I think B, though, is that if you have access to these things, you should, I encourage you to illegally release them for the good of the collective world culture.

385
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:45,060
Scott: And C, right, is that if you are a person who is making, you know, whether it's art or any kind of creation, right, crafting software, whatever it is you're working on, and it's like you start 10 things and you can't finish anything, right?

386
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:49,891
Scott: And it's like, and then, you know, it's like you never get anything published or done or whatever.

387
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:54,200
Scott: You just keep starting stuff and you can't get anything over the finish line like GeekNights' website.

388
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:02,680
Scott: Don't feel bad because for every movie that Hollywood fucking makes, there's like 10, 20 movies, however many that they just don't finish, right?

389
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,923
Scott: It's like you just don't see those.

390
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:08,967
Scott: So you think that like everything they start, they finish.

391
00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:14,855
Scott: It's like, no, it's like, you know, they're, you know, big time authors start in 20 books.

392
00:26:15,015 --> 00:26:18,720
Scott: that for every book that makes it to the shelf on the virtual shelf.

393
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:21,809
Scott: They started like a whole bunch of books that didn't get put, right?

394
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:25,320
Scott: It's like very few artists out there are finishing everything they start.

395
00:26:27,343 --> 00:26:28,685
Rym: So one last little news.

396
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:37,740
Rym: I didn't think I'd ever talk to them in GeekNights, but, you know, one of the things I take a certain amount of perverse pleasure in is watching a fan convention implode.

397
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Rym: Like big convention drama is something I, it entertains me from a distance, but at the same time, I never want to be involved in it.

398
00:26:47,521 --> 00:27:00,460
Scott: I think it's definitely a privilege of having a relatively drama free existence that I can watch drama and read about drama that may or may not, I don't even care if the drama is true or not.

399
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:01,962
Scott: It doesn't really matter, right?

400
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:08,312
Scott: I basically, you know, like consider, I don't, you know, I assume it could be true or false.

401
00:27:08,332 --> 00:27:12,980
Scott: It doesn't matter to me, but it's like I read it as I read about dramas as if they're stories.

402
00:27:13,802 --> 00:27:16,468
Scott: And they're often very entertaining.

403
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:21,400
Scott: And if they're true, that much the better, as long as the drama goes the right way.

404
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,987
Scott: It's the same reason people watch like, you know, a Judge Judy or whatever.

405
00:27:26,108 --> 00:27:28,793
Scott: It's like other people's drama, right?

406
00:27:28,954 --> 00:27:30,978
Scott: Or that subreddit, am I the asshole?

407
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:31,820
Scott: Same thing, right?

408
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:37,210
Rym: I think part of it too is that we, we have pointedly really only, and COVID of course mess everything up.

409
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:43,000
Rym: We only go to very well run conventions and we have very strong opinions about how to run conventions as well.

410
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:51,480
Rym: And usually when there's big convention drama, it is the convention that is doing the kinds of things that we specifically say you should not do, pretty much across the board.

411
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,669
Rym: So there is an anime convention that you should all just be aware of.

412
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:57,872
Rym: It's called Anime Matsuri.

413
00:27:58,353 --> 00:28:01,420
Rym: And it is the worst anime convention in the world.

414
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,104
Scott: It is like the worst that we know of.

415
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,447
Scott: It's in Houston, Texas, right?

416
00:28:05,587 --> 00:28:05,788
Rym: It is.

417
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:06,690
Rym: It's pretty big.

418
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,260
Scott: It's been around for a while because that name seems like there could be other cons with that name.

419
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:12,422
Rym: I'll link to it.

420
00:28:12,662 --> 00:28:20,895
Rym: I'll link to some stuff so no one confuses, but it, they've been sued like more than 10 times by their own guests.

421
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:23,540
Rym: They had at least one guest deported because they fucked up.

422
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:40,520
Rym: They, they're the con who not only kept inviting Vic Mignona and like the bad people around that whole sex pest situation after the court case, but they doubled down on featuring him prominently and supporting him and supporting his sexual harassment like openly.

423
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:41,441
Scott: Right.

424
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:46,450
Scott: This wasn't a case of like, oh, we didn't know cause we don't pay attention to the internet, right?

425
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:50,978
Scott: We just said, wow, this guy, you know, cause there are cons out there that in good faith, right?

426
00:28:51,018 --> 00:28:51,980
Scott: It's like they didn't know.

427
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,025
Scott: They just said, wow, this guy's a famous voice actor, right?

428
00:28:55,045 --> 00:28:59,112
Scott: He actually did voice act all these, you know, big time roles.

429
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:01,056
Scott: Um, we're an anime con.

430
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:03,200
Scott: It's like, he's going to sell us tickets.

431
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:03,661
Scott: Why?

432
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,063
Scott: You know, they don't know anything about him.

433
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:10,591
Scott: They don't know any about the drama and they bring them in this con with pretty much no doubts, right?

434
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:13,716
Scott: They knew exactly what they were doing, right?

435
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:16,180
Scott: They are openly the bad people.

436
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:24,080
Rym: They invite like right wing YouTubers from the, uh, that movement that harasses the people that Vic Mignona was harassing himself.

437
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,900
Scott: Somebody who would be banned from a decent convention is likely to be a guest of honor at Anime Matsu.

438
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:34,508
Rym: It is amazing how most of their guests are people banned from other conventions.

439
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,994
Rym: Uh, but also like their lines are terrible.

440
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:39,440
Rym: Like everything about this con is bad.

441
00:29:40,622 --> 00:29:42,971
Scott: And they're not managing the con well, right?

442
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,420
Scott: They're just focused on just being bad.

443
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:57,480
Rym: So this, this fucking con, uh, has spun up a company that is going to be a dubbing studio and they are collaborating with good old Vic Mignona.

444
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,599
Rym: And they're, they're basically, their take is we're going to take dubbing back from the SJWs who ruined it.

445
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:05,479
Scott: Okay, sure.

446
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:07,168
Rym: With hookers and blow, I assume.

447
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:09,480
Rym: Like this is just a shit show scam, obviously.

448
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:17,480
Rym: But, uh, I just really need to make sure nobody who listens to GeekNights accidentally goes to this fucking anime con.

449
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,880
Scott: Who, who that has an anime license is going to hire them to dub their anime?

450
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,101
Scott: Nobody.

451
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:22,244
Scott: Absolutely nobody.

452
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:27,080
Rym: This has got to be like an actual scam, but I can't prove it because I'm not close to the details.

453
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:34,000
Rym: I also don't want to get sued, but if they sued me, I'm pretty sure in discovery we would find out that this is not a healthy company.

454
00:30:34,947 --> 00:30:35,458
Scott: You don't say.

455
00:30:36,382 --> 00:30:37,400
Rym: That is my opinion.

456
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:46,140
Scott: But yeah, I think there, you know, it is a problem in that, you know, there are websites that like, you know, catalog all the different conventions out there.

457
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:51,560
Scott: Like animecons.com is like a terrific resource that shows you all the anime cons, all the info about them and everything.

458
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,413
Scott: But they're not reviewing the, they're not giving you the real scoop on the con.

459
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:57,637
Scott: Like, is it well run?

460
00:30:57,657 --> 00:30:58,379
Scott: Right?

461
00:30:58,479 --> 00:30:58,619
Scott: Etc.

462
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:01,065
Scott: They're just sort of giving you informational stuff.

463
00:31:01,105 --> 00:31:06,940
Scott: This is when it is, these are who the guests are, this is when it started, this is how many years it ran, years it didn't run, attendance, etc.

464
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,159
Rym: Controversies!

465
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:09,280
Scott: Right?

466
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:17,000
Scott: We need, you know, for all the problems that get, arise when you have, you know, reviews online of things, right?

467
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,419
Scott: You know, fraudulent reviews, you know, bullshit reviews, etc.

468
00:31:21,261 --> 00:31:21,401
Scott: Right?

469
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:25,680
Scott: Like Yelp and Amazon, you can see how much problems there are with their review systems.

470
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:38,960
Scott: But for all those problems, I think that those systems, at least when they're moderated sufficiently, which is not out of the realm of possibility, they are a net benefit to the greater, you know, population.

471
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,980
Scott: You know, you could tell it's like, yeah, there might be a bunch of fake Yelp reviews, but you can tell just by looking at them, whether it's a restaurant you want to go to.

472
00:31:48,480 --> 00:32:03,660
Scott: We need some kind of review system for cons so that, not just for people who probably just know the cons in their area and aren't likely to go to any others, but for guests and vendors who are likely to go to many cons, right?

473
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:15,080
Scott: It's like they, you know, it would be very helpful to them, especially to have, you know, more detailed info about what a con is like so that when they get a letter that's like, hey, do you want to come to this con?

474
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:24,740
Scott: Or they're thinking about going to set up a booth at a con, whether it's a good idea or not, they'd have more to go on because there just isn't that much info on the internet to help you.

475
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:25,441
Rym: Yup.

476
00:32:25,461 --> 00:32:31,360
Rym: Of course, at the same time for PAX, you'd probably see tens of thousands of reviews where people say the expo hall isn't big enough.

477
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:32,500
Scott: Yeah.

478
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:36,780
Scott: I mean, you would see all kinds of, you know, but it's like you could, it's better than having no information.

479
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:36,940
Scott: Yup.

480
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,848
Rym: Well, plus, you know, I would apply to that kind of review.

481
00:32:39,868 --> 00:32:41,472
Rym: That would be a positive review in my eyes.

482
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,320
Rym: because one thing I do, this is such a reliable method.

483
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:53,180
Rym: If I'm trying to figure out if a restaurant is good to eat at, I will look at a few five star reviews, unlike Google Maps or whatever, and just see if they're talking about the food.

484
00:32:54,061 --> 00:33:01,640
Rym: And if they are, and there's a lot of good reviews, I would then look at several one star reviews and I'm looking for something specific.

485
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:10,300
Rym: If all the one star reviews are complaining about the service as opposed to the food, the people doing those reviews are probably bad people and the restaurant is probably amazing.

486
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:11,540
Scott: Yeah.

487
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:13,606
Scott: I mean, I'm only looking for good food, right?

488
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:14,548
Scott: I don't really care.

489
00:33:14,989 --> 00:33:19,280
Scott: It's like there is a point at which service is so bad that it becomes a problem.

490
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,460
Rym: Like the one time you and I considered dining and dashing.

491
00:33:23,641 --> 00:33:23,863
Scott: Right.

492
00:33:24,186 --> 00:33:25,599
Scott: But it is quite rare.

493
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:26,821
Scott: Yeah.

494
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:38,000
Rym: Well, usually what I'm looking for specifically is there's a certain kind of like entitled, "I was here with my children and the wait staff didn't smile at them and they are

495
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,220
Rym: trying.".

496
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:41,979
Rym: That is a sign of a good restaurant if you see that kind of one star review.

497
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:49,100
Rym: Because the waiter who did not smile at that horrific child is the kind of waiter I want waiting at my table.

498
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,240
Scott: Yeah.

499
00:33:50,502 --> 00:33:53,440
Scott: A reasonable human being who doesn't take shit from assholes.

500
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,165
Rym: So things of the day.

501
00:34:02,185 --> 00:34:10,280
Rym: I try to avoid doing the same YouTube channel like too often as a thing of the day, but Captain Disillusion does not upload videos that frequently.

502
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,132
Scott: Because he puts so much time and effort into them.

503
00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:14,480
Scott: They can't make them that frequently.

504
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:21,920
Rym: He's the kind of guy who just disappears into a cave for what feels like a decade and he just staggers out and hands us a triumph on YouTube.

505
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:23,760
Rym: So last night.

506
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,859
Scott: But he was actually working on it the whole damn time.

507
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,221
Scott: Yup.

508
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:32,739
Rym: Last night, I was sitting in front of the HDPC and I got a little ding because he uploaded a video.

509
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:34,493
Scott: You have the bell on.

510
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:36,299
Rym: I have the bell on.

511
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,088
Scott: It's actually an advantage actually I think to uploading rarely.

512
00:34:41,592 --> 00:34:44,299
Scott: Captain Disillusion is probably the perfect example of this on YouTube.

513
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,225
Scott: It's like I don't give anyone the bell on YouTube.

514
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:54,179
Scott: There is no case in the world where I need to be immediately notified that a video has been uploaded to YouTube.

515
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,047
Scott: Like I'll go to YouTube on my own.

516
00:34:56,108 --> 00:34:58,620
Scott: I'll click subscriptions and I'll see it when the time comes.

517
00:34:59,482 --> 00:35:03,140
Scott: It's not something I need to be distracted from whatever I'm doing to know about.

518
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:17,920
Scott: But if the bell, I think the only time it would be acceptable is if somebody makes particularly high quality videos such that you want to see all of them and they upload videos rarely.

519
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,419
Scott: And Captain Disillusion, that's exactly what he is.

520
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:20,781
Scott: Yup.

521
00:35:21,122 --> 00:35:23,973
Rym: So this video is pretty amazing.

522
00:35:23,993 --> 00:35:25,740
Rym: It's actually relevant to some of our news as well.

523
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:32,140
Rym: So he collaborated with a Japanese band, Atarashi Gako, like a girl group.

524
00:35:32,582 --> 00:35:34,320
Scott: Who I had never heard of but they seem cool.

525
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,558
Rym: And he made three short music videos for them with his like quality.

526
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:41,260
Rym: Like good god.

527
00:35:41,961 --> 00:35:53,838
Rym: And he broke down in detail exactly how to make them and it is a 22 minute case study in how trippy, modern, amazing music videos are made for real practically.

528
00:35:54,579 --> 00:35:55,360
Rym: In detail.

529
00:35:56,361 --> 00:35:59,080
Scott: Plus commentary on the YouTube copyright review.

530
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,986
Rym: Oh yeah, I was about to bring that up also.

531
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:05,740
Rym: He has the correct opinions on the way copyright is enforced on YouTube.

532
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:11,100
Scott: And also the correct opinions on what music videos are the best.

533
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:17,659
Rym: I was about to say, so he shows a lot of music videos in the background and like speaks to them and references them.

534
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:29,040
Rym: Literally, without exception, 100% of the videos he mentions or shows at any point are in my good music videos playlist on YouTube already.

535
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,797
Scott: Yup, pretty much.

536
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:33,164
Rym: So this video is a triumph.

537
00:36:33,565 --> 00:36:39,838
Rym: and now we know how the correspondents made that ridiculous video with them running around in a circle.

538
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:40,759
Rym: So what do you got?

539
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,600
Scott: So usually, you know, people, there's a hobby of making models, right?

540
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:53,240
Scott: Shipping a bottle, model rocket, model train, Gundam model, car model, military models.

541
00:36:53,661 --> 00:37:03,480
Scott: It's a big, big hobby making models, but most people when they make models, all they're really doing is making a miniature look alike, right?

542
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,820
Scott: It's like, you know, so if like you make a model plane, it's like, it's not going to work.

543
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:10,565
Scott: It's not made of the same material.

544
00:37:10,846 --> 00:37:15,639
Scott: It's probably just plastic in the same shape as the thing.

545
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,080
Scott: you're right.

546
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:25,720
Scott: You're making an object that looks like a much larger object on the surface, but is not actually structurally the same as that actual object, right?

547
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:33,020
Scott: If you were going to make a model, you know, space shuttle, the bottom would not be made out of heat proof tiles, right?

548
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:35,334
Scott: It would just be black plastic on the bottom.

549
00:37:35,435 --> 00:37:36,160
Scott: and that's it, right?

550
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:45,560
Scott: So and if someone did make a model space shuttle at like 1/100 scale or something and the bottom was made of heat proof tiles, I want to see that because that's awesome.

551
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:52,840
Scott: So this dude in this video makes a model suspension bridge, which is cool.

552
00:37:53,422 --> 00:37:57,660
Scott: And he makes that model suspension bridge out in the woods, which is extra cool, right?

553
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,859
Scott: Usually people are making models inside, right?

554
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,416
Scott: Who makes models like out in nature, right?

555
00:38:03,261 --> 00:38:06,540
Scott: He found like a small stream to make the suspension bridge over.

556
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:11,700
Scott: I don't even know if it qualifies as stream, but you know, it's a small amount of water.

557
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,039
Rym: I would say this is a crick, maybe a creek, more like this is a crick.

558
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:19,779
Scott: A long puddle, whatever, I don't know.

559
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:33,940
Scott: But he's, you know, he's got a, has a body of water of some size to make a small suspension bridge over, but he constructs the suspension bridge much like a real suspension bridge with, you know, cement.

560
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:41,100
Scott: I don't know if it's concrete, concrete, but it's definitely cement, you know, metal reinforcement, like tiny rebar, I guess.

561
00:38:41,524 --> 00:38:42,580
Scott: Your wires to, right?

562
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:44,500
Rym: It's like, that is what set me over the edge.

563
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,460
Rym: The tiny rebar is delightful like that.

564
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,420
Rym: That made this great, right?

565
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,160
Scott: Like tiny twisted cables for the suspension part.

566
00:38:53,380 --> 00:39:01,420
Scott: It's like he's at, it's somewhat structurally similar to an actual full size suspension bridge.

567
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:11,360
Scott: So those two factors, the outside factor and the real like construction factor make this really unique and awesome.

568
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:13,380
Scott: And I'm sad it's only in like a Twitter video.

569
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:20,340
Scott: I wish I, if someone has a link to like a YouTube video or any, I don't even know if it's the original source, but like a better source anywhere.

570
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:21,576
Scott: Let me know.

571
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,359
Rym: Yeah.

572
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:26,560
Rym: If I found this like out in the woods, that would be amazing.

573
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,039
Scott: That would be amazing.

574
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:30,920
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book.

575
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,699
Rym: It's a short book.

576
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,900
Rym: We're probably going to show on it next week on Thursday.

577
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,979
Rym: It should not take you long to read.

578
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:37,858
Scott: Maybe Tim, maybe.

579
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,255
Scott: I didn't even buy it yet.

580
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,360
Rym: We could wait.

581
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:44,200
Rym: We'll do it either next Thursday or more likely the following Thursday episode.

582
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:50,500
Rym: But Binti by Nnedi Okorafor and Space University is always a thing that we are into.

583
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,060
Rym: So I think this would be a good read.

584
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,360
Rym: And we are very much considering.

585
00:39:55,222 --> 00:39:57,619
Rym: Let us know if you think this is a good idea or a great idea.

586
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:04,720
Rym: Moving into a format where each book club book, whoever's turn it is to pick, presents two options.

587
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:08,000
Rym: And then the other of us chooses which of the two will be read.

588
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,677
Scott: Ah, would you like to read Poop or Diarrhea?

589
00:40:14,327 --> 00:40:14,979
Scott: Ah, would you like to?

590
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:16,520
Scott: We could go the other way though, right?

591
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,620
Scott: Because it's like, you know, would you like to read the chocolate or the other chocolate?

592
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:24,300
Rym: There's going to be a lot of fun with this.

593
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,040
Rym: It's also another.

594
00:40:26,082 --> 00:40:29,600
Rym: It's a good safety mechanism to prevent another Genji.

595
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,020
Rym: Though, I am more than willing to put a certain very long novel, which is not The Count of Mind and Crystal.

596
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,859
Rym: I actually have something.

597
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,258
Rym: I was about to say worse.

598
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,519
Rym: It's definitely a better book and I've never actually read it.

599
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,738
Rym: I don't know if you read.

600
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,240
Rym: I do not know if you've ever read it either.

601
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,243
Rym: So.

602
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:47,499
Scott: War and Peace?

603
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:48,860
Rym: Nah, nothing.

604
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,719
Rym: Well, I was about to say nothing like that.

605
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,311
Rym: But that's actually not 100% true.

606
00:40:54,543 --> 00:40:56,880
Rym: I'm going to wait until we decide if it's my pick or not.

607
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,120
Rym: I've picked the two books I'm going to put before you and I'm really curious.

608
00:41:00,662 --> 00:41:05,740
Scott: Of those large books that I just mentioned, the only one I've read the beginning of Crime and Punishment.

609
00:41:06,302 --> 00:41:07,840
Rym: Oh, Crime and Punishment's not even that long.

610
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:09,439
Rym: He's got way longer books.

611
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:11,400
Scott: I know, but I'm just saying, of those ones that came to mind.

612
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,756
Rym: I've read Crime and Punishment twice.

613
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,939
Rym: It's actually my favorite of his works.

614
00:41:15,863 --> 00:41:15,980
Scott: Yeah.

615
00:41:16,561 --> 00:41:17,740
Scott: You think I've actually completely read any of his works?

616
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,860
Rym: You know what's the most called a cough?

617
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:30,720
Rym: Also, I will be live at PAX West 2022 on Sunday, September 4th, 1230 PM Pacific Time in the Sasquatch Theater.

618
00:41:30,842 --> 00:41:32,100
Rym: That's the big one in the Sheraton.

619
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,239
Rym: With a panel.

620
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:36,699
Rym: I'm bringing back an old topic with a completely new lecture.

621
00:41:38,086 --> 00:41:38,315
Rym: Losing.

622
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,299
Rym: Going to talk about losing.

623
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,219
Scott: It's probably not completely new.

624
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,040
Rym: It actually will be completely new because.

625
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,700
Scott: Probably just saying all kinds of stuff we've said ten times before.

626
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,258
Rym: Nah, you know what it's more like?

627
00:41:48,661 --> 00:41:52,800
Rym: The other losing panel that I did by myself at PAX Australia because you didn't come.

628
00:41:53,582 --> 00:41:54,638
Rym: It's a new version of that.

629
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:03,480
Scott: One thing I do want to say though about PAX West this year is that I saw some confirmations of some large industry returning.

630
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,239
Scott: And that's I guess a good sign for PAX.

631
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:10,840
Scott: And also I saw that Reggie, who I guess, I don't know what his job is now, but he's on a panel there.

632
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:15,780
Scott: It's like, it's a, you know, it's not a. obviously ask Reggie everything you wanted to know panel.

633
00:42:16,444 --> 00:42:19,220
Scott: Even though some people will hijack the Q&A and try to make it that.

634
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,680
Scott: He's on a panel with some other people discussing like some other topic.

635
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,700
Scott: But it's like, that's still really cool to see someone like Reggie just out of PAX on a panel.

636
00:42:30,321 --> 00:42:33,840
Scott: Even if it's not, you know, the things you want to hear him saying.

637
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:40,040
Scott: But I feel like he already had his, you know, sort of tell all that he's willing to tell interview that you can read.

638
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,660
Rym: Yeah, I think he's at the point where we're not going to learn any new bombshells until he's on his deathbed in distant future.

639
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,546
Scott: I don't think we're going to learn.

640
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,179
Scott: I don't think there's any bombshells left to know.

641
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,224
Rym: Nah, you never know.

642
00:42:50,244 --> 00:42:52,878
Rym: There's always surprising bombshells.

643
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,300
Rym: But yeah, getting a little sick of COVID because I got to make it clear.

644
00:42:57,961 --> 00:42:59,108
Rym: I'll be doing this panel.

645
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:01,060
Rym: I got some other work to do around PAX.

646
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,620
Rym: But if you were there, I will not be hanging out in the con playing board games.

647
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,760
Rym: I'll be in working and I'll be out like in Seattle doing outdoor things otherwise.

648
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,208
Scott: Yeah, and I got a new job.

649
00:43:13,248 --> 00:43:15,620
Scott: And even though my new job, I never work on Friday.

650
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,951
Scott: I don't have, I basically have zero vacation days right now.

651
00:43:19,353 --> 00:43:20,459
Scott: I actually used one.

652
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,062
Scott: So I'm in the negative.

653
00:43:23,082 --> 00:43:30,180
Scott: Even though I only used one PTO day, then I'm not going to use another one for probably some months.

654
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,140
Scott: So, you know, but I will have enough for holiday times to take extra days.

655
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:35,564
Scott: You never know.

656
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:36,677
Rym: We might, uh, PAX Unplugged.

657
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:40,260
Scott: Plus, I only have to use four to get a whole week off, right?

658
00:43:40,681 --> 00:43:40,946
Scott: Right.

659
00:43:41,353 --> 00:43:41,740
Rym: I doubt.

660
00:43:42,681 --> 00:43:44,159
Scott: And I still accrue as many, so.

661
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:50,460
Rym: I doubt we will go to PAX Unplugged and play games in the con because it's still going to be a mass event, which makes that difficult.

662
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,087
Rym: But not out of the realm.

663
00:43:52,127 --> 00:43:53,916
Rym: We could do a joint panel again at PAX Unplugged.

664
00:43:53,936 --> 00:43:54,600
Rym: We'll see how things look.

665
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,620
Scott: Yeah, I'm hopeful for PAX Unplugged, but I'm not locking anything in.

666
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,241
Rym: Yeah.

667
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:03,280
Rym: I mean, I will definitely be there doing a panel by myself if you don't come.

668
00:44:04,063 --> 00:44:05,688
Scott: I would like to go, right?

669
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,980
Scott: But we had to see what the circumstances are, so, you know.

670
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,258
Rym: Yeah, we will see.

671
00:44:12,482 --> 00:44:13,748
Rym: So, Sonic X.

672
00:44:14,491 --> 00:44:23,400
Scott: I, uh, the only Sonic- Well, before we talk about Sonic X, right, I just gotta say, when I was a kid, right, there were two Sonic cartoons on TV, right?

673
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,130
Scott: And I think both of them were just called Sonic the Hedgehog.

674
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,080
Scott: I don't know how many other kids of the 90s remember this.

675
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,948
Scott: One of them was, like, syndicated on TV.

676
00:44:32,988 --> 00:44:35,034
Scott: You could see it on all your local channels.

677
00:44:35,094 --> 00:44:36,197
Scott: It was really easy to watch.

678
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:37,020
Scott: It was on all the time.

679
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:43,613
Scott: And it was mostly a poorly animated comedy episodic thing, right?

680
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,940
Scott: And it focused on Scratch and Grounder as, like, the bad guys.

681
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,817
Scott: They were sort of like a bebop and Rocksteady kind of deal, right?

682
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:53,487
Scott: And I did enjoy that as a kid.

683
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:57,600
Scott: I don't know how much it holds up now, but it had a charm to it, right?

684
00:44:58,601 --> 00:45:04,520
Scott: It was much closer to, like, the Mario Brothers cartoon that was in the Mario Brothers Super Show, right?

685
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:08,320
Rym: I think that one was the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog.

686
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,263
Scott: Maybe.

687
00:45:09,545 --> 00:45:11,180
Scott: I'm sure we could Google it and get the right answer.

688
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,158
Rym: I am trying to Google it.

689
00:45:12,981 --> 00:45:19,797
Scott: There was another Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon that was on TV at literally the same time, like, concurrently on TV.

690
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:20,980
Scott: I could watch one one day.

691
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,079
Rym: Yeah, so that one was Adventures of Sonic, and it only ran for one year.

692
00:45:26,081 --> 00:45:29,651
Rym: And at 1993, the one you're about to talk about ran for two years.

693
00:45:29,871 --> 00:45:30,212
Rym: '93 to '94.

694
00:45:30,232 --> 00:45:32,980
Rym: And it was just called Sonic the Hedgehog.

695
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,229
Scott: Right, so the one called Sonic the Hedgehog was, like, a special one.

696
00:45:36,329 --> 00:45:39,520
Scott: It was, for the time, well animated, right?

697
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,769
Scott: It was on Saturday morning cartoons only at a special time.

698
00:45:43,789 --> 00:45:45,794
Scott: Like, you couldn't see it otherwise.

699
00:45:45,854 --> 00:45:48,420
Scott: It wasn't just on whenever, you know?

700
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:55,896
Scott: And it was, like, a serial plot with all kinds of characters, right?

701
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:58,143
Rym: It was, you know, much more akin to, I think- The hell?

702
00:45:58,163 --> 00:45:59,630
Rym: They were both made by Deke?

703
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:00,674
Rym: Why were there two?

704
00:46:00,735 --> 00:46:01,839
Rym: Now I don't know why there were two.

705
00:46:03,421 --> 00:46:03,862
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

706
00:46:04,243 --> 00:46:07,370
Scott: But anyway, so that one was, like, the real deal one.

707
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:11,160
Scott: And I, you know, the thing with that one is, like, I wanted to watch it.

708
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:19,280
Scott: But because it was only on at, like, a certain time, and it was serial, it's, like, you would watch it, and I tried to watch it, and I didn't know what the hell was going on.

709
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:26,658
Scott: So I didn't enjoy it, and I didn't get to watch it from the start, and it's not like I was gonna, what was I gonna do in 1990, whatever.

710
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,677
Scott: Buy all of it on VHS if that was even possible, download it, get a DVD box set.

711
00:46:32,697 --> 00:46:33,640
Scott: It's, like, I'm sure I could now.

712
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:41,580
Rym: Oh my god, this Wikipedia article, the second one, the better one, considered one of the darker incarnations of Sonic.

713
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:42,660
Scott: Yeah, it was.

714
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:47,226
Scott: It was a dark, like, serious serial adventure, you know, storyline.

715
00:46:47,286 --> 00:46:58,960
Scott: Anyway, but, so, I knew, right, you know, I stopped watching television mostly around early 2000s, so I knew that there were more Sonic cartoons that had come out after those two.

716
00:46:59,581 --> 00:47:04,540
Scott: But I didn't know which ones they were, I never watched any of them, I never, I didn't know their names.

717
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,235
Rym: So there aren't actually that many more, so you know what the next one after that was?

718
00:47:08,255 --> 00:47:09,460
Rym: And it was way later.

719
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,171
Rym: Sonic X. No, 1999, Sonic Underground.

720
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:20,840
Scott: Oh right, but Sonic Underground was a continuation, that was a continuation of the dark one, basically.

721
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:26,967
Rym: So Sonic Underground was the third and final one made by Deke, and it also only ran for one year.

722
00:47:26,987 --> 00:47:37,340
Rym: And then, in 1999, and then in 2003, the longest running Sonic the Hedgehog with three seasons was Sonic X that we just started watching.

723
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,679
Scott: Alright, what came after that?

724
00:47:39,021 --> 00:47:40,982
Rym: Sonic Boom in 2014.

725
00:47:40,982 --> 00:47:41,999
Scott: Oh, Sonic Boom.

726
00:47:43,926 --> 00:47:45,459
Scott: Is there any more since then, or is that it?

727
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,220
Rym: No, that's it, there's only five Sonic cartoons.

728
00:47:47,961 --> 00:47:53,660
Scott: So I had never heard of Sonic X or watched Sonic X until yesterday, I watched like three or four episodes, I forget how many.

729
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,317
Rym: I watched six.

730
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,038
Scott: That's a lot.

731
00:47:56,505 --> 00:47:56,939
Scott: It is a lot.

732
00:47:57,725 --> 00:47:58,678
Scott: I wouldn't have made it through six.

733
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,060
Scott: Yeah, I was right.

734
00:48:01,021 --> 00:48:03,019
Scott: Spoilers on my opinion of Sonic X.

735
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,280
Rym: I will say this, before we, we'll talk about it at the end, some things we learned about the production.

736
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:08,299
Rym: That's true.

737
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,760
Scott: But my opinion is not, I guess, might not be the true opinion.

738
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:14,089
Rym: But what I will say is that, one, it's an anime.

739
00:48:14,169 --> 00:48:16,960
Rym: Like, it is an anime, it aired in Tokyo first.

740
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:17,743
Scott: Yeah, I didn't know that.

741
00:48:18,165 --> 00:48:21,300
Scott: I started, I thought it was just a US show, but it wasn't, it was an anime.

742
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:29,553
Rym: Yup, TMS Entertainment, like it fully produced in Japan, like there's a whole- It was a lot like Pokemon, right?

743
00:48:29,634 --> 00:48:30,120
Scott: It's an anime.

744
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:36,540
Rym: It was on TV Tokyo, and if I have to say anything about it, one, it's a perfectly good kid's show.

745
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,400
Scott: Like, if I was a kid- Oh yeah, there's nothing offensive about it for kids.

746
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:44,640
Rym: Not just offensive, this was better than any fucking cartoon I watched as a kid.

747
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:46,579
Rym: In America.

748
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:48,200
Scott: I mean, it's not Thundercats good.

749
00:48:49,622 --> 00:48:53,760
Rym: Ah, Thundercat, well, one, you said- You implied that Thundercats was good.

750
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,560
Rym: Thundercats is good by some definitions of the word good.

751
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,656
Scott: Thundercats is better than Sonic X.

752
00:48:58,141 --> 00:48:59,540
Rym: Eh, I think they're similar.

753
00:49:00,022 --> 00:49:03,122
Scott: It's better than American Sonic X. Yeah, yeah.

754
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:11,520
Rym: But, uh, the funny thing about it is I did not realize Sonic X is where that Gotta Go Fast song actually seems to come from.

755
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:12,579
Scott: I didn't know that either.

756
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,160
Rym: And I think that's only in the American release.

757
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,280
Scott: I didn't even know that Gotta Go Fast was a song, I thought it was just a thing being read in relation to Sonic the Hedgehog.

758
00:49:19,961 --> 00:49:29,669
Rym: We have only watched the American release, which was for kids, so they called out all the drinking, and sex, and violence, and you might say, "Wait, were there drinking, sex, and

759
00:49:29,689 --> 00:49:30,092
Rym: violence?".

760
00:49:30,313 --> 00:49:31,200
Rym: And the answer is yes.

761
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,460
Rym: This Sonic takes place in modern day Earth.

762
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,644
Rym: Sonic and the crew and Dr.

763
00:49:36,684 --> 00:49:43,820
Rym: Robotnik are transported to Earth, and it's just, they're fucking around with humans, and giant robots are fighting, and it's kind of violent.

764
00:49:44,301 --> 00:49:44,940
Rym: It's, uh, not what I expected.

765
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,560
Scott: Yeah, I mean, according to the internet, this was heavily edited.

766
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,400
Scott: I don't know, I can't actually comment on the editing because I haven't seen the original, right?

767
00:49:52,500 --> 00:50:02,020
Scott: So I'm sort of reviewing this sort of messed up, edited American version that's been censored, and dubbed, and whatever, because that's all I have access to easily, and all I'm willing to put the effort into.

768
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:11,220
Scott: But yeah, it's totally believable that the original anime version was probably way better, and darker, and superior in every way.

769
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:18,260
Scott: But I don't know how good that original one was, because I can't see it, or at least I'm not willing to go through the effort of seeing it.

770
00:50:18,481 --> 00:50:22,659
Rym: I did realize that I don't know the names of most Sonic characters watching this.

771
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,979
Scott: I mean, I knew the names of Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, Eggman.

772
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,920
Rym: I knew Amy, and then there's the Annoying Rabbit, and the little pet.

773
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,640
Scott: I didn't know the cream cheese name until they said it in the show.

774
00:50:34,961 --> 00:50:36,187
Rym: Also weird that Dr.

775
00:50:36,227 --> 00:50:38,680
Rym: Robotnik calls himself Eggman, I always thought that was the pejorative.

776
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,319
Scott: Oh, you don't know the truth about that, do you?

777
00:50:40,601 --> 00:50:43,800
Rym: I always assumed that that was the pejorative that his enemies used.

778
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:46,887
Scott: Oh, so here's the truth about Robotnik Eggman.

779
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:52,140
Scott: for anyone who doesn't know, because I looked this up a while ago, because I was also confused.

780
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,451
Scott: So, in Japan, his name was always Eggman.

781
00:50:55,531 --> 00:50:56,555
Scott: It was never Robotnik.

782
00:50:56,615 --> 00:50:57,779
Scott: Never.

783
00:50:57,819 --> 00:50:58,000
Scott: Never.

784
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,108
Scott: His name was just Dr.

785
00:50:59,188 --> 00:51:00,760
Scott: Eggman, that's the name, right?

786
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:08,813
Scott: In America, somebody, without permission from the Japanese, just decided to go with this Dr.

787
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:12,960
Scott: Robotnik name in the instruction manual, or for whatever, you know, they just did it.

788
00:51:13,322 --> 00:51:13,544
Scott: Right?

789
00:51:13,605 --> 00:51:15,340
Scott: I guess during localization, or who knows?

790
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,640
Rym: Well, think about what happened with M. Bison.

791
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:18,901
Scott: Right.

792
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:27,100
Scott: Well, M. Bison had some reasons, but yeah, someone just fucking did it, and for the release of Sonic 1, they just did it, and the release to the rest of the world.

793
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,533
Scott: So, Japan didn't even realize this happened, right?

794
00:51:30,774 --> 00:51:32,320
Scott: And they were like, fuck, right?

795
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,352
Scott: And basically what happened is, they had this divergence where the whole world was calling him Dr.

796
00:51:37,392 --> 00:51:39,337
Scott: Robotnik, and in Japan, he was Dr.

797
00:51:39,417 --> 00:51:40,420
Scott: Eggman, and that was it.

798
00:51:41,843 --> 00:51:44,539
Scott: And the Japanese were upset, and they wanted to fix it.

799
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:50,580
Scott: So, I think what happened is, around the time of Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast or something, right?

800
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:56,428
Scott: They basically came up with a way to where they were like, look, his real name is Dr.

801
00:51:56,488 --> 00:52:04,240
Scott: Robotnik, but basically his nickname is Eggman, and everyone calls him Eggman, no one calls him anything else, right?

802
00:52:04,561 --> 00:52:14,140
Scott: It's like, we're just only gonna say Eggman from now on, and there's only maybe one or two properties out there that actually have both names used.

803
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:25,020
Scott: And afterwards, every Sonic property after that point only says Eggman, even though it's canon that his real name is Robotnik, whatever.

804
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:28,719
Scott: No one says anything except Eggman, the end.

805
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:32,580
Scott: But it's the same character, it's not like a different character.

806
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:37,657
Rym: I did not expect Scott to drop the deep Sonic lore in this episode.

807
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:44,040
Scott: It was something that bothered me a long time ago, and I looked it up a long time ago, and I somehow remembered it.

808
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:54,720
Rym: So, the plot is roughly, it's actually like, it's just a serial plot until it gets into sort of a monster of the week after that, but even the monster of the week always drives the plot forward.

809
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,235
Rym: The plot is basically, Eggman has all the Chaos Emeralds, like it's done, he won.

810
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:00,560
Rym: He's about to use them.

811
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:05,260
Rym: Sonic attacks the machine, very much like what happens in the first episode of The New He-Man.

812
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:22,080
Rym: And all of them get transported to modern-day Earth, reverse Isekai, and on one hand, if I had to summarize this show, it is just cops eating shit over and over and over again.

813
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,489
Rym: The cops are in every episode.

814
00:53:25,693 --> 00:53:27,660
Rym: They're the AD police of this universe.

815
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:43,160
Rym: Sonic shows up, and immediately, a bunch of American cops surround him with guns, and are extremely aggressive, and also are constantly eating donuts, and being failures, and just disastrously handling the situation.

816
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:51,620
Scott: I mean, there's an episode I watched where Sonic had to make an E.T.-style rescue from what's basically Area 51.

817
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,200
Rym: Oh yeah, Area 99.

818
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,064
Scott: A military installation, right?

819
00:53:55,365 --> 00:54:02,720
Scott: And my favorite part of that episode was the cop part, because this is where I was able to notice the edits most starkly.

820
00:54:02,801 --> 00:54:03,117
Scott: Oh yeah.

821
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:11,675
Scott: There was a scene in which there are multiple military soldiers with MP5s, like, straight up.

822
00:54:11,935 --> 00:54:13,237
Scott: MP5s, right?

823
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:14,700
Scott: It's like, they're just guns.

824
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:20,599
Scott: And when they start shooting them, the sound effects are like lasers, like pew pew pew.

825
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:33,780
Scott: And it's like, you just know, I haven't seen it, but I'm like 90% confident that if I get the original Japanese, that those guns are going to be going bang bang bang, like MP5 noises, right?

826
00:54:35,962 --> 00:54:38,500
Scott: And you know, it's like, yep, there it is.

827
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:46,700
Scott: So Sonic appears, so there's- But that's how hardcore the show is, is you have military people with MP5s trying to blast Sonic with submachine guns.

828
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:48,384
Rym: The president gets involved.

829
00:54:48,404 --> 00:54:55,060
Rym: later, the military gets fully involved, there's spies, the plot, you know what this actually kind of is?

830
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:04,080
Rym: Take a Spider-Man-like story with a superhero, and it's just superheroes and supervillains fighting in this city, and that's kind of what the show is.

831
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:11,894
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I do somewhat appreciate that, you know, you don't have this, because it sort of has a combination, right?

832
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:19,900
Scott: You get deeply involved with some random rich kid, right, who doesn't even need to be there.

833
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:20,860
Rym: Sonic almost just leaves the kid.

834
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,280
Rym: Well, because you need the annoying insert kid, that's the Wesley Crusher of this show.

835
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,040
Scott: Exactly.

836
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:34,380
Scott: But it's like, they do keep that part, which I don't like, but the fact that yes, the government recognizes it, that's a rarity, like Bocorano has that.

837
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:41,940
Rym: I was about to say, Bocorano is like one of the few shows where the weird shit happens, the first thing the kids do is basically call 911, and then the military shows up.

838
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:52,460
Scott: Right, there's too many things out there, or stories out there, where something happens, and the government and the institutions of the world take no notice, and it's like, what?

839
00:55:53,020 --> 00:56:01,340
Rym: But I love how an anthropomorphic magic hedgehog appears on a city street, and immediately what happens, a bunch of cops show up and try to kill him.

840
00:56:02,221 --> 00:56:13,060
Scott: Yeah, it's like, it's somewhat real, you know, it's not fully realistic, but at least there's some element of reality and common sense to it, despite still being a children's cartoon.

841
00:56:13,801 --> 00:56:18,720
Scott: But what I don't like, though, is the whole transport to Earth thing to begin with, right?

842
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:27,980
Scott: It's like, I always feel like, you know, they do that in kids shows, if it's not taking place in Earth, they feel like they had to bring it to Earth, you know, or have human characters.

843
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:32,140
Rym: You know, in season three, they go back with the kids and some humans to the other world.

844
00:56:32,982 --> 00:56:35,380
Scott: Well, we're going to talk about that, and I did research on that.

845
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,100
Scott: You know, and the example I want to use here is Transformers, right?

846
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:46,800
Scott: It's like, Transformers is fine with all the characters being transforming robots on Cybertron, right?

847
00:56:46,921 --> 00:56:50,180
Scott: With, you know, it's like, that's all we need, that's the good part, right?

848
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:58,700
Scott: It's like the Earth part, it's like, we don't need that shit, but the people who make kids shows feel like they need to bring it to Earth to make it relatable to humans and have human characters.

849
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:08,360
Scott: Though at the same time, it was- Yeah, fucking don't, you can have all anthropomorphic characters on an alien planet, you don't fucking need Earth or humans or anything, get that, you know, we don't need it.

850
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:15,537
Rym: Of course, that is a trope that happens in other Sonic properties too, and it is fun to see- My Little Pony did it too!

851
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:24,040
Rym: Yeah, but it is fun to just see, you got, you know, basically you've got this handful of Sonic characters, otherwise they're just like, they're fighting with cops in the street.

852
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:38,574
Scott: Yeah, I mean, that part is, you know, there are, I'm not saying no one should tell that sort of reverse isekai story, that it's an invalid story, but if I get the vibe that it was done because the marketing.

853
00:57:38,614 --> 00:57:44,780
Scott: people feel like they need to make something relatable to kids who live on Earth, and that's the reason for it, then it gives me a bad taste.

854
00:57:45,121 --> 00:57:52,799
Rym: But what I really appreciated is in episode 1, the cops fail, so then the cops call the super cops- The cops drive Formula 1 cars.

855
00:57:53,140 --> 00:58:08,940
Rym: Yep, and they go into weirdly specific detail about these Formula 1 cars to make sure this is a competition of speed, as the worst cops go after Sonic, and of course, they get crushed, Sonic just destroys them, basically.

856
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:10,132
Scott: Yep.

857
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,703
Rym: But as this progresses, Dr.

858
00:58:13,743 --> 00:58:26,100
Rym: Robot- well, Eggman does just try to take over the world, because frankly, the Sonic characters are more powerful than any human, and even Robotniks like shitty robots are way more powerful than any tanks the military can bring to bear.

859
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:27,020
Scott: Yep.

860
00:58:27,581 --> 00:58:37,680
Scott: I mean, it is a problem, I do think, though, with the Sonic characters, right, in that, you know, the female Sonic characters are more useless.

861
00:58:38,303 --> 00:58:41,500
Rym: Well, now Amy busts out her hammer and fucks some shit up in later episodes.

862
00:58:42,421 --> 00:58:45,400
Scott: Oh, okay, the Amy I saw tried to hammer something pointlessly.

863
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,048
Rym: Yeah, she's more useful.

864
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:48,860
Rym: The one who's actually useless is Knuckles.

865
00:58:50,320 --> 00:59:00,760
Scott: Well, Knuckles is very useful, it's just, he's got this sort of, like, at least the acting in the US version we saw was kind of meh, I'm imagining the acting of Knuckles in the original was better.

866
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:05,219
Rym: Eggman tricks Knuckles into portraying Sonic, like, four episodes in.

867
00:59:06,341 --> 00:59:10,520
Scott: Yeah, but he's just got this, like, he's just got this attitude for, like, no reason.

868
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:13,834
Rym: But that's Knuckles' whole character, in every property I've ever known.

869
00:59:13,855 --> 00:59:14,960
Rym: Attitude for no reason.

870
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:26,159
Scott: Right, it's like if you want to be the troubled loner who goes your own way, right, it's like, you know, like Shadow the Ninja or whatever, that's cool, that character, that trope, that cliche, that's out there, we can have that if you want it.

871
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,677
Scott: But Knuckles just has no reason for it.

872
00:59:29,381 --> 00:59:31,519
Scott: Or at least they don't present a reason for it.

873
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,571
Rym: Eggman shows up, he's like, "Knuckles, Sonic is bad, and you should work with me,".

874
00:59:35,712 --> 00:59:37,316
Rym: and the Knuckles is like, "Actually, that makes sense,".

875
00:59:37,336 --> 00:59:38,660
Rym: and then he immediately attacks Sonic.

876
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,506
Scott: Right, it's like Knuckles is like, "I gotta go my own way,".

877
00:59:41,586 --> 00:59:45,196
Scott: it's like, "Alright, you gotta go your own way, okay, where are you going?

878
00:59:45,497 --> 00:59:45,998
Scott: What are you

879
00:59:46,058 --> 00:59:46,339
Scott: doing?".

880
00:59:46,781 --> 00:59:47,785
Rym: You know where he's going?

881
00:59:47,905 --> 00:59:51,320
Rym: He just, he walks off-scene, and then just sits there, as far as I can tell.

882
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,445
Scott: Yeah, he just walks out, and then he's lonely.

883
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:59,200
Scott: It's like, he just doesn't, you know, he's just like, the only reason he walked away is because he's too insecure to act.

884
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,523
Rym: Meanwhile, that other, the other character.

885
01:00:00,543 --> 01:00:02,689
Scott: He doesn't actually have anything else he's doing, or another plan.

886
01:00:02,709 --> 01:00:06,900
Rym: I guess Cream, like the bunny character, it seems like she just moves from tube to tube.

887
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:10,379
Rym: She is, anytime she appears, she's just trapped in one of a series of tubes.

888
01:00:11,523 --> 01:00:11,660
Scott: Yeah.

889
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:30,600
Rym: So, Eggman eventually starts attacking, like just brings robots to the city, but that's where the toys come in, because the first thing he does is bust out a robot that he calls Missile Wrist via some special trading cards that I learned are actually something that was being sold.

890
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:36,000
Rym: There was like a cross-promotion, and Missile Wrist, the toy, just looks like a blow-rent Zaku, basically.

891
01:00:36,901 --> 01:00:37,539
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

892
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:47,195
Rym: And yeah, they destroy a bunch of buildings, the mayor comes out, almost dies, and the show just seems to do nothing but escalate.

893
01:00:47,235 --> 01:00:48,857
Rym: Every episode is just an escalation.

894
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:50,620
Rym: 6 in, it was still escalating.

895
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,764
Scott: Yeah, so about the third season you mentioned, right?

896
01:00:54,785 --> 01:01:01,957
Scott: So the research I did suggests that when the show was made, they made 52 episodes, which is a lot.

897
01:01:02,017 --> 01:01:03,820
Scott: That's two full seasons, right?

898
01:01:04,201 --> 01:01:11,358
Scott: And at the end of episode 52, I looked at the episode descriptions on Wikipedia, there is an ending to this show.

899
01:01:11,419 --> 01:01:11,900
Scott: It ends.

900
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,360
Rym: Oh yeah, it's a terrible secretive space.

901
01:01:15,781 --> 01:01:21,649
Scott: Yeah, there is an ending on episode 52, but Japan was like, "Alright, we're done with

902
01:01:21,669 --> 01:01:21,829
Scott: that.".

903
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:29,840
Scott: The show was, I guess, popular enough outside of Japan that the US sent money and ordered another season.

904
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:37,073
Scott: So the third season was made by the same studio, it had Japanese voice acting and everything, right?

905
01:01:38,356 --> 01:01:40,680
Scott: But much like Big O season 2, I guess.

906
01:01:40,801 --> 01:01:42,930
Rym: I was about to bring up Big O as another example of that.

907
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,260
Rym: Big O was more popular here than it was in Japan.

908
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:49,106
Scott: Right, it's like they wouldn't have made it, but they got paid to make more.

909
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:53,313
Scott: So that third season is really sort of a new show.

910
01:01:53,393 --> 01:01:57,340
Scott: They come up with a new plot to carry forth.

911
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:03,029
Scott: You can see a similar thing if you watch the original Macross television show, right?

912
01:02:03,069 --> 01:02:08,900
Scott: It's like after a certain number of, like 26 episodes, there's some number of episodes, there's like an ending.

913
01:02:10,981 --> 01:02:12,783
Scott: I guess I shouldn't spoil that, I don't know.

914
01:02:12,843 --> 01:02:15,226
Scott: It's as old as me, it's a 40 year old show.

915
01:02:15,646 --> 01:02:26,920
Scott: But there's an ending, and then they sort of continue the plot for another 13 episodes or so with the characters who are still alive after the ending.

916
01:02:29,461 --> 01:02:33,669
Scott: And then a second, less ridiculous ending, right?

917
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:36,976
Scott: Because the first ending was like the real climactic ending, right?

918
01:02:37,016 --> 01:02:39,280
Scott: So it's sort of like that, right?

919
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:45,214
Scott: It's like there was an ending, and then okay, we'll just have another season, but the other season's really a new show, kinda.

920
01:02:45,354 --> 01:02:47,780
Scott: Just picks up where the previous one left off.

921
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,163
Rym: But yeah, I don't really need to watch any more of this.

922
01:02:50,925 --> 01:03:01,020
Rym: I will never fully understand the extreme nature of the Sonic the Hedgehog fandom, because there aren't that many properties or that many cartoons.

923
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,372
Scott: I think if I had been born 5 to 10 years later...

924
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:05,883
Rym: Yeah, I can see that.

925
01:03:05,923 --> 01:03:10,380
Rym: If this was on TV when I was like 7, I would have been a Sonic kid instead of a masked kid.

926
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:17,234
Scott: If this was on TV at the right time, I would have been watching it and enjoying it and been all over it.

927
01:03:18,517 --> 01:03:24,434
Scott: And then I would have become... It's like instead of growing up with an NES and then 16-bit consoles...

928
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:27,719
Rym: Oh, you might have been a Sega kid!

929
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:38,760
Scott: Right, if you were a kid who was old enough for this show to be on TV when you were 8 or something like that, that means that you were having a dreamcast in the prime of your life.

930
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:51,480
Scott: So, when we were in college or whatever, some kid was at home with a dreamcast as their main console, playing Sonic Adventure as the way we played Mario World or whatever.

931
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,344
Scott: And it's like, that's why.

932
01:03:54,704 --> 01:04:03,480
Scott: That kid's gonna be a big-time Sonic kid in Sonic X, while it might not hold up so much the same way that He-Man doesn't hold up so much.

933
01:04:04,281 --> 01:04:19,820
Scott: It's like, I can see why kids who grew up with this were way into it, and I can see why anime nerds who may have seen the real version of this that wasn't edited, like the one we saw, might actually have some reason to appreciate the quality of the show.

934
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:31,660
Rym: Well, you know, case in point, I saw the real Sailor Moon when I was pretty young, and I got fan subs of the stuff that wasn't on American TV, and I got way into it because it was way different from what they showed in America.

935
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:33,564
Scott: Yep, exactly.

936
01:04:33,684 --> 01:04:36,249
Scott: So, yeah.

937
01:04:36,489 --> 01:04:37,010
Scott: It's a show.

938
01:04:37,071 --> 01:04:37,572
Scott: It exists.

939
01:04:37,652 --> 01:04:41,800
Scott: I don't think anyone who isn't a child should watch it.

940
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:50,540
Rym: It is worth watching the first episode just to watch basically the AD police eat shit over and over and over again.

941
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:55,107
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, there are just some funny things that you can see.

942
01:04:55,127 --> 01:05:02,864
Scott: I think this is a good show to- Oh, yeah.

943
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:08,331
Rym: And he's like eating donuts the entire time while he's yelling constantly.

944
01:05:09,193 --> 01:05:11,600
Rym: The cops are just a tour de force in this show.

945
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:12,700
Scott: Yeah.

946
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:18,668
Scott: I mean, it's definitely a treasure trove for making memes and other things of that nature.

947
01:05:19,629 --> 01:05:23,714
Scott: If you have some nostalgia for it, and you can get the original, not-U.S.

948
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:27,880
Scott: version of the show, you might gain some enjoyment from rewatching.

949
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:32,378
Rym: You'd be better off watching this than watching either of the Sonic cartoons that came before it.

950
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,745
Scott: Probably, yeah.

951
01:05:36,086 --> 01:05:39,316
Scott: But I think Pokemon's a better show than this, right?

952
01:05:39,376 --> 01:05:40,700
Scott: Either edition, you know?

953
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:41,879
Rym: Pokemon's still going.

954
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,621
Scott: It is still going.

955
01:05:45,143 --> 01:05:46,004
Scott: But, yeah.

956
01:05:46,204 --> 01:05:48,047
Scott: This is a Sonic cartoon.

957
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:49,989
Scott: It's out there, I guess.

958
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:58,000
Scott: It's good for it to exist and to be available, but I don't see much reason for most people to watch it in either form.

959
01:05:58,203 --> 01:05:59,300
Scott: In its entirety.

960
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:06,676
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

971
01:07:04,991 --> 01:07:09,053
Rym: I had many options, but I'm simply tonight going to leave you with...
