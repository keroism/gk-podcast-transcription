1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,410
Rym: It's Monday, October 10th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:09,971
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:13,756
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:16,840
Rym: And this is a Spooky GeekNights because it's October.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,420
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about web scraping.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,796
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,100
Rym: So yeah, I ended up just circumstance between work and that bike trip that Emily and I planned.

8
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:40,900
Rym: I basically took a month off of my normal life and I'm just now back from that honestly significant and extremely enjoyable pseudo-sabbatical.

9
00:00:42,162 --> 00:00:45,780
Rym: That's the longest I've taken off of normal life stuff in a long, long time.

10
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:51,980
Scott: My job is still pretty new, but I don't work on Fridays so there's no complaints to be had.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,325
Scott: But, you know, I stayed here.

12
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:58,560
Scott: I lived a life that had a lot of free time thanks to not podcasting.

13
00:00:59,402 --> 00:01:03,020
Scott: And I did work on the GeekNights website a significant amount.

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,080
Scott: Not done, but we're moving.

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,387
Rym: I lived a life of significant free time partly because... So I'll talk about this later.

16
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,240
Rym: Emily and I are going to do a special episode.

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,980
Rym: We're going to talk about the entire 481 mile bike trip we did across New York State.

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,030
Rym: But the TL;DR version is, it's fucking awesome.

19
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,038
Rym: It's not as hard as people think it is.

20
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:32,119
Rym: I highly recommend doing something like that at some point in your life if you enjoy cycling and are capable of this.

21
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,400
Scott: I've said it many times, but you know car culture, people just driving everywhere their whole life and not walking much and definitely not biking much.

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,540
Scott: You know, people have this idea of cycling as like a difficult athletic activity.

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,914
Rym: No, it was just every day, just all day, wee, seeing stuff.

24
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:49,300
Scott: I never thought I saw the whole state.

25
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:57,540
Scott: It's like if you're not racing a bike, you can go really far, much faster than you realize.

26
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,820
Rym: You think we were huffing and puffing?

27
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:01,780
Scott: It's really efficient.

28
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:03,367
Rym: I like to huff and puff.

29
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:05,420
Rym: That's where Scott and I disagree on enjoying biking.

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,990
Rym: However, I don't huff and puff for 70 miles.

31
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,933
Rym: I'm going to 70 miles.

32
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:12,220
Rym: I'm going like 10 miles an hour, just chill times.

33
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:22,200
Scott: You can get on a bicycle, no matter what kind of body you have, if your body is capable of bicycling, you can get to 10 miles an hour.

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,680
Rym: And if your legs don't work for that purpose, there are hand crank bikes, the bikes that are actually super efficient.

35
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,950
Scott: Some bicycle type machine can work for your body, most likely.

36
00:02:36,642 --> 00:02:43,335
Scott: You can go 10 miles an hour, most likely, and at 10 miles an hour, you can go 60 miles in 6 hours.

37
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,968
Scott: And that's pretty damn far.

38
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:49,510
Scott: You can get places.

39
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:04,019
Rym: So then I went to London right after that, so literally we finished the bike trip, took an Amtrak sleeper car home because that one line on Amtrak, you can take bikes on it now for 20 bucks.

40
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:09,460
Rym: You don't have to take the bike apart, you just bring it to the baggage area, they put it on the train, they take it off.

41
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,386
Rym: It was easy, it was great.

42
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:13,895
Rym: Not every Amtrak train has that.

43
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:15,120
Rym: You have to do a lot of research.

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,799
Scott: A lot of people have had some hassles, so maybe I guess just that line is handling it nicely.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,800
Rym: So if you look at the Amtrak website, there's like 5 different ways a train could handle bikes that are all crazy different.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,958
Scott: Based on what equipment is, yeah.

47
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:40,220
Rym: And you have to look up your specific train number, and then look up the day you're going, and then you can figure out which of the 5 ways might be applicable, and then you probably still have to call someone to make sure.

48
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:46,859
Scott: You can't search for the train based on that, like you can't say "I want the nice bike train, show me only trains that have

49
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,000
Scott: that.".

50
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:56,860
Rym: You can search for trains that allow bikes, however, most of those are, yeah, you can bring a bike if you turn the handlebars sideways and take the pedals off and put it in a bike box.

51
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:57,899
Rym: Yeah.

52
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:03,020
Rym: Which sucks, because for those of you who aren't bike people, that's really easy to do on a cheap bike.

53
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:09,159
Rym: But if you have a carbon fiber fork, even if you know bikes, I do not recommend doing that without a professional doing it for you.

54
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,182
Scott: Eh.

55
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:15,160
Rym: Do you have the appropriate tools to get the torque exactly right?

56
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:17,259
Scott: To take the pedals off?

57
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,560
Rym: No, no, to twist your handlebars 90 degrees from the fork.

58
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:26,049
Scott: Oh, I mean, you could just take your handlebars off.

59
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:29,638
Rym: Uh, no, I guess you could.

60
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:33,070
Rym: The Amtrak site requires you to turn the fork sideways into a thing.

61
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:35,569
Rym: They have a bunch of diagrams and even videos that'll help you.

62
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,210
Scott: Alright, well I haven't seen it, but, you know, taking your handlebars on and off is pretty easy.

63
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:49,310
Scott: The only issue is if you really want to rotate the front wheel to be perpendicular to the frame, you could take the front wheel off.

64
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,246
Scott: It's like that's easy to do also, right?

65
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:57,950
Rym: The other thing is bike boxes are weirdly expensive and they're pretty much one-time use.

66
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,502
Scott: Yeah, professional cycling people don't do that.

67
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:05,050
Scott: They get on a plane and they get to the other end and then there's more bikes.

68
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:09,430
Rym: Even bike touring people, because we met a ton of people on the trip who did long bike touring.

69
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,510
Rym: We met the Scottish couple who were biking the same route we were doing in the opposite direction.

70
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,829
Rym: And we were like, "Oh yeah, so what'd you do with the

71
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:16,970
Rym: bikes?".

72
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:23,470
Rym: And we were just like, "Oh, we just bought bikes, we came here, we picked them up at a bike shop in Buffalo, and we're going to give them away to a charity when we get to the end.

73
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:25,003
Rym: That was cheaper than shipping our

74
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:25,285
Rym: bikes.".

75
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:26,650
Scott: Yeah, of course.

76
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,150
Rym: Yeah.

77
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:32,750
Rym: So then I went to London for a big work thing, and then I went to Frankfurt where all my engineers were.

78
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,750
Rym: And I gotta say, I'll talk about the trip later, maybe I'll do a special on the Patriot or something.

79
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:43,970
Rym: It was great, but I always had this impression that Frankfurt is a boring city.

80
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:53,626
Rym: Because everyone I know who travels broadly, who has spent a lot of time in Germany, has been telling me my entire adult life, "Frankfurt's the boring city.

81
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:54,688
Rym: Why do you go to Frankfurt?

82
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,329
Rym: Blah, blah, blah, blah,

83
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:55,610
Rym: blah.".

84
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,350
Rym: They always tell me some other city's great.

85
00:05:57,852 --> 00:06:01,210
Rym: And I believed them, partly because I had only been to Frankfurt once.

86
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:04,510
Rym: And that one time I was there, it was kind of just boring.

87
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,530
Rym: Like Cleveland-y, but like nice Cleveland.

88
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,710
Rym: Like if Cleveland were nice, but it was still Cleveland.

89
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:18,350
Rym: So having spent a weekend there, between work, where I had nothing to do but just go explore, I now have a hypothesis.

90
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,590
Rym: Frankfurt is not boring.

91
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:33,130
Rym: The people who say Frankfurt is boring are themselves either boring or unimaginative, or expect the kinds of entertainment from a city that people like me and Scott do not seek out.

92
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:36,430
Rym: And in fact, I think Scott would also very much enjoy Frankfurt.

93
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:44,349
Rym: So yeah, full disclosure though, that might be colored by the fact that I was staying in a five-star hotel the entire time.

94
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,930
Scott: I mean, you can stay at a five-star hotel in a, you know, a trash fire and be okay.

95
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,381
Rym: True.

96
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,981
Rym: Shall I warm those crack pipe?

97
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:54,710
Rym: It was very much that kind of hotel.

98
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:57,049
Rym: But it was a real good trip.

99
00:06:57,371 --> 00:06:58,196
Rym: And we're back.

100
00:06:58,357 --> 00:07:00,650
Rym: I don't foresee any major disruptions to GeekNights.

101
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:03,390
Rym: We will have regularly scheduled disruptions now.

102
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,770
Scott: I mean, I foresee several major US holidays in the near future.

103
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:13,250
Rym: Well, I mean, we'll get the regularly scheduled disruptions like the November, December time, the important hockey game time.

104
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:15,410
Scott: Yeah, all that shit's coming down.

105
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,750
Scott: All right, so I got a normal old opening bit.

106
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,310
Scott: So on Friday night, just a few days ago, right?

107
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,129
Scott: I'm in my apartment doing my Friday night biz, you know, I didn't work all day.

108
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:31,050
Scott: And I hear noises outside, like you do when you live in the city and there's a street right out your window.

109
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,710
Scott: Occasionally you hear noises outside because there's a street there.

110
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,309
Scott: It could be anything going on out there.

111
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:36,582
Scott: Right.

112
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:43,950
Scott: Even when my previous apartment where the street that my apartment faced was like basically an alley, like not a busy street.

113
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:45,869
Scott: Things happened out there.

114
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:52,690
Rym: Well, I mean, living at the base of a bridge next to a subway station and the approach to a major non-toll bridge.

115
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:55,070
Rym: Yeah, shit happens outside our apartment.

116
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,830
Scott: Things happen outside the window.

117
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:57,649
Scott: It's a thing.

118
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,010
Scott: So whenever I hear noises outside the window that sound out of the ordinary.

119
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:02,630
Scott: Right.

120
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:04,088
Scott: I will go and take a look.

121
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:09,810
Scott: Mostly not because I'm going to call the cops on someone unless there's something, you know, really heinous.

122
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:13,710
Scott: But in case there is an emergency.

123
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:13,902
Scott: Right.

124
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:21,570
Scott: It's like there could be noises outside because of a fire or somebody passing out in the street or a new weird thing is happening.

125
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,850
Rym: And now you recognize if you hear that sound again.

126
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:24,147
Rym: All right.

127
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:24,909
Rym: It's that weird thing.

128
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:25,789
Rym: Now I know about it.

129
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:27,089
Rym: I don't need to go look a second time.

130
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,645
Scott: I need to call a different emergency service.

131
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:30,349
Scott: that's not police.

132
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,407
Rym: Maybe call the news.

133
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,150
Rym: Maybe you start videoing it like.

134
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:33,904
Scott: Yeah.

135
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,110
Scott: Who knows what's going on out there?

136
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:36,610
Scott: Usually, you know, whatever.

137
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,028
Scott: So I go out and I see.

138
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:38,929
Scott: Right.

139
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,310
Scott: A car that is a parked in quotation marks.

140
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:44,710
Scott: Right.

141
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:47,670
Scott: It's supposed to be parallel parking, but this car is like diagonal.

142
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,330
Scott: Forty five degrees aiming at the sidewalk.

143
00:08:51,738 --> 00:08:51,949
Scott: Right.

144
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:57,269
Scott: And the driver's side door is open, completely open.

145
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,410
Rym: Oh, that someone jumped out of a car that they just stopped really quickly.

146
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:02,487
Rym: Hold on.

147
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,230
Scott: And someone is moving about this car.

148
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:07,807
Scott: Right.

149
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,970
Scott: I think they have a bag and there is some amount of yelling that was indecipherable.

150
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:15,130
Rym: Now this reeks of Uber drive gone wrong.

151
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:16,706
Scott: I don't know.

152
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:17,948
Rym: I'm just speculating.

153
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,710
Rym: I'm the comment.

154
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:22,110
Scott: I can't tell what this is, what kind of individual this was.

155
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:28,410
Scott: Other than that, it was a person who was yelling and clearly an altercation ish manner.

156
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:29,628
Scott: But I didn't see any other people.

157
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:31,133
Scott: Ah, they were.

158
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:31,675
Scott: they were.

159
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,730
Scott: they were in and out of the car, I guess the side of the car.

160
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:36,121
Rym: I don't know.

161
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,695
Scott: But they then went.

162
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:39,277
Scott: they went.

163
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:43,528
Scott: they walked away from the car in a direction down the street.

164
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:44,950
Scott: Right.

165
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,870
Scott: Yelling something.

166
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:47,550
Scott: Then there was no more yelling.

167
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,709
Scott: There was no more person.

168
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,248
Scott: Right.

169
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:55,666
Scott: There was just this car sitting there parked diagonally when it should have been parked parallely.

170
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,309
Scott: Right.

171
00:09:57,072 --> 00:10:00,850
Scott: Ah, with the driver's side door wide open, just sitting there off.

172
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:01,630
Scott: Right.

173
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,888
Scott: Just a car sitting there.

174
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:12,028
Scott: And I saw delivery people, cyclists, walkers, all kinds of people going past the car, not even being curious as to why the door was open.

175
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:14,950
Rym: I'm slightly curious.

176
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,690
Rym: I might have looked in as I walk.

177
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:17,820
Rym: Yeah.

178
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:18,930
Scott: That's what I would have done.

179
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,890
Scott: Looked in, make sure there isn't like an unconscious person in the car.

180
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:22,869
Scott: Who knows what.

181
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:23,684
Scott: Yeah.

182
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:25,929
Scott: I didn't go down there.

183
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:27,349
Scott: I waited.

184
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:32,330
Rym: How much would it take to go downstairs for something we see outside our windows?

185
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,530
Scott: If I saw like a hand, like of a struggling person coming out the door.

186
00:10:37,752 --> 00:10:41,310
Rym: Or like a series of clowns started emerging from the car.

187
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,788
Rym: Like I would go down and see what's going on.

188
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:43,641
Scott: Right.

189
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,509
Scott: Something like that.

190
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,030
Rym: It had to be at least like four clowns before I bothered, though.

191
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,650
Scott: The car was sitting there a while, just abandoned effectively with the door open.

192
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,090
Scott: The next day, I didn't I didn't check on it again.

193
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:57,549
Scott: I just waited like five minutes and I was like, well, OK.

194
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,647
Rym: And then I see the pro move anonymous account post to Reddit free car.

195
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:08,629
Scott: I had the next day walking down the street and I noticed the car is still there with the door closed.

196
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,769
Scott: Someone at some point in the night Friday night had closed the door of the car.

197
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:14,370
Rym: All right.

198
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,590
Rym: Good Samaritan, probably.

199
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,710
Scott: The car is still here Monday night.

200
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,650
Scott: The car is still parked diagonally in that spot.

201
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,468
Rym: You got to put a webcam at this thing and make a Reddit post countdown to whatever's up with this car.

202
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,770
Scott: This car is going to amass some tickets parked in a very much well today.

203
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:35,629
Scott: See, they were lucky.

204
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,329
Scott: Today was, you know, indigenous people's day.

205
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,090
Scott: So they did not have an open school today.

206
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,883
Scott: It's because the one time I had a parking like right in front of the entrance to the high school.

207
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:46,028
Scott: Yeah.

208
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,330
Rym: If you don't live in New York, like I don't think you understand the parking ticket situation in this city.

209
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:55,610
Rym: If you park a car illegally and like blink, there will be a ticket on that car.

210
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:01,470
Scott: As soon as school starts, that car will be parked illegally and will amass tickets.

211
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:02,849
Scott: And it's not going to move.

212
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:06,510
Scott: I'm certain it isn't an abandoned vehicle for some reason.

213
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,268
Scott: It has license plates that I didn't look up.

214
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:12,038
Scott: But when?

215
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:13,610
Scott: how many tickets will it amass?

216
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,609
Rym: How quickly before it is to see a webcam and a betting pool is the way to go with this.

217
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:21,227
Scott: It's it's just a very interesting situation.

218
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,710
Scott: Like, how did the car get there?

219
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,297
Scott: Whose is it?

220
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:25,350
Scott: Why did they abandon it?

221
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,916
Scott: How did they?

222
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:27,048
Scott: how did this come to be?

223
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:28,889
Scott: What was the altercation about?

224
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,750
Rym: See, forget true crime.

225
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:39,169
Rym: I want a genre of investigative reporters figuring out the really low key mundane shit that happens around in cities like New York.

226
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:40,810
Scott: You know, it's a mystery, right?

227
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,210
Scott: Mysteries are interesting.

228
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,149
Rym: I mean, there's a reason all those teenagers are driving around.

229
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:51,290
Scott: It doesn't have to be a mystery about who murdered someone or who stole a painting or who did some international spy crime.

230
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:55,230
Scott: It could be a mystery of a normal everyday thing that might not even be a crime.

231
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,790
Scott: Well, then the parking violation is a crime.

232
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,430
Rym: I mean, those teenagers drive around in that mystery mobile looking for nonsense.

233
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:05,050
Rym: Every kid has the mysteries of the neighborhood.

234
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,608
Rym: Like, what's up with that one weird house?

235
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,686
Scott: Yeah.

236
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,509
Rym: So there is a ton of news.

237
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:12,650
Rym: Not going to talk about everything.

238
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,389
Rym: It's not time for a tech news roundup just yet.

239
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,729
Rym: But edging into an opening bit.

240
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:26,487
Rym: So while I was away, you know, right before I went off, Verizon started upgrading the network to support IPv6.

241
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:32,690
Scott: First of all, first of all, they didn't announce that they were doing this, right?

242
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,235
Rym: There was.

243
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:38,330
Rym: So there were press releases that were not picked up by anyone because no one gives a shit.

244
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,250
Scott: Right.

245
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:43,630
Scott: But basically, I knew because I checked my router that IPv6 was not working.

246
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:51,010
Scott: And what happened, I saw a message on the community discussion board, the local geographic community neighborhood discussion board.

247
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,230
Scott: Like, hey, was Fios out last night?

248
00:13:53,310 --> 00:14:00,070
Scott: And everyone's like, yes, everybody knows that everyone in the whole neighborhood agreed that Fios was out last night while I was asleep.

249
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:06,750
Scott: Not out of last night, but the night when we had the discussion, my five, one person in the comment thread says yes.

250
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:08,710
Scott: And now IPv6 is enabled.

251
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,610
Scott: And I checked my router and sure enough, IPv6 was now enabled for real.

252
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,150
Scott: Not like in the olden days where you could do a weird thing to get a bridge or something like this.

253
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:21,669
Rym: I had an account on the six bone that dates me.

254
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:22,712
Scott: Right.

255
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:28,490
Scott: We now have for real IPv6 in our neighborhood with our Internet service provider.

256
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:33,150
Rym: So they did not upgrade our neighborhood at that time because our files was fine.

257
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:37,948
Scott: So they updated yours and mine at the same time.

258
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:42,849
Rym: Because we did not experience the problem that I experienced at that time.

259
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,260
Scott: The time that you experienced.

260
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,930
Scott: the problem is the time that we got upgraded.

261
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:51,090
Rym: No, we didn't experience the problem until while I was in Frankfurt.

262
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:53,069
Scott: That's when that happened, yes.

263
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,767
Rym: What date was it?

264
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:55,429
Scott: I'll have to look it up.

265
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,130
Rym: Because I want to say I was in London when that happened and our Internet was probably was still fine.

266
00:15:00,873 --> 00:15:01,908
Scott: Let me let me look it up.

267
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:03,130
Rym: I'm just curious.

268
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,730
Scott: It could have been that, like, you know, your router didn't restart or something.

269
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,887
Rym: Yeah, it could have been like it doesn't get enabled until they push it out to the router.

270
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:10,310
Rym: Who knows?

271
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,491
Rym: Regardless, so 14 days ago, 14 days ago, I was still in London.

272
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:22,980
Scott: OK, well, that's the day that it happened.

273
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:23,402
Rym: All right.

274
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:28,560
Rym: So about a week later, the Internet in our house gets just shitty.

275
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:32,280
Rym: So I come home from the trip and the Internet still shitty.

276
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:33,819
Rym: So start to investigate a little bit.

277
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:37,200
Rym: And what I find download working fine.

278
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:41,480
Rym: I can download at one hundred, two hundred megabits per second from anywhere.

279
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,656
Rym: I tested all over the network.

280
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:44,200
Rym: Everything's fine.

281
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:45,163
Rym: Upload.

282
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:47,494
Rym: I was getting maybe 50K up.

283
00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:49,919
Scott: Yep.

284
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:54,277
Scott: So, yeah, the problems that Rym experienced, I experienced 14 days ago.

285
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,401
Scott: Yep.

286
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:57,471
Rym: So I do a little investigating.

287
00:15:58,215 --> 00:15:59,159
Rym: I know network stuff.

288
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,419
Scott: Even though I already posted the answer.

289
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,221
Rym: Yep.

290
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:04,980
Rym: But I did not read that because I had been in Germany.

291
00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:07,039
Rym: I was barely paying attention to stuff.

292
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:08,999
Rym: So I poke around a little bit.

293
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:13,639
Rym: I do a test from the actual Verizon box and there's no problems there.

294
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:17,800
Rym: Then I do a test with one of my wireless devices and it's fine.

295
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,840
Scott: No problems there either.

296
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:19,204
Scott: Nope.

297
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:20,418
Scott: That'll be working fine.

298
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:20,540
Scott: Yep.

299
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:26,500
Rym: So then I do some packet captures, of course, just to see, like, is there anything going on my own network?

300
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,800
Rym: Before I open it, take it with Verizon, look at my own network, make sure that I'm not having a problem.

301
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:38,060
Rym: And what I suspected was that there is a switch that every wired device in our apartment is plugged into.

302
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,340
Rym: That is very, very, very old and cheap.

303
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:45,459
Rym: I suspected that maybe something went on with it.

304
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:47,429
Scott: I can see why you would think that.

305
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:48,716
Scott: The common factor.

306
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,580
Rym: And that switch was very hot, but I didn't remember if it had always been hot because I had not touched it physically in years.

307
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,940
Rym: So I unplug my computer from that switch and I plug it directly into the Verizon router.

308
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:04,148
Rym: Same problem.

309
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,138
Rym: That eliminates that.

310
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,973
Rym: And I do a packet capture and I see, like, 95% packet loss.

311
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:19,540
Rym: And I also see that the checksums on all the packets going in one direction are fucked up.

312
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,079
Rym: And there's this extra, like, there's this blobs of nonsense.

313
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:29,960
Rym: Emily described them as, what, data dingleberries hanging out after the checksums on these TCP packets.

314
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,528
Rym: And then I put two and two together.

315
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,700
Rym: Scott reminded me about the IPv6 thing.

316
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,072
Rym: Sure enough, I see IPv6 is enabled.

317
00:17:38,414 --> 00:17:39,340
Rym: I see this is happening.

318
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,872
Rym: I disable IPv6 in my network as a quick test.

319
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:43,400
Rym: All problems disappear.

320
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,124
Rym: That is the exact problem.

321
00:17:45,144 --> 00:18:07,080
Rym: And the problem is a bug in Intel gigabit ethernet controllers, coupled with technically correct but not advisable behavior in the ONTs, which are like the optical connectors that Fios and networks like it use to connect your internal non-fiber network to their fiber network.

322
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:18,980
Rym: Not bad, because it's not incorrect, but weird and inadvisable behavior of the ONTs triggered a bug in these specific network cards.

323
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:20,666
Scott: Well, not specific.

324
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:23,380
Scott: It's actually extremely widespread.

325
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,900
Rym: Well, because it's Intel and nobody buys network cards anymore.

326
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,521
Scott: Right.

327
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:40,380
Scott: A very, very, very large number of Intel network cards, wired ethernet network cards, especially the kinds that you'll see on like, you know, desktop motherboards like, you know, aces, whatever motherboard you have, you nerd.

328
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,903
Scott: You have a computer, right?

329
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:48,240
Scott: Almost all of those cards up until a few years ago have a bug in the hardware.

330
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:52,234
Scott: It cannot be fixed by a firmware update or a driver or anything like that.

331
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:53,178
Scott: There's no fix for it.

332
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:02,840
Scott: Where if there are IPv6 packets that have data after the checksum, which is technically acceptable, I guess.

333
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:09,600
Rym: I did not read the RFC, but this is one of those situations where RFCs will use language like must and must not.

334
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:12,978
Rym: But then they'll say things like should and should not.

335
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,580
Scott: I don't know what the actual thing is, but it's not any legal thing, right?

336
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,820
Scott: Because Intel actually changed their more recent network cards to not be broken, right?

337
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,245
Scott: So they're definitely the wrong.

338
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:27,040
Scott: They were, you know, but basically all these Intel network cards are wrong.

339
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:37,300
Scott: And you have to go into your device manager in Windows and disable this one feature, the TCP checksum offload feature.

340
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:51,560
Scott: And if you disable that, what will end up happening is instead of your network cards hardware, right, checking the checksums on all the TCP packets to verify that the packets are correct, your CPU will do the work instead.

341
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,680
Scott: Which it's such a light load for a modern computer, you will not notice.

342
00:19:56,041 --> 00:20:02,220
Scott: It would be nice if you were able to keep the feature on just because technically you have this hardware that could do it.

343
00:20:02,762 --> 00:20:04,330
Scott: Why should the CPU do extra work?

344
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,220
Scott: But turning it off, you'll never notice.

345
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:11,940
Scott: And it fixes the problem because Windows TCP stack will handle it properly.

346
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,820
Rym: It could theoretically cause a likely negligible performance.

347
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:17,500
Scott: You will never notice.

348
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:26,260
Scott: The other thing is you could just buy another network card that doesn't have a broken chip in it and use that and not use the one on your motherboard.

349
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:35,660
Rym: And you will only experience this if you connect to an internet service provider that uses fiber like Fios does, but they're not the only one.

350
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,306
Rym: And they use a particular kind of ONT.

351
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:48,940
Rym: And I got a note, multiple providers, I haven't seen anything about Verizon, but like Alcatel and some other providers are currently upgrading their ONTs to not do this behavior anymore.

352
00:20:50,822 --> 00:20:51,363
Rym: OK.

353
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:58,580
Scott: But yeah, Verizon, it's like Verizon just upgraded to IPv6, right, without notifying the customers.

354
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:00,727
Rym: And imagine if you're not technical.

355
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:03,198
Rym: Your internet just fucking stopped working.

356
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,040
Scott: Well, if you're not technical, do you really have a wired ethernet at this point?

357
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,100
Scott: But if you're not, a lot of people might have like a gaming PC out there on Fios.

358
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:13,069
Scott: They got it plugged in with ethernet.

359
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,957
Scott: Suddenly, like YouTube just doesn't work.

360
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:15,520
Scott: Right.

361
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,665
Scott: And they're like, what the fuck is like?

362
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,979
Scott: only websites that are using IPv6 are going to start fucking up.

363
00:21:20,722 --> 00:21:23,180
Scott: Yeah, because they're only doing this on the IPv6 packets.

364
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:27,336
Scott: So and that's like old IPv4 website dot com.

365
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:28,300
Scott: It's going to work even funnier.

366
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,471
Rym: So the Ookala speed test uses IPv6.

367
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:32,535
Rym: So we had the problem.

368
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:33,760
Rym: None of the other speed test dudes.

369
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,965
Rym: They all showed no problems.

370
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:35,910
Scott: Yep.

371
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:38,140
Rym: That's why I went straight to the packet capture.

372
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:45,800
Rym: So my advice to you as a nerd to make this lesson completely useless, unless you work in interesting industries.

373
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,379
Rym: Number one, if there's ever a weird problem.

374
00:21:49,881 --> 00:21:56,200
Rym: Look for the parts of the specification that are shoulds and should nots as opposed to musts and must nots.

375
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,380
Rym: Therein lie all weird problems.

376
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:10,260
Scott: Part of the reason the website is taking so long is because I'm a person who will obey all the should and should nots of everything, even if it's completely useless and will never be relevant for the actual functionality.

377
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,886
Rym: This applies to everything.

378
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:15,960
Rym: My day job, the fixed protocol, you know, all that nonsense in capital markets.

379
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,761
Rym: Guess what?

380
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:23,220
Rym: You know, one of the most common causes of a problem there is when someone sends a message encoded in the fixed protocol.

381
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:28,020
Rym: That is technically correct, but kind of weird and nobody does it that way.

382
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,040
Scott: Yep.

383
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,600
Rym: If some of you internalize that lesson, you can make six figures working in capital markets within a week.

384
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:35,640
Scott: Maybe.

385
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:40,040
Rym: So in some other news, goes through some really quick news.

386
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,300
Rym: So a Dutch court, this will not help usians too much, not yet anyway.

387
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:51,920
Rym: They have made a very specific ruling that is kind of important because the US does not have these protections.

388
00:22:52,441 --> 00:23:05,779
Rym: A company in Florida basically tried to fire an employee of theirs who works in the Netherlands because they required him to turn on his webcam all day while he was at work in case they wanted to monitor him.

389
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:08,800
Rym: While he was working from home, working remotely.

390
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,647
Rym: He said, "That's

391
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:11,170
Rym: creepy."

392
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:12,940
Rym: And he turned off his webcam.

393
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,340
Rym: They fired him, citing that he refused to work and was insubordinate.

394
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:21,477
Rym: And the Dutch courts ruled, "Nope, that is an unreasonable request.

395
00:23:21,718 --> 00:23:21,939
Rym: Fuck

396
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:22,120
Rym: you.".

397
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:24,040
Rym: And they made the company reinstate him and pay a fine.

398
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:25,722
Scott: Okay.

399
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:31,940
Scott: Or I guess the alternative is the company could have ceased operations in the Dutch lands.

400
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,439
Rym: Yeah, I don't know all the details of exactly that.

401
00:23:35,442 --> 00:23:39,556
Rym: I do not know how those types of jurisdictional matters work out in the end.

402
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:40,500
Rym: I am not a lawyer.

403
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:46,240
Scott: I'm pretty sure that if you just got the USBC thing going on, right?

404
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:53,120
Scott: If Apple just didn't sell any iPhones or any Apple products in Europe then the EU couldn't force them to do USBC.

405
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:54,587
Scott: It's pretty clear, right?

406
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:57,120
Scott: So if this company only hires people...

407
00:23:58,441 --> 00:24:10,238
Rym: If you're in Europe and you go to a lot of low tier websites, they won't load and they'll basically tell you, "Oh, Europe is evil and GDPR and we can't comply with it so you can't access this website from

408
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:10,539
Rym: Europe.".

409
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,556
Rym: Even though the reality is more, "Yeah, we're trying to spy on you and Europe actually made laws against

410
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:16,797
Rym: this.".

411
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:24,420
Rym: But this is actually something... I have not encountered this, but I saw this article.

412
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:35,560
Scott: People only get away with abusing employees like this when they're doing jobs that are considered but incorrectly considered.

413
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:37,657
Scott: No skill, low skill, menial jobs.

414
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:44,320
Rym: But even in technology, a lot of help desk work, a lot of people who serve as customer tickets, this kind of stuff is happening.

415
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,520
Rym: A lot of teachers get these kinds of requirements.

416
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:53,020
Rym: Remote workers in low tier industries or industries that are trying to prevent people from working from home.

417
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,980
Rym: Students in high schools who are doing remote classes are being forced to do this kind of thing when they take tests.

418
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,920
Rym: It's like they'll get in trouble if they look away from the monitor for too long taking a test.

419
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,380
Rym: It is evil and egregious and it's only going to get worse until we pass some laws.

420
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:13,631
Rym: So keep an eye on this space and if you live and work in the U.S.

421
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:24,280
Rym: and a company does this, maybe talk to a lawyer, but you're probably screwed and you will probably lose because I don't think you would have the resources to fight the companies that are doing this kind of evil nonsense.

422
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:25,880
Scott: Unless you've got a union.

423
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:29,440
Rym: Yeah, that's where I was going with this.

424
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,220
Rym: The only way to fight worker exploitation in a country like America is to form and join a union.

425
00:25:37,225 --> 00:25:39,320
Scott: Alright, so kind of biggish news.

426
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,120
Scott: Nvidia announced the 4090, which will cost like a fortune, small, you know, whatever.

427
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:58,740
Rym: I guess I could almost thank the shitty crypto people who made it too hard to buy a 3080 when I wanted a 3080 because they made me wait so long that now I can just skip it and go straight to the 4080.

428
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,309
Scott: Alright, so I mean what is there to say about the 4090?

429
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,180
Scott: I mean it's pretty much what you expected.

430
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,779
Scott: It's enormous, right?

431
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:05,839
Rym: It's what, like three slots wide?

432
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,719
Scott: Yeah, it's going to be really hot and use a lot of electricity, right?

433
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,600
Scott: You know, Nvidia is basically the opposite of Apple.

434
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:20,580
Scott: Apple's like, look, we're going to make the CPU as fast as we can, but also we're going to concentrate on energy efficiency, right?

435
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,180
Scott: Intel's like, we want to do that, but we're not as good at it because we're having, you know, issues, right?

436
00:26:27,481 --> 00:26:29,739
Scott: We're a little dysfunctional for the past several years, right?

437
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:41,460
Scott: And Nvidia's like, fuck that shit, we'll just use as much electricity and generate as much heat as we can and compensate with cooling and we'll make the fastest thing, you know, known to anyone.

438
00:26:43,182 --> 00:26:46,019
Scott: And Nvidia thing ends up being the fastest.

439
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:50,401
Scott: Like a drag car is the fastest, but... Also

440
00:26:50,441 --> 00:27:02,140
Rym: because there really aren't other credible video cards and while a few of you, including some people we know, are already butt AMD, I got to point out that every single fucking time we play online games,

441
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:03,362
Scott: the

442
00:27:03,483 --> 00:27:10,200
Rym: two people who have AMD video cards have problems, have crashes, have issues that nobody else runs into.

443
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,338
Rym: That has been the story my entire life and it is still true.

444
00:27:15,121 --> 00:27:17,953
Scott: So anyway, what is up with the 4090?

445
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:19,560
Scott: It's like, why would you get one, right?

446
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:32,760
Scott: Well, I guess if you really are a person who is playing, you know, competitive, real time, high resolution, fancy 3D top of the line games, Even then, a 3070 can play those games.

447
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,307
Scott: It's like a 4090 would be like overkill.

448
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:39,740
Scott: Maybe you just, you really want to prepare for the next game and not have to buy another video card for a long time.

449
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:48,616
Rym: Even if you are doing non-consumer, like professional high spec VR, like research nonsense, a 3080 Ti is enough.

450
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:51,681
Scott: Yup.

451
00:27:52,823 --> 00:27:59,338
Scott: I guess if you're making those kinds of games or you're doing some other 3D graphics work, right?

452
00:27:59,539 --> 00:27:59,959
Scott: I don't know.

453
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,612
Scott: You know, you're a researcher or something.

454
00:28:02,632 --> 00:28:03,639
Scott: I don't know.

455
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:12,640
Rym: The use cases I can see for a 4090 right now are if you're doing AI research, this is actually something you can use to power AI pretty directly.

456
00:28:13,843 --> 00:28:15,499
Rym: That's one of the most common uses of these things.

457
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:25,860
Rym: This would be useful if you were doing high spec VR and wanted to live stream it and you didn't need an external computer to do it.

458
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,244
Rym: Like, I guess that's one use case.

459
00:28:27,785 --> 00:28:32,900
Rym: Or if you are making and rendering extremely advanced VFX, you could use this.

460
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:44,839
Scott: So one interesting thing that they did is they have this sort of like RTX real time ray tracing.

461
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:45,520
Scott: they've been pushing.

462
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:51,187
Scott: And on the one hand, it's sort of a chicken and egg scenario.

463
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:54,533
Scott: It's like, who the hell has a ray tracing card?

464
00:28:59,303 --> 00:28:59,545
Scott: Right.

465
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:01,199
Scott: Almost only really wealthy people.

466
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:10,860
Scott: So if you're a game developer, why the fuck would you spend the time to add that feature to your game just to get a few sales from people who have these cards?

467
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,281
Rym: Counterpoint.

468
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,604
Rym: Remember GLQuake?

469
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:18,960
Rym: When GLQuake was announced, there were like 12 people in America who could play GLQuake on a computer.

470
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,076
Scott: Sure.

471
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,338
Rym: They made it anyway to push the industry forward.

472
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:25,766
Scott: Still, it's a little bit of chicken and egg, right?

473
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:30,440
Scott: Are you going to develop a game that requires RTX or has RTX mode?

474
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:37,659
Scott: And how much effort is it going to take to add that mode versus how many extra sales will that get you?

475
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:44,880
Scott: So Nvidia is selling this technology and gamers are like, OK, that would be really cool to get RTX.

476
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:46,149
Scott: But what uses that?

477
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:46,512
Scott: Nothing.

478
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:47,419
Scott: So why would I buy it?

479
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:58,160
Scott: So what Nvidia has done is they sort of included a couple technologies to try to break that chicken and egg cycle, which is, I think, pretty clever from a business standpoint.

480
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:08,640
Scott: So the first technology that they've added is basically it should be theoretically possible.

481
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:21,020
Scott: And the example they gave us, of course, a Skyrim mod for somebody to make mods of existing games such that they now use real time ray tracing.

482
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,200
Scott: So you could, I think someone or they made one as a demo.

483
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:24,561
Scott: Right.

484
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:26,506
Scott: It's like, ah, get your Skyrim.

485
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:31,580
Scott: And if you've got this card, you can play in an even fancier graphics mode.

486
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:32,122
Scott: Right.

487
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:33,045
Scott: That no one else can do.

488
00:30:33,908 --> 00:30:37,059
Scott: Even though it's an existing game and the developer of the game didn't have to do anything.

489
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:41,706
Scott: I'm just getting over a non.

490
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:45,020
Scott: we got a non covid sinus cold going on around this week here.

491
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,724
Rym: Ah, that's always the worst.

492
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:47,467
Scott: Yep.

493
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:48,511
Scott: We tested.

494
00:30:48,531 --> 00:30:50,700
Scott: We're sure it's not the it's not the sea anyway.

495
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:58,940
Scott: The other thing they added was this feature where, OK, you've got these ray tracing cores in there.

496
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,421
Scott: Right.

497
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:00,906
Scott: But you're not ray tracing.

498
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:02,612
Scott: You're playing some old ass game.

499
00:31:02,672 --> 00:31:05,040
Rym: The example on their website is Portal and they have a screenshot.

500
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,120
Scott: Right.

501
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:12,218
Scott: So you're playing Portal and, you know, Portal is only going to go like it's only rendering 60 FPS.

502
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:16,047
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like, come on.

503
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:21,760
Scott: But what you could do, for example, is, OK, you know, I got Portal.

504
00:31:21,961 --> 00:31:23,830
Scott: It's running at 60 FPS or whatever.

505
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:25,860
Scott: But I've got such a ridiculous video card.

506
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,428
Scott: Portal is an old game and I've got a monitor.

507
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:32,500
Scott: My monitor goes to 144 hertz because I got a ridiculous, fancy monitor.

508
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:32,961
Scott: Right.

509
00:31:33,663 --> 00:31:39,880
Scott: Well, what you can do is you can tell the video card, hey, I know you got those ray tracing cores you're not using.

510
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:45,100
Scott: Why don't you use them and some machine learning stuff that you're so good at you GPU.

511
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:46,001
Scott: Right.

512
00:31:46,442 --> 00:31:53,620
Scott: And you're so fast at it that even though the game in the frame buffer is rendering, you know, 60 frames a second.

513
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:53,921
Scott: Right.

514
00:31:53,941 --> 00:32:00,678
Scott: So here comes a frame and then one sixtieth of a second later, another frames coming in the A.I.

515
00:32:00,698 --> 00:32:01,560
Scott: in quotes.

516
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:02,181
Scott: Right.

517
00:32:02,742 --> 00:32:24,071
Scott: With using those RTX cores that are otherwise dormant can look at the previous frames and basically interpolate and guess and generate a frame to go in between the current frame and the next frame and show it to you fast enough before the next frame actually is going to be displayed.

518
00:32:24,091 --> 00:32:25,480
Scott: a sixtieth of a second later.

519
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,440
Scott: Right.

520
00:32:27,082 --> 00:32:35,200
Scott: And thus you'll get those frames won't be like actual game frames because like the game input wouldn't be processed on those frames.

521
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:42,820
Scott: But it would be adding like an extra draw, you know, method, you know, run an extra draw loop only.

522
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,321
Scott: Yeah.

523
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:43,621
Scott: Right.

524
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:44,583
Scott: To the game.

525
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:58,380
Scott: So basically the effect of this would be that the motion of the game would be like unnaturally smooth compared to what it would normally be because you're just inventing new frames.

526
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,262
Scott: Right.

527
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,738
Scott: Visually to go in between the ones that are already there.

528
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:11,960
Rym: Because on one hand, it does theoretically alter the game from what the developers intended into.

529
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,243
Rym: You know, you're seeing something different.

530
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:17,192
Rym: But at the same time, these are mostly micro differences.

531
00:33:18,294 --> 00:33:20,680
Scott: that kind of just a cool demo.

532
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:22,949
Scott: But like, does anyone actually fucking need that?

533
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,440
Scott: It's you just do that to show off your money, basically.

534
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:25,801
Scott: Right.

535
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:34,499
Rym: But it's hard, though, because I remember when I first got a real 4K monitor and that was right around when auto chess was popular.

536
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:36,365
Rym: Like I got a good 4K monitor.

537
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:37,869
Rym: I got everything working.

538
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,560
Rym: I play auto chess and it just looked better.

539
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:43,406
Rym: But I couldn't articulate why.

540
00:33:43,426 --> 00:33:45,594
Rym: And I wasn't sure if it was, you know, my bias.

541
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:47,360
Rym: Like, well, of course, you know, I think it looks better.

542
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:54,687
Rym: I bought this fancy monitor and then Scott came over to your GeekNights and you literally said the words, why the fuck do your fonts look so good?

543
00:33:54,727 --> 00:33:55,069
Rym: What did you?

544
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:58,460
Rym: what did you do anyway?

545
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:05,640
Scott: But the point is, this is a. regardless of how useful these features are, they are a from a business standpoint.

546
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:06,281
Scott: Right.

547
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:08,507
Scott: A clever way to break out of that chicken egg.

548
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:20,020
Scott: And video can sell this to people as saying, yes, if you buy this card, there are things you can do to make games you're already playing look either better and or smoother.

549
00:34:20,722 --> 00:34:29,139
Scott: Even if game developers do not support any of these features in their development cycle and thus maybe they can get some sales.

550
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,699
Scott: And if they get some sales, then game developers would hopefully make games with RTX mode in them.

551
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:37,487
Scott: And then they would take off.

552
00:34:37,607 --> 00:34:37,808
Scott: Right.

553
00:34:37,848 --> 00:34:40,460
Scott: And I don't think this AMD have the RTX mode.

554
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:41,263
Scott: Right.

555
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:42,447
Scott: Is that what their end game?

556
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,570
Rym: I don't think so.

557
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,420
Rym: Never mind, like video encoding, all the other stuff gamers care about.

558
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,820
Rym: Like if you're streaming yourself, NVENC just works and these cards are crazy fast at it.

559
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,480
Rym: OBS just now implemented some basic support for one of AMD's equivalents.

560
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:05,820
Scott: So there is a googled for AMD ray tracing and they do seem to have Radeon Pro technologies.

561
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,983
Scott: OK, I guess.

562
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:07,625
Scott: Yeah.

563
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:09,270
Scott: AMD RTX.

564
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:10,333
Scott: It's like do they?

565
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:12,500
Scott: they have RX, but not our.

566
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:14,464
Scott: I don't know enough about it.

567
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:20,280
Scott: Someone in the chat, the listener will know if AMD has an RTX competitor.

568
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,362
Rym: I mean, the listener.

569
00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:23,267
Scott: I haven't heard of them having one.

570
00:35:23,548 --> 00:35:30,126
Scott: So my guess is that if Nvidia can get this to lift off, they can put AMD away.

571
00:35:30,427 --> 00:35:30,628
Scott: Right.

572
00:35:30,668 --> 00:35:34,200
Scott: By saying the games support this now only on Nvidia cards.

573
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:39,517
Scott: Even if an AMD card gets faster, you know, it's like you need that real time ray tracing.

574
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:40,420
Scott: and we have at the end.

575
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:48,940
Rym: I feel like the listener is either on a Mac right now or has some sort of Nvidia GPU in their Intel CPU.

576
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:50,041
Scott: Yeah.

577
00:35:50,061 --> 00:35:56,920
Scott: I mean, I'm seriously considering more and more every day, especially like the story we just talked about with the Intel network cards.

578
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,341
Scott: Right.

579
00:35:57,361 --> 00:36:05,320
Scott: It's like I might just get some Mac Studio, even though I still don't like Mac OS, because the CPU is the best CPU.

580
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:10,180
Scott: And the 99 percent of what I do is not GPU based work personally.

581
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,021
Scott: Right.

582
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:14,358
Scott: Other people I know do a lot of GPU based work, but I don't like it.

583
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:17,166
Scott: It's like it's the.

584
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:21,340
Scott: it's just that CPU, the M2, the M3, whatever is going to be out.

585
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:21,721
Scott: Right.

586
00:36:21,802 --> 00:36:25,360
Scott: Well, is the best unless Intel comes out again with something better again.

587
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:26,965
Scott: That's the best CPU.

588
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:31,480
Rym: Oh, they show stats for Premiere and After Effects and all that stuff.

589
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:35,759
Rym: And even the 3080 kicks the shit out of an M2.

590
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:44,660
Scott: Well, yeah, you know, but it's like the CPU is what 90 percent of my work is based on that.

591
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:45,302
Scott: Right.

592
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:47,749
Scott: Then I could get one of those.

593
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:51,420
Scott: And then what I could do is I could get an Nvidia card.

594
00:36:51,881 --> 00:36:52,121
Scott: Right.

595
00:36:52,522 --> 00:36:58,800
Scott: And stick it in a little tiny box in the corner with no just, you know, in the corner over there.

596
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:05,720
Scott: And if I would need to play a game, I can just use steam link or something like that, remote desktop or some, you know, I have to.

597
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:13,220
Scott: If I really have to KVM and just any gaming stuff, which is the only thing I ever really use a GPU for over there.

598
00:37:14,022 --> 00:37:16,229
Scott: And then use the Mac Studio for everything else.

599
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,698
Scott: I might go that route in a in a year or so.

600
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:19,420
Scott: We'll see what happens.

601
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:29,760
Rym: So I think because I am I'm at a point where I can't upgrade to Windows 11 because I am still running a sixth generation Intel CPU and I'm not even CPU bound.

602
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,814
Rym: I would not upgrade my computer except in twenty twenty five.

603
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:35,180
Rym: I'm going to run out of Windows updates.

604
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,900
Scott: So and that's only it's still three years is plenty of time.

605
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,883
Rym: Yeah.

606
00:37:40,903 --> 00:37:44,980
Rym: So but I was going to upgrade my GPU because I'm running it.

607
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,497
Rym: I am I'm GPU bound with my 1080 on a lot of things I want to do.

608
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,209
Scott: Seventy still does everything I want to do.

609
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:52,991
Rym: My 1080 does not.

610
00:37:53,714 --> 00:37:56,521
Rym: And I could get the 3080.

611
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:57,385
Rym: I did double check.

612
00:37:57,445 --> 00:38:01,520
Rym: I would have to get a bigger power supply, which makes that less of a good value proposition.

613
00:38:02,022 --> 00:38:06,879
Rym: And even worse, there is no way to run a 4080 in this computer like it would not happen.

614
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,783
Scott: Where would it fit?

615
00:38:08,903 --> 00:38:15,380
Rym: I actually have room for it just barely because I got rid of all my firewire stuff that was in there.

616
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,564
Rym: That's how old this computer is.

617
00:38:17,888 --> 00:38:21,360
Rym: But it would take up basically the entirety of the case to put that video card in there.

618
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:25,559
Rym: And I don't have enough surface area to cool it properly if I do that.

619
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:37,460
Scott: The only thing about the Mac route is that, you know, you unlike a desktop PC, which you can fill with hard drives, you know, the Mac comes with the storage it comes with and they overcharge you for it.

620
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:45,860
Scott: So if I did that, I would have to basically reload my NAS with all new drives that are much larger because that would end up having to do a lot of work suddenly.

621
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,441
Scott: Right.

622
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:48,268
Scott: So I'm waiting.

623
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:51,920
Scott: I've been monitoring the prices of NAS drives because mine's almost full anyway.

624
00:38:53,521 --> 00:38:56,090
Rym: It's been a while since we did a Geeknight, so we've been talking for a while.

625
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:05,103
Rym: So rather than doing the rest of our news, I think we should go right into... Things of the Day!

626
00:39:05,404 --> 00:39:09,232
Rym: So randomly, the algorithm, I never watch this channel.

627
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:14,985
Rym: I like Legos, well Lego bricks, but I am not like... I live in a New York apartment.

628
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:16,874
Rym: I'm not going to go down that road again.

629
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:18,040
Rym: I know where that road leads.

630
00:39:18,562 --> 00:39:22,619
Scott: There's one Lego set I really want and I still haven't bought it because I know where to put it.

631
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:30,560
Rym: So my favorite Lego set ever, of all time in my entire life, was the original castle Lego stuff.

632
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,252
Scott: Oh, you mean the whole set?

633
00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:32,719
Scott: Yeah, me too.

634
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,420
Rym: Like the Crusader guys with the triangle looking helmets and the horses and the castles.

635
00:39:38,361 --> 00:39:40,499
Scott: They recently came out with a new castle too.

636
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:40,941
Scott: Yeah.

637
00:39:41,282 --> 00:39:47,739
Rym: So I saw this video, the algorithm recommended to me, and it was titled, "The Most Disturbing Lego Set

638
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,080
Rym: Ever.".

639
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:50,968
Rym: And I'm thinking, all right, what's this?

640
00:39:51,008 --> 00:39:52,432
Rym: Some creepypasta thing?

641
00:39:52,553 --> 00:39:53,134
Rym: Like what?

642
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:53,937
Rym: Some backstory?

643
00:39:53,957 --> 00:39:54,057
Rym: Like.

644
00:39:54,097 --> 00:39:54,980
Rym: I'm curious what this will be.

645
00:39:55,421 --> 00:40:00,932
Rym: But then the rest of the title, the subtitle is, "From the Lego Castle 1981 set, one specific

646
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:01,233
Rym: subset.".

647
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:09,320
Rym: One of those little sets you could buy, the ones that your parents would buy for you when they wouldn't buy you like the giant thing.

648
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:12,080
Scott: You mean every single time I went to Toys R Us?

649
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,317
Rym: Yup, we'd get one of those instead of an NES game.

650
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:15,506
Rym: Yup.

651
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:22,992
Rym: Knight's Procession, specifically, which I remembered and we had.

652
00:40:23,353 --> 00:40:24,475
Rym: It was a tiny little set.

653
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,560
Rym: It was like six Lego knight guys.

654
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,188
Scott: I have this one.

655
00:40:27,472 --> 00:40:28,019
Scott: Let's see.

656
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:34,020
Rym: It was six little knight guys with two different kinds of helmets with the original shields and little swords and axes.

657
00:40:34,881 --> 00:40:38,420
Rym: And a little pull cart with wheels with just some stuff in the cart.

658
00:40:40,006 --> 00:40:41,079
Scott: I did not have this one.

659
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,596
Rym: I absolutely had this one.

660
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:50,817
Rym: So this video about this tiny Lego set that has like less than, it has 39 pieces.

661
00:40:50,877 --> 00:40:52,200
Rym: This is not a big Lego set.

662
00:40:52,762 --> 00:40:54,814
Rym: "The Most Disturbing Lego Set

663
00:40:54,915 --> 00:40:55,076
Rym: Ever.".

664
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,539
Rym: I'm looking at this picture and I cannot imagine what they think is disturbing about it.

665
00:41:01,881 --> 00:41:10,529
Rym: So I watched this video and in nine minutes and sixteen seconds this person has made a fairly credible argument that this is a very

666
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:11,950
Scott: oddly specific

667
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:22,060
Rym: and uncharacteristic reference by whoever designed the set at Lego to a specific incident during one of the crusades outside the walls of Jerusalem.

668
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,969
Rym: And I'm not saying this person is right.

669
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:27,360
Rym: I suspect this person is very wrong.

670
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:33,500
Rym: But it's quite a journey to watch this video and I recommend you enjoy it.

671
00:41:36,224 --> 00:41:37,094
Rym: So that's what I got.

672
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:37,600
Rym: What do you got?

673
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:44,755
Scott: So I'm the kind of person where, you know, am I good at that?

674
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:45,478
Scott: many things?

675
00:41:45,979 --> 00:41:46,080
Scott: No.

676
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,624
Scott: Do I know that many things?

677
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:52,980
Scott: No, I just read the internet a lot and then I repeat what I read on the internet and I sound like I know things.

678
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:53,461
Scott: Right.

679
00:41:54,243 --> 00:42:01,220
Scott: But one thing I try to do in life in general is to learn and use correct techniques.

680
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:01,761
Scott: Right.

681
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:13,400
Scott: Even if you're not good at a thing, if you use the correct technique, even if you are not practiced at it, you'll usually just get better results and an easier life overall.

682
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:15,125
Rym: Like mini golf between the two of us.

683
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:19,098
Rym: How many times have we taught some random person we know like how to use a putter?

684
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:20,461
Scott: Yep.

685
00:42:20,763 --> 00:42:21,809
Rym: It's a fairly straightforward.

686
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:23,177
Rym: There's a very specific way to do it.

687
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,481
Scott: Yeah.

688
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,669
Scott: It's like if I'm in the kitchen, can I go chop, chop, chop, chop, chop?

689
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,320
Scott: No, but I hold the knife the way the chef holds the knife.

690
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:29,562
Scott: Yeah.

691
00:42:29,644 --> 00:42:30,320
Rym: I just go slower.

692
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:31,441
Scott: Yeah.

693
00:42:31,601 --> 00:42:32,261
Scott: It's like, yeah.

694
00:42:32,281 --> 00:42:36,465
Scott: So, you know, and I think what in our just in our general society.

695
00:42:36,485 --> 00:42:37,146
Scott: Right.

696
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:52,700
Scott: There are a lot of things for which the correct technique is not like widely known or widely taught, no matter how simple it is or even if it or it's not taught well in a way that people can understand.

697
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:59,780
Rym: That's the part having watched your thing of the day that I think is going on here, because I actually went and grabbed something, tried what's in the video.

698
00:43:00,302 --> 00:43:03,760
Rym: And yeah, I was always doing it that way, but I never thought about it that way.

699
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:04,921
Scott: Right.

700
00:43:05,021 --> 00:43:09,780
Scott: But it's like, you know, or people just don't care about using the correct technique or not coachable.

701
00:43:10,901 --> 00:43:13,428
Scott: But I remember very specifically.

702
00:43:13,448 --> 00:43:13,728
Scott: Right.

703
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:18,340
Scott: It's like when I was actually when I was so old, I was already a counselor at a summer camp.

704
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,688
Scott: I think I was already like in between freshman and sophomore years at RIT.

705
00:43:21,728 --> 00:43:21,848
Scott: Right.

706
00:43:21,868 --> 00:43:23,692
Scott: It was already two thousand something one.

707
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:24,153
Scott: Right.

708
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:24,895
Scott: Two thousand.

709
00:43:24,975 --> 00:43:25,556
Scott: Two thousand.

710
00:43:25,957 --> 00:43:26,097
Scott: Yeah.

711
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:27,180
Scott: Two thousand one summer.

712
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:33,873
Scott: And someone finally taught me like the technique to throw a baseball correctly.

713
00:43:34,173 --> 00:43:34,554
Scott: Right.

714
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:35,777
Scott: I was in little league and shit.

715
00:43:35,817 --> 00:43:37,260
Scott: No one ever taught me that correctly.

716
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,367
Scott: Or at least I was in a way that I understood and remembered.

717
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:40,888
Scott: Right.

718
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:46,560
Scott: And as soon as I followed that technique and I threw the ball and I hit the other guy's glove, it was like pow.

719
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,543
Scott: And I was like, I'm not strong.

720
00:43:48,563 --> 00:43:50,747
Scott: I wasn't strong then and I'm not strong now.

721
00:43:51,127 --> 00:43:51,368
Rym: Yeah.

722
00:43:51,408 --> 00:43:51,588
Rym: Right.

723
00:43:51,848 --> 00:43:52,930
Rym: Skiing is a lot like that.

724
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:54,172
Rym: You do skiing wrong.

725
00:43:54,212 --> 00:43:57,598
Rym: It's like, yeah, but when you feel it, suddenly you're just like a thousand times better.

726
00:43:57,838 --> 00:43:58,960
Rym: The whole world feels different.

727
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,165
Scott: So I came across this YouTube video.

728
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:02,289
Scott: It's like 48 seconds.

729
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:03,092
Scott: It's really short.

730
00:44:03,473 --> 00:44:05,520
Scott: I think it is a YouTube short specifically, maybe.

731
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:11,380
Rym: I got to say, though, watching this, I think I would be better at swinging a bat, even though I would think I was already doing this.

732
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:12,543
Scott: Like this is all you need.

733
00:44:12,563 --> 00:44:14,088
Scott: It's like, why are you hiring a hitting coach?

734
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:17,999
Scott: This guy is a hitting coach for professional baseball, presumably.

735
00:44:18,019 --> 00:44:18,400
Scott: Right.

736
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,426
Scott: Like that's it seems like it's this person's job or part of their job.

737
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:28,240
Scott: And in that short amount of time, he demonstrates the correct technique for swinging a baseball bat.

738
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:31,290
Scott: And it's like, why did they fucking tell me that shit and T-ball?

739
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,959
Scott: I could have smacked the ball right out of the park if I knew that.

740
00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:34,180
Scott: Right.

741
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:45,640
Scott: It's like, um, so yeah, if you are, uh, ever planning to swing a baseball bat for the legitimate purpose or illegitimate purpose.

742
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:53,060
Rym: I would say no, because if you're swinging a baseball bat for an illegitimate purpose, my advice to you is to hold it backwards.

743
00:44:53,581 --> 00:44:55,226
Rym: That sounds crazy and stupid.

744
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:59,999
Rym: You will be way more effective at causing the harm you intend to harm that way.

745
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,317
Scott: Anyway, you could still swing in the way in the video to get the most oomph.

746
00:45:06,281 --> 00:45:09,048
Rym: Also, I feel like you're better off doing a lot more jabbing and poking.

747
00:45:09,128 --> 00:45:13,340
Scott: But anyway, the point is, watch this.

748
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:19,459
Scott: You'll spend one minute and the rest of your life, you will now know the correct technique for this in case you ever have to do it.

749
00:45:19,901 --> 00:45:22,429
Scott: Um, and you'll be like, wow, it'll be so great.

750
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,152
Rym: Oh my God.

751
00:45:23,172 --> 00:45:25,620
Rym: Cause like the pivot around the immobile foot.

752
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,048
Rym: Like I remember being like taught that by my dad.

753
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:31,158
Rym: But the thing with the hands, I did not realize.

754
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:31,900
Rym: that's what happens.

755
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,649
Rym: Like I never, I never in my life heard it described that way.

756
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:38,035
Rym: And that was it.

757
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:38,395
Rym: 42 seconds.

758
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:39,658
Scott: Yep.

759
00:45:39,959 --> 00:45:40,320
Rym: So good.

760
00:45:41,787 --> 00:45:42,480
Rym: In the meta moment.

761
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:43,862
Rym: GeekNights is back.

762
00:45:44,403 --> 00:45:49,533
Rym: The last panel that we did was actually me and Emily at PAX West 2022.

763
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:50,275
Rym: Losing.

764
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,678
Rym: It is online on YouTube.

765
00:45:51,698 --> 00:45:52,399
Rym: You can just watch it.

766
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,527
Rym: Uh, GeekNights will be at PAX Unplugged.

767
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:59,780
Rym: Maybe me and Scott, maybe just me doing one or more panels and workshops.

768
00:45:59,981 --> 00:46:02,849
Rym: But I don't think we'll be hanging around too much outside of that.

769
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:06,300
Scott: Also, as of today, you said you were going to go there and come back in the same day.

770
00:46:06,801 --> 00:46:07,022
Rym: Yep.

771
00:46:07,644 --> 00:46:08,265
Rym: Very likely.

772
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:11,354
Rym: Maybe I'll spend one night and head back the following day.

773
00:46:11,595 --> 00:46:13,400
Rym: TBD on the schedule of the panels and everything.

774
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,424
Rym: I will warn you, all the hotels are sold out.

775
00:46:16,684 --> 00:46:16,965
Rym: So.

776
00:46:17,806 --> 00:46:18,047
Scott: Yeah.

777
00:46:18,087 --> 00:46:26,620
Scott: I mean, I'm not, I'm either, I'm only, the only chance of me going with the sold out hotel situation is, you know, someplace else to stay.

778
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,172
Scott: Like a friend's house who lives nearby or not staying.

779
00:46:30,273 --> 00:46:32,039
Rym: And we will probably just bring the car.

780
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,325
Rym: It is a real easy trip.

781
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:42,560
Rym: And also I got to tell you, cause I know you have, I have presented at a few PAXes without you during the quarantine.

782
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:52,280
Rym: It is hard to describe how much life it gives me to be on stage at a PAX with people giving a talk instead of doing the podcast.

783
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,226
Rym: Like I didn't forget how much I loved it.

784
00:46:55,327 --> 00:46:57,292
Rym: I underestimated how much I missed.

785
00:46:57,352 --> 00:46:58,675
Rym: it is how I would describe it.

786
00:46:59,036 --> 00:47:00,139
Rym: There's a certain energy there.

787
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:00,560
Rym: So we'll see.

788
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,143
Scott: We'll see what happens.

789
00:47:02,243 --> 00:47:02,424
Scott: Yep.

790
00:47:02,705 --> 00:47:03,989
Rym: I will also be a Zenkai Con.

791
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,212
Rym: I even booked the hotel room.

792
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:07,800
Rym: I'll do a whole bunch of solo versions of our panels.

793
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,690
Rym: Scott won't come to Zenkai Con even in non-COVID times.

794
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:12,277
Scott: No, I wouldn't come there without a pandemic.

795
00:47:12,317 --> 00:47:12,980
Scott: I'm definitely not going to.

796
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,682
Rym: I don't know why.

797
00:47:13,842 --> 00:47:19,939
Rym: Most of Zenkai Con is me, Chris, Anthony, and Scojo playing tabletop board games sometimes with Matt Morgan.

798
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:20,320
Rym: So.

799
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,121
Scott: I'm good.

800
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:22,685
Rym: I don't know.

801
00:47:22,725 --> 00:47:26,996
Rym: It's basically just, it's a fantastic con that we just don't even go into except for the panels.

802
00:47:27,438 --> 00:47:28,280
Rym: But I digress.

803
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,998
Scott: Why don't we just do that at my apartment then?

804
00:47:30,901 --> 00:47:31,622
Rym: We could do that too.

805
00:47:32,444 --> 00:47:33,746
Rym: The Gignies Book Club book.

806
00:47:34,527 --> 00:47:39,374
Rym: Binti, which I will also, as Scott had pointed out, Binti is very short.

807
00:47:40,096 --> 00:47:42,940
Rym: It's actually a trilogy of three also very short books.

808
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:44,362
Rym: I read all three.

809
00:47:44,382 --> 00:47:45,665
Rym: Scott read all three.

810
00:47:45,705 --> 00:47:47,290
Scott: They take like an hour each.

811
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,433
Rym: We'll talk about all three.

812
00:47:48,453 --> 00:47:50,277
Rym: It's fantastic.

813
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:51,300
Rym: It is Space College.

814
00:47:52,022 --> 00:47:59,540
Rym: And basically, if you don't know what it's about, it's going to set itself up like, all right, cool person's going to Space College.

815
00:48:00,061 --> 00:48:01,926
Rym: They're probably experiencing racism.

816
00:48:01,966 --> 00:48:03,129
Rym: Let's see where this is going.

817
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:07,260
Rym: And then the jellyfish show up out of nowhere and it goes way off the rails.

818
00:48:07,621 --> 00:48:10,527
Rym: But it still stays true to that original starting story.

819
00:48:10,547 --> 00:48:15,138
Rym: I would love to see this animated in some fashion.

820
00:48:15,178 --> 00:48:16,000
Rym: I think it would be great.

821
00:48:16,723 --> 00:48:20,540
Scott: It would be a good animated one, yeah, especially with all the wild characters and such.

822
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:22,924
Scott: All right.

823
00:48:23,225 --> 00:48:25,010
Rym: Otherwise, Scott's working on the website.

824
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,113
Rym: Pay attention to our stuff.

825
00:48:27,035 --> 00:48:28,700
Rym: We'll be mostly doing content like normal.

826
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:34,937
Rym: Whenever the new Advanced Wars that was delayed because of the war actually comes out, I am going to be live streaming it.

827
00:48:34,977 --> 00:48:35,820
Rym: So stay tuned for that.

828
00:48:36,564 --> 00:48:37,900
Rym: And let's talk about web scraping.

829
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:39,442
Scott: Yeah.

830
00:48:39,563 --> 00:48:45,540
Scott: So when you have a website, right, especially a dynamic website, even if it's just a blog.

831
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:45,981
Scott: Right.

832
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:54,320
Scott: But it could also be something like, I don't know, a sports stats website or news website or any kind of information providing website.

833
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,344
Scott: IMDB, Wikipedia.

834
00:48:56,564 --> 00:48:56,785
Scott: Right.

835
00:48:57,246 --> 00:49:02,760
Scott: All these websites are backed up by databases, Postgres databases, MySQL databases, Oracle databases.

836
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:03,282
Scott: Right.

837
00:49:03,322 --> 00:49:07,820
Scott: But you can't just go in and given people access directly to the database.

838
00:49:08,542 --> 00:49:11,660
Rym: So a lot of people do by accident, but that's a whole other conversation.

839
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:15,579
Scott: It's really bad for a lot of reasons that we can't really discuss right now.

840
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:15,780
Scott: Right.

841
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:23,880
Scott: It would actually be really nice if you had a way to do it securely, safely and a way that protects your resources and whatnot.

842
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,263
Rym: But so what I'll say?

843
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:31,779
Rym: not to decide that is the kind of thing that I provide as a service and I'm a product manager for my day job.

844
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:32,866
Scott: But it's not.

845
00:49:32,906 --> 00:49:34,255
Scott: you're not making that available.

846
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:34,960
Scott: It's like the public.

847
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,579
Rym: No, that is not available to the public.

848
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:37,541
Scott: Right.

849
00:49:37,822 --> 00:49:39,786
Scott: Plenty of people provide private database access.

850
00:49:39,826 --> 00:49:41,550
Scott: I'm talking about public database access.

851
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:45,820
Scott: Like anyone can just go connect to database, select star from.

852
00:49:45,961 --> 00:49:46,203
Scott: Right.

853
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:46,545
Scott: It's like.

854
00:49:46,586 --> 00:49:48,400
Scott: no one does that on purpose.

855
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:55,720
Scott: So what ends up happening is the only way to access the information that is in the database is via the website.

856
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:56,382
Rym: Wait a minute.

857
00:49:56,402 --> 00:49:57,147
Rym: I said a great idea.

858
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:58,253
Rym: I don't have to interrupt you.

859
00:49:58,514 --> 00:49:59,440
Rym: We should make this website.

860
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,726
Rym: It would fail and collapse instantly.

861
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,852
Rym: Let's make Wikibase.

862
00:50:04,153 --> 00:50:06,138
Rym: It's just a public database.

863
00:50:06,198 --> 00:50:06,780
Rym: Everybody go nuts.

864
00:50:08,221 --> 00:50:08,711
Scott: OK, go ahead.

865
00:50:08,813 --> 00:50:09,180
Scott: Here's SQL.

866
00:50:10,162 --> 00:50:14,160
Scott: So you have a database and then the database is not accessible to the Internet.

867
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:14,762
Scott: Right.

868
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:18,100
Scott: And then you have a Web server and the Web server can access the database.

869
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:22,438
Scott: But the Web server only has so many SQL queries that it will willingly run.

870
00:50:23,323 --> 00:50:23,505
Scott: Right.

871
00:50:23,545 --> 00:50:25,120
Scott: That are written in the code of the website.

872
00:50:25,681 --> 00:50:27,605
Scott: And then people visit the website.

873
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:34,300
Scott: The website runs the SQL queries, gets data from the database and then shows it to you in HTML form.

874
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,759
Rym: Which to back up a little bit.

875
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:37,131
Scott: Or JSON.

876
00:50:37,273 --> 00:50:38,060
Scott: JSON structure.

877
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:55,120
Rym: HTML and markup languages like it are just a standardized way to take effectively raw information from a source and mark it up in a way that can then be processed by an interpreter and displayed to a human or provided to some other service.

878
00:50:55,562 --> 00:50:56,687
Rym: In a standardized way.

879
00:50:57,189 --> 00:50:59,540
Rym: So the raw data comes to your Web browser.

880
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:13,220
Rym: Your Web browser parses this markdown of that data and presents a visualization that if you recall how the Internet was designed, how it was envisioned, the reason it exists and how it should be used and maintained.

881
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:18,439
Rym: You can render that information however you see fit on your end.

882
00:51:19,381 --> 00:51:41,320
Scott: So the reality is that people who aren't technologically sophisticated are sort of forced by lack of know how, lack of ability, lack of resources to engage with the data in the database on the terms of the person who owns and runs the database.

883
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:46,060
Scott: The service operator sets the terms and the people just sort of have to go along with it.

884
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:52,980
Scott: If you want to go to a normal person wants to see like the scores of every Mets game.

885
00:51:53,642 --> 00:51:53,924
Scott: Right.

886
00:51:54,146 --> 00:51:55,819
Scott: Until they got hosed last night.

887
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,778
Scott: The whole season.

888
00:51:58,931 --> 00:51:59,140
Scott: Right.

889
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,943
Scott: They would have to go to like.

890
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:09,840
Scott: they would have to open up the Web browser, go to a game and they'd probably do something like fucking copy and paste and they go to the next game and copy and paste or something like that.

891
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:10,440
Scott: Right.

892
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:17,620
Scott: But if you're technologically sophisticated, there is not much that stops you from writing a computer program.

893
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:22,280
Scott: Now, of course, you can't hit the database directly, which would be the most efficient way of getting the data.

894
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,517
Scott: It would take a fraction of a second to get all of it.

895
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:40,180
Scott: But you can have the computer just visit all the Web pages really quickly, save all the Web pages and then process all those Web pages and parse the data out of them right into what is now your database.

896
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:41,457
Scott: And now you're good to go.

897
00:52:41,747 --> 00:52:41,960
Scott: Right.

898
00:52:42,361 --> 00:52:57,400
Scott: And that's called Web scraping because you're basically going to Web pages and scraping the data off of them right into your own database to get access to a large amount of information that is being made freely available.

899
00:52:58,081 --> 00:53:05,159
Scott: But the people making it freely available weren't making it like in bulk freely available, but it kind of were and they kind of weren't.

900
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:19,074
Rym: Now, this is where things get spicy, because on one hand, the Internet, the World Wide Web was envisioned to be a completely open and mutual sharing of information, meaning I provide information, but other people have access to that.

901
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:24,760
Rym: information is kind of like I have taken this data and I've put it out on the street and anyone is allowed to partake.

902
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:38,200
Scott: So legally, as of April this year, there was actually a case in an appeals court and they have affirmed that Web scraping publicly accessible data is legal.

903
00:53:38,561 --> 00:53:42,840
Scott: Now, that's just the scraping part of it, though, right?

904
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:52,920
Scott: If I was to say scrape Rym website, right, which is full of Rym's copyrighted information or whatever, and I put it, I scrape it and put in a database.

905
00:53:53,643 --> 00:53:54,720
Scott: OK, nothing illegal.

906
00:53:55,262 --> 00:53:58,219
Scott: But if I then go and make Scott clone of Rym's Web site.

907
00:53:58,723 --> 00:54:00,460
Scott: Well, now that's not right.

908
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:07,094
Scott: It's like copying someone's Web site might not be legal, but now collecting the data on its own might be.

909
00:54:07,314 --> 00:54:09,860
Rym: the crime is not getting the data or scraping.

910
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,640
Rym: The crime is now you're republishing it and violating copyright.

911
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:13,866
Rym: Effectively.

912
00:54:13,886 --> 00:54:14,007
Scott: Yeah.

913
00:54:14,048 --> 00:54:15,339
Scott: Or who knows what it could be?

914
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:18,460
Scott: Some other thing you're now this gets extra spicy.

915
00:54:19,101 --> 00:54:24,600
Rym: What if Rym website has information that is objective?

916
00:54:25,225 --> 00:54:25,508
Rym: I have.

917
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,580
Rym: I have equations.

918
00:54:27,061 --> 00:54:28,706
Rym: I have weather information like.

919
00:54:28,786 --> 00:54:33,640
Rym: I have objective, universally agreed upon and generic information on my Web site.

920
00:54:34,741 --> 00:54:35,798
Rym: Scott could scrape that for me.

921
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:38,320
Rym: He might scrape it from someone else who could.

922
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,780
Rym: There's no way to prove where Scott got that information.

923
00:54:41,183 --> 00:54:43,319
Rym: And if Scott there can be well, we'll get to that.

924
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:54,240
Rym: If Scott publishes that information, you generally can't have copyright on individual well-known proven facts with a big asterisk that there's a lot of complicated edge cases.

925
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:03,960
Scott: But let's say in my data, copyright would be like I scrape Rym's Web site of all his short stories and I publish a Kindle book.

926
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:05,478
Scott: That would be a copyright violation.

927
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:14,560
Rym: So what if I aggregate data from a bunch of other Web sites and make a new data set that provides novel insights without republishing that data itself?

928
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,060
Rym: Now, it's again, it's not a question of Web scraping.

929
00:55:18,522 --> 00:55:22,140
Rym: That is the question of data aggregation, data attribution, et cetera.

930
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:28,960
Rym: Web scraping itself should be noncontroversial and should absolutely be 100 percent legal forever.

931
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:37,320
Rym: But most of the fights around it are around what people do with that information after the fact, not the scraping itself.

932
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:38,702
Scott: Exactly.

933
00:55:38,742 --> 00:55:44,580
Scott: Now, one thing that happens is sometimes people will set up their Web servers to be anti scraping.

934
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:44,961
Scott: Right.

935
00:55:45,302 --> 00:55:52,600
Scott: They'll do things like blocking user agents that don't match the user agents of normal Web browsers, which you can get around pretty easily.

936
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:58,680
Scott: They'll do things like rate limiting, like someone has hit our Web site and requested a shit ton of pages really quickly.

937
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:00,871
Scott: Let's block their IP address now.

938
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:02,740
Scott: They're hitting they're visiting us too much.

939
00:56:02,841 --> 00:56:04,209
Scott: That's clearly not a human being.

940
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:05,780
Rym: Now, they're within their rights to do that.

941
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:11,420
Rym: But simultaneously, I'm within my rights to spin up a thousand Amazon businesses with different IPs to scrape that data.

942
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:14,414
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, and there's a lot of things going on, right?

943
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,580
Scott: I mean, what is Google?

944
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,184
Scott: Google's entire business is Web scraping.

945
00:56:18,224 --> 00:56:31,960
Scott: The Google bot goes around scraping the entire Web and then you Google search something and they search their database, which is a copy of most of the Web that they've scraped with the Google bot.

946
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:40,940
Scott: And then they show you results without actually sending you to anyone's Web site, just showing you data they've scraped from other people's Web sites.

947
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:42,002
Scott: Yeah.

948
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:46,019
Scott: And this is what all the fight is about things like Google News and Australia and all this stuff.

949
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:46,220
Scott: Right.

950
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,152
Rym: It's like, you know, and this is getting like.

951
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,120
Rym: capitalism is partly the problem here.

952
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,260
Rym: The true intent of the Internet is is up for debate here.

953
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:55,483
Rym: There's a lot going on.

954
00:56:55,523 --> 00:57:11,220
Rym: But a big part of this is a lot of Web scraping is used for commercial purposes and data aggregation, but also a lot of Web scraping is used to bridge the non-technical and the technical or to bridge the inept technical with the technical.

955
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:11,962
Rym: Case in point.

956
00:57:12,002 --> 00:57:12,906
Rym: Imagine a restaurant.

957
00:57:13,528 --> 00:57:14,673
Rym: Restaurant has a Web site.

958
00:57:15,094 --> 00:57:16,500
Rym: The Web site posts its hours.

959
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:26,119
Rym: Good luck finding that Web site because that Web site was made by someone's nephew in nineteen ninety nine and hasn't changed in 20 years.

960
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,669
Rym: But you want to find out when this restaurant is open.

961
00:57:29,172 --> 00:57:30,740
Rym: You don't want to call this restaurant.

962
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:36,140
Rym: You want to go to some map service or type the name of the restaurant and just see what the hours are.

963
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:40,820
Rym: And you don't necessarily want to have to go to 10 different restaurants Web sites to figure out when things are open or not.

964
00:57:41,181 --> 00:57:44,511
Rym: So that kind of data aggregation is just a quality of life thing.

965
00:57:45,213 --> 00:57:47,720
Scott: Most restaurants did the person who runs that restaurant.

966
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,323
Scott: They have a shitty Web site.

967
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:56,100
Scott: But did that person go to Yelp, to Grubhub, to Seamless, to Google Maps, to Apple Maps and type in their hours?

968
00:57:56,521 --> 00:58:00,012
Scott: Did they go and update their hours to match their real hours?

969
00:58:00,413 --> 00:58:02,640
Scott: It's like, no, that person is not doing any of those things.

970
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,562
Scott: They're running the restaurant.

971
00:58:03,582 --> 00:58:09,720
Scott: They're ordering food, cooking food, managing employees, cleaning, hoping the health inspector doesn't come.

972
00:58:10,543 --> 00:58:11,065
Scott: That's what they're.

973
00:58:11,085 --> 00:58:11,928
Scott: that's what they're up to.

974
00:58:12,048 --> 00:58:12,289
Scott: Right.

975
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:14,979
Scott: Dealing with customers that are annoying, et cetera.

976
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:25,080
Scott: So but as long as the information is somewhere out there in a really shitty, hard to find place, all those other services that people actually use.

977
00:58:25,581 --> 00:58:25,881
Scott: Right.

978
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:33,540
Scott: Can scrape it, put it into a database that's, you know, more easily searched, more technologically up to date.

979
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:37,106
Scott: And then when you ask Siri, hey, when's the restaurant open?

980
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:45,100
Scott: Siri says, ah, it's open at seven, because somewhere along the line, they scrape that shit from somewhere and put it in some database.

981
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:58,900
Rym: Now, this is a topic for another show, but a logical extension of this that caused a big brouhaha, and I actually just used it today, which made things extra funny, is you can apply Web scraping to humans.

982
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:04,710
Rym: Imagine a hotel, a bed and breakfast that doesn't even have a Web site.

983
00:59:05,631 --> 00:59:08,096
Rym: They just have a phone number and you can call.

984
00:59:08,376 --> 00:59:10,640
Rym: or maybe they have a Web site that says they exist.

985
00:59:11,001 --> 00:59:12,665
Rym: And on that Web site is a phone number.

986
00:59:13,026 --> 00:59:18,420
Rym: But to reserve a room, you can't go to like any of the Web sites that help you reserve hotel rooms.

987
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,844
Rym: You can't even go to their Web site.

988
00:59:20,085 --> 00:59:25,160
Rym: You have to call them and talk to a human because they have not used modern technology.

989
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,769
Rym: Now, there's two ways to approach that for me, an impatient nerd who wants to book a hotel room.

990
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:36,840
Rym: My previous answer for most of my life would be if you don't have a Web site, I will not engage in commerce with you.

991
00:59:37,464 --> 00:59:38,420
Scott: Or you could just fucking call them.

992
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,739
Rym: I don't have Web sites that don't exist.

993
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,585
Scott: You just call them.

994
00:59:41,685 --> 00:59:43,937
Scott: Engage with them on their own terms.

995
00:59:43,977 --> 00:59:44,560
Scott: What's the problem?

996
00:59:45,021 --> 00:59:46,684
Rym: So here's my actual use case.

997
00:59:46,844 --> 00:59:50,190
Rym: Usually I'm just going somewhere like a small town to ski or on that bike trip.

998
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,353
Rym: I see there's like 10 hotels in town.

999
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:54,477
Rym: I just want to see which of them have rooms.

1000
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:55,018
Rym: Pick one.

1001
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,200
Rym: Don't really care which one I stay in.

1002
00:59:56,601 --> 01:00:01,520
Rym: If three of them have online booking and I can click and it just works, I'm not going to call the rest of them to figure out their opening.

1003
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,407
Scott: Of course.

1004
01:00:02,508 --> 01:00:02,770
Scott: Yes.

1005
01:00:02,911 --> 01:00:03,153
Scott: Yes.

1006
01:00:03,193 --> 01:00:04,000
Scott: That makes perfect sense.

1007
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:11,970
Rym: So I see a hotel that looks like it has rooms, but you can't actually book rooms on their site.

1008
01:00:12,511 --> 01:00:19,480
Rym: So I clicked on the Google assistant and it had a robot call the hotel and talk to a human.

1009
01:00:20,182 --> 01:00:24,780
Rym: And it eventually reserved the room for me at this hotel.

1010
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:29,080
Scott: And what if the human was like, well, the human clearly knows it's a robot that's calling.

1011
01:00:29,521 --> 01:00:36,334
Rym: Only because Google agreed based on complaints when they first launched this thing that it would say it was a robot.

1012
01:00:36,374 --> 01:00:39,240
Rym: A lot of people were really mad that it might not say it's a robot.

1013
01:00:39,981 --> 01:00:40,141
Scott: Right.

1014
01:00:40,162 --> 01:00:45,257
Scott: But what if the person heard, you know, realized that you could tell it's a robot if you're intelligent.

1015
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:45,478
Scott: Right.

1016
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:46,020
Scott: It's not hard.

1017
01:00:46,682 --> 01:00:47,768
Rym: I've been called by this person.

1018
01:00:47,848 --> 01:00:49,799
Scott: It's like a Google bot reservation hang up.

1019
01:00:50,942 --> 01:00:59,659
Rym: I mean, they could have, but in that case now, once again, they have walled themselves off from how most modern people will engage with things like renting a hotel room.

1020
01:01:00,801 --> 01:01:09,960
Scott: But the point is, is that, you know, that isn't a web scraping technology, but it is something that's only possible because of web scraping.

1021
01:01:10,321 --> 01:01:12,888
Scott: Get scraping that phone number from somewhere.

1022
01:01:13,008 --> 01:01:13,410
Scott: Yeah.

1023
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:17,200
Scott: And any information, the metadata around the phone number as well.

1024
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,048
Scott: That is the phone number of a BNB in this place.

1025
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:24,140
Scott: You know, here's some photos of it that we scraped and collected together, et cetera.

1026
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:24,520
Rym: Yeah.

1027
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:25,984
Rym: It gets into the whole scale thing.

1028
01:01:26,004 --> 01:01:28,611
Rym: Remember, people freaked out about scraping the real world.

1029
01:01:28,912 --> 01:01:31,880
Rym: Google Maps started having photos of the streets and street view.

1030
01:01:32,261 --> 01:01:37,110
Rym: And suddenly there was the debate of it's not illegal to take a picture of a random place for a public street.

1031
01:01:37,551 --> 01:01:41,740
Rym: But what if you take a picture of every place from every street?

1032
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,407
Scott: Suddenly you start using image recognition to read all the signs and all the businesses.

1033
01:01:46,567 --> 01:01:47,168
Scott: Yeah.

1034
01:01:47,529 --> 01:01:54,080
Rym: You could scrape if a restaurant is open from the picture of their restaurant and the sign at the door potentially.

1035
01:01:54,843 --> 01:01:55,064
Scott: Yep.

1036
01:01:55,606 --> 01:01:57,594
Scott: If the resolution was high enough, you sure could.

1037
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,020
Scott: And the picture was recent enough.

1038
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:15,000
Rym: But I'm generally of the mind with web scraping that the Internet very much websites that are publicly available have to generally be treated the same way that we treat things that are visible from public streets in the real world.

1039
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:18,138
Rym: And I can't see any strong argument against that.

1040
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,141
Rym: Nope.

1041
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:26,995
Scott: So if you want to do some web scraping, right, let's say, you know, there's some data you want to collect and there's no public source of that data.

1042
01:02:27,015 --> 01:02:30,020
Scott: that's in a database form, like a spreadsheet or something.

1043
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:36,974
Scott: You have to, you know, you know, a CSV file, but you know that there's a website that has the information.

1044
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:40,020
Scott: It would just take you a long time to copy and paste all those web pages.

1045
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:40,741
Scott: Right.

1046
01:02:41,402 --> 01:02:42,784
Scott: You can make a web scraper.

1047
01:02:42,864 --> 01:02:47,752
Scott: And this generally requires computer programming, but not very difficult computer programming.

1048
01:02:48,213 --> 01:02:53,060
Scott: And there's a lot of tools that already exist to solve a lot of the problems you're going to come across.

1049
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,224
Scott: Like, how do I visit a Web page?

1050
01:02:55,264 --> 01:02:57,067
Scott: So many Web pages very quickly.

1051
01:02:57,087 --> 01:03:05,000
Scott: How do I crawl and visit one Web page, find all the URLs on that Web page, visit them and then visit those URLs recursively.

1052
01:03:05,621 --> 01:03:06,222
Scott: How do I do that?

1053
01:03:06,603 --> 01:03:09,890
Scott: How do I want to get the HTML back from the Web site?

1054
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:14,840
Scott: How do I pick out the pieces of data that I'm interested in and organize them into a spreadsheet?

1055
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:16,484
Scott: How do I do this in mass?

1056
01:03:16,725 --> 01:03:22,280
Scott: How do I do it fast enough that it doesn't take too long, but slow enough that nobody catches on and blocks me?

1057
01:03:22,461 --> 01:03:26,020
Rym: It is so much easier now than the days of writing for loops with WGAD.

1058
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:27,421
Scott: Right.

1059
01:03:27,481 --> 01:03:27,681
Scott: Yeah.

1060
01:03:27,922 --> 01:03:30,085
Scott: So you could probably still do that to a lot of Web sites.

1061
01:03:30,165 --> 01:03:38,699
Scott: But what I would recommend, at least as a way to start, is there is a library called Scrapy, S-C-R-A-P-Y.

1062
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:39,560
Scott: Right.

1063
01:03:39,601 --> 01:03:51,640
Scott: P-Y as in Python, that is, you know, basically allows you to do write a program and it solves all those common Web scraping problems for you.

1064
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:57,087
Scott: And you can fully concentrate the code that you write on your specific use case.

1065
01:03:57,187 --> 01:03:57,387
Scott: Right.

1066
01:03:57,447 --> 01:04:07,820
Scott: Which pieces of data on the page, which page you visiting, you know, et cetera, and ignore all those sort of things that every Web scraper has to do because they're already done for you.

1067
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:16,600
Scott: And, you know, if you're doing something extra fancy, extra high performance, a big deal, that might not be a permanent solution because it's not the fastest.

1068
01:04:17,281 --> 01:04:20,448
Scott: But for most cases, it'll get you all the way there.

1069
01:04:20,869 --> 01:04:25,720
Scott: And for just about all cases, it'll be the perfect starting place to get you going.

1070
01:04:27,021 --> 01:04:33,120
Scott: You know, I don't know of any other like it's like it really is like the most popular Web scraping thing I know of.

1071
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:41,380
Rym: I don't know of any other one that is as big a deal as as long as you're not doing something like scraping data to republish it or all the things that get another authority stuff.

1072
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:48,220
Rym: Honestly, if you can come if you can scrape the Web to make your personal life locally easier, by all means, do it.

1073
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:49,083
Rym: It's a cool thing.

1074
01:04:49,103 --> 01:04:50,328
