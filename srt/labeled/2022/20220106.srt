1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,230
Rym: It's Thursday, January 6th, 2022.

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:11,532
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:14,876
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,628
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:21,740
Rym: We are talking about sports commentating, sportscasting, and possibly even shoutcasting.

6
00:00:23,402 --> 00:00:24,397
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:33,741
Rym: Yep, it's a weird feeling to know that there's a magfest happening that I'm not at, and I'm very glad I'm not there.

8
00:00:33,802 --> 00:00:34,527
Rym: It started today.

9
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:37,149
Rym: It's like, kind of just kicking off right now-ish.

10
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:39,550
Scott: Okay.

11
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:43,250
Scott: Have fun getting sick, magfest people.

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:43,696
Rym: Yep.

13
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:45,842
Scott: I mean, I hope you don't.

14
00:00:45,943 --> 00:00:46,890
Scott: That would be actually great.

15
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:58,369
Scott: But, you know, it's like if I see someone walking into a fire, it's like, wow, I sure hope they don't get horrible burns, but I expect them to get horrible burns and I can't stop them.

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,905
Scott: So that's how it is.

17
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:01,269
Scott: The end.

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,612
Rym: Yep.

19
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:02,790
Rym: I hope people don't get sick.

20
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:09,249
Rym: I kind of just assume that like 20 to 40 percent of everyone who shows up there is going to get COVID, but we'll see.

21
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:10,859
Rym: Good luck.

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,569
Rym: Have fun with that.

23
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:16,210
Rym: At least a much more safe to attend event is coming up very soon.

24
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:17,585
Rym: The old AGDQ.

25
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:19,308
Scott: Oh, yeah.

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,749
Scott: Schedule's looking pretty good.

27
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,969
Scott: We got, you know, some cool kid Mega Man 2 going on.

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:24,214
Rym: Ooh.

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,908
Scott: You know, you got some, you got one of the best links in the past.

30
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:31,930
Rym: I did not even look at the schedule yet, actually.

31
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:33,969
Scott: One of the best link to the past.

32
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,250
Scott: You know, Japanese runners is going to be on there because that's the benefit of doing the digital one, right?

33
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,810
Scott: Suddenly you get runners from a wider area there instead of a geographic area.

34
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,490
Scott: You know, that person probably would never have been able to appear.

35
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,350
Scott: Ooh, Hitman.

36
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:52,750
Rym: I don't super enjoy Hitman games, but speed runs are real funny usually.

37
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,290
Scott: Speed runs of a lot of games that I don't like are real good.

38
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,270
Scott: You know, I don't like to play any of them Souls games, but I watch some Souls speed runs.

39
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:01,188
Rym: Yep, for sure.

40
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:03,410
Rym: Oh, they got Geoguessr again.

41
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,549
Rym: Okay, I'm excited about that.

42
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,769
Scott: Geoguessr's always good.

43
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:09,270
Scott: That's a new... The Tetris is back again also.

44
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,649
Scott: They got some fan favorites in there.

45
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,132
Rym: What?

46
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,990
Rym: The Sailor Moon R game?

47
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:14,815
Rym: All right.

48
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:16,410
Rym: Anyway, you can look at the schedule.

49
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,190
Rym: We'll talk about this more on a Tuesday, but AGDQ's coming.

50
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:20,330
Rym: I'm ready.

51
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,830
Rym: It starts on... What's the actual date?

52
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,947
Rym: It starts officially the 9th.

53
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,762
Scott: Two or three days the 9th.

54
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,668
Scott: So Sunday.

55
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:26,228
Scott: Three days.

56
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:28,289
Rym: This coming Sunday it starts.

57
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:30,849
Rym: Oops, I got right into the news.

58
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:46,589
Rym: If you... I hope you're aware of this, but it's the one-year anniversary of when in America the Republican Party, one of our political parties, staged a violent coup attempt, tried to murder the Vice President and the Speaker of the House.

59
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:54,030
Rym: A whole shitstorm went down, and on the anniversary of it, the President of the United States, Joe Biden, just gave a speech.

60
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:57,030
Rym: And I highly encourage you all watch it because it's not long.

61
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:58,550
Rym: It's only, like, 30 minutes long.

62
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,590
Rym: And that includes the preamble and Kamala Harris giving, like, a pre-speech.

63
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,109
Rym: Like, it's not a super long speech.

64
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:11,870
Rym: And for those of us who are super, super wired into politics, it might not seem like this speech is that big a deal.

65
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,670
Rym: Like, we know it was an insurrection.

66
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,890
Rym: The President saying it was for the first time doesn't, like, change anything.

67
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:28,369
Rym: But you gotta remember, most people in America, they don't actually pay attention to politics except around every two to four years during an election or when there's a big news about it.

68
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:34,070
Rym: And it's easy to underestimate the importance to regular, inattentive people.

69
00:03:34,491 --> 00:03:40,469
Rym: When the President says out loud there was a violent coup attempt, like, for real, directly blames Trump for it.

70
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:47,670
Rym: It's a speech that is a big deal to the kind of people who we really need to pay attention and vote in the upcoming election.

71
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:55,370
Scott: I mean, it's nice to hear, you know, the elected people actually, you know, believing the same thing that we believe, right?

72
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:58,006
Scott: Which is, you know, that shit is not great.

73
00:03:59,132 --> 00:03:59,788
Scott: So that's nice.

74
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:07,070
Scott: But I still don't, you know, it's like, okay, you agree with me, right, that we're in a desperate time.

75
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:10,210
Scott: That's actually nice to hear because you haven't said that before.

76
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,370
Scott: So A plus, right?

77
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,610
Scott: But if I'm in your position, you know, desperate time calls to the desperate measure.

78
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,670
Scott: Where's the desperate measure?

79
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:19,759
Scott: You're the President.

80
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,950
Scott: Have you taken a desperate measure?

81
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:22,310
Scott: I haven't seen one, right?

82
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:29,570
Scott: You know, my anxiety will not go away until you take a desperate measure or attempt to take a desperate measure.

83
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:32,690
Scott: At least attempt and fail at the desperate measure.

84
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:34,309
Scott: That would still reduce my anxiety.

85
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:49,870
Rym: To a degree, though, because actually studies have shown that previous failed, like, try a big thing, like an EO that immediately gets shut down, not only doesn't move the needle at all, but in many cases it builds antipathy and resistance to the President who fails.

86
00:04:50,572 --> 00:05:12,972
Scott: You have to do it in such a way, right, where even if it doesn't succeed, it has a chance to partially succeed or at least causes the opposite side to have to spend energy and resources fighting it in order to make it fail and then you can tire them out by making them fight and, you know, basically That

87
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:22,590
Rym: is actually kind of what's going on because the thing that the President is doing is through the DOJ, the one place where the executive branch has a huge amount of power.

88
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:42,247
Rym: And Garland gave a speech, what, yesterday or two days ago and talked a lot about how the charges from January 6th that have happened so far and the prosecution that happened so far is typical of significant investigations where they bring very small charges first while they're gathering information for the coming big charges.

89
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,190
Scott: That's how our justice system works, yes, that's how it works.

90
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:45,970
Rym: But more importantly...

91
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:53,949
Scott: You know, you find someone who's, you know, because a lot of our justice system was built on fighting mafias, right, especially the FBI.

92
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,510
Rym: I mean, that's how they investigated Watergate.

93
00:05:57,811 --> 00:06:05,830
Scott: Right, so a lot of our laws are struck and the way our law enforcement operates is around that same kind of ideas, right?

94
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:13,770
Scott: It's like, okay, find some henchmen, right, give the henchmen a cut them a deal if they spill the beans on the boss, right?

95
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:19,630
Scott: And then, even if the boss did all these loopholes, you get Al Capone on tax evasion or some shit, right?

96
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:23,210
Scott: So, that's still the playbook, mostly.

97
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:30,149
Scott: They have other playbooks, but that's still playbook number one as far as federal prosecutors go.

98
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:32,850
Scott: So, they're following that playbook.

99
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:40,770
Rym: Yeah, and the other thing you can do if independent of the real courts is the court of public spectacle.

100
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:45,870
Rym: Not public opinion, because a public opinion in America is sadly simple.

101
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,370
Rym: Like, you can literally look at metrics like gas prices go up, current president unpopular.

102
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,230
Rym: Like, Americans are just kind of particularly bad at this, but...

103
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,790
Scott: I mean, you know, population density directly correlates to who wins elections where.

104
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:14,109
Rym: Yup, but... So, with the January 6th committee, the House of the United States is the other entity that actually has a lot of power, and they're moving into, now, for basically the rest of this year, public hearings as opposed to private hearings.

105
00:07:15,763 --> 00:07:15,909
Rym: Okay.

106
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,809
Rym: So, that's actually a pretty big one, too.

107
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:32,130
Rym: But I do encourage all of you out there, if you don't pay attention to politics, watch this speech because it is a subtle change in tone, similar to when his earlier speeches around the COVID response shifted to addressing the anger at the unvaccinated and how justified it is.

108
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:41,550
Rym: It's a similar tone shift because, really, if you went to American high schools or middle schools, even, you learned that the primary power of the president in America is the bully pulpit.

109
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,450
Rym: You can go Google that and figure out what that means if you've never encountered that term before.

110
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,189
Scott: Not enough bullying going on.

111
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:50,430
Scott: Too much speaking softly, not enough big stick.

112
00:07:50,650 --> 00:08:00,930
Rym: I'm trying to think of the last non-insane fascist president who actually used the bully pulpit strongly, and I think we're already going back to, like, FDR era.

113
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:05,910
Rym: Carter tried, but America hated him for no good reason.

114
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:07,864
Rym: But I digress.

115
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:08,489
Rym: You got any news?

116
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:10,636
Scott: Do we have news?

117
00:08:10,677 --> 00:08:17,025
Scott: Well, the reason we thought to do this show is because the legendary John Madden passed away at the age of 85, right?

118
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:19,749
Rym: Not a bad run.

119
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:42,409
Scott: I think everyone knows the name Madden because it's on the number one football game there is, but I don't know how many of our listeners are, A, old enough to have ever seen John Madden broadcast a football game, from the United States, or even if they are the age, did they ever watch fucking football?

120
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:50,388
Scott: There are plenty of nerds who are my age who could have seen John Madden, but were nerds and they didn't watch football, so they never saw him, right?

121
00:08:51,910 --> 00:09:01,530
Scott: But I guess I don't want to talk too much about sport casting and ruin the main bit, but John Madden, for whatever else you want to see, there's a lot of things to say about him.

122
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,890
Scott: He was a very interesting character.

123
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:29,007
Scott: He had a lot of good and bad things going on in his life, but as far as his job of sport casting, he was basically legendary and revolutionary in that he did something that most sport casters even today don't do and before him didn't do very much either in that he was extremely knowledgeable about football, having been a football coach, right?

124
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:36,490
Scott: And so he knew everything that was going on, especially since the game was simpler then, right?

125
00:09:37,032 --> 00:09:45,169
Scott: But it was still more complex and if you watched football and you weren't a football coach or player, you didn't know what the hell was going on, right?

126
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:54,138
Scott: And he didn't necessarily try to speak simply and try to dumb things down for the audience.

127
00:09:57,152 --> 00:10:00,150
Rym: He kind of explained what the hell was going on in a way I could understand.

128
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:13,295
Scott: Right, but he wasn't thinking like, "Ah, people at home don't know what the hell's going on, so I can't talk in a complicated and use big fancy football words that they won't

129
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:13,921
Scott: understand.".

130
00:10:15,212 --> 00:10:26,090
Scott: But rather than just lower the level of discourse, he actively attempted to elevate the viewer and teach you football, right?

131
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:33,550
Scott: He was the first one to use the telestrator, maybe period, but definitely the first one to use it a lot to draw on the screen.

132
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,339
Scott: Oh, he basically made the telestrator a thing.

133
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:45,130
Rym: I don't know if any sportscaster had used the telestrator in any significant degree before Madden started using it.

134
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:51,350
Scott: Well, it wasn't really useful for anything other than football, maybe hockey or soccer.

135
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:55,070
Scott: Something where it's not on a big field is not useful, right?

136
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:56,770
Scott: But what are you going to telestrate in baseball?

137
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,790
Scott: First or second?

138
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,087
Rym: Just keep circling the picture like, "This guy's going to throw the

139
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:01,449
Rym: ball.".

140
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:02,197
Scott: Tennis!

141
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:03,269
Scott: He hit the ball that way.

142
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:05,190
Scott: What are you going to draw on tennis?

143
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:11,581
Rym: In a replay on tennis, you could show, "Look, this person is running in this direction at this critical moment, and you see the...".

144
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:14,269
Scott: There are other visualizations that are better.

145
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,709
Scott: But regardless, John Madden did that.

146
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:24,170
Scott: He tried to elevate the audience's football knowledge actively, which is not done... I think Tony Romo is coming a little bit close.

147
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:27,383
Scott: The other thing that he did, which is something

148
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:28,267
Rym: that

149
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:40,420
Scott: you see from a lot of local radio broadcasters and like one team, like home broadcast teams, broadcasters, but you don't see this very

150
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:40,842
Rym: often at

151
00:11:41,184 --> 00:12:02,370
Scott: all from national broadcasts, like almost ever, which is why people tend to love their local broadcasts and hate the national ones, is because even though he was neutral, he wasn't necessarily being a homer for one team or the other, even if the game was like a fucking blowout, John Madden just fucking loved football.

152
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,430
Scott: So he was excited.

153
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:12,472
Scott: He would nerd out about some football thing that someone did in the fourth quarter when they were losing by 20.

154
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:16,290
Scott: And he would be excited about football all the time.

155
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,230
Scott: He'd be like, "Oh, check out what they did on this play.

156
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,261
Scott: Oh, yeah, look at this.

157
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:19,747
Scott: Exciting.".

158
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:34,250
Scott: And that is sort of a contagious enthusiasm that you get from broadcasters who are also fans, but you don't get... If you watch NBC Sunday Night Football today, I don't know who's still doing those games.

159
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,589
Scott: I haven't watched them in a few years.

160
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,350
Scott: Collinsworth and whatever his name is, I forget.

161
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,130
Scott: It's like those guys were not excited about football.

162
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:43,419
Scott: It was a blowout.

163
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:43,963
Scott: They were like...

164
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,650
Rym: That's where his magic was.

165
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,550
Rym: It's not necessarily the specific things he did.

166
00:12:49,731 --> 00:13:00,870
Rym: It's that his goal in doing all those things was not even necessarily directly to educate the viewer, because you could have a really educational, really terrible sportscast of a football game.

167
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:08,390
Rym: It's that his goal was to increase the capacity of the audience to enjoy whatever was happening in football.

168
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,130
Scott: Right, but also to make his own enjoyment of football to pass it on to you.

169
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,746
Scott: He's like, "I fucking love football, and I'm going to make you love football,

170
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:16,948
Scott: too.".

171
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:19,016
Scott: And that's really the GeekNights' thing.

172
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:36,245
Scott: Even if there is some nerdery that I don't give a fucking shit about, look at how many things of the day, how many newses are just like, "Here's a YouTube channel with somebody who's fucking incredible at this thing I don't give a shit

173
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:36,487
Scott: about.".

174
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:38,330
Scott: A lock-picking lawyer comes to mind.

175
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,243
Scott: "I'm never going to pick a lock in my goddamn

176
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:40,505
Scott: life.".

177
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:51,109
Scott: The dude is enthusiastic about lock-picking and educational, and so it's like I'm watching his videos and enjoying them, even though I'm never going to do that hobby in my whole life ever.

178
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:57,109
Scott: Maybe when I'm an old man, if I really finish every other hobby, I build every Gundam or something.

179
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,790
Rym: Including playing Pendragon.

180
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,210
Scott: Yeah, and playing every TTRPG, then I'll try to pick a lock or something, right?

181
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,189
Scott: But that's the John Madden thing.

182
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:15,729
Rym: John Madden, the first honorary GeekNights, spreading the joy of your hobby and nerding out about it and giving zero fucks about the people who didn't understand you.

183
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,470
Rym: Granted, he did a good job, and there's a reason he's a legend.

184
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,850
Rym: He appealed to such a wide audience.

185
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,770
Scott: Whatever other weird things there are to say about John Madden.

186
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,928
Scott: You know, he's always riding on a bus to go everywhere.

187
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,007
Scott: I can at least say this.

188
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:38,269
Rym: He is the rare person who is a public figure, lived a long time, and does not have a "controversies" main title on his Wikipedia page.

189
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:43,809
Rym: Not that he was uncontroversial, but he does not have a whole section dedicated to that.

190
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:49,550
Scott: I'll just end this news on one funny John Madden story that I happen to know.

191
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,969
Scott: I'm sure there are many, right?

192
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:56,149
Scott: As everyone knows, John Madden was afraid of flying, or he just used a bus to go everywhere.

193
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:59,450
Rym: There is an entire section on his Wikipedia about his aversion to flying.

194
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,070
Rym: It's long.

195
00:15:00,573 --> 00:15:03,909
Scott: Yes, he used a bus to go everywhere, because he had to go to football games all over the country.

196
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:05,089
Scott: He had his own coach bus.

197
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:05,950
Scott: It took him everywhere.

198
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,129
Rym: There was a rule.

199
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:08,948
Scott: No shitting on the bus.

200
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,928
Rym: Oh, that's a rule in hockey, too.

201
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:11,617
Scott: Right.

202
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:16,830
Scott: He didn't like it if someone took, even though he had a toilet on the bus, he didn't like it if someone took a shit in there, right?

203
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:25,850
Scott: I think there was a time where someone did shit in there, and actually he got extra mad, because they were like close to a hotel.

204
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:27,989
Scott: They could have held it, and they went in there anyway.

205
00:15:29,851 --> 00:15:37,287
Scott: And the story is that he made a comment, something like, "I had to carry your shit all over two states," or whatever, something like that.

206
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:45,730
Scott: But the interesting story is someone was permitted to take a shit on the bus.

207
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:50,090
Scott: Do you know who took a shit on John Madden's bus with permission?

208
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:52,809
Rym: Ooh, that's a hard one.

209
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:57,030
Rym: The easy answer would be the bus driver, but I feel like that's too easy.

210
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,190
Rym: I don't know the story, actually.

211
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:05,329
Scott: There was one person specifically who was allowed to take a shit on John Madden's bus, and that person was Wayne Gretzky.

212
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,669
Rym: All right.

213
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,569
Rym: I would let Wayne Gretzky shit on a bus I was on, too.

214
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:10,728
Scott: I'm just saying.

215
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:13,170
Scott: That's real interesting.

216
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,630
Rym: That is real interesting.

217
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,110
Rym: So speaking of other sports news, it's a sports news day.

218
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:24,170
Rym: The Athletic is basically the best sports journalism out there in the English language.

219
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:40,790
Scott: So if you don't know the deal with The Athletic, because if you're not a sports nerd, you won't know what the hell that is, some years ago, somebody used the Silicon Valley business model, the same business model, the evil one, the exploitative one that Amazon and Uber use.

220
00:16:41,112 --> 00:16:54,530
Scott: They got a bunch of VC investment money, and they went and spent all of it to basically hire all the best sports journalists away from all the newspapers and consolidate them into one journalistic outfit.

221
00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:01,070
Scott: And they write really the highest quality sports journalism that there is.

222
00:17:01,531 --> 00:17:17,010
Scott: And they're covering every team and every sport and most teams in most sports in most places, obscure stuff, giving you lots of detailed coverage, way better than you're going to get in a regular newspaper, because regular newspaper is just giving you the big stories.

223
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:22,230
Scott: There was a trade, there was a game, there was a big rumor, big drama happened.

224
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:27,026
Scott: The Athletic is like, "Hey, here's some analysis.

225
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:27,990
Scott: We're going to break down.

226
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,859
Scott: Here's all the analytics.

227
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:30,000
Scott: Which

228
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:30,261
Scott: one?".

229
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:39,289
Rym: Let's look at these five lines across these four hockey teams and do a big analysis infographic thing.

230
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:45,490
Scott: Even stuff that would never be too insider stuff for Sports Illustrated.

231
00:17:46,752 --> 00:17:53,770
Scott: They're giving you even more in-depth stuff, because now these sports journalists have nothing to do but write articles constantly.

232
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:56,989
Scott: So they're just constantly researching, putting stuff out.

233
00:17:57,391 --> 00:18:07,110
Scott: So if you are someone who's interested in even just a small area of sport, it suddenly actually becomes worth it to you to buy a subscription to The Athletic.

234
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,789
Scott: It's so inexpensive relative to what you get.

235
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:14,949
Scott: And you get access to the best sports journalism in the world for every sport in every place.

236
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:19,450
Rym: Now, of course, the problem with this is that they're not profitable.

237
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,550
Scott: You can't make money with quality.

238
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,330
Scott: No, they've never been profitable.

239
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,230
Scott: They spend so much money hiring all the sports journalists.

240
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:30,430
Scott: And then they only get money from these heavily discounted subscriptions, and they don't run ads, which is nice.

241
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,849
Scott: These are not ads that I can see.

242
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,749
Rym: I've been a professional product manager for over a decade, and guess what?

243
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,546
Rym: Quality does not make money anywhere on earth.

244
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:43,110
Scott: They've also got to pay all the tech people to keep the site up, and they've got to pay how many podcasts they're making.

245
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,437
Scott: They're paying audio engineers.

246
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:46,430
Scott: They've got so many people they're paying.

247
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:50,530
Scott: Labor has to be pretty much their biggest cost.

248
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:55,705
Rym: So the news is The New York Times is buying them for the paltry sum of $550 million.

249
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,990
Scott: Right, now usually you see your Silicon Valley places go for billions.

250
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:07,630
Scott: $550 billion isn't paltry relative to money, but relative to basically the best sports.

251
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:08,899
Rym: A journalistic M&A.

252
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,230
Rym: That's a small amount of money.

253
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,091
Scott: It's like.

254
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:17,729
Scott: usually you see other tech companies of the same business model going for way more, especially when they're this successful.

255
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:20,008
Scott: So it's like, all right.

256
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,570
Scott: It's like, well, what's The New York Times going to do?

257
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:31,630
Scott: Because The New York Times isn't going to run it on the Silicon Valley business model of get investors, try to get a monopoly by taking losses, right?

258
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:35,930
Scott: And then profit on item three after some question marks.

259
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:38,569
Scott: So what the hell is The New York Times going to do?

260
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:40,698
Scott: Are they going to merge it?

261
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,250
Scott: Are they going to make cuts until it's profitable?

262
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,070
Scott: Are they going to raise the subscription?

263
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,456
Scott: There's a few ways they could go.

264
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:48,183
Rym: professional, like.

265
00:19:48,203 --> 00:20:09,730
Rym: in my professional opinion, the ways a company like this could go would be the best possible course would be to try to make it profitable, not by reducing its quality and cost, but by leveraging its quality to cross promote and cross monetize with all the other New York Times properties, integrate it more fully with The New York Times and use it to drive New York Times subscriptions.

266
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:13,150
Scott: I mean, if you think about it, I'm paying for the athletic.

267
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:18,110
Scott: If you, you know, you can basically, it's like what I pay for The New York Times?

268
00:20:18,612 --> 00:20:19,662
Scott: No, it's not worth it.

269
00:20:20,893 --> 00:20:21,741
Rym: I pay for WAPO.

270
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:22,670
Rym: Well, Washington Post.

271
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,750
Scott: I don't pay for either one.

272
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,430
Rym: WAPO is the best journalism I can pay for, honestly.

273
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:37,849
Scott: If you increased the price a very small amount and that included New York Times plus Crossword Puzzles plus athletic, then it suddenly sort of becomes worth it.

274
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:38,468
Rym: Oh yeah.

275
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:42,689
Scott: You could squeeze out a few dollars from the extra, but not that many more dollars.

276
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,041
Scott: Yeah.

277
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:43,687
Scott: Right.

278
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:54,329
Rym: So I have to imagine they're going to try something like that because the Silicon Valley way of water it down, make it profitable, fully integrated, and then eventually destroy it.

279
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,928
Rym: There's no reason to buy a company like this.

280
00:20:58,051 --> 00:21:05,070
Rym: And I don't think the athletic competes with The New York Times because like the athletic is for sports nerds.

281
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:06,747
Scott: The New York Times.

282
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,930
Scott: New York Times is not known for its sports section.

283
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:09,959
Rym: Yeah.

284
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:13,930
Rym: Now, we'll see how this goes.

285
00:21:14,911 --> 00:21:33,488
Rym: If I can get access to the athletic via a New York Times subscription in the future, I'll probably just pay for a New York Times subscription because then I also won't have to hit escape at the right moment between when I click on a New York Times link and the page pops up and then the monetization anti-ad blocker thing pops

286
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:33,629
Scott: up.

287
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:39,950
Scott: You should be introduced to this Firefox extension called No More Paywall, whatever it's called.

288
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,130
Rym: I click on New York Times links so rarely because I pay for Waypo and Waypo is fantastic.

289
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:46,549
Scott: Right, but this gets rid of all paywalls.

290
00:21:48,716 --> 00:21:49,087
Scott: All of them.

291
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:56,209
Rym: And anyway, some other news that leads even more closely into our main bit today.

292
00:21:57,512 --> 00:21:59,850
Rym: Wizards, this is basketball now, broadcaster.

293
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,609
Scott: Washington Wizards.

294
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,501
Rym: Said something that is highly plausible and likely.

295
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,909
Rym: This was an honest mistake.

296
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:30,929
Rym: But it so happens that what he said on the broadcast because two different people shared the same name and one of those people had a father who was involved in multiple gun-related incidents used the word, basically used the word trigger as part of a commentary in a game.

297
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,395
Rym: Quote, Kevin Porter

298
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:32,716
Rym: Jr.,

299
00:22:32,997 --> 00:22:39,010
Rym: like his dad, pulled that trigger right at the right time when Kevin Porter basically made a buzzer beater.

300
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:39,730
Rym: And it was amazing.

301
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,370
Scott: Right, because there was a different Kevin Porter who was a basketball player.

302
00:22:44,752 --> 00:22:54,628
Scott: And the commentator said, and if you believe, you know, good faith, whatever, that they thought that the other basketball player, Kevin Porter, was this Kevin Porter

303
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:55,009
Scott: Jr.'

304
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:56,308
Scott: 's father, which is not the case.

305
00:22:57,471 --> 00:23:07,710
Scott: Kevin Porter, who scored this buzzer beater, their father was a Kevin Porter who had gun-related incidents and he just used the unfortunate wording of pulled the trigger.

306
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:17,548
Scott: If he'd used any other wording, it would have also been weird because it would have been like his father, you know, because he saw the father part in there.

307
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:23,190
Rym: But even weirder as a coincidence, the other Kevin Porter, the one who's not...

308
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,481
Scott: He was like, like his dad, you know, was clutch, right?

309
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:29,130
Scott: It didn't use the trigger wording.

310
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,310
Scott: It's like, what do you mean, his dad was clutch?

311
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:33,281
Rym: It was clearly a mistake.

312
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:43,930
Rym: But just to point out, that other Kevin Porter played the NBA in the 70s and 80s, so the timing was plausible, and he was drafted by the Baltimore Bullets.

313
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:48,150
Scott: Yeah, the Washington Wizards used to be the Washington Bullets.

314
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,410
Rym: And previously before that, the Baltimore Bullets.

315
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,023
Rym: Yep, that's correct.

316
00:23:53,713 --> 00:23:57,250
Scott: And this is not the first gun-related incident on that team.

317
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:02,497
Scott: There was the infamous Gilbert Arenas gun in the locker room incident on the Washington Wizards, like in late 2000s, I think.

318
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,970
Rym: And you might think, if no one was shot, how bad was a gun in the locker room?

319
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,017
Rym: Read this story.

320
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:08,963
Rym: This is a weird gun.

321
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,408
Scott: If you don't know about the Gilbert Arenas gun in the locker room story, it's a famous one.

322
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,365
Rym: It is not just, "Oops, I had my gun with me.

323
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:16,989
Rym: Sorry about

324
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:17,210
Rym: that.".

325
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,408
Rym: It is way worse than that.

326
00:24:19,031 --> 00:24:26,270
Scott: Why is it that the team that used to be called the Bullets has now had two gun-related incidents since changing its name to the Wizards?

327
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:28,370
Scott: I hope it's the last one.

328
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,449
Rym: Nominative determinism, I'm telling you.

329
00:24:34,610 --> 00:25:10,270
Rym: But the reason we bring this news up, and we're not going to talk about it too deeply because it'll be covered in the main bit, is that sports commentating is an extremely difficult job, and there is an army of people behind the people who do professional, national-level sports commentary to ensure that the facts they say about the game, about other players, are correct, and mistakes, even relatively minor and excusable or understandable ones, get immediate, massive attention, even if they're not as extra as this one.

330
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:15,470
Rym: Saying the wrong thing as a sports commentator will be in the news for weeks afterward, in many cases.

331
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,027
Scott: Depends.

332
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,458
Rym: Yeah, it depends on the title.

333
00:25:18,761 --> 00:25:19,809
Rym: It'll be in the local news.

334
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,469
Scott: Nowadays, it'll be in the news for a day.

335
00:25:22,252 --> 00:25:25,770
Rym: Yeah, the local news, like the local team stuff, like in New York.

336
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:31,009
Rym: Like if Sam Rosen said it's really fucked up, we'd be talking about it for a few weeks at least, but off and on.

337
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:33,369
Rym: Depends on the level of the fuck up.

338
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:35,936
Rym: But, uh, think about that.

339
00:25:36,477 --> 00:25:52,990
Rym: Someone played the same sport, had the same name, in the same time frame, and possibly even someone was like gathering stats, or maybe you're sitting there with all the screens with stats, and you eyeball it and don't double-check enough, you can easily just make a mistake like that.

340
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,960
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

341
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,734
Rym: So, as you all know, I like mountain biking.

342
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:04,760
Rym: I used to mountain bike a lot.

343
00:26:05,282 --> 00:26:11,040
Rym: I rarely mountain bike anymore, and I've largely given it up, because as much as I, you know, I like skiing.

344
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,440
Rym: Scott makes fun of me for skiing, but skiing's really not dangerous.

345
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,409
Rym: Mountain biking, I like mountain biking.

346
00:26:16,631 --> 00:26:18,100
Rym: Mountain biking is dangerous as fuck.

347
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,499
Scott: Yeah, I don't do that.

348
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,279
Rym: There's a reason I don't mountain bike much anymore.

349
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:31,420
Scott: I mean, like, I would, you know, I'm not saying, like, I would ride a mountain bike on a mountain, but I would not do, like, the sort of downhill, narrow track going fast mountain biking.

350
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,620
Rym: Remember that one time in Poughkeepsie?

351
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,759
Scott: I would just bike up a mountain, like, weka, weka, weka.

352
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,939
Rym: Early in Poughkeepsie, you and I took our bikes on that mountain bike trail that one time in Red Oaks Mill together.

353
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:40,800
Scott: That was like trail ride.

354
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:42,411
Scott: Okay, I'll just bike in the woods.

355
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:43,538
Scott: Is there a hill in the woods?

356
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:43,820
Scott: Okay.

357
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,640
Scott: You know, off-road biking, it's like, okay.

358
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:51,020
Rym: And that's fun, and honestly, that's the kind of mountain biking I prefer to do over the crazy stuff as I get older.

359
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:58,600
Rym: But anyway, one of the, there's two big things you need to know before I explain this video about mountain biking.

360
00:26:58,881 --> 00:27:14,440
Rym: Is that one, if it's a serious mountain biking course, especially a technical one, a primary safety measure you're expected to take when you are doing that kind of mountain biking is to walk the trail once before you do it at speed.

361
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:23,080
Rym: Now, maybe you just walk it by riding slowly, but you do it real slow at least once to learn what's out there before you take it at speed.

362
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:30,280
Scott: Biking it slowly, you have to make sure that no one else is riding it quickly because they're narrow little tracks, right?

363
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,620
Scott: So if someone catches up to you when you're just sort of going real slow and careful, they'll just plow right into you.

364
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,860
Rym: Yeah, and there's all sorts of different trails and groups have different procedures, now they handle that.

365
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:43,980
Rym: But, you know, part of that is just know how the local trails are run and do what the locals do.

366
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,320
Rym: And don't do something weird and ask people what you should do if you're not sure.

367
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,280
Rym: You can apply that advice to almost anything in your life, to be honest.

368
00:27:53,023 --> 00:27:56,940
Rym: But two, mountain biking trails have to be designed well.

369
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:08,320
Rym: So this is a video where the people riding did not do the walkthrough, which like I have often even not done the walkthrough, like not everyone does it every time.

370
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:16,360
Rym: They're obviously professionals who know what they're doing and they're wearing a significant degree of armor, so they're definitely taking safety seriously to a degree.

371
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:21,874
Rym: The trail has, what I would say, an egregious flaw.

372
00:28:22,155 --> 00:28:23,840
Rym: Like, you want to talk about bad user experiences?

373
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:24,420
Scott: The worst possible.

374
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:33,200
Rym: So there is a segment after a high-speed downhill where there is clearly a technical jump, like there's a little wooden ramp that goes up in a jump.

375
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:43,520
Rym: So I as a mountain biker, who has mountain biked a lot and I'm honestly very good at it, when I watched this video, I was shocked by what happened over that trail or over that hill.

376
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:55,440
Scott: If you see a ramp that has a cutoff and is clearly a jump, you pick up speed and try to hit it and go straight, and then you trust that it was well designed that you're going to land on the other side, Evil Knievel style.

377
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:05,640
Rym: So you come up, so if you're watching this video, you come up over, you see the first person hits this jump and flies off like you'd expect them to with a very well executed jump.

378
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:21,840
Rym: The person behind them, wearing the GoPro, hits the same jump and it is immediately apparent that the first person is in deep shit and is falling off a cliff, the second person is now following them off the cliff, and like five mountain bikers follow all of them off the cliff, one after another, just one by one by one.

379
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,240
Scott: Thankfully it was not a very, you know, huge cliff.

380
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,287
Rym: Yeah, no one dies or gets seriously injured, but they do get hurt.

381
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,660
Rym: And they're mostly laughing and pissed on the ground afterward.

382
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:35,846
Rym: So you get to see what a mountain biking cliff bail looks like.

383
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:46,220
Rym: for one, and two, what's actually there over this ramp is an immediate hard left turn around back the way you came.

384
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,685
Scott: It's not a jump, it's a drop.

385
00:29:47,765 --> 00:29:52,120
Scott: I guess they were intending you to just not jump, but go down and to the left.

386
00:29:52,782 --> 00:29:52,922
Rym: Yep.

387
00:29:52,943 --> 00:29:56,194
Rym: So whoever designed this mountain biking trail, one, should be shot.

388
00:29:56,636 --> 00:29:56,836
Rym: Two...

389
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,159
Scott: Sued, sued for sure.

390
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:07,216
Rym: That is the kind of mountain bike trail that warrants multiple warning signs leading up to that feature if they insist on having that feature there.

391
00:30:07,577 --> 00:30:09,040
Rym: Granted, I would say it's unethical to even have that feature.

392
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,848
Scott: I don't even know.

393
00:30:09,868 --> 00:30:10,636
Scott: Put a net out there.

394
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:11,060
Scott: I don't know.

395
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,223
Rym: You can put a net.

396
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:14,169
Rym: I've bounced off of nets before.

397
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,280
Rym: That at least needs a net and a sign.

398
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,499
Scott: But you could just get rid of the jump, just make it a downhill slope.

399
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:24,660
Rym: Make it a bank turn around to the left like a normal mountain bike trail designer would do.

400
00:30:25,584 --> 00:30:25,880
Scott: I don't know.

401
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:27,437
Rym: So yeah, that's my thing of the day.

402
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:38,074
Scott: Uh, oh, so, uh, Reddit board games, the subreddit board games is a place that I, one of the few subreddits I still subscribe to.

403
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:40,297
Scott: However, I can't recommend it.

404
00:30:40,397 --> 00:30:43,580
Rym: Most of the comment content there- I do not subscribe to it anymore.

405
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:59,787
Scott: Most of the content there, the overwhelming majority of the content there is not, you know, even though it's about board games, it is about peop- I enjoy them and they enjoy the games in entirely different ways than I enjoy them.

406
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:07,360
Scott: Almost all the discussions are like about collecting, kickstarting, fancy miniatures, sleeving cards, right?

407
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:21,140
Scott: There's almost no talk about the actual rules of games, you know, how to win, strategies, uh, you know, even basic things that we talk about in our, in our panels and lectures and, and podcasts all the time.

408
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:27,388
Scott: Like any game with more than two players isn't a pure race, is a political game.

409
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:36,940
Scott: Like they don't, you know, basic facts like that are not established there, you know, so you get questions that just like fly in the face of, of fundamental truths.

410
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:43,031
Scott: And there's not a lot of good content there, but no, occasionally there is amazing content there.

411
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:47,540
Scott: And that happened, uh, you know, right on schedule, you know, once every couple of weeks or whatever.

412
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:58,309
Scott: Um, this person went and reboxed some of their games and specifically they reboxed some of their games that are just card games, right?

413
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:09,978
Scott: Cause you know, these days, and I guess it's been true for a long time, but if you make a card game and want to sell it in the game store, you can't just put a pack of cards and charge 20 bucks for it.

414
00:32:09,998 --> 00:32:11,820
Scott: Who's going to pay 20 bucks for a pack of cards?

415
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,543
Rym: I mean, PC games used to be this way.

416
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:22,479
Scott: Go, go find a photo of a PC gaming store from the era when that was, that was to get more shelf space so people would see your game.

417
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:22,700
Scott: Right.

418
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,911
Scott: But yeah, big cardboard box and inside the big cardboard box is a jewel case with a CD in it.

419
00:32:29,832 --> 00:32:33,860
Scott: Um, but anyway, so this person reboxed their card games.

420
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:43,711
Scott: Uh, now for reboxing card games, you know, you could get, you know, card boxes, like, you know, what bicycle decks come in, assuming the cards are the right size.

421
00:32:44,152 --> 00:32:46,975
Scott: Uh, that's not a bad option, but what do you do with the bicycle deck?

422
00:32:47,736 --> 00:32:49,979
Scott: Maybe someone out there sells empty card boxes.

423
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:50,960
Scott: That's not a bad idea.

424
00:32:51,501 --> 00:33:01,160
Rym: But then, you know, they're just going to be what white, I guess, or, and usually what people do is they get, they get big card boxes, like a magic type one, and they put a bunch of card games in the same box with dividers.

425
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,525
Scott: That's what I do, but that's not very portable.

426
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:08,115
Scott: because now it's like, you know, you want to, you go in there, you're going to get this big giant box, right?

427
00:33:08,135 --> 00:33:10,520
Scott: It's heavy, full of a zillion card games.

428
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:15,849
Scott: You know, you want to take one game out, you got to find where it starts and ends, little separators, right?

429
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:21,860
Scott: Um, and also let's say you've got, you know, a big board game that has a deck of cards in it.

430
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,131
Scott: Well, you know, something like, uh, you know, oath has a lot of cards, right?

431
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:29,440
Scott: I guess oath comes with ways to store the cards, but not every game does.

432
00:33:30,061 --> 00:33:37,088
Scott: So in those cases, you're using what rubber bands or you're getting the magic bondage, non-adhesive tape or something.

433
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:47,840
Scott: Um, this person, I guess, I don't know if they originated this idea, but they had the idea or got it from somewhere to use boxes from cassette tapes to put the cards in.

434
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,242
Scott: They're the exact right size.

435
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,045
Scott: As long as the deck isn't too big.

436
00:33:51,065 --> 00:33:54,210
Scott: Uh, if the cards are too big, okay, find another solution.

437
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,535
Scott: Uh, if you got too many cards, just get more cassette boxes.

438
00:33:57,555 --> 00:33:59,658
Scott: Um, they open nicely.

439
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:00,940
Scott: They protect the cards.

440
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,847
Scott: You don't have to worry about getting any tape or adhesive or any kind of rubber bands ruining your cards.

441
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:09,393
Scott: The cards are, you know, physically protected, right?

442
00:34:09,413 --> 00:34:11,295
Scott: They're not going to like bang and dent in there.

443
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:13,980
Scott: Uh, so I guess less reason to sleeve them.

444
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,724
Scott: Also, you know that if someone's doing this, they're not sleeving cause the sleeves wouldn't fit in there.

445
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:39,219
Scott: Uh, and lastly, because it's just a cassette case, you can easily with your printer at home, if you have one of those print out using like a template, a piece of paper and insert it in there to get the box art onto the plastic, you know, onto a cassette paper, whatever it's called, right?

446
00:34:39,821 --> 00:34:46,856
Rym: The only, the only danger to you is some games have cards that are too big to fit into a standard cassette case, but there are standard size.

447
00:34:46,897 --> 00:34:48,199
Scott: cards will fit in there perfectly.

448
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:55,771
Rym: But you can get other kinds of cases for older formats of cassettes and professional formats.

449
00:34:55,871 --> 00:35:01,060
Scott: Similarly, maybe you might be able to find one that matches up with the cards in a particular game.

450
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:15,900
Scott: But this makes me want to go and buy blank, you know, empty, just plastic cassette shells in bulk, and then find every game I've got that's got cards and do this to all of them to save space and also increase convenience.

451
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,827
Rym: I foresee one of the two of us buying like a bulk box of these and splitting them up.

452
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:21,948
Scott: Go buy like 50 of them.

453
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:22,709
Rym: I probably will.

454
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:29,780
Rym: I'm pretty into this cause I've been planning to rebox most of my games for some time, but mine won't look as nice as this person cause my printer isn't color.

455
00:35:29,941 --> 00:35:31,026
Rym: Oh, you want to use my printer?

456
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:33,960
Rym: I have an office full color laser printer.

457
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,640
Scott: Oh, you paid for the color printer.

458
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:37,660
Rym: I have a full on for real.

459
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,780
Scott: Honestly, when this printer dies, I'm not buying another printer ever.

460
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:44,330
Rym: I use this printer just enough to where.

461
00:35:44,651 --> 00:35:47,018
Rym: every time I use it, I think, God damn, I'm glad I own this thing.

462
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:49,399
Rym: Anyway.

463
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:56,518
Rym: Anyway, in the meta moment, the geek size book club book, which we're going to do an episode on probably in the first week of February is the tale of Genji.

464
00:35:56,598 --> 00:35:57,299
Rym: It's not just a novel.

465
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,634
Scott: I'm getting real close to finishing, like way close.

466
00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:00,399
Scott: I can see the end.

467
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,138
Rym: Yup, I think you sprinted past me.

468
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,837
Scott: I'm on chapter 40 something and there's only 50 something chapters, there's only like 54 chapters maybe.

469
00:36:07,857 --> 00:36:08,760
Scott: I got maybe less than 10 chapters to go.

470
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,459
Rym: You're like 8 chapters, 8 or 9 chapters past me, I think.

471
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:12,585
Scott: Oh, okay.

472
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:13,540
Scott: Well, you better catch up.

473
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,968
Rym: Yeah, but chapters aren't that long.

474
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:16,660
Rym: I read a chapter pretty quick, usually.

475
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:20,180
Scott: Some of those chapters like in the late 30s were like mega chapters.

476
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:21,561
Rym: Ah, yeah.

477
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:31,197
Rym: There were a few chapters I remember like when he's conspiring to actually, like early on, the longest chapter I bumped into is when his wife dies and all that nonsense happens.

478
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:33,020
Rym: and like that one was longer than others.

479
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,040
Scott: There were a couple of mega chapters in the 30s somewhere.

480
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,709
Rym: Yup, passing that Sakaki branch back and forth forever.

481
00:36:38,312 --> 00:36:40,380
Rym: Anyway, that was a while ago.

482
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:44,495
Rym: Anyway, it's not just a novel, it's the first novel.

483
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:45,560
Rym: We're gonna talk about it.

484
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,504
Scott: The first novel ever written by any human ever.

485
00:36:47,724 --> 00:36:50,751
Scott: There were clearly writings by humans before this, but they weren't novels.

486
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:55,200
Scott: They were poems or other forms of literature that were not novels.

487
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,940
Rym: Yup, and it's both a novel where I'm learning a lot about a culture I didn't actually know that much about.

488
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,340
Rym: I had bare superficial knowledge of Heian era.

489
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:14,359
Scott: When I came up with the idea to make this the book club book years ago, it was because I had A) heard about it a lot and then B) went to a museum exhibit about it and was like, "Oh, I should read

490
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:14,560
Scott: this.".

491
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:22,280
Rym: Someone in the forum I want to say, or maybe it was on Twitter way back, replied when we announced the book, I think it was on Twitter, and said something like, "What, the thing from Final Fantasy

492
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,360
Rym: VI?".

493
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:27,223
Rym: So, yeah.

494
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:29,969
Rym: Otherwise, we're not going to any cons anytime soon.

495
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:35,400
Rym: Our last panel from PAX Unplugged is on YouTubey as are tons of other panels.

496
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,292
Rym: And I'm working on a few panels that we might just do as panels for no con.

497
00:37:40,693 --> 00:37:41,675
Rym: Just do them on YouTube.

498
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,320
Rym: I feel like that'll be fun.

499
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,491
Scott: Tonight's website is coming along very well.

500
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:49,000
Scott: We are making a lot of significant progress.

501
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:58,356
Scott: So, basically what my plan is, is that I have a long list of features I want to get in there, but I'm not going to hold off on getting all of them.

502
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:13,540
Scott: As soon as I have every feature that the current website has, and all the URLs work, and all the data is in there, and we have the ability to upload a new episode, which I guess counts as features the current website has.

503
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:25,360
Scott: So, as soon as it achieves parity, I'll just switch it over, and then because I've set it up in such a nice way, I put all this effort into the auto-deployment stuff, I can just continue to add features.

504
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:31,091
Scott: Whereas adding features to the current website is very difficult, because the stack is so old.

505
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:35,820
Scott: Once we launch the new website, I can start doing all sorts of fancy things.

506
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:45,540
Rym: About once every six months, I'll try to upload the show, and it'll fuck up in a weird way, and then it's a pain in the ass to deal with today.

507
00:38:45,883 --> 00:38:47,718
Scott: So, it's going to be pretty nice.

508
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,828
Rym: Also, we can finally, you know what we've got to do?

509
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:52,634
Rym: We have to update the closer.

510
00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:54,340
Rym: We have to re-record the closer.

511
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:55,651
Scott: Maybe.

512
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,507
Rym: It still says, "Web designed by BrandoK," or, "Logos by BrandoK," "Web designed by Kat

513
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:01,647
Rym: Lee.".

514
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:04,511
Rym: It says a bunch of stuff that we've since changed.

515
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:06,093
Rym: We've got to update our accreditation.

516
00:39:06,574 --> 00:39:08,316
Rym: We've got to say some different things.

517
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:09,798
Rym: We'll do that at some point.

518
00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:11,080
Rym: We'll do that as part of the launch.

519
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:12,478
Scott: Sure.

520
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,534
Scott: I think that's the last thing in the old branding.

521
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,966
Rym: It's actually recorded.

522
00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:18,489
Rym: At night.

523
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,319
Rym: It's true.

524
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,161
Rym: Yeah, it is true.

525
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:35,660
Rym: Also, I'm excited that we'll finally get away from the blue, because at this point, everything looks as our new style, but then if we link to our website, I know people come here and are like, "What is this 2001-looking website that I'm

526
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:35,720
Rym: on?".

527
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:46,338
Scott: It's also going to be mobile-friendly, and more accessible, and load faster, and I'm going to make the search better, and all that stuff, so you'll actually be able to search properly.

528
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:47,720
Scott: That's going to be super nice.

529
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,482
Rym: It's pretty exciting.

530
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:53,841
Rym: I'm just glad we're still doing this since, you know, coming out 2022.

531
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:56,955
Scott: Well, this is hopefully going to be the last ever GeekNights website.

532
00:39:56,975 --> 00:39:57,960
Scott: I don't want to make it any more exciting.

533
00:39:58,303 --> 00:40:00,428
Rym: Until Web 4.0.

534
00:40:00,428 --> 00:40:00,639
Scott: Sure.

535
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:05,080
Rym: But right now, we're trying to revert back to Web 1.0, because Web 2.0 kind of sucks shit.

536
00:40:08,161 --> 00:40:09,746
Rym: I guess Web 3.0 is the real danger.

537
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:13,216
Rym: That's all NFTs, and there's only eight websites, but I digress.

538
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:14,399
Rym: Let's get into the main bit.

539
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:21,680
Rym: Sports commentators are honestly, like, it's funny, when we thought about doing this show, I was thinking back, like, preparing for this show.

540
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:32,520
Rym: And it's really fascinating to me that, without even thinking, like, just, if I think about sports commentators, my brain says, "Yeah, like Mickey

541
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:32,700
Rym: Redman.".

542
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:40,279
Rym: Because I grew up in Detroit, and Mickey Redman has been the color commentator for the Detroit Red Wings for my entire life.

543
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:51,640
Rym: Like, Mickey Redman is just an institution that will never go away, and I just looked up, he is still doing home games and even some away games to this day.

544
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,459
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's a job you can keep doing, and people at home want you to keep doing it.

545
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,628
Rym: Yeah, well, because he gets a comfortable patter, which means we got to step back and say, "What are we...".

546
00:41:11,823 --> 00:41:18,459
Scott: If you have a team that you're following, you hear this person, and suddenly there's a national game, and you hear this other voice, you're like, "Hey, you're upset,

547
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:18,620
Scott: right?".

548
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:25,839
Rym: What was the one NHL game, the Rangers game, where the in-stadium person was different one day, and everyone's like, "Whoa, that's

549
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:26,140
Rym: weird.".

550
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,442
Scott: Oh, the PA announcer, yeah.

551
00:41:28,004 --> 00:41:47,500
Scott: I mean, you know, my family constantly, my whole life, whenever, you know, any holiday gathering or any non-holiday gathering for watching sporting events or whatever, who was casting what was always, you know, a topic, who was on the radio, right, for the drive home, and you had opinions of, "That guy's good, that guy sucks," right?

552
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,959
Scott: It's like, we don't like that, "Ah, damn it, why's it gotta be this

553
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:50,080
Scott: guy?".

554
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,419
Rym: We got Sam Rosen, John Giannone, Joe Micheletti.

555
00:41:53,241 --> 00:42:05,339
Scott: Right, but it's like you watch, you know, some, even if you go into, you know, sports communities on the internet, you'll always see people be upset of like, "Oh, this announcer's on,

556
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:05,860
Scott: right?".

557
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,759
Scott: It's like a thing.

558
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,841
Rym: So why is that?

559
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:19,840
Rym: We gotta back up a little bit, 'cause sports commentary, like, what it came from, the reason it exists, is a big part of why it is the way it is today.

560
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:33,520
Scott: Well, I know a little bit about the history, so I believe that the first sports, like, live sportscasts ever, I think, I could be wrong about this, were boxing in the UK, like boxing matches.

561
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,080
Rym: I wanna say you're correct based on a cursory amount of research I did.

562
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:54,800
Scott: I'm pretty sure it was boxing matches in the UK somewhere that were on the radio, and then I think the first televised sports, if I'm not mistaken, were college, maybe college football in the US, I think?

563
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,644
Rym: But the first part you said is the more important part.

564
00:42:58,726 --> 00:43:07,079
Rym: It existed, it wasn't like we got sports on live TV or in arenas or stadiums and people said, "Oh, we need someone to explain what's going

565
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,240
Rym: on.".

566
00:43:08,681 --> 00:43:14,073
Rym: If you're somehow a nerd who's never been to a sports game, those people talking are not talking inside of the arena.

567
00:43:14,093 --> 00:43:16,679
Rym: Like, you can't hear them if you're just sitting in the bleachers of a baseball game.

568
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,648
Rym: But, I remember being surprised by that when I went to my first hockey game as a kid.

569
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:25,256
Rym: I was like, "Where's, what's going on?

570
00:43:25,276 --> 00:43:26,037
Rym: Where's Mickey Redman?

571
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:27,140
Rym: How do I know what's going

572
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,240
Rym: on?".

573
00:43:29,505 --> 00:43:34,500
Scott: Some people go to sporting events and bring a radio and wear headphones and hear the radio guy.

574
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,844
Scott: We did that at Tiger's Games.

575
00:43:36,024 --> 00:43:41,340
Rym: Every kid had a little headset and their little box score thing and were listening to the commentary in the bleacher seats.

576
00:43:42,461 --> 00:43:52,516
Scott: When I went to the US Open, even for the first time last year, you could buy a little radio thing, or I think there may be an app.

577
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:55,420
Scott: I think it was updated for the 20th century in some manner.

578
00:43:57,142 --> 00:44:05,138
Scott: Yeah, but you would be able to, you know, you could pay and get a thing at this booth and then be able to hear commentary, announcements, news of some kind.

579
00:44:05,158 --> 00:44:05,820
Scott: I didn't pay for it.

580
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:10,087
Rym: But, that's also why, like, hockey is the sport I like the most.

581
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:17,259
Rym: So, my whole life, I know all the ref's signals because in the arena, you'll know right away, "Oh, he got called for

582
00:44:17,299 --> 00:44:17,620
Rym: hooking.".

583
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,623
Rym: You don't have to wait for the ref to come and explain what happened.

584
00:44:20,043 --> 00:44:21,365
Rym: But, where did this all come from?

585
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:32,480
Rym: The reason it exists is because radio was the first, like, real way you could broadcast a sporting event other than tele-tape for, like, horse races prior.

586
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:36,083
Rym: So, as a result, radio was the way.

587
00:44:36,144 --> 00:44:52,759
Rym: You had to somehow come up with a way to convey to someone who can only hear sounds from you what is happening in a relatively complex sport in a way to where you understand it and appreciate it and are excited by it.

588
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:55,997
Scott: That's really fucking hard to do.

589
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,921
Scott: Right.

590
00:44:58,121 --> 00:45:04,527
Scott: There's this thing happening live in real time and you're watching it and you have to describe it, right?

591
00:45:04,727 --> 00:45:18,680
Scott: It's easy to make, like, a radio drama where you can write it and prepare and get sound effects, but it's like you're watching something live and you have to describe the events that are happening right before your eyes, right?

592
00:45:18,981 --> 00:45:28,880
Scott: In a correct way so that the listener can draw a picture of what is happening in their mind as if they were at the stadium, right, enjoying the event directly.

593
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:39,717
Rym: And to really underlie how hard this is, when I was a kid, I went to some Red Wings, like, pre-season event long ago because I really wanted autographs because I thought I could make money off of them.

594
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,220
Rym: That's all I cared about in that regard.

595
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,102
Rym: But also I wanted to meet the goalie and a couple other things, like, it was fun.

596
00:45:44,142 --> 00:46:08,780
Rym: But they had a fun little, like, exhibit set up where first they would play the audio commentary from, like, a historic Red Wings game and you were supposed to, like, take a quiz on what happened based on the commentary, like, not down, like, what happened, what happened, like, draw a little thing and, like, fill out this little worksheet and then they would show it to you and you could see how right or wrong you are.

597
00:46:09,221 --> 00:46:10,823
Rym: And I was pretty right.

598
00:46:10,884 --> 00:46:19,820
Rym: Like, I didn't, I got wrong, like, which side of the puck the ice was on, but I was never wrong about which zone it was in or who had it or, like, roughly what went down.

599
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,520
Scott: Yeah, the way you would know which side of the ice was on from radio only is, like...

600
00:46:23,621 --> 00:46:25,080
Rym: If you know, like, the left wing versus right wing...

601
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:30,733
Scott: If you know which player plays the left and they told you that that player was in deep, well, now you know they're in deep on the left.

602
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:34,020
Scott: But if you don't know that that player plays on the left, well, then it could be either side.

603
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:40,069
Rym: But if you listen to the radio, that's not as important as knowing, you know, the things I got perfectly accurately.

604
00:46:40,409 --> 00:46:42,352
Rym: Who's, like, on offense right now?

605
00:46:42,652 --> 00:46:43,474
Rym: Who's got the puck?

606
00:46:43,774 --> 00:46:44,815
Rym: Is there a shooting attempt?

607
00:46:45,116 --> 00:46:46,097
Rym: Like, what's going on?

608
00:46:46,338 --> 00:46:47,239
Rym: Like, are they in the zone?

609
00:46:47,259 --> 00:46:47,960
Rym: Like, that was important.

610
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,827
Rym: But then the second part of the exhibit was they would play a short clip and it was for kids.

611
00:46:53,107 --> 00:47:01,240
Rym: and there's a little microphone and there's an audience of people waiting in line watching you fuck this up and you had to do a live commentary of, like, a minute of hockey.

612
00:47:02,001 --> 00:47:08,488
Rym: And I failed utterly to convey basically anything.

613
00:47:08,848 --> 00:47:10,670
Rym: And I love this shit out of hockey.

614
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:13,213
Rym: I know the rules, like, to a weird degree even as a kid.

615
00:47:13,474 --> 00:47:19,340
Rym: And yet I could not for the life of me give meaningful commentary live on a hockey game I was watching.

616
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,902
Scott: No, you have to know all the players.

617
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:24,725
Scott: You have to go real fast, right?

618
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:32,213
Scott: You have to be able to, any action that someone takes, you need a very brief way to accurately describe what that action was.

619
00:47:33,094 --> 00:47:39,120
Scott: You need to have the right level of excitement, you know, that matches the flow of the game.

620
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:42,139
Scott: There's so much going on.

621
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:49,626
Rym: So this evolved as a profession and it's definitely a mix of science and art.

622
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,848
Rym: There's an art to it and a science to it.

623
00:47:52,128 --> 00:47:56,712
Rym: And as the science came in, you saw it sort of separate into different roles.

624
00:47:57,092 --> 00:48:06,800
Rym: Multiple commentators, armies of support staff providing information, screens and notes, telecastrators, not telecasters, telestrators, all these different things.

625
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:13,120
Rym: So, you know, you might hear of, there's the play-by-play commentator and the color commentator splitting up the roles.

626
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,980
Scott: The color commentary is much, you know, I don't want to like downplay the importance or skill of color commentators.

627
00:48:18,001 --> 00:48:18,680
Scott: It's way easier.

628
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:19,760
Scott: Right.

629
00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:24,089
Scott: They are extremely important, talented, knowledgeable, right?

630
00:48:24,169 --> 00:48:29,500
Scott: I can't do that job either, but it is an easier job than play-by-play commentary.

631
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,739
Rym: Basically give color like the play-by-play commentator says, I don't know.

632
00:48:37,741 --> 00:48:39,827
Scott: It's usually during breaks in the action, right?

633
00:48:39,847 --> 00:48:44,640
Scott: Because when this action, the play-by-play person has to describe everything that's happening.

634
00:48:45,181 --> 00:48:49,780
Scott: As soon as play stops, that person needs to catch your breath and you don't want dead air time.

635
00:48:50,181 --> 00:48:56,440
Scott: So the color commentator is basically someone for them to converse with, right, about what happened, like, ah, on that play.

636
00:48:56,662 --> 00:48:58,780
Scott: You know, let's say someone just gets a penalty, right.

637
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:07,480
Scott: You know, and it's like, ah, that was a real bad penalty to take because such, you know, you start, that's where you can fill in, you know, with your John Madden type.

638
00:49:07,701 --> 00:49:07,983
Scott: Right.

639
00:49:08,003 --> 00:49:10,379
Scott: You know, explain what just the hell just happened.

640
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:10,985
Scott: Right.

641
00:49:11,368 --> 00:49:12,479
Scott: Nothing's going on right now.

642
00:49:12,702 --> 00:49:13,011
Scott: Yeah.

643
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:13,279
Scott: Right.

644
00:49:13,942 --> 00:49:16,640
Scott: And then, you know, you do a little back and forth, whatnot.

645
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,600
Scott: And also the color commentator often is actually much more knowledgeable about the game.

646
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,021
Scott: Right.

647
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:32,220
Scott: The play-by-play person, you know, obviously still has to know a shit ton, but they don't have to know, like, you know, people's like stats and stuff.

648
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:32,800
Scott: Right.

649
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:41,640
Rym: But also they can focus kind of like how in hockey you have refs and linesmen because the linesmen are paying attention to one specific, very important thing.

650
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:49,599
Rym: Now, the play-by-play commentator can focus on that very important role and not have to worry about any of that other stuff, regardless of if they know it.

651
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:50,361
Scott: Yeah.

652
00:49:50,441 --> 00:49:57,400
Scott: And the, the color commentator also serves to look at the, what players are doing often like away from the action.

653
00:49:57,821 --> 00:49:58,622
Scott: Right.

654
00:49:58,642 --> 00:50:07,280
Scott: So, you know, it's like the, the play-by-play person has to really focus on like one part of the game where the most important thing is happening that the viewer needs to know about and hear.

655
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,420
Rym: Um, and the color commentator can look.

656
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,620
Rym: Panarin's got the Pockys in deep, uh, passing to, to Crider.

657
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,440
Scott: The color commentator can see and talk about things that are happening away from the play.

658
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:18,123
Scott: Right.

659
00:50:18,525 --> 00:50:20,293
Scott: Oh, did you see what's going on over on the bench?

660
00:50:20,353 --> 00:50:21,860
Scott: I noticed this other thing, right?

661
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:29,380
Scott: They give you this depth into specific areas rather than having to constantly pay attention to what's happening at this moment.

662
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,038
Scott: They could, right.

663
00:50:30,401 --> 00:50:32,820
Rym: And also the, the, the banter, the bouncing back and forth.

664
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,379
Scott: Another set of eyes on the field.

665
00:50:34,921 --> 00:50:37,680
Rym: That banter and back and forth part is extremely important too.

666
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:47,859
Rym: Much like, you know, Scott and I are doing this show way harder if it's just one of us doing a panel twice as hard to do a panel by myself, uh, than with, instead of having Scott with me to bounce off of.

667
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:50,767
Rym: And then there's a bunch of other roles.

668
00:50:50,787 --> 00:50:54,120
Rym: We're not going to like get, you can just read a Wikipedia article if you care about the details.

669
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,586
Scott: Just to go back to the history aspect.

670
00:50:55,646 --> 00:50:55,847
Scott: Right.

671
00:50:55,867 --> 00:50:58,700
Scott: So it definitely started with radio and then went to, right.

672
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:04,559
Scott: But when television came, it's like, you might think it's like, well, you're seeing the game now.

673
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:12,780
Rym: Well, so when television came, you remember we were watching, like I was watching hockey on a 13 inch black and white TV.

674
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:17,200
Rym: There's a reason the home jersey and the away jerseys were dark and light.

675
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,868
Rym: And they used to be flipped actually back then.

676
00:51:18,888 --> 00:51:21,179
Rym: And the refs were black and white because you couldn't see shit.

677
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:22,801
Scott: Exactly.

678
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:34,480
Scott: So they kept the commentators for television, you know, for a variety of reasons, just, I mean, like you don't even really need, you know, it's like, it wasn't some genius idea someone had.

679
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,124
Scott: It's just like this common sense thing.

680
00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:41,940
Scott: If you were, if you try muting a sporting event and watching it, it's kind of like eerie and weird.

681
00:51:42,381 --> 00:51:49,600
Scott: And even with an HDTV and amazing cameras, like you can't necessarily follow everything that's going on.

682
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:52,360
Rym: And especially you're not getting that color commentary.

683
00:51:53,461 --> 00:51:53,682
Scott: Right.

684
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:59,059
Scott: It's like, you know, you're not, you know, can you read the names of the players backs if you don't know them?

685
00:51:59,500 --> 00:51:59,821
Rym: Yeah.

686
00:52:00,122 --> 00:52:09,120
Rym: I mean, I know players, but even I'll like flub a number or forget, or can't quite seize the number because someone's standing in a weird way or like is under a pile of people like who got hit.

687
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,480
Rym: Can't quite tell color.

688
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:19,960
Scott: If you're watching a football game and it's like, you know, okay, so you could, you, if you turn on mute, it's like you see the ref through a yellow flag and you're not using closed captions either.

689
00:52:20,281 --> 00:52:21,605
Scott: So they throw the yellow flag.

690
00:52:21,645 --> 00:52:21,846
Scott: Okay.

691
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:22,929
Scott: There must've been a penalty.

692
00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:23,973
Scott: What penalty was it?

693
00:52:24,294 --> 00:52:24,454
Scott: Right.

694
00:52:24,494 --> 00:52:26,180
Scott: It's like, you couldn't really see all the action.

695
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:27,804
Scott: You got a TiVo, what are you going to do?

696
00:52:27,824 --> 00:52:28,747
Scott: Rewind and watch it.

697
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:31,535
Scott: It's like, you know, try to find the penalty yourself.

698
00:52:31,575 --> 00:52:32,999
Scott: The game is still going on meanwhile.

699
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:33,300
Scott: Right.

700
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,692
Scott: It's like, you know, but the person, the caster can be like, ah, that was a holding penalty.

701
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:38,233
Scott: Right.

702
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:40,720
Scott: I saw so-and-so do it because they're at the game.

703
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,361
Scott: They can see.

704
00:52:41,642 --> 00:52:52,160
Scott: if you're at the game, then you don't need the commentating as much, even though you could have it with the, like I said, with the radio, but if you're at the game, now you can see with enough resolution.

705
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,909
Scott: And you know, you get your PA announcer, you got your scoreboards, right?

706
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:59,374
Rym: Also, sometimes you get the players yelling at each other.

707
00:52:59,475 --> 00:53:01,940
Rym: I can look at the bench and see what's going on with the bench if I care.

708
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:12,120
Scott: But not only were the early televisions, like Rym said, so low graph, so weak graphically so that you still needed commentary to know what the hell was going on.

709
00:53:12,821 --> 00:53:20,392
Scott: But also it was a long time before they invented like those onscreen overlay things to show you the score.

710
00:53:20,412 --> 00:53:26,340
Rym: And even after they did invent, they did have the score pretty early, way earlier than you're applying.

711
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:42,480
Scott: No, but even when they had them, like, for example, I remember watching football in the eighties and it's like, yes, they had onscreen graphics, but those onscreen graphics, like during while play was happening was literally just the clock only.

712
00:53:42,902 --> 00:53:46,680
Scott: And the clock was actually another camera that was aimed at the clock.

713
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,005
Rym: I remember that era, right?

714
00:53:50,205 --> 00:54:00,420
Scott: And the scores would come up on the screen, like before and after commercial breaks, they didn't have the score pill, like always there all the time with updating graphics.

715
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:03,246
Scott: You know, you know, now they have so many more great.

716
00:54:03,266 --> 00:54:05,230
Scott: They invent, you know, they have a whole NFL games.

717
00:54:05,611 --> 00:54:08,938
Scott: They have a whole truck of people just for the yellow line.

718
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:09,800
Scott: That's the whole job.

719
00:54:10,461 --> 00:54:15,013
Scott: Several people just put in the yellow first down line on the screen for everybody.

720
00:54:15,033 --> 00:54:15,755
Scott: That's all they do.

721
00:54:16,136 --> 00:54:17,560
Scott: It takes like six people, humans.

722
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:29,400
Rym: But another thing this does, there's two things that this did in the end is the fact that this stayed with TV, like technology forced the commentary to be there, but then the commentary sort of grew into becoming an integral part of the game.

723
00:54:29,741 --> 00:54:39,860
Rym: So now we had basically accessibility by accident in that the TV broadcast is literally like accessible to a blind person because it's the same commentary you'd get on the radio.

724
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,348
Scott: It's not exactly the same as the radio.

725
00:54:42,448 --> 00:54:45,060
Scott: Radio commentary is different from TV commentary.

726
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,560
Rym: Nowadays it did diverge in that radio commentary is primarily just the play by play.

727
00:54:50,421 --> 00:54:50,602
Scott: Right.

728
00:54:50,802 --> 00:54:51,002
Scott: Right.

729
00:54:51,062 --> 00:54:53,847
Scott: Radio commentary doesn't usually have a color person.

730
00:54:53,927 --> 00:54:54,147
Scott: Yeah.

731
00:54:54,588 --> 00:54:57,253
Scott: Uh, also it's, you know, it's nonstop.

732
00:54:57,573 --> 00:55:01,279
Scott: It's much more descriptive because they know you can't see anything.

733
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:01,820
Scott: Right.

734
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,044
Scott: The TV commentary is a little bit more relaxed.

735
00:55:05,846 --> 00:55:15,780
Scott: Um, but, but it also knows some people, there are some people out there who still will like, you know, you watch the video and then turn on the radio.

736
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:21,514
Scott: And do you know, uh, use some sort of offset to make sure that they sync up because they won't sync up.

737
00:55:21,534 --> 00:55:23,700
Scott: The radio is always going to be ahead of the television.

738
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:32,632
Rym: But the other thing it did is the primary purpose of this today is to increase the enjoyment of the, of the people watching.

739
00:55:33,193 --> 00:55:38,240
Rym: that is, you know, the design of sports played professionally is that they're designed.

740
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:47,135
Scott: So the spectator will enjoy themselves and conveying to the spectator, all the information that is not communicated by some other means.

741
00:55:47,196 --> 00:55:49,740
Scott: I mean, if you ever watch the radio is all the information.

742
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,625
Scott: And in the case of TV is everything you can't see.

743
00:55:52,965 --> 00:56:01,700
Rym: If you don't believe this, go watch a sporting event that is not in a language you understand and listen to the commentary with like, close your eyes.

744
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,903
Rym: Just listen to the commentary.

745
00:56:03,544 --> 00:56:06,971
Rym: You can tell when they're about to score a goal, like.

746
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:11,240
Rym: you can feel the tension rising due to the skill of the commentators.

747
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:16,200
Scott: You might not know which team or you might not know exactly what's happening because you don't understand the language.

748
00:56:19,921 --> 00:56:28,920
Scott: And I guess, you know, you could, I guess, like, you, you know, even if you wanted to replay, if you want it to only have that audio for the feeling part and not for the information part.

749
00:56:29,421 --> 00:56:33,489
Scott: So you put a bunch of cameras in the crowd, uh, mics in the crowd for that purpose.

750
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:38,840
Scott: It's like, well, first of all, you know, eh, you got to know which crowd is home and away.

751
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:39,761
Scott: Right.

752
00:56:40,062 --> 00:56:45,490
Scott: And also, you know, some nights it's like, you know, the crowd isn't there or the crowd isn't into it.

753
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:52,140
Rym: during the last court, the previous lockdowns where the NHL was playing in empty arenas before they piped in fake crowd noise.

754
00:56:52,881 --> 00:56:55,127
Rym: One, the players were unnerved by how quiet it was.

755
00:56:55,427 --> 00:56:57,252
Rym: And two, watching it at home.

756
00:56:57,773 --> 00:57:00,420
Rym: It was weird, like super weird.

757
00:57:01,661 --> 00:57:03,125
Scott: And it could be, you know, it's, it's hard.

758
00:57:03,225 --> 00:57:09,020
Scott: It, I guess it might be impossible to say for sure that it's weird because we've only, we've, you know, not experienced that.

759
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:20,660
Rym: I think it's partly because sports, spectating sports is prime is more, I think more people enjoy it for the communal aspect than watching sports by themselves solely and specifically because they care about the sport.

760
00:57:21,001 --> 00:57:21,161
Scott: Right.

761
00:57:21,241 --> 00:57:28,914
Scott: But I would say that I have an one, one piece of evidence to submit suggesting that, no, it's not because we're used to it.

762
00:57:29,054 --> 00:57:30,136
Scott: And that's why it's weird.

763
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:32,240
Scott: Is that laugh tracks, right?

764
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:33,301
Scott: Laugh tracks.

765
00:57:33,401 --> 00:57:36,106
Scott: I got used to, and now they're weird.

766
00:57:36,346 --> 00:57:36,586
Scott: Right.

767
00:57:36,647 --> 00:57:37,608
Scott: Because I noticed them.

768
00:57:38,129 --> 00:57:38,350
Scott: Right.

769
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:43,499
Scott: So, but this is the thing where it's like, I'm used to a commentator and crowd noise.

770
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,160
Scott: Right.

771
00:57:44,701 --> 00:57:46,224
Scott: And I'm still used to them.

772
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:46,905
Scott: Right.

773
00:57:47,526 --> 00:57:55,580
Scott: Even after I recognize their existence, where I recognize the existence of the laugh track and it's unnaturalness makes it now awful.

774
00:57:56,881 --> 00:57:58,846
Scott: But they also never became awful.

775
00:57:58,966 --> 00:58:05,400
Rym: Even though I recognize, I think of the crowd, like a Greek chorus, they are one of the commentators because you'll be watching a game.

776
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,360
Rym: Commentators are doing their thing back and forth and say, there's a bad call by a ref in the middle of play.

777
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:13,106
Rym: You'll hear the crowd reacting to it.

778
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:19,098
Rym: You'll hear like this chorus of boos or like the disgruntled crowd getting less and less gruntled.

779
00:58:19,418 --> 00:58:20,180
Rym: Like that'll happen.

780
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:27,040
Rym: And then usually by that point, one of the commentators would be like, oh, the refs in the crowd are starting to respond to that hook.

781
00:58:28,301 --> 00:58:28,461
Scott: Yep.

782
00:58:29,123 --> 00:58:36,000
Scott: So yeah, I guess the, uh, the last thing is, you know, the, in, in this necessity for the sportscaster, right?

783
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:42,059
Scott: The sportscasting has like this next level to where it actually becomes an art and a part of the game itself.

784
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:42,260
Scott: Right.

785
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,268
Scott: You know, there's so many like famous calls, right?

786
00:58:46,328 --> 00:58:59,300
Scott: It's like when a big sporting thing happened, of course the thing that happened was a big deal, but it, the thing the sportscaster said when it happened also it becomes part of the event, right?

787
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:04,260
Scott: It's like, so Ali knocks out Frazier in its own as a legendary sporting event.

788
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:16,930
Rym: I can hear in my head, like to this day, the call when the red wings won the Stanley cup, when they got the goal, like the, just the words and like the way he said it and the crowd going nuts, like it becomes part of history.

789
00:59:17,632 --> 00:59:21,303
Scott: But, but Howard Cosell going down goes Frazier, right?

790
00:59:21,363 --> 00:59:23,530
Scott: It's like, that's like, that is right.

791
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:28,167
Scott: It's part of the, you know, it's inseparable from the thing that happened, right?

792
00:59:28,207 --> 00:59:28,829
Scott: The same thing.

793
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:29,250
Rym: Yep.

794
00:59:29,811 --> 00:59:47,950
Scott: So, uh, and you know, being able to say the legendary, you know, seeing a legendary thing happened before you and immediately saying a legendary description of it, that will remain, that will basically becomes a part of history with the thing that happened.

795
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:48,855
Rym: Case in point, case in point.

796
00:59:49,257 --> 00:59:50,081
Rym: Oh, the humanity.

797
00:59:50,122 --> 00:59:51,630
Rym: You all know exactly what I'm talking about.

798
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:52,171
Scott: Exactly.

799
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,672
Scott: Exactly.

800
00:59:52,752 --> 00:59:53,755
Scott: Oh, the humanity, right?

801
00:59:53,895 --> 00:59:59,910
Scott: A commentary of not a sport, but still, uh, you know, same deal.

802
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,717
Scott: So I have a lot of respect for sportscasting.

803
01:00:02,757 --> 01:00:03,479
Scott: It's real important.

804
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:13,230
Scott: Uh, you know, sports fans, especially people who are, you know, not just getting drunk, watching sports, but actually paying attention to the sports, uh, pay attention to it a lot.

805
01:00:14,151 --> 01:00:18,058
Scott: And you know, I think that in the nerd realms, right?

806
01:00:18,098 --> 01:00:24,530
Rym: Well, look at e-sports, a big part of the rise in e-sports was the professionalization of e-sports commentators.

807
01:00:24,991 --> 01:00:27,356
Rym: And they're, they're doing what we said they should do.

808
01:00:27,396 --> 01:00:33,590
Rym: They're all modeling themselves on traditional sports, but they're changing things where it makes sense.

809
01:00:33,991 --> 01:00:35,453
Rym: They're pushing the boundaries.

810
01:00:35,734 --> 01:00:43,830
Rym: And I think you're going to, you're starting to see sports commentators pulling in some of the techniques that the prominent e-sports people are doing again, where they make sense.

811
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:44,871
Scott: Yep.

812
01:00:45,632 --> 01:00:56,250
Scott: So, yeah, it's, you know, there's a lot of nerdy things, not just e-sports, but also like, you know, board games, especially with the ability to broadcast anything, even small time things, right?

813
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,956
Scott: You know, your local magic tournament is getting a broadcast.

814
01:00:59,397 --> 01:01:05,008
Scott: It's like, you know, so if you're broadcasted, uh, you know, we did, we, we started doing this kind of stuff with net runner.

815
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:05,890
Scott: We had commentaries.

816
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,092
Rym: How fun would that be?

817
01:01:07,172 --> 01:01:14,510
Rym: If I, I think we could both, honestly, we could learn to be very good tabletop game, play by play and color.

818
01:01:15,911 --> 01:01:16,092
Scott: Yeah.

819
01:01:16,133 --> 01:01:16,233
Scott: Right.

820
01:01:16,253 --> 01:01:19,150
Scott: You got, you know, this chess commentary going on nowadays, right?

821
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:20,809
Rym: There's always been chess commentary.

822
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:23,169
Scott: There has been, but now it's getting bigger.

823
01:01:23,431 --> 01:01:23,592
Scott: Yeah.

824
01:01:23,612 --> 01:01:27,510
Rym: Well, because all the, any, any sport that ends up on Twitch, you got to have commentary.

825
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:29,031
Scott: Obviously.

826
01:01:29,111 --> 01:01:36,910
Scott: So, uh, you know, it's a field that's, you know, still growing and it's going to be with us for a very long time.

827
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:37,734
Rym: And it's a career.

828
01:01:37,774 --> 01:01:41,190
Rym: Like this is something like you, if you're young, like you listen to GeekNights and you're in high school.

829
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:49,810
Rym: One of the things that I'm most mad about in my childhood is that nobody told me about all the jobs I could totally have tried to get sports commentator.

830
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:50,392
Scott: Oh, my friend.

831
01:01:50,694 --> 01:01:54,830
Scott: Oh, this was not one of the jobs actually that falls into that category.

832
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:58,726
Scott: I have friends who tried to become commentators and went to school for this.

833
01:01:58,766 --> 01:01:59,690
Scott: They didn't succeed.

834
01:02:00,131 --> 01:02:08,430
Scott: But you know, like I had a friend who was doing like a college hockey at the college down the street, but you can get degrees on the real radio, right?

835
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:09,031
Rym: Sports.

836
01:02:09,071 --> 01:02:12,644
Rym: Commentation is its own specific field of study.

837
01:02:12,864 --> 01:02:14,430
Rym: There's different majors, different aspects.

838
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:16,622
Rym: There's a lot of ways to approach it, but it's out there.

839
01:02:16,642 --> 01:02:17,608
Rym: You can go to school for it.

840
01:02:18,452 --> 01:02:18,613
Scott: Yeah.

841
01:02:19,456 --> 01:02:22,610
Rym: So and I think it's going to grow as a profession as these sports grows.

842
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:27,228
Scott: I think I get more things that need commentating than there are people with common skill.

843
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:29,576
Scott: You don't even have to commentating skill.

844
01:02:29,937 --> 01:02:33,470
Scott: The commentating skill is more important than the sports knowledge.

845
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:41,150
Scott: If you this is why you'll see people who are, you know, like who work for like, you know, a TV network.

846
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:43,056
Scott: And that same person will be.

847
01:02:43,237 --> 01:02:46,970
Scott: it's not that they obviously have to have a high level of knowledge to be able to do it in the first place.

848
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:53,130
Scott: But you'll see like the football commentator will also be commentating some baseball and some Olympics.

849
01:02:53,551 --> 01:02:57,970
Scott: And so it's like, but like they'll be commentating like some biathlons, like what the fuck do they know about that?

850
01:02:58,271 --> 01:03:10,570
Scott: Well, it's more important to have someone who knows how to commentate than it is to have someone who's expert on biathlon because you can pipe into their ear, biathlon info, and you can have some a color commentator who's next to them.

851
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:16,470
Rym: In fact, what you usually see the pattern I think is growing more and more is the play by play is a professional play by play person.

852
01:03:16,832 --> 01:03:20,630
Rym: And the color commentator is a former professional who played the thing.

853
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:21,695
Scott: Yeah.

854
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:22,050
Scott: Often.

855
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:22,611
Scott: Often.

856
01:03:22,972 --> 01:03:29,130
Rym: Or if it's not, it's either it's a former coach it's or it's someone who just has encyclopedic knowledge of that sport.

857
01:03:30,011 --> 01:03:30,171
Scott: Yep.

858
01:03:31,697 --> 01:03:32,941
Scott: So, yeah, I don't know.

859
01:03:32,961 --> 01:03:35,330
Scott: There's not much else to say other than pay attention.

860
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:43,270
Scott: If you watch sports and you aren't paying attention to and respecting the commentating or poor commentating based on who you got.

861
01:03:44,513 --> 01:03:45,098
Scott: Pay attention.

862
01:03:45,118 --> 01:03:46,730

01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:19,420

871
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:37,655
