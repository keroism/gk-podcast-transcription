1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,889
Rym: It's Tuesday, November 15th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:10,090
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,786
Scott:  And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,040
Rym:  And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,179
Rym: Tonight we are talking about comms in games.

6
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:20,479
Rym: Like voice chat and such.

7
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:23,558
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:34,800
Rym: So yeah, like, I predicted when, you know, the bad guy bought Twitter that it was going to be a faster decline than most people expected.

9
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:39,920
Rym: But not like an instant, like, straight down decline.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,260
Scott: I thought it would be instant.

11
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:51,160
Rym: I thought it would be like, cool people all leave, the platform is effectively dead, but like a lot of people still use it and it's kind of still going for a while until it eventually goes bankrupt or gets bought.

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,479
Scott: I mean, it is still going for a while.

13
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:59,280
Rym: It is for now, but I did not expect there to already be things that stopped working this quickly.

14
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:03,280
Scott: Man, you know what it takes to run one of these fucking things?

15
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,063
Rym: Oh, yeah, I do.

16
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:08,100
Rym: My literal job is like that scale of enterprise technology.

17
00:01:09,623 --> 00:01:25,680
Rym: And basically, for those of you who aren't a technologist, what my guess as to what happened here is that that dipshit laid off so many people that the company can't do what you may have heard this term, KTLO, or keep the lights on work.

18
00:01:26,322 --> 00:01:33,100
Rym: That is the work that engineers and support people do to keep things that you've already built as a company just running.

19
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:34,510
Rym: You're not doing anything new.

20
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:35,640
Rym: You're not making anything better.

21
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:39,600
Rym: You're just making sure that what you've already got continues to function.

22
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,840
Rym: And typically in a large company, that is the work that nobody wants to do.

23
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,865
Rym: It's not interesting.

24
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,760
Rym: It's often seen as a cost center.

25
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,519
Rym: People who are bad business people really like to cut that first, not understanding the consequences of it.

26
00:01:54,261 --> 00:02:00,299
Rym: And they basically, I think Twitter fired literally everyone who does the KTLO for the entire company.

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:16,019
Rym: So my advice to you then is if you rely on Twitter for anything important, like single sign on to some other service, get off of that real quick, because I don't know how long Twitter is going to even stay up at this point.

28
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,069
Rym: So yeah, we'll see how that goes.

29
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:22,200
Rym: It's a fascinating trash fire to watch.

30
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,230
Rym: I have 100% abandoned Twitter.

31
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:25,579
Rym: I'm not even looking at it anymore.

32
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,678
Scott: Let's, you know, things come and go.

33
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:32,915
Scott: So I've been through this episode on this already.

34
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:36,060
Rym: Yeah, I've been through this many times in my life.

35
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,380
Rym: So I haven't even looked at Twitter.

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,110
Scott: I'm not going to go through it again ever.

37
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:47,800
Scott: I'm going to set up something that is, you know, as long as HTTP is still a thing, that's the only thing I'm going to depend on still being the thing, right?

38
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,760
Scott: So I'll make some system whereby as long as there are web pages, I'm good with that system forever.

39
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:57,840
Scott: And if other thing platforms come and go, I'm still good.

40
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:58,202
Rym: Yep.

41
00:02:58,282 --> 00:03:01,620
Rym: That's why I got a domain just rimmed on social that I'll use for whatever.

42
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,439
Rym: And I threw up a lot of domains.

43
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,939
Rym: I threw up a crapo microblog that I'm just using to replace how I used to shitpost to Twitter and try to syndicate everywhere as a test.

44
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:13,440
Rym: I'm just going to go fast and loose and try all this, but so far it's working out.

45
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:24,819
Rym: I don't actually miss the kinds of replies I would get on Twitter as much as I expected, because all the people who are replying to my syndicated tweets, not that many of them are left.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,380
Rym: Most of the people who normally would reply to my tweets have also quit Twitter.

47
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,396
Rym: So I'm not missing anything.

48
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,719
Rym: Anyway, I had some good conversations in the replies and Twitter.

49
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:38,799
Rym: I guess you fixed your chair.

50
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:40,186
Scott: Yeah.

51
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:41,619
Scott: The replacement armrest came.

52
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,258
Scott: It doesn't go back and forth.

53
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:46,000
Scott: So I was like, well, you know what?

54
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Scott: The one on the left side of the chair is still working.

55
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,359
Scott: I'll just leave that one there.

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,940
Scott: I could replace them both, but like, eh, it doesn't matter if they don't match.

57
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,400
Rym: I thought, I guess that doesn't matter.

58
00:03:54,781 --> 00:04:00,700
Rym: But then as I said that, I unconsciously slid my right armrest.

59
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,939
Rym: I angled it out to the right a little bit, and then I angled my left one in a little bit.

60
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:07,600
Rym: And I realized I actually changed the angles on these pretty much constantly during the day.

61
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,800
Scott: The angle doesn't move that much.

62
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,559
Scott: It's a very small amount.

63
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,930
Rym: The Aeron-1 moves a lot more than this one does.

64
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:16,077
Rym: Okay.

65
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:22,960
Rym: I don't remember exactly how much yours moves, because the Aeron-1 will go like 30, 40 degrees in either direction.

66
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:25,679
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't move as much.

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,020
Scott: It does not, you know, but even so, it's like, even if I made both of them non-moving, it's like, eh, whatever.

68
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:32,551
Rym: Yeah.

69
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,100
Scott: I'll just have a backup arm, left armrest now in case the left one ever breaks.

70
00:04:38,182 --> 00:04:38,836
Rym: So you got any news?

71
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:40,779
Scott: Uh, yeah.

72
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:49,000
Scott: So there's this game that just came out of, you know, I don't know if it was announced a while ago and just nobody noticed, but as far as, you know, we're concerned, it came out of nowhere.

73
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:51,799
Scott: And it was released today.

74
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,003
Scott: Yeah.

75
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,158
Scott: This new pentamint game that came out that suddenly everyone sees and is like, holy shit, what is this?

76
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:05,239
Scott: It's a game where it's basically an adventure game, but there's a little bit of murder mystery going on.

77
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,460
Scott: There's a little bit of puzzle going on, right?

78
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,320
Scott: It's a little bit choose your own adventure, a little bit of visual novel going on.

79
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,259
Rym: So what's funny is my first instinct, because I'm about to geek by Disco Elysium now that I've played a bunch of it.

80
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:25,019
Rym: And, uh, I thought, wow, actually parts of this look a lot like Disco Elysium and people in the YouTube comments on this trailer all saying the same thing.

81
00:05:26,221 --> 00:05:33,680
Scott: But if you, the art style of the game looks like some sort of illustrated manuscript, right?

82
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,773
Scott: You know, tapestry kind of deal.

83
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,660
Rym: I really like the one day, eight hours remain like that, that time thing that that showed a few times the rondel.

84
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:45,038
Scott: Yep.

85
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:49,600
Scott: It could be some kind of, uh, you know, Majora's Mask deal.

86
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,678
Scott: I haven't played it, so I don't know.

87
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,740
Scott: But we looked at the trailer, the game came out.

88
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,259
Scott: Everyone is hype on this game.

89
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:58,120
Scott: So we're going to play it, play it soon.

90
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:00,820
Scott: Probably released today, literally today.

91
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,080
Scott: I might play it after dinner.

92
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,299
Rym: Single player game season for a little while, weirdly.

93
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:07,899
Rym: Now this looks good.

94
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,358
Rym: I'll play it too.

95
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,239
Rym: This will be an easy show.

96
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:12,999
Rym: Uh, I just got to finish my first run through of Disco Elysium.

97
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,460
Rym: first, because my news is a geek bite.

98
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,920
Rym: I am late to the party on this game.

99
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,421
Rym: It came out in 2019.

100
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:28,319
Rym: Pretty much from when this game came out, a lot of people I followed on social media, a lot of people I talked to, they just wouldn't shut up about it.

101
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:36,980
Rym: And then eventually it faded, not from public conversation, but from my social circles, because the people who were talking about it just talked about it amongst themselves.

102
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,180
Scott: But the one player game, people beat it.

103
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,199
Scott: They stopped talking about it.

104
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,720
Scott: But I knew, I knew like generally what it was.

105
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,600
Scott: It's some kind of detective-y deal, right?

106
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:54,680
Rym: So the reason I think why this still has a wide undercurrent of conversation is it's, there's a lot of shit posting and memes about this game.

107
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:55,719
Rym: Like you're seeing that.

108
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:59,520
Rym: And there's a lot of people who will play through it many, many times.

109
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,179
Rym: Like try to do weird stuff.

110
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:05,080
Rym: They're going to go off the grid, like in that game in Rick and Morty, Roy.

111
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:18,460
Rym: So I actually, despite all of that, all I knew about this game going into it, I'm trying to do this more as play games as blind as possible, just to see like, what's the game present to me on its own?

112
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:19,458
Rym: The author is dead.

113
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,480
Rym: Social media is dead.

114
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,160
Rym: The world is dead.

115
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,260
Rym: There's just me in this game.

116
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,079
Rym: So what I knew going in was Disco Elysium is some sort of adventure game.

117
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,300
Rym: You play a fucked up guy and everyone just would leave it at that.

118
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:35,519
Rym: You play a fucked up guy.

119
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,320
Rym: What do you mean by that?

120
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:36,798
Rym: Just play it.

121
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,237
Rym: You'll see.

122
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,300
Rym: And it's about communism.

123
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,797
Rym: That's all I knew going in.

124
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:55,800
Rym: Having played a bunch of it, I'm going to weirdly go out on a limb and say that this game is closer to Quest for Glory, the series, than most other games people would compare it to.

125
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,779
Rym: Weirdly specifically close to Quest for Glory.

126
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:01,540
Rym: I'll explain that in a minute.

127
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,980
Rym: What this game is, to actually answer your question, it is a single player.

128
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,120
Scott: I didn't ask any questions.

129
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:07,596
Rym: Yeah, single player adventure game.

130
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:10,939
Rym: Well, cause you don't play games mostly.

131
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:21,300
Rym: So you, you wake up as a dude, this fucked up guy from what appears to be a hangover in a fucked up hotel room that may or may not have been trashed by you.

132
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:23,780
Rym: The water's running, the sink's busted.

133
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:26,540
Rym: You're like passed out in a pile of detritus.

134
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,340
Rym: Your tie is like swinging from the ceiling fan.

135
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:32,080
Rym: There's a tapering, like a reel to reel recorder.

136
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:34,880
Rym: And someone has fucked it up and destroyed all the recordings.

137
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:36,740
Rym: And you don't know anything.

138
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,460
Rym: You don't know what, you don't know about the world.

139
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,940
Rym: You have complete and total amnesia.

140
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:53,040
Rym: And it is just a walk around point and click adventure game like Deja Vu, the classic NES game where you wake up with amnesia in a stall of a bathroom with a gun.

141
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:55,359
Scott: An old amnesia cliche.

142
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,060
Scott: People just, you know, get away from that one.

143
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:11,060
Rym: This game actually, the gameplay is fascinating because it has some of the most impressive quality of life enhancements to the classic adventure game genre that I've ever seen.

144
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:20,555
Rym: This type of gameplay makes adventure games eminently playable to a modern audience who have zero nostalgia for the old adventure games of the past.

145
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:21,419
Rym: in a really good way.

146
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,440
Rym: One, it's really open world in that you can kind of do anything.

147
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:29,240
Rym: So like you stumble out of your hotel room, maybe.

148
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,960
Rym: Maybe you die in your hotel room.

149
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,516
Rym: That can happen.

150
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:33,840
Rym: You stagger downstairs.

151
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,900
Rym: You're in this beat up looking like post-Soviet vaguely feeling hotel.

152
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:43,240
Rym: And this guy walks up to you and he's like, "Oh, I guess you're over your hangover, partner.

153
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,618
Rym: Shall we go investigate the murder that we are here to do because we are

154
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:47,980
Rym: cops?".

155
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,714
Rym: And you either just got to try to play along and not let on that.

156
00:09:51,754 --> 00:09:53,597
Rym: you literally don't even know who you are.

157
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:57,800
Rym: Or you can just admit to the guy like, "Oh, I have no idea what the fuck is going on.

158
00:09:58,003 --> 00:09:58,698
Rym: I have total amnesia.

159
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,329
Rym: Please help

160
00:09:59,370 --> 00:09:59,432
Rym: me.".

161
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:11,160
Rym: And the freedom the game gives you in terms of how you react to characters, what you say to them, how you approach puzzles is so wide that it is actually approaching open world.

162
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,919
Rym: This game could literally be you don't even bother with the murder and you go off trying to make communism happen.

163
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:21,860
Rym: This game could be you try to make a dance club and then you die in the dance club happy.

164
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,780
Rym: and that is the end of your arc because you have brought a brand new drug trade to town.

165
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,579
Rym: The game just goes off in all these crazy directions.

166
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,960
Rym: But the quality of life enhancements are one like quest for glory.

167
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,900
Rym: The game has decision trees where some things you say will permanently affect the game.

168
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,140
Rym: Some things you do or say will just provide information.

169
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:46,112
Rym: But sometimes there's a stat based block like it'll tell you straight up what the stakes are.

170
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:58,720
Rym: So say you happen to, I don't know, find a radio and call your precinct because you figured out what precinct you work for and you don't want them to know that you have amnesia and you don't want them to know that you lost your badge.

171
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:04,379
Rym: And in the course of that conversation, one of the other cops is like, "He fucked up and lost his badge.

172
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,879
Rym: Make him describe his gun.

173
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,435
Rym: For all we know, he lost his gun

174
00:11:07,496 --> 00:11:07,658
Rym: too.".

175
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:14,614
Rym: And your dialogue choice, classic Monkey Island style is either, "Wait, I had a gun" or "Oh shit, my

176
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:14,879
Rym: gun.".

177
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:18,940
Rym: And then you have options and one of the options requires a skill test.

178
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,200
Rym: Convince them you did not lose your gun.

179
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,300
Rym: The game tells you what the odds are of succeeding.

180
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,520
Rym: It tells you what you would have needed to do or would need to do to make the odds of passing that check better.

181
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,380
Rym: It even tells you, could you attempt this again in the future if you fail?

182
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,320
Rym: Or is this a line in the sand?

183
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,359
Rym: The story is going to be radically different whether or not you succeed or fail right now.

184
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:47,180
Rym: It tells you all of the stakes up front directly.

185
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,919
Scott: Is it one of those ones where you play, you die, and then you start over again until... Actually, no.

186
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:58,500
Rym: This game is more like you play, you fuck up, and those fuck-ups actually make the game more interesting.

187
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:00,520
Rym: Like being really good at the game.

188
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,760
Scott: You start up but it ends and then you start over?

189
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:06,360
Rym: No, you pretty much play the game all the way until you solve the story.

190
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,660
Rym: You're really only... You'll die occasionally sometimes because it's funny.

191
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,079
Scott: But some way you come back to life?

192
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:14,740
Rym: No, you just start over but you save your game so it doesn't matter.

193
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,900
Scott: Oh, save game and not from the beginning.

194
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,040
Rym: Yeah, you can just save your game.

195
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:22,420
Rym: You can make a million save files, try things, save scum if you want to.

196
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,420
Rym: The game does not care.

197
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,699
Rym: The game is not a die, you learn something.

198
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,436
Scott: All of the choices that don't have the warning of this is going to change.

199
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:30,878
Scott: the world.

200
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:38,405
Scott: warning are just sort of like flavor side quest things and the big choice things are the ones that are actually the.

201
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:41,897
Scott: choose your own adventure linchpin points that take you to the different endings.

202
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,340
Rym: That is the primary mechanism of the game.

203
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,640
Rym: I'm not sure if there are multiple endings.

204
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,739
Rym: I haven't even beaten the game yet.

205
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,377
Rym: There are multiple ends, but there is one overarching story.

206
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,220
Rym: that's happening.

207
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:57,320
Scott: Yeah, but there's always one ending that's like the big, the real one, right?

208
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,039
Scott: Every game does that.

209
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:16,374
Rym: But it's more about how does everyone in the world end up by the end and the decisions you make are very subtle sometimes because while big decisions that will affect big plot have this strict gatekeeping and it's very upfront about it, little minor things might matter too.

210
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,639
Rym: Like there's an example.

211
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:23,900
Rym: There's one character you're talking to and you're doing something for them, but they might be evil and working for the evil Megacorp.

212
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:34,140
Rym: So once you do something for them in the dialogue, you might reveal just in the course of the actual text of what you're saying to this person some information.

213
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:43,639
Rym: And if you happen to reveal that information to this character, they don't react to it to you, but they go off and do big stuff that will completely fuck up the world and completely change things.

214
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:46,800
Rym: And the only indication you would have is a secondary system.

215
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,280
Rym: The game has a help system built in, but the help system is part of the game.

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,880
Rym: When you start the game, you make a character just like in Quest for Glory.

217
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,157
Rym: You can put stats in.

218
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:58,203
Rym: You can put points in.

219
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:14,180
Rym: stats like effectively strength or endurance or shivers or imagination or conceptualization or basic logic or like there's a huge skill tree and those skills do a variety of things.

220
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,020
Rym: But the coolest thing they do is say you have a high stat and I don't know shivers.

221
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:31,480
Rym: When you're at a point in the game where a cop who has amnesia might like get a shiver or like get a bad feeling about something that would matter, the game will pop up and be like, "Ooh, you got a shiver.

222
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:35,959
Rym: If you tell this person this thing right now, bad things will

223
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,240
Rym: happen.".

224
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:39,598
Rym: Let's say you level up another stat unrelatedly.

225
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:51,780
Rym: That other stat might have a different voice in your own head, pop in and say, "Hey, if you tell this person this thing, here is exactly what they will do with this information because you have conceptualization.

226
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:59,032
Rym: You can, your character can understand the concept of like what could happen or what could be based on what I

227
00:14:59,093 --> 00:14:59,254
Rym: know.".

228
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,800
Rym: So by leveling up different stats, you get different kinds of hints and different kinds of direction in the game.

229
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:13,380
Rym: Sometimes those voices are bad and will lie to you and will tell you to do drugs and it's not a good idea usually, but sometimes it is a good idea to do drugs.

230
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:20,340
Rym: The game's so wide open and so high concept, it has a third primary set of mechanics.

231
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:27,657
Rym: Every now and then, based on things you learn in the game, your character unlocks a thought like, "What would communism be

232
00:15:27,737 --> 00:15:27,979
Rym: like?".

233
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:32,018
Rym: Or, "Maybe I should figure out like what to do about my

234
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:32,340
Rym: life.".

235
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,798
Rym: Or, "Jamrock, I should learn, I should think about what that town's

236
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:36,039
Rym: like.".

237
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:44,759
Rym: And you can equip thoughts to your character and they level up over the course of you playing the game and unlock further thoughts.

238
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:53,419
Rym: So your character might figure out an opinion on communism over the course of the game, which itself will also impact the story and your choices.

239
00:15:55,344 --> 00:15:56,640
Rym: So there's a lot going on here.

240
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:03,758
Rym: This is like the most fully evolved form of a traditional point and click murder mystery adventure game I have ever seen.

241
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:10,728
Scott: Yeah, the way you describe it, it just sounds like a choose your own adventure book, but there's actually one big one.

242
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:11,552
Rym: that's the main one.

243
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:20,839
Scott: And then lots and lots of small ones sort of layered on top of each other, like fattening it up a whole bunch.

244
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:30,080
Scott: And then a lot of the choices that you could choose, like you might get to the, if there was actually a book, you get to the bottom of a page, there might only be two choices.

245
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,477
Scott: But if you do other things, then like more choices magically appear, right?

246
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,440
Scott: And so it's, you know.

247
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,980
Rym: Yeah, but you also have stats and you can level.

248
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,700
Scott: Right, but the stats are fundamentally just a thing to click on that will end up adding more choices, right?

249
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,479
Rym: Not necessarily.

250
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:48,659
Rym: They do some other things too.

251
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,991
Rym: The game does a lot of things it's not going to tell you it'll do over the course of the game.

252
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,860
Rym: It'll often surprise you in interesting ways.

253
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:58,119
Rym: And you can also go anywhere and talk to anyone at any time.

254
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,509
Scott: Right, but those are just more.

255
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:04,359
Scott: choose your own adventure choices, but they're all layering on top of each other, right?

256
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,880
Scott: And unlocking in different ways with different systems to sort of become a whole greater than the sum of the parts.

257
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,578
Scott: And the end result.

258
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,819
Scott: If you literally just didn't have those systems and we're just like, here's every single.

259
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:23,319
Scott: choose your own adventure choice, just, you know, like all the time, like, you know, it wouldn't come across in the same way.

260
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,840
Rym: And I guess what really makes it shine is one, the writing is absolutely hilarious.

261
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:31,040
Rym: Like it is really well written.

262
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:32,700
Rym: It is really well voice acted.

263
00:17:33,062 --> 00:17:35,480
Rym: The story is actually really compelling.

264
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:46,080
Rym: But the things that really spoke to me playing it were that one, the characters all act very human and react to you in a very sensible way.

265
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:51,980
Rym: You could solve the mystery entirely on your own as a human playing this game and interacting with the characters.

266
00:17:52,340 --> 00:18:00,860
Rym: And the way people respond to you is very scarily realistic to the point that it feels more like an open world freeform role playing game.

267
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,518
Rym: Like it feels shockingly open just by the nature of how it's set up.

268
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,971
Rym: So I have a strong positive opinion.

269
00:18:11,152 --> 00:18:13,460
Rym: just so far, only two and a half days into this game.

270
00:18:14,722 --> 00:18:25,420
Rym: And I highly recommend everyone play it, partly because Elysium, Disco Elysium, the final cut, which include add some voice acting and some other stuff is on like super sale on Steam right now.

271
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,913
Rym: I paid 17 bucks for this $65 AAA game.

272
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,110
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

273
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:44,330
Rym: So this is an excerpt from the most recent PBS News Hour from last night.

274
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,530
Rym: And it is actually a really good segment that I think everyone should watch.

275
00:18:49,231 --> 00:19:00,490
Rym: It is a it's talking about the New Deal, the original, the FDR New Deal, the New Deal that probably saved America, the kind of thing America would need to do again to save itself.

276
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:09,370
Rym: But what it's covering is one, the fact that very few Americans realize how impactful the New Deal was like.

277
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,870
Rym: There's a lot of reasons why there's a lot of propaganda.

278
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,229
Rym: A lot of people don't talk about it.

279
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,350
Rym: A lot of this history is sort of obscured people.

280
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,828
Scott: You know, I only hear about it in school, at least.

281
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:25,539
Scott: I don't even know if people still hear about in school, but like, you know, I heard about it in school and it was it was.

282
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,409
Scott: it was like in one class they talked about it for like, you know, maybe one segment, like one test on it.

283
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:31,598
Scott: Right.

284
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:32,173
Scott: It's like.

285
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:34,590
Scott: and they were you know, they didn't say that much.

286
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:40,770
Scott: They're just like, yeah, you know, there were some programs and things, you know, to help the country recover.

287
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,729
Scott: And then, you know, yeah, that that was that.

288
00:19:45,672 --> 00:19:49,909
Scott: And that and they're like, that's why we have Social Security is like it's like a holdover from those days.

289
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:50,884
Scott: That's why it's still here.

290
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,010
Scott: So what I would urge all of you to know, that's all they say.

291
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:59,485
Scott: And I think most people, you know, who don't pay attention in school never don't remember that at all.

292
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:07,205
Scott: Yeah, you know, and even if you do pay attention in school, unless you look into it more, that's all you're going to know.

293
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:13,489
Rym: Yeah, but so one, this video alone is a good thing to like send to someone or get someone to watch.

294
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:19,430
Rym: It's only six minutes long, who you might suspect doesn't know much about this and try to, you know, make them more of a socialist.

295
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,950
Rym: But the project it's talking about is actually even cooler.

296
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:28,590
Rym: Most of what the New Deal did, the actual details were never formally documented.

297
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,890
Rym: The New Deal was extremely federated, and that's something a lot of people don't understand.

298
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:42,030
Rym: The federal government didn't like Soviet style micromanage all the way down, like build this like that, put this here, build a refinery there.

299
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:56,129
Rym: They really left it to a giant hierarchy of increasingly local administrators to the point that down at the bottom, individual towns, individual counties, they would take the money and the direction they got from the feds up at the top.

300
00:20:56,712 --> 00:20:59,710
Rym: And they would do things that made sense for their local area.

301
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:04,910
Rym: And a lot of that was very effective, but none of those people kept good records.

302
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:11,729
Rym: You expect like some bumblefuck town in Tennessee in the 30s and 40s to keep records of anything that we still have today.

303
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:25,530
Rym: So this project is a long attempt to create a digital database of all the infrastructure and things in detail that the New Deal actually built everywhere in America.

304
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:34,169
Rym: And even what they've collected so far is staggering in scale compared to what even people who know about the New Deal actually think.

305
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:42,010
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, you'll walk around, you know, a town maybe, especially if you're walking near like some historic, you know, kind of kind of thing.

306
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:48,650
Scott: And you'll occasionally you'll see a plaque here and there and it's like, ah, this is a WPA project.

307
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,390
Scott: This thing you're looking at here, right?

308
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,250
Scott: You know, but it's like how much stuff was a WPA project that doesn't fucking say it.

309
00:21:55,471 --> 00:21:57,789
Scott: Doesn't have a plaque because it wasn't fancy a lot.

310
00:21:58,132 --> 00:21:58,237
Rym: Yeah.

311
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:08,510
Rym: I mean, a lot of random probably half the shit we've got a lot of city halls in small towns, a lot of staircases that like connect to a trail that you haven't thought about.

312
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:12,770
Rym: Some roads, a lot of bridges, way more than people expect.

313
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:14,360
Scott: Yep.

314
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:16,128
Rym: So what do you got?

315
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:28,350
Scott: Oh, so, you know, we've been talking for a few years now about, you know, computers playing against people at games, especially games like chess and go.

316
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,690
Scott: It's like, you know, this topic is going to be around a while.

317
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,987
Scott: Someone did something that was, you know, theoretically was like in the back of everyone's mind.

318
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:37,200
Scott: Right.

319
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:38,470
Scott: As like a possibility.

320
00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:41,190
Scott: But no, they went ahead and did it and published a paper on it.

321
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:46,530
Scott: And the title of the paper is adversarial policies beat professional level go AIs.

322
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:46,810
Scott: Right.

323
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:48,529
Scott: So what is what did they do?

324
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:57,163
Scott: So you had a professional level go AI, a computer that can play the game of go better than any person, even the best go players on earth.

325
00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:58,650
Scott: that would beat me immediately.

326
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:00,369
Scott: They can't beat this thing.

327
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:00,682
Scott: Right.

328
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:01,909
Scott: I can't beat this thing.

329
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:03,669
Scott: No person can beat this thing.

330
00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:04,009
Scott: Right.

331
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:15,790
Scott: But the way that these things are set up, these computers work is they're not brute forcing all of go because it's computationally impossible without, you know, using the entire universe as a computer.

332
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,550
Scott: So they, you know, use machine learning.

333
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:19,701
Scott: Right.

334
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:27,989
Scott: They have a database, you know, where they've, they've created a neural network based on go games that, that, that have already been played out.

335
00:23:28,298 --> 00:23:28,569
Scott: Right.

336
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:43,850
Scott: However, this means that they're ready to handle go games that, you know, that are like or close enough to the ones that they've already seen in their massive, massive collection of go games, which is a database.

337
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:48,970
Scott: You know, the, the, the data source for that is go games that people have actually played.

338
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:50,368
Scott: Right.

339
00:23:51,091 --> 00:24:04,992
Scott: So it's, everyone's thinking in the back of their mind, like, well, what if I come at this computer and I just play like all fucked up and stupid with all kinds of moves that make no sense that no one's ever done and have board states that, you know, it's never seen.

340
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:08,989
Scott: that don't line up with, you know, the, the network that's been trained, right.

341
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,429
Scott: It was trained on this data set of, of games.

342
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:16,770
Scott: I'll just play games, play moves that are going to be outside of that data set.

343
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,089
Scott: Right.

344
00:24:17,714 --> 00:24:19,830
Scott: It's never seen anything like this in its training.

345
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:20,550
Scott: Right.

346
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:32,168
Scott: Now, if you play against a human and you were like one of the best human go player on earth and I did something way outside that made no sense, they would just play according to what made sense and destroy me.

347
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:32,550
Scott: Right.

348
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:40,610
Scott: It's like, if you, if you go play baseball and try to be like, you know what, I'm going to bunt, bunt, bunt, bunt, bunt, I'm going to run for home.

349
00:24:40,774 --> 00:24:41,430
Rym: Like, yeah, sure.

350
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,326
Rym: Go for it.

351
00:24:43,054 --> 00:24:44,089
Scott: It's like, yeah, guess what?

352
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,430
Scott: Against professional baseball players, that's not going to work.

353
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:51,649
Scott: You're just going to get out, out, out, basketball, half court shots only, right.

354
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,530
Scott: You're just going to miss them all and lose.

355
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:53,867
Scott: Right.

356
00:24:54,311 --> 00:25:02,090
Scott: But basically against a go AI that's been made on this machine learning frameworks, or perhaps even a chess one that was made the same way.

357
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:13,128
Scott: If you can play these moves outside of its training data set, it basically, you know, it doesn't know what the fuck to do and it does bad moves because it doesn't.

358
00:25:13,852 --> 00:25:15,930
Rym: And then you can beat it really easily.

359
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,450
Rym: Take the all half court shots example.

360
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:27,250
Rym: Imagine if you had a bunch of robots with AI's playing basketball and they broke because they had their logic basically assumed you immediately come into the offensive zone.

361
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,110
Rym: Like you cross over.

362
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,210
Scott: It's like their defense is set up to assume that you're going to play a normal offense.

363
00:25:32,351 --> 00:25:36,630
Scott: If you just make all half court shots, they won't even try to defend you because they've never seen that happen.

364
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,890
Rym: So imagine they get confused and they're just standing by the net and you just win.

365
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,490
Scott: They're defending the three point line.

366
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,109
Scott: They're defending, you know, the paint and it's like, you're just taking half court shots.

367
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,488
Scott: You can take your sweet ass time, line them up carefully, right?

368
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,468
Scott: And maybe down, you know, dunk enough of them in there.

369
00:25:53,911 --> 00:25:58,290
Scott: It's like that a little, you know, as long as, and so that's basically what they did.

370
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:06,637
Scott: And in this paper, it's like they actually took that theoretical hypothetical situation and they did it and it worked and it worked.

371
00:26:06,637 --> 00:26:12,808
Scott: 99 greater than 99% of the time they beat this one particular go AI.

372
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,601
Rym: Like it worked way, way good, very well.

373
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:24,436
Rym: If they gave the AI significant search capacities, like they put a bunch of resources at it, it dropped down to 50%.

374
00:26:24,436 --> 00:26:25,110
Scott: Yeah, right.

375
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:31,331
Rym: Which is still way better than humans do against AIs traditionally, which is 0%.

376
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:37,570
Scott: Yes, but it's still fascinating that something that was like one of those, yeah, in theory kind of deals.

377
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,509
Scott: It's like, nope, nope.

378
00:26:38,671 --> 00:26:40,010
Scott: It actually does have this weakness.

379
00:26:40,155 --> 00:26:40,569
Scott: Here it is.

380
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,709
Scott: We did exploit the weakness.

381
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,829
Scott: The weak spot is here.

382
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,546
Scott: Here it is.

383
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:49,010
Scott: It's a 90, it's a 50 to 99% effective weak spot right here for real.

384
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,430
Rym: And this actually leads into one, this is actually the meta plot of Westworld.

385
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:58,426
Rym: If you watch the show, like once they get out of the place and get into the real world, this is the plot.

386
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:03,550
Rym: But two, this is actually a topic that is part of my professional life.

387
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:12,906
Rym: The future I see, this is my professional opinion, especially for operations, for serious jobs involving serious things, is augmented AI.

388
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:19,810
Rym: Humans augmenting their decisions with AI, but humans are still inputting into the equation.

389
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:36,410
Rym: Because what this shows is one example of how AIs are objectively better at a lot of things, but humans are still better at, with very low resource expenditure, having a very high success rate at discarding objectively stupid ideas.

390
00:27:36,913 --> 00:27:41,745
Rym: That is something computers cannot do well, and that is something that human brains are uniquely capable of doing.

391
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:50,148
Rym: So the most powerful thing in the world would be a professional Go player who has access to a professional Go API.

392
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:52,630
Rym: That is unbeatable by anything.

393
00:27:54,610 --> 00:28:00,205
Scott: Oh, what if you had two professional Go players who both have access to an AI to help them play?

394
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,370
Scott: I think would it, would it, would it just be the same result as AI versus AI?

395
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:09,589
Rym: I think it would, but either one of them would be able to beat any unassisted AI.

396
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:12,130
Rym: Is my guess.

397
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:17,004
Scott: Because they would, because they would start out by doing something wild that would mess up the other AI.

398
00:28:18,211 --> 00:28:29,410
Rym: And of course those examples, like those, those ideas sort of break down in these toy problems because the kinds of problems this approach is actually aimed at are messy things that could never be solved by computers.

399
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:34,788
Rym: Like imagine someone running the logistics operations for a giant container shipping company.

400
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:40,288
Rym: AI plus human is going to do better at that than AI or human, probably for as long as humans exist.

401
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:53,310
Scott: Yeah, for real world applications, I think, you know, it's like, we're always, it seems like we're going to have some human there at some point to basically whose job it is is to take these cases where, you know, I could see that being the thing, right?

402
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:59,650
Scott: It's like we already have like self-driving car, but there's a person there when the car is messed up, who then has to take over.

403
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:07,929
Scott: It's like, so I could see that being the way the world works is like, yeah, you know, there's some machine that runs a factory and someone sits there and their job is to watch it.

404
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:15,630
Scott: But if it ever messes up, then the person has to be ready to push a button and do type in an instruction.

405
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:26,350
Rym: And also think about one of the big problems we face as a society is that technology is used very rarely with any ethical compass or moral compass for all the reasons we talk about a lot.

406
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:32,950
Rym: We don't need to get into that, but AIs by themselves might do things that are counter to the mission.

407
00:29:33,332 --> 00:29:37,910
Rym: And AI can't understand the true full intent of what we want to use it for.

408
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:39,889
Rym: It only understands what we tell it to do.

409
00:29:40,671 --> 00:29:58,849
Rym: So if we build increasingly complex AI driven machine learning driven systems that control broad aspects of society in a better functioning society, one of the jobs humans will have is tuning that AI, not just dealing with it when it fails, not just sitting there with the stop button, but like tuning it and guiding it.

410
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,968
Scott: And I think constantly improving it, teaching it these bad scenarios so it knows what to do in them.

411
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,370
Rym: But I also think there are humans who will sort of step beyond that and they will serve.

412
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:18,850
Rym: their job will be to ensure that the AIs are achieving the human intent and not their own purposes or nefarious late capitalist purposes.

413
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:25,629
Rym: The problem is for the foreseeable future, the humans hired to do that work are hired by the late capitalist people.

414
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:30,870
Rym: As we saw with Twitter, humans who do the right thing in these situations tend to just get fired.

415
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,665
Rym: So we're not there yet, but that is a future job.

416
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,290
Rym: Human ethics AI officer in the meta moment.

417
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,609
Rym: The GeekNights book club book.

418
00:30:40,731 --> 00:30:41,570
Rym: I leave the unseen.

419
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:48,829
Rym: I'm going to start reading it probably this weekend or or or I propose to you.

420
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:51,530
Rym: Do we both agree that we just read the world?

421
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,349
Rym: We make first get it out of the way because I kind of want to read that real quick.

422
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:56,787
Scott: I don't know.

423
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,190
Scott: We'll see.

424
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,009
Scott: We'll see what's doing.

425
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:58,470
Scott: Who knows?

426
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,089
Rym: You just all right.

427
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,650
Rym: We'll do the usual thing, whichever one of us.

428
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,669
Scott: You don't got to do what I do.

429
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,709
Scott: Just do whatever you're going to do.

430
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:05,950
Rym: I'm just saying I'm going to start reading a leaf.

431
00:31:06,153 --> 00:31:06,447
Rym: The unseen.

432
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:13,590
Rym: The moment you tell me that you've started reading a leaf, the unseen, you're just going to follow me because if you don't, I read one page already.

433
00:31:13,878 --> 00:31:14,048
Rym: Fuck.

434
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:14,530
Rym: All right.

435
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,510
Rym: I'm going to start reading it unless you're lying.

436
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:19,249
Scott: No, I read like one page.

437
00:31:19,518 --> 00:31:19,750
Rym: Okay.

438
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:20,785
Rym: I'm going to start reading it then.

439
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,548
Scott: Literally one page.

440
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,250
Scott: I downloaded it like a while ago before I even chose it as the book club book.

441
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,410
Scott: I read one page and then I put it aside.

442
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:33,430
Scott: Not because it was bad, but because it wasn't reading time.

443
00:31:33,511 --> 00:31:34,689
Scott: I was just like checking it out.

444
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,019
Rym: Yep.

445
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:38,109
Rym: We will be live on Sunday at PAX Unplugged.

446
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,849
Rym: Maybe just me, most likely the two of us.

447
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:45,370
Rym: It's an easy day trip and I do have a devil device I can use to transport us there.

448
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:49,590
Rym: It only costs society a small amount, but it'll be convenient for us.

449
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,348
Rym: We can take the car.

450
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,790
Rym: But why is this game taking four hours?

451
00:31:53,991 --> 00:31:55,710
Rym: Is our panel at PAX Unplugged on Sunday?

452
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:02,610
Rym: I realized I haven't made a post about it yet because I gave up on most of my posts while I was sorting out my fucking microblog.

453
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,130
Rym: So I got to set all that up.

454
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,107
Rym: I will make the post tonight.

455
00:32:06,411 --> 00:32:08,890
Rym: Otherwise, stay tuned for what we do in the future.

456
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,530
Rym: Follow us on non-Twitter places.

457
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,410
Rym: Do not assume that Twitter will stick around.

458
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:15,469
Rym: I am microblogging.

459
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:21,110
Rym: There is a Mastodon you can follow me on, though I do not see anything that someone replies to it.

460
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:24,610
Rym: It is purely a feed of things I post in various places.

461
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,207
Rym: It's not like a social thing I'm going to use.

462
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,648
Rym: But if you want to subscribe to me there, go for it.

463
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:31,330
Rym: The GeekNights Forum is rocking.

464
00:32:31,953 --> 00:32:33,350
Rym: GeekNights Discord rocking.

465
00:32:33,832 --> 00:32:38,010
Rym: If you know me, send me a friend request on Discord with all your friends.

466
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:43,470
Rym: Make sure the people you know online, you have multiple ways to contact them because no platform will last forever.

467
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,208
Rym: What else we got?

468
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,569
Rym: Any other meta bits?

469
00:32:50,737 --> 00:32:51,770
Rym: I see you're looking off to the side.

470
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,910
Rym: You're clearly reading something and not paying attention to the show.

471
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,810
Rym: So we'll move right on to comms and games.

472
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:58,869
Scott: This is your idea.

473
00:32:59,290 --> 00:32:59,379
Rym: Yeah.

474
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:10,950
Rym: So a long time ago, I basically always had voice chat because from the era of... We'll talk about video games first because there's a whole other world of other types of communication.

475
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:25,689
Rym: But in competitive versus or even cooperative video games that you could play against people for most people, for most of video game history, this wasn't a concern because you can only really play games with other people in the same room at the same time.

476
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,190
Rym: So comms was you're yelling at each other in the same room.

477
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,389
Rym: You're playing, I don't know, Goldeneye and you're either in the room or you aren't.

478
00:33:32,812 --> 00:33:34,050
Rym: If you're not in the room, you're not playing.

479
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:34,648
Rym: So that was that.

480
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:40,690
Rym: But with Doom, when Doom came out, Doom was a game.

481
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,670
Rym: There were games that came out before Doom, of course, that had multiplayer.

482
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:49,630
Rym: But I could dial one of my friends with the modem and we could play Doom against each other remotely.

483
00:33:50,271 --> 00:34:02,070
Rym: And in that era, when I was using a computer and a dial-up modem to dial the phone number of a friend to play one-on-one Doom deathmatch, both of us, our families had two phone lines.

484
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,770
Rym: We would be on the phone with phone line one talking while we played.

485
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,670
Rym: And we had phone line two dedicated to playing the game.

486
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:13,730
Scott: So, I mean, even if you didn't have the two phone lines, right?

487
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:18,510
Scott: How could you arrange the dial on the second phone line, right?

488
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,290
Scott: It's like if you only had the one phone line each, what would you do?

489
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:24,025
Scott: Like at school, tell each other, all right, at exactly 5 p.m.

490
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:26,010
Scott: Sync your watches.

491
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,690
Scott: You open up your modem and I'll dial.

492
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,310
Scott: And here's the number and we'll hope it works.

493
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,270
Scott: And then if you feel like it doesn't work, it's like, how do you coordinate?

494
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:37,270
Scott: You start trying to call them on the phone, but they're trying to modem.

495
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:37,572
Scott: Yeah.

496
00:34:37,594 --> 00:34:38,530
Scott: They don't pick up the phone.

497
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:47,370
Scott: It's like, you know, there was no way to arrange that sort of multiplayer video gaming unless you had two lines where on one line, you're talking to each other.

498
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,310
Scott: And on the second line, you're doing the dial-up biz.

499
00:34:50,771 --> 00:34:53,409
Scott: Or unless you had some other mechanism, like, I don't know.

500
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:58,427
Scott: Fucking cell phone or walkie-talkie.

501
00:34:58,447 --> 00:34:59,290
Rym: I'm talking this was before.

502
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:02,150
Scott: You live next door to each other and you have walkie-talkies and radios.

503
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,130
Rym: I use walkie-talkies to do this, actually, because they would reach a couple blocks.

504
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,550
Rym: We had big CB radios.

505
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:12,890
Rym: So we would use CB radio to coordinate online gaming and even do online voice sometimes.

506
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:14,529
Rym: Like while we're playing a game.

507
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:16,450
Scott: Yeah, you could, you know, something, right?

508
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,044
Scott: But there wasn't, there weren't that many choices in the 90s, right?

509
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,050
Scott: So we're available to everyday people.

510
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:24,166
Scott: So that was your options.

511
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:25,927
Rym: Yeah, that was pretty much it.

512
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:29,070
Rym: And games, of course, did not incorporate this.

513
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:34,470
Rym: In games, however, once you were in a game, you could usually text chat with people.

514
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,069
Rym: You could send little messages, type stuff.

515
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:40,270
Rym: And that was a big part about how people would play games and communicate for a long time.

516
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,950
Rym: Imagine a team game of some Quake mod, like Capture the Flag.

517
00:35:44,411 --> 00:35:51,050
Rym: If you're on a team and you're playing seriously, either you all set up some like party line, like a phone number.

518
00:35:51,210 --> 00:36:02,438
Rym: You'd all dial it like literally dial into with a literal dial to have a voice chat among your team while you were playing a serious match, which my friends who were in clans did legitimately like.

519
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:04,390
Rym: they paid for this stuff and had infrastructure.

520
00:36:05,194 --> 00:36:07,070
Rym: Or you would just type messages.

521
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,089
Rym: There was early games, had team chat and and all chat for a reason.

522
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:12,229
Scott: Yep.

523
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:20,770
Scott: And the only problem with typing messages is that when you when you're typing, you can't also be like playing at the same time.

524
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,430
Scott: It's like you're using the keyboard to type a message.

525
00:36:23,571 --> 00:36:29,421
Scott: You have to even if you type really fast and have a good keyboard shortcut and whatnot, it's like you can't.

526
00:36:29,864 --> 00:36:30,670
Scott: you know, you're stuck.

527
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,770
Scott: That's a point in time in which you're not pushing like WASD to move like your characters standing still.

528
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:36,570
Scott: Right.

529
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,390
Scott: In Counter Strike, you could chat with your goat, your dead teammates.

530
00:36:39,551 --> 00:36:42,930
Scott: Once you died, you couldn't smartly they configured it through.

531
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:47,910
Scott: You couldn't tell the living people what was up to tell them where the enemies were hiding.

532
00:36:48,076 --> 00:36:48,449
Scott: Good move.

533
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:54,690
Scott: But, you know, in like Quake, it's like you could chat with everyone or just your team.

534
00:36:54,831 --> 00:36:57,910
Scott: But it's like, you know, you got to stop quaking when you do that.

535
00:36:58,214 --> 00:36:59,070
Scott: It's not very helpful.

536
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:03,390
Rym: So the funniest thing about text chat in that era was there were two competing cultures.

537
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:12,370
Rym: Some of the people I play games with were very adamant that if you saw someone was just standing still, you should never shoot them because you're being a jerk.

538
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,749
Rym: They're clearly typing something.

539
00:37:14,513 --> 00:37:18,070
Rym: I was of the correct enlightened idea that you play to win the game.

540
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:19,286
Scott: That's right.

541
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,524
Scott: It's like if the game wanted you to be, you know, to let.

542
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,230
Scott: it's like, yeah, there's a cost to communication, right?

543
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,990
Scott: You better be hiding or something, right?

544
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,339
Scott: Yeah.

545
00:37:30,111 --> 00:37:34,369
Scott: So free voice wanted you to be invincible when typing, then they wouldn't let you be invincible while typing.

546
00:37:34,511 --> 00:37:42,929
Scott: And that would have been a problem because then the technique in the game would have been as soon as you see someone open up the text chat and they can't kill you.

547
00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:43,409
Scott: Right.

548
00:37:43,573 --> 00:37:44,450
Scott: And they can't get a frag.

549
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,808
Scott: And then you wait for them to leave.

550
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:51,610
Scott: I remember some later games would even show or you surprise them and you press enter and you shoot, right?

551
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:58,469
Rym: Some later games would even show a little like icon over people when they were typing, which was just which means up easy targets.

552
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,185
Scott: There they are.

553
00:37:59,510 --> 00:37:59,963
Scott: Bam, bam, bam.

554
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:00,847
Scott: So look at this.

555
00:38:01,994 --> 00:38:06,130
Rym: Even back then, we had the concept of text chat versus voice chat.

556
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:12,830
Rym: And we had the concept of voice chat or text versus voice and team versus all.

557
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:20,129
Rym: We had these concepts even in the pretty early days of online competitive games and cooperative games.

558
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:20,850
Rym: That was all there.

559
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,406
Rym: That was the thing.

560
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,330
Scott: Even if you played hearts online, you had a little chat room.

561
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:35,570
Rym: But these were unrestricted communications means, which all of us from later eras know wasn't a problem until it was a problem.

562
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,710
Rym: And once that became a problem, it became the problem.

563
00:38:39,712 --> 00:38:43,750
Scott: It's basically a chat room with a bunch of randos, and that's not a great place, especially

564
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:56,710
Rym: in an era before the concept of like kicking people off servers and blocking people like it really only worked because back then you'd only play games with people you prearranged with as soon as there were servers and queues and ladders and matchmaking.

565
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,510
Scott: This became and it became easy for just any old person to join.

566
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:10,930
Scott: It wasn't the only the realm of the vastly dedicated, the only people who were playing in those early days were not just people who are technically sophisticated, which was sort of gatekeeping.

567
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:12,309
Scott: That is good that that's gone.

568
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:27,870
Scott: But people who cared about doing this, playing this game so much that they were going to spend a lot of money and time to make it work are just less likely to also be the kind of person who is just going to do all that effort.

569
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,369
Scott: Just to type racist slurs.

570
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,029
Scott: That's like, that's not what it's like.

571
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:34,250
Scott: They're doing that because they want to play the game somewhat seriously.

572
00:39:34,753 --> 00:39:37,730
Scott: So there were, you know, there were, were there people who are shitty?

573
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:38,290
Scott: Yeah.

574
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:44,950
Scott: Cause there's shitty people who just, you know, who did this, who happened to also be bad people, but it was, you know, less right.

575
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,609
Scott: Whereas once it became accessible, just anyone could do it.

576
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:51,230
Scott: Well, people were playing games that didn't care so much about the game.

577
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,329
Scott: It was just sort of like a time wasting activity for them.

578
00:39:54,971 --> 00:40:00,949
Scott: And if it wasn't that fun for them, they had more fun typing racist slurs than they had actually playing the game.

579
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:02,668
Scott: So that's when it got bad.

580
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:09,750
Rym: So in the Quake 2 era, I did something that I thought was clever.

581
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:24,350
Rym: And then I discovered that other people playing in the clans and like COQ types had already been doing, you know, those games you could script and mod and like do it, like just do a bunch of crazy crap, like give yourself extra types of commands and like a 180 flip or whatever.

582
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:32,670
Rym: So I made a bunch of commands on my keyboard that would, with one click of a button, type a message to everyone else in the team.

583
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:38,950
Rym: So I made all these mappings and they were generic enough to like sniper in mid.

584
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:44,988
Rym: So I could just, if a sniper shot me in mid, I would just hit that and I could tell my team, hey, there's a sniper in mid.

585
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:54,069
Rym: Or move forward, fall back, all these basic commands, which is a modern sensibility of how a lot of games should do this.

586
00:40:54,230 --> 00:41:01,549
Rym: Not just because you can then, in some games, if you don't want to have unrestricted communication channels, maybe remove them.

587
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:14,269
Rym: But also, this is a very profound accessibility feature for people who can't hear or can't talk because suddenly I can communicate in the game in a way that people playing the game could see, even if they can't hear my voice.

588
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:19,625
Scott: Or people, right, people can hear because there could be like, you know, counter strike, right?

589
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:25,750
Scott: It's like you could just open up the like the voice menu and press like a number and it would be like circle around back, you know.

590
00:41:26,252 --> 00:41:28,944
Scott: And in tribes, they added in, there was a huge.

591
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:32,570
Scott: tribes is the one that really, I think, you know, tribes two had this to the green.

592
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:33,249
Rym: Oh my God.

593
00:41:34,873 --> 00:41:44,000
Scott: By default, you would press V and V would open up this huge menu that would categorize different possible, you know, there was a whole waypoint a soon.

594
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:51,950
Scott: So everything was like two or three single presses in a row.

595
00:41:52,031 --> 00:41:53,061
Scott: So it always start with V, right?

596
00:41:54,193 --> 00:41:56,170
Scott: So you'd be like V for voice, right?

597
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,890
Scott: To say something.

598
00:41:57,351 --> 00:42:04,350
Scott: Then you'd be like, I don't remember exactly what the choices were, but like I for insult and then like, you know, I don't know.

599
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:07,966
Scott: You could, Chazbot was like one of the things you could say that was like basically like, damn.

600
00:42:08,218 --> 00:42:08,390
Scott: Right.

601
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,870
Scott: So you'd be like, you're like VI V something.

602
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,750
Scott: S it'd be like chat and your guy would a say the word out loud.

603
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:15,870
Scott: Chazbot, right?

604
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:24,170
Scott: Everyone would hear that your characters voice actors saying the word Chazbot and the word Chazbot would appear in the chat next to your name.

605
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:34,410
Scott: So people who couldn't hear could see that, you know, Scott said Chazbot and people who could hear didn't could keep the chat closed and heard the word Chazbot.

606
00:42:34,812 --> 00:42:40,387
Scott: And you didn't really have to stop playing because you typed in a really quick command like, like you went V something, something like that, right?

607
00:42:41,214 --> 00:42:42,350
Scott: Not going to mess up your game.

608
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:48,229
Scott: You can keep playing and no one else has like look away from the screen to read it unless, you know, they really had to.

609
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:50,929
Rym: Now, is this as good?

610
00:42:51,311 --> 00:42:54,330
Scott: Nobody could say racist slurs because racist slurs weren't in the menu.

611
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:00,230
Rym: So is this as good as just open voice comes with your team from a operational play perspective?

612
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,189
Rym: Absolutely not.

613
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:08,348
Rym: Is it a good, valuable feature to exist alongside that or even an exclusion of it if the game has a problem with this?

614
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:09,170
Rym: Absolutely.

615
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,989
Scott: I mean, for for public play, right?

616
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:19,429
Scott: The protection by making that the only communication mechanism, which is like what Hearthstone did, where you can only say like six things or whatever, right?

617
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:23,030
Scott: It provides a great protection against abuse and harassment.

618
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:33,030
Scott: And if the menu choices are, you know, vast enough, you're not losing that much in terms of, you know, team communication.

619
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:43,130
Scott: But if you're doing a serious competitive game, right, like real esports championship, then it's like, yeah, you need to actually just be able to fully talk to people.

620
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:46,910
Scott: It's not going to cut it, but that's not most cases.

621
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:47,788
Scott: So what's the big deal?

622
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:56,049
Rym: Now, it's interesting because this leads to a situation that I've seen in Overwatch where I prefer to play with people who have voice on.

623
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,530
Rym: Like, it's just easier to communicate.

624
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,230
Rym: It's easier to coordinate, like, whatever.

625
00:43:59,310 --> 00:43:59,670
Rym: That's fine.

626
00:43:59,952 --> 00:44:01,190
Rym: I only play competitive anyway.

627
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:09,117
Rym: But if you join a game with randos as opposed to coming in with a team, there might be a few people on your team.

628
00:44:09,137 --> 00:44:10,510
Rym: for whatever reason, just don't join voice.

629
00:44:10,891 --> 00:44:12,669
Rym: Maybe they join and listen, even if they don't talk.

630
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:13,946
Rym: Maybe they don't join at all.

631
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,100
Scott: Maybe they have good reasons, right?

632
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,768
Scott: Maybe they can't talk.

633
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:41,270
Scott: Maybe they have a voice that has an accent or a tone or a pitch that would result in them receiving harassment and they don't want to expose some information about themselves that would be garnished or whatever through just hearing their voice.

634
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:47,469
Scott: Or even maybe they don't have the technological capabilities or sophistication to set it up.

635
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:52,210
Scott: Maybe there is sounds in their house around them they don't want anyone hearing.

636
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,989
Rym: Maybe Emily is working on a project and I can't be super loud next to her playing this one match, so I got to be quiet.

637
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:07,130
Scott: Yeah, there are tons and tons of valid reasons for someone to not use the voice chat while they're playing a game.

638
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:09,470
Rym: There is a fairly well-documented phenomenon.

639
00:45:09,631 --> 00:45:12,749
Rym: I'm not saying this is just data to internalize.

640
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:20,470
Rym: If a team has all six people in voice, they were objectively more likely to win every time, across the board, without exception.

641
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:28,050
Rym: And the fun side effect was that a lot of people will join a game like that with their friends.

642
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:31,250
Rym: Like when we play Fortnite, we never use the Fortnite chat.

643
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,749
Rym: We're in our own Discord chatting with each other.

644
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:40,334
Rym: Occasionally we'll play in a mode where our rando gets put on our team and we just don't hear what they say.

645
00:45:40,354 --> 00:45:42,347
Rym: and they don't hear what we say and they're kind of just.

646
00:45:42,427 --> 00:45:43,467
Rym: we just treat them like an NPC.

647
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:47,850
Rym: That's probably worse for them objectively.

648
00:45:48,851 --> 00:45:49,315
Scott: They just also.

649
00:45:49,396 --> 00:45:50,649
Scott: it's also worse for your team.

650
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:55,010
Rym: It is, but it's better for us having fun while we're playing the game.

651
00:45:56,192 --> 00:45:58,327
Scott: So I mean, but that's the thing back in the day, right?

652
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:08,010
Scott: You know, not it's sort of a newer thing that video games having, you know, I guess newer for us, it's not actually new where video games included the voice chat in the game.

653
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:11,650
Scott: It wasn't until like Steam added that functionality, right?

654
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,209
Scott: Early Counter Strike didn't have that.

655
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:14,665
Scott: It was like added at some point.

656
00:46:15,251 --> 00:46:17,970
Rym: I remember people used to run Ventrilo servers for that, right?

657
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:33,688
Scott: You would run Ventrilo or TeamSpeak in order and then you would have to tell people like, hey, you know, maybe you'd put it in like the server title or description or you just tell your friends, everyone join this speak server Ventrilo or TeamSpeak and then we'll join this game server, right?

658
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,130
Scott: This is when we finally had real internet and I didn't have to use dial up anymore.

659
00:46:38,812 --> 00:46:45,370
Scott: And then it would be basically the same as using discord nowadays to do your voice chat separately from the in game voice chat.

660
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:49,890
Scott: And even though that's not as much of a thing anymore, it's still a thing.

661
00:46:50,251 --> 00:47:08,760
Scott: In fact, if you want to do voice chat for any online game on Nintendo Switch, the way that works is you have to open up the Nintendo Switch online app on your phone or other mobile device and then do the voice chat in that app and you'll be able to talk to the other people in the same game as you like.

662
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:12,430
Scott: if you're playing someone in like, I don't know, fucking Mario Tennis and Mario Kart or something, right?

663
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,890
Scott: But you can't do it just with the switch alone.

664
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:16,149
Scott: They don't support that.

665
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,149
Scott: You can't like plug a microphone into the switch and just talk.

666
00:47:19,677 --> 00:47:20,249
Scott: They don't do that.

667
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:25,290
Scott: You have to go to the switch online app separately as if it was TeamSpeak or Ventrilo.

668
00:47:26,798 --> 00:47:27,190
Rym: It's awful.

669
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:31,369
Rym: Nintendo, like everyone understands why Nintendo does it the way they do it.

670
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:42,770
Rym: But Nintendo is like above and beyond on the protections to the point that I don't think I've ever used a Nintendo communications mechanism on purpose since DictoChat.

671
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,044
Rym: I think that's literally it.

672
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:51,710
Rym: So modern games like contemporary current games, Overwatch does this.

673
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,928
Rym: Other games do this too.

674
00:47:53,652 --> 00:47:54,910
Rym: They do something even cooler.

675
00:47:55,352 --> 00:47:59,309
Rym: The environmental ambient sounds will also have visual triggers now.

676
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:04,690
Rym: So you have an accessibility thing where even if you won't hear something, you might see it and vice versa.

677
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:12,010
Rym: But two, the characters themselves will call things out that you as a player saw.

678
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:13,254
Rym: Like if like.

679
00:48:13,295 --> 00:48:15,309
Rym: it has obviously heuristics for this.

680
00:48:15,652 --> 00:48:16,470
Rym: So here's an example.

681
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:17,790
Rym: Say I'm playing Overwatch.

682
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:18,970
Rym: I'm the tank.

683
00:48:19,092 --> 00:48:19,488
Rym: I'm D.Va.

684
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:23,090
Rym: I fly forward ahead of the team to the point and I get hit by a sniper.

685
00:48:23,272 --> 00:48:24,830
Rym: Like I don't die because I'm a tank.

686
00:48:25,131 --> 00:48:27,569
Rym: But like there's a sniper to the right and they hit me.

687
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:34,750
Rym: My character will on her own say in a way that my teammates can hear.

688
00:48:35,272 --> 00:48:37,530
Rym: There's a sniper by the point.

689
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:40,778
Rym: So I don't even have to just sort of.

690
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:46,710
Scott: they just basically put certain situations that will trigger the automated voice menu from tribes.

691
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:49,710
Scott: And what you don't have to actually type it in yourself.

692
00:48:49,810 --> 00:49:02,130
Rym: But the beauty of this is that starts to reduce the advantage a team where all six people are in voice actively using it over a team where one or more people aren't in voice for whatever reason.

693
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:11,050
Scott: I think it also helps if you are playing on a team where some of the members of your team are bots who can't talk and communicate.

694
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,630
Scott: Well, now they have some sort of automatic communication.

695
00:49:16,513 --> 00:49:19,010
Rym: And I think we're going to see continued evolution in this space.

696
00:49:19,636 --> 00:49:21,029
Rym: I don't have any like prescriptive.

697
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:22,909
Rym: This is what games should do.

698
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:23,950
Rym: Every game is different.

699
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,729
Rym: Every game designer has to make their own decisions.

700
00:49:26,491 --> 00:49:32,789
Rym: But I do personally like being in voice with the people I'm playing games with generally pretty much across the board.

701
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:36,109
Rym: But that's also a privilege that I can just quit a game if someone's being a jerk.

702
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:40,070
Scott: Not that I think the ideal the ideal scenario.

703
00:49:40,401 --> 00:49:40,590
Scott: Right.

704
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:55,910
Scott: Which is, I think, been done a few times, but it's not really been like fully done is where the in-game communication that is happening is actually like mirrored by in the canon of the games world.

705
00:49:56,504 --> 00:49:56,670
Scott: Right.

706
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,449
Scott: So like maybe there's an MMO.

707
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:03,890
Scott: And if you just talk, only the people who are like standing close enough to you can hear you.

708
00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:04,629
Rym: Bunch of games do that.

709
00:50:05,616 --> 00:50:05,810
Scott: Yeah.

710
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:10,210
Scott: But there's not like a bunch that do it like super, super well.

711
00:50:10,392 --> 00:50:11,770
Scott: And it's like this huge thing.

712
00:50:11,856 --> 00:50:11,988
Scott: Right.

713
00:50:12,657 --> 00:50:13,869
Scott: You know, a game like that.

714
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:19,849
Scott: But maybe you also have like there's a radio in the game and you actually dial frequencies on it and talk to people.

715
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:21,169
Scott: It's been tried a few times.

716
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:22,430
Scott: Snake.

717
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:31,310
Scott: But it's not like, you know, it's like that sort of thing where it's like, yeah, the in-game voice chat is actually an item or an ability in the game.

718
00:50:31,451 --> 00:50:35,110
Scott: Like it's a real thing that works in some sort of real way.

719
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:39,130
Scott: You know, you can't just pop up a chat box and type whatever the heck you want.

720
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:39,324
Scott: Right.

721
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,210
Scott: Because that's not a thing you can do in real life.

722
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:42,350
Scott: There are a lot of good.

723
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:48,968
Scott: You could give players smartphones in the game and then, you know, they could, you know, if it was like a Pokemon MMO.

724
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:49,870
Scott: Right.

725
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:56,710
Scott: Everyone could open up their Pokedex and type in someone's trainer ID and text them in the game in a way that makes sense in the world.

726
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:57,809
Rym: I guess I don't know.

727
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:00,529
Rym: Digetic sound in a competitive game is a mixed bag.

728
00:51:01,352 --> 00:51:03,949
Rym: Really depends on exactly what what this game's deal is.

729
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:05,130
Scott: Yeah.

730
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:10,530
Scott: I just said, you know, this kind of thing has been experimented with and been done sometimes.

731
00:51:11,013 --> 00:51:13,110
Scott: But it's never been done like big time.

732
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:20,610
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

733
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:23,030
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

734
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:25,730
Rym: Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

735
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:31,150
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

736
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:34,070
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

737
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:38,810
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

739
00:51:43,593 --> 00:51:46,650
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

740
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:49,770
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

741
00:52:46,732 --> 00:52:47,446
Rym: At their request.

742
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:55,569
Rym: And anyway, I'm just gonna leave you tonight with about this.

743
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,049
Rym: What is Hasperaat?

744
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:57,642
Rym: Hasperaat.

745
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:58,344
Rym: Hasperaat.

746
00:52:58,770 --> 00:52:59,104
Rym: Hasperaat.

747
00:52:59,450 --> 00:52:59,826
Rym: Hasperaat.

748
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:00,664
Rym: Hasperaat.

749
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:02,066
Rym: Hasperaat.

750
00:53:03,332 --> 00:53:03,687
Rym: Hasperaat.

751
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:04,308
Rym: Hasperaat.

752
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:05,310
Rym: Hasperaat.

753
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:05,869
Scott: Hasperaat.

754
00:53:06,193 --> 00:53:06,486
Rym: Hasperaat.

755
00:53:06,671 --> 00:53:07,026
Rym: Hasperaat.

756
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:08,346
Rym: Hasperaat.

757
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:09,229
Rym: Hasperaat.

758
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:09,610
Rym: Hasperaat.

759
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:09,870
Rym: Hasperaat.

760
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:11,289
Rym: It's a pajama dish.

761
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:12,428
Rym: Very spicy.

762
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,450
Rym: Sometimes it's some kind of burrito or wrap.

763
00:53:16,011 --> 00:53:17,470
Rym: One time it looks more like a bowl of chili.
