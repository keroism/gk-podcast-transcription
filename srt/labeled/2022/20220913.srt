1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,488
Rym: It's Tuesday, September 13th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:10,709
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:14,657
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,226
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:19,560
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about multiplayer game servers.

6
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:22,938
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:29,230
Scott: So, the place in which I live, you know, New York City, right?

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:38,810
Scott: Most of the establishments of commerce, right, are gonna be your small, you know, tight places that are in a mixed zone building, right?

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,669
Scott: You know, bodegas, nail salons, restaurants, right?

10
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:47,970
Scott: You got a few larger grocery stores here and there, but they're not, like, supermarkets from the suburbs, right?

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,110
Scott: Those only exist in car places, pretty much, right?

12
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:58,550
Scott: You know, and then I guess the third kind might be, like, Fancy Manhattan Store would be the third kind of establishment, right?

13
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,570
Scott: You know, but lately, you know, there have been more suburban-style establishments, right?

14
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,589
Scott: There's a Wegmans in Brooklyn.

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,850
Scott: They're gonna open a Wegmans where, I guess it's not a new one.

16
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,830
Rym: I was about to mention that other Wegmans that's coming.

17
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:16,070
Scott: The other Wegmans is in a former Kmart location, so it's not really a change from city-style to suburban-style.

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:32,890
Scott: But one suburban-style commerce establishment that has existed in New York for as long as I've lived here, even longer, that I've never gone to, despite the fact that it's literally two or three blocks away from where I live, is Costco.

19
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,190
Scott: There is an enormous Costco.

20
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,290
Rym: Oh, yeah, I run past that Costco, like, two or three times a week in the summer.

21
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,670
Scott: Have you ever been in the Costco?

22
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,450
Rym: Never once, though I often, you know what I do?

23
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:50,150
Rym: There is, a condition of that Costco being built was that they had to make the waterfront accessible to the public.

24
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:51,410
Scott: That is, that is correct.

25
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:57,230
Rym: So there's a really nice waterfront park that connects, like, kind of between the Socrates sculpture, like, there's this nice little park back there.

26
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,550
Scott: It goes from Socrates to Rainy Park, like, this little tiny path behind the Costco.

27
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:02,730
Rym: It's a nice little running path.

28
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,490
Rym: There are almost always cool dudes fishing back there, families having little picnics.

29
00:02:07,156 --> 00:02:08,229
Rym: It's actually a pretty nice place.

30
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,970
Rym: If I was a kid, that is the place our parents would have dumped us while they shopped, because it is a pain in the ass to shop with kids.

31
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,110
Scott: There are many kids dumped back there.

32
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,930
Scott: But anyway, you know, I've been thinking, you know, because the economy has fucked the fuck up.

33
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,430
Rym: Oh, I got some, I can talk about some fuck-the-fuck-up economy.

34
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:26,789
Rym: PAX, uh, PAX was weird.

35
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:27,970
Rym: I'll leave it at that.

36
00:02:28,153 --> 00:02:29,190
Rym: We'll talk about that in a minute.

37
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:38,250
Scott: But anyway, even though the economy has fucked the fuck up, despite the fact that I'm admittedly very affluent, right, I'm like, you know, it wouldn't hurt to save some money at the Costco.

38
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,990
Scott: The reason I've never gone to the Costco is because it's like, I don't have a lot of room in my apartment.

39
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:49,790
Rym: Oh yeah, I order, like, one 12-pack of toilet paper and we get a new one when we're down to, like, four rolls left.

40
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,930
Rym: Like, I do not keep stuff.

41
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:57,170
Scott: So I'm like, yeah, I could go in there and I could buy something large, right, to save money, you know, per unit, at least on the unit price.

42
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:11,910
Scott: But if I don't finish or use all of that before it spoils, assuming it's a spoilable good, or if it takes up too much space and I have nowhere to store it in my small apartment, that's like I'm not really saving any money here, right, if I'm throwing stuff away.

43
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:24,450
Scott: You know, one time I bought a, um, I bought a giant Kirkland olive oil on the internet, and whoever I bought it from obviously just arbitraged and went to Costco and bought the olive oil and sold it to me as a markup.

44
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,595
Rym: I'm pretty confident.

45
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:29,309
Rym: a lot of things I could buy on Amazon are just people doing that at Costco's.

46
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:39,741
Scott: Very, I've seen people, I've bought things on Amazon in the past, you know, maybe a handful of times, and gotten a Costco email, right?

47
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,166
Scott: Someone just went to Costco.com, bought it, and put in my address, right?

48
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:48,610
Scott: So, which I could start doing now, because if it wasn't clear- Whoa, so you actually got a membership.

49
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:57,643
Scott: Right, right, because I was like, you know, I'm like, it's 60 bucks for the cheap membership, you know, 120 for the, I'm not sure if it's actually a good deal, better membership, right?

50
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:02,010
Scott: And I'm like, you know, we'll try it, worst case, I'm out 60 bucks, right?

51
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:09,860
Scott: If we go in there, and we don't buy anything, then I'll just won't renew, and I'll be out 60 bucks, I've spent more on less in the past, right?

52
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:17,450
Scott: Um, and if it, somehow it's good, and we get a bunch of stuff, then good, I didn't waste my money, right?

53
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:28,245
Scott: It's like, um, so for the first time ever, we went and bought a membership, we went to the Costco, and I haven't, I have been in these kind of warehouse-y stores in the past, but not this millennia.

54
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:32,150
Scott: Lately, I'm doing a lot of things that I've done before, but not this millennia.

55
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,759
Rym: Yeah, that could be a good Thursday show, actually, that specific topic.

56
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:39,689
Rym: I'm in a similar boat for a lot of reasons, COVID being one of them.

57
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:42,429
Scott: Watch television, you know, things like that.

58
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:48,170
Rym: At night, you know, we've been doing them every now and then over dinner, watching, like, PBS, the news.

59
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:49,637
Scott: Ugh.

60
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,030
Rym: Yeah, weird.

61
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,114
Scott: Anyway, so I got some good things about Costco.

62
00:04:56,174 --> 00:05:06,710
Scott: Number one, we did indeed buy many things in there that I didn't expect that would be in there, and we saved a lot of money, and it was worth it from a commerce perspective, right?

63
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,941
Scott: Big box of fig bars, we got, like, electric toothbrush heads, those are real expensive, right?

64
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:17,370
Scott: And it was, it was expensive, it was like a pack of, like, a whole bunch for 50 bucks.

65
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,350
Rym: I go to your house, there's, like, a shipping container full of toothbrushes.

66
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,959
Scott: No, it was, like, one big package of, like, maybe 20-something, I'm not sure how many, but it was a lot, right?

67
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:31,990
Scott: For 50 bucks, which seems like a lot, but if you go online, like, three cost, like, 30 bucks, right?

68
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,495
Scott: So it was a huge savings, right, despite the high price.

69
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:39,100
Scott: The butter was the best deal, right?

70
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,010
Scott: It's like, if you go to the grocery store in New York City, and you buy butter, it's like, two sticks could be four or five dollars.

71
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,374
Scott: Four sticks could be, like, six, seven dollars, right?

72
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:54,641
Scott: I was able to get, not just any butter, the fancy Irish Kerrygold butter, right?

73
00:05:55,061 --> 00:06:01,890
Scott: It was a box, and the box contained eight butters, but they were double butters, two sticks worth each.

74
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,280
Scott: So, effectively, 16 butters, right?

75
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:08,570
Scott: For, like, $15.

76
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,270
Rym: That's too much butter to put in my fridge, unless I'm using it imminently.

77
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:18,346
Scott: But it's, like, it's basically, it was, like, buy three butters, get one free, which is 25% off.

78
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:19,490
Scott: butter is, like, a huge deal.

79
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,449
Rym: Well, it's keeping the fridge, like, it's not gonna go bad.

80
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,017
Scott: Yeah, and they weren't, it wasn't that large, physically, right?

81
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:29,008
Scott: It's, like, it's more butter than you would normally have in your fridge, but it wasn't, like, buying 24 rolls of TP.

82
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,190
Rym: You cram, like, two of those way in the back of the fridge, and you put two up front.

83
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,329
Scott: 56 rolls of TP against 24 wouldn't be that big.

84
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:34,599
Scott: Yeah.

85
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:35,673
Scott: So that was good.

86
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:40,670
Scott: There's also, people are correct, there are some services you can avail yourself of at Costco without a membership.

87
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:48,270
Rym: I was always told the best thing at Costco, I never verified this, this is based on, like, some guy saying this, but it was multiple some guys over the years.

88
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:52,508
Rym: If you go to a Costco that has a tire center, you buy car tires, and they're, like, nothing.

89
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,357
Scott: Our Costco does, indeed, have the tire center.

90
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:56,701
Scott: It has the food court.

91
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,490
Scott: It also has the liquor store, which, obviously, I don't drink.

92
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:03,290
Scott: But it's, if you want to buy liquor, you can go there without a membership.

93
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,790
Rym: They got various king and ducal peas of various qualities.

94
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,439
Scott: I mean, I'm sure it would be cheaper than normal if they had that in stock, right?

95
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:14,710
Scott: I mean, I think that's the downside of the Costco, is, like, there's no reliable inventory.

96
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,300
Scott: Like, you can't go there expecting something to be there.

97
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,770
Scott: It's, like, they got what they got right now, right?

98
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,009
Scott: You know, because that's what they've got.

99
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,210
Rym: Plus, booze is hard to shop discount for, unless you're an alcoholic, because, like, I like booze.

100
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,102
Scott: The quantities were large, but they had, the selection was large.

101
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:33,170
Scott: There's a whole separate place to buy booze.

102
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,584
Rym: I buy, like, a bottle of whiskey every seven to fifteen months.

103
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:40,570
Rym: Like, it's not like I drink this stuff that fast.

104
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:50,250
Scott: I mean, obviously, I would obviously tell someone never drink poison ever, but if you're gonna drink the poison, even me, a non-poisoned drinker, it's, like, it's probably a good deal.

105
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,698
Scott: All right, so it was the bad, the bad parts of the Costco, right?

106
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:58,470
Scott: The bad part was that, due to circumstances, right, we went there Saturday afternoon.

107
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:07,610
Rym: Oh, no, when I run past that place, part of the reason I run through that park, people are, like, blocking the sidewalk down the street trying to get into this place.

108
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,200
Scott: Well, I mean, we walked in with our little wagon.

109
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,830
Scott: We didn't use a car, so that wasn't a problem.

110
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:16,230
Scott: What was a problem is that the aisles in the store, at least the New York one, were too narrow.

111
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,275
Scott: They were, like, bare, two wagons.

112
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:19,841
Scott: Everyone uses the giant wagons there.

113
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:22,690
Scott: We were using our pole wagon that we brought, you know, our own wagon.

114
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:28,610
Scott: But the wagons that everyone uses are, they, basically, two of them can barely fit in an aisle.

115
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,304
Scott: So, if there's even one person who's not fully to the side of an aisle, the aisle's blocked.

116
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:34,529
Scott: It's, like, no one can go.

117
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:38,830
Scott: And if you try to turn around the ends of the aisles, it's, like, it's not any wider on the end cap.

118
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,481
Scott: It's just, like, it's really hard to move around that store.

119
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,949
Scott: I would recommend going at a different time.

120
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:49,720
Scott: But, yeah, I was, I was, I was expecting to have thrown away $60.

121
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,270
Scott: I was pleasantly surprised I didn't throw it away.

122
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:55,757
Scott: We'll see how many, I still might not renew.

123
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:59,330
Scott: It depends how many more times I go in a year, because, like, we stocked up.

124
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,754
Scott: Like, when am I going to need more butter now?

125
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:10,550
Scott: Maybe I won't need it again this year, in which case I'm not going to pay 60 bucks in order to get a discount on butter.

126
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:20,750
Scott: But, you know, it was, it was an experience, a novel experience, and there was some things they had there that I was surprised I wasn't expecting to see there.

127
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:25,289
Scott: Giant bag of pistachio nuts, you know, come on.

128
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:31,099
Rym: So, I was, of course, me and Emily were at PAX West the other weekend.

129
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,810
Rym: We're well out of the incubation period, so I guess we did, in fact, avoid COVID at it, and now I'm boosted.

130
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:37,650
Scott: So, uh, alright.

131
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:45,910
Scott: I got boosted yesterday at the Costco pharmacy, which is just as good as the Rite Aid pharmacy, only there's less slow people waiting in line.

132
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:46,949
Rym: Good to know.

133
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:51,350
Scott: I think you might be able to use that without a membership as well, I'm not sure.

134
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:58,330
Rym: Yeah, there's a bunch, depending on the state you're in, too, different states have rules where Costco's will have things that technically they have to let you use.

135
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:04,190
Scott: Yeah, but I went to it, and they did not check my membership card when I entered the store or at the pharmacy, so.

136
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:10,060
Rym: So, uh, PAX West was interesting because it was still a small PAX West.

137
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,526
Rym: It was not even close to sold out.

138
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:14,009
Rym: The scalpers were like...

139
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,270
Scott: Well, they were pushing hard on Twitter to sell tickets on the internet.

140
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,375
Rym: Oh, the dudes in the street?

141
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,570
Rym: There were still the same number of them as always was the crazy thing.

142
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,389
Rym: They were like...

143
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:28,450
Scott: They're probably there for every single, you know, public convention center event, and you'd probably go over to the stadiums during every sporting event.

144
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:34,130
Rym: At normal PAXes, pre-COVID, those dudes would be, like, selling them for, like, nearly what PAX sells them for.

145
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,430
Rym: Here, they would buy them from you for, like, ten bucks when you were leaving, because people leaving really didn't go back in.

146
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,896
Rym: People, of course, expo hall and bail.

147
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:43,710
Rym: And they were selling them back to people for, like, five bucks.

148
00:10:45,431 --> 00:10:45,558
Rym: So...

149
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,329
Scott: They were losing money on scalping?

150
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:56,470
Rym: No, they were buying them for five bucks, they were selling them to people for ten bucks, they were making basically, like, five dollar profit on each one of these badges, which isn't bad for nothing.

151
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:57,989
Rym: Just hanging out outside, I guess.

152
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:05,290
Scott: I mean, first of all, right, suddenly, right, everyone's mad at the scalpers when, you know, they're jacking up the price.

153
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:11,190
Scott: But look, here in this situation, right, you know, arguments that capitalism should be destroyed aside.

154
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,007
Rym: Right?

155
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:15,910
Rym: Just assume that's our Carthago de Lendem Est on any conversation.

156
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:24,830
Scott: Arbitrage suddenly becomes useful, right, when supply is high, like, "Oh, look, you don't have to pay fucking full price to go into the PAX, you know, that's perhaps sub-par.

157
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:27,310
Scott: The scalper is actually a good guy suddenly.

158
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:28,909
Rym: But I think there's a phenomenon...

159
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,845
Scott: Not to defend the scalper, right?

160
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,950
Scott: I'm just saying, again, the scalper is not the core problem.

161
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:37,370
Scott: Don't be mad at the scalper.

162
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,270
Rym: Very side effects.

163
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,410
Scott: Not the player, yes.

164
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:46,828
Rym: But what's interesting is that I think this is going to continue even after COVID, this trend, partly because what seems to be happening is...

165
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:49,069
Scott: I don't think there is an after COVID.

166
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,530
Rym: Well, as far as, like, as good as it gets and everything's as normal as it's ever going to be again...

167
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,509
Scott: It's like, we're not after flu right now.

168
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,590
Scott: It's like, there's going to be some sort of COVID forever.

169
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:06,710
Scott: We're just going to live, like, and deal with it, suffer, you know, just like we suffer with flu and everything else.

170
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:15,610
Rym: But I do think this is going to escalate incredibly because there's a lot... I feel like this PAX, almost everyone who was there was only there for expo haul.

171
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:23,970
Rym: Like, the ratio of expo only versus literally anything else was the starkest I've ever seen at any PAX ever by a wide margin.

172
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:27,430
Rym: Pretty much everyone came just on Saturday just for expo.

173
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:33,810
Rym: All the other days were mostly quiet and empty and all the non-expo areas were mostly quiet and empty.

174
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,290
Rym: Big panels, got giant crowds, of course, like big celebrity panels.

175
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,770
Rym: Uh, main events never filled despite...

176
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,950
Scott: Did you go to the Reggie panel?

177
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:42,320
Rym: Uh, no, I didn't.

178
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,250
Rym: We were busy with some other stuff.

179
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:44,389
Scott: That's a shame.

180
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,590
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was streamed, actually.

181
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:49,070
Scott: I'm sure I'll be able to see it if I really want to.

182
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,129
Scott: I don't know how good it is.

183
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,088
Scott: It just, you know, be in the same room as Reggie, be like, "Oh, there's that

184
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:53,269
Scott: guy.".

185
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,370
Rym: So it was a weird PAX in that they didn't have any of the external venues.

186
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,298
Rym: There was nothing in, uh...

187
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:05,370
Scott: Well, the external venues are for the... Oh, you mean the PAX-rented external venues.

188
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:13,130
Rym: Yeah, so there was... Main Theatre was actually just in the ballroom where normally Tabletop Expo is in the Hyatt Regency.

189
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,390
Rym: And that was the only PAX thing in that building.

190
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,630
Rym: Tabletop was just the entire top floor of the Seattle Convention Center.

191
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:23,830
Rym: I note it is no longer the Washington State Convention Center.

192
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:25,970
Rym: It is now the Seattle Convention Center.

193
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,650
Rym: The rules around it have changed.

194
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,670
Rym: They can bar the public from entry, which they did for this PAX.

195
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:32,029
Rym: They even closed the park.

196
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,470
Rym: The park behind the convention center was for PAX only.

197
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,268
Rym: You can only get to it from inside of PAX.

198
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:39,030
Scott: Do we know why this happened?

199
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:41,690
Rym: I don't know the full deal, so I'm not going to speculate.

200
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,889
Rym: But they renamed it, they rebranded it, there's signs everywhere about it.

201
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:50,630
Rym: And there's that other convention center space that they were talking about building.

202
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,310
Rym: It is very near completion and it is fucking gigantic.

203
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,709
Scott: Oh, the one that's where the buses used to be?

204
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,209
Rym: Holy shit, is it big.

205
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,090
Scott: Is that going to be the Washington State Convention Center?

206
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:02,909
Scott: Is that what the deal is?

207
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,195
Rym: I don't know.

208
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:04,090
Rym: I expect PAX...

209
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,309
Scott: Or is it all going to be one thing?

210
00:14:05,754 --> 00:14:06,147
Rym: I don't know.

211
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:13,630
Scott: I don't know any event that could even... The Paxist of peak PAX could probably not fill all of that.

212
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,950
Rym: Peak PAX could fill both of those if they stop using the higher regency for tabletop.

213
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,230
Rym: And just put tabletop in the convention.

214
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,970
Scott: Oh, if they stop using any other building whatsoever?

215
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:28,170
Rym: I bet they still use Benaroya for main events or Paramount for main events.

216
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,510
Rym: I think they'll keep doing that kind of stuff.

217
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:35,710
Rym: Apparently the only reason they didn't have them for this PAX was like, Hamilton was in one of them, like pre-arranged.

218
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,948
Rym: And something else was in the other one, like there was big stuff going on.

219
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:43,650
Scott: That reminds me, the Met Opera season starts soon.

220
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:47,110
Rym: Oh, maybe it's time to mask up and go to an opera.

221
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,229
Rym: But I digress.

222
00:14:49,010 --> 00:15:08,030
Rym: The PAX itself, tabletop, despite it being such a tiny PAX, on Saturday and also on Sunday during primetime hours, because tabletop was so tiny, being just the top floor of the SCC, it was completely full, there were no tables, there was nowhere to sit, it was crammed with people.

223
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:09,610
Rym: The other two days?

224
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,070
Scott: I thought you said the non-expo areas were not crowded.

225
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,276
Scott: Just tabletop.

226
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:15,410
Rym: Only tabletop freeplay.

227
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,330
Rym: Because tabletop freeplay was like a fifth of the tabletop space.

228
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,770
Rym: There was almost no tabletop freeplay space.

229
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:28,209
Rym: All the tabletop space was magic and tabletop tourney and tabletop expo.

230
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:29,969
Scott: Oh, alright.

231
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,350
Rym: So there were hardly any tables for freeplay.

232
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,387
Rym: Pretty much everyone was just freeplaying in hotels.

233
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,890
Scott: Freeplay is not a moneymaker.

234
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:41,750
Scott: Every room you make freeplay is a room that costs the convention money and doesn't bring in any revenue.

235
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:48,150
Rym: So when I say tabletop freeplay was full and you couldn't get a table, that's because there were only like 40 tables total.

236
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,693
Rym: Our panel got.

237
00:15:51,713 --> 00:15:54,810
Rym: a whole ton of people came to the panel, I think that went really well.

238
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,849
Rym: It was a pretty okay normal PAX.

239
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:16,230
Rym: However, and I want to preface this very much, I do not want to imply that I am saying anything that you might see like Fox News type dipshit people say, but Seattle did not recover well from the earlier days of the pandemic.

240
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:23,890
Rym: The entire area around the convention center in every direction is pretty fucking rough right now.

241
00:16:24,352 --> 00:16:25,848
Rym: A whole bunch of businesses just boarded up.

242
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,150
Rym: Lots of restaurants are gone, stores are gone.

243
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,430
Rym: The businesses that are open all had smash out windows everywhere.

244
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:39,150
Rym: The Bartels, the drugstore near the convention center, someone smashed the window out between Friday and Saturday.

245
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:45,850
Rym: Every store has guards wearing like fucking fake ass body armor standing outside their doors, acting like bouncers.

246
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:51,510
Rym: There are angry and altercation ready people all over the streets.

247
00:16:52,472 --> 00:16:56,730
Rym: I had several specific, honestly dangerous altercations.

248
00:16:57,732 --> 00:17:00,310
Rym: And there are fucking cops everywhere.

249
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:04,849
Rym: Like more cops than you see in Times Square, everywhere in Seattle.

250
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,569
Rym: It was just weird and rough.

251
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:14,006
Scott: Well, clearly the one thing you can take away from that is cops everywhere has not solved the problem, has it?

252
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:22,150
Scott: If cops are the solution and there's cops everywhere, why is it so rough?

253
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:23,848
Scott: That's the takeaway I have.

254
00:17:25,193 --> 00:17:34,210
Rym: This is a combination of the economy of a small city like Seattle not even being close to recovering at the rate that larger cities did.

255
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,488
Rym: Not that larger cities have recovered.

256
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,850
Scott: I think it's also like downtown Seattle, right?

257
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:46,650
Scott: Something like a pandemic will make you leave there.

258
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,889
Rym: Oh, it looks like that's happening.

259
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:49,656
Rym: I was looking around at rents.

260
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,689
Rym: Rents look like they're way down in downtown Seattle and people are just GTFOing.

261
00:17:55,051 --> 00:18:02,090
Scott: Right, it's not like New York where there's an extremely strong reason to live in New York City.

262
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:06,570
Scott: What's the benefit of living in downtown Seattle?

263
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,130
Scott: It's like you can walk to Pike Place Market as your grocery.

264
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:15,408
Rym: Emily's bosses live right above Pike Place, right in that area apparently, and they love it.

265
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:21,849
Rym: I think Seattle downtown is going the route of Hartford pretty fast.

266
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:29,890
Scott: Especially since Seattle actually does not the best job, far from as good a job as they should be doing.

267
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,030
Rym: There's so many asterisks we've got to put into this conversation.

268
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:39,730
Scott: Better than most places in terms of having a good public transport to downtown Seattle.

269
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:44,410
Scott: They got the light rail and the bus system is not complete garbage.

270
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:56,750
Scott: You can reasonably live outside of downtown Seattle in a different place, in a fancy suburb place, and get to downtown Seattle when you need to get there.

271
00:18:57,531 --> 00:19:04,690
Scott: Faster than someone living where we used to live takes the metro north to New York City, and the cost of living will be much lower.

272
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:08,004
Rym: There's also way more bike lanes, fantastically.

273
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:09,309
Rym: There's just bike lanes everywhere now.

274
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,870
Rym: But nobody fucking rides in them, and everyone's riding on the sidewalk anyway.

275
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,069
Scott: Well the hills are an issue.

276
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:22,150
Rym: Oh yeah, but despite the fact that there are bike lanes everywhere, every single person on a bike is on the sidewalk.

277
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:28,630
Rym: And those Lime electric scooters that were the bane of San Antonio were clogging up all of downtown Seattle.

278
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:34,189
Scott: I mean people can just go watch any of the, you know, not just bikes, YouTube or whatever, and learn why that is.

279
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:34,911
Rym: Yup.

280
00:19:35,452 --> 00:19:39,203
Rym: So it's like, I wouldn't have even talked about this.

281
00:19:39,503 --> 00:19:41,830
Rym: That's not the kind of thing I would mention, even visiting a city.

282
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,830
Rym: Because cities are all different and the world's kind of fucked and capitalism is a toxic cancer on the earth.

283
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:50,989
Rym: But it was honestly so bad that it stuck with me.

284
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:57,137
Rym: There's never been a place I have been and returned to.

285
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:03,509
Rym: that has gotten so radically different for the worse, so fast compared to Seattle in my entire life.

286
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:05,939
Scott: No, it wasn't that fast.

287
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,209
Scott: It was like three years, right?

288
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,129
Rym: Yeah, but three years and I go back and it's like a totally different city.

289
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:14,040
Rym: And Detroit actually got better when I went back.

290
00:20:14,361 --> 00:20:16,990
Rym: Most places I visited have gotten better or at least neutral.

291
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:18,885
Rym: But Seattle is just...

292
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,769
Scott: Fortunes rise and fall.

293
00:20:22,132 --> 00:20:22,614
Rym: Yup.

294
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:26,230
Rym: I think it'll be a challenge for PEX as this continues, too.

295
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,902
Rym: Because it was definitely causing issues and altercations around the convention center.

296
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,369
Rym: that I think will be more of a problem as time goes on.

297
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:38,410
Rym: Unless something radical changes in the entire American economy and government.

298
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,590
Scott: What'll it mean for that new giant convention center that they're building?

299
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,456
Rym: I don't know.

300
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:43,728
Rym: I think this can actually hurt.

301
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:48,870
Scott: Who's gonna want to run an event there if it's not a nice place to go, right?

302
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,904
Rym: I think it could actually hurt the usage of that convention center.

303
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,730
Rym: We'll see how it goes.

304
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,270
Rym: But it was rough to the point that it was actually notable.

305
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:07,690
Rym: In much lighter news, and I think the only real news we're gonna talk about in this segment today, the Nintendo Direct happened.

306
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,029
Rym: So we can at least cover all the important bits.

307
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,219
Scott: I thought it was gonna be at 1.

308
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,610
Scott: It was at 10 AM, at least our time.

309
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:14,073
Scott: I know!

310
00:21:14,154 --> 00:21:17,185
Rym: I had a note in my calendar, but it was one of those all-day notes.

311
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:18,330
Rym: I didn't really think about it.

312
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,210
Rym: So I got online to go to the Discord, like, "Alright, when's the Nintendo...".

313
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,819
Rym: "Oh, it's almost... Oh, fuck.

314
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:24,221
Rym: Okay.".

315
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:30,730
Scott: Anyway, most of the announcements were stuff nobody cares about, as usual.

316
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:31,318
Rym: Yup.

317
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,210
Scott: Notable announcements.

318
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:39,190
Scott: There's a remake of, I believe... I think it's the GameCube Kirby game, maybe?

319
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:41,082
Scott: It's a previous Kirby game.

320
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:42,090
Scott: It's getting an HD remake.

321
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:43,112
Rym: Oh, yeah.

322
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:44,927
Rym: Kirby's Return to Dreamland Deluxe.

323
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:46,572
Scott: Yup.

324
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:47,669
Scott: So that's one.

325
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,135
Rym: I'll probably play that.

326
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:50,689
Rym: I'd put it in these kinds of remakes.

327
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,730
Scott: I still didn't play the new, actually new Switch Kirby.

328
00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:00,530
Scott: So I don't know why I would go back and play this remake of an old one that I missed.

329
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:07,309
Rym: They announced, like, I saw a bunch of people in my timeline really excited about Octopath Traveler 2, which I guess...

330
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:13,890
Scott: I played the demo, and it's like I can understand why JRPG people are all over the Octopath Traveler.

331
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,570
Scott: Like, if I was a JRPG person, that would be the one.

332
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:17,329
Scott: Oh, absolutely.

333
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:18,426
Scott: I'm not.

334
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,043
Rym: Yup.

335
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,329
Rym: GoldenEye 007 with online play was actually a surprise to me.

336
00:22:26,271 --> 00:22:34,189
Scott: Right, so if you have Nintendo Switch online, you can play NES, SNES, Genesis, and N64 games on the Switch.

337
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:39,810
Scott: It's not a full library, but it's basically all of the S-tier titles, like most of them.

338
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,225
Scott: Yup.

339
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,830
Scott: But there are a bunch of N64 S-tier titles that were missing.

340
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,089
Scott: They just announced they're adding a significant portion of those.

341
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:56,217
Rym: GoldenEye, Pilotwings, Mario Party, Mario Party, Mario Party, Pokemon Stadium, Pokemon Stadium, 1080 Snowboarding, Excitebike 64.

342
00:22:56,217 --> 00:23:08,150
Rym: Yup, so... I'm honestly moderately excited to be able to play GoldenEye 007 online with the caveat that online play has never worked in any Nintendo game, and I don't trust that it'll work with GoldenEye.

343
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:11,049
Rym: I honestly do not think it'll work.

344
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:17,110
Rym: Like, maybe I'll be wrong, but they've been batting zero with those things working.

345
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,570
Scott: As long as you can play four people with Switches just sitting around, play GoldenEye against each other.

346
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:25,890
Scott: I could see that happening if there are enough people with Switches in the same place, right?

347
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,570
Scott: You don't need a TV, you don't need to... Remember, you used to have to set up, like, TVs and all that, right?

348
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:30,930
Scott: Yup.

349
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:38,470
Rym: Though I have found, in my experience with the Switch, doing local no-TV multiplayer across Switches also doesn't fucking work in most cases.

350
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:42,170
Scott: Local no-TV multiplayer, I guess.

351
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:50,290
Rym: Every time I've tried to do it with a Switch or a 3DS, it never actually worked, but I've only ever tried to do it at conventions where that stuff tends to not work anyway.

352
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:54,089
Rym: But conventions are the place I most often want to do exactly that, so...

353
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:03,210
Scott: Anyway, they announced, I predicted that there would be one of the second-tier first-party franchises that would get a new game announcement, and I was correct.

354
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,610
Scott: Pikmin, they announced Pikmin 4.

355
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,028
Rym: Yeah, moderately excited.

356
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:13,084
Scott: I played the demo of Pikmin 3, and I enjoyed it, but I wasn't like... It didn't make me want to buy and play the whole thing.

357
00:24:13,124 --> 00:24:13,870
Scott: It's just like, that's enough.

358
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,638
Rym: Yeah, I like it.

359
00:24:16,698 --> 00:24:18,970
Rym: Actually, I kind of want to go back and play the old Pikmins again.

360
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:20,250
Scott: Go ahead.

361
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:21,148
Rym: Yeah, maybe I should.

362
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:31,210
Rym: I don't know why people were mad that they didn't announce Breath of the Wild is coming out, or Breath of the Wild 2, because obviously it's coming out next year.

363
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,390
Rym: We've known this forever.

364
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,437
Rym: Yeah, they announced the date.

365
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,724
Rym: They did not announce.

366
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:36,910
Rym: it is coming out imminently.

367
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,802
Rym: All the people who kept saying, "Oh, they're going to announce it's a Christmas

368
00:24:39,822 --> 00:24:40,002
Rym: game.".

369
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:41,650
Rym: Of course it's not a Christmas game.

370
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,950
Rym: This is coming out in May 12th, next year, and that's fine.

371
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,890
Scott: That's around the time that most Zelda games have come out.

372
00:24:49,211 --> 00:24:50,134
Rym: Not a surprise.

373
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:54,007
Rym: Honestly, I'm just ignoring all news about Breath of the Wild 2.

374
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:54,970
Rym: I guess now we know the title.

375
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,353
Rym: Tears of the Kingdom.

376
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:00,604
Rym: Because it's just something I'm going to pre-order.

377
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:02,650
Rym: I'm going to play immediately when it comes out.

378
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,810
Rym: No words anyone says on the internet are going to change what I do when this game comes out.

379
00:25:08,732 --> 00:25:08,974
Scott: Yeah.

380
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:10,710
Scott: I don't even know why they need trailers.

381
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:15,910
Scott: They could just be like, you know, if I was Nintendo, right, I would pull a poll.

382
00:25:16,552 --> 00:25:19,130
Scott: They're already pretty secretive, right, but not Apple secretive.

383
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:22,830
Scott: But I would be like, I would just not say anything.

384
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,142
Rym: On May 11th, it would just be like, "Breath of the Wild 2 has a

385
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:26,383
Rym: date.".

386
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,675
Scott: Just on May 11th, put up a YouTube video.

387
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:38,290
Scott: that's a still black screen, and it just says the words like, you know, the Zelda logo appears.

388
00:25:38,793 --> 00:25:41,650
Scott: It could just be a solid white Zelda logo on a black background.

389
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,930
Scott: And then there's a link, there's a purchase, there's a purchase link, right?

390
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,270
Scott: A link to purchase link.

391
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:53,362
Scott: A link to purchase link, and then it says, "Available today, right now.

392
00:25:53,422 --> 00:25:53,823
Scott: Available

393
00:25:53,863 --> 00:25:54,004
Scott: now.".

394
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:58,030
Scott: Right, so there's no ambiguity on that.

395
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:03,330
Scott: I still think if I- And then anyone who goes to the eShop, it's just like right there at the top, like a full width banner.

396
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:04,622
Scott: Just like, "Click here for

397
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:05,067
Scott: Zelda.".

398
00:26:05,893 --> 00:26:08,710
Scott: No screenshots, no trailers, no nothing.

399
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,423
Scott: Just, "New, Zelda, click

400
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:10,907
Scott: here.".

401
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:18,930
Scott: It's like people who are really, you know, whatever, are gonna wait for a video game news site to buy it and post screenshots and YouTubes.

402
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,809
Scott: And some streamer will stream it right away, and then you'll see it.

403
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,110
Scott: But they don't waste money on any marketing content.

404
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,244
Scott: Just be like, "New Zelda's out

405
00:26:26,264 --> 00:26:26,508
Scott: today.".

406
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:33,070
Rym: I think there's only one company and one major game that ever has a chance of getting that treatment.

407
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:38,570
Rym: If there is ever a Half-Life 3, I feel like that's how they're gonna release it.

408
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,329
Rym: It's just one day is for sale.

409
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,269
Scott: Just like today, guys.

410
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,790
Scott: Just like, bam!

411
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:44,202
Scott: Half-Life 3, out.

412
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:49,429
Scott: If I were the product manager- On the Steam homepage is just the Half-Life logo and a Buy Now button.

413
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:56,770
Scott: If I were a product manager at Valve- Just put an orange lambda in a circle on a black background and an add to my library button.

414
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:02,290
Rym: I would stake my career on launching it like that being the best decision I could ever make.

415
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:04,009
Rym: And I am confident I would be right.

416
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,701
Scott: You don't gotta do nothing.

417
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:06,508
Scott: You don't gotta hype it.

418
00:27:07,871 --> 00:27:11,510
Scott: The hardest part would be keeping the Valve employees from spilling the beans ahead of time.

419
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,070
Rym: I mean, they all get buried with the first production disc in the tomb.

420
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:24,828
Scott: Thankfully, they've cried wolf so much, or at least reverse wolf cried, that even if Valve employees come out, they're like, "Half-Life 3 is coming,

421
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:25,230
Scott: everybody!".

422
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,207
Scott: People are like, "Tell me another

423
00:27:28,287 --> 00:27:28,468
Scott: one.".

424
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,658
Scott: It's like, "I work at Valve.

425
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,163
Scott: Sure you

426
00:27:30,203 --> 00:27:30,284
Scott: do.".

427
00:27:32,695 --> 00:27:34,010
Rym: And there's a few other things.

428
00:27:34,511 --> 00:27:37,130
Rym: Looks like there's a Harvest Moon remake coming.

429
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:44,690
Scott: There are a lot of farming games getting remade or new farming games coming, which tells me farming games must be making a lot of money.

430
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:45,870
Scott: People keep making them.

431
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:51,229
Rym: The Turbo Nerds, Fast Karate, if it was still producing podcasts, would be excited about this.

432
00:27:52,770 --> 00:28:00,549
Rym: The Fatal Frame that came out in Japan only on the Wii in the late 2000s is apparently coming out on the Switch in the US.

433
00:28:01,371 --> 00:28:05,450
Scott: They are doing a good job of getting the old missing Japanese titles out in the US.

434
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:20,750
Scott: Ever since, I think what must have happened is that the Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 2, 3, whatever, must have sold so that everyone caught on to that.

435
00:28:22,051 --> 00:28:24,770
Rym: And there's some other announcements, but honestly, we don't really play those kinds of games.

436
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,250
Rym: And if you play those games, you already know about these announcements.

437
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:30,290
Rym: Just go read a website to find out everything Nintendo announced.

438
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:36,370
Rym: I will say, though, I'm a tiny geek by now that I have played a bunch more of Cult of the Lamb.

439
00:28:37,371 --> 00:28:43,190
Rym: Yeah, it is just sloppy Hades, Binding of Isaac Melee.

440
00:28:43,873 --> 00:28:44,742
Rym: That is 90% of the gameplay.

441
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,590
Rym: Decide if that's what you want or not, if you are not already playing that game.

442
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:53,770
Scott: So if you're looking for more Animal Crossing, you should not buy Cult of the Lamb?

443
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:54,662
Scott: I would not.

444
00:28:54,723 --> 00:28:55,169
Rym: It is not.

445
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:55,970
Scott: Some other game?

446
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,810
Rym: Most of the gameplay is sloppy.

447
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:05,710
Rym: Take a sloppy port of Hades and mash it into the Binding of Isaac engine, or what feels like the Binding of Isaac engine.

448
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:08,110
Rym: That is the majority of the actual gameplay.

449
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,410
Scott: Oh, I guess two more.

450
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,861
Scott: There's the new Fire Emblem, and all the Fire Emblem.

451
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:14,430
Scott: people are, you know, raveling.

452
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:16,270
Scott: And I just haven't played a Fire Emblem in forever.

453
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:19,290
Rym: I can't tell if they're happy or mad about the new Fire Emblem.

454
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:21,902
Scott: There's so much mixed ravel.

455
00:29:21,942 --> 00:29:23,470
Scott: I can't tell what's going on in that scene.

456
00:29:23,852 --> 00:29:26,910
Scott: And then, lastly, The Fist of the North Star.

457
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,756
Scott: Oh, right!

458
00:29:27,796 --> 00:29:29,050
Rym: I almost forgot to talk about that.

459
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:35,250
Scott: It's not exactly the game that we played in the arcade with the six punching bags.

460
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,510
Rym: Because that game requires a full arcade machine with six physical things to punch.

461
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,850
Scott: It's effectively that game is coming out for the Switch.

462
00:29:44,212 --> 00:29:44,888
Scott: I might buy that.

463
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,620
Rym: Oh, I will absolutely buy that.

464
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,030
Rym: We're doing a fucking show on that.

465
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,030
Rym: That's gonna be great.

466
00:29:50,597 --> 00:29:51,108
Rym: Or it's gonna be bad.

467
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:52,770
Scott: That's not a game I can buy on PC either.

468
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:54,849
Rym: I am absolutely getting that game.

469
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:03,020
Rym: But, anyway, things of the day.

470
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:13,140
Rym: It is, despite the fact that it's like 85 degrees and humid outside, and it sounds like I saw rumblings that there's gonna be a New York heatwave, like, in October is predicted.

471
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:14,108
Scott: Oh, good.

472
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:14,660
Scott: I can go biking.

473
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,212
Rym: Oh, yeah.

474
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:23,360
Rym: But, because it's September, we have technically entered spooky season as far as I'm concerned.

475
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,980
Scott: We already bought some Halloween decorations at the dollar store.

476
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,424
Scott: Oh, yeah.

477
00:30:26,464 --> 00:30:28,020
Rym: It is already over the garden wall season.

478
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:41,350
Rym: So, my thing of the day is this is one of many channels that just gives you, like, one to two hour long compilations of music of a genre on YouTube of various provenance.

479
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:50,140
Rym: And this one is specifically an hour and a half of electro swing, nicely mixed together into an experience, my kind of jam.

480
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:55,300
Rym: But, it is specifically spooky electro swing.

481
00:30:56,401 --> 00:31:00,840
Rym: And, if you're a spookies fan or an electro swing fan, I think you will actually enjoy it.

482
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,520
Rym: I picked the 2021 one because it was a particularly good one.

483
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,512
Rym: It was much better than the 2021 from this channel.

484
00:31:10,155 --> 00:31:10,540
Rym: So, what do you got?

485
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:10,941
Scott: All right.

486
00:31:11,142 --> 00:31:15,480
Scott: So, recently, I did a thing of the day from a YouTube channel called Karen Puzzles.

487
00:31:15,721 --> 00:31:23,400
Scott: And Karen, the jigsaw puzzle YouTuber, bought a 24,000 piece puzzle and spent six YouTube videos putting it together.

488
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:32,540
Scott: Now, normally, I would never use the same YouTube channel again for another thing of the day, especially not so soon after already featuring that YouTube channel as a thing of the day.

489
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:42,100
Scott: But, Karen managed to succeed at making an exception for themselves, and they did a video so different from their other videos, right?

490
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:55,138
Scott: And, what they did is there was a live stream of the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championships, and they commentated it from their home on their own and edited that commentary together into two videos, right?

491
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:11,340
Scott: And, uploaded those two videos so you can experience spectating the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championships in a lot less than the many, many hours that it takes to watch the actual live stream, right?

492
00:32:12,204 --> 00:32:14,835
Scott: And, I learned a lot about the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship.

493
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:15,840
Scott: We may talk about it.

494
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,420
Scott: I think we're going to do a jigsaw puzzle episode eventually.

495
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,299
Rym: We spent like 20 minutes talking about this before we did the show.

496
00:32:24,462 --> 00:32:25,265
Scott: Yeah.

497
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:34,880
Scott: But, what I can say is that competition game-wise, the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championship, it has room for improvement, but it's actually not too bad, right?

498
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,467
Scott: It's a decent, competitive structure.

499
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:41,760
Scott: It looked like it had a friendly, high-quality environment.

500
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:49,754
Scott: And, I would be willing to go to it if it wasn't in Spain, and not because I don't want to go to Spain, because I don't want to go to Spain now.

501
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:52,379
Rym: That's fair.

502
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,739
Scott: I would love to go to Spain.

503
00:32:55,901 --> 00:33:01,060
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book, which I guess we'll do in October, because this is the last GeekNights for a while.

504
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,151
Scott: I have read, right?

505
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:03,019
Rym: Well, go on.

506
00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:04,908
Rym: Yeah, it's a short book.

507
00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:05,672
Rym: Scott has read it.

508
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:06,656
Rym: I have read it.

509
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:07,480
Rym: It is great.

510
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:14,960
Rym: Just don't have time to do a show on it, because GeekNights is going to be on a three-fucking-week hiatus.

511
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,979
Scott: Thursday night, I'm going to- The book is what?

512
00:33:18,782 --> 00:33:18,931
Rym: Binti.

513
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,340
Scott: Alright, so I just want to clarify that you have chosen only the first book as your book club book?

514
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:24,938
Scott: You read all three?

515
00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:26,398
Scott: I read all three.

516
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:27,578
Rym: I'll read the other two.

517
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,980
Scott: They were, like, people said these were short.

518
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:33,339
Rym: I told you, one setting for both had most.

519
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:38,360
Scott: Each one of them took me maybe an hour, so it's like three hours for the whole trilogy.

520
00:33:39,221 --> 00:33:40,468
Scott: I feel like we got a retcon.

521
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:42,320
Scott: How many people are really reading it anyway, right?

522
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,120
Scott: I feel like you got to retcon and make the trilogy the book club book.

523
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:45,929
Rym: I think I can do that.

524
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,880
Rym: We can talk about all three.

525
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,005
Scott: It's your book club book.

526
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:50,359
Scott: I can't force that upon you, but you know.

527
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:52,040
Rym: I think I will do it.

528
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,920
Scott: It takes three hours, maybe three to four hours to read all three.

529
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:07,780
Rym: Well, especially because we were extending the deadline, because like I said, the big meta news is where I'm going to be biking 500 miles from our apartment to Emily's parents' house way upstate, like an hour away from Buffalo.

530
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,556
Scott: Not in one shot, though.

531
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,659
Rym: Over the course of seven days, starting Friday when the sun comes up.

532
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,045
Scott: Very reasonable.

533
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:15,791
Scott: Not in one day.

534
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,800
Rym: No, I would die.

535
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,931
Rym: We're doing 100 miles the first day, and every day after.

536
00:34:21,972 --> 00:34:23,900
Rym: that is way easier than the first day.

537
00:34:24,702 --> 00:34:32,820
Scott: There was a guy I met at a family function who might, you know, he might be old man Scott.

538
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,190
Scott: He has like a Mets tattoo.

539
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:37,340
Scott: He's like an old biking man.

540
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:43,420
Scott: But he said that he biked a length of New Jersey 200 miles in one shot.

541
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:45,378
Scott: And I'm like, all right, he's more biking than I am.

542
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:46,446
Scott: Yeah.

543
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:48,018
Rym: And he's way older than I am.

544
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,000
Rym: I can reliably bike 80 miles with zero discomfort whatsoever.

545
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:55,873
Rym: I'm just living my best life the whole time, averaging like 12 to 15 miles an hour.

546
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,059
Scott: Depends on the terrain.

547
00:34:58,762 --> 00:34:58,924
Rym: Yep.

548
00:34:58,964 --> 00:34:59,711
Rym: I mean, not 80 miles.

549
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,017
Scott: Depends on how many people I got with me.

550
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:02,575
Rym: Yep.

551
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:03,620
Scott: Depends on the weather.

552
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:10,160
Rym: But 100 miles, usually the last 10 or 20 miles are still type two fun.

553
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,798
Rym: Like it's fun, but it's not as fun as the first 80 miles.

554
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,360
Rym: Like that is when Rims old man body starts to say, you need a break before you do another 100 miles, buddy.

555
00:35:19,664 --> 00:35:20,679
Rym: So this should be a good time.

556
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,620
Rym: And then I am immediately flying to London for a week for a work trip.

557
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,680
Rym: And then I'm flying to Frankfurt for a week for a work trip.

558
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,197
Rym: So I ain't going to be back in the United States or back to do GeekNights until like the week of October 10th.

559
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:38,160
Scott: No royal shit is going to interfere with your plans?

560
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:48,189
Rym: Actually, the royal shit has fucked up a bunch of other people's plans because there's now an ad hoc holiday on like the Monday, I guess, that a bunch of people are traveling for some stuff.

561
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:51,640
Rym: that's semi-related to why I'm going there, but that doesn't affect me.

562
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:57,356
Rym: But I booked my trip looking at the US calendar and the London calendar.

563
00:35:57,396 --> 00:35:58,580
Rym: I didn't look at the German calendar.

564
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,839
Rym: So I'm going to be in London for a week and then I fly to Frankfurt for a week.

565
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:06,760
Rym: But there's a German holiday and our office is closed on that Monday.

566
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,600
Rym: So I hope no co-workers are listening to this.

567
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,680
Rym: I'm just going to hang out in Frankfurt on Monday and I get a vacation.

568
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,212
Scott: Wait, I'm looking at my actual calendar.

569
00:36:18,372 --> 00:36:20,780
Scott: Is this an Oktoberfest related holiday?

570
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:23,264
Rym: We'll see what happens.

571
00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:27,380
Rym: We'll see what photos I post to Twitter in Frankfurt.

572
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:29,451
Scott: Many pretzel emojis appearing.

573
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:30,478
Scott: Pretzel sausage emojis.

574
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:41,580
Rym: What I'll say is the one thing to know if you go to Germany, especially if you were in Bavaria, because I fucked this up the first time I went to Munich.

575
00:36:42,021 --> 00:36:48,780
Rym: If you go to a restaurant and they just bring out a bunch of bread or a bunch of pretzels, don't fucking eat them.

576
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,971
Rym: They're like a euro each.

577
00:36:51,535 --> 00:36:52,360
Rym: They are not free.

578
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:52,837
Scott: I'd eat one.

579
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,064
Rym: Yeah, they will not.

580
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,440
Rym: At least know that they are not free when they bring you those pretzels.

581
00:36:57,741 --> 00:36:59,894
Rym: They are bringing them out and you are not.

582
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:00,779
Rym: Don't eat them all.

583
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,820
Scott: I probably couldn't even eat the whole pretzel anyway, right?

584
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,145
Scott: They were kind of small.

585
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:05,733
Rym: They brought a bread basket.

586
00:37:05,894 --> 00:37:07,020
Rym: I ate the whole bread basket.

587
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:13,158
Rym: The guy came back later and was like, "Yeah, you owe me like 23 euros for that entire fucking basket of bread you

588
00:37:13,238 --> 00:37:13,379
Rym: ate.".

589
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:14,558
Scott: Was it worth it?

590
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:15,720
Rym: Yeah.

591
00:37:18,764 --> 00:37:20,907
Rym: Oh, and last but not least, the panel.

592
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:27,660
Rym: I promise there was a new version of that losing panel and it was a radically redone version of that panel.

593
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:29,300
Rym: It is a completely different talk.

594
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,440
Scott: I haven't watched it, so I can't say it, but I wager that it's not.

595
00:37:33,881 --> 00:37:40,720
Rym: It actually is because the original panel, the first half was single player games, the second half was multiplayer games.

596
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,199
Rym: Barely talked about role playing games.

597
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,540
Rym: This one, the first half is a rewritten single player games.

598
00:37:45,922 --> 00:37:47,500
Rym: The second half is tabletop RPGs.

599
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:53,720
Rym: We don't talk about multiplayer at all and I tell everyone to go watch the other video, but I'm not going to change anything.

600
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,446
Rym: That video is perfect.

601
00:37:54,568 --> 00:37:55,800
Rym: where we talked about multiplayer games.

602
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,726
Rym: Losing is on YouTube in its entirety.

603
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:05,800
Rym: Me and Emily doing the panel with a link to all the slides and every reference we made.

604
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,399
Rym: All the other panels and videos we talked about are all just there.

605
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,302
Rym: Go watch it.

606
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:10,065
Rym: It was a really good time.

607
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:13,400
Rym: We had a good audience and we ended with five minutes to spare.

608
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,700
Rym: We took a question from the audience and I followed my rule.

609
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:35,680
Rym: I called on the first non-male, non-white appearing person who raised their hand and not only did they ask a fantastic question, but they are already a GeekNights fan and they came to the panel specifically because they wanted to ask us this question that was relevant to this panel at a previous panel we did at PAX West before COVID.

610
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:40,180
Scott: I guess I'll go and skip to the end and listen to this question.

611
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,560
Scott: That was a pretty good question.

612
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,260
Scott: That has been cheesed.

613
00:38:43,185 --> 00:38:44,080
Scott: A cheesed question.

614
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:51,800
Rym: Listener, I did not catch your name and because of COVID protocols, the enforcers of course shooed almost everyone out of the room so we couldn't interact too much.

615
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,569
Rym: So if you're listening to this, email us.

616
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,860
Rym: I will happily answer your question in more detail via email.

617
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,079
Scott: Okay, we can finally get to the main bit.

618
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:03,520
Rym: Finally get to the main bit.

619
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:16,239
Rym: This is something that I spent a lot of time thinking about in middle school and high school because you kids don't realize what it was like to try to play games.

620
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:23,900
Rym: In this case, we're pretty much only talking about PC games, like multiplayer PC games for the most part.

621
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:40,600
Rym: If you wanted to play Quake or Doom or any one of those games like Command & Conquer against someone else, you had to know like the phone number of a special service to dial, the actual direct IP address of a specific server that someone was running.

622
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:41,912
Rym: How were they running it?

623
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:42,540
Rym: Magic.

624
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:46,360
Rym: I didn't know how to run a server until like late high school.

625
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:53,440
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, the way that I played multiplayer PC games was of course local, right?

626
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,375
Scott: Whether you're sitting at the same computer with two input devices or a LAN.

627
00:39:59,221 --> 00:40:04,620
Scott: All the computers are just plugged into the same hub and you connect that way using IPX or something.

628
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:07,488
Scott: And then you've got the dial up.

629
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:10,260
Scott: One person opens up their modem, the other person dials the modem.

630
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,414
Scott: You call it, you're effectively just making a phone call and then playing.

631
00:40:13,434 --> 00:40:14,640
Scott: I've done that method.

632
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:19,718
Scott: But yeah, because, you know, we don't have IPv6 really, right?

633
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,394
Scott: It's like you could, you know, go to like open up Half-Life back in the 90s or early 2000s and be like click new game.

634
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:31,760
Scott: And then that would sort of create a server and run the game locally.

635
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:36,239
Scott: And then someone else could try to find your game either in the game list or typing in your IP.

636
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:42,820
Rym: Good luck actually making that work the way people's houses and internet actually worked at the time.

637
00:40:43,503 --> 00:40:52,900
Scott: Yeah, especially so your computer, even if you could get the networking part to work, your computer had to run the server and the game for you, the client for you at the same time.

638
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,779
Scott: So you needed a very powerful computer for this to be a good experience.

639
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,620
Scott: Oh my god, remember in RIT?

640
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,280
Scott: Especially if there were more than just a few players, right?

641
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:11,100
Rym: Remember in RIT when we were playing Ricochet locally with IPX and our neighbors like bullshit firewall detected it and they called campus safety on us claiming we were hacking them?

642
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:12,281
Scott: Yeah.

643
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:20,220
Scott: Anyway, so what happened is you basically had to just run a game server.

644
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:27,440
Scott: You would get a computer that was dedicated to doing nothing else, but running the game server, the computer would have a publicly accessible IP address.

645
00:41:28,103 --> 00:41:30,599
Scott: And now everybody who wanted to play could connect to the server.

646
00:41:31,043 --> 00:41:33,060
Scott: Their local computer would only have to run the client.

647
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:43,160
Scott: And as long as your network connection to the server was solid and low latency enough, 100 or less usually, hopefully even less than that, maybe less than 50 if you're really good.

648
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,439
Scott: A single digit if you're in college, right?

649
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:48,618
Rym: A single digit for me in high school for reasons I'll get into.

650
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:57,538
Scott: But anyway, then multiplayer PC gaming became a good, decent experience in the early 2000s, late 90s.

651
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:00,260
Rym: Now it was a fascinating time.

652
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:07,560
Rym: I think we'll start by talking about what it was like to be a player and then we can talk about what it was like and the challenges of actually running a server.

653
00:42:08,023 --> 00:42:10,460
Rym: And then what sort of killed this and what the current state of things are.

654
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:15,920
Rym: Because those are the three main interesting topics here that don't overlap other GeekNights episodes we've already done.

655
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:22,260
Rym: As a player, you got to understand, this was already a rarefied experience.

656
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:36,900
Rym: The tiniest percentage of people who even had access to a computer that could play a game like Quake had the ability, knowledge, and community to play it online with significant numbers of other people.

657
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:40,280
Rym: That was already very rare for most people.

658
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:46,000
Scott: It might be common if you go to, say, a nerdy college, everyone's playing Counter-Strike in every room.

659
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,940
Scott: But worldwide, almost nobody.

660
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,660
Rym: And even most college kids, when we were in high school, not a lot of colleges even had this stuff set up.

661
00:42:56,609 --> 00:42:57,399
Scott: Only the nerdy ones.

662
00:42:57,861 --> 00:43:01,820
Rym: RIT was notable in that it had a, for real, campus network that worked.

663
00:43:02,561 --> 00:43:06,100
Scott: And even if the college wasn't nerdy, there might be a nerdy section of the college.

664
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,793
Scott: Like just the people in the CS department, but no one else.

665
00:43:08,974 --> 00:43:10,200
Scott: The whole rest of the college wasn't in it.

666
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,540
Rym: So in high school, like skipping modems, because that's a little dicey.

667
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,560
Rym: If I wanted to play Quake online on a server.

668
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:22,420
Rym: One, I had to know a community of people online who lived pretty close to me.

669
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,300
Rym: Like they had to live in Southeast Michigan or it wouldn't work.

670
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,939
Rym: Internet was a lot slower back then.

671
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,240
Rym: Like so much slower and so much higher latency.

672
00:43:30,701 --> 00:43:32,960
Rym: Whatever you think it was like, you were wrong.

673
00:43:33,061 --> 00:43:34,359
Rym: Unless you were as old as us or older.

674
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:42,760
Rym: So I had to just somehow know like a bunch of people who lived in Southeast Michigan who all played Quake.

675
00:43:43,403 --> 00:43:44,700
Rym: All had similar sensibilities.

676
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:55,140
Rym: And knew someone in our collective circles who had the arcane knowledge to run a public Quake server with a real IP address.

677
00:43:55,742 --> 00:44:00,800
Rym: So it was some rich white kid usually running a server on like dedicated hardware.

678
00:44:01,423 --> 00:44:05,600
Rym: And the local community of people playing one specific game.

679
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:11,920
Rym: And only that game would find each other on BBS's and web-based forums and bulletin boards.

680
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:18,020
Rym: I spent a lot of time in IRC just watching for is anyone playing Quake?

681
00:44:18,361 --> 00:44:25,840
Rym: Because if anyone I know is playing Quake, they would post in IRC the IP address or often just the name of the server they were on.

682
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,720
Rym: Because some of the servers were kind of exclusive.

683
00:44:29,261 --> 00:44:35,160
Rym: Like Bunnies was a place I would play where it was only chill cool people and people tried to win.

684
00:44:35,942 --> 00:44:41,021
Rym: And it had like a 20 millisecond ping even in 1997.

685
00:44:41,021 --> 00:44:46,420
Scott: And the thing is, you know, not all of the servers, right?

686
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,580
Scott: It's not like today where you can just get a server list, right?

687
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:52,215
Scott: It's like, ah, here are all the Quake servers, right?

688
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:53,000
Scott: Let me choose one.

689
00:44:53,241 --> 00:44:55,900
Scott: It's like back in those days, there wasn't a server list.

690
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:57,458
Scott: It was type in the IP here.

691
00:44:58,301 --> 00:45:01,840
Scott: There might have been some other software that was separate that you could use.

692
00:45:04,046 --> 00:45:08,880
Scott: It might list servers, but people had to add their servers to those lists on purpose, right?

693
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:17,200
Scott: If someone wasn't advertising to the world that they have a server at an IP address, finding it was going to be very, very difficult.

694
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:23,440
Rym: But even worse, the more well known the IP address was of a server, the more dipshits were there.

695
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,920
Rym: And the more popular it was, you try to log in, it's full.

696
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:32,020
Rym: I spent a lot of time, literally, I would just sit there at my computer, like looking at the internet.

697
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:38,160
Rym: Well, I had Quake open constantly trying to connect to the IP address of a good server because it was full.

698
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,212
Scott: Because as soon as someone quits, there's a spot open.

699
00:45:41,232 --> 00:45:43,280
Scott: It's first come, first served digitally.

700
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,959
Scott: If you can get that spot, you're in.

701
00:45:45,801 --> 00:45:48,834
Rym: And generally, if the server was full, that's a hopping server.

702
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:50,260
Rym: You definitely want to be there.

703
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:52,240
Rym: If a server lets you in right away, it's usually empty.

704
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:59,940
Scott: Sure, you could join a server that's got two people playing and hope that maybe there's a lot of people who are currently refreshing and trying to join the full server.

705
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:04,379
Scott: And if they see the server with two people go to three and four, they might go to that one.

706
00:46:05,121 --> 00:46:06,900
Scott: And this only works, though, when there's a server listing.

707
00:46:08,486 --> 00:46:10,364
Scott: But the more public servers... Sometimes it doesn't happen.

708
00:46:10,384 --> 00:46:13,560
Scott: Sometimes you go to the server with two people and no one comes and it's like, god damn it.

709
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:19,400
Rym: So there were a bunch of Quake 1 and Quake 2 servers running various mods and some of them were vanilla in my area.

710
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:27,080
Rym: But most of them, there were people there, but they were bad people, they were griefers and trolls and cheaters and all this crap.

711
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:36,640
Rym: So separately, there was a list of servers that I knew about and the people I knew knew about from private IRC that weren't listed on all those websites.

712
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:39,719
Rym: And those were the cool places where chill people would hang out.

713
00:46:41,661 --> 00:46:46,620
Scott: But it was harder for those ones to have enough people to be playing.

714
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,599
Scott: It was more rare that you would go there and actually get a good game going on.

715
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,400
Scott: Because it's not open to the public with lots of players coming all the time.

716
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:53,962
Scott: Except Bunnies.

717
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:58,880
Rym: Bunnies was pretty much full 24/7 because that was the best server in Southeast Michigan.

718
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:02,952
Rym: And you had to... Bunny had to talk to you to vet.

719
00:47:02,992 --> 00:47:05,159
Rym: you were a chill person before they'd even tell you the IP.

720
00:47:06,081 --> 00:47:10,840
Rym: And I was password protected and that was where I spent a lot of time playing Quake games back in the day.

721
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:18,194
Rym: But you were 100% at the mercy of whoever out there ran the server.

722
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:21,140
Rym: They were the dictator god as far as you were concerned.

723
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,700
Scott: Yep, and the person running the server can do all sorts of nonsense.

724
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,340
Scott: They can kick you, they can ban you, at least ban your IP based on what system it was.

725
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,631
Scott: When Steam came around, they could ban your Steam ID.

726
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:33,360
Scott: You need to get a whole new Steam account.

727
00:47:34,501 --> 00:47:36,049
Scott: They could change the rules on the server.

728
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,215
Scott: They could change the gravity.

729
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:38,160
Scott: They could change the map.

730
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,369
Scott: They could change fucking anything.

731
00:47:40,489 --> 00:47:42,600
Scott: Anything that was a Quake variable, right?

732
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,380
Rym: I had three different versions of Weapons Factory, a mod for Quake 2 installed.

733
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,800
Rym: Because all the different servers I connected to were all running different versions of the mod that were mutually incompatible.

734
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,344
Scott: Yeah, they could cheat.

735
00:47:55,354 --> 00:47:56,500
Scott: They could do whatever the hell they wanted.

736
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,510
Scott: They ran the server.

737
00:47:57,732 --> 00:47:58,460
Scott: They were in charge.

738
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,950
Scott: The people who made the game have no say.

739
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:01,360
Scott: The people playing the game have no say.

740
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:07,260
Scott: The person running the server is like a GM in old school D&D where they just do whatever they want.

741
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,048
Scott: And that was, in some ways, good.

742
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:11,720
Scott: And in some ways, not good.

743
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,399
Rym: Yep, like you talk about today, like, "Oh, without matchmaking, gaming

744
00:48:15,419 --> 00:48:15,520
Rym: sucks.".

745
00:48:16,442 --> 00:48:19,100
Rym: This is so far beyond without matchmaking.

746
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:20,379
Scott: Yeah, right?

747
00:48:22,022 --> 00:48:22,907
Rym: And I had a lot of fun.

748
00:48:22,927 --> 00:48:25,180
Rym: And it was a really interesting time.

749
00:48:25,581 --> 00:48:27,653
Rym: But those days also sucked.

750
00:48:27,894 --> 00:48:36,099
Rym: They were a giant pain in the... I had a notepad file that was the list of, like, the specific servers I could play each game I cared about on.

751
00:48:36,921 --> 00:48:37,333
Rym: And that was it.

752
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:38,602
Scott: Yep.

753
00:48:39,707 --> 00:48:42,940
Scott: So, as time went on, right, things progressed a bit, right?

754
00:48:43,161 --> 00:48:45,699
Scott: The "run your own server" got a little bit easier.

755
00:48:48,203 --> 00:48:50,759
Scott: Some normal people could do it or just pay someone else to do it.

756
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,020
Rym: Freshman year of RIT, I ran a Counter-Strike server, a really crappy one, from my dorm room.

757
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:00,618
Rym: And then Scott and I ran a much better one from our colony apartment.

758
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,980
Scott: When I bought a new computer, the old computer ran the IcyWorld server.

759
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,233
Scott: Yep, we ran an FYI.

760
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:11,400
Scott: It wasn't a strong enough computer to run, like, Dust 2 or whatever, but IcyWorld is a tiny map, so it worked.

761
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:11,740
Rym: Yep.

762
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,695
Rym: We limited it to, what, like eight or ten players, I think.

763
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:15,720
Rym: Otherwise it would lay out.

764
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,480
Scott: Yeah, IcyWorld doesn't need that many players, right?

765
00:49:17,522 --> 00:49:17,798
Scott: Exactly.

766
00:49:18,802 --> 00:49:19,679
Scott: Per team, per team.

767
00:49:20,222 --> 00:49:23,940
Rym: I spent a lot of time playing on our dumpy little IcyWorld server at RIT.

768
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:24,657
Scott: Yeah, me too.

769
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:27,499
Rym: What I was very happy about is, it was always bumping.

770
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:29,932
Rym: There were always people there, even if we weren't using it.

771
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,119
Rym: I was very happy about that.

772
00:49:32,461 --> 00:49:35,520
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, running your own server got easier.

773
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:40,580
Scott: There was the server listings that were run by the game developers, right, so it's easy to find games.

774
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,360
Scott: You know, the anti-cheat technology came into play.

775
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,320
Scott: There was already, like, existing anti-cheat, like Punkbuster, if anyone remembers that.

776
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:54,640
Rym: Oh my god, I was not cool with Punkbuster until people were cheating so much.

777
00:49:55,023 --> 00:49:56,940
Rym: That I was willing to accept that malware.

778
00:49:57,741 --> 00:50:04,739
Scott: Yeah, then Valve came out with that VAC, right, which was much better, but not perfect anti-cheat, right?

779
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:08,580
Scott: But yeah, you know, it was okay times, right?

780
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:14,740
Scott: It was, they eliminated some of the problems of the old day, but you still had the fundamental same situation, right?

781
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,720
Scott: Where a server is run by a person, that person is in charge.

782
00:50:19,261 --> 00:50:26,900
Scott: Every, you know, there aren't really, some of the games, their company might run a few servers of their own, just to create, like, a baseline.

783
00:50:27,422 --> 00:50:30,440
Scott: But people rarely played on those very much, right?

784
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:36,780
Rym: And the cool part about that era, all those eras, was in the early days, they were just dictators.

785
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:49,220
Rym: But that brief period where the ease of running a server expanded, we saw a lot of servers where people set up really fun and clever stuff.

786
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:56,400
Rym: That sort of threw gasoline on the existing mod scene, and people were doing really interesting things.

787
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:04,580
Rym: Some servers would have completely different rulesets, like, people were experimenting, whole communities would, like, form around weird servers.

788
00:51:05,182 --> 00:51:09,340
Rym: It was, honestly, a really fun time to be alive in terms of gaming, because you gotta wait for the-.

789
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,958
Scott: Yeah, not all of those mods and customizations were, like, good as games.

790
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,780
Rym: Oh, most of them were absolute dogshit, don't get us wrong.

791
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,740
Scott: Right, but it was still, like, a flourishing period of creativity and excitement and all sorts of, you know, there were lots of options.

792
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:28,120
Scott: And you'd be surprised, like, what random Half-Life mod you could turn on and actually find players, right?

793
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,567
Scott: It's like, Natural Selection.

794
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:31,235
Scott: 1 was a Half-Life 1 mod.

795
00:51:31,476 --> 00:51:32,180
Scott: That's what it was.

796
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:40,020
Scott: It wasn't a new game, you know, it's like, it was a Half-Life 1 mod, and if it wasn't for the ability to run your own server, it's like, it wouldn't have been possible.

797
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:41,639
Scott: It never happened.

798
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:52,780
Rym: So, it went from an era of a very small number of nerds with money and arcane knowledge could run these, to almost any nerd who cared could run this, like, it was pretty easy.

799
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:56,850
Rym: But then, the server world, like, kind of went away.

800
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:00,920
Rym: Like, in the modern era, very few people run their own servers.

801
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:10,060
Rym: They're almost entirely reliant on the company that released the game will let people spawn games, but not necessarily dedicated servers.

802
00:52:10,241 --> 00:52:12,487
Rym: A lot of these companies will let you customize.

803
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:16,940
Rym: Some games let you customize to extreme extents, like Overwatch.

804
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:22,139
Rym: If you spawn a custom game, you can put some ridiculous mods in there.

805
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,460
Scott: Right, but you can't make up your own mod, you can just choose from the mods that they're providing.

806
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,999
Scott: It could be an extensive list.

807
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,760
Rym: But you can also tune every parameter, you can import objects, there's a lot of customization.

808
00:52:32,821 --> 00:52:33,911
Scott: You can't write code, though.

809
00:52:33,931 --> 00:52:34,759
Scott: There's a line.

810
00:52:35,923 --> 00:52:39,320
Rym: You can get close to writing code with some of the modding capabilities.

811
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,979
Scott: You couldn't make something like Natural Selection 1 Overwatch.

812
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,546
Scott: You could not.

813
00:52:42,213 --> 00:52:42,779
Scott: Absolutely not.

814
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,448
Scott: You could make another game.

815
00:52:43,489 --> 00:52:44,240
Scott: that's not Overwatch.

816
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:47,940
Rym: Yeah, but if we just focus on the server aspect of it...

817
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,658
Scott: You couldn't add some character that didn't exist.

818
00:52:51,241 --> 00:52:58,280
Rym: I don't think the fact that companies went this way is what killed people running their own dedicated servers.

819
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:07,680
Rym: What killed it is the fact that the fatal flaw of all dedicated servers was that without matchmaking, you had to do manual matchmaking.

820
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:17,280
Rym: Unless you played on servers where the people who played were all roughly your same skill level, gaming sucked.

821
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,080
Rym: You were either better than everyone else or you died instantly every game no matter what.

822
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,407
Rym: And that was it.

823
00:53:22,508 --> 00:53:23,500
Rym: There was zero middle ground.

824
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:31,420
Scott: Because a lot of these games were skill-based, high skill cap games, if there were other games... That's also a consequence of the game itself.

825
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:36,360
Scott: If you had been playing with a server of some other game that wasn't a high skill game, that wouldn't have happened.

826
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:40,659
Scott: But you were playing Counter-Strike or Quake, so that was definitely what was going on.

827
00:53:41,061 --> 00:53:47,920
Rym: But most games that had dedicated server technology were competitive first person shooter ortho games.

828
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:48,424
Scott: Of course.

829
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:49,318
Scott: Of course.

830
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,518
Rym: Because most other games...

831
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:55,940
Scott: Who's going to go through the effort to do all that for, I don't know, for Candyland?

832
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:01,500
Rym: And other games like Civilization and stuff like that really didn't have multiplayer capabilities.

833
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,239
Scott: They did play by mail.

834
00:54:03,604 --> 00:54:03,900
Scott: Exactly.

835
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:05,071
Scott: You couldn't even run a server.

836
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:19,560
Rym: FPSs really were the emergence of that concept for most people of run a dedicated server, curate a community around it, and that is the place you play this game with your friends and your extended community.

837
00:54:20,241 --> 00:54:22,039
Rym: Nowadays, you do that via friends lists.

838
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,760
Scott: So companies started running the servers themselves, and this had some pluses and minuses.

839
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:27,522
Scott: We already talked about.

840
00:54:27,622 --> 00:54:31,800
Scott: one minus is the lack of the flourishing creativity of the mods and all that.

841
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:32,858
Scott: But here's the plus.

842
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:34,190
Rym: Quake 1 today, we want to play.

843
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,840
Rym: I right click on all my friends' names in Quake.

844
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:39,298
Scott: And it works.

845
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,299
Rym: It just works.

846
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,480
Rym: A server appears, my friends are in it.

847
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:42,820
Scott: It works great.

848
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:43,878
Rym: Nobody else is in it.

849
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,675
Rym: Everyone has the same version.

850
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,336
Scott: No one has to go and update their...

851
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:47,936
Rym: Yup.

852
00:54:48,442 --> 00:54:48,920
Rym: I make it public.

853
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,297
Scott: No one gets a message like, "Oh, the server's got a newer version than you do, or an older

854
00:54:52,337 --> 00:54:52,679
Scott: version.".

855
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,220
Rym: Random people do just join and play with us, and it's totally fun.

856
00:55:00,085 --> 00:55:02,940
Scott: Some of those games, you still can get your own maps in there, right?

857
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:03,719
Scott: To an extent.

858
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:04,110
Scott: Yup.

859
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,355
Scott: Things like that.

860
00:55:06,602 --> 00:55:08,979
Scott: But the other players have to have the maps for it to work.

861
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:23,860
Rym: But I guess it's a nuanced space, because it is true that we have lost some of the power and control and modability of servers and the unique aspects of running dedicated servers that you control in these games.

862
00:55:24,502 --> 00:55:29,778
Rym: But I think almost all of the pros of the modern era outweigh the cons, because...

863
00:55:30,464 --> 00:55:31,320
Scott: Yeah, they do outweigh.

864
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,400
Rym: I can't stress this enough.

865
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:42,280
Rym: Without matchmaking, orthogames online that are highly skill-based are absolutely unplayable now that so many more people play games.

866
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:43,335
Scott: Yup.

867
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:49,000
Scott: So some other positives, right, is that cheating has decreased.

868
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,740
Scott: It's still out there, but it's decreased significantly.

869
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:57,220
Rym: You had to find a server where the social contract was, "Nobody cheats," and the mod would actually ban people who cheated.

870
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,740
Rym: That isn't a problem anymore.

871
00:56:00,021 --> 00:56:01,000
Rym: Nobody cheats at Overwatch.

872
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,280
Rym: If someone cheats at Overwatch, they are banned by the company pretty quickly.

873
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:09,920
Scott: You also don't have to worry too much about the server admin being some jerk, right?

874
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:14,960
Scott: It's like the servers are all adminned by the company, which has the terms of service, right?

875
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:23,493
Scott: It's like if you go to some old Quake server that's run out of someone's house, people there might be going, you know, "Racial slur, racial slur, racial slur,".

876
00:56:23,954 --> 00:56:25,740
Scott: and what are you gonna do about it?

877
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,480
Scott: Report it to who, right?

878
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,240
Scott: It's like the admin who's the one saying racial slur?

879
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,800
Scott: The person who owns that computer?

880
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,299
Scott: It's like, no, right?

881
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:44,940
Scott: But if companies are running them as evil as corporate capitalist entities are, they can actually protect the player base with their terms of service and things of that nature.

882
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:56,820
Scott: And you'll get, you know, it's obviously they haven't completely solved the problem because plenty of people have shitty experiences on their servers all the time, but they can do something about it as opposed to nothing.

883
00:56:58,841 --> 00:57:02,920
Scott: So it's better, you know, even if it's still poopy.

884
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:11,420
Rym: And I think maybe they're like, while there's more we could say, we've gone on over an hour, I'm hungry and I have to play Blades in the Dark like in an hour.

885
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:18,054
Scott: Well, I think the one thing that really needs to be said is the major downside of the not being able to run your own server.

886
00:57:18,254 --> 00:57:20,920
Scott: is the game preservation aspect, right?

887
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:38,159
Scott: All of these multiplayer game experiences, I think this really started with the MMOs and the MUDs, right, is that if the companies running these servers turn their shit off and they don't open source their code or whatever, then you can never experience these games again.

888
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:38,660
Scott: Nobody.

889
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,087
Scott: It's like they're just lost to time permanently.

890
00:57:41,107 --> 00:57:42,130
Scott: They're gone.

891
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:43,475
Scott: There might be screenshots.

892
00:57:44,317 --> 00:57:45,260
Scott: There might be videos.

893
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,250
Scott: There might be some, you know, there might be someone hacks together, like tries to reverse engineer the server or something.

894
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:57,540
Scott: But unless that original server is running, it's a thing that humans can no longer experience.

895
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,889
Scott: Like it is gone, gone the end.

896
00:58:00,753 --> 00:58:02,600
Scott: And that's not cool, right?

897
00:58:03,261 --> 00:58:17,940
Scott: I'm a person who believes that is, you know, if humans are going to survive, right, it's like, what's the point of surviving if we cannot preserve our, you know, a very important note about what you said, though, MMOs did not let players run their own servers ever.

898
00:58:18,921 --> 00:58:19,081
Scott: Nope.

899
00:58:19,582 --> 00:58:21,426
Rym: And in fact, the people who did, they were charging money.

900
00:58:21,467 --> 00:58:21,908
Scott: That's why.

901
00:58:21,928 --> 00:58:22,329
Scott: Yeah.

902
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:27,160
Rym: And FPS is meanwhile, the ones that were well remembered.

903
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:35,860
Scott: Also battle that was really one of the first ones to run their own server with the, you know, the, uh, and the, um, you know, the Diablo.

904
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:43,390
Rym: But like FPS is at least like most FPS is if you have the game, the game usually just includes the ability to host a server.

905
00:58:43,731 --> 00:58:46,094
Rym: So the game is preserved in some way.

906
00:58:46,515 --> 00:58:50,280
Scott: What's not preserved are the reason that we can play quick online today.

907
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:57,496
Scott: But there isn't really, you know, other games that had servers, you know, there isn't a tribes to remake on steam, right?

908
00:58:57,716 --> 00:58:58,939
Scott: Because no one can run that server.

909
00:58:58,979 --> 00:58:59,340
Scott: That's why.

910
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,140
Rym: Exactly.

911
00:59:01,342 --> 00:59:11,660
Rym: Uh, but one thing that I don't, I want to disavow you all of is the idea that a lot was lost in the individual servers that disappeared when people couldn't run them.

912
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:28,638
Rym: Because as much as there's a big creative flourishing, 99.999% of all servers for any game during that entire era, we're running absolutely terrible custom configurations that the admin liked that are best forgotten.

913
00:59:29,278 --> 00:59:30,640
Rym: to be really blunt about it.

914
00:59:32,321 --> 00:59:34,567
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

01:00:29,361 --> 01:00:35,400
Rym: I'm going to pause the Patreon collection for at least a month, because we're going to skip basically a month of shows, and that wouldn't be fair to you.

928
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:42,480
Rym: So, hold on to your little bit of cash for a bit, and I'll see you guys generally in about three weeks.

929
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:47,058
Rym: So for now, I simply leave you with Snurch.

930
01:00:52,660 --> 01:01:00,875
Scott: Snurch knows every snail's disapproval Should've snortshipped her snooner If the Snevans ever did speak.

931
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:03,820
Scott: She's the last truce, now's the peace.

932
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:09,500
Scott: Every snowflake's getting more bleak A fresh noisun each week.

933
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:13,271
Rym: We were born snick, you heard them say it.

934
01:01:13,913 --> 01:01:16,320
Scott: My snurch offers no absolutes.

935
01:01:16,541 --> 01:01:18,990
Scott: She tells me worship in the snail room.

936
01:01:19,351 --> 01:01:24,492
Rym: The only Snevin I'll be sent to Is when I'm snalone with you.

937
01:01:24,512 --> 01:01:26,300
Rym: We were born snick.
