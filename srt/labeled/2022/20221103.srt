00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,280
Scott:

2
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:09,779
Rym: It's Thursday, November 3rd, 2022.

3
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:10,000
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,456 --> 00:00:13,826
Scott: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,455
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

6
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:18,690
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about the Beatles' Juice.

7
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:22,818
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:29,159
Scott: Alright, so the chair I'm sitting in is the same chair that I bought 15 years ago.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:36,919
Scott: And when we bought this chair, we talked about it on GeekNights, and Rym, at the same time, bought a different chair from the same place.

10
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:41,500
Rym: Oh my god, that episode was a long goddamn time ago.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:53,820
Scott: There's a GeekNights episode in 2007 where we bought these chairs, and if 15 years of evidence isn't enough for you, right, it's like the expensive chair is clearly superior, right?

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,660
Scott: Any chair I bought prior to this chair has fallen apart, you know, it was not any good, right?

13
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:03,696
Scott: This chair has lasted 15 years, it's more comfortable, etc, etc.

14
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,098
Scott: The Aeron chair would have been just as good, just a different chair, right?

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,607
Scott: However, this chair, after 15 years, has broken the arm, right?

16
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:27,231
Scott: I guess I must have a habit of just leaning on the right arm, because it literally, like this plastic piece, just broke.

17
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:29,740
Scott: This is pretty thick, it's like, you know, cordless.

18
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,472
Rym: You know, I gotta say, actually, so both these chairs had lifetime warranties, and we did a whole episode about these chairs.

19
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:49,020
Rym: I just want to take you back to the year 2007, because I just looked in the original GeekNights forum, and the first response to the episode where we bought these fancy chairs was a name that I forgot, until just now, Killarney.

20
00:01:50,722 --> 00:01:53,193
Rym: I can't believe that 220-somethings bought a chair like this.

21
00:01:53,454 --> 00:01:54,860
Rym: I guess PT Barnum was right.

22
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,330
Rym: You mean to tell me you couldn't find a chair?

23
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:05,239
Rym: Dude is mad that we bought awesome chairs, and I gotta say, it turned out that buying the awesome chair was the right thing to do.

24
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:14,010
Rym: If both our chairs disintegrated to dust now, if you amortize how much we spent on them over the years between 2007 and 2022, this is one of the best deals in my entire life.

25
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:21,400
Scott: You know, we always say, it costs more to be poor, it's fucking bullshit.

26
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:32,147
Scott: If you don't have enough money to drop a thousand bucks on a chair all at once, or 800 all at once, then it's like, you gotta deal with shitty chairs, and over time, all those shitty chairs add up.

27
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:36,243
Rym: Remember my shitty chair at RIT where the back fell off and it smelled bad?

28
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:36,644
Rym: Right.

29
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:44,473
Scott: It's like, over 15 years of shitty chairs, you're gonna spend more than $1,000, and your body's gonna be less comfortable, and you know, whatever.

30
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:47,661
Rym: My shitty chair was $700.

31
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:47,822
Scott: Yep.

32
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:54,349
Scott: So, we could make another rant about gaming chairs, but the point is, this chair did break, so 15 years is how long the expensive chair lasts.

33
00:02:54,369 --> 00:03:08,484
Scott: However, unlike the cheapy shitty chair, where you'd probably have to just buy a whole new chair, right, I was able to contact the company that makes this high-end chair and get some replacement arm parts, which will come in the mail eventually.

34
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:18,819
Scott: They weren't free, but apparently the chair is so old, they no longer make this specific arm, right, which has, like, pads that move a little bit left and right.

35
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:31,082
Scott: They make pads that move a little bit left and right, but they won't fit directly onto this chair, the ones that they still make, so they have, like, a retrofit kit that you can get, right?

36
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:38,055
Scott: See, this is what happens when you buy a high-end product that's, like, some share from Staples for $100 would not- this would not be an option.

37
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:38,477
Scott: Yeah.

38
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:47,614
Rym: Something- anything you buy on, like, Amazon with a brand name like "U-turn-it-glow-something-something" isn't even going to exist six months after you buy that thing.

39
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:47,735
Scott: Right.

40
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:57,757
Scott: This company had, like, a customer support per- a real human emailed me and sent, like, an invoice and all kinds of- right, and they- they helped me out figuring out which I- what I needed to refit.

41
00:03:57,998 --> 00:04:00,127
Scott: I sent them a picture and I'm like, "Can this be

42
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:00,568
Scott: fixed?".

43
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,082
Scott: They're like, "Yes, buy this exact part number from this cat," right?

44
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:16,324
Scott: It's like, you know, and so apparently the- the better option, or at least was to get the- if you buy a Freedom chair today, this same chair today is obviously not exactly the same as it was 15 years ago.

45
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:21,382
Scott: If you were to buy this exact model today, the newest version, the arms don't move back and forth.

46
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:25,497
Scott: They're just straight, um, but it's much cheaper to just get those.

47
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:28,270
Scott: and do I really need- they don't move back and forth that much.

48
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:29,859
Scott: It's, like, an inch in either direction.

49
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,745
Scott: It's, like, not a big deal.

50
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:34,694
Rym: But I- it was- it was nice, but yeah, it's not everything.

51
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:39,990
Scott: Yeah, so, uh, I ordered- they had to- I had- I couldn't just buy the one arm.

52
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,263
Scott: I had to buy two arms, uh, and also two pads.

53
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:48,257
Scott: I had actually replaced the- every squishy part of this chair in the past.

54
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:56,223
Scott: I replaced the arm pads, which was free a long time ago, but that wasn't broken because, uh, you know, the chair broke over time.

55
00:04:56,283 --> 00:04:59,133
Scott: It's because I- I stabbed the thing accidentally.

56
00:04:59,153 --> 00:05:09,414
Rym: Yeah, the only thing wrong with my Aeron chair is there's some foam bits in the lumbar support, and they are brittle to the point that if I so much as touch them, they'll crumble into dust, so I gotta replace those.

57
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:22,879
Scott: So also the- pads, the head- the squishy upholstered parts of this chair, I did pay to replace, um, because an Aeron chair is- I guess that's the one main advantage of it, is it's not upholstered.

58
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:29,444
Scott: It's just that mesh material, so if that doesn't really wear out so much, I guess if it did, it would just rip, right?

59
00:05:29,464 --> 00:05:30,207
Scott: And then it'll be over.

60
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:31,914
Scott: That's the end, right?

61
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:37,415
Scott: Whereas this chair has upholstery, sort of like a car chair, only much less thick.

62
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:46,287
Rym: Yeah, I mean, the difference- the Aeron is all like that pellicle, like the- that- the only part of it that in any way could fall apart is that foam and that one bit.

63
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:52,573
Rym: Yep, so I did replace- I- I did pay to- Oh god, I just touched it, and like a big chunk of it just fell off.

64
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:53,479
Rym: I really gotta get that fixed.

65
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:54,222
Scott: Why'd you do that for?

66
00:05:54,243 --> 00:05:56,392
Scott: You could buy probably a replacement pad.

67
00:05:56,412 --> 00:06:02,587
Rym: Oh no, I- I already- I reached out to Aeron a while ago- I reached out- not Aeron, I reached out to the company a while ago, and they were like- Herman Miller.

68
00:06:02,748 --> 00:06:05,161
Rym: Yeah, oh yeah, it's covered under warranty, that's a normal thing.

69
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:08,013
Rym: I just haven't actually like done the thing yet.

70
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:11,067
Scott: I actually do own an Aeron chair right over there that I bought.

71
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:17,053
Scott: I think I told this on the show when it happened, but you know, I was looking- when I was still working in offices, right?

72
00:06:17,153 --> 00:06:30,326
Scott: I wanted to get an Aeron chair, and I was like Craigslist did, and I saw- or Facebook Marketplace, I forget which one, and some dude nearby just happened to be getting ready to move to California and had an Aeron chair of 200 bucks, and I went- I ran over there,

73
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:31,710
Rym: and I checked it out.

74
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:37,491
Scott: So my old company had- It was a real- it was a real Aeron chair, a pretty recent one, and I'm like really, 200?

75
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:40,984
Scott: And he's like yep, only 200, and I just- I'm just like BAM!

76
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:45,660
Scott: I ran out of there before he could say- or change his mind or anything.

77
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:55,032
Scott: Just like- I wheeled it down the street, I wheeled it to Manhattan, I wheeled it back, I wheeled that chair all over to make do with the $200 Aeron chair.

78
00:06:55,212 --> 00:07:06,469
Rym: So my old company, you know, we moved offices, and we moved into an office that basically the company had like gone under, so it was filled with Aeron chairs.

79
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,734
Rym: They were just there.

80
00:07:07,754 --> 00:07:15,039
Scott: I mean, when I worked in the middle of nowhere, it was a- it was a disaster recovery office that was filled with Aeron chairs.

81
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,352
Scott: that I think they- they got from New Orleans.

82
00:07:19,392 --> 00:07:26,963
Scott: They- when they closed- when the hurricane, they closed the New Orleans office, and I think all those Aeron chairs were in the disaster recovery place that I was working.

83
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:31,123
Scott: And there were just so many of them, and it was only like two to three people working there ever.

84
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:33,952
Scott: Usually, most days, it was me only, so.

85
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:38,389
Rym: I've also seen people selling Aeron chairs that are clearly just fake knockoffs.

86
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:39,936
Rym: There's a lot of knockoff Aeron chairs.

87
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:40,739
Scott: Yep.

88
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:55,713
Scott: I guess the one good news out there, if you're the kind of person who's thinking about gaming chair, if you can afford it, Herman Miller, the Aeron company, is now making gaming chairs that are also legit expensive chairs, but are also gamer styling.

89
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:58,743
Rym: They are the only company I would trust to buy a chair like that.

90
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:08,376
Scott: Yeah, so I think if this chair was actually dead, like truly dead, I was gonna go and at least sit in some of those to see how they do.

91
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:15,202
Rym: I think we've talked to those on GeekNights, but just to be clear, gamer chairs are worse quality than like a Shido Staples chair.

92
00:08:15,223 --> 00:08:16,908
Rym: Like, they are not good chairs.

93
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:17,991
Scott: And they cost more.

94
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:22,085
Rym: Yeah, but they wear out just as they're not good.

95
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:23,152
Rym: They're not that comfortable.

96
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:24,259
Rym: They are bad chairs.

97
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,377
Scott: Yeah, so, yeah, Herman Miller has the Herman Miller X. It's actually a Logitech.

98
00:08:30,397 --> 00:08:34,033
Scott: The Logitech, it's a Herman Miller Embody is a chair that they already have.

99
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:37,724
Scott: They have a Herman Miller Logitech Embody chair.

100
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:41,193
Scott: This chair is too expensive.

101
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:42,256
Scott: I would not buy the $2,200 chair.

102
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:44,503
Scott: $2,200?

103
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:45,527
Rym: Just buy an Aeron chair.

104
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:46,310
Rym: God damn.

105
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,538
Scott: The $1,000 chair is just fine.

106
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,887
Rym: You know, I still have the physical receipt from when we bought these chairs with all the like original warranty information from Sam Flax.

107
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:57,938
Scott: I don't know if that store doesn't exist anymore.

108
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:02,840
Rym: It doesn't, but I have the original piece of paper with both of our chairs and our signatures and everything.

109
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,925
Rym: Yeah, anyway, it's like a carbon copy.

110
00:09:07,108 --> 00:09:18,663
Rym: Yeah, so in the news, of all the things that are happening in our late capitalist dystopia, this one is probably not the worst or most important thing, but it's worth calling out.

111
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:27,828
Rym: because fuck this, and I deeply, deeply hate every single human being who contributed to this event that is occurring.

112
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,580
Rym: It is supposedly happening today in New York.

113
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,565
Rym: I refuse to go see it.

114
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:48,807
Rym: I hope I don't encounter any light from it, but I'm doing the thing that we did back when we did the episode where we talked about the chairs, where we spent like 10 minutes talking about how we bought something without saying what it was that we bought to build up that moment, but not actually saying it.

115
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:51,460
Rym: So I'm doing that now again, bringing us full circle.

116
00:09:52,260 --> 00:10:02,848
Rym: So New York City's skyline is going to have 500 drones in the air, I think over the East River, showing ads with lights in the sky.

117
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:08,866
Rym: They are projecting fucking advertising into the sky against New York's will.

118
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,778
Rym: I mean, I'm not going to say the name of the company.

119
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:14,669
Scott: Skywriting has been a thing for a long time, but skywriting.

120
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,605
Scott: and when you go to the beach, people fly off with, you know, the banners behind the little planes.

121
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:19,966
Scott: Yep.

122
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:26,064
Rym: This is a gigantic moving animated digital billboard lit up that you can't ignore.

123
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:38,106
Rym: New York City like deeply bans this stuff, and apparently the company that's doing it, they know this, but they don't want to advertise in New Jersey because nobody in New Jersey has any money.

124
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:45,858
Rym: So they're advertising at New York, but the drones are all taking off from New Jersey and apparently they can't come to New York, can they?

125
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:50,800
Rym: They're going to stay over the water at the midpoint between New York and New Jersey so they don't get in trouble.

126
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,462
Scott: I mean, technically, if one of the drones went over the line into New York, the police could shoot at them.

127
00:10:58,044 --> 00:10:59,750
Rym: I would love for that to happen.

128
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:01,857
Scott: I think that I think that's true.

129
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:08,561
Scott: I think it's I think like if you fly a drone in a legal place that there is like law enforcement can shoot at me.

130
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:09,564
Scott: I heard someone said that.

131
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:17,789
Rym: I don't know about New York City, but in other cities in in America and globally, there are net guns that they use.

132
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:29,206
Rym: And I saw video in Singapore of a government drone that carries a net and is designed to capture illegally flying drones to then try to track down who flew them and deal with them.

133
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:34,781
Rym: So, yeah, according to the law, someone did the research.

134
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:37,350
Rym: This would be super illegal.

135
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:41,585
Rym: And there's a big fight over this whole thing because of the technicalities involved.

136
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:45,521
Rym: This is not the first time some company in New Jersey has tried this shit.

137
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:53,063
Rym: Apparently, many years ago, some New Jersey company had billboard boats with super bright LEDs.

138
00:11:53,103 --> 00:12:04,340
Rym: They were sending up and down the East River and there were years of lawsuits until eventually they were, quote, the article run out of town by a combination of state and city lawsuits.

139
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,489
Rym: So, yeah, I despise this.

140
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,634
Rym: If you took part in this, I hate you.

141
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:14,342
Rym: Advertising has already ruined enough things.

142
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:20,344
Rym: We don't need to ruin the pleasant skyline from New York City and the quiet waterfronts that we all enjoy.

143
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,471
Rym: So what do you got?

144
00:12:23,254 --> 00:12:25,100
Rym: Some other late capitalist hell, it looks like?

145
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:26,384
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

146
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:35,234
Scott: So if you are someone who knows anything about printing or graphic design or anything like that, you know about a company called Pantone.

147
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:41,919
Scott: And what Pantone does is they're a company that basically just does a lot of color science and color management work for you.

148
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:47,414
Scott: And if you use their system, right, you know, you pay the money.

149
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,025
Scott: It basically makes it really easy to pick out a color, right?

150
00:12:51,547 --> 00:13:02,986
Scott: See that color on your computer and then know, because, you know, you're digitally encoding that color in your files, that when you print it, that's the color you're going to see when you print.

151
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:09,614
Scott: If you were to like, you know, and like if you're going to get, you could get some paint mixed and the paint would be exactly that color.

152
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:10,217
Scott: Right.

153
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:19,073
Rym: It's like, you know, that GeekNights' banner we made a long time ago, which after we get the new website up, gonna make new little banners to bring to cons with the new styling.

154
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:33,824
Rym: But I printed that using Pantone colors, because if I gave a file like a Photoshop file to the printer and I specified Pantone color codes in the Photoshop file, they would print exactly what I specified using specific ink.

155
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:36,393
Rym: And if they fucked it up, they would have to reprint it.

156
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:37,436
Scott: Right.

157
00:13:37,456 --> 00:13:41,007
Scott: So like if you were, say, a company.

158
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:41,488
Scott: Right.

159
00:13:41,568 --> 00:13:47,706
Scott: And you made a new trademark logo, you know, and maybe maybe your colors are green and silver.

160
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:48,629
Scott: Right.

161
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:53,083
Scott: And you're like, OK, the green for our logo is this green, this specific one.

162
00:13:53,284 --> 00:13:53,565
Scott: Right.

163
00:13:53,926 --> 00:13:55,891
Scott: And it's Pantone number whatever.

164
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:59,944
Scott: And now anyone who's in your huge, gigantic company.

165
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:00,386
Scott: Right.

166
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:02,033
Scott: That's in some style guide somewhere.

167
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:16,120
Scott: So whether they're making a logo for a website or making T-shirts and they need to get dye the T-shirts correctly or they're printing out flyers or they're making a TV commercial or the mascot is going to have a wig.

168
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,147
Scott: that's the same green and silver color.

169
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:18,649
Scott: Right.

170
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:21,860
Scott: It's like the color can be the exact right color.

171
00:14:22,282 --> 00:14:22,442
Scott: Right.

172
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:24,028
Scott: With the Pantone system.

173
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:24,490
Scott: Right.

174
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:26,557
Scott: But the Pantone system isn't free.

175
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:32,777
Scott: That company's got to make money because it's it's not just like some you think why this would be a consortium.

176
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:33,540
Rym: Right.

177
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:36,132
Scott: You think why would it be something that costs?

178
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:37,559
Scott: like what work is involved?

179
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:39,185
Scott: Like, I can just pick a color.

180
00:14:39,286 --> 00:14:39,547
Scott: It's like.

181
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,390
Scott: it's not that easy.

182
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:40,811
Scott: Yeah.

183
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:42,136
Rym: I mean, I know.

184
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:42,578
Rym: Yeah.

185
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:42,899
Rym: There is.

186
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:45,488
Rym: there is a what I know about this space.

187
00:14:45,548 --> 00:14:49,139
Rym: There is a lot of work and a lot of employees involved in this.

188
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:50,042
Scott: Yeah.

189
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,113
Scott: So a lot of color science and things like that.

190
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:54,017
Scott: So I didn't realize.

191
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:56,909
Scott: this is just a side note that has nothing to do with the news story.

192
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,697
Scott: There's a company called X, right.

193
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:00,443
Scott: Which is a company that I knew about.

194
00:15:00,503 --> 00:15:01,547
Scott: that I didn't realize.

195
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:02,128
Scott: X, right.

196
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:06,925
Scott: But Pantone, what X, right, makes is they make these little cult.

197
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:12,570
Scott: They make these color checkers, which I kind of wanted, but they're too expensive for at least my purposes.

198
00:15:13,032 --> 00:15:16,705
Scott: And it's basically like these little cards that have a bunch of color swatches on them.

199
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:23,829
Scott: And if you're doing photo or video work, you can hold up this little color swatch in your video or your photo.

200
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,491
Scott: Right.

201
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:29,046
Scott: In in the same lighting with the same camera equipment with the same settings.

202
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:38,638
Scott: And then when you go to process your video, usually video, but could be photos, you use that little software and you say, hey, software, here's the.

203
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:41,187
Scott: here's the frame of the video where I'm holding the thing.

204
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:42,391
Scott: There's the thing.

205
00:15:42,913 --> 00:15:43,134
Scott: Right.

206
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:43,937
Scott: Look at it.

207
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,545
Scott: Look at what values the camera recorded.

208
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:47,347
Scott: Right.

209
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:57,195
Scott: And you know what colors those actually are, because you know what I held up the the carefully manufactured and printed object that you sold me.

210
00:15:57,216 --> 00:15:57,958
Scott: Right.

211
00:15:58,298 --> 00:16:02,211
Scott: So now you can calibrate my colors perfectly exactly the same every time.

212
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:04,860
Scott: And it's literally like it's not cheap.

213
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,769
Scott: It's like a few hundred bucks to get one of these things.

214
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:15,662
Scott: But it's like once you have it and you have the software, it's like a one click operation to get perfect color in every single video and photo ever.

215
00:16:15,723 --> 00:16:16,585
Scott: So it's kind of useful.

216
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:16,826
Scott: Right.

217
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:24,734
Scott: That company bought Pantone and then another company that I've never heard of called Donahue Corporation bought X, right.

218
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:29,768
Rym: That probably explains why suddenly Pantone is all agro about stuff.

219
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:30,670
Scott: Right.

220
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,939
Scott: So when did they buy Pantone?

221
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:34,741
Scott: in 2012?

222
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:38,391
Scott: So it's been a while, 10, 10 years ago anyway.

223
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:39,214
Scott: So what happened?

224
00:16:39,254 --> 00:16:46,217
Scott: Well, Photoshop has had support for Pantone for a long time, which is obviously kind of a necessary thing.

225
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,992
Scott: If you're a professional graphic designer, Photoshop is your main deal.

226
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:54,972
Scott: You're living your life in that program and you're going to need to get the colors right.

227
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:56,900
Scott: And you're going to need some Pantone support.

228
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:05,869
Rym: And Adobe had some sort of licensing deal with Pantone, the deals of the details of which are actually hard to suss out and murky as we'll get into.

229
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:11,555
Rym: Like no one, no one knows the full story because they're everyone involved is being very quiet and there's a lot of lawyers.

230
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:25,343
Scott: The point is, up until recently, if you have if you had the real Photoshop, you could make files and in those files, you could specify, you know, I'm going to paint in this area of my image with this specific Pantone color.

231
00:17:25,704 --> 00:17:34,160
Scott: And when you saved the image, if you sent it to a printer, the printer would match the color correctly because you're using the Pantone system and everything would be great.

232
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:44,704
Scott: Photoshop is or has removed this because of, I guess, fights, business fights with Pantone slash X, right?

233
00:17:44,724 --> 00:17:45,246
Scott: Slash Donner.

234
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:47,556
Rym: Adobe is making accusations at them.

235
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:49,503
Rym: They're making accusations back at Adobe.

236
00:17:49,563 --> 00:17:50,647
Rym: No one knows the full story.

237
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:54,861
Rym: What we do know is they are requiring using a third party.

238
00:17:54,902 --> 00:18:00,384
Rym: plug in that if you have any Adobe software and you want to use Pantone, you got to pay Pantone 15 dollars a month.

239
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:01,327
Scott: Yep.

240
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:03,413
Scott: So that's the new the new deal.

241
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:21,630
Scott: If you are some sort of professional and you really need to specify Pantone colors, right, and get things exactly right in that way, you're going to need to buy this plug in and pay Pantone 15 bucks a month to make Photoshop do what it used to do for zero dollars, 15 bucks a month.

242
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:29,894
Scott: I mean, if you're buying like the Photoshop Lightroom only photography package bar, that's right.

243
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:31,780
Scott: It's like that package.

244
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,868
Scott: Let's see, Adobe creative.

245
00:18:33,968 --> 00:18:34,129
Scott: Yeah.

246
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:35,314
Rym: What does that cost right now?

247
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:36,418
Rym: Is that 15 bucks a month?

248
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,004
Scott: I haven't looked at one.

249
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:38,827
Scott: It's 20 a month.

250
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:43,124
Scott: So it's 20 a month to get Lightroom and Photoshop in the photo package.

251
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:43,887
Scott: Right.

252
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:50,889
Scott: That includes Lightroom, Lightroom, classic and real Photoshop on desktop and iPad and a terabyte of cloud storage.

253
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,214
Scott: Twenty bucks a month.

254
00:18:52,735 --> 00:19:07,147
Scott: So to add Pantone support a single feature, you're almost doubling the price of that creative cloud package, even if you got the full creative cloud package for fifty five dollars a month, which includes literally every Adobe thing there is.

255
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:07,788
Scott: Right.

256
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:10,395
Scott: All the Adobe software's right.

257
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:15,092
Scott: That's a twenty seven percent markup to add this single feature.

258
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:17,060
Scott: You have to pay twenty seven percent more.

259
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:28,993
Scott: Is the Pantone color system and access to it and the ability to use it worth the equivalent of one third of all the Adobe software that Adobe makes?

260
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:36,434
Rym: I would say for ninety nine percent of all users of all Adobe software, the answer is absolutely not.

261
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:37,417
Scott: Right.

262
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:39,123
Scott: So if I was Pantone.

263
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:39,966
Scott: Right.

264
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:43,962
Scott: It's like, yeah, there are professionals, people out there in the industry who need this.

265
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:48,317
Scott: We're going to basically be blackmailed or whatever or extorted.

266
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:51,106
Scott: I guess extorted is the right word in paying this fee.

267
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:52,812
Scott: And there's nothing they can do about it.

268
00:19:53,253 --> 00:20:03,682
Scott: Will those fifteen dollar fees per month add up to more than the money they were just getting from Adobe as like the general license deal?

269
00:20:03,722 --> 00:20:04,645
Scott: That is the question.

270
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:24,848
Scott: Now, the thing is, when people are even if people in the short term pay this extortion fee right to Pantone, will they those people, I guarantee you, right, if they care about money at all and they're looking at their expenses, they're going to be looking for alternatives, any alternative they can.

271
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:27,397
Rym: Now, here's where Internet artists.

272
00:20:27,437 --> 00:20:31,010
Rym: This is one of the last discourses I saw on Twitter before I stopped using it.

273
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:32,014
Rym: So it was fresh in mind.

274
00:20:32,757 --> 00:20:46,235
Rym: A lot of Internet artists, the same people who say, oh, the gift is just as good as Photoshop or like they have weird ideas about alternatives to Adobe software because they don't understand like professional commercial use cases versus personal like that whole space.

275
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:47,399
Rym: I don't want to stick my hand in it.

276
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,397
Rym: Some of you are really already mad, but they were really misunderstanding this.

277
00:20:52,437 --> 00:20:55,266
Rym: Like, you can't copyright the hex code of a color.

278
00:20:55,327 --> 00:20:58,600
Rym: Like, yeah, the hex code of a color does not do what Pantone does.

279
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,907
Rym: Pantone is for one thing.

280
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,295
Rym: One hundred percent consistency.

281
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:15,837
Rym: If you are printing something, if you are not printing things and you do not paint 100 percent accurate manufacturing, yeah, like brands, commercial stuff, you really don't need this for anything else.

282
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:20,113
Rym: But worse, they were all passing around all these alternatives to Pantone.

283
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:21,740
Rym: None of those do.

284
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,086
Rym: Not one of them does what Pantone does.

285
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:31,130
Rym: They are just people trying to trick you into using their thing, using this Pantone thing as an excuse.

286
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:36,751
Rym: Those things will not do anything for you that regular old Photoshop color codes don't already do.

287
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:37,153
Rym: Yep.

288
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:37,735
Scott: Right.

289
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:44,060
Scott: So, for example, I opened up, if you go to Google and type color picker, there's a color picker that's built into Google, right?

290
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,094
Scott: So when I opened it, it automatically started out on this nice green color, 32A852, right?

291
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,872
Rym: Oh, that's not as good as 238023, but it's a good one.

292
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:54,857
Scott: It's a very nice green.

293
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:58,775
Scott: Maybe Google knows me so well, it can pick close to my favorite color just knowing, right?

294
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:01,812
Scott: Who knows how it decided which color to start on in the color picture.

295
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:03,019
Rym: Oh, it started on the same one for me.

296
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:04,282
Scott: Okay.

297
00:22:04,663 --> 00:22:11,667
Scott: So I could take that color and I could select that color in Photoshop and paint something and save it as a PSD, right?

298
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:17,124
Scott: And then I can go to the paint store and I could say, I would like to paint the wall of my house 32A852.

299
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:19,129
Scott: It's like, they can't.

300
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:27,175
Scott: It's like, it won't be, it's like, there's no way for them to make that exact color, right?

301
00:22:27,557 --> 00:22:30,227
Scott: And even if it's like, it would be a whole process, right?

302
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:33,920
Scott: To figure out how to get that exact same color in the paint.

303
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:42,232
Rym: That is why if you were an adult and you're painting your house, you get swatches that are actual samples of what it'll look like in the real world.

304
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:45,303
Scott: Someone took the paint, painted it, dried it, right?

305
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:46,629
Scott: And vice versa, right?

306
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:52,113
Scott: Let's say I go to the hardware store and I buy a bucket of paint, you know, and it's called, you know, mauve or something.

307
00:22:52,535 --> 00:22:53,640
Scott: And then I, what am I going to do?

308
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:58,412
Scott: Now I want to make, I paint a mural outside my house, right?

309
00:22:58,512 --> 00:23:02,002
Scott: And now I want to on the computer, right?

310
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:09,223
Scott: In Photoshop, paint something in Photoshop, the exact same color as the paint that I just painted the wall with.

311
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:10,026
Scott: What am I going to do?

312
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:12,655
Scott: Take a photo of the wall, right?

313
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,160
Scott: Open it up in Photoshop.

314
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:24,982
Scott: You got, even if I get the white balance and everything exactly right, it's like, it's a lot of work to then figure out the exact text code, right?

315
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:34,567
Scott: To paint whatever that paint was that was on the wall and have it be exactly the same such that if I were to then go to a printer, right?

316
00:23:34,928 --> 00:23:44,519
Scott: And print out what I painted in Photoshop and hold it up next to my mural for it to basically be perfectly camouflaged because it's the same, right?

317
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:45,322
Scott: Go ahead.

318
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,329
Scott: Try to do that with a hex code only, right?

319
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:51,705
Scott: And now do it for a fuck ton of colors because that's what Pantone does.

320
00:23:51,745 --> 00:23:53,471
Scott: They do that for fuck tons of colors.

321
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:58,027
Scott: So what I would choose any one of the Pantone colors and avoid all of that labor.

322
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:22,294
Rym: If you are not like a super professional working with brands but you're making physical things, what you can probably do is have a relationship with the company you were printing with because what I have printed things over the years, like serious things, even though I just send them a file, I've usually gotten a proof back, I have talked to them, I have been able to like chat in a window, like they'll give me ink options.

323
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:27,972
Rym: If you know your printer and talk to them, you could probably say like, "Hey, here's the file.

324
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:31,664
Rym: By the way, we want that green to be this Pantone

325
00:24:31,684 --> 00:24:32,005
Rym: color.".

326
00:24:32,286 --> 00:24:37,148
Rym: Just say it out loud or put it in an email and they can probably take care of it even if Photoshop doesn't support it.

327
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:42,790
Rym: And also, I typed it into that color picker just to make sure my memory wasn't faulty.

328
00:24:43,252 --> 00:24:44,117
Rym: Yeah, 238023 remains my favorite green.

329
00:24:44,157 --> 00:24:44,458
Rym: Like, goddamn.

330
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,021
Rym: That hex code I remember to this day.

331
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:50,149
Rym: That is a good green right there.

332
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,509
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

333
00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:00,194
Rym: I bumped into this randomly.

334
00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:01,959
Rym: I just bumped into this.

335
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:03,022
Rym: It's a cute channel.

336
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:05,731
Rym: It is Himari and Bear.

337
00:25:06,092 --> 00:25:13,572
Rym: And they're just short little animations, like 2D animation, uh, of this girl and often also this bear.

338
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:16,780
Rym: And they are short, they're adorable, they're funny.

339
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:24,407
Rym: And what I'm linking to is titled, it's a one minute and ten second long short titled Test of Courage.

340
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:31,788
Rym: And it is a double knockout system test of courage between the girl and the bear.

341
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:33,474
Rym: that is Halloween appropriate.

342
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:35,563
Rym: It is worth watching and I'll edit that.

343
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:37,960
Rym: It is funnier than you're going to expect.

344
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,401
Scott: All right.

345
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:42,193
Scott: So, uh, nerds love a magic trick, right?

346
00:25:42,234 --> 00:25:49,567
Scott: But we've seen so many magic tricks and especially with the Internet giving up so many secrets and being able to watch videos and slow-mo and all this stuff.

347
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:54,930
Scott: It's like, you know, it takes a pretty amazing magic trick to be worthy of thing of the day-ness, right?

348
00:25:55,391 --> 00:25:59,247
Scott: So this one is you're gonna have to decide for yourself, right?

349
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,493
Scott: What you think about this one.

350
00:26:00,553 --> 00:26:01,980
Scott: Rym thinks there's some video editing.

351
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:10,541
Rym: Well, I think there is some video editing, but I am not sure if that is germane to the physicality of the trick.

352
00:26:11,123 --> 00:26:11,284
Rym: Yep.

353
00:26:11,645 --> 00:26:15,076
Scott: The magician in the video is moderately famous.

354
00:26:15,497 --> 00:26:17,926
Scott: There are many other videos of them doing the trick as well.

355
00:26:18,268 --> 00:26:23,251
Scott: They put a stopwatch in the video to sort of make you believe it's not edited, which I just want to point out.

356
00:26:23,352 --> 00:26:32,123
Rym: irrespective of this video that is trivial to do compositing with, uh, to avoid, to have a stopwatch there that's not actually there or vice versa.

357
00:26:32,645 --> 00:26:33,107
Scott: Could be.

358
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:37,643
Rym: In fact, I watched the Captain Disillusion where he specifically showed exactly how to do that.

359
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:47,634
Scott: And also, the magician in the video claims that you can hire them and they will perform and request this trick and they will perform it for you live.

360
00:26:47,835 --> 00:26:50,628
Rym: So I kind of want to find out how much that would cost.

361
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:51,997
Rym: Imagine if we have a party in the future.

362
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:54,856
Scott: I think it's, I think the price is really going to depend on where this guy lives, right?

363
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:57,529
Scott: He's probably in Vegas or LA or some shit where the magicians live.

364
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:18,790
Rym: If there was ever, if we were like at a convention like for GeekNights someday down the road and it was reasonably feasible and cost effective to hire this guy to like come to the convention and perform for us, I would consider paying to find out if this is a video trick or a legit trick because it would be really funny if you pay him to present it and he's like, "Yeah, it's a video trick.

365
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:19,292
Rym: Don't let out.

366
00:27:19,312 --> 00:27:19,935
Rym: Here's your money back.

367
00:27:20,136 --> 00:27:20,437
Rym: Haha.

368
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:20,658
Rym: Wink.".

369
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:30,529
Scott: But the, uh, the trick, uh, if it is not a video trick or even if it is, just even thinking of this trick is still, uh, quite impressive.

370
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,151
Scott: Right.

371
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:37,374
Scott: Um, I mean, and if you look at the YouTube comments, usually YouTube comments are like, "Ah, I see how you did it.

372
00:27:37,454 --> 00:27:38,399
Scott: Someone down there knows

373
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:38,740
Scott: something.".

374
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,081
Scott: Right.

375
00:27:39,663 --> 00:27:43,537
Scott: All the YouTube comments are like, "Oh, I see how they're all sarcastic.

376
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:44,601
Scott: Like I see how you did it.

377
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:48,430
Scott: Years of practice and lots of

378
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:48,932
Scott: talent.".

379
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:57,099
Scott: It's like, there's no actual answers down there because, uh, it's, it's impressive and hard to, hard to figure out how the hell he did it.

380
00:27:58,421 --> 00:27:58,622
Rym: Yep.

381
00:27:58,722 --> 00:28:01,994
Rym: I can think of, I got my vague ideas for how you would do it.

382
00:28:02,094 --> 00:28:08,035
Rym: if it is not video trickery would be around either being really good at spinning a poker chip to land somewhere.

383
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:09,721
Scott: That's how I think it is.

384
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:14,623
Rym: Or having some way to, having some way to control where the poker chip will go, like a magnet thing.

385
00:28:14,764 --> 00:28:18,961
Scott: We already know that people with slate of hand can control a card in a deck, right?

386
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:25,589
Rym: They can, no matter, I am confident he could wash a specific card to a specific part of the table in pretty much any circumstances.

387
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:26,512
Scott: Yes.

388
00:28:26,793 --> 00:28:30,608
Scott: That's the part that's, you know, I've, I've seen magicians do that shit with cards before.

389
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:36,690
Scott: How could he spin a poker chip and get it to land in the specific spot he wants?

390
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,393
Scott: That's right.

391
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,677
Scott: That ain't easy.

392
00:28:38,757 --> 00:28:44,060
Scott: Maybe he just practiced spinning poker chips a whole bunch and he can make them land where he wants them to land.

393
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,885
Rym: Like Juggaboo Jones with his 2d6.

394
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:46,867
Scott: Yeah.

395
00:28:47,048 --> 00:28:47,409
Scott: Anyway.

396
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:47,950
Rym: Yep.

397
00:28:48,291 --> 00:29:04,322
Rym: I, so like I said, I, the thing I can't tell either is if the compositing like blurriness that I see is that could also be encoding artifacts because I see it in two of his videos about this, but at the same time, bad encoder settings could also cause that.

398
00:29:04,422 --> 00:29:06,528
Rym: So I am ambivalent and I am unsure.

399
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:09,336
Scott: Anyway, magic trick.

400
00:29:09,396 --> 00:29:09,697
Scott: Yeah.

401
00:29:10,218 --> 00:29:12,944
Rym: In the moment, the GeekNights book club book is a leaf.

402
00:29:13,446 --> 00:29:16,051
Rym: The unseen too bad.

403
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:16,673
Scott: I can't see it.

404
00:29:18,677 --> 00:29:22,891
Scott: I did update the website with the link to the book and whatnot.

405
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:23,513
Scott: I bought it.

406
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:24,838
Rym: I'm going to start reading it.

407
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,465
Rym: We will do the show before too long.

408
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:31,227
Rym: It's not a super long book, but it is not, it's not a binty that you're going to read in like one sitting.

409
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,358
Scott: No, I don't actually don't know how long it is.

410
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:34,503
Scott: Cause I have a digital version.

411
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,528
Scott: I didn't look how long it is.

412
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:47,805
Scott: I have not started reading it yet, but it is on my phone and my kid is a, it is a cyberpunk novel that is in some sort of a middle Eastern mythological cyberpunk setting.

413
00:29:48,889 --> 00:30:01,392
Scott: And the author, you know, like I said, when I announced the book, the notable thing was that somehow this author got two of their books onto my personal book wishlist, even though I didn't know who they were and they only wrote two books.

414
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:07,917
Scott: And it's um, be a G Willow Wilson got famous, you know, inventing, you know, Ms.

415
00:30:07,937 --> 00:30:08,941
Scott: Marvel, the newer Ms.

416
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:09,363
Scott: Marvel.

417
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,090
Scott: So, and they wrote these two books.

418
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:14,163
Scott: One of which is the first of which is a leaf, unseen.

419
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:15,789
Scott: So I'm going to read that.

420
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:17,937
Rym: I'm actually pretty excited.

421
00:30:17,977 --> 00:30:22,713
Rym: Just what, what this looks like, it's about seems very much up both our alley.

422
00:30:23,335 --> 00:30:25,503
Rym: Uh, and I remember we're using the new format.

423
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:29,199
Rym: So Scott picked two books and I had to pick which one of them to read.

424
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,605
Rym: And this is the one that spoke to me more.

425
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:35,586
Rym: I hope I was correct in that decision, but I'm probably going to read the other book anyway.

426
00:30:35,607 --> 00:30:35,687
Rym: Yeah.

427
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:39,525
Scott: I think they're just, I don't think they're related other than having the same author.

428
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:41,012
Scott: They're just two novels.

429
00:30:41,032 --> 00:30:42,176
Scott: I don't think there's a series.

430
00:30:42,196 --> 00:30:44,346
Rym: I read one book by an author.

431
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:45,552
Rym: I like, I read all their books.

432
00:30:45,813 --> 00:30:47,260
Rym: I read one book in a long series.

433
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,364
Rym: I just read all of them.

434
00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:50,331
Rym: really hard to avoid that in my life.

435
00:30:51,094 --> 00:30:52,540
Scott: and other book news, right?

436
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,325
Scott: Our previous book club book city.

437
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:57,717
Scott: We became the, at the sequel to that book.

438
00:30:57,877 --> 00:31:05,865
Rym: The world we make came out like yesterday day before they uploaded a little YouTube video, like a really short thing that was like, Hey, it's out.

439
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:11,285
Rym: And you see a little technical guys coming out of Staten Island and little promo that they did.

440
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:11,967
Scott: Yeah.

441
00:31:12,108 --> 00:31:16,446
Scott: Also the New York public library tonight, I guess if anyone is watching this live, right?

442
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:17,572
Scott: The New York public library.

443
00:31:17,632 --> 00:31:19,822
Rym: There are nine people watching this live right now.

444
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:20,724
Scott: Yeah.

445
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:23,373
Scott: So nine people who have heard this on November 3rd, 2022.

446
00:31:23,373 --> 00:31:27,186
Scott: It actually might've started already at this point.

447
00:31:27,507 --> 00:31:29,595
Scott: Um, we're missing it, but that's all right.

448
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:36,600
Scott: There is a live discussion with the author and K. Jemisin and LeVar Burton at the New York public library.

449
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:41,294
Rym: That is two extremely powerful people about this book, right?

450
00:31:41,374 --> 00:31:43,460
Scott: It's like a book release chat thing.

451
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,883
Scott: So, um, you know, and what more appropriate place the New York public library for the New York books here, right?

452
00:31:50,444 --> 00:31:53,151
Rym: Oh man.

453
00:31:53,251 --> 00:31:58,326
Scott: So nine people watching this, you want to, you want to leave this stream and go find that stream instead.

454
00:31:58,688 --> 00:31:58,889
Rym: Yeah.

455
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:03,910
Rym: Nothing I either of us say at our lives will be more interesting than what those two individuals might say.

456
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,797
Scott: I'm hoping to find a recording and watch.

457
00:32:05,877 --> 00:32:16,057
Rym: Oh otherwise in the moment, uh, you know, Scott's working on the website, uh, we'll be at PAX Unplugged doing a panel called why is this game taking four hours on Sunday?

458
00:32:16,077 --> 00:32:23,302
Rym: I have made a significant update to that panel already based on Marvel snap, uh, which I think is relevant to the conversation.

459
00:32:23,322 --> 00:32:36,744
Rym: Uh, otherwise we're just, you know, doing our thing, doing geek diets pretty regularly again up until the usual December hiatus, but I don't foresee any more, uh, unexpected hiatus, at least till next year sometime.

460
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:39,653
Rym: Tiny chance.

461
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:45,658
Rym: I'll have to go to Germany for a week in December, but, uh, we generally get fucked over and only do a few episodes in December.

462
00:32:45,698 --> 00:32:49,914
Rym: Anyways, that wouldn't be that different from, uh, normal times also.

463
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:50,296
Scott: All right.

464
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:51,380
Rym: Last thing.

465
00:32:52,242 --> 00:32:53,126
Rym: I'm not using Twitter.

466
00:32:53,186 --> 00:32:53,709
Rym: Don't at me.

467
00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:56,060
Rym: Like I literally do not see ats anymore at all.

468
00:32:56,321 --> 00:33:03,544
Rym: Do not mistake GeekNights, things appearing on Twitter from, uh, to be me looking at Twitter in any capacity.

469
00:33:03,624 --> 00:33:04,749
Rym: Only my DMS are open.

470
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:21,477
Rym: Uh, however, if you want to hang out with us, remember there is a GeekNights, discord and the GeekNights forum, and I'm making a concerted effort to replace some percentage of the time I have clawed back into my life by not looking at Twitter anymore to look at the GeekNights, discord and the GeekNights forum.

471
00:33:21,818 --> 00:33:24,730
Rym: I've seen me replied a little more often than I have for the last couple of years.

472
00:33:25,593 --> 00:33:28,203
Scott: Also, you know, contacting us is not hard.

473
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:32,036
Rym: We're like I'm Rym at frontrowcrew.com a pressure for like that.

474
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:33,100
Rym: That works.

475
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,243
Scott: YouTube, YouTube.

476
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:35,629
Scott: Does YouTube still have a DM system?

477
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:41,993
Rym: I am way more likely to read an email than any other means of contacting me, especially if you don't know me.

478
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:43,077
Scott: Of course.

479
00:33:43,157 --> 00:33:45,771
Scott: But the point is, is that there's like this Reddit DMS.

480
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:46,856
Scott: You're like, you can find us.

481
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:48,122
Scott: It's not hard if you know how to internet.

482
00:33:48,543 --> 00:33:48,744
Rym: Yup.

483
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:56,512
Rym: I am trying to studiously flag anything that automates tweets to not let people reply to them just in case.

484
00:33:56,573 --> 00:34:06,350
Rym: I don't want like weird racist stuff to appear in the mentions, but if you still use Twitter and you see weird racist shit like attached to anything I tweet automatically, let me know.

485
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,600
Rym: I will go clean that up at least for a while.

486
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,226
Rym: We'll see how Twitter even goes anyway.

487
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:22,315
Scott: Anyway, so Beetlejuice, when we were six years old in 1988, Tim Burton, the director of movies and other creative things, right?

488
00:34:22,636 --> 00:34:23,719
Scott: Infamous person.

489
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:39,600
Scott: We're not talking about, you know, his life much, but he had just become semi-famous thanks to Peewee's Big Adventure, which was already at that time as a child, one of my favorite movies ever.

490
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:40,701
Rym: Yup.

491
00:34:40,902 --> 00:34:42,527
Rym: I love the shit out of Peewee.

492
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:49,612
Rym: When I was a kid, I watched the show and that movie was another situation, which is very relevant to Beetlejuice.

493
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,440
Rym: That's why I'm telling this anecdote.

494
00:34:52,263 --> 00:34:58,780
Rym: As a kid, I did not pick up on the fact that Peewee's Big Adventure was a comedy.

495
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:04,074
Rym: I saw it as the serious movie that paired with the TV show.

496
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:11,845
Rym: that was silly because they stole his bike and he's trying to get it back and there was Large Marge and it just felt like a serious adventure if he has to get his bike back.

497
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:14,131
Scott: Yup, exactly.

498
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:17,741
Scott: So, Tim Burton, having had a success, right?

499
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:20,656
Scott: Hollywood, you know, that's how they did, especially back then.

500
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:21,420
Scott: It's still how they do.

501
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,554
Scott: Once a thing is a hit, they're like, okay, more of that, please.

502
00:35:24,594 --> 00:35:27,126
Scott: We're not going to take risks on someone new and we already got a hit.

503
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,834
Scott: Let's see if they can keep making hits, right?

504
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:32,367
Scott: And they set Tim Burton loose and that was the height of Tim Burton, right?

505
00:35:32,387 --> 00:35:37,364
Scott: He went off and he did some, you know, Batman '89.

506
00:35:37,725 --> 00:35:39,592
Scott: He did some Nightmare Before Christmas shit.

507
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:42,943
Rym: Batman '89 is my second favorite Batman movie.

508
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:46,213
Scott: Yeah, so he just went off, right?

509
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:51,329
Scott: And, you know, Beetlejuice was like, it's like, you know, the first step was Peewee.

510
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:57,111
Scott: The second step was Beetlejuice and he was at the peak and he plateaued, but that plateau was high, right?

511
00:35:57,131 --> 00:35:59,080
Scott: And he just kept cranking out the hits for a while.

512
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,564
Scott: And where is he now?

513
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:01,468
Scott: I don't know.

514
00:36:01,508 --> 00:36:02,171
Scott: What's he doing now?

515
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,983
Rym: Yeah, he feels like he has turned into a one-trick pony.

516
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:07,473
Scott: He's not where he was then is the point.

517
00:36:07,513 --> 00:36:11,567
Rym: But regardless, I saw one of the last tweets I saw with someone saying, you know what?

518
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:18,005
Rym: It's really good that Beetlejuice got made before he encountered his current milieu.

519
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:29,110
Scott: Yeah, so Beetlejuice, this one movie, just this one comedy, you know, movie came out in 1988.

520
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,734
Scott: It didn't, right?

521
00:36:31,195 --> 00:36:41,145
Scott: And it was just a stand, like, a standalone comedy movie that didn't have anything else really going on became, like, a big intellectual property.

522
00:36:41,205 --> 00:36:45,460
Scott: Not on the Star Wars level, not on the Indiana Jones level, right?

523
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,652
Scott: But, like, on a somewhat surprising level.

524
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:50,996
Rym: I mean, one, it got a cartoon.

525
00:36:51,658 --> 00:36:53,263
Rym: Like, weirdly, I like a pretty big cartoon.

526
00:36:53,283 --> 00:36:57,560
Scott: There were cartoons, there was clothing, action figures, merchandising.

527
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:05,743
Rym: But it was also, it was one of those things that literally everyone in America knew of, had seen, and had opinions about.

528
00:37:05,763 --> 00:37:12,020
Scott: Yeah, and not only did it become a thing, right, it sort of stayed a thing.

529
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,254
Scott: I'd say it's on maybe, like, the Robocop level, right?

530
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:16,379
Scott: That's about the level it's at.

531
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:18,864
Rym: I mean, the musical apparently is back again.

532
00:37:18,884 --> 00:37:20,166
Rym: Again?

533
00:37:20,227 --> 00:37:20,868
Scott: I thought it was gone.

534
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:28,023
Scott: I saw a poster in the cancel.

535
00:37:28,043 --> 00:37:28,787
Scott: We'll have to look it up.

536
00:37:28,888 --> 00:37:31,261
Rym: I mean, it premiered in 2018, so I'm pretty sure it came back.

537
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:36,743
Rym: Yep, it reopened at the Marquis Theater in Broadway in April of this year and is scheduled to close next year.

538
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:38,390
Rym: It is ongoing right now.

539
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,655
Scott: Okay, it's gonna close soon.

540
00:37:39,976 --> 00:37:41,301
Rym: I've heard it's terrible, so.

541
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:42,145
Scott: Yeah, right.

542
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:51,818
Scott: But the point is, this intellectual property of this one movie that, right, was significant enough that it became, it's still a thing, right?

543
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:57,700
Scott: And I think as long as people who are alive in 1988 are still alive, it will still be a thing, right?

544
00:37:58,922 --> 00:38:04,349
Scott: I mean, you think about it, you know, that's sort of a pattern for Tim Burton besides the Batman, which is not something he made, right?

545
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:06,460
Scott: It's like Nightmare Before Christmas was just one movie.

546
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:17,922
Scott: It didn't even have a TV show as far as I know or anything else, but every single fucking Halloween, there's like half the Halloween decorations are actually Nightmare Before Christmas decorations, right?

547
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,698
Scott: It's like, you know, you can't, you can't escape the Jack Skellington.

548
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:22,822
Scott: He's everywhere, right?

549
00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:25,691
Rym: Yep, but like Beetlejuice was, is such a good movie.

550
00:38:26,132 --> 00:38:29,764
Rym: I have seen it at least a dozen times, like my family.

551
00:38:29,865 --> 00:38:33,518
Scott: It's been quite a while since I've seen it, but I saw it many times.

552
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:47,373
Rym: It's one of those movies that I think I have almost memorized just from being a kid and watching it over and over again because it was in that era when I was a kid and would watch movies that I liked over and over again, but I think I know every beat of this fucking movie.

553
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:48,377
Scott: Yep.

554
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:50,524
Scott: Well, I mean, when I was a kid, right?

555
00:38:50,604 --> 00:38:51,908
Scott: Six years old, come on, right?

556
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:52,209
Scott: Yeah.

557
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:58,532
Scott: It's like that movie was really, there were, you know, like a lot of it goes over your head, right?

558
00:38:58,592 --> 00:38:59,958
Scott: Adult jokes and things like that.

559
00:38:59,998 --> 00:39:05,617
Rym: But also it was another movie where as a kid, I saw it as a 100% straight horror movie.

560
00:39:05,717 --> 00:39:06,700
Rym: It was not a comedy.

561
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,943
Rym: It was just scary.

562
00:39:08,525 --> 00:39:09,307
Scott: Yep, exactly.

563
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:17,274
Scott: But the things that, you know, really appealed to me about that movie when I was a kid were, you know, the fun parts.

564
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:21,247
Scott: And they were like, there's really just like three major fun parts of the movie, right?

565
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:24,296
Scott: Sandworm parts, right?

566
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:24,697
Scott: Dune.

567
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:27,749
Scott: I don't know if it was a Dune reference or not, but Sandworm parts.

568
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:30,060
Rym: There's no way that was not a Dune reference.

569
00:39:30,742 --> 00:39:31,063
Scott: Yeah.

570
00:39:31,765 --> 00:39:35,495
Scott: Calypso dance around the dining room table part.

571
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:38,725
Rym: My brother and I would sing that song over and over and over again.

572
00:39:38,765 --> 00:39:44,506
Scott: That song, it's like the same way that Wayne's World made Bohemian Rhapsody a thing, right?

573
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:45,108
Scott: Again.

574
00:39:45,128 --> 00:39:45,189
Scott: Yep.

575
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:50,629
Rym: Again, if you didn't say again, that would have been a terrifying statement, but it brought it back.

576
00:39:51,372 --> 00:40:03,300
Scott: But, I mean, there were a lot of people who, you know, were younger and didn't, you know, weren't there for Bohemian rap for, you know, a lot of people discovered Queen and Bohemian Rhapsody because of Wayne's World.

577
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,021
Scott: Right.

578
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:06,313
Scott: It's like, I was six years old.

579
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:09,082
Scott: I didn't fucking know, right?

580
00:40:10,245 --> 00:40:13,635
Scott: Anything about, you know, Calypso music or bananas, right?

581
00:40:13,756 --> 00:40:16,043
Scott: When I was, it was Harry Belafonte, right?

582
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:16,664
Scott: I think, yeah.

583
00:40:17,828 --> 00:40:19,533
Scott: Anyway, pretty sure that's who it is.

584
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:24,350
Scott: Anyway, but I didn't know that song until Beetlejuice came out, right?

585
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:28,108
Scott: And it's like, but now I think it was our first grade, second grade or something like that.

586
00:40:28,149 --> 00:40:29,979
Scott: We were just, we were all over that song, right?

587
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:31,786
Scott: It was on repeat, thanks to that movie.

588
00:40:32,448 --> 00:40:37,748
Scott: But it also, and then the third, the third fun part of the movie is the end, right?

589
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:41,123
Scott: Where Beetlejuice is like turning into all sorts of ridiculous shit, right?

590
00:40:41,183 --> 00:40:43,856
Scott: It's like, you know, as a kid, you know, the wedding scene, right?

591
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:45,583
Scott: So that was very memorable.

592
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:57,451
Scott: And, you know, the earlier parts of the movie, you know, only had a few sort of really out there scenes, like, you know, when he goes to the afterlife and there's, you know, messed up shit there and whatnot, right?

593
00:40:57,471 --> 00:41:07,014
Scott: You know, I guess a lot of the movie is just humans talking to each other, but the humans talking to each other, this is a confluence of, it takes place entirely in one house.

594
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:09,302
Scott: There's no scenes outside the house, really.

595
00:41:09,462 --> 00:41:20,140
Rym: Well, other than the very beginning and this and the sandworms, but there is kind of outside the house kind of, it was an all star cast with fantastic writing and fantastic acting.

596
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:30,931
Rym: The humor, when it's not the crazy stuff Scott was describing, is so understated and just like, it's the exact kind of dialogue driven humor that I love.

597
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:34,263
Rym: This movie trusts the audience to get all these little jokes.

598
00:41:34,504 --> 00:41:37,317
Rym: And even if you miss all of them, the movie is still enjoyable.

599
00:41:37,337 --> 00:41:37,839
Rym: Right.

600
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:52,332
Scott: And that's the thing is it's not one of those movies that has a type of humor that only appeals to a certain demographic, like maybe like an Austin Powers one is like so many like, you know, penis jokes for the teenagers, right?

601
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:55,344
Scott: Or the, you know, the Adam Sandler, you know, appealing to just the kids.

602
00:41:55,365 --> 00:42:03,974
Rym: This is the movie that me and my little brother, who was like four, watch with our parents and our grandparents and friends of the family.

603
00:42:04,475 --> 00:42:04,656
Scott: Right.

604
00:42:04,716 --> 00:42:06,542
Scott: It's also a timeless humor.

605
00:42:06,643 --> 00:42:10,639
Scott: It's not like celebrity jokes or jokes about the eighties or anything.

606
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:12,065
Scott: It's like, you could watch this now.

607
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:13,170
Rym: Oh, the, the villains.

608
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:18,831
Rym: And I still say the villains are that family that moved into the house, except Lydia, especially uncle Otho.

609
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:24,630
Rym: That is the same archetype of a terrible yuppie family that would work.

610
00:42:24,671 --> 00:42:28,524
Scott: Those kinds of the kinds of people, those kinds of people are still a thing.

611
00:42:28,645 --> 00:42:28,946
Scott: Yeah.

612
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:29,970
Rym: They haven't changed.

613
00:42:30,793 --> 00:42:31,014
Scott: Yeah.

614
00:42:31,054 --> 00:42:41,251
Scott: Even like the same scenario, other than the technology of like, you know, old telephones and things like that and no cell phones and old CRT TVs and things like that that are in the movie.

615
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,719
Scott: It's a timeless movie, right?

616
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:46,109
Scott: It's like, you know, human nature and whatnot.

617
00:42:46,129 --> 00:42:46,892
Rym: And then what do you got?

618
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:47,796
Rym: those got a family?

619
00:42:48,037 --> 00:42:48,539
Rym: They die.

620
00:42:48,559 --> 00:43:04,398
Rym: They basically go to a bureaucratic hell and become ghosts separately, dipshit, like yuppie gentrifiers by a house, like out away from the city and decide to destroy its character and make it a horrible, like white person's vision of how rich people live while making their terrible art.

621
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:08,310
Rym: They have a goth daughter who hates that shit and hates living there.

622
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:15,833
Rym: And then they hire an evil demon lawyer that even hell has kicked out and hijinks ensue.

623
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:16,896
Rym: Like, that's the movie.

624
00:43:17,939 --> 00:43:18,079
Scott: Yeah.

625
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,811
Scott: I mean, it's also sort of a, you know, like a story.

626
00:43:23,072 --> 00:43:25,939
Scott: It's not a story about, you know, like divorce.

627
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,527
Scott: No one actually gets divorced right in this movie.

628
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:34,386
Scott: But you still, you know, you know, it's that scenario where the child, right?

629
00:43:34,426 --> 00:43:35,610
Scott: Lydia, right?

630
00:43:35,951 --> 00:43:39,161
Scott: Is like, you know, there's her real biological parents, right?

631
00:43:39,503 --> 00:43:45,122
Scott: But she's like, actually these two ghosts who I've known for five minutes are better parents, right?

632
00:43:45,202 --> 00:43:55,222
Rym: It actually is a really, it's a story to a degree about found family, but also how just because someone helped you out once does not mean they should necessarily be included in your found family.

633
00:43:55,463 --> 00:43:57,794
Rym: Beetlejuice is a piece of shit and you cannot forget that.

634
00:43:57,895 --> 00:44:00,084
Scott: Well, Beetlejuice is not part of the found family.

635
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:00,787
Rym: He wants to be.

636
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,200
Scott: No, Lydia and the two ghost people are the found family.

637
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,789
Rym: Yeah, Beetlejuice tries to worm his way in there though.

638
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:07,913
Scott: Right, right.

639
00:44:07,933 --> 00:44:12,151
Scott: And Rym already talked about how, you know, the all-star cast of this movie, right?

640
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:13,899
Scott: Winona Ryder and whatnot, right?

641
00:44:13,939 --> 00:44:17,068
Scott: But, you know, Michael Keaton, right?

642
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,495
Scott: This guy at this time, right?

643
00:44:19,936 --> 00:44:23,045
Scott: It's like, that was like the peak of his stardom-ness, right?

644
00:44:23,065 --> 00:44:24,490
Scott: He kept working with Tim Burton.

645
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:33,457
Rym: Dude plays Batman in the first serious attempt at a Batman movie since Adam West, the year after Beetlejuice, right?

646
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:41,066
Scott: So, I mean, you know, his name sort of, I guess, at least from my perspective, like, you know, kind of inspires chuckles a little bit, right?

647
00:44:41,106 --> 00:44:46,284
Scott: It's like, he's not taken seriously as like, you know, some great actor, right?

648
00:44:46,665 --> 00:44:49,272
Scott: But it's like, watch this movie, right?

649
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:50,615
Scott: And watch Batman.

650
00:44:50,656 --> 00:44:52,842
Scott: It's like, look at the range on this guy.

651
00:44:52,902 --> 00:44:56,357
Scott: It's like Michael Keaton was getting these starring roles in the late 80s, early 90s.

652
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:58,803
Rym: Mr.

653
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:03,356
Rym: Mom, which a movie as a kid I love, Johnny Dangerously, right?

654
00:45:03,697 --> 00:45:06,487
Scott: It's like, people might go, haha, you know, Michael Keaton, right?

655
00:45:06,507 --> 00:45:10,362
Scott: And not think of him as like some high-brow Shakespearean dude, right?

656
00:45:10,744 --> 00:45:13,814
Scott: But it's like, no, Michael Keaton can act really well.

657
00:45:13,995 --> 00:45:17,065
Scott: It's like, he's extremely talented individual, right?

658
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:18,690
Scott: You know, I don't know.

659
00:45:19,212 --> 00:45:23,787
Scott: It's like, the thing is, it's like, you know, I don't know a lot of celebrity people, right?

660
00:45:24,047 --> 00:45:26,255
Scott: But I know who that is, which is rare.

661
00:45:26,336 --> 00:45:31,616
Rym: That is notable that you know the name of a celebrity and know more than like one thing about them.

662
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:36,490
Scott: Well, it's like, I know the movies that he was in that I saw, right?

663
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:40,000
Scott: And I knew that he was good in those movies.

664
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:49,862
Scott: And, you know, I know, at least I think I know what people think of him, but I don't know anything about like his life or what he's doing now or what kind of person he is or anything like that.

665
00:45:49,922 --> 00:45:52,412
Scott: You know, he might, I don't know.

666
00:45:52,432 --> 00:45:53,597
Rym: What's he doing nowadays?

667
00:45:53,637 --> 00:45:54,079
Scott: Sleeping?

668
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:54,320
Scott: Working?

669
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,442
Rym: He's working.

670
00:45:55,482 --> 00:45:56,425
Rym: He's in a bunch of stuff.

671
00:45:57,147 --> 00:45:58,010
Rym: All right.

672
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,214
Rym: He's also done voice acting.

673
00:45:59,334 --> 00:46:00,277
Rym: Like, he does a lot.

674
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:07,662
Scott: Yeah, but you know, it's like, you know, people look at like, you know, the kind of movie he's in, right?

675
00:46:07,702 --> 00:46:08,867
Scott: Like, you know, we mentioned a Mr.

676
00:46:08,907 --> 00:46:10,334
Scott: Mom or a Beetlejuice.

677
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:10,856
Rym: You don't know Mr.

678
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:10,956
Rym: Mom?

679
00:46:13,101 --> 00:46:13,624
Scott: I know what it is.

680
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:17,882
Rym: Okay, just making sure, because that movie, no one younger than us has ever heard of that movie.

681
00:46:18,063 --> 00:46:18,244
Rym: Right.

682
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,860
Scott: I'm just pointing out that it's not like some highbrow kind of role, right?

683
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:22,261
Scott: Yeah.

684
00:46:22,382 --> 00:46:27,903
Scott: So it's like, you know, because he's not in like some serious Oscar-winning type roles, right?

685
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:33,424
Scott: You know, you sort of, you know, he's not treated, you know, as a serious type, but it's like, look at it.

686
00:46:33,564 --> 00:46:35,956
Scott: It's like, let's see you go act like Beetlejuice, right?

687
00:46:35,976 --> 00:46:38,708
Scott: It's like, if someone else was the Beetlejuice, right?

688
00:46:38,949 --> 00:46:40,918
Scott: You would be like, ah, not as good as the original.

689
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:42,062
Scott: It's like, yeah, of course, right?

690
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:45,873
Scott: It's really hard to do that.

691
00:46:46,815 --> 00:46:50,865
Rym: But I guess, let's see, well, like the things Beetlejuice, what it got right?

692
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:55,799
Rym: is it like sort of juxtaposed this ridiculous scenery.

693
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:01,236
Rym: Like, you got to talk about the sets in this movie feel like a like a stage play.

694
00:47:01,357 --> 00:47:06,852
Rym: Everything's exaggerated and tall and gothic and weird and looming.

695
00:47:07,173 --> 00:47:13,474
Rym: Not just the hell world, but like the yuppies are making their own hell world with this house, right?

696
00:47:13,494 --> 00:47:15,643
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, it's, that's the Tim Burton, right?

697
00:47:15,704 --> 00:47:19,942
Scott: It's like, so Tim, prior to this, you know, the Peewee's Big Adventure, right?

698
00:47:20,343 --> 00:47:25,737
Scott: You know, it had, you know, the Tim Burton sort of pacing and structure, right?

699
00:47:26,038 --> 00:47:32,019
Scott: But it didn't have the visual aesthetic of Tim Burton, which I've been to a Tim Burton museum exhibit.

700
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:32,541
Scott: And it's like.

701
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:38,283
Scott: that aesthetic did exist prior to that, but it wasn't really in Peewee's Big Adventure that much, right?

702
00:47:38,344 --> 00:47:39,608
Scott: It was subtle, right?

703
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:52,195
Scott: But here he was finally able to take like his personal, you know, like the kinds of things that he was drawing or doing on his own, his own personal aesthetic and put it right onto the Hollywood big screen, right?

704
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:58,903
Scott: And when it succeeded with Beetlejuice, he was able to then sort of, you know, he then had the permission to just keep doing that.

705
00:47:59,786 --> 00:48:02,718
Scott: And that's when you started seeing, you know, the Edward Scissorhands.

706
00:48:02,778 --> 00:48:08,644
Scott: and it's like, you put the Edward Scissorhands, you know, just, you could take still frames from that and put it up next to Beetlejuice.

707
00:48:09,106 --> 00:48:16,359
Scott: And even somebody who didn't know who Tim Burton was would think that those are like in the same movie or paintings by the same artist or whatever, right?

708
00:48:16,379 --> 00:48:22,060
Scott: Because he established his aesthetic with the public and then carried it forward from there, right?

709
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,406
Scott: But Beetlejuice was the first one.

710
00:48:23,426 --> 00:48:26,740
Scott: That's where he, it wasn't the first one that was in that style.

711
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,761
Scott: It was the first one in that style from him with the public, people seeing it, identifying him with that.

712
00:48:33,404 --> 00:48:35,753
Rym: And you definitely got this parallelism in the movie of like.

713
00:48:36,175 --> 00:48:47,593
Rym: the set in the real world is becoming increasingly nightmarish in parallel with seeing the literal hellish afterlife in like the, like the, like the literal afterlife, that book and everything.

714
00:48:47,613 --> 00:48:50,644
Scott: And at the very end of the movie, spoilers, right?

715
00:48:50,664 --> 00:48:52,589
Scott: They set the house back to normal.

716
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,636
Scott: Yeah.

717
00:48:54,696 --> 00:49:04,086
Rym: And you'll have that like ridiculous nonsense juxtaposed with like really meek one-liners and like totally mundane conversations among regular people.

718
00:49:05,711 --> 00:49:07,477
Rym: As a kid, I wasn't afraid of Beetlejuice.

719
00:49:07,497 --> 00:49:08,961
Rym: I was afraid of Uncle Otho.

720
00:49:09,122 --> 00:49:12,070
Rym: He actually was the one who I was scared of as a kid.

721
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:18,189
Scott: I don't know if I was scared of any individual character.

722
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:21,601
Rym: Someone like Otho would scare me today, but for very different reasons.

723
00:49:22,123 --> 00:49:26,660
Scott: But, well, yeah, but I mean, I think I was just scared of the, the situation, right?

724
00:49:27,942 --> 00:49:29,669
Rym: You know, weirdly as a kid, cause I was into ghosts.

725
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,100
Rym: I was, I was excited about the situation.

726
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,918
Rym: Beetlejuice seemed like a cool demon to make a deal with if you were careful about it.

727
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,443
Rym: And like, they kind of messed that up.

728
00:49:38,845 --> 00:49:40,852
Rym: Like I basically saw everything is cool.

729
00:49:40,932 --> 00:49:46,591
Rym: And Uncle Otho was like the evil guy who is using this power for the wrong purposes.

730
00:49:47,113 --> 00:49:47,273
Scott: Yeah.

731
00:49:47,975 --> 00:49:59,250
Scott: I think the last thing, you know, about the movie specifically is that, you know, in terms of, I guess, representation of a teenager with a, you know, a goth aesthetic, right.

732
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,677
Scott: On the Hollywood screen, right.

733
00:50:01,717 --> 00:50:12,347
Scott: It's like prior to that, you know, any sort of goth kids were, you know, put, you know, in, in TV or movies were showed as like, you know, bad delinquent outcast type kids.

734
00:50:12,547 --> 00:50:13,209
Scott: Yeah.

735
00:50:13,269 --> 00:50:14,150
Rym: Lydia's just cool.

736
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:14,391
Scott: Right.

737
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:15,092
Scott: Right.

738
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:22,131
Scott: It's the clothing, the dark makeup, et cetera.

739
00:50:22,492 --> 00:50:22,853
Scott: Right.

740
00:50:23,034 --> 00:50:24,500
Scott: And sort of the teenage attitude.

741
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:32,263
Scott: But she's the only one with like, you know, a decent head on her shoulders in like the whole fricking movie.

742
00:50:32,323 --> 00:50:32,564
Scott: Right.

743
00:50:32,584 --> 00:50:35,033
Rym: Because the ghosts don't know what's going on.

744
00:50:35,274 --> 00:50:35,676
Rym: Right.

745
00:50:35,716 --> 00:50:36,037
Rym: Right.

746
00:50:36,057 --> 00:50:36,640
Rym: Dipshit.

747
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:43,447
Scott: The whole fact that the nice, the nice, the nice ghost people, the, you know, the, the people who become better parents, even though they're dead.

748
00:50:43,467 --> 00:50:44,090
Scott: Right.

749
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,817
Scott: It's like, they're clueless though.

750
00:50:46,018 --> 00:50:46,199
Scott: Right.

751
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:47,222
Scott: And, and meek.

752
00:50:47,624 --> 00:50:47,884
Scott: Right.

753
00:50:48,085 --> 00:50:49,469
Scott: Beetlejuice is just bad.

754
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:52,499
Scott: Her at her biological family is awful.

755
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:52,780
Scott: Right.

756
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,448
Scott: And she's like the only common sense person.

757
00:50:55,949 --> 00:50:56,190
Scott: Right.

758
00:50:56,471 --> 00:51:00,402
Scott: But yet, uh, you know, these other people, right.

759
00:51:00,543 --> 00:51:03,693
Scott: Or like wearing more normal type clothing.

760
00:51:03,954 --> 00:51:04,295
Scott: Right.

761
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:05,719
Scott: Or at least somewhat more normal.

762
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:06,883
Rym: They're the real monsters.

763
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:07,846
Scott: Right.

764
00:51:07,906 --> 00:51:23,733
Scott: It's like, whereas she, who has, you know, the, the visual aesthetic of being some, you know, goth type outsider actually is the most normal put together human being or person or ghost or monster, whatever in the whole, the whole show.

765
00:51:23,953 --> 00:51:34,040
Rym: So, which makes it extra weird when they made a hundred episode long Beetlejuice animated TV series that was wildly popular.

766
00:51:34,622 --> 00:51:42,282
Rym: But in that one, Beetlejuice is a protagonist and has given Lydia powers and they go on adventures in hell.

767
00:51:43,105 --> 00:51:43,366
Scott: Yeah.

768
00:51:43,386 --> 00:51:52,295
Scott: So basically what goes on in that cartoon, which I, I never, I didn't watch it a bunch, but I watched like the entire, I know how to watch the whole thing, but it's not that good.

769
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,148
Rym: It is not worth watching to a modern.

770
00:51:56,228 --> 00:51:59,119
Scott: It wasn't one that I turned on on purpose, right?

771
00:51:59,139 --> 00:52:00,605
Scott: Where like, Ooh, it's on, let's go watch it.

772
00:52:00,645 --> 00:52:06,373
Scott: It was one where if it was on before or after or happened to be on, or I flipped through the channels and there it was, I'd watch it.

773
00:52:06,614 --> 00:52:06,916
Scott: Right.

774
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:12,260
Scott: It was that level, but yeah, it's like, they're like, Hey, the kids love that Beetlejuice movie.

775
00:52:12,681 --> 00:52:12,862
Scott: Right.

776
00:52:12,902 --> 00:52:14,187
Scott: But there's no other stuff.

777
00:52:14,489 --> 00:52:14,770
Scott: Right.

778
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:17,561
Scott: You know, we're not going to make a live action TV show.

779
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:19,107
Scott: That's too expensive for 1988.

780
00:52:19,107 --> 00:52:21,457
Scott: Tim Burton's busy making a Batman.

781
00:52:21,477 --> 00:52:22,782
Scott: We can't get him to do anything.

782
00:52:23,264 --> 00:52:23,545
Scott: Right.

783
00:52:23,846 --> 00:52:28,525
Scott: But this is somehow popular with the kids, even though it was a movie with like, you know, strip club jokes.

784
00:52:28,566 --> 00:52:28,967
Rym: It's funny.

785
00:52:29,168 --> 00:52:37,381
Rym: somehow popular with the kids was definitely a thing through like the mid eighties, like lady, like 82, 83 through like 91.

786
00:52:37,381 --> 00:52:41,941
Rym: There were a lot of things that the whole world was like, wait, why do kids even know what Robocop is?

787
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:43,085
Scott: Yeah.

788
00:52:44,209 --> 00:52:49,188
Scott: I guess we got to make a Robocop cartoon, which I mean, I think that was, you know, I think, you know, we could talk about how.

789
00:52:49,229 --> 00:52:51,097
Scott: maybe a joke, Joe camel, right.

790
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:55,955
Scott: But it was perhaps intentional on the parts of some corporate overlords in those times.

791
00:52:56,056 --> 00:52:56,216
Scott: Right.

792
00:52:56,798 --> 00:53:00,672
Scott: But anyway, uh, you know, so they made this animated show.

793
00:53:00,692 --> 00:53:08,200
Scott: I don't, I'm sure I could Google and find out the history of who pitched it and how it was made and why it was made, but it lasted a long time.

794
00:53:08,581 --> 00:53:10,930
Scott: There are a lot of episodes and it's not good.

795
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:15,388
Scott: I mean, I think it's, you know, I don't have to watch it in a long time, so I don't know.

796
00:53:15,588 --> 00:53:21,280
Rym: Well, even as a kid, it felt like a cynical catch grab because they added all these extra characters who were completely one note.

797
00:53:21,821 --> 00:53:28,701
Rym: And it was just, it was like this episodic nothing show with like one liner jokes and bad voice acting.

798
00:53:29,565 --> 00:53:34,705
Scott: It was definitely this kind of thing where if you're a kid, even as a kid who is six, seven, eight years old, right?

799
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:36,071
Scott: Less than 10.

800
00:53:36,071 --> 00:53:44,745
Scott: It's like you saw the real Beetlejuice movie and you watch that and you liked it and you're turn on this cartoon and you're upset because even a kid, right?

801
00:53:44,765 --> 00:53:45,087
Scott: I don't know.

802
00:53:45,107 --> 00:53:46,634
Scott: The adults underestimate the kids.

803
00:53:46,775 --> 00:53:50,649
Scott: Even a kid can tell that that is not, that's not right.

804
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:52,876
Scott: Beetlejuice is the wrong voice, right?

805
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:53,639
Scott: That's not him.

806
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:54,923
Scott: That's not how he acts.

807
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,276
Scott: They're living in the house somehow, right?

808
00:53:59,356 --> 00:54:01,524
Scott: But they don't really spend any time in the house.

809
00:54:01,584 --> 00:54:02,668
Scott: It's like every episode.

810
00:54:03,009 --> 00:54:08,768
Scott: they go to the hell world, which is nothing like the hell world in the movie at all.

811
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:15,830
Scott: It's like some big, like, you know, open terrain that has a circus tent or like some houses and other.

812
00:54:16,051 --> 00:54:24,317
Rym: It felt hollow like the Mario Brothers cartoons felt hollow and that they were like, they had the barest surface details and that was it.

813
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:25,280
Scott: Yeah.

814
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:30,407
Scott: And it's like there was some interesting designs for some of the monster characters that were, you know, living in the hell world.

815
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:32,700
Scott: Like wasn't there a guy who was like just legs or something?

816
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,824
Scott: You know what?

817
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:38,462
Rym: A lot of them were a lot like the Ghostbusters monsters from the Ghostbusters cartoon.

818
00:54:38,763 --> 00:54:42,899
Rym: And there was a French skeleton guy that had like terrible jokes, but he was a funny.

819
00:54:43,059 --> 00:54:43,420
Scott: Oh yeah.

820
00:54:43,461 --> 00:54:44,363
Scott: The French skeleton.

821
00:54:44,383 --> 00:54:45,085
Scott: Yeah.

822
00:54:45,105 --> 00:54:46,008
Rym: It's coming back now.

823
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:46,970
Rym: Yeah.

824
00:54:47,031 --> 00:54:48,033
Scott: I forgot about him.

825
00:54:49,538 --> 00:55:00,410
Rym: But, uh, it was just as a kid, it was weird to me, but my little kid head cannon was, I guess Lydia, like, Oh, there was the cowboy guy.

826
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:01,413
Scott: He wasn't just legs.

827
00:55:01,554 --> 00:55:04,163
Scott: He was like a rip up of the Looney Tunes red guy.

828
00:55:05,587 --> 00:55:11,929
Rym: I just kind of assumed that Lydia like learned dark magic and I don't know, castrated or lobotomized Beetlejuice.

829
00:55:12,049 --> 00:55:15,704
Rym: And like that was just like, he was just this demon at under her control now.

830
00:55:15,765 --> 00:55:22,690
Rym: Like that's kind of how I saw it because that Beetlejuice is nothing like the absolute piece of shit that is Beetlejuice in Beetlejuice.

831
00:55:23,532 --> 00:55:23,773
Scott: Yeah.

832
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:29,395
Scott: I mean, you know, he wasn't in the cartoon and he wasn't like, you know, in the movie he was a bad guy.

833
00:55:29,436 --> 00:55:30,701
Scott: He was up to no good, right?

834
00:55:31,163 --> 00:55:36,744
Scott: In the cartoon, he's like slightly mischievous and naughty, but he is clearly a good guy.

835
00:55:36,764 --> 00:55:39,152
Scott: A hundred percent on Lydia's side, right?

836
00:55:39,534 --> 00:55:43,491
Scott: You know, they're, they're together in conflicts on the same team, right?

837
00:55:43,571 --> 00:55:43,692
Rym: Yeah.

838
00:55:43,712 --> 00:55:47,888
Rym: Not like the movie where he was a predator worming his way into her life against her will.

839
00:55:48,671 --> 00:55:48,952
Scott: Yeah.

840
00:55:49,172 --> 00:55:50,296
Scott: Completely different.

841
00:55:50,376 --> 00:55:50,657
Scott: Anyway.

842
00:55:50,677 --> 00:55:53,430
Scott: So then there was a musical that I haven't seen and know nothing about.

843
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:56,082
Rym: So I'm going to read, cause I read a little bit about it.

844
00:55:56,282 --> 00:55:59,192
Rym: and Oh, there was a review that said something great.

845
00:55:59,252 --> 00:56:05,836
Scott: I presume it's just a re like a, the movie only live and with singing what everyone has said about it.

846
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:07,742
Rym: Like collectively the critics seem to agree.

847
00:56:07,762 --> 00:56:14,981
Rym: It feels like a, an amusement park ride that you don't move and it just happens on stage.

848
00:56:15,061 --> 00:56:16,826
Rym: It's just a bunch of shit happens.

849
00:56:17,187 --> 00:56:28,420
Rym: The end like big set pieces and shit moving around in a ridiculous set and like nonsense flying out over the crowd and animatronics and all this crap.

850
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,510
Rym: But like, no one seems to have anything else to say about it.

851
00:56:33,497 --> 00:56:33,738
Scott: All right.

852
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:35,828
Scott: So I don't know if it's any, it's going away soon anyway.

853
00:56:35,888 --> 00:56:41,911
Scott: So I mean, I don't think it's, you know, but the thing that's noteworthy about it is that it exists in the year 2022, right?

854
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:47,226
Scott: This property of, of this character from this one lousy movie.

855
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:52,101
Scott: Well, one good movie, but just one movie spawned this whole nonsense, right?

856
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:58,216
Scott: There hasn't even been a Beetlejuice two movie or any like nothing, right?

857
00:56:58,237 --> 00:57:01,104
Scott: So fun show musical merchandise.

858
00:57:01,144 --> 00:57:07,962
Rym: There have been like four or five earnest attempts to make a sequel to Beetlejuice.

859
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:15,360
Rym: The Tim Burton tried to get one going in 1990 titled Beetlejuice goes Hawaiian.

860
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:18,691
Scott: And that sounds like a very nineties sequel to me.

861
00:57:18,711 --> 00:57:21,320
Rym: And they really tried to make it happen.

862
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:23,366
Rym: And they got the actors involved.

863
00:57:23,687 --> 00:57:28,924
Rym: And, uh, basically then Keaton was like, uh, are we doing Batman returns?

864
00:57:29,005 --> 00:57:30,230
Rym: And then they did Batman instead.

865
00:57:30,592 --> 00:57:32,781
Scott: They kept trying to make more money with the Batman.

866
00:57:32,821 --> 00:57:40,984
Rym: I think as, so as recently as February of 2022, they are currently filming an untitled Beetlejuice sequel.

867
00:57:41,907 --> 00:57:47,086
Rym: is Michael Keaton in it with Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder, quote, reprising their roles.

868
00:57:47,428 --> 00:57:49,460
Rym: Principal photography is apparently ongoing.

869
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,205
Rym: Uh, I have zero faith.

870
00:57:51,226 --> 00:57:52,512
Rym: This will come out directing it.

871
00:57:53,156 --> 00:57:53,819
Rym: I don't know.

872
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,243
Scott: Okay.

873
00:57:56,263 --> 00:57:58,214
Scott: Well, that's, is it like old man, Beetlejuice?

874
00:57:58,415 --> 00:57:59,400
Scott: That would be a thing, right?

875
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:04,578
Scott: If they did old man, Beetlejuice, the best part would be is old man, Beetlejuice.

876
00:58:04,618 --> 00:58:05,482
Rym: You play it straight.

877
00:58:05,502 --> 00:58:07,776
Rym: You get the, as much as the original cast as you can back.

878
00:58:07,816 --> 00:58:12,620
Scott: And like, you may be like, what if that piece of shit, you know, I mean, obviously, well, I guess he's like undead.

879
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,888
Scott: So it was like, does he really age?

880
00:58:14,109 --> 00:58:15,075
Scott: But you could just say he does.

881
00:58:15,175 --> 00:58:15,376
Scott: Right.

882
00:58:15,417 --> 00:58:19,070
Scott: Just be like, like, like a piece of shit, but he's really old and weak now.

883
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:19,752
Scott: Right.

884
00:58:20,154 --> 00:58:32,136
Scott: And you know, Lydia was there in, was that in that spot in life, a human who knows about the supernatural world and knows it's real and had ghost parents and grew up to be, you know, now a middle-aged woman.

885
00:58:32,156 --> 00:58:32,818
Scott: Right.

886
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:37,233
Scott: Um, and it's like, what would her life be like?

887
00:58:37,273 --> 00:58:39,782
Rym: They all, they all come back to like, deal with something.

888
00:58:40,365 --> 00:58:44,142
Scott: I think it would just be, I would think, you know, uh, Lydia, this is how I would write it.

889
00:58:44,182 --> 00:58:46,414
Scott: I don't know what the actual plot they've come up with is right.

890
00:58:46,474 --> 00:58:49,552
Scott: Is if you're going to do a C I think, see, I think a prequel would be better.

891
00:58:49,572 --> 00:58:55,778
Scott: We talked about this before the show, but if you're going to do the sequel, it's gotta be like, okay, Lydia is much older now.

892
00:58:56,019 --> 00:58:56,200
Scott: Right.

893
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:05,253
Scott: She had ghost parents and, but is now a normal functioning adult who doesn't talk about ghosts with people because obviously that doesn't work.

894
00:59:05,414 --> 00:59:05,595
Scott: Right.

895
00:59:05,615 --> 00:59:06,820
Scott: People are getting like, what's wrong with you?

896
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:11,573
Scott: Um, but she gets caught in some shit, some real world shit.

897
00:59:12,235 --> 00:59:14,100
Scott: And it's in such a tight spot.

898
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,312
Scott: She calls the Beetlejuice again and there it's really easy.

899
00:59:17,332 --> 00:59:17,814
Scott: Right.

900
00:59:18,035 --> 00:59:19,000
Rym: It would have to resolve.

901
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:25,265
Rym: The end would have to be, even though she knows the moral of the end would have to be, no, he's still a piece of shit.

902
00:59:25,386 --> 00:59:25,727
Rym: The end.

903
00:59:26,551 --> 00:59:26,813
Scott: Yes.

904
00:59:26,873 --> 00:59:28,260
Scott: That would have, you could never reform.
