1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,891
Rym: It's Wednesday, January 12th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:10,172
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:13,119
Scott: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,546
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:17,420
Rym: Tonight we are talking about Centaur World.

6
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:19,613
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:31,800
Rym: So, uh, I've been planning since basically the quarantine began to re- like to get a new membership to a rock climbing gym and start rock climbing again.

8
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:38,640
Rym: Uh, because in Long Island City, there are like three rock climbing gyms in this neighborhood, like big ones.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,900
Rym: And kind of like the thing we talked about with the chess places, like you'd think in a big city.

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,760
Scott: It's real popular.

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,280
Rym: People who compete with each other would like stay away from each other to go after customers.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,440
Rym: But no, you tend to get concentrations of a bunch of places that serve the exact same customers in the exact same place.

13
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:56,420
Rym: That's just kind of how it ends up going.

14
00:00:57,081 --> 00:01:01,020
Rym: So I'd planned to- I canceled my old membership because it was like 10 blocks away.

15
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:06,600
Rym: And there's a different gym that's only slightly more expensive that is literally downstairs around the corner.

16
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:11,960
Rym: Meaning in the winter, I am much more likely to go there at night as opposed to the one that's 10 blocks away.

17
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,380
Scott: And you go there- you go there like, what, super late when everyone's there?

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,880
Rym: My plan was I'll walk down there at like 9 o'clock, climb for a half hour and just fucking leave every night.

19
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:22,260
Rym: That's like- that's ideal.

20
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:23,940
Rym: And then COVID hit, so nothing.

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:33,800
Rym: Still not- for all the things I may or may not do in the current environment, going into a gym is not very high on the list of things I'm willing to risk it for.

22
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,200
Rym: So I've been playing a lot of DDR lately.

23
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:45,440
Rym: And I've noticed something because for a while when I played DDR during quarantine before, I was doing another exercise.

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,540
Rym: DDR wasn't my main thing.

25
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,858
Rym: And I'm very good at DDR, like you are very good at DDR.

26
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:55,120
Rym: A lot of our friends are very good at DDR because we were obsessed with it in ancient times, like fourth mix era.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,700
Rym: But we're all also kind of scrubs, like none of us were good by any real measure, myself included.

28
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:14,953
Rym: And I hit this point when I started playing it again in my 30s where not only was I like not great, but even playing a lot, I just physically could not move my legs fast enough to do very hard songs.

29
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:17,060
Rym: that I was able to do when I was younger.

30
00:02:18,162 --> 00:02:26,880
Rym: But I found just in the last few months when I've been playing DDR to an extreme degree, I am now literally better at Dance Dance Revolution than I've ever been in my life.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,540
Rym: I can pass any nine footer before sixth mix and I can pass almost every nine footer in sixth mix.

32
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,080
Rym: I can do crazy bullshit.

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
Scott: That's what happens if you practice a thing a lot.

34
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,639
Scott: I mean, it's not a surprise.

35
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:43,400
Scott: I'm sure if I played DDR the same amount, I would also get better.

36
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:52,777
Rym: But I am finding where the actual limits of age are because the only song I cannot pass right now that I've passed before is Max 300 on Maniac.

37
00:02:55,482 --> 00:02:58,519
Rym: And it's because I hit my max heart rate in the last third.

38
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:00,639
Rym: Like it's too much exertion.

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,900
Rym: Like I can't sprint that hard anymore.

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:12,880
Rym: So Max 300 is the only song I have done in my life that I cannot do now, but I passed like easily 20 songs that I was never able to pass before.

41
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,620
Rym: So I feel like I'm fighting the good fight against Father Time.

42
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,319
Rym: He's going to beat me in the end, but Little Mac is holding on to the third round right now.

43
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,680
Scott: Old man, old man, DDR grandpa, DDR grandpa.

44
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,888
Rym: You know what I want to be?

45
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:26,420
Rym: I want to be the skeleton.

46
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,220
Rym: You know how one of my life goals is to be that, you know, there's a type of old man that you see all around the world.

47
00:03:32,564 --> 00:03:33,580
Rym: They look like a skeleton.

48
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:38,515
Rym: They look like they're 90 and they're out running at like 6 a.m.

49
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,080
Rym: in the middle of December on the street.

50
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,007
Rym: And you see that guy?

51
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,460
Rym: You're amazed they're alive.

52
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:45,160
Rym: It's kind of my goal, but now I have a sub goal.

53
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,120
Rym: I want to be the skeletal man at Magfest when I'm like 80 playing DDR.

54
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:54,740
Rym: Unlike the ancient machine in the museum part of the convention.

55
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:59,420
Scott: I was going to say, what are the odds of DDR machine will be there?

56
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,440
Rym: I mean, if I was rich enough to get an apartment that had like another room, there would be a DDR machine in that room.

57
00:04:06,322 --> 00:04:07,936
Scott: If I had another room, I would have...

58
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,077
Rym: Air hockey table actually is higher priority, but...

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,260
Scott: I would have air hockey table and one pinball machine.

60
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:15,390
Rym: Just the best one?

61
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:16,700
Rym: Which one would it be?

62
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,779
Rym: If you had to pick right now and you had 10 seconds to decide, what would it be?

63
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:27,020
Scott: Well, the problem is, aesthetically speaking, I'd want to get a really old school one like Blast Off.

64
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:30,520
Scott: Like a 60s one, which is really styling.

65
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,340
Rym: One of the ones that has like the rainbow of brown and yellow colors making a loop.

66
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:37,140
Rym: Like that kind of styling?

67
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,674
Scott: The one, well Blast Off is different styling than that.

68
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,080
Scott: It's more like a retro sci-fi.

69
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:45,100
Scott: It's like a rocket taking off, right?

70
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:51,420
Scott: And then, you've got like a really good 90s one, like I love the Cyclone one and the Funhaus one.

71
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,737
Scott: You know, I love those ones.

72
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:55,760
Scott: That has like a gimmick to it of some kind.

73
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,920
Scott: But there's also the brand new ones that they're making right now, which are like really good, right?

74
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:03,219
Scott: They're obviously better than the old ones.

75
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,853
Rym: And I gotta say, you know where?

76
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:06,880
Rym: I think there's going to be a big one.

77
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,800
Scott: You've got the Addams Family one, it's like a cost a lot because that one's super popular.

78
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,256
Rym: Oh, the Addams Family, when I was a kid, the Addams Family one was 75 cents.

79
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,379
Scott: Yeah, it's one of the best ones.

80
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,704
Rym: Yeah, that's a real good one.

81
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:21,560
Rym: They had that, what was the name of the arcade I used to go to as a kid?

82
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,520
Rym: Now that it matters, it was built inside of a water park that failed inside of a mall.

83
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,739
Scott: Regardless, I wouldn't have more than one.

84
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:33,819
Rym: Yeah, you have one.

85
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,540
Rym: Just like, I mean at least you only need one DDR machine because you can put any DDR in that machine.

86
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:43,980
Rym: And you only need one air hockey table because you just need a regulation one and you're ready to roll.

87
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,379
Rym: So yeah, got any news?

88
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,004
Scott: Do I have a news?

89
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:54,080
Scott: Oh yeah, so I don't know if people knew this.

90
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:55,920
Scott: I didn't even know this that well.

91
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:03,360
Scott: I sort of knew it, but now I actually know it, is that Initial D has a sequel called MF Ghost.

92
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:12,900
Rym: I see that Shigeno draws humans the way he's always drawn them and draws cars the way he's always drawn them from the manga.

93
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,020
Scott: And I basically haven't done it, you know, I got rid of my Initial D manga a long time ago.

94
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,355
Scott: Yeah.

95
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:19,719
Scott: Yeah, it's not down there anymore.

96
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:30,440
Scott: So regardless, you know, Initial D is still a thing, right, that I read a lot of, I watched a lot of.

97
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,215
Scott: I still like Eurobeat music, especially in the summer.

98
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:35,520
Scott: It's not really a good winter music.

99
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,420
Rym: I've been thinking about Initial D a lot, really unrelated to this news because of my news, but anyway.

100
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:47,880
Scott: Okay, well, it sort of leaked, accidental, preannounced, but got taken down.

101
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,701
Scott: But the Internet Archive still had it that they're going to make an MF Ghost anime in 2023.

102
00:06:53,701 --> 00:07:01,260
Scott: And like there was a video trailer, but then it, I don't know if it's still there or not, but I definitely watched it and shared it with everyone.

103
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:08,022
Scott: And it sure enough, it looked like an Initial D anime, but from the year 2022.

104
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:16,740
Scott: And the only differences I noticed were A, the Eurobeat music wasn't there, which tells me either A, they're not going to have it or B, they just didn't have it yet.

105
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:17,298
Rym: Yeah.

106
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:19,239
Rym: And that's a deal breaker for me.

107
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:21,200
Scott: It's obviously a deal breaker.

108
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,240
Rym: Without Eurobeat, it's just watching a PlayStation car race.

109
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:36,200
Scott: The other thing that I noticed was that they had in the animation, they animated drones following the race because it's 2023.

110
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:45,400
Scott: So obviously illegal street racers use drones to follow the cars down the mountain to remotely spectate the entire race.

111
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,220
Rym: I appreciate that touch because you know there's going to be a race where the drone interferes or something.

112
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:59,840
Scott: I don't know, but my question is what the fuck drone has that kind of operating range where you can be at the top or bottom of a mountain and still get signal to it?

113
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,300
Scott: The mountain's pretty tall, right?

114
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,358
Rym: There are drones.

115
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:09,760
Scott: I guess if the mountain's not that tall or if the road goes around to the other side of the mountain, it's like, what are you going to do then?

116
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,464
Rym: Well, you don't need radio.

117
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,506
Rym: Remember, there are drones.

118
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:17,660
Rym: you can tell to just follow an object, follow a transponder, all sorts of stuff like that.

119
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:22,380
Scott: I'm just saying, if the drone doesn't fuck up, that's a really good drone.

120
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:22,936
Rym: Oh yeah.

121
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,491
Scott: Of course, it's not a real drone.

122
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:26,879
Scott: It's an animation of a drone.

123
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:30,306
Rym: But also, it implies something about the Initial D universe.

124
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:42,280
Rym: that was implied by the original show because Takavi never fucking changed those tires, as our friend George likes to point out every time we talk about Initial D. In the real world, you have to replace the tires on that car every single goddamn day.

125
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:43,679
Scott: Pretty much, yeah.

126
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:51,496
Rym: I imagine, much like when I talk about my news, which is actually a Geek Byte, someone is funding all of this racing.

127
00:08:51,536 --> 00:08:53,700
Rym: Maybe Boonta's a secret billionaire, has a friend.

128
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,980
Scott: The illegal street racing of Initial D and MF Ghost is suspiciously well-resourced.

129
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:00,560
Rym: Yup.

130
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,391
Rym: Like, the cops never show up on this road.

131
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:05,820
Rym: Like, every Tuesday, they just know not to be there.

132
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,780
Scott: But if you're on the ground in the town, you can hear screeching tires in the distance and roaring engines.

133
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,544
Rym: They're like, what's that?

134
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:13,172
Rym: And everyone's just like, well, I don't hear it.

135
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:14,579
Rym: It doesn't sound like anything to me.

136
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:23,318
Rym: I'm actually moderately into this, especially if it's really focused on the car racing, because frankly...

137
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,880
Scott: It's been long enough since I watched one that I could be tempted to watch another one, especially if there is some new Eurobeat tracks going on.

138
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,840
Rym: So, to segue, this is actually a perfect and unplanned segue, because our friend's riding that way.

139
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:47,900
Scott: Also, on top of that, there is a... I don't know if it's a new car, but it's a car I didn't know about, probably because it's a Japan-only car, or because...

140
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,719
Rym: Oh, right, the car ads.

141
00:09:49,520 --> 00:10:03,220
Scott: Because I want to ban all cars, but there are some new Initial D car ads for the Toyota GR86, which I guess is effectively the current incarnation of the AE86, which is the Initial D car.

142
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:13,120
Scott: And apparently the GR86 is what the dude drives in MF Ghost, so, you know, it's like, I want to ban all cars, but you know what?

143
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,740
Scott: If I had to buy a car now, it's like, I was in Japan, I guess.

144
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,200
Rym: I mean, I'm not going to get a Nissan Skyline.

145
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:22,039
Scott: I'd like a nice little hatchback.

146
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,320
Scott: But this is more fuel-efficient than a Skyline.

147
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,741
Rym: True.

148
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:36,600
Rym: But also, talk about, like, that is the kind of promotion that probably will actually earnestly be effective in selling cars to nerds, for real.

149
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:47,020
Rym: So if you're feeling that itch, our friends at Red Natalie got really into this show, and it doesn't look like the kind of show that we would get into.

150
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:57,760
Rym: But what if I said the show is basically, take Initial D, but distill it to its essence and cut out absolutely everything that drags at all.

151
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,728
Scott: What is there to cut out?

152
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:00,040
Scott: It's already just essence.

153
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,784
Rym: So imagine if they're like, we're going to have a race.

154
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:05,029
Rym: It cuts to the race.

155
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:10,040
Rym: The race just happens, and then it ends, and then another fucking race happens in the same episode.

156
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,278
Scott: That's pretty much Initial D, yeah.

157
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:15,237
Scott: But also, cross it- With most sports anime?

158
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:17,477
Rym: Cross it with- cross it with Utena.

159
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:19,903
Rym: A little bit.

160
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:25,400
Rym: This show is nuts, and I actually really enjoy it, and it takes-.

161
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:26,200
Scott: What show are you talking about?

162
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,420
Rym: So the show is called Skate as an SK8 The Infinity.

163
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,745
Rym: It's a short show.

164
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:37,740
Rym: I think it might have more seasons coming, but season one just ends and seems to tell a story.

165
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,040
Rym: There's 12 episodes.

166
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:41,340
Scott: Are the episodes full length, or is it a short show?

167
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,247
Rym: Full length episodes.

168
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:42,854
Rym: There's 12 of them.

169
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,174
Scott: Oh, there's only not a lot of episodes.

170
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,364
Rym: Yeah, it's Bones.

171
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:53,100
Rym: It's lusciously animated, and basically the plot of this show- I'm geek biting it because I'm about to watch the last episode.

172
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,020
Scott: Is it just sports anime of skateboard?

173
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,101
Rym: Sort of.

174
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:59,653
Rym: So basically, it's about a kid who's kind of a scrub.

175
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:01,480
Rym: Like, he's a good skateboarder, but he's a scrub.

176
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:05,900
Rym: And this other kid comes to town, and the other kid's the Takumi.

177
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:13,400
Rym: He's a snowboarder whose family had to move away from Canada and forced to live in Japan in a hot place.

178
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:22,180
Rym: And he's bored, and he ends up taking up skateboarding, and because of his snowboarding skills, he ends up being the god of skateboarding.

179
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,360
Rym: Like, he is the best skateboarding human in history, effectively.

180
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,839
Scott: I don't know how well snowboarding skills translate.

181
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,880
Scott: I've never been able to even balance on a skateboard, so just going flat.

182
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,860
Rym: There is overlap between the sports because the muscle, like the skills you learn, translate to a degree, but the physicality you learn.

183
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:49,060
Scott: I was gonna say, if there was a lot of crossover, I would have expected to see Tony Hawk trying to snowboard.

184
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,623
Rym: He might.

185
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:50,760
Rym: There is a lot of crossover.

186
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:54,240
Scott: Who's the famous snowboard-y guy trying to skateboard?

187
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:58,771
Rym: Yeah, I do not like snowboarding as a sport.

188
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,740
Rym: Skiing is objectively better for the kinds of things I like to do.

189
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:10,020
Rym: But anyway, so this show, the villains are like Fist of the North Star villains in some cases.

190
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,325
Rym: One of them is basically just Akio.

191
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:18,840
Rym: It is so over-the-top and so condensed that it is actually worth watching.

192
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,992
Scott: So it's not trying to be realistic.

193
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:21,294
Scott: It's wild.

194
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,242
Rym: It's weird.

195
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:31,600
Rym: It's hyper-realistic up to a point, and then there's a big gap, and then it is just ridiculous bullshit.

196
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,160
Rym: But it's interesting to see that the parts that are realistic are hyper-realistic.

197
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:45,560
Rym: And what I'd say is it's very true to how skaters feel about what they're doing and what it feels like to skateboard and snowboard.

198
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:48,487
Rym: But the literal reality is what's happening.

199
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:53,620
Rym: They do the gutter trick like in Initial D, but with the skateboard around the side.

200
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:01,080
Rym: One dude is this Fist of the North Star looking villain, and he powers up an attack where he's going to attack someone in the race.

201
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:08,920
Rym: But what he actually does is light a bunch of firecrackers and throw them at the dude or pull out a laser pen and just point it at his face to get him to mess up.

202
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:18,840
Rym: But the funniest part about the show is, to give you an example, the Fist of the North Star villain, he's just some schlub who works at a florist by day.

203
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:25,940
Rym: And all these people have alter egos where they go to the dueling arena to have their beefs on their skateboards at night.

204
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:32,740
Rym: And to pull this back into the Initial D thing, there is a rich person funding this ridiculous nonsense.

205
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,120
Rym: He has bribed all the police to never patrol this mountain on the days they're going to have races.

206
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:43,820
Rym: And it pulls the real world into this ridiculous nonsense in ways that Initial D never did.

207
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,167
Rym: And honestly, I really enjoyed it.

208
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:47,814
Rym: I ended up watching the whole goddamn thing.

209
00:14:48,156 --> 00:14:48,919
Rym: It's only 12 episodes.

210
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,960
Rym: So, in another news that I guess only me and weirdos care about, but I've talked about this before.

211
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,928
Rym: There was a webcomic that I like.

212
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,799
Rym: I think it was doing something interesting called Mr.

213
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:02,060
Rym: Boop.

214
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:12,920
Rym: It is about the real life human being who ends up in a relationship with Betty Boop, the animated character, and marries her.

215
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,854
Rym: And it is just fucked up, violent, adults only, weird nonsense.

216
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,518
Rym: But I really liked it.

217
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:21,240
Rym: It was doing something.

218
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:32,640
Scott: I never read the whole thing, and I never followed it, but I think there were occasions where I got a link to it, and then I just read a pile of it in a sitting, like maybe half hour worth or whatever.

219
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,516
Scott: So I knew it, and then I was like, "That's enough of that.

220
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:37,199
Scott: I know what the deal

221
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:37,260
Scott: is.".

222
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:37,661
Rym: You know what?

223
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:41,152
Rym: It's one of those things where I would say, "It's not necessarily for everyone.

224
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:43,179
Rym: It's not even that necessarily for

225
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:43,379
Rym: me.".

226
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,528
Rym: But you look at it and you go, "You know what?

227
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:46,934
Rym: There's something going on there.

228
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:48,159
Rym: Someone appreciates

229
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:48,340
Rym: that.".

230
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,906
Scott: It's a clever idea.

231
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,120
Scott: Decent enough execution for the concept.

232
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,312
Rym: And actually it actually tries to say something in the end.

233
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:59,739
Rym: It does bring it all back together into a kind of real point.

234
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:06,780
Rym: So Alec Robbins is now putting it out in a deluxe physical book.

235
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,804
Scott: Are they going to get sued?

236
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:11,054
Scott: Is Betty Boop in the public domain?

237
00:16:11,115 --> 00:16:12,280
Scott: I didn't see her on the list this year.

238
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,300
Rym: I mean, I'm going to buy this book, so if it does get sued, I'm hoping I get the book before it gets sued.

239
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,290
Scott: Yeah, good idea.

240
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:20,199
Scott: I recommend, yeah.

241
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,885
Rym: Because I feel like Mr.

242
00:16:21,945 --> 00:16:26,040
Rym: Boop is the kind of thing, like again, go read some to see if this is your thing or not.

243
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,916
Rym: I suspect most of you, your reaction will be, "What the fuck is

244
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:29,157
Rym: this?".

245
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:38,454
Rym: But I feel like this book will be something that at some point in my life, I will pull off a bookshelf and hand to someone and say, "I think you should look at what's in these

246
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:38,796
Rym: pages.".

247
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:42,660
Scott: It's definitely, you know, it's a thing that stands out, right?

248
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:49,540
Scott: Like you could mix, I could mix it in with some like other coffee table books that are obviously vastly superior, right?

249
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,600
Scott: You could have, you know, like I have my mouse guard coffee table book.

250
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,320
Rym: I've got my New York City MTA style guide for the entire subway system.

251
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:01,508
Scott: I got Wolf Walker's art book.

252
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:04,359
Scott: I got like Hellboy library edition, right?

253
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,875
Scott: All of those are way, way, way better than Mr.

254
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:07,176
Scott: Boop.

255
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,717
Scott: But if you were to put all four of those on a coffee table and a random person came in, right?

256
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,241
Scott: The Mr.

257
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:20,579
Scott: Boop one is the most like, huh, kind of, you know.

258
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:28,359
Rym: Because remember the whole original point of coffee table books was are ostensibly to be conversation pieces before people had smartphones.

259
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:30,304
Rym: And I think Mr.

260
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:34,420
Rym: Boop on the coffee table will definitely cause a conversation.

261
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:42,239
Scott: Or if I had, I kind of wish that I had, you know, some sort of office with a waiting room.

262
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:47,858
Scott: So I could put all coffee table books and no magazines and no ads.

263
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:49,403
Scott: Yeah.

264
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:52,120
Rym: So the other one I'll say, I'll quote a great man.

265
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,632
Scott: I don't know if it would be okay to put Mr.

266
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,479
Scott: Boop in there though.

267
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:58,571
Rym: I'll just quote a great man from fiction who said something.

268
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:01,239
Rym: and that's what I, that's my actual assessment of Mr.

269
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:01,440
Rym: Boop.

270
00:18:02,285 --> 00:18:04,400
Rym: It was most memorable.

271
00:18:12,381 --> 00:18:14,760
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

272
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,210
Rym: This is not new.

273
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:17,179
Rym: It's not even new to me.

274
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:24,560
Rym: I saw it a while ago, but it was in a queue I have of things I was going to use as things of the day as backups.

275
00:18:24,963 --> 00:18:27,439
Rym: If I didn't have anything new, that queue got too old.

276
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:29,798
Rym: So I'm going to go through it.

277
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,620
Scott: I'm fairly confident.

278
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,179
Scott: I've seen this before years and years and years ago.

279
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:35,599
Scott: I've definitely seen this at least twice.

280
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:41,299
Scott: I definitely remember like having it come up again at least at some point after my original seeing of it.

281
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,160
Scott: I strongly feel it was thing of the day in the past, but if we can't, Rym couldn't find it.

282
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:48,094
Rym: I couldn't find it.

283
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:48,299
Rym: I did try.

284
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:56,100
Rym: I searched for Italy, Italian, fake English, English, Italian, Adriano, Celentano.

285
00:18:57,343 --> 00:18:58,478
Scott: So who knows?

286
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,719
Scott: Regardless, use it again.

287
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:02,759
Rym: It's a short video.

288
00:19:02,981 --> 00:19:07,940
Rym: I'm just going to read the tweet that the person that I'm linking to tweeted about it because it says everything.

289
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:22,160
Rym: "Italian singer Adriano Celentano released a song in the '70s with nonsense lyrics meant to sound like American English, apparently to prove Italians would like any English song.

290
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:26,217
Rym: It was a hit and resulted in this, the greatest video I have ever

291
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:26,458
Rym: seen.".

292
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,836
Scott: Yeah, it's not a bad song, really.

293
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:30,399
Scott: It's kind of fun.

294
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:31,550
Rym: I like the video too.

295
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,080
Scott: The video is also kind of fun in a, I guess, Moscow kind of way.

296
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:42,460
Rym: I can imagine a cover of this on Eurovision being hot shit.

297
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,139
Scott: Oh yeah, probably.

298
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:52,560
Scott: But I mean, the thing is, if you think about this from the flip side perspective, right?

299
00:19:53,061 --> 00:20:03,680
Scott: Imagine if I sang a song, you know, pretending to speak in Korean to make a point that, you know, K-pop fans will listen to anything.

300
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,004
Scott: They don't know what's being, right?

301
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,511
Scott: It's like, that's fucking racist.

302
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:07,415
Rym: You can't do that.

303
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:26,140
Rym: For this, there's a difference because this is definitely a response to the overbearing colonialist history presence of American pop culture globally specifically, which in the 70s in Europe was a huge part of pop counterculture.

304
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:27,643
Scott: That's the point, right?

305
00:20:27,703 --> 00:20:34,580
Scott: Is that one is going against the colonizer where K-pop is not, we're still the colonizer in that relationship, right?

306
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:39,393
Scott: But there could be some distant future, right?

307
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:41,860
Scott: Not too distant even, decades, right?

308
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:45,818
Scott: Where, you know, especially the way the US is going, we're collapsing here.

309
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:49,530
Scott: Where we are no longer colonized.

310
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,673
Scott: That is not today.

311
00:20:50,693 --> 00:20:53,240
Scott: Feel free to keep attacking us today.

312
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,967
Scott: But no, this is punching up, not down.

313
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,227
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

314
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:01,020
Scott: It's also good.

315
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:02,946
Rym: Yeah, legit good.

316
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:04,191
Rym: The song is catchy.

317
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,240
Rym: I caught myself humming it before the show.

318
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,680
Scott: The person was good at music, right?

319
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,267
Scott: I think that's.

320
00:21:10,307 --> 00:21:14,860
Scott: the other thing is that this person was trying to make their point, like, oh, any English song will be popular.

321
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,416
Scott: But it's like, actually, if you had made a shitty song, it wouldn't have been popular, right?

322
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:20,379
Scott: You made a good song.

323
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:31,140
Rym: But also, it is really hard to like babble or talk in a language where it sounds like that language, but isn't actually that language.

324
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:32,777
Rym: That is actually very difficult to do.

325
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:36,800
Scott: It's difficult to do without just being racist.

326
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:37,462
Rym: Yup.

327
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:43,120
Rym: But even like, try to vaguely talk in German without actually using real German words.

328
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:45,960
Rym: If you know some German words, it's a challenge.

329
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,800
Scott: The only way I can only think, my brain only would know how to do it in a racist fashion.

330
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:50,321
Rym: Nah.

331
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:51,840
Rym: So what do you got?

332
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,229
Scott: Alright, so, what do I have?

333
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:56,590
Scott: That's right.

334
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:59,520
Scott: I've used, I'm pretty sure I did a thing of the day before.

335
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,440
Scott: Because the official Pokemon YouTube channel.

336
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,220
Rym: Which is a great channel, like legit good stuff.

337
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,840
Scott: It's a great channel, even if you only mildly enjoy Pokemon.

338
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:15,340
Scott: They have been occasionally releasing short Pokemon animations.

339
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,780
Scott: Now, we're not talking like episodes of Pokemon anime here.

340
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Scott: We're talking like original short animations that take place in the Pokemon universe.

341
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:29,520
Scott: By various animators that are completely standalone and have nothing to do with anything.

342
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:34,320
Scott: And really, if you appreciate Pokemon at all, even a small amount.

343
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:39,900
Scott: Then you can appreciate these short, well done animations that are just free on YouTube with no ads.

344
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,313
Scott: They're just an ad for Pokemon in themselves, right?

345
00:22:43,353 --> 00:22:44,357
Scott: There's no nonsense.

346
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,860
Scott: So I'm pretty sure I did a thing of the day for the previous one, which is about Gengar.

347
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,008
Rym: Oh, that one was good.

348
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:52,999
Rym: That's one of the best ones.

349
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,000
Scott: That's a real good one, the Gengar one.

350
00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:00,300
Rym: Actually, the music videos that come out are the best of the Pokemon stuff, but this stuff's really good too.

351
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,360
Scott: The Gengar one wasn't really a Pokemon story.

352
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:10,558
Scott: It was sort of just a story about ghosts, school, and whatnot.

353
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,980
Scott: But just in the Pokemon universe, the ghosts happened to be Gengar and whatnot, right?

354
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:16,200
Scott: Friendship.

355
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,440
Scott: This one, there's a new one that just came out like yesterday, which is the Bidoof one.

356
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:24,720
Scott: And you already know when it's the Bidoof one, it's going to be something, right?

357
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:33,199
Scott: But this one is not only a good story, but it's also a very Pokemon universe story.

358
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:42,960
Scott: It directly translates to the mechanics of what's going on when you're playing a Pokemon game.

359
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:47,454
Scott: And it sort of takes that story from the perspective of the Pokemon.

360
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:55,040
Scott: It's like you think about a Pokemon game and it's a story of the trainer, right?

361
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,680
Scott: And this is like, okay, if a trainer caught a Bidoof, what would the trainer do with the Bidoof?

362
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,256
Rym: I know what I do with Bidoofs.

363
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,419
Scott: Right, let's tell that story from the perspective of the Bidoof.

364
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,880
Scott: And it ends up being a very, very good way to spend the few minutes of your life it takes to watch this.

365
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,420
Scott: So I can't use this channel as my thing of the day a third time, that would be wrong.

366
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:27,540
Scott: So watch this video, but also subscribe to the Pokemon official YouTube channel.

367
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:32,279
Scott: Or just stay on top of the original animations that appear there.

368
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Rym: I mean, basically that's our rule.

369
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:39,760
Scott: There's almost definitely going to be more like this that are probably going to be just as good, if not better.

370
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,878
Rym: Oh yeah, this is very true to the Bidoof.

371
00:24:43,301 --> 00:24:46,340
Rym: But in general, I feel like in the meta moment, we'll do the meta moment now.

372
00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:52,420
Rym: In terms of our things of the day, we can only use one content creation source once.

373
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,580
Rym: Unless, like you said, the second thing is just so good.

374
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,640
Rym: But then that basically ends using that thing, I think.

375
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,785
Scott: What am I supposed to do?

376
00:25:00,825 --> 00:25:03,100
Scott: Like I watch Lawyer several times a week.

377
00:25:03,361 --> 00:25:06,880
Scott: Am I going to be like, cracking the cryptic Sudoku.

378
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,500
Scott: Just thing of the day, yeah, this YouTube channel I subscribe to, post another video.

379
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,431
Rym: I think the rule has to be simple.

380
00:25:13,693 --> 00:25:14,900
Rym: There's actually a much simpler rule.

381
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,500
Scott: If you liked it the last time I did it as thing of the day, you would have subscribed to it already.

382
00:25:20,723 --> 00:25:27,520
Rym: We can only use a source of things of the day, again, if we follow the same rule we followed for Jack Thompson.

383
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,440
Rym: The thing has to be an order of magnitude beyond the last time we used that source.

384
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:40,180
Scott: Yeah, like if Lockpicking Lawyer went and opened up Fort Knox, that could be thing of the day worthy, right?

385
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,065
Scott: Exactly.

386
00:25:41,226 --> 00:25:43,940
Rym: But it's got to be a full order of magnitude.

387
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:48,880
Scott: Right, but today all he did was crack the door lock on an Audi something, right?

388
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:50,126
Scott: Some car.

389
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:51,860
Scott: He's done that so many times.

390
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:56,940
Rym: So in the meantime, the GeekNights Book Club book, which Scott has finished.

391
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:03,220
Scott: I have finished reading every goddamn page of the tale of Genji.

392
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:04,998
Scott: Eat a dick, I read it.

393
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:11,780
Scott: Also, I just want to say something incredibly rude I discovered.

394
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,680
Scott: I guess it's also a consequence of reading an e-book instead of a paper book.

395
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,560
Rym: Yeah, because at a paper book you would have discovered what you're about to say, which I'm also mad now that I know.

396
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:22,882
Scott: That's right.

397
00:26:23,243 --> 00:26:29,020
Scott: So we all know when it comes to nerds, nerdy books have maps, especially fantasy books.

398
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,840
Scott: If they don't got a map, you can throw that fantasy book right in the trash.

399
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,494
Rym: Yep, go find your copy of the Hobbit.

400
00:26:33,515 --> 00:26:34,059
Rym: There's a map.

401
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,242
Scott: That's right.

402
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,580
Scott: If you open up a fantasy novel and there's a map in it, you don't need to read.

403
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,609
Scott: You don't need to know nothing.

404
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,459
Scott: Just take that shit home.

405
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:44,230
Scott: If you're at the library, just check that shit out.

406
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,114
Scott: You know it's going to be good.

407
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,400
Scott: There's a map in there, right?

408
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,860
Scott: Tale of Genji, if you're still reading it or whatever, it has maps.

409
00:26:54,641 --> 00:26:55,484
Scott: Therefore, it's good.

410
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:59,620
Scott: But also those maps are at the fucking end, right?

411
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:07,780
Scott: They're after the final page in between the text and the, you know, the appendices and notes and footnote shit at the end, right?

412
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,763
Scott: The maps are in between.

413
00:27:10,184 --> 00:27:17,200
Scott: So if I had the paper edition of this book, I would have, like, flipped through it and smelled it and seen those maps before I started reading.

414
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:26,746
Scott: But because I had the e-book edition, right, and the maps aren't listed in the table of contents, like maps page X, I didn't know about those maps.

415
00:27:26,806 --> 00:27:33,080
Scott: until on the final page, there's a map and I go to the next page and the zoom in on a piece of the map.

416
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,509
Scott: And I'm like, I keep going and there's more maps.

417
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:38,260
Scott: And I'm like, motherfucker, that's rude as hell.

418
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:47,360
Scott: So anyone out there who's making e-books or making books, if you make a map and put it in your book, that's a good thing because now I know your book is good.

419
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,633
Scott: Also put your map at the start, especially if it's an e-book.

420
00:27:52,576 --> 00:27:53,400
Scott: So I know it's there.

421
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:57,900
Scott: If you put your map at the end, you might not sell because I didn't see that map.

422
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,723
Rym: Yes.

423
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,413
Rym: This is why Scott never read the Wheel of Time.

424
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:00,755
Rym: Doesn't know?

425
00:28:00,775 --> 00:28:01,559
Rym: there's a map in there.

426
00:28:02,622 --> 00:28:03,398
Scott: There's a map in there?

427
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,899
Rym: There's maps in every one of those books.

428
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,831
Scott: I'm pretty sure I've read Wheel of Time.

429
00:28:06,872 --> 00:28:08,040
Scott: I've read several Wheel of Times.

430
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:10,859
Rym: I'm the one who just kept going and read all the way to the end.

431
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,200
Scott: I read like four, five, several.

432
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:13,906
Rym: There's one like 13.

433
00:28:13,906 --> 00:28:14,920
Rym: I don't even remember.

434
00:28:15,303 --> 00:28:17,740
Scott: I don't know what happened in any particular book.

435
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,400
Scott: There's definitely teens of them.

436
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:24,759
Rym: Like I always say, in the time it would take me to summarize what the fuck happens in the Wheel of Time, you could just read it.

437
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:33,220
Rym: So yeah, we'll be doing this book club book like first week of February because I gotta finish the book, which I am well on track to finish this month.

438
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,900
Rym: And we got thoughts about Genji and about the environment.

439
00:28:38,381 --> 00:28:41,640
Scott: I'm writing down a bunch of notes because there's so much to say.

440
00:28:42,461 --> 00:28:45,750
Rym: I've been keeping like one short note per chapter.

441
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:53,738
Rym: Mostly so I remember what happened in each chapter or the things I was mad about or surprised by or etc.

442
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:54,280
Rym: along the way.

443
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:00,979
Rym: Because every time I think about the book, there's so much that happened that I'm currently like, "Wait, Genji, what the

444
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:01,199
Rym: fuck?".

445
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,852
Rym: I gotta remember, "Oh, but I was also mad about this and mad about

446
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:04,094
Rym: that.".

447
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:09,919
Rym: Anyway, otherwise, we got no cons coming up anytime soon.

448
00:29:10,986 --> 00:29:11,880
Rym: Our panels are on YouTube.

449
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,139
Rym: Stay tuned for our new website and all the other stuff we got working on.

450
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,000
Rym: I guess we can just get right into our main bit with a show that snuck up on me.

451
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,279
Rym: I kind of ignored this show.

452
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:23,932
Scott: I knew it existed.

453
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,280
Scott: I knew that it was around.

454
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:37,940
Rym: And I knew it shook to a degree, but I just ignored it until YouTube, in its infinite wisdom, the algorithm one day when I looked at just the algorithmic suggestions, showed me a song from Centaur World.

455
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:44,856
Rym: And I watched the song, and much like how I watched the winter wrap-up song from My Little Pony, and I was like, "Wait a minute, this show has

456
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:45,200
Rym: music?".

457
00:29:45,802 --> 00:29:48,694
Rym: I suddenly went, "Wait a minute, this show has music that's

458
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:49,678
Rym: Disney-quality?".

459
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:54,914
Rym: And I watched another song, and I was like, "Wait, there's multiple Disney-level songs.

460
00:29:55,175 --> 00:29:56,218
Rym: How many episodes is this

461
00:29:56,258 --> 00:29:56,459
Rym: show?".

462
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:58,184
Rym: "Oh, it's only two seasons?

463
00:29:58,265 --> 00:29:59,368
Rym: There's 18 episodes?

464
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:00,492
Rym: Alright, I'm just watching it.

465
00:30:00,873 --> 00:30:01,876
Rym: Nothing's stopping me now.

466
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:02,397
Rym: That's worth

467
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:02,478
Rym: it.".

468
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:06,251
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I only watched, you know, I knew about it.

469
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:08,059
Scott: I wasn't really planning to watch it.

470
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:13,300
Scott: But I watched three episodes just right now, the first three episodes, because we were going to do a show on it.

471
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,617
Rym: Which that covers, what, like six or seven full-on songs, I want to say?

472
00:30:17,677 --> 00:30:18,400
Rym: You see the tornado.

473
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,667
Scott: There were several songs per episode.

474
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:25,177
Scott: I want to say at least seven or eight songs at least.

475
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:25,859
Scott: Maybe nine?

476
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:26,260
Scott: I don't know.

477
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:27,722
Rym: There's many.

478
00:30:28,003 --> 00:30:33,660
Rym: I can think of at least six songs that are full-on songs just from what you watched so far.

479
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,099
Rym: And there's even more songs later on.

480
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,680
Scott: So this show is basically, you know, I forget what the word people use for it, where you go into another universe like Escaflowne.

481
00:30:44,865 --> 00:30:45,557
Scott: It's one of those.

482
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,960
Rym: But it's got a, the twist it has, like, I mean, spoiler, we're not going to spoil anything, this show's not even that long.

483
00:30:53,020 --> 00:31:04,980
Rym: And also, like, the conceit, it starts with a serious, very angularly animated show that looks a lot like a typical kid's fantasy animated show.

484
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:10,580
Rym: There's a girl who's a knight, she's on a horse, there's clearly some sort of war, there's devastation everywhere.

485
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:15,440
Rym: There's a very serious and very good song as she's calming down this warhorse.

486
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,299
Scott: That was probably the best song of the songs.

487
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:21,300
Rym: Yeah, so that song gets reprised and remixed.

488
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,467
Scott: Some of the other songs are meh.

489
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:24,320
Scott: Yeah, it does get reprised.

490
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,300
Rym: Yeah, well, because that is the plot.

491
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:32,680
Rym: It starts with that, and then pretty much immediately the horse gets transported.

492
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,404
Rym: So it's not.

493
00:31:33,444 --> 00:31:35,520
Rym: the rider gets transported to a magical world, no.

494
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,200
Rym: The show is about the horse, and the horse gets transported to a magical centaur world and is trying to get back to her rider.

495
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:46,359
Scott: I was actually confused at the start there, because...

496
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,580
Rym: Which was clearly intentional by the creators.

497
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:57,300
Scott: Right, the horse starts talking, and I was like, did the girl get transported in the horse's body and doesn't know she's in the horse's body yet?

498
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,124
Scott: Did she turn into a horse?

499
00:31:59,405 --> 00:32:05,000
Scott: And then eventually you realize, no, the horse only was transported to the other world, right?

500
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:08,050
Scott: So that is pretty clever, right?

501
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:10,458
Scott: Usually it's like a magical girl with a pet.

502
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:15,660
Scott: No, the pet is actually the main character, not the magical girl.

503
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,619
Scott: The pet goes into the other universe, gains the ability to talk because it's fucking centaur world and it's a horse.

504
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:23,951
Scott: Or whatever magic.

505
00:32:23,971 --> 00:32:25,540
Scott: And that's the main character.

506
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,928
Scott: And I was like, oh, alright.

507
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:31,260
Scott: That's points for originalness there.

508
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,983
Rym: And that is the plot.

509
00:32:33,003 --> 00:32:35,189
Rym: The horse thing is all the way to the end.

510
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,060
Scott: Yeah, the horse is the hero that goes on the adventure in centaur world.

511
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,795
Scott: It's a normal horse, and it encounters all these wacky centaurs.

512
00:32:49,741 --> 00:33:01,760
Rym: So centaur world, meanwhile, the fantasy world the horse goes into, on one hand, depending on how you interpret it, it's kind of like, what would be the fantasy world that a horse would imagine if we're going with this horse conceit?

513
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,583
Rym: Because everything's a centaur.

514
00:33:04,164 --> 00:33:13,360
Rym: And I guess, take the most Pendleton Ward parts of Adventure Time, distill them, and make that the world.

515
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:16,946
Rym: That's kind of what centaur world is like.

516
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:22,645
Rym: And I do appreciate how the horse, basically, like the horse's personality is, I'm a war horse.

517
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:24,111
Rym: I fucking murder people.

518
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,115
Rym: That is my job.

519
00:33:25,477 --> 00:33:26,200
Rym: Like, for real.

520
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:33,740
Rym: And the horse kind of freaks out about this world that she is now in with these weird, like, she reacts the way we would react in a world like this.

521
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,340
Rym: And the whole show is about, well, the first season is, how does the horse get home?

522
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,065
Rym: And you only saw three episodes.

523
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:45,800
Rym: What I can say is, the plot progresses extremely rapidly.

524
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,219
Rym: It is an escaflowne level.

525
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,060
Scott: The end of episode three is like, oh, okay, I see where this is going.

526
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:54,200
Rym: Yeah, but I'll say, like, you find out what's up with the rider, like, real quick.

527
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:57,516
Rym: I think you met Water Baby, best character in the show.

528
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,320
Rym: The shaman?

529
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,540
Scott: I agree that that is the best character that I have encountered so far by a lot.

530
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,600
Rym: So, Scott, did you get the "she's up to something" sense that I got from that song?

531
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,000
Scott: I got the "up to something" sense from everybody.

532
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,900
Rym: Yeah, so yeah, everybody's up to something, but Water Baby is up to something.

533
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:16,212
Scott: Of course she is.

534
00:34:16,232 --> 00:34:16,719
Scott: That's obvious.

535
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:23,460
Rym: And she comes back and is a major character, but I guess the thing is, this show moves fast like the second half of escaflowne.

536
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:26,600
Rym: So, like, if you're wondering, like, hey, is Rider going to come back at the end?

537
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,780
Rym: No, you see what's up with Rider, like, before the end of season one even.

538
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,480
Rym: The Nowhere King, which I don't think you even got the Nowhere King song yet.

539
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,380
Rym: Yeah, you find out a good chunk of that deal, like, at the end of season one.

540
00:34:38,821 --> 00:34:41,059
Rym: Everything resolves itself, like, pretty hard.

541
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:45,279
Rym: And the show just steamrolls to the finale at the end of season two.

542
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:54,179
Rym: Like, you will not have any questions, everything gets revealed, everything gets explained, and the character arcs are all actually pretty satisfying.

543
00:34:55,021 --> 00:35:02,120
Rym: And even the centaur world nonsense is way more serious than it appears from the superficial initial episodes.

544
00:35:03,926 --> 00:35:06,159
Scott: Yeah, I don't think I'm watching any more than three episodes.

545
00:35:06,962 --> 00:35:09,597
Rym: You know what, the thing is, what you could do, just like with a lot of musicals...

546
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:14,320
Scott: I could read a spoiler and be like, oh, the good guys win, the end, okay, that's what I wanted.

547
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,900
Rym: You want to see where the show was going.

548
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:24,160
Rym: You could do the thing, like, you know musicals like Les Mis, how if you listen to the soundtrack, that kind of tells you everything.

549
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,360
Rym: And the non-singing acting that happens in between the songs is largely incidental.

550
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,859
Rym: Like, you can figure out the whole plot.

551
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:40,000
Rym: There's two YouTube videos that are just every song from centaur world in chronological order, and that'll pretty much tell you the full deal of the whole show.

552
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:47,239
Scott: So the problem is, is that even though I think every song I heard was like a rather well-made song...

553
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,420
Rym: Oh, the craft of the songs is like A+ didn't appear.

554
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:57,620
Scott: And it's like, wow, they put a lot of hard work, and they made, making songs is not easy, and they made a lot of them, right?

555
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:09,480
Scott: But none of the songs, right, the first one is definitely the best, it comes the closest, but none of the songs are like, that I heard in three episodes, which is a lot of songs.

556
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:14,520
Scott: Zero of them were like, soundtrack, I would get home and listen to this on purpose.

557
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,520
Rym: See, I do that, I was listening to the soundtrack while I was working today.

558
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:32,440
Scott: Right, you go, usually if you go see a Broadway musical, like a good one, usually there's at least two or three songs that are just like, you just cannot escape, you know, they're just inescapable earworms, like you're just done, right?

559
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,860
Rym: I would say, you know, disagreeing with you, about 75% of the songs from the show get stuck in my head instantly.

560
00:36:40,101 --> 00:36:42,707
Scott: I was like, eh, it was a song, right?

561
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:49,020
Scott: I don't want to like, there was even one song in the third episode, I was just like, I'm just gonna fast forward through this song.

562
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:55,340
Scott: And the reason I fast forwarded through the song is because of two additional complaints I have, right?

563
00:36:55,661 --> 00:37:04,740
Scott: So if you look at most musicals, right, the songs in like top tier musicals usually serve one of two purposes.

564
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:12,280
Scott: One is to sort of, you know, show you something that you didn't know already, right?

565
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:25,340
Scott: So if you think of like, Little Mermaid, right, you know, there's a song she sings with the, she's got the, you know, the spork, the fuzz doodle, right, when she's underneath her little hidey hole, right?

566
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,580
Scott: And it's like, you're learning, you didn't know that Ariel was like pining for the other world.

567
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:37,560
Scott: So she's got the part of the world song and you learn something from the song, right?

568
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,983
Scott: And it's expositional.

569
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:48,660
Scott: And the other kind of song that you get is sort of resolutional, where there's some conflict that's happening, right?

570
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,346
Scott: Or, and this, you know, maybe it'll often have two characters, right?

571
00:37:52,366 --> 00:38:00,660
Scott: And there was a song that involved two characters in Centaur World, but not always two characters, it could be a single character with an inner conflict, right?

572
00:38:01,181 --> 00:38:05,927
Scott: And in the course of the song, the conflict is resolved, right?

573
00:38:05,947 --> 00:38:14,159
Scott: Like they sort of come to the conclusion mid-song, and then the climax of the song is like, we've decided this, or this is how I'm gonna go, or, right?

574
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,223
Scott: And so the song like is the plot.

575
00:38:17,603 --> 00:38:27,960
Scott: Most of the songs in Centaur World, right, whatever they were singing about, was something you already knew before the song started.

576
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:37,618
Scott: And, so it wasn't expositional, you weren't learning anything, they were just singing about the feelings that already had been expressed in that scene or previous scene.

577
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:57,900
Scott: And if there was a conflict, you know, like there was with the duet song, it wasn't resolved in the course of the song, it's like they sang the song, and then the resolution came after that, and so the songs felt like they had no purpose other than to make it musical.

578
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:07,420
Scott: And so that, for me, allowed me, once I got through so many songs, and the fact that the songs were not earworms, that's why I fast-forwarded through one of the songs.

579
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,940
Rym: See, now I disagree that I find them to be extreme earworms.

580
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:20,740
Scott: Because I was like, this song is not telling me anything I don't know, and when I got to the end of the song, the plot had not advanced, and there was no, the thing that was unresolved was still unresolved, and I was like, I missed nothing skipping that song.

581
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:21,860
Scott: Nothing at all.

582
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:40,500
Rym: So what the show does, basically, is it takes the songs and sort of, they come back, now including the sort of sinister, unspoken, like what was the undertone of the song the first time it came, when it comes back, you sort of find out what were they all avoiding talking about and singing about, and then the songs are sort of different.

583
00:39:40,783 --> 00:39:42,200
Scott: That's clever, that's good.

584
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:55,580
Scott: You look at Adventure Time, right, you know, the song, the door-opening episode, the best Adventure Time song, right, and it's like, that song is resolution-al, right?

585
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,660
Rym: Ah, but most Adventure Time songs are not that way.

586
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:01,280
Scott: And an earworm that you can't avoid.

587
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,980
Rym: Very few Adventure songs are actually that way.

588
00:40:05,022 --> 00:40:10,400
Scott: I'm not saying that all the Adventure Time songs are great, I'm saying that that one is really good.

589
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:16,180
Scott: I'm just pointing out one example of one good example of the right way to do a musical, right?

590
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:31,940
Scott: But I'm saying, even Disney musicals, which, you know, love 'em or hate 'em or whatever, right, almost all of the songs in any Disney animated musical fall into the two categories I described, expositional or resolution-al.

591
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,857
Rym: You know, I realize one song you didn't hear from the next, I don't think you got the food song, but basically, No, no food song.

592
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,975
Rym: There's a whole song where all the centaurs are like, "Please, sir, where does food come

593
00:40:42,015 --> 00:40:42,176
Rym: from?".

594
00:40:42,216 --> 00:40:43,340
Rym: Like, they don't know where food comes from.

595
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:53,758
Scott: I did get hungry, though, with the pancakes, and also, I appreciate that the centaurs go to the bathroom, which most shows in general don't deal with, so I like that.

596
00:40:53,779 --> 00:40:54,600
Scott: That was good.

597
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,920
Rym: So, at the end of that song, it cuts away from the music, and the horse is like, "What the fuck is wrong with

598
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,040
Rym: you?".

599
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,706
Rym: Of course, how do you not know where food comes from?

600
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:08,300
Rym: But then the horse realizes that the horse doesn't know where food comes from, either, because the rider just gives it to them.

601
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,020
Rym: And that sort of sets the tone for what the show's actually about when you get to the end.

602
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,733
Scott: I appreciated the glue moment in episode three.

603
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,280
Scott: The glue moment was very good.

604
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,286
Rym: Oh, in season two, when there's a war?

605
00:41:21,306 --> 00:41:25,080
Rym: Yeah, centaurs don't know what war is, really.

606
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:35,320
Rym: But I would say, if you're not sure if you'll like this show or not, because I love the shit out of the show, and the music does get stuck in my head, and I do listen to it, just like I'd listen to Les Mis.

607
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:39,314
Rym: But, honestly, you could just watch the YouTube-- I should go listen to Les Mis.

608
00:41:39,334 --> 00:41:40,620
Scott: That's on Spotify, for sure.

609
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,579
Rym: Master of the House.

610
00:41:43,445 --> 00:41:43,707
Scott: See?

611
00:41:43,888 --> 00:41:44,370
Scott: There you go.

612
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:46,420
Scott: That song is, A, an earworm.

613
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,500
Rym: I mean, George was singing it in Seinfeld when it was first a big musical hit.

614
00:41:50,881 --> 00:41:53,367
Scott: It's an earworm, and it's expositional, right?

615
00:41:53,548 --> 00:41:55,833
Scott: You don't know shit about the Master of the House, right?

616
00:41:56,896 --> 00:41:58,440
Scott: The scene opens up, right?

617
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,058
Scott: You know, suddenly they're in this place, and it's like, "What's going on

618
00:42:02,098 --> 00:42:02,239
Scott: here?".

619
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:06,099
Scott: "Well, let me introduce to you the best character in this whole entire goddamn

620
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:06,340
Scott: play.".

621
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:06,808
Scott: And you're like,

622
00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:07,235
Scott: "Woo-hoo!".

623
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,418
Rym: I think part of your problem, though-- You don't know the Master of the House.

624
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:19,480
Rym: But part of what's going on, too, is there's almost a call to response, where the early songs in the show, they almost ask a question that they don't answer.

625
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:30,957
Rym: And then when the songs get reprised, like, "Water Baby" sings her song again, but in the beginning, the lyrics are like, "So that the people who won't do what needs to be done will finally do it,".

626
00:42:31,398 --> 00:42:32,760
Rym: but doesn't explain what the hell that is.

627
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:44,320
Rym: When the song gets reprised, they use the key to do the thing, and then it's like, "Oh, that's the answer to the question that was not answered the first time the song came

628
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:44,420
Rym: up.".

629
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:54,398
Scott: I think that's probably the final reason that at least I wasn't compelled to watch the rest of the show, is because, hey, it does have a terrible secret of space, right?

630
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,400
Scott: Lots of them, in fact.

631
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:08,700
Rym: The secret is, on one hand, not as good as I expected in one aspect, but the secret of season one, like, what's the key and what's the door to everything, pretty solid, actually.

632
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,041
Rym: Right.

633
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:13,380
Scott: The point is, though, it's just, it's so obvious.

634
00:43:14,322 --> 00:43:14,666
Rym: Obvious?

635
00:43:14,687 --> 00:43:15,739
Rym: What do you think it is, then?

636
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,427
Scott: I mean, I can't, I couldn't tell you exactly what the deal is, right?

637
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:26,154
Scott: But the general deal, it's like, okay, kids adventure, right?

638
00:43:26,215 --> 00:43:28,478
Scott: It's like, we know what's going on here, right?

639
00:43:28,578 --> 00:43:29,680
Scott: In general, right?

640
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,010
Scott: We don't know the specific details of this fantasy world, right?

641
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:36,400
Scott: If you really felt compelled to know that, yes, you would have to keep watching.

642
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:46,135
Scott: But I wasn't compelled to want to know that, and, you know, it's like, yeah, I can see that the, you know, good guys are going to go a little cute kid adventure here and win.

643
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:48,038
Scott: I know what the deal is, right?

644
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,580
Scott: Maybe I'll just skip to the last episode.

645
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,140
Rym: All I'll say is there's actually a significant body count.

646
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,120
Scott: Okay, cool.

647
00:43:55,001 --> 00:43:57,479
Rym: It's not quite as straightforward as you're making it out to be.

648
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:04,625
Scott: Also, each episode does have one of those, like, you know, learning lessons for kids, right?

649
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:07,867
Scott: Like, you know, it's like, Oh, is it better to play it safe?

650
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,509
Scott: Or should you be fearless and brave, right?

651
00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:14,092
Scott: It's got sort of those, you know, you know, should you should you go alone?

652
00:44:14,132 --> 00:44:25,700
Scott: Or should you stick together team right as the sort of, you know, the things that it actually, you know, has the moral lesson incorporated into the song and the plot, rather than being like, GI Joe says at the end.

653
00:44:26,101 --> 00:44:26,965
Rym: So I haven't seen it to the end.

654
00:44:27,005 --> 00:44:30,720
Rym: What I can say is the other thing it does that the reason I was really drawn to it.

655
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,480
Scott: Good for children, at least if they're old enough, I guess, but not too old.

656
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:38,307
Rym: It plays with the style, like the radically different styles a lot.

657
00:44:38,647 --> 00:44:45,100
Rym: And it's a minor spoiler, but the horse slowly starts turning into one of them and slowly gets and like slowly is drawn differently.

658
00:44:45,461 --> 00:44:47,440
Scott: Yeah, I figured that was come when it lost all the armor.

659
00:44:48,160 --> 00:45:01,700
Rym: So I guess say Water Baby goes to the human world or say Ryder comes to Centaur, like those kinds of questions do come up and it moves further than you might expect it to in that regard.

660
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,052
Rym: But I was pretty satisfied with it, having watched it all the way to the end.

661
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:06,960
Rym: I love the shit out of the show personally.

662
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,520
Rym: And I do highly recommend you at least watch some of it to see if this is going to be your jam.

663
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:15,759
Rym: I think the music is better produced than a lot of...

664
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:23,599
Scott: If you have Netflix, right, and you like animation, then watch it and see, you know, no one's going to make you finish it.

665
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:29,240
Rym: But honestly, I would say if you're not sure if you'd like it and you don't want to watch, like you only watch a couple episodes like Scott.

666
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:38,640
Rym: Worst case, you know, if you don't care about like spoilers, just watch that compilation of every song from season one, kind of just tells the story of the whole show in the span of 20-ish minutes.

667
00:45:41,184 --> 00:45:54,290
Rym: And some of the later songs are stuck in my head still, especially... I think there's another horse who is kind of violent in the real world and just fucking murders people left and right.

668
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,304
Rym: I think Becky Apples is a great character.

669
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,794
Scott: The best part of the show really is just.

670
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:06,270
Scott: they are very clever with the Centaur jokes, right, from the tornado and so forth.

671
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:10,414
Rym: One episode is just a riff on cats.

672
00:46:10,494 --> 00:46:20,410
Rym: They go to the cat-tar village and the cats re-enact basically the play Cats every single day rather than face the problem that clearly everyone is avoiding.

673
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,918
Rym: Like they're going to go town to town.

674
00:46:21,998 --> 00:46:24,050
Rym: Every town has a radically different style of music.

675
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:31,010
Rym: So every episode after those first three has a radically different like musical style of the songs for the area.

676
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,518
Rym: So the cats all sing like Cats musical songs.

677
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,490
Rym: The trees sing like modern folk song type stuff.

678
00:46:38,411 --> 00:46:46,470
Rym: There's a bear-tar who's a basement dwelling nerd collector, like that guy, who sings a very different style from that.

679
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:47,651
Scott: That seems fun.

680
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:55,330
Scott: Also it has the obvious, they're following the rainbow road, it's like this obvious Wizard of Oz deal, only they're visiting five wizards instead of one.

681
00:46:55,731 --> 00:47:00,350
Rym: And the wizards are all radically different from each other.

682
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,189
Scott: Shamans, they're not wizards, shamans.

683
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,476
Rym: Yeah, they're basically wizards.

684
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:06,310
Rym: Turns out Wabuu is basically flunked out of wizard school.

685
00:47:07,452 --> 00:47:10,430
Scott: It's visit five wizards of Oz plot structure.

686
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,783
Rym: But that all gets resolved before the end of season one.

687
00:47:14,004 --> 00:47:15,009
Rym: Like it moves pretty quick.

688
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:20,219
Rym: But I'll say I personally love the shit out of the show.

689
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,530
Rym: I do understand why Scott is like less into it.

690
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:27,119
Rym: But Scott, it'd be worth just watching the rest of the songs.

691
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:29,428
Rym: That's maybe ten more minutes of investment.

692
00:47:29,508 --> 00:47:29,930
Rym: Ten or fifteen.

693
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,957
Scott: Yeah, I already fast forwarded one song.

694
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,170
Scott: Why would I go listen to more songs?

695
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:55,250
Rym: Yeah, but maybe I'll do a separate final thoughts because the only actual complaint I have with this show is that in the final episode of season two, like the final few episodes, it did something that did not happen in Centaurworld up to that point, but it's something that I'm seeing commonly in popular media lately.

696
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:59,130
Rym: It's the same thing that happened in The Mandalorian.

697
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:12,110
Rym: There was a long scene that was basically just circular dialogue where characters argue about what to do and basically just go in a circle instead of moving on to the interesting thing.

698
00:48:12,531 --> 00:48:20,450
Rym: It only happens in this show in the final episodes, but I see it happening in a lot of media lately, more so than in some older media.

699
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,350
Rym: Especially Marvel shows are doing it in particular, but I'm seeing it everywhere.

700
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:28,998
Rym: The circular debate that just wastes four minutes of screen time.

701
00:48:29,038 --> 00:48:35,830
Rym: You could have used fleshing out the Nowhere Kings backstory a little more, fleshing out the general a little more, fleshing out the other humans a little more.

702
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:37,930
Rym: There was a little bit of a wasted opportunity.

703
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:49,550
Scott: I think you often see that either A) they got time to fill and they don't know what to do, or they feel like they need to make things explained more.

704
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:55,710
Scott: They want to make sure that everything is explicit, like everything is said.

705
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,850
Scott: And you know I prefer the abstract, the less said the better.

706
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:08,583
Rym: Also, just in terms of representation standpoint, many of the characters are directly openly LGBT.

707
00:49:08,703 --> 00:49:12,230
Rym: It is not part of the plot, that is just who they are directly.

708
00:49:13,973 --> 00:49:17,449
Rym: And the arcs around that are just really well done, I will say that too.

709
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:22,910
Scott: I mean, none of that came up in the first three episodes, but I had a feeling.

710
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:33,229
Rym: Yeah, there's a great episode, the cat plays, suddenly Zulia is the zebra guy, there's this tiger tar, and they both sing a big duet together about, "Oh, I don't know

711
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:33,469
Rym: him.".

712
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:35,613
Rym: They're both like, "Oh, I don't know

713
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:35,894
Rym: him.".

714
00:49:36,455 --> 00:49:41,930
Rym: Very clearly they know each other, and yeah, they have a history, they get back together in the end.

715
00:49:42,973 --> 00:49:43,167
Scott: Okay.

716
00:49:44,611 --> 00:49:46,798
Rym: But there's some surprising bits about all that too.

717
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:50,430
Rym: But yeah, I like the show a lot, I encourage you to try it, may or may not be your thing.

718
00:49:51,272 --> 00:49:58,110
Rym: And yeah, I'm curious what any of you who do watch at the end have to say about what the Nowhere Kings deal was.

719
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:10,970
Rym: Because I did appreciate the moment in season two, when you see some flashbacks, and you just see a deer, and the deer is clearly got some drama going on related to a human woman.

720
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:14,316
Rym: And that is the actual plot of this show in the end.

721
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:21,290
Rym: Other than the sort of real meta, like the allegorical plot, which is just Horse's transformation.

722
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:27,370
Rym: Was Horse really a violent, murderous warhorse who loved to feel the crush of skulls under her hooves?

723
00:50:27,971 --> 00:50:38,370
Rym: Or was that just a product of her environment, and maybe she becomes something different because she's in an environment that is not a war, and maybe that's actually what the show was talking about in the end.

724
00:50:38,951 --> 00:50:49,050
Rym: But the main reason I like this show is that it was intended to be two seasons, it was two seasons, it ended, and that is rare.

725
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:50,289
Scott: I do appreciate the ending.

726
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:54,084
Rym: Look at Dragon King, they had to be like, "Look, we don't know if we're even gonna have more

727
00:50:54,104 --> 00:50:54,525
Rym: seasons.".

728
00:50:54,626 --> 00:50:57,377
Rym: So we had to like- Dragon Prince, of course.

729
00:50:57,981 --> 00:50:58,906
Rym: The Dragon King is-.

730
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:08,630
Scott: I do appreciate the ending, but I also wonder if the ending is just a necessity of being so musical, you're gonna run out of songs, you can't go on.

731
00:51:09,631 --> 00:51:14,450
Rym: I get the impression the songs took a lot of effort, considering the high production quality.

732
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:15,829
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, you can't go on.

733
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:23,987
Rym: Especially because as the show moves on, more and more of the songs are duets or ensemble pieces that are extremely tight.

734
00:51:24,308 --> 00:51:25,070
Rym: That is hard to do.

735
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:30,770
Rym: Like, Martin Garrah was a bad musical, like I don't think- don't go look up Martin Garrah.

736
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:44,150
Rym: They had big ideas about it being the sequel to Les Mis in terms of popularity, but they had to write a lot of songs that had two to four tenors singing against each other, and there's a reason that musical cost too much to make and didn't succeed.

737
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:55,270
Rym: So yeah, it's Stemtar World, maybe Emily and I will do a Final Thoughts, because we basically steamrolled this whole thing as fast as possible once we got past the first couple episodes.

738
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,926
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

739
00:52:02,966 --> 00:52:07,960
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

740
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:13,340
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

741
00:52:13,621 --> 00:52:16,308
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

742
00:52:16,448 --> 00:52:21,020
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

744
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:28,910
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

745
00:52:29,091 --> 00:52:31,980
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

746
00:52:32,302 --> 00:52:50,740

Rym: The next station is North York Center, North York Center.

748
00:52:54,473 --> 00:52:56,500
Rym: And several people whose Patreon names I will not say.

749
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:04,159
Rym: So yeah, I'm gonna play root in a second, so I'm just gonna leave you really quickly with... Ugh, Jeffica.

750
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,880
Rym: I bet Becky's got perfect hair.

751
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,618
Rym: Jeffica's got stupid, stupid hooves.

752
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,659
Rym: I'm never gonna eat another apple ever again.

753
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:14,673
Rym: Ooh, it really bunches my wool to think how badly she hurt you.

754
00:53:15,034 --> 00:53:16,600
Rym: Baby girl, tell me a story.

755
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,379
Rym: I left my rider so that I could raise an army.

756
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,440
Rym: So that she could raise an army.

757
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:23,199
Rym: And the sea dog popped up and he said something alarming.

758
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,039
Rym: Ooh, well he's pretty.

759
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:26,040
Rym: He told me that my best friend's ridden.

760
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,144
Rym: No.

761
00:53:26,561 --> 00:53:27,839
Rym: Another horse so pretty.

762
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,519
Rym: And her name is Becky Apples because of course it is.

763
00:53:31,842 --> 00:53:33,699
Rym: Becky Apples, Becky Apples.

764
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,459
Rym: Oh, what a gorgeous, fancy schmuck.

765
00:53:35,882 --> 00:53:37,419
Rym: Becky, how do you like an apple?

766
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,099
Rym: Because I think your apples suck.
