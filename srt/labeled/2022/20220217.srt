1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:07,800
Scott:

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,398
Rym: It's Thursday, February 17th, 2022.

3
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:09,719
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,815 --> 00:00:13,289
Scott: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,694
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

6
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:19,270
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about, for the second time, The Tale of Genji.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,258
Rym: I'm sure we might reference it off and on in the future.

8
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,969
Rym: It's part of the lexicon of things I've read that I have thoughts on.

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,750
Rym: But if you missed it, you know, The Tale of Genji was the GeekNights book club.

10
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:34,261
Rym: We talked at length about why it took so long to read it.

11
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:36,007
Rym: It wasn't just because we were slow.

12
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:37,070
Rym: There was a lot of other things going on.

13
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:38,954
Scott: We spent on this one book.

14
00:00:39,214 --> 00:00:46,970
Scott: Now, in the past two months, I've read 1.9 books that aren't The Tale of Genji.

15
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:55,910
Rym: But we already did an episode talking about the plot, the story, Genji himself, like our reactions to it just as a novel.

16
00:00:56,531 --> 00:01:12,670
Rym: And because that took over an hour and we spent two years in this liminal space of not reading The Tale of Genji, and many of you have read it, at least I hope you have, there are only two people watching this live stream so I can see the relative interest in the second Genji episode compared to other topics.

17
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:14,477
Scott: But that's fine.

18
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:15,321
Scott: Yeah, that's fine.

19
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,250
Scott: I'm going to spend two and a half years reading a book.

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,189
Rym: You're going to spend two and a half years hearing about it.

21
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:22,129
Scott: I'm going to spend two podcasts talking about it at least.

22
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:31,530
Rym: But this episode is a combination of all the things we wanted to say that we couldn't get out because, you know, we talked for over an hour in episode one.

23
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:32,772
Rym: We were tired and hungry.

24
00:01:33,153 --> 00:01:42,109
Rym: But two, the meta, like the things around the book that aren't just the story itself because we had an hour of just...

25
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:55,750
Scott: Because if this hadn't been the first novel written a long ass time ago in Japan, and if this, you know, if a book like this was written just a couple hundred years ago, right?

26
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:58,190
Rym: Kind of trashy romance story.

27
00:01:59,092 --> 00:02:01,957
Scott: And there was some other novel that was the first novel.

28
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:09,070
Scott: This book would be, you know, not studied by scholars, not remembered, not, you know, significant really.

29
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:18,670
Rym: Well, the end of the book even mentions other works that are referenced or mentioned in The Tale of Genji that are real close to being novels but don't quite make it.

30
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:20,074
Rym: Yeah, I'm not sure.

31
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:23,828
Scott: I tried to research what counts as a novel and basically it just...

32
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,590
Rym: Oh, you want to find a community of people who have different opinions on what that means?

33
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:29,311
Scott: Sure.

34
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:47,750
Scott: It's like there isn't actually a complete agreement that this is the first novel, but, you know, I didn't really see any... It's like there was an agreement that I couldn't find people saying that this is definitely the first novel 100%, but I didn't see anyone referring to anything else as a potential first novel, right?

35
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:50,537
Scott: It's like the only nominee.

36
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:55,870
Scott: It doesn't get a unanimous vote, but there aren't any other nominees, so that's why it's the first novel.

37
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,111
Rym: Novel.

38
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:59,790
Rym: A fictitious prose narrative of book length typically...

39
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,110
Scott: Is that what Wikipedia says?

40
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,949
Rym: That's just the dictionary definition from Oxford Languages, it looks like.

41
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:05,870
Scott: Okay.

42
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:14,010
Rym: A fictitious prose narrative of book length typically representing character and action with some degree of realism.

43
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:16,707
Scott: Some degree of...okay.

44
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:22,049
Rym: Comes from Italian, French, Latin, Latin, Latin, Novus.

45
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,291
Scott: Sure.

46
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:27,730
Scott: But yeah, you know, it's like anything older than this...

47
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,390
Rym: Which means new, a sense of novelty.

48
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:30,590
Scott: Right.

49
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:42,290
Scott: So anything older than this is going to be like, you know, not in, you know, a long prose form, like a poem is not a long prose form, right?

50
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:48,350
Rym: Or it's a long form that involves prose, but comes from a non-written literary tradition.

51
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:48,930
Rym: Right.

52
00:03:48,950 --> 00:04:02,590
Scott: It could be a spoken tradition or a musical tradition or something, you know, some other sort of, you know, it's like, you know, a movie is not a novel, even though it's a long story about people.

53
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,930
Scott: It's fictional, right?

54
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:04,300
Rym: Yeah.

55
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:09,427
Scott: Because it's not text, so it's like, you know, a short story is not a novel.

56
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:10,110
Scott: Why it's too short?

57
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:20,589
Scott: I don't know what the line is between...because there's some short novels out there, but especially...lines get really blurry because, like, you can have an adult short story, right?

58
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,687
Scott: It's going to be longer than a kid's novel.

59
00:04:25,154 --> 00:04:26,048
Scott: But, you know, whatever.

60
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,430
Scott: So yeah, we're going to talk about meta stuff, right?

61
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:36,830
Scott: I think we should start, which is when I chose this book, you know, like I knew the book existed, but I didn't really know what it was about.

62
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:43,690
Scott: I knew it was, like, a big historical deal, and I figured, you know, ah, this is one of those things that's referenced very often.

63
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,945
Rym: Well, like, when we read The Odyssey, or, like, we both read a lot of old works.

64
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:49,390
Rym: They're very fascinating to read.

65
00:04:50,050 --> 00:05:00,230
Scott: Right, but it's, you know, I'm like, this is an old, significant, often referenced work, so therefore I should become knowledgeable about it so that when it's referenced, I get the reference.

66
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:08,410
Scott: You know, I have a greater context and understanding of other works, right, even if I don't, you know, whether or not I enjoy this work or not, which I didn't know at the time.

67
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,773
Scott: I keep hearing it come up.

68
00:05:11,014 --> 00:05:16,050
Scott: If I hear anything, basically if I hear anything come up too often, well, there must be something to it, right?

69
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:34,070
Scott: And then, you know, I think I said this before, there was an exhibit about the book at The Met, right, which I can just take the subway to in a few minutes, and I saw, I woke up one morning on a weekend, and I saw on Twitter, they're like, yeah, last weekend for the exhibit, and I was like, I'm not fucking doing anything.

70
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,999
Scott: Just walk my ass over there, right?

71
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:42,530
Scott: And at that exhibit, I learned many fascinating things that I will now discuss, right?

72
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:50,206
Scott: So the first thing is that this book, when it was originally released, was released in separate books.

73
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:52,030
Scott: It wasn't one giant book like we read.

74
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,032
Scott: It was all.

75
00:05:53,072 --> 00:06:07,701
Scott: these chapters were coming out, you know, chapter by, you know, in smaller sections, which really reminded me of when you go to a Japanese bookstore like Kinokuniya, and you see that the novels come out in, you know, chapter by chapter.

76
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:11,410
Scott: I think one of our earlier Book Club books was Qteen Eighty-Four, right?

77
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:20,590
Scott: And, you know, we read Qteen Eighty-Four, you know, by Murakami, author Murakami, not artist Murakami, as one giant book, right?

78
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:26,630
Scott: But I think if you read Qteen Eighty-Four in Japan, I don't remember exactly how many, was it two or four?

79
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,789
Scott: It was some, you know, number of smaller books that came out one at a time.

80
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:39,090
Rym: And that's not unique to Japanese literature, like The Count of Monte Cristo was just a serial with like a little chapter revealed like every time.

81
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,383
Scott: Well, that was like in, that was in a larger publication though, right?

82
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,030
Scott: Like you would get like a magazine or something.

83
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,250
Rym: It was basically the Shonen Jump of its time, like hey, here's a bunch of short stories.

84
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:50,057
Scott: Of its time, I think.

85
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:55,430
Rym: But, as a result, in its time, very few people read that as one big work.

86
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,289
Rym: They would just read it like, oh yeah, The New Count of Monte Cristo was out in the thing, and I read it.

87
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:05,367
Rym: But then when we read it as adults, we read it as this giant book that's like a thousand pages long.

88
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:06,350
Rym: that took me a month to read.

89
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:08,029
Scott: It was real good.

90
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:11,276
Scott: So that goes back to what makes a novel.

91
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:18,410
Scott: See, I had erroneously thought that something that makes a novel a novel is that it's a chapter book, right?

92
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,750
Scott: That there are, you know, because a short story is not going to be, if you have two chapters, you can't be a short story, right?

93
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:25,535
Scott: That just makes sense.

94
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,270
Scott: So, you know, but if something's got chapters.

95
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,869
Rym: I've read short stories that included a like chapter two.

96
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:33,908
Scott: Maybe, but I, you know.

97
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,608
Scott: But they were still short, like under 50 pages.

98
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:44,750
Scott: My erroneous previous conception was that a novel is a novel, you know, one of the characteristics of a novel is chapters, right?

99
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,130
Scott: Well, I guess that doesn't seem to be the case.

100
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:53,810
Rym: Because the way I've thought about it, and this is not based on any academia, like this is just how I personally interact with novels.

101
00:07:54,471 --> 00:08:06,010
Rym: I think of novels as when you've got a relatively consistent story that progresses over the course of the work, of sufficient length, with an intentional ending of some kind.

102
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:12,090
Rym: Like that's kind of the broad area of how I've looked at novels in that I've read works older than the Tale of Genji.

103
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:25,230
Rym: And other than the Odyssey, very few of them had a lot of that intention of like this story starts here and ends here with a consistent cast-ish of characters at a relative progression of the plot.

104
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:37,429
Rym: And while many epic poems have that and do have an intentional ending, like we know how the Odyssey ends, it has a very, like it wraps everything up very neatly, but because it's an epic poem, I always did treat it differently.

105
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:38,851
Scott: Yeah.

106
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:46,490
Scott: So anyway, so, you know, the fact that it came out as these separate books, and actually at the exhibit we saw, like, you know, not the earliest.

107
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,835
Rym: Oh, none of those exist.

108
00:08:48,116 --> 00:08:51,330
Rym: All the originals are lost to time, with no exception.

109
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,931
Scott: Right.

110
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:56,077
Scott: These weren't originals, like, touched by the author, right?

111
00:08:56,297 --> 00:09:05,150
Scott: But these were, you know, extremely old published editions that, you know, noble people had back hundreds of years ago.

112
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:10,685
Scott: And it was several, it was like, they had, like, it was like all these books lined up, right?

113
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:12,450
Scott: Volume one, two, three, four.

114
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:18,906
Scott: And I could imagine that, like, you know, at the time it was probably like this, you know, this woman would write a volume, right?

115
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:23,164
Scott: And then I don't know how they would, you know, print it.

116
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:24,450
Scott: Was it like woodblock or whatever?

117
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:33,370
Rym: Oh, so it was, it's a specific style that was popular at the time, the Oriholm style, which is a little mini book, but it doesn't open like a normal book.

118
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,500
Rym: It's basically, imagine one long piece of paper that's alternatingly folded like an accordion.

119
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,851
Scott: Oh, okay.

120
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:42,118
Scott: But yeah, it's like they would produce enough of those, right?

121
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:47,510
Scott: And then they would get disseminated, probably, you know, by horse, I guess, is the fastest way, right?

122
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,136
Scott: It's like amongst all the other nobles, right?

123
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:56,590
Scott: And they'd be waiting for the next one the way that people today are waiting for, like, Netflix seasons to drop, right?

124
00:09:58,172 --> 00:10:01,260
Rym: So get this, I'm looking at the Wikipedia about Oriholm because I don't know a lot about this.

125
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:05,090
Rym: Obviously, if you want to know about the real history of The Tale of Genji, go read an expert's website.

126
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:12,810
Scott: I'm not going to, you know, I'm trying to avoid doing the thing where we, like, read Wikipedia and then just reiterate it because you can do that yourself, right?

127
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,270
Scott: I'm only going to talk about things that I'm aware of, you know, in my own brain.

128
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:29,430
Rym: But I was skimming it just to see if there's anything interesting and it points out that this style basically became extremely popular in Japan largely because of The Tale of Genji.

129
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:40,867
Rym: Like, it is noted as one of the earliest popular uses of it and one of the most popular books to appear in the history of the style was in the 12th century.

130
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,630
Rym: The Tale of Genji got more and more popular.

131
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:57,430
Scott: So yeah, so something else, right, so basically when I was at this exhibit, that was like one of the first things I noticed, right, was that sort of commonality that we had with these Japanese nobles from centuries ago, right?

132
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,902
Scott: It's like there was a serial work that they were, you know, it's like how much leisure did they have?

133
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:06,610
Scott: Well, in fact, The Tale of Genji gives us a lot of insight into their leisure.

134
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:10,010
Rym: Yeah, case in point, ask an average person, what the fuck is Genji's job?

135
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,111
Scott: Yeah, right.

136
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:14,035
Scott: It's like they didn't have any movies or video games.

137
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:20,263
Scott: It's like they enjoyed life, you know, watching archery competitions, performing theater for each other, playing music with each other.

138
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:21,605
Scott: They didn't have concerts to go to.

139
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:22,807
Scott: There wasn't like rock stars.

140
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:25,310
Scott: They played music, you know, for each other, right?

141
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:39,943
Scott: You know, because it's not like they trained the peasants how to play music, you know, they played Go and other board games, you know, and they wrote poetry and had poetry competitions and art competitions.

142
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:46,930
Scott: And, you know, these were the sorts of things they did for leisure, including reading The Tale of Genji and then talking about it.

143
00:11:48,671 --> 00:12:00,504
Scott: And it was interesting to see at the exhibit because I not only did I see that, but so many of the things were other examples of things that we had in common with, you know, us of today.

144
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:01,025
Scott: Right.

145
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:01,345
Scott: Who?

146
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:05,150
Scott: we don't consider ourselves to be nobles, but I guess relatively we are.

147
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:06,293
Rym: Oh, absolutely.

148
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:12,710
Rym: As we on our own dime, for the most part, are making a podcast for whoever happens to listen to it because we think it's fun.

149
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:13,851
Scott: Right.

150
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:20,260
Scott: You know, it's like how much we had in common with them, not only following serial artworks.

151
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:20,601
Scott: Right.

152
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:24,787
Scott: But I also saw there is like the poetry competitions.

153
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:26,890
Scott: It's like all throughout Genji.

154
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,036
Scott: People are communicating to each other with poetry in the poetry.

155
00:12:31,096 --> 00:12:32,718
Scott: They're dropping references to things.

156
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:36,083
Scott: How often do we just like insert Simpsons references into whatever.

157
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:36,344
Scott: Right.

158
00:12:36,404 --> 00:12:40,750
Scott: But if someone if I wrote some book with a Simpsons reference, like two knives.

159
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:41,451
Scott: Right.

160
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,616
Scott: And someone republishes that in five, six hundred years.

161
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:45,537
Rym: They'll be a footnote.

162
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,541
Scott: This is they got to put a footnote on that.

163
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:48,222
Scott: Two knives.

164
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:53,490
Rym: This is a reference to most his lack from a lost animated series we believe was called The Simpsons.

165
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,152
Scott: Hopefully they have a cyberspace.

166
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:57,656
Scott: They could just insert the clip of Mo going two knives.

167
00:12:57,817 --> 00:13:00,181
Scott: But you know, you get the idea.

168
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:00,882
Scott: The same thing.

169
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:05,730
Scott: They're constantly dropping references to Chinese poetry and shit in The Tale of Genji.

170
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:16,786
Rym: Well, to the point, there's one chapter that I even it's one chapter I actually kind of glossed over because the chapter was like dense and I didn't really understand what was going on.

171
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:17,527
Rym: We got to the end of it.

172
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:19,150
Rym: I went back and looked at the footnotes.

173
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:32,670
Rym: It was very clear that chapter was like unique among all the chapters of The Tale of Genji and that it was almost nothing but references to popular Chinese literature that readers of The Tale of Genji in its context and time would have recognized.

174
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:40,205
Rym: So that is like us stumbling into like a bunch of people are really into, I don't know, Twilight fandom.

175
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,970
Rym: And we have no idea what the fuck they're talking about.

176
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,471
Scott: Yeah.

177
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,172
Scott: So the other.

178
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,295
Scott: so it goes even further.

179
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:47,836
Scott: Right.

180
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:56,850
Scott: So this poetry nonsense, I got the feeling that it was a lot like today where you see like a sports anime come out and that sport gets popular.

181
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,232
Scott: I'm not sure.

182
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:00,073
Scott: Chicken and egg.

183
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:00,994
Scott: What came first?

184
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:08,465
Scott: But there were a lot of things that that exhibit about poetry competitions and people flinging poetry at each other.

185
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:12,010
Scott: And it was clear that like that's something that they were doing.

186
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:21,765
Scott: And I don't know if it was, you know, The Tale of Genji like got people interested in flinging poetry at each other or they already were.

187
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:24,930
Scott: And it sort of made it more popular or, you know, right.

188
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:31,399
Rym: Well, there's contemporary like current things that have like we've seen this happen where something is depicted in media.

189
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:32,961
Rym: People get interested in it.

190
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:39,330
Rym: Even though it was a thing, it becomes more popularized and more people make it a thing or start doing it.

191
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,377
Rym: And it's like hackers did some of that with like hacking culture.

192
00:14:43,477 --> 00:14:50,730
Rym: But War Game really did that because that movie war dialing was extremely unknown and not common.

193
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:52,111
Rym: I don't know.

194
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:56,539
Rym: I want to even say that war dialing was not a agreed upon term before that movie.

195
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:03,370
Rym: But after that movie, a million kids, including me, like got really into hacking and learned about it because of the movie.

196
00:15:03,691 --> 00:15:10,463
Rym: But then that fed into this mythos around hacking to where people didn't realize how popular that movie made it specifically.

197
00:15:10,964 --> 00:15:14,430
Rym: yet watched that movie and thought, oh, yeah, this is describing the hobby that I'm into.

198
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,395
Rym: Like it's a it's definitely a feedback loop.

199
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,340
Rym: And we've seen this time and time again.

200
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:22,129
Scott: Now, this sort of becomes obvious once I mention it.

201
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:22,470
Scott: Right.

202
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,693
Scott: And this is this is the real.

203
00:15:23,753 --> 00:15:24,655
Scott: this is the bomb.

204
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:25,256
Scott: Right.

205
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:26,940
Scott: It's sort of common sense.

206
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,265
Scott: But you go I was at the Met.

207
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:29,586
Scott: It's an.

208
00:15:29,706 --> 00:15:30,869
Scott: it's an art museum.

209
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:31,370
Scott: Right.

210
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,715
Scott: But they had an exhibit about a book.

211
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:35,358
Scott: So what are they going to show there?

212
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:35,819
Scott: It's like.

213
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,323
Scott: it's not paintings.

214
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,926
Scott: It's not sculptures.

215
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:39,908
Scott: It's not right.

216
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:40,770
Scott: It's just a book.

217
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:47,060
Scott: So this is like what was in the exhibit volumes of books and then like text on the walls explaining it.

218
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,400
Scott: Right.

219
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:53,430
Scott: It's like, no, the exhibit, the vast majority of it was fucking fan art.

220
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,332
Rym: Yeah.

221
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:59,322
Scott: It was ancient people hundreds of years ago doing Genji fan art.

222
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:02,710
Scott: They had screens that had Genji scenes painted on them.

223
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,673
Scott: They had like these people read this fucking thing.

224
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:06,374
Scott: Right.

225
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:16,666
Scott: And they had all their artists make them Genji musical instruments, Genji, all Genji, any Genji fans, like anything that you could put art on.

226
00:16:16,906 --> 00:16:20,670
Scott: Genji scrolls, you know, Genji inkstone.

227
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:21,771
Scott: Right.

228
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:22,793
Scott: It's like these.

229
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:25,238
Scott: get, you know, Genji is basically Genji merch.

230
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:25,779
Scott: Right.

231
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:31,370
Rym: It was like, you know, like the artist's alley of Genji merch, like, hey, check out this painting I made about Genji.

232
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:32,771
Scott: Right.

233
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:41,919
Scott: When Genji painted on the bamboo screen, like they had Genji T-shirts, there were Genji kimonos with like scenes of Genji in the in the fabric.

234
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:54,950
Rym: It was all, you know, the pick up artists of the late Heian era were like trying to be Genji and were like writing poems and like writing them on a little fan and like trying to emulate what they read in that work.

235
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,611
Scott: Right.

236
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:59,774
Scott: The kids today with and there was also fanfics too.

237
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:01,275
Scott: There was Genji fanfics too.

238
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:01,475
Scott: Right.

239
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:06,398
Rym: It's like there's even debate about some of the later chapters might have been collaborations or written by someone else.

240
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,362
Scott: Like there was every all this shit that people are doing today.

241
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:11,041
Scott: Right.

242
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,871
Scott: That different.

243
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:25,333
Rym: Look at Roman graffiti or look at OK.

244
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:27,134
Rym: Like, OK, the word OK.

245
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:28,776
Rym: Do you know the origin of that word?

246
00:17:30,237 --> 00:17:38,883
Rym: It's a meme from hundreds from a couple hundred years ago where people would make acronyms that were incorrect and spelled wrong because they thought it was funny.

247
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:44,868
Rym: OK stands for all correct, spelled wrong with a K. And it was a meme from like the eighteen hundreds.

248
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:47,590
Scott: I don't know if that's right or wrong, but OK.

249
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:49,350
Rym: There was.

250
00:17:49,631 --> 00:17:52,653
Rym: I watched a documentary on this not that long ago, so it was fresh in my mind.

251
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:53,874
Rym: But is it OK?

252
00:17:54,154 --> 00:18:02,260
Rym: Memes like memes and pop culture references and like the idle leisure's of people who have the privilege to take idle leisure's.

253
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,621
Rym: Not much has changed.

254
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:16,510
Rym: And these old works only feel inaccessible because of the distance from that culture in the same way that even contemporary cultures are very inaccessible to people who don't know about the shibboleths and the details in the context of those cultures.

255
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:27,710
Rym: And that stood out very profoundly in the tale of Genji, because it's the first work I've read in a long time that is from a culture I know very little about.

256
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:29,031
Scott: I don't know much.

257
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:30,873
Scott: I didn't know basically anything.

258
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:31,173
Scott: Right.

259
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:39,180
Scott: It's like, you know, my knowledge of, you know, what Japan was like, you know, hundreds of years ago is basically limited.

260
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:50,090
Scott: You know, a very self-aware of this is basically viewed through the lens of fictional works like samurai movies, which obviously are no less than 100 years old.

261
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:52,193
Scott: Right.

262
00:18:52,534 --> 00:19:00,189
Rym: And like those movies are set in different eras of Japan from the Heian era that this is set in.

263
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,591
Scott: Exactly.

264
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:07,298
Scott: And that was even if there's any accuracy to them, you know, because it's sort of like.

265
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:17,010
Scott: if someone wanted to get, you know, the history of like, you know, 20th century, you know, the US and was watching The Godfather.

266
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:19,016
Scott: It's like, you know, how accurate is this?

267
00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:21,704
Scott: It's like that's what watching, you know, let me watch Seven Samurai.

268
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:23,249
Scott: It's like, OK, well, yeah.

269
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:35,570
Scott: But it was also Father was sort of somewhat at least closer to the time it was made closer to the time in which the events it portrays would have taken place.

270
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:40,220
Scott: Whereas samurai movies were made hundreds of years after.

271
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,130
Scott: Well, maybe not necessarily hundreds, depending on which era of Japan they were making the movie about.

272
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:51,970
Scott: But quite many more decades between the movie and the of the events, the fictional events would have taken place.

273
00:19:52,250 --> 00:20:06,770
Rym: But what is interesting is that it feels like the tale of Genji feels very true to many of the broad cultural strokes of that era, even though the specific events in this book are clearly fictionalized and exaggerated.

274
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,190
Scott: Because this book, unlike Godfather, right?

275
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:15,883
Scott: Seven Samurai, this book was made at the in the era of which it is portraying.

276
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,248
Scott: Like if I wrote a book today about the 21st century.

277
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:25,201
Rym: What if I wrote a book about like being a podcaster during this era?

278
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:27,024
Rym: Like I work in a tech company.

279
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:28,307
Rym: I got some money.

280
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:29,630
Rym: This is how I spend my day.

281
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:32,969
Rym: There's a bunch of chapters about Overwatch because I play it all the time.

282
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:43,290
Scott: Also, right, is that we know we don't know their real name, but we know that the author was the daughter of like some regional governor.

283
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:43,991
Scott: Right.

284
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:51,370
Scott: You know, not like a not like, you know, hanging out with the emperor, but like, you know, a noble person, not a, you know, a peasant, right?

285
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:57,730
Scott: Someone who obviously was literate, had access to paper and ink and, you know, all kinds of things.

286
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:06,110
Scott: And this not only tells you about the time, but also about the perspective of a person in that position at that time.

287
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:11,125
Scott: You know, you're seeing, you know, the world through that person's eyes.

288
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:12,430
Scott: They can only write what they know.

289
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,111
Scott: Right.

290
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:27,670
Scott: And I talked about how, you know, that's I think my guess as to the reason why you don't see a lot of things written about, like what was going on with, you know, wars or politics or peasants or commerce.

291
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:32,208
Scott: Because this person who wrote that wasn't engaging in those things and they didn't know about them.

292
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:32,770
Scott: Right.

293
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,022
Scott: They were hanging out, playing music, writing poetry, et cetera, et cetera.

294
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:38,246
Scott: So, you know, having a romance.

295
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:39,530
Scott: So that's what they wrote about.

296
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:51,350
Rym: But also they wrote in a way which may be a reflection of the reality of the time, maybe a romanization of the reality of the time, or may have been a pointed avoidance of difficult topics.

297
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:53,519
Rym: But this was published contemporarily.

298
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:55,949
Rym: Like it wasn't like this was an insider account.

299
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,747
Scott: Yeah, they wrote it and then nobles read it.

300
00:21:58,787 --> 00:21:59,230
Scott: So they couldn't upset...

301
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,735
Rym: See also, like Shakespeare.

302
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:04,206
Rym: Shakespeare couldn't just be like, "Yes, this king in particular, fuck

303
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:04,467
Rym: him.".

304
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:10,429
Scott: Yeah, Shakespeare didn't go to the Globe Theater and be like, "Fuck the current king who's paying for

305
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:10,629
Scott: this.".

306
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:15,949
Rym: So he wrote a lot of stories like, "Oh yeah, that past king was no good because he's not in favor with the current

307
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:16,110
Rym: royalty.".

308
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:26,150
Rym: So it's hard for me, as someone who doesn't know much about Hay and Erra, to know how much of this might have been her avoiding these topics.

309
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:33,490
Rym: But it seems like a lot of this writing was during a relatively stable and peaceful era of the Hay court.

310
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:46,270
Scott: Except as the story goes on, it seems like, you know, and I noticed this pattern in lots and lots of fictional works of the greatest, you know, most prosperous, wonderful times.

311
00:22:46,651 --> 00:22:48,675
Scott: I guess there's people who feel this way too, right?

312
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:51,080
Scott: Are always the oldest times.

313
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,210
Scott: And in this book, it's actually interesting in that the prosperous times are actually the beginning of the book.

314
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:07,690
Rym: It's the current times right up until Genji gets a little older and then it's the evil times where the government is getting more austere and there's political troubles that are never described specifically at any point.

315
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:09,652
Scott: Right.

316
00:23:09,672 --> 00:23:19,948
Scott: But something like Lord of the Rings, it's like things used to be fucking crazy good and then you're reading, but the story takes place in the third era or whatever, right?

317
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:21,230
Scott: Or things are not as awesome.

318
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:28,159
Scott: It's like, you know, King Arthur, it's like, okay, I guess King Arthur does get to the good times, but then the not so good, right?

319
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,764
Scott: There's always, it's always a downslope.

320
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:35,550
Scott: I very rarely read, I'm sure they exist.

321
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:36,514
Rym: Culture.

322
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:38,990
Rym: Every day forward in the future.

323
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:39,511
Rym: Star Wars.

324
00:23:39,591 --> 00:23:39,892
Rym: Old Republic.

325
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:41,076
Scott: Whoa, it's awesome.

326
00:23:41,116 --> 00:23:42,540
Scott: And then Star Wars, you know, down.

327
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,704
Scott: It's just a downward slope.

328
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:45,710
Scott: There's no, it doesn't go, it doesn't get great.

329
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,810
Rym: Of course, arguably the later movies point out that the Old Republic sucked and had deep problems.

330
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,150
Scott: Well, in some ways it sucked, but in some ways not.

331
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,315
Rym: Well, look at the culture books.

332
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,550
Rym: Literally every year that goes by, everything is better.

333
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,130
Scott: Well, culture, I guess would be the exception.

334
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,510
Rym: And the old times are terrible.

335
00:24:01,853 --> 00:24:03,690
Scott: I guess, yeah, culture is the backwards one.

336
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:06,858
Rym: A lot of optimistic sci-fi is like that.

337
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:10,930
Rym: It's always like we've come out of a dark age and we're entering an enlightened age.

338
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:20,690
Rym: But it's very telling that the Tale of Genji, and that's where I don't know how much of that was a reaction to maybe shifts in the author's life or things the author noticed.

339
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,717
Rym: How much of it might have been just them just getting, them just getting old.

340
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:31,990
Scott: because as people get old, right, you know, we see people just in our lives, you know, which are half over, right?

341
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,324
Scott: Like conservative people are always like, ah, the old days, right?

342
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:36,510
Scott: You know, the old days.

343
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:40,850
Rym: I look at Counter-Strike 1.6 and I think, thank Satan, there is Counter-Strike Go.

344
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:51,330
Scott: But I think there is a general, you know, wrong feeling of, ah, the great old, the good old days, right, amongst people, you know, all over the place.

345
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,130
Scott: It's not, you know, some one culture that feels that way.

346
00:24:53,170 --> 00:25:15,450
Rym: But another way to look at this, because I don't want to remove literary agency from the author because the story, everything feels great when Genji's young and doesn't have any responsibilities or problems or consequences, but then the story gets more melancholy and complex as Genji is an adult and has to deal with complications.

347
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:23,510
Rym: So that also, it fits the story of Genji growing up and seeing the world from increasingly broader perspectives.

348
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:29,550
Scott: So even if the world stays the same, right, getting older kind of sucks in so many ways.

349
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:36,270
Rym: I just turned 40 and I got to tell you, 40 ain't 30 and 30 ain't 20 in terms of certain physical parts of my body.

350
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,197
Rym: Look at you, left knee.

351
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:40,730
Rym: You betrayed me for the last time.

352
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,110
Scott: Especially people didn't live that long in this era.

353
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:43,751
Rym: Oh, yeah.

354
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:46,021
Rym: I mean, look at these emperors like, oh, no, he's 40.

355
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:47,507
Rym: Yeah, he's going to die any day.

356
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,190
Rym: Good Lord.

357
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:49,253
Scott: Yep.

358
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,170
Scott: Well, they didn't have medical science that we had, you know.

359
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:52,450
Scott: Yeah.

360
00:25:53,953 --> 00:26:05,890
Rym: But in terms of that meta too, it's interesting to see how radically differently, at least the translation we read, the book is structured differently as it goes on.

361
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,430
Rym: Chapters are written differently and that's something we pointedly avoided talking about in the first half of the show.

362
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:21,290
Rym: Pick any random chapter from After Genji Dies and it is just absolutely, I skimmed through one again before the show just to make sure I wasn't just, you know, those are the ones I read most recently.

363
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:22,774
Rym: No, it's like night and day.

364
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:26,605
Rym: The later chapters to a modern audience are just easier to read.

365
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:27,768
Rym: Full stop.

366
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:28,530
Scott: They have structure.

367
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,191
Rym: I don't know.

368
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:31,215
Rym: They tell you more about what's happening.

369
00:26:32,196 --> 00:26:39,830
Rym: A section will end and the next section just like either picks up where the last one left off or explains the setting change.

370
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,089
Rym: Like now we're in this other place and here's what this person's up to.

371
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:53,730
Rym: The first chapters were just like you'd have two characters talking and then suddenly two different characters are talking and you're not sure if they're in the same place or not and sometimes they aren't.

372
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,431
Scott: I highlighted a part.

373
00:26:55,471 --> 00:27:08,870
Scott: I looked through my Kindle for just the few parts that I highlighted when I was reading and there's literally a sentence in one of the middle chapters that's like, "Ah, yeah, you know, and the years went on such and

374
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,130
Scott: such.".

375
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:19,449
Scott: And it was just one sentence at the beginning of a paragraph and there's a footnote attached to that sentence and the footnote says, "This sentence covers a period of four

376
00:27:19,469 --> 00:27:19,729
Scott: years.".

377
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:28,180
Scott: And also I think I did mention there's like a paragraph where it's like, "Oh, yeah, an emperor died.

378
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:30,124
Scott: Another emperor took over and someone else

379
00:27:30,164 --> 00:27:30,645
Scott: died.".

380
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:33,430
Scott: And it was like that was in the middle of a paragraph.

381
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,178
Rym: Yeah, I'm back in like, "Wait, which emperor?

382
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:36,304
Rym: The current emperor?

383
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:37,369
Rym: Who's that emperor

384
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:37,550
Rym: now?".

385
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,192
Scott: Right.

386
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:47,590
Scott: But meanwhile, when Murasaki, the author's character dies, that's a whole fucking chapter.

387
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:54,770
Scott: It's all these different, you know, the time scales just keep getting out of whack.

388
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:59,830
Scott: But after Genji dies, the rest of the book has sort of a steady pace of things.

389
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:00,132
Scott: Right.

390
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:02,650
Scott: It's like this happened and this happened and this happened.

391
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:03,131
Scott: Right.

392
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:08,470
Scott: It's not just an artifact of the translator doing something different for those chapters.

393
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,738
Scott: It's like this.

394
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:11,268
Scott: They really are.

395
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:17,286
Rym: There is just there is more context as to where and there's fewer.

396
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:18,570
Scott: there's fewer characters.

397
00:28:19,313 --> 00:28:19,614
Scott: Right.

398
00:28:19,976 --> 00:28:22,330
Scott: There's less moving all over the place.

399
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:22,812
Scott: Right.

400
00:28:22,892 --> 00:28:25,240
Scott: Things are happening always in chronological order.

401
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,090
Scott: You don't have the overlapping stuff going on anymore.

402
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,170
Rym: The characters are a little simpler to like the characters.

403
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,721
Scott: The characters aren't changing their roles too much.

404
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:35,847
Scott: You always know who's who.

405
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:36,972
Rym: Yep.

406
00:28:37,453 --> 00:28:38,879
Rym: They're acting in character.

407
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:41,268
Scott: They have these, you know, it's only dealing with one plot.

408
00:28:42,311 --> 00:28:48,670
Scott: So it's like you can follow, you know, the characters pretty much have the same motivations and goals throughout the rest of the book.

409
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:57,850
Rym: But like it really feels like the early chapters are very disconnected from each other in that they're almost like, let's have a story where Genji has this kind of affair.

410
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:58,534
Rym: All right.

411
00:28:58,554 --> 00:28:59,769
Rym: Let's have this kind of affair.

412
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:05,530
Rym: And consequences are not like tied together or like they don't progress anything other than Genji's development.

413
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:07,436
Rym: And they're very standalone.

414
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:21,549
Rym: But also it almost reads like a, well, that's just what would have happened, which is a thing that a lot of in modern sensibilities like contemporary today, that's often the sign of a less apt writer like a George R.R.

415
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:21,790
Rym: Martin.

416
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,814
Rym: Like, I'm just going to.

417
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:24,965
Rym: Well, yeah, that wasn't a good story.

418
00:29:25,086 --> 00:29:25,930
Rym: What just happened there?

419
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,661
Rym: But that's logically what would happen.

420
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:28,990
Rym: That's what that character would have done.

421
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:33,650
Scott: I don't see the author as a not good author.

422
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:39,450
Scott: I see the author as it's like if you just watch old Olympics and it's like you watch the high jump gold medalist.

423
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,710
Scott: And it's like that was the highest jumper in the world at the time.

424
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:42,971
Scott: Right.

425
00:29:43,012 --> 00:29:45,950
Scott: It's they couldn't jump very high compared to how we jump today.

426
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:48,362
Scott: That's because it was 100 years ago.

427
00:29:48,764 --> 00:29:48,945
Scott: Right.

428
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:49,990
Scott: They couldn't jump that high.

429
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,034
Scott: Then they didn't know how.

430
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:51,979
Rym: Watch a sitcom.

431
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:54,290
Scott: Athletic training and all the things that we have.

432
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,855
Rym: Watch a sitcom like one episode.

433
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:59,130
Scott: This person didn't have Shakespeare to read.

434
00:29:59,730 --> 00:29:59,830
Scott: Right.

435
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:05,130
Scott: Shakespeare had other things to learn from, you know, and then other people had Shakespeare to learn from.

436
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:05,412
Scott: Right.

437
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:07,810
Scott: But, you know, Murasaki, Shakiba, what did they have?

438
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:08,192
Scott: Right.

439
00:30:08,232 --> 00:30:11,109
Scott: They had Chinese literature, the poems that.

440
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:11,330
Scott: Right.

441
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:18,270
Scott: It's like there wasn't like a whole bookstore full of novels that this this woman could read to learn to be a better writer from.

442
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,274
Rym: But look at the craft.

443
00:30:19,294 --> 00:30:23,330
Rym: Like the craft of media has changed so much because right now I'm watching a bunch of Star Trek.

444
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:25,670
Rym: So I'm watching old Star Trek and new Star Trek.

445
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:34,230
Rym: And it's very stark to look at TV shows from the 70s, 80s, 90s and like how they were constructed.

446
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:36,743
Rym: They feel very poorly put together.

447
00:30:36,823 --> 00:30:38,210
Rym: The scripts don't feel that good.

448
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,810
Rym: There's a lot of downtime and sort of dead ends and just the craft wasn't there yet.

449
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,995
Rym: And the craft has evolved.

450
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:46,390
Rym: Modern entertainment a couple decades later is denser.

451
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,156
Rym: The stories are tighter.

452
00:30:48,418 --> 00:30:49,383
Rym: They're more focused.

453
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:50,770
Rym: Like audiences change.

454
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,695
Rym: But also the craft advances.

455
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:58,270
Scott: So not but not only does it advance over a long period of multiple people.

456
00:30:58,471 --> 00:30:58,651
Scott: Right.

457
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:04,410
Scott: But you could see even with if you just forget the the later the post Genji's death chapters.

458
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:04,891
Scott: Right.

459
00:31:05,374 --> 00:31:07,866
Scott: You can see it advance within those.

460
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:08,730
Scott: Right.

461
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:14,830
Scott: The same way when you look at something like a webcomic and you see the oldest strips are like are way better to say.

462
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:19,070
Rym: I just looked at a penny arcade from twenty two years ago when Gabe proposed.

463
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:20,272
Scott: Right.

464
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:24,710
Scott: It's like you can see the artist improving their art just because they're doing it right.

465
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:29,387
Scott: The author of The Tale of Genji gets better at writing as the book.

466
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:30,090
Scott: the chapters go.

467
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:30,912
Rym: Absolutely not.

468
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:32,116
Scott: It's not.

469
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:36,370
Scott: I thought, you know, it was hard to tell because I was like, am I just getting better at reading this book?

470
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:37,615
Rym: Right.

471
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:38,218
Rym: Early chapter.

472
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,727
Rym: I still don't know what happened sometimes.

473
00:31:39,988 --> 00:31:40,270
Scott: Right.

474
00:31:40,591 --> 00:31:41,956
Scott: It's like that is a part of it.

475
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:45,990
Scott: You do get better at reading it, you know, as you go on and push through.

476
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:51,410
Scott: But no, the early chapters are written way worse, way harder to follow.

477
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:58,850
Scott: You know that, you know, it can't just be the translator getting better at translating because they clearly edited and went through how many times.

478
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,755
Scott: They spent their whole life studying the book.

479
00:32:01,096 --> 00:32:05,830
Scott: I don't feel like they put more effort into translating the later chapters than the earlier ones.

480
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:14,330
Rym: But like around when Genji gets exiled and then comes back and like that second the second phase, I guess, of the very hard to follow what's going on around there.

481
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:14,811
Scott: Yeah.

482
00:32:14,872 --> 00:32:17,289
Rym: But right after that, it just gets easier and easier to follow.

483
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:17,691
Rym: Yep.

484
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:29,350
Rym: But those ones, the third set of chapters, what struck me the most about the third part, like after Genji's death, is that the characters felt faker, but were easier to understand.

485
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:42,550
Rym: And their relationships felt very planned in advance in a way that it didn't feel to the reader, to me at least, in the early chapters that there was a plan for exactly how this was going to go down.

486
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:49,730
Rym: Like she was writing this almost chapter by chapter, but the later chapters feel like this was designed to wrap itself up in a particular way.

487
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:58,750
Rym: This character is going to be here to serve this purpose in the plot as opposed to this is a character that would make sense to be there based on what I'm writing about.

488
00:32:59,171 --> 00:33:03,010
Rym: I don't know if that was her motivation, but that stood out to me as a reader.

489
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:04,051
Scott: Yeah.

490
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:10,250
Scott: So, I mean, there's a lot of debates about, you know, who wrote what and, you know, because we don't know for sure any of these sorts of things.

491
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:10,391
Scott: Yeah.

492
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:12,301
Rym: This is from the like the twelve hundreds.

493
00:33:12,382 --> 00:33:13,790
Rym: Like this is a long time ago.

494
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,998
Scott: But my personal head, head cannon.

495
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:17,560
Scott: Right.

496
00:33:18,102 --> 00:33:20,729
Scott: Is that, you know, she started writing this thing.

497
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:21,373
Scott: Yeah.

498
00:33:21,393 --> 00:33:23,590
Scott: You know, just like for fun, like here.

499
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:24,351
Scott: Right.

500
00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:28,748
Scott: You know, wrote like a chapter or two about this awesome dude, Genji.

501
00:33:28,768 --> 00:33:29,149
Scott: Right.

502
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,064
Rym: Hey, you want to read about the hottest goddamn person to ever be born?

503
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:34,309
Rym: Well, I got a story for you.

504
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:35,652
Scott: Right.

505
00:33:35,692 --> 00:33:39,847
Scott: So wrote like a chapter or two and then people were into it.

506
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:40,670
Scott: Right.

507
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,537
Scott: And it's like, oh, I got nothing else to do.

508
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:42,938
Scott: Right.

509
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:43,882
Scott: And I love doing this.

510
00:33:43,902 --> 00:33:45,689
Scott: I'll keep doing it.

511
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:48,941
Scott: You know, and then there was demand for it now.

512
00:33:49,022 --> 00:33:51,130
Scott: So there's like pressure to like deliver on this.

513
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,470
Rym: Imagine even if it was just the court at first, like, like we start way back there doing gig nights.

514
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,578
Rym: Then some people like, hey, I actually like gig nights.

515
00:33:57,879 --> 00:34:00,710
Rym: Someone who isn't our friend contacted us once like, oh, someone's listening.

516
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:08,570
Rym: And so imagine now the author is like, well, I'm going to start like planning a little more or writing more or thinking about what would my audience want to see?

517
00:34:09,052 --> 00:34:11,202
Rym: I know I'll have him sleep with the wrong person.

518
00:34:11,242 --> 00:34:11,925
Rym: That'll be great.

519
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:12,949
Scott: Yep.

520
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:23,870
Scott: So, you know, you know, and then as over time they got better at writing, you know, maybe, you know, perhaps there were some parts where like they were reluctant to go on, but they went on instead.

521
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:24,612
Scott: Right.

522
00:34:25,137 --> 00:34:26,908
Scott: Who knows what was going on in their lives.

523
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:27,150
Scott: Right.

524
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:38,210
Scott: You know, a lot of the things I could, you know, I could imagine a lot of the things I see in the book happening to the author, you know, illnesses or having to move or, you know, who knows what, right.

525
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,001
Scott: All kinds of dramas, you know, incorporating those.

526
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:42,362
Scott: probably.

527
00:34:42,402 --> 00:34:45,270
Scott: maybe, you know, there could be things in here that we don't even know.

528
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:56,090
Scott: Like, you know, maybe some of the, you know, uh, there could be some like, uh, you know, like chapters that are basically distracts against real people that they knew.

529
00:34:56,591 --> 00:34:56,851
Scott: Right.

530
00:34:56,953 --> 00:35:00,766
Scott: Like the same way that like art musicians will sing songs about their ex.

531
00:35:01,007 --> 00:35:01,228
Scott: Right.

532
00:35:01,288 --> 00:35:01,529
Scott: Yeah.

533
00:35:02,191 --> 00:35:06,349
Scott: There could be some of that shit in here and you just don't even realize it that it's going on.

534
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:13,289
Rym: Um, you know, there were a bunch of moments where I would feel like that was true, but I did couldn't articulate it.

535
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,331
Scott: Right.

536
00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:18,561
Scott: Like, you know, like the right, you know, they have a character who's like, you know, portrayed negatively.

537
00:35:18,621 --> 00:35:22,130
Scott: and it's like, is that character someone they knew and they're portraying them in here.

538
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:27,890
Rym: Like especially Genji's wife in particular, it felt like, did you know someone who you really didn't like in the card?

539
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:29,331
Scott: Like, yep.

540
00:35:29,672 --> 00:35:31,837
Scott: Or you, you, you saw a story happen.

541
00:35:31,877 --> 00:35:37,949
Scott: So you write the story, you know, you, you know, you take a rumor you heard and write it down with other characters.

542
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:38,230
Scott: Right.

543
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,552
Scott: Something like that.

544
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:45,430
Scott: Um, but that, you know, so as for the chapters that come after Genji's death, right.

545
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:50,302
Scott: You know, it's not like the previous chapters, you see a gradual improvement.

546
00:35:50,703 --> 00:35:53,550
Scott: It's this sudden jump into a different mode of writing.

547
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,239
Scott: So obviously other, you know, people have all kinds of explanations.

548
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,630
Scott: It could be a different author, uh, in which case it's like a fan fiction addendum.

549
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:10,450
Scott: Uh, it could be, you know, you know, Oh, she stopped writing Genji, but we must, we must have more Genji and the emperor told someone to write more.

550
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:11,352
Scott: Right.

551
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:16,362
Scott: Um, you know, it could, you could imagine so many possible explanations.

552
00:36:16,402 --> 00:36:19,970
Scott: Maybe there was a, they got tired of Genji and they said, that's enough of that.

553
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:28,430
Scott: And then, you know, they were still alive and they were pressured to write more, but they were so much better at writing by that time that they were able to, but they didn't have enough new ideas.

554
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:34,086
Scott: And then therefore they produced, uh, you know, those, those ending chapters and then they passed away.

555
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:35,409
Scott: And that's why it ends sort of.

556
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,117
Rym: I did skim her biography.

557
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:42,650
Rym: Uh, I'm not going to like relate everything because, you know, go read it yourself or read the Wikipedia page.

558
00:36:43,011 --> 00:36:51,949
Rym: But one thing that was very clear is it's it, most people agree that she published it herself with her own ladies in waiting to a small audience, almost like a zine at first.

559
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:58,147
Rym: And it got popular and eventually patrons started to like fund it and it grew from there.

560
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,106
Scott: Yep.

561
00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:00,229
Scott: Yep.

562
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,778
Rym: Which that's how, that's, that's how webcomics happened today.

563
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:09,288
Rym: Like almost directly, like someone makes a webcomic, cost of money, 1200 something.

564
00:37:12,922 --> 00:37:13,006
Rym: Yeah.

565
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:21,230
Rym: But, uh, let's see what other meta can I think of around the tale of Genji that we didn't talk about in the first episode to avoid talking about Genji and the characters again.

566
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:27,430
Rym: But the thing that was just thrown out the most was how much easier those later chapters were to read and how tighter they felt.

567
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:28,452
Scott: Yeah.

568
00:37:29,934 --> 00:37:34,182
Scott: I guess we got, you know, I guess we can talk about, you know, I don't know too much about right.

569
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:38,790
Scott: What, what it was like, you know, the history of what was going on in that era.

570
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:51,550
Rym: That my knowledge of Heian era is that it was a deeply dysfunctional and extremely divided Japanese society where the nobles really didn't interact with normal people at all.

571
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:55,395
Scott: And I, I mean, that's what it seems like in the book.

572
00:37:55,415 --> 00:38:07,670
Scott: and the other, I think the number one thing that just like stood out the most in the book was, you know, how, uh, women were so like cloistered and secluded.

573
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:13,162
Scott: And like, you know, we talk about objectification of women in today's society, right?

574
00:38:13,222 --> 00:38:15,026
Scott: It's like, it's like literally.

575
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:16,790
Scott: it's like you own some women, right?

576
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,827
Scott: It's like there wasn't any woman that didn't belong to somebody.

577
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:20,350
Scott: Right.

578
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,637
Rym: Well, when there's a woman living on her own, it was always, it happens a few times in the tale of Genji.

579
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,563
Rym: It's always a like, yeah, who's paying her bills?

580
00:38:27,603 --> 00:38:28,324
Rym: Like what's going on?

581
00:38:28,345 --> 00:38:31,070
Rym: They're living in this decrepit house somewhere cause there's no man around.

582
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:32,010
Scott: Yeah.

583
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:36,018
Scott: Who's, who's take, you know, I need to make sure all my daughters are taking, you know, belong to someone.

584
00:38:36,078 --> 00:38:36,800
Scott: I'm going to die.

585
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,140
Scott: Right.

586
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:41,710
Scott: Someone's I had to make sure that each one has some man to take care of them.

587
00:38:42,591 --> 00:38:48,357
Scott: Uh, and like, you know, you can't let anyone, like you talk about modesty, like, you know, Victorian or whatever, right?

588
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:50,140
Scott: Like can't show any ankles and whatnot.

589
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:59,190
Scott: This is like, you cannot let anyone see you unless like they're your like father, uh, maybe not even your brother, you know, unless you're a child.

590
00:38:59,470 --> 00:38:59,671
Scott: Right.

591
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:05,442
Scott: It's like, you know, once you're, you know, I guess the donning of the train maybe is that comes up a few times in the book.

592
00:39:05,482 --> 00:39:08,728
Scott: I assume that some sort of adult coming ceremony.

593
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:09,710
Scott: I didn't research it.

594
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:15,877
Scott: Uh, but it's like, yeah, it's like, once you're an adult woman, it's like, nobody sees you except your staff.

595
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:19,181
Scott: You know, you're like your parents, right?

596
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:22,625
Scott: Uh, your children, uh, you know, your spouse.

597
00:39:22,645 --> 00:39:26,229
Scott: It's like you are, you are hidden behind walls.

598
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:26,810
Scott: Right.

599
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:35,418
Scott: Um, and that really struck me because even if you watch, you know, all sorts of, you know, samurai movies and stuff, right.

600
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:41,263
Scott: It's like, yeah, the women aren't, you know, they're hidden and protected, but not that level of right.

601
00:39:41,663 --> 00:39:48,849
Scott: You know, it's like, you'll still see scenes or like someone's bowing before, you know, the empress who's sitting there getting mad or something.

602
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:49,470
Scott: Right.

603
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:55,758
Scott: Um, whereas here it's like in this time, clearly the empress would be behind some wall and you wouldn't even know.

604
00:39:55,778 --> 00:40:05,490
Rym: It's like, you only know that they're there because you know, but what I do find interesting is these, this book portrays the rich inner lives of what is happening behind those walls.

605
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:08,954
Rym: And it shows like the interactions that actually happen.

606
00:40:09,014 --> 00:40:20,527
Rym: Like there's a, you know, the men have, they're, they're all hanging out together in the early part of the tale again, but you always see the echoes of the women behind that screen are all hanging out together and doing their own thing.

607
00:40:20,547 --> 00:40:23,570
Rym: And it's interesting to see that portrayed so directly.

608
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:38,590
Rym: So the other thing is I know about the Han era just personally, and again, I'm probably radically overgeneralizing is that that government was extremely incompetent and got more and more incompetent and incapable of running the country as time went on.

609
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,192
Rym: That's, that's a common trope.

610
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:46,217
Rym: I've seen like currency started to fall apart, like banking institutions collapsed.

611
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:49,280
Rym: Rice became the primary unit of exchange.

612
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,062
Rym: Uh, I pulled up the Wikipedia.

613
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:51,463
Rym: Oh God.

614
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:51,663
Rym: Yeah.

615
00:40:51,703 --> 00:40:52,064
Rym: Right here.

616
00:40:52,404 --> 00:40:54,066
Rym: The money circulation fell apart.

617
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:57,730
Rym: Rice became literally the primary unit of exchange.

618
00:40:59,751 --> 00:40:59,992
Rym: Yep.

619
00:41:00,072 --> 00:41:06,982
Rym: Get the reason they were giving gifts to each other so much, largely because there wasn't any other way to transfer value and transfer wealth.

620
00:41:08,183 --> 00:41:12,710
Scott: So in the book, yeah, throughout the book, they were constantly gifting things to each other.

621
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:22,381
Rym: When Genji goes into exile, like he's wealthy and he stops at a bunch of his storehouses, his wealth is big warehouses he owns filled with his shit.

622
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:29,570
Rym: And he goes and like gets stuff from those warehouses to bring with him, to give to people as gifts, to pay them basically.

623
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:30,811
Scott: Yeah.

624
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:33,636
Scott: Every, everywhere they go, they're constantly gifting, right?

625
00:41:33,756 --> 00:41:34,036
Scott: Yeah.

626
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:36,881
Scott: You know, here have some, you know, there's a ceremony.

627
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:40,387
Scott: Ah, they gave everyone gifts and whoever danced the best got the best gift.

628
00:41:40,568 --> 00:41:41,870
Scott: You know, it's like, yeah.

629
00:41:42,512 --> 00:41:45,185
Rym: But that was partly because there really wasn't a currency to trade.

630
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:46,190
Rym: You couldn't give someone a tip.

631
00:41:47,511 --> 00:42:00,430
Scott: I guess, uh, there's also, the book also talks a lot about th you know, these really small details, you know, you know, I guess in, in modern times you talk about it, like appreciating this, the little things in life.

632
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:08,699
Scott: Um, but there's a lot of text in this book dedicated to going through extreme detail about the little things in life, right?

633
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:13,684
Scott: Like they're constantly perfuming things themselves, papers, right?

634
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:17,869
Scott: Cause it's just like, there isn't that much sensory entertainment.

635
00:42:17,889 --> 00:42:19,050
Scott: There's no VR, right?

636
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,490
Scott: So it's like perfuming things, you know, looking at flowers.

637
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,685
Rym: They talk a lot about, oh shit, that's the good colored paper.

638
00:42:25,826 --> 00:42:26,530
Rym: Oh, God damn.

639
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:27,351
Scott: Right.

640
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:30,917
Scott: It's like they go to look at flowers the way that you would go to Disney world.

641
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:34,182
Scott: You know, it's like all this kind of stuff, right?

642
00:42:34,383 --> 00:42:38,870
Scott: These things that we would consider like simple pleasures are like big pleasures.

643
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,075
Rym: So I found a historical statistic that really puts this into light.

644
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:51,270
Rym: The aristocracy, the people portrayed in the tale of Genji are referred to contemporarily by a Japanese word that basically means the good people.

645
00:42:52,031 --> 00:43:00,179
Rym: And there were about 5,000 of them total in a nation of around five to 6 million.

646
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:10,289
Rym: And so 5,000 extremely wealthy people playing games and singing and living in this closed existence and five or 6 million people living in desperate poverty around them.

647
00:43:13,072 --> 00:43:13,273
Scott: Yeah.

648
00:43:13,313 --> 00:43:16,790
Scott: The book pretty much never talks about the people living in the poverty.

649
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:21,077
Rym: Remember way back I kept talking about that one scene with normal dialogue?

650
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:23,502
Rym: That never happens again in the book.

651
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:28,370
Rym: You never have a normal person say words other than that one scene in like chapter five.

652
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,797
Scott: And it even seems like, you know, it's like, okay, you've got like, you know, the empress.

653
00:43:32,937 --> 00:43:40,070
Scott: and the empress has, you know, women around her, but those women don't seem like they're peasants, right?

654
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:46,810
Scott: Those women are like, ah, yes, some merchant's daughter was sent to the palace to, you know, to, right.

655
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:50,897
Scott: It's like, you know, they're, and they're like sent, you know, they're sending each other's.

656
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:58,470
Scott: like, you know, some of their children who end up not being, you know, so high ranking are sent to work for someone.

657
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:01,494
Scott: It's like, you know, those are still like noble people.

658
00:44:01,574 --> 00:44:04,338
Scott: They're just lower ranked noble people.

659
00:44:04,418 --> 00:44:11,407
Scott: Like the actual peasant people, like planting rice, you know, doing actual hard labor.

660
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:13,630
Scott: People are like not even present.

661
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,957
Rym: All I can think of is there's a song in Centra World.

662
00:44:16,097 --> 00:44:18,927
Rym: Please, sir, tell me where food comes from.

663
00:44:19,107 --> 00:44:19,890
Rym: Like that song.

664
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:30,190
Rym: But the other thing that I see just skimming this around that era that was, that came up a lot in the Tale of Genji, they talk a lot about how difficult and dangerous travel is.

665
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:34,578
Rym: Like, your fence being broken is a big deal.

666
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:40,310
Rym: Like if your fence is not able to be sealed, they basically let the police forces completely collapse.

667
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:45,390
Rym: And there were just robbers and brigands anywhere outside of the walled cities and outside of the walled estates.

668
00:44:46,712 --> 00:44:52,430
Scott: And they're always traveling like in a, in like a wagon, like basically a thing with two wheels that someone's pulling.

669
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,309
Rym: Usually with a big entourage and armed guards and like heralds.

670
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,380
Scott: It's basically, it's similar to Oregon Trail.

671
00:44:59,561 --> 00:45:01,309
Scott: only humans are pulling instead of oxen.

672
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:09,350
Scott: Or, you know, like a, you know, a, you know, what's the call where you just people just pick you pick you right the fuck up, right?

673
00:45:10,497 --> 00:45:12,450
Scott: But I forget what those are called, Polonkin, whatever.

674
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:13,409
Rym: Or Palquins?

675
00:45:14,251 --> 00:45:16,199
Scott: Yeah, it's something like that, right?

676
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,470
Scott: People just pick you up and carry you through the street.

677
00:45:18,851 --> 00:45:20,718
Scott: But yeah, they always travel, right?

678
00:45:20,758 --> 00:45:22,444
Scott: Like with people, right?

679
00:45:22,504 --> 00:45:24,190
Scott: No one's just going and walking around.

680
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:28,550
Rym: Well, the book, it's very clear because a few times Genji goes off by himself or mostly by himself in disguise.

681
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:32,470
Scott: When he goes mostly by himself, he's like only with his trusted like five dudes.

682
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:33,834
Rym: Yeah, that's what I was about to get at.

683
00:45:34,155 --> 00:45:38,909
Rym: Genji going off like surreptitiously is still this giant like entourage.

684
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,730
Rym: They're just wearing what I imagine are flimsy disguises and nobody's fooled.

685
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:48,210
Scott: Well, I think it's more like if he's only traveling with five or ten dudes, he must be a lower ranked.

686
00:45:48,434 --> 00:45:48,590
Scott: Yeah.

687
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:51,564
Scott: You know, you're trying, you're like almost the emperor, right?

688
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:52,890
Scott: You're pretty close, right?

689
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,246
Scott: The emperor would come out with like a fucking army, right?

690
00:45:56,031 --> 00:45:57,076
Rym: It's like a Monty Python.

691
00:45:57,137 --> 00:45:57,961
Rym: How do you know he's a king?

692
00:45:57,981 --> 00:45:59,208
Rym: He hasn't got shit all over him.

693
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:00,633
Scott: Right, exactly.

694
00:46:00,673 --> 00:46:05,430
Scott: But, you know, so it's like, okay, well, normally when you come out, you come out with a hundred dudes.

695
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:19,427
Scott: So you come out with five dudes and that's your disguise as a lower ranked person who's, you know, so that maybe people, you know, you still got guards, but you wouldn't go out by yourself because people would be like, hey, there's someone who hasn't got shit all over him all by themselves.

696
00:46:19,447 --> 00:46:20,189
Scott: Let's fucking rob him.

697
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:20,872
Rym: Yeah.

698
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:25,630
Rym: And it's telling because, you know, there's like, then she sneaks away with that girl early on and they just go to an event.

699
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:30,284
Rym: There's a lot of abandoned structures and abandoned estates all over the place.

700
00:46:30,766 --> 00:46:32,110
Rym: Like you feel that in the books.

701
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,955
Scott: And well, some of them is like become abandoned.

702
00:46:35,035 --> 00:46:35,175
Scott: Right.

703
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:42,890
Scott: And you can see that like in the story, it's like, ah, a family was here and then a dude died or a dude moved or someone got married.

704
00:46:43,732 --> 00:46:43,932
Scott: Right.

705
00:46:43,972 --> 00:46:53,010
Scott: And just the way that the families and the hierarchy is structured and shifts, it's like, you know, the, the great, you know, even, you know, the, the Roku Joe, right.

706
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:56,315
Scott: Genji's house on the sixth street, right.

707
00:46:56,355 --> 00:47:05,170
Scott: The Roku, um, you know, which is like the, the big, like central location of the majority of the book where most of the action is.

708
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:25,590
Scott: It's like, it had its Heyday when Genji was there with all his wives and then, you know, people are still there, but after Genji dies, you know, you can, you can tell, even though it doesn't come up in the story very much at that place, like declines, you know, cause there's not really, you know, there's no Genji, no great person living there anymore.

709
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,173
Scott: There's like the remnants of Genji's family living there.

710
00:47:28,193 --> 00:47:28,914
Scott: Right.

711
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:35,101
Scott: And as they move out or marry other people or die, it's like that place goes downhill.

712
00:47:35,641 --> 00:47:43,090
Scott: And if it's not up kept, then, you know, and there's not a lot of staff working there that who the hell wants to live there.

713
00:47:43,651 --> 00:47:43,891
Scott: Yeah.

714
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:54,490
Scott: You would, you would need to wait for it to be like completely empty and then for someone to need a new house to go in there and take it and refreshing it is someone with a lot of power and money and whatnot.

715
00:47:55,210 --> 00:48:08,910
Rym: Um, and that's kind of how the hand era eventually ended is that the nobility was so rich and so disconnected that basically the, what little military they're maintained, like people like Genji who ostensibly was a captain to the guard or whatever at one point.

716
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,611
Scott: Yeah.

717
00:48:09,631 --> 00:48:16,619
Scott: A lot of the people have military titles, you know, the, the, the, the, you know, the whatever of war, right?

718
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:25,990
Scott: All these people, but it was an era of mostly, you never see any, the only military stuff you see will be like for entertainment, like boat archery competitions or horse riding.

719
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:35,549
Rym: So basically later on, like post when the tale of Genji was set, the people who were actually doing the military work kind of just took over because no one could stop them.

720
00:48:37,156 --> 00:48:37,464
Scott: Hmm.

721
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:53,350
Rym: But it's interesting to read this from the perspective of we're seeing like this narrow glimpse into and some by some arguments, the height of hand culture, like the most peaceful era right before it collapsed.

722
00:48:53,991 --> 00:49:08,370
Rym: Like it didn't last that much longer after the era that was portrayed, but at the same time, we're seeing the height only from the perspective of the people who were living the, the best wealthiest lives within what was otherwise an extremely broken society.

723
00:49:09,972 --> 00:49:15,170
Rym: Very similar to many times throughout history, including our own time right now.

724
00:49:15,354 --> 00:49:15,502
Rym: Yeah.

725
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:16,710
Scott: Yeah.

726
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:30,690
Scott: But you know, it's like, even though these people were like, you know, the extremely wealthy 1%, you know, there's at least in the book, there's no depiction of them doing like incredibly cruel things.

727
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:32,186
Rym: No, they're just doing nothing.

728
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:34,789
Rym: Like the outside world just doesn't exist.

729
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:35,810
Scott: Right.

730
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,730
Scott: It's like they're living a life of leisure.

731
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,210
Scott: And, you know, enjoying wondrous arts.

732
00:49:41,597 --> 00:49:41,730
Scott: Right.

733
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,130
Scott: You know, some of them are very religious.

734
00:49:44,437 --> 00:49:44,690
Scott: Right.

735
00:49:44,851 --> 00:49:47,429
Scott: You know, and they actually give up worldly things.

736
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:55,170
Rym: You know, and that was the theme in hand era too, especially as Buddhism started to become popular among the nobles, then you'd see a lot of that.

737
00:49:55,491 --> 00:49:57,289
Rym: There were a bunch of emperors who were like, fuck it.

738
00:49:57,735 --> 00:49:58,308
Rym: I'm a monk now.

739
00:49:58,554 --> 00:49:59,129
Rym: You're on your own.

740
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,410
Rym: Good luck.

741
00:49:59,532 --> 00:49:59,766
Rym: Have fun.

742
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:00,520
Scott: Yeah.

743
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,569
Scott: A lot of women want to become, you know, nuns.

744
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:03,890
Rym: Well, you saw that in Europe.

745
00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:09,530
Rym: A lot of women, if you look at like different parts of European society and different eras in the medieval times.

746
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:12,550
Rym: I can live this horrible life and marry that shit bag.

747
00:50:12,671 --> 00:50:15,549
Rym: Or I can go join a nunnery and escape all that.

748
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:17,245
Rym: A lot of people would choose the nunnery.

749
00:50:20,014 --> 00:50:21,925
Rym: I mean, even Genji's grooms of life.

750
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,350
Scott: If it wasn't for the religion part, you know, being like even a Christian monk, right?

751
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:30,610
Scott: It's like, that's kind of, you know, it's kind of cool except for the Christian part.

752
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:37,250
Rym: Well, it's also a way to escape the like the actual violent reality of the society outside of that institution.

753
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:38,730
Scott: I think that's what's appealing.

754
00:50:38,831 --> 00:50:42,110
Scott: If I think about becoming, you know, some sort of religious monk.

755
00:50:42,398 --> 00:50:42,670
Scott: Right.

756
00:50:43,151 --> 00:50:45,770
Scott: It's like the religious part isn't the appealing part.

757
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,950
Scott: The escape capitalism is the appealing part.

758
00:50:48,552 --> 00:50:52,549
Scott: It's like it's like a. it's like the one way to escape capitalism is to win at it.

759
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:53,018
Scott: Right.

760
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,090
Scott: You have so much money.

761
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,230
Scott: You don't have to do anything anymore.

762
00:50:55,330 --> 00:51:05,745
Scott: But another way is like, yeah, there's some organization like a church or whatever, you know, or even though you're living an ascetic life of some kind, you know, it's still a life.

763
00:51:06,032 --> 00:51:08,410
Scott: It's not, you know, it's not the worst.

764
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:08,950
Scott: Right.

765
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:11,850
Scott: It's not like homeless, you know, absolute destitution.

766
00:51:12,731 --> 00:51:24,747
Scott: And, you know, you're if you can enjoy the smaller things in life, you know, like, you know, nice smells and tasty foods and whatnot, you know, like Belgian monks making delicious beers, which I don't even like.

767
00:51:25,617 --> 00:51:26,248
Scott: Stuff like that.

768
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:27,113
Scott: It's like.

769
00:51:27,133 --> 00:51:36,510
Scott: that can be a fulfilling life, you know, and if you have the opportunity to do it, then it could be a good choice, even if you're an extremely wealthy emperor.

770
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,710
Scott: That could be an appealing choice.

771
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:41,210
Scott: Get away from all this fucking drama in this palace.

772
00:51:41,659 --> 00:51:41,889
Scott: Right.

773
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:49,830
Scott: It's like or avoid getting married off to some just random rags at some dude you hate is going to treat you like property.

774
00:51:50,292 --> 00:51:55,129
Scott: You know, but if you're I guess if you're a peasant, you probably don't even have the opportunity to go become a monk.

775
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:55,844
Scott: You know.

776
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:01,290
Rym: Well, even though when he's living in exile, there's that family and they're like, oh, we got a bandit.

777
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:06,226
Rym: We got to hook our daughter up with Genji because this is like the richest person who's ever going to come to this town again.

778
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,089
Scott: All right.

779
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,970
Scott: Is there anything else to say about this book?

780
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:14,489
Scott: I guess we're never going to have to talk about it again on this show.

781
00:52:14,896 --> 00:52:15,047
Scott: Nope.

782
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:17,509
Rym: I I'm glad we read it.

783
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:18,903
Rym: Like, I enjoyed reading it.

784
00:52:19,711 --> 00:52:19,815
Scott: I did.

785
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,849
Scott: You know, it's not like my favorite book.

786
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:30,709
Scott: But and I, I guess I was disappointed in that there's not actually I don't have an encounter as many references to it as I expected in other words.

787
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:39,069
Rym: It's good to know about it, though, like not not every nice book club book is going to be like a bad a thousand hit with us.

788
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,190
Scott: This was I did learn a lot.

789
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:42,528
Scott: I did learn a lot of things.

790
00:52:43,835 --> 00:52:45,010
Rym: You know, I got interested.

791
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:51,048
Rym: I got more to actually got interested enough in hay in history to start reading like high level like this.

792
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:55,150
Rym: It's an era I'd like to know more about, but I'm not going to become an expert on it.

793
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:55,592
Rym: But I want to.

794
00:52:55,853 --> 00:53:01,149
Rym: I would have a working knowledge of that era, which I did not have in any capacity before I read this book.

795
00:53:01,571 --> 00:53:08,090
Rym: And I'm close to having like a very broad strokes like I would have about Europe during that time knowledge.

796
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:17,330
Scott: But, you know, my secondary reason, right, my primary reason of trying to, you know, get more literary references between things.

797
00:53:17,491 --> 00:53:19,029
Scott: I didn't really pan out so much.

798
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:35,190
Scott: But my secondary reason of drawing parallels between, you know, the people of today and the people of then in terms of media culture and also, you know, the form of the novel parallels between current novels and the original novel.

799
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:36,112
Scott: Right.

800
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,909
Scott: As I think that I batted a thousand on.

801
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:38,414
Scott: Right.

802
00:53:38,454 --> 00:53:38,738
Scott: Oh, yes.

803
00:53:38,778 --> 00:53:39,630
Scott: Just so right.

804
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:43,430
Scott: It's like you can see exactly where it's like, oh, I have an example.

805
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:43,831
Rym: I got.

806
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:45,143
Rym: well, I mentioned that star years ago.

807
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,850
Scott: The reason I think this is what counts as a novel today.

808
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:51,569
Scott: And you can see exactly how they line up.

809
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:52,131
Rym: Yeah.

810
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:56,271
Rym: But I mentioned the Star Trek stuff because I'm watching a lot of older media lately.

811
00:53:57,414 --> 00:54:03,511
Rym: And I've really like it really stands out the differences in like the craft over time.

812
00:54:03,551 --> 00:54:14,910
Rym: But it also stands out that older media has the same fundamental truths because humans have the same fundamental interests when not subverted by situation, circumstance, capitalism, et cetera.

813
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:15,051
Scott: Yep.

814
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:26,848
Scott: Even in this completely different culture, completely different language, completely different circumstances, you know, they're passing memes around and enjoying music and trying to escape capitalism.

815
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,770
Scott: The humans are still human.

816
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:29,735
Scott: Right.

817
00:54:29,755 --> 00:54:30,239
Scott: They didn't have.

818
00:54:30,279 --> 00:54:31,469
Scott: capitalism wasn't invented yet.

819
00:54:31,971 --> 00:54:39,630
Scott: But it's like they still have all these things that are just innately human that we can you know, we can see the same motivations.

820
00:54:40,191 --> 00:54:41,309
Scott: You know, we see jealousy.

821
00:54:41,672 --> 00:54:45,070
Scott: You know, all these same same things that we see today.

822
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,829
Scott: You know, fan art.

823
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:54,110
Rym: Well, thus so the the the act of making an increasingly distant from current culture.

824
00:54:54,231 --> 00:54:57,750
Rym: Simpsons reference is, in fact, echoing the tale of Genji.

825
00:54:58,133 --> 00:54:59,789
Rym: And therefore, I will continue to do this.

826
00:55:00,151 --> 00:55:06,609
Rym: And when I'm 90 and I write, I reference the I reference The Simpsons and the kids have no idea what I'm talking about.

827
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:16,990
Scott: That's no different than someone in the tale than this author referencing some Chinese poem that everyone at that time who is noble would know about in the tale of Genji.

828
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:24,523
Rym: I can't say how many times in the tale of Genji I would read like a short section, like one quote paragraph, and it would get this feeling of.

829
00:55:25,005 --> 00:55:26,210
Rym: this is a joke I don't get.

830
00:55:26,611 --> 00:55:28,090
Rym: This is referencing something I don't get.

831
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,350
Rym: This is clearly intended.

832
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,575
Scott: The footnote would tell you.

833
00:55:30,616 --> 00:55:39,790
Scott: the footnote tells you, ah, yes, this this is a reference to, you know, because they would make an analogy like, yeah, you smell like this something and it's like, what's the something?

834
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:41,390
Scott: Oh, it's it.

835
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,169
Scott: You know, it's a reference to this other poem.

836
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,449
Scott: But not every something was X.

837
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:51,005
Rym: Not every passage that gave me that feeling had a footnote.

838
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:54,649
Rym: because I wonder, you know, this has been a long time since this was written.

839
00:55:55,332 --> 00:55:59,490
Rym: How many references might be embedded in the text that aren't recognizable?

840
00:56:00,413 --> 00:56:00,827
Scott: That's true.

841
00:56:01,771 --> 00:56:02,452
Scott: Or how many.

842
00:56:02,532 --> 00:56:04,757
Scott: I literally became references themselves.

843
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:07,150
Rym: Exactly.

844
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:13,210
Rym: But at work a few weeks ago, I made a different Simpsons reference, like kind of casually as part of a conversation.

845
00:56:13,535 --> 00:56:13,968
Scott: Which one?

846
00:56:14,874 --> 00:56:16,190
Rym: Oh, it was actually it wasn't the same.

847
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,246
Rym: It wasn't two knives, but it was the most is like it was I was just going to cut you a little.

848
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,688
Scott: I was going to catch you.

849
00:56:21,991 --> 00:56:25,150
Rym: Yeah, like I was going to cut you because I was like, just cut you a little bit.

850
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:27,969
Rym: And like the guy laughed.

851
00:56:28,571 --> 00:56:35,929
Rym: But later we were talking and he was like and it was very clear that he thought I had made a joke on my own from nothing.

852
00:56:37,492 --> 00:56:39,650
Rym: Like, I was like, no, that was just a reference to The Simpsons.

853
00:56:39,955 --> 00:56:40,869
Rym: Like, I'm not that funny.

854
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,454
Rym: And it sparked.

855
00:56:42,936 --> 00:56:46,075
Rym: it sparked an interesting conversation with someone who is 20 years younger than me.

856
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,869
Rym: That just made me feel terrifyingly old.

857
00:56:49,171 --> 00:56:52,270
Scott: It's like you have not watched every Simpsons and Seinfeld episode ever.

858
00:56:52,471 --> 00:56:54,587
Scott: No, it's like some.

859
00:56:56,232 --> 00:56:57,381
Scott: Was there some noble?

860
00:56:57,401 --> 00:56:58,590
Scott: a hundred years?

861
00:56:58,912 --> 00:56:59,990
Scott: You know, I guess not even a hundred.

862
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:03,709
Scott: A few decades after the tale of Genji was no longer a big hit.

863
00:57:04,031 --> 00:57:09,636
Scott: I hadn't read all of the tale of Genji and then was missing references from grandpa dropping poems.

864
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:16,669
Rym: But does the tale of Genji itself have references that were just missed by translators and lost to time?

865
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:18,124
Scott: I don't know.

866
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:20,150
Rym: Someday will people not remember?

867
00:57:20,511 --> 00:57:22,123
Scott: I mean, the treasure could definitely be some.

868
00:57:23,391 --> 00:57:29,310
Scott: But the fact that these translators have like they basically these are people who spent their whole lives studying this one fucking book.

869
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:30,529
Rym: I feel like there aren't many.

870
00:57:30,892 --> 00:57:34,029
Rym: But I feel like it's still possible just due to the distance of time.

871
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:40,730
Scott: Anyway, that's that's the end of Genji's tale, at least as far as our lives are concerned.

872
00:57:41,152 --> 00:57:42,305
Scott: So I'm going to make the post.

873
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:44,489
Rym: It is official now.

874
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:46,970
Rym: The book club book, which we will do soon.

875
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:48,209
Rym: We're just going to give you some time to read.

876
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:50,070
Scott: I already finished reading this book weeks ago.

877
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,109
Rym: The City We Became by N.K.

878
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:52,684
Rym: Jemisin.

879
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,130
Rym: It's a it's a gig night.

880
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:55,606
Rym: See book.

881
00:57:55,812 --> 00:57:56,969
Rym: And I think you're going to like it.

882
00:57:57,393 --> 00:57:58,589
Rym: And we're going to do a show on it.

883
00:57:59,271 --> 00:58:03,030
Scott: It's got a. it's got a real big, big drop, right?

884
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:05,089
Scott: The beat the beat drops close to the end.

885
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:06,114
Rym: We'll do it in about.

886
00:58:06,134 --> 00:58:10,567
Rym: we'll do it in about a month in the best way, because it will not take you long to read this.

887
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:12,289
Scott: I didn't take long at all.

888
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,449
Scott: But yeah, we have for once.

889
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:15,430
Scott: You had to wait for us to read.

890
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:16,869
Scott: Now we're going to wait for you to read.

891
00:58:16,971 --> 00:58:17,927
Scott: We'll give you a month or two.

892
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:18,350
Rym: Yeah.

893
00:58:18,471 --> 00:58:20,650
Rym: I feel like I'm going to have this book done before the end of February.

894
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,890
Rym: But we'll still wait like a couple of weeks after that.

895
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:25,770
Rym: Then we'll do the show or we'll record it in advance.

896
00:58:25,932 --> 00:58:27,549
Rym: But we're going to publish it after a month.

897
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,089
Scott: So that's not a bad idea.

898
00:58:29,352 --> 00:58:30,270
Rym: It's not a bad idea at all.

899
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,109
Rym: Get ahead on the book club.

900
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:35,127
Scott: Maybe we could put something like, you know, on the Internet and have like.

901
00:58:35,167 --> 00:58:40,769
Scott: people can come and check the box like when they finish reading it and then we can sort of track when it hits a certain amount.

902
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:41,790
Rym: Yeah.

903
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:42,934
Rym: Well, I want to.

904
00:58:42,975 --> 00:58:53,650
Rym: I think now that we're rekindling the book club with a new book, we know that people will start reading the book around this time so we can talk about the book in the forum and the discord while we're all reading it together.

905
00:58:54,411 --> 00:59:01,048
Rym: That used to happen with all the other book club books and only didn't happen with the Elegangy because because, you know, you know exactly why.

906
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:09,847
Scott: Let us let us know if you plan on reading the city we became and, you know, let us know when you finish reading it.

907
00:59:11,232 --> 00:59:15,030
Rym: So this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

908
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:20,169
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

909
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:25,568
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew dot com for show notes, discussion news and more.

910
00:59:25,831 --> 00:59:28,490
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one but four different shows.

911
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:33,250
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

912

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

913
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:41,090
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

914
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:44,170
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

915
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:50,329
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for the second and final episode of the GeekNights book club on the Tale of Genji.

916
00:59:50,752 --> 00:59:54,910
Rym: We will probably not talk about this book much again in the foreseeable future.

917
00:59:55,150 --> 01:00:00,650
Rym: R. Heidi McNicholallen, Joyce Linkagey, Dred Lillie, Tenebrae and a bunch of people who really don't want me to say their names.

918
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:08,790
Rym: Chris Sadad, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Dex, Finn, Kshaya85, Rebecca Dunn, Reviewmedbull34, Coward, Sam Erickson, Shervin Van Horl.

919
01:00:09,233 --> 01:00:09,769
Rym: Taylor Braun.

920
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:12,590
Rym: The next station is Summerhill, Summerhill Station.

921
01:00:13,111 --> 01:00:15,270
Rym: And several people whose Patreon names I will not say.

922
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,406
Rym: So yeah, next book, N.K.

923
01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:17,809
Rym: Jemisin.

924
01:00:18,435 --> 01:00:19,148
Rym: We're going to read it.

925
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:20,409
Rym: Scott already read it.

926
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:21,708
Rym: I'll have it done pretty soon.

927
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,928
Rym: We'll give you a month.

928
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:27,070
Rym: But yeah, come into the Discord, come into the forum, chat with us about the book.

929
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:30,787
Rym: And for now, I simply leave you with...

930
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:33,908
Scott: Ryuu ga waga teki wo kurau!

931
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,575
Scott: Ryuuji no kei wo kurau!
