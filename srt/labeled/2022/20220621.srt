1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,707
Rym: It's Tuesday, June 21st, 2022.

2
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:09,928
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:13,698
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,147
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:17,379
Rym: Tonight, we're talking about save games.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,238
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,880
Rym: So, uh, that Stanley Cup is a little bit of a rollercoaster right now in this final round.

8
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:31,660
Scott: I thought it was a sure thing for Colorado, but I guess not after yesterday.

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,720
Rym: In game one, I still thought it was a sure thing, but I figured it might be like they're all kind of close games.

10
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:47,720
Rym: Game two, uh, if I were a more impulsive and less wise person, I would have been going down to one of those sports betting places and throwing my fortune at Colorado.

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:01:00,940
Scott: I mean, you know, I even, uh, I wouldn't ever bet on a sports, but I was brave enough to tweet with a broom emoji in it after when only half a broom existed.

12
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,079
Rym: I mean.

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,547
Scott: But I guess goodbye broom.

14
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:04,593
Scott: The broom is gone.

15
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:05,540
Scott: No more broom.

16
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:10,991
Rym: So all I can say is that the Rangers ended at a good point.

17
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:12,475
Rym: They made it to the conference finals.

18
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:13,878
Rym: I was really happy with that.

19
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:14,920
Rym: Like, that was a fun time.

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,179
Rym: Uh, but I am almost glad that the Rangers do not have to be sacrificed against the Avalanche because that second game was...

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,980
Scott: Well, we saw the Rangers did nothing against, you know, they were complete garbage against Colorado during the regular season.

22
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:32,787
Scott: They just got destroyed by them utterly.

23
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:37,820
Scott: And it's like, all right, well, why would you even, you know, we don't need to play them again to know that we can't beat them.

24
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:44,420
Rym: Yeah, but the Lightning, the games were moderately close and there was some back and forth, but the Lightning were clearly the superior team in the end.

25
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:53,100
Rym: And then to see that team lose to the Avalanche 0-7 in a Stanley Cup final game was phenomenal.

26
00:01:53,461 --> 00:02:00,220
Rym: And then to have that almost completely reversed in the next game at home, the best was at the end of the game there was an interview with I think it was Tamko's.

27
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:02,988
Rym: And the question was just like, what happened?

28
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:05,577
Rym: And he was like, we play well in front of our fans.

29
00:02:05,637 --> 00:02:06,420
Rym: Like, what do you want me to say?

30
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:11,094
Scott: It's like, there must be some kind of home ice thing going on in these playoffs.

31
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:12,680
Scott: More than I've ever seen it before.

32
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,745
Rym: Well, Carolina, they're a home team.

33
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:16,288
Rym: They're a home home team anyway.

34
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,795
Rym: Like, even regular season, they tend to lose away and win at home.

35
00:02:18,835 --> 00:02:20,860
Rym: That's just apparently been their thing for a long time.

36
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,561
Scott: I don't know what's up.

37
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:24,967
Scott: I'm just setting up with it right this season with teams, you know, winning at home.

38
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:31,940
Scott: But, you know, you look, it's like, you know, I think, first of all, Colorado has home ice advantage in the series.

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,120
Scott: And second of all, Colorado did better in Tampa than Tampa did in Colorado.

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,940
Rym: I want to say I saw statistics that if you get to a game seven, home ice advantage is basically negligible.

41
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,260
Scott: But I've seen those same statistics.

42
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:49,060
Rym: But it can be really strong before that point.

43
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:50,440
Scott: Anyway.

44
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,411
Rym: Yeah, but I was going to write off that game and just, like, bug you guys to play turtles.

45
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:58,700
Rym: But then, the Lightning kept scoring and I felt like I had to watch it.

46
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:07,000
Scott: You know, if I'm not in it, I don't need to watch unless the Cup is there, right?

47
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,620
Rym: Well, at some point, there'll be games where the Cup could come out.

48
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:13,753
Scott: Yeah, and then...

49
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,820
Rym: There can be no more than one, two, three, four, five more games.

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,868
Scott: I've lost enough time the past few months to hockey.

51
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:25,160
Scott: I know I've got to use my time for other things, reading comics, working on Geeknight's website.

52
00:03:25,462 --> 00:03:26,399
Rym: Never mind all the money.

53
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:26,920
Scott: Biking.

54
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,580
Rym: Though at least I think back because, you know, I've paid you all but the last, like, 500-ish bucks of the hockey money through Apple Pay.

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,898
Scott: Oh, well, you'll have to figure that out.

56
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:41,860
Rym: Yeah, I got one more payment I've got to make and I think I'm past the reset point on the money limit to you.

57
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,739
Rym: I also realize why it blocked me extra because I'd already sent you a bunch of money for the other thing.

58
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:48,057
Rym: That same week.

59
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:49,420
Scott: Uh-huh.

60
00:03:49,760 --> 00:04:02,280
Rym: But anyway, I think back about how much money I spent on the hockey games that me and Emily used and then I think about how much hockey enjoyment I got over the last year-ish and it feels like the right amount of money.

61
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,379
Rym: I got about the enjoyment I expected from that amount of money.

62
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:09,459
Scott: That's because we paid face value and not resale value.

63
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,209
Scott: Yep.

64
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,160
Rym: I mean, I looked at what those tickets cost on Stuff Hub because I thought about a game we didn't have tickets to.

65
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,399
Rym: I wonder if I could just get a couple tickets, maybe even get a slightly better ticket.

66
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,200
Rym: And they weren't just, this was more like what 3080s cost at the height of crypto bullshit prices.

67
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:34,780
Rym: I got props actually to the teams, to the fact that there is a way to buy the tickets at MSRP.

68
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,119
Rym: Somebody gets to buy them at MSRP.

69
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:40,280
Rym: They could just auction them off and make a fortune.

70
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:43,532
Rym: But they don't.

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,840
Rym: So speaking of tickets, speaking of auctions, speaking of things that used to always sell out in the news, PAX West badges are live.

72
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:54,740
Rym: So if you intend to go to PAX West, they're live.

73
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,338
Rym: It is notable that nothing is sold out.

74
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:01,180
Rym: They are not at all sold out because we're still in the middle of a global pandemic.

75
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:06,540
Rym: People have not rushed back to PAX's and other conventions.

76
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:08,560
Scott: There's too many factors here, right?

77
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,120
Scott: There's obviously safety is still a factor, right?

78
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,060
Scott: Somebody died at the last PAX East.

79
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:22,520
Scott: We don't need to have, PAX is not something worth sacrificing literally any human life on the entire face of the earth.

80
00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:28,260
Scott: If it's still going to be a risk of somebody dying, there is no reason to have a PAX.

81
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,340
Scott: It's not worth it, right?

82
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,076
Scott: That is, right?

83
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:31,298
Scott: So that's A.

84
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,480
Rym: The economy is in free fall and a lot of people who might otherwise decide to go to cons anyway, this is just PAX.

85
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,519
Rym: This is across the board.

86
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,520
Rym: This even includes vacations.

87
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:49,260
Rym: Like I got a beach house for us and our friends for later in the summer and there were way more openings than there typically are because people are canceling.

88
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,720
Rym: The economy is going to be a big problem for a lot of people.

89
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,960
Scott: Alright, well that's an issue, right?

90
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,480
Scott: Not to mention, it's not just the economy of people not having money.

91
00:05:58,761 --> 00:05:59,945
Scott: It's the economy of like.

92
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:01,630
Scott: the plane ticket prices are way up.

93
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,560
Rym: Yup, well prices are across the board.

94
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,296
Scott: I don't know what the hotel prices are, but you know.

95
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,140
Rym: But at least, Seattle isn't necessarily cheap.

96
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:20,920
Rym: Some good news, a lot of other cons have dropped various mask and vaccine requirements and at least now, and I trust that PAX won't renege on this like certain other cons did and basically destroyed themselves.

97
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:27,480
Rym: The official statement on the badge buying thing is that they're still going to check full vaccination status.

98
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:29,660
Rym: They're still going to require masks at all times.

99
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:33,298
Rym: They're not changing any of their policies at all.

100
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:42,080
Scott: But yeah, it's also on top of that, it's still a question of like what is the PAX provided content at West going to be like?

101
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:43,639
Scott: How much industry is going to show up?

102
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,179
Scott: What kind of panels are there going to be?

103
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:52,999
Scott: It's like if the con itself is not as big and incredible, it's like it's not worth flying over for.

104
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:57,980
Scott: And especially when the flying over is more costly.

105
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,588
Rym: So it's like going there is harder and more dangerous and you're getting less for what you're paying.

106
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:16,260
Rym: It's like so because, you know, I was at the last two PAXes to do a panel and PAX East, the most recent one, what I could say about it is that it had all the normal things of a PAX.

107
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:22,720
Rym: And it even had mostly, nearly parity with older years, like industry presence in the panels.

108
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:36,940
Rym: But the main theater was a little sparse and the expo hall was more like an expo hall from like 2010, 2011, not like an expo hall from like 2019.

109
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,139
Rym: Way fewer big booths.

110
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,918
Rym: They were still there, but not as many.

111
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,040
Rym: There are plenty of space in that expo hall.

112
00:07:43,602 --> 00:07:45,679
Rym: Not a lot of lines to do the stuff.

113
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:47,419
Rym: It was just generally sparse.

114
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:54,560
Rym: So if you're an expo hall only person, you'll get like 80% of a typical PAX, maybe 70%.

115
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,259
Scott: I mean, in terms of all, you know, I mean, if you look at what happened with E3, it's like, you know, just this past week or two, right?

116
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:07,239
Scott: All these other game companies were just sort of doing, you know, Internet announcement type event things, right?

117
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:10,397
Scott: Rather than, you know, E3 or whatever.

118
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:14,018
Rym: But worse, you know, what do I want to do?

119
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:14,420
Rym: tabletop?

120
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,020
Rym: And it is difficult.

121
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:24,200
Rym: It's difficult to even have a conversation in the tabletop area, as I tried to do in normal times before COVID.

122
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:28,920
Rym: But if everyone's wearing masks in that rumbling tabletop hall.

123
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,760
Scott: Well, in West, it's not so rumbling.

124
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,839
Rym: West is much better.

125
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:36,380
Rym: But at East, in that rumbling tabletop hall, nobody could hear what anyone was saying.

126
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:44,920
Rym: And it was notable how sparse the tabletop area was and how much open space there was if you were going to play tabletop games.

127
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:54,060
Scott: And I think, you know, the final thing is that, like, if I go to a convention and I'm going to spend, you know, the, you know, we used to go to when we went to anime Boston.

128
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,320
Scott: It's like, that's what I consider what it would be like if I was like, you know, we went to anime Boston back in the day.

129
00:09:01,423 --> 00:09:07,180
Scott: We would do a lot of panels and we would attend a few panels and concerts, right?

130
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:09,979
Rym: But a few, like the high, like the top tier.

131
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:10,921
Scott: Right.

132
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:17,100
Scott: But there was very few people there who, for, you know, some of those later ones, right?

133
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:21,120
Scott: We had very few acquaintances there who were enjoying the con with us.

134
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,860
Scott: It was just us, right, walking around, looking around.

135
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:28,980
Scott: And we even with all that stuff, we were doing a pile of panels and going to stuff, right?

136
00:09:29,262 --> 00:09:32,000
Scott: We ran out of things to do, go to the deals room artist's alley.

137
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,000
Scott: And then we were just like, well, all right.

138
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:44,640
Scott: So if I go to a PAX and I don't and all of my friends don't go to play tabletop games to fill in all those hours, it's like, I'm going to do a panel.

139
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:47,580
Scott: I'm going to go to panels, even if I enforce.

140
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,460
Rym: Emily and I saw everything at PAX East in about an hour and a half.

141
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:53,961
Scott: Right.

142
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,080
Scott: Even if I enforced to eat up additional hours.

143
00:09:58,162 --> 00:09:58,383
Scott: Right.

144
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:01,880
Scott: And went to some panels that were like on my maybe list.

145
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:11,840
Scott: It's like they would end up being a lot of time where I'm just like sitting around waiting because I don't have a bunch of friends also there to play a constant flood of tabletop games.

146
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,560
Rym: At a normal PAX pick any hour of the cons open.

147
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,940
Rym: If I go to tabletop, I will find at least one person I know who will want to play a tabletop game right then and there.

148
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,060
Scott: So if the crew is not there, it's like, well, it's like there's a lot of I spent a lot of effort.

149
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:31,780
Scott: Money, time traveling to go to a thing to spend a lot of time sitting there.

150
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:33,680
Scott: It's like that's not happening.

151
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,281
Scott: Yeah.

152
00:10:34,362 --> 00:10:35,572
Scott: So and yeah.

153
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,820
Rym: So I will very likely be there doing a couple of panels because I have some business reasons to be out there anyway.

154
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,900
Rym: Emily will likely also be on at least one panel or helping coordinate one TBD on all that.

155
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,667
Rym: But we'll be out there.

156
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:52,140
Rym: But we're not going to stick around to like hang out or play games.

157
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,240
Rym: So if you're there, maybe we can say hi, but we're pretty much going to be doing business.

158
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:57,336
Rym: And then GTFO.

159
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:04,259
Scott: And I mean, I imagine that's what, you know, like industry people do.

160
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:04,782
Scott: Right.

161
00:11:04,903 --> 00:11:07,980
Scott: It's like, you know, they probably have a booth, but then they probably.

162
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,822
Scott: Here's the thing.

163
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:13,780
Rym: I've been to a lot of conventions, gaming cons, but also just a lot of work cons where that is what I do.

164
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,993
Rym: And pre covid, that was still really fun.

165
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,560
Rym: Even I didn't have my people in town.

166
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,200
Rym: I couldn't play tabletop games because grab a few people who are around or some pseudo strangers who seem cool.

167
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:25,546
Rym: Go out to dinner with them.

168
00:11:25,787 --> 00:11:26,952
Rym: Hang out in a bar with them.

169
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,660
Rym: Go somewhere else and do a thing.

170
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,225
Rym: There's something in the city to do.

171
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:30,847
Rym: Walk around.

172
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:33,940
Rym: But with covid, I'm not doing indoor dining without a mask.

173
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,702
Rym: There's like B.A.

174
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:35,204
Rym: for B.A.

175
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:38,899
Rym: five variants that seem to like skip all immunity right now.

176
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,269
Scott: I mean, I stopped paying attention.

177
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:43,239
Scott: I just look at the number and I'm like, still too big.

178
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,103
Scott: That's all.

179
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:45,026
Scott: That's all I do.

180
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:55,500
Rym: So you don't even get the fun of like being there as an industry person, because when I travel for work, a lot of the fun I have is lavish dinners on the company dime.

181
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:59,219
Rym: And not really doing that in a covid era like outdoors.

182
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:07,600
Scott: I don't know how true this is, but I've heard whispers that the booth prices are not necessarily dramatically lowered despite lower attendance.

183
00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:10,675
Rym: Well, the Pax four day badge is two hundred and thirty five dollars.

184
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:11,620
Scott: Right.

185
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,081
Scott: It's like.

186
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:18,900
Scott: it's like if there's less people at the con and the con is less happening, it's like you have to lower the expo booth price.

187
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,780
Scott: It's like you can't keep it high, you know, even though there's inflation or whatever.

188
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,506
Scott: And that means prices go up.

189
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:28,640
Scott: It's like but the value of that good specifically is down.

190
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,367
Rym: I still don't think Pax is even about.

191
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:35,080
Scott: even if the value of money is less, the value of the good is also less.

192
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:38,660
Rym: I think cons like this in general, we'll see what happens next year.

193
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,540
Rym: But until we're at a point where they generally go on mass and people are as an edge.

194
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:45,820
Scott: Right.

195
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,883
Scott: And it's right to do so.

196
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:47,244
Rym: Yep.

197
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:53,920
Rym: And as an aggregate, people are comfortable with that and accept that cons are not going to be back to normal.

198
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,120
Rym: And I don't think twenty twenty three, they're going to be back to normal either, to be honest.

199
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:04,940
Scott: If the booth price went down, though, then I could consider getting a tiny booth at a con where all my friends were not there.

200
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,372
Scott: Because I would have this booth to enjoy the con with.

201
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:08,980
Rym: Yeah, I had a good time.

202
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,520
Rym: That one that had that one Otakon where we had an artist alley table for GeekNights.

203
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,880
Scott: I think we you know, we would do a much better job if we had a booth now.

204
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,362
Scott: Oh, yeah.

205
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:18,713
Rym: We were we were dumb idiot babies back then.

206
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:20,120
Rym: We had no idea what we were doing.

207
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:27,280
Rym: Though we made a shit ton of money selling those T-shirts anyway.

208
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:34,120
Rym: Anyway, relative to how much money I had at the time, that was a pretty good stack of cash.

209
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:40,600
Rym: Anyway, also the profit margin on those are old old night T-shirts because I got them screen printed direct.

210
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,290
Rym: I paid like a dollar eighty per shirt.

211
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,040
Rym: We were selling it for twenty bucks and I sold a couple hundred of them.

212
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:50,032
Rym: That was a good amount of money anyway.

213
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:51,520
Scott: So other news.

214
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,593
Scott: Street Fighter six is announced.

215
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:56,000
Scott: It's coming at some point.

216
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:58,508
Scott: And there's a lot of stuff going on with it.

217
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:01,960
Scott: You know, they're not afraid to make big changes and whatnot.

218
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,659
Scott: But there's one part of the Street Fighter six news I want to focus on.

219
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:10,640
Scott: And that is that they've added what's basically easy baby mode.

220
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:11,242
Scott: Right.

221
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:15,760
Scott: And what this means, if you never played Street Fighter is the controls of Street Fighter.

222
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:17,427
Scott: You got to stick right.

223
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:20,540
Scott: You know, forward, back, crouch, jump, et cetera.

224
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:20,941
Scott: Right.

225
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:22,927
Scott: And then you got six buttons.

226
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:23,590
Scott: Right.

227
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,760
Scott: Light, medium, heavy in both punch and kick.

228
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:30,092
Scott: So six buttons, light, light punch, like kick, et cetera.

229
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:32,220
Scott: The new control scheme.

230
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,647
Scott: Now, this is not to be right.

231
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:35,650
Scott: So we're clear.

232
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:38,960
Scott: You can still use the old control scheme.

233
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:52,980
Scott: I'm one hundred percent confident that in any competitive scene and in any professional player and any seriously competitive player, they will still be using the original control scheme and it will still work as it always did.

234
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:55,306
Scott: And they might not even let you use the easy one.

235
00:14:55,346 --> 00:15:00,480
Rym: It's probably, probably definitely won't based on what I've learned about it so far.

236
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:09,809
Rym: I suspect even if tournaments did, if you are not great at Street Fighter and you try to use the modern control type, you will still get crushed fighting with class.

237
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,000
Scott: I assume the modern control type.

238
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:20,760
Scott: It basically, even if you use it, it seems just worse than using the correct or traditional control map.

239
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:33,718
Rym: But easier and more accessible for the player and people like me who are preternaturally terrible at all fighting games, except Bushido Blade two and Soul Calibur two, but even Soul Calibur only if I'm playing Voldo.

240
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:43,900
Scott: Anyway, so the new control scheme, the modern control type, which is basically designed for people who suck ass at fighting games.

241
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:44,700
Scott: Right.

242
00:15:45,062 --> 00:15:48,640
Scott: But want to be able to play and actually do some special moves.

243
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:53,136
Scott: What they've done is most game pads, which is what people are going to be using.

244
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:54,200
Scott: They don't have fight sticks, right?

245
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,112
Scott: Have four buttons on the front.

246
00:15:56,818 --> 00:15:57,000
Scott: Right.

247
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:08,820
Scott: So it's always been annoying as far back as Street Fighter two turbo for SNES to try to play with regular Street Fighter because you had to map like two of the attacks to the LNR buttons or some shit.

248
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,300
Scott: And like Sega Genesis and Saturn had the six button controllers, but not anything after that.

249
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,911
Scott: PlayStation, nothing, right?

250
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:17,040
Scott: GameCube, forget about it.

251
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,176
Scott: So what they've done is they said, all right, you only got four buttons instead of six.

252
00:16:21,237 --> 00:16:21,919
Scott: What are we going to do?

253
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:27,280
Scott: Well, we'll take three of the buttons and we'll make one of them light, one of the medium and one of them heavy.

254
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,960
Rym: Notice Scott did not say punch or kick.

255
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,060
Scott: Right.

256
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:34,900
Scott: You won't know when you push the button if it's going to be a punch or a kick.

257
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,908
Scott: You have no control over that whatsoever.

258
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:43,018
Scott: It'll be dependent on your character, what they're doing, how close to the enemy they are, et cetera, et cetera.

259
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:48,040
Scott: But you basically push the heavy attack button and they might do heavy punch.

260
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,505
Scott: They might do heavy kick.

261
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:50,450
Scott: You don't know.

262
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:51,033
Scott: Right.

263
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:52,480
Scott: And how much does it matter?

264
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:55,000
Scott: Well, if you're a professional, that's unusable.

265
00:16:55,621 --> 00:17:04,520
Scott: But if it's just you and your friends who suck at fighting games and you both suck and you're both using that mode, that's actually going to make it a much more enjoyable game.

266
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:04,902
Scott: Right.

267
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:07,354
Scott: And then the final button is a fourth button.

268
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,540
Scott: What do they do with that button?

269
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:16,240
Scott: Well, what they've done is they've turned it into much like the B button in Smash Brothers where it's the special attack button.

270
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:26,739
Scott: So you press the B button and depending on where the stick is pointing, you know, and things of that nature, all your different special moves will come out.

271
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:26,940
Scott: Right.

272
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:33,420
Scott: It's like if it's Ryu, I'm just going to guess here and say that, like, you know, special forward would do a Haruken.

273
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,699
Scott: Special up would do a Shoryuken.

274
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,673
Scott: Special down or special back would do the Hurricane kick.

275
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:39,919
Scott: Something like that.

276
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:40,240
Scott: Right.

277
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,560
Scott: Something, you know, that's my guess of what it would be like with this special mode.

278
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:51,680
Scott: Now that that in a professional setting is just cheating and should not be allowed.

279
00:17:52,341 --> 00:18:00,640
Scott: But for someone like me, where half the time I try to do Haruken and it doesn't come out, that makes the game playable.

280
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:01,722
Scott: Basically.

281
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:02,085
Scott: Right.

282
00:18:02,508 --> 00:18:06,179
Rym: So it's, you know, Haruken is just hit the special button.

283
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,118
Scott: Oh, it's just plain B.

284
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,771
Rym: Shoryuken is stick to the right.

285
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:12,200
Rym: High blade kick is stick down.

286
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,420
Rym: It's that that's what's going on here.

287
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:14,943
Rym: I was close.

288
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:15,586
Scott: I was close.

289
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:16,310
Scott: Yeah.

290
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,080
Scott: Anyway, but you get the idea.

291
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:19,920
Rym: So I should play this and just be a flowchart.

292
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,931
Scott: So, I mean, I think that, yeah, I think what this, you know, is, is like.

293
00:18:23,951 --> 00:18:32,440
Scott: we're often, you know, as people who played FPS, we're better at them than we are fighting games by a large, large margin, even though we're not even that good at FPS.

294
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:34,725
Scott: Compared to pros.

295
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:35,167
Scott: Right.

296
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:38,379
Scott: Is that, you know, we're always like, oh, you got to use keyboard and mouse.

297
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:38,660
Scott: Right.

298
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,163
Scott: It's like this.

299
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:40,169
Scott: And it's like, it's true.

300
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,900
Scott: Keyboard and mouse is superior.

301
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,058
Scott: Someone is not using keyboard and mouse will just lose to you.

302
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,364
Scott: It's right.

303
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:47,188
Scott: It's just better.

304
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:49,460
Scott: But it is also less accessible.

305
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:53,292
Scott: It is easier to play an FPS with a gamepad and auto aim.

306
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:55,780
Scott: It's just you won't be as good.

307
00:18:56,941 --> 00:19:02,720
Rym: Case in point, that's how most people play Fortnite, but they don't match those people with people who have a mouse and keyboard.

308
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:03,842
Scott: Right.

309
00:19:03,862 --> 00:19:14,509
Scott: So, you know, while I would never, you know, argue that like, oh, the gamepad way is better or the right way or anything like that, I've also never going to say that it shouldn't exist.

310
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:24,360
Scott: Like, it's like, let the other people who are not as good, not mouse and keyboard people, not don't have PCs or whatever, let them have access to these games.

311
00:19:24,882 --> 00:19:28,479
Scott: Maybe that's how they find out that they enjoy them so much and then will upgrade.

312
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:32,720
Scott: Then they enter the competitive scene or if they don't enter the competitive scene.

313
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,920
Scott: OK, well, they're going to be playing perfectly happily in their noncompetitive scene with other people just like themselves.

314
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,109
Scott: OK, go right ahead.

315
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:43,219
Scott: You're not bothering anybody doing that.

316
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:43,681
Scott: Right.

317
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:47,758
Scott: So for that to be added to Street Fighter is now taking a game.

318
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:52,309
Scott: You know, even if you know what, you know, it's like.

319
00:19:52,589 --> 00:20:02,600
Scott: even if almost nobody who plays with modern control scheme ever upgrades to regular, you know, how many people only play mini golf and never actually play serious golf.

320
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:03,562
Scott: Yeah.

321
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:13,240
Scott: It's like you're still going to allow a whole generation of people now to enjoy Street Fighter, who might not have ever played a Street Fighter, you know, alternatively.

322
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:20,120
Scott: Enjoy all the people who are Street Fighter pros who know that six buttons is the one true way.

323
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,862
Scott: And they're right.

324
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:25,940
Scott: Are going to continue to play with six buttons and you can just ignore all the four button people.

325
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,923
Scott: So what do they give a shit?

326
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:31,780
Rym: And this will call this will be a nice stepping stone, because I think what this will do a big problem in fighting.

327
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:39,167
Scott: I think it might hurt as a stepping stone, because like if you get used to four button and really enjoy the game and then try to go to six, you basically starting from nothing.

328
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,960
Rym: They actually talk about that.

329
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:50,209
Rym: They have designed it to be a stepping stone in that some of the like, if you do a grab and a few other things, if you input real controls, they will also work.

330
00:20:50,691 --> 00:20:51,594
Rym: And they've designed it.

331
00:20:51,614 --> 00:20:53,660
Scott: Oh, so you can still do a hadook in the old way.

332
00:20:54,361 --> 00:20:56,286
Rym: I'm not 100 percent sure on the details here.

333
00:20:56,346 --> 00:21:01,400
Rym: I'm reading into like a paragraph worth of an interview with someone who works there.

334
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,264
Rym: But they were talking about it.

335
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:09,820
Rym: And basically they're hoping that it will be a stepping stone to get people to understand the basic interplay of the game.

336
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:17,920
Rym: Kind of like how you don't teach someone how to play, say, hearts by immediately getting into the passing strategy.

337
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,980
Rym: You teach them, avoid the hearts, like the basic strategies of the game, the basic give and take of the game.

338
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:33,360
Rym: So this will teach people and let them experience the real give and take of the game before they have to back up and learn all this technical nonsense.

339
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:36,263
Rym: We'll see how it goes.

340
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:37,747
Rym: I think it's a noble experiment.

341
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:42,039
Scott: I hope it succeeds because I can't say that I'll buy it or I'll play it.

342
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,309
Scott: Just because, you know, I have too many things going on in life already.

343
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:46,453
Scott: I'm trying to cut things out.

344
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:48,840
Scott: But it is, you know, interesting.

345
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:56,660
Scott: I would definitely love to like, you know, if I was in a place that had the game set up, I would love to try it with the old control scheme and see what's what.

346
00:21:57,061 --> 00:22:01,499
Rym: You know, if only we could go to PAX, that's the kind of thing I would go poke at.

347
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,867
Scott: Yeah, for sure.

348
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,760
Scott: At the Capcom booth.

349
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,884
Rym: Yeah.

350
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:08,540
Rym: So in some other news, you can read this article if you want to know more about what happened.

351
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,593
Rym: But basically, so I own a modest amount of Hasbro stock.

352
00:22:13,713 --> 00:22:16,180
Rym: Full disclosure, that's part of my direct investment portfolio.

353
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:17,923
Rym: This is not investment advice.

354
00:22:17,944 --> 00:22:24,840
Rym: I'm not saying you should buy it, but that is what I have bought is a significant percentage of my non-retirement investing.

355
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,620
Rym: And as a result, I get to vote in the shareholder meetings and I don't have that many shares.

356
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:44,720
Rym: But an election happened in the board that was controversial and tricky and a big deal enough to where I didn't just get the normal emails and texts and people calling me trying to get my proxy vote, like which card to vote on.

357
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,042
Rym: Because I get that all the time.

358
00:22:46,102 --> 00:22:46,843
Rym: Most people who buy.

359
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:59,320
Rym: if you have like one share of something on like TD or something, very likely you'll get a low level amount of harassment to make sure you vote with the board or whatever, whenever there's a shareholder election, because that's low hanging fruit.

360
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:07,220
Rym: But there's an activist investor, Alta Fox, which is basically a capital management.

361
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,328
Scott: This is public information.

362
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:09,280
Scott: You can just read articles about this.

363
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,770
Rym: But they're basically like this capital management company.

364
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:16,540
Rym: They're similar to the kind of company that like gutted Toys R Us.

365
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,731
Rym: They're, in my personal opinion, they as a company are bad news.

366
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:21,680
Scott: Isn't that private equity, the Toys R Us game?

367
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,243
Scott: Yeah.

368
00:23:22,323 --> 00:23:25,499
Rym: I don't want to get into all the technical details of how this all works, but here's what they did.

369
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,057
Rym: They bought a huge stake in Hasbro, like 2.5% of all the outstanding stock.

370
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,079
Scott: They bought it.

371
00:23:33,882 --> 00:23:40,178
Rym: And then they started pressuring the board to do a bunch of bullshit, which mostly came down to spin.

372
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,264
Scott: They only have 2.5%.

373
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:42,706
Scott: That's 97.5%.

374
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:43,770
Scott: That's against them.

375
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,720
Rym: Because the way this works is that that stake will vote the way they want.

376
00:23:50,161 --> 00:24:02,280
Rym: And then they go after all the other shareholders to try to convince those shareholders that if they help them take over the company, they'll make the stock price grow, like they'll make the company better and make us more money.

377
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:14,100
Rym: And they basically proposed this weird nonsense about taking Wizards of the Coast, splitting it off into its own company, and radically restructuring how Hasbro works.

378
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,006
Scott: I have noticed a lot of companies splitting things off lately, right?

379
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:25,920
Scott: You had AT&T split off WB, and just like today or the other day, Kellogg's split off their cereal from everything else that Kellogg's owns.

380
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:33,220
Scott: There must be something that's happening that's causing these split offs to happen for some reason.

381
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,659
Rym: So in my personal experience, not speaking to any particular split up, I'm going to be very clear about that.

382
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:51,820
Rym: Usually what's going on is in a tight economy, the split lines will be along, some of the bits will be likely very profitable, and some of the bits are very risky.

383
00:24:52,501 --> 00:25:06,060
Rym: And the smart people or the well-connected people are all going to stick with the bits that are likely to make money, and it's a way to basically quietly get rid of the stuff that isn't that profitable or that you're a little worried about.

384
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,349
Rym: Also get rid of your low performing employees at the same time without actually firing them.

385
00:25:12,371 --> 00:25:17,060
Rym: That kind of conversation is not uncommon, is what I'm going to say.

386
00:25:18,581 --> 00:25:20,346
Rym: But there are a lot of other reasons this could happen.

387
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:26,160
Rym: You might want to split one off because you want to sell it because you think the market will give you more money than it's worth.

388
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,755
Rym: Or you want that money to do something else with one of your other divisions.

389
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:30,780
Rym: There's a lot of ways this could go.

390
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,920
Rym: But long story short, they failed, obviously, this company, they did not succeed.

391
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:45,920
Rym: But they were trying to take advantage of some turmoil in the board of directors of Hasbro around someone dying, someone leaving, the stock not growing that much.

392
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:50,448
Rym: And Hasbro's board was like, look, we know toys, we know what we're doing.

393
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:51,851
Rym: Yeah, the stock hasn't grown.

394
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:53,594
Rym: Dipshits, we pay dividends.

395
00:25:54,215 --> 00:25:55,077
Rym: We pay dividends.

396
00:25:55,117 --> 00:25:55,918
Rym: They're good dividends.

397
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:56,900
Rym: God damn it.

398
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,760
Rym: I'm obviously paraphrasing and putting words in their mouths, but that's basically what they said.

399
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:09,660
Rym: And they issued a statement that was like, look, kind of like in The Simpsons when you could vote for Homer to be the trash commissioner or the guy who knew what he was doing.

400
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:16,500
Rym: They were like, look, if you want Hasbro to keep doing what it's been doing and not fuck up, vote for the existing board.

401
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,906
Rym: But if you want these jackasses to ruin everything, by all means.

402
00:26:20,928 --> 00:26:26,920
Rym: And these jackasses went so far, they were really trying to make this happen.

403
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,305
Rym: They were calling my relatives.

404
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:34,293
Rym: They called Emily's mom on her landline.

405
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:35,675
Rym: They called my father.

406
00:26:36,076 --> 00:26:38,360
Rym: They tried to call my dead grandfather.

407
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:44,071
Rym: They were going after people associated with me in any way because I had not yet voted.

408
00:26:45,975 --> 00:26:48,720
Rym: So I figured out which side was doing this.

409
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:50,687
Rym: And it was the dipshit Alta Fox people.

410
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:53,839
Rym: So I pointedly voted against them, irrespective of everything else.

411
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:57,304
Scott: That's one of those rare cases.

412
00:26:57,445 --> 00:27:02,780
Scott: Usually when I have a vote, it's like, you know, for a stock thing, I have so few shares, it doesn't mean anything.

413
00:27:03,302 --> 00:27:08,500
Scott: But I always vote against usually what the board wants because the board is usually old white capitalist dudes.

414
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:13,960
Rym: Usually I vote against a lot of the board things because I want younger people to be in charge of these companies.

415
00:27:15,622 --> 00:27:19,378
Scott: But it's a rare instance, I guess, where it's like, OK, there is something worse than...

416
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,925
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

417
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:37,420
Rym: So I fell in love with this channel and it's basically this guy whose job is to go around, I think Berlin.

418
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,959
Rym: So he's in Germany, unclogging stormwater gullies and storm drains and like...

419
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,000
Scott: Wasn't there, didn't we do a thing of the day on a guy like this already?

420
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,483
Rym: That guy is different.

421
00:27:48,503 --> 00:27:49,607
Rym: That guy was like culverts.

422
00:27:50,108 --> 00:27:51,613
Rym: And it seems like he's more of a hobbyist.

423
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:53,419
Rym: Like some of them, he just finds one and does it.

424
00:27:54,283 --> 00:27:55,350
Rym: Because he wants to see it happen.

425
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:55,572
Scott: Right.

426
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:55,773
Scott: Yeah.

427
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:56,800
Scott: He's just doing it on his own.

428
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,120
Rym: Yeah.

429
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,186
Rym: This is a very different type of video.

430
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:00,890
Rym: This video is a half hour long.

431
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:04,760
Rym: This is start to finish what it looks like.

432
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:17,580
Rym: One, if you are doing labor in a reasonable, relatively socialist country that respects the dignity of your labor and pays people a reasonable wage to do very critical work that is usually ignored by tech people.

433
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:22,427
Rym: And two, someone who clearly very much cares about his job.

434
00:28:23,188 --> 00:28:32,220
Rym: And over this half hour, you see exactly what it takes to unclog a stormwater gully that has gotten some roots in it.

435
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,084
Rym: And you see the entire process in real time.

436
00:28:35,685 --> 00:28:37,428
Rym: And it is fascinating.

437
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:45,140
Rym: Also, Berlin's civic infrastructure is so nice compared to anything I have ever seen in America that I weep.

438
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,139
Scott: I mean, yeah.

439
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:54,680
Rym: And it is so satisfying when he finally gets those roots out of there and you see the water flowing through the gully again.

440
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,120
Scott: I mean, I think that's the real key with these videos is the satisfying part, right?

441
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:07,616
Rym: But the process on this one is good, too, because the satisfying part, it is 27 minutes of just edging and waiting for it.

442
00:29:07,656 --> 00:29:08,878
Rym: And at the very end, you get it.

443
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,273
Rym: But at several points as you're watching, you might think like I did, why doesn't he just do X?

444
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:16,854
Rym: You're watching him.

445
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:18,437
Rym: You're like, it seems like he's moving really slow.

446
00:29:18,477 --> 00:29:20,140
Rym: Just just fucking go for it.

447
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:25,960
Rym: But then a little while later, he'll make it get to the next step of the process, like he'll remove something.

448
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:33,560
Rym: And then you'll see, oh, if I had tried to unblock this, I would have just broken a bunch of shit because I didn't know what I was doing.

449
00:29:34,082 --> 00:29:36,518
Rym: There is a lot of skill and knowledge that's required for this.

450
00:29:37,702 --> 00:29:37,864
Scott: Yeah.

451
00:29:37,884 --> 00:29:39,579
Rym: So what do you got?

452
00:29:42,102 --> 00:29:47,680
Scott: So this dude, he, you know, pay phones, I think they removed the last public pay phones in Manhattan.

453
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,342
Rym: Oh, they did.

454
00:29:48,382 --> 00:29:49,226
Rym: There's the whole thing about it.

455
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:49,888
Rym: You could you could go.

456
00:29:49,908 --> 00:29:52,800
Rym: There was a bunch of people watching the ceremony when they pulled it away.

457
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,284
Scott: Anyway, at least the last working ones.

458
00:29:55,324 --> 00:29:57,008
Scott: I've seen some non-working ones about.

459
00:29:57,149 --> 00:29:57,890
Scott: I know where they are.

460
00:29:57,951 --> 00:30:01,980
Scott: There's some that like have no handles and don't work, obviously, but I've seen them anyway.

461
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,900
Scott: So this dude got a pay phone.

462
00:30:05,301 --> 00:30:06,327
Scott: You know, it's not hard to get one.

463
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,774
Scott: You go on eBay or whatever and buy one.

464
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:08,940
Scott: There's plenty of them.

465
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,321
Scott: Right.

466
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,006
Scott: You could buy all kinds of old shit like that.

467
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:15,220
Scott: And he wanted to hook it up in his house for for fun.

468
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,840
Scott: Obviously, he wasn't going to hook it up to the actual landline and fucking call people.

469
00:30:21,441 --> 00:30:23,891
Scott: It's like, why would you do that?

470
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:24,794
Scott: That makes no sense.

471
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:26,240
Scott: And also, no one knows that number.

472
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:28,410
Scott: And also, what if someone does know that number?

473
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,400
Scott: Some of these pay phones ring you real loud in your house.

474
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,022
Scott: You don't want that.

475
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:38,520
Scott: What he did is he got a device that seems obvious in retrospect, but I never really thought of it before.

476
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:43,611
Scott: But what it is, it's basically just a little box with two, you know,

477
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:43,671
Scott: R.J.,

478
00:30:44,533 --> 00:30:47,800
Scott: whatever connectors are 11, if I recall correctly.

479
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,207
Scott: Yeah, we just you just plug two phones into it.

480
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:52,711
Scott: And guess what?

481
00:30:52,832 --> 00:30:56,120
Scott: You've now got yourself a two telephone phone system.

482
00:30:56,702 --> 00:31:02,640
Scott: You pick up one phone and it calls the other phone and you pick up the other phone and it calls the other phone.

483
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,340
Scott: So you could just have two phones in your house that call each other.

484
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:06,700
Scott: Yeah.

485
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:12,560
Scott: And so he put the pay phone on the wall in like the kitchen or wherever is some kind of living area.

486
00:31:13,141 --> 00:31:17,237
Scott: And the other end, he got the cool, clear, plastic, you know, 90s phone.

487
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,107
Rym: That phone was so great.

488
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:20,680
Rym: Like everyone I knew had that phone.

489
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,860
Scott: Yeah, he just bought one of those on eBay for a few bucks and put it in his daughter's room.

490
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:32,140
Scott: So now a few times a day, the daughter, you know, she's like, you know, a child picks up the phone and it rings.

491
00:31:33,262 --> 00:31:36,916
Scott: And, you know, dad can get up from work and pick up the phone and talk to his offspring.

492
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:46,900
Rym: It's cool because there was in the 70s, late 60s through mid 70s, the thing that was really popular in American house design was intercom systems.

493
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,920
Rym: There would be intercoms in like every major room of the house.

494
00:31:50,262 --> 00:31:53,340
Rym: And you could just like call other parts of the house.

495
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:59,020
Rym: And that stopped being a thing because in retrospect, it was really silly unless you had a really big house.

496
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,203
Scott: I mean, I have it.

497
00:32:00,363 --> 00:32:06,200
Scott: I could just, it's only useful for talking to the door person and the person who someone's trying to get in the front door.

498
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:06,742
Rym: I have it too.

499
00:32:06,822 --> 00:32:07,745
Rym: But you know what it is now?

500
00:32:07,765 --> 00:32:11,800
Rym: I can just message Emily on Discord on her phone that she's got with her.

501
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,900
Rym: Like I have my phone with me no matter what.

502
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,679
Scott: This person's child, this person's child is not phone age, but also just the novelty of this.

503
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:27,760
Rym: Also, I got to say scrolling through this thing of the day, that thing looks so slick on his wall.

504
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,100
Scott: They installed it properly.

505
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:30,581
Scott: Yeah.

506
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,178
Rym: I kind of want one now.

507
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:33,721
Scott: Yeah.

508
00:32:33,741 --> 00:32:42,920
Scott: I've seen a lot of people install them, for example, like in a basement that has, you know, a pool table and a payphone and a gumball machine.

509
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:43,902
Scott: Right.

510
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:52,100
Scott: You know, and all those sorts of things going on together to make like a cool, you know, recreational room kind of deal, aesthetic going on.

511
00:32:52,400 --> 00:33:01,520
Rym: So like if I was rich enough to have an apartment big enough to have an arcade in it, like a small aesthetic arcade, I would definitely have a payphone on the wall.

512
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,050
Scott: A jukebox would go in there.

513
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,652
Scott: Right.

514
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:06,359
Scott: You know, all that kind of stuff.

515
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:07,358
Rym: It's cool, Biz.

516
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:12,140
Rym: In the matter of a moment, the Geek Times Book Club book is Nine Fox Gambit.

517
00:33:12,462 --> 00:33:15,900
Rym: I am more than halfway through the second book in that series.

518
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:19,773
Rym: And all I got to say is, you know how many times you read the first book?

519
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:21,880
Rym: and I give a little warning about the second book?

520
00:33:22,343 --> 00:33:24,640
Rym: I really like the second book so far.

521
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:26,820
Rym: Like it just keeps going.

522
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,602
Rym: It picks up.

523
00:33:28,566 --> 00:33:31,759
Rym: It picks up seconds after the end of the first book.

524
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:34,220
Scott: I imagine that's what was going to happen.

525
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,520
Rym: But not too far into it, you will encounter first the incest twins.

526
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:40,743
Scott: Uh oh.

527
00:33:40,763 --> 00:33:41,609
Scott: That's not good.

528
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:47,995
Rym: That is extremely, extremely direct.

529
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,320
Rym: It is unambiguous.

530
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,839
Rym: It is just like, by the way, reader, I present this to you.

531
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:57,212
Rym: These are two very major characters.

532
00:33:57,232 --> 00:33:58,499
Rym: You will not get away from them.

533
00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:00,300
Rym: And this is going to be a thing.

534
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,260
Scott: And they're twins and they fuck each other?

535
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:03,699
Rym: Uh, yeah.

536
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,616
Scott: There's biological twins for the same parents?

537
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,699
Rym: One of them is a hexarch.

538
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:15,719
Rym: And one of them is basically the brother who they grew up together as a child together.

539
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:20,540
Rym: And he has gotten plastic surgery to be identical to the hexarch and acts as his body double.

540
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,851
Rym: But also, they fucking... And everybody knows it.

541
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:25,619
Rym: Everybody's cool with it.

542
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,483
Scott: Oh wait.

543
00:34:26,844 --> 00:34:28,755
Scott: But they're not actually twins.

544
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,560
Scott: They're just brothers.

545
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,239
Scott: They're biological brothers.

546
00:34:31,981 --> 00:34:36,520
Scott: Okay, so it's still incest, but they're not biological identical twins.

547
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,040
Scott: No.

548
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:38,629
Scott: Okay.

549
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,420
Scott: It's still bad though.

550
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:42,938
Rym: It's not the Prince of Nothing situation, but it's there.

551
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:51,400
Rym: And two, if you thought the violence that is depicted in the first book was squeaky, strap in in the second book.

552
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,918
Rym: Because they start going after the heffen.

553
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:59,216
Rym: And as much as you might think from the first book that the heffen, "Alright, they're against the hexarchs, so how bad could they

554
00:34:59,256 --> 00:34:59,337
Rym: be?".

555
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:00,847
Rym: They are not great.

556
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:02,637
Rym: And I'll leave it at that.

557
00:35:02,718 --> 00:35:03,120
Rym: They are.

558
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,680
Scott: I thought they were going to be the good democratic people.

559
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:09,420
Rym: No, the democratic people are just the heretics on that one fortress.

560
00:35:09,802 --> 00:35:11,340
Rym: The heffen have their own motives.

561
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,654
Rym: The hexarchs are like, "What the fuck is wrong with the heffens?

562
00:35:14,694 --> 00:35:14,915
Rym: God

563
00:35:14,955 --> 00:35:15,237
Rym: damn.".

564
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,224
Rym: Even the cow.

565
00:35:16,245 --> 00:35:16,973
Scott: The cow.

566
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,396
Scott: So basically the hexarch...

567
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,040
Rym: I'm going to spiritually quote Judeo and also one of the actual hexarchs.

568
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:27,340
Rym: What the fuck is wrong with the heffen?

569
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:34,257
Scott: So the hexarchs are the Marquis de Cat, but the heffen are... They're not the green forest folk.

570
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,159
Rym: No, they're more like the birds.

571
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,352
Scott: The birds?

572
00:35:38,373 --> 00:35:38,680
Scott: Oh, damn.

573
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,540
Rym: Actually, no, they're more like the lizards, I gotta say.

574
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:41,179
Rym: The lizard folk?

575
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:41,588
Rym: Yeah.

576
00:35:43,581 --> 00:35:48,560
Rym: Their technology is gross and terrifying, but oddly compelling.

577
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,258
Scott: But otherwise, the night fox... What's their calendar look like?

578
00:35:54,465 --> 00:35:56,800
Rym: No one can figure that out because it's so different.

579
00:36:00,161 --> 00:36:09,860
Rym: But basically, so a 12-year-old child and a bird and some moss together and then make them play Cat's Cradle and that's how their calendar technology works.

580
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:10,668
Scott: Uh-oh.

581
00:36:11,242 --> 00:36:12,699
Rym: And I am not being figurative.

582
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:13,853
Scott: Uh-oh.

583
00:36:15,582 --> 00:36:18,320
Rym: But anyway, night fox gambit is great and it's the GeekNights Book Club book.

584
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:20,680
Rym: The next Thursday show, we're going to do it.

585
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:36,080
Rym: However, this coming Thursday might have to skip the show because the Asifa... There's an LGBTQ+ film festival, an animation film festival that we used to go to every year during Pride around this time of year.

586
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,499
Scott: Until one time.

587
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,572
Rym: I go every year.

588
00:36:38,592 --> 00:36:39,479
Rym: The rest of us go every year.

589
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:41,060
Scott: I went to it one time.

590
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,390
Rym: You're the only one who only went once.

591
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,337
Rym: The rest of us go every year.

592
00:36:43,357 --> 00:36:43,720
Rym: It's a thing.

593
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,014
Scott: How many times is every year?

594
00:36:45,095 --> 00:36:45,480
Scott: Two times?

595
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:46,786
Scott: Four?

596
00:36:46,806 --> 00:36:48,180
Scott: I think four.

597
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:50,995
Rym: It started before then, but I didn't know about it.

598
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:55,148
Rym: But it is at like 7 p.m.

599
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:58,699
Rym: at that same bar with the outdoor area and I'll post a link to it.

600
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,554
Rym: Very, very likely to be there with most of my crew.

601
00:37:02,594 --> 00:37:03,719
Rym: We'll see if Scott is also there.

602
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,760
Scott: Depends on the... I think the weather is going to determine.

603
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,660
Scott: It's going to rain for the next few days.

604
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,420
Rym: If it's pouring rain, I might opt out as much as I love this festival.

605
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,120
Rym: I don't want to bike in pouring rain.

606
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,240
Scott: I did see some good animations the one time I went.

607
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:18,607
Scott: Yeah.

608
00:37:19,301 --> 00:37:19,959
Scott: I would like to go.

609
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:30,000
Rym: I still think back to that one that was just a collection of the dark network of gay porn that was passed around in the early BBS eras.

610
00:37:31,724 --> 00:37:33,099
Rym: That was a fascinating film.

611
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,732
Rym: But otherwise, Scott's been working on the website.

612
00:37:36,752 --> 00:37:37,536
Rym: We're getting close.

613
00:37:38,058 --> 00:37:38,520
Rym: It's coming.

614
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:41,183
Rym: I don't know.

615
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:47,880
Rym: The only con that GeekNights will have any presence at for the foreseeable future is going to be PAX West and likely it's going to be just me.

616
00:37:48,944 --> 00:37:49,979
Rym: And I don't really have anything else.

617
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:52,848
Rym: I don't know what we're going to do about Magfest.

618
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:55,740
Rym: I feel like it's still going to be too soon to go to a con like that.

619
00:37:56,101 --> 00:37:58,556
Scott: I am somewhat hopeful for PAX Unplugged.

620
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,039
Scott: We'll see.

621
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:00,077
Rym: We'll see.

622
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:16,800
Rym: The thing is I highly doubt PAX is going to remove the masking requirement and I can't imagine enough of our friends are going to be excited about getting into an expo hall to play tabletop games and masks versus just gathering at one of our houses that same weekend and playing games comfortably.

623
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,578
Rym: We'll see.

624
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:19,419
Rym: Anyway.

625
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:20,983
Rym: A lot of factors there.

626
00:38:21,525 --> 00:38:23,431
Rym: Let's just dive right into it.

627
00:38:23,972 --> 00:38:25,236
Rym: Save games.

628
00:38:25,397 --> 00:38:26,400
Scott: Never talked about this.

629
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,605
Scott: Thank you listener for this good show idea for once.

630
00:38:29,785 --> 00:38:30,006
Scott: Right.

631
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:38,960
Scott: You know, that listener most of the time gives episode ideas that I have to shoot down, but occasionally has an amazing show idea and saves us a lot of effort and thinking of a show idea.

632
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,747
Scott: Good job.

633
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:40,980
Scott: Save games.

634
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,125
Scott: So we often joke.

635
00:38:43,326 --> 00:38:43,466
Scott: Right.

636
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:45,852
Scott: Because we're so old to the younger people.

637
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:46,333
Scott: Right.

638
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:49,300
Scott: We say I got save games older than you, kid.

639
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:56,421
Rym: And like, yeah, I literally have a save game from 1987.

640
00:38:56,421 --> 00:39:05,320
Rym: That is it is still good because not that long ago I put that Final Fantasy one cartridge in and it still worked into a real NES.

641
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,502
Scott: So video games.

642
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:08,143
Scott: Right.

643
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:18,778
Scott: When they were new, they started out, you know, being, you know, arcade games, oscilloscopes, primitive computers, 70s, you know, 60s, 70s, 80s.

644
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:26,879
Scott: And there was no way for those games to save anything other than the high score.

645
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:27,380
Scott: Right.

646
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:29,363
Scott: The high score list.

647
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:30,005
Scott: That was it.

648
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:33,715
Scott: A very small amount of storage because old computers.

649
00:39:34,517 --> 00:39:34,778
Scott: Right.

650
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:35,460
Scott: Right.

651
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,828
Scott: Nowadays, we're like blessed with amazing storage capacity.

652
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:40,229
Scott: Right.

653
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:41,672
Scott: We have SSDs.

654
00:39:41,732 --> 00:39:45,740
Scott: We got big giant magnetic spinning disk that hold terabytes of data.

655
00:39:46,101 --> 00:39:48,827
Rym: I got a 30 terabyte NAS up above me.

656
00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:54,960
Scott: We have cloud services like S3 that just have a ridiculous petabytes of storage capacity.

657
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:04,260
Scott: It's like it's, you know, but in the earliest days of computing, storage was actually the most limited, most expensive, difficult part.

658
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:04,520
Scott: Right.

659
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:15,280
Scott: It's like you would get this computer, you know, had transistors or vacuum tubes or who knows what and what kind of storage, a magnetic tape that was really slow and could barely hold anything.

660
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,001
Rym: Many times.

661
00:40:16,021 --> 00:40:16,682
Rym: Many times.

662
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:17,504
Rym: Nothing.

663
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:18,686
Scott: A lot of early computers.

664
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:19,968
Scott: That held like a kilobyte.

665
00:40:20,188 --> 00:40:21,390
Rym: A lot of early computers.

666
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:27,000
Rym: You would load programs into it via some means like a cassette or more likely.

667
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:27,761
Rym: A paper tape.

668
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:28,262
Scott: Yeah.

669
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:29,024
Scott: With holes in it.

670
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:36,420
Rym: And the best you could do is output to that same medium, which was challenging, especially in the early days.

671
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:36,801
Rym: Right.

672
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:37,803
Scott: They were slow.

673
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:38,866
Scott: They were unreliable.

674
00:40:38,926 --> 00:40:39,929
Scott: They were cumbersome.

675
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:44,440
Scott: They were, you know, go on YouTube and find videos of people like setting up super old computers.

676
00:40:44,981 --> 00:41:02,400
Scott: And like the whole beginning process is just like typing in a program by hand in order to get the computer to load a program from a storage device like a magnetic tape or a paper tape that can only be read linearly in one direction and not written to.

677
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:16,800
Rym: It's like storage sucked on old computers, basically, which meant early games, early arcade games, that high score list, almost every old arcade game, if you unplug it, that list is instantly gone because they couldn't actually store them.

678
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:17,662
Scott: Right.

679
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:17,782
Scott: Right.

680
00:41:17,802 --> 00:41:23,720
Scott: So the storage devices were big, loud, cumbersome, slow and expensive for a long time.

681
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:31,531
Scott: And therefore, any game that wanted to save anything would typically use what's known as SRAM.

682
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:31,732
Scott: Right.

683
00:41:31,752 --> 00:41:37,300
Scott: Your computers today have DRAM, dynamic RAM, which if you want to know how it works, look it up.

684
00:41:37,901 --> 00:41:40,331
Scott: But static RAM is basically just flip flops.

685
00:41:40,612 --> 00:41:40,893
Scott: Right.

686
00:41:40,953 --> 00:41:42,680
Scott: Which is just a few transistors.

687
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,204
Rym: You don't know what those are.

688
00:41:44,224 --> 00:41:47,700
Rym: There's an ancient episode of GeekNights where we explain what a flip flop is in basic electronics.

689
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,359
Scott: You can also go on YouTube and probably find a thousand videos showing you what a flip flop is.

690
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,365
Rym: The name is descriptive.

691
00:41:52,405 --> 00:41:55,320
Rym: They can flip and flop between states.

692
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,690
Scott: One flip flop is basically a storage device that holds one bit of data, zero or one.

693
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:05,200
Scott: And it's very small and you can have a lot of them and they don't use a lot of electricity.

694
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:08,686
Scott: So in the earliest computers.

695
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:09,207
Scott: Right.

696
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:15,300
Scott: You know, you could flip flops were basically, you know, the storage device of choice.

697
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,986
Scott: But there's still RAM.

698
00:42:18,507 --> 00:42:21,915
Scott: You still have to provide power to keep them on.

699
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:24,200
Scott: If the power gets cut, they lose everything.

700
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:32,580
Rym: So your RAM and your computer uses actually a surprising amount of power because it is constantly refreshing the data that's in it or it'll literally disappear.

701
00:42:33,341 --> 00:42:33,481
Scott: Yeah.

702
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:51,520
Scott: But anyway, so the arcade machines and the NES games that had, you know, batteries in them and whatnot, they were using SRAM chips to hold some small amount of data in memory and remember it as long as the battery didn't die or the power didn't get cut.

703
00:42:52,141 --> 00:42:55,608
Scott: And then if if if the power was lost, that's a good buy.

704
00:42:55,648 --> 00:42:56,169
Scott: save game.

705
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:56,389
Scott: Right.

706
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:01,740
Scott: The only way to have like a more permanent save game was like the Famicom disk system.

707
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:14,178
Scott: Or if you are PC gaming in those early days and you had disk drives and extra disks to save your save games onto, which were not cheap, were not easy generally.

708
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,744
Scott: And it's like those that was not for most people.

709
00:43:19,344 --> 00:43:32,360
Scott: Most people did not experience save games until like, you know, the Super Nintendo, the Genesis, those both had some games also that use batteries and SRAM.

710
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:35,987
Scott: So did the GBA, you know, the Game Boy a little bit.

711
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:41,920
Scott: But real save games didn't really come about until PlayStation had memory cards pretty much.

712
00:43:42,441 --> 00:43:42,661
Scott: Right.

713
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:43,684
Rym: Yeah.

714
00:43:44,045 --> 00:43:49,280
Scott: Though there was an era and the end PCs had and when PCs had more hard drives.

715
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:49,801
Rym: Yeah.

716
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:56,200
Rym: Though there was an era with especially cartridges like the NES, there were the games that had the little battery in them.

717
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:04,379
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, that those are SRAM just saying yes, but you couldn't save that much on those.

718
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,660
Scott: Right.

719
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,065
Scott: It's like there was very.

720
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:09,660
Scott: the amount of data you could save was very small and very limited.

721
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:17,100
Scott: But case in point, Pokemon for the Game Boy had so much like compression technology going on so that they could actually save your game.

722
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,891
Scott: And like you could, you know, it could remember what was in the PC and what was in which box in the PC.

723
00:44:21,971 --> 00:44:23,034
Scott: and what with the?

724
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:25,760
Scott: you customize the names of your Pokemon, you nickname them.

725
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,657
Scott: It's like they were pushing it to the limit with that.

726
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:29,100
Scott: Right.

727
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:30,981
Rym: Yeah.

728
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:42,760
Rym: But NES games that did not do it this way had a way to save games by put by saving them on a physical piece of paper that you as a kid would write down a code of some kind.

729
00:44:43,121 --> 00:44:55,920
Rym: If you ever used a code to resume your progress on an old video game, that code was just literally what would have been stored into that SRAM if you had that in the chip.

730
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,400
Rym: So basically it was getting you as a kid to save the game yourself.

731
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:03,382
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

732
00:45:03,843 --> 00:45:12,200
Scott: And it's, you know, when the amount of data that was being saved was very small and could be encoded in a clever manner, like the way Mega Man games.

733
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,540
Rym: I was going to bring up Mega Man because I remember when I figured out how to give myself an E-Tank.

734
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,643
Scott: Yeah, with the dot grid.

735
00:45:17,683 --> 00:45:24,280
Scott: Well, I just I just had from magazines and friends, I had the codes that took you to Wiley with full everything.

736
00:45:26,463 --> 00:45:28,039
Scott: But yeah, it's like, you know.

737
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,263
Rym: But think about this.

738
00:45:29,764 --> 00:45:33,657
Rym: It's interesting because on one hand, a kid playing, you think, well, I saved my game.

739
00:45:33,717 --> 00:45:34,580
Rym: This is my password.

740
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:41,100
Rym: But having mornosis, you realize that anyone who got to game to that same state would get the same password.

741
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,203
Rym: It's not saving your game.

742
00:45:42,544 --> 00:45:48,440
Rym: It is just an encoding of a state of the game in on a philosophical level.

743
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,820
Rym: Save games are just saving the state of a game.

744
00:45:52,321 --> 00:46:06,500
Rym: And the explosion of storage technology and computing technology got us to a point to where games could have extremely complex and persistent states that were not possible previously.

745
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:16,740
Scott: Yeah, I mean, the capacity for saving a game actually created, you know, that technological advancement changed games themselves.

746
00:46:17,001 --> 00:46:17,161
Scott: Right.

747
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:25,500
Scott: It's like if you couldn't save the game, then basically you had to design a game where where every time you played, you were starting from the same place.

748
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,102
Scott: Right.

749
00:46:27,122 --> 00:46:37,780
Scott: And the game would be enjoyable to replay, even though you were always starting from the same place every single time and redoing whatever it was you were redoing at the beginning every single time.

750
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:48,640
Scott: So you wouldn't want to make a game that was, you know, where all the good parts were at the end and no one would ever reach them or a game with like a lot of stories and chapters.

751
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:49,240
Scott: Right.

752
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:56,699
Scott: I mean, I guess you could let the player just choose their chapter, but it's like that means you're going to have to let someone just start on the last chapter if they want to.

753
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:58,663
Scott: Nothing you could do about it.

754
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:07,560
Scott: You know, you guess you could have cheat codes that'll bring up the, you know, various level selects, but that's basically the same thing as a password.

755
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:22,660
Scott: So, yeah, once save games became a thing and there was more data that was able to be saved, games like Pokémon, all those JRPGs primarily were the first ones, I think, that really took advantage of having a long game.

756
00:47:23,281 --> 00:47:23,582
Scott: Right.

757
00:47:23,703 --> 00:47:28,398
Scott: Where, you know, you would start and, you know, where you left off Final Fantasy 1, whatever.

758
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,367
Scott: And without that ability to save, those games are unplayable.

759
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:38,800
Scott: Nobody is going to beat any of those in one sitting ever unless they're a complete wacko.

760
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:39,480
Rym: Yep.

761
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:48,379
Rym: I had a few games I liked as a kid that did not have any saving capacity and I was never able to beat them until emulators because I couldn't sit there that long.

762
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:49,481
Scott: Yeah.

763
00:47:49,501 --> 00:47:54,412
Rym: What are you going to do, pause the game and just leave the NES on like all night?

764
00:47:54,432 --> 00:47:56,517
Rym: I tried that a few times.

765
00:47:56,838 --> 00:47:57,520
Rym: Didn't always work.

766
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:05,820
Scott: Or even if you could, it's like, okay, but you get to the hard part, you got your one shot at the hard part, you try to do it, you fail.

767
00:48:06,481 --> 00:48:13,220
Scott: And it's like, okay, well, I just need to practice that hard part a few times, but to get another practice shot, you have to get through the whole game again.

768
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:24,740
Scott: It's like, if you can save, at least you can load your save and just keep trying the hard part over and over until you get it and not have to keep redoing all the other parts every single time.

769
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:25,361
Rym: Yep.

770
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:31,094
Rym: Now this opened up a lot of the games that we like today, like a game like Civilization.

771
00:48:31,395 --> 00:48:33,540
Rym: Well, you're going to play that over weeks, possibly.

772
00:48:34,321 --> 00:48:36,050
Rym: You couldn't save your game, save the state.

773
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:38,180
Rym: It's a game over, literally.

774
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:39,354
Scott: Yep.

775
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:52,140
Scott: It's hard to even think, you know, even today, games that are not in themselves a long game, they still end up having lots of things that you save, right?

776
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,320
Scott: Unlocked characters or, you know.

777
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,551
Rym: Well, look at the new Turtles game that we'll talk about in a future episode.

778
00:48:59,961 --> 00:49:01,860
Rym: It has a stateful and a stateless mode.

779
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,940
Rym: You can play it the normal story mode where you'll unlock stuff and like there's some sort of progression.

780
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:15,220
Rym: But you can also put it in arcade mode where it's basically, you've got X continues, X lives, it's completely stateless, go notched, it's just like the old days.

781
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:17,942
Rym: And I appreciate that.

782
00:49:18,403 --> 00:49:27,180
Rym: Game design has changed a lot and I think there's a lot of things we can talk about in terms of how saving games and save states and all these things can affect game design.

783
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:36,280
Rym: For example, a lot of games use the concept of you can only save at certain points, which becomes a checkpointing system in a sense.

784
00:49:36,761 --> 00:49:46,500
Rym: So like early Final Fantasy games, you'd often have a save point and then an arduous quest like get into that marsh cave, get the crown and get back out.

785
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:50,491
Rym: And you got to finish that entire quest in one go.

786
00:49:50,511 --> 00:49:53,339
Rym: if you don't make it out before you can't save your game.

787
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:02,820
Scott: Yeah, now some of that does, like you just said, stem from, you know, a good or maybe sometimes not so good game design concept, right?

788
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,039
Rym: Because that adds a sense of peril.

789
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,280
Scott: Before a boss fight and after a boss fight and whatnot, right?

790
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:17,700
Scott: But also in not wanting to let the player, like if you just let them save whenever, well, they might, you know, be one bad guy, save, jump on a goomba, save and like slowly beat the game that way.

791
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:27,660
Scott: But they also stem from a technological limitation in that if you let someone just save in any old place, right, it's like, well, that's a lot more data that you have to save in the save file.

792
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,068
Scott: Like where did they save?

793
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:30,899
Scott: What was the state of the game when they saved?

794
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:39,220
Scott: And by having specific save spots, it's like, okay, you could have these discrete spots where saving happens.

795
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:50,140
Scott: You don't need to account for situations where they might save in some weird spot or, and you can clearly encode like, you know, which save spot did they save in?

796
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,184
Scott: They saved in save spot number seven.

797
00:50:52,225 --> 00:50:57,860
Scott: It only takes up one space in the memory to figure out where the character should be in the game.

798
00:50:58,441 --> 00:51:02,951
Scott: If you don't have that, well, now you need to encode the full location of the character.

799
00:51:03,011 --> 00:51:06,960
Scott: They were in level seven at this coordinate and this coordinate, right?

800
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:11,567
Scott: It's, it might not be that much more data depending on the game, but it could be more.

801
00:51:11,928 --> 00:51:19,860
Scott: And it was very much at a premium in those early computers, you know, systems of how much data you could save.

802
00:51:20,341 --> 00:51:28,480
Rym: And nowadays there are basically zero technical limitations on how saving and suspending and all these different things work.

803
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:37,360
Rym: So now anything you encounter, except in extremely esoteric situations are going to be game design decisions.

804
00:51:37,901 --> 00:51:50,800
Rym: And at this point, the intersection of game design and accessibility and playability becomes a very dynamic and changing and interesting space that we, there's no way we can fully cover in one episode of GeekNights.

805
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:57,240
Rym: For example, some games, the idea of permadeath, let's forget the history of where it came from.

806
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:05,120
Rym: So nowadays you can make a game where you can save your game, keep going, save your game, go eat dinner, load the save file, play again.

807
00:52:05,461 --> 00:52:12,580
Rym: But if you die, all those save files get deleted because you want the concept of permadeath, permanent death.

808
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,428
Rym: Slay the Spire is an example of this.

809
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:16,720
Rym: You can stop playing at any time and save your game.

810
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,846
Rym: Like if you're busy, house is on fire.

811
00:52:18,887 --> 00:52:22,860
Rym: You don't keep playing Slay the Spire, like pause the game, save it and leave.

812
00:52:23,521 --> 00:52:27,248
Rym: But you can only load a save file once effectively.

813
00:52:27,549 --> 00:52:33,120
Rym: So you can't save the game, try something, fail, go back, load the save file, try it again.

814
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:39,852
Scott: Well, except you can because if, you know, not officially, but it's just a file on your computer.

815
00:52:39,892 --> 00:52:44,540
Scott: You could go and just move the file, copy it and then copy it back into position.

816
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:45,603
Rym: Exactly.

817
00:52:45,623 --> 00:52:46,720
Scott: Cheat, basically.

818
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:52,235
Rym: And as well, we've always said, unless there's competition involved, there's no such thing as cheating in a single player game.

819
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:53,920
Rym: So play however you want.

820
00:52:54,321 --> 00:53:04,240
Rym: That's why I do applaud the fact that permadeath type things still exist, because I think they do serve as a very interesting challenge, that an interesting aspect of parallel to games.

821
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:08,125
Rym: But I like the idea that you can opt out of that.

822
00:53:08,646 --> 00:53:16,960
Rym: And since you could fuck with the game anyway by hacking it or cheating in some fashion, why not just make it an option that you could turn off in a single player game?

823
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,278
Rym: And a lot of games do that.

824
00:53:19,081 --> 00:53:19,983
Scott: Well, that's true.

825
00:53:20,143 --> 00:53:29,460
Scott: There are some options, especially a permadeath option that, you know, games will let the player choose, because obviously there's no point in forcing that on someone.

826
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,920
Rym: But if that game is a competitive game with a ladder, you can't do that.

827
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:34,683
Scott: Well, maybe it depends.

828
00:53:34,783 --> 00:53:36,206
Scott: But here's the thing.

829
00:53:37,108 --> 00:53:39,173
Scott: You could take that argument even further.

830
00:53:39,193 --> 00:53:42,500
Scott: A save file is just data in a file, right?

831
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:47,611
Scott: For example, I loaded up some old gold box D&D games on GOG, right?

832
00:53:48,352 --> 00:53:52,060
Scott: And it's just the save file is just a fucking file.

833
00:53:52,581 --> 00:53:55,687
Scott: So and you're like you're sitting there like rolling your character's stats.

834
00:53:55,868 --> 00:53:56,469
Scott: I didn't do that.

835
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:58,975
Scott: I rolled up characters with random stats.

836
00:53:59,296 --> 00:54:01,320
Scott: I opened up the save file in a hex editor.

837
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:04,418
Rym: Oh, look, suddenly 18 strength, 18 charisma, 18 dexterity.

838
00:54:04,418 --> 00:54:05,562
Rym: 18?

839
00:54:05,562 --> 00:54:14,320
Scott: You mean 99 strength, 99 charisma, 99 dex as the highest number that would fit in the file without breaking the game.

840
00:54:14,801 --> 00:54:18,356
Scott: Oh, let me just give myself all the best equipment and a million HP.

841
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:19,179
Scott: And it's, you know.

842
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,600
Scott: Thank you for saving us, SOH character.

843
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,061
Scott: Right.

844
00:54:23,121 --> 00:54:23,441
Scott: It's like.

845
00:54:24,902 --> 00:54:44,380
Scott: so, you know, it's like trying to prevent if as soon as you have a save file in some way, trying to prevent the player from having full control over what's in that save file is just sort of like you're just taking advantage of their technological, lack of technological prowess.

846
00:54:44,741 --> 00:54:45,322
Rym: It is effort.

847
00:54:45,342 --> 00:54:55,420
Rym: Like if you're on a Nintendo Switch playing a game that has a permadeath option and you turn that option off, what percentage of people would bother to try to recover that save file?

848
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,001
Rym: Well, if it's a no.

849
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:57,724
Scott: But if it's an option, then there's no point.

850
00:54:57,804 --> 00:55:06,840
Scott: But if you're making a JRPG today, for example, I would argue that not only if you want let's say you want to have permadeath in your JRPG for some reason.

851
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,681
Scott: OK, go ahead.

852
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:08,763
Scott: Make an option for that.

853
00:55:08,803 --> 00:55:09,003
Scott: Right.

854
00:55:09,044 --> 00:55:14,713
Scott: But why not have also an option for literally everything that's in the save file?

855
00:55:14,753 --> 00:55:19,300
Scott: Let them choose which save spot they're at, which characters are in the party, what their levels are.

856
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,310
Rym: And a lot of games do this, even if it's not super well documented with the debugger mode.

857
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:27,140
Rym: A lot of games have a debug mode you can access in game if you know what to do.

858
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,367
Scott: Give the give the players a save editor.

859
00:55:29,447 --> 00:55:30,451
Scott: Almost no one does that.

860
00:55:30,471 --> 00:55:33,060
Scott: There's plenty of save editors that, you know, people have made.

861
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,020
Rym: Civilization games were notable in the early days that they documented all of this and encouraged you to fuck around.

862
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,223
Scott: Yes, though very few.

863
00:55:41,324 --> 00:55:48,180
Scott: But the vast majority of games do not expect the player to even realize that save editing is a possibility.

864
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:52,666
Scott: But it very much is pretty much for every save game ever.

865
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:56,393
Scott: And I think that we should make save editing more accessible.

866
00:55:57,154 --> 00:56:00,140
Scott: It's like if it's a single player game, who cares?

867
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,908
Scott: If someone was wants to see the game ending, it's like they could see it on YouTube.

868
00:56:04,229 --> 00:56:08,520
Scott: What does it matter if they used to edit their save file to see the same thing they could have seen on YouTube?

869
00:56:08,881 --> 00:56:09,441
Scott: Who cares?

870
00:56:09,922 --> 00:56:10,903
Scott: But yeah, there's a thing.

871
00:56:11,224 --> 00:56:13,107
Scott: Speedrunners use it a lot.

872
00:56:13,948 --> 00:56:19,616
Scott: It's called save scumming, where you basically use a save game.

873
00:56:20,237 --> 00:56:22,220
Scott: You intentionally save your game.

874
00:56:23,321 --> 00:56:31,260
Scott: And then you do something that can't be undone, usually to acquire information, like maybe in a randomizer game.

875
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:36,109
Scott: So let's say you're playing Link to the Past randomizer and you have the mushroom.

876
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:41,720
Scott: It's like, well, you could use the mushroom to give it what you're supposed to do with the intended use.

877
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,920
Scott: You give it to the witch and you get a random item from the witch in Link to the Past.

878
00:56:48,820 --> 00:57:01,080
Scott: But there is a glitch in Link to the Past randomizer where if you have the mushroom, you can basically do fake powder and go to the magic bat and get the magic pat to give you the magic bat item.

879
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:07,093
Scott: Even if you don't have the magic powder that you would normally need, you know, there's a trick you can do with the mushroom.

880
00:57:07,574 --> 00:57:10,060
Scott: But if you gave the mushroom to the witch, you can't do that anymore.

881
00:57:11,401 --> 00:57:17,276
Scott: So what you can do is you can save your game, give the mushroom to the witch, see if what the witch gives you is any good.

882
00:57:17,296 --> 00:57:19,000
Scott: If it is, okay, fine.

883
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:26,620
Scott: But if the witch gives you some garbage, just load the save game, undo what you just did, and then go give the mushroom to the magic bat instead.

884
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:36,577
Scott: And you're sort of somewhat cheating by saving, but it's part of the game because the other player, you're racing another person who's playing the same game and they can do it too.

885
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:37,820
Scott: So it's not cheating.

886
00:57:39,701 --> 00:57:40,842
Rym: Well, never mind save states.

887
00:57:40,983 --> 00:57:45,949
Rym: And it's notable that, you know, that was something that only existed in emulators for the longest time.

888
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:54,860
Rym: But like today on the switch, if you use the NES or the SNES emulator built in there, you can just rewind time and make save states and all the stuff that emulators use to do.

889
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:58,847
Scott: So a save state goes beyond a normal save game, right?

890
00:57:58,927 --> 00:58:06,380
Scott: A save game is like the game itself has designed a system for saving specific data to load later.

891
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:15,300
Scott: A save state is literally freeze the state, you know, because my computer has so much storage, I'll just freeze the entire emulated computer.

892
00:58:16,281 --> 00:58:25,700
Scott: All of its RAM, all of its everything and save it to disk and load it up later as if the computer was on the whole time, as if the NES was paused that whole time.

893
00:58:26,341 --> 00:58:31,580
Scott: And I can have as many of these save states as I want because my hard drive is enormous and I can load any one of them that I want.

894
00:58:32,181 --> 00:58:40,720
Scott: And it's like, so any previous game state that I have managed to achieve, I can rewind to that and basically beat any game.

895
00:58:41,341 --> 00:58:41,481
Scott: Right?

896
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:51,020
Scott: Like you could play Contra and move forward an inch, save, move forward an inch, save, got hit, load, and you'll eventually beat Contra without dying even if you suck.

897
00:58:52,221 --> 00:58:52,682
Rym: And you know what?

898
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:58,580
Rym: This is a perfectly fine way to play because one of the things that, again, this now becomes purely a game design decision.

899
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:05,180
Rym: Some games have a sort of punishment where there are parts of the game that are hard to get to and are themselves hard.

900
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:13,220
Rym: So you have to be good enough to get past the hard part and then you have even fewer attempts at the harder part because you don't always get there.

901
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:19,220
Rym: But with save states, beat the hard part and then just try the harder part over and over and over again.

902
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:28,419
Rym: So in a way, save states help players gain mastery of games by letting them micro-practice and target the parts of the game they engage with.

903
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:41,180
Rym: Whereas in the old days or games that prevent this or don't include this as a game design aspect, you generally play the early parts of the game more often and the later parts of the game less often and are less good at the later parts.

904
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:48,000
Rym: So, like in FTL, you don't fight the mothership that often on the harder modes.

905
00:59:50,461 --> 01:00:01,800
Scott: I mean, I think you'll see, you know, most games these days, the AAA games and whatnot that are long, they don't necessarily have saved because the save state of the game is so much larger because it's a more complex game.

906
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,456
Scott: You can't load it and save it that quickly like you can with an NES emulator.

907
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:06,179
Scott: It would be like instant.

908
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:13,000
Scott: But they'll just let you quick save or full save and just make as many save files as you like and load them however you like.

909
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:19,400
Scott: And it's like, go ahead and do whatever, you know, save as much as you want, you know, to get through this game.

910
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,526
Scott: It's a single player game.

911
01:00:20,546 --> 01:00:23,080
Scott: You're going to get to the end somehow, right?

912
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:32,060
Rym: I mean, I used to save, like in Half-Life 2, I used saving the game a lot like how I would use my fingers and choose your own adventure books.

913
01:00:32,481 --> 01:00:35,010
Rym: I'd see something that obviously looks really dangerous.

914
01:00:35,392 --> 01:00:37,419
Rym: I'd save my game and go fuck with it and it kills me.

915
01:00:37,741 --> 01:00:42,659
Rym: Then I'd load my game and either fuck with it more carefully or not fuck with it.

916
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,574
Rym: Like, I wonder if that'll kill me if I jump in there.

917
01:00:45,594 --> 01:00:46,057
Rym: Save game?

918
01:00:46,218 --> 01:00:46,380
Rym: Yep.

919
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:56,700
Scott: Yeah, I think some of the times, right, is like this, you know, the saving is used, you know, when something is like difficult or challenging and you want to learn it.

920
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:02,880
Scott: But sometimes it's actually sort of, you know, allowing the player to conquer bad game design, right?

921
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:06,237
Scott: There'll be something in the game and the player like doesn't know, right?

922
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,300
Rym: Can I land on that platform is such a common terrible design problem.

923
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,464
Scott: Right, it's like, can I stand on that?

924
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:13,367
Scott: Is that fire?

925
01:01:13,688 --> 01:01:16,940
Scott: Does this item, you know, I have one ice item.

926
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,440
Scott: If I use the ice item, will it make, will it work on that lava?

927
01:01:21,461 --> 01:01:22,766
Scott: It's like, I've only got one shot.

928
01:01:22,867 --> 01:01:23,549
Scott: Let me try it.

929
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:26,280
Scott: I'll save, try it, and load if it doesn't work, right?

930
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,667
Scott: Otherwise you try it.

931
01:01:27,687 --> 01:01:28,934
Scott: It's like, that was your one shot.

932
01:01:29,115 --> 01:01:29,900
Scott: It's like, god damn it.

933
01:01:31,481 --> 01:01:42,747
Scott: You know, and I think that's, you know, when you see situations like that in games where the player's knowledge is lacking and they're using saves to overcome that, I think that's a sign of a bad game design.

934
01:01:42,787 --> 01:01:47,340
Scott: Like you shouldn't have a situation where a player has to make a decision based on ignorance.

935
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,784
Rym: The galaxy brain is.

936
01:01:48,804 --> 01:01:55,371
Rym: you design a game around that where the players want to take radical experiments, but you design the game where you don't have to save and load.

937
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:56,920
Rym: It handles it more gracefully.

938
01:01:57,281 --> 01:02:03,715
Rym: Like Prince of Persia pioneered that rewind game design, that game mechanic, the rewind.

939
01:02:04,156 --> 01:02:06,160
Rym: I'm a big fan of the rewind.

940
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,000
Scott: Yeah, rewind is good.

941
01:02:09,543 --> 01:02:09,804
Scott: Yeah.

942
01:02:09,844 --> 01:02:14,620
Rym: So, we've already gone on pretty long, but another aspect is tabletop games.

943
01:02:16,162 --> 01:02:42,780
Rym: On one hand, they intrinsically save themselves because if you just walk away from the table, barring a little bit of, unless the game is lacking something like a whose turn is it marker, or you have to make sure you leave the game at a defined point where you know where in like the turn order or the states of the game that are not determined by physical components are, then all the rest of the state of a tabletop game is saved by the nature of the fact that it's a tabletop game.

944
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:51,848
Rym: But at the same time, that's a lot like RAM in that if something jars the table ever so slightly, it's destroyed and unfixable.

945
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:57,625
Rym: We used to, I remember, occasionally take a picture of a game just in case so we could reset it back up.

946
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,980
Rym: Rarely did we actually reset it back up, but we had the option.

947
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:08,213
Scott: I think part of the problem is that, you know, even if you save the physical state of a game, saving a tabletop game has this mental state.

948
01:03:08,233 --> 01:03:09,640
Scott: Well, video games does too, right?

949
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:19,680
Rym: Yeah, so like Civ games, if I pick up an asynchronous Civ game, I'm sort of in this cadence because I only play so many at a time and I remember what's going on because it's refreshing my brain.

950
01:03:20,201 --> 01:03:29,651
Rym: But if I go take a save game from when I played Civ by myself, I will be materially worse because I don't remember all the details of what I was going after.

951
01:03:29,671 --> 01:03:32,420
Rym: Like, was I going for like a campus in that district?

952
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:33,700
Rym: What exactly was I doing?

953
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:43,620
Scott: There's all this information related to a game that is not in the game itself, that is in your mind, your brain state, that is unsavable and you don't have an amazing memory.

954
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:47,780
Rym: A lot of that is your strategy, things you remember other players doing.

955
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:51,554
Rym: Like, wait, did Scott need a lot of iron in this game?

956
01:03:51,855 --> 01:03:53,020
Rym: or am I remembering wrong?

957
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:56,460
Rym: Was I trying to corner the iron market to fuck Scott or did I have some other reason?

958
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:59,520
Scott: This also happens in the single player video games, right?

959
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:06,640
Scott: It's like if you're playing Final Fantasy 7 and you save it and you load it again a month later and you forget the plot, it's like, just start over.

960
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:08,265
Rym: Oh my God.

961
01:04:08,746 --> 01:04:17,599
Rym: I, in Final Fantasy Legend 1 on the Game Boy, I walked away from it for like a year or two as a kid and I hadn't beaten it.

962
01:04:18,082 --> 01:04:19,840
Rym: I picked it up one day, I was like, I should finish that game.

963
01:04:20,301 --> 01:04:23,540
Rym: And then I load the game, I see my characters, I go through my inventory.

964
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:24,360
Scott: It's the one with the tower.

965
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:24,801
Scott: Yep.

966
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:30,100
Rym: I didn't remember which direction I was going in the tower, like which stairway was what.

967
01:04:31,122 --> 01:04:34,620
Rym: And it wasn't obvious and I tried to start a new game to see, it still wasn't obvious.

968
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:48,158
Rym: So I basically walked in a direction fighting monsters for a while and it took me like at least a half hour of play to figure out what direction I should be going in and what I was supposed to be doing next.

969
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,800
Rym: Modern games handle that a lot better, thankfully.

970
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:55,720
Scott: Well, I think what has helped those situations a lot now also is facts, right?

971
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,920
Scott: Just go online and look up a, you know, a guide or something.

972
01:04:58,940 --> 01:04:59,880
Rym: Yeah, that used to not exist.

973
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:17,400
Rym: Also a lot of games, like even Zelda games pretty early on started incorporating a character you can go talk to who will remind you of at least something in the forward thinking that you still need to do that you could go do to get you back on some track.

974
01:05:18,361 --> 01:05:18,682
Scott: Yep.

975
01:05:18,762 --> 01:05:24,760
Scott: Games have done quite a lot to try to help players get back into them after loading a save after a long time.

976
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:29,540
Scott: But even if I loaded Breath of the Wild now, I'd still feel like, just start over.

977
01:05:30,201 --> 01:05:30,483
Rym: Yep.

978
01:05:30,965 --> 01:05:33,600
Rym: I mean, I load my save file now and I've beaten the whole game pretty much.

979
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,624
Rym: Which has not much to do.

980
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:39,240
Rym: But if I had a save file that was like halfway through the game, fuck, start over.

981
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:40,982
Scott: Yep, exactly.

982
01:05:41,002 --> 01:05:48,280
Scott: So, you know, and then I guess we could, you know, there's a lot to say about saving with regards to multiplayer and statefulness MMO type things.

983
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:52,480
Rym: The fact that civilization games cannot fucking do it for the like, I'm sorry.

984
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:52,921
Rym: Right.

985
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:59,868
Scott: And the only thing I really want to say about that is that, you know, saving is sort of integral to those games because they're about statefulness.

986
01:05:59,908 --> 01:06:02,440
Scott: There's this shared global state that you're all modifying.

987
01:06:03,082 --> 01:06:08,740
Scott: But I really wish that someone would make one that was sort of not stateful, right?

988
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:15,680
Scott: Like imagine an MMO where you actually, you can't save anything and you, you know, it's like we have all these roguelikes.

989
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:21,840
Scott: It's like you play the MMO, you start a new character, you play until you die, and then you start a new character and play until you die.

990
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:22,743
Scott: But MMO.

991
01:06:23,285 --> 01:06:27,060
Scott: It's like, if that exists somewhere, I haven't heard of it, but I want to see that.

992
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:35,190
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

993
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:40,330
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

994
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:45,730
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

995
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:48,650
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

996
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:53,410
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

999
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:04,370
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1000
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:10,630
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Link Egeed, Red Lulu, Tenebrae, and a bunch of people who really don't want me to say their names.

1001
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:25,990
Rym: Chris The Dog, Chris Rymer, Clinton Walton, Dex Finch, Chi-I85, Rebecca Dunne, Review, Madbull34, Coward, Sam Erickson, Jordan Von Hurl, Stop All, The Downloading, Taylor Braun, The Next Stationist, Anglington West, Anglington West Station, and several other people whose names I will not say.

1002
01:07:26,452 --> 01:07:27,296
Rym: Stay safe out there.

1003
01:07:27,999 --> 01:07:30,390
Rym: We'll see if we do a show or if we go to that screening on Thursday.

1004
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:33,090
Rym: Or if we do both, we'll see what the timing looks like.

1005
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:35,503
Rym: But for now, I simply leave you with...

1006
01:07:56,030 --> 01:08:12,030
Scott: [MUSIC] [MUSIC].
