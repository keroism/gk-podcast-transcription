1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,998
Rym: It's Thursday, April 28th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,998 --> 00:00:10,199
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:13,970
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,577
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,030
Rym: Tonight we are talking about handwriting and penmanship.

6
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:21,989
Rym: The only classes I ever got Ds in in my entire pre-college life.

7
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:24,408
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:34,710
Rym: So, as you all know, Emily and I were at PAX East 2022 for all told about four hours on Thursday.

9
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:37,829
Rym: Because we're really sticking around due to COVID and everything.

10
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:40,376
Scott: And there were some people getting COVID.

11
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:48,604
Scott: I saw another PAX person today post a photo of a positive rapid test with two solid lines on it.

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,334
Scott: Ooh, the solid lines.

13
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:53,986
Rym: Mine was like a barely visible line.

14
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:54,730
Rym: Like you could almost not.

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:55,472
Scott: Two solid lines.

16
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:04,750
Scott: And it's like, you know, that is a person who, you know, is a person that I, when I go to PAX, I spend time near that person, at least at PAX East.

17
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:10,166
Scott: And I probably would have gotten sick from them if I had done a normal PAX East.

18
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:14,570
Scott: It is a good chance I would have gotten sick from that person.

19
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:15,392
Rym: Yep.

20
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:17,300
Rym: And I'm going to be just very direct about this.

21
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:23,229
Rym: Had I not, and Emily not, already gotten COVID because of my job like a month ago.

22
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,949
Scott: I don't know how much that really, you know.

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:32,930
Rym: No, I mean, if I hadn't already gotten it, I would have canceled because the numbers seemed too high and I feel like I would have been corrected.

24
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,020
Scott: The number is going up.

25
00:01:34,504 --> 00:01:34,907
Scott: I don't like it.

26
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:45,990
Rym: But this, according to my doctor and the CDC, the, the like extra immunity that we have because we got this Omicron variant, it lasts at most three months and then we could get it again.

27
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,910
Rym: So back to full lockdown soon for us.

28
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,999
Scott: I don't even know if you don't even know if you really get, you know, how, how immune are you, right?

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,470
Scott: It's like, yeah.

30
00:01:54,610 --> 00:02:02,310
Rym: Well, I mean, think about that when you get like a flu or anything else, you don't get it again from like yourself and your own like contaminated house right away.

31
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:07,390
Rym: But then if you go out in the street six months later, you could get that exact same flu.

32
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:08,852
Scott: Sure.

33
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:17,622
Scott: But it could also, you know, it's like, you know, this, this, this, you know, COVID keeps a mega time, like a T, there could be a 995 to you that just hasn't arisen yet.

34
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:26,390
Scott: There was a time in my life where I think I had a cold and then it, then I got a different cold immediately.

35
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,964
Rym: Oh, I, uh, when I was a kid, there was a situation where I got a bad cold and a serious flu simultaneously.

36
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:35,150
Rym: And I had to be hospitalized.

37
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,250
Rym: Somehow that Dana Carvey special.

38
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:50,150
Rym: Anyway, so at PAX, we all, I did, we did the Atari game design panel, but I had Emily be player two and it went real well.

39
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,909
Rym: We got a ton of positive feedback because almost no GeekNights, listeners, people who had never heard of us before fill in this room.

40
00:02:56,773 --> 00:03:00,450
Rym: And, uh, I made a very brief joke.

41
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,550
Rym: I was, I, I, something like something was worth, like the value of this thing becomes zero.

42
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:11,030
Rym: And then I paused and I did the kind of Rym joke, just like an NFT.

43
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:14,550
Rym: And in the crowd, I noticed something very specific.

44
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:18,690
Rym: Most of the crowd laughed, like, like out loud.

45
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,449
Rym: They were like, ah, fucking NFTs.

46
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:28,470
Rym: But I very specifically saw a handful of people who visibly frown and furrowed their brows.

47
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:29,908
Scott: Yeah, of course.

48
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:41,237
Rym: That's 100% of the people who appeared to not be happy about that were white, white men who appeared to be between the age of 25 and 35.

49
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:41,868
Scott: Yeah, of course.

50
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:49,624
Rym: Yeah, that's not a surprise, but I was very heartened by the fact that the vast majority of the room kind of had a moment of, haha, fuck NFTs.

51
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,170
Rym: Also, uh, yeah, no, that I don't, no one knows about Pitfall 2.

52
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,649
Rym: Like nobody knows that game exists.

53
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,090
Scott: I didn't know until recently the fullness of Pitfall 2.

54
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:01,633
Scott: There's a reason.

55
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:04,410
Rym: when we did that panel, I was like, Scott, oh my, you got to see this shit.

56
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:05,428
Rym: And then I started it.

57
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:07,630
Rym: I was shocked when I found that ROM.

58
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:08,848
Rym: I didn't know it existed.

59
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:13,330
Scott: Anyway, I knew about all kinds of other pitfalls.

60
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:19,610
Rym: So, uh, the bad ones in particular, my favorite awful game done quick ever is still super Pitfall.

61
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,027
Rym: That is the funniest shit.

62
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:37,810
Rym: So, uh, anyway, in the news, I got two very related newses because the FAA is going after two different sets of people for basically the same bullshit on different scales.

63
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:53,789
Rym: And it's extra funny because of all the federal institutions in the United States, there's one that is very powerful and unlike the others has not been heavily gutted by our terrible governments over the years.

64
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:55,187
Rym: And that is the FAA.

65
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,148
Scott: It's like the FAA.

66
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:08,690
Scott: It's like that is, you know, I mean, I'm sure they're, they're airplane experts, aviation nerds, FAA insiders, government people who are going to be like, oh, you guys don't know what you're talking about.

67
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,630
Scott: The FAA has this problem and this problem.

68
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,447
Rym: And they're just not saying it doesn't have problems, but compare it to what we've done to the CDC or the FDA.

69
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:18,949
Scott: Yeah.

70
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:34,398
Scott: It's like the, the, if there are problems at the FAA, which I'm sure there are, they are not extremely visible to, you know, the common person in the way that, you know, other dysfunction and other government agencies is.

71
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:46,590
Scott: also when you read the news, you know, most public news, I guess if you're not reading aviation news is like, the FAA seems to get things done when planes crash.

72
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,310
Scott: It's usually not because of regulatory failure.

73
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,750
Scott: It's because of, you know, people being bad, right?

74
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,030
Rym: It's like, you know, these are extremely safe if you follow the rules, right?

75
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:06,170
Scott: And it's like there, they appear to the general public to be doing about as good a job as a government regulatory body can be doing.

76
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:08,890
Rym: But I saw a tweet cause I didn't know a lot.

77
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:15,890
Rym: I didn't think a lot about this, but I was doing a little bit of research around these stories and I found a tweet from what's clearly some aviation nerd guy.

78
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,769
Rym: And it was what it was roughly a meme, but the format was FBI coming after you.

79
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:21,989
Rym: Eh, I'll live.

80
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,570
Rym: FAA's on you leaving the country right now.

81
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:31,109
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, the FAA, they can't really, they can make you stop flying, I guess.

82
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:32,929
Rym: Which is a pretty big deal.

83
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,215
Scott: So, well, it's a big deal.

84
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:36,230
Scott: if you're a pilot, you lose your livelihood.

85
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:43,350
Rym: So story number one, some stunt people wanted to do what is honestly a fucking awesome stunt.

86
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,730
Rym: They were going to fly two planes and they did this.

87
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,447
Scott: What kind of planes?

88
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,268
Rym: Uh, like prop planes, like a Cessna looking thing.

89
00:06:49,683 --> 00:06:49,789
Rym: Okay.

90
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,588
Rym: Gonna fly two planes.

91
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:55,010
Rym: They're going to simultaneously jump out of each of their respective planes.

92
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,337
Scott: And parachute a distance into the other planes.

93
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,468
Rym: Like it's a big stunt they're going to do.

94
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:08,454
Scott: Well, are there going to be second backup people flying the planes while they're parachuting?

95
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,650
Scott: or were those planes just going to be empty?

96
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,308
Rym: So this is why the FAA is going after them.

97
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:21,544
Rym: They did all their tests of this stunt with backup pilots in the planes, obviously like it would be stupid not to.

98
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:24,009
Rym: Uh, and the FAA was like, you know what?

99
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:27,470
Rym: You can do this stunts the way you've tested it totally fine.

100
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:32,909
Rym: And at the last minute they're like, yeah, so we're not going to have the backup pilots because it doesn't look good on TV.

101
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,950
Rym: It's not as scary to everybody.

102
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,150
Rym: And the FAA immediately, their response was, uh, by all means present.

103
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,869
Rym: No, their response was what the fuck?

104
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,149
Rym: Absolutely not.

105
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:45,709
Rym: Under no circumstances are you to do this.

106
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:46,249
Scott: Yes.

107
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,509
Scott: You cannot have a plane flying in the air with nobody in it.

108
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:55,624
Scott: Just like you can't have a car driving down the road with nobody in it or a train with no engineer there, right?

109
00:07:56,591 --> 00:08:03,607
Scott: It's even if you have an amazing autopilot system, which like when you fly a commercial flight, the autopilot is from what I've learned doing.

110
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:06,090
Scott: It's like, it's controlling it most of the way.

111
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:06,510
Scott: Right.

112
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:14,109
Rym: I mean, remember the famous Kennedy, the ghost flight where everyone on the plane died and the plane just kept flying until I ran out of fuel.

113
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:17,246
Scott: But it's like, you got to have a person sitting there, right?

114
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:18,947
Rym: Yeah.

115
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:27,210
Scott: Because you're, it's not just if it was only your own life being put at risk, then it's a stunt car in a test track.

116
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:27,790
Rym: All right.

117
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,730
Rym: It runs into the wall of the test track.

118
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:36,150
Scott: And it's like, or the stunt driver who signed up to take this risk is the person who is taking all the risk and everyone else is safe.

119
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:48,010
Scott: But if you have a plane flying in the air and there's no one in it and it crashes, you just killed or severely injured or damaged some innocent people or property or, you know, That had nothing to do with it.

120
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:49,124
Scott: And that's a no, no.

121
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:50,227
Rym: Yup.

122
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:53,789
Scott: So, uh, of course, yourself at risk all you want, just not anyone else.

123
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:59,190
Rym: So of course the stunt, uh, went wrong and, uh, they, cause they did it anyway.

124
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:00,350
Rym: They ignored the FAA.

125
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:01,244
Rym: They did it.

126
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,870
Rym: And one of the planes crashed.

127
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,169
Rym: The guy didn't make it into the plane.

128
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,570
Scott: It flew off in a, they did it with the no pilots in the planes.

129
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:09,186
Rym: Yup.

130
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:11,430
Rym: It flew off in a random direction and crashed.

131
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:20,669
Rym: And now the FAA is like, well, so as of Dateline now, quote, the FAA has not yet said what kind of punishment those involved will face.

132
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:21,500
Scott: Severe.

133
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,010
Scott: I imagine severe.

134
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:26,489
Scott: So what did the plane crash into?

135
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:27,870
Scott: Hopefully not any people.

136
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,430
Rym: Luckily the middle of the desert.

137
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:30,650
Scott: Oh, desert.

138
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:30,970
Scott: Okay.

139
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,199
Scott: Good.

140
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,070
Scott: Oh, hopefully not a rare old cactus.

141
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:35,949
Rym: Oh my God.

142
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,490
Rym: I'm glad you know about the rural cactuses.

143
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,889
Rym: That's something that's a topic that I'm specifically mad about.

144
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:42,428
Scott: Okay.

145
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:43,789
Scott: You should be mad about it.

146
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:49,106
Rym: Just like taxes take like 400 years to grow in some dipshit with a pickup truck shoots at it and then steals it.

147
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:49,660
Scott: Yup.

148
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:57,970
Rym: Anyway, that is so much less egregious than this other FAA news that also just happened.

149
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:08,349
Rym: So some YouTuber guy who I'd never heard of, uh, had a live stream and a video where he had the harrowing tale.

150
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,850
Rym: The YouTube video was titled.

151
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:13,150
Rym: I crashed my plane and it shows he's doing some flight.

152
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,190
Rym: He's like a flying guy, YouTube channel, whatever.

153
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,867
Scott: He had a pilot's license, like legitimately doing everything legit, but something goes wrong.

154
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,410
Rym: The like the engines out, uh, I'm over the mountains.

155
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:23,644
Rym: Oh no.

156
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:24,389
Rym: My engines out.

157
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,190
Rym: And like he panics, he does a bunch of stuff.

158
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:30,310
Rym: And then he's like, guys, I got a bail and he bails out of the plane and parachutes down and survived.

159
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:30,988
Scott: I saw this.

160
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,262
Scott: Yeah.

161
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:32,028
Rym: Yup.

162
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:34,390
Rym: So, uh, spoilers, spoilers.

163
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:37,790
Rym: Uh, he did this on purpose.

164
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:39,910
Rym: He faked the engine trouble.

165
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:41,690
Rym: He crashed the plane on purpose.

166
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:44,230
Rym: This was a stunt for his YouTube channel.

167
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:45,636
Rym: And, uh, yup.

168
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:48,889
Rym: I'm going to read a quote.

169
00:10:49,512 --> 00:10:55,271
Rym: Before the FAA made its determination, obviously the FAA is fucking this guy over and deservedly so.

170
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:58,950
Rym: members of the aviation community were doubtful.

171
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:07,429
Rym: Jacob's video was genuine saying it was unusual that Jacob had brought a parachute with him on a routine flight and that he didn't try to land the plane.

172
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,990
Rym: Parachutes are typically only used by aerobatic pilots or those doing flight tests.

173
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:20,190
Rym: So yeah, not only did he crash his own plane on purpose as a stunt, but he did the most obvious crime.

174
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,730
Rym: Like I'm wearing a parachute for no reason.

175
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:24,690
Rym: Let me just get into my plane.

176
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:26,870
Rym: Oh no, the engine is broken.

177
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:29,769
Rym: Let me ignore all procedures and jump out of it.

178
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:32,150
Rym: And I happen to be live streaming the whole time.

179
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,290
Scott: I mean like, what do I know about flying?

180
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,540
Scott: Not much, but even that not much includes.

181
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:42,189
Scott: if the engine goes out, try to glide and make an emergency landing somewhere.

182
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,058
Rym: Yup.

183
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:53,050
Rym: Or honestly, for that kind of plane, because I have, log to my name, six hours of flight training total when I was in high school.

184
00:11:53,710 --> 00:12:06,396
Rym: But one of the things I learned in the STARBASE program and part of that thing was like the procedures, like we learned a lot of air procedures and for a plane like that, the first thing you do, if the engine goes out, try

185
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:10,080
Scott: to restart it most of the time, it'll just start back up.

186
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:10,642
Scott: Yeah.

187
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:17,010
Rym: So, uh, the sort of buried lead in the story, cause fuck this YouTuber guy.

188
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,410
Rym: This is why we all hate these YouTube personalities and this whole system.

189
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:34,810
Rym: But, uh, is that if you are gonna fake something in the modern era, even if you fake it really well, like you make deep fakes or do any like sort of nonsense, the metadata coupled with

190
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:35,894
Scott: nerds

191
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:46,148
Rym: who know a lot about this and are spending most of their time trolling around the internet looking for people to argue with are going to figure your shit out before the F dot dot organizations even think about you.

192
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,610
Scott: But also it is, if you're one of those other F organizations, right.

193
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:59,867
Scott: It's like, even if they hire those nerds, they might, well, they might not, you know, there might be more dysfunctional, but if it's the FAA, they're going to get you right.

194
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:04,240
Scott: The MCC, it's like, you could probably run a pirate radio and get away with it for a while.

195
00:13:04,436 --> 00:13:04,543
Scott: Right.

196
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,257
Scott: Yeah.

197
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,630
Scott: But, uh, I mean, there's some pirate radio.

198
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,670
Scott: Fly a plane without a license.

199
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:10,447
Scott: Like good luck.

200
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:11,419
Scott: It's like, right.

201
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:13,430
Scott: I won't be surprised.

202
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,968
Scott: I wouldn't be surprised that you shot you down.

203
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:15,948
Scott: If you tried that.

204
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:26,490
Rym: What's extra funny is this is randomly very close to the plot of a particular episode of Bob's burgers that a watch like a couple of weeks.

205
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,790
Scott: I know that show exists.

206
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,890
Scott: I've never seen any episode.

207
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:29,470
Rym: Randomly.

208
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,006
Rym: We started watching some episodes of it.

209
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:34,341
Scott: It's which streaming service.

210
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,970
Rym: it's on Hulu, which we have a free account on.

211
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:36,629
Scott: Okay.

212
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:38,490
Scott: I don't have a solution to anything.

213
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:52,730
Rym: All I'm going to say is this show, like after the first couple of seasons, it is not on the tier of plan image Simpsons, but it is on the tier of the late, like upper silver low gold age of the Simpsons.

214
00:13:53,154 --> 00:13:53,589
Rym: Like seasons.

215
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:58,646
Scott: I've heard people say that they like seasons eight, nine, 10, recognize the characters from it.

216
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:06,490
Rym: But I, you know, uh, we watched this episode where a pilot fakes a fakes engine trouble to try to get saw a woman to be impressed with him.

217
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,930
Rym: And, uh, yeah, you tubers, Bob's burgers had your number.

218
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,609
Rym: The Simpsons didn't even do that plot yet.

219
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:27,810
Scott: As far as I know, we got one more news, which is that, uh, of course next week begins the Stanley cup playoffs, which happens every year, but we don't usually talk about it.

220
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,770
Rym: Well, why, why haven't we talked about the Stanley cup a lot in a while?

221
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:36,949
Rym: Like what, what could have been going on in New York over the last several years where we were not super vocal about the Stanley cup.

222
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,510
Scott: Well, there was a, there was a pandemic, right?

223
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:41,450
Scott: That was one problem.

224
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:45,350
Scott: And problem two is even before then, uh, our team was not in the play.

225
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:53,070
Rym: We were, we were, if you don't watch hockey, the New York Rangers were in a process that is affectionately called rebuild, which basically means our team sucks.

226
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,989
Rym: We're going to get all new players and start over.

227
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:56,330
Scott: Oh yeah.

228
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,070
Scott: I guess this is like a well-known thing, but maybe not for the listener, but yeah, a few years ago, right?

229
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,523
Scott: So the Rangers were in the Stanley cup finals in like 2014, 15, right?

230
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:07,650
Scott: Which is probably the last time we talked to them.

231
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,230
Rym: And they did pretty well, but they weren't cup ready.

232
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,430
Rym: They were not cup team, right?

233
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,490
Scott: It's like they made it to the finals, but they weren't as good as the Kings and that's what happened.

234
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:16,750
Scott: Right.

235
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,089
Scott: But it was, it was pretty close even.

236
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:18,318
Scott: Right.

237
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,209
Scott: You know, it was like a lot of over times anyway.

238
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,090
Scott: Um, so anyway, then they went downhill.

239
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:25,330
Scott: It's like, they weren't as good.

240
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:29,145
Scott: They weren't making the playoffs for several years, you know, for, you know, the getting worse.

241
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:29,570
Scott: Right.

242
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:30,850
Scott: And then not making the playoffs.

243
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:33,510
Scott: So they sent a letter right to the fans.

244
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:41,890
Scott: Like, look, we, what it said in effect, what you can read the actual words online was like, look, we're not doing great.

245
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:46,250
Scott: We're going to have to tear it down and suck for a while and then get better.

246
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:46,767
Scott: Right.

247
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:49,909
Scott: And so that's exactly what they did.

248
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:54,990
Scott: And now just a few years later, we finally made it back to the playoffs.

249
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,470
Scott: So, uh, you know, that's, that's a thing that's great.

250
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:09,730
Scott: We're finally gonna, you know, it's been so long, 84 years since we got to go to a playoff game, which is, uh, if you haven't been is completely different from regular season.

251
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:11,690
Rym: It's different in so many ways.

252
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:17,470
Rym: Like you could do a game design like podcast just about playoff hockey versus regular hockey.

253
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,068
Scott: Right.

254
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,346
Scott: Well, the way I, the way I think I could describe it is like, okay, you have your house that you live in.

255
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:23,910
Scott: Right.

256
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:31,289
Scott: And when you come home from your wherever, your work, your school, wherever you go to, if you go anywhere, but wake up, I don't know.

257
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:34,390
Scott: Your house has a certain atmosphere to it, right?

258
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,190
Scott: It's right.

259
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,730
Scott: On most days, it's pretty similar because it's the same people.

260
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,890
Scott: They're doing the same things, right?

261
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:48,250
Scott: If you were to come home one day from work and there was like a massive barbecue party at your house, right?

262
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:51,129
Scott: It's still the same house you always come home to.

263
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:56,370
Scott: And your family is still there even, but the atmosphere is completely different.

264
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,889
Scott: It's like a different place, even though it's the same.

265
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,190
Rym: There's this like that electric energy, like you walk into your arena.

266
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:10,660
Rym: It doesn't matter what arena, even if you are like the shittiest, newest team, like a brand new arena, you walk into that arena and there's just an energy in the air.

267
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:11,744
Scott: Right.

268
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:25,589
Scott: So I learned some information because, uh, since, you know, the, uh, the times, I think when we started having enough money to buy hockey tickets, right, which are ludicrously expensive in New York, as you would expect, right.

269
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,086
Scott: We lived in some other place, like, I don't know, like in St.

270
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:35,469
Scott: Louis, we could probably afford blues season tickets, like several, I don't know what they charge, but it's got to be less than New York.

271
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:39,530
Scott: I think Toronto and Montreal, the only other really expensive ones.

272
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:47,030
Scott: But anyway, since we were able to have the very first time that we bought them, right, we only were buying a quarter season.

273
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:54,530
Scott: And that season I think was the last time we were in the playoffs and I would manage to get two tickets, like one playoff game.

274
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:55,307
Scott: And that was it.

275
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:56,669
Scott: And we didn't get very far.

276
00:17:57,591 --> 00:18:02,050
Scott: So since then we haven't been in, we just be going to regular season games.

277
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:05,070
Scott: This year was the first year where we have tickets.

278
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:11,370
Scott: We have a half season now because Rym got a lot more money and we got, uh, um, right.

279
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:12,309
Scott: And we're in the playoffs.

280
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:19,110
Scott: So, and they don't really publish the information online about like how playoff tickets work.

281
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:19,969
Scott: Right.

282
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:25,868
Scott: So I thought it'd be pretty interesting for everyone to, to get it inside of, if you had a pile of money, what it would be like.

283
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:30,390
Scott: So, uh, you know, you buy the season tickets, right?

284
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,230
Scott: You can buy full half or quarter.

285
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:34,902
Scott: If you buy quarter, it's not really like.

286
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:37,109
Scott: they don't really consider you like a season ticket member.

287
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:44,189
Rym: They just consider you like someone who bought a bunch of tickets, like buying a 10 trip on the end on the Metro North train instead of buying a monthly pass.

288
00:18:45,278 --> 00:18:45,530
Scott: Right.

289
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,787
Scott: If you buy a half or a full and an NHL season has, uh, 82 games.

290
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:56,090
Scott: So it's 41 home games plus a few pre-season games and they make you buy pre-season games.

291
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,149
Scott: You know, deal with it.

292
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:58,390
Scott: Right.

293
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,790
Rym: They take the third kind of energy in the arena.

294
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:03,130
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

295
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:03,708
Scott: It's empty.

296
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:04,890
Rym: It's empty and sad.

297
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:08,827
Rym: And it's full of tourists and people who are given free tickets by their season ticket holder friends.

298
00:19:09,953 --> 00:19:10,488
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

299
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,650
Scott: And if there isn't even like a t-shirt gun or anything, uh, no blue crew, no nothing.

300
00:19:15,878 --> 00:19:16,110
Scott: All right.

301
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:21,110
Scott: Anyway, um, so you, you buy either a full or a half season, right?

302
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,450
Scott: And then your team makes the playoffs.

303
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:23,930
Scott: Okay.

304
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:32,970
Scott: So at least I don't know how other teams are doing it, but the way Madison square garden does it is first, they probably go to the big sponsors and the big money people.

305
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:33,627
Scott: Right.

306
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:35,809
Scott: And they say, all right, these tickets are for you.

307
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:37,209
Scott: You got a luxury box.

308
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:38,470
Scott: Obviously there's no question.

309
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:40,550
Scott: You just have all the tickets for your luxury box.

310
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:45,330
Scott: You, Oh, if you don't realize this, this is true for pretty much every sporting arena.

311
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:48,830
Scott: Let's say you buy a luxury box because you're mega rich, right?

312
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:51,510
Scott: And the luxury box has, I don't know, eight seats in front.

313
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,710
Rym: You can't just bring eight friends to every game.

314
00:19:53,870 --> 00:20:00,750
Scott: It's not just like a little, you don't just get, you don't just magically get eight free tickets to every single event in Madison square garden.

315
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:04,910
Scott: You just have the right to purchase eight tickets to any event.

316
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,358
Scott: And you're buying the seats, right?

317
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,349
Scott: Nobody else can buy them from you.

318
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:14,429
Scott: It's like they can never sell out to someone else because they're only on sale to you.

319
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:18,490
Scott: But it's like, you have to buy them every, do you want to go to a concert?

320
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:18,970
Scott: Okay.

321
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,930
Scott: There's eight tickets with your name on them at all times, but they're not free.

322
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,170
Scott: So you got to buy them, right?

323
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,830
Scott: So those people don't have to worry.

324
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:35,850
Scott: So then the season ticket holders, the full season people, they get access to buy basically playoff tickets for their seats, right?

325
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,930
Scott: Do you want your seats for every home playoff game?

326
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,606
Scott: Yes or no.

327
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,530
Scott: If you say yes, you have two choices, right?

328
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,074
Scott: Full or pay by round.

329
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:47,478
Scott: full means.

330
00:20:47,658 --> 00:21:07,370
Scott: you buy the tickets to every conceivable could happen home postseason game, whether they're going to happen or not, you give them the full amount of money as if you're playing 20, you know, all, but you know, what's the maximum number for 16, 16 is the most possible games.

331
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,140
Scott: It could be right.

332
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:16,790
Scott: If you had home home ice advantage and you took it to seven games each round, don't necessarily happen, right?

333
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:20,070
Scott: And then they refund you for games that don't happen.

334
00:21:20,592 --> 00:21:23,890
Scott: If you do pay by round, then it's sort of the same thing.

335
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:25,890
Scott: It's just, you pay one round at a time.

336
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,490
Scott: And when the team wins and makes it to the next round, they charge you again.

337
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:36,849
Scott: And if games don't happen because the round ends early, like in a sweep, then they give you a refund of the games that didn't happen.

338
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:46,050
Scott: So because we have a half season, it was basically that, except they only, we only got half the games, right?

339
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:47,310
Scott: Half the conceivable.

340
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:48,526
Rym: I have a life in a game.

341
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,350
Rym: So a full season is like not feasible in my life.

342
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,687
Rym: That's too much hockey, even for me.

343
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,165
Scott: But who's going to go to right?

344
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:58,670
Scott: 41 games, right?

345
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,670
Rym: Us if we didn't have jobs and we're idly rich.

346
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,989
Scott: If I'm really old and I can afford it, then maybe, you know.

347
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:12,390
Scott: But anyway, so yeah, we got to buy our seats, the seats we always sit in for half of the conceivable home games.

348
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:19,687
Scott: And then they were like, all right, if you really want to go to the other half of the games, right, we'll let you buy that now, too.

349
00:22:20,271 --> 00:22:22,289
Scott: And there were slim pickings for that.

350
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:28,910
Scott: And then they did a presale for people who had chase credit cards, sponsorship deal.

351
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:36,510
Scott: Then they did an Internet presale, which they sent out a code, right, to use.

352
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:38,710
Scott: And then they did a general public sale.

353
00:22:38,851 --> 00:22:42,450
Scott: And it's like they were rolling these out in so many layers.

354
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:51,190
Scott: It was like, you know, but it's like they make, you know, depending on how well the team does, it's like, you know, they're making huge amounts of money.

355
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:55,170
Scott: Just, you know, it's like they when they get to the postseason, you have to pay the players anymore.

356
00:22:55,272 --> 00:22:55,969
Scott: You already paid them.

357
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,050
Scott: You only pay them for the regular season, right?

358
00:22:58,573 --> 00:23:00,070
Scott: Some of them might have bonuses or something.

359
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:10,290
Rym: Well, even worse, you know, the price of the tickets, the seats, the further deeper your gets into the playoffs, the prices rise exorbitantly.

360
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:11,610
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

361
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:17,428
Scott: So the regular season tickets we have are one hundred and twenty dollars per seat per game.

362
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:22,750
Scott: Right now, the the first round of the playoffs is a little bit more than that.

363
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,230
Scott: Right.

364
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:33,210
Scott: If we're in the Stanley Cup finals, the fourth round, the tickets are basically like five hundred dollars a game, which is obviously ridiculous.

365
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:42,910
Scott: But the Reese, if you were trying to buy those, like on the open market, it would be easily a thousand dollars plus per easily for if so.

366
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:55,587
Scott: It's like, of course, you know, even if I didn't have Rym to put up money, I still would have just bought all those tickets knowing that I could guaranteed make my money like I could just make my money back by selling them no matter what.

367
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,870
Rym: Yeah, because demand it's just the same reason why conventions sell out.

368
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:03,990
Rym: There's only so many seats you can physically put in a hockey or square garden.

369
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,970
Scott: Despite being, you know, it doesn't actually have as many seats as you imagine.

370
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:08,150
Scott: It's not like a football stadium.

371
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,270
Scott: There's like twenty to thirty.

372
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,850
Scott: You know, it's not a lot of seats because football you can sit so far away.

373
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,590
Rym: You can't see anything.

374
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,289
Rym: It doesn't actually matter that much for the capacity of Madison Square Garden is like twenty thousand.

375
00:24:21,511 --> 00:24:27,649
Scott: Anyway, see, I just wanted to share that, you know, even if you don't care, because that is not information that they like.

376
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:40,930
Scott: They don't publish like the full details of this stuff, like just publicly on their websites, you know, and I feel like, you know, that's something like, you know, even someone who's not interested in purchasing, but especially someone who is interested in purchasing.

377
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:45,370
Scott: It's like all that should be public information, like exactly how the fuck that works, right?

378
00:24:46,171 --> 00:24:49,850
Scott: Because you like you can get into it and not know what you're going to happen, right?

379
00:24:50,131 --> 00:24:51,150
Scott: They just spring it on you.

380
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,330
Scott: They're like, hey, tickets.

381
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:53,390
Scott: This is the deal right now.

382
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:54,049
Scott: Take it or leave it.

383
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,544
Scott: It's like, whoa.

384
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:57,490
Scott: Why didn't you tell me how this worked like months ago, right?

385
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,810
Rym: Because while Pax, for example, does spring on, hey, today's the day.

386
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,284
Rym: Go, go, go.

387
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,410
Rym: They explain the process in excruciating detail long in advance of the sudden day.

388
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,890
Scott: I think actually Pax could do a better job of explaining in detail.

389
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:15,690
Rym: So it looks like it's going to be Rangers Penguins in the first round and then Rangers.

390
00:25:16,152 --> 00:25:19,410
Scott: As of today, but it could be Rangers Caps still as a possibility.

391
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:21,970
Rym: But Rangers Carolina in the next round.

392
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,728
Scott: Well, that that would be bad.

393
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:25,130
Rym: That's that's what it's like.

394
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:25,550
Scott: Our hope.

395
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,730
Scott: Our hope is that it's Carolina and Boston beat the shit out of each other in the first round.

396
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:30,857
Scott: Yeah.

397
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:34,386
Scott: I don't think there's any chance Carolina loses, but they could get.

398
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:35,090
Scott: that would be well.

399
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:37,310
Scott: But it's like, you know, Boston's not easy for us.

400
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,008
Rym: Here's the danger.

401
00:25:38,591 --> 00:25:42,810
Rym: A Boston Bruins that somehow beats Carolina is going to be dangerous as shit.

402
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,240
Scott: Great.

403
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:43,586
Scott: Yeah.

404
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:51,910
Scott: But it's like if we can get to the second round, I think the only way we get out of the second round is if the team we face in the second round is, you know, beat up real bad.

405
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,710
Rym: Sweep the Penguins.

406
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:53,468
Rym: Take a break.

407
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,490
Rym: We hope it goes to Game 7.

408
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,257
Scott: That's like.

409
00:25:57,318 --> 00:26:00,270
Scott: our only way to the third round, I think, is that path.

410
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,650
Scott: But anyway, things of the day.

411
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,709
Rym: I got a real little thing.

412
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:26,518
Rym: This is a video of some film footage that was heavily restored just to make it look more real to avoid the phenomenon where old black and white things feel old timey to people and they lose sight of like the world was real back then and there were people like that.

413
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:32,169
Rym: It's easy to lose that context looking at black and white photos in the modern era or old grainy footage.

414
00:26:32,611 --> 00:26:43,770
Rym: But it's just footage of San Francisco Market Street end to end on the front of a trolley from nineteen oh six free.

415
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:46,629
Rym: I'm pretty sure that's before the big earthquake.

416
00:26:48,032 --> 00:26:51,369
Rym: Oh, shit, it's four days before the earthquake that destroyed all of this.

417
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:53,450
Rym: So that's neat.

418
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,270
Rym: It's like seeing Pompeii before it got destroyed.

419
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,050
Rym: But two, I share this video for one specific reason.

420
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:04,350
Rym: If you watch this footage, this is an era when cars barely worked.

421
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,290
Rym: Like cars went about as fast as Scott and I ride our bikes.

422
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:11,590
Scott: Yeah, Model T's, which were also death traps, right?

423
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:17,330
Rym: These are like cars that are not significantly faster than a horse drawn carriage.

424
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:18,750
Scott: And we're loud.

425
00:27:19,452 --> 00:27:30,910
Rym: And yet even that back then, when so few people had cars and cars were so slow, this footage, it is abundantly clear that cars are a ridiculous menace to society.

426
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:36,510
Rym: The few cars that people have are driving all over the road, cutting people off, almost hitting pedestrians.

427
00:27:36,912 --> 00:27:41,650
Rym: They cut off the trolley taking this footage two times in the first ten seconds.

428
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:54,370
Scott: But I mean, if you look at old news from around the time cars started becoming a thing, get an old newspaper at the library, there's plenty of like op-eds and articles of like, you know, cars terrorizing the streets, et cetera, et cetera.

429
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,669
Scott: Get these cars under control.

430
00:27:56,331 --> 00:28:08,930
Scott: And, you know, the decision to instead of ban the cars, but instead to remove everything else and give the car to the road, give the road to the car, destroyed the earth.

431
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:10,370
Rym: Oh, so I saw something interesting.

432
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,970
Scott: It was the direct cause of most of the problems in our society.

433
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,970
Rym: There are obviously nuances to what this group is doing.

434
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:21,070
Rym: And I'm just going to say that they are doing it and leave it at that.

435
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,110
Rym: But there is a climate activist group in Britain.

436
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,169
Rym: I saw some news today.

437
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:33,890
Rym: They are going to gas stations along major highways in Britain and breaking all the gas pumps and putting up anti-car slogans and leaving.

438
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:36,730
Rym: That's that's happening.

439
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,181
Scott: I think that's I think that's I don't know how.

440
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:42,570
Scott: I think that might be better than the SUV tire slashing people.

441
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,332
Rym: Yeah, there's.

442
00:28:43,352 --> 00:28:45,283
Rym: I think we're.

443
00:28:45,585 --> 00:28:46,490
Scott: I have to think about it.

444
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:53,370
Scott: All I'll say is that if climate change, as satisfying as it is, the the tire slashing is not hurts the wrong people.

445
00:28:53,953 --> 00:28:55,009
Rym: Yeah, is one problem.

446
00:28:55,594 --> 00:28:56,890
Scott: But there's got a lot of problems.

447
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,130
Scott: Yeah.

448
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:05,489
Rym: But we can also point out that climate change, if unaddressed, is a literally existential crisis to all of human society as we know it.

449
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,730
Rym: There is a point at which extreme increasingly drastic action is necessary.

450
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:11,330
Scott: Yeah.

451
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,469
Scott: Now, well, the time for that actually has passed.

452
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,850
Rym: We could have nipped this in the bud and banned these fucking cars from San Francisco.

453
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,250
Scott: Anyway, you know, you look at the science, right?

454
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,170
Scott: The time for for drastic action is already here.

455
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,318
Scott: Right.

456
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,450
Scott: It's been here for a while and we still haven't taken the drastic action.

457
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:33,730
Rym: So I mean, Al Gore was elected president and we could have started addressing it.

458
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:36,783
Rym: And then Supreme Court shenanigans and sort of.

459
00:29:36,863 --> 00:29:38,490
Scott: in this we're sort of in the zone, right?

460
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,450
Scott: It's like imagine you have a speeding train, right?

461
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,490
Scott: You pull the brakes like the emergency brake.

462
00:29:42,591 --> 00:29:43,013
Scott: It's still.

463
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:44,661
Scott: the train is going to stop 100 feet, 1000 feet, right?

464
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:48,886
Scott: It's like the train is maybe 500 feet away.

465
00:29:49,651 --> 00:29:50,669
Scott: It hasn't hit us yet.

466
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:54,330
Scott: But if we pull the emergency brake now, it's still going to hit us.

467
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,570
Scott: It's like there is no like we are going to get hit by the train.

468
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,949
Scott: It's like, would it be better even if the train is two feet away?

469
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,470
Scott: Pulling the emergency brake is still a good idea.

470
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:05,669
Scott: It'll hit us slightly less hard.

471
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:10,870
Scott: But yeah, it's like the train can't go in reverse.

472
00:30:11,134 --> 00:30:11,888
Scott: It's going to hit us.

473
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:20,349
Scott: And at every second we don't take the drastic action of pull the emergency brake increases the strength at which the train will hit us.

474
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:26,669
Scott: So that so don't go saying, oh, it's too late to do anything and be all defeatist.

475
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:28,821
Scott: Oh, there's just because it is too late to do anything.

476
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,889
Rym: There's a really good video I'll post in the forum just because I think it's worthwhile noting.

477
00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:38,889
Rym: It's a video that gets deep into sort of the strategy of the.

478
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:41,810
Rym: we shouldn't do anything about climate change people.

479
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,728
Rym: And they've moved on.

480
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,184
Rym: They were previously in the 70s, 80s.

481
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,350
Rym: They were focused on like denying that it was happening.

482
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:51,930
Rym: Then they then they moved when the science was irrefutable to focusing on.

483
00:30:52,332 --> 00:30:54,089
Rym: Well, it's happening, but humans aren't causing it.

484
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,410
Rym: And they kept moving to a different position to defend themselves.

485
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:12,430
Rym: That's how all these people who are defending not fair, regardless of which issue it is, where they have moved now increasingly, like over the last like one or two years is to the most dangerous possible territory of it's happening.

486
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,390
Rym: We're causing it, but it's too late to do anything.

487
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,110
Rym: Everything's fucked.

488
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,210
Rym: Everything's fucked forever.

489
00:31:17,535 --> 00:31:18,410
Rym: So don't bother.

490
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,290
Rym: It'll make your life worth for worse for nothing.

491
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:21,569
Rym: And that is not true.

492
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:25,367
Rym: But that is the current line that's starting to be spread by these conservatives.

493
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:31,050
Scott: Well, the truth of the truth there is, you know, the sad one.

494
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,030
Rym: Oh, we can't stop many of the effects.

495
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:34,270
Rym: They are already too late.

496
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:36,900
Scott: But there's a there's a truth there that is sad.

497
00:31:39,953 --> 00:31:40,770
Scott: Well, right.

498
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:41,468
Scott: It's sad.

499
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:41,851
Scott: Evil.

500
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:48,290
Scott: true is that for a lot of those people saying that, it's like they will actually just be dead.

501
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,330
Scott: They're very likely to just die of something else before it's a problem.

502
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,750
Rym: The people who are causing this are people who will die before it affects them.

503
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,058
Scott: Right.

504
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:02,168
Scott: It's like, yeah, the train is 500 feet away and you can pull the emergency brake to take less damage from it.

505
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:09,368
Scott: But I already if that person already knows that they're going to die from cancer or something before that happens.

506
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,170
Scott: Right.

507
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:16,709
Scott: So they are just a selfish fucking evil asshole who doesn't care about other human beings who will still be alive.

508
00:32:17,332 --> 00:32:19,970
Scott: And therefore they should have no say.

509
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:24,230
Scott: Let's not have a discussion about giving younger people greater say in government.

510
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:24,589
Scott: The end.

511
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,942
Scott: Let's go.

512
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:25,303
Scott: Yeah.

513
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:25,810
Rym: All right.

514
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:26,661
Rym: What do you got?

515
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,828
Scott: What do you think of the day?

516
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,749
Rym: It happens when we skip a show.

517
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:31,989
Rym: We got way too much bottled up.

518
00:32:32,682 --> 00:32:32,949
Scott: Yes.

519
00:32:33,092 --> 00:32:33,989
Scott: Anyway, thing of the day.

520
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:38,510
Scott: So we're going to do our main bit on handwriting penmanship.

521
00:32:39,052 --> 00:32:41,506
Scott: But nowadays that everyone types everything right.

522
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,730
Scott: Typography is the art of choice for everybody.

523
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:48,965
Scott: So Star Wars.

524
00:32:49,878 --> 00:32:50,090
Scott: Right.

525
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:55,590
Scott: You know, I've always noticed that, you know, Star Wars starts off with typography, that crawl.

526
00:32:55,902 --> 00:32:56,090
Scott: Right.

527
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,469
Scott: Everyone knows the crawl text going by.

528
00:32:59,052 --> 00:33:02,530
Scott: And, you know, I wasn't sure, like, am I just imagining it?

529
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:07,110
Scott: No, they definitely change the fonts in the different editions and releases and movies.

530
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:11,730
Scott: It wasn't all, you know, it's like my brain had that original font in there.

531
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:12,450
Scott: Right.

532
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,570
Scott: And then when I saw other Star Wars movies, I was like, I think they changed that font.

533
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:18,069
Scott: Sure enough, they did.

534
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:24,910
Scott: And you can learn all about that and more from this Twitter account, Star Wars fonts.

535
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:37,762
Scott: This person examines and identifies fonts, not just in Star Wars movies, but in like random Star Wars, merch, games, books, fucking any Star Wars thing that has typography on it.

536
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:39,309
Scott: They're looking at the fonts.

537
00:33:40,156 --> 00:33:41,210
Scott: It's pretty fascinating.

538
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:52,170
Scott: And this while, you know, while Twitter is in the news, this is an example of one of those things that pretty much only exists on Twitter.

539
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:53,909
Scott: It wouldn't work on a mastodon.

540
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,229
Scott: It wouldn't work.

541
00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:00,628
Scott: I guess it could work as a website with RSS, but the person who's making it isn't making a website with RSS.

542
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:08,969
Scott: So unless you can convince them to do so, it's like, you know, this kind of content is like, you know, Twitter is the only choice.

543
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,210
Scott: This is going to be on Facebook.

544
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:12,219
Scott: It's not going to be an Instagram like.

545
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,149
Scott: it's the only service that will have this kind of thing.

546
00:34:15,612 --> 00:34:17,728
Scott: So that's why it's a shame.

547
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:18,270
Scott: Yeah.

548
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,206
Scott: Twitter is in trouble.

549
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,429
Rym: In the moment, the GeekNights Book Club book is nine Fox Gambit, not eight.

550
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,105
Rym: Yeah, nine.

551
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,630
Scott: The listeners most requested book club book.

552
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,629
Scott: All right, listener, you're going to have your way.

553
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:33,329
Scott: We're going to do this sci fi book.

554
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:34,230
Scott: I've read it already.

555
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,109
Scott: I read it a while ago.

556
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:35,708
Scott: His room started.

557
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:36,467
Rym: I started it.

558
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,949
Rym: And all I got to say so far is formations.

559
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:41,110
Rym: It doesn't waste any time.

560
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,629
Rym: It does not waste any time.

561
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,652
Rym: It is not.

562
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:44,293
Rym: it is.

563
00:34:44,594 --> 00:34:51,254
Rym: it is like a brick wall is just right there that you slam into paragraph one.

564
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:52,167
Rym: I love it.

565
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:54,529
Rym: It's the same feeling I got reading that.

566
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:55,652
Rym: Actually, it's even.

567
00:34:56,355 --> 00:35:02,970
Rym: it feels denser in terms of like what is on a given page than even that first Prince of Nothing book we read.

568
00:35:04,692 --> 00:35:06,209
Rym: That's what I. that's what I'm going to say so far.

569
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,409
Rym: Well, we'll talk about it more after I get more than like one chapter in.

570
00:35:10,296 --> 00:35:10,748
Scott: Sure, sure.

571
00:35:10,931 --> 00:35:11,249
Scott: All right.

572
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:12,549
Scott: But yeah, that's the thing.

573
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:13,114
Scott: And when?

574
00:35:13,357 --> 00:35:14,570
Scott: what meta conventions?

575
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:15,007
Scott: None.

576
00:35:15,392 --> 00:35:16,150
Scott: None conventions.

577
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,010
Scott: No, nothing.

578
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,188
Scott: It's summer.

579
00:35:19,352 --> 00:35:20,729
Scott: Maybe because it's summer.

580
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:22,110
Scott: I am working on the website.

581
00:35:22,332 --> 00:35:24,590
Scott: I developed a really good search for the website.

582
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:31,710
Rym: It's going to so and we got a pretty good pipeline around making content in outdoor places that are not our apartments.

583
00:35:32,303 --> 00:35:32,428
Scott: Yeah.

584
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,625
Scott: Once it's warm outside, you know, it'll be safe to get together outside and make some content.

585
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,129
Scott: So that might or might not happen.

586
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:38,887
Scott: No promises.

587
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:39,468
Rym: Yep.

588
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:46,529
Rym: And otherwise, yeah, move right into it because we're going to see some people outside in the cold later.

589
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,070
Rym: Handwriting and penmanship.

590
00:35:50,674 --> 00:35:51,650
Rym: There's a lot to cover here.

591
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,949
Rym: We're going to mostly focus on our own thoughts and experiences.

592
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:59,450
Rym: But frankly, we are millennials, kind of older millennials.

593
00:35:59,831 --> 00:36:19,350
Rym: So we grew up in an era where at least I when I was in elementary school, I was taught like a method of learning how to write in proto cursive with the expectation that when I got into middle and high school, I was taught formal cursive and I was told by teachers all the way up through like 10th grade.

594
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:20,030
Rym: Yeah.

595
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,670
Rym: When you're an adult, you'll have to like write in cursive, like cursive.

596
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,849
Rym: You have to have good cursive to have a job.

597
00:36:25,214 --> 00:36:26,109
Rym: This is a part of your life.

598
00:36:26,511 --> 00:36:29,924
Rym: And then around 10th grade, my teachers were like cursive.

599
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:31,390
Rym: the fuck print everything.

600
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,349
Rym: If you write in cursive, I will not read your papers.

601
00:36:35,231 --> 00:36:58,030
Scott: Well, my story is similar, right, in that they were teaching us handwriting in elementary school and they were telling us, right, that like, you know, like as you get older, right, you're going to have to write in cursive and, you know, you're going to use paper with, you know, smaller line rules and you're going to you're going to have to write long papers and you're going to, you know, they were basically like scaring us about like the future.

602
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:58,549
Scott: Right.

603
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:01,290
Scott: But yeah.

604
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:09,627
Scott: And then I guess, you know, I guess around fifth grade was the first time that I submitted a paper and I typed it.

605
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,389
Rym: It was fifth grade for me, too.

606
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,469
Rym: I remember specifically.

607
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:16,690
Scott: I typed it on a school computer and printed it out of the Apple dot matrix printer.

608
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:16,939
Rym: Yep.

609
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:17,348
Rym: Same.

610
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:22,189
Rym: And and the funniest I just I just have a specific memory of I wrote this essay on the computer.

611
00:37:22,552 --> 00:37:25,590
Rym: It was about the book My Side of the Mountain, if I recall correctly.

612
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,309
Scott: And mine was about Galileo.

613
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:31,910
Rym: In fact, I remember that my mom has a copy of this essay.

614
00:37:31,991 --> 00:37:32,949
Rym: Still, I saw it.

615
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,590
Scott: I also used for that Galileo paper.

616
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:39,470
Scott: I used a CD-ROM encyclopedia to read about.

617
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:41,950
Scott: Oh, I did it all on the computer.

618
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:46,230
Rym: I brought the essay home after it got graded, so it had an A on it.

619
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:56,310
Rym: And I showed it to my grandpa, who at the time his career was still manually laying out metal type at the Macomb Daily, the newspaper in the town we lived in.

620
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:59,125
Scott: They didn't have an offset printer yet in the 90s or 80s.

621
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:01,170
Rym: And well, it was down.

622
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,614
Rym: He lived in.

623
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:03,270
Rym: it was like the town next to because we lived in Detroit.

624
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:08,785
Rym: And all he said, he looked at it and said, You just put my entire industry out of a job.

625
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,509
Rym: You can just do this yourself.

626
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:12,010
Rym: You're in what, fifth grade?

627
00:38:12,531 --> 00:38:13,210
Rym: That's amazing.

628
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:16,030
Rym: No one should ever have to do what I did ever again.

629
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:19,010
Rym: It killed all my friends because that type was made out of lead.

630
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,806
Rym: And a lot of people died.

631
00:38:23,112 --> 00:38:24,228
Scott: Way to go, grandpa.

632
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:25,708
Rym: My grandpa was pretty cool.

633
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:29,310
Scott: Yeah, you know, at least, you know, that's the right way to be a grandpa.

634
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,349
Scott: You don't want to be the grandpa.

635
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,628
Scott: That's like, all right, damn kids, you ruined me.

636
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:36,109
Scott: Yeah, he's like, oh, thanks for ruining me.

637
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:38,149
Scott: Like like sincere thanks.

638
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,230
Scott: Not not, you know, sarcastic thanks.

639
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,968
Rym: Yeah, I look for I would.

640
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:47,070
Rym: Automation has to lead to leisure, though, not to just even worse jobs.

641
00:38:47,132 --> 00:38:47,468
Rym: Of course.

642
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:48,950
Rym: But that's a conversation.

643
00:38:49,531 --> 00:38:53,130
Scott: My earliest handwriting memory was actually in second grade, right?

644
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,909
Scott: They gave us, I think, very.

645
00:38:55,536 --> 00:38:56,870
Scott: I don't remember that much, right?

646
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:57,670
Scott: Because the second grade.

647
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,138
Scott: But I do remember clearly.

648
00:39:00,198 --> 00:39:03,270
Scott: they gave us one of those, like a workbook for handwriting.

649
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:09,089
Scott: We're like in each page was a letter and you were supposed to write the letter repeatedly along the line.

650
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:09,750
Rym: Oh, my God.

651
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:10,349
Rym: We had those.

652
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,630
Rym: It was the Denelian workbook specifically.

653
00:39:13,071 --> 00:39:18,969
Scott: I don't know about if it was Denelian or not, but regardless, it was like, you know, write a bunch of A's, write a bunch of B's, et cetera.

654
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:19,348
Scott: Right.

655
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,509
Scott: So and it was one of those books you could write in the book and it smelled really fucking good because I love selling books.

656
00:39:25,651 --> 00:39:35,370
Scott: Anyway, so I get this book, they hand it to us and I'm like, ooh, and I immediately, immediately write all the letters and all the pages.

657
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:38,430
Scott: And I fill in the whole book, like in one shot, right?

658
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,389
Scott: Like, bam, like really quick.

659
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,264
Scott: Right.

660
00:39:41,932 --> 00:39:42,730
Scott: Little did I real.

661
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:47,110
Scott: And then the teacher is like, all right, today we're going to do a. I'm already like done with the book, basically.

662
00:39:47,378 --> 00:39:47,526
Scott: Right.

663
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:53,750
Scott: I'm like, oh, and like for twenty five more days, I presume.

664
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,950
Scott: I don't know how many more days maybe the book had print and cursive.

665
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:01,428
Scott: I don't remember, but our lowercase uppercase, it might have been a lot more days than I remember.

666
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:13,649
Scott: I just definitely remember sitting there quietly and awkwardly every day when everyone else was doing the handwriting book and I had already filled in the Z's on the first day.

667
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:23,090
Rym: My kid memory, which is from first grade, was we were learning Denelian, which is the precursor to cursive and like that one formal methodology.

668
00:40:23,611 --> 00:40:32,790
Rym: But I remember noticing that our teacher wrote in a much more elegant style of precursor when she was writing her own things like so.

669
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,170
Scott: Oh, yeah.

670
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:40,030
Scott: I definitely noticed that, like my mom writing in cursive, right, was like way different than the cursive they taught us in school.

671
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:44,630
Rym: So I particularly heard numbers because we learned numbers in cursive, too.

672
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:52,129
Rym: I remember just having this kid brain memory of that way to write the number two was way better than what was in our workbooks.

673
00:40:52,512 --> 00:40:55,649
Rym: So I wrote the way the teacher wrote it instead of the way the workbook wrote it.

674
00:40:56,391 --> 00:41:02,847
Rym: And at first I was given a bad grade and I appealed this to the teacher saying, but that's how you write it.

675
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:16,766
Rym: And in one of the only instances I can think of in my entire young childhood, a teacher actually listened to me, agreed, best teacher ever, changed the grade to an A and was totally cool with it.

676
00:41:17,912 --> 00:41:18,969
Scott: Best grade, best teacher.

677
00:41:19,673 --> 00:41:21,129
Rym: That too looked way better than the two.

678
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,550
Scott: So far we got story of best grandpa and best teacher.

679
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,490
Scott: It's like, let's keep going with other cool handwriting people.

680
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,938
Scott: But I remember what was funny is I?

681
00:41:29,379 --> 00:41:37,010
Rym: they taught us this precursive method specifically and they were very, very strict about forming the letters exactly perfectly.

682
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:38,970
Scott: Oh, wasn't this like Catholic school?

683
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,270
Rym: Oh, yeah, it was a Catholic school.

684
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:41,730
Scott: Oh, that explains everything.

685
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:47,129
Rym: In fact, left handed kids, this was in the 80s, but left handed kids were not allowed to use their left hand to write.

686
00:41:47,753 --> 00:41:49,229
Scott: Everything makes a lot more sense now.

687
00:41:50,835 --> 00:41:56,549
Rym: Yeah, also the cool teacher, one of the few teachers who was not a nun, she was just like some teacher they hired.

688
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:01,190
Rym: The nuns were not cool about this stuff generally.

689
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,730
Rym: No, except Sister Joan.

690
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:03,329
Rym: She was cool.

691
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:10,805
Rym: But so we're learning this method, but it was very apparent that nobody writes that way.

692
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,290
Rym: They either write in full cursive or they write in block print.

693
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:22,510
Scott: And yeah, my dad, my dad wrote in print, you know, and I noticed that as a kid, like my mom writes in cursive when she's and she's only like writing notes to herself or whatever.

694
00:42:22,891 --> 00:42:23,170
Scott: She doesn't.

695
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:30,290
Rym: I guess I guess I technically write in cursive when I'm writing notes to myself, but I defy any human to read them anyway.

696
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:32,478
Rym: But what I just?

697
00:42:32,498 --> 00:42:34,450
Rym: I just remember that they teach us this formal method.

698
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:38,130
Rym: But as a kid, I always noticed that nobody writes that way anywhere on earth.

699
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:45,529
Rym: And our school never actually taught us block printing, like actual block print, because there we did that.

700
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,427
Scott: We did that first before we did it.

701
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:53,870
Rym: I learned block print in middle school when I moved to public school and the public school.

702
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:59,346
Rym: people were like basically they increasingly were like, what is this didelian that you're writing in?

703
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,350
Rym: Just write in block print.

704
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,078
Rym: It's easier to read.

705
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:09,708
Scott: And after that, you know, I guess after the the, you know, the fifth grade, pretty much from then on.

706
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,020
Scott: Right.

707
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:12,470
Scott: It's like I might be writing some stuff.

708
00:43:12,681 --> 00:43:12,830
Scott: Right.

709
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:17,370
Scott: But like mostly I was typing anything that was, you know, text.

710
00:43:17,591 --> 00:43:21,550
Rym: So our schools required us to write essays in class in middle school.

711
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:23,370
Rym: So I wrote all my essays in cursive because.

712
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:23,950
Rym: Oh, yeah.

713
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,170
Scott: If I had to write an essay in class, I would write it in print.

714
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,910
Rym: But I hated that.

715
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:33,190
Rym: So what I usually do is fuck around and not work on the essay in school.

716
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:37,909
Rym: And then I just type the essay up at home and like bring it in the next day.

717
00:43:38,612 --> 00:43:40,790
Scott: No, but sometimes you'd have a test with an essay question.

718
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:41,206
Rym: Oh, yeah.

719
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:47,390
Rym: I just at that point, I hated writing because it hurt my hand to write a lot of.

720
00:43:47,531 --> 00:43:48,610
Scott: You were doing it the wrong way.

721
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:49,369
Scott: If it hurts your hand.

722
00:43:49,455 --> 00:43:49,670
Scott: Right.

723
00:43:49,931 --> 00:43:51,049
Scott: Yeah, I do it the wrong way, too.

724
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,009
Scott: It hurts my hand also.

725
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,390
Scott: All the artists and the people with good handwriting, they move their arm.

726
00:43:57,531 --> 00:43:59,150
Scott: I was just moving my wrist around wrist.

727
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:00,610
Rym: I was just moving my fingers.

728
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,225
Rym: I was writing also my fingers around.

729
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:03,368
Scott: Yeah, I'll do that.

730
00:44:03,491 --> 00:44:04,085
Scott: I'll do that, too.

731
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,609
Scott: What I the correct way is to move your arm around.

732
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,929
Rym: The reason of what I blame is I remember in elementary school, they didn't do this in middle school.

733
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,010
Rym: They gave every kid this little rubber like thing.

734
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:16,210
Scott: We had a triangle.

735
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:17,690
Rym: I had those and we had to put.

736
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,327
Rym: They wouldn't let us write unless it was on our pencils.

737
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,530
Rym: And as soon as I got out of that Catholic school, I threw that thing away.

738
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,250
Rym: I never used it again.

739
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:26,890
Rym: It was only it was causing.

740
00:44:27,611 --> 00:44:30,909
Scott: I mean, I tried them, you know, but they just didn't work for me.

741
00:44:31,137 --> 00:44:31,390
Scott: Right.

742
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,290
Scott: It's like I'm holding the thing the correct way.

743
00:44:34,351 --> 00:44:35,649
Scott: I'm just moving my arm the wrong way.

744
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:44,290
Scott: But yeah, it's like soon after, you know, it's like the only time I was writing anything was because I had to for school.

745
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:44,590
Scott: Right.

746
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:48,030
Scott: I wasn't writing anything on purpose until the Internet came around.

747
00:44:48,191 --> 00:44:54,268
Scott: And then I was writing a lot on purpose, you know, whether it was bullshit comments or blogs or whatever.

748
00:44:55,213 --> 00:44:56,889
Scott: But I was typing all those things.

749
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:04,690
Rym: Well, it was very noticeable even to me as a fifth grader that even with like formal cursive training and like I could write cursive really fast.

750
00:45:05,351 --> 00:45:11,970
Rym: Honestly, the reason I think it hurt my hand so much was that I tended to write like four or five times more in a given essay than like any other kid would.

751
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:13,549
Rym: But that was just me being a weird kid.

752
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:21,529
Rym: But even in fifth grade, having not yet even learned, like been taught typing, I could type faster than I could write.

753
00:45:22,271 --> 00:45:26,890
Rym: And that is what sealed all my opinions as a kid and why I wanted to talk.

754
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:33,390
Scott: I've talked about how I had the class, the typing class with the with the old lady with IBM computers, and then I became so good at typing.

755
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:35,167
Rym: So our typing class now.

756
00:45:35,511 --> 00:45:38,550
Scott: Now I usually win typing speed competitions against everybody.

757
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:42,688
Rym: We were pretty close when we just did that little quick typing thing in the Discord a while ago.

758
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,050
Rym: We were the same distance of each other.

759
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,630
Scott: But even my typing isn't perfect.

760
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:47,989
Scott: I never use the right shift key.

761
00:45:48,471 --> 00:45:50,889
Rym: I don't know why the right shift key is like the secret hack.

762
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,630
Scott: Minus probably has like two presses ever.

763
00:45:54,554 --> 00:45:55,690
Rym: Right shift is so good.

764
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:56,430
Scott: I just pressed it.

765
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,249
Scott: So that's probably like the third press, maybe.

766
00:46:00,234 --> 00:46:12,331
Rym: Yeah, the only the only the only thing I do that's not super legit is I tend to move my index fingers off of the official home row keys, the two with the little divots on them, F and J. I tend to.

767
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:17,650
Rym: I tend to, if I'm typing a lot, drift one to the right and hang out there.

768
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,750
Rym: Like I'm on G and K with my index fingers.

769
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:27,270
Rym: But what's funny is I type the same either way because I don't even picture the fact that a keyboard exists.

770
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,169
Rym: I think words.

771
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,301
Rym: My hands just pump them out.

772
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:31,670
Rym: the same way I see arrows.

773
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,810
Rym: My feet just move on the DDR mat.

774
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,010
Scott: Exactly.

775
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:36,830
Scott: Same thing with Vim, right?

776
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:43,610
Scott: It's like, you know, I don't think about H, J, you know, J, K, L, semicolon, like the letter that just move the thing around without thinking.

777
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:52,049
Rym: So the last time I wrote a significant amount of text with a pen or pencil that wasn't just notes I was taking for myself.

778
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,709
Rym: I remember the exact day.

779
00:46:54,213 --> 00:46:55,785
Rym: It was my first day at RIT.

780
00:46:57,571 --> 00:47:01,370
Rym: And they made me take one of those blue book tests for some bullshit English class.

781
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:02,169
Scott: I did one of those.

782
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:02,765
Scott: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:11,069
Rym: And this was decide if you had to take the basically high school English class or if you had to take the remedial English class.

784
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:14,070
Rym: And the test was like a really simple essay question.

785
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:14,769
Scott: I took that one.

786
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:14,918
Scott: Yep.

787
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:16,328
Rym: Every student had to take it.

788
00:47:16,811 --> 00:47:24,366
Rym: That was absolutely the last time I wrote more like a page or more by hand in my entire life.

789
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:30,292
Scott: I mean, the thing is, despite, you know, typing everything right, it's I actually always have.

790
00:47:30,332 --> 00:47:32,750
Scott: I have two notebooks, like paper notebooks on my desk.

791
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:36,690
Rym: I take notes faster with a pen and paper than I do with a laptop hands down.

792
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:40,050
Scott: One of them is for work notes and one of them is for not work.

793
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:41,058
Rym: I got a moleskine.

794
00:47:41,098 --> 00:47:42,450
Rym: I carry around work all the time.

795
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,850
Rym: I just I just page by page.

796
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:44,729
Rym: All my notes are in there.

797
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:49,201
Scott: It's like sometimes, you know, I could be writing down, you know, like whatever in there, right?

798
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:52,570
Scott: Just any absolutely anything I need to write down for any amount of time.

799
00:47:52,914 --> 00:47:54,050
Scott: You know, it's not organized.

800
00:47:54,211 --> 00:48:09,790
Scott: It's just like a space to put whatever, because no matter how good anyone makes all kinds of different little apps or post it notes on the desktop or, you know, just open up more VIM windows or Emacs org mode or, you know, any of these things that people have, right?

801
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:11,269
Scott: The obsidian note that I talked about.

802
00:48:11,691 --> 00:48:13,129
Scott: That's like I talked about that.

803
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:14,568
Rym: That might be the closest.

804
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:20,450
Scott: Well, that's good for notes that you want to keep organized and filed and recall later.

805
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:26,030
Rym: I will take my handwritten notes and type up summaries of them into other things later.

806
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:38,330
Scott: We're talking like, you know, write down an IP address, like see an IP address that you can't copy and paste or so easily write it down, you know, and then, you know, a minute later, type it back in again or stuff like that.

807
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:38,604
Scott: Right.

808
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:44,728
Scott: Anyway, so that's the kind of handwriting I've been doing other than like a few postcards here and there.

809
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:47,109
Scott: For a very long time.

810
00:48:47,672 --> 00:48:51,646
Scott: And my handwriting wasn't good to begin with because I did the handwriting book in two seconds.

811
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:55,430
Scott: Yeah, I typed everything since fifth grade.

812
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:00,189
Rym: My handwriting was extremely good up through fourth grade because the Catholic school, you know, I get hit.

813
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:07,810
Rym: But as soon as I could type, my handwriting got so bad that I kept failing handwriting classes in middle school because I never wrote anything anymore.

814
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,488
Scott: I didn't have handwriting class.

815
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,669
Scott: You know, it was part of English class.

816
00:49:11,872 --> 00:49:12,988
Rym: Like it was an aspect of it.

817
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:13,809
Scott: We did not have that.

818
00:49:15,772 --> 00:49:19,570
Scott: After the second grade handwriting book, there was no more handwriting instruction.

819
00:49:19,613 --> 00:49:19,826
Scott: Oh, wow.

820
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:26,009
Rym: It all through elementary school handwriting and well, it was called penmanship was a line item on our report cards.

821
00:49:27,571 --> 00:49:30,790
Scott: So another topic, right, is calligraphy.

822
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:37,229
Scott: So I didn't know calligraphy was a thing until like, you know, my mom was trying to do it for like maybe 10 minutes.

823
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:41,589
Scott: She got some calligraphy pens and some books and she, you know, she was trying to do it.

824
00:49:42,053 --> 00:49:43,329
Scott: And then I was like, oh, that looks fun.

825
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:44,910
Scott: Look, because I like pens.

826
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:48,630
Scott: We already did a show on pens, but like it was cool that the pens were slanty.

827
00:49:48,938 --> 00:49:49,170
Scott: Right.

828
00:49:49,491 --> 00:49:50,888
Scott: And it was fun to try to use them.

829
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:58,730
Scott: But, you know, I feel like calligraphy is now just for like people who do handwritten wedding invitations and shit like that.

830
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:02,870
Rym: I treat it like an art form, but not a practical method of writing a long form text.

831
00:50:03,683 --> 00:50:03,830
Scott: Yeah.

832
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:09,870
Scott: It's like because sometimes, you know, you want to create some text and there's no computer font.

833
00:50:10,031 --> 00:50:14,829
Scott: I'm sure there might be some fancy system you could use to get the, you know, to get it look right.

834
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:17,989
Scott: Just draw in Photoshop with a Wacom or something like that.

835
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:22,849
Scott: But, you know, you still need to have the art of your arm doing the calligraphy.

836
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:25,149
Scott: To make fancy texts.

837
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:26,290
Rym: Motherfucker.

838
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:30,110
Rym: So I have a random notepad, just like notes I was taking for work stuff.

839
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:33,250
Rym: And I'm just looking at it from a penmanship eye.

840
00:50:33,352 --> 00:50:34,230
Rym: And I noticed something.

841
00:50:34,953 --> 00:50:36,729
Rym: I have two kinds of writing that I do.

842
00:50:37,532 --> 00:50:42,390
Rym: If I if there's a sentence or like a note like like, oh, we got to deprecate that service.

843
00:50:42,612 --> 00:50:45,110
Rym: I write it in cursive, but it looks it's more like shorthand.

844
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:50,089
Rym: Like it's so barely formed and scribbly that I think only I could read it.

845
00:50:50,531 --> 00:50:54,810
Rym: But my printing, when I'm like making lists of things, I always do block printing.

846
00:50:55,292 --> 00:51:00,729
Rym: And I just noticed that about half my letters still have the fucking Devillian like tales hanging off the end.

847
00:51:02,651 --> 00:51:07,250
Scott: And so this whole thing came up because I read this blog post about penmanship.

848
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,490
Scott: You can read it yourself if you if you care.

849
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:09,762
Scott: Right.

850
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,350
Scott: It's not that great a blog post.

851
00:51:11,414 --> 00:51:11,524
Scott: Right.

852
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:15,249
Scott: But the two things I took away from the blog post for one.

853
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,190
Scott: Right.

854
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:20,410
Scott: Is that, you know, penmanship is like a form of communication.

855
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:20,710
Scott: Right.

856
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:27,689
Scott: It's like if you're doing notes for yourself, you're still communicating with your future self, but especially if it's for someone else to read.

857
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:28,170
Scott: Right.

858
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:43,850
Scott: It's like, you know, how frustrating is it to talk to someone who like can't like form proper sentences or how or someone, even if they're typing online, you can see the letters, but you can't quite get the meaning of what they're saying because the grammar is poor.

859
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:47,929
Rym: And to Bellas, I get the order sheets where someone had phoned in a big order that someone else took the notes down.

860
00:51:48,292 --> 00:51:49,262
Rym: I could never read anything.

861
00:51:49,282 --> 00:51:50,110
Rym: anyone else fucking wrote.

862
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:54,929
Scott: That's why we have Grubhub now where you can't get it wrong because they check boxes instead of typing words.

863
00:51:55,935 --> 00:51:56,990
Scott: But if it's a phone order.

864
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:57,246
Scott: Yeah.

865
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,689
Scott: It's like, you know, you have a hard time.

866
00:51:59,051 --> 00:52:07,010
Scott: So if you write something for someone else, another audience to read and it's not, you know, legible, it's like you're, you're failing at communication.

867
00:52:07,352 --> 00:52:10,330
Scott: So there's that, there's that aspect, which is like, oh yeah, that's right.

868
00:52:10,499 --> 00:52:10,585
Scott: Yeah.

869
00:52:10,691 --> 00:52:11,530
Scott: That's a thing, right?

870
00:52:11,951 --> 00:52:14,370
Scott: There's a second aspect, which is that it's like an art.

871
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,890
Scott: You think about like, you know, comic books have like letters, right?

872
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:26,810
Scott: Like, you know, uh, there's this huge crossover between like the worlds of like, you know, art comics and like architectural drafting, right?

873
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:29,969
Scott: Like a lot of people do more than one of the above, right?

874
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:35,830
Scott: And it's like, and lettering by hand, as opposed to typography, which is about printing, right?

875
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:41,729
Scott: Are like these completely different arts, even though they both involve setting text on a piece of paper.

876
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:42,330
Scott: Right.

877
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:45,209
Scott: Um, and so there's like that whole art to it.

878
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:54,510
Scott: You know, you think about fonts right on your computer, like choose the right one, but when it comes to your hand, it's like, you got every, you have infinity fonts in your hand, right?

879
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:56,010
Scott: Good luck, right?

880
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:59,170
Scott: Serifs don't exist really with handwriting, right?

881
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:06,148
Scott: It's not, you know, um, I mean, I guess you could, if you were really gonna draw all those little serifs on there, right?

882
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:07,307
Scott: You really want to.

883
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:17,890
Scott: Um, but he talked about in the blog post, how there's this, you know, basically there's this book that architects have, uh, which is like, sort of like the architect design textbook.

884
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:25,330
Scott: I imagine if you go to architecture school, you probably buy this thing, uh, when you start and you keep it forever, sort of like that one animator book.

885
00:53:25,691 --> 00:53:30,990
Scott: You know, or, uh, there's a few computer science books, like the SICP one, maybe, right?

886
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:31,666
Scott: There's a few of them.

887
00:53:32,452 --> 00:53:34,970
Scott: Um, and it's already in, it's like sixth edition, right?

888
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:42,130
Scott: And in that book, there is basically a whole section that teaches you to write and this particular font.

889
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:43,590
Scott: And it's like, Holy shit.

890
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:51,590
Scott: Like me not knowing anything about architects, but it's like, as soon as I saw the font, I was like, every architect writes in that font, every blueprint you've ever seen.

891
00:53:52,472 --> 00:53:54,750
Scott: It's like they're handwriting in that font, right?

892
00:53:54,991 --> 00:53:58,350
Scott: Architects obviously can all fucking draw cause that's their job, right?

893
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:04,169
Scott: Even if they use CAD these days, um, they can most all, almost all of them can draw on paper really well.

894
00:54:04,683 --> 00:54:04,850
Scott: Right.

895
00:54:05,031 --> 00:54:09,110
Scott: And they're all writing in that same way for a large number of reasons.

896
00:54:09,251 --> 00:54:11,810
Scott: And I was like, that's actually pretty cool.

897
00:54:12,033 --> 00:54:13,030
Scott: And it's really stylish.

898
00:54:13,191 --> 00:54:15,970
Scott: And like, if you wrote that way, it would be pretty cool.

899
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:17,290
Scott: Even if you weren't an architect.

900
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:24,114
Scott: So I ordered a old busted up used copy of that book, uh, for like a $4.

901
00:54:24,114 --> 00:54:25,128
Rym: I vaguely interested too.

902
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:29,506
Scott: Cause uh, yeah, cause I just want to read that section and you know, see what it has to say.

903
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:30,549
Scott: I don't care about the rest of it.

904
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:31,430
Scott: The architect part.

905
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:41,110
Rym: But in general, like a very important skill, even the computer error is to be able to, if necessary, writes probably in print, like just let cursive die unless you're doing.

906
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,410
Scott: This is like the architect font as a print font, right?

907
00:54:43,731 --> 00:54:49,628
Rym: It's like being able to write in block print legibly if and when you need to in a way that other people can read.

908
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:53,289
Rym: Very useful in case like something happens.

909
00:54:53,512 --> 00:54:54,809
Rym: The internet stops working.

910
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:56,369
Rym: Technology fails us.

911
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:59,470
Rym: Like it's a skill that is very human and very important.

912
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:10,590
Scott: I think the time in my life, practically speaking in my current life, the time that it matters the most, um, would be if I go back to the office, right?

913
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:27,650
Scott: Um, when I work with other people in person, very often when I'm explaining something to someone either on a whiteboard or even at my desk, right, I will be like, you know, drawing and writing, you know, like, like a live presentation.

914
00:55:27,932 --> 00:55:31,270
Scott: Like I don't have slides prepared, but I'm at to explain something to someone.

915
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,950
Rym: I've learned, I rarely write any words or letters on them.

916
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:36,529
Rym: I just use shapes because my handwriting is so bad.

917
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,610
Scott: I mostly use shapes, but sometimes I'll have to use words, right?

918
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:47,469
Scott: Like I'll write, I'll draw like a cylinder and I'll write like database, you know, but it's like it, you know, people can't read it.

919
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:48,012
Scott: So it's like.

920
00:55:48,253 --> 00:55:55,390
Scott: that is the area in which, you know, if I'm in person explaining things to people, probably at work, but possibly also other settings.

921
00:55:56,272 --> 00:55:58,810
Scott: And I use, I really like to use, you know, drawing.

922
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:05,030
Scott: I thought about actually making YouTube videos where I would hook up my iPad, which I can draw on with the magic pencil, right?

923
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:10,990
Scott: And sort of put the magic iPad and my face on the screen at the same time as a way to like, you know, treat it like a whiteboard.

924
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:11,810
Scott: And not bad.

925
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:16,550
Rym: Sadly, the best tool I've used for that digitally because I have the Wacom is mischief, but it's discontinued.

926
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:17,430
Rym: Like the company's gone.

927
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:28,570
Scott: I still have the software, but yeah, I could just have my, you know, record the video from the iPad, record the video from my face and OBS and, you know, whatever, um, you know, capture card from the iPad webcam from the computer, right?

928
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,830
Scott: All set or, or actual camera.

929
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:31,290
Scott: Right.

930
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:37,809
Scott: I got, it's very easy, but it's like, my handwriting is way too awful for that to actually be any good.

931
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:45,008
Scott: You go, you watch like some YouTube channels with like, um, the what's the math one number file.

932
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:45,488
Scott: Right.

933
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:50,870
Rym: I was about to say there's a bunch of, but yeah, they, they have like a number file on the ground paper and they're just like, exactly.

934
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:56,649
Scott: They give the person the giant roll of Brown paper and the Sharpie to, to, to deuce to teach you with.

935
00:56:56,796 --> 00:56:57,029
Scott: Right.

936
00:56:57,552 --> 00:56:59,550
Scott: And you can read what they're writing.

937
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:04,367
Scott: If I did that, even if I was very good at the math as you know, which never will happen in my whole life.

938
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:07,510
Rym: But as they were doing it about like the game design of Puerto Rico or like something, right.

939
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:17,608
Scott: If I was going to teach you, if I was going to be a number featured in a, a board game of filed computer file video, I'm not even smart enough for a computer file, which does exist.

940
00:57:17,731 --> 00:57:19,390
Scott: It's the same people making the channel.

941
00:57:19,852 --> 00:57:24,930
Scott: Like I could not write legibly enough on the Brown paper, even going slow, right.

942
00:57:25,335 --> 00:57:26,489
Scott: That it would be any good.

943
00:57:27,331 --> 00:57:29,890
Scott: So, uh, that's the thing, right?

944
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:33,990
Scott: It's, it's not a completely useless skill, even though it's now mostly useless.

945
00:57:35,283 --> 00:57:35,449
Rym: Yup.

946
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:41,866
Scott: It's uh, and it's a, and even if it's not used as a skill, it's very valuable as an art, right.

947
00:57:43,132 --> 00:57:46,010
Scott: Especially if you're making some sort of a comic books or something.

948
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:46,582
Scott: Right.

949
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:47,264
Rym: Yup.

950
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:48,449
Scott: Graphic novels.

951
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:53,630
Rym: But, uh, it is, and I'm just thinking about it.

952
00:57:53,750 --> 00:58:00,050
Rym: I don't really write anything now except notes and custom forms, customs, farms, diagrams, forms.

953
00:58:00,357 --> 00:58:00,421
Scott: Yup.

954
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:00,702
Scott: Yup.

955
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:00,916
Scott: Yup.

956
00:58:01,492 --> 00:58:03,210
Scott: I'm always really slow filling out forms.

957
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:07,510
Scott: Cause it's like, even if your handwriting sucks, you can do better just going slowly.

958
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:07,616
Scott: Yup.

959
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:08,367
Scott: No matter what.

960
00:58:09,232 --> 00:58:11,570
Rym: Um, so yeah, the forms got the little blocks.

961
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:13,609
Rym: You have to fit a letter in every individual block.

962
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:14,450
Scott: Yeah.

963
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,941
Scott: If I'm at like the DMV, I'm like, right.

964
00:58:19,111 --> 00:58:21,090
Scott: Trying to make sure I don't mess anything up.

965
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:23,730
Scott: Get a driver's license spelled, you know, Scott Robin or something.

966
00:58:24,611 --> 00:58:31,590
Rym: The other aspect of this that we can wrap up is, uh, signatures are generally written, at least in the West in cursive.

967
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:33,245
Scott: Mine is awful.

968
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:35,190
Rym: Who don't write in cursive.

969
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:39,069
Rym: They usually learn how to do their signature in some pseudo cursive.

970
00:58:39,771 --> 00:58:44,610
Rym: And Mike's signature is funny because it originally was my name just written very nicely.

971
00:58:45,072 --> 00:58:47,570
Scott: Every letter in cursive, but it's mine too.

972
00:58:47,912 --> 00:58:50,770
Rym: As time went on, I was writing it faster and faster and faster.

973
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:56,250
Rym: And I kind of go through the motions that would make the right letters, but very quickly.

974
00:58:56,931 --> 00:58:59,329
Rym: And it slowly transformed into a scribble.

975
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:03,150
Rym: And at this point it is just a scribble.

976
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:07,290
Scott: Like, yeah, but I would just write an X at some points, right?

977
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:08,110
Scott: Cause it doesn't really matter.

978
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:10,530
Rym: Especially like if I'm checking out and someone like wants a signature.

979
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:19,970
Scott: I have, I have a version of my signature stored in the Adobe fill and sign because most of the time I'm filling out digital forms and I drag it onto there.

980
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,170
Scott: So I look, it's the one that's in there is awful.

981
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:27,430
Scott: And I sort of felt like, you know, there are people who will like help you develop your signature.

982
00:59:27,511 --> 00:59:28,770
Scott: It's like, maybe I should try that.

983
00:59:28,871 --> 00:59:30,049
Scott: Like how much could that service go?

984
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,009
Rym: See, I went the other way.

985
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:40,170
Rym: I let mine get so bad that that squiggle is extremely consistent and extremely, like it is my signature.

986
00:59:40,332 --> 00:59:42,170
Rym: You can tell right away that's Rym signature.

987
00:59:42,552 --> 00:59:44,110
Scott: Mine looks up, but mine doesn't look good.

988
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:48,710
Scott: Mine looks like a, like a, like a, uh, like a wily coyote that an anvil fell on.

989
00:59:49,816 --> 00:59:50,550
Scott: It's not a good one.

990
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:56,350
Scott: It's like mine's got a little structure because it's like, I feel, I just wanted to make it more like artistically pleasing, right?

991
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:56,867
Scott: Aesthetically.

992
00:59:57,332 --> 01:00:00,268
Rym: See my squiggle is almost pleasing because it's like dah, dah, dah.

993
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:05,609
Rym: And then there's like a big stylized sort of D and then another dah, dah, dah after it.

994
01:00:06,031 --> 01:00:11,890
Rym: But for an unrelated reason, I looked up all the scans of all my driver's licenses over the years.

995
01:00:12,512 --> 01:00:16,510
Rym: That's fucking signature is just identical for all of this time.

996
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:18,363
Rym: That scribble is 100% consistent.

997
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:20,470
Rym: It is kind of shocking.

998
01:00:26,273 --> 01:00:28,390
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

999
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:33,530
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1000
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:38,950
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1001
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:41,870
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1002
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:46,629
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1003

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1004
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:54,450
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1005
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:57,570
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1006
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:08,109
Rym: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyce, Lynke Ege, Dredd, Lily Trennebrae, and a bunch of people who don't want me to say their names.

1007
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:25,090
Rym: Chris and Dodd, Chris Reimer, Clinton, Walton, Dex, Finn, Shaiai85, Rebecca Dunn, Review Matt, Bill34, Cowards, Sam Erickson, Shervin Van Horrel, Stop All The Downloading, Taylor Braum, the next station is Union, Union Station, and a bunch of people whose names I'm not going to say at their request.

1008
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:29,250
Rym: So yeah, pay attention to what's going on in Moldova right now.

1009
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:33,070
Rym: Breaking news since we recorded and then I finished the last bit.

1010
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:37,690
Rym: But things are getting spicier in the war and I don't mean in a good way.

1011
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:47,709
Rym: But anyway, stay safe out there and for now I simply leave you with... Lynn, should we be worried that our son is obsessed with a game where you just dress a cat and that's it?

1012
01:01:48,051 --> 01:01:48,796
Scott: I don't think so.

1013
01:01:49,078 --> 01:01:50,689
Scott: I mean, you get obsessed with things too.

1014
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,689
Scott: Remember when you got really into soap carving?

1015
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:55,610
Scott: Every soap in our house was shaped like a little duck, sort of.

1016
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:57,969
Rym: Yeah, but I get obsessed with interesting things.

1017
01:01:58,232 --> 01:01:58,710
Scott: Right, sure.

1018
01:01:58,790 --> 01:01:59,173
Scott: You know what?

1019
01:01:59,334 --> 01:02:01,310
Rym: Maybe I could help Gene with his microgreens project.

1020
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:02,395
Rym: Show him how fun it can be.

1021
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:05,070
Rym: I mean, we could have a mini farm in our apartment.

1022
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,110
Rym: Who wouldn't want a mini farm in their apartment?

1023
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:07,532
Rym: Me!

1024
01:02:07,713 --> 01:02:09,524
Scott: I don't want a bunch of mini animals in here.

1025
01:02:09,544 --> 01:02:10,410
Rym: This place would stink.

1026
01:02:10,673 --> 01:02:11,746
Rym: No, Lynn, that's not-.

1027
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:15,530
Rym: Anyway, my point is I think he's just too distracted by that cat game.

1028
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,541
Scott: Oh, a mini tractor could be fun though.

1029
01:02:17,742 --> 01:02:18,990
Scott: Tiny little haystacks.

1030
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:19,976
Rym: Yep, okay.

1031
01:02:20,198 --> 01:02:21,630
Rym: Well, I'm gonna go get water.

1032
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:22,697
Scott: Oh, get me some too.

1033
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,149
Rym: And a little snack, maybe a cookie.

1034
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:24,670
Rym: Sure.

1035
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:25,549
Scott: And some crackers.

1036
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:25,843
Scott: Really?

1037
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:27,942
Scott: Yeah, and cheese with the crackers.

1038
01:02:28,184 --> 01:02:29,070
Scott: And arrange it a little bit.

1039
01:02:30,131 --> 01:02:32,810
Rym: Gene, what are you doing out of bed with the laptop?

1040
01:02:33,131 --> 01:02:33,695
Scott: Oh, hey dad.

1041
01:02:33,735 --> 01:02:35,610
Scott: I'm just talking to some people on a perbo forum.

1042
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:38,429
Rym: Okay, what people are you talking to?

1043
01:02:38,691 --> 01:02:42,190
Scott: Perbo people are perbs as they call themselves, which is delightful.

1044
01:02:42,911 --> 01:02:48,550
Scott: Apparently there's a trick where if you press both buttons at the same time, perbo will cycle through all the outfits you've ever changed them into.

1045
01:02:48,971 --> 01:02:50,670
Rym: Wow, I did not know that.
