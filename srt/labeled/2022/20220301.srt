1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,449
Rym: It's Tuesday, March 1st, 2022.

2
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:09,590
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:13,197
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,685
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:18,000
Rym: Tonight we are talking about Offworld Trading Company.

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,780
Rym: A Stardock game from 2016.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,737
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:24,642 --> 00:00:26,679
Scott: Oh, we got a sudden, a sudden news.

9
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:27,856
Scott: Uh oh.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,220
Scott: They, uh, they signed the Bender guy for the Futurama show so that the Bendergate is over.

11
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:34,468
Rym: Pikachu face.

12
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:36,060
Rym: Like, I didn't expect that to happen.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,780
Rym: It was really clear that there were, like, ongoing negotiations that were not public as part of that conversation.

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,479
Scott: He's just trying to get paid and he deserves it because, uh, you know, people wouldn't be...

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,200
Rym: He's the voice of, it was, he's the voice of Jake and Bender.

16
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:58,200
Rym: And he did it so well that when I saw Futurama, I thought, that is the voice of Bender and nothing could ever change that for the rest of my life.

17
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:05,319
Rym: And then I saw Adventure Time and for half of the first episode, I thought, that's just Jake's voice, or that's just Bender's voice.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,780
Rym: And then it became Jake's voice permanently, instantly, and it was over.

19
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:11,858
Scott: He's got a really good voice, uh, you know.

20
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:14,320
Rym: Just talking.

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,740
Rym: Brad, I was worried as soon as you said, uh oh, breaking news because most breaking news in the last five days has not been great news.

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,059
Scott: That news is not for the shows, you know, that's for other things.

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,521
Rym: Yup.

24
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:38,900
Rym: So, uh, of course, we're not gonna cover it as news on GeekNights, especially not today on a Tuesday, because you should not be coming to us for news about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

25
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:45,239
Rym: This is uncharted territory, this is the largest land war in Europe since World War II.

26
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,700
Scott: I mean, there have been instances of invasions, uh, during, well, GeekNights existed.

27
00:01:52,641 --> 00:02:04,100
Rym: But never on this scale, with this level of escalation, it basically, within 24 hours of it starting, which was, weirdly, I remember we finished the bell show.

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:12,040
Scott: It was, yeah, all the previous invasions, at least, I mean, there were other ones, but, you know, the ones that make the news in the United States, at least, right?

29
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:19,380
Scott: So, uh, were always us, uh, just, you know, being imperialist and invading people for oil or other nonsense reasons.

30
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:25,820
Rym: Yup, I mean, uh, we, as a nation, invaded Iraq for literally no reason, not that long ago.

31
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,160
Scott: That's pretty much, you know, most of the wars that I've experienced in my life were of that variety.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,760
Rym: But, uh, I think what's interesting, and then we'll move on, because, again, go to experts to read about this, like, it is moving very rapidly.

33
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,439
Rym: Anything that you hear us even say is probably out of date by the time you listen to this.

34
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:52,500
Rym: Uh, but I guess it is very interesting to me that, one- Imagine how out of date they were in the newsreel times, right?

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,720
Scott: Watching Newsreel, it's like something that happened a month ago.

36
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:05,119
Rym: It's such a, it's a weird disconnect, like, you know, I was at work and, you know, I had a meeting and, uh, someone, like, the call starts, and someone just says, "Is there any news from the

37
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:05,400
Rym: front?".

38
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:15,762
Rym: And that was a perfectly legitimate question that I did not expect to hear in my daily life, like, with a person I was talking to in the year 2022.

39
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,999
Scott: I think only an old person would phrase it that way, though.

40
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,253
Rym: Uh, this was an older person, but not that old.

41
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:21,259
Rym: Not that old.

42
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:43,760
Rym: But, uh, I guess it's interesting that the CIA and the UK, all the intelligence organizations of the world kind of leaked what the plan was, and it seems like the intent was to leak Russia's plan so that maybe Russia would change their plan, or not go forward with this.

43
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:54,360
Rym: And instead, Russia seems to be, as a military power, following the plan that was leaked, regardless of the fact that half the things that were part of that plan didn't pan out.

44
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:57,565
Rym: And it's a real weird situation right now.

45
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:04,300
Rym: that's beyond what even most, like, geopolitical scholars expected as a worst-case scenario.

46
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,358
Scott: Alright, well, I mean, you know, if you just do what's expected, that's it, right?

47
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:14,648
Rym: But, uh, yeah, just pay attention to it.

48
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,459
Rym: I've tweeted at length about the fact that there is not actually a risk of a real nuclear war.

49
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:22,280
Scott: That seems unlikely.

50
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:33,300
Rym: It is extremely unlikely, but the thing I really want to point out, and I'm repeating this everywhere I have any amount of following, is that you're going to keep seeing the news talking about nuclear weapons and nuclear war.

51
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,389
Scott: The news loves to talk about anything.

52
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:37,740
Scott: that's, you know, not going to make you scared.

53
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:43,989
Scott: You're telling me that the same news is like, "It's 11, where's the fuck are your children?

54
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:49,440
Scott: Oh my god, you're going to go outside, there's going to be a person out there who's not white, they're going to kill you, stay

55
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:49,600
Scott: inside.".

56
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,319
Scott: It's like, you're telling me that news is stoking fears about nuclear war?

57
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:56,260
Scott: That same news, really?

58
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,779
Rym: This news that I've been using for these years, these clamps.

59
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:09,020
Rym: But I guess what I'll say is this, with nuclear weapons in particular, experts tend to use a lot of jargon when they talk about them.

60
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:25,160
Rym: So, actually, for real, innocuous news that happens to involve strategic, which is, you know, another jargon term for nuclear weapons, will make them sound far scarier or more dangerous than they actually are if you're uninformed.

61
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,620
Scott: So my advice to you- Not helping them yet, the same problem has a nuclear power.

62
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:29,445
Rym: Exactly.

63
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,580
Rym: Or even things like thermobaric weapons.

64
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,220
Rym: Like, I'm not saying thermobaric weapons are a humane thing to be used.

65
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,080
Rym: Like, do not think that I'm defending thermobaric weapons.

66
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,280
Rym: But thermobaric weapons are not materially beyond what non-thermobaric weapons are.

67
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:54,880
Rym: Like, the media will use these terms, but if you are not an expert, it is easy to get a lot more scared than you should be about things.

68
00:05:55,161 --> 00:06:01,340
Rym: And if you think, "Oh, I'll go follow experts," they know what's up, they're going to use jargon that's going to confuse and scare you even more.

69
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:11,540
Rym: So my advice is, one, if you're actually afraid of nuclear war, do not seek out the opinion of experts on nuclear war, because they're going to say things that are going to scare you for no reason.

70
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:16,620
Scott: And two- Yeah, like the people with their doomsday clock that's at, like, one second away from midnight or whatever.

71
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,800
Rym: Well, actually, the doomsday clock has made it very clear.

72
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,720
Rym: The nuclear threat is not why the clock is where it is.

73
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:23,439
Rym: It is solely because of climate change.

74
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:24,259
Scott: No.

75
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:39,560
Rym: Two, if you see news about nuclear anything, right now and for the foreseeable future, and you don't understand that news, do not retweet it or share it with other people or paraphrase it.

76
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,519
Rym: Let other people do that.

77
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,919
Rym: Because if you don't understand it, what are the odds that the people you share it to are going to understand it?

78
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:55,200
Rym: And a lot of the talking parts about nuclear weapons are extremely scary if you do not have a lot of weird knowledge that most people do not have and should not seek out, frankly.

79
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,300
Scott: The only nuclear weapon news you need to worry about is nukes coming at you right now.

80
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,740
Scott: And if that happens, which is extremely unlikely, again, it's, like, not going to happen.

81
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:13,140
Scott: If it does, your phone will let you the fuck know, the same way it lets you know when there's a hurricane or anything else.

82
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:31,680
Rym: Yep, and the only, like, the only thing that could happen in the news, short of a nuke going off, which, again, the odds are basically zero, like, for real, would be if NATO became directly involved with Russian forces, that is the thing that would change that conversation at all.

83
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:46,380
Rym: So anything that happens that does not include NATO actually, for real, fighting directly with Russian forces, then any news you see about nuclear weapons does not represent any material change in the situation related to nuclear weapons.

84
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:48,579
Rym: That's hard to internalize.

85
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,900
Scott: You're really helping this by, you know, mentioning the nuclear weapons, right?

86
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,040
Scott: You're sort of getting an old Streisand effect, right?

87
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,222
Scott: No,

88
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,313
Rym: you guys, it's a little, there's

89
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:56,919
Scott: a little bit of-

90
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:12,780
Rym: No, 'cause there's a little zebra storyteller of, you gotta almost inoculate yourself against if the news starts talking a big stupid game about it, to remember that unless one of these big things changed, the news is just talking about scarce stuff, it's not actually a material change.

91
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,300
Scott: Is the zebra storyteller the antidote for the Streisand effect or not?

92
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:30,800
Rym: It may or may not be, I don't know, but, uh, for real, this is a major ongoing conflict with minute-to-minute updates, and I guess the last thing I'll say is, you do not need to follow this second-by-second.

93
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,179
Rym: That does not help your psyche, 'cause you're not gonna, you're not gonna make any different decisions in your life.

94
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:43,139
Scott: If you're listening to this podcast, it's unlikely that you're in a position to do anything material to help in a significant way, right?

95
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:55,200
Scott: The only way you can help, you know, as a normal person who is listening to GeekNights is through collective action, and, uh, you know, contributing your part to a greater whole that might do something.

96
00:08:56,581 --> 00:09:02,740
Scott: So, if you want to do something, seek out such a collective action, otherwise, there's nothing you can do.

97
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:08,460
Rym: So yeah, uh, enough said about that, we're gonna move into the regular old GeekNights from this point.

98
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,940
Rym: And, uh, we'll start with, there was big gaming news that dropped kinda out of nowhere.

99
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:27,100
Scott: Uh, Pokemon, Scarlet, and Violet were announced, there was actually a real- It's surprising, 'cause it doesn't feel like the previous two main, you know, we're talking main Pokemon games, not side deals, right?

100
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,959
Scott: The Sword and Shield ones don't feel like they're that old, and we've already got another one coming up right in.

101
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:40,220
Scott: It's like, is this, I have to, I didn't look and see, but is this a normal time gap between main Pokemon games?

102
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:43,160
Scott: Or is it, or was it really shorter like it feels?

103
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:49,618
Rym: I mean, I haven't beaten a Pokemon game since Pearl, so I'm not really one to talk about.

104
00:09:50,220 --> 00:10:00,855
Scott: I do have to say, right, I beat Pokemon Red and Silver on cartridges back in the day, and I caught all the Pokemon, all of them, right?

105
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:01,879
Scott: Every single one.

106
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:06,460
Rym: Sure, Grandpa, no one can catch all the Pokemon now.

107
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:07,298
Scott: That's right.

108
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:12,478
Scott: After that, I think I skipped the Ruby, whatever it was, I don't know.

109
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:25,460
Scott: But basically, since then, I have bought a lot of, not side Pokemon, I've only bought a few side Pokemon games, but I bought a lot of the main Pokemon games, and I would get a few Gyms in and never beat them.

110
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:32,139
Scott: So, even though a lot of those games were great, and I had no complaints about them whatsoever, I just didn't end up beating them.

111
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,600
Scott: I didn't have the time for it, or they didn't keep my interest.

112
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:42,839
Scott: It's like I would play and play and play, and it would keep my interest, but then as soon as I saved and put it away, I'd forget about it, and I wouldn't go back to it.

113
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:46,080
Scott: So, I've learned my lesson, and I'm going to save myself.

114
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:48,919
Scott: I bought the Shield or Sword one.

115
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,547
Rym: Which were from 2019, so it's been a while.

116
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,959
Scott: Yeah, it has been a while.

117
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:58,880
Scott: I got a few Gyms in, and then I stopped playing, and I could go back to it, I guess.

118
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,440
Rym: So, I guess, what's noteworthy?

119
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,900
Scott: I learned my lesson, and even though this one, the new one, that Duck starter looks pretty good.

120
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,519
Scott: I like a duck.

121
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,960
Rym: Oh, that duck is the best one.

122
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:09,079
Rym: That's actually the one I would pick.

123
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:14,440
Rym: I almost always have gone with whatever the Grass starter is, and I would make an exception.

124
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:24,740
Scott: I mean, I would normally pick Grass because Green, and Grass is Green, but sometimes the Grass Pokemon, I just go with the coolest one or the cutest one.

125
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,394
Scott: I can't be going based on any other type business, right?

126
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:40,660
Scott: But anyway, if I hadn't learned my lesson, I would buy this and pick the duck, but I just learned my lesson, I'm not going to buy it, because I know that I'm just going to play a few Gyms and then stop.

127
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:45,900
Rym: So, I guess what's notable, it's open world, like that seems to be the evolution of mainline Pokemon games.

128
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,240
Scott: The new one, the Sword Shield one kind of is also a little bit.

129
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,880
Rym: Yep, but continuing with that, the open world, that aspect of Pokemon seems like it's going to be a long-standing thing now.

130
00:11:57,022 --> 00:12:02,920
Rym: Two, the puns and the names are Spanish-derived more so than English-derived.

131
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:18,639
Scott: Well, because every Pokemon game has a region that it takes place in, and that region is often a sort of imitation that is inspired by a real world location, like the Alola Pokemon was a Hawaiian one, right?

132
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:26,300
Rym: And I've seen Hispanic and Spanish-speaking and Spanish-adjacent gamers being very excited about this all over Twitter.

133
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:31,040
Scott: The new one they just announced is basically, yeah, it's Spain, it's Pokemon in Spain.

134
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:38,040
Scott: There's going to be bull Pokemon, probably, that are going to run, they're going full Spain.

135
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:41,339
Scott: So, we don't know much more.

136
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,859
Scott: Hopefully, without the Inquisition part.

137
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:54,580
Rym: So, for all the news, all we actually have to go on are a handful of statements, the images from the trailer, which is mostly a live-action skit that really buried the lead.

138
00:12:55,221 --> 00:13:04,040
Rym: Like, if you saw this trailer and didn't know it was the Pokemon trailer for two new mainline Pokemon games, you would not be sure what they were announcing until halfway through the trailer.

139
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:25,914
Scott: Not to talk about the war again, but it was confirmed by Nintendo, I believe, that they intentionally didn't do their full, they decreased the volume on the marketing because they weren't going to change their announcement date, but they decreased the volume on the marketing and instead of being like, "Holy crap, guys, Pokemon

140
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:26,197
Scott: Direct!"

141
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,356
Scott: They were just like, "Alright, Pokemon Direct, it's happening, here it

142
00:13:29,456 --> 00:13:29,537
Scott: is.".

143
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:38,493
Scott: Because there was an invasion going on and they don't want to be like, "Oh, yes, people are being murdered by an invading army.

144
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:39,496
Scott: Hey, come play

145
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:39,978
Scott: Pokemon!".

146
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:46,140
Rym: Like, when I talk, look at me on social media, a lot less just shitposting than usual.

147
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:51,680
Rym: I feel like a lot of people are dialing down the volume on anything they're doing with good cause.

148
00:13:55,162 --> 00:14:02,760
Rym: In some other news, the playdate continues to slowly gain adoption and interest.

149
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:08,824
Scott: We talked about the playdate a few times, the new handheld that's black and white and has a little crank on the side.

150
00:14:08,884 --> 00:14:14,780
Scott: that was crowdfunded and then it's been delayed a few times.

151
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:21,339
Scott: and they released a little tool on their website that lets you make games, but it's a really simple tool that can only make simple games.

152
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:28,687
Scott: We've been waiting for the real SDK that would let you make whatever the hell software you wanted and that was released yesterday.

153
00:14:28,787 --> 00:14:36,900
Scott: and I tested it out and made a little "Hello World" video game equivalent where you load a background, you load a sprite and you can move the sprite around with a d-pad.

154
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,280
Scott: and that took me longer to set up the dev environment than to write the program.

155
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,724
Scott: It took five minutes, right?

156
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,919
Scott: I just squiggled two PNG files in Photoshop and that was good to go.

157
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:53,640
Scott: So, yeah, this thing is, you know, the next step they say is they're actually going to deliver them.

158
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,739
Scott: I pre-ordered one so I'm going to get one and I'm working on, you know, I guess shit-talking about making a game for it.

159
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:08,260
Scott: I can't promise actually making a game for it unless you count my little "Hello World" as a game.

160
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,300
Rym: It's a fun, what I like about it the most is that this feels a lot like something we've talked about on GeekKnights before.

161
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:34,660
Rym: It's the equivalent of a graphing calculator in that it's the kind of device that's accessible enough to a designer or a coder to mess with, homebrew, and like learn basic principles to make something that'll work out of hardware that it's going to be a fantastic tool for hobbyists, for schools, for game design programs.

162
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,720
Rym: There's a lot of ways you can use this kind of device and I think it's really exciting.

163
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:55,860
Scott: You know, you've had a lot of these sort of fantasy consoles like the Pico 8 and whatnot where, you know, they create a video game console that never existed, just an imagined one and then they create an emulator for it and then you make games for it, but there are PC games, right?

164
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:59,011
Scott: You can't really run them on anything else too much.

165
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:01,379
Scott: Some things you can, but not, you know.

166
00:16:03,204 --> 00:16:05,140
Scott: But here, it's like they took it to the next level.

167
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:14,073
Scott: You know, programming for the play date is not really dissimilar from programming for the Pico 8 or any other similar simple fantasy console only.

168
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,000
Scott: It's a real console, right?

169
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:24,505
Scott: It's like, you know, it's a real physical thing that you're going to arrive at some point relatively soon and that's kind of cool.

170
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:30,926
Scott: We haven't had, I mean, there are people who can make a Game Boy game and make an NES game, right?

171
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:39,017
Scott: But programming for those platforms is either really difficult because you've got to do assembly or C or whatever.

172
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:50,040
Scott: there's not really advanced development tools or you use something like NES Maker which is pretty advanced actually, but it's a lot like using Game Maker, RPG Maker, right?

173
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,691
Scott: This is an actual console.

174
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:56,260
Scott: that's, you know, for the people, right?

175
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,920
Scott: But it's open and you can really make stuff for it, like 100%, just write a program in C and run it on there.

176
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:04,977
Scott: It's pretty great.

177
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,693
Rym: Alright, we can get into the main bit.

178
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:16,858
Rym: There's a thing about Switch 2 trending again because of an Nvidia leak but that's all like unconfirmed nonsense, so I'm not going to cover it.

179
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,742
Scott: That's nonsense.

180
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:21,179
Scott: Also, when is Nintendo included Nvidia hardware in their console?

181
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:21,921
Rym: Exactly.

182
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:28,138
Rym: Either this is radically misinterpreted or there's even bigger news that isn't confirmed yet.

183
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,540
Scott: But yeah, Nvidia did get some leakage.

184
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:34,487
Rym: But I'll cover that later.

185
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,180
Rym: I see a lot of conflicting discussion.

186
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:44,618
Scott: You can't trust news about leakages unless, you know, it has to be like that Nintendo one where they had all those assets and stuff, right?

187
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:48,039
Scott: Most leakage news you can't trust.

188
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:52,260
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

189
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,084
Rym: So check this out.

190
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:54,312
Rym: I ski.

191
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,660
Rym: It's one of my main hobbies.

192
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,813
Rym: And sometimes when you ski, you fall.

193
00:17:59,316 --> 00:17:59,980
Rym: You fall over.

194
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,818
Rym: Good reason not to ski.

195
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:04,390
Rym: Sometimes when you're on a bike, you fall over.

196
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,159
Rym: Sometimes when you're just walking, you fall over.

197
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:20,880
Rym: What I like about skiing is that if I say, bounce off of a tree, do a 360 vertically and land somewhere, and I'm on a bike, I'm usually bleeding from a couple of places and have like a busted rib or something.

198
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,539
Rym: But when that happens...

199
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,199
Scott: Because if that happens on a bike, you're probably landing on the hard ground, right?

200
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,779
Rym: The bike might land on top of you, which has happened to me before.

201
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,257
Rym: But skiing, if you fall over, you usually just fall into a bunch of snow.

202
00:18:42,062 --> 00:18:47,220
Rym: I fall down all the time skiing, and I almost never have even minor injuries from that compared to mountain biking.

203
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:55,660
Rym: But once, I was skiing on a trail called Bunny Buster, this really easy blue at Killington, but it was icy, shitty weather.

204
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:59,720
Rym: And I fell near the top of the trail, and I slid all the way down.

205
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,945
Rym: I couldn't stop myself.

206
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:03,540
Rym: I slid all the way down on ice to the bottom of the mountain.

207
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,858
Scott: Couldn't you just like, you have the ski poles, can't you just stick them in the ground?

208
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:10,640
Rym: In this case, the ski, the ground was basically solid ice.

209
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:13,520
Rym: It was a terrible day for skiing, I really shouldn't have even been there.

210
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,359
Scott: You couldn't just like scrape the ice, you had nothing pointy or whatever to like just create any amount of friction with the ice.

211
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,000
Rym: So I was able to slow myself down.

212
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,217
Rym: I didn't actually make it to the end end of the trail, I slid like always, and very slowly came to a stop.

213
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,199
Rym: And then luckily someone like kicked my skis down to me.

214
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:45,739
Rym: So this is a video of someone skiing and on a really easy looking black diamond, like just a long, wide, straight piste, but the snow doesn't look great, and they fell like I did that one time on the ice.

215
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:53,240
Rym: And they start sliding, but they keep sliding, and keep sliding faster and faster and faster.

216
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,999
Rym: They slid on their ass over a kilometer before they eventually crashed into a net.

217
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:04,479
Rym: They're totally fine, they get up, and they're like "ugh" at the end.

218
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,720
Rym: They had a GoPro on, you get to see the whole thing in glorious detail.

219
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:20,380
Scott: And to answer your earlier question, I feel like no matter how much of a ski device it is, I feel like with a whole kilometer of time, you've got to be something you can do to create some friction and at least stop.

220
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:29,359
Rym: So yes, there is a technique called the self-arrest that if you ski in those kinds of conditions, you are supposed to learn.

221
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:33,660
Rym: And this person clearly did not know how to do this at all.

222
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:42,499
Rym: It's one thing to slide down like a small blue trail somewhere on a mountain like in the east coast, but sliding a whole kilometer, this is like a case study in.

223
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:49,560
Rym: you should have learned this basic technique, you got way too far into your learnings, missing something fundamental.

224
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:51,518
Rym: So, uh...

225
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,020
Scott: Then again, there are some people who will, you know, pay to slide down, right?

226
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,599
Scott: I think it'll do some tubing or some sledding, so...

227
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,460
Rym: So there is a reason why pretty much every ski mountain on Earth bans tubes and sleds and any of those things, because they are considered...

228
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,219
Scott: Because you can't steer them.

229
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:07,660
Rym: Nope, they are what you would call...

230
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,017
Scott: Or control them.

231
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,940
Rym: ...uncontrolled devices.

232
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,979
Rym: And you can imagine exactly what that means.

233
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,200
Scott: If you're just going, there's nothing you can do about it.

234
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,780
Scott: You got to go one at a time, basically.

235
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:24,340
Rym: Like as a kid sledding, my main self-defense mechanism, if there was trouble, was to try to jump off of the sled.

236
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:25,791
Scott: Yeah, of course.

237
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,459
Scott: What else can you do?

238
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,780
Scott: The sled's doing what it's doing.

239
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,238
Scott: You can't really steer it that much.

240
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:38,060
Rym: So, uh, yeah, this is... You can watch someone slide on their ass over a kilometer down a mountain and crash into a net.

241
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:41,359
Rym: And it's funny because you know they're not hurt.

242
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,136
Scott: All right.

243
00:21:45,340 --> 00:22:00,679
Scott: So when I was in high school, right, I got the... I had money from working a part-time job and I was finally able to just go to... I had the ability, finally, to just go to fucking GameStop and buy video games or EB or whatever the hell store it was in those days.

244
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:05,660
Scott: And so the Game Boy Color came out and I was like, "You know what?

245
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,518
Scott: I'm just gonna go fucking buy that thing on release

246
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:07,720
Scott: day.".

247
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:08,739
Scott: And I fucking did it.

248
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:10,180
Rym: Man, I never had a Game Boy Color.

249
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:11,820
Scott: I had a Game Boy Color.

250
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,980
Scott: Then I had a Game Boy Advance.

251
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:13,765
Scott: You know.

252
00:22:14,196 --> 00:22:14,380
Scott: Anyway.

253
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,600
Scott: So now, rest in peace, portable Nintendo lineup, right?

254
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:22,679
Scott: Now it's just Switch, which is both at once all the way over.

255
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:23,712
Scott: Anyway.

256
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,280
Scott: So, and I got the Game Boy Color.

257
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,239
Scott: You know, it's like, "Well, I bought this.

258
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:37,236
Scott: I can play Game Boy games on it and I can get some of those DX games that work on Game Boys and Game Boy Colors, but I want to get some Game Boy Color only games because otherwise what's the

259
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:37,459
Scott: point?".

260
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:50,538
Scott: And the premiere game was Mario Brothers Deluxe, which was, you know, up until that point in time, if you're in 1990, whatever it was, I don't know what year, seven, eight, I don't know.

261
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:52,660
Scott: I'm guessing.

262
00:22:54,783 --> 00:23:05,118
Scott: It's like if you wanted to play Mario Brothers, Super Mario Brothers 1, you needed an NES or a PC with an emulator or something like that.

263
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:10,674
Scott: To play it portably, it's like, "Could I get a Game Boy that had Mario

264
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:11,056
Scott: Land?".

265
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:11,958
Scott: You know.

266
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:18,340
Scott: But you couldn't play Mario Brothers 1 portably on any device that existed, really.

267
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:28,595
Rym: I mean, it's like you could -- By the time we were in high school, if you got a moderately expensive laptop, you could theoretically run an NES emulator.

268
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:39,920
Rym: But I don't think you all really, unless you're as old as us, know what a laptop looked like, felt like, how much it weighed in that era.

269
00:23:41,782 --> 00:23:43,340
Rym: The Steam Deck is on Marvel.

270
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:43,780
Rym: Right.

271
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,236
Scott: So nowadays, I'm like, "HD remakes,

272
00:23:46,297 --> 00:23:46,599
Scott: meh.".

273
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Scott: But at that exact moment, this was the way to play Super Mario Brothers 1 portably.

274
00:23:54,384 --> 00:23:55,159
Scott: It was this game.

275
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,839
Scott: And the game not only had Mario 1, it also had Mario 2, meaning the real Mario 2, the lost levels -- Not Doki Doki Panic.

276
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:04,140
Scott: Right.

277
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:07,980
Scott: In color, on a small device, with a backlight.

278
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:12,773
Scott: The aspect ratio wasn't exactly the same as the original NES.

279
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:14,820
Scott: It was a little bit different.

280
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:17,660
Scott: But I couldn't tell the difference at the time.

281
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:20,316
Scott: It felt like I was playing Mario 1 straight up.

282
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,160
Scott: And it had a lot of -- It was pretty nice, actually, all things considered.

283
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,820
Scott: And it had extra features, one of those extra features being this little day planner.

284
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:37,575
Scott: They wanted to somehow be like, "Yeah, if you have this, it's also a

285
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:37,958
Scott: PDA.".

286
00:24:38,362 --> 00:24:43,399
Scott: And I guess if you had a Game Boy printer, you could print, and it had all this extra stuff in there.

287
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:48,079
Rym: Well, there was -- 'Cause Nintendo Power had a thing about it, and I was obsessed with it as a kid.

288
00:24:48,500 --> 00:25:00,660
Rym: There was that Game Boy PDA thing that was both a cartridge and, as far as I could tell, never actually released keyboard, specifically for the Game Boy to be a PDA for real.

289
00:25:01,382 --> 00:25:01,513
Scott: Yep.

290
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,438
Rym: Nintendo Power had a whole spread about it.

291
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,307
Scott: Yep.

292
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:16,740
Scott: So this Game Boy Color, though, they had some PDA-ish features in this game as, like, a side extra bonus thing, and there's actually -- If you go back, there's a lot of things like that.

293
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,559
Scott: You know, like, people seem to forget, like, the Wii just had a message calendar system in it and stuff, right?

294
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,838
Rym: It's like -- Yeah, the DS had PictoChat.

295
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:27,100
Scott: The Wii had a weather app in it, right?

296
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,958
Rym: It's like -- The regular DS had all this, like, local chat room stuff just built into it.

297
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:34,877
Scott: Yeah, the PictoChat, right?

298
00:25:34,897 --> 00:25:35,039
Scott: Yeah.

299
00:25:35,623 --> 00:25:48,300
Scott: So, anyway, there was PDA features in here, and there was this fortune-telling thing, and I guess if you wanted to see all the fortunes, you'd have to, like, open this game and check the fortunes, like, every day for a long period of time.

300
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,912
Scott: It's like, "No one did

301
00:25:48,952 --> 00:25:49,096
Scott: that.".

302
00:25:49,945 --> 00:26:04,760
Scott: But somebody here on my thing of the day basically broke the game apart, you know, went and inspected the ROM and found all the fortune-telling stuff and made a little app so that you could, you know, have your own little Mario Deluxe fortune thing.

303
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:05,820
Scott: I still have the cartridge.

304
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,680
Scott: I don't know where my Game Boy Color went to.

305
00:26:08,941 --> 00:26:09,899
Scott: I don't know what happened to it.

306
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:16,259
Scott: But I have the cartridge, and I can stick it in a GBA to run it and see and play it if I wanted to.

307
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:18,900
Scott: So, really fascinating.

308
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:23,260
Scott: Just look at this side feature in a game that was completely forgotten.

309
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,219
Rym: This is one of the beautiful things about the Internet.

310
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:34,919
Rym: Any aspect of anything, there will be at least one person who cares about it enough to do a deep dive on it and bring it to the world.

311
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:35,622
Scott: Right.

312
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:41,780
Scott: It's like, I had it, and I only remembered that it existed because this person, you know, posted this thing online.

313
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,428
Scott: I'm like, "All right.

314
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:43,440
Scott: That was in that game.

315
00:26:43,825 --> 00:26:44,251
Scott: I remember

316
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:44,454
Scott: now.".

317
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,780
Rym: Bowser's Breath engulfs the future.

318
00:26:48,702 --> 00:26:48,965
Scott: Yep.

319
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:50,139
Rym: There it is.

320
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:56,497
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book is "The City We Became" by N.K.

321
00:26:56,537 --> 00:26:56,900
Rym: Jemisin.

322
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,440
Scott: We're gonna do the show -- I finished reading it a while ago.

323
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:03,460
Scott: We're gonna -- I'm almost done reading.

324
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,471
Scott: That book, I've read 1.8 more books.

325
00:27:08,183 --> 00:27:10,079
Rym: We're gonna do a show about it in about a month.

326
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:12,399
Rym: You should easily be able to read this book by then.

327
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,059
Rym: I highly recommend you read it with us.

328
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:26,139
Rym: This book, if you have liked any of the books we have ever done on the GeekNights Book Club, especially the books where we say something like, "Wow, that was a real GeekNights-y book," you're gonna love the hell out of this book.

329
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:30,099
Scott: Anything else?

330
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:33,219
Rym: We'll see.

331
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,417
Rym: Convention's coming up.

332
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:45,679
Rym: There'll likely be at least one GeekNights panel at PAX East, but I doubt we will be at PAX East beyond potentially doing that panel, potentially just me, potentially just me and Scott for a day.

333
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,938
Rym: It's too soon to say.

334
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:49,795
Rym: Otherwise, I don't know.

335
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:50,300
Rym: We got nothing.

336
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,220
Rym: We're working on the website.

337
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,160
Rym: Well, Scott's mostly working on the website.

338
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:57,220
Rym: I'm working on some panel stuff for other cons that are online and virtual.

339
00:27:57,784 --> 00:27:59,020
Rym: You might see some of that coming out.

340
00:27:59,723 --> 00:28:08,119
Rym: In fact, you're gonna see an additional list of games for our Atari game design panel at some point in the near future that you can watch.

341
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,240
Rym: Otherwise, just, I don't know, keep following us.

342
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,078
Rym: I got nothing else new.

343
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:26,960
Scott: Once this website's done, then it's like I'm gonna be in this land of freedom where I won't have any obligation other than the job I have to make money and also maintaining life, right?

344
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:31,759
Scott: So sustaining myself with eating, cleaning, it's clothing myself, et cetera.

345
00:28:32,141 --> 00:28:38,480
Scott: So I'm not gonna give any specific shit talk, but I will be doing something with that time.

346
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:41,200
Scott: I don't know what it is, but something.

347
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:48,020
Scott: And maybe one of those things I do with that time will produce something to share with the rest of the world.

348
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,320
Rym: What you're saying is that you got a hopper and there's things in that hopper.

349
00:28:53,121 --> 00:28:54,249
Scott: Something might come out.

350
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:55,739
Scott: No promises.

351
00:28:58,204 --> 00:28:59,519
Rym: All right, let's just get right into it.

352
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,539
Rym: So this is a game from 2016 that we noticed and I pointed at.

353
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,699
Scott: I knew it existed, and I knew what the name of it was.

354
00:29:08,643 --> 00:29:10,339
Scott: And that was the extent of what I knew.

355
00:29:11,142 --> 00:29:13,260
Rym: We knew that it was Mule Adjacent.

356
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,820
Scott: I didn't know that until recently.

357
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:17,240
Rym: We talked about that.

358
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,519
Rym: I'm pretty sure there's a GeekNights episode where we mentioned it and said those exact words.

359
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:23,879
Scott: I don't think we've mentioned this game ever on GeekNights before.

360
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,860
Rym: Pretty sure we did it at some point, maybe in the forum.

361
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,500
Rym: Well, anyway, this game, we're a little late to the party, but we've actually started playing it.

362
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,619
Scott: A little late, six years late.

363
00:29:32,081 --> 00:29:33,050
Rym: It's still going strong.

364
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,878
Rym: It's had a bunch of DLC.

365
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,120
Rym: It's free for multiplayer on the Epic Games Store like right now, apparently.

366
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,279
Scott: Yeah, I bought a mega bundle of everything on Steam when it was a mega sale.

367
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:47,680
Scott: And I followed my policy of install it and play it immediately.

368
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,900
Scott: And the game is Offworld Trading Company.

369
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:57,000
Scott: And what it is, is it's on paper, it's sort of what I always kept asking for, almost.

370
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,979
Scott: It's like 90% of the way there.

371
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,777
Scott: And that it's an RTS.

372
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,340
Scott: We're talking StarCraft, we're talking Warcraft, right?

373
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,120
Scott: Except you don't have to micromanage dudes fighting at all.

374
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:10,640
Scott: There aren't any dudes to fight.

375
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,060
Scott: There's none of that whatsoever.

376
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:14,299
Rym: It's just build the base, the game.

377
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:25,160
Scott: It's you build the base, but then the base creates the resources on its own, just like you have peons making wood and stone in Warcraft, right?

378
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:36,280
Scott: But then, once you have those goods, you basically play a stock market game with them, well, a commodities market game with them, where you're buying and selling them, trying to make a lot of money.

379
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:44,240
Scott: And then when you have enough money, you can start buying shares in yourself and also the other players' companies.

380
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:49,319
Scott: And then if you buy enough shares in someone else's company, they're dead.

381
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:50,539
Scott: That's how you kill them.

382
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,520
Scott: And so buying shares is sort of like converting money into victory points in sort of board game terms, right?

383
00:30:57,381 --> 00:31:01,639
Scott: And once you bought everyone else out, you win and you play again, I guess.

384
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:08,202
Rym: And it's basically, if I had to describe how this game feels, imagine

385
00:31:08,504 --> 00:31:08,846
Rym: M.U.L.E.,

386
00:31:09,107 --> 00:31:11,720
Rym: a game that I'm pretty sure we did a GeekNights episode on, at least.

387
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:13,399
Scott: We should have.

388
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,219
Rym: Yeah, I'll check that.

389
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,501
Rym: M.U.L.E.

390
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:18,100
Scott: is a historic and very important significant game.

391
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,300
Rym: Yep, it's a game that we like.

392
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,279
Rym: We draw inspiration and ideas from.

393
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:23,299
Rym: It's like one of those-- So does everybody.

394
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,578
Scott: Everybody to us.

395
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,077
Rym: Right?

396
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:28,640
Rym: It's literally one of the forgotten masters out there, like Sopwith.

397
00:31:30,885 --> 00:31:35,923
Rym: So basically, it's like that, but scaled up and with a modern sensibility because that

398
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:36,345
Rym: M.U.L.E.,

399
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:40,360
Rym: as designed when it first came out, is a product of its era.

400
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:45,880
Rym: It has several aspects that are dated, that don't work that well, that are kind of arbitrary or random.

401
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,319
Scott: It also has a lot more luck going on.

402
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:48,979
Rym: It does.

403
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,420
Rym: Of World Trading does not have significant luck.

404
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,360
Rym: If you lose this game, it's because you are terrible at this game.

405
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,320
Scott: Or just not as good as the opponent.

406
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,416
Rym: Yep, this game is hard to be good at.

407
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,257
Scott: Yeah, very, yeah.

408
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:22,580
Rym: But what it feels like playing is, imagine an RTS, but the RTS is, like I said, build the base, but next to that is a whole ass stock market with like 15 different things you can make and trade, and they all have prices that are going up and down based on what all the other players are doing in the game.

409
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,160
Rym: It actually does act very closely like how a real stock market acts, or a real commodity market acts.

410
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:39,720
Scott: If I have a shit ton of iron, and I hold onto it, and no one else really has any, and there's a demand for it, people need it, they're going to start buying it, right?

411
00:32:40,081 --> 00:32:47,660
Scott: And the way the game is set up is so that there's never a situation where something's unavailable, right?

412
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,900
Scott: There's never, like, there is no more iron.

413
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:56,678
Scott: That doesn't happen, because there's this colony, and you can always buy and sell with the colony.

414
00:32:56,718 --> 00:32:57,600
Scott: that's not a player.

415
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,280
Rym: Basically, it acts like there's a market maker, if you know how capital markets work.

416
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,500
Scott: But the market maker has an infinite supply of all resources.

417
00:33:05,963 --> 00:33:12,158
Scott: They're just set a price, so you might not be able to access that infinite supply if you don't have enough money.

418
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,620
Scott: So if you want to buy iron, you can always buy iron, right?

419
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:22,920
Scott: But the price might be like $200 per iron, but you can get it, right?

420
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:34,940
Rym: But let's say the price of iron is $200, and I have a shit ton of iron from earlier in the game, and I sell it all, every time I sell even one piece of iron, the price of iron drops a tiny bit, because more entered the market.

421
00:33:35,502 --> 00:33:39,780
Scott: If someone buys an iron, you know, from the market, the price goes up.

422
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,000
Scott: You don't directly trade with other players.

423
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,920
Scott: All your exchanges are with the market, right?

424
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:51,679
Scott: You buy and sell your iron on the iron market, at the current market rate, whatever that is.

425
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:54,999
Scott: And every action you take changes that price.

426
00:33:55,961 --> 00:33:57,700
Scott: So, have fun.

427
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:14,699
Rym: Yep, so you interact, playing basically a real-time strategy game, building a base to get resources, and then buying and selling those resources on the market, and you have to mess with the market, because there is no possible way to make everything you need in this game.

428
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:22,679
Rym: You cannot be self-sufficient, because unlike most RTSs where you grow forever, you can only grow so much.

429
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:31,789
Rym: There's a finite number of buildings you can ever build with a little bit of plus or minus one based on events and things you can do in the game, but there's a limit.

430
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,460
Rym: You can only build so many things.

431
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:39,159
Rym: It's not like old Civ games where you can upgrade everything all the way, build as many cities as you want.

432
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,219
Rym: This game, you can only build so much.

433
00:34:41,963 --> 00:34:54,840
Scott: Right, so if the game was only about money, you know, it's like, well, you could just, you know, concentrate on what's worth a lot and just ignore, you know, what does it matter if I'm trading iron or steel or carbon or whatever, right?

434
00:34:54,900 --> 00:35:00,739
Scott: Well, it matters because you have a base, and that base has to be upgraded four times.

435
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,460
Scott: And to upgrade the base four times based on which faction you've chosen, you're going to need specific resources to do so.

436
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:18,420
Scott: So like with the really basic expansionist faction, in order to upgrade from level one to two, you need like a pile of steel and you need some glass, right?

437
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:20,240
Scott: And I think you need some aluminum.

438
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:25,000
Rym: But like another faction will need chips and steel instead of those.

439
00:35:26,145 --> 00:35:29,460
Scott: You need to get specific resources to upgrade.

440
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:49,130
Scott: So the beginning parts of the game are all about getting the resources you need to upgrade your base to the next level for the lowest price or producing them yourself, which is still an opportunity cost because you could be producing something else that's worth money, which is actually what matters, right?

441
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:58,860
Scott: But you have to upgrade if you, you know, so there's a rush to upgrade and sort of a snowball effect because like Rym said, you have a set number of claims, which is it's a hex map.

442
00:35:59,421 --> 00:36:05,529
Scott: So you can only build a number of buildings equal to the number of hexes that you have claims for.

443
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:07,140
Scott: You start with what, like three or four claims?

444
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,079
Scott: I forget how many, five?

445
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,840
Rym: Well, there's one faction gets an extra one and there's all sorts of nonsense.

446
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,829
Scott: But you only get so many claims and you build that many buildings and like.

447
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:16,419
Scott: that's it.

448
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,348
Scott: And you can't even to move.

449
00:36:18,408 --> 00:36:21,200
Scott: the claims is sometimes you just can't.

450
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:25,239
Scott: And like some of the factions can move, could move them a little bit.

451
00:36:25,565 --> 00:36:25,711
Rym: Yeah.

452
00:36:26,503 --> 00:36:28,960
Scott: A lot of the times, most of the time they're just permanent.

453
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,554
Scott: So it's like you lay down an iron mine.

454
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:35,760
Scott: It's like, yeah, you could destroy it and build something else in that spot.

455
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,280
Scott: But that's, you know, you can't move that claim to a different spot.

456
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:44,880
Scott: You can't, it's like if you suddenly want aluminum instead, it's like, well, there is no aluminum on that spot.

457
00:36:45,342 --> 00:36:47,640
Scott: You didn't use your claim on a spot that has aluminum.

458
00:36:48,182 --> 00:36:52,500
Scott: You can't build an aluminum mine until you upgrade and you get more spots.

459
00:36:53,222 --> 00:37:02,540
Scott: And then eventually once you get to level five, four and five, but mostly five, now the game, everyone's going to have, you're not going to have infinity slots, but you have a lot of slots.

460
00:37:02,783 --> 00:37:03,780
Scott: It's really flexible.

461
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,740
Scott: So then it becomes the game of actually try to eliminate the other people.

462
00:37:09,302 --> 00:37:09,605
Scott: Right.

463
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:10,758
Scott: You know, and such.

464
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,840
Rym: So the factions also have their own powers.

465
00:37:16,263 --> 00:37:21,000
Rym: Like each faction has radically different powers, a little bit like games like Dune in that they're radically symmetric.

466
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,060
Scott: Well, like, you know, Starcraft, Zerg, Protoss, humans, all different.

467
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,448
Rym: Exactly.

468
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:24,919
Rym: Just like an RTS.

469
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,212
Rym: So like there's some, there's basic resources.

470
00:37:28,252 --> 00:37:29,820
Rym: you can mine directly from the map.

471
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:33,080
Rym: And then there's derived resources like computer chips.

472
00:37:33,561 --> 00:37:39,680
Rym: You have to put other resources into something to even make that resource at all, or just buy it from the market.

473
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:49,040
Rym: And those resources will become more or less valuable, not just based on what the players are doing, but based on what the colony that you're all sharing the map with is doing.

474
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,779
Rym: As it grows, like it's slowly going to always need more and more food.

475
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:01,160
Rym: Uh, but depending on the details, it might also need a lot of chips or might need glass or might do all sorts of nonsense.

476
00:38:01,704 --> 00:38:03,200
Rym: And you kind of got to just watch this market.

477
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:09,220
Rym: There's also a direct violence aspect of this game.

478
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:13,099
Rym: There's something called the black market and you have your cash.

479
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:18,140
Rym: You have cash that you use, you sell resources, you get cash, you can buy resources.

480
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:26,320
Rym: You can even tell buildings, hey, if you need a resource, like you need iron because you're the building that makes steel, just buy the iron as you need it.

481
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,019
Rym: And the game will just start to automate all of that for you.

482
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:34,340
Scott: The game has a lot of quality of life features, right?

483
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:39,400
Scott: That allow you to like automatically sell, you know, this as it's produced, right?

484
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,830
Scott: Automatically, you know, oh, it's the building that upgrades.

485
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,560
Scott: things automatically upgrade constantly, right?

486
00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:52,600
Rym: Like you don't have to manually buy the resources necessary to like build a building.

487
00:38:53,122 --> 00:39:01,760
Rym: If you have enough cash and you build the building, the game will just automatically buy the right amount of resources with that cash at the current spot price on the market right then and there.

488
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:02,522
Scott: Yeah.

489
00:39:02,563 --> 00:39:09,780
Scott: It's like, you know, maybe in order to upgrade your base, you know, you need a thousand iron and you have zero iron and iron is a dollar.

490
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,078
Scott: It'll just tell you, hey, upgrading your base costs a thousand dollars.

491
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:20,299
Scott: Well, so tells you, and if you have a thousand dollars, you can just click upgrade base and it'll buy a thousand iron and upgrade the base.

492
00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:24,120
Rym: You can also interact with the black market with that cash.

493
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:31,880
Rym: If you have enough cash on an interval that is faster or slower, depending on a bunch of factors, you can buy things from this black market.

494
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:34,620
Rym: Some of these things are direct attacks on opponents.

495
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:42,920
Rym: Some of these things are things like go steal some resources from somewhere on the map or give up a claim to remove it somewhere else.

496
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:44,995
Rym: There's a bunch of different things there.

497
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:50,640
Rym: There's also a bunch of different maps that have different characteristics.

498
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,800
Rym: So when you start the game, a limited number of factions are available.

499
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,819
Rym: Not every faction is available in every game.

500
00:39:57,441 --> 00:40:00,120
Rym: A limited number of black market things are available.

501
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:07,599
Rym: Like every player sees what are the seven things that are even capable of being bought on the black market for this entire game.

502
00:40:09,504 --> 00:40:11,340
Rym: And you kind of have to navigate.

503
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:18,540
Rym: It's almost like it sets up the play box and then all the players know everything and have to make decisions accordingly.

504
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,519
Rym: There's very little real randomness to it.

505
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,340
Scott: Well, it is randomness in the setup, right?

506
00:40:26,401 --> 00:40:28,280
Scott: But not randomness per player.

507
00:40:29,144 --> 00:40:44,880
Scott: I really like that because if you look at a game like Starcraft, even if you take Starcraft and you remove the thing I hate the most, which is the micromanaging the soldiers, it's still a game where you're like, "I play Zerg no matter what the map is.

508
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:51,628
Scott: I'm a Zerg person and I've memorized the specific build order and 90% of the time it varies a little

509
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:51,929
Scott: bit.".

510
00:40:54,781 --> 00:40:56,919
Scott: But you're pretty much sticking to it.

511
00:40:57,604 --> 00:40:59,620
Scott: You've determined that that's the optimal path.

512
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,300
Scott: Build this building, then this building, then this building, and so forth.

513
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,359
Scott: And it's all executing this set plan.

514
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:16,916
Scott: And there isn't a lot of decision making that happens during the game until the mid or late game when it's like, "All right, what did they

515
00:41:16,956 --> 00:41:17,117
Scott: do?".

516
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:19,478
Scott: Little rock, paper, scissors going on.

517
00:41:20,404 --> 00:41:22,420
Scott: And also the execution component with the micro.

518
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:26,799
Scott: In Offworld Trading Company, you start, you see the map.

519
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,418
Scott: Okay, you see which resources are plentiful and which ones aren't, and it's different every time.

520
00:41:32,162 --> 00:41:35,679
Scott: And then you see what's available in the black market, which is different every time.

521
00:41:36,262 --> 00:41:38,539
Scott: And you see which factions you have to choose from.

522
00:41:38,881 --> 00:41:42,820
Scott: There's only four in each, but there's more than four in the whole game.

523
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,640
Rym: Like we were playing multiplayer the other night.

524
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,920
Rym: I'm only good at, well good, I'm making quotes here.

525
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:52,080
Rym: I am only minimally proficient in one of the four factions.

526
00:41:52,562 --> 00:41:55,960
Scott: And if that faction just might not be available that game.

527
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,140
Rym: And it just wasn't in the first game we played.

528
00:41:58,621 --> 00:42:00,151
Rym: And I did not do well.

529
00:42:01,097 --> 00:42:01,560
Rym: It was a problem.

530
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:09,240
Scott: So now you have to decide based on the map what the black market is and what factions are available.

531
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:11,359
Scott: Which faction do you choose?

532
00:42:11,922 --> 00:42:14,460
Scott: Where do you start on the map, right?

533
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:21,060
Scott: And then if you're not the first person to start, you now also have additional information of, well, they chose that faction.

534
00:42:21,764 --> 00:42:24,360
Scott: Should I change my mind about which one I was going to choose?

535
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,560
Rym: And the default way multiplayer works is real fun.

536
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,120
Rym: Because single player against all AIs does this differently.

537
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,780
Rym: But with multiplayer, there's debt.

538
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,819
Rym: And we'll talk about debt in a minute, because debt is a huge fascinating part of this game.

539
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:41,919
Rym: Debt has caused many funny things to happen when we played this multiplayer.

540
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:43,910
Rym: Not just to you.

541
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:44,354
Rym: I hit D12.

542
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:49,400
Rym: My credit rating was pretty naturally bad.

543
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:51,137
Rym: And my stock price was approaching zero.

544
00:42:52,641 --> 00:43:01,999
Rym: So basically, the earlier you play, so everyone's looking at the map, and there's an amount of debt, and it's very high.

545
00:43:02,642 --> 00:43:10,820
Rym: And as you're watching, that amount of debt is slowly ticking down and getting closer and closer and closer from a horribly negative number to zero.

546
00:43:11,981 --> 00:43:22,580
Scott: As soon as you click... So this is like, it's interesting because you could just start playing immediately, which would give you a head start and first pick of your location.

547
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,700
Rym: And you start with a D credit rating and a ton of debt.

548
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,040
Scott: Your debt is enormous if you do that.

549
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,540
Scott: So what really it's doing is, it's like, you're not going to start that early.

550
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,219
Scott: You're just not.

551
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:39,898
Scott: So you're giving everyone time to look at the map and see what's going on.

552
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:46,860
Scott: And then by the time you're done looking, now maybe you'll start thinking about actually clicking.

553
00:43:47,403 --> 00:43:56,100
Scott: And it's a pretty clever way to start the game immediately, but also give you time and not just favoring someone who clicks the fastest.

554
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:03,740
Rym: But it also handles directly the situation that a lot of games where you have a starting position have, where some positions are just better.

555
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:14,880
Rym: So when we played this multiplayer the other night, in two different games, once it happened to me and once it happened to Scott, two players were looking at the exact same spot.

556
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,739
Rym: You can't see what anyone else is doing until they click.

557
00:44:17,224 --> 00:44:18,400
Rym: We're just looking, looking, looking.

558
00:44:19,601 --> 00:44:26,239
Rym: I'm hovering over a spot and I see the debt counter gets to a point where I think, all right, I could deal with that debt.

559
00:44:26,702 --> 00:44:28,740
Rym: I click and a base appears.

560
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:34,060
Rym: And I realize in that second that our friend Chris had in fact placed the base there.

561
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,474
Rym: He clicked frames before me.

562
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:37,960
Scott: Same exact moment.

563
00:44:38,682 --> 00:44:42,240
Scott: I also had a situation where I clicked to put a base and it was like, nope.

564
00:44:42,443 --> 00:44:43,339
Scott: And I'm like, what do you mean, no?

565
00:44:43,461 --> 00:44:44,439
Scott: I'm like, click, click, click.

566
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,340
Scott: It's like someone, other base just comes out and it's like the exact same moment.

567
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:55,479
Scott: You couldn't, like, if it had landed a few seconds earlier, like even two seconds earlier, I would have been like, I wouldn't have clicked my mouse.

568
00:44:55,768 --> 00:44:55,956
Rym: Yup.

569
00:44:56,282 --> 00:44:57,840
Scott: And I would, I would have been like, oh, okay.

570
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,840
Scott: They took more debt, but literally the same second.

571
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:02,137
Scott: It was like, come on.

572
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,220
Rym: But it's such a fun mechanic because the longer you wait, the better off your start is, but potentially.

573
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:14,360
Scott: Well, not if you don't get the good, you've got to weigh that against getting the good spot on the map.

574
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:22,460
Scott: And not only the good spot on the map, but if you go down earlier, you start producing goods and getting your way on your way to upgrading to level two.

575
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,219
Scott: Other people's bases haven't even landed yet.

576
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,280
Rym: So one of the games I won, I started, you're doing nothing.

577
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:35,580
Rym: I started way earlier than everyone else and I had a ton of debt, but I had two steel mills operational before another player even laid their base.

578
00:45:35,908 --> 00:45:36,300
Scott: And I won.

579
00:45:36,602 --> 00:45:36,800
Scott: Exactly.

580
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:38,479
Rym: So there was something going on there.

581
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,620
Rym: So let's talk about debt because this is sort of the fascinating part of this game.

582
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:53,459
Rym: And this is how the quality of life of the, like how all these different quality of life features of the game work together so well to remove a lot of the annoying pain of most RTSs.

583
00:45:54,322 --> 00:45:55,180
Rym: The game has the market.

584
00:45:55,801 --> 00:46:07,660
Rym: And if you are buying things automatically that must be bought, like energy, for example, power, your debt's just racking up in the background.

585
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,978
Rym: It's not taking away from your cash.

586
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,258
Scott: If you don't have any money for it.

587
00:46:10,581 --> 00:46:10,702
Scott: Yup.

588
00:46:11,026 --> 00:46:12,079
Rym: But it just racks up debt.

589
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,420
Rym: Debt might be fine.

590
00:46:15,282 --> 00:46:19,400
Rym: You can have a bunch of debt, but your debt, one, there'll be interest.

591
00:46:20,021 --> 00:46:26,440
Rym: And the worse your credit rating is, the worse the interest will be on the debt, regardless of the number of the debt.

592
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:33,639
Rym: Your credit rating is determined by how bad your debt is relative to the other players.

593
00:46:35,703 --> 00:46:36,880
Rym: There's a few other factors.

594
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:43,000
Rym: It's actually a fairly complex market, but you don't really need to know those details unless you decide to try to go pro with this game.

595
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:49,960
Scott: The point is a lot of debt ruins your stock price and makes it easy for other people to buy you out and eliminate you from the game.

596
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:56,400
Rym: And if your debt's too bad, if you have a de-credit rating, you can't even buy shit from the black market anymore.

597
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,900
Rym: So the cool part about debt is you can accrue debt on purpose.

598
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:05,599
Rym: You can pay debt off as you feel like it.

599
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:07,960
Rym: It's just one more mechanic in the game.

600
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:14,060
Rym: The only things you cannot go into debt for are you cannot buy something from the black market with debt.

601
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:14,818
Rym: You gotta use cash.

602
00:47:15,422 --> 00:47:20,400
Rym: And you cannot buy any resource except power via debt.

603
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:26,420
Rym: If you need iron and you don't have any cash, you can't buy iron by going into debt.

604
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,000
Rym: Your buildings that need iron just fucking stop working.

605
00:47:30,122 --> 00:47:30,806
Scott: Yup.

606
00:47:30,987 --> 00:47:33,140
Scott: You could sell something else and then buy iron.

607
00:47:33,901 --> 00:47:34,585
Rym: Yup.

608
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:37,840
Rym: So you're usually trying to make a machine where like I make a bunch of food.

609
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,460
Rym: I sell that food to afford the iron because I couldn't get any iron.

610
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,809
Rym: Use the iron to make steel.

611
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,060
Rym: I sell the steel for a profit.

612
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,280
Rym: Like you're trying to make a fairly complex supply chain and market for yourself.

613
00:47:49,200 --> 00:48:00,700
Scott: There are some resources that you make because they're just worth a lot of money and what it takes to produce them doesn't cost as much as what you get for selling them.

614
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,759
Scott: And that's just business.

615
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,472
Scott: And there are some resources where it's like power.

616
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:12,160
Scott: It's like if I don't build a power plant, then I'm going to have to buy power from the market constantly.

617
00:48:12,381 --> 00:48:17,200
Rym: And I've played games where for various reasons the price of power skyrockets.

618
00:48:17,721 --> 00:48:22,440
Rym: And if you don't have enough power generation, you're losing like a thousand dollars a second.

619
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:22,581
Rym: Right.

620
00:48:23,024 --> 00:48:25,560
Scott: It's like the price of power might tank to like a dollar.

621
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:27,560
Scott: And you're like, oh, I'll just turn off my power plants.

622
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,273
Scott: You just buy power from the market and use debt for it or whatever.

623
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,219
Scott: And who cares?

624
00:48:32,682 --> 00:48:35,019
Scott: But then suddenly the price of power goes way up.

625
00:48:35,562 --> 00:48:38,059
Scott: And remember the claims are locked in.

626
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:50,100
Scott: If you don't have a claim on a spot that's good for a power plant or an unused claim, suddenly your debt starts going up because you have buildings and those buildings are operating and they need power.

627
00:48:50,622 --> 00:48:55,100
Scott: So it's like you're in the market to buy resources to run your buildings.

628
00:48:55,521 --> 00:49:02,560
Scott: And hopefully what comes out the other end of those buildings is worth more than what goes into them at all times to some extent.

629
00:49:03,361 --> 00:49:13,760
Rym: So one other aspect of the game, which is the final like core game mechanic other than victory, is there are five special buildings that do a bunch of different stuff.

630
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:21,080
Rym: And they take the game from being fairly simplistic into being an infinite sea of human decision making.

631
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,280
Scott: There's a patent lab that lets you get special abilities.

632
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,400
Scott: There's an upgrade building that just lets you upgrade and make other buildings better.

633
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,340
Rym: Both of those require potions, basically like chemicals as fuel to work.

634
00:49:34,442 --> 00:49:37,580
Scott: There's one that's the hacker array that lets you manipulate the market.

635
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:38,948
Rym: Drive the prices up or down.

636
00:49:40,825 --> 00:49:43,020
Scott: Just fake the market, at least temporarily.

637
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,480
Scott: There's the off world trade here, right, which is where the game gets its name from.

638
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:55,360
Scott: It's basically a rocket launch pad that gives you access to a second market for all the resources that has different prices.

639
00:49:55,621 --> 00:50:01,340
Scott: because you're selling them, you know, you're basically putting, it's like, oh, iron isn't worth anything on this planet.

640
00:50:01,822 --> 00:50:05,260
Scott: Let me put my iron in a rocket and sell it to another planet.

641
00:50:05,721 --> 00:50:12,160
Scott: And, you know, you got to check the off world market because it's off world trading company and see what the off world prices are.

642
00:50:12,422 --> 00:50:14,360
Scott: They're going to be different than the local prices.

643
00:50:14,981 --> 00:50:21,760
Scott: And you can make a lot of money and it just continuously firing rockets as long as you can keep fueling them and whatnot.

644
00:50:22,046 --> 00:50:22,297
Rym: Yep.

645
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:25,860
Scott: So say the last one is the pleasure dome.

646
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,537
Scott: I wonder what happens in there.

647
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:29,579
Scott: Pleasure dome is just pleasure.

648
00:50:29,941 --> 00:50:30,360
Rym: Print money.

649
00:50:31,402 --> 00:50:33,740
Scott: Yeah, you build pleasure domes and they make money.

650
00:50:34,442 --> 00:50:42,160
Scott: You build them next to the habitats in the colony and if people visit them and you just get free money and it's a way to win.

651
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,959
Scott: If you get a lot of pleasure domes, you can make a lot of money and win that way.

652
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:51,340
Rym: And then the final mechanic, the way you actually win, like the hit points of you as a player is the stock market.

653
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,880
Rym: Your goal is literally to have enough cash to buy out all the other players and own them as subsidiaries.

654
00:50:57,642 --> 00:50:58,624
Scott: All that other stuff.

655
00:50:58,684 --> 00:51:04,920
Scott: It's like you're getting resources to upgrade your base and then you're upgrading your base so that you can build a machine that makes money.

656
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:12,340
Scott: And you're building a machine that makes money so that you can buy everyone else's shares until you own all the companies on this planet.

657
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:14,279
Scott: You have a monopoly and then you win.

658
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:14,709
Rym: Yep.

659
00:51:16,284 --> 00:51:18,439
Rym: It's real direct and straightforward and fun.

660
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:26,500
Rym: And if someone gets knocked out of the game, their faction just keeps running and you can still buy shares in it and just collect profits from it.

661
00:51:27,091 --> 00:51:27,520
Rym: Basically.

662
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:30,513
Scott: And they are mercifully.

663
00:51:30,594 --> 00:51:31,600
Scott: They don't have to keep playing.

664
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,420
Scott: It's like if you tank at this game real bad, it's a lot like Age of Steam.

665
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,271
Scott: Someone will just buy all your shares and you're eliminated and you can go do something else.

666
00:51:40,311 --> 00:51:42,418
Scott: Go eat a snack or go home.

667
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:43,452
Scott: Yep.

668
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,359
Scott: Or whatever.

669
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:51,340
Rym: But much like Civilization as well, when the game ends, you get a million charts.

670
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:53,140
Rym: Everything that happened in the game.

671
00:51:53,221 --> 00:51:55,600
Rym: Like you see the full story of how it went down.

672
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,839
Rym: Look at the market over time.

673
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,780
Rym: Look at who was attacking who.

674
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:02,300
Rym: Like, oh, it was Rym who was buying all those EMPs the whole time.

675
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:02,856
Rym: There's proof.

676
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,699
Scott: So, let's see.

677
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,200
Scott: Good things about this game.

678
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:08,678
Scott: Obviously, I already said it's an RTS.

679
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,059
Scott: We don't have to micromanage dudes.

680
00:52:10,202 --> 00:52:10,699
Scott: That's great.

681
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:10,991
Rym: Yep.

682
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:15,100
Scott: It's also, you know, I love stock market thing.

683
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,878
Scott: I love how it's like really board gamey.

684
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,320
Rym: The stock market feels like I'm playing a complex board game.

685
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,418
Rym: Like it's just really fun.

686
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,319
Scott: Unfortunately, it just feels like a board game that's, you know, doesn't have turns and it's going really too fast.

687
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,218
Rym: We're not good at this game.

688
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,239
Scott: No, I'm awful at this game.

689
00:52:31,841 --> 00:52:38,558
Scott: And despite, you know, it has all those quality of life features automatically by turning, you know, automatically do this.

690
00:52:39,071 --> 00:52:39,260
Scott: Right.

691
00:52:39,641 --> 00:52:44,376
Scott: You really, once you get the keyboard shortcuts down, you understand the really good user interface.

692
00:52:46,181 --> 00:52:49,700
Scott: It's like you never feel like there's no hassles or busy work.

693
00:52:49,826 --> 00:52:50,020
Scott: Right.

694
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:54,280
Scott: Everything you're doing is like some sort of, you know, real decision that matters.

695
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,840
Rym: Every click is material.

696
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,940
Rym: And APM could even matter up to a point, but not to the degree of like a Starcraft.

697
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:05,039
Scott: No, it is knowing that it matters at all.

698
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,697
Scott: But regardless, it's way better than the other options.

699
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,800
Rym: Let's say the price of glass is skyrocketing.

700
00:53:11,203 --> 00:53:13,460
Rym: And let's say me and Scott both have a shit ton of glass.

701
00:53:13,863 --> 00:53:15,340
Rym: We're playing real time chicken.

702
00:53:15,701 --> 00:53:21,794
Rym: Who sells all their fucking glass first, captures those profits and ruins the market for the other one.

703
00:53:22,602 --> 00:53:22,958
Scott: Exactly.

704
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,076
Scott: Because if I have 100 glass and I just sell it all, it's like, well, the price just goes down.

705
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,497
Scott: And now if Rym tries to sell his, he's getting less money for his same amount of glass than I got.

706
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:35,460
Rym: So the challenges with this game, like I really like it.

707
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:37,059
Rym: I'm going to keep playing the shit out of it.

708
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,160
Scott: I would like to try to get better at it because.

709
00:53:39,728 --> 00:53:39,880
Scott: Right.

710
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,940
Scott: So the place we're at now in this game is like skill wise.

711
00:53:44,463 --> 00:53:46,839
Scott: You know, I don't want to give two strategy tips because I don't have any.

712
00:53:47,664 --> 00:53:48,699
Rym: I could like to the spreadsheet.

713
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:49,716
Scott: Yeah.

714
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:56,720
Scott: In single player, when I play against the AI at the normal difficulty, I can beat it pretty reliably.

715
00:53:57,341 --> 00:54:03,259
Scott: But when you play single player, you have the ability to pause the game so you can just pause and think about what you're going to do.

716
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,280
Scott: It's like you're about to upgrade.

717
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:04,900
Scott: You're like, pause.

718
00:54:04,981 --> 00:54:06,199
Scott: Where am I going to put my claims?

719
00:54:06,821 --> 00:54:07,879
Scott: I'm going to go there, there and there.

720
00:54:08,004 --> 00:54:08,338
Scott: All right.

721
00:54:08,761 --> 00:54:11,040
Scott: And you unpause and put the claims and really quick.

722
00:54:11,241 --> 00:54:12,999
Scott: And it's like, it's not an issue.

723
00:54:13,702 --> 00:54:18,540
Scott: But when you play multiplayer, there is no pause at all at the game.

724
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,160
Scott: It just has a speed that's too fast for a slow old guy.

725
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,100
Scott: And it's like, I cannot keep up with it.

726
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:30,180
Scott: Like I'll upgrade my base and be like, uh, uh, uh, I mean, every time I go, uh, I'm losing money, right?

727
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,679
Scott: Not using the claims, don't have buildings down.

728
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:38,358
Scott: Uh, uh, you know, the market's moving and I'm like, uh, I'm busy paying attention to something else.

729
00:54:38,522 --> 00:54:39,158
Scott: Uh, Oh God.

730
00:54:39,447 --> 00:54:39,798
Scott: Oh God.

731
00:54:40,006 --> 00:54:40,215
Scott: Yup.

732
00:54:40,481 --> 00:54:42,609
Rym: But also the game is very different.

733
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:46,119
Rym: playing against humans versus the AI, especially when you're not good.

734
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:55,858
Scott: The AI and the real time mode, when we played three against there, three of us and one AI, it destroyed us.

735
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:00,519
Scott: Its base was upgraded one level ahead of our basis at all times.

736
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,540
Rym: Its stock price was double any of ours within a couple minutes.

737
00:55:05,461 --> 00:55:10,757
Scott: I don't know what it was doing, but it was just like better than us in every conceivable way.

738
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,719
Scott: And that was the regular difficulty AI, not the cheaty, harder AI.

739
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:16,696
Rym: Yup.

740
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:30,840
Rym: The other, uh, challenge with the game is that the learning curve to getting to the point where even at, where you could play the game, multiplayer and kind of understand what's going on and like feel like you understand why you lost up to a point.

741
00:55:31,841 --> 00:55:36,879
Rym: It takes five to 10 hours probably to get to that point.

742
00:55:37,281 --> 00:55:44,840
Scott: The tutorial was a really good tutorial and that it didn't break and it introduced a lot of concepts, but it was by no means complete.

743
00:55:45,404 --> 00:55:46,700
Scott: It didn't tell you how to win.

744
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,726
Scott: It only told you like.

745
00:55:47,867 --> 00:55:49,880
Scott: it basically was like an interface tutorial.

746
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:54,000
Rym: Not really a game, but to be clear, it was necessary.

747
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,000
Rym: Like that tutorial is necessary to even be ready to engage with.

748
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,419
Rym: So how do I actually play this game?

749
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,020
Scott: You need like the tutorial is like, it'll tell you click here to buy glass.

750
00:56:04,242 --> 00:56:05,720
Scott: Now click here to upgrade your base.

751
00:56:05,801 --> 00:56:06,879
Scott: Now you have more claims.

752
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:17,140
Scott: So it like it, but it's like it told you what to do, but it didn't tell you why you were doing it or why you might do something else instead or what your other options were.

753
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,760
Scott: It was literally like click here, now click here.

754
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:30,096
Rym: So I would say you have to play the tutorials first, then play the tutorial like challenges where it makes you play a faction and like win on a predefined map until you can beat all of those.

755
00:56:31,103 --> 00:56:32,698
Rym: Then play some skirmishes with AIs.

756
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:33,637
Rym: It'll crush you.

757
00:56:34,162 --> 00:56:54,480
Rym: And then if you want to actually try to get good at this game, the only way to engage with it is, in my opinion, is kind of like with chess in that at that point, memorize a couple of basic openings just to get you like into the game enough to try to interact with the more advanced concepts.

758
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:02,020
Rym: Like I've memorized a couple of build orders that are not like perfect build orders, but they let me get further into the game.

759
00:57:02,931 --> 00:57:03,099
Scott: Yep.

760
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,163
Scott: I mean, that's the.

761
00:57:04,284 --> 00:57:06,380
Rym: I think that's, you know, I'm going to link to the spreadsheet.

762
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,200
Rym: Scott kept talking about the spreadsheet, but I didn't know what it was.

763
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,740
Rym: Then finally, what the fuck spreadsheet?

764
00:57:10,842 --> 00:57:11,819
Rym: And you sent me a link to it.

765
00:57:12,321 --> 00:57:17,520
Rym: And it is literally just this Google Doc that tells you how to someone made it some player of this game.

766
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,560
Scott: Someone made a Google Doc, which is basically the ultimate strategy guide for this game.

767
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,339
Rym: It's real good.

768
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:29,060
Rym: Like when to found an expansive HQ versus a robotic HQ when not to found it.

769
00:57:29,361 --> 00:57:35,240
Rym: Here's a basic build order and advanced build order and a bunch of expert build like guidelines.

770
00:57:36,865 --> 00:57:37,840
Scott: Yeah, I think that's the thing.

771
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,680
Scott: I don't the negative points of this game because it's not perfect.

772
00:57:41,827 --> 00:57:42,060
Scott: Right.

773
00:57:42,201 --> 00:57:46,500
Scott: Is that, you know, it is a little fast for old man Scott, but I guess that's just because I'm slow.

774
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:46,897
Scott: Right.

775
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:48,240
Scott: It's like it's a it's an artist.

776
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:48,520
Scott: Yes.

777
00:57:48,601 --> 00:57:50,820
Scott: It's not like it's false advertising here.

778
00:57:50,922 --> 00:57:51,240
Scott: Right.

779
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:56,140
Scott: It's if you don't want an artist at all, go play a turn based game instead.

780
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:56,612
Rym: Go places.

781
00:57:57,002 --> 00:57:57,680
Rym: This is game.

782
00:57:57,922 --> 00:58:00,260
Rym: This game shines with time pressure.

783
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,820
Rym: That is what makes it fun.

784
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,940
Scott: It does have, though, a little bit of that build order stuff, right?

785
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,720
Rym: Though, like I did watch some people are good at it.

786
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,539
Rym: I watched some streams.

787
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:14,732
Rym: The build orders that are memorizable are just.

788
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:23,220
Rym: they're very good, but they're worthless against someone who knows what they're doing because the people who know what they're doing adapt radically to what other people are doing.

789
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,317
Scott: The other.

790
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,320
Scott: Yeah, it's like is a lot of information to take in.

791
00:58:27,461 --> 00:58:28,860
Scott: It's not really the speed of clicking.

792
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,139
Scott: It's the speed of like, what the heck is going on?

793
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,559
Scott: You got people can put.

794
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,760
Scott: No, it's like put their buildings in their area.

795
00:58:34,861 --> 00:58:35,938
Scott: People can put buildings forever.

796
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,320
Scott: So it's like you can't even tell, like, what is that other person doing?

797
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,440
Scott: What buildings they have?

798
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,340
Scott: What's their strategy?

799
00:58:41,821 --> 00:58:50,823
Scott: And in the time it takes, like look at their base and assess that shit has happened and you've missed, you know, price on something could have crashed or skyrocketed or, you know, I

800
00:58:50,843 --> 00:58:56,580
Rym: feel like I've gotten to the point where I don't have to follow a strict build order to not lose when I play the robots.

801
00:58:57,365 --> 00:58:58,740
Rym: And that is as far as I've gotten.

802
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,640
Rym: That's like the equivalent.

803
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,135
Scott: Very.

804
00:59:00,701 --> 00:59:07,979
Scott: I'm wildly inconsistent where it's like I'll either, you know, do great or kind of great or just completely collapse.

805
00:59:08,382 --> 00:59:10,840
Rym: There's the game where you bought me out like right away.

806
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:14,319
Rym: There was another game where I heard stock price was approaching zero.

807
00:59:15,241 --> 00:59:16,485
Scott: You know, it's like I have.

808
00:59:16,605 --> 00:59:21,660
Scott: the problem is, is that I try to use normal common sense heuristics.

809
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:24,960
Scott: Like I look at a map and there's like no iron on it anywhere.

810
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:30,760
Scott: And I'm like, damn, I'll settle that iron and then I'll write the price should go way up and then I'll sell it.

811
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:31,180
Scott: All right.

812
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:35,098
Scott: It's like, you know, maybe I'll even use the hacker rate to boost the price of iron even higher.

813
00:59:35,504 --> 00:59:36,199
Scott: Let's just do that.

814
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:36,780
Rym: What did I do?

815
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,400
Rym: Found a scientific HQ, make steel directly by founding on that iron.

816
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,360
Rym: And who cares about iron?

817
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,359
Scott: No, but that's like, no, I'm saying like I played against the AI and I had a monopoly.

818
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,960
Scott: There was no other iron.

819
00:59:48,211 --> 00:59:48,400
Scott: Right.

820
00:59:48,523 --> 00:59:49,218
Scott: I had it all.

821
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:53,540
Scott: And the whole game, the price of iron was trash.

822
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,320
Scott: And I'm like, there's no iron on the fucking map.

823
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,100
Scott: The supply, I have all of it.

824
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,880
Scott: I'm fucking De Beers of iron.

825
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:04,420
Scott: Why is the price never going up unless I use like the hacker array?

826
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:05,839
Scott: And even then it doesn't go up that much.

827
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,260
Scott: Like this makes no sense.

828
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:10,958
Scott: Like there must be some reason the price of iron didn't go up.

829
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,757
Rym: Well, there is one aspect of this game that I like in that I think this is part of what makes the game work.

830
01:00:17,522 --> 01:00:22,500
Rym: The market, each of the resources are not just completely fungible, like they're just theme.

831
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:28,175
Rym: They all are used for specific purposes and tend to have certain patterns.

832
01:00:28,215 --> 01:00:34,420
Rym: like raw metal, like aluminum iron will never become super valuable in any circumstances.

833
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,234
Scott: But it stayed at like way low.

834
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,259
Scott: It didn't even go up to like 20 bucks.

835
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,320
Rym: That implies that the other players, the AIs were not buying much iron from the market.

836
01:00:43,993 --> 01:00:44,180
Scott: Right.

837
01:00:44,261 --> 01:00:45,860
Scott: But there are also situations, right?

838
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,739
Scott: So there's the colony, which is not a player.

839
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,059
Scott: It's just a thing on the map that you can look at.

840
01:00:50,201 --> 01:00:52,159
Scott: And you know, it's what you're always buying and selling with.

841
01:00:52,801 --> 01:00:58,800
Scott: And I saw that the colony had a lot of laboratories, which implies that, you know, those laboratories need chemicals to operate.

842
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,419
Scott: And I said, aha, that library has a lot of chemicals needs with all its laboratories of the science colony.

843
01:01:05,063 --> 01:01:06,420
Scott: I'll build some chemical plants.

844
01:01:07,066 --> 01:01:07,298
Scott: Right.

845
01:01:07,781 --> 01:01:10,580
Scott: And at the time I built them, they were somewhat profitable.

846
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:15,860
Scott: And then fucking the chemical prices were just like in the shitter.

847
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,720
Scott: And I'm like, demand is so high.

848
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:19,200
Scott: And I don't see a lot.

849
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,499
Scott: I looked at the other players' bases.

850
01:01:20,642 --> 01:01:21,440
Scott: They weren't making.

851
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,380
Scott: I think one other player had like one chemical plant.

852
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,819
Scott: And it's like, shouldn't the price of chemicals be going up?

853
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,285
Scott: It's like what it's like.

854
01:01:30,506 --> 01:01:37,400
Scott: those common sense heuristics of supply and demand did not apply in several games that I played.

855
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:38,619
Scott: It was like a common pattern.

856
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:44,720
Scott: So I need I'm having trouble finding a heuristic of trying to predict what's going to be valuable.

857
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:58,140
Rym: I know this isn't helpful, but I look at that market the whole time and I kind of treat it like it's the real stock market, the way I would actually invest were I trying to invest in the commodities.

858
01:01:58,714 --> 01:01:58,840
Scott: Right.

859
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:08,560
Scott: But I mean, that's that that's one way to play is just, you know, like day trading or like, you know, real time trading where like it's like the prices up, sell, sell, sell the prices down, buy, buy, buy constantly.

860
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:19,339
Rym: But I can't find any long term thinking to apply to the only long term thinking I have is chips always become valuable near the end.

861
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:23,039
Rym: Food almost always becomes very valuable near the end.

862
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,800
Rym: Fuel is usually more expensive than I expected.

863
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:30,899
Rym: And power is the thing that will fuck me over really badly if I don't pay attention to it.

864
01:02:31,594 --> 01:02:31,760
Scott: Right.

865
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,086
Scott: But it's like I try to.

866
01:02:33,247 --> 01:02:37,446
Scott: I was, you know, in my attempts to find a long term thing, we're like, aha, I can.

867
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,720
Scott: I can predict in this game that this will be valuable later.

868
01:02:41,241 --> 01:02:46,839
Scott: I'll stockpile it early and then make a big move because there's no other supply of it or something like that.

869
01:02:46,941 --> 01:02:48,138
Scott: And that never worked ever.

870
01:02:48,662 --> 01:02:54,919
Rym: Ah, that was one of the multiplayer games with iron for me because I had the hacker array just boost iron like ten times in a row.

871
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,119
Scott: I tried to do I've tried to do that and it didn't work.

872
01:02:58,625 --> 01:03:00,840
Rym: So anyway, the danger is the hacker.

873
01:03:01,101 --> 01:03:07,019
Scott: I think that there's a lot more focus on that sort of, you know, instant reaction of.

874
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:07,779
Scott: look at the market.

875
01:03:07,961 --> 01:03:08,999
Scott: A number goes green.

876
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,200
Scott: Do you have that resource?

877
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,140
Scott: Start selling.

878
01:03:11,244 --> 01:03:11,457
Scott: Yeah.

879
01:03:12,105 --> 01:03:13,039
Scott: A number is red.

880
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,640
Scott: Do you not have that resource?

881
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,860
Scott: You know, start buying that sort of if it's a resource you need.

882
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:19,279
Scott: Yeah.

883
01:03:19,622 --> 01:03:20,719
Scott: Or going to need so.

884
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:25,440
Rym: But I really enjoy this game more so than I expected.

885
01:03:26,122 --> 01:03:33,500
Scott: And the multiplayer game with such high quality of life with, you know, with less micro than other artists, but still an artist.

886
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:46,700
Scott: And, you know, with despite being so simple, relatively in terms of like what you can do, but having clearly a lot of strategic depth to get better at it in a high skill cap of some kind.

887
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:49,198
Scott: You know, there's a lot of replay value here.

888
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:49,678
Rym: Yep.

889
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:54,840
Rym: And if you you might encounter that the eyes are extremely unfun to play against.

890
01:03:55,003 --> 01:03:55,899
Rym: Don't worry about that.

891
01:03:56,681 --> 01:04:04,639
Rym: If you invest the five to 10 hours and just learning the basics of the game, multiplayer against scrubs is super fun.

892
01:04:05,181 --> 01:04:07,540
Rym: Like we were playing for player multiplayer.

893
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,559
Rym: None of us are that good.

894
01:04:08,943 --> 01:04:10,820
Rym: And the games were really close and interesting.

895
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:15,100
Rym: Kind of like when you play a euro style board game, but none of you have played it before.

896
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,800
Rym: And you're all just kind of fumbling in the dark.

897
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:19,919
Rym: It can be real fun and real fair and real close.

898
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:25,440
Scott: The one thing I really didn't like about this game is the single player campaign.

899
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:29,747
Scott: You can do a single player skirmish, which is basically just play a multiplayer game against A.I.

900
01:04:30,151 --> 01:04:31,020
Scott: to learn your shit.

901
01:04:31,581 --> 01:04:36,200
Scott: But there's a campaign and the campaign is really all these scenarios.

902
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:40,180
Scott: And like you unlock and you don't even have all the buildings to start with.

903
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,675
Scott: Like you're unlocking them as you go along.

904
01:04:42,622 --> 01:04:43,820
Scott: And it's sort of stateful.

905
01:04:44,241 --> 01:04:50,160
Scott: It's not bad, but like it was not as fun as just playing the normal game.

906
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:56,040
Rym: It's kind of like remember there's the Wesnoth campaigns, but just Wesnoth multiplayer was like the thing that was worth playing.

907
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:57,540
Scott: Exactly, exactly.

908
01:04:57,861 --> 01:05:02,560
Scott: So I could see someone getting into the campaign thing and enjoying it, but not me.

909
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:06,200
Rym: Especially because one thing that's worth noting, the music is fantastic.

910
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:08,180
Rym: Like the theme is fantastic.

911
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,960
Rym: This like corporate libertarian health game.

912
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,100
Scott: The music is good, but I had to turn it off because it was too distracting.

913
01:05:14,801 --> 01:05:16,179
Rym: I just turned it way down.

914
01:05:17,321 --> 01:05:18,377
Scott: Down works good.

915
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,959
Rym: The writing is really funny.

916
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,540
Rym: Especially, like not just the regular game, like the writing is funny.

917
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,880
Rym: Like when things happen, like when a pleasure dome gets built.

918
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:33,280
Rym: But the tutorials are, they're not as funny as Portal, but they're close.

919
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:36,500
Rym: There are jokes and little bits.

920
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:43,260
Scott: It's that same sort of like tug and cheek, you know, sort of, what's it called?

921
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,280
Scott: Hitchhiker's Guide-esque nerd humor, right?

922
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:50,060
Scott: Where it's being cute and cartoony and sciency.

923
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:53,860
Rym: But also being a little bit like, yeah, libertarian dystopia.

924
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,109
Rym: This is what it looks like.

925
01:05:55,149 --> 01:05:55,754
Rym: This is awful.

926
01:05:55,855 --> 01:05:56,500
Rym: Fuck capitalism.

927
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,179
Scott: Yep, exactly.

928
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,070
Rym: The game is very much like capitalism.

929
01:06:00,131 --> 01:06:01,440
Rym: in its final form is awful.

930
01:06:03,241 --> 01:06:04,124
Scott: There's some M.U.L.E.

931
01:06:04,164 --> 01:06:07,860
Scott: references that are not at all veiled in any way whatsoever.

932
01:06:08,241 --> 01:06:09,112
Rym: There's just M.U.L.E.

933
01:06:09,152 --> 01:06:09,800
Rym: on the black market.

934
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:12,480
Rym: You can just buy it and it goes out and gets resources from the desert.

935
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,650
Scott: And the tutorial references like Dr.

936
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:18,179
Scott: Bunten, the creator of M.U.L.E It's like by name.

937
01:06:19,741 --> 01:06:24,520
Rym: I think this game is just, like, it has great reviews from a lot of people.

938
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,420
Rym: It's not talked about that often.

939
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,278
Rym: It wasn't talked about that much even when it came out.

940
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,440
Scott: Well, it's a very niche interest, right?

941
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:30,778
Scott: It is.

942
01:06:31,642 --> 01:06:34,779
Scott: Even perfectly implemented, if I had nothing to complain about.

943
01:06:35,762 --> 01:06:38,360
Scott: Who in the world is the audience for this game?

944
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:39,838
Scott: It's like nerds like us.

945
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:41,317
Scott: It's pretty much it.

946
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:48,960
Rym: And it's interesting that a game that was basically designed for me as a primary demographic is also a game that I'm terrible at.

947
01:06:49,741 --> 01:06:50,898
Scott: I'm so awful at this game.

948
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,959
Rym: Yet I want to play it more.

949
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,740
Rym: So if you listen to GeekNights, there's a chance you will like this game.

950
01:06:58,182 --> 01:07:02,219
Rym: And I'm pretty sure you can still try it out for free on the Epic Games Store if you want to try it.

951
01:07:04,143 --> 01:07:05,307
Scott: Or just wait for a sale.

952
01:07:05,448 --> 01:07:08,260
Scott: It will be on sale again for very little money.

953
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:15,660
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

954
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:20,800
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

Rym: So yeah, if I don't know what else to say, I'll simply leave you tonight with... (singing in foreign language).

963
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:27,462
Rym: (singing in foreign language).
