1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,009
Rym: It's Thursday, December 15th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:10,250
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:14,120
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:16,047
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,299
Rym: We are talking about Hanukkah.

6
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:26,260
Rym: You know, it's only fair if Scott said he did a Christmas show.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,637
Scott: I just don't have any other ideas.

8
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:30,459
Rym: He did a Christmas show in 2016, but you say that.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:50,580
Rym: One thing, a common dynamic, especially for the listener who sometimes watches the livestream, especially when I click go live long before we actually start the show, when we're trying to figure out what show to do, the pattern is, I'll have 10 ideas that Scott vetoes, and Scott will have one idea that I veto, and then we're stuck, and then we proceed.

10
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:55,579
Rym: So I came up with a policy a long time ago, and this is the first time I was able to enact it.

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,092
Rym: My policy was, if I ever say, "What should we do this show

12
00:00:59,253 --> 00:00:59,353
Rym: on?"

13
00:00:59,695 --> 00:01:05,099
Rym: and Scott suggests something, I will automatically select it no matter what and do the exact same thing he does to me.

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,466
Rym: All right, you can drive.

15
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:07,190
Rym: Good idea.

16
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:07,713
Rym: Let's do it.

17
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:08,959
Rym: I feel good about this show.

18
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:12,459
Rym: But I think there's enough to talk about.

19
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:17,240
Rym: But in the open-y bit, as you know, I talked about on the show, we move pretty quick here.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:28,560
Rym: The 2012 Chevy Cruze that was a gift from Emily's family that got us through COVID, hiking and skiing, blew up in semi-spectacular fashion and is gone.

21
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:32,819
Rym: And I bought a new devil car that has four miles on it.

22
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:38,262
Rym: We have a Toyota Corolla Hybrid all-wheel drive 2023.

23
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:40,039
Rym: We bought the only one the dealership had.

24
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:45,018
Rym: And I hate buying cars, especially at dealerships.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,520
Scott: I don't know why you didn't do what I suggested and hire the car buying expert.

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:57,540
Rym: I looked at that, and get this, this was actually really easy, and car buying is a lot different than it was the last time I bought a car.

27
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,520
Scott: Because you have to understand, the last time- I've only done it one time, and I just- I've done it twice.

28
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:04,700
Scott: I did it, I probably didn't do it the best way.

29
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,332
Rym: In the year 1996, I bought with a $3,500 check that my parents wrote for me, a laser.

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Rym: Like, that was my first car.

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,000
Rym: You know, my parents gave me a check, I gave it to some guy who gave me this car.

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,840
Rym: This was one of those, like, buy it from someone in their own driveway and drive it home and hope it doesn't break.

33
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:32,360
Rym: And then in 2001, I bought the Purple Sunfire that you remember and love.

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,596
Rym: The one where one time- Who said I loved it?

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,680
Rym: So, we were playing Blaze in the Dark the other night, and Alex plays with us, and I was reminded of an instant that I'm pretty sure you were there for, you and Pete.

36
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:51,060
Rym: Where we drove that car somewhere, and I stopped to replace the tire, because I got a flat, and I had to put the donut on.

37
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,880
Rym: We were sitting outside like a gas station.

38
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:58,080
Rym: And I remember that I jacked the car up, and I put the donut on with you guys' help.

39
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,359
Rym: And then when I pulled the jack down, the car didn't go down.

40
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:08,400
Rym: The shocks just stayed fully extended, and the back of the car just stayed up, like, at an angle.

41
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,600
Scott: I have a memory of a car doing something like that and, like, having to sit on the car to squish the car.

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,320
Rym: Yeah, I remember me and Pete got on the back of the car and kind of jumped up and down until we forced the shock back down so we could drive home.

43
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:22,708
Rym: And I never got that fixed at any point.

44
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:26,480
Rym: The shocks were still broken when we were living in Beacon.

45
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,058
Scott: I mean, clearly, they're not supposed to do that.

46
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:29,202
Rym: Oh, no.

47
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:32,780
Rym: They're not supposed to do that to a degree that I understood.

48
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,860
Scott: I mean, in some cars, they do that on purpose, right?

49
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,934
Scott: It's a lowrider, right?

50
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,220
Scott: I guess, on some level.

51
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,640
Scott: It's not supposed to do that by accident.

52
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:45,480
Rym: When we were in college, I understood that that was not supposed to happen, but what was I going to do?

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,173
Rym: It's not like I could afford to fix anything in that car.

54
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:49,440
Rym: I could barely afford to change the oil.

55
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,319
Scott: Didn't afford to keep the car from getting repo'd.

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:52,781
Rym: Yeah.

57
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:57,860
Rym: The car got repo'd, someone stole the car later, and I never knew what happened to it.

58
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,940
Rym: And I just gave up on it, actually, at that point.

59
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,099
Scott: I don't remember it being stolen.

60
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,742
Rym: That was in Beacon.

61
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:07,140
Rym: When we moved out of Beacon, I parked it, actually, outside Emily's apartment.

62
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:11,180
Rym: And then I couldn't come back for, like, two days because a giant blizzard happened.

63
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,507
Rym: And when I came back, the car was gone.

64
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,720
Rym: So I called a bunch of tow places and none of them had it.

65
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,595
Rym: Like, I called all the impound lots I could find in the phone book.

66
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:20,319
Rym: None of them had it.

67
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:22,897
Rym: So I filed a police report, like, "Yeah, I guess my car was

68
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:23,260
Rym: stolen.".

69
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:25,799
Rym: And then I just didn't do anything because I didn't care.

70
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,859
Rym: Cops never called me back.

71
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:30,928
Rym: And that car just disappeared.

72
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:32,860
Rym: To this day, I have no idea what happened to that Sunfire.

73
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:33,879
Rym: Nor do I care.

74
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:45,220
Rym: If someone stole it, like, godspeed, it didn't have cooling, nor did it really have oil in it, or power steering fluid, or transmission fluid, and the brakes didn't really work that well.

75
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:57,040
Rym: But buying a new car is extra special because not only have I never bought a new car, I don't think anyone in my family, my direct line, has ever bought a new car.

76
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,387
Rym: Like, that is not a thing.

77
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,233
Rym: I didn't.

78
00:04:59,273 --> 00:05:00,320
Rym: I could never afford that.

79
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:02,899
Rym: And by the time I could afford it, I didn't need or want a car.

80
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:05,545
Rym: So buying the car.

81
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:09,000
Rym: to tell the short story, I go in and it's hard to get this car.

82
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,280
Rym: Like, there aren't a lot of hybrids available for all the reasons you can read about on a real news site.

83
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:16,698
Rym: It's actually really hard to buy that kind of car right now.

84
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,779
Rym: Used ones are going for, like, the same price as new ones, which is extra fucked up.

85
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,349
Rym: So the car I want costs, sticker, $28,900.

86
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:26,034
Rym: Like, that's the sticker price.

87
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:29,119
Scott: That's not too bad.

88
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,249
Rym: Yeah, that's not too bad.

89
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:35,260
Scott: In the old days- You had a lot more money than I had when I bought a car, and the car I bought was $19,000.

90
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,351
Scott: Yeah.

91
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,201
Scott: And that was in 2006.

92
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:45,117
Rym: I Google around, and basically every dealer within a reasonable trip of New York City adds $3,000 to $4,000 to that.

93
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,880
Rym: They're actually selling them way above sticker because they're in such high demand.

94
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,150
Rym: Like, you can't get them cheap.

95
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,220
Rym: You're going to pay extra.

96
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:57,093
Rym: This dealership- Yeah, it was actually, like, that seemed reasonable.

97
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:58,199
Rym: Like, I could deal with that.

98
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,371
Rym: Especially because if I finance it, like, inflation's so bad.

99
00:06:01,753 --> 00:06:02,817
Rym: Yeah, loan me money.

100
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:03,380
Rym: Good luck.

101
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:07,454
Rym: So, uh, the dealership's like, "Yeah, that car's worth about

102
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:08,840
Rym: $41,000.".

103
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,999
Rym: And that's the price that they gave me when we went in and looked at it.

104
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,857
Rym: And we just played dumb, and I was like, "Yeah, okay, cool,

105
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:15,200
Rym: whatever.".

106
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,923
Rym: And we acted like.

107
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:16,626
Rym: we kind of liked the car.

108
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:19,679
Rym: Then we left and came back a few days later, said we want to buy it.

109
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:26,200
Rym: And I didn't haggle until we had filled out the financing form all the way to the bottom.

110
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,360
Rym: Like, all that was left is to sign my name on a piece of paper, and then the process of buying this car would start.

111
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:37,600
Rym: And then I was just like, "Hey, uh, so all the other dealerships are only marking these up by, like, $3,000.

112
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,354
Rym: So, uh, why does this one cost

113
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:41,822
Rym: $41,000?".

114
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:45,660
Rym: And the guy did the thing where he pretends to go talk to his manager for, like, two minutes.

115
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,520
Rym: And he comes back, and he knocks it down to exactly what I said.

116
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:49,922
Rym: And I was like,

117
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:50,383
Rym: "Okay.".

118
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:52,693
Rym: Like, we both were like, "Okay, that was the game.

119
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:53,075
Rym: The game's

120
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:53,356
Rym: over.".

121
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:54,280
Rym: And I bought the car.

122
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,108
Scott: But you did financing?

123
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:08,037
Rym: Uh, so I did financing because I learned that the interest rate my credit card company, like Chase, offered on their special deal was, like, 7.5%.

124
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:08,458
Rym: Fuck that.

125
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:16,660
Rym: Uh, the dealership was, like, 6%, but it's Toyota-thon.

126
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:21,451
Rym: And there's one of those deals that you're not supposed to be able to get, 3.49%, which is shockingly low.

127
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,460
Rym: Like, I'm literally better off financing and taking the money I would have paid cash for and just putting it in the stock market for two years.

128
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,760
Scott: I mean, that may be true, that they might have had a deal going on, right?

129
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:44,553
Scott: But, uh, everything that I've heard suggests that, you know, you should be able to get financing elsewhere.

130
00:07:44,593 --> 00:07:48,660
Scott: that's, like, basically even when there's a deal that's lower than what the car dealership offers.

131
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:54,760
Scott: And then, when you buy a car with cash from the dealer, you should get a lower price.

132
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,585
Rym: Oh, yeah, so that's the thing I was getting at.

133
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:57,810
Rym: That was the conventional wisdom.

134
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,235
Rym: That's how I've always approached cars.

135
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:00,780
Rym: That shit doesn't work anymore.

136
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:07,631
Rym: I was trying to, like, talk about total price, and the guy was like, "The total price is the same no matter how you finance.

137
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:11,258
Rym: If you put no money down, if you pay in cash, the price is the price.

138
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:12,339
Rym: They don't care about that

139
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:12,680
Rym: anymore.".

140
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,149
Scott: Mm-hmm.

141
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:23,139
Rym: So, uh, 3.5% is apparently insane, and I get the impression, 'cause they basically said, "Oh, yeah, your credit's literally perfect, so we got that

142
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:23,319
Rym: deal.".

143
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,040
Scott: Yeah, I mean, that's not a problem.

144
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:32,672
Rym: Yeah, so I put 10 grand down, and the other thing, there is no prepayment penalty, so I could just pay the whole thing off tomorrow if I wanted.

145
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:37,900
Rym: I could turn this into cash and pay, like, a couple dollars worth of interest effectively.

146
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,139
Scott: Oh, yeah, you could always do that, yeah.

147
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:43,966
Rym: Uh, some, in the old days, a lot of financing wouldn't let you do that.

148
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:47,212
Rym: My sunfire, if I paid it off early, I would've had to pay a penalty.

149
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:49,596
Rym: Not that I could've paid it off early.

150
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:50,858
Rym: I mean, it got repoed.

151
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:51,680
Rym: I couldn't even pay it.

152
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:53,381
Scott: Hmm.

153
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:59,334
Scott: Uh, I'm gonna just add a curio- I mean, the problem is, I would go and, like, type into a website to get an auto loan quote.

154
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:03,720
Scott: The problem is, I know from having worked literally in my business- Oh, yeah, it'll do a hard check on your credit.

155
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:05,344
Scott: No, that's not the problem.

156
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:06,027
Scott: I don't care about that.

157
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,220
Scott: The problem is, if I do that, I will start being inundated.

158
00:09:10,223 --> 00:09:11,880
Scott: By people trying to sell cars.

159
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,701
Rym: Oh, my God.

160
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:18,148
Rym: I clicked on a website, like, last week on a car, like, some random Toyota dealership.

161
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:19,910
Rym: Like, I'm interested in this one.

162
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,215
Rym: Those motherfuckers would not respond to an email.

163
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:27,280
Rym: Like, they didn't email me back, except they tried to email me and they fucked it up, so I went to you.

164
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,840
Rym: Uh, they just called my phone, like, five times a day for weeks.

165
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,148
Scott: Yep.

166
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:37,880
Rym: I just blocked the number and didn't, uh, buy the car from that dealership.

167
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:38,986
Scott: Yep.

168
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:39,920
Scott: Anyway.

169
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,620
Rym: Anyway, I have a devil carriage now to replace the one that blew up, and it's pretty cool.

170
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,776
Scott: Um, prob- I'm still probably not gonna buy one for- ever.

171
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:49,540
Scott: I don't know.

172
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:49,740
Scott: Yep.

173
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:51,611
Rym: You can still borrow mine if you ever need a car.

174
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:53,160
Rym: Just don't crash it, 'cause it's a nice one.

175
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,047
Scott: I mean, last year- I mean, this year.

176
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,799
Scott: This year's almost over, but I'm not gonna need one again this year.

177
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,532
Scott: Uh, but in all of 2022, I- there were two times that I wanted a vehicle.

178
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,760
Rym: Well, you tried to borrow mine that one time, and, like, you couldn't get a parking brake done.

179
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,080
Scott: Right, that was one of the times- right, so one of the times that we wanted to go apple picking.

180
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:12,555
Scott: Yep.

181
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:22,500
Scott: And we did not- we ended up just not having the car, and there was no, like, really reasonable alternative, so we simply didn't go, and it wasn't that big a deal.

182
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,638
Scott: It was disappointing, but no- you know, one day, one apple picking.

183
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:25,900
Scott: Okay.

184
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,740
Rym: That happened to me three- there were three instances over the last two years.

185
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:38,900
Rym: Well, after the last year, where I went to get that car at, like, 6 AM to go ski, and something on it blew up, and the trip failed, and my whole day turned into car repair shit.

186
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,480
Scott: Yep.

187
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:46,280
Scott: And then the other- the other time was on Thanksgiving, which, out of our control, our family Thanksgiving was in New Jersey.

188
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:46,784
Rym: Yep.

189
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:55,020
Scott: We could have used a train to get there and back, but we got relatives to drive us there, and then we used a train to go home.

190
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,006
Rym: Funnily enough, that's when the cruise blew up.

191
00:10:57,127 --> 00:11:01,120
Rym: We drove to Thanksgiving, and on the way home at midnight on the GWB, it blew up.

192
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,083
Scott: Yeah, it was a minor inconvenience.

193
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:17,940
Scott: We got, you know, we spent more- a slight amount of time and money in transport, right, on train tickets and whatever, but compared to the cost of car renting or buying, it's like the cost of train tickets one time.

194
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:27,140
Rym: I did calculate, because we do, like, since COVID started, we ski pretty much every weekend in the winter, and we hike, like, a lot of weekends in the spring and fall.

195
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,707
Scott: Just don't do that.

196
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:30,440
Scott: You could save a lot of money.

197
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,539
Rym: Those are our primary hobbies, like biking, skiing, running, hiking.

198
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,247
Scott: You don't need the car for biking.

199
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:38,900
Scott: It's literally the opposite of car.

200
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:46,399
Rym: Yeah, we actually, we don't, we only use, we only took, the only time we ever took the bikes anywhere in the car was taking them to Wildwood.

201
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:54,640
Rym: But it ends up being cheaper to own this car, for us, for that profile.

202
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:06,740
Scott: I mean, if you, right, you're basically, you know, it's like, yes, if you continue, if you insist on doing those activities, you know, owning a car to do those activities is cheaper than doing those activities some other way.

203
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:10,220
Scott: But what's even cheaper is not doing those things.

204
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,219
Rym: Yeah, but those things are great.

205
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:13,217
Scott: Anyway.

206
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:22,600
Rym: Of course, the car costs, I mean, considering how much we're spending to fly to Colorado to ski in January, the car is actually, it rounds down significantly.

207
00:12:23,683 --> 00:12:24,980
Scott: You could just not do that either.

208
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:32,840
Rym: So, in the news, I got a little bit of a geek bite, because I've watched the show, at least the first season of it with Emily.

209
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:34,819
Rym: We might do a little special and talk about it.

210
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:37,020
Rym: The Ted Lasso Show, which.

211
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,260
Scott: That's the, that's the, that's the, oh, basically, what I know about this show.

212
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:41,378
Rym: I don't see what you know about it.

213
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:46,180
Scott: It's basically the only thing on Apple TV Plus that really anyone cares about.

214
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,179
Rym: That is true, it is literally the only thing on Apple TV that anyone gets a shit about.

215
00:12:50,560 --> 00:13:03,900
Scott: People get Apple TV Plus just to watch this one show, right, so it must be, you know, have some sort of, you know, goodness to make people, right, you know, at least it's got enough hype to make people go out and get Apple TV Plus just to watch one damn TV show, right?

216
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:12,900
Scott: And then it's about, so basically it's some soccer coach who doesn't know what the fuck he's doing and it's silly or heartwarming in some way, the end.

217
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:14,424
Rym: So, you're close.

218
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:16,591
Rym: That's like the surface detail.

219
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:19,420
Rym: And even watching the first episode, it kind of felt like that.

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,360
Rym: The full, what the show is actually about is there's a Premier League club and like the owner.

221
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,840
Scott: So it's like, it's a Premier League, it's like the top of English soccer.

222
00:13:29,362 --> 00:13:33,780
Rym: It's a Premier League club, like it's set there, it's realistic and serious.

223
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Rym: The owner like has an acrimonious fucked up divorce and his wife, who he cheated on, ends up owning the club.

224
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:51,020
Rym: So she tries to pull a producer's and destroy this club, get them relegated down to the bottom, like just burn everything.

225
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,619
Scott: Yeah, they could be relegated, yeah.

226
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,568
Rym: Yeah, so that's her plan.

227
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:56,777
Rym: So she hires basically like...

228
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,767
Scott: Why would that be your plan though?

229
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:01,380
Scott: If you own the club, you're just going to lose money doing that.

230
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:10,600
Rym: She's raised separately, so she just wants to spite her husband because the one thing you know about her husband when the show starts is he loved that club more than anything on earth.

231
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:14,019
Rym: That is all he cared about was that club and cheating on her.

232
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:15,217
Scott: Okay.

233
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:28,340
Rym: And she basically hires effectively like a high school/college level American coach of sports who literally does not know anything about soccer.

234
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:35,180
Rym: And hires him and puts him in charge of this, like he doesn't know how soccer works really, like he doesn't know the rules.

235
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:36,425
Rym: Dude doesn't know.

236
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:39,000
Rym: relegation is a thing until about halfway through the season.

237
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:44,255
Rym: There's a great scene later in the show where they explain it to him and they're like, "What?

238
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:45,279
Rym: You don't have that in the

239
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:45,640
Rym: US?".

240
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,607
Rym: And he's like, "God no!

241
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:49,935
Rym: What the fuck is this all about?

242
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:50,317
Rym: Get

243
00:14:50,337 --> 00:14:50,538
Rym: demoted?".

244
00:14:51,421 --> 00:14:55,854
Scott: No matter how much the Detroit Lions suck, they will always be in the NFL.

245
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,840
Scott: They won't be sent down to some other league.

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,899
Rym: But then they float around because they're like, "What does shitty teams in the US

247
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:01,020
Rym: do?".

248
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:09,619
Rym: And he's like, "Well actually, depending on the sport, they pretty much tank and play badly on purpose hoping that they'll get better players for the next

249
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:09,940
Rym: season.".

250
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:18,239
Scott: Oh, so the trailer gave me the impression that the Ted Lasso coach guy was sort of like a dumb and dumber idiot.

251
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:18,802
Rym: No!

252
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:19,891
Rym: That is the lie.

253
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:21,040
Rym: That is not what the show is about.

254
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:24,473
Scott: So he's actually, he has a common sense.

255
00:15:24,513 --> 00:15:26,320
Scott: He just doesn't know anything about soccer because he's American.

256
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,991
Rym: So, is that he is a fantastic coach of sports players.

257
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:34,880
Rym: He just happens to have never coached soccer before.

258
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,355
Scott: Oh, so he's just out of his element.

259
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:37,960
Scott: He's not an idiot.

260
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,240
Scott: Yeah.

261
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:49,660
Rym: In fact, I will say having watched the entire first season, the way the show really goes is that he is a fantastic coach and nobody believes in him and he's actively being sabotaged.

262
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:53,460
Rym: But over time, he actually does make a difference and make the team better.

263
00:15:54,581 --> 00:16:01,319
Scott: So it's almost like a one-punch man where everyone looks at him and it's like, "Who's this bald moron guy who's weak and not

264
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:01,760
Scott: powerful?".

265
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,300
Scott: But actually, he's the strongest one.

266
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:12,140
Rym: And if I had to say what he's like as a character, take Ned Flanders and cross him 50/50 with our friend Chase Gordon.

267
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:13,600
Scott: Okay.

268
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:17,028
Rym: I am literally, that is exactly who this character is.

269
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:18,391
Rym: The show is fantastic.

270
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:21,920
Rym: It made me cry about a fake soccer game.

271
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,793
Rym: Like, actually cry at the end of the first season because it starts out silly.

272
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:29,160
Rym: The characters almost seem like caricatures.

273
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:34,308
Rym: The first few episodes feel like Disney kids special.

274
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:40,480
Rym: Like, imagine the Mighty Ducks, but if it wasn't the story of a piece of shit learning to be good in the course of coaching the team.

275
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,059
Scott: Yeah, that's what the trailer seems like.

276
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,260
Rym: Imagine if it was a guy who is the best guy making everyone else around him better over the course of the movie.

277
00:16:51,100 --> 00:17:04,560
Rym: But where it tricks you is as the show goes on, one by one, all the characters get more complex and more human until the show is a very serious, very heartfelt, very well-written drama.

278
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:13,660
Rym: And if you watch, I'm not saying you should watch it, I think you'd like it, I don't know if you'd like it, I bet you would get a little choked up in the last episode of season one.

279
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:24,499
Rym: I would bet a token amount that that would happen if you watch this show and it sneaks up on you just like Ted Lasso, the character, sneaks up on the characters in the show.

280
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:28,303
Rym: It also gets soccer really right.

281
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:37,700
Rym: Like, there's a moment where whenever they talk about the game or do strategy, it's really accurate and really right, like in a really good way.

282
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:46,560
Rym: It treats soccer seriously, which is, that would have been a deal breaker if the soccer was fakie, but no, the soccer is like hyper-realistic and that helps.

283
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:53,757
Scott: Alright, so the news that nobody could escape this week is we have achieved Fusion.

284
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,020
Rym: Yeah, we have beaten Unity.

285
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,620
Scott: We've achieved Fusion before, this isn't the first Fusion.

286
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:10,400
Rym: We have achieved Fusion that generated definitely more power output than the power input in a very controlled short experiment.

287
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:13,203
Scott: Well, it depends on your interpretation, right?

288
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:29,160
Scott: So the energy, basically the way the Fusion, the simplest explanation of how the Fusion machine is set up is that there is some target made of some material and there are lasers and the lasers fire at the target simultaneously.

289
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:41,320
Scott: And the lasers apply enough energy, pressure, heat, whatever to the target so that atoms fuse together into bigger atoms, right?

290
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:45,528
Scott: And then energy is released just like in a star, right?

291
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:49,976
Scott: Where, you know, hydrogens combine into heliums and energy is released, right?

292
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:51,820
Scott: Enough to warm a solar system.

293
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,280
Rym: Not just hydrogens and heliums, they all keep combining and they make denser and denser elements as time goes on.

294
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,009
Scott: Right, but it's the opposite of Fission like a nuclear weapon, right?

295
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:03,554
Scott: Where you break the atoms apart and the energy comes out, right?

296
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:04,597
Rym: It's the opposite.

297
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:05,900
Scott: But energy still comes out.

298
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,580
Rym: I would also point out that all modern nuclear weapons are Fusion and Fusion is just a baby step before the Fusion.

299
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:17,927
Scott: The point is that usually when we've tried this before, right?

300
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:21,812
Scott: The energy that you need to put into the lasers, right?

301
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:28,500
Scott: That's the energy input that we're measuring is how much, you know, basically you plug the laser into the wall with your kilowatt, right?

302
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,600
Scott: And you see how much energy the laser needs.

303
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:39,656
Rym: But what we're not measuring for practical reasons yet is the rest of the setup, like the whole facility that makes this happen.

304
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:41,500
Rym: that uses energy is not part of this equation.

305
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,781
Scott: Exactly.

306
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:45,765
Scott: There's all kinds of other energy that had to go into this, right?

307
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:55,660
Scott: It's like someone had to physically put the target there and line everything up and monitor it and measure it and the lights for the people to see what the fuck is going on.

308
00:19:56,742 --> 00:20:08,720
Scott: The heating and cooling for the people who are working there, like there's so much other energy, the energy to go into manufacturing all the equipment and it's like a lot of energy went into it that's not being measured, right?

309
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:08,840
Rym: Yep.

310
00:20:10,082 --> 00:20:20,817
Rym: But the lasers put about two megajoules of energy into this experiment and about three megajoules of energy were released by the Fusion.

311
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,580
Rym: that happened because of those lasers.

312
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,644
Rym: Which, that is why this is big news.

313
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:29,315
Rym: They call this ignition in that this was a proof of concept.

314
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:31,780
Rym: that was the next milestone.

315
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:41,280
Rym: Everything we've ever done researching Fusion was basically trying to achieve this as the milestone that leads us to the next milestones.

316
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:46,546
Scott: So to give you sort of a, I guess a ruler, right?

317
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:47,747
Scott: A measuring stick, right?

318
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:51,071
Scott: Two megajoules doesn't mean much to most people, right?

319
00:20:51,512 --> 00:20:56,297
Scott: Two megajoules is basically like eating 500 calories of food.

320
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,460
Scott: So like a candy bar, maybe?

321
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,420
Rym: Four slices of white bread, give or take?

322
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:01,881
Scott: Yeah.

323
00:21:02,281 --> 00:21:02,942
Scott: Something like that.

324
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:10,252
Scott: So imagine setting a candy bar on fire and all the energy that comes out of the candy bar, it's just a pile of carbon is left, right?

325
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:10,613
Scott: Whatever.

326
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:15,680
Scott: And then suddenly there's like an extra half a candy bar.

327
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,261
Scott: Yep.

328
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:21,880
Rym: Take two Snickers bars, mash them up in your hand, reform it, you get two and a half candy bars.

329
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,082
Scott: Right.

330
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,131
Scott: At least energy wise, you lose.

331
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:27,220
Scott: the matter is, you know.

332
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,762
Rym: Matter is just energy.

333
00:21:28,802 --> 00:21:30,004
Scott: Well, I guess there is going to be.

334
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:34,832
Scott: the fused matter is now combined in some other element now, right?

335
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:35,673
Scott: You have that left.

336
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,955
Scott: That's your byproduct, right?

337
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:40,100
Scott: You start with some smaller atoms and you end up with bigger ones.

338
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,900
Rym: Imagine a distant future where we're just having fission and fusion back and forth, oscillating, generating energy.

339
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,840
Scott: Maybe, but that sounds a lot like it's going to break the laws of physics, right?

340
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,985
Rym: Well, that means there's entropy.

341
00:21:53,326 --> 00:21:54,632
Rym: There is always entropy.

342
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:55,435
Rym: Do not get me wrong.

343
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,004
Scott: The point is you could conceivably, right?

344
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:04,991
Scott: Depending on what targets we have and what lasers we have, because basically that's what the experiment is now, right?

345
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:10,560
Scott: Is basically keep altering the targets and altering the lasers until you get even better, right?

346
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:18,776
Scott: Because mathematically, to make a power plant out of using this method, you're going to need to get a way better target, right?

347
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,900
Scott: A target that can withstand a lot more.

348
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,157
Rym: Oh yeah, this method is not going to be how we generate usable power with fusion.

349
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:25,960
Rym: This is how we figure it out.

350
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,567
Scott: You also have to realize at the lab where they do this, the lab is operating 24/7.

351
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:37,293
Scott: They can recharge and fire the lasers about like every four to six, eight hours.

352
00:22:37,354 --> 00:22:39,556
Scott: There's like some hours long interval.

353
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:42,820
Scott: Like they can only make an attempt like three, four times a day.

354
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,711
Rym: Yeah, like in a mech, you fire those PPCs.

355
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,160
Rym: You can't just fire them again immediately.

356
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:46,941
Scott: Right.

357
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:57,352
Scott: Mathematically for a power plant using this technology to function, they need to advance this to the point where the lasers fire like 10 times a second, right?

358
00:22:57,673 --> 00:22:59,275
Scott: We're like going pew, pew, pew, pew, pew and just keep.

359
00:22:59,395 --> 00:23:04,160
Scott: basically, you know, think of it as like button mashing and squeezing out energy, right?

360
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:11,045
Rym: So there's a gain factor, which is the line, because basically they have for the first time gotten the gain factor above one.

361
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:15,588
Rym: And this experiment achieved about 1.5 gain factor.

362
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:26,295
Rym: According to this Vox article, which has real citations to generate enough energy to be usable, not counting all the logistics of that, just the like the rate of return.

363
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:29,877
Rym: We need the gain factor to approach 100.

364
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:33,960
Rym: So we got to get three orders of magnitude ish.

365
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:36,566
Rym: Like we got to really move further.

366
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:40,695
Rym: This is this is the equivalent of, hey, we proved that we can make a rocket.

367
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:42,840
Rym: Now let's try to go for the moon someday.

368
00:23:44,941 --> 00:23:45,061
Scott: Yep.

369
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:51,592
Scott: You know, the thing that still concerns me, it's like is, you know, obviously this isn't really very dangerous at all.

370
00:23:51,712 --> 00:23:51,952
Scott: Right.

371
00:23:51,992 --> 00:23:54,737
Scott: Just shooting a very small object with some lasers.

372
00:23:54,937 --> 00:23:55,138
Scott: Right.

373
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:56,340
Scott: Once every eight hours.

374
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:56,580
Scott: Right.

375
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:04,609
Scott: But, you know, if you have an actual fusion power plant, you know, it's like you're basically making a star kind of.

376
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:05,410
Scott: Right.

377
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:14,060
Rym: Stars are by some definitions of stable, extremely stable, and by some definitions of predictable, extremely predictable.

378
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,061
Scott: Yeah.

379
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:15,762
Scott: But it's like.

380
00:24:16,303 --> 00:24:22,174
Scott: I just feel like, you know, if you're making a star, it's like, you know, imagine if, you know, 2001 was 2010 or 2001, where Jupiter became a star or whatever.

381
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,049
Scott: It's like, you know, even that is going to have some negative consequences for Earth.

382
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:33,673
Scott: And that's pretty far away, at least somewhat far away.

383
00:24:34,034 --> 00:24:35,576
Scott: Really close, cosmically speaking.

384
00:24:35,636 --> 00:24:37,820
Scott: But it's still over there.

385
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,090
Scott: I think that's a kind of concern in the sense that making a star on the Earth, it's sort of like, hey, when I set off the fireworks, like you run away from them.

386
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:51,176
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like you're going to make it if we're going to make a sun.

387
00:24:51,196 --> 00:24:53,880
Scott: I feel like we should sort of run away from it.

388
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,823
Rym: On the Earth, the dumbest

389
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:57,463
Scott: thing, like a bad

390
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:13,840
Rym: spot, the dumbest thing any human ever invented, other than the former guys, NFTs, is the Davy Crockett, which was the man per single person launched nuclear artillery that you basically if you fired it, there's no way you would be outside of its radius.

391
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,441
Rym: Yeah.

392
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:27,754
Rym: But I would say, you know, while that is true, like that concern, really, that is the concern of any power generation system, because to generate a lot of power, you have generated a lot of power.

393
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:31,839
Rym: Just like if you have a really good battery, that battery is a grenade.

394
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:32,940
Rym: That battery is full of it.

395
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,725
Scott: There's going to be something that is releasing energy.

396
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:37,386
Scott: Right.

397
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:44,996
Scott: You know, it's like if you have a megawatt power plant, well, there's some megawatt of energy in there that is in some form.

398
00:25:45,036 --> 00:25:48,100
Scott: It could be electrical or it could be gravity.

399
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,785
Rym: What if we build a Dyson ring?

400
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:50,388
Rym: Guess what?

401
00:25:50,428 --> 00:25:53,320
Rym: Now we now we have death rays sending energy back to the Earth.

402
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:53,601
Rym: Like.

403
00:25:53,641 --> 00:26:01,997
Scott: that could be water that's moving so fast that it has, you know, a megawatt of like, you know, if you get hit by that water, it's going to hurt.

404
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:02,498
Scott: Right.

405
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:03,520
Scott: You know, it's dangerous.

406
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:10,694
Scott: Whatever form the energy takes, kinetic or otherwise, it's if it's a large amount and if you touch it, it's going to hurt.

407
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:11,095
Scott: Right.

408
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:13,560
Scott: You have to contain it and control it and stay away from it.

409
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:32,500
Rym: I guess when it comes to generating power, the thing that a lot of people who are anti nuclear power or just have weird or bad opinions about power generation, they always look at one way to generate power and consider it in a vacuum instead of considering it compared to all the other ways we have to generate power because none of them are good.

410
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:37,247
Rym: None of them are like other than wind power, which isn't 100 percent either.

411
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:39,951
Rym: Like nothing is without problems.

412
00:26:40,752 --> 00:26:46,020
Rym: And it's just a matter of which problems are we willing to accept by which ones are necessary.

413
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,202
Rym: It's a balancing act.

414
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:54,114
Rym: And probably for at least the next thousand years, humans are going to generate power via a lot of different mechanisms.

415
00:26:54,194 --> 00:26:57,500
Rym: because we don't really have there's no answer to this question.

416
00:26:58,841 --> 00:27:01,686
Scott: I mean, you know, I think the way I think about it is this.

417
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:02,788
Scott: You're a human being.

418
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:03,208
Scott: Right.

419
00:27:03,228 --> 00:27:06,815
Scott: It's like you need to power your body usually with food.

420
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:07,316
Scott: Right.

421
00:27:07,436 --> 00:27:09,680
Rym: But food comes directly from the sun.

422
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,784
Rym: It just passes through a few hands along the way.

423
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:13,187
Scott: The point is, is I don't see.

424
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:18,199
Scott: I mean, there are some people, but most people are not just eating one food.

425
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:18,680
Scott: Right.

426
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,343
Scott: You need to eat a bunch of different foods.

427
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:30,700
Rym: Also, I want to point out how many people who do eat just one food in the Soil and Fail Reddit are posting about things that are obviously the symptoms of malnutrition.

428
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,401
Scott: Yeah.

429
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:40,193
Scott: But if our society needs energy to function in our industrialized society, at least right.

430
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:44,599
Scott: We can't really be getting it all just from one thing.

431
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,040
Scott: Right.

432
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,503
Scott: We got these different places.

433
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:47,585
Scott: There's different needs.

434
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:47,925
Scott: There's it.

435
00:27:47,986 --> 00:27:48,166
Scott: Right.

436
00:27:48,186 --> 00:27:55,300
Scott: They've got a lot of we got to no matter how many ways we even if we greenify all of our energy on Earth.

437
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:55,500
Scott: Right.

438
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,967
Scott: And only use stop burning dead dinosaur fuels or whatever.

439
00:28:00,629 --> 00:28:02,532
Scott: We're going to have to use more than one kind.

440
00:28:02,552 --> 00:28:04,796
Scott: A little wind there, a little water there.

441
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,198
Scott: I don't know what.

442
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:07,260
Scott: whatever we come up with.

443
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:15,775
Rym: We will definitely need traditional nuclear power, just better, more modern reactors for hundreds of years at minimum.

444
00:28:16,577 --> 00:28:18,260
Scott: Anyway, that's the news.

445
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,682
Rym: Yeah, but it's a huge news.

446
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:21,105
Rym: It's actually a big news.

447
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:28,780
Rym: It's probably one of the most important like energy scientific developments in the modern era.

448
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:29,642
Scott: Yeah.

449
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:35,032
Scott: I mean, how much time was there between like, you know, Thomas Edison has a light bulb and everyone has a light bulb.

450
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,295
Rym: Yeah.

451
00:28:36,555 --> 00:28:38,820
Scott: It's like we've reached the first part.

452
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,683
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

453
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:51,806
Rym: So I was a mountain biker.

454
00:28:51,826 --> 00:29:04,840
Rym: I am most no longer a mountain biker, but I don't know a lot about modern mountain bikes, but I know a comparative a lot relative to modern bikes about 90s era mountain bikes because that's what I mountain bike the most.

455
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:08,986
Rym: And while I had heard of this kind of thing, I never really seen it.

456
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:12,190
Scott: I didn't know it was seen or heard of it before just now.

457
00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:19,460
Rym: But what this is, if you see, if you look at the picture of my thing of the day, you will see a bike that looks like a joke.

458
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,387
Rym: This looks like the kind of bike that some weird YouTube channel will make.

459
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:26,492
Rym: Like, ah, we made a bike out of land.

460
00:29:26,552 --> 00:29:27,294
Rym: How does it ride?

461
00:29:27,394 --> 00:29:28,075
Rym: Terribly.

462
00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:28,736
Rym: Haha.

463
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:29,979
Rym: Square wheeled bike.

464
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:30,720
Rym: Look at this shit.

465
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:42,920
Scott: But I first when I saw the image of it, I said, ah, this is like some horrible old product someone made that was super dangerous and didn't, you know, and was limited and then was taken off the market for being ridiculous.

466
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:52,273
Rym: So the reason I didn't know about this bike or its deal in the 90s is because this was the most expensive, best kind of mountain bike in the world at the time.

467
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:57,060
Rym: Mountain bikes in the 80s and 90s were not like mountain bikes today.

468
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,845
Rym: They were not safe.

469
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:04,895
Rym: Not that modern mountain bikes are safe, but they are much safer than like what I was riding.

470
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:07,120
Rym: This was the top tier.

471
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:12,345
Rym: This was like the fanciest specialist weird mountain bike that the pros would ride.

472
00:30:12,826 --> 00:30:14,688
Rym: This is the slingshot.

473
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:18,252
Rym: It does not have the entire triangle.

474
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:19,853
Rym: You got to look at a picture.

475
00:30:19,893 --> 00:30:26,200
Rym: It's got the rear triangle of the frame, but then the tube under your crotch goes across to the handlebars.

476
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:34,450
Rym: And from there, you've got the fork that goes down to the wheel with the front suspension, that same shadow 90s front suspension that every mountain bike had back then.

477
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:37,134
Rym: And there's no other bar.

478
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:39,577
Rym: There's just a cable holding it together.

479
00:30:39,597 --> 00:30:40,558
Scott: There's no bottom tube.

480
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:42,280
Scott: It's just a cable.

481
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:42,921
Rym: Yep.

482
00:30:43,402 --> 00:30:45,725
Rym: And as a result, the bike flexes a lot.

483
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,747
Rym: And you might think, wouldn't it just snap?

484
00:30:48,048 --> 00:30:50,892
Rym: No, you're thinking about modern bikes made out of like aluminum or carbon.

485
00:30:51,192 --> 00:30:52,674
Rym: This bike's made out of steel.

486
00:30:53,255 --> 00:30:55,298
Rym: So that's actually not a problem.

487
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:56,840
Rym: Steel bikes will flex just fine.

488
00:30:57,641 --> 00:30:58,902
Rym: Uh, watch the video.

489
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:05,207
Rym: It's only 10 minutes long and it goes into extreme detail with someone riding one in the year 2022.

490
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:08,650
Rym: They got one, they restored it and they wrote it.

491
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:11,273
Rym: And it is an amazing mountain bike.

492
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:19,780
Rym: It's actually pretty good even by modern standards because this design has shocking advantages.

493
00:31:20,301 --> 00:31:28,812
Rym: The only reason we don't make bikes like this today is that we developed extremely modern suspensions that could not have been made with material science in the 90s.

494
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:32,296
Rym: And we have developed like modern carbon fiber.

495
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:34,660
Rym: That is like nothing we had in the 90s.

496
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:42,765
Scott: I'm surprised that, you know, with all the different bike events I've been to where people bring out all the weird bikes, I've never seen one of these.

497
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:43,465
Rym: I can tell you why.

498
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:43,865
Rym: the video.

499
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:45,166
Rym: actually I watched this video twice.

500
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:45,727
Rym: It was so good.

501
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:50,170
Rym: The reason why is that one, there's a carbon fiber part on this.

502
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,252
Rym: And if you remember, this is from the 90s.

503
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:55,273
Rym: Yeah, that shit is dodgy.

504
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,775
Rym: If it breaks, you got to make like a custom one.

505
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:04,440
Rym: But two, there's a critical piece that is like the flex plate that connects this thing together.

506
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,642
Rym: Not the cable, but like this flex plate.

507
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:08,544
Rym: It's made out of a weird material.

508
00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:12,568
Rym: It's basically irreplaceable and it degrades over time.

509
00:32:12,988 --> 00:32:24,660
Rym: So you've got to like cut and scrape the old one out, acquire or make an equivalent flex plate to replace it, put it in this bike and trust it not to kill you.

510
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:38,520
Rym: So even the guy riding the bike in the video is like kind of afraid the bike's gonna hurt him the whole time because even though it was vouched for, it's kind of hard to make these bikes safe and nobody's making parts for these things.

511
00:32:39,401 --> 00:32:39,541
Scott: Yep.

512
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:41,103
Scott: All right.

513
00:32:41,424 --> 00:32:53,280
Scott: So thing of the day in New York City, down on Astor Place in Manhattan on the west side, west-ish, east-ish, I guess it's technically east, but whatever.

514
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,380
Rym: By the big black cube.

515
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:58,512
Scott: Yeah, it's near-ish to the cube, like a block or two away from there.

516
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:00,620
Scott: In an NYU area, right?

517
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:09,749
Scott: I guess it's definitely, I guess it wouldn't, even though it's not super close to the water, I guess it would still technically be East Village.

518
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:11,932
Scott: Anyway, there's a haircut place.

519
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:18,400
Scott: You go down these stairs, you have to go down, like you're on the sidewalk and it says "Aster Barber" or whatever is a sign.

520
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:26,560
Scott: You have to go downstairs like you're going in a basement and there's a haircutting place and that place has been there for fucking ever, right?

521
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:36,492
Scott: In fact, when I first worked in New York City and we lived in Beacon, I would go get my haircut there because I had hair.

522
00:33:37,153 --> 00:33:41,600
Scott: There weren't any good haircut places in the Beacon area and it was conveniently near my work.

523
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,507
Rym: Yeah, back then, you know where I got my haircut?

524
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,679
Rym: At Grand Central because it was really convenient even though it caused- I did that one time.

525
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,719
Rym: It caused like four times the normal haircut place.

526
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:50,199
Scott: That place isn't there anymore.

527
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,058
Rym: No, it's not.

528
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:56,789
Scott: But anyway, so this place is like a really special kind of place, right?

529
00:33:56,829 --> 00:34:02,140
Scott: It's like when I was a kid growing up, I would go to a barber and it was like three old guys, right?

530
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:07,380
Scott: And they had three seats and then they had one seat that was like an old metal car for the kids to sit in.

531
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,547
Scott: And then they had a TV playing some sport or whatever.

532
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:16,630
Scott: In the city, it's usually soccer.

533
00:34:17,312 --> 00:34:23,580
Scott: And then they got all those old timey seats and a bunch of old magazines like golf magazines or whatever, right?

534
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,163
Scott: You know the kind of place, right?

535
00:34:25,444 --> 00:34:27,530
Scott: A white guy barber shop.

536
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,717
Scott: It's completely different from a black guy barber shop, right?

537
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:31,520
Scott: Which is even cooler.

538
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:38,534
Scott: But, you know, anyway, so this place though, it's a lot like that, right?

539
00:34:38,654 --> 00:34:41,719
Scott: Except it's an everybody barber shop, right?

540
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:45,888
Scott: It's like every kind of age, every kind of person, right?

541
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,652
Scott: And it's enormous.

542
00:34:47,831 --> 00:34:51,679
Scott: Like it's not just like this one straight line of chairs, like a handful of them.

543
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:58,326
Scott: It's like this big giant open room with no walls other than the surrounding walls, right?

544
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:01,890
Scott: And chairs and mirrors just scattered all about, right?

545
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:12,040
Scott: And it's like you feel almost like you're going into like a hotel or some shit because you don't, you know, maybe you've been going there a long time and you know who your person is, right?

546
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,148
Scott: You know where their seat is, you know what their hours are and you can find them.

547
00:35:16,469 --> 00:35:22,100
Scott: But usually you're going up to the front desk and there's a person there who's like managing, right?

548
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,752
Scott: And they got everyone's appointments and you're like, you know, you might say, "Oh, I want to see so and

549
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:27,093
Scott: so.".

550
00:35:27,314 --> 00:35:28,838
Scott: And they'll be like, "Oh, they're not here right now.

551
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:29,058
Scott: They're

552
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:29,379
Scott: busy.".

553
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,119
Rym: Would you be willing to accept Joey Jojo?

554
00:35:32,821 --> 00:35:33,122
Scott: Right.

555
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:41,360
Scott: It's like there's so many barbers down there, you know, different hairdressers and whatever with different, you know, specialties and whatever, you know.

556
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,548
Scott: But usually if you've never been there before, you just be like, "Hey, I want my

557
00:35:44,568 --> 00:35:44,990
Scott: haircut.".

558
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,760
Scott: And they look at you and they figure out who would be good for your hair, right?

559
00:35:49,161 --> 00:35:50,584
Scott: And they don't do this out loud.

560
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:58,180
Scott: Like the person at the front just looks at you and then looks at the schedule and who's available and they're like, "Go over there to number whatever," right?

561
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,747
Scott: You know, and there'll be a person there to cut your hair, right?

562
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:08,280
Scott: You know, and all the bar, you know, the hairdressers, they got, you know, they really personalize out their little zone, right?

563
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,269
Scott: They got, you know, photos and all kinds of shit going on, right?

564
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:14,960
Scott: So it's a really a special kind of place going on there.

565
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:23,840
Scott: And mostly NYU students, but all kinds of people go in there, you know, famous people, people who don't have a lot of money, people who do have a lot of money.

566
00:36:24,502 --> 00:36:27,152
Scott: Anyone in New York who needs a haircut, it's a place to go.

567
00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:29,080
Scott: They don't rip you off there, right?

568
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,655
Scott: And so this place during the pan doodle almost went OOB, right?

569
00:36:35,755 --> 00:36:37,460
Scott: Which would have been a travesty.

570
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,320
Rym: I mean, I didn't get any haircuts during the entire pan doodle.

571
00:36:41,421 --> 00:36:41,682
Scott: Right.

572
00:36:41,863 --> 00:36:45,719
Scott: Not people weren't getting haircuts at all, but also, you know, people weren't there.

573
00:36:45,987 --> 00:36:46,180
Scott: Yeah.

574
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,908
Scott: Not commuting to work, students not studenting, right?

575
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:52,520
Scott: It's like, even if you were getting a haircut, you weren't getting a haircut and asked to replace it in Manhattan.

576
00:36:55,181 --> 00:37:01,440
Scott: And so that would have been real sad, but this cultural institution was saved by somebody.

577
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,000
Scott: Thank you, person who saved it with your money.

578
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:04,700
Rym: A sophomore.

579
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:05,885
Scott: Yep.

580
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,579
Scott: You were great.

581
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:13,580
Scott: But then now that, you know, NYU is back doing its thing, right?

582
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,500
Scott: Times are not normal, but, you know, it's recovered somewhat economically, at least.

583
00:37:20,643 --> 00:37:26,700
Scott: A student at the NYU, right, came in and they did something amazing.

584
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,143
Scott: I don't know.

585
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:28,620
Scott: I know I never thought of this before.

586
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:39,960
Scott: Somehow they arranged to basically, you know, at night when this place is closed, it's a big old room, right, with barber chairs, but nothing else.

587
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:42,559
Scott: Just fucking has some parties down there.

588
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,180
Scott: And the owners is like, well, no one's cutting hair down there at that time.

589
00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:48,659
Scott: It's going to make us money.

590
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:50,719
Scott: Why the fuck wouldn't we do this?

591
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:52,918
Scott: It's like the perfect place to do this.

592
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:55,680
Scott: What would be the objection?

593
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,384
Scott: Nothing.

594
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:57,499
Scott: It's not like bothering anyone.

595
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,040
Scott: No one lives there, right?

596
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:00,587
Scott: It's in a basement.

597
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:02,600
Scott: It's legal, right?

598
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:08,040
Scott: And so sure enough, they're having parties down there now, which is pretty freaking awesome.

599
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:12,620
Scott: And the New York Times did a little, you know, I guess their one day strike is over.

600
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:15,399
Scott: So it's okay to read them for now.

601
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,940
Scott: And they did a little piece talking about the parties going on down there.

602
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:26,440
Scott: Sometimes, you know, the attendance is waxing and waning based on, you know, what day it is, right, stuff like that.

603
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,011
Scott: But they're getting turned out.

604
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:30,740
Scott: They're getting big time DJs down there.

605
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,940
Scott: It's like, that's pretty awesome.

606
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:36,260
Scott: Why didn't that, that should have been going on for a long time.

607
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,460
Scott: Why has that only started recently?

608
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,800
Rym: I love in this article the profiles of the people.

609
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:40,819
Rym: Because they are.

610
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,760
Scott: Whoever, whoever came up with this idea, genius, you're going far in life, right?

611
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:51,000
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book, Alif the Unseen.

612
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,100
Rym: It's pretty good.

613
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,880
Scott: I'm making a lot of progress.

614
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,552
Rym: I am too.

615
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:56,639
Scott: I have, I still see Alif though, so I'm not sure.

616
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,660
Rym: Well, you know what, you know who doesn't see Alif, at least as far as I've gotten?

617
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,359
Rym: The government.

618
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:04,299
Rym: The government does not see Alif yet.

619
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,900
Rym: And that is- Yeah, they're definitely trying.

620
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:14,439
Rym: Alif is, this book is exactly what it was described to be.

621
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:23,098
Rym: Which was, "An unnamed Middle Eastern security state, a young Arab Indian hacker, protects watched groups from surveillance and tries to stay out of

622
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:23,439
Rym: trouble.".

623
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,498
Rym: Yada, yada, yada, jinn.

624
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:33,180
Scott: The D-J-I-N-N genie kind, not the drinking or card game kind.

625
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:42,440
Rym: What I do appreciate is, I still am convinced that the framing story is 100% going to be directly relevant to the details of what happens.

626
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:49,220
Scott: Yeah, so my theory of it being a Princess Bride deal, I was wrong.

627
00:39:52,702 --> 00:39:56,600
Scott: It is not a Princess Bride framing story, it is just part of the story.

628
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,100
Rym: Yep.

629
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,078
Rym: That's just, that old man knew some magic and- Yep.

630
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:05,760
Rym: So this is good, read it, we'll do the show in January or February at the latest.

631
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,899
Rym: Definitely by, like, the first week of February at the rate that I'm reading it.

632
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:16,319
Scott: Yeah, I'm reading it, you know, every day or so-ish, and I'm 30 to 40 percent-ish done, so.

633
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:24,840
Rym: Otherwise, we will likely be at PAX East with a couple of panels, but do not expect us to be hanging out there the whole weekend.

634
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,539
Rym: Still seems a little too soon for that.

635
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:40,479
Rym: Also, it's a four-day con, and considering most of the people we know are still going to avoid cons and it's going to be fully masked, I can't imagine I would have a lot to do if it was just me and Scott for four full days in Boston at a PAX.

636
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:46,000
Scott: I think we could do a lot of, you know, video produce, you know, content producing stuff.

637
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,660
Rym: We could, and we'll see.

638
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:59,079
Rym: It's really going to depend on what panel or panels we do and when they're scheduled, and who else is going, and what the situation is in terms of the poop chart, and then we're going to decide what to do.

639
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,115
Scott: Yep.

640
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,738
Scott: Alright, so.

641
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:01,891
Scott: Yeah.

642
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,294
Scott: Hanukkah?

643
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,739
Rym: Yeah, Hanukkah!

644
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,540
Scott: So, Rym probably doesn't know anything about Hanukkah.

645
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:18,300
Rym: So, you know what I know about Hanukkah is, one, as a kid, like, to be really blunt, I grew up, especially in, like, middle and high school, in extremely white suburbs in Michigan, like, around Detroit.

646
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:22,720
Rym: So, there weren't a lot of Jewish people in my schools.

647
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:29,920
Rym: Like, in high school, there were five or six Jewish kids, and I knew most of them, and that was it in the whole high school.

648
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:30,810
Scott: Yep.

649
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,920
Scott: So, I mean, in my high school, or me, I guess, in all of my schooling, right?

650
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:39,020
Rym: I mean, my elementary school didn't have any Jewish kids because it was the Catholic school.

651
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,060
Rym: You had to be Catholic or lie about it.

652
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,277
Scott: Oh, sure.

653
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:47,360
Scott: But, you know, when I went to school, yeah, it's like, Jews were definitely a minority, right?

654
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:50,560
Scott: It was mostly, you know, white Christian peoples, right?

655
00:41:51,041 --> 00:42:00,729
Scott: But, the number of Jews in the area where I grew up, and Jewish kids I grew up with percentage-wise, it was much greater than the percentage in the

656
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:01,150
Scott: U.S.,

657
00:42:01,231 --> 00:42:04,040
Scott: and much, much greater than the percentage in the world, right?

658
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,022
Scott: In the entire, in the

659
00:42:05,162 --> 00:42:05,603
Scott: U.S.,

660
00:42:06,205 --> 00:42:10,434
Scott: right, about, like, two and a half percent of the U.S.

661
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:13,300
Scott: population of adults are Jews, right?

662
00:42:13,462 --> 00:42:14,399
Scott: It's a really small number.

663
00:42:14,981 --> 00:42:20,092
Scott: And, in terms of the world population, it's something like .2%, like, not even 1% of people are Jews, right?

664
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,940
Scott: So, but, where I grew up, it was probably, I don't know, it might have even been 5%?

665
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,284
Scott: Who knows?

666
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:30,560
Scott: I don't have, I can't count, right?

667
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:30,903
Rym: Yeah, you had 5%.

668
00:42:30,903 --> 00:42:33,920
Rym: I had 5.

669
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,740
Scott: But, anyway, so, Hanukkah, right, it's like, when I was a kid, it was just sort of like, hey, you know, we're Jews.

670
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:43,000
Scott: They're not, right?

671
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,880
Scott: They got Christmas, we got Hanukkah, right?

672
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:50,280
Scott: I didn't understand, you know, the history, or really care, or anything like that.

673
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:51,799
Scott: I was like, that's just how it was.

674
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,379
Scott: And I thought, I was getting a good deal.

675
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,340
Scott: I was like, I got eight fucking days, your shitty Christmas, only one day.

676
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:04,100
Scott: I was like, you know, and I was thinking, I got eight days, I'm getting eight presents.

677
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,100
Scott: Sure, you know, obviously, you're not gonna get eight bomb presents, right?

678
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:13,960
Scott: You're just gonna get like six, you know, six okay presents, a good present, and a great present, right?

679
00:43:14,786 --> 00:43:16,180
Scott: Unless you're rich or some shit, right?

680
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,552
Scott: You're not getting eight, you know, Nintendo games.

681
00:43:18,572 --> 00:43:20,000
Scott: That's not happening, right?

682
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,740
Scott: You get one Nintendo game, maybe a Lego, and then some other stuff.

683
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,040
Rym: Every now and then, we'd have a blowout Christmas, but they were rare.

684
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:35,640
Rym: Like, the year the Super Nintendo came out, we got the Super Nintendo, and every launch game was basically the Christmas gift.

685
00:43:35,861 --> 00:43:42,980
Rym: Every single launch game, but the next Christmas after that was somewhat paltry, because that was a very expensive Christmas.

686
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,280
Scott: Yeah, I mean, but then, it's like, the whole time, it's like, you know, I wasn't actually going over to other people's and seeing their Christmases.

687
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,120
Scott: I was seeing TV Christmases, right?

688
00:43:54,283 --> 00:43:57,460
Scott: I went to some kid's house, right, that lived down the street.

689
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,220
Scott: I went over to his house, like, late on Christmas day.

690
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:03,279
Rym: There were more than eight gifts under that tree, weren't there?

691
00:44:04,203 --> 00:44:05,800
Scott: And I was like, what the fuck is this bullshit?

692
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:12,480
Scott: Why, how come under your tree, there is, like, a full set of Marvel Super Hero cards?

693
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,000
Scott: Like, the whole fucking set, right?

694
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:16,219
Scott: When we were kids, like, there was a lot of small gifts.

695
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,980
Scott: And, I was like, that, I'm like, that alone is like, is like a full present.

696
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:25,700
Scott: I'm like, and you got, like, two Nintendo games under there, and you got, like, a football, and I'm like, what is this?

697
00:44:25,941 --> 00:44:27,980
Scott: This is Christmas, you got one day, you got one thing.

698
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,854
Scott: What the fuck is this spoiling bullshit going on?

699
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:42,360
Rym: If your parents were middle class, that tree would be absolutely stuffed to capacity underneath and spilling out into the living room with piles of gimps.

700
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,680
Scott: If I was having Christmas, kids get one thing each, right?

701
00:44:47,841 --> 00:44:49,080
Scott: One present per person.

702
00:44:49,802 --> 00:44:51,660
Scott: One, right, you're one person, you get one present.

703
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,420
Scott: That's how it works.

704
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:55,880
Scott: Santa got room in there for more than one thing per person.

705
00:44:57,681 --> 00:45:06,960
Scott: Okay, but in terms of actual Hanukkah, right, for anyone out there who doesn't know the story of Hanukkah, you can read it on the internet, but I will summarize it for you, right?

706
00:45:08,762 --> 00:45:12,720
Scott: The Jews, right, were in Israel, and there was the Temple, right?

707
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:25,320
Scott: So, if you know the Western Wall, the Wailing Wall, where the Jews pray in Jerusalem, supposedly, that wall was merely a minor piece of a retaining wall of the Temple, right?

708
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,543
Scott: The Temple, right?

709
00:45:26,563 --> 00:45:38,979
Rym: The literal, giant temple where it was fucking enormous, I don't know, I can't really believe- Now, of course, the historiosity of that edge is more into a bumper sticker that says, "My other car is a

710
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:39,340
Rym: Ferrari.".

711
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:46,020
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, can I really believe that the Temple was as big as they say it was, right?

712
00:45:47,504 --> 00:45:53,660
Scott: It's like the size that they claim it to be would be like greater than like any construction, right?

713
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:59,500
Scott: Greater than prayer, whatever, but anyway, they believe that, you know, that Temple was the place, right?

714
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:09,180
Scott: After the Jews wandered around, right, leaving Egypt, which never happened, you know, they went to Israel, in Jerusalem, they built the Temple.

715
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,309
Scott: It was actually the second Temple.

716
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:13,600
Scott: By the time of Hanukkah, it was the second Temple, right?

717
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,880
Scott: The first Temple was, they built and destroyed, and then they made another one.

718
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:21,680
Scott: And the Temple was, it's not like a Temple, like the one you have in your neighborhood, right?

719
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:28,760
Scott: It was the Temple, which is the place where you could literally sacrifice goats and God would receive them.

720
00:46:29,342 --> 00:46:31,755
Scott: And it's like, you could talk to God in that Temple.

721
00:46:31,795 --> 00:46:32,740
Scott: That was the one, right?

722
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,420
Scott: It's like, he wouldn't listen to you if you were in some other Temple, right?

723
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,451
Scott: It's like, this was the place, right?

724
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:39,220
Scott: Like a holy, important place.

725
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:45,680
Scott: Anyway, obviously, the truth of that and the truth of the Hanukkah story greatly in question.

726
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:52,339
Rym: Yeah, the Archaeological Evidence section of Wikipedia on this Temple is three paragraphs long, total, so...

727
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,504
Scott: Yeah.

728
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:58,339
Scott: Anyway, but, you know, clearly there was something there, because a piece of it is still there.

729
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:05,540
Scott: And the second Temple, the story of Hanukkah, the second Temple was there, right?

730
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,300
Scott: And, you know, the Jews, there was this Jewish tribe called the Maccabees, right?

731
00:47:11,501 --> 00:47:15,120
Scott: They were sort of like, you know, warrior Jews, I guess, something like that, right?

732
00:47:15,941 --> 00:47:19,272
Scott: And the Assyrians, or just Syrians, right?

733
00:47:19,613 --> 00:47:21,660
Scott: You know, they were warring in those times.

734
00:47:22,682 --> 00:47:24,600
Scott: And, you know, the Jews are resisting.

735
00:47:27,021 --> 00:47:33,360
Scott: And the story goes, right, that, you know, in the Temple, they wanted to keep the lights on, right?

736
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:35,618
Scott: They didn't have enough oil to keep the lights on.

737
00:47:36,722 --> 00:47:45,040
Scott: And somehow, miraculously, the oil that should have lasted, like, not long at all, lasted for eight days, right?

738
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,059
Scott: In some sort of miracle that clearly didn't happen.

739
00:47:49,443 --> 00:47:51,597
Scott: And the Jews won, right, in the war.

740
00:47:52,942 --> 00:47:55,640
Scott: And so that's the story of Hanukkah, right?

741
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:01,140
Scott: The reality is, is that in terms of Jewish holidays, Hanukkah doesn't rank, right?

742
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:08,280
Scott: It's like, it is not, like, the actual Jewish holidays that are, like, serious, right?

743
00:48:09,021 --> 00:48:11,456
Scott: Are like, you know, Rosh Hashanah, Rosh Hashanah.

744
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,888
Scott: I always say Rosh Hashanah.

745
00:48:14,028 --> 00:48:15,880
Scott: I guess I can tell this, you know why I say Rosh Hashanah?

746
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,104
Rym: Yeah, we've talked about this at length.

747
00:48:18,124 --> 00:48:23,078
Rym: The problem is, I say it that way because of you, because we find it funny, just like you mispronounce "sod-er".

748
00:48:23,962 --> 00:48:25,580
Scott: Well, do you know why I mispronounce it, though?

749
00:48:26,845 --> 00:48:28,340
Rym: Oh, you know, I don't actually remember.

750
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:32,059
Scott: So the reason I mispronounce "sold-er", right, is because...

751
00:48:32,401 --> 00:48:35,820
Rym: Oh, because you learned to "sod-er" from that guy who said it that way.

752
00:48:36,001 --> 00:48:37,439
Scott: From an Australian guy, right?

753
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:54,120
Scott: But, so when I was in high school in the Jewish youth group, one of the youth group people had his brother, I think, right, or father, someone, was a Vietnam veteran who was a Jew who came to tell us, you know, about, you know, the old, the Vietnam times.

754
00:48:55,024 --> 00:48:56,840
Scott: He had his shit together, mostly, right?

755
00:48:57,422 --> 00:49:03,000
Scott: His body wasn't in great shape, but his mind was, you know, pretty good considering the circumstances, right?

756
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,820
Scott: You know, he went to Vietnam and his goal was to live and come back, right?

757
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:10,560
Scott: And that's how he, he was in charge of his little platoon or whatever.

758
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:17,400
Scott: And that's what, you know, when he had like, you know, gung-ho guys who wanted to, you know, kill them all, he kicked those people out, right?

759
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,685
Scott: So he was, that's, I think that's how he made it through.

760
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:26,060
Scott: But anyway, he was a Jew and he got leave, you know, legitimately for Rosh Hashanah, right?

761
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:38,040
Scott: And he told us that when he was, you know, walking around on leave, some MPs approached him and were like, "Hey, you know, you're supposed to, you know, you're really on leave, show us your papers," right?

762
00:49:38,461 --> 00:49:40,731
Scott: So he showed him the papers, which were legitimate papers.

763
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:42,760
Scott: that said he's on leave for Rosh Hashanah.

764
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:44,771
Rym: Oh, you did, I remember this.

765
00:49:44,852 --> 00:49:46,040
Rym: You did tell me this story.

766
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:49,153
Scott: And the MP is like, "What's this Rosh Hashanah

767
00:49:49,173 --> 00:49:49,494
Scott: business?".

768
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:55,515
Scott: And so that's why I always say Rosh Hashanah, even though it's Rosh Hashanah.

769
00:49:56,438 --> 00:49:56,900
Scott: So anyway.

770
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:03,080
Rym: I did say Chipotle at work last week because I ended up eating, I ate at Chipotle.

771
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:11,040
Scott: And someone just straight up literally next to, you work literally next to Los Tacos Numero Uno and you went to Chipotle?

772
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,990
Rym: I was on the other side of town doing something.

773
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,920
Rym: I was not, believe me, believe me.

774
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,457
Scott: I haven't eaten at a Chipotle in years.

775
00:50:16,538 --> 00:50:16,740
Scott: Anyway.

776
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:17,924
Rym: I was up at the other office.

777
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:22,539
Rym: If I was at the 120 Park office, I would have been at Los Tacos Numero Uno.

778
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,470
Scott: Rosh Hashanah, correctly pronounced Rosh Hashanah, is like top holiday.

779
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,460
Scott: Yom Kippur also top like in terms of seriousness, Passover, right?

780
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:37,480
Scott: And some Jews will perhaps accurately tell you the most important Jewish holiday is Shabbos every week, right?

781
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:43,640
Scott: You know, every Friday night through, you know, Saturday night is like the actual, the most important Jewish holiday.

782
00:50:43,962 --> 00:50:45,875
Scott: Hanukkah doesn't rank in Jewish holidays.

783
00:50:45,895 --> 00:50:46,660
Scott: It's not that important.

784
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:56,860
Rym: But it happened to be around the same time as the dominant white Christian holiday that completely overpowers all American pop culture every year around that time.

785
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,979
Rym: It has for a very long time.

786
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:05,500
Scott: The same way that the Jesus birthday happened to be sometime around the Saturnalia and the pagan Yule, right?

787
00:51:05,681 --> 00:51:08,697
Scott: It's like, so what happened is some decades ago, right?

788
00:51:09,761 --> 00:51:14,900
Scott: You know, when all the Christian kids are getting their presents and doing their Christmas, the Jews were like, yeah, you know what?

789
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,031
Scott: We got the Sonicas pretty close, right?

790
00:51:17,071 --> 00:51:18,780
Scott: I'm sure you could look up actually how this happened.

791
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,820
Scott: Maybe someone did it on purpose, like with Kwanzaa, which is on purpose.

792
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:30,700
Rym: Well, that was probably Hanukkah Harry, just like the real, you know, the saint that Santa Claus was based on.

793
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,959
Rym: Maybe Hanukkah Harry was real.

794
00:51:32,907 --> 00:51:33,440
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

795
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:42,520
Rym: Hanukkah Harry, who is the name we now give to whoever, started purposefully conflating Hanukkah with those holidays to give the Jewish kids something in pop culture.

796
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:54,500
Scott: Yeah, but you know, Hanukkah just became like, you know, the thing for Jews to celebrate during the holiday season so they could get presents for their kids, capitalism, you know, not feeling left out, etc.

797
00:51:56,362 --> 00:52:14,280
Scott: And I think that's sort of like, you know, every, I guess, you know, I guess not every, but like lots of different cultures and religions have done sort of the same thing, which is like, yeah, around the December times, you know, they do something even if they didn't originally have something, right?

798
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:19,100
Rym: See, if I was making a new religion now, like say something bad happens and I have to form a cult.

799
00:52:19,301 --> 00:52:21,234
Rym: Yeah, like I would like that's probably my go to.

800
00:52:21,314 --> 00:52:22,180
Rym: if society collapsed.

801
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:31,720
Rym: As I've said many times in my life, I would make that holiday in February because the idea for I would have is February is when you're sick of this shit.

802
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:32,944
Rym: It's the coldest.

803
00:52:32,964 --> 00:52:33,871
Scott: February sucks ass.

804
00:52:33,931 --> 00:52:35,199
Scott: It's when we need a holiday the most.

805
00:52:35,622 --> 00:52:37,600
Scott: And all we got is shitty fake Valentine's Day.

806
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,500
Rym: February should be the month of don't do anything.

807
00:52:42,461 --> 00:52:43,344
Rym: Forget a day of rest.

808
00:52:43,364 --> 00:52:44,347
Rym: We got a month of rest.

809
00:52:44,508 --> 00:52:45,331
Rym: That's how I do it.

810
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:48,280
Rym: That's how my cult will operate after the apocalypse.

811
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:49,740
Scott: Yeah.

812
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,568
Scott: And I'll just say, right, you know, as as a Jew.

813
00:52:52,588 --> 00:52:53,050
Scott: Right.

814
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:56,580
Scott: It's like, you know, when I looked around my town, there was plenty of Hanukkah going on.

815
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:56,861
Scott: Right.

816
00:52:56,881 --> 00:53:01,740
Scott: Because we had a disproportionate number of Jews relative to the world and national population.

817
00:53:03,101 --> 00:53:09,980
Scott: But, you know, in the I didn't realize until later on like how little Jewishness there was around everywhere else.

818
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,361
Scott: Right.

819
00:53:10,924 --> 00:53:13,755
Scott: And so I perhaps didn't appreciate right full.

820
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,020
Scott: I did appreciate somewhat.

821
00:53:15,301 --> 00:53:15,523
Scott: Right.

822
00:53:15,623 --> 00:53:18,599
Scott: But I didn't you know, I should have appreciated even more than I did.

823
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,082
Scott: Right.

824
00:53:19,102 --> 00:53:22,678
Scott: It's like when I saw like Hanukkah stuff on TV or something, I'd be like, oh, look at that.

825
00:53:22,959 --> 00:53:23,100
Scott: Right.

826
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,102
Scott: Oh, we got some.

827
00:53:24,263 --> 00:53:24,544
Scott: Right.

828
00:53:24,905 --> 00:53:29,720
Scott: But I should have been perhaps two or three times more excited about that because there's not a lot.

829
00:53:30,101 --> 00:53:31,124
Rym: Yeah.

830
00:53:31,325 --> 00:53:35,360
Scott: I mean, Rugrats was like the one thing that had a Hanukkah and we were like, hell yes.

831
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:40,199
Rym: That and Adam Sandler's song, actually, like there's a reason why that song is a Jew.

832
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,021
Scott: Yeah.

833
00:53:41,061 --> 00:53:45,060
Rym: But that song pierced non-Jewish pop culture.

834
00:53:47,122 --> 00:53:48,326
Rym: Like people know that song.

835
00:53:48,406 --> 00:53:49,069
Rym: I'm not Jewish.

836
00:53:49,209 --> 00:53:50,032
Rym: I knew that song.

837
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:52,220
Rym: I know all the words to that song.

838
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:54,893
Scott: That song was a big deal in 1990, whatever.

839
00:53:54,933 --> 00:53:55,114
Scott: Right.

840
00:53:57,142 --> 00:54:10,520
Rym: In Catholic school, funnily enough, unlike a lot of other Christian denominations, like being pretending to be Catholic as a young atheist in a Catholic school, the school actually did a better job than a lot of other schools of teaching about other religions.

841
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,948
Rym: And they would do like a Hanukkah thing every year.

842
00:54:13,429 --> 00:54:16,560
Rym: But it was very simple and stereotypical.

843
00:54:17,001 --> 00:54:18,808
Rym: We'd all make dreidels, but we didn't.

844
00:54:18,868 --> 00:54:20,515
Rym: actually they didn't explain what the dreidel was.

845
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:21,780
Rym: We just make them gambling.

846
00:54:22,983 --> 00:54:24,186
Rym: They did not explain that.

847
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:29,420
Rym: And they would give us gelt, not really explaining, not really delicious, worse than Hershey's.

848
00:54:29,922 --> 00:54:32,720
Scott: But at least it comes in fun, gold foil wrappers.

849
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:38,540
Rym: And usually we'd have the advent calendar, but we would also do the menorah in the Catholic school.

850
00:54:40,161 --> 00:54:40,361
Scott: Yeah.

851
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:48,360
Scott: You know, the something about, you know, the menorah, it's like there's certain like the specific candle you put in the menorah.

852
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,343
Scott: You buy this box.

853
00:54:49,464 --> 00:54:49,665
Scott: Right.

854
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:54,040
Scott: And it's like this like, you know, I at least I recognize the box.

855
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,119
Scott: Like it's like that's the only Hanukkah candle is the one that comes in that box.

856
00:54:57,762 --> 00:54:59,167
Scott: I forget I forget the name of it.

857
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,540
Scott: What's the name of the stupid candle?

858
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:04,466
Scott: I'm doing a Google search.

859
00:55:04,808 --> 00:55:07,080
Scott: There's other brands nowadays that have taken over.

860
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:07,702
Scott: Right.

861
00:55:08,144 --> 00:55:11,197
Scott: But there's one specific one that's like the real one.

862
00:55:11,217 --> 00:55:11,800
Scott: Right.

863
00:55:12,522 --> 00:55:12,742
Rym: Yeah.

864
00:55:12,802 --> 00:55:13,143
Rym: I've seen.

865
00:55:13,203 --> 00:55:20,880
Rym: I've seen, you know, because New York, very Jewish city, a lot of there's like everyone's got Christmas and Hanukkah stuff out, like very visibly.

866
00:55:21,681 --> 00:55:31,140
Rym: And in a lot of capital markets, like firms in their lobby, they'll usually have an extremely stylized to the point of almost being unrecognizable menorah.

867
00:55:31,941 --> 00:55:32,081
Scott: Yeah.

868
00:55:32,181 --> 00:55:32,642
Scott: All right.

869
00:55:32,702 --> 00:55:34,606
Scott: I found the box, but the box actually.

870
00:55:34,626 --> 00:55:41,280
Scott: I guess the reason that I never had a name for this particular box is because it doesn't have a brand name on it.

871
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:48,200
Scott: It just says, you know, 44 twist candles, twisted candles made in Israel, Hanukkah candles, kosher.

872
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:48,981
Scott: Right.

873
00:55:49,121 --> 00:55:52,580
Scott: Product of Tel Aviv, Israel, telephone number.

874
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,742
Scott: Forty four candles.

875
00:55:53,903 --> 00:55:54,123
Scott: Right.

876
00:55:54,484 --> 00:56:01,740
Scott: And is this very specific artwork and the candles like they have this wax that smells a specific way and melts it pretty quickly.

877
00:56:01,881 --> 00:56:06,400
Scott: Actually, they don't last very long for a holiday about oil that lasted too long.

878
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,240
Scott: The Hanukkah candles sure don't last long at all.

879
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,454
Rym: It's to remind you that you like.

880
00:56:10,474 --> 00:56:11,300
Scott: you like that shit.

881
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,668
Scott: You like that shit after dinner.

882
00:56:12,688 --> 00:56:14,560
Scott: That shit's melted before you go to bed.

883
00:56:14,861 --> 00:56:17,520
Scott: Yeah, I mean, well, it's good because you won't create a fire hazard.

884
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,713
Rym: Catholic churches, like really traditional ones.

885
00:56:19,753 --> 00:56:20,700
Rym: There's a big candle.

886
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,360
Rym: I forget all the details of why we have it or why they have it.

887
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,880
Scott: Is it like the votive candle or whatever?

888
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,420
Rym: No, votive candles are a different thing.

889
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:26,741
Rym: That's.

890
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:30,280
Rym: that's the thing you see in movies where like someone lights a candle for someone who's dead.

891
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,258
Rym: And usually there's a dramatic scene around it.

892
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:35,059
Rym: There's movies where like the assassin will go.

893
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,872
Scott: Jews have the candle for someone who's dead.

894
00:56:36,912 --> 00:56:37,840
Scott: It's the yahrzeit candle.

895
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,640
Rym: Yeah, but there's another candle that it's just the same candle forever.

896
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,161
Rym: Like it'll.

897
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:46,680
Rym: basically if you just lit it and left it lit, it will burn for fucking ever.

898
00:56:47,402 --> 00:56:51,460
Rym: And they light it like it's special times and they keep the same candle forever.

899
00:56:53,462 --> 00:57:06,780
Rym: But I found something great just skimming through the Wikipedia article on it, because I have associations mostly hanging out with you of like one, celebrating in quotes Christmas by just going out and getting Chinese food, which feels like a very Jewish holiday tradition.

900
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,339
Rym: Go and see a movie.

901
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,520
Rym: But also, you know, food like latkes.

902
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,599
Rym: We'd always like made latkes around this time of year.

903
00:57:14,162 --> 00:57:17,280
Scott: Well, the reason you make the latkes for Hanukkah is because it's a holiday about oil.

904
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,858
Scott: So you got to keep fry shit, right?

905
00:57:19,161 --> 00:57:21,060
Rym: So there's a section in the Wikipedia article.

906
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:21,860
Rym: There's a paragraph.

907
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:28,260
Rym: You're going to read it really quick that talks about what Jewish cultures in other parts of the world, like.

908
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:31,620
Rym: what is their go to food around Hanukkah?

909
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:38,019
Rym: Indian Jews traditionally consume a galab jamun, which is a like fried dough thing that I actually am a big fan of.

910
00:57:39,725 --> 00:57:40,277
Rym: Let's see.

911
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,980
Rym: Italian Jews.

912
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:44,140
Rym: Italian Jews eat fried chicken.

913
00:57:44,825 --> 00:57:45,740
Scott: Yeah, it's fried.

914
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,019
Rym: And they make a latke like thing out of ricotta.

915
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:50,384
Scott: Mmm.

916
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,540
Rym: Fratello de riso parrhatica, fried sweet potato pancakes.

917
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,600
Rym: Romanian Jews eat pasta latkes.

918
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,499
Rym: So again, fried.

919
00:57:58,901 --> 00:58:00,259
Rym: You see the theme is holding true.

920
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:01,299
Scott: Oil.

921
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:06,420
Rym: Syrian Jews eat a dish made with pumpkin and bulgur wheat that is similar to latkes.

922
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:08,488
Rym: Mm hmm.

923
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:09,540
Rym: That's the whole paragraph.

924
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,276
Rym: We ran out.

925
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:11,256
Scott: All right.

926
00:58:11,782 --> 00:58:12,040
Scott: But yeah.

927
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,060
Scott: So it's, you know, it's an oil based holiday.

928
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,319
Scott: It's going to have oil based foods.

929
00:58:16,441 --> 00:58:21,340
Rym: I am a fan of oil based foods and I have enjoyed many a Christmas having Chinese food with you and our other friends.

930
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:22,216
Scott: Yeah.

931
00:58:22,641 --> 00:58:28,100
Scott: I mean, the thing about the latke that's most important isn't really the fried potato, which is, you know, a pain in the ass, right?

932
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:30,220
Scott: It's the topping, right?

933
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:32,060
Scott: You got sour cream and you got applesauce.

934
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,019
Scott: And you can also go both at the same time.

935
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,680
Rym: Both at the same time is the pro move.

936
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,420
Scott: A lot of people, you know, but it's some people, they don't like the applesauce.

937
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,799
Scott: Some people don't like sour cream.

938
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,019
Scott: You know, they do it wrong.

939
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:45,040
Rym: Thing is, what we did wrong was frying it wrong.

940
00:58:45,342 --> 00:58:46,619
Rym: We fucking sucked at that.

941
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:48,260
Rym: We know how to cook so much better now.

942
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:57,580
Scott: Listen, if you go to any Jewish family's house for a Hanukkah festivity, there's going to be basically fighting about who's going to fry the latkes.

943
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,280
Scott: Because even if you don't do, it's not hard to make them.

944
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,320
Scott: You shred up a potato on the box grater or your food processor.

945
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:09,840
Rym: And if you know even like the bare basics of cooking with oil, you will not make the mistakes that we made in college.

946
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:10,857
Scott: Right.

947
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,380
Scott: You know, you put some flour and some other stuff in with the potato.

948
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,820
Rym: Also, get the oil hot before you let the potatoes touch it.

949
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,280
Rym: Otherwise, the oil just goes right into the potatoes and they're horrible.

950
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,250
Scott: Yep.

951
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:27,520
Scott: But even if you use the mix, right, which doesn't taste bad at all, instead of doing the potato, it saves you a bit of work.

952
00:59:27,923 --> 00:59:29,460
Scott: You can't avoid the frying part.

953
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:35,140
Scott: And it's like frying them kind of sucks and is like annoying to sit there and baby them and get oil all over yourself.

954
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:38,132
Rym: You got to baby them way more than what I would say.

955
00:59:38,373 --> 00:59:40,060
Rym: you baby a typical fried dish.

956
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:40,836
Scott: Yeah.

957
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,899
Scott: So there's always going to be some sort of argument about who's going to do it.

958
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:46,740
Scott: Who's going to get forced to actually make the latkes.

959
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,757
Scott: Everyone wants to eat them.

960
00:59:48,064 --> 00:59:48,220
Scott: Yeah.

961
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:48,540
Scott: Right.

962
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:50,099
Scott: But no one wants to make them.

963
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:57,160
Rym: I imagine two parallel threads of contention because contention thread one, nobody wants to be the one stuck in the kitchen fucking making them.

964
00:59:57,602 --> 01:00:01,760
Rym: But contention thread two, nobody wants whoever's shitty at it being stuck making them.

965
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:02,872
Scott: Yep.

966
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:04,156
Scott: Yeah.

967
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,219
Scott: So, you know, it was always interesting because it's like, you know, you got these eight days of Hanukkah.

968
01:00:08,861 --> 01:00:11,620
Scott: But you would still want to do like it's eight days.

969
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,420
Scott: You're not going to hang out with your extended family for eight days.

970
01:00:14,484 --> 01:00:14,615
Rym: No.

971
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:20,940
Rym: Even at Christmas, like we would visit one of the set of grandparents on like Christmas Eve and another one on Christmas Day.

972
01:00:21,321 --> 01:00:22,284
Rym: And that was already.

973
01:00:22,304 --> 01:00:27,400
Rym: the entire family is at one hundred and fifty percent capacity of seeing relatives.

974
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,579
Rym: And nobody wants to meet up again after that for a while.

975
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:37,540
Scott: See, we were in, I guess, a lucky situation that only there were only cousins and children, which are all similarly aged on my father's side.

976
01:00:38,524 --> 01:00:40,080
Scott: No one really on my mother's side.

977
01:00:40,201 --> 01:00:43,478
Scott: So we only had to get one extended family for Hanukkah.

978
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:44,300
Scott: Right.

979
01:00:44,862 --> 01:00:50,920
Scott: And so, you know, you'd have your eight days and, you know, at home after dinner, it would be like we finished.

980
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,460
Scott: You'd finish dinner, you'd light the candle, you'd get a present.

981
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:55,141
Scott: Right.

982
01:00:55,281 --> 01:00:55,643
Scott: Whatever.

983
01:00:55,844 --> 01:00:58,760
Scott: Sometimes you just go to school the next day to come home, get another present.

984
01:00:59,060 --> 01:00:59,182
Scott: Yeah.

985
01:00:59,202 --> 01:01:00,180
Scott: Moms hide them in the basement.

986
01:01:01,362 --> 01:01:05,020
Scott: And then there would be one day where you'd get the extended family going on.

987
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,556
Scott: Might not even be during the eight days if you couldn't manage it.

988
01:01:07,576 --> 01:01:08,240
Scott: schedule wise.

989
01:01:08,401 --> 01:01:08,602
Scott: Right.

990
01:01:09,425 --> 01:01:10,832
Scott: That would be the extended family.

991
01:01:10,872 --> 01:01:12,660
Scott: Hanukkah presents for everybody.

992
01:01:13,322 --> 01:01:15,900
Scott: And then we got old and like around the time when we were in college.

993
01:01:16,102 --> 01:01:16,304
Scott: Right.

994
01:01:16,345 --> 01:01:17,599
Scott: Everyone was similarly aged.

995
01:01:18,322 --> 01:01:24,400
Scott: You know, we just sort of, you know, I think one time we tried, you know, everyone buy presents for everyone kind of deal.

996
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:25,064
Scott: Right.

997
01:01:25,509 --> 01:01:26,297
Scott: And it was kind of meh.

998
01:01:26,821 --> 01:01:30,159
Scott: And then we're just like, you know what, buying presents is a pain in the ass.

999
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:30,901
Scott: Right.

1000
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:36,680
Scott: All of us are, you know, lucky and privileged and well off enough to buy shit we want for ourselves.

1001
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:37,322
Scott: Right.

1002
01:01:37,525 --> 01:01:38,699
Scott: No one fucking wants anything.

1003
01:01:40,221 --> 01:01:45,560
Scott: Let's just, you know, the present will all give each other is not having to fucking go buy presents for everybody.

1004
01:01:47,363 --> 01:01:48,450
Scott: And we just sort of stopped.

1005
01:01:48,732 --> 01:01:49,959
Scott: We just sort of stopped the Hanukkah.

1006
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:50,381
Scott: Right.

1007
01:01:50,503 --> 01:01:51,919
Scott: At least for the extended family.

1008
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,800
Scott: You know, I got a electric menorah.

1009
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:59,400
Scott: I actually made a USB powered menorah some years ago.

1010
01:01:59,681 --> 01:01:59,921
Scott: Right.

1011
01:01:59,961 --> 01:02:06,200
Scott: And I'm just like, you know what, you know, I don't believe in any of this nonsense, obviously, but it's fun to make.

1012
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:07,224
Scott: It's fun to have.

1013
01:02:07,486 --> 01:02:09,940
Scott: So I can change the colors too.

1014
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,469
Scott: I don't got to set a fire.

1015
01:02:11,953 --> 01:02:13,040
Scott: Don't got to melt any candles.

1016
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:19,619
Rym: I mean, this weekend I'm going to go out on the balcony and hang up some Christmas lights for the rest of the year and maybe a few weeks into the new year like I do.

1017
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:23,100
Rym: I mean, I'm a I'm an angry, loud atheist.

1018
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,168
Rym: It's not like I believe in Christmas, but I still like.

1019
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:28,180
Rym: I like a good Christmas song hanging out in the snow.

1020
01:02:29,661 --> 01:02:33,420
Scott: But I think maybe next week I'll deal with the pain in the ass and make a latke.

1021
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:34,559
Rym: Ooh, make a latke.

1022
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:39,920
Scott: Maybe this weekend I'll make a latke, even though it's a little early because Hanukkah starts on Sunday night.

1023
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,340
Rym: Make the practice latke this weekend.

1024
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,579
Scott: Make it on Sunday night.

1025
01:02:45,922 --> 01:02:46,345
Scott: All right.

1026
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,000
Rym: So I guess it's time to go see how that hockey game's going.

1027
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,040
Rym: I think we'll stop the show right there.

1028
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,980
Scott: It didn't start yet because they got some ceremonies.

1029
01:02:52,703 --> 01:02:53,312
Rym: Oh, good.

1030
01:02:53,373 --> 01:02:53,820
Rym: I was worried.

1031
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,380
Scott: It's about to start like in Tuesday.

1032
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,600
Rym: Perfect timing.

1033
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,000
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

Rym: But yeah, whatever.

1046
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:03,380

1047

Rym: And for now, I leave you with...
