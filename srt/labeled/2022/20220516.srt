1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,149
Rym: It's Monday, May 16th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:10,450
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:14,119
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,607
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,779
Rym: Tonight we're talking about scanners.

6
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,018
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:39,940
Rym: So, uh, against all odds, but at the same time, not implausible, because one way you can describe this, on one hand it's rare for a team in a sport to be down significantly in a playoff, and then come all the way back to win that playoff series.

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:48,680
Rym: The Rangers were down 3-1, but four games won the series, and then they won three games in a row, and they advanced.

9
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:50,431
Scott: We were down 3-0, though.

10
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:50,954
Scott: We were down 3-1.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,578
Rym: That is true.

12
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:57,398
Scott: But, yeah, I mean, this has happened before, with the Penguins before, right?

13
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:03,920
Scott: But at the same time, the Penguins were undefeated in a way game, Game 7.

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:19,219
Scott: So it was like both teams had a streak, and one of them was going to break, and somehow miraculously, despite their team being the better team by far, playing better than us by far, they did not win, because that's how games do.

15
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:23,719
Scott: It's luck, there's factors, things happen.

16
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:34,099
Rym: I gotta say, this was the first time I saw three overtimes in any hockey game in person, let alone a playoff game.

17
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:45,540
Rym: I always imagined it would be extremely interesting and fun, and it was, but it was also not extremely fun to leave that arena after midnight.

18
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:48,840
Scott: Yeah, but that was Game 1.

19
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,463
Rym: That was Game 1.

20
00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:52,698
Rym: We were filled with optimism, like, "Alright, they lost the game, but in a ridiculous

21
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:53,220
Rym: overtime.".

22
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:54,539
Rym: And then Game 2, they crushed.

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,739
Scott: Yeah, the two games I went to, we won.

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,101
Rym: The game, Game 5.

25
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:03,399
Scott: I didn't go to any losing games.

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:03,620
Scott: The

27
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:16,999
Rym: game that you and I went to that we assumed we weren't going to say out loud, we were just sort of expecting it to go badly, it was going very badly, and then somehow it reversed itself and became one of the more exciting hockey games I've ever seen in my life in person.

28
00:02:17,883 --> 00:02:24,396
Scott: Well, I'm expecting now for us to, you know, I mean, if we get swept, I'll be like,

29
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:24,659
Scott: "Alright.".

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,832
Rym: You know what I'm going to say?

31
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:26,419
Rym: I'm going to say this.

32
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:37,600
Rym: We get to see at least four more hockey games where the New York Rangers are playing, and that is a fine reward when the alternative is none more games.

33
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,597
Scott: None more would have been fine, too, because it's now summertime, but I don't really need hockey so much anymore.

34
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:48,360
Rym: Yeah, you say that, but I'll unsay that if somehow the Rangers make it to the finals.

35
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,840
Rym: Suddenly I will care a lot about there being some hockey.

36
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:53,780
Scott: I just don't think that's going to happen, so it's okay.

37
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,840
Rym: I feel like Scott has to say he doesn't think it'll happen because you can't hope if you're a New York sports fan.

38
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,220
Scott: You can't be disappointed if you weren't appointed.

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,043
Rym: Exactly.

40
00:03:02,164 --> 00:03:07,273
Rym: Now, New York sports fans are not like Leafs fans, but we'll see how this goes.

41
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:23,752
Rym: So, in some news, we're not going to talk about the whole Twitter Musk thing because every single update to that story just gets stupider and stupider, and it doesn't even matter, but I'm pretty confident.

42
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:25,360
Rym: nothing's going to change.

43
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,919
Rym: Nobody's buying Twitter.

44
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:34,759
Scott: We'll see what happens until it's over and final and actually done.

45
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,400
Scott: You know, then nothing, right?

46
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:39,759
Rym: Yup, but I do have an opening bit.

47
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:42,639
Rym: Today, I was biking home from work like I do.

48
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:43,691
Rym: I was going to bike home.

49
00:03:43,772 --> 00:03:44,360
Rym: I go outside.

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,559
Scott: So, you went from opening bit to news.

51
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:48,800
Scott: No, I went from opening bit.

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Scott: You're not going to do a news.

53
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,419
Scott: It wasn't even a news.

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,500
Scott: It was we're not going to do this news, and then you went back to the opening bit section.

55
00:03:54,701 --> 00:04:01,600
Rym: I did because I forgot to talk about the opening bit, and also, if that wasn't a news, it was an anti-news, which is relevant to my thing of the day.

56
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:05,060
Scott: Okay, so you're getting way ahead of yourself with things of the day.

57
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:08,080
Scott: Keep the order straight.

58
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,100
Rym: So, pouring rain in Midtown, and then it was sunny again.

59
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,712
Rym: I look out the window, and I think, "You know what?

60
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,517
Rym: I bet I could bike

61
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:15,758
Rym: home.".

62
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,129
Rym: So, I go outside in Midtown.

63
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:20,880
Rym: It's totally sunny, and there is one.

64
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,479
Rym: It was almost like a cartoon.

65
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:35,659
Rym: There's one big dark storm cloud surrounded by sunny blue sky, and this big storm cloud is moving around Midtown like a UFO, and there's a sheet of rain under it and nowhere else.

66
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,211
Scott: Are you sure that wasn't just Dr.

67
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:38,039
Scott: Wylie or something?

68
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:39,955
Rym: I'm pretty sure it was Dr.

69
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:40,278
Rym: Wylie.

70
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:43,174
Rym: So, I look, and I'm like, "You know what?

71
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:44,079
Rym: I'm going to chance

72
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:44,140
Rym: it.".

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:52,520
Rym: So, I get on a city bike, and I start biking, and the wall of water is following me, but slowly in the distance.

74
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,099
Rym: So, it's a race against time, race against the clock.

75
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:57,717
Rym: Will it get me or won't it get me?

76
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,139
Rym: And I'm staying pretty well ahead of it.

77
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:05,800
Rym: It's a few blocks behind me, but I can see it back there slowly approaching.

78
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,908
Rym: I get on the bridge.

79
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:12,800
Rym: I'm going over the bridge, and it's starting to come up the bridge behind me.

80
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:14,608
Rym: I look back.

81
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,919
Rym: It is raining behind me.

82
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:17,739
Rym: I am not being rained on yet.

83
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:23,160
Rym: I'm huffing and puffing now because I really don't want to get rained on.

84
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,659
Rym: It was an extreme rain.

85
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:29,780
Rym: A few super slow people were biking, and I had trouble getting past them.

86
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:33,400
Rym: The rain started to get me a little bit, but I got my way around them.

87
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,339
Rym: I got past the rain again, so I was barely rained on.

88
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,480
Rym: I made it home to the city bike dock at the base of the bridge.

89
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,828
Rym: Rain is not there.

90
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:42,240
Rym: I am way ahead of the rain.

91
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,230
Rym: I made it.

92
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:47,259
Rym: There were no open docks in the fucking city bike dock.

93
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:53,179
Rym: And in the time it took me to bike to another dock, the rain washed over, and I got soaked.

94
00:05:55,384 --> 00:06:00,593
Rym: I left a two-star review with city bike on that ride, and I wrote a little note saying, "Please put more docks

95
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,096
Rym: everywhere.".

96
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:02,774
Scott: Okay.

97
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:04,389
Rym: All right.

98
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:05,039
Rym: You got any news?

99
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:08,160
Scott: There was an eclipse yesterday.

100
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,800
Scott: I don't know where in the world you could see it from.

101
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:12,146
Rym: Everywhere.

102
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:14,180
Rym: Lunar eclipses are visible everywhere.

103
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,006
Rym: The moon is visible.

104
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,116
Rym: They're not like solar eclipses.

105
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,240
Scott: But, yeah, the moon was not visible everywhere, though.

106
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,540
Rym: Oh, yeah, but if the moon was visible in the place you were, you could see this eclipse.

107
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,179
Scott: Right, but, yeah, so that the Earth was in between the sun and the moon, and the Earth's shadow was over the moon.

108
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:34,079
Scott: But, also, this was a blood moon, so it was a red moon.

109
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,284
Rym: Link!

110
00:06:35,492 --> 00:06:35,720
Rym: Link!

111
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:39,800
Scott: Also, it was a full moon, or full-ish moon.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,759
Scott: Full enough, right?

113
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,200
Rym: It might have technically been waning gibbous, but it was close enough to fall.

114
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,120
Scott: I don't know, but, also, it was a total eclipse.

115
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,000
Scott: It wasn't like one of those partial eclipses where you could see just passing over a part of the moon.

116
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,600
Scott: It was like the whole fucking moon was gone, right?

117
00:06:54,903 --> 00:06:56,020
Rym: It was pretty impressive.

118
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:59,760
Rym: We wanted to go on the roof to look at it, but the building had already locked up the roof for the night.

119
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,020
Rym: So, we're out on the street, and all the buildings are in the way.

120
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:07,280
Rym: But we found a spot on the street under the subway where we could see it, and it was a really good angle.

121
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,749
Scott: I just went on the roof.

122
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:10,860
Scott: I couldn't see it, because the building across from me was in the way, out the window.

123
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,439
Rym: We spent about 20 minutes walking around outside, so we find an angle to see it through the buildings.

124
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,133
Scott: I just saw it on the roof.

125
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:17,560
Scott: Anyway.

126
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:19,959
Scott: So, yeah, that was the thing.

127
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,793
Scott: And now, other news.

128
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:22,560
Scott: What was the other news?

129
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:24,132
Rym: Nvidia did something.

130
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:29,920
Rym: Nvidia did something that a younger Rym would have been really excited about.

131
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:31,140
Scott: Oh, yeah, right.

132
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:38,320
Rym: The current Rym is shocked that this happened and also can't imagine any reason why anyone would care.

133
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:41,220
Scott: I mean, there's reasons to care.

134
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:43,780
Scott: So, if you don't know about this drama, right?

135
00:07:44,700 --> 00:08:03,818
Scott: People who run Linux computers, which have Nvidia GPUs in them, Nvidia has, for a very, very long time, since we were in college, maybe even longer, right, made an official Nvidia GPU driver for Linux, as well as Windows, right?

136
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:13,040
Scott: And that driver, you know, on Windows, it's like you install drivers, right, as, like, this separate thing.

137
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,080
Scott: There's, like, you know, their files, right?

138
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,300
Scott: Then you can just dynamically add drivers to Windows, right?

139
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,299
Scott: Linux, it doesn't work that way.

140
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:25,660
Scott: There's the Linux kernel, and you can compile hardware.

141
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,839
Scott: You know, the Linux kernel has support for hardware just in it.

142
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,780
Scott: And if you actually go to compile the Linux kernel, it's open source, right?

143
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,539
Scott: So, you can just download the source code and compile it into the binary file, right?

144
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:39,018
Scott: It's just a binary file when you're done compiling it.

145
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,880
Scott: When you compile it, you know, there's, like, this menu config.

146
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:46,000
Scott: You can also do a text file config.

147
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:50,219
Scott: But basically, you choose which parts you want to build and which parts you don't want to build.

148
00:08:50,541 --> 00:09:05,700
Scott: So, it's like if you know exactly what computer this kernel is going to go on, you can include just the parts you need for that computer and cut out all the other parts that are just going to take up space on your hard drive, which is usually not a big deal because computers have so much storage space.

149
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,899
Scott: You can just build a giant kernel with everything in it, and it'll work on, like, every computer almost, or, you know, there's lots of things in it.

150
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:19,679
Scott: But if you're doing some embedded application with, like, a 16-gigabyte flash, like, yeah, you need to make a really tiny kernel, right?

151
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Scott: But your video card drivers, as well as all your other drivers, are just in there, right?

152
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:39,880
Scott: However, there's also kernel modules, which are ways that you can add and remove things from the kernel while it's running, like support for hardware and whatnot, dynamically, similar to what you do on Windows, but not quite exactly.

153
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:44,380
Scott: And those are effectively -- you can consider them to be like drivers.

154
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:46,060
Scott: They're not exactly the same, right?

155
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,519
Scott: We don't need to get into those details.

156
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:55,856
Scott: What is important is that the official NVIDIA driver, for as long as I can remember, was a closed-source thing, right?

157
00:09:56,902 --> 00:09:59,179
Scott: It was not -- they weren't open-sourcing their driver, right?

158
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:00,159
Scott: No way.

159
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:14,179
Scott: And this was a problem because it meant that if you were going to, say, install a Linux distribution on your desktop computer, say Ubuntu or Red Hat or whatever, Fedora, right?

160
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,779
Rym: Don't forget.

161
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:24,900
Scott: Those distributions, those people making those Linux distributions, could not legally distribute the NVIDIA driver to you.

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,520
Scott: They couldn't include it on their CD-ROM or USB stick or their ISO.

163
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,640
Rym: Now, a nerd could deal with this in a bunch of ways.

164
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,720
Scott: Well, they couldn't offer downloads of it on their website, right?

165
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:48,209
Scott: So what they would do is, for example, if you installed Ubuntu on your laptop and it had an NVIDIA GPU in it, there would be a pop-up that was like, "Hey, we see you got an NVIDIA GPU.

166
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:51,240
Scott: We're currently using this open-source driver.

167
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,407
Scott: Do you want the NVIDIA one?

168
00:10:53,848 --> 00:11:01,219
Scott: Click on some yes and click on some license agreements, and then this program will go to the NVIDIA website, get the closed-source

169
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:01,520
Scott: thing.".

170
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:10,180
Scott: And there's an open-source module that just shims the closed-source driver into the kernel to make it work.

171
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:14,580
Rym: Now, this pretty much did work most of the time.

172
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:14,981
Rym: Yeah, it worked.

173
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:20,400
Scott: It worked as far back as college, but it was an extra step, and it was a pain.

174
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:29,439
Rym: But more importantly, I'd say one population of people who use Linux on the desktop were more than happy to just click to make it work.

175
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:42,639
Rym: And the other population of Linux on the desktop people are ideological purists who either refused to do this on moral grounds or otherwise freaked out about it and would make huge mistakes about it.

176
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,080
Scott: There are also practical reasons, right?

177
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,496
Scott: Most people are not using Linux on the desktop.

178
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:49,180
Scott: We know that already.

179
00:11:49,860 --> 00:12:00,640
Scott: It's like someone is using some supercomputer, maybe not for coin mining, for something legitimate, render farm, something like that, or CUDA, some machine learning.

180
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:15,717
Scott: And they got a bunch of GPUs from NVIDIA in this machine, and the driver is not open-source, and they don't know what it's doing, and now they need to optimize their workload or whatever in this industrial application.

181
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:16,080
Scott: Who knows?

182
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,120
Scott: And they can't, because they don't know what the fuck that driver is doing.

183
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,578
Scott: It's some closed-source thing.

184
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:29,874
Scott: So there are legitimate reasons to want it to be open-source that are just not relevant to Rym, whose only purpose is, "I just want the GPU to

185
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:30,075
Scott: work."

186
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:40,560
Rym: And especially because desktop Linux is not a majority use case now, even less so than it was back when we last talked about Linux on the desktop.

187
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,380
Scott: Right.

188
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:52,240
Scott: There's also people who are very Linux knowledgeable, and they could actually make improvements to the driver, but not just the driver.

189
00:12:52,763 --> 00:13:05,460
Scott: Even if they don't modify the driver, in seeing how it works, they could optimize other open-source software like desktop environments, video player, anything that uses the GPU can now be optimized better.

190
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:17,919
Scott: I don't think people realize, this is not an exaggeration, that NVIDIA on Windows works very closely with the publishers and developers of major games and major game engines.

191
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:24,360
Scott: Obviously, I've never seen the NVIDIA driver source code for Windows, right?

192
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:34,300
Scott: It's not an open-source thing, but it's common knowledge that there's basic code in that driver that's like, "If the software that is running is Call of Duty, do this.

193
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:36,998
Scott: If the software that is running is Doom Eternal, do

194
00:13:37,038 --> 00:13:37,260
Scott: that.".

195
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:43,299
Scott: They code that shit into the driver to handle all those fucking games on Windows, doing weird stuff, right?

196
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:49,160
Rym: And imagine what could be done if a lot more eyes were on that actual code.

197
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,732
Scott: Anyway, so NVIDIA, after how long?

198
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:53,435
Scott: 20 fucking years, right?

199
00:13:54,982 --> 00:14:01,500
Rym: I never, ever in my life thought this would happen, because their main argument was, "Our drivers have proprietary trade secrets.

200
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:03,413
Rym: that would be a competitive disadvantage.

201
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,259
Rym: We can't share

202
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:04,420
Rym: them.".

203
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,100
Rym: I never imagined there would be a universe where if that were true, that would change.

204
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:19,180
Rym: So either that was never true, or something's different about NVIDIA and their business model, or what they think is dangerous to them competitively.

205
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,853
Scott: I don't know, but they released an open-source driver.

206
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:24,060
Scott: It's alpha, right?

207
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:33,479
Scott: Fully open-source driver, which means if you have an NVIDIA board in your computer, and you can now install Linux distribution, and it would just work.

208
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,439
Scott: You wouldn't have to click on an extra thing.

209
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:39,500
Scott: You'd just have perfect GPU acceleration out of the box, assuming it works.

210
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,595
Scott: But it's an alpha, and it's hard to say.

211
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,050
Scott: It's like, "Well, is this literally the same driver?

212
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,135
Scott: What was removed from it?

213
00:14:47,155 --> 00:14:47,938
Scott: What was added to

214
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:48,159
Scott: it?".

215
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:49,005
Scott: Who knows?

216
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:49,971
Scott: I haven't looked at it.

217
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,139
Scott: I haven't read enough about it.

218
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:58,260
Scott: But still, releasing an open-source GPU driver for NVIDIA GPUs on Linux is kind of a big deal.

219
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,540
Rym: Yep, it's a big deal, even though you won't see the obvious direct fruits of it unless you pay attention.

220
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,040
Rym: There will be fruits of this for many people.

221
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:24,960
Scott: One area that I think consumers in consumer devices that are not Linux on the desktop people might see a benefit from this is somebody could now distribute a device.

222
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,720
Scott: They could produce a phone or something and put NVIDIA chips in it with running Linux.

223
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,023
Scott: Android is Linux, right?

224
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:38,837
Scott: And include this driver and distribute this driver in their product.

225
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:48,297
Scott: Whereas now, if you were to make a phone... Let's say I made a phone last month, and I made the phone, and the phone had an NVIDIA GPU in it.

226
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:53,360
Scott: And I put Linux on that phone as the OS, and I tried to sell you that phone.

227
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:56,160
Scott: I couldn't sell you the phone with the driver on there.

228
00:15:57,484 --> 00:16:02,640
Scott: You, the person, would have to do some bullshit to get the... But now I can do it.

229
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,790
Scott: Now I can sell you a device with an NVIDIA GPU in it that runs Linux.

230
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:10,900
Scott: that's already working at whatever capacity.

231
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:16,533
Scott: So now you might see some new hardware hit the scene that runs Linux.

232
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:29,320
Scott: Obviously not desktops and laptops, but tablets, phones, other kinds of devices that have NVIDIA GPUs and run Linux on them.

233
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,340
Rym: Yep, and it looks like it's a dual GPL and MIT license.

234
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,349
Rym: So this is like a real open source release.

235
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:38,540
Rym: This isn't one of those LGPL limited nonsense things.

236
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:39,571
Scott: Nope.

237
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:42,245
Rym: And some other news.

238
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:46,200
Rym: So obviously the war in Ukraine is a ridiculous tragedy.

239
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:48,246
Rym: I cannot stress that enough.

240
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,860
Rym: But a very interesting thing has happened.

241
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:55,719
Rym: As you may have seen, if you're paying attention to the news, Russia's war aims have mostly failed.

242
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,780
Rym: Like the literal thing they were trying to prevent, Finland and Sweden joining NATO.

243
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,380
Rym: Finland and Sweden are now joining NATO, and they've lost almost all the land they took from Ukraine.

244
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,988
Rym: But the military collapsed.

245
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:34,279
Rym: And what happened, apparently, and there's an article about this here on the drive that's in pretty good detail, in the chaos of the Russian military collapsing, retreating, and losing between 25 and 33% of all the troops they committed, they abandoned and left behind in Ukraine a rare and extremely advanced, for the Russian military at least, electronic warfare system.

246
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:56,340
Rym: All modern militaries have these things, but basically they're like a truck or a container or something filled with a ton of technology that is used to do things like jam radar, disrupt enemy signals intelligence, fuck with GPS systems, protect your own troops from other armies trying to do this to you.

247
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,300
Rym: Like electronic warfare, go read the Wikipedia article on it if you want to learn more.

248
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,042
Rym: I'm not an expert.

249
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:09,400
Rym: But Ukraine has Russia's most advanced known electronic warfare system, apparently.

250
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:13,379
Scott: It wasn't just a booby-trapped thing?

251
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,132
Rym: Nope, it looks like the truck that was carrying.

252
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:22,840
Rym: it was attacked by Ukrainian forces, and the Russian forces appear to have died and/or fled.

253
00:18:23,962 --> 00:18:32,499
Scott: It wasn't a ruse where they made a fake electronics warfare platform to make you think that that's what their capabilities were when actually it was just, you know...

254
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:41,500
Rym: Well, it's the Khrushka IV system, which its existence and its capabilities are already well known to western intelligence.

255
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,830
Rym: So, but now we have one.

256
00:18:45,253 --> 00:18:50,800
Scott: Ukraine is apparently... It's not a secret spying thing, where like, aha, it's actually spying on you when you try to use it.

257
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,680
Rym: I mean, if that were true, props to the Russian military, but based on everything else that has happened to the Russian military.

258
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,900
Scott: Also, is this a real story or just some website?

259
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:07,880
Rym: No, there's multiple confirmations about this, and it looks like they're delivering it to the United States to study.

260
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:09,215
Scott: Okay.

261
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:18,380
Rym: So, this is an aspect of warfare, this kind of technology that war fanboys don't even think that much about.

262
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:26,700
Rym: And it's arguably one of the most important aspects of modern warfare, is the electronic and signals intelligence part of that warfare.

263
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:33,560
Rym: And there's just a really interesting story and you can read all the cool details of how these systems work and how we use them.

264
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:49,500
Rym: And the broader picture here is that Russia does have very advanced equipment, but due to the failings of their logistics and operations, they're either not deploying that equipment or where they're deploying it, it is being destroyed or otherwise failing to achieve any goals.

265
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:54,760
Rym: And this is just one more example of that, that is just particularly egregious.

266
00:19:55,602 --> 00:20:03,920
Rym: This could be a significant setback to Russia's military for decades to come, because they don't appear to have the capability to design better systems to do this kind of thing.

267
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,900
Scott: How are they so good at hacking everyone's computers?

268
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:10,183
Scott: They're not!

269
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:21,280
Rym: In fact, if you haven't noticed, since the war began, Russian state-sponsored hacking attacks on the rest of the world spiked briefly and then basically all but dried up.

270
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:28,200
Rym: Meanwhile, counter attacks against Russian assets that had previously never really happened have been happening at a staggering rate.

271
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:42,080
Rym: It looks like Russia's cyber warfare machine is one, largely outside of Russia and funded by Russian money, and when they couldn't pay people anymore because of the sanctions, everyone just stopped doing it.

272
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:56,780
Rym: And two, the parts of it that were very effective are information warfare, like troll bots and bot farms and sentiment nonsense and fake news, and a lot of that is becoming less and less effective because it hits saturation.

273
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:16,700
Rym: Meanwhile, five days ago, Unknown Forces hacked Russian state TV and replaced all the programming notes with anti-Putin propaganda, and they also hacked one of the main Russian news sites and replaced all the articles with actual articles from the West about what's happening outside of Russia.

274
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,700
Scott: Nope, I don't know if that's true, because it's not like I'm watching Russian TV to find out.

275
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,939
Rym: Oh, that was confirmed by MSNBC and CNN.

276
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:32,860
Rym: Put a little marker, because I'm going to make this episode with good metadata just to test my own pipeline of generating that metadata quickly.

277
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:46,080
Rym: I opened a feature request to Adobe because, get this, you'd think an obvious feature of a very advanced marker system in audio editing software would be to be able to peg a marker to a particular track.

278
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:53,720
Rym: So if I have a marker of when we started the things of the day, and I drag the tracks around, it would follow at least one of those audio tracks.

279
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:56,680
Rym: Such a feature has never existed in Adobe.

280
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,978
Rym: And I opened a feature request before it.

281
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:07,660
Rym: My ticket was merged with a ticket from 2008.

282
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,579
Rym: Thousands of people have been asking for this, and it looks like they're never going to do it.

283
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:14,880
Scott: Yeah, I mean, they're still working on the stupid color blending being correct.

284
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:16,719
Rym: Yep, but they're working on that at least.

285
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,399
Scott: Well, I don't know if they are or not.

286
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,600
Rym: It appears that they are.

287
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:25,579
Scott: But it seems to be in demand from a lot of artists, especially since other apps are doing it.

288
00:22:31,072 --> 00:22:33,970
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

289
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,970
Rym: So I've been on a really big renewed kick.

290
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:45,210
Rym: I get into things, like I get into nuclear weapons for a while, then I get really obsessed with, I don't know, mRNA or something.

291
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:53,230
Rym: But what I've been digging into lately is all the quantum physics stuff that's happened since I was in high school.

292
00:22:53,970 --> 00:23:04,790
Rym: And I found this video that is only 15 minutes long, and it is a really, really, really good visual sort of explanation.

293
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:08,870
Rym: Not of how some deep physics thing works, because we don't know how it works.

294
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:10,830
Rym: These are unproven theories.

295
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:17,750
Rym: But the concept of supersymmetry, not regular old symmetry, but supersymmetry, which you hear said.

296
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,277
Rym: That's a word, supersymmetry, that you hear physics.

297
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:25,070
Rym: people say off and on, usually in relation to string theory or brain theory or something.

298
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:34,030
Rym: But very rarely is it explained in a way that any human could understand, us included, anyone, even physicists included.

299
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:45,810
Rym: And this video, I think it did such a fantastic job of visually showing what the fuck they're talking about when they say the word supersymmetry that I'm making it my thing of the day.

300
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,349
Rym: I am not saying that I understand supersymmetry, nor will you understand it.

301
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:53,050
Scott: So the video isn't good enough to help me understand supersymmetry.

302
00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:08,770
Rym: You will understand what supersymmetry is and what it means, but how or why it works and whether or not it's true or any of the math is not even touched on in this video.

303
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:19,290
Rym: But now, after watching this video, if a physicist says blah blah blah supersymmetry blah, I can visualize in my head what they are talking about.

304
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,490
Rym: And that is better than I've ever gotten with this concept before.

305
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:24,302
Scott: Mm hmm.

306
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:26,271
Scott: All right.

307
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:39,470
Scott: So in the hockey series that the Rangers just miraculously won, right, there were disappointingly several instances of goals being allowed or disallowed or whatever that were questionable.

308
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,031
Scott: Right.

309
00:24:40,051 --> 00:24:44,378
Scott: You know, someone's stick was over the bar, you know, did it cross the line?

310
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:51,450
Scott: We couldn't see it was the rules are so fussy, because even if it's obvious, was it interference or not?

311
00:24:51,590 --> 00:25:02,530
Rym: The current rules of the NHL are, unless there is incontrovertible video proof, whatever the ref called on the ice stance, like that's the rule.

312
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,837
Scott: I don't think that's the rule, actually.

313
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:06,090
Scott: I always heard that that's the rule in football.

314
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,178
Rym: That's the rule in hockey.

315
00:25:07,198 --> 00:25:08,470
Rym: I read the NHL Handbook recently.

316
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,294
Scott: You sure?

317
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:10,344
Scott: Okay, because there's...

318
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:14,705
Rym: Not for everything, but for was it a goal or not.

319
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:15,790
Scott: That is the rule.

320
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:23,308
Scott: I have to check that again, because a reliable source basically said that that's the rule in football.

321
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:23,990
Scott: for sure, right?

322
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:29,810
Scott: That the call in the field stands unless this, you know, absolute proof right in the video review.

323
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:42,970
Scott: But they were like, actually, they said this reliable person said that actually people think that's the rule in the NHL because it's the rule in football, but the rule book in the NHL is not worded the same way.

324
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:44,528
Scott: So I'm going to go verify that.

325
00:25:44,936 --> 00:25:45,510
Rym: That doesn't matter.

326
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,623
Rym: There might be some fussy wording.

327
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:47,170
Rym: Anyway.

328
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:57,690
Scott: Anyway, the point is, is that we had, you know, it's whether your team wins or loses, it's disappointing to have a game decided by the refs on these close calls.

329
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:01,100
Scott: Like, honestly, it could have gone either way, right?

330
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,510
Scott: You know, and sometimes refs make bad calls or no calls.

331
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:10,910
Scott: It happens either because they missed it, because it's the playoffs and it's swallowing the whistle, because they're bad refs.

332
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:16,885
Rym: Or like it was literally too close for a human to objectively tell.

333
00:26:17,186 --> 00:26:18,650
Rym: And then like one of the cameras was busted.

334
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,090
Rym: So they don't even have the camera angle to review.

335
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,809
Scott: They don't deploy the technology that they could.

336
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:29,845
Scott: Anyway, so the question came up is like, all right, we've seen plenty of bad calls, close calls.

337
00:26:29,885 --> 00:26:31,530
Scott: Everyone hates the refs right now, right?

338
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:36,590
Scott: It's like, but what's the worst call like ever?

339
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:44,070
Rym: Because, yeah, all these calls we're talking about, like the goal that was disallowed the other day and the goal that was reallowed the other day.

340
00:26:44,432 --> 00:26:47,230
Rym: Those are actually pretty OK calls, even though they went against the Rangers.

341
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:54,030
Scott: If we look through all of NHL history, at least, right, we can't go to all of sports history because you got things in there like hand of God in there.

342
00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:03,810
Scott: But it's like, you know, look at NHL history, at least NHL history that's on film, that's recorded, that we can see what's the worst call by a ref, right?

343
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:10,270
Scott: And I did not look at all the examples that people were bringing up as possibles.

344
00:27:10,551 --> 00:27:15,105
Scott: But this one was so bad, I just going to give it the trophy.

345
00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:16,650
Scott: I don't need to see anything else, right?

346
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:22,090
Scott: In this game, which I believe is a regular season game between the Jets and the Blackhawks.

347
00:27:22,715 --> 00:27:24,488
Rym: I'm watching the slow mo while you talk.

348
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,798
Scott: Quite a while ago, pre HD.

349
00:27:27,838 --> 00:27:30,205
Scott: So this has, I don't know exactly what year this is.

350
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:31,087
Scott: It feels like 80s, 90s times.

351
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,144
Scott: Probably not, you know, but, you know, it's not HD.

352
00:27:35,264 --> 00:27:36,349
Scott: It's really hard to see.

353
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:49,930
Scott: But even in this really low quality video recorded probably from VHS tape, you can see that what happens is a player who is behind the net, right?

354
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,458
Scott: Gets the puck in their glove.

355
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:57,110
Scott: Now the puck in the glove is not against the rules in hockey.

356
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,299
Scott: You can put it down and start playing it.

357
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,710
Scott: You can, you can even whack it, right?

358
00:28:02,592 --> 00:28:07,430
Scott: As long as you're not passing it to your own teammate outside of the defensive.

359
00:28:07,991 --> 00:28:10,436
Rym: I just saw what happened, right?

360
00:28:11,097 --> 00:28:17,790
Scott: So, but you cannot, what you cannot do is you can't pass it to your teammate, you know, outside the defensive zone.

361
00:28:18,252 --> 00:28:20,881
Scott: You can't whack it into the goal, right?

362
00:28:20,921 --> 00:28:23,610
Scott: Like, like try to smack it into the goal with your hand.

363
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:28,330
Scott: You also can't, you know, it's hard to close your hand in a hockey glove, but you can do it.

364
00:28:28,811 --> 00:28:32,704
Scott: You're not allowed to close your hand around the puck and grip it, right?

365
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,670
Scott: You can like rest it in the glove.

366
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,984
Rym: Only two players on the ice are allowed to do that.

367
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:37,749
Rym: And those are goalies.

368
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:38,852
Scott: That's right.

369
00:28:39,574 --> 00:28:45,090
Scott: And if they only in their special goalie glove, I don't know if they're allowed to do it in the other glove.

370
00:28:45,231 --> 00:28:46,798
Rym: I think they can't use the other glove.

371
00:28:46,818 --> 00:28:49,410
Scott: It would be really hard to do because they don't want to let go of their sticks.

372
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:54,370
Rym: I'd have to go refer to the rule book, which I'm going to read again because I'm going to review the language on the call on the ice.

373
00:28:54,750 --> 00:29:00,390
Scott: A goalie is allowed to, you know, if you're right or left handed as a goalie, you can put your blocker in your stick on either side you want.

374
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,536
Scott: There's no rule that says, right?

375
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:03,890
Rym: I wish they let you have two blockers or two gloves if you wanted.

376
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:17,310
Scott: But anyway, in this shitty old low resolution VHS video, it is unambiguously clear that this player catches the puck in their glove, is not a goalie, closes their fist around the puck, hold gripping.

377
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:28,110
Scott: The puck goes over to the goal and tries to just drop the puck into the goal with their hand like a slam dunk in basketball.

378
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:33,710
Rym: Like in this video, you can see other players even reacting like what the fuck?

379
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:40,790
Scott: That is not a legal play by any stretch of the imagination in any hockey, any any ice hockey anywhere.

380
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,781
Scott: I don't even know it's legal in any hockey anywhere.

381
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,210
Scott: Probably not in lacrosse either.

382
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:51,350
Rym: That's the kind of thing that would not have been legal in like the old timey hockey where the rules were basically hit the puck in no matter what.

383
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:52,893
Scott: Yeah.

384
00:29:52,913 --> 00:29:56,930
Scott: And this is this is reviewed by some video official somewhere.

385
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:04,630
Scott: They didn't have the Toronto centralized thing in those days, but some video official in the building reviews this and calls it a good goal.

386
00:30:05,511 --> 00:30:09,630
Scott: And the team that won runs the fuck off the ice real quick.

387
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:15,449
Rym: It's a hard move because even a classy team would it would struggle to resist talking batteries on the ice.

388
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,810
Scott: But, you know, I think it's the home team that won, right?

389
00:30:21,711 --> 00:30:24,690
Rym: Oh, so the YouTube video actually has a great description.

390
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:29,690
Rym: The decision was made even after a quote video review was conducted.

391
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:33,870
Rym: This sent the Chicago Blackhawks into a rage.

392
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:35,214
Scott: They should.

393
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:37,330
Scott: They have every right to be enraged.

394
00:30:37,771 --> 00:30:43,650
Scott: This is the worst call I have ever seen by any ref in any hockey anywhere.

395
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:47,439
Rym: Other than the hand of God, this might be the worst by by.

396
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,490
Rym: a lot like race walking completely fine compared to this.

397
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:53,984
Scott: This is the horse's horse.

398
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:57,075
Scott: Call like.

399
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:00,630
Scott: even if my team won on a call like this, I would be like, what the fuck?

400
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,330
Scott: Yeah, we slam dunked the puck out of the net.

401
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:12,170
Scott: You can't do that, but also we have HD cameras and I don't think even the NHL today with its imperfect refereeing would get this.

402
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:23,790
Rym: This would be like in basketball if I just like grab the ball, ran with it without dribbling, climbed up the pole that the basket is on, sat up there and just pushed it down through the top.

403
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,947
Scott: Harlem Globetrotters get away with it.

404
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:31,710
Rym: You know, I would love to see the Harlem Globetrotters equivalent for hockey.

405
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,089
Scott: It's probably not going to be as cool.

406
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,476
Rym: I think it'd be pretty cool.

407
00:31:36,536 --> 00:31:38,470
Rym: The problem is I think it would be extremely dangerous.

408
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,030
Scott: Have you seen the actual Harlem Globetrotters?

409
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:41,426
Scott: Oh, yeah.

410
00:31:44,897 --> 00:31:48,050
Rym: I saw them at Cobo Hall a couple times as a kid.

411
00:31:49,571 --> 00:32:00,630
Scott: When I was in high school, at my high school, in the gym, the same gym, I went to see the Harlem Globetrotters versus... Who do you think they were versus?

412
00:32:00,972 --> 00:32:03,590
Rym: So you wouldn't ask me unless it wasn't the normal answer.

413
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:09,689
Scott: It's a sports team versus a sports team that you know exists.

414
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:16,630
Scott: No, it was the Harlem Globetrotters versus the New York Football Giants.

415
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:22,310
Scott: Or at least enough representatives from the New York Football Giants.

416
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,770
Rym: That's pretty fantastic.

417
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:28,649
Scott: To make up a basketball team that would get demolished by the Harlem Globetrotters.

418
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:40,030
Rym: In fact, the last time I saw the Harlem Globetrotters was in a dual event that also featured a criss-cross concert.

419
00:32:42,511 --> 00:32:50,230
Scott: And the only Giants player that I specifically remember being there was Stephen Baker, the touchdown maker.

420
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,164
Scott: Because his name is Stephen Baker, the touchdown maker.

421
00:32:53,184 --> 00:32:54,249
Scott: You can't forget that guy.

422
00:32:56,951 --> 00:33:01,510
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book, which we're going to do the show on within the next month or so.

423
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,350
Rym: So get reading if you haven't started reading.

424
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:14,530
Rym: Ninefox Gambit, Korean sci-fi, Distant Future, very like culture book Distant Future in terms of the kinds of abstract, ridiculous technology.

425
00:33:16,714 --> 00:33:19,149
Rym: But the further I get into this book, I'm getting near the end.

426
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:21,501
Rym: I love all the characters.

427
00:33:21,944 --> 00:33:22,689
Rym: They're really fun.

428
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:24,450
Scott: There's not that many characters.

429
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:34,730
Rym: Yeah, but it is hard to summarize this book as anything other than calendars are violent and they're a problem.

430
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:36,869
Scott: Yep, they sure are.

431
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,050
Rym: This book is about violent calendars.

432
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,601
Scott: Calendars in the real world are violent too.

433
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:43,089
Scott: Think about it.

434
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,689
Rym: Well, we could always use the metric calendar.

435
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:53,330
Scott: The calendar and the clock in and of themselves are violence against humanity.

436
00:33:53,830 --> 00:34:05,190
Rym: Yep, go read up on why American public schools, when they were formed as a system, used bells the way that they did.

437
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,389
Rym: And that'll teach you everything you need to know about the violence of calendars and clocks.

438
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,882
Scott: Alright, any other meta moment stuff?

439
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:16,770
Scott: We're working on the website big time.

440
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:21,568
Scott: I'm working now on the features involving the uploading of the MP3.

441
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:29,889
Rym: And I am in fact, I am this episode, I am using to test out my pipeline for some of the metadata involved in this process.

442
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:44,110
Scott: And so other than the uploading of the MP3, the only other major features that are missing is the automatic posting to the other social networks, which I've already implemented in the past just to re-implement it better.

443
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:50,849
Rym: And then of course, every place except Patreon has an API.

444
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,085
Scott: No, not every place, but some do, some don't.

445
00:34:55,170 --> 00:35:01,210
Scott: But the other major thing is the transferring of the data from the old database to the new database.

446
00:35:01,552 --> 00:35:03,470
Scott: A little ETL action, that's going to be some effort.

447
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:06,560
Scott: But I have some techniques to make it a little better.

448
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:09,190
Scott: Anyway, so that's coming along.

449
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:12,700
Rym: Otherwise, COVID is skyrocketing.

450
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,489
Rym: Obviously, we're not going to any cons anytime soon.

451
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:22,850
Rym: There's a good chance, unless things go real crazy, at least I will be at PAX West.

452
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:31,709
Rym: But just like the last two PAXes, that'll be for like a couple hours to do a panel, and then I'm going to be off doing some other non-PAX things and some business things.

453
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:39,010
Scott: I've not decided to go or not to go to PAX West yet, but it's not looking likely, who knows?

454
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:47,430
Rym: Yeah, I mean, considering what the COVID numbers, especially the hospitalization numbers look like, even in New York, even in the last 48 hours, it's not a great situation.

455
00:35:49,572 --> 00:35:51,110
Scott: Anyway, let's go to the main bit.

456
00:35:51,434 --> 00:35:52,470
Rym: All right, scanners.

457
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,210
Scott: We miraculously came up with a main bit that we somehow hadn't done yet, hooray.

458
00:35:58,071 --> 00:36:02,030
Rym: Not scanners, the 1981 Canadian science fiction horror movie.

459
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,614
Scott: No, not that one.

460
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:12,810
Scott: The things that really people don't use anymore these days, except for a very few artistic and whatever printing professionals, I guess.

461
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:14,970
Scott: And even some of them don't use them.

462
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:15,694
Rym: Well, it's interesting.

463
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:17,830
Rym: So what is a scanner in a nutshell?

464
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:28,710
Rym: It's a device which, remember, these appeared and were used long before things like smartphones or even digital cameras existed, to give you the context.

465
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,969
Rym: You really got to remember that context.

466
00:36:31,571 --> 00:36:46,550
Rym: In the old days, if you had a computer of any kind and you wanted to get an image into that computer, you had originally one option, and that one option was draw it pixels with pixels somehow.

467
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:55,310
Rym: And then an invention appeared to capture photons and generate an image file from photons.

468
00:36:55,751 --> 00:37:00,030
Rym: That is the origin of both digital cameras and the origin of scanners, essentially.

469
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,979
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, we had the copy machine, right?

470
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:15,270
Scott: So the original scanners, as far as I'm aware, at least for computers, weren't too different from the mechanism in copy machines of the time.

471
00:37:15,812 --> 00:37:21,389
Scott: The only difference was that instead of immediately just printing a copy straightaway...

472
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:27,290
Rym: Well, well, that's already kind of, because a lot of copy machines were not really digital and were using...

473
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,061
Scott: No, yeah, you're talking about the original Xeroxes?

474
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:31,830
Scott: Yeah, those worked completely differently.

475
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:42,750
Rym: Yeah, so once you got to the point where there was a memory buffer with the image that was being scanned that was used to put the output to the paper, that's the era you were talking about.

476
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:44,619
Scott: Yeah, exactly, right?

477
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:46,750
Scott: So, you know, you think about it, right?

478
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:55,070
Scott: It's like you had these devices that were somewhat, in principle, like a laser printer with a scanner attached directly to it, right?

479
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,149
Scott: It's like it's scanned and immediately laser print, you know.

480
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:01,030
Scott: We've done a show on printers and how laser printers work, right?

481
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:02,540
Scott: So you can listen to that.

482
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:03,850
Scott: It's a hundred years old episode.

483
00:38:05,711 --> 00:38:08,138
Scott: So when we had computers, right?

484
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:21,870
Scott: I think in the 90s, the scanners came into existence, at least as an expensive consumer product, the flatbed scanner, and you'd hook it up to your SCSI ports, your parallel ports, or your serial ports, or whatever, before USB existed.

485
00:38:22,731 --> 00:38:27,930
Scott: And you slap a piece of paper down on there, you close the lid, and it would scan it slowly.

486
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:29,352
Scott: Yep.

487
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:39,170
Rym: Actually, my first scanner, so I never had a scanner that we owned, that I had access to directly, just in our house, until late middle school.

488
00:38:41,212 --> 00:38:50,330
Rym: And we actually got a SCSI scanner that was about ten times faster than a serial port or like printer port scanner.

489
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,490
Scott: Yep.

490
00:38:51,752 --> 00:38:56,989
Scott: I mean, I didn't really need or buy one until like after college, and I got a USB one just because they were so cheap.

491
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:58,821
Scott: And then I bought, and then I stopped.

492
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:00,190
Scott: I wasn't using it after a while.

493
00:39:00,391 --> 00:39:04,030
Scott: And then I didn't buy another one until I wanted to scan photos and negatives.

494
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:06,249
Scott: And then I bought a photo-y one, and I still have that.

495
00:39:07,652 --> 00:39:12,190
Scott: But if I wasn't doing photo-y scanning, I wouldn't have the scanner either.

496
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:12,510
Rym: Yep.

497
00:39:12,571 --> 00:39:22,150
Rym: So I just remember as a kid, like using computers in the school, one day in sixth grade, the teacher was like, "So the school has a scanner now.

498
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:31,025
Rym: Everyone's allowed to bring in one picture, and we're gonna scan that picture for you, and give you a bitmap file on a floppy

499
00:39:31,046 --> 00:39:31,307
Rym: disk.".

500
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:37,229
Rym: And it was like, it is hard to express how fucking excited we all were to do this.

501
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:55,590
Scott: Yeah, no, it was pretty amazing back then to be able to just take something that only existed, an image that only existed on a piece of paper of some kind, and then to get that image onto the computer without having to draw it or anything.

502
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,409
Scott: It's like you could put that now on a website or share it.

503
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:07,042
Scott: It's like now, taking a photo and sharing it is the most basic common functionality, but it's also the most fun thing.

504
00:40:07,082 --> 00:40:09,030
Scott: People still love the fuck out of doing that.

505
00:40:09,511 --> 00:40:14,229
Scott: It's like one of the number one uses of phones is take pictures and share them.

506
00:40:15,092 --> 00:40:17,409
Scott: So it's like that wasn't possible to do.

507
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:21,363
Scott: And then if you had a scanner, you could kind of do it, and it was pretty exciting.

508
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:33,988
Rym: So the basic kinds of scanners that existed and still exist were the flatbed ones that you can put a document or a picture or really anything in.

509
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:36,637
Rym: It looks like a Xerox machine.

510
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,315
Rym: There's the ones that are sort of sheet fed, so it looks like a printer.

511
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:47,089
Rym: You put a piece of paper, usually a document in it, and it'll just pull it through and scan it.

512
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,750
Scott: Yeah, that's not too different from the flatbed one.

513
00:40:49,810 --> 00:41:01,548
Scott: The difference is that in the flatbed one, the bar that's doing the scanning is moving and the paper is still, whereas in the sheet fed one, it's like, well, the bar is still and the paper moves across.

514
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:06,483
Rym: There are pros and cons to both approaches, but that doesn't matter that much, and we'll get to that.

515
00:41:07,892 --> 00:41:15,890
Scott: If you're scanning negatives, you can scan film negatives the flatbed way, but they also have these drum scanners that are pretty popular.

516
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:18,350
Rym: I would say that photo scanners.

517
00:41:18,912 --> 00:41:20,321
Scott: You're not going to have one of those at home.

518
00:41:20,421 --> 00:41:26,269
Scott: Photo labs are going to use those, and the reason they use those is because you can scan negatives very quickly with the drum scanner.

519
00:41:27,891 --> 00:41:32,170
Scott: It's like you get speed and quality, and the downside is big machine.

520
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:39,309
Rym: Photo scanners and negative scanners that are dedicated tend to be better at that task than just generic scanners for a lot of reasons.

521
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,230
Scott: Nowadays, it's getting a little fishy in those regards.

522
00:41:45,230 --> 00:42:01,581
Rym: Well, it is because basically, I have the same scanner that we had forever, and the thing that I have the most to say about with scanners is that consumer grade scanners really haven't been improved in any way in at least 15, maybe 20 years.

523
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:09,050
Scott: There's really no need to because the only thing you would use it for is getting documents into PDFs probably.

524
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,809
Rym: Which is what I use my oldest crap Kano scan for.

525
00:42:14,554 --> 00:42:21,609
Scott: And it's like the resolution is going to be high enough that you can print a copy of the document, and it's going to be very, very good.

526
00:42:23,852 --> 00:42:25,744
Scott: Or email the PDF to someone.

527
00:42:25,764 --> 00:42:26,630
Scott: It's going to be very good.

528
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:33,230
Scott: Email the PDF to one of those fax forwarding emails, and it'll come out of a fax machine somewhere and look worse than when it started.

529
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,670
Rym: But I found the image scanning on those things is not great.

530
00:42:37,811 --> 00:42:39,450
Rym: It's okay, but it's not great.

531
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,130
Scott: Well, you can tweak it depending.

532
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,550
Rym: But, you know, it's obviously not going to be professional.

533
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:50,150
Scott: Yeah, it's not professional level, but it's good enough for any of the use cases a normal person has for a scanner.

534
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:52,970
Scott: Well beyond you can scan a book with it slowly.

535
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:56,570
Scott: But, oh, there's the book scanners where they turn the pages and stuff.

536
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:04,530
Rym: But basically there's cheapo scanners like what we just described that are like if you go to any store, those are the scanners you're going to see for sale.

537
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,315
Rym: You can just buy them.

538
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:08,289
Rym: They're like under 100 bucks usually, and they work fine.

539
00:43:09,076 --> 00:43:10,890
Rym: And then there's nothing in the middle.

540
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:14,090
Rym: There's no like middle of the road prosumer scanner.

541
00:43:15,214 --> 00:43:15,780
Scott: That's what I have.

542
00:43:15,841 --> 00:43:16,590
Scott: I have prosumer scanner.

543
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:17,447
Rym: How much do you pay for that?

544
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,030
Rym: And is the material better?

545
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:20,838
Scott: I don't know what it costs.

546
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:21,827
Scott: What does it cost now?

547
00:43:22,896 --> 00:43:30,163
Rym: Because I'm looking at scanners right now, and it's between 80 and 200 bucks for like a regular scanner, and then it's 500 bucks.

548
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:36,617
Scott: If you want to buy an Epson Perfection V600 photo scanner, the MSRP is $300, right?

549
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,570
Scott: So it's like the only reason that you would buy this, right?

550
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:56,210
Scott: It basically has no function over a cheapo scanner other than the fact that it's high resolution enough and has color correcting tools and whatnot so that you can actually scan photos and negatives.

551
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,381
Rym: How good are those color correcting tools?

552
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:02,590
Scott: I mean, you have to use them, right?

553
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,990
Scott: The automatic ones are obviously automatic ones, right?

554
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,010
Scott: It's like you just do it yourself.

555
00:44:08,753 --> 00:44:12,650
Scott: Some people use them and some people just scan and then go to Photoshop, right?

556
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,229
Scott: So it's sort of up to you either way.

557
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,870
Scott: But, you know, it's like that's a prosumer.

558
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:23,850
Scott: The only use case that the prosumer use case for scanning is photos, right?

559
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:30,110
Scott: There isn't another reason that you would need higher resolution or better colors than a cheap scanner unless it's photos.

560
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,449
Scott: What else could you scan in the world?

561
00:44:31,993 --> 00:44:37,190
Rym: The only other use case that would age into prosumer would be the bulk scanning of documents.

562
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:50,610
Rym: Like you're scanning contracts and you're scanning like you're going through like every document your family ever generated and scanning them, that kind of thing, where the sheet fed like advanced features of batching the scanning so you don't have to sit there and scan everything.

563
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,690
Scott: You'll usually go somewhere to do that, right?

564
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:56,129
Scott: Like you can go, for example, to your local copy shop, right?

565
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:03,730
Scott: And you could load a stack of papers into the left side of one of those big like multifunction scanner, printer, copier things.

566
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,988
Rym: And basically tell it, spit out a whole bunch of PDFs.

567
00:45:06,731 --> 00:45:09,750
Scott: Well, you can tell it to make one PDF with many pages.

568
00:45:09,972 --> 00:45:11,770
Scott: You can tell it to make a bunch of PDFs.

569
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:17,190
Scott: You can tell it all kinds of things and it'll just email you the result or send you a download link to the result, right, to your phone.

570
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:24,448
Scott: It's like, you know, you can just walk in with papers, put them in, push a button, walk out, you know, put some quarters in there, right?

571
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,930
Scott: Or probably tap your phone to pay and then that's it, right?

572
00:45:29,255 --> 00:45:34,590
Scott: If you have an office that you still go to that has one of those machines, you could do the same thing, right?

573
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,450
Scott: It'll email you the results to your work email.

574
00:45:37,091 --> 00:45:44,770
Rym: So what I found, though, is that all the consumer level scanners, they pretty much, like even a one from 20 years ago, works just fine.

575
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:51,810
Rym: Like a CanoScan whatever from 20 years ago, identical quality to whatever the latest CanoScan is.

576
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,624
Rym: The only difference is that the new ones probably scan faster.

577
00:45:57,131 --> 00:46:02,428
Rym: They probably use USB 3 or like something more modern than the USB 2 that the old ones use.

578
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:05,456
Rym: Maybe.

579
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:13,850
Scott: A lot of them nowadays come in like combos with printers and copier scanner like all in one and they'll be wireless, right?

580
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:17,670
Scott: So they'll get on your Wi-Fi so that all the devices in your home can use them.

581
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:26,950
Scott: So that way, like, you know, it's been that way for quite a while, like five to ten years, if not probably ten plus years where you just plug this in somewhere in your house within Wi-Fi range.

582
00:46:27,392 --> 00:46:30,729
Scott: It doesn't need to connect to anything with a cable other than power, right?

583
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:47,050
Scott: You fill it up with ink and paper and now you can scan, print, fax, et cetera, copy, and you can send things from your phone or literally any device on your whole home network to it to print or scan something on it and send that to any device, right?

584
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:51,190
Scott: It's like you could put a piece of paper, get the piece of paper on a phone, tablet, whatever.

585
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,197
Scott: And that's what I imagine.

586
00:46:53,698 --> 00:47:03,169
Scott: if you are a household in the world today and you still for some reason need to scan and print, that's the kind of device that you're going to have.

587
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:18,450
Rym: But where I was going, all those old consumer scanners from 20 plus years ago, they work just fine today, but almost categorically, the companies that sold that hardware just don't have drivers for any modern operating system.

588
00:47:18,872 --> 00:47:20,903
Scott: Well, because it's an old unsupported device.

589
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,270
Scott: Why would they update their driver?

590
00:47:23,653 --> 00:47:28,430
Scott: You can often use the generic, there's like a standard called TWAIN.

591
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:29,749
Rym: I was going to bring up TWAIN.

592
00:47:30,231 --> 00:47:32,246
Scott: I never knew what TWAIN stood for my whole life.

593
00:47:32,306 --> 00:47:32,830
Scott: I still don't.

594
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:34,690
Scott: I guess I could Google it right now and find out.

595
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:38,070
Rym: I look it up every time it comes up and then I forget it immediately after.

596
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,950
Scott: TWAIN is basically some standard protocol for scanners to talk to computers.

597
00:47:43,532 --> 00:47:44,054
Rym: Oh, no.

598
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:44,957
Rym: You know why?

599
00:47:45,058 --> 00:47:46,081
Rym: We never remember.

600
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:48,530
Rym: It's not actually an acronym.

601
00:47:49,651 --> 00:47:50,574
Rym: It's a background.

602
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:54,829
Rym: It was just called TWAIN and then people made up what it stood for.

603
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:56,212
Scott: Oh, okay.

604
00:47:56,252 --> 00:48:06,350
Scott: But anyway, it's basically a protocol for scanners and computers to talk to each other in a standard way so that you could get a computer that knows how to speak TWAIN and a scanner that knows how to speak TWAIN.

605
00:48:06,811 --> 00:48:09,850
Scott: And then, look, you can scan even if you don't have a driver.

606
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:20,950
Scott: The problem is that the drivers, the official drivers for a particular scanner, will often provide you with lots and lots of extra features that are often not part of the TWAIN standard.

607
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:24,630
Rym: And depending on what kind of scanner it is, they're either helpful or annoying.

608
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:25,953
Scott: Right.

609
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:32,590
Scott: And then if you just use TWAIN, like a generic scanner driver, your options for scanning are going to be very, very limited.

610
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:35,585
Scott: It's pretty much going to be scan a page, the end.

611
00:48:35,605 --> 00:48:36,249
Scott: That's all you can do.

612
00:48:36,912 --> 00:48:43,870
Rym: Well, as the software does, I actually have been using TWAIN quite a bit because I've been doing a lot of scanning over the last few years for a bunch of reasons.

613
00:48:44,612 --> 00:48:45,758
Rym: So I'm going to read first.

614
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:51,410
Rym: Here is actually what TWAIN stands for, unless this is someone has vandalized Wikipedia just recently.

615
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:54,429
Rym: "The word TWAIN is not an acronym but a backronym.

616
00:48:54,790 --> 00:49:06,968
Rym: The official website notes that the word TWAIN is from Kipling's 'The Ballad of East and West' and the line 'And never the TWAIN shall meet,' reflecting the difficulty at the time of connecting scanners to personal

617
00:49:07,008 --> 00:49:07,390
Rym: computers.".

618
00:49:08,733 --> 00:49:08,950
Scott: Uh-huh.

619
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:14,810
Rym: That's the best explanation for the name of a computer thing that I've seen in a long time.

620
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,130
Rym: That's actually kind of funny.

621
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,373
Scott: All right.

622
00:49:17,394 --> 00:49:18,209
Scott: I learned something today.

623
00:49:18,511 --> 00:49:19,436
Rym: I learned something, too.

624
00:49:19,497 --> 00:49:21,368
Rym: This is why I keep forgetting this every time I look it up.

625
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:29,470
Rym: But I have an ancient, ancient Canon scanner that there's no driver on Earth for a modern computer.

626
00:49:30,773 --> 00:49:34,890
Rym: It plugs into a USB 3, but it's definitely just USB 2.

627
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,670
Rym: But the hardware is totally fine.

628
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:47,070
Rym: So the way I use it is I'll either have Photoshop use TWAIN to control it directly, scan directly into Photoshop, or I'll have Adobe Acrobat use it directly.

629
00:49:47,692 --> 00:49:49,930
Scott: Adobe Acrobat directly scanning is pretty good, actually.

630
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,390
Rym: Adobe Acrobat directly scanning.

631
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:55,344
Rym: Like, talking about the side benefits of paying for Creative Cloud.

632
00:49:55,364 --> 00:49:58,990
Rym: if you need some Adobe software and you just get everything else along with the ride.

633
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:08,150
Rym: If you've got, say, a bunch of old documents like, I don't know, car maintenance receipts or, uh, leases that you want to scan.

634
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:15,249
Rym: Like, you want to throw away old papers, but you want to scan them in and save them as PDFs in case you need them to give to a lawyer 20 years from now.

635
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:22,929
Rym: Adobe Acrobat is a really great way to do that because you just batch up these scannings and it'll just make a PDF for you one by one.

636
00:50:24,774 --> 00:50:34,728
Scott: Alright, so the thing I want to talk about that's, like, you know, I guess not super recent, but basically the current deal of scanning is that for high resolution, high quality scans.

637
00:50:34,788 --> 00:50:44,469
Scott: these days, a lot of people, like, in the photo world, but also other worlds, right, have basically abandoned scanners, right, as the way to go.

638
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:48,190
Scott: Instead, people are just using digital cameras.

639
00:50:48,651 --> 00:51:17,550
Scott: It's like, if you just take whatever it is that you want to scan, say, a negative or a photo or magazine or whatever, you just line it up flat on some surface, right, light it appropriately with lights, right, to get evenly lit, get a digital camera with an appropriate lens, mount the camera aiming straight down, right, line everything up, you know, do the manual focus and take a picture.

640
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:21,018
Scott: And that's going to be the digital cameras.

641
00:51:21,058 --> 00:51:34,350
Scott: now, even if you use your phone, are so good, right, that, like, first of all, this is going to, A, the quality, it might beat a lot of almost all scanners.

642
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:42,829
Rym: Especially because a lot of apps or a lot of pipelines to do this with phones will do things like if you take the photo at an angle, it'll correct for that.

643
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:47,490
Scott: Yeah, there's all kinds of software that helps this process, makes it easier, makes it better.

644
00:51:48,590 --> 00:52:01,590
Scott: But also, in terms of the speed of the process, it's like, if you want to scan something, it's like, all right, line it up, change these settings, push scan, wait, get a document.

645
00:52:02,871 --> 00:52:09,050
Scott: It's like, right, if you've just taken photos as scanning, right, it's like, click, there it is.

646
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:14,230
Scott: It already goes directly from the physical world into the exact end place.

647
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:19,790
Scott: You're bypassing all this, like, scanning process, all the manual labor of scanning things, right.

648
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,699
Scott: It's just sort of eliminated, right.

649
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:25,729
Scott: It's like, oh, I just now have an SD card that has all my files on it.

650
00:52:27,255 --> 00:52:28,509
Scott: It's like, you're good to go.

651
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:44,930
Scott: You know, the only times that this process might be a little cumbersome is the final topic of scanning, which has been, I guess, what is OCR, right, which stands for optical character recognition.

652
00:52:45,090 --> 00:53:05,210
Scott: And this is sort of not necessarily scanning itself, but a post scanning process where, okay, you scanned something, you've turned a physical, you know, flat document into an image, a JPEG, a TIFF or whatever image file, but you didn't actually want to create a raster image of a thing like a photo.

653
00:53:05,731 --> 00:53:13,070
Scott: You wanted the words in some alphabet translated not into a JPEG, but into a text file.

654
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:20,409
Rym: So like scan in an essay and then be able to search through the text in that essay like it's a text file, not like it's an image.

655
00:53:21,253 --> 00:53:21,494
Scott: Right.

656
00:53:21,575 --> 00:53:25,090
Scott: So the software to do OCR has gotten better over time.

657
00:53:25,331 --> 00:53:26,809
Scott: The image resolution is better.

658
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:36,610
Scott: So that especially if you're OCRing something that was printed right out of another computer or is like an officially printed document, it's in English especially.

659
00:53:37,374 --> 00:53:39,070
Scott: And you're using modern software.

660
00:53:39,793 --> 00:53:41,950
Scott: The results are going to be very, very good.

661
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:43,470
Rym: This used to not be the case.

662
00:53:43,751 --> 00:53:46,329
Rym: I remember paying a lot of money as a kid.

663
00:53:47,072 --> 00:53:48,717
Rym: Well, our family to get.

664
00:53:48,778 --> 00:53:52,490
Rym: so I forget what it was called, but there were some OCR softwares you could buy.

665
00:53:52,831 --> 00:53:53,032
Scott: Oh, yeah.

666
00:53:53,112 --> 00:53:57,110
Scott: In the 90s, you could get on CD-ROM, you could buy an OCR thing and it's like they work kinda.

667
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:58,910
Rym: They work kinda is the way I'd say.

668
00:53:58,955 --> 00:53:59,068
Rym: Okay.

669
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,709
Rym: I pirated one that worked better.

670
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:06,850
Scott: It worked well enough that it was better to do that and then correct the document than to just type it all in by hand.

671
00:54:07,274 --> 00:54:07,464
Rym: Yeah.

672
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,430
Scott: But it was still a pain in the ass.

673
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:12,330
Scott: Nowadays, you might barely have to type anything in my hand at all.

674
00:54:12,572 --> 00:54:14,970
Rym: Adobe Acrobat in particular just does it.

675
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:25,830
Rym: If I scan a document and it sees it's a document, it automatically does all the OCR it can and it is just 100% accurate unless my document is really fucked up.

676
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:27,749
Scott: Or the scan is fucked up.

677
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:35,070
Scott: But the place the OCR matters the most is when you want to scan a printed book into an e-book.

678
00:54:36,111 --> 00:54:47,470
Scott: And so that's where you have libraries and places have these special book scanners that basically hold the book open, take photos of both pages, turn the page, take photos of both pages.

679
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:51,790
Rym: And that's where you get into non-destructive scanning versus destructive scanning.

680
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:57,670
Rym: Like tearing a book apart to scan it will be better than carefully scanning it in a way that doesn't destroy it.

681
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:00,530
Scott: But if it's a rare special book, you can't do that.

682
00:55:00,952 --> 00:55:01,188
Rym: Exactly.

683
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,650
Scott: Whereas if it's a normal old book, it's like go right ahead.

684
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:04,058
Rym: Yup.

685
00:55:04,311 --> 00:55:08,870
Scott: But if it's a newer book, you don't even need to do that because it started life as an e-book.

686
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:19,590
Scott: It's only this narrow few decades of books that were printed but they're not rare and valuable so we can tear apart one copy of each to get them scanned.

687
00:55:21,231 --> 00:55:26,090
Rym: But also people's pipelines are different in terms of what they do with documents.

688
00:55:27,313 --> 00:55:29,230
Rym: Most people don't even have a desktop computer anymore.

689
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:30,930
Rym: A lot of people don't even have laptops anymore.

690
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:36,230
Rym: So increasingly I think the way people will scan things, like one, they won't have photos to scan anymore.

691
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:46,490
Rym: Physical photos to scan are just because we're old enough to have physical photos lying around or a relative dies and you get their pile of physical photos.

692
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:49,689
Rym: You realize no one ever scanned them in and you scan them all in in one go.

693
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:56,930
Scott: So I think this is what we're seeing is like, you know, even though there's still plenty of stuff in the world that needs scanning, right?

694
00:55:57,851 --> 00:55:59,959
Scott: We're seeing people who are younger than us.

695
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:03,130
Scott: Their whole lives did not include anything that needs scanning.

696
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:04,694
Rym: Yeah, mostly the teenagers today.

697
00:56:04,855 --> 00:56:08,870
Rym: There's nothing, there's no essay they wrote by hand that they will ever need.

698
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:11,820
Scott: They've never received a paper bill in the mail.

699
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,666
Scott: They've never filed taxes on paper.

700
00:56:13,726 --> 00:56:14,810
Scott: They've never done any, right?

701
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:17,016
Scott: It's like there's nothing in their lives to scan.

702
00:56:17,056 --> 00:56:21,990
Scott: So it's really an older generation of people that have paper things to scan in their lives.

703
00:56:22,511 --> 00:56:29,410
Scott: And if they either A) scan everything, then they don't need a scanner anymore because their lives are now digital or B) they die.

704
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,356
Scott: And now it's like, well, that's it.

705
00:56:33,058 --> 00:56:37,030
Scott: So the only people who really need scanners now, right?

706
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:44,330
Scott: In this world where people are living fully digital lives are people who are still living in parts of the world where it's not fully digital and they're going to transition.

707
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:45,568
Scott: They haven't made this transition yet.

708
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:48,290
Rym: Or people with professional interests.

709
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:55,450
Scott: Right, archivists, you know, artists, photographers, someone with some reason, right, to scan.

710
00:56:55,931 --> 00:57:03,530
Scott: And so, you know, we probably could make, if they wanted to, like really fucking amazing scanners if someone really tried.

711
00:57:03,971 --> 00:57:13,230
Scott: But just the use case, the demand is already dropping off and is only going to drop off further as, you know, it's like scanning solved this temporary problem.

712
00:57:13,932 --> 00:57:19,746
Scott: And it's there for those who need it and fewer and fewer and fewer people need it as time goes on.

713
00:57:19,766 --> 00:57:20,909
Scott: And that's it.

714
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:22,255
Rym: Like what do I scan now?

715
00:57:22,315 --> 00:57:25,190
Rym: Like after I did all that big bulk scanning of all my old documents.

716
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,839
Rym: Like I got some work done in my car recently.

717
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,210
Rym: The guy had a paper bill.

718
00:57:30,991 --> 00:57:32,069
Scott: He didn't email you the thing?

719
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,173
Rym: Nah.

720
00:57:33,193 --> 00:57:37,630
Rym: He emailed me videos of all the work he did, but the actual bill and everything was a printout.

721
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,190
Rym: So I scanned it and then I shredded that document.

722
00:57:41,931 --> 00:57:42,154
Scott: Yep.

723
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:43,648
Scott: There you go.

724
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:47,018
Rym: And maybe I do this every couple months.

725
00:57:47,038 --> 00:57:50,250
Rym: I have like one thing that I scan because I want to throw away the piece of paper.

726
00:57:50,831 --> 00:57:51,175
Rym: That's it.

727
00:57:51,397 --> 00:57:52,590
Rym: That's the only reason I have a scanner.

728
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:58,050
Scott: Yeah, I think the only thing I scan is really like my lease is still on paper, I guess, and I renew it.

729
00:57:58,470 --> 00:57:58,873
Rym: Oh, yeah.

730
00:57:59,114 --> 00:58:00,441
Rym: I do scan the lease in.

731
00:58:00,462 --> 00:58:01,950
Rym: So every two years I pre-scan the lease.

732
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:04,093
Scott: I think that's the only paper thing I have left.

733
00:58:04,193 --> 00:58:05,015
Scott: that's like a, you know.

734
00:58:05,035 --> 00:58:08,700
Scott: Alright.

735
00:58:15,103 --> 00:58:17,240
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

736
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,380
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

737
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,800
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

738
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,700
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

739
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:35,460
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

740
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,976
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

741
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,280
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

742
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:46,400
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

743
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:19,839
Rym: Queen's Park, Queen's Park Station, and a bunch of people whose names I will not say in twain.

744
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,870
Rym: I can't believe that is what twain stands for.

745
00:59:23,131 --> 00:59:25,340
Rym: I feel like I've looked that up at least ten times in my life.

746
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,585
Rym: Let me never forget it.

747
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:29,320
Rym: So anyway, I got nothing else today.

748
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:35,351
Rym: I'm real hungry, so I'm just going to sign off right here, so I simply leave you with... Welcome to Brownstone National Park.

749
00:59:36,356 --> 00:59:37,179
Rym: And now a few rules.

750
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:42,460
Rym: No hunting, no fishing, no swimming, no drinking, no fires, no going over to the invader if you go into that section.

751
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,525
Rym: But don't do that either.

752
00:59:43,946 --> 00:59:46,840
Rym: And remember, don't molest the bears.

753
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:51,299
Rym: Then it cuts to Donald, who has a really funny expression on his face.

754
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:54,152
Rym: Almost as if he wanted to molest the bears.

755
00:59:54,192 --> 00:59:55,036
Rym: He's kind of like,

756
00:59:55,096 --> 00:59:55,498
Rym: "Wah!".
