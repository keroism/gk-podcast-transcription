00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,130
Rym: It's Monday February 7th 2022.

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,378
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,418 --> 00:00:18,014
Rym: We talk about technological lock-in.

4
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:19,998
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:24,918
Scott: So I had this problem with my computer, you know a ways back.

6
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:28,380
Scott: wait Wait, I thought I'm the person who doesn't have problems with my computer.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:41,820
Rym: I just I've got to point out there was a recent recent conversation where we were playing some games with a friend of ours and You were making a point that you'd never have computer problems and somehow everyone else has computer problems.

8
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:48,100
Scott: So yep, because I'm gonna describe this computer problem to you and it's gonna turn out that it was not actually a computer problem.

9
00:00:48,702 --> 00:00:48,964
Rym: It was.

10
00:00:49,104 --> 00:00:51,032
Rym: it was a in fact a failure of Scott.

11
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:52,920
Scott: It was a failure of Microsoft.

12
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:57,720
Rym: So I would I would not blame Microsoft because all I will say is that I blame Microsoft.

13
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:01,110
Rym: I knew that the thing you're about to describe happened.

14
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,972
Scott: You didn't know this.

15
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:02,434
Scott: Yes.

16
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:13,212
Rym: I didn't know this because you know The same thing happened to me once a long time ago and it was an Xbox controller and That's the default mapping.

17
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:21,510
Scott: Anyway so anyway What was happening was when I opened the settings box in?

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:34,005
Scott: Windows 10 or 11 it was scrolling down Automatically and like I would try to scroll up to get to the top of the window and it would like fight against me and scroll Back down again.

19
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:36,179
Scott: It was like and it wasn't in any other app.

20
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:41,980
Rym: You see that is the one thing that was a little weird because when I had this happen, it also affected my web browsers.

21
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:47,319
Scott: yeah, so only in the windows settings app.

22
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:48,302
Scott: Specifically.

23
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:52,895
Scott: I even tried other Microsoft apps that use the same GUI framework like Windows Store.

24
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:53,857
Scott: Nope.

25
00:01:53,877 --> 00:01:54,820
Scott: They work just fine.

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:06,535
Scott: It was only the settings app was scrolling down and I it's it was like someone else had an evil mouse plugged into my computer Ghost and was scrolling their mouse wheel down as hard as they could.

27
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:09,244
Scott: I could fight against it a little bit But not really.

28
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:16,925
Scott: so I searched and I searched and I searched and I searched and finally I found a person who was like, hey Do you have like a gamepad plugged in?

29
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:22,179
Scott: and I'm like I. I have a gamepad plugged in and sure enough if you have an?

30
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:32,646
Scott: HID USB gamepad plugged in The Microsoft Windows settings app in Windows 10 and 11 Responds to the gamepad.

31
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:46,139
Scott: you can you can move around you can select things and the left and right triggers Scroll up and down and that means if you have your controller on your desk And something is bumping the right trigger.

32
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:48,169
Scott: It's gonna scroll down all the time.

33
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,595
Scott: as soon as I unplug the gamepad.

34
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:50,539
Scott: Everything was perfect.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,763
Scott: So I Agree that.

36
00:02:54,803 --> 00:02:58,920
Scott: that's probably like the ability to control windows or the gamepad.

37
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:07,850
Scott: You know any app is a good feature but why Does why do agree with you on things only?

38
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,500
Scott: Yeah, how would you even open Windows settings with the gamepad?

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,549
Rym: It's like all those games that have an accessibility menu.

40
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,620
Rym: That's behind the inaccessible opening menu, right?

41
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,229
Scott: So I did learn something else in my experimentation.

42
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:21,313
Scott: There is a button on my.

43
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,260
Scott: I have an SN 30 Pro Plus.

44
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,540
Scott: There is a button which is like, you know, it's like a. I don't know what you would call this button.

45
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,392
Scott: I guess on a switch controller, it would be like the plus or the minus.

46
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:33,178
Scott: maybe it's like down here on.

47
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:34,303
Scott: you know It's I don't know.

48
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:36,538
Scott: It's button 11 12, whatever the hell button it is.

49
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:41,556
Scott: But if I hold that button down like not it's not a toggle.

50
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:42,700
Scott: I have to hold it down.

51
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:50,180
Scott: If I am holding that button down then the right stick becomes will control the mouse.

52
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:54,853
Scott: You know, the contriggers will scroll like as long as that button is being held.

53
00:03:54,873 --> 00:03:59,234
Scott: I can control anything in Windows Using the gamepad.

54
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:02,093
Scott: Ooh So that's useful.

55
00:04:02,254 --> 00:04:03,200
Scott: That's that's not bad.

56
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:11,945
Scott: I mean It should be a toggle but regardless you can control all of Windows with a gamepad if you hold down the correct button Depending what gamepad you have.

57
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:17,019
Scott: but why would the settings app be different and not require the button to be held down?

58
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:20,052
Scott: That's you know, yeah, there's my computer.

59
00:04:20,353 --> 00:04:21,660
Scott: I thought it was a software issue.

60
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:28,200
Scott: I was restart cuz like it wasn't a hardware issue cuz I unplugged all the mice and keyboards and it still happened.

61
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:36,697
Rym: Yeah So I would have definitely assumed input device because I'm a weirdo who usually has two different keyboards plugged into my computer Like a little organ set up.

62
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,020
Scott: So well, usually usually my gamepad is plugged into charging only and then I'll only switch it too.

63
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,968
Scott: But you know, I forgot to switch it that one time.

64
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:46,820
Rym: I think I'm doing lately so but an annoyance along those lines.

65
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,174
Rym: So I got my logitech like the g502 like the default gaming mouse.

66
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:51,716
Rym: Basically.

67
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:52,980
Rym: I've had this thing forever.

68
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,460
Rym: Well, actually I've had three of them because the scroll wheels do break.

69
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:57,867
Rym: I just haven't found a better mouse.

70
00:04:57,888 --> 00:05:04,300
Rym: So I keep buying the same thing like an idiot but If I use my main keyboard instead of my gaming keyboard.

71
00:05:05,202 --> 00:05:19,781
Rym: The edge of the keyboard is at the exact right height to where it's very easy to bump the DPI toggle button on the mouse And suddenly change the DPI while I'm like mid FPS Mm-hmm.

72
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:22,551
Scott: So another small computer thing right where my.

73
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:25,200
Scott: I thought my computer is broken, but actually I ended up fixing it.

74
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:33,182
Scott: Yeah, so my podcast setup, you know usually involved, you know for the remote podcast is I three applications Right.

75
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:39,851
Scott: I have an audio interface and the audio interface Presents to the connects to the computer of the USB cable.

76
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:42,180
Scott: It has two inputs and it's also an output.

77
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:47,060
Scott: It's basically a fancy sound card with XLR inputs and it presents to the computer.

78
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:51,089
Scott: Right, obviously two as you audio inputs that are both mono.

79
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:55,460
Scott: and it presents to the computer a standard audio output for playing audio.

80
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:02,676
Scott: No and it presents to the computer an analog audio input that works like a normal Windows microphone would right.

81
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:03,137
Scott: and that's it.

82
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,400
Scott: and What I would do to make the podcast work remotely is I'd use three programs.

83
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,620
Scott: I would use OBS with an ASIO plug-in to capture my microphone.

84
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:23,092
Scott: Then I would use discord to talk to Rym and in order to get the audio from You know my the ASIO over to discord so Rym could hear.

85
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:29,980
Scott: what I was saying is I had a fake Audio driver that has like a like a fake microphone and a fake speaker.

86
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:48,600
Scott: So I would tell OBS that to monitor my voice right send the audio to the fake Mic, you know speaker now and then that fake speaker gets routed to a fake microphone Which in that fake microphone would be the would be the discord microphone and then audition is recording on the side.

87
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,706
Scott: It's just recording from the ASIO directly.

88
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:51,228
Scott: No problem.

89
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,876
Scott: And so that's how I've been doing it for a year.

90
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:55,880
Rym: two years however long Yeah, but I love it.

91
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:05,577
Rym: I'm not up on that Windows stuff because I've had professional audio nonsense plugged into my computer for yeah over a day I've been doing it with this fake audio router plug-in.

92
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:08,868
Scott: Yeah, so It suddenly just stopped working.

93
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:12,519
Scott: It was always kind of garbage II but it stopped working just now.

94
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:16,680
Scott: So I'm messing around and I'm uninstalling it reinstalling it.

95
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,634
Scott: It's not you know, it's I fixed it a little bit, but it wasn't.

96
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:21,645
Scott: you know, it was a little choppy It wasn't great.

97
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:35,304
Scott: So I'm like, you know what, you know like I just said the audio interface does have that sort of normal microphone the non ASIO one and For some reason I remember when I first tried to use it Which so is

98
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:41,100
Rym: very likely if you're using MME or you're using like non-professional audio hardware in Windows.

99
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:46,279
Rym: There are situations where things that seem like they should work might work.

100
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:56,277
Rym: Sometimes they do work like having two applications get audio from the same device like sometimes it just works in Windows, but sometimes it just fucking doesn't.

101
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,953
Rym: and Better now than it used to be.

102
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:05,495
Rym: but go back like Four or five years or even worse go back to like earlier versions of Windows.

103
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:06,700
Rym: It rarely worked.

104
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,350
Scott: So because I was just frustrated and fighting with the fake cable would have taken a long time I said, you know what?

105
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,500
Scott: Let me try that thing again.

106
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,340
Scott: I haven't tried it since I first got it, you know.

107
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:23,992
Scott: And in fact, I just realized while I was talking just now when I first got it was Windows 10 Maybe Windows 11 to fix something.

108
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:27,920
Scott: I don't know it's possible But I tried it again and that totally works.

109
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,780
Scott: So now I don't need the fake audio cable and I don't even need to open OBS anymore.

110
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:44,147
Scott: now all I got is discord which is using the you know, The the regular microphone that the audio interface presents to the computer and I got audition recording from ASIO input one Both at the same time.

111
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:45,253
Scott: Rym can hear me.

112
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:46,439
Scott: He said I actually sound better.

113
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:48,606
Rym: You do actually sound better.

114
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:50,673
Rym: It is noteworthy how much better you sound.

115
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:56,688
Scott: It sounds like raw audio and And Audition is recording me just fine.

116
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,338
Scott: I even played back a little bit recording to make sure it was working.

117
00:08:59,398 --> 00:08:59,780
Scott: It works.

118
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:01,491
Scott: Yeah, I don't even know OBS open.

119
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:02,899
Scott: My whole thing is simpler.

120
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:06,913
Scott: So what appeared to be a computer problem was actually a computer improvement.

121
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:08,698
Scott: I'm gonna uninstall that fake audio.

122
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:15,860
Scott: Yeah And I guess to remove all the podcasting stuff from OBS because I don't need it for podcasting anymore.

123
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:18,431
Scott: Yeah, and yeah, so I don't have computer problems.

124
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:19,154
Scott: I have the opposite.

125
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:23,304
Scott: I have computer gets better It's.

126
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:24,720
Rym: uh, it's interesting.

127
00:09:24,861 --> 00:09:32,799
Rym: I guess my advice to all of you is if you have Fucky audio setups that you're trying to use for live streaming like multiple microphones or nonsense from a long time ago

128
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,541
Scott: Try

129
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:40,670
Rym: just making stuff work the obvious simple way because Windows might have gotten better enough and applications might have gotten better enough.

130
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:44,300
Scott: I mean my advice just in general in life is to try.

131
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,746
Scott: Things is right.

132
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,280
Scott: It's try to use as few things as possible, right?

133
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:52,390
Scott: The only place I can't avoid this is at work because at work.

134
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:55,180
Scott: they like to keep adding more software as a service things.

135
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,507
Scott: Whereas I'm like, you know, we're already using GitHub for source control.

136
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:02,693
Scott: Why don't we also use it for everything?

137
00:10:02,753 --> 00:10:03,576
Scott: It does right.

138
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:06,390
Scott: instead of being like, you know It's like you got your JIRA in there.

139
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:13,899
Rym: It's like get up as project management Right, I've yeah, I've used that it's JIRA is just better.

140
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:18,746
Scott: Well, I mean it's better for but here's not better for the developers I like.

141
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:20,113
Scott: all I need is a fucking to-do list.

142
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,283
Scott: I don't need all that JIRA crap It's it.

143
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:24,250
Scott: the point is just an example of like.

144
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:31,635
Scott: if you've already got a tool in your you know Toolbox and that tool has a swiss army knife, you know has a knife and a can opener.

145
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:33,320
Scott: don't go and buy a can opener.

146
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:34,744
Rym: Well case important

147
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:35,325
Scott: open, you know

148
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:53,160
Rym: what changed my life more than anything technologically in like my entire adulthood was the simple Change in Adobe to where the entire creative cloud was just all together in one package always updating Because I use like easily half those applications like constantly now, right?

149
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,002
Scott: well I use.

150
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:58,259
Scott: I use a good handful of them that it's still worth paying for but that is a good example of.

151
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:04,586
Scott: there are a Lot of times where I'm like, you know, suddenly I need something that does X and it's like wait I have paid for Adobe.

152
00:11:04,646 --> 00:11:06,354
Scott: I have a thing that does like the other day.

153
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,520
Rym: I had a bunch of old documents.

154
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,727
Rym: I wanted to scan them so I could throw those documents away.

155
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:17,769
Rym: that is way faster and easier to do with acrobat than with like Photoshop or Random online probably malware tool.

156
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,097
Scott: It's like I think a lot of people out there.

157
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,060
Scott: It's like I need a font.

158
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,371
Scott: They'll go to their browser and search for a font.

159
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:23,914
Scott: I don't do that.

160
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:26,385
Scott: I have typed whatever it's like it Yeah in Adobe.

161
00:11:26,505 --> 00:11:27,952
Scott: Yeah, I guess great a font though.

162
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:31,423
Rym: The licensing of those fonts is Iffy, but you got it.

163
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:32,166
Scott: You got a check.

164
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:35,138
Scott: any wherever you get your font from you got to check the licensing.

165
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:41,920
Rym: Yeah As someone who has been responsible for checking the licensing of fonts before professionally at my last company.

166
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,260
Rym: Even then The almost no font is actually safe to use.

167
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:53,060
Scott: It's like a really fucked up area Usually only a problem if you're using it on your website or in a program that you're distributing.

168
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,099
Scott: Yeah Something like that.

169
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,037
Scott: If you're just like making a social media post and you need a font or something like that.

170
00:11:59,137 --> 00:11:59,880
Scott: You can use the phone.

171
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,414
Rym: Yeah, you know who runs into with the most indie game developers.

172
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,030
Scott: Yep Definitely need to pay for your fonts in your indie game.

173
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,032
Scott: And in fact, I would recommend if you're making games Make your fonts also.

174
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:14,683
Scott: Yeah It'll be a lot that goes.

175
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:20,440
Rym: honestly having someone make a font for you is probably cheaper than licensing a lot of fonts.

176
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:31,133
Scott: Just also if you're me if you have a game, you probably don't you know most video games especially indie games You don't need a full as font Right and most a lot of pixely indie games.

177
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:32,360
Scott: You just need a pixel font also.

178
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,731
Scott: So you don't even you know, and how many letters do you?

179
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:35,896
Scott: how many characters do you need?

180
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:36,780
Scott: You know full Unicode?

181
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:51,580
Rym: We don't use the letter E in this game Right, yeah, so so uh in some news So as you all know Tesla cars are basically just garbage like there's so much you just we don't even need to get into it.

182
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,656
Scott: But yeah, I mean the TLDR of electric cars.

183
00:12:55,817 --> 00:13:01,920
Scott: is you know You're not really helping solving climate change and the problems of the world unless you just have less cars.

184
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:16,346
Scott: Yeah, but an electric car is still I guess better than a fossil fuel car kinda Yep, but it's still not a. it's not a huge improvement over a fossil fuel car and it's sad that you know Tesla the company specifically.

185
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:21,002
Scott: as opposed to other electric car companies those cars are just garbage Like.

186
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:23,718
Scott: if you want an electric car, there are other ones you can get.

187
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:25,448
Rym: that's it Way way better.

188
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:32,959
Rym: people think of Tesla's and they're really expensive But honestly like even the Chevy electric car is way better than a Tesla if we're ready.

189
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:46,159
Scott: Yeah, I read a thread on Twitter that I don't know if it's a hundred percent true but it feels true and You know all the evidence points to it being true and that Tesla has a problem getting repeat customers and someone buys a Tesla.

190
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,030
Scott: the Experience of owning one is so bad that they won't buy another one.

191
00:13:50,211 --> 00:13:55,285
Rym: when the Tesla consider for a while that reddit group about Tesla's it was people like.

192
00:13:55,767 --> 00:14:12,274
Rym: basically there was a huge number of people who had the option of either Accept the new Tesla they'd been waiting for for like seven months or more but it has defects and they could either sign off that they were willing to deal with those defects and get the car right now or refuse it which was their right.

193
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:23,319
Rym: and Maybe in six more months, you'll get a Tesla and they're basically like agreeing to take a like broken car Because they're afraid of having to wait longer to get a working one.

194
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:28,380
Rym: Yeah, that does not happen with any other goddamn car in America, right?

195
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:32,916
Scott: And they basically the art the the person who was you know, their hypothesis, right?

196
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:35,123
Scott: I guess that's the only thing I read that same thread.

197
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:36,227
Rym: so right they.

198
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:43,900
Scott: they posited that you know when Tesla started it was appealing to Environmentally conscious people because it was an electric car, right?

199
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:54,412
Scott: It was like, you know, you know, but now it can't get repeat customers and that's why you see Ellen Musk Right rubbing elbows with more right-wing type people.

200
00:14:54,432 --> 00:15:01,200
Scott: They got that ridiculous Tesla truck nonsense Right because now they're they can't get repeat customers on the left.

201
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:03,527
Scott: So they're going for a new audience of people.

202
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:08,806
Scott: they can get to be first-time customers and then once that's exhausted I guess they'll be done.

203
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:10,800
Rym: because no, they'll turn it over the Facebook.

204
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:16,437
Scott: Yeah, they'll have to find new customers somewhere or eventually make a car good enough that it would.

205
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:20,940
Rym: you know Grant a repeat by yeah, but it's similar.

206
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:34,200
Rym: There was a thing actually I want to say for a future Monday But there is some significant speculation that a material risk to Amazon Is that they churn through warehouse workers in America so fast that they run out of people.

207
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,499
Rym: They will run out of people who are willing to take that job in the first place.

208
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:44,983
Rym: Yep, because all the people who would take a job like that have already worked there and either been fired or quit and discussed Or died.

209
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:49,097
Scott: Yeah, the person who made Trader Joe's the grocery store wrote a book recently.

210
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:57,860
Scott: I didn't read the book It's on my wish list But they there was some reviews of it and basically the gist I got from the reviews was that that dude?

211
00:15:58,141 --> 00:16:00,680
Scott: Isn't actually like nice or awesome or anything?

212
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,039
Scott: He's just another greedy rich capitalist guy like everyone else trying to run a business and make a lot of money.

213
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:11,910
Scott: But he recognized that look a better worker retention not having to hire people actually saves a fuck ton of money.

214
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:21,491
Scott: therefore Trader Joe's treats its employees very well Right and pays them well and tries to keep them and it actually works.

215
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:24,500
Scott: The guy was correct and he's not doing it altruistically.

216
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,360
Scott: Yeah, he's just trying to make more money.

217
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:35,789
Scott: It works and that's sort of why you know, you go to Trader Joe's and like the employees are sort of like always You know trying to talk to you nice and whatever.

218
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:41,580
Scott: It's part of it is that they're trained to do that And in a creepy customer service way.

219
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:46,499
Scott: But part of it is actually honestly that they like working there because they're treated well.

220
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:47,732
Rym: Yeah, and we see

221
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:48,440
Scott: this on warehouse

222
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:59,940
Rym: We see this throughout all of history any restaurant that does the thing, you know bit by bit during kovat a bunch of restaurants We're like trying to deal with the lack of staffing and they pay a lot more and prices don't go up that much.

223
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,568
Rym: But yet service is better.

224
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:02,594
Rym: The restaurant one is better.

225
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:03,579
Rym: Everyone's better off.

226
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:08,516
Rym: Mechanism design says you make the rules of the game cause the outcomes you want.

227
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:19,877
Rym: even if you can't trust the players You gotta have rules that make sure that even the greediest most unethical motherfucker running a company It is in that person's best interest to treat their workers.

228
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,215
Scott: Well Yeah, the thing is it is in their best interest their work as well and they still don't.

229
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:25,000
Scott: it's a lot.

230
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,820
Rym: Anyway, so what a Tesla do now, so there's a bunch of articles about this.

231
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,418
Rym: I'll link to the Jalopnik article because it has the most insightful commentary site.

232
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:43,990
Rym: So yeah good So someone discovered that newer Tesla's they have a really fancy seat that yeah I can move in a bunch of directions like basically any.

233
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:46,018
Scott: most cars almost every car has that.

234
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:46,400
Scott: now it is.

235
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,153
Rym: I mean Tesla's are known for having features that Tesla owners make a big deal about.

236
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:52,020
Rym: that have literally existed in cars forever.

237
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:54,366
Scott: So nothing I don't remember.

238
00:17:54,407 --> 00:18:04,153
Scott: the last time I was in a car where at least the driver's seat had didn't have motors 2012 Chevy Cruz eco that we have.

239
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:04,975
Rym: that was a gift.

240
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:05,717
Rym: has that?

241
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:09,468
Scott: so So my Mazda have that I don't remember.

242
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:13,660
Rym: maybe uh, I forget my laser didn't but my laser didn't enough power windows.

243
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:14,711
Rym: So that was in the 90s.

244
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:32,694
Rym: but anyway, anyway, so Tesla has this really fancy seat and If you move the seat around too much like too frequently It'll start popping up warnings yelling at you to stop moving the seat around so much and if you keep doing it It'll actually lock you out.

245
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:35,665
Rym: quote Excessive use of seat track motor.

246
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:38,673
Rym: detected seat track motor unavailable due to excessive use.

247
00:18:38,973 --> 00:18:41,640
Rym: wait five minutes and try to adjust your seat again.

248
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:46,638
Scott: Well, I mean that could make you know, it's like if they're trying to do it because they want to.

249
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,318
Scott: you know Reduce wear on the motor.

250
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:53,260
Scott: That's a problem because other cars have similar motors and don't need to do that.

251
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:56,390
Rym: That's the very lead the fundamental problem here.

252
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:59,220
Rym: Is that that kind of solution?

253
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,878
Rym: Belies any idea of a reasonable problem that it is solving.

254
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:10,564
Scott: Yep So the second question is well is it because it's an electric car and that uses power and they don't want you to drain The battery?

255
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:12,875
Scott: because that's different than draining the battery?

256
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:18,395
Rym: and you know your normal car I'll have an all normal car were idling it for like a half hour mostly charges the battery right.

257
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:19,719
Scott: so that could be true.

258
00:19:20,563 --> 00:19:24,259
Scott: But that the point someone brought up a really good point in our forum that you should join.

259
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:25,906
Scott: What's that our discord?

260
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:29,000
Scott: I think was the forum might have been one of the places we talked to the listener.

261
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:31,932
Scott: Yeah, it really opened my eyes this comment.

262
00:19:31,952 --> 00:19:32,796
Scott: It was so insightful.

263
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:46,540
Scott: They were like listen you know if you really were making an electric car to try to be eco-friendly right as your goal and Then wouldn't you remove like things like power seats that are draining the battery?

264
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:51,256
Scott: It's like a roll-up window is a lot more equal friendly than a power window.

265
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:55,033
Scott: and I was like Yeah, I mean there's other downsides to up to a roll-up window.

266
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:56,480
Scott: obviously for yeah power window.

267
00:19:56,601 --> 00:20:05,700
Scott: But if you terms of eco-friendliness, it's like yeah You want a car where you manually move the seat around where you manually roll up the windows, right?

268
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,820
Scott: Where as few things use the battery as possible, right?

269
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,052
Scott: You basically you know have like a. you know Even try to make your radio as efficient as you can.

270
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:18,595
Scott: if you really want to be eco-friendly You wouldn't have power steering, but that's a bit too far.

271
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:24,864
Rym: Yeah Also that might arguably be a loss Environmentally based on the.

272
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:36,714
Scott: it could be the externalities of non power hiring the yes But the point is is that you know other things that are putting a drain on the battery power, you know You would want not no power sunroof, right?

273
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:37,720
Scott: No, right.

274
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:43,271
Scott: So Tesla while it is an electric car You know forgetting the fact that the car is a piece of shit.

275
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:48,732
Scott: if it was really trying to be eco-friendly It wouldn't be having you know, no heated seats, right?

276
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:50,540
Scott: You wouldn't be having that shit in there, right?

277
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,700
Scott: Oh Eric, you know, I guess some people argue by air conditioning.

278
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,866
Scott: I guess it depends where you live if you're.

279
00:20:55,926 --> 00:21:10,717
Rym: in most places air conditioning is probably a net benefit to the environment assuming the car is gonna drive anyway due to the danger of the heat in cars the fact that windows tend to just absolutely wreck the efficiency exact.

280
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,400
Scott: There's a lot of minor points to discuss about all the different electric features.

281
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,191
Scott: Yeah But the general point is still really insightful.

282
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:22,539
Scott: that look if you were really trying to be eco-friendly Then you would examine every feature on the car.

283
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:31,612
Scott: You would try to reduce weight and try to reduce power usage in all aspects of the car not simply Taken or a luxury car and just swap in the different hours.

284
00:21:31,652 --> 00:21:32,936
Rym: So that's actually a big.

285
00:21:32,976 --> 00:21:34,020
Scott: you're now green and green.

286
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:38,040
Rym: That's a big more common argument against electric cars recently.

287
00:21:38,301 --> 00:21:46,226
Rym: Is that while there's the the tire problem, which is his own problem like we know about that problem There is a secondary problem of.

288
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:58,580
Rym: there's so much heavier in general that now the meme is you're gonna drive So many tons like a tons worth of battery around powered by that battery just to get like four pounds of groceries.

289
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:00,786
Scott: I mean, that's the fundamental thing.

290
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:07,856
Scott: Is that the only thing that's gonna make a significant impact on the climate is A lot less cars, right?

291
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:17,310
Rym: Yeah What car it is And a lot more lithium-ion batteries to drive those e-bikes.

292
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:20,560
Rym: e-bikes especially the larger ones that are more accessible.

293
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:26,440
Rym: They're like they're possibly the most environmental possible way to get around for a normal bicycle.

294
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:32,240
Scott: The regular human-powered bicycle is still the most efficient transportation mechanism we've ever invented?

295
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:36,620
Scott: Yeah, so one short short of short of a barrel in a river a barrel?

296
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:37,943
Scott: I I can't.

297
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:39,650
Scott: I always said it was the bicycle.

298
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,947
Scott: But actually the barrel in the river is more Energy efficient than the bicycle.

299
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:48,380
Rym: I mean the most energy efficient is I already live on top of a cliff.

300
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:49,593
Rym: I only have to go down once.

301
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,030
Scott: You could never go home never go home.

302
00:22:53,392 --> 00:22:54,999
Rym: You can only go downhill the rest of your life.

303
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:57,308
Rym: Oh, that could be a fun indie game.

304
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:59,919
Rym: I just a game but you can only go down you can never gain.

305
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:03,819
Scott: Well, I guess the Oregon Trail you can only go west.

306
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:07,469
Rym: yeah Oregon Trail should have had a fucking we're heading back option.

307
00:23:08,273 --> 00:23:09,999
Scott: It had the dollies you go down the river.

308
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:15,860
Rym: and So yeah, the little more investigation into this and we'll move on because you can read this article.

309
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:25,253
Rym: But it talks about how some people are saying well, they switched seat vendors something something But people pointed out that the new supplier bros, so I never heard of I don't.

310
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:33,039
Rym: I don't know much about interior car like Manufacturing Nothing, and so they make the seats for like every goddamn car.

311
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:39,064
Rym: But yet it appears only Tesla's have these features around seat abuse metrics Mm-hmm.

312
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:43,265
Rym: So it's an interesting Problem among many.

313
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:46,859
Rym: my advice to you is do not under any circumstances buy a Tesla car.

314
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:48,806
Scott: No bad idea.

315
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:49,870
Scott: So try to buy.

316
00:23:50,050 --> 00:24:01,647
Scott: try to you know, buy less cars and drive less in general Yeah, and if your circumstances in life have you stuck in a car centric place and you have no desire or will or ability to Leave yeah, like I have a car now.

317
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:02,390
Rym: It was a gift.

318
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:08,579
Rym: I'm not gonna like replace it with a better car I'm just gonna keep it as well maintained as I can and get the most use out of it possible.

319
00:24:10,802 --> 00:24:29,500
Rym: So, uh, probably never own a car again, yeah in Some other huge news that honestly might over time become a game-changer Facebook stock collapsed like Mm-hmm a huge amount like a big deal amount and there's a bunch of news in a cluster around it.

320
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:33,496
Rym: But the key is that the reason for this seems to be twofold.

321
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:49,563
Rym: on one hand Everybody seems to know that the metaverse is kind of a scam but also The real reason is that Facebook for probably the first time is seeing a decrease in accounts and a decrease in usage That they can't.

322
00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:51,790
Scott: people people have seen this.

323
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:53,676
Scott: there are people who called this right.

324
00:24:53,756 --> 00:24:54,900
Scott: I got it whoever they are.

325
00:24:55,241 --> 00:25:08,209
Scott: I definitely remember reading articles, you know years ago Yeah that hat that made this call and they were exactly right and they talked about, you know other platforms You know coming for Facebook eating their lunch, right?

326
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:12,580
Scott: Look tick-tock is totally destroying right Instagram, right?

327
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:13,347
Scott: It's like they're not.

328
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,498
Scott: Facebook is not winning.

329
00:25:15,502 --> 00:25:18,029
Scott: Young people are not getting Facebook as just this.

330
00:25:18,189 --> 00:25:21,859
Scott: old people are using it and their numbers are shrinking and they're getting older new.

331
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,488
Scott: They're not getting new people onto the platform.

332
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:27,620
Rym: It's just like my cable television went right.

333
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:35,700
Rym: It's like if there's a money printing machine But that money printing machine is running out of the only resource that it can use to print that money.

334
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:46,849
Scott: Yep Now I thought Facebook, you know more recently very recently was making a play Where they're paying a lot of money to hire like all the software engineers in the world And they're that.

335
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,420
Scott: therefore it didn't matter.

336
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:56,110
Scott: You know what business they did because you know if we have all the software engineers working for us We're the only ones who can make anything

337
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:03,746
Rym: and I personally know a Terrifying number of people who I have lost from my own company or from other companies I've worked with.

338
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:10,399
Rym: like half the engineers I know outside of like our friend group have gone to Facebook over the last couple years for these.

339
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:18,740
Scott: for these I think just today I think they announced like the base pay Like maximum at Amazon was going up to like 350 K and such.

340
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,567
Scott: So the competition is coming through.

341
00:26:21,069 --> 00:26:22,575
Scott: sort of put a stop to that.

342
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:42,993
Scott: and now the the real Thing that people have been talking about for I guess a year or two that is sort of come to pass is both Apple's increased privacy rules in the App Store iPhones iOS specifically and And GDPR and Europe are basically directly hammering Facebook's bottom line.

343
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:58,079
Scott: if they can't collect as much data on users Because the privacy controls imposed upon them by governments or you know other Companies yeah that they make less money because their money is having that data and selling that data.

344
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:04,076
Scott: And I don't think yes, it finally is actually hurting them right.

345
00:27:04,116 --> 00:27:06,665
Scott: they saw it coming and now here It is the ball dropped.

346
00:27:06,806 --> 00:27:08,512
Scott: Facebook is is not doing well.

347
00:27:08,653 --> 00:27:12,287
Scott: I guess in some number of years It will be a myspace as predicted.

348
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:17,316
Rym: yep, and it's always a matter of when like cable TV Is in the exact same boat.

349
00:27:17,356 --> 00:27:17,640
Rym: right now?

350
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:25,283
Rym: It still makes so much money that it's hard to convince a company that makes money in that space to pivot and the way Capitalism is.

351
00:27:25,363 --> 00:27:27,030
Rym: it's hard to even say what they could pivot to.

352
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,400
Rym: that would make as much money as the old thing.

353
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:40,910
Rym: so there's this like deep dark pattern of Incentivization to keep milking that blood out of that stone until the last possible second and then who cares What happens?

354
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:41,359
Rym: just bail?

355
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,786
Rym: So this might.

356
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:46,394
Rym: this is honestly the beginning of the end.

357
00:27:46,856 --> 00:27:49,770
Rym: I suspect Facebook like my gut feeling.

358
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,875
Rym: I have no inside knowledge.

359
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:53,728
Rym: I'm not a Registered investment advisor.

360
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:55,415
Rym: This is not investment advice.

361
00:27:55,696 --> 00:27:56,600
Rym: I know I say that a lot.

362
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:15,455
Rym: I really have to say that or I can get a deep shit, but in my personal opinion Facebook as a company had planned to pivot to something like meta for a long time like they knew Something that would attract young people, but also let them.

363
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:16,620
Scott: they tried Facebook gaming.

364
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,020
Scott: They know Facebook marketplace, but also wouldn't let them be good thing to buy on those young people.

365
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,388
Rym: they needed to attract young people.

366
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:31,247
Scott: let them spy on those young people and Monetize those young people and there's no other way to make money on young, you know, not just Facebook meta Whatever, but any company.

367
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:37,480
Scott: you want to make money on young people, right young people Don't have a lot of fucking money unless their parents are rich or some shit, you know.

368
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:43,029
Scott: so the only way to make money off young people is To steal their data.

369
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:44,479
Rym: I'll back up a little further.

370
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:45,705
Rym: I'm gonna go even worse.

371
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:48,296
Scott: if you try to sell young people a subscription they can't.

372
00:28:48,316 --> 00:28:50,499
Scott: if they don't pay for it They'll pirate it or something.

373
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,511
Rym: But even further like how do they make all their money now?

374
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:57,179
Rym: because of the ads that they can sell to older people based on all that data.

375
00:28:58,241 --> 00:29:04,156
Rym: But a lot of that ecosystem was bolstered by the number of daily users of Facebook, which is dropping.

376
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:20,450
Rym: so I suspect Facebook expected one of these pivots to work and thought they had more time and I think Maybe kovid might have been a little bit of a factor here in that Facebook's user base dropped faster than they anticipated.

377
00:29:20,811 --> 00:29:23,480
Rym: they couldn't smooth it over and now they're completely fucked.

378
00:29:23,983 --> 00:29:32,370
Scott: All right, also even if the meta, you know hype, you know Cyberspace whatever plan works it's so many years out before that would land and

379
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:40,900
Rym: you got this impression part of the reason why they were hiring so hard for Their metaverse shit and part of why like blockchain and NFTs and all these other things are there.

380
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,784
Rym: There's two things going on.

381
00:29:41,844 --> 00:29:42,427
Rym: on one hand.

382
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,954
Rym: I think that was Facebook.

383
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:51,640
Rym: someone inside Definitely knew this was coming and they were aggressively trying to accelerate their metaverse plans.

384
00:29:51,983 --> 00:30:01,000
Rym: Probably before they were ready They started having to shit talk way in advance of delivering something which is one of the primary ways to guarantee you will fail.

385
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,299
Rym: That's why Scott and I were so careful to not shit talk like we used to in older game nights.

386
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:09,880
Scott: But they you if you have investors you have to shit talk to get them to give you money.

387
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,088
Rym: Yeah up to a point depends on which investors.

388
00:30:12,128 --> 00:30:15,761
Rym: but - there's a broader problem and this is where I'm gonna step back and actually Lean.

389
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:16,583
Rym: not I. this isn't.

390
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:23,231
Rym: this is my personal opinion and it is also my professional opinion as a product manager But not a professional opinion.

391
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:31,980
Rym: reflecting any particular company I work for or have ever worked for except GeekNights where this literally represents at least 50% of GeekNights is official opinion.

392
00:30:32,422 --> 00:30:33,907
Rym: Fuck you, we could say whatever we want.

393
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:34,469
Rym: We're GeekNights.

394
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:44,477
Rym: But as a product manager My job that for many years across many companies has been to decide what could make money.

395
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:45,520
Rym: How do you make money?

396
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:46,584
Rym: What do you sell?

397
00:30:46,785 --> 00:30:47,889
Rym: What is the strategy?

398
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:49,816
Rym: Like that's what my actual job is.

399
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:50,880
Rym: What do you make?

400
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:52,124
Rym: How do you make it?

401
00:30:52,365 --> 00:30:53,047
Rym: Will it make money?

402
00:30:53,087 --> 00:30:53,729
Rym: How do you make money?

403
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:57,140
Rym: I'm increasingly convinced that nothing can make money.

404
00:30:57,461 --> 00:31:10,409
Rym: I think the capitalist environment in America is toxic to the point that nothing could possibly make enough money to get enough investment to get off the ground and I don't know what to do about that.

405
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:15,343
Scott: Make an actual product that's You know.

406
00:31:15,644 --> 00:31:19,337
Rym: good products don't make enough money for investors products that are disposal.

407
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,539
Scott: No not for investors No, but you've enough for profits that you could live on.

408
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:26,298
Rym: Ah, but how do you get the mud the capital to make the product in the first place?

409
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,721
Scott: Savings.

410
00:31:28,424 --> 00:31:30,812
Rym: Yeah, that's the poor money is a problem.

411
00:31:31,353 --> 00:31:31,695
Scott: Yeah.

412
00:31:32,136 --> 00:31:40,019
Rym: Anyway, so anyway If some person wants a bankroll as we could definitely make a profitable product It just won't be as profitable as Facebook was until a few days ago.

413
00:31:41,142 --> 00:32:04,800
Scott: Yeah, the last the last tidbit is that Was I said, oh that Facebook is like threatened to Go like leave Europe over GDPR, please Right, and I know in the past I have said things like, you know mostly related to Google search where I was like encouraging Google search to like, you know If I was like off I was CEO of Google.

414
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,619
Scott: I would tell China and other countries like do what I say or no more Google search in your country to sort of you know.

415
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:18,035
Scott: To get countries to be good right not to get them to do bad stuff Yeah, but Google was a little bit different back then - yeah.

416
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:30,700
Scott: But in this case like Facebook saying oh we might have to leave and stop operating in Europe if we can't you know Transfer our data to the US like it just won't work which is sort of technologically true.

417
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:34,240
Scott: You know, like if someone posts a photo on Instagram, what are you gonna do?

418
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:40,960
Scott: Let you not let us users see the photo, you know It's like you had to transfer the data from Europe to the US in order for that to happen.

419
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:45,700
Scott: So you can only follow people in your geography on Facebook right with these data transfer.

420
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,827
Rym: I mean look at what Twitter does.

421
00:32:47,068 --> 00:32:53,300
Rym: Twitter has a whole different moderation system Basically just for Germany because Germany has laws saying you can't let Nazis use your platform.

422
00:32:53,741 --> 00:33:07,400
Scott: Yeah, and not not to mention the sheer amount of like, you know, if you didn't, you know cash the foreign users content on local You know servers the amount of like CDN like traffic that would be going over the international wires would be possible, right?

423
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:07,881
Scott: They wouldn't be.

424
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,346
Scott: they really they're not lying.

425
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:13,579
Scott: They wouldn't be able to operate if these law these rules get enforced on them.

426
00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:21,580
Scott: However When Facebook says we might have to leave Europe my response is don't threaten me with a good time.

427
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:27,858
Rym: Yeah, cuz remember when it comes to situations like this like this is sort of a message to all you nerds out there.

428
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,529
Rym: Ideological purity is a mistake.

429
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:36,605
Rym: You've got to think about outcomes of actions and Regard like we buy.

430
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:40,800
Rym: if this exact same situation happened, but the nouns were shuffled around.

431
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,791
Rym: It was a different company over a different issue.

432
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,405
Rym: the right move might be Yeah, we should like.

433
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:48,200
Rym: we got a. Europe's gonna have to play ball Europe's gonna have to do the right thing.

434
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,791
Rym: But in this case Facebook is a toxic influence on society.

435
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:52,934
Rym: So fuck them.

436
00:33:52,974 --> 00:33:54,679
Rym: I hope Europe destroys them over this.

437
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:05,450
Rym: but anyway things Of the day, this is just a little thing, but I think literally a little thing.

438
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,138
Rym: But I think you should appreciate it.

439
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:17,114
Rym: There is a an individual who has saved Uncountable human lives and that is hard to say exactly how many lives Magawa saved.

440
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:36,607
Rym: but Magawa is a little rat and This little rat is part of an army of little rats who are very trainable to find landmines particularly in places like Cambodia so that humans can disable them to prevent people from being killed by Random landmines that people left in the ground.

441
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:41,860
Rym: the landmines kill so many people on a dotted like yearly basis to this day.

442
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:46,800
Rym: It is terrifying and it's barely talked about in countries like the United States.

443
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,139
Scott: I'm all you know, and it's not talked about often.

444
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,469
Scott: But you know every time landmines come up all the u.s.

445
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,853
Rym: Still has not signed that treaty.

446
00:34:53,935 --> 00:34:54,577
Rym: last I checked.

447
00:34:55,038 --> 00:34:55,620
Scott: That's true.

448
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,978
Rym: We are one of the only countries on earth that reserves the right to use landmines.

449
00:34:59,038 --> 00:35:00,704
Scott: still Yeah something.

450
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:19,600
Scott: but the thing that I think about a lot that I've never hear other people talk about is that there are places In the world two that come to mind for me are obviously between North and South Korea and the DMZ and also in Israel like in the Golan Heights the border between Israel and Lebanon and you know places like that in the world that are.

451
00:35:19,921 --> 00:35:26,844
Scott: They're not places like Cambodia where people are just living and there used to be landmines from a previous war So people step on them.

452
00:35:26,904 --> 00:35:40,210
Scott: They're places where landmines are actively being used for a current You know conflict right on purpose, but if at some point in the future There is a resolution to that conflict right?

453
00:35:40,451 --> 00:35:43,020
Scott: You're gonna need to get these mice out there, right?

454
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,743
Scott: Yeah, because the landmines are there.

455
00:35:44,764 --> 00:35:45,506
Scott: What are you gonna do?

456
00:35:45,526 --> 00:35:50,400
Scott: Yeah, and while there is South Korea suddenly Kumbaya tomorrow, right?

457
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,968
Scott: What the fuck you gonna do there?

458
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:53,840
Scott: You put all these landmines there you dumbasses.

459
00:35:54,262 --> 00:35:58,560
Rym: Yeah, remember landmines by design are hard to find.

460
00:35:59,445 --> 00:36:00,370
Scott: Yeah, that's sort of the point.

461
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:06,294
Scott: if they were easy to find and disable The soldiers would just do that and never step on them and they would be pointless.

462
00:36:06,575 --> 00:36:11,252
Rym: So yep as of today 164 countries have signed the Ottawa Treaty.

463
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:13,040
Scott: that how many countries are there?

464
00:36:14,764 --> 00:36:15,936
Rym: Yeah more than that.

465
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:19,706
Rym: Let's see It is not signed.

466
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:28,279
Rym: the notable countries where there are 32 countries who could have signed it who chose not to The United States Russia China are the three big ones who have not signed it.

467
00:36:29,362 --> 00:36:29,923
Scott: How about that?

468
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:33,254
Scott: Yeah, so I'd sign that shit day one.

469
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,220
Scott: I'd be like, I guess the Senate has to do something.

470
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:47,400
Rym: Yeah, actually presidents have Really pushed for this but the Senate blocks all treaties meeting right now Literally United States actually is incapable of signing treaties currently because of the way our Senate is.

471
00:36:48,023 --> 00:36:50,720
Scott: But we also can't unsign treaties.

472
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:53,505
Rym: We could just stop following them.

473
00:36:53,626 --> 00:36:54,749
Rym: What's someone gonna do?

474
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:59,947
Rym: That's a not that that's but we just can't unsign them though I actually we did read.

475
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:06,275
Rym: we did relatively recently under the former guy Unsigned the treaty that banned intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe.

476
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,727
Scott: Oh We could resign that.

477
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,559
Rym: Oh guess who needs to sign that?

478
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:15,220
Rym: Anyway Kirsten send him as a traitor overturned the filibuster.

479
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:30,659
Rym: So yeah, this little rat is a hero and in general, I think there is a very important future for humanity where We have animals that we take good care of and we train and collaborate with who basically do jobs for us.

480
00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:33,878
Rym: Imagine writing pulling fiber through tunnels.

481
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,903
Rym: Imagine crows like looking for lost electronics and bringing them to a central place Like.

482
00:37:39,983 --> 00:37:46,680
Scott: I think the people who are currently making police robots should make landmine Finding robots instead and not make landmine planting robots.

483
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:53,220
Rym: Yeah That you realize though the company that that what if I may if I was the company who is making the landmine placing robots?

484
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:59,040
Rym: You know, I have also made the landmine finding robot and it is way more expensive than the landmine placing robot.

485
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:06,142
Rym: Yeah, fuck that company Yep, so look at this little red little hero little hero, dude All right.

486
00:38:06,383 --> 00:38:08,652
Scott: So my thing of the day nerds love swords.

487
00:38:08,732 --> 00:38:10,720
Scott: There's plenty of sword nerds out there.

488
00:38:11,462 --> 00:38:14,049
Rym: Very grateful that I only own one sword.

489
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,940
Scott: there was a you know, and there's an exact for us non sword nerds.

490
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:20,079
Scott: But you were still a nerd so you still love a sword.

491
00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:21,547
Scott: Oh, yeah, come on fucking.

492
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:24,139
Rym: so show me the faux hammer and I am just all about that.

493
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,216
Scott: But there's a certain um, there's like a correct dosage of sword.

494
00:38:28,297 --> 00:38:29,060
Scott: You can't overdose.

495
00:38:29,961 --> 00:38:30,623
Scott: Here's your.

496
00:38:31,105 --> 00:38:34,616
Scott: here is your dose of sword for the year this sword guy.

497
00:38:34,636 --> 00:38:35,700
Scott: There's actually an old video.

498
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,249
Scott: I just didn't discover it till recently.

499
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:38,355
Scott: I didn't discover.

500
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,059
Rym: you linked me to it.

501
00:38:39,661 --> 00:38:44,540
Scott: Yeah, there's a hot topic in the sword community that I was unaware of so it's hot to me.

502
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,748
Scott: I guess it might have been hot to sword people long ago.

503
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:56,635
Scott: Is that when you watch movies and TV shows, especially Fantasy ones where swords are involved you often see people carrying swords strapped to their back.

504
00:38:56,715 --> 00:38:58,700
Scott: many anime are guilty of this for sure.

505
00:38:59,283 --> 00:39:01,460
Scott: Usually it's someone with a big-ass claymore, right?

506
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,253
Scott: Hey, you know, you've seen this a sword on your back, right.

507
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:10,917
Scott: and in fantasy You see people draw the sword from their back or put it back into right.

508
00:39:11,177 --> 00:39:11,960
Scott: that's on their back.

509
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:16,013
Scott: But if you have to do that in real life, it's unrealistic.

510
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:17,618
Scott: It's just not done.

511
00:39:17,698 --> 00:39:18,300
Scott: in history.

512
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:23,980
Scott: No one no historical people have worn swords on their back for battle, right?

513
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:31,711
Scott: Just there, you know in any country right where swords were used Swords were not put in a sheath on the back.

514
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:37,628
Scott: It was on the hip or on the horse or It's gonna point out some very specific exception.

515
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:38,210
Rym: We don't know about.

516
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,531
Rym: we're not in.

517
00:39:38,892 --> 00:39:42,203
Scott: the sword guy in this video said it wasn't done Historically, so I'm going.

518
00:39:42,223 --> 00:39:43,447
Scott: this is sword guy knowledge.

519
00:39:43,788 --> 00:39:44,470
Scott: It's like I know.

520
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:51,307
Rym: I know that I am simply in beforring things like Non-accessible transport like you're carrying.

521
00:39:51,327 --> 00:39:52,771
Scott: this is something that I knew.

522
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:55,680
Scott: this is something I just learned from my one dose of sword.

523
00:39:56,001 --> 00:39:59,376
Rym: I've seen this short sword guy before so I do trust him a significant amount.

524
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:02,845
Scott: I've seen that anyway In this video.

525
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:06,640
Scott: this sword guy you can fast-forward through most of the video just get to the good part.

526
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:19,986
Scott: But the point is he made a you know, just to prove that it was a thing He constructed out of wood a back sword, you know, she slash scabbard Whatever the difference is.

527
00:40:20,007 --> 00:40:20,570
Scott: I don't know.

528
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,495
Scott: I'm not a sword guy.

529
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:30,232
Scott: Yeah, right That has like a slit on the side so that it's somewhat You know, I guess practical.

530
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:31,579
Rym: it's way good.

531
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:34,370
Scott: It's kind of funny to watch the times.

532
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:36,380
Scott: He tries to put the sword back in there and fails.

533
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:53,000
Scott: Yeah The main advantage I see in sword on the back is Simply that just you can carry more weight on your back and if a big heavy sword is more comfortable, right?

534
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,668
Rym: Well, I don't think you were necessarily like.

535
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,940
Rym: it comes down to what are you using this sword for?

536
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,562
Rym: There was the only.

537
00:40:57,603 --> 00:41:01,679
Scott: if you're what I'm assuming you're walking a long distance with the sword and you don't have a horse.

538
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,844
Rym: But in that case why?

539
00:41:02,904 --> 00:41:07,380
Rym: it's probably like in the pack or like there's other ways to transport that kind of thing.

540
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,636
Rym: Not if it's a big-ass fucking, you know, I mean like there's mule there's pack mules.

541
00:41:12,756 --> 00:41:15,027
Rym: There's there's camp followers There's all sorts of nonsense.

542
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:27,499
Rym: I guess what I'm getting at is The era where people wore swords around Was pretty shorts and mostly just dipshits during very brief parts of history in particular cities.

543
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,660
Scott: Hey, I guess in Japan they carried swords around but those were lighter smaller swords, and they never carried them on the back.

544
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:46,040
Rym: Yeah I'm thinking mostly of European dipshits dueling with each other during like certain parts of the Renaissance not Like a little foil like a little light sword, so who needs to carry that on your back, right?

545
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:54,880
Rym: Well, a lot of them would have basically stilettos because a lot of those sword duels came down to Stab the other guy first real quick and then he's done and you win and walk away like that's it.

546
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,603
Rym: It was one stroke.

547
00:41:55,703 --> 00:41:58,995
Scott: It wasn't a big heavy claymore that needs to be carried on the back cuz it's so heavy.

548
00:41:59,015 --> 00:42:04,264
Rym: Yeah we've got a Another Scott in the.

549
00:42:04,445 --> 00:42:07,375
Rym: I got reading about scabbards and telling us why we're wrong.

550
00:42:07,415 --> 00:42:08,680
Rym: There's some Celts did it anyway.

551
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,573
Scott: Okay, met a moment.

552
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:11,822
Scott: Let's go Alright.

553
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:16,194
Rym: the GeekNights book club book is not in fact the tale of Genji.

554
00:42:16,214 --> 00:42:18,360
Rym: I'm gonna update the website with the new.

555
00:42:20,342 --> 00:42:25,120
Rym: I actually I'm waiting on that because we have done one episode on the tale of Genji.

556
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:32,412
Rym: We were going to do at least one more episode on the tale of Genji next Thursday Because I spent two years reading a book having a lot to say about it.

557
00:42:33,034 --> 00:42:33,255
Scott: Yep.

558
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,050
Rym: So the next episode We already did one episode.

559
00:42:36,131 --> 00:42:36,433
Rym: It's up.

560
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,805
Rym: You can listen to it If you read the tale of Genji.

561
00:42:39,246 --> 00:42:43,060
Rym: that episode we just talked about like what we thought of Genji the story itself.

562
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:53,436
Rym: the next one we're gonna talk about a bunch of meta and how the book changed and like the Structure of a novel and like modern readers and all that kind of nonsense history

563
00:42:53,516 --> 00:42:54,460
Scott: and stuff, you know

564
00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:02,340
Rym: Yep, our very facile and limited understanding of hey and era culture much of which I learned from reading the tale of Genji.

565
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:09,076
Scott: Yep, so the next book club book after the tale of Genji NK jemisins the city we became.

566
00:43:09,096 --> 00:43:11,022
Scott: yeah, I Went.

567
00:43:11,303 --> 00:43:14,180
Scott: immediately after we recorded the first Genji episode.

568
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,500
Scott: I went to bed and I continued reading that book and finished reading that book.

569
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,320
Scott: So before we've even done the second episode on Genji, I finished reading the next book club book.

570
00:43:24,441 --> 00:43:25,620
Rym: But I was not hungry.

571
00:43:26,263 --> 00:43:30,440
Scott: We got to give the listener and we got to give Rym some time to read that book.

572
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:32,469
Rym: This book will not take me long to read.

573
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,619
Scott: I looked at how many didn't take me long to read at all.

574
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:37,848
Scott: This book has a moment in it.

575
00:43:38,511 --> 00:43:41,200
Scott: That is a big payoff.

576
00:43:41,581 --> 00:44:03,966
Scott: that was very satisfying and I know I was previously hesitant about reading this book because it is the first in a series and I don't like to do that, but I can tell you that even if somehow the great crime happens and you know, the world falls into to ruin and The no other book in this series is ever published that that's okay You're.

577
00:44:04,147 --> 00:44:06,420
Scott: it's not a it's not a cliffhanger deal.

578
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:08,960
Rym: It's not an R Scott backer situation of wealth.

579
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:14,038
Rym: We have triggered the literal end of everything you were waiting for and I just stopped writing books.

580
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:21,078
Scott: Apparently No, it's a. it's basically the ending, you know, you know spoiler, I guess I don't know.

581
00:44:21,098 --> 00:44:29,660
Scott: not really is that you know, there's a lot of times where you'll have like Think about it like this if you watch an episode of GI Joe, right?

582
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,354
Scott: Well, it's like at the end of an episode of GI Joe they beat Cobra, right?

583
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:36,360
Scott: The the bad guy is defeated.

584
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,030
Rym: Yeah, they don't finish Cobra off.

585
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:38,654
Rym: They just boil.

586
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:39,500
Rym: whatever cover was up.

587
00:44:40,343 --> 00:44:41,849
Scott: The right exactly be.

588
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:49,780
Scott: the current conflict is resolved But the greater conflict is just still out there and that is how this book goes.

589
00:44:50,201 --> 00:45:03,416
Scott: Being the first in a series is that this book completely resolves itself as much as the episode of any TV show Would resolve itself, but the greater larger setting still has a greater unresolved conflict.

590
00:45:03,497 --> 00:45:06,989
Scott: that allows for further books But does not put you in suspense.

591
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:09,740
Scott: So you don't need to wait for book two to be published.

592
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:11,004
Scott: I was wrong.

593
00:45:11,385 --> 00:45:14,234
Scott: You can just read book one right now and you should.

594
00:45:14,414 --> 00:45:18,379
Rym: the listener just said and I quote This is a very GeekNights book.

595
00:45:19,765 --> 00:45:21,100
Scott: It is a extremely geek.

596
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,583
Scott: It is like Nothing book.

597
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:28,793
Scott: It was as good as I expected it to be perhaps even better.

598
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:31,160
Scott: I can't get over that payoff moment.

599
00:45:31,321 --> 00:45:32,064
Scott: It was like me.

600
00:45:32,084 --> 00:45:32,988
Rym: I'll tease you with.

601
00:45:33,128 --> 00:45:38,388
Rym: the genre that it is listed under is Urban fantasy and I'll just leave it at that.

602
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:38,990
Scott: the.

603
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,178
Scott: the payoff might even be better than what.

604
00:45:41,198 --> 00:45:41,679
Scott: do you see?

605
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,440
Scott: It's like it's such a pale.

606
00:45:45,769 --> 00:45:48,565
Scott: so Yeah, that's all I got to say.

607
00:45:48,765 --> 00:45:52,437
Rym: so yeah, let's get right into it with otherwise no cons coming up.

608
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:58,295
Rym: if We and/or Scott are at PAX East very likely.

609
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:01,406
Rym: It'll be for just one day Maybe just to do a panel and hang out for a day.

610
00:46:01,848 --> 00:46:02,650
Rym: It's unlikely.

611
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:07,709
Rym: I will be at PAX East for the entirety of a PAX East Just considering everything.

612
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:09,399
Rym: but stay tuned on that.

613
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:13,320
Rym: It's very likely there'll be at least one GeekNights panel there, but it might be like PAX Unplugged.

614
00:46:13,421 --> 00:46:14,386
Rym: We're just being by myself.

615
00:46:14,808 --> 00:46:17,946
Rym: depends on how Scott's feeling and how everything is Shaping up.

616
00:46:18,368 --> 00:46:18,811
Rym: We can't really.

617
00:46:18,831 --> 00:46:20,460
Scott: maybe I'll decide to go with the last second.

618
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,264
Scott: We'll see what goes up.

619
00:46:21,525 --> 00:46:22,670
Rym: and same thing like unplugged.

620
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:22,991
Rym: like.

621
00:46:23,052 --> 00:46:27,308
Rym: it's pretty easy to go to a kind like that at the last Second unless we're all in and I can't.

622
00:46:27,328 --> 00:46:29,918
Scott: we don't if we don't go to PAX Unplugged 2022.

623
00:46:29,918 --> 00:46:30,520
Scott: That's real sad.

624
00:46:31,062 --> 00:46:33,811
Rym: Yeah, I I'm really hoping.

625
00:46:34,272 --> 00:46:39,001
Rym: by the time the next PAX Unplugged happens I'd like to go to a convention 2022.

626
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:49,669
Rym: I would like to go to conventions not have to wear a mask because it's safe not because we've given up exactly, so Otherwise, we're working on some panels and stuff.

627
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:50,834
Rym: Scott's working on the website.

628
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:52,440
Rym: Like keep following us on the Internet.

629
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,746
Scott: So I should do that shouldn't?

630
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:54,408
Rym: yep.

631
00:46:55,152 --> 00:46:56,056
Rym: I mean we got time.

632
00:46:56,578 --> 00:46:58,468
Rym: There's no Immediate rush.

633
00:46:58,569 --> 00:46:59,800
Rym: I got some other things I'm working on.

634
00:47:01,181 --> 00:47:02,788
Rym: I'm working on a. I did so.

635
00:47:02,808 --> 00:47:10,920
Rym: I was working on a panel not for a con just for me But I paused that because I'm working on something far more powerful.

636
00:47:12,021 --> 00:47:12,925
Rym: Scott knows about it.

637
00:47:13,226 --> 00:47:14,673
Rym: a good friend of ours knows about it.

638
00:47:14,733 --> 00:47:16,099
Rym: No one else knows what I'm working on.

639
00:47:16,802 --> 00:47:17,264
Rym: Good Lord.

640
00:47:17,284 --> 00:47:18,268
Rym: Do I have some things to say?

641
00:47:18,348 --> 00:47:20,818
Scott: I found okay, let's go on with it with the show here.

642
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:22,903
Rym: So Technological lock-in.

643
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:23,885
Rym: What are we talking about?

644
00:47:23,986 --> 00:47:29,120
Rym: Imagine say you made a podcast and you put that podcast up on a platform.

645
00:47:29,241 --> 00:47:37,100
Rym: Let's say Libsyn It happened to be one of many platforms that would host your podcast forever with all the backlog with reasonable prices.

646
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:44,509
Rym: so let's say you and your friend, let's call him just I don't know scored and Together you do this.

647
00:47:44,991 --> 00:47:48,644
Rym: All right fast forward 1020 years.

648
00:47:49,186 --> 00:47:53,200
Rym: all the other platforms years that offered this stuff don't exist anymore.

649
00:47:53,601 --> 00:48:01,954
Scott: The one you're using happens to still exist and actually if I was starting a podcast today They're actually a lot of really good platforms besides Libsyn, but it's true.

650
00:48:02,637 --> 00:48:03,279
Scott: We're locked in.

651
00:48:03,901 --> 00:48:11,100
Rym: I mean we we did start GeekNights like what before there were platforms that there weren't any choices back then.

652
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,447
Scott: Yeah, like not a lot of good ones.

653
00:48:13,507 --> 00:48:14,329
Rym: Anyway, yep.

654
00:48:14,751 --> 00:48:16,997
Rym: Also we have a terrifying backlog.

655
00:48:17,017 --> 00:48:17,960
Rym: That's all free on the internet.

656
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:18,682
Rym: It's all there.

657
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:36,320
Rym: So if Libsyn one day came to us and said hey, we're shutting down at the end of this year The amount of hassle and headache and pain that that would cause me and Scott personally me and score personally theoretically would be unimaginable.

658
00:48:37,402 --> 00:48:47,725
Scott: Right and it because of the you know, whenever something like this happens They're always gonna be these technological details so that you know We're you know, you're locked in.

659
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:57,574
Scott: right if there isn't a technological hang-up of some kind With regards to transitioning away from the platform then there is no lock-in.

660
00:48:57,674 --> 00:49:07,474
Scott: you could just move at any time right, so like if you just Have some sort of I don't know Google Docs equivalent platform right?

661
00:49:07,595 --> 00:49:09,480
Scott: Fogle Fogle Docs, right?

662
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:15,500
Scott: But they store all your documents in text format or you know some open format.

663
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:17,969
Scott: Well, there's no lock-in.

664
00:49:18,029 --> 00:49:21,160
Scott: if they shut down you have all your documents in this open format.

665
00:49:21,281 --> 00:49:24,656
Scott: You could just take them all to somewhere else and you're as good as when you started.

666
00:49:24,696 --> 00:49:26,082
Scott: you didn't lose, you know You're not stuck.

667
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:38,249
Scott: All right, there's always some technological hang-up that makes it painful difficult or impossible to move without Sacrificing something so like in the case of Libsyn.

668
00:49:38,691 --> 00:49:40,640
Scott: if you were to move off of Libsyn, right?

669
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,574
Scott: There would be a hassle re-upload all our mp3 somewhere else.

670
00:49:43,735 --> 00:49:44,659
Scott: We'll get around that.

671
00:49:44,961 --> 00:49:49,958
Rym: Well case though already that presents a problem because a lot of places have a rolling window of how much you can upload.

672
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:56,860
Rym: we would Get around it somehow, but it would require negotiation and possibly paying extra money, right?

673
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:05,547
Scott: But what would be impossible would be the fact that we have URLs pointing at mp3 files that are libsyn.com Something something dot mp3.

674
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:07,996
Scott: Yeah, and all those you are.

675
00:50:08,037 --> 00:50:16,900
Scott: if they shut down All those URLs are broken and we have no way to redirect them and you might think so Don't be like on that everything to another platform.

676
00:50:17,241 --> 00:50:23,640
Scott: We will suffer this permanent set of broken links around the entire internet that we are unable to repair.

677
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,976
Rym: Now you might say but don't you have a website just like redirect of the RSS feed?

678
00:50:28,056 --> 00:50:32,559
Rym: update that yes There are a lot of places that point at those URLs that we do have control over.

679
00:50:33,022 --> 00:50:36,337
Rym: But the beauty of the internet is anyone can link to anything.

680
00:50:36,759 --> 00:50:44,580
Rym: any Shmuck out there could be linking directly to this mp3s And I'm sure a lot of things are and that's what I love about the internet.

681
00:50:44,902 --> 00:50:46,008
Rym: But that also means there is.

682
00:50:46,089 --> 00:50:48,740
Rym: that is an irresolvable problem All right.

683
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:56,863
Scott: It also means that the company that runs that platform that is locking you in right has some hold on you Right.

684
00:50:57,065 --> 00:50:58,800
Scott: It's like libsyn raises prices.

685
00:50:59,742 --> 00:51:01,049
Scott: What the fuck are we gonna do about it?

686
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:02,799
Scott: Yeah pay that's what we're gonna do.

687
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:06,420
Scott: Yeah choice, even if we don't like it, obviously they raise the price too much.

688
00:51:06,821 --> 00:51:09,191
Scott: We would just suffer the consequences and break all the links.

689
00:51:09,492 --> 00:51:11,460
Scott: Yeah, but you know, there is a. there is a line.

690
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,409
Scott: We only have so much money, but if I raise the price about five bucks a month It's like we just got to pay it.

691
00:51:15,429 --> 00:51:20,818
Rym: We got no choice Right, so a company that was more like GeekNights is just me and Scott like.

692
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:21,360
Rym: there's no one.

693
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,664
Rym: We don't have any other employees.

694
00:51:23,106 --> 00:51:26,777
Rym: So it's not like if this were a company like I've done.

695
00:51:26,998 --> 00:51:41,349
Rym: risk assessment I used to be a chief risk officer for a time and basically Contingency plans for if anything we rely on has a problem of any kind are the kind of thing a company does as a matter Of course, like what are all the things we use?

696
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:44,240
Rym: what would happen to us if any one of them disappeared tomorrow?

697
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,606
Rym: Like could we resolve that?

698
00:51:45,988 --> 00:51:53,356
Rym: so if we don't think we control completely, yeah Like we do have some plans like we control our domain and there's a lot of damage mitigation we could do.

699
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:56,760
Rym: but also We live stream the episodes to YouTube.

700
00:51:57,341 --> 00:52:09,499
Rym: That means that the show is available on a different unrelated platform that even uses a different cloud provider from what Libsyn uses Mm-hmm, but also Patreon part of the reason we have the patreon.

701
00:52:10,501 --> 00:52:14,160
Rym: Sometimes we have some special stuff every now and then and I got some things in the hopper that are coming again.

702
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,346
Scott: I mean if I was in charge, we still wouldn't have the patreon.

703
00:52:16,386 --> 00:52:22,992
Rym: but patreon is free and Every GeekNights episode I upload to patreon free to anyone.

704
00:52:23,012 --> 00:52:25,260
Rym: You don't even need a patreon account to listen.

705
00:52:25,903 --> 00:52:42,549
Rym: So it's free hosting for every episode of GeekNights Which means there is there are two alternate URLs for every GeekNights episode that we make at this point Not the whole archive going all the way back in time That are completely independent of each other and independent of our primary provider.

706
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:45,154
Scott: That's yeah, like that's.

707
00:52:45,315 --> 00:52:49,150
Scott: one thing you can do for lock-in right is if you prepare in advance.

708
00:52:49,371 --> 00:52:56,930
Rym: Usually just having backups will help you with a lot of oh, yeah We also Scott has a backup of every mp3 you've ever uploaded.

709
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:02,210
Rym: I have a backup of not only every everything but also all the raw wave files and all the projects and everything.

710
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:04,760
Rym: So there's a lot of mitigation there.

711
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:10,550
Rym: We don't have to use this specific example any further But I thought a real example might help set the stage for what we're talking about.

712
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:13,319
Scott: Well, I guess let's go back to the olden the olden days right.

713
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:27,930
Scott: the oldest examples of computer lock-in Right were I guess if you go way back it was simply that you know people are writing programs in assembly languages and You would be stuck on a particular computer architecture.

714
00:53:28,592 --> 00:53:31,240
Scott: And so, you know, you couldn't moved over either.

715
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:34,669
Scott: stuck, you know wrote your program for your business on an alpha chip.

716
00:53:35,593 --> 00:53:36,316
Scott: Yeah, you couldn't.

717
00:53:36,396 --> 00:53:38,043
Scott: you couldn't switch over to Apple right.

718
00:53:38,063 --> 00:53:39,830
Scott: you'd have to rewrite all your software, right?

719
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:40,272
Scott: So that was like.

720
00:53:40,373 --> 00:53:41,398
Scott: that was the first lock-in.

721
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:42,122
Scott: Yeah, I think.

722
00:53:42,142 --> 00:53:43,670
Scott: yet OS lock-in, right?

723
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:47,284
Scott: It's like oh the program you need only runs on Windows, right?

724
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:52,049
Scott: It doesn't run on anything else Right, and then there was file format lock-in.

725
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:52,772
Scott: Yeah, like.

726
00:53:52,993 --> 00:53:56,830
Scott: ah, I see that you have, you know created a word document.

727
00:53:57,091 --> 00:54:01,369
Scott: I guess you're never using word perfect forever because your business is now Microsoft's business.

728
00:54:01,751 --> 00:54:02,513
Scott: What are you gonna do?

729
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:07,569
Scott: switch your business to word perfect instead lose every document you've ever had be unable to open them.

730
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:11,230
Rym: Right little things like a connector can be a form of lock-in.

731
00:54:11,592 --> 00:54:15,370
Rym: How many different connectors have were used to connect to phones and things in charge over the years?

732
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:19,320
Rym: One notable fruit-based company uses a different connector from everybody else.

733
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:20,243
Scott: Yep.

734
00:54:20,303 --> 00:54:21,988
Scott: I bet guess you're buying lightning cables.

735
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:26,429
Scott: No Yeah, right, you know you could buy them for someone else though, so it's not complete lock-in.

736
00:54:26,771 --> 00:54:38,929
Rym: But these are all different like shades and degrees of lock-in and the important thing to really think about is that lock-in occurs with technology Even if it is not intentional by the companies that are making things.

737
00:54:39,772 --> 00:54:44,870
Rym: Yep, it is a natural course of the more you use something the more you rely on that thing.

738
00:54:45,472 --> 00:54:52,559
Rym: I would actually struggle to quickly catalog from memory every thing every individual thing.

739
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:55,950
Rym: that would be a problem if we switch providers from Libsyn like.

740
00:54:56,553 --> 00:55:00,250
Rym: That would be an effort to even like fully catalog that and we probably still miss something.

741
00:55:00,812 --> 00:55:07,190
Rym: So yeah, every little thing you use has locked you into some small degree, but then there's the profit motive.

742
00:55:07,331 --> 00:55:15,643
Rym: There are some platforms some services Something as a service like platform as a service cloud providers.

743
00:55:16,064 --> 00:55:25,550
Rym: They have other forms of lock-in where There is an incentive for them to make sure that you build things that will only work on their platform on purpose.

744
00:55:26,331 --> 00:55:34,390
Scott: Yep, it's like, you know what I when Amazon Web Services first came about right the first service They had was ec2 which is literally just run servers.

745
00:55:34,652 --> 00:55:36,768
Scott: I guess before that they had Mechanical Turk and s3.

746
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:45,101
Scott: But you easy to was like when they first started for real there were some lesser-known services that I actually used in the early days Anyway, but there weren't that many there were.

747
00:55:45,282 --> 00:55:46,106
Scott: now there's like too many.

748
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:50,210
Scott: No one knows them all Yeah, and but ec2 is just run a Linux server.

749
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:51,194
Scott: So it wasn't really.

750
00:55:51,455 --> 00:55:52,238
Scott: you weren't locked in.

751
00:55:52,278 --> 00:55:54,768
Scott: if you use that right you can just switch over to.

752
00:55:55,049 --> 00:55:57,459
Scott: you know Any other hosting provider?

753
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,770
Rym: in fact that in that era?

754
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:00,451
Rym: You know what?

755
00:56:00,472 --> 00:56:05,450
Rym: I used Amazon ec2 for primarily to get out of the lock-in of the one expensive data center.

756
00:56:05,551 --> 00:56:06,858
Rym: I was paying for all the service.

757
00:56:07,421 --> 00:56:09,110
Rym: So we're gonna move all this to Amazon.

758
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:09,953
Rym: It's way cheaper.

759
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:14,090
Scott: Fuck you, right and s3 was a little bit of lock-in but not too much.

760
00:56:14,152 --> 00:56:14,829
Scott: It was just a store.

761
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:20,289
Scott: It's still just a storage bucket and nowadays people even offer other storage systems that use the same API.

762
00:56:20,571 --> 00:56:22,268
Scott: So that's not a lock-in either, right?

763
00:56:22,831 --> 00:56:33,648
Scott: But so when I was at first setting things up on Oz I was conscious of the lock-in potential from day one Because I noticed it wasn't exactly the same as other hosting services, right?

764
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:44,450
Scott: So when I was at work creating applications that ran on Amazon web services I would be like, alright, we're I'm gonna let us use RDS because that's literally just a database, right?

765
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:48,683
Scott: If we have to leave Amazon, we can run an equivalent of that service.

766
00:56:48,723 --> 00:56:49,827
Scott: No problem, right?

767
00:56:50,047 --> 00:56:52,616
Scott: this other service That's just a hosted memcached.

768
00:56:52,857 --> 00:56:54,644
Scott: We can just run that if we have to leave.

769
00:56:54,925 --> 00:56:56,190
Scott: Yeah, but then they had other things.

770
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:59,603
Scott: I remember they had SQ s. they still have it which is simple queue service.

771
00:56:59,964 --> 00:57:01,470
Scott: It's a. it's a pretty good queue system.

772
00:57:01,672 --> 00:57:02,239
Scott: It's just fine.

773
00:57:02,361 --> 00:57:02,948
Scott: It works great.

774
00:57:04,051 --> 00:57:18,569
Scott: But I was like look if we leave Amazon and we got our software written to use SQ s We're gonna have to rewrite all that part of the software to instead use a different queue like rabbit MQ or Some kind of.

775
00:57:19,132 --> 00:57:27,430
Rym: any of you who have ever worked in enterprise are immediately thinking about what happens when you try to migrate a Middleware bus in a company, right?

776
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:27,912
Scott: So it would.

777
00:57:28,013 --> 00:57:35,473
Scott: it wouldn't be you know a huge effort considering the size of the software but it would still be like a pain in the butt and You'd have to.

778
00:57:35,654 --> 00:57:38,990
Scott: you know, you would need a software engineer or you just be broken, right?

779
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,224
Scott: And it's like.

780
00:57:40,326 --> 00:57:49,270
Scott: well I think it's more important for us to not be stuck With Amazon and be able to go to any provider we want if we find lower prices better service, etc.

781
00:57:50,172 --> 00:57:55,357
Scott: Right better, you know, so but then you're trading off Right instead of using Amazon us.

782
00:57:55,578 --> 00:57:58,306
Scott: I used rabbit MQ and I was like there.

783
00:57:58,407 --> 00:58:08,117
Rym: now we can you know We're going to go but then depending on how you implement that kind of thing You often lose efficiency in that some of these Have like like.

784
00:58:08,137 --> 00:58:12,993
Rym: the way lambda works on Amazon is really cool and depending on your application You can.

785
00:58:13,374 --> 00:58:19,230
Rym: yeah lambda you can scale up like massively parallel simple computations infinitely pretty cheaply.

786
00:58:19,831 --> 00:58:23,727
Rym: But you're pretty much gonna build that around as long as each one takes less than 15 minutes.

787
00:58:24,029 --> 00:58:27,942
Rym: Yep I mean my use cases for that are things that takes less than a second.

788
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:35,209
Rym: So yeah, usually yeah Yeah, I feel if you have a life you think you're gonna have a quote long-running lambda on Amazon your you.

789
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:39,056
Scott: That's not what it's for.

790
00:58:39,237 --> 00:58:47,629
Rym: but then there's another kind of lock-in that is the Platform or walled garden that has lock-in on purpose certain kinds of app stores.

791
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:49,615
Rym: Certainly a show.

792
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:51,262
Scott: we did a show about walled gardens.

793
00:58:51,302 --> 00:58:54,532
Scott: talking about all these specifically Books.

794
00:58:54,894 --> 00:58:56,280
Scott: you bought books on Kindle.

795
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:58,650
Scott: I guess you're a Kindle person now, right?

796
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:02,244
Rym: I bought a bunch of Amazon apps garden Amazon apps about a bunch of Android apps.

797
00:59:02,284 --> 00:59:02,605
Rym: Guess what?

798
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:03,710
Rym: I don't have on my iPhone.

799
00:59:04,052 --> 00:59:06,729
Rym: Thankfully, I don't need or miss any of those old apps except one.

800
00:59:07,992 --> 00:59:12,508
Rym: I do miss one of them to the point that I might try to remake that app, basically good luck.

801
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:23,545
Rym: But that is a little more nefarious and interesting in one way because Those kinds of places and are being very generic here because this is thick.

802
00:59:23,585 --> 00:59:24,750
Rym: there's a lot of flavors of this.

803
00:59:25,392 --> 00:59:28,822
Rym: They make no they don't hide the fact that it's a blocked in platform.

804
00:59:28,842 --> 00:59:31,690
Rym: They're like yo, you want to be on a locked in platform?

805
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:32,532
Rym: Let's go.

806
00:59:33,034 --> 00:59:38,908
Scott: but like so, you know benefits of getting locked in right, you know As long as they don't shut it down or ruin it.

807
00:59:40,152 --> 00:59:43,430
Scott: You know, it's often like everything integrates well, right?

808
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:52,830
Scott: it's like when something's open it usually has to have lots of integrations and be flexible and whatnot and There and there's less money coming in from being locked in.

809
00:59:52,971 --> 01:00:01,869
Rym: So like here's an example There is almost no reason on earth for anyone who makes PC games to bother making a Mac port like an iOS port.

810
01:00:03,332 --> 01:00:17,110
Rym: Well iOS port you make a lot of money that depending on the kind of game Depends on the game sure compared to the audience Considering that the audience of PC gamers is for certain types of games primarily on gaming pcs at least for now.

811
01:00:18,871 --> 01:00:21,098
Scott: Like hey you bought a game on Steam, right?

812
01:00:21,259 --> 01:00:24,850
Scott: I guess you're a steam user now forever, right?

813
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,117
Scott: You're gonna buy more games.

814
01:00:26,137 --> 01:00:27,243
Scott: You're gonna buy them on Steam.

815
01:00:27,283 --> 01:00:33,909
Scott: if you buy a game on GOG You could download that game and just have it and you could uninstall GOG and never use them again.

816
01:00:34,735 --> 01:00:35,885
Scott: I know that they're not doing so.

817
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:38,314
Scott: well GOG is is not?

818
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:39,800
Scott: you know, it's not killing it there.

819
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,626
Scott: They're not you know, they're struggling.

820
01:00:41,706 --> 01:00:44,106
Rym: cuz like I said earlier It's hard to make money doing anything.

821
01:00:44,925 --> 01:00:45,069
Scott: Yep.

822
01:00:45,792 --> 01:00:48,980
Rym: So and this is all like we're not even casting a moral judgment.

823
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,509
Rym: lock-in is in some cases a plan to make money.

824
01:00:52,529 --> 01:00:56,681
Rym: in some cases the natural way a certain kind of ecosystem could work.

825
01:00:57,002 --> 01:01:06,530
Rym: in some cases just an affordance of the Physicality of a thing or in a for our just a an externality of the fact that you are using anything to do anything.

826
01:01:06,892 --> 01:01:09,145
Rym: So we're not casting like a moral judge capitalism.

827
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,013
Scott: Yeah, I Do it.

828
01:01:12,213 --> 01:01:13,398
Scott: they just they have gap.

829
01:01:13,478 --> 01:01:14,141
Scott: It's capitalism.

830
01:01:14,161 --> 01:01:14,603
Scott: They have to.

831
01:01:14,643 --> 01:01:15,205
Scott: they have no choice.

832
01:01:15,246 --> 01:01:16,350
Rym: Yeah, I have a steam account.

833
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:18,678
Rym: Most of the games I buy are on that steam account.

834
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:20,385
Rym: I also have a Nintendo account.

835
01:01:20,746 --> 01:01:21,850
Rym: bunch of games are on that.

836
01:01:22,172 --> 01:01:23,157
Rym: I have a GOG account.

837
01:01:23,197 --> 01:01:24,323
Rym: I bought a bunch of stuff from there.

838
01:01:24,343 --> 01:01:25,590
Rym: I have the epic game store.

839
01:01:25,671 --> 01:01:32,278
Rym: I have exactly one game installed So I don't have the last one.

840
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,029
Rym: yeah, you should four nights real fun.

841
01:01:34,853 --> 01:01:36,670
Scott: I mean I would if I didn't have to have another store.

842
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:40,230
Rym: I mean you could install it just to play it long enough to do a review and then you could just delete it.

843
01:01:40,552 --> 01:01:43,030
Rym: It doesn't do much other than play fortnight.

844
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:45,672
Scott: Don't trust it.

845
01:01:45,692 --> 01:01:47,438
Rym: Yeah, you don't trust it.

846
01:01:47,759 --> 01:01:49,204
Rym: I'm saying is I would like?

847
01:01:49,244 --> 01:01:49,745
Scott: I'll say it is.

848
01:01:49,766 --> 01:01:50,929
Scott: my computer only gets better.

849
01:01:53,191 --> 01:01:59,550
Rym: All I'm saying is I would love to see you play fortnight once after having experienced pub G again in recent memory.

850
01:02:00,331 --> 01:02:00,672
Scott: Let's go.

851
01:02:00,752 --> 01:02:03,542
Scott: Let's go play some fortnight at like PAX or something and we can use.

852
01:02:03,823 --> 01:02:04,927
Scott: you know, not on my computer.

853
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:06,314
Rym: Uh Okay.

854
01:02:06,596 --> 01:02:08,209
Rym: Anyway, I'll play some fortnight tonight.

855
01:02:10,372 --> 01:02:13,890
Scott: Maybe I guess I maybe I could do the switch one But I really don't want to play with the game.

856
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:19,189
Rym: Also if you play the switch one that fucks us up because they separate mouse and keyboard people from controller.

857
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:27,170
Rym: people Like if you put the game in first-person mode You can't play third-person and vice versa because otherwise people who play in third-person just lose.

858
01:02:29,053 --> 01:02:29,917
Rym: They know like they.

859
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:32,490
Rym: but the thing that's the one thing there's get mad about.

860
01:02:32,531 --> 01:02:34,392
Rym: Yeah talk about lock-in.

861
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:47,765
Rym: if you ever play a first-person shooter with a mouse and keyboard and You like get used to that and you could try to play a like Serious first-person shooter you've locked your own brain in in some senses.

862
01:02:47,785 --> 01:02:54,990
Scott: Mmm Yeah, you know a lot of the lock-ins we've talked about are sort of you know lock-ins that came.

863
01:02:55,231 --> 01:03:03,565
Scott: You know that you could explain them away as not purely You know, like, you know just greedy lock-in for no reason, right?

864
01:03:03,967 --> 01:03:07,130
Scott: It's like yeah We made this special queuing service.

865
01:03:07,253 --> 01:03:09,950
Scott: But look it, you know It integrates and it's all that you know.

866
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:10,090
Scott: like.

867
01:03:10,151 --> 01:03:20,630
Scott: we made this because it's easier for everyone to use to get them to use Amazon more as opposed to just using an Existing off-the-shelf one, you know that we couldn't make that integrate with our stuff on the back end.

868
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:28,470
Rym: But in most product management frameworks not even the reason stuff I've been trained on but so it's front of memory.

869
01:03:28,611 --> 01:03:38,230
Rym: But just like my entire life in this discipline as a career Stickiness is one of the core competencies that you are always told to treat as an asset.

870
01:03:39,191 --> 01:03:48,653
Rym: Nobody talks about any of the externalities of that other than that is one Attribute of many of a product and the more stickiness it has the better product It is.

871
01:03:48,673 --> 01:03:51,873
Rym: from a purely cynical capitalist perspective Yeah, but what?

872
01:03:52,134 --> 01:04:00,641
Scott: the real evil ones are the ones where the stickiness doesn't come as any Benefit other than the stickiness, right?

873
01:04:00,762 --> 01:04:03,090
Scott: So the best example are like the DRMs?

874
01:04:03,351 --> 01:04:07,286
Scott: Yeah, notably like the John Deere tractor repair DRM, right?

875
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:10,839
Scott: That's currently the government is actually doing okay job.

876
01:04:10,999 --> 01:04:15,889
Rym: all the stuff that makes made it hard for so long to get codes out Of cars and parse those codes.

877
01:04:16,971 --> 01:04:22,146
Scott: Yep, or you know, for example, you know PSD files are a good example, right?

878
01:04:22,186 --> 01:04:29,709
Scott: So it's like yeah, okay They made a proprietary file format that they can keep changing the specs on because they need Photoshop to.

879
01:04:29,929 --> 01:04:31,618
Scott: you know They want to add features to Photoshop.

880
01:04:31,638 --> 01:04:34,070
Scott: They need to add features to PSD files, right?

881
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:39,949
Scott: So if it was some, you know open format that anyone could modify then it's like well now.

882
01:04:40,331 --> 01:04:45,350
Scott: But what they could do is they could still publish a spec for PSD files, right?

883
01:04:45,812 --> 01:04:48,645
Scott: You know and allow other people to at least read and write them.

884
01:04:48,665 --> 01:04:54,447
Scott: and you know even if it wasn't an open spec that other people could contribute to they could still.

885
01:04:54,467 --> 01:05:04,688
Scott: you know, Let other people read and write PSD files and does not lock you into Photoshop so hard But they don't because they want to lock you into Photoshop so hard.

886
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:09,202
Scott: Once you've made a PSD file, you need Photoshop to read that file.

887
01:05:09,442 --> 01:05:12,070
Scott: You have to keep paying the subscription forever, right?

888
01:05:12,411 --> 01:05:16,524
Scott: Or you'll never see what's in that file ever again, unless someone of Photoshop opens it for you.

889
01:05:16,765 --> 01:05:28,095
Rym: the enterprise governments and b2b type sectors are where lock-in as a strategy is like common and Super on purpose.

890
01:05:28,336 --> 01:05:31,766
Rym: like that is a place you will see that more than anywhere else.

891
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:32,308
Rym: Probably.

892
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:36,298
Scott: Yeah I mean people companies invest a lot into customer acquisition.

893
01:05:36,759 --> 01:05:44,890
Scott: the more lock-in they can do especially if it's technological type lock-in Saves the money on not losing customers.

894
01:05:46,011 --> 01:05:47,398
Scott: Right, you get a customer good.

895
01:05:47,438 --> 01:05:47,900
Scott: They're set.

896
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,950
Scott: All right, we don't have to worry about customer service.

897
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:51,979
Scott: We don't got to spend less money there.

898
01:05:52,401 --> 01:05:54,449
Scott: spend less money everywhere else, right?

899
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:57,180
Scott: Just say to acquire customers and lock them in.

900
01:05:58,432 --> 01:06:01,730
Scott: You you know, not only do you keep getting money from that customer?

901
01:06:02,071 --> 01:06:06,548
Scott: But you save a lot of money and all the other areas of your business because they're stuck with you.

902
01:06:06,568 --> 01:06:13,910
Rym: They got no choice Yep, but in that case, even if it isn't intentional by a vendor many vendors are doing it on purpose for real.

903
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:18,135
Rym: It's their main strategy get people using your thing Keep you in the ecosystem forever.

904
01:06:18,175 --> 01:06:26,165
Rym: Now, you can literally never leave and in fact, there's such a critical business partner some of these smaller Something as a service startups.

905
01:06:26,728 --> 01:06:33,209
Rym: I Suspect their goal is to become so indispensable that their biggest customers fight over who buys them.

906
01:06:33,951 --> 01:06:36,779
Scott: Yep, that's the last kind of lock-in when the show here.

907
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:37,201
Scott: right.

908
01:06:37,221 --> 01:06:41,693
Scott: the last kind of lock-in is the not quite technological Lock-in, right?

909
01:06:41,734 --> 01:06:43,338
Scott: It's like you could leave right?

910
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:50,190
Scott: There's nothing really stopping you from leaving, but it's a purely Money audience lock-in, right?

911
01:06:50,290 --> 01:07:00,083
Scott: so if you are a restaurant and you want to go off of grubhub if you are a Nerd making art and you want to stop using Kickstarter.

912
01:07:00,143 --> 01:07:02,210
Scott: It's like you're not stuck with them at all.

913
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:07,088
Scott: There is nothing technological Forcing you to stay with grubhub or to stay with Kickstarter.

914
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:12,270
Scott: in fact They're platform gets we're selling your right or to keep selling your books on Amazon.

915
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:19,210
Scott: If you're an author you could easily just no problem sell your book somewhere else sell your art somewhere else use a different crowdfunding platform.

916
01:07:19,551 --> 01:07:30,491
Scott: No technological lock-in whatsoever, but they have this audience and you look at your numbers and you say well My last project half the money came from Kickstarter Backers.

917
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:36,493
Scott: if I go to some other platform Indiegogo game found whatever You know.

918
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:42,513
Scott: just do a pre-order on itch.io or my own shopping site or whatever I'm like.

919
01:07:42,613 --> 01:07:44,820
Scott: how much of that 50% am I gonna lose?

920
01:07:44,901 --> 01:07:49,300
Scott: how right if I take my restaurant off of grubhub And I'm only listed on.

921
01:07:49,321 --> 01:07:51,654
Scott: you know seamless is grubhub So not there either.

922
01:07:51,674 --> 01:08:04,830
Scott: right on Chow now and my own website You know and my obviously my storefront itself physically, right How many customers are gonna order dinner somewhere else because they just go to grubhub and then search for food?

923
01:08:05,632 --> 01:08:07,196
Scott: Yeah, will that ruin my restaurant?

924
01:08:07,597 --> 01:08:11,547
Scott: am I therefore now stuck with grubhub even though for no technological reason?

925
01:08:11,828 --> 01:08:15,761
Rym: and the answer is often Yes, because honestly, uh, I have there's all.

926
01:08:15,781 --> 01:08:17,486
Rym: there's a barrier to entry there as well.

927
01:08:17,567 --> 01:08:20,837
Rym: if you don't use grubhub How are you going to accept online order?

928
01:08:20,898 --> 01:08:25,836
Rym: seamless is just as bad like they're basically the same except There's the same company.

929
01:08:25,876 --> 01:08:26,779
Scott: They're literally the same thing.

930
01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:29,189
Rym: They're weirdly still separate like website.

931
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:31,279
Scott: Well, I think it's because there are some people.

932
01:08:31,321 --> 01:08:32,627
Scott: I think it's simply a branding thing.

933
01:08:32,688 --> 01:08:32,929
Scott: is that?

934
01:08:32,948 --> 01:08:43,062
Scott: yeah I think it's a hundred percent the same thing on the back end, but I think some people it's like You know custom on the customer side Are like I'll go to seem and they don't want to do a grubhub.

935
01:08:43,122 --> 01:08:45,350
Scott: is now seamless or a seamless is now grubhub?

936
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:47,301
Scott: Yeah, I'll campaign right.

937
01:08:47,341 --> 01:08:48,064
Scott: They'd rather just.

938
01:08:48,246 --> 01:08:52,770
Scott: but there's also The same white label app with two at two things on it, right?

939
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:53,560
Rym: What are you gonna use?

940
01:08:54,529 --> 01:09:00,988
Rym: Like there aren't that many other players in that space and even if there's a caviar chow now There's a play.

941
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:06,390
Rym: But if you want to use one of those you're gonna be one of like the four Restaurants in your town on it and no one uses it.

942
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:12,510
Rym: Yep, or the only way you can make your own direct order site and I've largely given up on that.

943
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:14,830
Rym: I have really tried to not use grubhub for restaurants.

944
01:09:15,871 --> 01:09:20,966
Rym: Several restaurants in our neighborhood like even talk about has a direct order on their website didn't fucking work.

945
01:09:21,447 --> 01:09:22,149
Rym: I tried it twice.

946
01:09:23,086 --> 01:09:31,627
Scott: like Like couldn't replace has a on their site and integrated they have an order thing.

947
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,068
Scott: That's not.

948
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:32,990
Scott: it's not first party.

949
01:09:33,071 --> 01:09:34,763
Scott: It's like they're paying a third party for that.

950
01:09:34,944 --> 01:09:41,850
Scott: Yeah, yeah there And I try to use that but the technology of it is so shitty.

951
01:09:42,533 --> 01:09:43,420
Scott: The rest right.

952
01:09:43,622 --> 01:09:48,944
Scott: the restaurant is like, yeah Sometimes if you use that one It doesn't print out and like properly on our side.

953
01:09:49,045 --> 01:09:52,506
Scott: and it's like, you know The grubhub one because it's so big and ubiquitous.

954
01:09:52,546 --> 01:10:00,910
Scott: Not only Does it bring in more customers for the restaurant but it works properly because it's got a huge engineering staff behind it.

955
01:10:01,171 --> 01:10:07,135
Rym: Yeah, so but that huge engineering staff and that like even if they're not a monopoly There's plenty of competitors in the space.

956
01:10:07,215 --> 01:10:20,439
Rym: sort of it's moot because the cost to build something good enough To work as well as the user interface of grubhub already works Means you'll never make enough money to recoup that investment.

957
01:10:21,141 --> 01:10:32,645
Scott: Yep, but it's actually good, you know in New York City specifically They are you know, we have some laws coming in or already out that are like You know putting the hammer down on grubhub to make them force them to be less evil.

958
01:10:32,746 --> 01:10:33,569
Scott: so you can be less.

959
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:38,690
Rym: Morally, I mean the right way to go in New York City the right way to go in New York City.

960
01:10:38,992 --> 01:10:40,282
Rym: That's exactly the kind of thing.

961
01:10:40,322 --> 01:10:46,554
Rym: I'd like to see a municipal public option for Yeah Imagine there's an end like food.

962
01:10:46,574 --> 01:10:52,869
Rym: that NYC literally was just a New York City grubhub equivalent that is sponsored by the by the city.

963
01:10:53,692 --> 01:10:56,927
Scott: The city hires a team of engineers to make it and then it.

964
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,956
Scott: you know The restaurants pay.

965
01:10:59,077 --> 01:11:00,524
Scott: everyone pays for it through taxes.

966
01:11:00,584 --> 01:11:01,810
Scott: the restaurants don't to pay anything.

967
01:11:02,111 --> 01:11:03,257
Scott: Yeah, they don't.

968
01:11:03,377 --> 01:11:05,448
Scott: we only put restaurant or maybe the restaurant small amount.

969
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:08,825
Rym: But it's fair and you treat that basically as part of the restaurant tax.

970
01:11:08,866 --> 01:11:09,670
Rym: you do it in a fair man.

971
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:12,002
Rym: There's a lot of ways to go right tips.

972
01:11:12,062 --> 01:11:12,605
Scott: I'll go to the.

973
01:11:12,645 --> 01:11:21,290
Rym: you know, whatever public options are a way to Prevent certain kinds of lock-in on technology.

974
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:23,075
Rym: But they baby look.

975
01:11:23,496 --> 01:11:27,146
Rym: the only place we see technology public options in any meaningful way right now.

976
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:28,750
Scott: This is about municipal ISPs.

977
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:29,916
Scott: Yeah, it's like that's.

978
01:11:29,976 --> 01:11:31,041
Rym: that's the one area.

979
01:11:31,081 --> 01:11:32,810
Rym: and even then look at such a lot.

980
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:36,863
Rym: That's a huge lock-in right where you know, you're exciting right now.

981
01:11:37,124 --> 01:11:37,886
Rym: There's actually there.

982
01:11:37,906 --> 01:11:38,910
Rym: It looks like there's some talk.

983
01:11:39,071 --> 01:11:39,996
Rym: Well, I have a.

984
01:11:40,017 --> 01:11:41,567
Scott: there was also some FCC talk.

985
01:11:41,607 --> 01:11:46,810
Rym: I think oh There's a talk of a right to choose your internet provider if you live in a large apartment building.

986
01:11:47,473 --> 01:11:48,077
Scott: Yep, they were.

987
01:11:48,097 --> 01:11:48,941
Scott: they'll say you can't.

988
01:11:48,982 --> 01:11:50,430
Scott: they're gonna get rid of these deals.

989
01:11:50,691 --> 01:11:54,964
Scott: Yeah, I as P's make with buildings to like, you know have unique access to the.

990
01:11:54,984 --> 01:11:56,690
Rym: weirdly my building didn't make a deal.

991
01:11:56,873 --> 01:12:00,082
Rym: I guess they made a deal with both Time Warner deal.

992
01:12:00,102 --> 01:12:04,806
Rym: Yeah We have FiOS and Comcast and something else.

993
01:12:04,826 --> 01:12:05,490
Rym: There's like three here.

994
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:05,912
Rym: You can pick.

995
01:12:05,932 --> 01:12:09,929
Scott: we have files and RCN and obviously I guess you could hook up the phone line if you wanted to.

996
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:14,110
Scott: But I guess Verizon just comes in with the FiOS.

997
01:12:14,472 --> 01:12:17,729
Rym: I unhook the phone lines and pushed him into the wall and replaced him with Ethernet.

998
01:12:18,071 --> 01:12:22,709
Scott: I assume that if I got if I asked for phone service, they would hook it up through the FiOS fiber, right?

999
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:23,976
Scott: They wouldn't hook it up to the.

1000
01:12:24,277 --> 01:12:26,830
Rym: I don't know what my phone options are cuz I never even asked.

1001
01:12:26,931 --> 01:12:28,378
Rym: I can't imagine wanting a phone.

1002
01:12:28,418 --> 01:12:30,810
Scott: I can get that I can get a triple play from Verizon.

1003
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:31,553
Rym: Oh, yeah, I could do that.

1004
01:12:31,573 --> 01:12:34,345
Rym: But I wonder if I could go to another local phone loop.

1005
01:12:34,968 --> 01:12:37,515
Rym: I just don't know Why would anyone?

1006
01:12:37,877 --> 01:12:38,923
Rym: but what's a landline?

1007
01:12:39,144 --> 01:12:47,750
Rym: So yeah Anyway, so I think there's a bunch more More narrow topics we can talk about in this phase.

1008
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:50,317
Rym: This is like the intro to the space.

1009
01:12:50,418 --> 01:12:53,125
Rym: lock-in is actually a really broad topic and you might see.

1010
01:12:53,145 --> 01:12:58,323
Rym: if you have any thoughts on Lock-ins let us know in the forum because we could do an episode on a future Monday.

1011
01:12:58,644 --> 01:13:09,854
Scott: come to any of the GeekNights community places discord forum Twitter wherever and YouTube comments and Just tell us all the examples of lock-ins that we didn't think of.

1012
01:13:11,957 --> 01:13:14,480
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
