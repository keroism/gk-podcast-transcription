1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,688
Rym: It's Monday, August 22nd, 2022.

2
00:00:09,688 --> 00:00:15,467
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,528 --> 00:00:19,880
Rym: We are going to advise you on how not to suck at getting a new smartphone.

4
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:21,677
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,603 --> 00:00:25,275
Scott: So the one of those dates with but a lot of twos in it.

6
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:30,267
Rym: Yeah To 22 22 a lot of twos.

7
00:00:30,307 --> 00:00:31,150
Rym: I do like a lot of twos.

8
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:37,420
Rym: There aren't that many big palindromic dromic dates that are gonna come up in the rest of our lives, unfortunately.

9
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:40,267
Scott: Yeah, I mean we already had February 22nd 2022.

10
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:40,989
Scott: I mean we had.

11
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:48,169
Scott: we had November 11th 2011 a while ago Yep So I was 2011 not 1000 right?

12
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:48,712
Scott: I mean what?

13
00:00:48,712 --> 00:00:52,778
Rym: 1011 happened, but nobody quite.

14
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:55,527
Rym: Anyway,

15
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:56,315
Scott: so,

16
00:00:56,436 --> 00:01:18,840
Rym: uh Normally, well as you may know the listener that when Scott and I have an opening bit some we might say at the start The show if we don't no matter what happens in our lives no matter how many things happen between When we do one gig nights and when we do the next gig nights We will talk about one thing first Whatever is top of mind and the rest is deleted from our brains forever.

17
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:28,534
Rym: but I remember what I was going to say from Thursday when we skipped the show because Enough further incident happened today.

18
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:36,704
Rym: So I have four Biking related open ebits that I don't think we have time for all four it's or they are very short.

19
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:44,753
Rym: the I'll start with the most egregious one because it is the the funniest one to me, so We biked over the weekend all up to Tarrytown.

20
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:46,420
Rym: Just now I had some lunch bike back home.

21
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,449
Rym: there's like a nice chill biking day and About 10 miles south of Tarrytown.

22
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:57,054
Rym: I want you to guess what I saw Parked on the side of the South County Trailway.

23
00:01:57,074 --> 00:01:58,240
Rym: You have one guest.

24
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:00,405
Rym: Yeah, it's parked.

25
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:01,609
Scott: it has to be a vehicle.

26
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:03,235
Scott: it's probably a city bike.

27
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:06,707
Rym: it was one of the white Super expensive city by.

28
00:02:06,888 --> 00:02:08,413
Scott: someone else posted a photo of it.

29
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:08,815
Scott: I saw it.

30
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,360
Rym: Yep parked 10 miles.

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:19,494
Rym: so this thing was parked so far outside of New York City and Someone had stripped the entire front wheel off of it.

32
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:22,306
Scott: Oh The one I saw still had a wheel.

33
00:02:22,507 --> 00:02:23,130
Scott: Yeah, it was.

34
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,700
Scott: it was in good shape, but it was like in Tarrytown.

35
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:30,760
Rym: This is along the trail way like just south of Tarrytown.

36
00:02:32,203 --> 00:02:36,900
Rym: Yeah, I am 100% sure that one was stolen and someone wrote it north until the GPS locked it out.

37
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:51,625
Scott: I think people either a just don't realize that the bikes have time limits and a certain range or Someone checks it out and somehow they lose it and someone else takes it and they now that person Can just ride it with no cons.

38
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:57,000
Rym: I have seen a few times someone straight-up steal someone's city bike and just bike off with it.

39
00:02:57,765 --> 00:02:59,499
Scott: Yeah, don't leave the city bike, you know.

40
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,268
Scott: No I'm talking like on someone.

41
00:03:01,308 --> 00:03:03,500
Rym: make sure that someone would say this was a few weeks ago.

42
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,599
Rym: Someone was just like they pulled up near me.

43
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:19,369
Rym: I was like waiting for a red light on him on a city bike myself and this dude just like pulls up pulls off into the sidewalk gets off the city bike and is standing near it like right there just looking at his cell phone and some kid just Walks by and just grabs it and just bolts.

44
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:21,577
Scott: Yeah, don't get off of it.

45
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:31,955
Rym: Yeah So, uh today just now bike in home on the city bike I come around the corner You know that u-turn to get on the Queensborough Bridge from Manhattan.

46
00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:35,220
Rym: There's like a weird Intersection like in the bike lane.

47
00:03:35,240 --> 00:04:05,820
Rym: It's like this really weird u-turn and I'm coming in real slow on a slow City bike far to the right and two road bikers come around the corner at extremely high speed straight for me The first one sees that I'm there because I'm like in the lane And screeches to a stop like the whole rear wheel kicks up and her friend just slams into her from behind and they both eat shit and flip over right in front of Me and they fall to the ground in a heap literally in front of me as I'm just stopped.

48
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:11,618
Rym: They were kind of okay But they must have been going like 15 or 20 miles an hour coming around that corner.

49
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:13,182
Rym: for some reason I don't.

50
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:19,206
Scott: I mean it's a steep downhill so you can you go fast, but at the bottom of it There's a hairpin.

51
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:20,550
Scott: there's a hairpin turn.

52
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,278
Scott: you got like literally like it's really tight you have to stop.

53
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:25,719
Rym: This isn't even like Mount Occhia situation.

54
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:32,419
Rym: It's like that more advanced mountain that starts with an eye from like season four of initial D. Like this is some dangerous shit.

55
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:37,109
Rym: and So the third incident bike.

56
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:37,550
Scott: it's not.

57
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:39,457
Scott: it's not a car situation, right?

58
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:46,674
Rym: It's like like some bikers make poor decisions to Coming home from work on Friday or on Thursday.

59
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:59,000
Rym: actually right before that show I'm biking coming home and I see up in the distance on the bike path a ton of cops everywhere and a crowd And I'm thinking I might have to take a weird detour big car accident.

60
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:10,959
Rym: And as I approach I discover a car has some has crashed in a place that it would take some effort to get a car Into completely blocking the bike lane and is completely just fucked up.

61
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:13,550
Rym: But the funny part is.

62
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,920
Rym: so I slow down and I'm kind of laughing and taking picture of it.

63
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,340
Rym: There's all these cops and I overhear one cop talking to the other cop.

64
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:23,791
Rym: I think they arrested the person who caused this accident.

65
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:25,517
Rym: based on what this collision based on a.

66
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:28,946
Scott: were they perhaps Intoxicated, uh, I don't know.

67
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:35,280
Rym: all I heard from the conversation was I still don't know how they got the car in there.

68
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:38,489
Scott: Well, I mean that's there's a whole division.

69
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,800
Scott: Yeah, that's like, you know that investigates.

70
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:45,049
Scott: Oh, yeah, how much of a problem right car crashes are.

71
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,920
Scott: they have an entire division of police who are detectives who are experts at?

72
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,000
Scott: Investigating that one exact thing and nothing else.

73
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,719
Scott: They you know, they look like tire tracks and then the damage on the car and they you know every you know.

74
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,680
Scott: So my dad actually I learned and figure out exactly what happened.

75
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,380
Rym: I weirdly learned a lot about that as a kid because my dad was a senior firefighter.

76
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:15,700
Rym: So a firefighter is usually part of those kinds of investigations Automotive forensics or whatever exactly because it overlaps a little bit with arson investigation type stuff.

77
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:20,800
Rym: So like the law enforcement forensics often include EMTs and firefighters and other people.

78
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:23,529
Rym: but also he knew a lot of cops and he had.

79
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:32,033
Rym: he had the expected low opinion of police officers that you would Expect from someone like my dad, but I remember his little kids.

80
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:37,170
Rym: one thing he would he taught me and my brother is like What happens when there's a big car accident?

81
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,400
Rym: Like we'd be driving and he'd see something he'd point out.

82
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:43,717
Rym: Oh, see, there's a guy in a white shirt right there and another guy in a white shirt.

83
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:44,479
Rym: Someone died.

84
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:46,804
Rym: Like he would tell.

85
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:52,556
Rym: like he taught us all these like here's how to know what's going on at a weird scene When there was a car collision of some kind.

86
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:55,819
Rym: So last the absolute bonkers story.

87
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:58,427
Rym: So Thursday morning the same day.

88
00:06:58,488 --> 00:06:59,431
Rym: I encountered this accident.

89
00:06:59,472 --> 00:07:00,094
Rym: There's a collision.

90
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:01,078
Rym: I'm driving biking to work.

91
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:04,652
Scott: It's not easy is it?

92
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:06,901
Scott: Website?

93
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:11,515
Rym: I try really hard to never say car accident because there are.

94
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:15,937
Scott: there are so few car Accidents that I can probably cover zero car accidents.

95
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:27,235
Rym: now Imagine imagine someone's driving 20 miles an hour and their car gets struck by lightning Killing them and it then rolls over someone else who was also struck by lightning.

96
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:28,278
Rym: That is an ad that is our.

97
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:31,675
Scott: That is an accident, but it's not a car accident.

98
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:48,091
Rym: That's a Weather accident, so I'm biking to work that same day on a city bike and a car pulls into the bike lane to like make an illegal left turn and clips a Delivery biker with his rearview mirror and the bikers fine.

99
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:54,499
Rym: the biker like swerves out of the way and flips them off and heads off And there's a bunch of other bikers around and it happens like right in front of me.

100
00:07:54,981 --> 00:08:00,120
Rym: So I just like bike around the situation and keep going and here's some yelling and hawking behind me like whatever.

101
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,568
Rym: Just ignore that kind of situation.

102
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:03,600
Rym: definitely don't stick around for that kind of situation.

103
00:08:04,782 --> 00:08:13,960
Rym: I keep biking I get to the next intersection and a car Like turns left and cuts across the bike lane and just stops like in front of me and some other bikers.

104
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:16,580
Rym: So I also ignore this situation.

105
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:24,465
Rym: I just like bike around it and keep going and I did not realize at that moment It was the same car that hit the delivery guy before Some fancy Benz.

106
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:26,896
Rym: so then I the third intersection.

107
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:27,820
Rym: There's a red light.

108
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,422
Rym: So I stopped.

109
00:08:28,602 --> 00:08:35,140
Rym: there's a few other bikers there and suddenly someone comes up from behind me and forcibly pulls me off my stop city bike.

110
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:40,919
Rym: And this dude just starts screaming at me that I hit his car kick him in the nuts and run away.

111
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,713
Rym: So I did the move that I have done a few times in my life.

112
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:46,520
Rym: I highly recommend this move.

113
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:50,100
Rym: This is one of the surest ways to get out of this kind of situation.

114
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:56,580
Rym: Don't actually call the cops because that's a mixed bag, but pretend you're calling the cops.

115
00:08:57,741 --> 00:09:02,565
Rym: So I back away from this guy a little bit and he's like holding on to the city bike and like you can't leave you Hit my car.

116
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,119
Rym: You can't leave his flipping the fuck out.

117
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:08,480
Rym: So I'm like, I'm gonna call the cops and I pull my phone out and I just like fake it.

118
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,406
Rym: I hold it up and he got.

119
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:18,599
Rym: he backs off a little bit and he seems to think that I'm gonna call the cops and The cops are gonna come and sort out his insurance situation with.

120
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,695
Rym: you know This biker that he claims hit him and then I just start saying nonsense.

121
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:24,000
Rym: I just start lying into the phone.

122
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,410
Rym: I'm like, yeah, this crazy guy is attacking me.

123
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:28,800
Rym: I'm on I'm on this street at this intersection?

124
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,306
Rym: No, this guy's flipping out.

125
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:33,400
Rym: I start describing the guy to nobody on my cell phone.

126
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:38,555
Rym: So the guy actually backs off a little bit more but he won't leave and he's like.

127
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:40,080
Rym: he seems to hesitate a little bit.

128
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:46,702
Rym: He looks down for a second and I just hop back into the city bike and fucking book it Behind me.

129
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:52,800
Rym: I hear him yelling you can't fucking get away from me and I hear a car door slam and tires screeching.

130
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:56,600
Rym: He screeches forward in the road almost causing a collision.

131
00:09:57,062 --> 00:10:01,000
Rym: I said it right that time and he's clearly gonna try to like head me off the next intersection.

132
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:09,858
Rym: So I see his car just go past and then I just backtrack like 10 feet and just go down a side street And I'm gone and I have no idea how that situation resolved itself.

133
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:14,251
Scott: Do not engage the over dangerous person.

134
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:16,560
Rym: Nope, not at all, but I got to tell you head away.

135
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:30,139
Rym: Pretending to call the cops on someone loudly and in front of them is a Pretty easy way to get out of a lot of situations because unless someone is actually insane That'll give most agro people a tiny bit of pause.

136
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:34,632
Rym: Yeah, that was those are my biking stories.

137
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:35,999
Rym: got any news?

138
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,126
Scott: See what's in the news talk about that.

139
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:43,697
Rym: open the the program illegally packaged in 14 distributions.

140
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:55,020
Scott: Oh Okay, so yeah, so if you write a program in the go Programming language we did an episode about this right, you know, it's it's likely that it will be statically linked.

141
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,149
Scott: So any libraries that you included are going to also.

142
00:10:58,169 --> 00:11:02,040
Scott: the code of those libraries will be included in your executable that you have.

143
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:04,959
Scott: You know you that comes out of the the go compiler, right?

144
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:25,800
Scott: which means You know that's different than say if you write a C program and you just dynamically link a library That means the person running the software has to go get that library on their own and install it somewhere else, right and that means Let's say you were to include some open source library in your software, right?

145
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,364
Scott: It's like.

146
00:11:26,404 --> 00:11:29,620
Scott: well if it's dynamically linked It doesn't really matter what you know.

147
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,001
Scott: It's like.

148
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:30,282
Scott: you're.

149
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:34,413
Scott: the license of your program can be anything because you're only.

150
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:36,860
Scott: your program only includes code that you wrote.

151
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:38,859
Scott: So you can give it whatever license you want.

152
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:43,792
Scott: And even though it may depend upon code that someone else wrote it's not.

153
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:46,720
Scott: you're not including that you're not giving out copies of that.

154
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:56,099
Scott: You're just saying yeah If you want to use my program that has this license You're going to need to on your own obtain that other software that has a different license, you know.

155
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:01,931
Scott: But if it's statically linked well, it's included right.

156
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:12,129
Scott: you're giving out someone else's code along with your code and so this person, you know was looking into it and They found some software a lot of people are using.

157
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,820
Scott: that includes other software that has like no license.

158
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:22,740
Scott: What to speak of right and the license of the software that includes the no license software.

159
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,374
Scott: Right does not line up and it's it's like.

160
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:33,734
Scott: this is an open source, bro You can't be doing this but all kinds of people are doing it because who's paying?

161
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:38,460
Scott: or nobody is like You know checking these things over outside of large companies.

162
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:45,376
Rym: Well, never mind that the the status of how much enforcement you could get if any of this stuff is not a hundred percent settled in court.

163
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:58,224
Scott: Well, there's no info, you know, there's no reason to do any enforcement when none of these people, you know Even though these different open source slash free to various extent software's are You know, I guess.

164
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:01,698
Scott: well the one with no license isn't free, but it's just sitting there on github.

165
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:02,220
Scott: There it is.

166
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,008
Scott: You can see all the sir.

167
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:04,200
Scott: All right, it's like people are just using.

168
00:13:05,362 --> 00:13:07,728
Scott: They just didn't bother to put a license on it.

169
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:11,398
Scott: So it's like no one's making any money.

170
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:13,103
Scott: There's nothing to Enforce.

171
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:14,227
Scott: what are you gonna enforce?

172
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,608
Scott: Right?

173
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:14,909
Scott: Yeah.

174
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:17,799
Rym: Well, I guess you have to show what damage was caused to you.

175
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:20,147
Scott: Yeah, it's like there's nothing.

176
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,414
Scott: but you know, that's that's the problem there.

177
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,480
Scott: There was a copyright infringement surely.

178
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:37,520
Scott: But there's probably all sorts of incidents like this and I think it's a good argument that for open source Distributions you should be sticking to dynamically linked things, right?

179
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:51,680
Scott: To avoid these kind of situations and then you just need to check the licenses of the programs that you are directly Including because it's basically gonna be next to impossible to actually check all the licenses of statically linked things.

180
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,463
Scott: It's like you get to.

181
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:53,566
Scott: it's hard.

182
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:57,319
Scott: Yeah to find out what's in there, you know, it's a lot of effort.

183
00:13:57,922 --> 00:13:58,123
Scott: So.

184
00:13:58,947 --> 00:14:07,480
Rym: but yet this story kind of blew up because people like oh snap Oops, and this is the tip of the iceberg of this kind of thing just in the general open source ecosystem.

185
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,120
Scott: Of course, this happens all the time.

186
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,299
Scott: This the only reason this blew up is someone actually decided to take a few minutes to like look into it.

187
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:21,339
Rym: Yeah, it's like oh this probably happens every damn day Yep, and it's hard to say how more like how much of a problem it is.

188
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:24,991
Rym: Should anything be done about it like that's?

189
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,937
Rym: those are questions that very few people care about.

190
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:27,518
Rym: the answers to.

191
00:14:27,538 --> 00:14:36,800
Scott: to be honest No, but if you're promising, you know open source software to someone else, you know You have to make sure that your your end is is legit.

192
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:47,740
Rym: Yeah, of course how many people just make stuff and license it Creative Commons But they use material that is not compatible with that license that they just got from somewhere.

193
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:52,477
Rym: You see that a lot out on the internet especially in creative works especially in GeekNights.

194
00:14:52,697 --> 00:14:54,904
Rym: Yeah There is very little.

195
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:56,991
Rym: I will say that there's very little in GeekNights.

196
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:59,940
Scott: That is not duly licensed where we're conscious of it.

197
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:07,598
Rym: But you know Yeah, the one that's the most dangerous is also the one that only one person has ever recognized and a lot of.

198
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:12,297
Scott: there's a lot of panel slides that took just images from Google image only old ones actually.

199
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:20,658
Rym: I have been Extremely studious about getting licenses for every image we use or having a clear fair use defense for at least five years now.

200
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,220
Rym: every slide Yeah, and I don't be stuck.

201
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:26,738
Scott: Videos right there YouTube videos out there, right?

202
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,946
Scott: Which are you know, maybe?

203
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:32,500
Scott: and then the Zeke nights episodes of some audio clips here and there.

204
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:34,806
Rym: The stingers might not be a problem.

205
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:36,632
Rym: But anyway a little fun thing.

206
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:37,554
Rym: There's an app.

207
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:39,119
Rym: I'm not endorsing this app.

208
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:43,477
Rym: I have not like done a full security analysis of it or anything like.

209
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:47,399
Rym: do not Think that I am saying anything more than what I'm saying right now.

210
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,360
Rym: But me and Scott and a few of our friends are trying out this be real app, which is one.

211
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:54,285
Scott: It's the cool new thing.

212
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:59,133
Scott: The kids are doing and usually when the kids are doing a cool new thing Like the tick-tocks of the snapchats.

213
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:00,100
Scott: I just ignore that shit.

214
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:07,560
Scott: Yeah, but the be real is a cool new thing and I was like, alright, you know This seems like a thing that can replace wordle, right?

215
00:16:08,043 --> 00:16:08,385
Scott: I'm gonna.

216
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:10,838
Scott: I'm gonna stick with it to replace wordles.

217
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:18,980
Scott: my thing Yep, I you know, it's basically the way it works is once a day at an unknown time.

218
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:22,800
Scott: You don't know when but it will be during a typical awake hour.

219
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,229
Rym: I'm curious to see what it's gonna do.

220
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:27,228
Rym: when I'm in London and you're all at home You can change the time.

221
00:16:27,248 --> 00:16:28,416
Scott: There's four time selections.

222
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:28,919
Scott: You would change it.

223
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,869
Rym: Oh, yeah, but I wonder what it'll do for me in regard to all of you.

224
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,625
Scott: You have to change it - anyway.

225
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:46,460
Scott: But yeah, see you It picks a time at random but it's the same time for everyone in your zone of the world, right the world?

226
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:51,380
Scott: I think they split into four or five pieces basically and a notification pops up.

227
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,994
Scott: So you have to give this app notification permission.

228
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:54,999
Scott: Otherwise, it's kind of useless.

229
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:05,319
Scott: And when that notification pops up you have two minutes to take a photo So you can't prepare anything like fucking Instagram or you know Photoshop anything?

230
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:23,807
Scott: But unless you sit there all day waiting for it You take a photo and it will take a photo simultaneously with both the front and rear cameras on your phone and then you can add a caption to it and then it posts it and You're basically You know sharing one photo a day.

231
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:26,294
Scott: You can't over share or under share, right?

232
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:28,440
Scott: Well, you could under share you guys not participate.

233
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:33,480
Scott: You don't see what anyone else shared that day unless you also share that day.

234
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:36,800
Scott: So there's like an incentive into sharing every day.

235
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:43,629
Rym: Yeah can post late if you miss it, but it tattles on you and tells all your friends Oh, we're in posted this one two hours late.

236
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,135
Rym: So read into that what you will.

237
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:46,460
Scott: Yeah, I cheated once right?

238
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:53,960
Scott: It's like you can cheat and just post late But it tells everyone and I'm sure there's probably some way to hack this thing.

239
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,576
Scott: It's like, you know, this only happens if you use the app in good faith.

240
00:17:57,978 --> 00:18:05,760
Scott: you could Find some way to hack it and send you know interface with their API that I'm sure exists and just post whatever you want.

241
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,987
Rym: I guess here's what I like about it.

242
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:07,831
Rym: It's simple.

243
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:09,340
Rym: It just works.

244
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:10,968
Rym: It doesn't ask me to do a lot.

245
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,299
Rym: Like there's not a bunch of features and nonsense in there.

246
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:15,471
Rym: It doesn't charge don't scroll.

247
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,738
Rym: It doesn't show me any ads.

248
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,720
Rym: Yeah, I look at it exactly once a day.

249
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,875
Rym: There's nothing to look at in there unless I want to go look at my own history Which is already actually pretty interesting to be honest.

250
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:32,060
Scott: Yeah So, yeah, it's you know, I think it's really getting back to like what you know.

251
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,520
Scott: The a lot of the apps were like supposed to be in their their early days, right?

252
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,720
Scott: It's like there's this sort of problem where you know people's Instagram feeds or Facebook feeds.

253
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:50,606
Scott: They're taking pictures like the best exciting parts of their lives and you get sort of this false Impression that everyone's having a great time doing awesome shit all the time Like you think that we have share.

254
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:53,297
Rym: what if you like if I did my curated my life that way.

255
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:58,980
Rym: every day I'm either having a fancy cocktail or traveling the world or like on an epic bike ride.

256
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:10,043
Rym: But with be real I had an epic bike ride on Sunday But you know my be real photo is half awake in the dark in my pajamas watching a rerun of deep space 9 On the TV.

257
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:20,560
Scott: Yeah, it's like there are some days where it's like I did jack all that day But be real happens to pop up like it's something at least mildly interesting like the grocery store.

258
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:34,363
Scott: And there are other days where it's like I was at the beach and I was at a party right and when does be real pop up like After I've gotten home and I'm poking the computer and it's like I'm gonna get mostly poking the computer Photos here.

259
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,949
Scott: Why where were the rest of the day?

260
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:39,159
Scott: It's like, you know, but yeah, it's gonna.

261
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,379
Scott: you know It's a once a day thing.

262
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:57,315
Scott: It'll be entertaining for a brief period of time until the event as soon as they take advantage of you know privacy violating or Advertisement showing or send me a notification other than the notification that says it's be real time.

263
00:19:57,335 --> 00:19:59,280
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna delete it instantly.

264
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:03,873
Rym: So the listeners already pointed out, you know, I'm sensing a lot of porcelain throne picks.

265
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:07,533
Rym: that does not happen yet But but we're waiting for it.

266
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:08,420
Scott: We anticipate it.

267
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:17,399
Rym: All I'm gonna say is I've decided one I'm only gonna you be friends with people in this app that I am like close personal like in person serious friends with and to.

268
00:20:18,642 --> 00:20:19,287
Rym: I'm gonna go hard.

269
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:22,563
Rym: I'm gonna do it if I'm pooping Guess what?

270
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:24,931
Scott: I mean, I wouldn't take a picture down low.

271
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:29,824
Rym: I'm not taking a picture of my poop and or You'd see my face.

272
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:34,601
Scott: you would see that I'm clearly in a bathroom and you would see the door to the bathroom or the back Of it.

273
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:35,889
Rym: You're gonna see what I'm up to.

274
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:37,578
Scott: some towels, I guess.

275
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:47,999
Rym: Okay, so in some other news There's a California school in Fresno high school and they have decided to ban cell phones full stop.

276
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,599
Rym: kids Just can't bring cell phones into the school.

277
00:20:50,863 --> 00:21:05,183
Scott: Well in New York City They tried this at one point and what happened was there were these trucks that would set up outside the school and kids would pay the truck Person to take their phone hold on to it sort of like a coat check and then give the phone back when the kid left School,

278
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:05,526
Rym: yeah

279
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:07,339
Scott: for like a small, you know deposit fee.

280
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:13,620
Scott: Are these kids gonna just leave their phones at home or is someone gonna come along with a phone deposit truck?

281
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:14,912
Rym: I mean, this is all stupid.

282
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:15,759
Rym: You want to know why?

283
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,808
Rym: Schools suck and kids hate them.

284
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:19,036
Rym: shit like this.

285
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:21,144
Rym: the same Happen when we were kids.

286
00:21:21,224 --> 00:21:24,294
Rym: I remember I got a deep shit because I brought.

287
00:21:24,475 --> 00:21:26,019
Rym: I brought my walkman to school.

288
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:32,540
Rym: Walkman's were banned in my middle school despite the fact that I only used it to listen to music on the bus.

289
00:21:32,962 --> 00:21:35,959
Rym: But the fact that it was in my locker was a big fucking deal to the school.

290
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:38,703
Rym: But anyway This is stupid.

291
00:21:38,784 --> 00:21:41,292
Rym: That whole concept is stupid, but I want to point something out here.

292
00:21:41,793 --> 00:21:43,760
Rym: The question is more around.

293
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:46,066
Rym: Why are schools doing this?

294
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:47,992
Rym: God, why would a school do this?

295
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:48,373
Rym: What are they?

296
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:50,920
Scott: Why did first-grade ban Trapper Keepers?

297
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:51,661
Rym: Yep.

298
00:21:52,202 --> 00:21:58,600
Rym: Now on one hand some schools make the rationalization that these devices are distracting kids, but kids are.

299
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,227
Rym: Do you forget what it was like being a kid?

300
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:05,040
Rym: I could be distracted by nothing in middle school.

301
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:10,964
Rym: A leaf could blow by the window and I'm gone like Kids will distract themselves.

302
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:13,150
Rym: They'll draw the cool S on their desk if they have to.

303
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,153
Rym: Yep.

304
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:24,893
Scott: I think what it is is that you know you That at least from the perspective of someone who went to American public schools Right is that there were problems with kids that would happen.

305
00:22:25,114 --> 00:22:27,120
Scott: right, you know and various problems, right?

306
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,646
Scott: Like one kid has a Trapper Keeper.

307
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:32,320
Scott: The other one doesn't so it causes jealousy conflict, etc.

308
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:39,738
Scott: Right, or you know, it's like some kid has a cool hat and then you know other kid bullies and takes the hat.

309
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:44,859
Scott: or you Know these objects right become sort of involved in.

310
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:50,954
Rym: You know misbehavior conflict, but the key is the misbehavior conflict is the problem.

311
00:22:50,994 --> 00:23:04,690
Scott: The bully kid is the problem not the fact Right, so they always so the teachers sort of see these objects magic cards Trapper Keepers phones Right, which are used for you know cyberbullying or whatever.

312
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:07,879
Scott: right are these tools or?

313
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,293
Scott: Catalysts that are being used and involved in all?

314
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:17,700
Scott: like every incident The teacher sees this something, you know, a phone is involved somehow or some object.

315
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,283
Scott: Is it so like?

316
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,960
Scott: let's get rid of all these things object?

317
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,593
Scott: because it's a thing they can actually do with their power that they had the limited power they had.

318
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:29,817
Rym: children have definitely never misbehaved in School until the advent of modern technology.

319
00:23:29,857 --> 00:23:31,827
Rym: We know that Right.

320
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:40,462
Scott: It's like, you know it's but it's a thing that is within the power of the teachers and the school administration to ban objects of various kinds from the School.

321
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:44,940
Scott: and so because they can do it and it's like that's what they do, right?

322
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:46,717
Scott: They have the hammer and there's.

323
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:52,400
Rym: you know I think a lot of it is around this misplaced idea of this wanting a sense of control over the kids.

324
00:23:53,441 --> 00:24:06,460
Scott: Yeah, but so that they end up doing it and it doesn't actually solve the real problem, which is that if the kids are Shitty or the teachers are shitty or the school system is shitty It's gonna be shitty no matter what they bring it.

325
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:13,232
Scott: you know what if you had an awesome school all the kids will be able to bring whatever they want and they would be Cool to each other because everyone would be cool.

326
00:24:13,473 --> 00:24:14,720
Rym: You want to fix those problems?

327
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,980
Rym: I don't start my paying teachers more and have more teachers.

328
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:24,701
Rym: I mean you see like half the teachers in Ohio are gonna go on strike right before school starts because they're not gonna hate shit Good.

329
00:24:25,185 --> 00:24:25,729
Scott: So I was.

330
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,888
Scott: it's like I say this all the time But like, you know give it.

331
00:24:28,948 --> 00:24:31,460
Scott: my ideal life is a life of not working, right?

332
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,796
Scott: But if I have to work my ideal job would be like teach computers to kids.

333
00:24:35,836 --> 00:24:36,740
Scott: that what's better than that.

334
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,625
Scott: Nothing's better than that.

335
00:24:37,706 --> 00:24:40,120
Scott: I'd rather do that than do anything else, right?

336
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:43,125
Rym: That would make society better.

337
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:52,780
Rym: that I would gladly spend 40 hours a week doing not just doing but doing with with an actual sense of inspiration and purpose.

338
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,690
Scott: Enthusiastically doing why don't?

339
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:56,976
Scott: so why don't I do that?

340
00:24:57,057 --> 00:24:57,680
Scott: I could do that.

341
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,364
Scott: Why don't I?

342
00:24:58,384 --> 00:25:00,639
Rym: because you need a master's you'll have to get a master's.

343
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:05,200
Scott: The barrier the barrier to entry to do it is high.

344
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:08,433
Scott: It's harder to get that job than it is to get the job.

345
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:09,497
Scott: I have right.

346
00:25:09,577 --> 00:25:10,099
Scott: number two.

347
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:19,076
Scott: I know because I understand the world that that job will not Consider can be the part of it that I imagine that I really want to do.

348
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:25,837
Scott: teach kids computers Will actually be a small percentage of that job mostly glorified babysitter being paid 30k a year.

349
00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:30,980
Scott: Most of that job is going to be comprised of other bullshit.

350
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:43,442
Scott: that is not what I want to do which is help kids understand the joy of Computers and have a great time and learn and go on to lead wonderful lives and knowing computers better, right and three Right.

351
00:25:43,483 --> 00:25:44,907
Scott: the compensation right.

352
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:51,595
Scott: considering the barrier to entry is high and the hassle of the job is high The compensation is lower.

353
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:52,560
Scott: It's worse way.

354
00:25:52,981 --> 00:26:03,252
Scott: Magnitude orders of magnitude worse than the job I have which is easier to get and less hassle Right, so it's like why would anyone teach right?

355
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,820
Scott: But that's what they that's what the system right?

356
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,880
Scott: They well, they don't want good teaching because good teaching would bring about the good democracy.

357
00:26:11,723 --> 00:26:16,384
Scott: right people in charge of our country don't want that because Democratic.

358
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:20,424
Rym: so not to get too much deeper because we got to move on to some other news and of course the main bit.

359
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:27,733
Rym: but the reason I bring up this story specifically is because Cellphones are different from a lot of the other things.

360
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,440
Rym: cool those band up to this point.

361
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:35,380
Rym: I would argue that cell phones are just an integral natural part of the modern world.

362
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:45,200
Rym: everyone having a smartphone in their pocket is not only a goal but a Positive the negative.

363
00:26:46,301 --> 00:26:51,435
Rym: There are plenty of ways to handle the possible distractions of smartphones in a school.

364
00:26:51,716 --> 00:26:56,174
Rym: and guess what when kids have a job After high school, they're gonna have a cell phone.

365
00:26:56,476 --> 00:26:57,320
Rym: So they better learn.

366
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,587
Scott: I was mad about the same.

367
00:26:58,607 --> 00:27:00,900
Scott: I was mad about calculators in the same way, right?

368
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,532
Scott: I was like, I'm gonna have a calculator my whole life.

369
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:05,200
Scott: Why would you have a no calculator test?

370
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,619
Rym: My high school never had no calculator tests.

371
00:27:08,242 --> 00:27:10,091
Scott: We they were rare but they had them.

372
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,060
Scott: and even though the few we had I was mad.

373
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,004
Scott: I was like this bullshit.

374
00:27:13,285 --> 00:27:15,574
Scott: and then they'd be like, you can't use a program on your calculator.

375
00:27:15,615 --> 00:27:16,900
Scott: and I'm like, I wrote the program.

376
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:19,480
Rym: I had a very similar situation.

377
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:24,057
Rym: I also wrote a program that made it look like you were wiping all the programs off of your calculator.

378
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:24,680
Rym: We had that.

379
00:27:27,243 --> 00:27:34,539
Rym: So, uh, why are schools mad about cell phones specifically, uh This story actually gives you a very clear window into that.

380
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:46,535
Rym: This ban comes not too long after this exact school had a problem Where a kid dressed up in a KKK hood in school and some shit went down.

381
00:27:46,936 --> 00:27:48,360
Rym: and the reason this all came out?

382
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:49,605
Rym: Kids had cell phones.

383
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:52,216
Rym: They took fucking pictures of it and documented that it happened.

384
00:27:52,919 --> 00:28:04,060
Rym: good Yeah I think schools are banning cell phones solely because They are afraid that the students will use the cell phones to document all the egregious shit that happens in our schools.

385
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:05,185
Scott: Good.

386
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:08,260
Rym: I think that is the sole reason schools are getting so aggressive on cell phones.

387
00:28:08,662 --> 00:28:10,533
Rym: Everything else they say is an excuse.

388
00:28:10,915 --> 00:28:11,619
Rym: This is the reason.

389
00:28:13,922 --> 00:28:27,038
Rym: So on some other news, this is a dicey one remember a while back We're talking about Apple and their plan to detect hashes of see Sam which is an acronym for basically Child porn - you know that that whole story.

390
00:28:27,822 --> 00:28:31,340
Rym: Well that type of technology doesn't actually work that well.

391
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:37,200
Rym: And now we have a specific case where that technology ran afoul of the real world, right?

392
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,836
Scott: So this dude had a kid and his kids junk had a medical issue.

393
00:28:42,017 --> 00:28:42,900
Scott: So I had an infection.

394
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:44,185
Rym: Oh, you know what fun fact.

395
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:50,857
Rym: I had some medical issue with my junk when I bruised it in a bike accident not that long ago and guess what I did.

396
00:28:50,877 --> 00:28:58,363
Rym: I Did the exact same thing this father did and a doctor saw looked at a picture of my junk that I sent to them with my smartphone Right.

397
00:28:58,423 --> 00:29:01,500
Scott: So this guy takes a picture of his toddlers junk with his phone.

398
00:29:01,661 --> 00:29:07,930
Scott: Yeah sends it to the doc his doctor his pediatrician Who prescribed antibiotics which cleared up the issue.

399
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,273
Scott: good job doctor, right?

400
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:11,159
Scott: He could just tell what it was from looking at it.

401
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:13,253
Scott: a plus, right.

402
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:25,394
Scott: so What happens is Google comes along and the automatic porn child porn detector detected some child porn and shut him down Right just deleted his account banned him etc.

403
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:27,121
Scott: And you know He goes.

404
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:30,552
Scott: and and also the police were notified and the police investigated.

405
00:29:30,572 --> 00:29:30,994
Scott: right.

406
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:36,324
Scott: somehow miraculously The police Saw the truth.

407
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:39,572
Scott: They saw that exactly what had happened, right?

408
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,196
Scott: It's like, okay, they investigated there.

409
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:42,560
Scott: nothing wrong with investigating.

410
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:43,810
Scott: I don't see any problem with that.

411
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,475
Scott: That's prudent.

412
00:29:44,777 --> 00:29:50,572
Scott: Right and But after they investigated they discovered no crime has been committed here.

413
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:52,096
Scott: This is not child porn.

414
00:29:52,216 --> 00:29:53,640
Scott: This was perfectly fine.

415
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:55,431
Scott: We're not gonna do anything about it.

416
00:29:55,491 --> 00:29:56,175
Scott: No charges.

417
00:29:56,256 --> 00:29:57,970
Scott: No nothing Did.

418
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:58,817
Scott: they did the right thing?

419
00:29:59,481 --> 00:30:00,585
Scott: Google didn't do the right thing.

420
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:01,991
Scott: Google's like you're banned forever.

421
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:03,516
Scott: We're not even gonna say anything.

422
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:04,600
Scott: We're not gonna do anything.

423
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:06,287
Scott: Right, you're just banned forever.

424
00:30:06,327 --> 00:30:06,789
Scott: deal with it.

425
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:08,495
Scott: Yeah, all your photos are gone.

426
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:09,640
Scott: All your emails are gone.

427
00:30:09,922 --> 00:30:28,559
Rym: Now this is where this whole Concept of using hashing algorithms to identify this type of content on platforms I would argue is at least today with present technology Fundamentally flawed in the same way that shot spotter is Fundamentally flawed in the same way that a bunch of news came out today.

428
00:30:28,941 --> 00:30:33,496
Rym: We don't have time to talk about it, but our shot spotter causes more problems than it solves.

429
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:37,050
Scott: It's true It is, you know, it is a problem.

430
00:30:37,231 --> 00:30:39,982
Scott: But I think that even in this case I don't.

431
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:44,300
Scott: I don't think this is a great argument for getting rid of the child porn.

432
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,785
Rym: This is a bad at most.

433
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:52,427
Rym: This is a great argument for companies like Google cannot do this stuff unaccountably and non-transparently Exactly right.

434
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:55,800
Scott: I wrote a whole thing in our forum, which you could join if you wanted to read it, right?

435
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,987
Scott: I wrote when the story came out.

436
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:58,818
Scott: I wrote a whole community dot firm crew calm.

437
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:00,123
Rym: Right.

438
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:05,018
Scott: is that there needs to be some sort of government consumer protection law?

439
00:31:06,062 --> 00:31:11,500
Scott: Right that if you know we have online accounts some of the online accounts are just bullshit like our forum.

440
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,327
Scott: Okay, you should joy get a bullshit account today.

441
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:19,660
Scott: It's free but some accounts people their livelihoods depend on those accounts.

442
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:22,054
Scott: If you have an eBay account, you're running an eBay store.

443
00:31:22,094 --> 00:31:23,100
Scott: That could be your job.

444
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:24,909
Scott: Are you running a YouTube account?

445
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,900
Scott: because you're a YouTube creator and that's your job.

446
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:33,520
Rym: Not only am I fucked if I somehow lost access to my Google account, but GeekNights is fucked like right.

447
00:31:34,062 --> 00:31:37,071
Scott: It's like if I lose access to my Google account somehow.

448
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:42,050
Scott: not only am I fucked many other people are fucked on top of right That are under my digital umbrella, right?

449
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,332
Scott: It's like.

450
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:48,860
Scott: it's not just a hassle It's like a devastating life ruining thing and it should not be permitted to happen.

451
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,000
Scott: I'm not saying it shouldn't be permitted to happen under any circumstance.

452
00:31:55,065 --> 00:32:13,380
Scott: If a Nazis on your platform you absolutely should fuck them over right, but Something like that an important account upon which someone's livelihood is dependent should not be able to be shut down without an open transparent review with some sort of judicial process.

453
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:33,855
Scott: Right and someone who has the human being with the power to make a decision yes or no Right should examine evidence and here, you know Some sort of it doesn't have to be a full-on fucking trial with a jury of your peers Even though that wouldn't be bad right but something you know.

454
00:32:34,357 --> 00:32:35,743
Scott: an arbitrator I don't know.

455
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:38,274
Scott: right lawyers figure it out, but there needs to be something.

456
00:32:38,294 --> 00:32:44,700
Scott: there can't just be Automated email that says no with no explanation with no recourse would know.

457
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:58,460
Rym: This is the logical conclusion of mega corpse like Google and Amazon and Facebook one existing and two Aggressively moving to a model where there is no way to ever talk to a human to get help under any circumstances.

458
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:03,780
Rym: I dare you to interact with Google in a way where a human will talk to you, right?

459
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,052
Scott: We need a. well I can do it because we have that.

460
00:33:06,113 --> 00:33:10,282
Scott: if you pay for Google workspaces You can do now whatever they change the name of it to now It's it.

461
00:33:10,643 --> 00:33:12,149
Scott: but yeah, if you know is how much?

462
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,840
Rym: how do we actually get in that whole situation?

463
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,802
Scott: now you need to Have.

464
00:33:18,823 --> 00:33:22,460
Scott: we need a consumer protection law that forces their hand, right?

465
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:27,957
Scott: You must have a human being who can talk and will listen and knows what's up, etc, etc, right?

466
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:36,060
Scott: Yeah, some sort of remedy must exist and it currently does not and your life can just be fucked over for no reason, right?

467
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:45,043
Rym: unjustly, but anyway things Of the day.

468
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:45,865
Rym: so check this out.

469
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:58,024
Rym: This is a tweet thread with 16 tweets and each of these is an image from an illustrated hand scroll from the 1850s in Japan.

470
00:33:58,044 --> 00:34:06,436
Rym: that was seven meters long and it shows the entire process end-to-end of How sake was made in?

471
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:13,942
Rym: cowboy times in Japan Mmm, and it is annotated and it is Absolutely.

472
00:34:14,003 --> 00:34:14,484
Rym: Delightful.

473
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:18,072
Rym: This this is actually a fun journey to follow start to finish.

474
00:34:18,494 --> 00:34:29,020
Scott: This is sake made with great difficulty But also at a scale like it's funny because the the Japanese equivalent of like in America.

475
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,020
Rym: We've got the trope of the jug with three X's on it in Japan.

476
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:40,940
Rym: I feel like it's that big Like yellowish barrel looking thing that sake comes in with the writing on the side and the ropes around it same thing Yep.

477
00:34:41,543 --> 00:34:42,348
Scott: Yep, exactly.

478
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:44,297
Rym: That's just a jug with three X's on it.

479
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:45,605
Scott: Pretty much.

480
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:46,831
Rym: So what do you got?

481
00:34:47,556 --> 00:34:48,279
Scott: So this dude?

482
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:54,920
Scott: He decided, you know, he likes typewriters and you know, I kind of like the aesthetic of a typewriter.

483
00:34:55,021 --> 00:35:03,406
Scott: The problem is you sit down to use one for a few minutes and it's like, okay The keyboards actually not as nice as my mechanical keyboard Even though it's aesthetically cooler.

484
00:35:03,426 --> 00:35:08,804
Scott: and then as soon as you make a mistake in typing and you press backspace, you're like, oh fuck what you're not one.

485
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:09,106
Rym: not.

486
00:35:09,286 --> 00:35:17,798
Rym: even when I was like In elementary school our typewriter had a backspace that actually worked and would remove whiteout.

487
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:21,693
Scott: Yeah Well, it wasn't a white house at the X was the X kind.

488
00:35:22,215 --> 00:35:25,994
Rym: it wasn't white out But it was very similar to white out how it actually worked.

489
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:26,959
Rym: I don't want to get into it.

490
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:27,782
Rym: It's odd.

491
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:29,548
Rym: It's more complicated than you think.

492
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:33,202
Rym: the way backspace worked on electric typewriters is way different than you think It was.

493
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:34,329
Rym: that'll be my next thing of the day.

494
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:45,128
Scott: Anyway proceed sure but anyway, this guy hooks up his typewriter to his computer, right and He basically hooks up the terminal to the typewriter.

495
00:35:45,188 --> 00:35:53,484
Scott: So now when he types on the typewriter, it's typing on the paper but it's also sending those characters to the computer as Terminal input.

496
00:35:53,886 --> 00:36:01,433
Scott: and then when he presses enter and the terminal makes output The typewriter is printing the output as like it's a printer.

497
00:36:01,855 --> 00:36:02,517
Rym: that is.

498
00:36:02,557 --> 00:36:07,659
Rym: that is super cool Because that is kind of how it was to interact with terminals in the early days.

499
00:36:08,482 --> 00:36:13,980
Scott: Yeah, the only difference is that you know, you can if you type something LS it works great, right?

500
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:23,450
Scott: but it's if you want to open up a terminal app where it's actually redrawing that's just gonna or You know this print a whole page after you hit enter.

501
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:29,950
Scott: Yeah, you know it could become and it's also really slow and noisy obviously, but it's still pretty cool.

502
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,536
Scott: But you know, I encourage people to.

503
00:36:32,078 --> 00:36:33,262
Scott: it's all video series.

504
00:36:33,563 --> 00:36:37,335
Scott: watch as much of it as you feel But there's a charm to that.

505
00:36:37,977 --> 00:36:41,650
Scott: Yeah, but if you are interested in any of this you should Google.

506
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:51,550
Scott: There's plenty of resources telling you exactly how terminals TTY works And it's an important thing to know because I feel like even a lot of computer people these days.

507
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:57,223
Scott: They just click on terminal the application on their computer or whatever whatever they're using.

508
00:36:57,303 --> 00:37:05,730
Scott: putty I term like a gnome terminal Whatever right and they don't know actually what the hell's going on behind that thing.

509
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:09,409
Scott: And it's kind of important to know and really helpful to know.

510
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:17,102
Rym: Yep The history of computing is wrapped up in this one of the first things I ever did Connected before I even had access to the internet.

511
00:37:17,584 --> 00:37:31,170
Rym: I was able to basically Mess me and a guy were able to use terminals to mess with each other's computers directly Via a phone line that we just called each other on and we did some fun stuff with that.

512
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,079
Rym: That was like my introduction to networking mm-hmm.

513
00:37:35,451 --> 00:37:38,244
Rym: In the moment the GeekNights book club book is Binti.

514
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:39,630
Rym: It's a very short read.

515
00:37:39,851 --> 00:37:42,422
Rym: I don't think I we could probably do it on Thursday next week.

516
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:45,128
Scott: All right, you said that last Thursday We didn't do a Thursday show.

517
00:37:46,372 --> 00:37:47,157
Rym: Have you started yet?

518
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:47,921
Scott: I didn't I didn't.

519
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,430
Scott: I still haven't even read one page.

520
00:37:51,196 --> 00:37:53,027
Rym: Well, let me double check my travel schedule.

521
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:53,510
Rym: GeekNights.

522
00:37:53,771 --> 00:38:09,030
Rym: I'll warn you all now in the meta moment GeekNights is gonna get actually moderately disrupted in September because one I'm Emily and I are flying to Seattle to do a panel or two at PAX West And also I do have to do a work trip.

523
00:38:09,432 --> 00:38:13,389
Rym: I got to go to London and Frankfurt, so I'm gonna be gone for a couple weeks and bring back over it again.

524
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:14,475
Rym: Well, we'll see.

525
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:16,062
Rym: This is not going to a convention.

526
00:38:16,103 --> 00:38:17,570
Rym: This is just going to my offices there.

527
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:23,744
Rym: So I should be able to avoid pretty much all people and wear a mask and like it won't be like the conference I went to in London

528
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,968
Scott: Airplanes trouble, uh

529
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:32,670
Rym: Probably not because I can just wear a mask on the airplane and I'll be in business class pretty isolated from everyone.

530
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:34,589
Rym: I'm not not actually worried about that.

531
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:42,490
Rym: I am 100% sure I caught it at the conference when I was in London last time based on the timing Anyway.

532
00:38:43,773 --> 00:38:46,050
Rym: But also Emily and I are doing a long bike trip.

533
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:52,669
Rym: We're gonna bike from our apartment to Brockport, which is a little bit past Rochester, New York over the course of a week.

534
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,683
Rym: So Might be several weeks of no GeekNights as a result.

535
00:38:56,723 --> 00:38:58,310
Rym: Just gonna give you guys a heads up on that.

536
00:38:58,651 --> 00:39:06,450
Scott: that'll give me some time for things that start with the letter B like biking going to the beach and Building.

537
00:39:08,994 --> 00:39:11,363
Rym: Meanwhile, you're gonna get a lot of side content on that bike trip.

538
00:39:11,444 --> 00:39:19,695
Rym: One thing we do want to do is Record a little like progress thing every day of the journey because we're basically biking 500 miles.

539
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:22,049
Rym: over the course of a week Rym fell down three times.

540
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,855
Scott: today We got this yet another thing.

541
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:26,918
Scott: it starts with the bones.

542
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:28,142
Scott: what bones are remaining?

543
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:31,250
Rym: yep, how much dysentery did you Ford that River?

544
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,138
Scott: We're On a ferry right now.

545
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,629
Scott: good thing good thing we got money.

546
00:39:39,352 --> 00:39:40,802
Rym: So, yeah, that's all the meta I got.

547
00:39:40,822 --> 00:39:41,950
Rym: I guess we can dive right into it.

548
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,556
Rym: Let's talk about smartphones cuz.

549
00:39:43,736 --> 00:39:49,275
Scott: uh one Apple is coming up right now is like the peak Smartphone season right.

550
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:54,670
Scott: the pixels 6a just came out which is the like the second tier pixel phone, right?

551
00:39:56,233 --> 00:39:56,575
Scott: I think it.

552
00:39:56,636 --> 00:39:57,704
Scott: I think 6a right?

553
00:39:57,925 --> 00:39:58,449
Scott: I think I'm right.

554
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:00,457
Scott: And then the iPhone.

555
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:00,939
Scott: right.

556
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:02,464
Scott: early September is when they're gonna.

557
00:40:02,665 --> 00:40:07,357
Scott: Apple is gonna have like the biggest Announcements right you've ever seen right?

558
00:40:07,397 --> 00:40:08,279
Scott: It's like we always know.

559
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:11,970
Scott: early September is the announcement time, but we got new phones.

560
00:40:12,231 --> 00:40:14,080
Scott: There's gonna be new Apple watch for sure.

561
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:14,322
Scott: Right?

562
00:40:14,362 --> 00:40:15,910
Scott: Those are those are guaranteed, right?

563
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:24,449
Scott: I'm hoping for new AirPods Pro 2. if they don't make those I won't buy them But I think they hopefully they'll come soon.

564
00:40:25,011 --> 00:40:30,950
Scott: There's gonna be some new iPad action and there might be some other Macs that don't have m2 chips in them yet.

565
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,338
Scott: We'll get upgraded to m2 chips.

566
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:33,546
Scott: There's gonna be a lot of Apple shit.

567
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:41,530
Scott: All right Regardless it is new phone season, especially going to the holiday season back-to-school season, right?

568
00:40:42,131 --> 00:40:46,070
Scott: Even if new phones weren't coming out now is the time when people are buying new phones.

569
00:40:47,331 --> 00:41:00,259
Scott: So whether you are buying a brand new phone, you never had one before cuz you're punk kid Or just weren't wealthy before or who knows Or you're replacing a phone, right?

570
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:04,065
Scott: We're gonna give a bunch of tips on what the hell you should do Yep.

571
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:11,350
Rym: So number one the most important thing is I mean, I'm not gonna say do you need a smartphone?

572
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,218
Rym: What are you gonna use it for like that high level?

573
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:18,670
Rym: because I would argue that everyone who can afford a smartphone Should probably have a smartphone.

574
00:41:19,713 --> 00:41:23,895
Scott: Part of the world where there is service for the smartphone Yeah, it it's.

575
00:41:24,196 --> 00:41:26,303
Scott: probably it's beneficial for you to have it.

576
00:41:26,825 --> 00:41:32,990
Rym: So the real question is What other devices do you have or expect to have?

577
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:37,287
Rym: So that you can think about where and how that smartphone fixed it fits into your life.

578
00:41:37,347 --> 00:41:41,141
Rym: case in point I have a laptop and a workstation.

579
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:50,070
Rym: So for me a smartphone is Primarily that my access to data when I'm traveling or not near those other devices.

580
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:53,735
Rym: So as a result, I got that Possible phone.

581
00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:57,910
Rym: Yeah, this is for pooping and biking and like being out in the street.

582
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:09,440
Rym: I got something that'll fit in my pocket and I really only use it when I'm away from my real devices and that Really colors what I care about in a smartphone.

583
00:42:09,721 --> 00:42:21,710
Rym: compared to someone who say you don't have a home computer You don't have a laptop Do you want a smartphone that is also your primary device for literally everything or do you want a smartphone and separate?

584
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:25,360
Scott: It's a perfectly legitimate choice given the prices of these smartphones these days.

585
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,183
Rym: It absolutely is.

586
00:42:26,424 --> 00:42:28,470
Rym: or do you want a small fart smartphone?

587
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:36,070
Rym: I almost said fart phone and And a tablet because a tablet is a very different thing from a smartphone.

588
00:42:36,613 --> 00:42:39,670
Rym: But you have to decide what kind of life do you live?

589
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,890
Rym: Some people are best off with a big smartphone.

590
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:46,910
Rym: Some people are best off with a tiny smartphone and a big-ass tablet.

591
00:42:47,677 --> 00:42:51,701
Scott: And some people are off with a high-end Smartphone the newest most powerful one.

592
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:58,223
Scott: some people are better off with like, you know You can get a lower-end model right or a cheaper model right or you know older one.

593
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:00,409
Scott: They still sell, you know iPhone what you know.

594
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:02,575
Scott: You can get the like.

595
00:43:02,595 --> 00:43:07,815
Scott: I just said the 6a came out which is not the most powerful Pixel phone, right?

596
00:43:08,317 --> 00:43:11,950
Scott: Yeah, you can get an iPhone 11. still you can get the iPhone SE, right?

597
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:15,190
Scott: There's a new iPhone SE in fact new ish right you can get one of those.

598
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:17,358
Scott: It's like that might be good enough for you.

599
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,884
Scott: Yeah, you know, you might not need to get.

600
00:43:19,145 --> 00:43:20,630
Scott: you definitely know iPhone 13.

601
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,073
Scott: It's like.

602
00:43:21,536 --> 00:43:23,710
Scott: yeah, that's probably just fine for just about anyone.

603
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,661
Scott: The iPhone 13 Pro is kind of just a ridiculous thing.

604
00:43:26,861 --> 00:43:29,832
Scott: Even if that's your only computing device It's like.

605
00:43:30,596 --> 00:43:33,790
Scott: it's not that much better than iPhone 13 except for the cameras.

606
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:41,299
Scott: Like though here's an example somehow are making really high quality photos and videos But you don't have another camera.

607
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,150
Scott: then the iPhone 13 Pro makes sense.

608
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,655
Scott: Otherwise, it doesn't another use case.

609
00:43:44,695 --> 00:43:53,649
Rym: if you're doing photogrammetry and you want to use that lidar and you want to do scan scans Of 3d games that is something that there's really no other cheap device that's gonna do it.

610
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,940
Rym: That is such a win for you to buy that specific file.

611
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,064
Scott: But how many people is that?

612
00:43:58,164 --> 00:43:59,247
Scott: Almost nobody exactly.

613
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:03,730
Rym: So If you're the kind of person who's got something weird like that going on.

614
00:44:04,272 --> 00:44:05,297
Rym: You don't need our advice.

615
00:44:05,317 --> 00:44:11,540
Rym: I assume you already have a very clear plan of what kind of devices you need But for most people it doesn't really matter that much.

616
00:44:11,861 --> 00:44:14,790
Rym: So it really comes down to do you want a laptop?

617
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:17,941
Rym: Do you want a phone plus other devices or just a phone?

618
00:44:18,463 --> 00:44:27,285
Rym: because if you want just a phone I actually would say you probably want to get a bigger phone and It's pretty much 50/50 Android or iPhone.

619
00:44:27,627 --> 00:44:34,710
Scott: if you're in there I think you know, the Android or iPhone thing is really going to depend on what else is going on in your life, right?

620
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:42,370
Rym: So do you already have one of the two and a lot of apps and things you have paid for on that device?

621
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,254
Scott: Yeah, just stick with it.

622
00:44:44,294 --> 00:44:45,097
Scott: You'll stick with what.

623
00:44:45,137 --> 00:44:57,961
Scott: if you're already on one, you know, it's like, you know You could argue all day about which one's better than the other but if you're already in one of them It's like that one's probably better for you Unless you're so barely invested in it.

624
00:44:58,001 --> 00:44:59,890
Scott: that switch at your switching cost is low.

625
00:45:00,371 --> 00:45:02,457
Rym: I made the switch from Android to iPhone.

626
00:45:02,497 --> 00:45:05,666
Rym: if you know what the switching cost kind of high like it's not.

627
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:20,788
Rym: it kind of sucks To switch from the Google Android ecosystem to the iPhone ecosystem or vice versa Like if you're already in one and you don't have a specific complaint or a specific need Don't switch like only switch if you have a good reason to Yep.

628
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,260
Scott: But yeah, it's like what do you use for?

629
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,527
Scott: do you have email already?

630
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:25,030
Scott: Right?

631
00:45:25,211 --> 00:45:30,970
Scott: It's like if you already got email and it's Gmail you might want to go the Google way, right?

632
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,841
Scott: Yeah, if you're some kid who's never had a phone before right?

633
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:36,070
Scott: It's like well, you don't have an email either way.

634
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,077
Scott: Well, what do your parents have?

635
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,466
Scott: What do your friends have?

636
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:39,010
Scott: Right?

637
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:44,990
Scott: You know if you if your friends are all a messaging get iPhone so you can I message with them in this time with them.

638
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:49,270
Scott: If your friends, you know if your parents have Google accounts, right?

639
00:45:49,591 --> 00:45:55,080
Scott: It's like, you know Your dad's got an Android phone or your guardian whoever has Android phone get an Android phone.

640
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,930
Scott: It'll be more compatible with what they have.

641
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:58,800
Scott: if your parents have iPhones, right?

642
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,903
Scott: You can get an iPhone and I watch and now they can do that shit where they you know They can find you.

643
00:46:02,943 --> 00:46:06,500
Scott: if you get lost in the woods because I buy an I have Apple watch or die.

644
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:08,350
Scott: This is Apple's marketing still.

645
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,139
Scott: Yeah, your children will die.

646
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:15,976
Rym: So one thing I would say and I actually I have very prescriptive advice.

647
00:46:15,996 --> 00:46:39,519
Rym: I don't think Scott will disagree If now this might change soon because there are new Android watches like Android were things coming and there are apparently some big changes, but if you want a smart watch I Would say go Apple because the Apple watch is perfectly fine And the best Android watch I have ever used is kind of shit.

648
00:46:40,402 --> 00:46:41,826
Scott: Yes, there's if there's.

649
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:50,839
Scott: if you really need the smartwatch as a part of your life for reasons You really just got to go the Apple way the you know.

650
00:46:52,062 --> 00:47:01,257
Rym: Even back when I was deep in the Android ecosystem, and it was not considering switching I was very vocal about the fact that every app every Android watch is absolute garbage.

651
00:47:01,297 --> 00:47:02,320
Rym: There are no good ones.

652
00:47:02,643 --> 00:47:08,456
Rym: They just there are so many Terrible annoyances with them and the Apple watches.

653
00:47:08,516 --> 00:47:09,220
Rym: by comparison.

654
00:47:10,023 --> 00:47:10,364
Rym: They just.

655
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:18,175
Rym: they have intelligent defaults and they kind of just work in a way that no Android Accessory is capable of if you don't care about the watches.

656
00:47:18,215 --> 00:47:19,200
Rym: This does not apply to you.

657
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:25,313
Rym: But if you care about a watch and you want a smartwatch in my opinion There is no answer but an Apple watch.

658
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:28,391
Rym: and if you want an Apple watch There is no answer but an Apple phone.

659
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:29,819
Rym: the choice is made for you.

660
00:47:30,241 --> 00:47:31,729
Rym: That is the only factor that matters.

661
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:33,719
Scott: the benefits of the watch.

662
00:47:34,423 --> 00:47:41,893
Scott: If you're not sure if you want one or not, right is obviously the you know Their major selling point for all the watches not just the Apple ones.

663
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:42,254
Scott: Is that?

664
00:47:42,675 --> 00:47:44,000
Scott: oh, we'll prevent you from dying.

665
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,146
Scott: We'll detect if your heart is going crazy.

666
00:47:46,588 --> 00:47:50,639
Scott: It's like, you know that you may believe that it's partially true, right?

667
00:47:51,681 --> 00:47:53,560
Rym: The o2 monitors, they're great.

668
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,343
Scott: Yeah, the.

669
00:47:55,443 --> 00:47:58,634
Scott: the real benefits of the watch is that number one.

670
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:09,220
Scott: if you have the LTE watch Which is gonna cost you a little bit every month You can actually go and leave your phone behind which is great if you're running or swimming or anything of that nature.

671
00:48:09,642 --> 00:48:19,059
Scott: Right, you could just go with the watch only and you won't miss an important emergency phone call Or anything like that and you don't have to carry a phone around no matter how small even without the LTE.

672
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:20,565
Rym: Sometimes I often run.

673
00:48:20,585 --> 00:48:21,630
Rym: I don't even carry my phone.

674
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,659
Rym: I just have my watch even without the LTE.

675
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,506
Rym: I guess the 5g.

676
00:48:25,566 --> 00:48:29,060
Rym: now it still works because they can still do things like Strava.

677
00:48:29,241 --> 00:48:31,900
Rym: It just doesn't have the communication aspects, right?

678
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,294
Scott: But I mean if someone were to make an emergency phone call you wouldn't yeah, I wouldn't get.

679
00:48:35,435 --> 00:48:36,700
Scott: there was Wi-Fi or something.

680
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:37,910
Scott: You just happen to be here.

681
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:43,615
Rym: but like around the apartment I guess where my watch and it'll take I don't actually have to have my phone on me.

682
00:48:43,695 --> 00:48:44,357
Rym: in the apartment.

683
00:48:44,718 --> 00:48:47,110
Rym: my watch Which just has Wi-Fi will buzz.

684
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,839
Rym: I could even take the call on it if I need to.

685
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:57,748
Scott: yeah, the things I use on my watch the most often are a Notifications show up on the watch so I don't have to get my phone out of my pocket Which my watch is.

686
00:48:57,788 --> 00:49:03,154
Scott: how I don't be real Right, and then that's how I don't have to turn the phone on.

687
00:49:03,194 --> 00:49:09,660
Scott: the phone's battery lasts longer Of the watch right now, they don't have to use the phone as much to Strava.

688
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:13,351
Rym: I use Strava and the heart rate meter and exercise like that is.

689
00:49:13,853 --> 00:49:16,040
Rym: that is my primary workflow on my watch.

690
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:20,340
Scott: I did until I got the bike computer and now I use that instead.

691
00:49:20,521 --> 00:49:24,400
Scott: Yeah, I mean most of my sports are if I was running I would use Strava on the watch.

692
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:25,344
Rym: I mean I do.

693
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:26,890
Rym: most of what I do is skiing.

694
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:27,473
Rym: running.

695
00:49:27,533 --> 00:49:32,612
Rym: biking is actually a secondary concern But also at this point I don't even bother with the bike computer.

696
00:49:32,672 --> 00:49:35,679
Rym: my phone and watch handle everything I could ever need me.

697
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:39,884
Scott: My my computer is also a GPS and whatnot.

698
00:49:39,984 --> 00:49:45,524
Scott: Anyway, so the other thing the watch does is Payments, right?

699
00:49:45,705 --> 00:49:49,035
Scott: So it's like yeah, you can do is Apple pay or Android pay with the phone.

700
00:49:49,075 --> 00:49:50,540
Rym: Good fucking luck.

701
00:49:50,581 --> 00:49:51,879
Rym: Do you know how many times?

702
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,118
Rym: Android at pay on a watch was fucky or didn't work.

703
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:56,440
Rym: Right?

704
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,222
Rym: Why right?

705
00:49:57,242 --> 00:49:57,623
Rym: or like it?

706
00:49:57,704 --> 00:50:06,800
Scott: yet to reauthenticate the Apple payment on the watch just works Yep, so it's like pay, you know, it's like you think oh I get to take my phone out and use the Apple pay.

707
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:07,699
Scott: Yeah, that works great.

708
00:50:08,122 --> 00:50:11,540
Scott: But Apple pay on the watch is just like even faster.

709
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,180
Rym: It is literally just you double tap a button and just hold it up to whatever and everything just works.

710
00:50:16,261 --> 00:50:23,920
Scott: It just pays instantly you're done Yeah, so if you're you know, pretty much every almost every business I interact, you know where it doesn't work sit down restaurants.

711
00:50:24,782 --> 00:50:25,625
Rym: They need a credit card.

712
00:50:25,725 --> 00:50:26,869
Rym: You can't even so lately.

713
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:28,094
Scott: There's a I big.

714
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:31,004
Scott: in just the past month I've experienced this.

715
00:50:31,505 --> 00:50:36,260
Scott: there are more and more sit-down restaurants using some payment system where they bring you the receipt.

716
00:50:36,689 --> 00:50:41,440
Scott: Oh, yeah He has the receipt has a QR code and you you can't use the watch for this.

717
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:47,820
Scott: Obviously you photo the QR code with the phone and then you pay with Apple pay or Android pay or whatever.

718
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:49,392
Scott: The payment thing is on your phone.

719
00:50:49,472 --> 00:50:53,179
Scott: Yeah, and then you just leave You don't have to wait.

720
00:50:53,561 --> 00:51:03,480
Rym: I have seen more and more places doing the European style like just in the last couple months as well where they bring the POS right to the table and you pay right there and I can just scan my watch at the thing that they hold out for it all.

721
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,048
Scott: Just that that happens occasionally outside of the u.s.

722
00:51:06,088 --> 00:51:09,859
Rym: That's the default but the u.s You know, we're archaic in a lot of ways.

723
00:51:09,939 --> 00:51:15,580
Scott: So Alright, so if you get a new phone, you've never had a phone before right?

724
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,272
Scott: What I would recommend you do is get an account right.

725
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:25,191
Scott: assuming you never had a phone before it means like you don't have an Email you don't have you know anything right.

726
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:27,260
Scott: get accounts, right?

727
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,965
Scott: That match the phone.

728
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:33,056
Scott: if you have an iPhone just use the iCloud email the right.

729
00:51:33,417 --> 00:51:34,380
Scott: use all this stuff, right?

730
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:40,540
Scott: If you have a Google Android phone then get you know Gmail right a new account.

731
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:47,079
Rym: I would say if you have a very mixed ecosystem that already exists, but somehow are not using a phone.

732
00:51:48,121 --> 00:51:56,580
Rym: Android is probably your best just default bet because Generally all the random stuff that isn't Apple all kind of just works there.

733
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,960
Rym: Well, but Apple does like to guide you toward using the Apple stuff.

734
00:52:00,341 --> 00:52:08,438
Scott: So if you do but the Google Google has apps for a Google and Microsoft both have apps for pretty much everything on iPhone It'll all work just fine.

735
00:52:08,842 --> 00:52:10,580
Rym: Mostly you have to do some extra configuration.

736
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:19,634
Rym: Like I had to do some fuckery to make sure all my calendar stuff on all my Apple biz Defaults to updating my Google Calendar and not the Apple like built in.

737
00:52:19,895 --> 00:52:25,340
Scott: Oh, oh see I think I just installed the Google Calendar app and I never used the Apple Calendar app.

738
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:27,929
Rym: But like I use a reminder I was like, hey set a reminder.

739
00:52:27,989 --> 00:52:38,400
Rym: like I every now and then I use some automation or some Non-calendar function and I wanted to make a calendar invite and before I configured it it would default to the Apple calendar.

740
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,198
Scott: Oh, yeah, I just never use any of that.

741
00:52:41,582 --> 00:52:50,938
Rym: I'm saying that's a. if you have a bunch of non Apple stuff You will have to go configure a bunch of things and you're not gonna get all of them right away.

742
00:52:51,078 --> 00:52:56,878
Scott: on your app You tell Siri to like make a calendar event and you only have Google Calendar and it's not set up.

743
00:52:56,978 --> 00:53:07,900
Rym: and like yeah It might be a head but on Android whatever random collection of bullshit you use Android is really good about defaulting to whatever you tell it to and not having edge cases like that.

744
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,293
Scott: Yep, check would you know, if you use any apps clearly use something.

745
00:53:12,313 --> 00:53:13,436
Scott: cuz you listen to a podcast.

746
00:53:13,537 --> 00:53:18,020
Rym: Yeah I want to know who is who will ever hear the words?

747
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,940
Rym: We're saying who does not already have a smartphone or at least an email account.

748
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,062
Scott: Right.

749
00:53:23,082 --> 00:53:27,113
Rym: It's like if you exist contact us, however, it is you contact people.

750
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:32,952
Rym: I really want to talk to you like That's a pigeon or Raven's gonna show up at your house.

751
00:53:33,032 --> 00:53:38,928
Scott: Like I don't know But you get the account that goes with the phone.

752
00:53:38,968 --> 00:53:46,920
Scott: you get right and try and what I see a lot of people what they Do is when they get the when they get a phone is like oh what apps should I install?

753
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,566
Rym: Never never never go down that road.

754
00:53:48,606 --> 00:53:50,934
Rym: That is that that path leads you to misery.

755
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:52,860
Scott: do not ask that question.

756
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:54,800
Scott: What apps should you install instead?

757
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:03,469
Scott: Just start using start using the phone and living your life right with the phone without Putting any extra apps on there, right.

758
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:11,914
Scott: and then whenever you need to do something Right try to do it with the phone as it is, right?

759
00:54:12,295 --> 00:54:13,900
Scott: So it's like oh I need directions.

760
00:54:14,081 --> 00:54:16,651
Scott: Well, I guess that would be the one I was about to say.

761
00:54:16,731 --> 00:54:18,096
Rym: I was gonna do a whole salary.

762
00:54:18,137 --> 00:54:20,560
Scott: the one exception Is he even on the Apple phone?

763
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:23,891
Rym: You should use Google Maps no matter what device you use anywhere on earth.

764
00:54:24,292 --> 00:54:26,439
Rym: use Google Maps and do not use any other maps.

765
00:54:26,781 --> 00:54:29,654
Scott: Fuck at least as of as of August 2022, actually, you know, yes.

766
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:36,156
Scott: And for the other the other app the other maps are catching up to Google Maps.

767
00:54:36,176 --> 00:54:43,960
Scott: They're just still not there yet Which they are still significantly behind in key areas as of today.

768
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,787
Scott: They are very behind but they are.

769
00:54:45,887 --> 00:54:49,500
Scott: Google Maps is progressing more slowly and they're progressing more quickly.

770
00:54:49,961 --> 00:54:56,360
Scott: So in a few years time, it could change but as I now doubt it, but we'll see it's possible.

771
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,214
Scott: But as of now use Google Google Maps to be the only thing.

772
00:55:00,816 --> 00:55:01,740
Scott: don't use the Apple Mac.

773
00:55:02,363 --> 00:55:14,980
Rym: It's like you live in San Francisco, then it might be okay Especially if you use Google Maps for things like biking directions like stuff That isn't just looking at what restaurants are nearby or like getting a car direction.

774
00:55:15,401 --> 00:55:17,685
Rym: I also don't super trust the Apple car directions.

775
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:24,933
Rym: I have compared them before, you know on trips and Apple does not seem to be aware of traffic in a way that Google is.

776
00:55:25,054 --> 00:55:29,099
Rym: but anyway Google bought ways And ways had it shit together.

777
00:55:29,923 --> 00:55:38,059
Scott: Anyway, but yeah for everything besides directions if you need to do something Just you try to use the apps that are already on the phone to do that thing.

778
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:42,420
Rym: Well, I guess I use Google keep and I continue to use it when I migrated to iPhone.

779
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,167
Scott: However, I also use Google key.

780
00:55:44,227 --> 00:55:51,379
Rym: if I were not already using Google keep when I made the switch I would probably just use like the Apple reminders and that would be it.

781
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:54,029
Scott: No, the Apple notes also an Apple notice.

782
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,340
Scott: keep is sort of both of those in one exactly.

783
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,585
Rym: But I'm already using keep.

784
00:55:57,605 --> 00:55:59,271
Rym: but guess what keepers is my asks.

785
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:00,817
Scott: I guess is more like the reminders.

786
00:56:00,917 --> 00:56:05,389
Rym: Yeah Well, my worry is keep and tell.

787
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:09,040
Rym: again the problem with Google is all their shit overlaps in weird ways.

788
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:17,599
Rym: So absolutely keep is in a Venn diagram with like two other Google things that themselves are in a Venn diagram With a bunch of stuff on iPhone.

789
00:56:18,487 --> 00:56:24,720
Rym: So Scott's advice is best If you don't already have a way that you do this that you like that works.

790
00:56:25,242 --> 00:56:30,240
Rym: Just do whatever the phone makes easiest and it'll probably be the best option All right.

791
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:36,040
Scott: And then when you get into a situation where you want to do something with the phone you have a need that is not fulfilled.

792
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:39,689
Scott: Then go find an app that does that thing.

793
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:42,597
Rym: and my specific advice there look for an.

794
00:56:42,617 --> 00:56:50,592
Rym: I hate to say this Look for an app that costs money And avoid apps that are free with ads just generally.

795
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:52,820
Scott: well avoid anyone with ads for sure.

796
00:56:52,981 --> 00:56:55,355
Scott: Sometimes there will be a one that's just free free.

797
00:56:55,536 --> 00:56:56,300
Scott: That's truly free.

798
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:08,921
Scott: That's good, but you know spend your time investigating them trying them out in seeing you know Which app is gonna be the best one that meets this need that you don't have that is not fulfilled by the default apps on The phone.

799
00:57:09,022 --> 00:57:22,400
Scott: now there's a lot of just about everybody has a phone full of apps that they don't even use Right 99% of the time just taking up space Invading their privacy eating up the battery.

800
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:28,380
Rym: There's a shit ton of apps full of malware on the Android store that were only recently taken down.

801
00:57:28,681 --> 00:57:31,190
Rym: There's also the thing we're like tick tock just straight up.

802
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:34,160
Rym: can key log you if you open its in-app browser?

803
00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:38,531
Scott: Yep, it's like you really do not want to use an app.

804
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:41,340
Scott: if you're not using the app, right?

805
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,262
Scott: Keep it minimal.

806
00:57:42,343 --> 00:57:57,180
Scott: All right as much as you possibly can and if you've got a new phone, it's easiest to do So if you already have an iPhone and you're buying a new iPhone Oh, hey, there's one last thing which I guess also applies if you're switching phones.

807
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,285
Scott: This applies to everybody.

808
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:01,420
Scott: is that whenever you get a new device, right?

809
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:07,625
Scott: especially if it's you've never had one before go to the settings menu and Go through.

810
00:58:07,847 --> 00:58:11,122
Scott: just look at every single Setting.

811
00:58:11,202 --> 00:58:16,880
Scott: go to every single settings menu from the top down and look at every setting.

812
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:19,730
Rym: Don't necessarily change anything just understand.

813
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:33,155
Scott: Oh, no, not to change anything, but you should read every setting understand what that setting means and If you're not like a hundred percent sure that you want to change the setting like you're absolutely want to change it Don't change it.

814
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:41,242
Scott: But just go through every setting completely understand all of them and just know and remember which ones Exist.

815
00:58:41,663 --> 00:58:58,740
Scott: and then as you use the phone you might come across a frustrating thing and you'll remember there was a setting for that Yeah, and then you'll change the setting to you know to realize your preference, you know, it doesn't align with it Yeah, but a lot of people just never go into their settings never change them never do anything.

816
00:58:59,322 --> 00:59:11,750
Scott: Anytime I get a new phone anytime there's an OS update anytime that anything, you know, even on computers I go to the settings and I look through every possible setting and I make sure that they are set correctly.

817
00:59:11,891 --> 00:59:17,817
Scott: Usually it's rare that I change something but You know, that's how it's very important to just know what's in there.

818
00:59:18,158 --> 00:59:32,159
Rym: Yep corollary to that Don't hyper customize everything right away until you've used whatever the device is enough to get a sense of how it works and what you like and what you don't like.

819
00:59:32,179 --> 00:59:44,994
Rym: a lot of nerds in particular like to customize everything before they even try to use the thing and That is often a way to Increasingly get yourself into weird situations like oh my shit.

820
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,217
Scott: This is thing is broken.

821
00:59:46,238 --> 00:59:48,460
Scott: It's not working Yes, cuz you messed with it a whole bunch.

822
00:59:49,941 --> 00:59:57,062
Rym: So in terms of the hardware itself, if you've got bad eyesight and like it's a problem get a bigger phone Sure.

823
00:59:57,604 --> 01:00:00,839
Rym: I thought I can increase the font size and you should yep.

824
01:00:00,919 --> 01:00:04,500
Rym: granted I prefer tiny phones any fonts, but I can see really well.

825
01:00:04,681 --> 01:00:05,645
Rym: So that's something I have.

826
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,513
Scott: the I mean I can see really well.

827
01:00:07,654 --> 01:00:09,100
Scott: and I'm turning up the font size.

828
01:00:09,221 --> 01:00:12,140
Scott: Anyway, it's like I can read the small font size, right?

829
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,908
Scott: Just like I can read the bottom of the eye chart.

830
01:00:13,968 --> 01:00:14,169
Scott: right.

831
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:18,820
Scott: even someone with 20/20 perfect vision They can read the bottom of the eye chart, but you know what?

832
01:00:19,181 --> 01:00:22,740
Scott: It's still easier to read a giant e that it is - at the top.

833
01:00:24,101 --> 01:00:29,119
Rym: I've actually I've turned the font sizes way down on my iPhone just to fit more information on there.

834
01:00:30,264 --> 01:00:31,592
Scott: Yeah, I mean I don't have problems.

835
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:33,060
Rym: girl I watch has like that's high.

836
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:36,520
Rym: It's just like a full web browser and tiny text on there and I could read it just fine.

837
01:00:37,265 --> 01:00:37,870
Scott: I mean I can.

838
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:41,067
Rym: I can read it on the wall Like I prefer it that way.

839
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:45,424
Rym: I like small fonts and dense text on all my devices That's right.

840
01:00:45,464 --> 01:00:47,270
Scott: Well your rims rims are weird.

841
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:52,371
Scott: Oh does everything weird, but it's like make the font size Whatever is comfortable for your eyeball, right?

842
01:00:53,014 --> 01:01:02,659
Rym: Yeah, yeah, but If you care about battery life You're gonna have to either get a big phone or an expensive phone.

843
01:01:03,582 --> 01:01:08,219
Rym: Yep, phone small that aren't very expensive will not have long battery life.

844
01:01:09,881 --> 01:01:20,134
Scott: No, the number one thing that kills battery life is you know apps that are running all the time doing bullshit, right and Screens that are big and bright and are on too much right?

845
01:01:20,155 --> 01:01:21,300
Scott: It's like watching videos.

846
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,367
Scott: The screen is on.

847
01:01:22,709 --> 01:01:24,360
Scott: it's bright because you're watching something.

848
01:01:24,883 --> 01:01:25,708
Scott: It's just not.

849
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,720
Scott: the screen is what's eating your battery.

850
01:01:28,182 --> 01:01:31,212
Scott: So that's why the watch saves so much battery.

851
01:01:31,252 --> 01:01:33,500
Scott: because you're turning the screen on less, right?

852
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,624
Scott: The phone is in your pocket.

853
01:01:34,965 --> 01:01:36,029
Scott: The screen is not on.

854
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:38,559
Scott: the battery is is barely draining, right?

855
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,746
Scott: You know big phones.

856
01:01:40,807 --> 01:01:43,000
Scott: they got a bigger screen, but they also got a bigger battery.

857
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:49,420
Scott: So that sort of evens out the deal there, but you can also turn the brightness down, right?

858
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:54,131
Scott: It's like if it's night, you know You don't need that much brightness to be able to see what's on the phone.

859
01:01:54,452 --> 01:01:56,400
Scott: You know, there's some usually an auto brightness setting.

860
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:00,052
Scott: You should enable that but also occasionally manually adjust it.

861
01:02:00,293 --> 01:02:02,280
Scott: if it's too bright turn it down, right?

862
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,351
Scott: You should only really need to do high brightness like if you're using your phone in the Sun or something like.

863
01:02:06,391 --> 01:02:09,945
Rym: yeah, if you use an Android device get whatever battery.

864
01:02:10,005 --> 01:02:13,537
Rym: if you're using an iPhone honestly get that Apple magnetic battery.

865
01:02:13,657 --> 01:02:17,268
Scott: that is well So the Apple I learned recently.

866
01:02:17,388 --> 01:02:19,275
Scott: I bought the Apple mag safe battery.

867
01:02:19,475 --> 01:02:20,138
Scott: I'm happy with it.

868
01:02:20,198 --> 01:02:20,760
Scott: It's very nice.

869
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:25,073
Scott: I love that thing but it actually doesn't have that much capacity.

870
01:02:25,093 --> 01:02:27,220
Rym: No, it's like what two-thirds of a charge?

871
01:02:27,902 --> 01:02:30,249
Scott: Yeah, well, it's more than that, but it's the.

872
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,780
Scott: I only bought it because it was like the first one, right?

873
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,559
Scott: It was like there weren't any other competitors.

874
01:02:36,161 --> 01:02:43,040
Scott: Anchor now has a mag safe battery That is vastly higher capacity than the official thing is.

875
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:47,620
Rym: I don't think I need that because my current phone with no battery will make it all day doing pretty much anything.

876
01:02:47,962 --> 01:02:51,981
Rym: That battery is only for weird situations or something Like.

877
01:02:52,443 --> 01:02:56,540
Rym: I am hiking literally 20 miles over the course of an entire day and I want to stop.

878
01:02:56,841 --> 01:02:57,886
Scott: That's basically what I do too.

879
01:02:57,947 --> 01:03:04,860
Scott: It's like if most days my phone is in my house I can plug it in to charge it whenever I don't need to attach a battery to it.

880
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:13,371
Scott: Yeah, but if I'm going out somewhere for a long extended period of the day I'm not gonna have an opportunity to charge right?

881
01:03:13,391 --> 01:03:14,575
Scott: am I going to a convention?

882
01:03:14,615 --> 01:03:18,387
Scott: I'm going on a bike ride I'm going to a party right?

883
01:03:18,488 --> 01:03:18,829
Scott: It's like.

884
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:22,520
Scott: then I got I grabbed the battery and I attach it to the phone.

885
01:03:23,561 --> 01:03:26,232
Scott: So I know for sure that I'm not gonna run out of power.

886
01:03:26,312 --> 01:03:28,340
Scott: I probably still won't run out of power without the battery.

887
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:33,416
Scott: It's just a guarantee like there's no way I'm gonna run out of battery, which is very important.

888
01:03:33,757 --> 01:03:40,740
Rym: Mm-hmm But for anything super serious like trips, I usually just have an external heavy battery that I plug in via cable.

889
01:03:41,163 --> 01:03:41,526
Rym: But that's cuz.

890
01:03:41,566 --> 01:03:43,439
Rym: I'm not using it while I'm like walking around.

891
01:03:44,042 --> 01:03:49,080
Scott: That would be if you're like in a multi-day scenario right where you were not going to have access to power camping.

892
01:03:49,222 --> 01:03:50,013
Scott: Yeah, you know.

893
01:03:51,381 --> 01:03:55,460
Scott: Anyway, so the other phone accessory that a lot of people get are cases.

894
01:03:55,782 --> 01:04:01,019
Rym: I was about to say you have to be you have to be introspective You have to look at your own life.

895
01:04:01,481 --> 01:04:06,860
Rym: If you're up if you're replacing an existing phone look at that phone and use it as an example.

896
01:04:07,403 --> 01:04:10,139
Rym: Are you the kind of person who destroys your phones?

897
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,025
Rym: Routinely?

898
01:04:12,046 --> 01:04:13,738
Rym: or are you the kind of person who does not?

899
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:18,131
Rym: and Honestly, if you can get away with it, I'd advise using no case whatsoever.

900
01:04:18,472 --> 01:04:20,680
Rym: It's really pleasant to use a phone naked.

901
01:04:20,842 --> 01:04:21,739
Rym: They're designed for that.

902
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:31,460
Rym: However, if you have a history or you believe that you are the kind of person who is gonna drop your phone a bunch And you taste on it because that is a very expensive piece of hardware.

903
01:04:32,081 --> 01:04:34,730
Scott: Well, I'd say before you put the case on the phone.

904
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:37,780
Scott: I would say you should look at yourself, right?

905
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:39,695
Scott: It's you can change yourself.

906
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:45,660
Rym: I Am already getting past the point of I don't think the people who break phones routinely can change that about themselves.

907
01:04:46,703 --> 01:04:54,914
Scott: It may be the case, but if it is possible, right, you know, at least in my life I always seek to change myself before I will change.

908
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:56,460
Scott: Let's try to change the world.

909
01:04:56,641 --> 01:05:00,239
Rym: I have never put my phones in cases in my entire life and I've never regretted it.

910
01:05:00,903 --> 01:05:04,460
Scott: I did when I you know got like iPhone 3g like way back in the day.

911
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:05,846
Rym: I think by.

912
01:05:05,946 --> 01:05:12,335
Scott: I think by the time the iPhone before the iPhone 3g was done I had taken the case off and I don't think any other iPhone.

913
01:05:12,356 --> 01:05:13,200
Scott: I had got a case.

914
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,979
Scott: Yeah, and I only broke a phone once when I fought my bike.

915
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:22,644
Rym: So when I fell off my bike, you know in the injury where I had to take a picture of my fell off on my own Damn self.

916
01:05:22,825 --> 01:05:23,066
Scott: I didn't.

917
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:25,080
Scott: nothing else caused me to follow just my own self.

918
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,275
Rym: No, my my fall over was a pothole that I was too slow to react to.

919
01:05:30,596 --> 01:05:33,132
Scott: but I was just like standing there And I fell over sideways.

920
01:05:33,334 --> 01:05:40,220
Scott: Oh, no Everybody was in my bag And when I got to work, I took the phone out of the bag and it was broken.

921
01:05:40,581 --> 01:05:45,280
Rym: But one thing I will say is that it's about all phones, but especially iPhones.

922
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,499
Rym: But there are like Sony Android phones are similar in this boat.

923
01:05:49,523 --> 01:05:54,620
Rym: They are way more durable in the year 2022 than you probably realize.

924
01:05:55,182 --> 01:05:59,135
Rym: Phone durability has gone way just in the last couple years.

925
01:05:59,196 --> 01:06:01,485
Rym: Like it is skyrocketed Well, I think it's been.

926
01:06:01,545 --> 01:06:04,840
Scott: I think it's been progressing gradually right and and constantly.

927
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:10,747
Rym: I think it might have hit a tipping point between that like the new sapphire glass and some of the stuff they're doing this iPhone like 13 SE.

928
01:06:12,262 --> 01:06:19,660
Rym: So I flipped over my handlebars and the phone was in my hand at the time like like like held in one of my hands.

929
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:26,599
Rym: So I flipped over and I landed with my full body weight on my phone on rough concrete.

930
01:06:27,642 --> 01:06:30,352
Rym: The phone was completely fine.

931
01:06:30,413 --> 01:06:32,200
Rym: it has the tiniest scratch.

932
01:06:33,043 --> 01:06:35,833
Rym: Phones are fucking durable as crap nowadays.

933
01:06:35,913 --> 01:06:51,220
Scott: a lot of my previous phones Which I did not put cases on right would often by the time I was done with them have various like You know minor scratches and cosmetic damage, you know rough edges a few maybe like a dent here or there, right?

934
01:06:51,581 --> 01:06:53,608
Scott: Micro scratches things like that.

935
01:06:53,749 --> 01:06:56,820
Scott: right this iPhone 12 is almost two years old, right?

936
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:58,935
Scott: Cuz iPhone 14s are going to be announced in a month.

937
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:00,183
Scott: Yeah, right It's almost.

938
01:07:00,243 --> 01:07:01,367
Scott: it's almost two years old.

939
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:07,367
Scott: if I clean the screen it is 100% smooth right 100%.

940
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:14,633
Scott: there is not any visible scratch of even a small cosmetic nature Anywhere on that screen.

941
01:07:14,653 --> 01:07:20,138
Scott: I could probably you know I've never put my phone in my pocket with my keys and I still won't but I probably could.

942
01:07:20,158 --> 01:07:24,000
Scott: yeah Right because something that they've done has just made it that much better.

943
01:07:24,421 --> 01:07:25,825
Scott: you may not need it.

944
01:07:25,906 --> 01:07:37,487
Scott: if you're only slightly clumsy right and not, you know, extremely clumsy and Haphazard you may be able to get away without a case Whereas previously you needed one now.

945
01:07:37,527 --> 01:07:43,586
Rym: that said this really only applies to the upper tier Android phones like the.

946
01:07:44,108 --> 01:07:47,600
Scott: the high quality ones from the expensive phones are the more durable phones.

947
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:52,660
Scott: Cheap ones are made of plastic with less expensive glass and they break eat more a much more easily.

948
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:58,240
Rym: But the cheapest iPhone is more durable than like the middle-range Android phone on average.

949
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:00,527
Scott: Yeah, it depends on which one it is.

950
01:08:00,728 --> 01:08:04,139
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, if you can get away with it get away with it.

951
01:08:04,801 --> 01:08:06,787
Scott: And the final topic is cables, right?

952
01:08:06,867 --> 01:08:10,216
Scott: Hopefully the iPhone 14 will take you as BC.

953
01:08:10,236 --> 01:08:11,520
Scott: We're hoping for it, right?

954
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:13,645
Scott: We're gonna find out soon.

955
01:08:13,665 --> 01:08:15,854
Rym: I hate I hate this lightning cable.

956
01:08:15,914 --> 01:08:17,359
Rym: I hate everything about lightning cables.

957
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:26,720
Scott: I hate the fact the only device you got one device of the lightning cable and everything else in your whole life is like Yes, I had to buy a bunch of lightning cables when I bought this fucking iPhone.

958
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:31,975
Scott: Right by whatever phone you got by third-party cables that are high quality.

959
01:08:32,277 --> 01:08:34,163
Scott: if you buy cheap cables They're gonna break.

960
01:08:34,404 --> 01:08:37,520
Scott: you can get nice freaking long ones that are durable as hell.

961
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:43,279
Scott: You can get a third-party charger with like a whole bunch of charging on it right that charges fast, right?

962
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:48,131
Scott: Don't use the friggin included charger nonsense unless that's all you've got.

963
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:48,492
Scott: really.

964
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:58,912
Rym: it's like yeah, you know and I guess last in terms of actually the logistics of you have a new phone And you had an old phone as opposed to nothing.

965
01:08:59,495 --> 01:09:01,965
Rym: if it's an Apple device Just do the Apple thing.

966
01:09:02,005 --> 01:09:04,353
Rym: that like basically just copies everything over to your new phone.

967
01:09:04,393 --> 01:09:06,300
Rym: It just works on Android.

968
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:10,189
Rym: Honestly, yeah, there there are sort of equivalents.

969
01:09:11,093 --> 01:09:24,679
Rym: I would advise especially with Android Just setting everything up brand new on your new Android phone and only using the Android sync stuff to copy over your data dot and maybe use the App Store to copy over the apps you have installed.

970
01:09:24,738 --> 01:09:31,305
Rym: but Honestly, the Android experience is not nearly as good in that I've never experienced that.

971
01:09:31,327 --> 01:09:34,240
Scott: I guess you've never experienced switching from one iPhone to another iPhone.

972
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:37,252
Scott: I will at some point the way the way it works.

973
01:09:37,593 --> 01:09:40,024
Rym: you put it next to each other and they say hi Right.

974
01:09:40,064 --> 01:09:42,033
Scott: It used to be it used to be more difficult.

975
01:09:42,073 --> 01:09:47,054
Scott: But the way it works now Is that you have iCloud backup enabled which I strongly recommend.

976
01:09:47,274 --> 01:09:57,780
Scott: having a backup of your phone Right because you're gonna want to set the security setting on your phone to automatically erase your phone If someone tries to log in and fails too many times, right?

977
01:09:58,001 --> 01:10:03,880
Scott: so no one can get into your phone and You won't care if your phone got erased because you have an iCloud backup.

978
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:09,619
Scott: That's automatic and you could just get a phone and restore it and then your phone will just after you restore it.

979
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,452
Scott: It's it feels like that's your phone like you.

980
01:10:12,472 --> 01:10:14,280
Scott: never nothing got lost at all whatsoever.

981
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:21,841
Scott: Yeah So turn on iCloud backups pay for Apple storage space if necessary if your phone has too much data that you need to back Up.

982
01:10:22,444 --> 01:10:29,155
Scott: and then with the way it works is when you get a new phone You just hold the phones near each other and it's like, okay.

983
01:10:29,456 --> 01:10:42,216
Scott: I see your old phone I know how to find your iCloud backups I know who you are and it just restores the backup on the new phone as if it's the same process Basically and like in a matter of minutes, you know, once it's done doing all its bullshit.

984
01:10:42,898 --> 01:10:43,360
Scott: There you go.

985
01:10:43,661 --> 01:10:45,667
Scott: It's like your phone is completely transferred over.

986
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:47,211
Scott: Congrats, right?

987
01:10:47,252 --> 01:10:49,860
Scott: There may be a few things that won't just transfer.

988
01:10:51,462 --> 01:10:57,326
Scott: You know like maybe Google off if you're using that but I recommend Switching to a different solution.

989
01:10:57,366 --> 01:10:58,008
Scott: to avoid that.

990
01:10:58,069 --> 01:10:59,013
Rym: I want to say there was.

991
01:10:59,033 --> 01:11:01,102
Rym: I haven't checked cuz I don't use a Google off anymore But there.

992
01:11:01,142 --> 01:11:06,883
Rym: well, I think there might have been a change where you could Transfer to a new phone in a way that you could add that feature But it's still.

993
01:11:06,923 --> 01:11:09,794
Scott: it's not going to be included automatically with the iCloud.

994
01:11:09,854 --> 01:11:11,360
Rym: I mean I I failed anyway.

995
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:13,277
Rym: I use YubiKey for everything now.

996
01:11:14,101 --> 01:11:20,276
Rym: Yep, same and last there is one concern that only applies to Android but it is important.

997
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:29,200
Rym: I would avoid Android phones that have a weird Android version that was made by a carrier or a company.

998
01:11:29,925 --> 01:11:37,040
Rym: Wait the in order Get an Android phone made by Google that just has stock Android like that is your best option.

999
01:11:38,382 --> 01:11:47,260
Rym: second best but actually acceptable is Sony because for whatever reason Sony has the best hardware still of any Android phone.

1000
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,678
Rym: It's not as good as an iPhone hardware, but it's still pretty good.

1001
01:11:50,383 --> 01:11:53,180
Rym: But Sony does have their Sony Android.

1002
01:11:53,803 --> 01:12:04,559
Rym: Not only is it 99% the same as stock Android But it gets updates for a very very long time in a way that very few others weird androids do.

1003
01:12:06,621 --> 01:12:09,692
Scott: Pixel phone they're promising five years of updates.

1004
01:12:09,752 --> 01:12:10,394
Scott: That's pretty good.

1005
01:12:10,475 --> 01:12:14,680
Scott: That's pretty good iPhones But it's better than before where they were only doing like three years.

1006
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:22,092
Rym: I mean, I was getting Sony Android updates on my Xperia That I've used for like four and a half years.

1007
01:12:22,172 --> 01:12:23,276
Scott: just fine four and a half.

1008
01:12:23,336 --> 01:12:25,764
Scott: Okay, so five but yeah I think it kept going.

1009
01:12:25,845 --> 01:12:27,391
Rym: that security updates, but I bailed.

1010
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:29,780
Scott: and while we're talking about updates, right?

1011
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:36,420
Scott: If there are updates to apps and the OS on your phone install them at your earliest convenience.

1012
01:12:36,742 --> 01:12:40,420
Scott: Always don't sit around not updating the phone update it.

1013
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,215
Scott: You might be like one of those people complaining you don't like the update.

1014
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:52,000
Scott: tough shit Update it immediately because they're usually fixing security vulnerabilities And if your phone is compromised your life is fucked.

1015
01:12:52,401 --> 01:13:02,372
Scott: Right, if there is an update for your phone, you should be like, you know, it's not an emergency But you should update it within like a day like that night at the latest.

1016
01:13:02,493 --> 01:13:07,469
Rym: my phone being compromised is more dangerous to me than My fucking computer being compromised.

1017
01:13:07,891 --> 01:13:08,393
Scott: That's right.

1018
01:13:08,594 --> 01:13:15,040
Scott: So update the phone And of course, you know the longer the phone when the phone stops getting updates, right?

1019
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,280
Scott: You don't throw it out, right?

1020
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:24,140
Scott: But you should sell that phone or recycle it or trade it in I would suggest on a new phone.

1021
01:13:24,342 --> 01:13:25,918
Scott: I wish you can afford to do so.

1022
01:13:26,542 --> 01:13:29,512
Rym: I have done this for a while and it has saved my butt a couple times.

1023
01:13:30,013 --> 01:13:35,786
Rym: if you upgrade to a new phone and the Old phone still works now It's not like the carrier.

1024
01:13:35,806 --> 01:13:38,195
Rym: frequencies change and it literally doesn't work anymore.

1025
01:13:38,255 --> 01:13:57,199
Rym: Like that happens occasionally If you can afford not trading it in Keeping the old phone as a back up phone is not the worst idea because if something happens to your phone and you're like about to go on a trip or something just Popping your sim back to the old phone and having a smartphone that works and is already set up pretty well for you.

1026
01:13:57,861 --> 01:14:00,148
Rym: Not bad that saved my butt once.

1027
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:10,760
Scott: yeah every iPhone I've ever had I have you know Gave into a friend sold trade it in, you know did something to but I still got this Sony Xperia right here.

1028
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,433
Rym: I actually had it out recently because I was making sure to had all this updates.

1029
01:14:13,855 --> 01:14:17,740
Rym: if something happens to my iPhone I would use this until I got my iPhone replaced, right?

1030
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:24,680
Scott: But my backup phone is an iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 is going to stop getting updates.

1031
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:26,949
Scott: I think it got its last update already probably.

1032
01:14:26,969 --> 01:14:29,619
Scott: Yeah, and so that's a problem now and that it's like.

1033
01:14:29,659 --> 01:14:34,020
Scott: well It's my backup phone, but I it still works just fine.

1034
01:14:34,341 --> 01:14:39,697
Scott: I could use it in an emergency, but it not being updated is sort of like now.

1035
01:14:39,717 --> 01:14:40,800
Rym: we're at it right now.

1036
01:14:41,282 --> 01:14:51,510
Rym: A lot of old phones don't support 5g and I got to tell you if you have a phone that doesn't support 5g You're gonna find that a lot of areas don't have 4g that works anymore.

1037
01:14:53,984 --> 01:14:54,954
Scott: 4g is still out there.

1038
01:14:54,975 --> 01:15:03,300
Rym: So So I have my iPhone and my Sony and I did some tests for a bunch of reasons a while ago.

1039
01:15:04,484 --> 01:15:05,939
Rym: 4g does not work in a lot of LIC.

1040
01:15:07,425 --> 01:15:08,576
Rym: All right 5g works fine.

1041
01:15:10,121 --> 01:15:11,645
Scott: Sure, that's in one place the point.

1042
01:15:11,725 --> 01:15:18,263
Scott: if you look at maps 5 4 4g coverage is vast worldwide and 5g coverage is not right.

1043
01:15:18,383 --> 01:15:19,748
Scott: the most places don't have 5g.

1044
01:15:19,788 --> 01:15:23,312
Scott: but as Time goes on next 5 to 10 years, right?

1045
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:30,056
Scott: You're gonna start seeing that, you know turning off of the right now might have 6g by then.

1046
01:15:30,097 --> 01:15:31,140
Scott: who the hell knows, right?

1047
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,966
Scott: But yeah, you're gonna.

1048
01:15:33,187 --> 01:15:34,371
Scott: a phone will stop working.

1049
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:35,756
Rym: So the listener asked a question.

1050
01:15:35,876 --> 01:15:37,000
Rym: Normally we would stop here.

1051
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:39,500
Rym: We've already gone along but we skipped a show and we had a lot to get out.

1052
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:41,731
Rym: You know, we miss when we skip a GeekNights.

1053
01:15:41,852 --> 01:15:43,540
Rym: It all just sort of cramps into our brain.

1054
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:52,718
Rym: There's like a backlog in there words to say but especially because with kovat we still don't see each other that often Like I don't he's got in person more often than like once every other week.

1055
01:15:54,081 --> 01:16:03,536
Rym: so, uh the listener asks and I actually have some thoughts on this any thoughts on buying used phones refurbished phones previous gen phones.

1056
01:16:04,258 --> 01:16:13,040
Rym: I would say one Refurbished phones are often not a great idea because they often do not have a great battery life.

1057
01:16:13,965 --> 01:16:15,554
Scott: Yeah, so it depends right?

1058
01:16:15,595 --> 01:16:16,158
Scott: So that's true.

1059
01:16:16,178 --> 01:16:18,105
Scott: you someone's gonna turn in.

1060
01:16:18,205 --> 01:16:20,593
Scott: a lot of people will get a phone with a sad

1061
01:16:20,653 --> 01:16:32,558
Rym: battery, however, if you're a poor a Refurbished phone where they have replaced the battery with some third-party battery that phone is gonna be real cheap and it's gonna be pretty good for you, even though

1062
01:16:32,698 --> 01:16:38,018
Scott: or a Refurbished phone and you get about you buy a battery and right it's like.

1063
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:43,215
Rym: yep If you're poor a refurbished phone is probably a great idea.

1064
01:16:43,556 --> 01:16:49,220
Rym: a refurbished phone That's a good phone that you just have to plug an anchor into all the time because the battery and it sucks.

1065
01:16:49,564 --> 01:16:50,799
Rym: That's better than no phone.

1066
01:16:51,862 --> 01:16:52,760
Scott: Yeah, right.

1067
01:16:52,862 --> 01:17:04,900
Scott: so if a Used phone a cheap phone an old phone are if you don't have a lot of money are indeed a great idea As long as the phone is compatible and still getting software updates like we mentioned right?

1068
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,727
Scott: You don't want to get a phone like like.

1069
01:17:06,767 --> 01:17:07,129
Scott: I just said.

1070
01:17:07,149 --> 01:17:09,580
Scott: my iPhone 7 just went out of style, right?

1071
01:17:10,301 --> 01:17:14,075
Scott: So, you know if you buy an iPhone 9, I don't know if that's such a thing.

1072
01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:15,680
Scott: Was there a 9?

1073
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:16,483
Rym: I don't know.

1074
01:17:16,483 --> 01:17:22,888
Scott: 13 se is when I whatever yeah, whichever one they had, you know It's like but the thing is it's like.

1075
01:17:22,929 --> 01:17:25,800
Scott: well, you could buy a refurbished right phone.

1076
01:17:26,821 --> 01:17:32,480
Scott: But you know, they still sell like iPhone 11's for like 500 bucks, right?

1077
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,488
Scott: They sell the iPhone SE.

1078
01:17:34,548 --> 01:17:36,600
Scott: how much does that thing cost right?

1079
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:40,732
Scott: For $430, right.

1080
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:41,277
Scott: so it's like.

1081
01:17:42,265 --> 01:17:44,300
Scott: Should you be getting a refurbished?

1082
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:48,669
Scott: Phone or an old used phone really gives in the price.

1083
01:17:48,729 --> 01:17:56,059
Rym: if you can say you find like a refurbished iPhone 12 for like $150 hell, yeah, well, you're not gonna find one that cheap right my.

1084
01:17:57,024 --> 01:17:58,369
Scott: But compare compare.

1085
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:05,780
Scott: they still sell older phones Right, you know, it's like, you know, would you get a refurbished iPhone?

1086
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:14,503
Scott: 11 or You know a. you know, you can get like maybe a pixel seven or not seven That's that would be.

1087
01:18:14,663 --> 01:18:18,459
Scott: that's like a new one pixel five right because six six and seven are out.

1088
01:18:18,499 --> 01:18:20,531
Scott: now I guess you know, it's like.

1089
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:22,662
Scott: you got to look at the prices There might.

1090
01:18:22,722 --> 01:18:27,300
Scott: I was saying is that go there might be a new phone of an old model.

1091
01:18:27,641 --> 01:18:31,120
Scott: Might or might not be a better option than a refurbished phone?

1092
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:39,176
Rym: Yeah I would say in a. Generally, of course you have to your research like if you're hunting for deals You got a hunt for deals like look for the parts better for the environment.

1093
01:18:39,196 --> 01:18:39,980
Scott: to get the used phone?

1094
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:54,355
Rym: Yeah, but in a pinch I would suggest it's it's eco sensible a new phone from a previous generation or a The best options in that space?

1095
01:18:54,517 --> 01:18:54,980
Rym: generally.

1096
01:18:55,791 --> 01:19:01,045
Scott: Yeah just as long as the phone is still getting updates and You know, it's in good shape.

1097
01:19:01,306 --> 01:19:04,920
Scott: Yeah, and you may or may not need to get the battery replaced.

1098
01:19:05,081 --> 01:19:11,589
Scott: Don't be afraid of if you can't do it yourself because you're not a tech wizard Right and you're afraid to open up your phone.

1099
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:14,660
Scott: Don't be afraid of phone repair places, right?

1100
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,239
Scott: They're like they actually can repair phones.

1101
01:19:17,721 --> 01:19:23,860
Rym: If you're worried about data privacy like especially if it's not an iPhone just have them fix the hardware and then wipe the thing.

1102
01:19:24,901 --> 01:19:25,583
Scott: No, wipe it.

1103
01:19:25,683 --> 01:19:26,466

Scott: They give it to you right then put your then load your backup, right?
