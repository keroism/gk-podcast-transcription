1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,080
Scott:

2
00:00:08,923 --> 00:00:10,388
Rym: It's Thursday, March 31st, 2022.

3
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:10,670
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:14,126 --> 00:00:14,536
Scott: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,263
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

6
00:00:16,363 --> 00:00:24,020
Rym: We are back from a long, unplanned hiatus to talk about James Bond, the mostly fictional spy.

7
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:26,700
Scott: Mostly?

8
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:30,978
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:41,520
Rym: So, yeah, we had a longer hiatus than we've really ever had on GeekNights, except in extremely rare circumstances in these, what, 16-plus years.

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,130
Rym: Do a bunch of random stuff, you know, like Friends came over.

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,720
Rym: We had some work stuff.

12
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,859
Rym: Eventually, like, Scott had a hockey game, and then I had to go to London on a business trip, but we're finally back.

13
00:00:54,061 --> 00:01:08,700
Scott: We might have actually been able to get in a few shows there, but nobody realized that at some point in history, I don't remember exactly when, the GeekNights, Monday, Wednesday, Tuesday, Thursday offset was offset.

14
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:18,080
Rym: I actually know the date it happened, because I had filled my work calendar with permanent recurring meetings to make sure no one ever tried to schedule me.

15
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:21,780
Scott: I could scroll back on the calendar and figure out exactly when it was.

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,344
Scott: But we waited.

17
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:24,360
Rym: I was curious if anyone would notice.

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:33,020
Scott: Nobody ever noticed, but yeah, this should have been a Monday, Wednesday week if we had never fucked up, but we fucked up once, and it was now a Tuesday, Thursday week.

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,140
Scott: So, if we hadn't made that one fuck up, maybe the break of GeekNights episodes would have been shorter.

20
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:45,860
Rym: Yeah, maybe the whole reason we've never had long hiatus was because of the previous, original GeekNights schedule.

21
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,599
Rym: It just lined up with our lives, like the ebb and flow of wanting to see people and do things.

22
00:01:51,781 --> 00:02:00,740
Scott: But yeah, a whole bunch of stuff happened on GeekNights days, and since it's not our job, and we don't really care if we miss a show, no one's paying us to do this, we're not obligated.

23
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,419
Scott: We just, and we don't have a lot of ideas, you know, okay, let's skip, fine, okay.

24
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:13,480
Scott: But that doesn't mean we're dead, it just seems, you know, obviously we're not dead, we're here.

25
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:14,102
Rym: Yep.

26
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,874
Rym: Speaking of which, so in the news, guess who had COVID?

27
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:19,640
Rym: That's why we didn't do a show on Tuesday.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:28,040
Rym: I tested positive within hours of, well, basically within about 12 hours of landing back in the US after a week long trip in the UK.

29
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,900
Rym: I am, as of now, basically completely recovered, but I'm still gonna isolate for another two weeks.

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:47,120
Scott: Yeah, so the two things I gotta say about that is, number one, man, it must suck to spend, like, so many years of your life hiding inside only to go outside once and immediately get, it's like-

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,598
Rym: Yep, I go out for the, like, alright, I'm gonna do this business trip, I'll wear a mask, like, the whole damn time.

32
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:56,880
Rym: Yep, the slightest misstep, it immediately gets me, it immediately gets Emily.

33
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,260
Rym: It's

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:19,120
Scott: like, imagine going into the woods and you've got this manual that's, like, how to not get eaten by a bear, and you got your, you know, bear repellent, and you got, you know, all kinds of, you got every bear precaution in the universe, and you're out in the woods for years, never ever ever getting in trouble with a bear, and you let your guard down for, like, a second, and a bear eats you.

35
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,443
Rym: Well, you know, that's how my bike got stolen in Beacon.

36
00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:34,593
Rym: You know, I used to bike, we used to bike to the train station in the morning, because parking spaces there were hella expensive, and one day, I forgot my bike lock, like, I had it somewhere else for some reason, and I thought, what are the odds?

37
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:38,877
Rym: I kind of just jammed my bike into the pile of all the other bikes, bike was stolen that day.

38
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:42,880
Rym: Granted, that was the bike I stole back.

39
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:58,175
Rym: But, yeah, thankfully, because I had two vaccines and a booster, honestly, it felt like a really bad cold, but not even the worst cold I'd ever had, and 36 hours later, like, I'm feeling good enough to do a GeekNights.

40
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:02,900
Rym: Don't know if I'd feel like going, like, doing eight hours of work, but I can do an hour of podcasting.

41
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,455
Scott: The other thing I gotta say is that you only got this because your work made you go to London.

42
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:11,360
Scott: You wouldn't have been going to London if your work didn't make you go.

43
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:11,400
Scott: I

44
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:42,140
Rym: don't know, it is clear that if I had kept my previous levels of, like, isolation to the point that I was even avoiding things people we know were doing, like, where everyone has different levels, I probably could have kept avoiding it, but my worry is, going to the UK showed me something that, I guess, because I've been so careful and lived in New York City and, like, haven't really left New York City that much, like, we went way upstate to ski in the winter, and, yeah, like, I expected people to not give a shit about COVID, like, up in this rural area, but New York City, people are still treating it pretty carefully.

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,779
Scott: Not as much now.

46
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,381
Rym: Yeah, but still more so.

47
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:59,840
Rym: When I got to the UK, I gotta tell you, so I land, come out of the airport, go to my hotel, every bar, and it's, like, morning, every restaurant, every bar all day, completely packed with maskless people, shoulder to shoulder.

48
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,440
Rym: London was more crowded indoors and, like, more filled with spittle than I have ever seen it pre-COVID.

49
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,807
Rym: It's like nobody, no one was wearing, not one person was wearing a mask.

50
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:19,496
Rym: Even in New York, I still see the occasional person wearing a mask outside, and the majority of people wearing masks indoors.

51
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,879
Rym: Our building still requires you to have a mask on to come in.

52
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:29,140
Scott: So, what I gotta say to that is, since your work made you go, is this a workers' comp situation or what?

53
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,822
Rym: It could be.

54
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:31,851
Rym: I could think about exploring that.

55
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,680
Rym: I have negative PCR.

56
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,611
Scott: It wouldn't be a large claim, right?

57
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:37,040
Scott: It would probably just be a small settlement.

58
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Rym: Well, 'cause the problem is the damage to me that I can prove correctly.

59
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,219
Rym: Very small.

60
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:43,490
Scott: Very small.

61
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:44,079
Scott: Not zero.

62
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:51,434
Rym: But I do have a negative PCR test from every other day on the entire trip and a negative rapid test every day.

63
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:54,360
Rym: I definitely caught it on the trip, guaranteed.

64
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:56,090
Scott: Yeah.

65
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,736
Scott: Well, you know.

66
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:57,936
Rym: Yep.

67
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:04,738
Scott: I'm the kind of person who would, like, you know, try to do the workers' comp just for the principle of the thing, like, you know.

68
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:06,620
Rym: Yep.

69
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:24,140
Scott: And also, you know, there's a lot of reports, like, hey, that even if you get, you know, I don't know how true all these things are, but I've seen a lot of comments and studies that are like, you know, hey, you got a COVID, but, you know, and you got over it and you feel fine, but actually, you know, it messed with your brain or it messed with you in some other way, you know, something like that.

70
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:24,701
Rym: Yep.

71
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:31,335
Rym: Well, even beyond that, so apparently now PCR tests basically won't work on me for 90 days is the line.

72
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,900
Rym: Like, they'll just show positive even though I'm not anymore.

73
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,325
Rym: So I am now exempt from being tested if I go anywhere.

74
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:44,233
Rym: All I have to do is sign a thing saying I've had COVID confirmed and nobody gives a shit.

75
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:48,520
Rym: I don't have to do any testing anywhere, which is interesting.

76
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:54,358
Rym: But also, my immunity theoretically also only lasts 90 days.

77
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,162
Scott: Yeah.

78
00:06:56,182 --> 00:07:00,600
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, they're letting people into, you know, that square garden without vaccine.

79
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,047
Rym: I mean, the last hockey game I went to with you, you and I were wearing masks.

80
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:08,514
Rym: That kid sitting to the front left of us was wearing a mask.

81
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:12,000
Rym: And I think one other person was wearing a mask on the other side of the arena.

82
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,097
Scott: There are still some people, but it's like the majority are not and they're not checking for vaccination anymore.

83
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:17,939
Scott: They're just like, fuck it.

84
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,400
Rym: Yep.

85
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:23,807
Rym: So my worry is my real fear is that it's unavoidable.

86
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:26,310
Rym: And that means that we have a society of just failed.

87
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,596
Scott: because while I mean, we knew it was going to become endemic at some point.

88
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:35,040
Scott: But is is this endemic or is this still a pandemic?

89
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,182
Scott: I don't know how to tell.

90
00:07:36,362 --> 00:07:49,920
Rym: Even if like masking and other things that started to fall away, I feel like the thing we as a society, society should have doubled down on more than anything else are the vaccine mandates requiring the vaccine to go places because that is the big line between.

91
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,781
Scott: I think we should.

92
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:51,983
Scott: I still think you should hold.

93
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:53,646
Scott: I'm not even joking about this.

94
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,669
Scott: I think you should hold people down and jab them.

95
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:56,290
Scott: Right.

96
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:57,352
Scott: Too bad.

97
00:07:57,673 --> 00:07:58,855
Scott: Unless unless you do.

98
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:02,140
Scott: Obviously, the true medical exemptions, obviously.

99
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:09,816
Scott: But the you know, the nut job who just is a denier, hold them down and jab them.

100
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,400
Scott: I got no problems with that whatsoever.

101
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,506
Rym: There is the the fear of the slippery slope of bodily autonomy.

102
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:20,537
Rym: That's why the compromise usually is we won't force it on you, but you are now denied access to all public places.

103
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:22,340
Scott: You're basically under house arrest.

104
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,903
Scott: You know, we could talk about slippery slopes again.

105
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:26,223
Scott: Right.

106
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:32,351
Scott: But it's like, you know, there's a constant thing in our society where it's like because of some principle.

107
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:32,811
Scott: Right.

108
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:35,275
Scott: It's like we don't want to go down a slippery slope.

109
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:39,539
Scott: But it's like, OK, you're afraid of the next step on the slope, but you're OK with the first step.

110
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,784
Scott: It's like, well, yeah, but I don't want to do the first step because I'm afraid of the second one.

111
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:45,205
Rym: Just don't go down the second step.

112
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:46,946
Scott: Just don't go down the fucking second step.

113
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:47,467
Scott: Right.

114
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:48,087
Scott: It's like.

115
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:52,371
Rym: what if the anti-fascists start attacking people who aren't Nazis?

116
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:53,672
Rym: Like it's in our name.

117
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:54,673
Rym: That's that's like.

118
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:57,996
Rym: the only thing anti-fascists are after is the fascists.

119
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:01,719
Rym: If the fascists go away, they don't go after someone else.

120
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:02,600
Rym: They go home.

121
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:11,749
Scott: The point is society as a whole would be better if we would, you know, go down slippery slopes and just not slip on them.

122
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:12,910
Rym: Right.

123
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:14,812
Scott: Right.

124
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:16,614
Scott: That there's good stuff down the slope.

125
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:17,635
Scott: Just a little ways.

126
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:19,257
Scott: Go down and grab it and come back up.

127
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,898
Scott: Don't fuck up and fall down.

128
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:21,559
Scott: Yeah.

129
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,420
Scott: How hard is that?

130
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:32,340
Rym: But the vaccine mandate seemed to be just the most ridiculous thing to go away, considering that that's the last major measure we have that society will tolerate.

131
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,785
Scott: Yeah, I feel like, you know, I'm not an expert.

132
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,086
Scott: Right.

133
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,012
Scott: But it definitely should have been the last.

134
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:40,094
Scott: That's the easiest thing.

135
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:41,056
Scott: Right.

136
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,120
Scott: Anyway.

137
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:45,703
Rym: So, yeah, don't go out and get it.

138
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:50,029
Rym: Obviously, like if you haven't gotten it yet, I highly advise you to try to keep avoiding it.

139
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:59,200
Rym: But if you do get it, I guess for me personally, it was not as bad as I had feared.

140
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,742
Rym: Mostly because I was vaccinated.

141
00:10:01,863 --> 00:10:03,865
Scott: Well, you might have permanent unseen damage.

142
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:04,326
Scott: True.

143
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:10,013
Rym: But also the benefits of vaccinated, healthy, young and lucky can be a factor.

144
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:15,540
Rym: So do not rely on being all four of those things because nobody is all four of those things forever.

145
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:17,021
Scott: Yep.

146
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:23,430
Scott: In fact, you might be some of all four of those things and afterwards not be all of those things anymore.

147
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,234
Rym: All right.

148
00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:26,976
Rym: So you got any news?

149
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:29,519
Scott: What was my news?

150
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:29,960
Scott: I forgot.

151
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,743
Rym: You are Queens, LaGuardia.

152
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:35,065
Scott: Yeah, right.

153
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:39,010
Rym: So the second worst airport to fly into in the greater New York City area.

154
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,951
Rym: Yeah.

155
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:46,159
Scott: So LaGuardia Airport, you know, which is infamously not a great airport, is actually super close to where I live.

156
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,200
Scott: I could comfortably.

157
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,986
Rym: I have walked home from flights that landed in LaGuardia more than once.

158
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:55,329
Scott: It is possible to walk there.

159
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:57,332
Scott: It is trivial for me to bike there.

160
00:10:57,432 --> 00:10:58,273
Scott: It's that close.

161
00:10:58,553 --> 00:11:03,940
Rym: It is also not hard to walk out of that airport, walk down city streets and then get out of subway.

162
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:04,840
Scott: Yep.

163
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:09,165
Scott: JFK, though, is is a much better airport, but it's way out there.

164
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:09,646
Scott: Right.

165
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:13,751
Scott: I mean, not way out there, but like I got to use trains to get over there or buses or something.

166
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:14,171
Scott: Right.

167
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:16,374
Scott: It's like, you know, you're not walking to JFK.

168
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:17,495
Scott: I could bike to JFK.

169
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:18,736
Scott: It takes a while.

170
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:19,217
Rym: Yep.

171
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:19,778
Rym: Right.

172
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:21,840
Scott: And they're not doing that with luggage either.

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,801
Rym: So what does that just carry?

174
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,503
Rym: They have the Rollie behind you like.

175
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:26,463
Rym: Yeah, sure.

176
00:11:27,064 --> 00:11:31,247
Scott: Despite being so close, LaGuardia is actually harder to get to.

177
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:31,987
Rym: Right.

178
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:32,608
Rym: Oh, yeah.

179
00:11:32,628 --> 00:11:42,936
Rym: There's a bus that if you try to take this bus, my experiences with it are thusly you'll stand at a spot, a stop three or four hours before your flight because you're a New Yorker and you're paranoid.

180
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:43,936
Rym: The bus comes.

181
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:44,697
Rym: It's already full.

182
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:46,158
Rym: The doors don't even open and it leaves.

183
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:48,820
Rym: This will keep happening until you give up and call a cab.

184
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,746
Scott: So, yeah, despite being physically much, much closer, it is much harder to get to its right.

185
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:56,747
Scott: It's closer to Manhattan.

186
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:59,730
Scott: It's it's like, you know, it's like it makes no sense.

187
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:08,840
Scott: So our previous shitty governor wanted to build a train like a special train that goes to LaGuardia from the subway.

188
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:10,582
Scott: Good idea on paper.

189
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:14,566
Scott: But the route selected for this train was inane.

190
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,493
Scott: It involved going way past the airport and then taking a train backwards.

191
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:26,960
Scott: It would only be beneficial for someone from Long Island who could take the Long Island Railroad and then go to the airport easily.

192
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,143
Rym: I remember when we saw that original map and all of New York collectively said, what?

193
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:32,264
Scott: Right.

194
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:38,948
Scott: Most of the people I was most of the people who go to the airport, over 50 percent are coming from Manhattan.

195
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:45,793
Scott: So it makes sense to have the train going from Manhattan to the airport on the left, the west side, not the east side.

196
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:46,753
Scott: Anyway.

197
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:49,035
Scott: So that was the plan.

198
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:51,436
Scott: We got a new governor, new governor.

199
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:52,277
Scott: Not perfect.

200
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:53,598
Scott: Got some problems.

201
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,840
Scott: But still, I guess at least one.

202
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,901
Scott: Point better than the previous governor.

203
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:01,743
Scott: That's not hard, but maybe even two points better.

204
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:02,123
Scott: Right.

205
00:13:02,544 --> 00:13:08,528
Scott: Still got problems, but better and improvement by at least some measures as change plans.

206
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,631
Scott: And they had the Port Authority of New York, New Jersey.

207
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:12,931
Scott: Right.

208
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:14,192
Scott: Who runs these things?

209
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,213
Scott: because don't even get me into that.

210
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:18,495
Scott: What the Port Authority is.

211
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:20,656
Rym: There's a movie.

212
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,118
Rym: There's an old movie that's obscure that talks about the Port Authority.

213
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,500
Rym: You can find anyway called Nothing Lasts Forever.

214
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,721
Rym: It's basically a documentary.

215
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,982
Scott: So they had some public hearings.

216
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:30,483
Scott: Right.

217
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:32,584
Scott: Of, you know, what the fuck should we do?

218
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:33,144
Scott: Right.

219
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:33,725
Scott: We're not going to.

220
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:35,586
Scott: you know, we're not doing the old plan.

221
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:38,868
Scott: What should we do to make LaGuardia more accessible?

222
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:39,409
Scott: Right.

223
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:40,930
Scott: Transportation wise.

224
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:46,313
Scott: So I had previously attended similar hearings for a city bike.

225
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:51,357
Scott: I did one that was a city bike workshop, which is where should we put the city bike docks in your neighborhood?

226
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:56,020
Scott: And that one, the format was you sit at a table in a circle.

227
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,040
Scott: Right.

228
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,103
Scott: With a group of random people that you happen to be at a table with and you discuss.

229
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:01,463
Scott: Right.

230
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:06,947
Scott: And there are many such tables within, you know, and there was a Department of Transportation employee at each table.

231
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,669
Scott: And they they collated their data afterwards.

232
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:13,031
Rym: My answer is put up in every corner, every every intersection, whole city.

233
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:20,156
Scott: I did a one of those for the Crescent Street bike lane, which is now existing and now has a concrete barrier.

234
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:20,656
Scott: Oh, yes.

235
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:21,217
Rym: So get this.

236
00:14:21,257 --> 00:14:26,420
Rym: When I landed from London, my cabbie, I fell asleep in the cab in my mouth, just like.

237
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:30,403
Rym: And he wakes me up, he's like, Crescent Street is closed.

238
00:14:30,423 --> 00:14:30,863
Rym: I'm like, what?

239
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:31,323
Rym: All of it?

240
00:14:31,343 --> 00:14:32,284
Rym: He's like, yeah, all of it.

241
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:33,165
Rym: How where do you live?

242
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:40,030
Rym: And when I got when I finally got home, I saw they had blocked Crescent Street because they were currently craning in the new barriers.

243
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:40,930
Scott: Yep.

244
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:42,391
Rym: It's all there now.

245
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,192
Rym: It's beautiful.

246
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:44,052
Scott: Yep.

247
00:14:44,253 --> 00:14:51,798
Rym: So and I already saw a black car that it somehow wedged it at an intersection, wedged itself in and appeared to be stuck.

248
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:54,800
Scott: So anyway, so that was the same format for that one.

249
00:14:55,261 --> 00:15:01,100
Scott: Then I did a bus, a bus route one, and the bus route one was of the worst format.

250
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,820
Scott: This was the sort of town hall format.

251
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,860
Rym: I mean, the bus anything is always the worst format.

252
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:18,800
Scott: Where they do a slide show for the MTA, does a slide show, and then people then form as the idea that, oh, we're talking about buses, we got to make the presentation way worse.

253
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,820
Scott: And then townies line up for the mic.

254
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:22,244
Scott: Right.

255
00:15:22,324 --> 00:15:23,859
Scott: And that was a bad time, that one.

256
00:15:25,182 --> 00:15:27,380
Scott: So the LaGuardia one, this is Port Authority.

257
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,200
Scott: So we went to Department of Transportation.

258
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:30,290
Scott: We went to MTA.

259
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,340
Scott: Now we're at Port Authority.

260
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:40,640
Scott: How does the Port Authority run the public, you know, workshop for how do we make LaGuardia less shitty to get to and from?

261
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:41,903
Scott: And you know what?

262
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:46,380
Scott: To their credit, this is the best format I ever seen.

263
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:49,760
Scott: I think this format should be used for a lot more things.

264
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,800
Scott: The way it worked is they rent, they had a ballroom at the local wedding venue type place.

265
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:59,720
Scott: And on each side of the ballroom, it was like a science fair.

266
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:07,960
Scott: There were basically a poster board on an easel and each poster board had a transportation option, right?

267
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,900
Scott: Some sort of thing that could be built and an attendant, right?

268
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:20,620
Scott: Someone who worked for the Port Authority, who was very knowledgeable and could answer questions and explain the thing that was on the poster board.

269
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:21,045
Scott: Right.

270
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:22,260
Scott: Like the kid at the science fair.

271
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:29,500
Scott: And so what you would do is you would go in and at your leisure, you would walk around examining the boards and talking to the people.

272
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:37,220
Scott: And then there was a long table full of laptops and you went up to them and you typed in whatever the fuck thing you wanted to type in.

273
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,639
Rym: See, that's how you keep the crazy townie.

274
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,199
Rym: The crazy townie can type their screed into this text box.

275
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,880
Scott: The crazy towner, the crazy and you could submit the form as many times as you want.

276
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,720
Scott: So the crazy townie can write 10 screeds and it's not bothering anyone else.

277
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:54,260
Scott: And they can just read it or delete it afterwards.

278
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:54,921
Scott: Right.

279
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:59,414
Scott: And the normal people can type in what they're going to type in and then you can leave at your.

280
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:01,300
Scott: you don't have to sit there and listen to anything.

281
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,740
Scott: You know, so this is an excellent format.

282
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,440
Scott: A lot of the people who were standing at the boards were extremely knowledgeable.

283
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,198
Scott: I learned all kinds of things I didn't know.

284
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:14,720
Scott: And the thing that I found the most encouraging was that, you know, they had so many options, right?

285
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:23,420
Scott: Not only did they have the existing option that, you know, the previous governor wanted to do, they had different light rails, subway extensions.

286
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,421
Rym: That's the big one.

287
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:33,720
Rym: The fact that they included subway extensions because it is somebody to build a subway extension to New York compared to anything else is like it's orders of magnitude more money for reasons.

288
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,509
Scott: Protected bus lanes, ferry ferry terminals, like so many options they had.

289
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:47,159
Scott: underground, above ground, go along the Grand Central, go into the BQE.

290
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:50,692
Scott: And they were like and not only that, but they were like.

291
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:52,320
Scott: these options are not mutually exclusive.

292
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:56,100
Scott: They're like we could do the ferry and the bus and the subway extension.

293
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,238
Scott: They don't bump into each other.

294
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:57,800
Scott: Right.

295
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:02,880
Rym: Like, you know, imagine an airport with more than one way to get out of it.

296
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:04,600
Rym: That's what most European airports are like.

297
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,173
Scott: That wasn't a car.

298
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:05,480
Scott: Yeah.

299
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,241
Scott: Yeah.

300
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:12,754
Scott: So most of my input was pretty much like, hey, none of these options that you.

301
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:15,560
Scott: you have lots of options here, boat, train, bus.

302
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:16,286
Scott: Right.

303
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:17,219
Scott: All kinds of things.

304
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:24,340
Scott: I don't see any bike or foot options on here, which again, for something that is so fucking close.

305
00:18:24,441 --> 00:18:26,480
Scott: I'm like, just put a city bike dock there.

306
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,024
Rym: Come on.

307
00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:28,920
Rym: Yeah, because you know someone would use it.

308
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,259
Rym: In fact, there were some flights where I would have used it.

309
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,540
Scott: If you're doing a flight where all you got is a backpack, carry on, it's like, you know, I could totally city bike to LaGuardia and back.

310
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,422
Scott: No problem.

311
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:48,699
Rym: How liberating that liberating would that feel to land from a flight somewhere, walk out of the airport, get on a bike and just bike home?

312
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:49,723
Scott: Yep.

313
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:53,060
Scott: And in like 15 minutes to 20 minutes, maybe tops.

314
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:54,788
Rym: Right.

315
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:57,119
Rym: Probably about as long as it takes to take a cab out of there.

316
00:18:57,863 --> 00:18:58,164
Scott: Yeah.

317
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:01,639
Scott: So I say, you know, who knows what they're going to do?

318
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:04,360
Scott: Are they going to choose what I said that they should choose?

319
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:04,883
Scott: Who knows?

320
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:07,620
Scott: But excellent format for workshop.

321
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:09,406
Scott: Yeah.

322
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:10,098
Rym: Yeah.

323
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:16,440
Rym: I feel like the only way you could go better would be to let people type their screen.

324
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:34,840
Rym: But if you could come up with questions about the proposals that let you do a conjoint analysis of the like mean preference of the group instead of people just trying to get their own idea out, like when you force people to choose of the 14 options, which you like better, 11 or 14, like force those kinds of decisions.

325
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:39,360
Rym: You can tease out ideas that people, some of them were mutually exclusive, right?

326
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,501
Scott: Like.

327
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:41,180
Scott: there were two different subway extensions.

328
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:43,300
Scott: One goes through Astoria, right?

329
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:43,520
Scott: Like.

330
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:54,620
Scott: and then one like a long dip Mars and another one goes north out past Astoria, like behind all the industrial shit, past the power plants and then takes a hook to the east.

331
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,001
Scott: Right.

332
00:19:55,943 --> 00:20:03,660
Rym: I was like having a line that came from Manhattan under the river and under Randall's Island all the way across and just intersecting the top of it.

333
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,520
Rym: Mars, then just going all the way out into Queens.

334
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:07,339
Scott: That wasn't one of the options.

335
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,400
Rym: No, that that that wasn't even that was barely an option in the original subway.

336
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:18,040
Scott: There was an option to improve the, you know, the buses that go, you know, over Randall's Island.

337
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:26,220
Rym: So anything to make Randall's Island more accessible to people without cars, because that island is a treasure and the buses that go there are the worst.

338
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:35,350
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

339
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,630
Rym: So we've talked about Dua Lipa on GeekNights a few times.

340
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,650
Rym: Fantastic performer, fantastic musician.

341
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:45,890
Rym: And Dua Lipa has a song called Levitating.

342
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,350
Rym: Scott made it his thing of the day a while ago.

343
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:48,837
Rym: I think it was you.

344
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:49,630
Rym: I think you called Dibz on it.

345
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:51,910
Rym: The music video was the thing of the day, not the song.

346
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:53,510
Rym: Yeah, because the song is great.

347
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,029
Rym: The song has a music video.

348
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:01,010
Rym: The song also has an official music video animated in the style of Sailor Moon.

349
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,330
Rym: And it's just delightful.

350
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:15,190
Rym: So some band or some label that represents a band is suing Dua Lipa, claiming that the song Levitating is, in fact, plagiarizing their song.

351
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,830
Rym: And their song does sound superficially very similar to the song.

352
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:33,150
Rym: So Adam Neely has done a very helpful video where he shows that thousands of songs are just as close to both of these songs as the people are suing and how this lawsuit is absolutely ridiculous.

353
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,269
Rym: It's almost definitely guaranteed to fail.

354
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:40,070
Rym: But if it succeeds, it destroys the concept of music copyright, basically.

355
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,850
Scott: Well, it's already sort of been destroyed, right?

356
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:46,570
Scott: So there's a huge issue going on in the music industry.

357
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,829
Scott: It's been going on for a while.

358
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:56,530
Scott: But basically, you can get money for free if you can get songwriting credits on a song.

359
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:56,870
Scott: Right.

360
00:21:56,891 --> 00:22:02,290
Scott: So let's say, you know, Rym writes a song completely on his own.

361
00:22:02,491 --> 00:22:04,850
Scott: He's never listened to anyone else's music in his life.

362
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:07,130
Scott: He's only listened to public domain classical music.

363
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,589
Scott: He's never listened to anything else.

364
00:22:08,851 --> 00:22:12,050
Rym: Like when I was in IBM and I signed some stuff saying I'd never used real Java.

365
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:13,292
Scott: Right.

366
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:17,750
Scott: And he writes some song and it sounds like doo doo doo doo doo doo.

367
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,065
Scott: Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

368
00:22:19,227 --> 00:22:19,470
Scott: Right.

369
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:22,210
Scott: Which is not a classical song.

370
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:23,135
Rym: Right.

371
00:22:23,156 --> 00:22:24,849
Rym: No, but mine's got a little "ch" in it.

372
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:26,433
Scott: Yeah.

373
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:30,069
Scott: So Rym writes that song, literally legitimately, 100 percent on his own.

374
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:36,950
Scott: You know, but then someone else comes along and is like, hey, I wrote that song, actually.

375
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:37,412
Scott: Right.

376
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:38,148
Scott: Listen to my song.

377
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:40,630
Rym: And vanilla ice starts playing his song.

378
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:41,691
Scott: Right.

379
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:48,670
Scott: And then someone else comes along and says, I wrote, you know, it's like and there are only so many fucking songs that can be made.

380
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:49,291
Scott: Right.

381
00:22:49,312 --> 00:22:52,250
Scott: And there's so many people using samples these days and all their songs.

382
00:22:52,751 --> 00:23:08,109
Scott: So what ends up happening is rather than fight a protracted legal battle, which is just often, you know, not worth it, even if you win a lot of hit songs these days, the song writing credits get chopped up.

383
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:08,832
Scott: Right.

384
00:23:08,993 --> 00:23:19,989
Scott: Not just the people, you know, you'll usually have a group of songwriters writing the song initially and then more and more names just get added on there with various percentages, just getting a piece.

385
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:20,552
Scott: Right.

386
00:23:20,572 --> 00:23:21,509
Scott: Everyone's got to get their piece.

387
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:29,314
Scott: So when someone listens or performs to the song and royalties come in, the money is getting divided up.

388
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:34,270
Scott: You know, these micro pennies from their Spotify streams are getting divided up amongst all these people.

389
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,913
Scott: Right.

390
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:47,435
Scott: So it's like if you write a song, even if you write it completely on your own, it's like if it sounds similar to something else, which it probably will, and that person is listening and litigious.

391
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:51,150
Scott: or, you know, it's like there's free money in it for them.

392
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:55,830
Scott: And this for you, you only have things to lose.

393
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,868
Scott: You have nothing to gain.

394
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:01,970
Scott: You're probably going to end up giving them a piece or fighting.

395
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:04,550
Scott: So, you know, it's a tough choice.

396
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:09,532
Scott: So this keeps happening because the incentives are all misaligned and the system is broken.

397
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:15,009
Rym: And this one is really interesting because Adam does a really deep sort of musicological analysis of it.

398
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:18,790
Rym: But then he also points out that this lawsuit does something weird.

399
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:33,350
Rym: All the other lawsuits, all the ones you're probably more familiar with, they make at some point in their legal argument, a music theory argument like they actually bring out music theory and shows like notation and chord progressions.

400
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,530
Rym: And they make this case that they are fundamentally the same song.

401
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:40,469
Rym: But here, this lawsuit actually doesn't do that at all.

402
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:50,290
Rym: And it seems to focus entirely on specific older songs that sound like this song without actually doing a musicological analysis.

403
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:59,570
Rym: So his argument, at least, is that this is an even easier lawsuit for Dua Lipa to win because they can just point out even older songs that sound even more similar.

404
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,669
Rym: There's prior art and the whole thing gets thrown out.

405
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,231
Scott: Yeah.

406
00:25:02,332 --> 00:25:06,170
Scott: OK, so I just went to Rollingstone.com, you know, the music industry magazine.

407
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:08,750
Scott: I did a search for songwriting credits.

408
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:09,392
Scott: Right.

409
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:11,110
Scott: So you're ready for listen to these headlines.

410
00:25:11,731 --> 00:25:16,372
Scott: March twenty twenty two, Lizzo reaches settlement over Truth Hurts songwriting credits.

411
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:19,870
Scott: March twenty twenty two, experts do a Dua Lipa one.

412
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,760
Scott: March fourth, Post Malone skewers.

413
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,349
Scott: musicians suing for Circles credit can't prove original contribution.

414
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,690
Scott: February twenty eighteen, right.

415
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,830
Scott: Frank Ocean's who's blonde producer over songwriting credits.

416
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:37,630
Scott: Twenty fifteen, Paul McCartney talks, Nix McCartney, Lennon songwriting credit.

417
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,614
Scott: Twenty nineteen, Rolling Stones finally give back bittersweet symphony songwriting credits.

418
00:25:43,057 --> 00:25:45,270
Scott: Twenty twenty one, which Natalie Hemby performed.

419
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:46,273
Scott: Oh, that's different.

420
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:48,403
Scott: OK, the point is this keeps.

421
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:49,327
Scott: those are the.

422
00:25:49,427 --> 00:25:53,749
Scott: obviously those have articles on Rolling Stone because those are, you know, the biggest of the bigs.

423
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:54,132
Scott: Right.

424
00:25:54,212 --> 00:25:57,070
Scott: But, you know, there's a lot.

425
00:25:57,371 --> 00:26:02,310
Scott: Twenty twenty one, Noah Ford, you should be clarifies R. Kelly credit on Drake certified lover boy.

426
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:04,889
Scott: It's like this, you know, goes on and on and on.

427
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:11,414
Scott: This is what is happening in the music industry and has been happening for the past five to 10 years.

428
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:21,754
Rym: And it seems like a big part of it is if these do go to trials, which they have in some cases, juries don't understand any of this and they sound kind of the same.

429
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:22,969
Rym: So juries tend to say yes.

430
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:24,515
Scott: Yes, there have been.

431
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:30,310
Scott: I forget which case it was, was sort of like, you know, one of the Campbell's straw back ones.

432
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,130
Scott: But there was like there was some big ones that, you know, went and set a bad precedent.

433
00:26:34,251 --> 00:26:36,289
Scott: And that's why people keep going after it.

434
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:36,852
Rym: But yeah.

435
00:26:36,872 --> 00:26:46,829
Rym: So her twenty twenty song, the people suing her saying it's their twenty seventeen song and their twenty seventeen song sounds like it's based heavily on songs from like going as far back as the thirties.

436
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,869
Rym: So, yep.

437
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,307
Rym: So anyway, what's your thing of the day?

438
00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:53,590
Scott: What the hell was my thing of the day?

439
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:53,991
Scott: Oh, right.

440
00:26:54,072 --> 00:27:00,174
Scott: So this video is from twenty fourteen, I think it's old, but it was new to me.

441
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:01,388
Scott: So deal with it.

442
00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:13,850
Scott: So the University of Georgia, a warm place, relatively speaking, it is a you know, the University of Georgia is still an enormous university.

443
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:14,312
Scott: Right.

444
00:27:14,393 --> 00:27:17,910
Scott: Big, you know, not like RIT, a small private university where we went.

445
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:18,173
Scott: Right.

446
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:19,449
Scott: It's like a huge, huge place.

447
00:27:19,953 --> 00:27:21,049
Scott: Lots of lots of students.

448
00:27:22,614 --> 00:27:23,969
Scott: So they did have an ice hockey team.

449
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:24,533
Scott: Right.

450
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:25,569
Scott: I think they still do.

451
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,870
Scott: It's they're the Bulldogs.

452
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:29,069
Scott: But I think that the ice hockey team is the ice dogs.

453
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:36,930
Scott: So but they didn't have an arena, an ice hockey rink, at least not a permanent one that was on campus or anything.

454
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:37,491
Scott: Right.

455
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:42,450
Scott: But in twenty fourteen, I guess they wanted to play some home ice hockey games.

456
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:53,770
Scott: So what they did is they got a portable ice rink from Ice America, which is a company that can set up an ice rink basically anywhere you pay them to if you can afford it.

457
00:27:54,851 --> 00:28:01,170
Scott: And they set it up in the ballroom because they have an enormous fucking ballroom at their at their university.

458
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:01,632
Scott: Right.

459
00:28:01,652 --> 00:28:06,350
Scott: Like tremendous, really big enough to hold a full size ice rink and seats.

460
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:19,870
Scott: And in this video, Ice America shows how they set up a portable ice rink indoors in just a big room with no right.

461
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,349
Scott: It's like without making water fall through the ceiling to whatever's below.

462
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:25,915
Rym: I mean, we did it.

463
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:28,530
Rym: We did an episode water in the ceiling for a reason.

464
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:33,153
Rym: I cannot imagine a more perfect storm of water in the ceiling than trying to make an ice rink like this.

465
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:36,750
Scott: They get they get a full sized Zamboni in there.

466
00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:38,730
Scott: They get, you know, grandstands in there.

467
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,730
Scott: Not that many seats, but enough seats.

468
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:41,152
Scott: Right.

469
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:53,249
Scott: It's like they get, you know, how many layers of ice and they set the whole thing up and like in a warm place, by the way, in, you know, 48 hours or whatever, you know, not it doesn't take them long to set it up.

470
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,110
Scott: I don't know how long it takes to undo it, but it's pretty impressive.

471
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:07,789
Scott: And if you have enough money and you need an ice rink and you want to put the ice rink somewhere that ice rinks shouldn't be, but you have enough room for it.

472
00:29:08,852 --> 00:29:13,470
Scott: I if Ice America still exists and you're in America, I think they're the ones to call.

473
00:29:15,611 --> 00:29:22,466
Rym: In the moment, the GeekNights Book Club book that we are going to do an episode on for, let's say, two weeks from now.

474
00:29:23,393 --> 00:29:23,779
Rym: Let's do it.

475
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:24,549
Rym: The next Thursday show.

476
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,116
Rym: So April 14th, you've had.

477
00:29:26,156 --> 00:29:36,709
Scott: you've had three months, which is, you know, if we weren't fucking up and spending two to three years, three months is a good amount of time to read a book that took me less than two weeks, maybe.

478
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:39,383
Rym: So I'm near.

479
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:40,530
Rym: I've read a bunch of it.

480
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,239
Rym: I'll definitely finish.

481
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:42,010
Rym: This is such a show.

482
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,830
Scott: We didn't finish it, even though you took a. you went to London, all that.

483
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,468
Rym: I was actually really busy on the trip and then I got sick.

484
00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:49,433
Scott: Yeah.

485
00:29:50,198 --> 00:29:51,567
Scott: Lick it, licking, licking people.

486
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,330
Rym: I mean, I mean, the trip was a doorknob licking convention.

487
00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:01,151
Rym: So in retrospect, that might have that might have been more more excuses for workers come.

488
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:07,430
Rym: You know, the worst thing was when I was like walking around, I was wearing a mask and I was the only person in London.

489
00:30:08,052 --> 00:30:11,670
Rym: I think every single person I interacted with had to say something about the mask.

490
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,510
Rym: Like, oh, you Americans like everyone's like, oh, you're paranoid.

491
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,354
Rym: Like an American.

492
00:30:15,374 --> 00:30:18,448
Scott: Yeah, well, I got sick from you dirty.

493
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,550
Rym: So this book is very New York.

494
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:29,930
Rym: I really Scott said this before, but I want to reiterate, I want to know what you think of this book if you don't know anything about New York City.

495
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:35,670
Scott: Or even if you know things about New York, but you know, you're not you don't you're not.

496
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:44,289
Rym: you know, you haven't spent a lot of time and even I thought of your Manhattan and then quote the outer boroughs until I moved here.

497
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:52,730
Rym: Then I started to recognize, like Queens and Brooklyn are very different from each other and Staten Island is technically part of New York City.

498
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,469
Rym: I kind of didn't know that when I was a kid.

499
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:05,190
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, most mass media doesn't usually deal with subject matter that the wide audience wouldn't know without like teaching it to them first.

500
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,050
Scott: A superhero movie won't even assume, you know, the origin of the superhero.

501
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:09,671
Scott: Right.

502
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:15,970
Scott: It's like, you know, they got to make sure that, you know, Batman's parents are dead and Spider-Man got bit and Superman's an alien.

503
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:16,415
Scott: Right.

504
00:31:16,436 --> 00:31:16,601
Scott: Right.

505
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:23,053
Scott: But it's like if you go watch a movie about baseball, they don't teach you what baseball is.

506
00:31:23,073 --> 00:31:23,213
Scott: Right.

507
00:31:23,234 --> 00:31:25,204
Scott: They assume, you know, what baseball is.

508
00:31:25,245 --> 00:31:27,929
Scott: if you're going to go watch fucking, I don't know, Bull Durham.

509
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:28,571
Scott: Right.

510
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:37,108
Scott: But this book, it's like it assumes, you know, what New York is just the way Bull Durham assumes, you know, what baseball is.

511
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:37,571
Scott: Right.

512
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:45,150
Scott: So, you know, if you don't know enough about New York, I'm still really curious how the book comes across.

513
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:49,730
Scott: Some some of the listener have told me, but I want to hear from more of the listeners.

514
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:51,775
Rym: So.

515
00:31:51,835 --> 00:32:01,710
Rym: And the other thing I can say is that every character, like this whole book, every time a new character appears, they are absolutely fantastic without exception.

516
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,454
Rym: Mm hmm.

517
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:06,070
Rym: Even the bad characters, when they actually show up, are great.

518
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:15,249
Scott: Well, because it's like it's they're great and not that they're people you like the most, even though some of them you like the most or many of them.

519
00:32:15,712 --> 00:32:18,890
Scott: But they are so exactly correct.

520
00:32:19,011 --> 00:32:20,729
Scott: It's like, yep, that's that guy.

521
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:23,970
Scott: That's exactly how that kind of guy is in the real world.

522
00:32:24,571 --> 00:32:28,569
Rym: When you meet Staten Island girl pretty early on, it's like, wow, wow.

523
00:32:30,872 --> 00:32:33,430
Scott: I've interacted with what Staten Island girl is like.

524
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,606
Scott: Yeah, 100 percent.

525
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:34,870
Scott: Right.

526
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:35,747
Scott: I know that person.

527
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:39,329
Scott: I'm not friends with that person, but I know I have met that person.

528
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:39,731
Scott: Yup.

529
00:32:40,173 --> 00:32:43,750
Rym: I definitely I know a lot of Manny's in the work that I do.

530
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,613
Scott: Oh, yeah.

531
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:51,190
Rym: But it's so like without spoiling things, it's so self-aware.

532
00:32:52,052 --> 00:33:03,164
Rym: Like, man, you know, Manny is a good guy in terms of like what the story is trying to do, but also a checkered past, shall we say, like not.

533
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:14,929
Rym: not everything that Manny does is good and or that many did was good because that, you know, Manhattan's identity is about a lot of the cruelty that has been inflicted by Manhattan, not just about the cool parts of Manhattan.

534
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:16,033
Scott: Yep.

535
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,570
Scott: Anyway, anything else?

536
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:22,750
Scott: Meadow packs is real soon and it's actually happening for real.

537
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:23,422
Scott: I'm not going.

538
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:23,768
Rym: Yep.

539
00:33:24,513 --> 00:33:27,430
Rym: I will be there Thursday, April twenty first.

540
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:30,010
Rym: That is long outside of my quarantine period.

541
00:33:30,753 --> 00:33:33,050
Rym: Of course, I'll take negative tests before that or I'll just bail.

542
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:35,850
Rym: But Thursday, April twenty first, seven p.m.

543
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:43,510
Rym: Bumblebee Theater, a live and significantly updated version of Atari Game Design.

544
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,310
Rym: I think it'll be fun if you're not there.

545
00:33:46,451 --> 00:33:48,908
Rym: I'm going to video it, of course, just like I did for Unplugged.

546
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:52,530
Rym: So do not go to PAX East just because I'm going to be there.

547
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:58,842
Rym: I will definitely put that panel online before the end of PAX East, just like I did with PAX Unplugged.

548
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:05,710
Scott: You know, I'm not holding out any hope for PAX West, but, you know, I might go.

549
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:06,371
Scott: We'll see.

550
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:09,100
Rym: Yeah, I I'm like.

551
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,370
Rym: I'm cautiously optimistic as I am about many things.

552
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:13,016
Rym: We'll see what happens.

553
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:14,449
Scott: I'm not setting any expectation.

554
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:14,753
Scott: Right.

555
00:34:14,793 --> 00:34:16,668
Scott: I'll decide when the time comes.

556
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:20,984
Scott: I would like to go, obviously, but I'm not going to.

557
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:24,889
Scott: I'm not going to set myself up to be like disappointed by not going or anything like that.

558
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:39,648
Rym: The exciting thing I'll just mention briefly is that PAX, once we're post covid and like we're going to PAX is like normal again, PAX has started to set up interesting panel adjacent, but not just panel like content types like I do.

559
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,630
Scott: You know, assuming PAX survives or other conventions survive as well.

560
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:55,909
Scott: I do think that, you know, many conventions have sadly died, but they're the conventions that live are definitely have been invigorated.

561
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,790
Scott: You know, they're not selling out their tickets.

562
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:07,590
Scott: So they're trying a lot harder content wise, you know, doing things that we thought they should have done a long time ago, experimenting, et cetera.

563
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:08,633
Scott: And I like that.

564
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:14,396
Rym: So, yeah, like if it wasn't covid times, we would have I feel like we would have done like this.

565
00:35:14,558 --> 00:35:16,270
Rym: upcoming PAX East might have been one of those.

566
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,730
Rym: We signed up to do too many things conventions.

567
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:28,990
Scott: Yeah, I mean, even in the mid to late 2000s, we were trying to get conventions to try out, you know, things that conventions weren't already doing kinds of content.

568
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,789
Rym: Otakon used to not mail its badges.

569
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:35,650
Rym: They accused Scott of threatening them by telling them to mail the badges.

570
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:38,749
Rym: And look where we are now.

571
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:40,049
Rym: Everybody mails the badges.

572
00:35:42,512 --> 00:35:47,409
Rym: The problem is, if PAX does all this stuff, we're running out of things we wanted that cons haven't done.

573
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:49,288
Rym: We haven't come up with many new things.

574
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:55,350
Rym: I guess the last one would be curated screenings at anime conventions.

575
00:35:56,291 --> 00:36:03,330
Rym: Anyway, anyway, let's move on to the I can't believe never done a show on James Bond.

576
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,789
Rym: Like I thought it felt like one of those things we just had to have done.

577
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:15,970
Scott: Yeah, it's one of the major franchises of, you know, media entertainment in the, you know, the the English speaking world and even the rest of the world.

578
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:17,630
Rym: And it's one that is still going.

579
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:23,549
Rym: The reason we thought of it is I suggested, you know, on the flight home, I watched No Time to Die, the last Daniel.

580
00:36:23,871 --> 00:36:24,676
Rym: I guess spoilers.

581
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:26,809
Rym: It's the last Daniel Craig, James Bond.

582
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:27,776
Scott: Yep.

583
00:36:28,282 --> 00:36:28,849
Rym: But I watched it.

584
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:29,614
Rym: It was OK.

585
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:32,090
Rym: It was an above average Bond movie.

586
00:36:32,871 --> 00:36:38,293
Rym: It was the second best Daniel Craig movie, though I haven't seen Quantum of Solace or Spectre.

587
00:36:39,218 --> 00:36:41,270
Scott: I only saw the first Daniel Craig one and that's it.

588
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:46,670
Rym: The thing is, Casino Royale was great, except my only complaint about that as a bomb.

589
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:50,530
Rym: I hardly remember it was that it kind of followed the book too closely.

590
00:36:50,790 --> 00:37:04,490
Rym: And the book has a few like improbable events that happened, which depending like, I guess the Daniel Craig, James Bond felt too gritty and realistic for the somewhat unrealistic thing that happened in the last third of that movie.

591
00:37:06,254 --> 00:37:09,150
Rym: Anyway, but now like a Pierce Brosnan where he's just got magic.

592
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,310
Rym: He's basically just a wizard.

593
00:37:10,432 --> 00:37:11,710
Rym: Like every James Bond is different.

594
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:13,150
Scott: So, yeah.

595
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:26,953
Scott: So, I mean, James Bond is pretty significant in my life media wise because, right, it was significant in my parents life, especially my mom is like a huge James Bond fan, like big time.

596
00:37:27,013 --> 00:37:27,154
Scott: Right.

597
00:37:27,174 --> 00:37:31,353
Scott: It's like before like, you know, I guess my mom also like Star Wars a lot.

598
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:34,830
Scott: But you got to remember, before Star Wars even fucking existed.

599
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:35,832
Scott: Right.

600
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:41,093
Scott: It's like she was going to see every James Bond movie in the movie theater as soon as it came out.

601
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:48,669
Rym: And unlike, say, Indiana Jones or how by the time Star Wars existed, your parents had been through three bonds.

602
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:49,812
Scott: Right.

603
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:50,535
Scott: Exactly.

604
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:54,570
Scott: It's like there were the James Bond movies kept coming.

605
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,217
Scott: It's like, you know, they were.

606
00:37:56,237 --> 00:38:00,829
Scott: they were like this constant, always their thing, much easier to be a fan of back then.

607
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:01,091
Scott: Yeah.

608
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:08,270
Rym: Look, sixty two, sixty three, sixty four, five, seven, nine, seventy one, seventy three every year or year or maybe two years at most.

609
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:09,073
Scott: Yeah.

610
00:38:09,113 --> 00:38:14,770
Scott: And it's like even when, you know, Star Wars comes and overshadows it, it's like, oh, got three Star Wars movies.

611
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:15,394
Scott: Whoa.

612
00:38:15,435 --> 00:38:15,576
Scott: Right.

613
00:38:15,616 --> 00:38:17,330
Scott: It's like James Bond didn't stop.

614
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,349
Scott: He just kept going.

615
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:19,113
Scott: Right.

616
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:20,258
Scott: There was there was a.

617
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:22,730
Rym: there was a long pause after Timothy Dalton.

618
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:24,590
Rym: It was a while before there was more bond.

619
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,910
Scott: Remember between Timothy Dalton and Goldeneye was that was the break period.

620
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:30,176
Scott: Yeah.

621
00:38:30,316 --> 00:38:33,170
Scott: But it's like for a long time it kept going.

622
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:36,070
Scott: And then once it got started again, it kept going again.

623
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:36,472
Scott: Right.

624
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:39,590
Scott: So in it, you know, it's still going now.

625
00:38:39,691 --> 00:38:41,610
Scott: We'll see when they start up again.

626
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,390
Scott: But, yeah, it's like we had an ever present thing.

627
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:58,669
Scott: And also, I think that, you know, it was introduced to, you know, we read a lot of stories from nerds who go about impressioning their kids the wrong way, trying to force their kids to like the same thing they like.

628
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:04,770
Scott: You know, I've read some possibly false stories on, you know, various redheads.

629
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,674
Scott: It could have been made up.

630
00:39:05,814 --> 00:39:17,850
Scott: But, you know, they're believable stories, at least where, you know, some parent names all their kids after Harry Potter characters and makes everyone watch Harry Potter and cosplays Harry Potter all the time.

631
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,594
Scott: Right.

632
00:39:18,695 --> 00:39:20,849
Scott: And it's like and the kids aren't into Harry Potter.

633
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:21,836
Scott: It's like.

634
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:23,310
Scott: that's not the healthy way to do it.

635
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:23,611
Scott: Right.

636
00:39:24,093 --> 00:39:29,333
Scott: You know, but, you know, my mom, it's like she wasn't like sit down or watching James Bond.

637
00:39:29,373 --> 00:39:39,485
Scott: She was like she really only did two things, which was a. You know, express to us that she was a big like, you know, she.

638
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:43,489
Scott: she was not ashamed to let everyone know she fucking loved James Bond.

639
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:44,332
Scott: Right.

640
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:47,886
Scott: And to shoot watching his model was on TV.

641
00:39:49,591 --> 00:39:49,853
Scott: Right.

642
00:39:50,395 --> 00:39:53,630
Scott: And wouldn't be upset if she would like make anyone watch.

643
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:55,502
Scott: But it's like, why wouldn't you watch?

644
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:56,670
Scott: the movies are actually fucking good.

645
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,255
Rym: Some of them.

646
00:39:58,756 --> 00:40:06,529
Rym: I mean, I think like my parents just put on Star Wars one day and about 20 minutes into it, suddenly my kid brain was like, wait a minute, this is really.

647
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:07,114
Rym: this is cool.

648
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:08,549
Rym: This is my favorite thing on Earth now.

649
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:11,710
Rym: My parents didn't try to indoctrinate me into Star Wars.

650
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,890
Rym: They just put it on and I happen to like it.

651
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:16,454
Scott: Yeah.

652
00:40:16,474 --> 00:40:19,410
Scott: So James Bond itself started out as some books.

653
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,589
Scott: Have you ever read a James Bond book?

654
00:40:20,913 --> 00:40:21,690
Rym: Only Casino Royale.

655
00:40:22,472 --> 00:40:24,182
Scott: I've never read any James Bond book, so I can't.

656
00:40:24,262 --> 00:40:28,539
Scott: I can't tell you if they're good or not.

657
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,649
Rym: Oh, which apparently is the weird one where like the licensing was different for that one compared to every other James Bond book.

658
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:35,082
Scott: Yeah, they're all written by.

659
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:35,729
Scott: what's his name?

660
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:37,183
Scott: What's the guy's name?

661
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:37,790
Rym: Fleming.

662
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:39,194
Scott: Yeah, Fleming.

663
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:41,707
Scott: But anyway, the movies.

664
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:42,975
Scott: Right.

665
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:44,570
Scott: They adapted the books and the movies.

666
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,048
Scott: And that was what the broccoli is.

667
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,392
Scott: Right.

668
00:40:47,018 --> 00:40:48,270
Scott: What a great last name, broccoli.

669
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:56,373
Scott: I'm pretty sure the broccoli family estate has the movie like control of the movie biz part of it.

670
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:00,030
Scott: But yeah, it started off, you know, black and white movies.

671
00:41:00,496 --> 00:41:01,246
Scott: The first one is a Dr.

672
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:01,913
Scott: No.

673
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:02,280
Scott: Right.

674
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:02,790
Scott: With the rocket.

675
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:03,352
Rym: Dr.

676
00:41:03,393 --> 00:41:04,207
Rym: No was the first one.

677
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:09,810
Scott: Nineteen sixty two with Sean Connery, the dragon playing James Bond.

678
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:10,351
Scott: Right.

679
00:41:11,476 --> 00:41:14,210
Scott: And then after Sean Connery stopped doing it late.

680
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:14,534
Scott: Right.

681
00:41:14,635 --> 00:41:15,709
Scott: They switched to Roger Moore.

682
00:41:16,953 --> 00:41:18,570
Rym: You already skipped someone.

683
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:20,021
Scott: Oh, did I?

684
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:20,609
Scott: Who did I miss?

685
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:21,674
Rym: Lazenby.

686
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,189
Scott: Oh, who cares about Lazenby?

687
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,810
Rym: Because remember, he did one and then Sean Connery came back.

688
00:41:27,912 --> 00:41:28,659
Scott: But Lazenby was.

689
00:41:29,062 --> 00:41:29,849
Scott: no one cares about him.

690
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:30,232
Rym: Yeah.

691
00:41:30,776 --> 00:41:32,670
Scott: So no one cares about Timothy Dalton either.

692
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:38,456
Rym: You know, I care about Lazenby because for for whatever reason, that was the bond I saw first.

693
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:39,849
Rym: I have this memory as a kid.

694
00:41:40,052 --> 00:41:40,518
Rym: So get this.

695
00:41:40,538 --> 00:41:41,469
Rym: I had a memory as a kid.

696
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:42,796
Rym: This movie was on.

697
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:46,733
Rym: And as the spy stuff going on, it was on my grandparents gigantic projection TV.

698
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:51,370
Rym: And all the adults were like talking about it disparagingly.

699
00:41:51,754 --> 00:41:52,930
Rym: And then I was like, what's this movie?

700
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,715
Rym: It looks pretty cool.

701
00:41:54,077 --> 00:41:55,930
Rym: And all the adults were like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

702
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,019
Rym: You haven't seen any of these.

703
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,330
Rym: And they made a big hoorah.

704
00:41:58,875 --> 00:41:59,501
Rym: And they were.

705
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:00,450
Scott: they were they were right.

706
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:03,130
Rym: And they were like, no, we're going to we're going to watch.

707
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:09,303
Rym: And they dug out and we watched Sean Connery, James Bond instead, because they didn't want that to be my first bond.

708
00:42:09,343 --> 00:42:09,930
Rym: I don't remember.

709
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,209
Rym: I was like five.

710
00:42:14,152 --> 00:42:14,252
Scott: Yeah.

711
00:42:14,272 --> 00:42:18,549
Scott: Anyway, so then you had Roger Moore, right, who was actually.

712
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,589
Rym: I think it was Thunderball, if I really think about it.

713
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:21,748
Scott: Well, that's like the best one.

714
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,190
Scott: That's like anyway.

715
00:42:24,992 --> 00:42:27,690
Scott: And then you had Timothy Dalton, who no one cares.

716
00:42:29,391 --> 00:42:35,208
Scott: And then you had Pierce Brosnan, who, you know, I think if not for the video game, nobody would have cared.

717
00:42:36,331 --> 00:42:36,491
Rym: He's.

718
00:42:36,692 --> 00:42:45,490
Rym: it's weird because I already encounter people who are very nostalgic for the Pierce Brosnan era of Bond, even though I'll admit it is my least favorite era.

719
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:47,678
Rym: But I don't count the one offs like.

720
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,610
Scott: I mean, he's better than Lazenby and Dalton.

721
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,534
Scott: But that's about it.

722
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,270
Rym: I mean, Dalton got twice as many Bond movies as Lazenby.

723
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:55,786
Rym: So sure.

724
00:42:57,832 --> 00:43:01,170
Rym: But I did not like the Pierce Brosnan Bond at all.

725
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:05,950
Rym: Like he was just he was a magic wizard man wielding magic wizard gadgets.

726
00:43:06,798 --> 00:43:07,430
Scott: Yeah, like everything.

727
00:43:08,012 --> 00:43:11,209
Rym: And then you had the super fake and the current guy until just now.

728
00:43:11,551 --> 00:43:11,832
Rym: Yeah.

729
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:17,350
Rym: Daniel Craig, second or third favorite Bond, depending on how I'm feeling.

730
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:21,550
Scott: I guess he's third after Brosnan and Connery.

731
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:35,190
Scott: But that's the thing that makes the James Bond movies different from all the other sort of franchises, is that there's this that connection where it's like there's an actor who's playing Bond and a set of movies.

732
00:43:35,671 --> 00:43:35,933
Scott: Right.

733
00:43:36,295 --> 00:43:38,510
Scott: And, you know, it doesn't matter who all the characters are.

734
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,089
Scott: It doesn't matter what the plots are.

735
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:40,351
Scott: Right.

736
00:43:40,391 --> 00:43:44,230
Scott: It's like the set of movies where that actor was James Bond.

737
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:44,572
Scott: Right.

738
00:43:44,632 --> 00:43:48,211
Scott: It's like I don't even know actors names, but I know all the James Bond actors names.

739
00:43:48,372 --> 00:43:48,593
Scott: Right.

740
00:43:48,633 --> 00:43:48,955
Scott: It's like.

741
00:43:50,321 --> 00:43:52,430
Scott: it's like art are like a set.

742
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:52,771
Scott: Right.

743
00:43:52,811 --> 00:44:05,418
Scott: It's like you don't have fucking like, oh, the Star Wars where, you know, Hamill was Luke and then the Star Wars where Daniel Craig was Luke and the Star Wars where that doesn't look like.

744
00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:06,410
Rym: In fact, look what they're doing.

745
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:12,537
Rym: They're using CG to make sure you still have the original player, like character and actor in a role.

746
00:44:12,557 --> 00:44:13,468
Rym: Right.

747
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:17,950
Scott: Whereas James Bond is like, you know, it's like it's unique in that way.

748
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:28,488
Scott: Is there anything else you can think of where there's a character and the person who plays that character is sort of, you know, there's the there's the.

749
00:44:28,548 --> 00:44:29,552
Scott: I don't know how to describe it.

750
00:44:29,572 --> 00:44:29,833
Scott: There's

751
00:44:29,873 --> 00:44:51,610
Rym: this similar but distinct thing that you see, especially in some anime where like Lupin anime or I don't know it the where you have the same character mostly drawn the same way, but even played by the same voice actor, possibly, but radically reinterpreted by whoever's writing and directing each movie.

752
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,690
Scott: I do think you see a little bit of it on, you know, on the theater.

753
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:57,212
Scott: Right.

754
00:44:57,253 --> 00:44:58,230
Scott: Stage Broadway.

755
00:44:58,451 --> 00:44:58,732
Scott: Right.

756
00:44:58,752 --> 00:45:03,570
Scott: Because you'll have you know, you'll have a play and it's an original cast.

757
00:45:03,972 --> 00:45:04,194
Scott: Right.

758
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:06,150
Scott: So and so plays the main character.

759
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:06,592
Scott: Right.

760
00:45:07,094 --> 00:45:12,196
Scott: And then obviously the play has to be shown internationally in other languages and other places.

761
00:45:12,236 --> 00:45:14,450
Scott: It goes on tour and you have a different cast.

762
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:15,692
Scott: Right.

763
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:21,049
Scott: The person that the famous person stops being the main character, someone else takes over on Broadway for the extended run.

764
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:27,089
Rym: But they tend not to radically reinterpret the role unless the production itself is radically reinterpreting the role.

765
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:27,831
Scott: Exactly.

766
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:34,270
Scott: That's the difference is that when you do that with a with a play, it's still the same script, the same story.

767
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:35,033
Scott: That's like this.

768
00:45:35,053 --> 00:45:39,795
Scott: It's like if they just made Thunderball over and over and over again with a different James Bond.

769
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:40,699
Scott: But this it's like.

770
00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:47,490
Scott: it's, you know, the same character, the same universe with different stories, but the same, quote, universe.

771
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:55,490
Rym: It's like the lazy Matsumoto verse in that you can't actually make a very clear, good connection between every single movie.

772
00:45:55,591 --> 00:45:57,290
Rym: That's 100, not every single movie.

773
00:45:57,451 --> 00:46:00,369
Scott: But there are some that you can connect to.

774
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,890
Scott: There are some that fit together.

775
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,171
Scott: Yeah.

776
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:08,548
Rym: Well, like all the Daniel Craig ones literally are just a progression, like they all just are sequels to each other.

777
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:10,433
Scott: Exactly.

778
00:46:10,453 --> 00:46:16,610
Scott: And there's there are like some that like involve, you know, Specter, like some Sean Connery ones and whatever that sort of go together a little bit.

779
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,470
Rym: Well, they'll bring common elements together.

780
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:26,650
Rym: Like they'll always be a money, like they'll always be these elements in the movies, but they might act very differently, be portrayed very differently, serve different roles.

781
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:35,789
Rym: James Bond films always seem to try to do one twist in each movie that wasn't like what you expected from a previous movie to the point that you wait for.

782
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:37,450
Rym: Like, where's the Bond twist?

783
00:46:41,336 --> 00:46:57,674
Scott: But, yeah, so I guess, you know, what makes James Bond right, regardless of who the actor is, right, you know, and regardless of, you know, what flavor is being put on it, I think what makes it fun is that, you know, you get a little bit of everything no matter what.

784
00:46:57,735 --> 00:46:57,976
Scott: Right.

785
00:46:58,057 --> 00:46:59,709
Scott: It's like you get you get action.

786
00:47:01,671 --> 00:47:04,890
Rym: Usually there's a pretty big action scene in the first five minutes of the movie.

787
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:11,035
Scott: Usually it's usually it's that the best action in the cold open movie is going to be the chase scene.

788
00:47:11,136 --> 00:47:11,378
Scott: Right.

789
00:47:11,439 --> 00:47:12,710
Scott: It always starts with action.

790
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:23,209
Rym: That's why I was such a big fan of Daniel Craig, because when they brought him onto the scene, Casino Royale, first scene in media rez chase scene, almost like a James Bond movie is going to start with that.

791
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:25,256
Scott: Almost right.

792
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:27,764
Scott: And that the chase scenes are not all.

793
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:31,950
Scott: there's plenty of car chases, no shortage, but there's not just car chases.

794
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:32,352
Scott: Right.

795
00:47:32,773 --> 00:47:36,850
Scott: You get, you know, the skiing chases are really incredible.

796
00:47:37,591 --> 00:47:37,853
Scott: Oh, yeah.

797
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:38,677
Scott: Were they?

798
00:47:38,737 --> 00:47:39,522
Scott: I don't even know they might.

799
00:47:39,562 --> 00:47:42,730
Scott: were they the first some of the earliest slash best ski chases.

800
00:47:42,931 --> 00:47:43,092
Scott: Right.

801
00:47:43,132 --> 00:47:48,130
Rym: I mean, some of the best scenes in Inception were the ski chases because they were very Bond movie like.

802
00:47:48,913 --> 00:47:49,255
Scott: Oh, yeah.

803
00:47:49,335 --> 00:47:51,710
Scott: Total, total Bond ski chases there.

804
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:52,312
Scott: Right.

805
00:47:53,176 --> 00:47:56,570
Scott: So different kinds of chases you got going on a lot of boats going on.

806
00:47:56,932 --> 00:47:57,174
Scott: Right.

807
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,210
Scott: A lot of swimming and all kinds of stuff.

808
00:47:59,693 --> 00:47:59,894
Scott: Right.

809
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:02,270
Scott: I remember, you know, Live and Let Die.

810
00:48:02,652 --> 00:48:02,833
Scott: Right.

811
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:05,770
Scott: Which is not a not a good one, but it's like my favorite one.

812
00:48:05,932 --> 00:48:07,249
Scott: It has good aspects, at least.

813
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,947
Scott: I can recognize first Roger Moore one.

814
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:10,592
Scott: Right.

815
00:48:11,136 --> 00:48:12,810
Scott: First time it was the first Roger Moore.

816
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:13,679
Scott: One was Roger Moore.

817
00:48:15,872 --> 00:48:23,330
Scott: You know, even though I like Sean Connery better than Roger Moore, Live and Let Die is like, you know, because there's the campy chase scene.

818
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:23,892
Scott: Right.

819
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:29,940
Scott: We have the boats and the cars and the ridiculous, you know, racist Southern cop guy.

820
00:48:29,961 --> 00:48:30,042
Scott: Yeah.

821
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:31,713
Scott: And it's like.

822
00:48:32,134 --> 00:48:36,330
Scott: it's like the three way chase between Bond, the cops and the bad guys.

823
00:48:36,571 --> 00:48:36,832
Scott: Right.

824
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:41,213
Scott: And it's got, you know, like the hovercraft going over the road to the other side.

825
00:48:41,614 --> 00:48:54,688
Scott: You know, it's like that's a really good, you know, that's almost I'd say that like in terms of, you know, comedy car chases and movies from Hollywood, it's like Blues Brothers one, Live and Let Die two.

826
00:48:55,372 --> 00:48:58,290
Rym: I believe that maybe number three is obviously Blues Brothers.

827
00:48:58,391 --> 00:48:59,399
Scott: Way ahead.

828
00:48:59,499 --> 00:49:00,789
Scott: Number one, not even close.

829
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:03,932
Scott: Yeah.

830
00:49:04,517 --> 00:49:05,889
Scott: So you get you get stuff like that.

831
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:09,050
Scott: You get the comedy is always there in some aspects.

832
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,789
Rym: That's something a lot of people like.

833
00:49:11,272 --> 00:49:14,610
Rym: I don't like the Pierce Brosnan movies because they just they feel really fakie.

834
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,910
Rym: But don't get me wrong.

835
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:19,870
Rym: They are funny and I appreciate that.

836
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:28,013
Rym: And some of the people who are mad about some later James Bond movies, they try to argue that, well, they're too funny or they're too like there's too much comedy injected.

837
00:49:28,073 --> 00:49:35,771
Rym: But there's always been comedy that comes from the people who complain about the politics in Star Trek, in these newer Star Trek's like, what were you watching?

838
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:49,190
Scott: And then, you know, you have this mix going on where you sort of have the, you know, you know, serious spy stuff, right?

839
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:56,790
Rym: Like, you know, try to stop, you know, Cold War stuff, you know, the plots are actually kind of stupid and fakie.

840
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:03,648
Rym: There's always right, like megalomaniac, like exactly villain or this ridiculous magic weapon.

841
00:50:04,313 --> 00:50:05,789
Scott: Yeah, it's something on the man.

842
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:16,910
Scott: It's a mad scientist, science fiction villain mixed with the real world, you know, dictator, evil communists or whatever.

843
00:50:17,231 --> 00:50:17,854
Scott: Right.

844
00:50:17,955 --> 00:50:21,290
Scott: Autocrat, you know, villains like combined into one.

845
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:21,992
Scott: Right.

846
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:29,370
Scott: So it pulls the wacky mad scientist down a bit to where it's not just, you know, nonsense.

847
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:30,250
Scott: Right.

848
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:40,950
Scott: But it makes what would otherwise be like a really sort of uninteresting, boring, like a Tinker Tailor soldier's spy kind of spy thing.

849
00:50:41,312 --> 00:50:41,614
Scott: Right.

850
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:43,788
Scott: And makes it more fun.

851
00:50:44,331 --> 00:50:51,830
Rym: Yeah, because real spying would be more like, all right, he's dressed like a nerd and just quietly living in the city for a month writing things down.

852
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,730
Scott: Yeah, that's exciting.

853
00:50:54,671 --> 00:50:59,729
Scott: And then on top of all that, you have these sort of Bond, you know, taglines.

854
00:50:59,749 --> 00:51:01,182
Scott: don't have a cow man stirred.

855
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:03,011
Scott: Right.

856
00:51:03,332 --> 00:51:07,670
Scott: You know, Q with a funny gadget and a car that shoots a missile.

857
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:08,132
Scott: Right.

858
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:19,510
Scott: The tropes and cliches, you know, that are, you know, they bring, you know, familiarity, nostalgia, fun, you know, whatever, to connect them all together.

859
00:51:19,711 --> 00:51:28,450
Rym: Like if you've seen a few Bond movies and then you watch any random Bond movie, something in it will evoke specific memories from those other Bond movies.

860
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:34,210
Rym: Pick any three and you'll find connections between them like, oh, yeah, they all had a Gatling gun in the headlights of his car.

861
00:51:34,431 --> 00:51:35,237
Rym: All three of them did.

862
00:51:35,278 --> 00:51:36,850
Rym: Like, you'll always find something.

863
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:43,630
Scott: If you made if you tried to make some other movie and you did any of those things, like you've had a car with an ejector seat, right?

864
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:47,809
Scott: Someone's going to be like, that's a, you know, James Bond rip off right there.

865
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:48,392
Scott: Yeah.

866
00:51:48,612 --> 00:52:06,050
Scott: It's like, you know, there are movies with cars and ejector seats, but but, you know, you just can't help but think of James Bond when you see that, because even if they weren't the first to do it, it's like it's like they just have ownership over, you know, some of those those things like that in some way.

867
00:52:06,472 --> 00:52:13,070
Rym: I think it's worth pointing out that one aspect of Bond films that I personally appreciate, even though there's such a tiny part.

868
00:52:14,112 --> 00:52:19,150
Rym: I mean, the music is fine, like they have their motif that they use, but specifically the opening credits in Bond.

869
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:23,250
Scott: Yeah, it's that's one of that's one of the nostalgia, you know, things, right.

870
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:27,690
Scott: And they always they always open every James Bond movie.

871
00:52:28,133 --> 00:52:30,190
Scott: You know, you get the end media res action scene.

872
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:30,515
Scott: Yeah.

873
00:52:31,046 --> 00:52:31,250
Scott: Right.

874
00:52:31,692 --> 00:52:33,927
Scott: And then it goes, you know, right.

875
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:38,549
Scott: It comes across the thing right with the shoots, the screen, right.

876
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:52,364
Scott: The blood comes down and then there's always the opening is always some sort of really artistic, you know, thing with lots of like silhouettes of naked people swimming and some song playing.

877
00:52:52,384 --> 00:52:52,485
Scott: Right.

878
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,369
Scott: It's always a song for the movie.

879
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,350
Scott: The title of the song is the name of the movie.

880
00:52:57,032 --> 00:52:57,253
Scott: Right.

881
00:52:57,536 --> 00:52:59,470
Scott: One time, I think they got Madonna due to the song.

882
00:52:59,590 --> 00:52:59,912
Scott: Right.

883
00:52:59,932 --> 00:53:03,550
Scott: You know, it's always some big time song they pay to have made just for the movie.

884
00:53:04,331 --> 00:53:13,750
Rym: I haven't seen some of the older bonds in a while, but I think the best opening sequence I can remember from any Bond movie is actually from Skyfall, even though Skyfall itself.

885
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:17,370
Rym: the entire end of that movie is absolutely stupid.

886
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:22,370
Scott: I mean, I can't remember which opening goes with which movies, so I can't really.

887
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:27,210
Rym: It's not a particularly good song and a particularly good like the theme.

888
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:31,569
Rym: It was a card theme that all the Daniel Craig movies have a similar sort of theming to them.

889
00:53:32,851 --> 00:53:40,986
Scott: But the point is, it's you know, if you want to talk about which just the songs alone again, live and let die is a song that you will listen to.

890
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:46,730
Scott: No one's going to put on you only live twice, like just because they want to listen to that.

891
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:50,310
Rym: I am confident there are people who just listen to someone.

892
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:51,073
Scott: Well, right.

893
00:53:51,113 --> 00:53:54,190
Scott: But, you know, live and let die is like it's like Paul McCartney wings.

894
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:54,572
Scott: Right.

895
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:57,129
Scott: It's like, you know.

896
00:54:00,473 --> 00:54:01,910
Scott: So, yeah, I guess what else is there to say?

897
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,830
Scott: Like some of the best ones, right?

898
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:07,570
Scott: If I say not, you know, I already said my favorite one is live and let die.

899
00:54:07,691 --> 00:54:07,851
Scott: Right.

900
00:54:07,972 --> 00:54:11,210
Scott: Best ones are going to be, you know, Thunderball.

901
00:54:11,633 --> 00:54:12,459
Scott: Is really up there.

902
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,567
Scott: It's probably number one.

903
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:20,427
Rym: Thunderball's got a lot of very pack, like specifically tense scenes, especially when I was young and I hadn't seen a lot of James Bond movies yet.

904
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:23,619
Scott: Mm hmm.

905
00:54:24,624 --> 00:54:25,750
Scott: Let's let me look at a list of them.

906
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:26,995
Rym: Yeah, I just found a list.

907
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:30,210
Scott: I'm trying to remember which one is which and miss one.

908
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:30,710
Scott: Right.

909
00:54:32,417 --> 00:54:35,890
Scott: I could just go down the list of ones we've seen and briefly comment.

910
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:40,188
Rym: I had not seen Moonraker until I played the N64 game.

911
00:54:41,494 --> 00:54:42,650
Rym: And there was the Moonraker laser.

912
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,490
Rym: And I was like, oh, I guess I should see that James Bond movie.

913
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:52,830
Scott: Moonraker is fun for it's like if you're a kid, it's like super fun because it's all in space with lasers and Jaws and all that great stuff.

914
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:59,890
Scott: I actually had like some collectible Moonraker cards, like trading cards, which had photos from the movie printed on them.

915
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:02,830
Scott: But not really a great movie.

916
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:04,441
Scott: Think about it.

917
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:09,190
Rym: License to kill is the is the Timothy Dalton one I saw.

918
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:10,749
Rym: I never saw the living daylights.

919
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:12,457
Scott: That one has the best title.

920
00:55:13,742 --> 00:55:16,114
Scott: license to kill is the best title because that's one of the sticks.

921
00:55:16,195 --> 00:55:16,336
Scott: Right.

922
00:55:16,377 --> 00:55:17,610
Scott: Sean Connery is a license to kill.

923
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,709
Scott: That's how come you can just go around shooting bad guys and not worry about it.

924
00:55:21,172 --> 00:55:23,030
Rym: That was a fun thing about Casino Royale.

925
00:55:23,131 --> 00:55:26,007
Rym: That opening scene is him just murdering a dude to get his 007 license.

926
00:55:27,152 --> 00:55:27,313
Scott: Yeah.

927
00:55:28,018 --> 00:55:29,570
Scott: I like you only live twice a lot.

928
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:29,811
Scott: Right.

929
00:55:29,831 --> 00:55:34,395
Scott: Because the whole the whole shtick like, you know, James Bond fakes his death and it's like a whole.

930
00:55:34,697 --> 00:55:36,630
Scott: you know, the premise is really good.

931
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:38,197
Scott: Right.

932
00:55:38,257 --> 00:55:39,430
Scott: The man with the golden gun.

933
00:55:39,571 --> 00:55:40,053
Scott: I don't know.

934
00:55:40,113 --> 00:55:43,369
Scott: You know, it has that sort of Paradise Island thing going on.

935
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:43,991
Scott: Right.

936
00:55:44,031 --> 00:55:46,945
Rym: I worry it doesn't hold up that well as a movie like it.

937
00:55:46,985 --> 00:55:48,333
Rym: just it's a little too slow.

938
00:55:48,615 --> 00:55:50,810
Scott: It's like he's going after the man with three nipples.

939
00:55:51,171 --> 00:55:51,474
Scott: Right.

940
00:55:51,574 --> 00:55:53,428
Scott: But it's like, again, that's just really fun.

941
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,550
Scott: You know, shades of Goldfinger.

942
00:55:55,691 --> 00:55:55,832
Scott: Right.

943
00:55:56,235 --> 00:55:58,290
Scott: Somehow the bad guy is involved with gold.

944
00:55:58,591 --> 00:55:58,812
Scott: Right.

945
00:55:58,852 --> 00:55:59,495
Scott: In some way.

946
00:55:59,716 --> 00:56:03,316
Rym: Well, that's because there's these recurring stories, this recurring arcs.

947
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:04,410
Scott: Yep.

948
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:06,766
Rym: Like no time to die is all about.

949
00:56:06,786 --> 00:56:07,069
Rym: Guess what?

950
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:07,555
Rym: Specter.

951
00:56:08,748 --> 00:56:08,870
Scott: Yeah.

952
00:56:09,511 --> 00:56:11,829
Rym: And Blofeld and Blofeld and like all that nonsense is back.

953
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:14,252
Scott: Yep.

954
00:56:14,573 --> 00:56:18,389
Scott: I guess Octopussy has that whole like, you know, the island vibe going on.

955
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:19,095
Scott: Yeah.

956
00:56:19,135 --> 00:56:19,748
Scott: Setting right.

957
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:20,071
Scott: That's.

958
00:56:20,091 --> 00:56:23,890
Scott: the other thing is that the James Bond movies always have like a different international setting.

959
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:27,088
Scott: There's a lot of traveling going on between locales.

960
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:28,655
Scott: All right.

961
00:56:28,695 --> 00:56:29,588
Scott: The Fabergé egg.

962
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:30,771
Scott: Right.

963
00:56:31,094 --> 00:56:32,710
Scott: James Bond is like super worldly.

964
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:35,081
Scott: He's going all over the place to do his spy.

965
00:56:35,121 --> 00:56:46,850
Scott: different countries, you know, and you get to see architecture and, you know, the, you know, local markets and, you know, industrial places that you get to see just a lot of stuff in these movies.

966
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:51,790
Scott: You know, you get some of the fun that you get by actually traveling the world.

967
00:56:52,312 --> 00:56:55,230
Scott: You sort of feel that a little bit when you watch pretty much any one of these.

968
00:56:55,370 --> 00:57:00,450
Scott: I don't think there are any that take place like strictly like in like London only.

969
00:57:00,853 --> 00:57:02,130
Scott: It's like he only goes to London.

970
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:03,497
Scott: It's like go to the like.

971
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:04,262
Scott: there's any.

972
00:57:04,302 --> 00:57:07,650
Scott: you know, I can't remember if you actually I used to do any do any spying there.

973
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:08,950
Scott: It's usually somewhere else.

974
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:09,091
Scott: Yeah.

975
00:57:09,131 --> 00:57:11,550
Rym: Bond wouldn't work as like a one room play.

976
00:57:12,271 --> 00:57:14,729
Rym: Like no, no, no story they tell could work like that.

977
00:57:15,512 --> 00:57:17,810
Rym: It's always like, oh, we figured out the problem in London.

978
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:20,586
Rym: Now we've got to go to Jakarta to meet the guy to do the thing.

979
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:26,290
Scott: I forget which one it was.

980
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:31,609
Scott: Was it Tomorrow Never Dies or was it The World Is Not Enough that had...

981
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:32,585
Rym: What happens in it?

982
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:40,770
Rym: Because I watch most of the older ones, all the Roger Moore ones, I mostly watch on my grandparents giant projection TV when I was young.

983
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,530
Scott: It was it was The World Is Not Enough.

984
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:45,670
Scott: And all I could remember from The World Is Not Enough, 1999.

985
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,829
Rym: Yeah, that's I don't think I saw that one.

986
00:57:47,871 --> 00:58:04,740
Scott: All I remember from that is that Denise Richards, who is really hot, like, wow, there's always which is the other aspect of Bond movies that perhaps, you know, especially the older ones that does not hold up so well is Extreme Misogyny and Male Gaze.

987
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:08,279
Scott: There's always several Bond ladies going on.

988
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:09,148
Scott: Yeah.

989
00:58:09,168 --> 00:58:09,270
Scott: Right.

990
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,740
Scott: The fact that they're even called Bond ladies as if tells you everything.

991
00:58:13,441 --> 00:58:21,439
Rym: So later Bond property, later Bond movies would try to either poke fun at that concept or invert it with varying degrees of success.

992
00:58:22,304 --> 00:58:24,000
Scott: Yeah, well, not in 1999.

993
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,383
Scott: They weren't.

994
00:58:24,464 --> 00:58:26,520
Rym: No, but like no time to die.

995
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:39,968
Rym: It was interesting because Bond meets a Bond woman at the point in a Bond movie where there would be that scene and she sits down and she takes off her wig and she starts undressing a little bit.

996
00:58:39,988 --> 00:58:41,100
Rym: And he's like, you're moving fast.

997
00:58:41,221 --> 00:58:43,359
Rym: And she's like, well, this is how you normally do, don't you?

998
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,479
Rym: Hi, I'm the 007 like they just inverted on him.

999
00:58:46,882 --> 00:58:49,080
Rym: Then he meets another woman who he thinks is a Bond woman.

1000
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,420
Rym: She's a CIA agent.

1001
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,620
Rym: Every woman he meets is as skilled as him and is trying to trick him to do something.

1002
00:58:54,761 --> 00:59:02,400
Scott: Yeah, I mean, there were examples of that in older movies where the, you know, the Bond woman wasn't just some like, you know, do nothing.

1003
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,645
Rym: But you just said it was.

1004
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:04,749
Rym: it was always a wasn't.

1005
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:08,134
Rym: just like they'd have one exactly quality one.

1006
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:08,781
Rym: Right.

1007
00:59:08,861 --> 00:59:09,423
Scott: There would be.

1008
00:59:09,604 --> 00:59:14,181
Scott: there would be women who were capable spies, you know, on their own.

1009
00:59:14,262 --> 00:59:14,462
Scott: Right.

1010
00:59:14,543 --> 00:59:20,640
Scott: Strong and active and CIA agents or, you know, other aid, you know, cooperating agents of some kind.

1011
00:59:21,042 --> 00:59:24,659
Scott: But there was still a sexual element to it.

1012
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:25,182
Scott: Right.

1013
00:59:26,186 --> 00:59:27,431
Scott: You know that it's like.

1014
00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:31,299
Scott: it's like, yeah, she's going to help me shoot some bad guys and then we're going to get it on.

1015
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:31,882
Scott: Right.

1016
00:59:32,203 --> 00:59:38,339
Scott: It was like, you know, or I'll be sad that she's dead and get it on with the one who's still alive at the end.

1017
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:38,681
Scott: Yeah.

1018
00:59:38,801 --> 00:59:46,560
Scott: I mean, a lot of James Bond movies end with James Bond getting it on in a train or a boat as the camera pulls away.

1019
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:47,483
Scott: Yeah.

1020
00:59:47,704 --> 00:59:49,008
Rym: They also.

1021
00:59:49,049 --> 00:59:53,739
Rym: the first third has him get it on with the first Bond woman who then dies and drives him into the plot.

1022
00:59:54,641 --> 00:59:54,821
Scott: Yep.

1023
00:59:55,643 --> 01:00:04,920
Scott: So, you know, that that element of save and bang the girl is is there and is probably, I guess, the least good part.

1024
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:12,360
Rym: Well, you know, if you want to see what like if you remove this because James Bond movies, they weren't all great.

1025
01:00:12,681 --> 01:00:16,300
Rym: Like, I enjoy them, but a lot of them are not great movies.

1026
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,399
Scott: Well, I mean, I don't think, you know, even the you know, it's like, OK, I said Thunderball was the best one.

1027
01:00:20,823 --> 01:00:22,100
Scott: Agree or disagree, whatever.

1028
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:22,401
Scott: Right.

1029
01:00:22,421 --> 01:00:24,260
Rym: It's not on my top ten movie list.

1030
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:31,340
Scott: Thunderball deserves to win the best Oscar picture in the best picture Oscar in no year.

1031
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,697
Scott: There is no year in which Thunderball is the best picture against any.

1032
01:00:37,021 --> 01:00:37,302
Scott: Right.

1033
01:00:37,723 --> 01:00:45,700
Rym: It's like, you know, so I feel like if you put that in theaters next to whatever was playing in eighteen ninety nine, you might have won an Oscar if there was an Oscar.

1034
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:48,880
Scott: Find the year with like the shittiest movies you can find.

1035
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:55,679
Scott: And I guarantee you that whatever won best picture that year that, OK, you know, it might not be that much better than Thunderball, but it's better.

1036
01:00:55,981 --> 01:01:05,013
Rym: But for because they were they were consistent enough and somehow it became an IP that Americans in particular, but also internationally, it became known.

1037
01:01:05,936 --> 01:01:10,740
Rym: not many not as many people remember the Flynn movies, which are basically knockoff bonds.

1038
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:19,564
Rym: And imagine Bond without even this barest hint of self reflection and like adaptation to the times.

1039
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:21,359
Rym: That's what the Flynn movies are like.

1040
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:30,200
Scott: Yeah, I mean, there are plenty of, you know, action movies that focus on one dude who's a spy or agent or cop or.

1041
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:30,661
Scott: Right.

1042
01:01:30,741 --> 01:01:36,955
Scott: It's like, you know, and it's like, you know, like, you know what, you know, some of them continued.

1043
01:01:37,097 --> 01:01:37,240
Scott: Right.

1044
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,440
Scott: How many diehards are there or how many lethal weapons are there?

1045
01:01:40,661 --> 01:01:41,043
Scott: Right.

1046
01:01:41,063 --> 01:01:42,512
Scott: You know, I guess, you know, they're slightly.

1047
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,433
Scott: they each have their slight differences.

1048
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:44,719
Scott: Right.

1049
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:48,500
Scott: But it's still like there's an action hero in a series.

1050
01:01:48,761 --> 01:01:48,941
Scott: Right.

1051
01:01:50,144 --> 01:01:55,014
Scott: But they weren't able to carry on for, oh, 60 to 40, 60 fucking years plus.

1052
01:01:58,021 --> 01:01:58,362
Scott: Right.

1053
01:01:59,305 --> 01:02:03,699
Scott: That's what as any movie series carried on that long, even close.

1054
01:02:05,941 --> 01:02:06,544
Rym: It's awesome.

1055
01:02:06,564 --> 01:02:16,815
Scott: I mean, we could see with the explosion, I guess Star Wars is, I guess, like 10, 20, 10 to 20 years younger, but it has way less movies, way less.

1056
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:21,900
Scott: James Bond is like three or four or five times as many movies as Star Wars does.

1057
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:22,759
Scott: Star Wars is nine.

1058
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:23,802
Scott: Yeah, of course.

1059
01:02:23,863 --> 01:02:40,020
Rym: Now what we could see, it'll be really interesting to see if there start to be Bond TV shows or TV movies or streaming things instead of just pure traditional theatrical releases like every other company that owns a long running IP is doing.

1060
01:02:40,563 --> 01:02:42,500
Scott: Well, there was James Bond Junior.

1061
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,259
Rym: There was James Bond Junior.

1062
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:48,360
Scott: And was there I think there's James Pond, I believe.

1063
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,380
Rym: I mean, there's lots of parodies of James Bond.

1064
01:02:52,181 --> 01:02:55,680
Scott: James Pond, underwater agent for the the Sega Genesis.

1065
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:02,600
Rym: I know there were one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine James Bond movies before Star Wars was in theaters.

1066
01:03:02,942 --> 01:03:03,740
Scott: Yes, exactly.

1067
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:05,903
Scott: There was.

1068
01:03:05,923 --> 01:03:11,594
Scott: I also wonder, right, you know, all these James Bond video games, you know, especially Goldeneye for N64.

1069
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:12,821
Scott: Right.

1070
01:03:12,881 --> 01:03:16,704
Rym: But also I think, you know, I make fun of that game because, you know, I had a computer at the time.

1071
01:03:16,865 --> 01:03:30,120
Rym: But if you ignore the fact that, yes, technically there were computer FPS is if you were lucky enough to have a computer back then for most people in that era, Goldeneye was possibly the greatest video game they had ever seen.

1072
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:38,082
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, but it's like if not for Goldeneye, would James Bond have carried on?

1073
01:03:38,684 --> 01:03:42,962
Scott: Yeah, because remember, Goldeneye would have been able to make it from the 90s to the 2020s.

1074
01:03:44,341 --> 01:03:51,460
Rym: Well, Goldeneye, because also the movie remember Timothy Dalton might have killed James Bond like after license to kill.

1075
01:03:51,602 --> 01:03:52,740
Rym: That was nineteen eighty nine.

1076
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,460
Rym: Goldeneye was nineteen ninety five.

1077
01:03:54,902 --> 01:03:58,540
Rym: You can go read a Wikipedia article on why there weren't Bond movies during that period.

1078
01:03:59,422 --> 01:04:00,832
Rym: A lot of it had to do with Bond.

1079
01:04:00,852 --> 01:04:02,100
Rym: wasn't that popular anymore.

1080
01:04:02,742 --> 01:04:05,240
Rym: And a lot of people were blaming Timothy Dalton or the writing.

1081
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,940
Rym: There was a lot of debate as to what was going to happen to James Bond.

1082
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:15,559
Rym: Pierce Brosnan and that franchise, like for whatever reason, nineteen ninety five was the year Bond exploded again.

1083
01:04:16,943 --> 01:04:19,460
Rym: It could just as easily have been a flop and ended Bond.

1084
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:24,930
Scott: Yeah, especially when you think about like the amazing movies that came out in nineteen ninety five.

1085
01:04:24,951 --> 01:04:25,600
Scott: Right.

1086
01:04:27,366 --> 01:04:27,898
Scott: You know, you had.

1087
01:04:30,202 --> 01:04:33,180
Rym: I got to make sure I don't say a nineteen ninety six or nineteen ninety seven movie.

1088
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,347
Scott: No, I think it was not.

1089
01:04:34,407 --> 01:04:36,140
Scott: I think it was ninety four were the good movies.

1090
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:36,241
Rym: Yeah.

1091
01:04:36,262 --> 01:04:37,380
Rym: Scott is going to say ninety five.

1092
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,880
Rym: You got Batman forever.

1093
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:39,624
Rym: No, no.

1094
01:04:39,705 --> 01:04:41,020
Scott: Ninety four was the Rangers.

1095
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:42,401
Scott: Yeah.

1096
01:04:42,843 --> 01:04:45,400
Scott: Oh, Johnny, I think it was ninety three and ninety four.

1097
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,450
Scott: So I guess maybe that's what happened.

1098
01:04:47,511 --> 01:04:51,039
Scott: is that, you know, in ninety three, ninety four, all those good movies came out.

1099
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:51,723
Scott: Right.

1100
01:04:52,245 --> 01:04:55,600
Scott: And then, you know, people are, you know, big on movies.

1101
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:59,820
Rym: And then in ninety five, there's less Ventura to the net.

1102
01:05:00,467 --> 01:05:01,320
Rym: Oh, oh, twelve monkeys.

1103
01:05:01,741 --> 01:05:06,200
Scott: OK, it's not like every movie was good, you know, or bad.

1104
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,258
Rym: Twelve Monkeys was good.

1105
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:10,065
Rym: Billy Madison was good.

1106
01:05:10,105 --> 01:05:14,962
Rym: by a very narrow definition of it's the second best Adam Sandler movie.

1107
01:05:16,408 --> 01:05:21,079
Scott: Yeah, no, but like ninety three and ninety four were like some of the biggest movie years ever.

1108
01:05:21,881 --> 01:05:22,183
Rym: Right.

1109
01:05:22,203 --> 01:05:24,719
Rym: Tommy Boy, ninety five and a lot of movies that I remember.

1110
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:28,499
Scott: Yeah, I made you say you were the right age then.

1111
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:36,020
Rym: Yeah, that was an era when I was still going to the theater a lot and I had a lot of free time and I saw a lot of these movies in the theater.

1112
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:46,180
Scott: Yeah, but I guess if ninety five had had weaker competition, seven, the Brady Bunch, Crimson Tide, The First Night, Waterworld.

1113
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:48,425
Scott: Yeah, maybe that.

1114
01:05:48,465 --> 01:05:52,020
Scott: maybe it was timing that helped out to Goldeneye there a bit as well.

1115
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:52,583
Scott: Who knows?

1116
01:05:52,725 --> 01:05:54,479
Rym: A lot of big blockbusters in that time.

1117
01:05:55,461 --> 01:05:59,840
Rym: Also, there's a lot going on then, but also it was a reimagining of James Bond.

1118
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,413
Rym: It turned him into a wizard, which at least worked like.

1119
01:06:03,453 --> 01:06:08,260
Rym: that was an era when movie effects were getting better and they could pull off crazier effects.

1120
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:17,220
Rym: You got to say as much as I don't like Pierce Brosnan Bond movies, the action scenes are a lot tighter than the Sean Connery action scenes.

1121
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:26,099
Rym: If you watch a Sean Connery Bond movie on a modern 4K screen, like a Blu-ray of it, the effects don't look great.

1122
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:48,320
Scott: Well, for the time, though, it's I think, you know, the James Bond movies in terms of Hollywood effects and production occupy this place where, you know, they're not at the absolute Star Wars pushing the boundaries of what can be done right with with cameras and, you know, technology, computers.

1123
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:48,882
Scott: Right.

1124
01:06:49,284 --> 01:06:52,240
Scott: But what they are is high, high budget.

1125
01:06:52,604 --> 01:06:53,960
Scott: They always have a lot of money.

1126
01:06:54,141 --> 01:06:57,580
Rym: They were doing the best they could do for that era for like that.

1127
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:04,000
Scott: Showing you like the best of what can be done with the established right stuff.

1128
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:04,462
Rym: Yeah.

1129
01:07:04,482 --> 01:07:08,780
Rym: Like if you think a car, if you watch a Sean Connery car chase and you're like, that wasn't that great.

1130
01:07:08,841 --> 01:07:09,940
Rym: I could see the rear projection.

1131
01:07:10,341 --> 01:07:15,239
Rym: Go watch any other car related scene from any movie released in that same year.

1132
01:07:17,484 --> 01:07:17,725
Scott: Yep.

1133
01:07:17,745 --> 01:07:19,652
Scott: So, you know, that's it's like it's always.

1134
01:07:19,712 --> 01:07:26,438
Scott: it's like a showcase of like, you know, not some, you know, push the the art form forward deal.

1135
01:07:27,361 --> 01:07:41,300
Scott: But it's like, you know, take the established right techniques that we and equipment and technology that you already have and just throw money at them, do it the best that it can be done by the book that's already been invented.

1136
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:41,882
Scott: Right.

1137
01:07:41,902 --> 01:07:44,339
Scott: So James Bond wouldn't do like a Tron.

1138
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:45,304
Scott: Right.

1139
01:07:45,325 --> 01:07:45,920
Scott: Right.

1140
01:07:46,522 --> 01:07:46,784
Scott: C.G.

1141
01:07:46,845 --> 01:07:48,480
Scott: before it's good ideal.

1142
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:57,820
Rym: I guess the way it feels is if you watch original Star Wars movies, the lightsaber fights are like they work, but they're not great.

1143
01:07:58,663 --> 01:08:00,880
Rym: Like just the way the actors move.

1144
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:01,644
Scott: They were great.

1145
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:03,680
Scott: If you watch them, then they were.

1146
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,180
Rym: But they weren't even anything better.

1147
01:08:05,341 --> 01:08:10,160
Rym: But they weren't even great by like sword fighting from contemporary movies standards.

1148
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:12,260
Scott: What you know about sword fighting.

1149
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,483
Rym: True, true.

1150
01:08:14,065 --> 01:08:18,654
Rym: But like watch, I don't know, Obi Wan's fight with Darth Vader and then immediately watch.

1151
01:08:18,674 --> 01:08:19,059
Rym: I don't know.

1152
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:20,618
Scott: That's like the weakest one.

1153
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,182
Rym: It is.

1154
01:08:21,443 --> 01:08:24,100
Rym: But then but but that's also the best Star Wars movie.

1155
01:08:26,362 --> 01:08:31,301
Rym: So watch that and then watch, I don't know, Yoda fighting someone from a later Star Wars movie.

1156
01:08:31,823 --> 01:08:35,037
Rym: And you can see a lot of differences and you can make a lot of comparisons.

1157
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:45,299
Rym: and the just the cinematography science is not quite as tight in the old movie in terms of like how to make the action scene look actiony.

1158
01:08:45,884 --> 01:08:47,120
Rym: But it's still a good scene.

1159
01:08:47,483 --> 01:08:49,660
Rym: And that's what I would say about the old Sean Connery bonds.

1160
01:08:50,402 --> 01:08:58,620
Rym: Like there's still even if you can see he's clearly driving in a fake car with the rear projection, the scene still like pulls you in.

1161
01:08:58,781 --> 01:09:02,238
Rym: You still like kind of forget that and start to be like, oh, shit.

1162
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:12,841
Rym: When like he takes a sharp corner, the the the plausible like your body and your brain will agree that it is still a compelling scene despite seeing the seams around the edges.

1163
01:09:13,765 --> 01:09:16,819
Rym: That is the most high compliment I can give to old Bond movies.

1164
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:19,078
Scott: Well, I mean, consider this.

1165
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:19,321
Scott: Right.

1166
01:09:19,341 --> 01:09:21,515
Scott: So Thunderball came out in sixty five.

1167
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:22,844
Scott: Right.

1168
01:09:23,185 --> 01:09:24,819
Scott: And he's got the scene with the jet pack.

1169
01:09:24,981 --> 01:09:25,202
Scott: Right.

1170
01:09:25,282 --> 01:09:28,559
Scott: And it's like by today's standards, it's you know, it's OK.

1171
01:09:28,962 --> 01:09:31,200
Scott: I can see what you did, how you made the jet pack happen.

1172
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:34,100
Rym: I mean, the rocket here was in nineteen ninety one.

1173
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:36,580
Rym: And that jet pack scene does not look that much better.

1174
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:37,721
Scott: No, it doesn't.

1175
01:09:37,944 --> 01:09:41,080
Scott: But also look at other movies from nineteen sixty five.

1176
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:41,402
Scott: Right.

1177
01:09:41,462 --> 01:09:42,460
Scott: Like sci fi movies.

1178
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:42,921
Scott: Like what?

1179
01:09:43,585 --> 01:09:46,600
Scott: I've never seen any of these that I just googled up.

1180
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:47,180
Scott: Right.

1181
01:09:47,301 --> 01:09:54,247
Scott: But, you know, Nightcrawler from outer space, I guess, you know, it's like crack of the world.

1182
01:09:54,309 --> 01:09:55,319
Scott: I even know what that's about.

1183
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,400
Scott: Voyage to the prehistoric planet.

1184
01:09:57,581 --> 01:10:00,980
Scott: It's like those are probably even more hackneyed looking.

1185
01:10:01,343 --> 01:10:03,020
Rym: Hey, Frankenstein meets the space monster.

1186
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:14,520
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to hazard a guess and say that those are not pulling off the, you know, the dude in a dude in a costume or whatever thing, you know, very well.

1187
01:10:16,525 --> 01:10:16,565
Rym: So.

1188
01:10:16,585 --> 01:10:24,619
Rym: But yeah, what I guess I actually of all the James Bonds, I have enjoyed watching the Daniel Craig ones that I watched, which is only three of them.

1189
01:10:25,363 --> 01:10:30,323
Rym: And now after the show, I have this weird urge to go back and watch some older Bond movies.

1190
01:10:30,343 --> 01:10:36,200
Scott: Yeah, I feel like, you know, it would not be a waste of time, even if some of these, you know, are not the greatest.

1191
01:10:36,342 --> 01:10:36,566
Scott: Right.

1192
01:10:36,606 --> 01:10:37,480
Scott: Like Timothy Dalton.

1193
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:38,022
Scott: Right.

1194
01:10:38,042 --> 01:10:40,000
Rym: Some of these I just have like Timothy Dalton.

1195
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:44,220
Rym: I remember this long scene with a helicopter and literally nothing else.

1196
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:48,880
Scott: Yeah, I feel like it's really, you know, well, I said none of these are Oscar winners.

1197
01:10:49,142 --> 01:10:49,954
Scott: Maybe some of them are.

1198
01:10:49,994 --> 01:10:50,319
Scott: I don't know.

1199
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,680
Scott: But I feel like it's not a waste of time to watch all of them.

1200
01:10:54,740 --> 01:11:01,081
Scott: Really, you know, maybe maybe I'll go back and catch up on, you know, whatever I want.

1201
01:11:01,162 --> 01:11:01,684
Rym: You know what?

1202
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:05,884
Rym: You could get away with watching the first one that each actor made because.

1203
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:09,399
Rym: They tend to be pretty similar.

1204
01:11:10,701 --> 01:11:14,079
Rym: Like the Sean Connery Bond movies didn't change that much from beginning to end.

1205
01:11:17,527 --> 01:11:18,958
Rym: From what I remember, I have not seen Dr.

1206
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:19,541
Rym: No.

1207
01:11:21,207 --> 01:11:24,959
Rym: Since I watched it on a TV at my grandma's house.

1208
01:11:26,541 --> 01:11:27,043
Scott: Yeah, Dr.

1209
01:11:27,084 --> 01:11:28,390
Scott: No, you know, is one of those.

1210
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:31,236
Scott: it's, you know, it's more mad scientisty if you couldn't tell by the title.

1211
01:11:31,298 --> 01:11:31,440
Scott: Right.

1212
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,579
Scott: It's, you know, it's with that the rocket at the end.

1213
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:37,683
Scott: Yeah, it's like that's that's, you know, that for a kid, at least that makes it real exciting.

1214
01:11:37,905 --> 01:11:40,320
Scott: You know, the same way that Moonraker is exciting for a kid.

1215
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,482
Scott: Yeah.

1216
01:11:42,324 --> 01:11:50,580
Scott: Anyway, so, yeah, James Bond, I think, you know, you know, it's a unique, you know, other big media property.

1217
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,419
Scott: I think it's unique in a lot of ways.

1218
01:11:53,243 --> 01:11:55,640
Scott: It has positive and redeeming aspects.

1219
01:11:55,862 --> 01:11:57,920
Scott: It has bad aspects.

1220
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:02,077
Scott: But I guess, you know, whether we want it to or not, it's going to.

1221
01:12:02,138 --> 01:12:06,441
Scott: they're going to keep making it as long as people keep putting money behind it and people keep going to see it.

1222
01:12:07,164 --> 01:12:11,642
Scott: And I think the only thing that could really kill it is if, you know, newer is interest.

1223
01:12:11,822 --> 01:12:16,959
Scott: Oh, if older generations die and newer generations don't pick up on it.

1224
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:32,497
Scott: You know, I guess if you didn't have a mom who is a super James Bond fan putting it on all the time and you happen to also like it or if you haven't seen any, you probably I would recommend that you do.

1225
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:33,321
Scott: It's it's.

1226
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:39,262
Scott: you know, it's not as worth your time as watching legendary movies of, you know, the greatest.

1227
01:12:39,403 --> 01:12:46,820
Scott: But, you know, your life is, you know, it's short, but it's long enough that you've got time to watch some James Bond.

1228
01:12:51,943 --> 01:12:54,080
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1229
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:59,239
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando Kay for the logos.

1230
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,640
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1231
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,560
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1232
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,320
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1233

1234
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,079
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1235
01:13:20,361 --> 01:13:23,260
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1236
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:34,783
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this end of hiatus GeekNights episode are Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyce, Link Idji, Dread Lily, Tenebrae and a bunch of people who really don't want me to say their names.

1237
01:13:34,823 --> 01:13:45,602
Rym: Chris Haddad, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Dex, Finn, Help Computer, Kishaya85, Rebecca Dunn, Review Madbull, 34 Coward, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Harl, Taylor Braun.

1238
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:50,628
Rym: The next station is Wellesley, Wellesley station and several people whose names I will not say.

1239
01:13:50,648 --> 01:13:51,579
Rym: We're back.

1240
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:56,120
Rym: Expect us to be on our pretty much regular schedule for a while.

1241
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:06,266
Rym: I think we have enough in the hopper, though we'll have forgotten, as is GeekNights tradition, every possible opening bit, every possible anecdote, whatever you just got from this episode.

1242
01:14:06,793 --> 01:14:07,199
Rym: That was it.

1243
01:14:07,521 --> 01:14:09,340
Rym: We'll be grasping at straws come Monday.

1244
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:11,634
Rym: But for now, I leave you simply with...

1245
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:41,258
Scott: Who's the friendly little bee playing oh so happily, buzzing here and buzzing there, easy buzzing everywhere, Maya loves and Maya cares, Maya gives and Maya shares, Maya likes to play around, but she'll never let you down, Maya the Bee.

1246
01:14:45,760 --> 01:15:03,951
Rym: Maya, Maya the Bee, see her flying through the air, buzzing here and buzzing there, saying catch me if you dare, busy buzzing everywhere, Maya the Bee, Maya the Bee.
