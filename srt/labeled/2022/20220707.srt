1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,849
Rym: It's Thursday, July 7th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:10,150
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:13,580
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,600
Rym: And this is the GeekNights Book Club.

5
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:19,120
Rym: That's a name I haven't heard in a while.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:27,300
Rym: Tonight, to quote Scott, after the Genji debacle, we have moved on to Nine Fox Gambit by Yoon Ha Lee.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,580
Rym: And tonight, we are going to talk about Nine Fox Gambit.

8
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:32,738
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:42,180
Rym: So, since, you know, we've only done... If we take out the average number of book club books per year, that stat looks great until recently.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:50,020
Rym: So, if you're not familiar, just to be very clear, we are going to assume that you have already read Nine Fox Gambit.

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,760
Rym: So, we're not going to explain the plot.

12
00:00:53,283 --> 00:00:54,620
Rym: We're not going to worry about spoilers.

13
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:59,480
Rym: We're going to talk about this book like we would among ourselves and with our friends.

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,480
Rym: And you're a friend who has read this book.

15
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:09,160
Rym: So, if you have not read this book, I would suggest you stop listening to this episode and go read Nine Fox Gambit first and then listen to this episode.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,794
Rym: But I can't stop you, I guess, so...

17
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:18,320
Scott: Yeah, if you really just want to hear people talk about a book you haven't read or partially read, I mean, that's your choice.

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,220
Rym: I mean, I did read How Attack on Titan Ends to decide if I would continue watching it.

19
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:23,642
Rym: And you know what?

20
00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:25,794
Rym: I didn't continue watching it after reading that, so...

21
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:31,359
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, the deal was, you know, we've had this book club thing going on.

22
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:36,820
Scott: We had the Tale of Genji debacle, where it took way too long to read for a number of reasons.

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,580
Scott: And then after that, you know, we alternate choosing books, right?

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:50,880
Scott: So, Rym chose City We Became, which was, you know, we discussed, you can go listen to our episodes about that to discuss whatever you got to hear about that one.

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,120
Scott: And then it was back to me, it was back to me again.

26
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,639
Scott: And I was the one who... I chose the Genji.

27
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:58,980
Scott: I take the full responsibility, right?

28
00:01:59,282 --> 00:02:03,120
Rym: But you could not have foreseen a global pandemic, like getting rid of my commute.

29
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:04,163
Rym: Not

30
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:26,479
Scott: at all, but if I had, you know, if I had chosen differently, chosen a very easy to read, small fantasy sci-fi novel like A Good Nerd, and not the first novel ever written by humans ever, in another language, in an archaic style of that foreign language, and then translated, that is very long,

31
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:31,635
Rym: Well, you did also choose the unabridged version, and two, there's no...

32
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,619
Scott: You always gotta choose an unabridged version.

33
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:39,580
Rym: All I'm saying is, if push comes to shove, there is an unabridged Count of Monte Cristo.

34
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:45,440
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, you know, I take responsibility for that choice, right?

35
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:50,671
Scott: And to make up for that choice, I said, "All right, well, it's my turn

36
00:02:50,732 --> 00:02:51,014
Scott: again.".

37
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:59,279
Scott: This seems unfair that it was my turn for two years plus, then it was Rym's turn for like a month.

38
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,056
Rym: I mean, it's still Scott Johnson's turn in that 5 game.

39
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,453
Scott: And then it was my turn again already, and it's like, "Well, this seems wrong.

40
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:06,979
Scott: What should I do?

41
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,513
Scott: Should I give Rym more picks because I make up for all that

42
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:10,998
Scott: time?".

43
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,179
Scott: Because Rym read the book slowly, too.

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
Scott: He's also partially responsible.

45
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:16,300
Rym: Oh yeah, there was a joint effort.

46
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,200
Scott: It's not like Rym finished it in a week or something.

47
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:22,100
Rym: Yeah, it was a joint effort in The Tale of Genji right there.

48
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,420
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, so I'm like, "All right, here's what I'll do to make up for it, right?

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,527
Scott: I won't even pick.

50
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:38,198
Scott: I will defer my pick because I know the listener of this show has always frequently and for a long time asked us to read one particular

51
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:38,400
Scott: book.".

52
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:39,218
Scott: And I said, "You know what?

53
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:42,547
Scott: I actually don't know anything about that book other than that.

54
00:03:42,587 --> 00:03:44,500
Scott: it's, you know, a sci-fi novel of some kind.

55
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:58,000
Scott: But I know the listener has asked many times for us to choose that book and I said, "All right, to make up for the fact that I chose Genji and we fucked it up, I'm going to choose the book the listener wants, right?

56
00:03:58,101 --> 00:03:59,559
Scott: And we'll let the listener pick this one.

57
00:04:00,184 --> 00:04:06,960
Scott: and the listener has always wanted us to read Nine Fox Gambit by Yoon Ha Lee and I didn't know what the hell it was about.

58
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,539
Scott: And then I read it and then after finishing reading it, I made the pick.

59
00:04:14,022 --> 00:04:14,466
Scott: Well, it's like.

60
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:21,860
Scott: I knew that's what I was going to pick but I finished reading it already before we did the episode on City We Became.

61
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,380
Rym: I actually finished it a while ago.

62
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:34,279
Rym: In fact, full disclosure, I will not dwell, I will not bring the second or third books into this because we only read the first one officially, but I'm pretty much almost done with all these books now.

63
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,220
Rym: I just kept going.

64
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:36,980
Scott: That's how Rym does.

65
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:45,080
Scott: If we read a book that's the first in a series as a book club book, Rym almost always, 99.9% of the time, goes on to read the entire series.

66
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:54,059
Scott: I usually will just read the one book and stop or I will wait till the whole series is done and try to read it all.

67
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,160
Scott: Sometimes finishing, sometimes not.

68
00:04:56,581 --> 00:04:59,520
Scott: But Rym, he just goes, oh, we did one culture book.

69
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,820
Scott: Time to read every culture book.

70
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,260
Scott: Oh, we read one Wheel of Time book.

71
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,078
Scott: Time to read every Wheel of Time book.

72
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,900
Rym: All 14.

73
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,500
Scott: We read one Nine Fox Gambit book.

74
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,020
Scott: Time to read the whole series, whatever that series is called.

75
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:11,980
Scott: What is the series called?

76
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:15,280
Rym: Machines of Empire?

77
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Rym: Machineries of Empire.

78
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:27,920
Scott: So Rym has read, just so you know, Nine Fox Gambit is the first in a series of books called Machineries of Empire and Rym read, I guess, this three of them?

79
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:29,719
Rym: I just finished the second one.

80
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:33,679
Scott: But there are three that have been published so far.

81
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,100
Rym: I don't know if there are more than three that are coming.

82
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,479
Rym: I have not looked into this at all.

83
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,440
Scott: But there are three, if you could read right now, there are three available.

84
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:41,900
Scott: Correct?

85
00:05:43,461 --> 00:05:44,193
Rym: As far as I can see.

86
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,937
Scott: I did not look too closely.

87
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,660
Scott: So Nine Fox Gambit is a sci-fi novel.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,340
Scott: It takes place in outer space.

89
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,399
Scott: There is a spaceship and a planet, well, space station and some spaceships on the cover.

90
00:05:58,323 --> 00:06:03,760
Scott: And it delivers on all of that, as well as delivering on many other things that are much more worthy of discussion.

91
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:18,395
Rym: Like if I had to sell it to someone who is not sold on it and it was someone who is like me, I would probably say that this is Utena Space Battle Calendar Warfare with ghosts.

92
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,119
Rym: And that's accurate and I think it would get someone who wouldn't otherwise read it to read it.

93
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,320
Scott: Alright, so the calendars, right?

94
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,955
Scott: The central, you know, there's a lot of themes obviously because it's really boring to have a book which is sort of one idea.

95
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:37,660
Scott: If you only have one thing to say, that's not a whole novel, right?

96
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:39,580
Rym: That's a Ray Bradbury short at that point.

97
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,660
Scott: Right, exactly.

98
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:50,080
Scott: You gotta have a whole lot of things to say but, you know, swirl those around as side threads around your core central thread and the central thread being colonialism, right?

99
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,340
Scott: You know, imperialism, et cetera, right?

100
00:06:54,222 --> 00:07:04,319
Scott: And using the calendar as sort of, you know, a type of magic slash technology really fits well with that.

101
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:13,619
Scott: because if you think about the history of the world, you think about things like, you know, Jews having a lunar calendar or a lot of countries having lunar calendars, right?

102
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,920
Scott: East Asia, lunar calendars, right?

103
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,280
Scott: Aztec Maya calendars, right?

104
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,286
Scott: Things of that nature.

105
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:33,320
Scott: is that, you know, historically when humans have colonized, invaded other humans, they replaced their calendar that those people are using and now forced those people to live by their calendar, right?

106
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:42,820
Scott: So imagine if there was an island in the Pacific Ocean that we had never discovered somehow and there were people living on it, or maybe Atlantis is real, we find it, right?

107
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,740
Scott: We go there, we, you know, we're talking about replacing people's language, right?

108
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,280
Scott: So we can communicate with them, right?

109
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,240
Scott: But we might not replace their language, right?

110
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,139
Scott: We might just, you know, have translators.

111
00:07:54,242 --> 00:08:04,640
Scott: But, you know, if we were to colonize them or even soft colonize them, you know, maybe they're living, like, maybe they don't go by days, you know, 'cause they're at the bottom of the sea.

112
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,660
Scott: They don't even see the sun coming up, right?

113
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,600
Scott: It's like they go by the tide, right?

114
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,880
Scott: So every time the tide comes in and out, that's a new cycle for them of whatever their thing is, right?

115
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:26,820
Scott: And then they count, I don't know, ten of those, 'cause ten, they still, you know, they arrived and realized decimal numbers are great, even though their math developed separately.

116
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:29,738
Scott: And so every ten tide changes, right?

117
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:34,760
Scott: You know, they take a day off of ocean work, right?

118
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,558
Scott: You know, it's like that's how they live.

119
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:44,020
Scott: We come down there and we start doing things by the, you know, seven days a week with the sun doing days and the movement of the Earth.

120
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:54,040
Scott: It's like, and we force that upon them, right, is now we can now change their way of life to match our way of life by imposing our calendar upon them.

121
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,100
Rym: - And in this way, this entire book is an allegory to that.

122
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:07,800
Rym: and that allegory, interestingly, compared to many similar allegories in literature, holds up even to absurd extremes.

123
00:09:08,102 --> 00:09:16,720
Rym: and you can almost read this book as taking that allegory and treating the allegory as literal truth and then exploring every possible edge case.

124
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:19,539
Rym: and it kind of continues to work.

125
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:29,120
Scott: - Right, in this universe, right, living according to a particular calendar results in, like, actual power, right?

126
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:43,560
Rym: - Yep, like the more people in a place follow a very specific calendar and the more specific that calendar is, the more exotic powers everyone in that civilization can wield if they're within the realm of that calendar's, like, control or influence on the universe.

127
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,180
Scott: - Yeah, and also, like, people can come and, like, have heretical calendars to, like, sort of battle.

128
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,760
Scott: Like, they're battling directly with the calendars.

129
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,540
Scott: It's like in the real world, you battle with something else.

130
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:57,920
Scott: Might or money or something.

131
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,080
Rym: - Space or sex battles.

132
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:11,280
Scott: - Right, and then the calendar is just something that you, you know, impose to control after domination has occurred, but here, the calendar actually is, you know, the weapon as well, right?

133
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,679
Scott: It's like you battle with the calendar itself.

134
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,096
Rym: - Well, considering that, like-- - In order to impose it.

135
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:25,239
Rym: - One of the, 'cause the other thing this book is is if you read Iain M. Banks' culture book Use of Weapons, it's also that exact conversation.

136
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,800
Rym: What is a weapon?

137
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,479
Rym: A calendar is just another weapon.

138
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,120
Rym: Or Judeo, what's one of the first things he says?

139
00:10:31,704 --> 00:10:32,559
Rym: I am your gun.

140
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:42,240
Scott: - Yep, I mean, and in the same fashion in this book, right, when there are actual military battles in this book, 'cause there are plenty of them, both on the ground.

141
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:54,279
Scott: I mean, the book starts with a ground military battle, right, of, like, infantry battling, and it also has plenty of space battles between spaceships shooting lasers at each other - Also duels between individual people just fighting all the time.

142
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:13,058
Scott: - Right, but at least when the battles involve groups of people, right, the formations become important, right, and this actual magical slash technological power that comes from having people in formations, both, and they don't really describe the formations in detail, 'cause they don't need to.

143
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:19,500
Scott: They just get across that both the physical positions of the people relative to each other-- - And their mental states.

144
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:39,313
Scott: - As well as their mental alignment, right, with each other creates formations, and those formations have actual real world weaponry, you know, weaponry powers of some kind, and that different peoples and different groups in different formations, right, you know, have sort of a rock, paper, scissors deal kind of going on.

145
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:51,780
Scott: And so a military battle is people, you know, changing their formations, right, to sort of fight with each other, and if you think of a calendar, a calendar is really just a formation for society, right?

146
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,460
Rym: - I mean, look, right now, we're doing GeekNights because it's Thursday.

147
00:11:56,022 --> 00:11:59,140
Rym: We could've done this book club book weeks ago, almost a month ago.

148
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,820
Scott: - Could've done it in the morning.

149
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,418
Scott: - But you know what?

150
00:12:00,781 --> 00:12:04,300
Rym: We did it on Thursday, even though it probably would've been easier to do it earlier.

151
00:12:04,502 --> 00:12:05,600
Rym: The calendar has control over us, too.

152
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,459
Scott: - I'm not even working.

153
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:08,676
Scott: I'm not even working until Monday, right?

154
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,960
Scott: It's like, you know, days mean nothing for me, and I don't watch scheduled television.

155
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,900
Scott: - But in fact, we don't even question the calendar.

156
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:18,960
Rym: Like, GeekNights lined up with the Stanley Cup.

157
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,080
Rym: We didn't move GeekNights.

158
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:21,639
Rym: We just didn't do GeekNights.

159
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,760
Scott: - It seems easier.

160
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,600
Rym: - But also think about this from the perspective of society.

161
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:40,280
Rym: Like, if you conform to the sort of general way the society you live in functions, regardless of whether or not you believe in, like, that that's the right way, your life is just better.

162
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:47,811
Rym: Like, if I stopped wearing pants, I wouldn't die, but I probably wouldn't continue to be gainfully employed in the way that I am today.

163
00:12:50,264 --> 00:12:53,205
Rym: And this is, like, one of the fundamental themes of this whole book.

164
00:12:53,346 --> 00:13:10,779
Rym: is, like, this society and is it healthy and is this sustainable as a society shifts from being, in a far future, individuals making decisions within a system to individuals being nothing more than the substrate upon which the system itself exists.

165
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:22,000
Rym: One could argue that as you read this book, all these factions that get mentioned are basically intelligent, sentient gods that are just composed of a bunch of people following these formations.

166
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:29,100
Rym: And the Hexarchate, which used to be the Heparchate, or Heptarchate, is basically just this metagod.

167
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:31,240
Rym: And you even get this in detail.

168
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:50,358
Rym: Like, I love the bits when you see little snippets of parts of the universe that would be world-building that in a less well-written sci-fi novel you would get a lot of detail on, but this book does a good job of giving you just enough to get the idea and then just moving on and trusting you to have understood it.

169
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,213
Rym: But there's this idea in the cowl of the composites, and I find that fascinating.

170
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:58,139
Rym: that, you know, say in my real job, I'm a product manager, right?

171
00:13:58,443 --> 00:14:19,539
Rym: I make decisions, and I have a bunch of people who work for me and with me, but what if I merged my brain when I was at work in a machine, like a VR magic brain machine, with all of my peers, and we together formed a composite entity that made decisions like a single person, and then we signed out of that thing at the end of the day.

172
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:23,700
Rym: And it's clear that that's how senior commanders in the kelp operate.

173
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,800
Rym: They form composites instead of individuals.

174
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:38,340
Scott: And so, right, you go from that idea to what the actual story of the book is that there is a single kelp commander, right?

175
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,040
Rym: - Good old Judeo, the deuce of gears.

176
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,877
Scott: - Well, not that guy.

177
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,660
Scott: - Oh, Kel Cheris, our main character?

178
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,940
Scott: - The main character of the book, right?

179
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:54,799
Scott: And the book starts off showing you, you know, Kel Cheris in a space battle on the ground, right, and formations and all that, right?

180
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,440
Scott: Sort of, you know, get a little action intro.

181
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:58,720
Scott: -

182
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:12,380
Rym: But I gotta say, that in media res action intro, not every sci-fi book, even ones that I end up really liking hook me immediately, but I gotta say, the first few paragraphs of this book pulled me in in the same way that the first Prince of Nothing book did.

183
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,068
Rym: I read one paragraph and I backed up and said, "Wait, what the

184
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:15,372
Rym: fuck?".

185
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,660
Scott: - I get the feeling, it almost feels like they really want there to be a movie with that kind of intro.

186
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,378
Scott: - Yeah, but I like how--.

187
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,580
Scott: - They really want a movie deal.

188
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,038
Rym: - But all the details of even that initial--.

189
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,580
Scott: - 'Cause if you make any sci-fi book that becomes a movie, you have to start with a space battle, right?

190
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,800
Scott: - Star Wars, immediate space battle, right?

191
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,879
Rym: - You get a Karelian Corvette, or no, you get--.

192
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,319
Scott: - Pee-pee-pee, immediate space battle right at the start, that's what you gotta do, you know, anyway.

193
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:59,520
Rym: - But I like how these space battles too, like, in terms of trusting the audience, it will throw proper nouns at you that are not explained, but they don't need to be, because there's, just like in the Prince of Nothing and a lot of other well-written books that do this sort of thing, the context is enough to know what you need to know as a reader without having to explain it all in detail.

194
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:35,479
Scott: - If the book took the time to explain to you, like, ah, their calendar is eight days, and this day is this, and this day is that, and this is how, it's like, it would gain you, it would add nothing to the meaning, you know, or the message of the book whatsoever, it would just take up space, it would be stuff to memorize, nerds would love it, right, certain kinds of nerds who love that shit, you know, the kinds who would write RPG books would love that shit, but it would serve no purpose other than to be a boring part of the book, so they don't, it's like, all you need to know is that they have calendars, and the calendar matters, and the formations, and they matter, and it's like, that's all you need to know.

195
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:44,679
Rym: - Yep, but I like how everyone's favorite weapon in this book, which they do come up in the other books too, the threshold winnowers, those are mentioned in the first sentence of the book.

196
00:16:45,500 --> 00:17:00,879
Scott: - And they explain the effect of the threshold winnower, 'cause that's what you need to know, how dangerous and terrifying a weapon it is, and when it was used, historically, you need to know that also, to give you the correct respect for it, right, but you don't need to know how it works.

197
00:17:01,202 --> 00:17:05,038
Scott: You know, anything like that, they only tell you what you need to know.

198
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:40,640
Rym: - The most detailed description you get of a threshold winnower is, actually, there's a little quote here, quote, that returning to corpses that were only corpses, rather than radiation gates contorted against black, blasted walls and glassy rubble, eyes ruptured open, like, it does something horrible, and one thing that's interesting about all the space battles and fights and formations, in my mind, I almost imagine them like the witches in Madoka Magica, like, it is abstract, multidimensional nonsense that is happening in the literal world of this book when the calendar effects are applied.

199
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:56,457
Scott: - Oh, I actually imagine, you know, in my mind, I imagine the space battles look a lot like, you know, Starcraft, right, like, or, you know, space marines, right, but the space marines have all sorts of like, you know, like, all kinds of like, you know, superhero laser blasts and all kinds

200
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:57,984
Rym: of ridiculous things that aren't, you know,

201
00:17:58,005 --> 00:18:09,339
Scott: that aren't necessarily coming from any sort of canon, right, just be like, you know, casting magic spells at each other, like they're all the Silver Surfer or some shit.

202
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:31,760
Rym: - They kind of are, but some of these, like the variable, actually, that's from the second, a bunch of the effects that get described are like the variable geometry inside of the ships, like, clearly, they're like, just, rooms can move and be duplicated and teleported around and all sorts of ridiculous, like, rewrite the world magic from this technology, and it's never really explained.

203
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:42,479
Rym: 'cause it doesn't actually matter, you get it pretty much right away, and I just, I appreciate that because I'm so sick of reading sci-fi books that are full of a lot of world building instead of getting to the good part.

204
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,400
Scott: - Yeah, so, you got this main character, Calcheris, right, in this, in this-- - She's great, by the way.

205
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:58,539
Scott: - Yeah, there's a, there's a, there's basically, the thing that I think is really interesting is that the main character and the entire focus of the book is from the perspective of the bad guys.

206
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:07,800
Scott: It would be like a fucking, I don't know, not Darth Vader, but like, maybe, you know, some really high-ranking TIE fighter pilot.

207
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,640
Scott: Who is the, who is the silver character from the, the, the newer Star Wars sequels?

208
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,220
Rym: - Oh, God, I, I-- - The Stormtrooper one.

209
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,866
Scott: What was her name?

210
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:18,380
Rym: - I've already lost them.

211
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,040
Scott: I've, I've-- - Right, imagine if, like, that was the main character of the book.

212
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:30,545
Scott: It's like, Calcheris is, you know, not a bad person, but is necessarily, but is on the bad guys' side, and is not--.

213
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:32,724
Rym: - Well, it's interesting in that they're the bad

214
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:49,720
Scott: guys-- - Is fighting for the bad guys, and is not at all, and usually when you have that scenario in a book, nine, 99 times out of 100, it's a story of that good main character realizing they're working for the bad guys and rebelling, and something like, or revolutioning.

215
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:59,345
Scott: In this case, no, she is 100% on the side of the bad guys, is on the bad guy team, full on, and the whole story is from the focus of the bad guys, being bad.

216
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,320
Rym: - Well, I will say, I will say one thing from the future books.

217
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,559
Rym: I don't think there are good guys.

218
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,572
Scott: - There might not be, but the Heftar Kate/Ceptar Kate is definitely an evil empire.

219
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:12,441
Scott: - It is at best, it

220
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:40,060
Rym: is a moral and sort of self-perpetuating empire in the way that empires are, and there are other empires that are similarly powerful with their own calendars adjacent to it, but it definitely is, like, it is clear that these heresies come up a lot, and that this empire, not only is it doing a lot of horrible things, it is not even close to as stable as it appears to be in the start of the book.

221
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,599
Rym: Like, you figure out pretty quick how dire this whole situation is in this book.

222
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:50,040
Scott: - Well, I mean, they tell you pretty much right away, right, that, A, it used to be a Septar Kate.

223
00:20:50,340 --> 00:21:01,059
Scott: There used to be seven factions within the empire, controlling different parts of the society, and it's now a Septar Kate, not, a Heftar Kate, because they excised one of them.

224
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,085
Rym: - Hexar Kate.

225
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:03,172
Rym: now, it's six now.

226
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:04,320
Scott: - Hex, right, Hexar Kate.

227
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,052
Scott: - It used to be seven.

228
00:21:05,073 --> 00:21:05,480
Scott: - Whatever, right.

229
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:15,491
Rym: - 'Cause there's a little blur at one point where someone counts, says weeks, like two weeks, and someone else is weirded out by it, 'cause they're like, why would you say two weeks instead of 14 days?

230
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,859
Rym: That is almost heretical, what you just said.

231
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:27,775
Scott: - Yep, but anyway, the faction that was excised was the one that was responsible for, oh, morality and ethics, right?

232
00:21:27,795 --> 00:21:28,037
Scott: - Yep.

233
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,859
Scott: - So that's like, that's explicitly telling you.

234
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:41,555
Rym: - Well, I love, well, they hit you over the head with it in case you missed it, because, you know, in the whole beginning, you keep getting those transmissions between two people, you don't really know who they are about, like, what's going on.

235
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:41,979
Scott: - Oh, before, no.

236
00:21:42,621 --> 00:21:44,478
Scott: There's another thing that tells you how evil it is.

237
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:52,700
Rym: - But in one of those transmissions, eventually it gets stated out loud that it basically, the book does a thing like, you ever heard of something called the moon?

238
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:55,800
Rym: But it does that with, the heresy was called democracy.

239
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,219
Rym: Like, they just beat you over the head with it if you didn't get it up to that point.

240
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:10,400
Rym: Because in those early discussions, they talk a lot about how, oh yeah, in the fortress we took over, like, polling is going well, and a vote's gonna happen on X, and it doesn't really explain that right away.

241
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,999
Scott: - Well, I mean, the thing that really tells you how evil the empire is-- - The remembrances, what you find out what those actually are.

242
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,480
Scott: - Yes, there's the remembrances, right?

243
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,060
Scott: So, as part of their calendar, right, there's also rituals, right, that had to be performed, holidays, right?

244
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:27,494
Scott: That's a part of a calendar, too.

245
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:39,473
Rym: - I like how the book sneaks this up on you, 'cause they're pretty benign, the ones you hear about at first, and then it doesn't actually reveal to you how horrific and violent the remembrances are.

246
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:42,160
Scott: - Well, it just tells you, it basically says they're horrific and violent.

247
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,767
Rym: - Yeah, they do, like, ridiculous torture of heretics as part of these remembrances.

248
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:49,560
Scott: - Right, well, or maybe not even heretics, maybe just anyone, right?

249
00:22:49,580 --> 00:23:07,090
Scott: But the point is, yes, as part of their holidays, in order to make their calendar work, right, the calendar that they have constructed will not hold its power unless they conduct these particular remembrance rituals that involve ritual torture and sacrifice of people, right?

250
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,660
Rym: - Yep, so not a great society.

251
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:20,920
Scott: - Right, they would, some people would like to, right, there are some people who express their thoughts, like, yeah, we would like to get rid of these remembrances, even though the ethics and morals have been excised from their empire, right?

252
00:23:21,462 --> 00:23:49,635
Scott: There is sort of like, you know, a distaste for the remembrances, like, yeah, we wish we didn't have to do those, but they recognize this absolute truth that if they didn't have those, their calendar would lose all its power, and they would have to use, and it's like, well, they try to come up with a different calendar that would work without the remembrances, right, and they can't seem to come up with one, so they're just ritually torturing and sacrificing people and being okay with that, and

253
00:23:50,077 --> 00:23:50,319
Rym: so, yes.

254
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,225
Rym: - They rationalize it that there's no alternative we know of yet, and that's how they rationalize it as a society.

255
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:59,699
Scott: - But they're just chill with that, they're just like, yeah, remembrances.

256
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,160
Rym: - But it's also interesting how that sort of-- - They're the evil empire, with no question whatsoever.

257
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,441
Scott: - That

258
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:33,799
Rym: fits back into this, like, overarching theme in the book around how the Hex Arcade itself almost ends up functioning and having an inertia and a will on its own, arguably even despite the preferences and will of all the people that constitute it, like, you could have a society, but in the real world, we do have societies like this where the far majority of people want reasonable things, yet the society itself chooses the opposite of what the majority of its people want.

259
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:43,968
Rym: I'm not talking one dictator, I'm talking, like, the society itself, 'cause it's very clear as you start to see the leaders later in the book of the society.

260
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:48,180
Scott: - You see the leaders early, and I think you don't see them later on, right?

261
00:24:48,260 --> 00:25:10,160
Scott: They're like, right at the start of the book, there's this one chapter with a character who is the leader of one of the sections, one of the six groups, and it's pretty clear that even though there should be six equal leaders, it's pretty clear this person is effectively President, Emperor, King, whatever.

262
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,418
Scott: They're actually the one above the others at least by a little bit, right?

263
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:21,798
Scott: And he's gotta deal with one of the other ones, one of the other five equals, right?

264
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:28,740
Rym: - I will say in the second and third books, or at least in the second book for sure, you see a lot of their board meetings, basically.

265
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:31,140
Rym: You see a lot of them interacting with each other.

266
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,480
Scott: - I'd imagine so, right?

267
00:25:34,022 --> 00:25:42,800
Scott: And the other one he's dealing with is sort of like, I guess he comes across, I forget his name, he comes basically the guy who's keeping Jidao, right?

268
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:50,240
Rym: - Oh yeah, well there's Kujin, the guy who is basically one of the few people in the empire who figured out within this calendar a way to be immortal.

269
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:59,000
Scott: - Yeah, so that's the guy who keeps Jidao, that's the, you know, he basically comes across to me like a mad vizier wizard dude.

270
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:07,779
Rym: - Oh absolutely, that guy is, 'cause the one thing we know from this book about immortality is that he's got some way to be immortal that everyone's trying to figure out.

271
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:18,919
Rym: The other factions are trying to figure out their own ways to be immortal, and all we know is that they know a little bit about how he does it and they don't think it's a good idea and they wouldn't do it to themselves.

272
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,600
Scott: - Anyone else who's tried has suffered and died horribly.

273
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:33,560
Rym: - And we also learn toward the end of the book, like the final puzzle piece, that it's probably very similar to what they did to Jidao, our semi-main character.

274
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,749
Scott: - Well, it involved the same piece of technology, what did they call it?

275
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:38,340
Rym: - The Black Cradle.

276
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:49,800
Scott: - Yeah, the Black Cradle is what you have to, right, so really, anyone who's ever messed with the Black Cradle ended up in bad or dead shape, except for Jidao, who we'll talk about in a second.

277
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,140
Rym: - So I love how he is portrayed as insane.

278
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:58,480
Scott: - And Kujin, who became, you know, a mad, vizier, wizard, immortal dude.

279
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:18,199
Rym: - Yep, so we've got Kujin, who is immortal and appears to be insane to some degree, and then we've got Jidao, who, everyone in this society is telling us, the reader, this person is insane, but then when we meet this person, they seem perfectly reasonable and perfectly rational and that stays true all the way to the end of the first book.

280
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,302
Scott: - Yep.

281
00:27:19,322 --> 00:27:21,039
Rym: - Like, it's hard to disagree with them.

282
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,220
Scott: - Jidao did something in the past that was horrifying, right?

283
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:25,986
Rym: - Yep, I like how.

284
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:31,919
Rym: what he did was basically win a battle and then also destroy his own forces and then murder all of his staff.

285
00:27:33,704 --> 00:27:40,675
Scott: - Yep, so, yeah, so there was, Kel Cheris is just a commander in the Kel section of the Hex Arcade, right?

286
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:40,978
Scott: - Yep.

287
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:53,240
Scott: - Which is a military section, right, so they're a military-- - Yeah, what do we got, we got the Kel, the Shuos, like, that's where, that's the-- - Those are basically like the spy type, you know, people, right?

288
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,080
Scott: The intelligence, CIA type people.

289
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,540
Rym: - Yep, the rest of them, the Narai, the scientists.

290
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:58,622
Scott: - Yep.

291
00:27:58,642 --> 00:27:58,662
Scott: -

292
00:27:59,189 --> 00:27:59,696
Rym: And I think the

293
00:27:59,716 --> 00:27:59,919
Scott: rest of

294
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:04,859
Rym: them don't really come up in detail in book one, but basically they're all like--

295
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,458
Scott: - Those are the ones that, I forget the name of the--

296
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,999
Rym: - Well, there's the Rahal, there's the Vedona--

297
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,340
Scott: - The heretical, ethical, moral ones that were--

298
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,420
Rym: - Yep, and the Vedona actually come up in the first book because they enforce doctrine, they're the ones who enforce those rituals.

299
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:32,320
Scott: - Right, exactly, right, okay, so, but anyway, so you got Kel, military, basically a space marine, and she wins a battle, and apparently, you know, the president guy is like, hey, we got a problem.

300
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,537
Scott: There's, you know, completely separate from what Cheris is doing, right?

301
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:35,680
Scott: - Yep.

302
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:42,480
Scott: - He's like, look, there's this, you know, we have this space station called the Fortress of Scattered Needles, I believe, right?

303
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,840
Rym: - Yeah, 'cause the other fortress that gets mentioned is the Fortress of Spinshot Coins.

304
00:28:48,524 --> 00:28:55,240
Scott: - Right, and so, you got a culture thing already where the space station and all the ships have names and have personalities and AIs and whatnot.

305
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,940
Rym: - Yep, oh, wait a minute, we'll save the servitor talk, I got a lot to say about the servitors.

306
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:14,558
Scott: - Right, so this Fortress of Scattered Needles is a basically, it's like a huge space colony, it's not like just like a, you know, like a little tiny space station, like the International Space Station, it's like basically a floating, you know, entire colony, like an arcology, basically, right?

307
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:23,680
Scott: It's enormous, it's floating in space somewhere and it's being conquered, attacked by some heretics with a different calendar of some kind, right?

308
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:40,540
Scott: It's been infiltrated and taken over and that's not good because, you know, in terms of not just the calendar, but just the formations of their entire society, the control over that space station, its position, its behavior is important.

309
00:29:41,783 --> 00:29:48,558
Scott: and now the fact that they lost control over it means that some other calendars, some other civilizations are encroaching, right?

310
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,897
Rym: - The Haffen are coming in.

311
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,277
Scott: - Exactly, the Haffen, all we really know is that they're some other empire with a different calendar, right?

312
00:29:56,701 --> 00:29:58,260
Scott: They're heretics, right?

313
00:29:59,024 --> 00:29:59,580
Scott: They're other.

314
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,719
Rym: - And they seem to in some way be helping the heretical uprising in this fortress.

315
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,779
Scott: - But we don't know really too much about them other than that they are other, right?

316
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,960
Scott: They're enemies of the Hex Arcade.

317
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,880
Rym: - So yeah, book two, you'll learn a lot about them if you're curious.

318
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,077
Scott: - I'm sure you do.

319
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:27,154
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, the leaders of the Hex Arcade are like we gotta do something about this and in a very sort of Prince of Nothing fashion, they come before, right?

320
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:35,379
Scott: And it's like they know what they want to happen but rather than just order it to happen directly by saying do this, right?

321
00:30:35,661 --> 00:31:00,920
Scott: They set up circumstances presumably using their calendar powers and formation powers such that Calcheris, right, is set upon a path to doing what they were gonna order to happen but coming into it of like believing it was her idea and that they agreed to it and let her try

322
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,000
Rym: it.

323
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:20,120
Rym: - So what's really interesting is having read more of the books, I get the impression that it's even more so than that that it's almost like it's the same way that in a big company or a big military organization in the real world, you have to exert soft power like to get something to happen that if you ordered it outright, people would resist.

324
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:22,417
Rym: but if it happened quote unquote.

325
00:31:22,457 --> 00:31:25,780
Rym: naturally, people would just assume it came about by a consensus.

326
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:45,943
Rym: but I love how they depict that because the technology with the signifiers, like everyone's got a signifier, it's basically your, I don't know, your avatar in a chat room, you don't even get to pick it, like it picks you to a degree but then you choose, like there's this whole thing in the book of course but I like how the way they do the interviews is.

327
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:52,520
Rym: they basically get a bunch of people to each present, here's what I would do if you put me in charge of this situation.

328
00:31:52,724 --> 00:32:01,980
Scott: and everyone's got a very-- - Right, it's like the space station is being conquered, right, we gathered you all here because you're all top quality people in our empire.

329
00:32:02,523 --> 00:32:11,615
Scott: Everyone present your idea on how to solve it, right, and they just go around the room just like normal people, like what's your idea, and someone who's like really big spaceships, right, it's like--

330
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:27,100
Rym: - But what's cool is they do it anonymously and that's a big theme in these books, there are parts of this empire that are actually way more progressive than anything we have in the real world today despite the other far worse problems of the empire.

331
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:38,713
Rym: Like the way they do this process, regardless of what you look like, they hide the identities of the people, so they're only evaluated based on the quality of their plan, but at the same time, people certainly look through.

332
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:39,220
Rym: - They know.

333
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:46,820
Rym: - Some of them know, some of them clearly don't, even Cheris is like, that one's gotta be a composite the way he's talking, hmm, well the way they're talking.

334
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:53,426
Scott: - But anyway, the main problem that they're trying to solve is not just reconquer the space station, it's specifically.

335
00:32:53,446 --> 00:32:58,100
Scott: the space station has a technology called ice, the internment ice?

336
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,359
Rym: - The invariant ice, 'cause there are--.

337
00:32:59,440 --> 00:32:59,820
Scott: - Invariant ice.

338
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:14,600
Rym: - There are technologies, as you read the book, I'm assuming, that rely on the calendars, and there are far weaker, fewer technologies that are named invariant in that they work no matter whose calendar it is, like they are fundamental to the universe.

339
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:33,919
Scott: - Right, so the invariant ice, they don't really describe it too much, but you get the idea that it's basically an impenetrable ice shield of some kind, and there's basically no way through it, like nobody knows how to get through it, and the sort of an open question of, well, if the space station had invariant ice, how did it fall to begin with?

340
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,260
Rym: - Well, 'cause it fell from within.

341
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,879
Scott: - Right, exactly.

342
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:48,279
Scott: So, but now to take it from the outside, you have to beat the ice, so really what the people are presenting are not ideas on how to conquer a space station, 'cause the answer is a bunch of spaceships, right?

343
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:50,159
Scott: It's space battleships.

344
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:52,760
Scott: It's how are you gonna beat the ice, right?

345
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,047
Scott: What's your idea, right?

346
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:07,740
Scott: Whoever has the best idea will go with it, and it was basically predetermined that they knew that Kel Cheris was gonna have the idea that they wanted to go with, and it was basically predetermined that that was the idea they were gonna accept.

347
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:25,418
Rym: - Now, I would accept or believe that they didn't choose Kel Cheris ahead of time, but when the moment came, they looked at all the existing Kel who were out there from their candidate list to see which of them might be in a circumstance that we could pull them into this.

348
00:34:25,966 --> 00:34:34,020
Rym: I'll bet they had other people who were likely to make the same decision, and she was the one who happened to have just disgraced herself in their eyes and thus given them the opportunity.

349
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,260
Scott: - Right, so they go around the room, and they don't even finish going around the room.

350
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,340
Scott: They get to Kel Cheris.

351
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:41,719
Scott: She says the idea that you knew they were gonna say.

352
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,440
Rym: - I love how she's like, "I'm gonna unfreeze Judeo and have him do it,".

353
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,952
Rym: and then everyone else is like, "What the

354
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:46,900
Rym: fuck?".

355
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,100
Scott: - Yeah, other people are just like, "I leave the room, forget my idea," right?

356
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,514
Rym: - 'Cause as far as the society's concerned, yeah, one guy immediately is like, "I retract my

357
00:34:54,554 --> 00:34:54,940
Rym: proposal.".

358
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:55,868
Rym: - Yep, exactly, yeah.

359
00:34:57,022 --> 00:34:58,554
Scott: They're just like, "All right, go

360
00:34:58,574 --> 00:34:58,837
Scott: ahead.".

361
00:34:59,704 --> 00:35:01,700
Scott: They don't even ask anyone else in the room.

362
00:35:01,981 --> 00:35:03,540
Scott: They don't get all the way around the table.

363
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,740
Scott: They're like, "All right, we just had to "sort of do this formality to get this result we wanted.

364
00:35:09,101 --> 00:35:11,319
Scott: "We're here, let's not waste any more time," right?

365
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:11,837
Rym: - Yep.

366
00:35:12,724 --> 00:35:14,100
Scott: - So what does this mean, right?

367
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:20,460
Scott: So there's this dude, Judeo, who we already talked about, who fucking was like the best.

368
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:22,340
Scott: He was like the ultimate warrior.

369
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:28,139
Rym: - What is it, he has never lost-- - He has never lost a major engagement, ever.

370
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,780
Scott: - Yeah, he's basically just like, you know, the ultimate, you know, super strong, perfect dude.

371
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,739
Scott: But he's dead.

372
00:35:37,121 --> 00:35:39,060
Scott: Well, not entirely dead, right?

373
00:35:39,441 --> 00:35:45,240
Scott: He has immortality thanks to the Black Cradle, only he's not in a corporeal form.

374
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,540
Scott: He's somehow frozen in some kind of thing.

375
00:35:50,021 --> 00:35:55,758
Rym: It's not entirely-- It really feels like some sort of, "We have copied his brain into a computer "and we saved it for future

376
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:55,900
Rym: use.".

377
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,660
Scott: - Exactly, right.

378
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:01,960
Scott: They don't explain it because it's not necessary to explain it, just like they don't explain how the calendar's working for detail, right?

379
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,120
Rym: - I do like the foreshadowing of the carrion glass and the carrion gun because that comes into play in the very end.

380
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,700
Scott: - Chekhov's carrion glass.

381
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:21,340
Rym: - Yep, 'cause full circle in the very end when he basically has convinced or tricked Kel Cheris into subsuming herself into him and just giving her his body.

382
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,690
Rym: And his plan

383
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:22,972
Scott: all

384
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:42,438
Rym: along was clearly, my reading of this, just from the first book, he won those battles even if he disagreed with anything this empire was doing because his only plan was to eventually, they'll get him out and they'll put him in a situation that gives him the opportunity to destroy this fucking empire that he has hated for his entire life.

385
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:50,460
Scott: So, yeah, this dude is just, I guess, only in an incorporeal form of some kind.

386
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,600
Rym: - It's very much like, he's frozen by the Nazis.

387
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,338
Rym: Every couple hundred years, the Nazis wake him up and send him to fight a battle they don't think they can win.

388
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,579
Scott: - He's like a ghost.

389
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,979
Rym: - And every time he decides, can I win this or not?

390
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,140
Rym: And could I destroy the Nazis instead of winning this?

391
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:11,620
Scott: - He's a ghost and he possesses Kel Cheris, I guess, consensually.

392
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,337
Rym: - Yep.

393
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,118
Scott: - And when she looks in the mirror, she can see him.

394
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:16,959
Scott: There he is.

395
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,560
Rym: - And nobody else can see him except, what, Kujin?

396
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:33,914
Scott: - Yeah, nobody else really knows that he's, it just looks like Kel Cheris is walking around, only they promote Kel Cheris like some ultra-rank temporarily because she's possessed by someone who's the highest possible rank.

397
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:44,340
Rym: - Also, because of one of the most fascinating concepts in this book, other than the gender stuff and the servitors, is the formation instinct that is injected into the brains of the Kel.

398
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,680
Scott: - Yeah, we talked about the formations.

399
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,878
Rym: - No, no, the formation instinct.

400
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,640
Scott: - Well, I thought that was just like, you know, how good they are at formations.

401
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,200
Rym: - No, they could do formations without that.

402
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:54,000
Rym: They just weren't as powerful.

403
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:08,760
Rym: The formation instinct, remember, was every Kel is basically has a minor amount of brainwashing where if a Kel who is higher rank than them talks to them, they basically cannot resist whatever that person wants them to do.

404
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,959
Rym: It is like built into their brain.

405
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:24,699
Rym: 'Cause remember, there's a moment where Judeo and Cheris basically give up one of their own Kel to the heretics as part of a plot, and they revert her to fledge null, meaning they basically erase her personality.

406
00:38:25,582 --> 00:38:30,259
Rym: So she physically is incapable of interacting in any way other than name, rank, and serial number.

407
00:38:32,405 --> 00:38:45,439
Rym: And then you get the finer point when Judeo's talking about this, and I remember he mentioned something offhandedly like, "Oh, yeah, if we didn't have the formation instinct back when I was alive, alive,".

408
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:59,813
Rym: and then later you get a little tidbit around how, you know, actually, like one character, I forget who says this, but they say something like, "You know, actually, if formation instinct didn't already exist, it would be really hard to convince people that this was ethical to even do in the first

409
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:00,097
Rym: place.".

410
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,336
Rym: - Mm-hmm.

411
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:09,359
Rym: - Because in the past, at some point, the society said, "We're gonna do formation instinct in the Kel," and that was not a thing before that.

412
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:10,704
Scott: - Mm.

413
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,678
Rym: - That instinct comes up big in the second book, too.

414
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:19,778
Scott: - So anyway, the greatest general, the greatest military mind that ever lived in the evil empire, right?

415
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,199
Scott: So, I guess, Darth Vader, right?

416
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:22,623
Scott: - Yep.

417
00:39:22,644 --> 00:39:23,139
Scott: - Or whatever, right?

418
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,220
Scott: He's like a ghost, right?

419
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,299
Scott: Just like Darth Vader's a ghost.

420
00:39:27,183 --> 00:39:41,079
Scott: Imagine just some regular old Jedi gets possessed by Darth Vader, and now everyone treats that person as if they are Darth Vader, and Darth Vader's in their mind talking to them and is in them and can control their body, kinda, so--.

421
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,400
Rym: - And I gotta say, the writing on all of that is just really well done.

422
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,540
Scott: Like, the interplay between--.

423
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,100
Scott: - I mean, I think that's the kind of thing, it's hard to do that in not a book, right?

424
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,233
Scott: - Yeah.

425
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,180
Scott: - How do you do that in another medium of storytelling?

426
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:53,999
Scott: Not easily.

427
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:05,519
Rym: - I can give a few ways to, so, this is an aside, but I was talking to one of our friends 'cause we play Blades in the Dark in the Discord, and we learned of someone else's game where a character got possessed by a ghost.

428
00:40:06,063 --> 00:40:22,598
Rym: So, what they did is they had someone play the ghost in a Discord channel, and they set it up to where only the PC who was possessed could hear what the ghost was saying, and the GM could also hear it, no one else could hear it, and the player who was possessed, if they wanted to interact with the ghost, they had to just talk.

429
00:40:24,142 --> 00:40:43,760
Rym: So, no one heard what the ghost was saying, and it worked really well, and it's a lot like this situation, but the book just portrays it so well, and I like there's one scene where Cheris is getting frustrated because he's talking to her, but she's trying to figure something out, and she gets confused, and it's, there's a lot of good bits around that whole conceit.

430
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:47,798
Scott: - Anyway, so, you have to.

431
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:55,408
Scott: basically the greatest military, you know, force is this one person, like they're that dangerous that like, you know, they're like, "How about nukes?

432
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,400
Scott: Nah, not good enough.

433
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,669
Scott: "How about this one dude?

434
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,536
Scott: Oh, that'll get it

435
00:40:58,576 --> 00:40:58,738
Scott: done.".

436
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:07,508
Rym: - It'd be like if, "Oh no, "we have a Final Fantasy IV problem," and you unfreeze like the guy who's had the world record in Final Fantasy IV running for 400 years.

437
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,068
Scott: - Yeah.

438
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:17,820
Scott: So, they send this dude in Kel's body, Kel and Jidao, out to do the space battle, and the rest of the book is pretty much just space battle.

439
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,215
Scott: - Yup.

440
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,000
Scott: - You know, there's a lot of developments that happen during the space battle, right?

441
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:31,172
Rym: - It's pretty fascinating how, as a reader, one, Jidao convinces me to go along with him.

442
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:33,398
Rym: Like, I'm pretty much on board with him.

443
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:42,978
Scott: - I mean, I'm on board with him in terms of like, you know, if you want the Texarcate to win, he has the right idea.

444
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:45,639
Rym: - I pretty early on assumed.

445
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:57,220
Scott: - I'm not on board with helping them win, but it's clear that he doesn't actually like them, but everything that he's saying is like helping them win at least this immediate battle.

446
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:08,140
Rym: - I was very sure from the first third of this book and I was 100% sure by the end of this book that he was winning those battles in order to lose the war on purpose.

447
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:21,920
Scott: - Clearly, there is this inkling of unspokenness that you have this faith that this character is in it for the longest, longest term fall, right?

448
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,271
Scott: - He's playing the long game!

449
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:35,084
Scott: - Everything he's ever done has been pro-evil empire, except the one time where he won the battle and then murdered his own people afterwards, right?

450
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:35,839
Scott: The one time.

451
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:47,800
Rym: - Which arguably is a lot like I guess minor spoiler for adventure time when Finn and Jake commit a cosmic crime to go to the cosmic prison on purpose.

452
00:42:48,344 --> 00:43:01,980
Rym: I think he did something so extreme to basically force them to both kill him and because he was so good they couldn't just actually kill him, so they had to put him in the black cradle.

453
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,465
Rym: I think he orchestrated this from the beginning.

454
00:43:04,526 --> 00:43:11,556
Rym: He committed a crime so bad but was also so good at his job that they had no choice but to trap him in the black cradle.

455
00:43:11,677 --> 00:43:13,112
Rym: and then that began his long con.

456
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:20,979
Scott: - And once he has the immortality, now he can play the longest game ever of it's like you think about.

457
00:43:21,645 --> 00:43:26,086
Scott: will we live to see I don't know, China fall?

458
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:28,066
Scott: Will we live to see the US fall?

459
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,660
Scott: Will we live to see Canada fall?

460
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,316
Scott: It's like unlikely, right?

461
00:43:31,356 --> 00:43:31,902
Scott: But you know what?

462
00:43:32,084 --> 00:43:35,885
Scott: If I'm immortal, the odds of me seeing Canada fall are 100%.

463
00:43:35,885 --> 00:43:36,248
Scott: It's gonna fall.

464
00:43:37,921 --> 00:43:38,143
Scott: Right?

465
00:43:38,204 --> 00:43:40,488
Scott: It's like it's gonna happen, right?

466
00:43:40,528 --> 00:43:43,457
Scott: So it's like this evil empire, when is it gonna fall?

467
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:43,780
Scott: Ever?

468
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:44,463
Scott: Right?

469
00:43:44,564 --> 00:43:46,860
Scott: It's like well, if I'm immortal, right?

470
00:43:47,803 --> 00:44:08,999
Scott: It's like I'm gonna have opportunities at some point or how long I gotta sleep, no matter how many times they wake me up, it's like at some point, I'm either going to bring about their fall or at least if they fall while I'm asleep, it's like you know, I'll be, someone, whoever conquers them is gonna find me down here right in the Black Aldrin.

471
00:44:09,682 --> 00:44:33,077
Rym: But as a result, I was on board with him and then you see Charis get on board with him pretty quickly and to the end where she literally at least as far as it is portrayed in that second book, in that final chapter, she basically eats the carrion glass and becomes him completely and wholly so that he can continue his

472
00:44:33,097 --> 00:44:33,178
Scott: work.

473
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:36,322
Scott: Well, it's like a composite being of some kind right?

474
00:44:36,362 --> 00:44:40,143
Scott: Just like the composites they talked about earlier in the book but perhaps more so right?

475
00:44:40,647 --> 00:44:44,909
Rym: Well he's got a lot more history in his brain than she does.

476
00:44:45,758 --> 00:44:48,560
Scott: Sure but they're basically like one person now, right?

477
00:44:50,367 --> 00:45:06,852
Rym: So some aspects that stood out to me around all of that, I like how Kel Charis we get a lot about how she is from a culture that was subsumed by the Empire in a distant past, like a really really small minority group that only lives on like one planet.

478
00:45:07,479 --> 00:45:19,416
Rym: And bit by bit you get all these notes about how like, oh yeah, even the Kel were this completely unrelated spacefaring people who were probably conquered by this Empire at some point and then joined it.

479
00:45:21,108 --> 00:45:27,054
Rym: And that seems to play into the long term, like this Empire is being held together by torture and glue and little else.

480
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:34,389
Scott: It also seems like not everyone in the Empire is necessarily part of one of the six groups, right?

481
00:45:34,409 --> 00:45:42,510
Rym: It seems like Kel's Charis' family, it's like they're not Kel, they're just- Yeah, she went off to the government university and the family was like, "Your funeral, good luck, have

482
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:42,792
Rym: fun.".

483
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:46,183
Scott: Right, and it's like J'Dao changed factions, right?

484
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:51,280
Scott: It's like, it's not like, you know, it's like, it's almost like six government agencies that run everything.

485
00:45:51,520 --> 00:46:01,320
Rym: But there are just normal people, like there's that Baker who gets involved, who they take the cookies for that assassination plot, like there's just regular people living in this Empire.

486
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:02,788
Scott: Right, it's interesting.

487
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:09,095
Scott: at the only times you, because most of the book takes place in spaceships, you know, space, military spaceships, right?

488
00:46:09,155 --> 00:46:18,026
Scott: But the, on the space station, it's like there's normal people living there and you don't see much of them in their everyday life, right?

489
00:46:18,733 --> 00:46:46,330
Scott: And it's sort of what's happening in the space station is very abstract, but they sprinkle in, like, concrete details of very specific tiny events on the space station to sort of give you an overall feeling of like, you know, it's almost like a rear window deal, it's like they show you a little bit of like the lives of a few different people on the space station and then you can sort of get an idea of what the whole space station is like just from that, right?

490
00:46:46,451 --> 00:46:49,543
Rym: And I like how much that contrasts with you.

491
00:46:49,564 --> 00:47:11,200
Rym: basically have the extremely abstract geometric mathematically formulated like, nonsense happening with the battles, but then on the opposite end of that, you've got like the Kell are just hanging out in a like mess hall eating regular ass food like normal people and the juxtaposition of the extreme mathematical

492
00:47:11,382 --> 00:47:13,443
Scott: drama about what table you sit at

493
00:47:14,516 --> 00:47:18,238
Rym: and it really rounds the books in that they are just people in the end.

494
00:47:19,846 --> 00:47:31,626
Rym: and it also makes the the way combat and the way spaceships and the way all this other stuff is described feel almost even more exotic and extreme and nonsensical and I like that juxtaposition quite a bit.

495
00:47:31,646 --> 00:47:32,414
Rym: Yeah,

496
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:52,960
Scott: so the biggest insight you get into what's going on in the space station is that a bunch of the chapters begin or are entirely a letter or some sort of message from one person in the space station to this other person who is presumably the leader of this rebellion, right?

497
00:47:53,222 --> 00:48:04,173
Rym: I like how the person in the space station those letters start out pretty optimistic and then you see them sort of wavering a little bit like a little bit of blah blah blah and then toward the end of the book it's like, "Yo, we're fucked.

498
00:48:04,193 --> 00:48:04,720
Rym: Shit's fucked.

499
00:48:05,101 --> 00:48:05,950
Rym: Get the fuck out.

500
00:48:06,455 --> 00:48:06,678
Scott: Fuck

501
00:48:06,698 --> 00:48:06,860
Scott: this.".

502
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:17,400
Scott: Right, so it's like one of the people who's like part of the rebellion, you know, is like messaging the leader of the rebellion and you're only getting one half of the communication.

503
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,919
Scott: it's just the message is two, right?

504
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:25,400
Scott: It'd be like if you saw all the messages from I don't know, the deputy attorney general to like the president.

505
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,259
Rym: Yeah, but you don't see how the president responds or reacts in any way.

506
00:48:30,123 --> 00:48:30,800
Scott: Right, exactly.

507
00:48:30,962 --> 00:48:45,060
Scott: And the messages always start out with like jokes about the calendar because I guess they're working on their calendar trying to get it in order and this person is tired of the calendar changing so much as they experiment and try to figure out what works.

508
00:48:45,504 --> 00:48:52,699
Scott: and they're like, "Ah, the fifth of the cow and the fourth of the oxtail and the third of the

509
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:53,786
Scott: shark.".

510
00:48:54,921 --> 00:48:56,820
Scott: It's like they're just making fun of the calendar.

511
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,899
Rym: Yeah, it's like, "Day of the I don't even

512
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,018
Rym: care.".

513
00:49:00,242 --> 00:49:06,060
Scott: Yeah, it's like they're just writing whatever bullshit to make fun of the calendar at the start of every message, right?

514
00:49:07,023 --> 00:49:12,120
Scott: And it gets even more bullshitty as time goes on to show how their calendar is in disarray.

515
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,860
Rym: In the second book it's almost like you shift to seeing what the people who would receive those kinds of messages are thinking and doing.

516
00:49:20,966 --> 00:49:27,039
Scott: But yeah, you basically get the idea this rebellion is related to that seventh faction that broke off.

517
00:49:28,205 --> 00:49:37,040
Scott: They're trying to bring about democracy which is the Hexarchate people, some of them barely even know what the hell that means at all.

518
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,153
Scott: It's obviously heretical and they don't like it, whatever it is.

519
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:50,517
Scott: And the people on the station are trying to have elections and whatnot which is clearly at least in my mind, good.

520
00:49:51,701 --> 00:50:00,340
Scott: And there's definitely some relation between this rebellion and the seventh faction of the Hexarchate that broke away or was eliminated or whatever happened to it.

521
00:50:01,188 --> 00:50:01,919
Rym: Because you read the book.

522
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,900
Rym: That is not all resolved at the end of the book.

523
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,939
Rym: And the second book literally just picks up seconds after the first book ends.

524
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:29,017
Rym: So I guess other notable things that I think stood out to me is we should talk about the servitors but I first want to talk about pronouns and gender and all of that because at first it's a lot of gender neutral pronouns and at first I wondered if that was just an artifact of Korean language and the translation.

525
00:50:29,198 --> 00:50:40,086
Rym: but it is very clear that that is an intentional part of the story and the society because they dig into that deeper and deeper and deeper over the course of the book and in the second book even goes further.

526
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:53,562
Rym: but clearly this society has very progressive and evolved ideas of sex and gender in that people may have a man form or a woman form and their pronouns are completely separate from that.

527
00:50:53,905 --> 00:50:58,879
Rym: People use they/them specifically for plot reasons at different points compared to he/her.

528
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:03,767
Rym: that sort of thing and this is deeply ingrained into the story.

529
00:51:04,336 --> 00:51:10,035
Rym: The idea that someone's physical form actually matters way less than their signifier of who they are.

530
00:51:11,141 --> 00:51:18,379
Scott: It also shows you that you can have an evil empire that it can also be progressive in many ways.

531
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:29,995
Scott: You can have a fascist country that has free universal healthcare for its citizens who are all deemed to be good people.

532
00:51:30,056 --> 00:51:31,328
Rym: Here's a less extreme example.

533
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:42,539
Rym: Napoleonic France way more progressive legal system and way more progressive society in many areas but as we both know, extremely not that in many other areas.

534
00:51:44,446 --> 00:51:46,640
Scott: It's sort of this interesting depiction.

535
00:51:47,045 --> 00:51:50,320
Scott: There's scenes where you see when Jidao was in school.

536
00:51:50,502 --> 00:51:52,459
Scott: it seems like a normal college scene.

537
00:51:53,925 --> 00:52:01,619
Rym: Actually the school feels, all the school flashbacks feel a lot like Utena or like Tenchi-Buyo school flashbacks.

538
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:05,044
Rym: Tenchi-Buyo fits better but you haven't watched it so I couldn't.

539
00:52:05,064 --> 00:52:12,335
Scott: Well that's because the story of what was going on in the school was about rivals and who's gonna pass the test and high-screen.

540
00:52:13,082 --> 00:52:27,899
Rym: A lot of anime, especially 90s anime that were sci-fi and into the early 2000s they'll have like this vague idea of "Oh yeah, I know that person from the academy" and they'll be sort of a vague space academy that for some reason every fucking main character interacted with in some way.

541
00:52:29,282 --> 00:52:30,639
Scott: They were 11 Space Academy.

542
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,031
Rym: But the schools in this feel very similar to that.

543
00:52:34,435 --> 00:52:35,779
Rym: This whole book feels very anime.

544
00:52:37,063 --> 00:52:38,400
Scott: There's a lot of anime type stuff.

545
00:52:39,382 --> 00:52:45,778
Rym: Especially in the end when some of the formations get extremely abstract like people evaporating into literal matrix numbers and such.

546
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:58,440
Rym: But too the servitors are fascinating because they are... I would be shocked if they were not directly inspired by the drones in the culture books.

547
00:52:58,561 --> 00:53:02,860
Rym: They are like the same kind of entity like to a T and they're delightful.

548
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:03,979
Rym: I love the servitors.

549
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:07,648
Scott: There's some sort of intelligent machines.

550
00:53:07,991 --> 00:53:09,062
Scott: They're clearly sentient.

551
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:16,780
Rym: They're definitely sentient as is proven when Sherris and Jideo have them join fucking formations.

552
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:21,080
Rym: And I also like the touch of when they ask the servitors to join a formation.

553
00:53:21,585 --> 00:53:24,069
Rym: one, all the other Cal are like "The fuck?

554
00:53:24,453 --> 00:53:25,281
Rym: Servitors can't do

555
00:53:25,322 --> 00:53:25,544
Rym: that.".

556
00:53:25,867 --> 00:53:28,575
Rym: But not only do they ask them, but they ask them.

557
00:53:28,635 --> 00:53:30,480
Rym: They want the servitors consent.

558
00:53:31,903 --> 00:53:32,106
Scott: Yep.

559
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:33,444
Scott: But I think the other thing is that the book makes...

560
00:53:33,464 --> 00:53:34,110
Rym: And the servitors are surprised.

561
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,189
Rym: The fact that they're like "What are you... You want our consent?

562
00:53:36,209 --> 00:53:36,492
Rym: Okay.

563
00:53:36,774 --> 00:53:37,379
Rym: Interesting.".

564
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,749
Scott: But the book makes a frequent point that there's these AI servitors.

565
00:53:42,112 --> 00:53:43,100
Scott: Serv is in their name.

566
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:49,588
Scott: They exist just to serve the Hexarchate the way Rosie the Robot serves the Jetsons.

567
00:53:49,648 --> 00:53:54,380
Rym: And it is clear that when Jideo was alive, they were not yet sentient.

568
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:59,120
Rym: And they are now, in this future from that time, definitely sentient.

569
00:53:59,860 --> 00:53:59,963
Scott: Right.

570
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:08,234
Scott: But also, it seems like almost everyone, or literally everyone in the entire Hexarchate just sort of ignores them as if they're not sentient.

571
00:54:08,335 --> 00:54:16,034
Scott: As if they're just these automated robots that clean the hallways and cook food and do shit like that.

572
00:54:16,075 --> 00:54:17,507
Rym: Except Cal.

573
00:54:18,763 --> 00:54:23,225
Rym: Cal, and especially Cheris, she just thanks them when they do stuff for her.

574
00:54:23,265 --> 00:54:24,054
Scott: Cal Cheris, yes.

575
00:54:24,195 --> 00:54:31,791
Rym: But what's fun about that is, when you get servitor scenes, I like how they notice that, and they all really like her as a result.

576
00:54:32,337 --> 00:54:33,229
Scott: Right, well that's the thing.

577
00:54:33,635 --> 00:54:42,324
Scott: That is used as a device to sort of make Cal Cheris seem like a good person, as different from the other people.

578
00:54:42,606 --> 00:54:54,379
Scott: It's like she actually cares, has some sort of morality, is able to recognize that the servitors are sentient beings that no one else recognizes.

579
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,705
Scott: That she can care for others.

580
00:54:56,725 --> 00:54:59,433
Scott: And no one else is doing this.

581
00:54:59,454 --> 00:55:08,478
Scott: And it sort of sets her apart as the main character that she does this, and befriends all these robots, more so than she befriends other people in the Hex Arcade.

582
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:19,960
Scott: And, in return, they like her for it, and they help her, and they're like, R2D2s and whatnot.

583
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:29,380
Rym: And I like how, just like the humans, man form, woman form, alt form, then they also have bird form, snake form, dog form, whatever.

584
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:33,420
Scott: They got all kinds, yeah, there's all kinds of forms of the robots, right?

585
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,071
Scott: It's like, you know.

586
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,100
Rym: But it's an algory to the real world.

587
00:55:37,302 --> 00:55:56,696
Rym: If you out there, if you the listener, have not interacted with very wealthy people in the real world, one thing I can say with absolute certainty is that very rich people in the real world treat the humans who serve them the same way the people in the Hex Arcade treat the servitors.

588
00:55:56,797 --> 00:56:08,717
Rym: They think waiters and butlers and maids are invisible automatons, and they will say things in front of those people that they should not say in front of anyone.

589
00:56:08,737 --> 00:56:14,840
Rym: Like, they just, they don't even consider the idea that the waiter might overhear something they say that is sensitive.

590
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,759
Rym: It doesn't even cross their mind that the waiter exists once he's out of view.

591
00:56:19,901 --> 00:56:21,239
Rym: Like, rich people are really like that.

592
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:29,786
Scott: Right, so in getting help from the servitors, right, they Calcheras gains access and Jedao gains access to information.

593
00:56:29,826 --> 00:56:33,919
Rym: Because the servitors know fucking everything because everyone in the empire just treats them like they don't exist.

594
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:44,356
Scott: Exactly, they know everything and they are also vastly much more powerful than they imagine because they can go everywhere and have access and do all sorts of things and also they're fucking robots.

595
00:56:44,396 --> 00:56:48,540
Rym: The humans are really lucky that the servitors are different forms with different powers.

596
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,000
Rym: Well, I like how the servitors have their own empire.

597
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,960
Rym: Like, they have basically built all their own secret tunnels.

598
00:56:53,283 --> 00:56:54,373
Rym: They have their own society.

599
00:56:54,413 --> 00:56:56,820
Rym: There's that one bit where they even, whenever

600
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:08,680
Scott: They're almost like a, they're not, it's like while they serve the Hex Arcade and, you know, don't like try to overthrow it or anything, they're almost like in a symbiotic relationship where it's like, they're just

601
00:57:09,205 --> 00:57:12,439
Rym: literally just playing board games like in the walls where they don't have work to do.

602
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:23,973
Scott: It's like, they're still their own thing and it's like, they just come and help the Hex Arcade and then in turn, the Hex Arcade gives them what they need to survive and then they go back to doing their own thing.

603
00:57:24,135 --> 00:57:24,338
Scott: Yep.

604
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:25,664
Scott: Secretly.

605
00:57:26,049 --> 00:57:31,665
Rym: But the other fun things about them is like, they they are very interested in what the humans are up to.

606
00:57:31,685 --> 00:57:35,258
Rym: Like, they seem to keep tabs on who's fucking who for no reason just because they can.

607
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:36,626
Rym: Why not?

608
00:57:36,709 --> 00:57:50,239
Rym: But I like this bit about how they have their own communication channels and they actively try to prevent most humans from realizing that they are sentient to the point that they take turns.

609
00:57:51,325 --> 00:58:07,238
Rym: this little bit of world building was so fun, that they take turns whenever they discover that a human is in any way recording or listening to their communication channels, they fill the channels with the most boring nonsense possible until the human goes away so that the humans never overhear them actually talking.

610
00:58:08,803 --> 00:58:12,500
Rym: And I thought that was a fun bit that is definitely going to play into the third book the way things are going.

611
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,648
Scott: But yeah, that's a great, you know, aspect of the book.

612
00:58:17,688 --> 00:58:24,340
Scott: that's clearly, you know, it plays a somewhat significant part towards the end of the book where, you know, they help out in the space battle.

613
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,526
Scott: And, you know, but they're not like a huge part.

614
00:58:27,647 --> 00:58:32,496
Scott: It's clearly, though, a huge part of the world that will come into play later.

615
00:58:32,577 --> 00:58:33,971
Scott: Apparently Rym thinks third book.

616
00:58:34,618 --> 00:58:35,022
Rym: I think so.

617
00:58:35,062 --> 00:58:38,536
Rym: Having read the second book, which just keeps on keeping on from the second book.

618
00:58:40,224 --> 00:58:43,992
Rym: Anyway, I'm not going to spoil anything for later books because we only had to have read one book.

619
00:58:44,012 --> 00:58:49,850
Scott: I guess we should just end by talking about how they somehow managed to get Utena sword duels into this book.

620
00:58:49,931 --> 00:58:59,547
Rym: I love how at one point you learn about the calendrical swords and also like Charis is like way into K-dramas like very clearly.

621
00:59:00,557 --> 00:59:00,800
Scott: Yup.

622
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:05,485
Rym: And like clearly a weeb, like a weeb adjacent type person.

623
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:07,363
Rym: And there's a lot of nerdery going.

624
00:59:07,383 --> 00:59:10,719
Rym: Like the characters have a lot of nerderies and hobbies and interests.

625
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:15,440
Scott: The person who watches K-dramas and talks to the robots.

626
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,440
Rym: I love how sometimes she watches the K-dramas with the robots when she doesn't think anyone's looking.

627
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:20,952
Scott: Yeah.

628
00:59:21,014 --> 00:59:26,475
Scott: It's very like, you know, you imagine like a high school, you know, girl bedroom kind of scene.

629
00:59:26,657 --> 00:59:35,054
Rym: But we only get a few of these calendrical duels, but basically we know she has that calendrical sword and she's very good with it.

630
00:59:35,176 --> 00:59:35,439
Scott: Yup.

631
00:59:36,626 --> 00:59:46,595
Rym: The way the duels are described is delightful because there is no way to describe it except it is like literally what happens in Shoujo Kakamei Utena when they have a duel.

632
00:59:46,919 --> 00:59:50,936
Rym: Like dragons and fire and nonsense are coming out of these swords.

633
00:59:51,016 --> 00:59:56,107
Rym: Everyone's flying around and they can do it lethally or non-lethally just for funsies.

634
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,029
Rym: You get the impression they do it all the time.

635
00:59:58,049 --> 01:00:00,452
Rym: And it was a nice touch.

636
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,249
Rym: It doesn't really play into the plot that much.

637
01:00:02,472 --> 01:00:03,099
Rym: It's just fun.

638
01:00:04,741 --> 01:00:15,850
Scott: Well, I mean it, you know, it does, there is the one, you know, it's like hinted at earlier in the book and then there's the one major, the biggest one that happens closer to the end and it is much like Utena.

639
01:00:15,971 --> 01:00:29,450
Scott: in that, you know, there's some sort of disagreement/tension between the characters involved in the duel, right, and it's sort of a, you know, you get a sort of a might makes right scenario happening, right, where, you know, based on who wins.

640
01:00:29,611 --> 01:00:32,540
Scott: that is what's going to determine, you know, the course of events going forward.

641
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,430
Scott: But this is why I kept bringing up Utena.

642
01:00:34,113 --> 01:00:48,724
Rym: In Utena, if you, before you see the whole show and get, you know, fully grok what was going on, insofar as anyone other than Ikuhara can actually grok it, not that he necessarily does either, you, you know, it's might makes right.

643
01:00:48,764 --> 01:00:50,501
Rym: If you win the duel, that means you were right.

644
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:58,528
Rym: But really, it means you were right in the context of how the duels themselves work.

645
01:00:59,893 --> 01:01:03,490
Rym: And not to spoil anything about Utena, I won't go further, but Scott definitely gets what I'm going for there.

646
01:01:03,792 --> 01:01:04,929
Rym: If you've seen Utena, you get it too.

647
01:01:05,313 --> 01:01:12,089
Rym: Back to the calendrical duels, if you win a calendrical duel, you are right in the context of the calendar.

648
01:01:13,292 --> 01:01:15,834
Scott: You are in alignment with the calendar.

649
01:01:15,854 --> 01:01:24,306
Rym: Doesn't mean you're right in any other way, so losing a calendrical duel could almost be more important than winning one.

650
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:31,795
Scott: A calendric, also got to consider the calendrical duels are not fought between two people of different calendars.

651
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:36,324
Scott: It's not someone's on the Hexarchate calendar and the other person's a heretic and they're dueling.

652
01:01:37,535 --> 01:01:39,069
Scott: No, you're both in the Hexarchate.

653
01:01:39,591 --> 01:01:52,196
Scott: We're both on the same calendar and you're sort of whoever is in more alignment with that calendar, whoever his heart is in the correct formation with that calendar is probably going to be winning.

654
01:01:52,661 --> 01:02:00,218
Rym: Which is literally one of the most powerful and consistent allegories in Revolutionary Girl Utena.

655
01:02:00,238 --> 01:02:04,830
Rym: So if you liked this book, I think you should watch that anime.

656
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:06,095
Scott: But I digress.

657
01:02:06,115 --> 01:02:19,188
Scott: So I think the final thing is that I think the reason, the number one reason the listener wanted us to read this book, specifically GeekNights, is because of the game theory aspects of the story.

658
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:19,350
Rym: Oh yeah.

659
01:02:20,456 --> 01:02:21,975
Rym: Look out the most powerful generals.

660
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:28,630
Rym: Everyone who does anything in this society has to be at least what we would consider in our current society a maths genius.

661
01:02:29,532 --> 01:02:30,150
Rym: Everything's math.

662
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:37,235
Scott: Right, I mean the whole reason they want to go after Kel Cheris is because they're looking for someone who's good enough at math.

663
01:02:37,478 --> 01:02:40,449
Rym: Good enough at math, but also good at guns and everything else.

664
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:44,225
Scott: Right, it's like all these other Kels don't know math for shit.

665
01:02:44,245 --> 01:02:54,993
Scott: We've got to find one who's, and then what's it called, the guy who called the other Kujin, he's like, "Ah, finally someone I can talk to who's good enough at math.

666
01:02:55,053 --> 01:02:55,963
Scott: Talk about math with

667
01:02:56,003 --> 01:02:56,145
Scott: me.".

668
01:02:57,837 --> 01:03:00,889
Scott: And you know, Jidao, what was he doing when he was in college?

669
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:03,602
Scott: Designing games, that's what he was doing in college.

670
01:03:03,623 --> 01:03:18,809
Rym: My favorite scene in the entire book is when Jidao, basically to get Cheris to figure something out on her own, makes her design a board game in front of him and critiques it live while she designs it.

671
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:23,336
Rym: That whole scene is my absolutely favorite scene in this entire book.

672
01:03:24,124 --> 01:03:43,396
Scott: And as much as war is already sort of, you know, abstracted into a game in real life, you know, war games, right, miniatures moving around a thing, right, but the way they conduct the space, you know, the way war is engaged in real life, you know, by actual generals, has some things to do with war games, right?

673
01:03:43,578 --> 01:03:44,550
Rym: More than you'd expect.

674
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:48,910
Scott: More, right, has, you know, but it's not just Advance Wars, right?

675
01:03:49,876 --> 01:03:56,789
Scott: But the way a general operates in the world of Ninefox Gambit, they're basically just playing Advance Wars, right?

676
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,555
Scott: It's like, and that's the way it's portrayed.

677
01:03:59,616 --> 01:04:09,857
Scott: It's portrayed as it's like, I'll move my, you know, spaceships over here, and I'll, you know, use this calendar move over there and activate the special attack over here.

678
01:04:09,918 --> 01:04:11,979
Scott: How are we going to beat the ice?

679
01:04:12,322 --> 01:04:17,030
Scott: You know, when they're beating the ice, it's, they're basically like playing a board game and winning it to beat the ice.

680
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:23,595
Rym: Yup, like they play it, eventually they figure out like wait a minute, this is just some calendar bullshit hidden behind a bunch of fancy nonsense.

681
01:04:23,615 --> 01:04:25,575
Scott: Spoilers, they beat that, they get through the ice.

682
01:04:25,596 --> 01:04:26,588
Rym: They get through the ice, right?

683
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:28,749
Rym: That's actually something I appreciated about the book too.

684
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:33,333
Scott: Well, cause that was the, it was presented as the first problem at the very beginning of the book.

685
01:04:33,353 --> 01:04:40,019
Rym: But it was also presented as the hardest problem, and then they just immediately like, they go after it right away and they beat it right away.

686
01:04:40,665 --> 01:04:44,989
Scott: Well, it's like they arrive on the scene while they're spaceships, and it's like the ice is up.

687
01:04:45,391 --> 01:04:46,909
Scott: They have to address it right away.

688
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:52,019
Scott: The same way that in Star Wars they have to get the shield down before they attack the Death Star.

689
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,837
Scott: It's like the first thing they have to do.

690
01:04:53,978 --> 01:04:55,150
Rym: It's Final Fantasy I Light Warriors.

691
01:04:55,271 --> 01:04:56,463
Rym: go fucking beat up Garland.

692
01:04:56,746 --> 01:04:57,090
Rym: What do you do?

693
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:57,978
Rym: Go straight to Garland.

694
01:04:57,999 --> 01:05:02,647
Scott: It's not like there was anything else you could address first as long as the ice is there.

695
01:05:02,707 --> 01:05:03,858
Scott: What else are you gonna do first?

696
01:05:04,222 --> 01:05:06,729
Scott: So they, they address it first so they can move on with the book.

697
01:05:07,293 --> 01:05:12,078
Scott: Well, otherwise it would be boring to just be sitting there like, well, can't get through the ice.

698
01:05:12,098 --> 01:05:13,656
Rym: But I think the point about game design.

699
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:15,150
Scott: Next chapter, still can't get through the ice.

700
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:35,857
Rym: The point about game design that this, that this book and those scenes reinforce the most, I think is that you know, the actual full reality of any situation is too complex to be simulated, and at that like trying to make decisions based on all the data available is in the real world usually an exercise in futility.

701
01:05:36,362 --> 01:05:54,809
Rym: So the smartest thing anyone can do is figure out what data points are the most important and build slower fidelity simulations based on that data to figure out broad decisions and then delegate decisions in detail for the zoomed in parts and trust people which is how the real world works.

702
01:05:55,451 --> 01:06:03,689
Rym: And I think this book just does a really good job of describing how games really literally for real fit into such a concept.

703
01:06:04,932 --> 01:06:16,482
Scott: And pretty much everything that happens in the book is, can be framed as you know games within games within games and you know, it's like these you know, you get your smaller games of like, you know, get the dice.

704
01:06:16,502 --> 01:06:17,977
Rym: Well there's that card game that they play.

705
01:06:17,997 --> 01:06:18,908
Rym: Right.

706
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:27,768
Scott: You get your bigger games like Take Back the Space Station, and then the biggest game of all, right, is Jidao Overthrow the Empire somehow.

707
01:06:29,257 --> 01:06:32,570
Scott: Right, and that's left, that's you know, not resolved in the first book, right?

708
01:06:33,714 --> 01:06:33,916
Scott: So.

709
01:06:33,936 --> 01:06:40,049
Rym: Yep, so weaponized calendrical utendidual game theory space battle violence the novel.

710
01:06:41,474 --> 01:06:43,850
Scott: So yeah, it's a very very GeekNights novel.

711
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:46,816
Scott: The listener, that's probably why the listener wanted us to read it so much.

712
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:48,049
Scott: We read it.

713
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:48,977
Scott: You happy now?

714
01:06:48,997 --> 01:06:50,532
Rym: I really enjoyed it.

715
01:06:50,977 --> 01:06:53,283
Rym: I will definitely finish the series.

716
01:06:55,236 --> 01:06:56,150
Rym: And I'll let you know how it goes.

717
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:58,190
Rym: But so far book two, I thoroughly enjoyed.

718
01:06:59,134 --> 01:07:01,059
Rym: It'll answer a lot of questions you had.

719
01:07:01,402 --> 01:07:04,796
Rym: It'll go into way more detail than you expect on a bunch of stuff.

720
01:07:05,826 --> 01:07:16,069
Rym: And it's the only thing I would say is there are far fewer space battles in the second book and a lot more board meetings and basically like scrums almost.

721
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:17,548
Rym: It's uh, you'll see.

722
01:07:18,892 --> 01:07:25,039
Rym: So, as is traditional I am now on the hook to announce the next book whatever it might be.

723
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:30,410
Rym: And what I have chosen the next book club book is Binti by Nnedi Okorafor.

724
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:31,657
Scott: Okay.

725
01:07:32,024 --> 01:07:34,189
Scott: I've heard I know the name of the author, but I don't.

726
01:07:34,411 --> 01:07:36,290
Scott: I don't think I've read any book that they've written.

727
01:07:36,613 --> 01:07:40,816
Rym: So their books have been very popular and have been popping up in my feeds quite a bit.

728
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:43,550
Rym: But this is the one that has popped up the most.

729
01:07:46,299 --> 01:07:51,259
Rym: And I'm just going to read a little snippet from her own website explaining what this book is about.

730
01:07:51,886 --> 01:07:58,130
Rym: Her name is Binti and she is the first of the Himba people to ever be offered a place at Umsa University.

731
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:01,869
Rym: The finest institution of higher learning in the galaxy!

732
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:02,987
Rym: It's a sci-fi!

733
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,325
Scott: So it's space.

734
01:08:05,335 --> 01:08:08,710
Scott: we've got another space college, again two space college books in a row.

735
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:15,390
Scott: I'm in a space college mood, so you can get your They Were 11's and your Utena's out of the way.

736
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:20,304
Rym: This book fits right into that and I'm really excited to read it.

737
01:08:20,747 --> 01:08:28,948
Rym: And I expect I will be finished with this book within a few weeks, but we'll give you the listener at least a month before we do a show on it, so you've got some time.

738
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:31,613
Rym: But I highly, highly, highly recommend this book.

739
01:08:31,633 --> 01:08:32,908
Scott: Probably wait for summer to be over.

740
01:08:33,993 --> 01:08:35,752
Rym: I mean summer, laying on the beach and reading.

741
01:08:36,096 --> 01:08:37,754
Rym: I'll definitely finish this book pretty quick.

742
01:08:38,117 --> 01:08:43,778
Scott: I mean my job, my new job is starting on Monday, but I'm never going to work on Friday ever again, so.

743
01:08:49,742 --> 01:08:51,859
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

744
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:57,194
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

745
01:08:57,395 --> 01:09:02,444

746
01:09:02,688 --> 01:09:05,354
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

747
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:10,059

01:09:18,142 --> 01:09:21,051
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

751
01:09:21,495 --> 01:09:47,180

01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:57,579
Rym: Now, tonight, we will leave you with something because we won't be doing any shows next week because, as anyone who watched the stream saw, I'm gonna be at the beach.

753
01:09:58,080 --> 01:11:02,908
Rym: So, no GeekNights, take a break, hit the ground running the week after next week, enjoy your summer, stay safe out there, and I simply leave you with... Tenzou!

754
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:18,603
Rym: Tenzou... I will never forget you.
