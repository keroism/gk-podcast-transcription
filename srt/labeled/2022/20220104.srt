1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,680
Scott:

2
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:10,388
Rym: It's Tuesday, January 4th, 2022.

3
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:10,609
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:13,879
Scott: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,288
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

6
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:21,314
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about Lost Ruins of Arnak, a 2020 tabletop board game.

7
00:00:24,182 --> 00:00:25,218
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,950
Rym: So, uh, yeah.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,279
Rym: Coming straight into the new year.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,171
Rym: COVID is going crazy again.

11
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:32,479
Rym: Like, we're fully locked down.

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,543
Scott: It's crazy.

13
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:37,299
Scott: I don't think people really understand how, you know, ridiculous it is.

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:46,060
Rym: Yeah, the number of positive cases in New York today was, like, nearly double the highest number on any day in the entire pandemic.

15
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,803
Scott: No, it's not double.

16
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:50,217
Scott: It's like eight or nine times what it's ever been, ever.

17
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:54,820
Scott: Eight or nine times what it's ever been, ever.

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,535
Rym: I was looking just at New York City, specifically.

19
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:58,380
Rym: If you look at the country...

20
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:01,200
Scott: Yeah, it's eight or nine times what it's ever been, ever.

21
00:01:02,823 --> 00:01:04,839
Scott: Like, if you look at the humps from the past...

22
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:06,460
Rym: I was looking at hospitalizations.

23
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:09,131
Scott: Yeah, if you look at the humps from 2020, 2021, right?

24
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,560
Scott: It's like those humps got up to, like, you know, thousands per day.

25
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,069
Scott: It's now, like, 30, 40,000 per day.

26
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:18,363
Rym: Yep.

27
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:23,600
Rym: Well, the biggest, saddest number was that nationally, we're already at a million new cases a day.

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:44,920
Rym: And even though, like, a thing that I'm seeing a lot, especially among people who are justifying their terrible decision to go to But one thing that is not clear at all, and likely not mild, is the chance of having permanent consequences of catching Omicron.

29
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:48,080
Scott: Well, so first of all, there's a problem that people don't realize.

30
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,439
Rym: Well, so "mild" to a medical professional means we didn't have to intubate them.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,161
Scott: Right.

32
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:57,360
Scott: Doctors and the CDC have fucked up in using the word "mild," right?

33
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,728
Scott: It's like they use the word

34
00:01:58,869 --> 00:01:59,372
Scott: "doctors.".

35
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:04,174
Scott: When they say the word "mild," they mean, like, "Oh, you didn't need surgery.

36
00:02:04,214 --> 00:02:04,797
Scott: You didn't need a

37
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:05,480
Scott: ventilator.".

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,740
Rym: Yeah, you know what the doctor said when I had a bicep spoke go through my leg?

39
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,154
Rym: It was a "trivial

40
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:10,518
Rym: wound.".

41
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:12,404
Scott: Yep, exactly.

42
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:23,040
Scott: It's like, you know, so mild to a doctor means that you didn't need extreme medical interventions to survive and recover, right?

43
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:35,967
Scott: But meanwhile, you could be sitting there, right, like, you know, gasping for breath with extreme pains and suffering and permanent consequences that affect you the rest of your life.

44
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:45,379
Scott: And as long as the doctor didn't put you on a ventilator or have to, like, you know, give you a new lung or some shit, that counts as "mild" medically, right?

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,760
Scott: So they spread around that word "mild," and now people, you know, have the wrong impression.

46
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:54,090
Scott: I blame the doctors, not the people, right?

47
00:02:54,572 --> 00:02:56,339
Scott: That, "Oh, I guess it's not a big

48
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:56,540
Scott: deal.".

49
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,828
Scott: It's like, no, it's a really fucking big deal.

50
00:03:00,232 --> 00:03:02,500
Scott: If you get sick, it's gonna suck ass.

51
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,050
Scott: It's not just like you got some sniffles, right?

52
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:06,356
Scott: It sucks ass.

53
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:07,039
Scott: You don't want it.

54
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,913
Rym: But even worse, there's other things going on.

55
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:18,492
Rym: Like, we... Now, I'm not saying be a prepper and go down to the woods, but the last couple of rounds of this, like the two previous peaks, we had supply chain issues.

56
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,340
Rym: Like, you couldn't get toilet paper and flour for a while.

57
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:35,059
Rym: But there weren't actually that many cases compared to what's happening now where so many people are so sick they can't work that the supply chain is probably more at risk now, today, than it was at any point in the pandemic up to this point.

58
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:45,100
Scott: Right, well, the original, right, in the old 2020, right, before pre-vaccine, right, there was more deaths, right?

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,380
Scott: But there was less cases because of more caution and also because the virus was less evil.

60
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:57,720
Rym: But even if this is treatable for a lot of people, there aren't enough hospital staff.

61
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,609
Scott: Right, now we have vaccines which have decreased deaths.

62
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:05,560
Scott: So it's like, yeah, if you're fully vaxxed and boosted, are you gonna die?

63
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,700
Scott: You could, but it's not super likely.

64
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,251
Rym: And pre-omacron, it was also radically cutting off spread.

65
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:16,380
Rym: Like, there were practically no cases for a long period of time over the summer.

66
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,180
Scott: If you are unvaccinated, yeah, omicron might kill you, actually.

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,225
Scott: So don't...

68
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,032
Rym: Yeah, the difference... Being vaccinated is super important to be vaccinated to prevent dying.

69
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,990
Scott: But, you know, is it gonna prevent you from getting sick?

70
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,380
Scott: Also, yes, but less so than previously.

71
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,140
Rym: Yep.

72
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:49,840
Rym: Well, even more, like, beyond all of that, a big problem is gonna be if a lot of people are sick and out of, like, whatever their jobs are, a lot of those jobs are gonna not happen, which could be way worse than what happened the first two rounds.

73
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,519
Rym: Also, if you get hurt for an unrelated reason, no one at the hospital is gonna be able to help you.

74
00:04:55,841 --> 00:05:04,380
Rym: And on top of all that, one thing we do know is that if you're not boosted, you have very little relative protection against the omicron variant specifically.

75
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,580
Rym: You gotta get that booster shot, especially if you didn't get an mRNA vaccine.

76
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,959
Rym: Most of the world did not get mRNA vaccines.

77
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:18,160
Rym: Like, if you got AstraZeneca or J&J, you need an mRNA booster, like, with extreme urgency right now.

78
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:20,059
Rym: And they are not widely available.

79
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:27,339
Scott: A lot of people who just got, like, one J&J, it's like, they got, like, as far as the doctors are concerned, they're like, "Well, that person got

80
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:27,519
Scott: sick.".

81
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:29,399
Scott: It's like, it barely helped them.

82
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,218
Rym: I'll say this.

83
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:37,120
Rym: My company, my actual day job, their policy now is if you don't have a booster, you count as unvaccinated for all of our policies.

84
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:38,238
Scott: Alright.

85
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:46,860
Rym: So, my advice to you, specifically, is buy a tiny bit ahead on anything that you really need in your life.

86
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:51,015
Rym: And don't go anywhere for the next month if you can avoid it.

87
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:58,480
Rym: Especially, don't go to MAGFest, CES, or ALA, which are all happening this weekend.

88
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,799
Scott: Don't go to any large gathering of human beings.

89
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,442
Rym: Yeah.

90
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:03,320
Rym: I mean, Ontario just locked down.

91
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,600
Rym: They closed all indoor dining, all gyms, all theaters, all venues.

92
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,800
Scott: Well, how come the whole world hasn't shut down?

93
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,740
Rym: This is what I don't get, right?

94
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:09,982
Rym: The U.S.

95
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,139
Rym: morale absolutely not shut down.

96
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,020
Scott: Right.

97
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:18,699
Scott: It's like, if I was just king of the world, I'd be like, "Look, every single person on Earth is on house arrest for two weeks,

98
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,040
Scott: right?".

99
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,639
Scott: It's like, or three weeks even.

100
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:28,040
Rym: If you just did that, it's like, okay, that house arrest- Just doing that would literally be one of the single most challenging endeavors humans have ever done.

101
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,239
Scott: Yes, but- You would need an army.

102
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,280
Rym: You would need literal armies of people who were going out- Well, good.

103
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,220
Rym: to enforce it, to distribute supplies.

104
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,840
Scott: We have armies, and those armies aren't doing anything fucking useful, right?

105
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,240
Scott: They're just conducting evil wars.

106
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,940
Scott: So let's have them put everyone on house arrest instead, and then when we're done, we can disband those armies, right?

107
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:54,520
Rym: So regardless- If you're going to disband those armies, then I just don't disband mine, and now I'm king of the world.

108
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,511
Scott: I'm king of the world already.

109
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:57,740
Scott: The armies are listening to me.

110
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,223
Rym: How are you still king?

111
00:06:58,243 --> 00:06:59,109
Rym: Yeah, you don't have an army anymore.

112
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,895
Rym: Now I'm king of the world.

113
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:00,600
Rym: I have the only army.

114
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:11,600
Scott: I don't need to be king of the world anymore because I put everyone on earth on house arrest for three weeks, and that eliminated not only COVID, right, but so much other disease and whatnot.

115
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,780
Rym: Yeah, but then I'm king of the world with my army.

116
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,280
Scott: Also, the logistics of the matter are impossible.

117
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:20,300
Rym: Like, in America, people just refused to follow the orders.

118
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,353
Rym: Even when we had lockdowns, there were restaurants that were just like, "Fuck you.

119
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:23,916
Rym: What are you going to do?

120
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:24,177
Rym: Find

121
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:24,278
Rym: me?"

122
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:24,800
Rym: and just opened.

123
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:25,750
Scott: Shoot 'em.

124
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:28,203
Scott: Obviously not.

125
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:33,540
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, you could still punish them in ways or coerce them or just take away your business license, right?

126
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:36,009
Scott: Well, the real problem- That's it.

127
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:36,580
Scott: No more restaurant.

128
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:50,740
Rym: The world is one thing, but if we just look at the United States, there's a much more pernicious problem in that our legislature, like the Congress of the United States, because of the Republicans specifically, literally can't pass any bill, so there's no way to pass any laws.

129
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:54,228
Scott: It's like, yes, that's a problem.

130
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:56,680
Scott: We can bring up and blame everything in the world on that.

131
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:03,219
Scott: But look, even in New York City, where the city council is majority of Democratic women- Because you didn't let me finish.

132
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,609
Scott: We can't even shut the city down, right?

133
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:07,539
Scott: We can't shut the state down, which is run by Democrats.

134
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,220
Rym: Even if we did that, the Supreme Court is also compromised, and they've been shooting down mandates and things left and right.

135
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:22,039
Rym: Even if we ignored them and deployed the military, nearly half of America would refuse to comply and would require violent coercion, possibly.

136
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:30,423
Scott: I'm just saying that even very Democratic places that are not compromised and have democracy, and even other countries, right?

137
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:38,626
Scott: It's like Denmark and Sweden, Finland, which just decided to go to four-day work weeks- No, Scott, that's fake news.

138
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,490
Rym: That is bullshit.

139
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,796
Rym: Don't stop spreading that lie.

140
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:41,640
Rym: That is not true.

141
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:42,888
Scott: Okay, good.

142
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:43,619
Scott: That's a fake news.

143
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:53,620
Rym: That was literally a screenshot of an article that had a misleading headline that quoted something that person said years ago in an unrelated context.

144
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:55,872
Rym: There are no plans for a four-day work week.

145
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:56,877
Rym: That is just bullshit.

146
00:08:57,098 --> 00:08:57,460
Rym: Absolutely.

147
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,479
Scott: That's a shame, but regardless, those places in Northern Europe are much more socialist than we are, and they're not locking down either, right?

148
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,740
Rym: But they are enacting a significant number of other measures, and they have much higher rates of people seeking out the vaccine.

149
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:23,800
Rym: The US has a specific problem in that there are people who refuse the vaccine all over the world, but in America, they are a huge, huge population who are also very powerful politically.

150
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:26,860
Scott: Well, maybe that won't be a huge, huge population anymore.

151
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:35,159
Rym: I think that's gonna happen, and there's nothing I can do about it except to hopefully enjoy the democracy that follows at some point.

152
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:36,038
Scott: Maybe.

153
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:49,874
Rym: Yeah, I saw a terrifying statistic that basically showed you can determine someone's likelihood of dying of COVID solely by knowing their zip code and whether or not they identify as a Democrat, Republican, or independent.

154
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:56,180
Rym: That's all you need to know, and you can have an extremely accurate prediction of their likelihood of getting COVID and/or dying of COVID.

155
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:04,454
Scott: You know, things in general in the world, right, there's causational factors.

156
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:06,819
Scott: If you know some factors, you know there are factors.

157
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:20,880
Rym: So the broad thing is we're beyond the point as a society where we're gonna have a near-term societal solution to this, meaning it sucks, but you're kind of on your own, and you've got to protect yourself.

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Rym: You cannot rely on institutions to protect you, and you're gonna have to do whatever you need to do to stay safe.

159
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:27,985
Scott: You don't have to rely on yourself.

160
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:33,340
Scott: You might not be able to rely on institutions, but you can rely on each other, right?

161
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,440
Scott: Just not your institutional each other, your community each other.

162
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:45,380
Rym: Yup, but that means things like don't ever, like literally do not, I haven't been inside a restaurant since the week after PAX East.

163
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,020
Scott: Early 2020.

164
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,040
Rym: I got, we went to Kenka, and that was the last time I've been in a restaurant.

165
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,860
Scott: Well, I went, I've been inside restaurants to grab a bag that had food in it and then walk out immediately.

166
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,114
Rym: Did I ever, I did that once or twice the whole quarantine.

167
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:01,898
Rym: We wouldn't even do that.

168
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:02,420
Rym: We just delivered.

169
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,440
Scott: Oh, one time I was in a restaurant that had the entire front of the restaurant was like open.

170
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,459
Rym: Because at the Huntress, we did do that once, because the Huntress was just an open wall.

171
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,560
Scott: And I was sitting literally on the edge of the inside.

172
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,585
Rym: I bet that we sat at the exact same spot.

173
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:31,700
Rym: Oh, and once we ate outdoors in the doorway of a giant open garage door in Brooklyn at an outdoor restaurant over the summer when cases were basically zero.

174
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,387
Scott: Yeah, effectively garage door situation.

175
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:38,220
Scott: I mean, I went to two hockey games, but then I said I'm not good anymore.

176
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:39,883
Rym: That's the thing that I think this is part of.

177
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:47,760
Rym: the problem is even if we're like the government was unified and tried to do a lockdown, a lot of people are reaching their sort of psychological limit.

178
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,846
Rym: And it is hard to tell a lot of people regarding.

179
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:53,229
Rym: you can tell me this and I'm fine.

180
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:59,380
Rym: A lot of people are fine with this, but a lot of people aren't that I just went to hockey games and now you're telling me I can't anymore.

181
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:01,345
Rym: Just like it's hard to explain to people.

182
00:12:01,746 --> 00:12:06,760
Rym: The vaccine doesn't protect you a hundred percent against Omicron, but you still need it because it protects you to a huge degree.

183
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:10,637
Rym: That nuance is just impossible for a lot of people to handle.

184
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:16,572
Scott: People don't A) value life over other things, right?

185
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:20,000
Scott: I mean, look at you skiing, not valuing your life over the joy of skiing.

186
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:24,200
Rym: Skiing is way less dangerous than biking, mister doesn't value his own life.

187
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:25,402
Scott: That's right.

188
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:37,278
Scott: And then B) you have people who, right, their fear level of things is not related to the actual likelihood of fear.

189
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,420
Rym: Imagine being afraid of a terrorist in the United States when you're way more likely to be hit by a car while biking.

190
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:45,444
Scott: Exactly.

191
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:45,947
Scott: Same deal.

192
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,280
Rym: Cars can't get me on the slopes, just saying.

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,023
Scott: People's fear level.

194
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:51,707
Rym: No, Scott, I will say this.

195
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:56,260
Rym: If a car hits me while I'm skiing, you are welcome to laugh at my funeral.

196
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:03,815
Scott: Well, the point is, right, while I choose to bike, right, whenever I bike in these cars, I'm terrified the whole time.

197
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:05,900
Scott: My fear level is correctly aligned.

198
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,700
Rym: Well, case in point, when I'm skiing on a normal trail, it's like whatever, but if I'm in the trees doing something serious, you know what's going through my head?

199
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:14,060
Rym: Turn left, turn right, don't die, don't die.

200
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:25,259
Scott: Right, my fear level is in alignment with, or at least relatively, more in alignment with the actual odds and risks of danger.

201
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:50,460
Scott: Whereas I think for a lot of people, their desires will cause them to intentionally, or for many, many reasons, their illogicalness, ignorance, all kinds of reasons, their fear is not in alignment with the actual risks and consequences.

202
00:13:51,440 --> 00:14:02,460
Scott: So people will be really afraid of, and sometimes it can even be like a phobia, like you're just afraid of heights even though you're perfectly safe in a glass overhang that won't fall down.

203
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,760
Scott: It's one of those buildings with the overlook thing.

204
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:13,000
Rym: But there is also a secondary problem of a lot of people just don't consume a significant amount of external information on a daily basis and just don't know things.

205
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:23,760
Scott: Right, so it could be, you know, the ignorance, phobias, desires, you know, making, you know, it's like I want this so bad that I'll, you know, I'll change my feelings on it, right?

206
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:25,123
Scott: So many reasons.

207
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:31,460
Scott: Of course, actually, you want to get your, you know, I think what you just need to do is, you know, you can't control anyone else.

208
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:44,880
Scott: But think about yourself and assess risks of things, not just, you know, disease, but everything in life, and get your fear in alignment with reality, right?

209
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:57,920
Scott: Be afraid of things that are likely to happen and will cause severe damage and be less afraid of things that are unlikely to happen and probably won't do that much damage if they do happen.

210
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,224
Rym: And one of those things right now is COVID.

211
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:04,189
Rym: Like, it is, this is the calm before the storm.

212
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:05,190
Rym: You think it's bad now?

213
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:11,280
Rym: We're not even close to the incubation period and the, like, long tail of what's going to happen from the holidays.

214
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:13,022
Scott: Mm hmm.

215
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:20,080
Scott: Anyway, anyway, in some others, you can stay inside and podcast and some other totally safe, extremely shitty news.

216
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:27,880
Rym: So the president of Square Enix made a huge, like, announcement and wrote this giant New Year, you know, New Year's announcement.

217
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,201
Rym: Yep.

218
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:34,956
Rym: But this New Year's announcement was notable in that 100 percent of it was cryptocurrency NFT bullshit.

219
00:15:35,257 --> 00:15:36,720
Scott: Like, pretty much it was.

220
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:54,900
Rym: It's it actually earnestly, I'm not even being hyperbolic here, argues that people who play games for fun are kind of not the demographic that games should go after and that the real world is games where you play to earn as opposed to play for fun.

221
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,460
Scott: Like, it is just, I mean, yeah, if you're if you're a game company and you want to make a lot of money, that's absolutely correct.

222
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,879
Rym: I don't know how to make a lot of money, though.

223
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:05,900
Scott: You don't make that much money from people who are playing for fun.

224
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,140
Scott: You make you make money from people who are addicted or, you know, psychologically.

225
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,523
Rym: Gotcha.

226
00:16:12,664 --> 00:16:15,216
Rym: Look at the Genshin Impact, which you should not play.

227
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:16,160
Rym: That game is unethical.

228
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:22,860
Rym: That game is probably more harmful to society right now and also makes way more money than a lot of games.

229
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,045
Rym: You can just buy and play for fun.

230
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,180
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, that's how you make a lot of money.

231
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:38,800
Scott: If you make a game that's if you were to make Mario three today, it's like, you know, even assuming it was, you know, as technologically advanced relative to the time with inflation.

232
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,519
Rym: That game would cost like two hundred and forty dollars.

233
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,163
Scott: Yeah.

234
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:48,680
Scott: But regardless, it's like you would maybe even if you sold a big pile of copies.

235
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:49,282
Scott: Right.

236
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:53,296
Scott: It's like, OK, everyone bought Mario, you know, ten and then that's it.

237
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:56,932
Scott: And then, you know, the end.

238
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:57,153
Scott: Right.

239
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,839
Rym: But Square Enix, what's interesting is there's a big shift because if you look at the three, we skipped a bunch of episodes the end of the year.

240
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,280
Rym: We didn't even talk about Kickstarter literally destroying itself and moving to block chain yet.

241
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,771
Rym: But basically we saw with this, like there was.

242
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:17,400
Rym: the first wave was Discord hinted at supporting NFTs.

243
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:21,579
Rym: And the blowback from Discord users was so severe that they actually walked it back.

244
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:30,820
Scott: Well, I think everybody, every company, you know, that has, you know, showed their hand got blowback and some of them stand firm and some of them walk it back.

245
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,105
Scott: So some of them didn't make it.

246
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:34,900
Scott: Some of them didn't, you know, do it, say anything to begin with.

247
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,059
Rym: So Kickstarter was the next one where they got blowback and they doubled down like that.

248
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:49,160
Rym: I cannot believe that I got an email from Kickstarter support that used the word, the term fiat currency to tell me why I'm wrong.

249
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:55,000
Rym: And my concerns about NFTs and cryptocurrency and block chain are wrong and I should keep using Kickstarter.

250
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,325
Scott: Well, guess what?

251
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:57,900
Scott: I'm never kickstarting anything ever again.

252
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,141
Scott: Yep.

253
00:17:58,222 --> 00:18:02,480
Rym: In fact, the only reason I haven't deleted my Kickstarter account is I'm waiting on- Because I already kickstarted something.

254
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,640
Rym: I'm waiting on Court of Blades and I think John Company 2 are the last two I have outstanding.

255
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,840
Scott: The vast majority of things I've kickstarted, you know, I've had a Kickstarter account since the beginning.

256
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,939
Scott: I've kickstarted like hundreds of things.

257
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,393
Scott: Yeah.

258
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,900
Scott: But most of the things I kickstart these days are indie tabletop RPG PDFs and such.

259
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,139
Scott: And none of those are going to be on Kickstarter anymore.

260
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:32,120
Rym: In fact, that industry, the tabletop industry as a whole basically collectively announced almost simultaneously that we'll never use Kickstarter again.

261
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,403
Scott: That's right.

262
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:35,759
Scott: So I don't have to worry about kickstarting anything new.

263
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:40,000
Scott: So I'm just going to wait for all the kickstarters I have- I got two left.

264
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,980
Scott: To come through and then delete the account.

265
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,140
Rym: So you have Discord, which went, oh shit, and backed off.

266
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,060
Rym: You have Kickstarter, which when people complained, basically told the children that they are wrong and doubled down.

267
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:55,140
Rym: And then now you have Square Enix coming in with the in before.

268
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,240
Rym: Their announcement was basically, we know many of you have concerns and we don't give a fuck.

269
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:03,660
Rym: Like they came out already with the punches thrown.

270
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:11,240
Rym: This is going to get real bad and I think it's going to destroy big swaths of the game industry over the next few years.

271
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:16,700
Scott: I'm actually, you know, I don't want to say this as a prediction, right?

272
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,298
Scott: So much more as a hopeful possibility for a long-term deal.

273
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:29,880
Scott: I see a movement of people who are buying in and going on the blockchain deal.

274
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:33,680
Rym: And those people are unilaterally all in on all of this.

275
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,080
Rym: And I think they're the same people who would have fallen for the Amway scam if they were a kid in the 80s or the 90s.

276
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:43,979
Scott: I see a majority of people who don't even know what's going on, don't care, and are just carrying on.

277
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,780
Scott: And then I see another group of people, my people, who are basically going back to the old ways, right?

278
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:56,280
Scott: There's this pushback of like, let's go back to web one, right?

279
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,338
Scott: Websites with no ads and no bullshit on them.

280
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:04,940
Scott: Things like Project Gemini or IRC instead of Discord, right?

281
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,429
Scott: It's like, you know, what do we need all this shit for?

282
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:10,240
Scott: Let's just go back that we had it right the first time, guys.

283
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,880
Scott: Or even sort of in-betweens, like, okay, we have better computers now, we have phones now.

284
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:24,000
Scott: We can do these things better, but adhere to the principles and such of the old ways.

285
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,280
Rym: Well, I think there's something like, I think you're right, that reactionary movement is going to be a big movement.

286
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,047
Rym: I agree with you.

287
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:31,260
Rym: I actually have the same prediction.

288
00:20:34,243 --> 00:20:49,260
Scott: When those services made by that group of people become, you know, I guess more widely available and accessible to just the general public, they'll absorb some of that middle group of people just carrying on, right?

289
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,880
Scott: You know, you'll get some people just carrying on with Twitter going over to like, you know, old school Twitter replacement, right?

290
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,359
Rym: And Twitter's actually not that bad compared to everything else.

291
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:11,320
Scott: Sure, but what I could see happening is that movement of people going to the old ways, that will be hard to, that's like, that's gonna work, right?

292
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,280
Scott: It's like, there won't be that many people there, but they're not going to be easily destroyed, right?

293
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:20,479
Scott: It's like, 'cause that's old, the old ways are resilient ways.

294
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:26,780
Scott: The people going to the blockchain land, that's gonna beanie baby crash at some point.

295
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:34,040
Scott: Who knows when, it might last a long time, you know, but it's gonna fail because it's not sustainable, right?

296
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,700
Scott: Given just the realities of silicon.

297
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,400
Rym: Remember, there's something just far more fundamental going on that will be a threat to everything you're describing.

298
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:59,676
Rym: The only reason this NFT blockchain stuff is happening, and because it's permeating every industry, the reason is capitalism has finally hit its sort of late stage final form in that the only way to continue infinite growth is with an asset that is 100% disentangled from reality.

299
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:09,140
Scott: Yeah, you've squeezed the sponge dry, how can we possibly make more money?

300
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,960
Scott: We're already exploiting our workers and our customers and our suppliers.

301
00:22:14,623 --> 00:22:16,509
Scott: Where can we get more profits from?

302
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:17,734
Scott: Let's scam people.

303
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:24,440
Rym: Because crypto bros, what they're doing is not building wealth or decentralizing anything.

304
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:40,120
Rym: The sole reason anyone is doing this is that they're trying to make a brand new modern land rush so they can all buy that limited, I'm making quote noises and rolling my eyes as my soul dies, that limited resource on the ground floor and be the future robber barons.

305
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,479
Rym: They all think they're gonna be the new Rockefeller with their monkey JPEG.

306
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:49,477
Scott: I think that's some of it, but I also think the reason that a lot of those people do.

307
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:52,285
Scott: it is because, imagine I believed in it, right?

308
00:22:52,907 --> 00:23:01,460
Scott: So if I believed in it, that means that I could go and start a business and all I do is A, buy video cards, that's something I love doing.

309
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,360
Scott: B, build computers, making a big, big giant computer system, I love doing that, that's fun.

310
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:12,180
Scott: And then C, it just prints money.

311
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:16,420
Rym: Like a Captain Planet pollution machine, it just prints out pollution and money.

312
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:24,340
Scott: I don't have to deal with customers, all I have to do is build a computer and make it as big as I can.

313
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:34,020
Scott: It's like this dream job, that's the dream that's been there since the 90s, where they had run this program on your computer that shows you ads and will send you free money.

314
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:37,780
Rym: I ran like a hundred copies of that software and I didn't see the ads.

315
00:23:38,300 --> 00:24:04,600
Scott: The goal of capitalism is to escape capitalism, and this is the fake money deal, right, has created this pathway that people believe in where, hey, I could make money, the computer will just make money, I won't have to work, the computer will make money for me, and that dream has been around so long, we'll never die, because it's basically trying to shortcut your way to beat capitalism, right?

316
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:10,960
Scott: To win capitalism, you have to be Jeff Bezos, so much money that you don't have to work anymore.

317
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:12,860
Scott: That's the real winning at capitalism.

318
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:28,580
Scott: There's this sort of shortcut victory where I have found a way to make money without working, and so this offers that possibility, and if anything ever offers that possibility, people are always going to do it unless it is regulated.

319
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,018
Rym: Yup.

320
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,140
Scott: Right, like crime is a way to make money without having to work, right?

321
00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:38,400
Scott: I would say, I think it's more-- You're the boss of people who go commit crimes, you just have money.

322
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:46,020
Rym: As long as your crimes are robbing the right people, you are probably less morally wrong to be a criminal than you are to mine NFTs.

323
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,960
Scott: Right, but I think it's true that there's the robber baron thing going on--

324
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,233
Rym: Well, I think they're split, the robber

325
00:24:51,253 --> 00:25:04,319
Scott: baron people-- The people who believe in it and believe that they're going to make money without working, or it's not just one of the coworkers who quit was like, "Oh, I'm going to go

326
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:04,700
Scott: mine.".

327
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,798
Scott: I'm like, "All right, I don't even know who you

328
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:05,880
Scott: are.".

329
00:25:06,022 --> 00:25:07,740
Scott: I know people-- Post it on Slack.

330
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:08,619
Rym: I'm going to say this.

331
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:14,480
Rym: I think there's two groups of people, because I know some people who have done just that because they're Wall Street people.

332
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:15,319
Rym: They quit their jobs.

333
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:20,258
Rym: They just have a mining rig that they put like upstate New York somewhere, and it is just printing money.

334
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:28,459
Rym: They're just doing it, but most people don't have the IT skills to make that happen or the seed capital to make it happen.

335
00:25:29,582 --> 00:25:33,280
Scott: You've also just got people who, they're not people who had a job.

336
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,219
Scott: Maybe they're people who didn't have a job.

337
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:43,120
Rym: Those people are mostly speculating on the investments and are part of the wash trade scam part of this as opposed to the mining part.

338
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,960
Scott: You think about other nerdy things.

339
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:48,520
Scott: I think back, who was buying and selling comic books?

340
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,560
Scott: Who was selling their games back to GameStop?

341
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Scott: Who was buying and selling Magic cards at the game store?

342
00:25:54,523 --> 00:26:04,100
Scott: The people who just didn't have a lot of money and they didn't have a job, they were hustling and doing scams and making money in that way.

343
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,200
Rym: Do you think I wanted to sell Final Fantasy I back to Funko Land?

344
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,779
Rym: No, I was just desperate for cash.

345
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:12,900
Scott: Those same people are the people who are doing NFTs.

346
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,394
Scott: It's like, "Ah, I can't get a job or I don't have a job.

347
00:26:15,495 --> 00:26:16,260
Scott: My job sucks.

348
00:26:16,781 --> 00:26:19,719
Scott: I need money to live, so here's a scam.

349
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:21,179
Scott: I can run this scam.

350
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:24,100
Scott: All I got to do is click on things and money gets moved.

351
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,800
Scott: Why would you buy a GameStop stock?

352
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,780
Scott: You click on something and you can make money just by clicking.

353
00:26:31,242 --> 00:26:35,680
Scott: That is the same people doing all those GameStop Magic card comic book deals.

354
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,300
Rym: So anyway, to bring this back around.

355
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,939
Scott: I can make money just by going to the GameStop.

356
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,256
Rym: To move on to other gaming news, the thing that's important here is fuck Square Enix, just boycott them for real.

357
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,179
Scott: I haven't bought a Square Enix thing in a long time anyway.

358
00:26:48,663 --> 00:26:51,220
Rym: And never use Kickstarter again for any purpose.

359
00:26:51,581 --> 00:27:01,520
Rym: Absolutely do not use Kickstarter because the one power we have is that some huge companies are going to support this stuff on the side, like big banks and things, but you can't win those fights.

360
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:11,980
Rym: But smaller companies, you can force them into bankruptcy or otherwise significantly harm them and poison the well to make it harder for other companies to make their announcements.

361
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,100
Rym: So my advice is fight the battles against these crypto bros that you can win.

362
00:27:17,443 --> 00:27:19,500
Rym: We can win against Kickstarter, they're going to go under.

363
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,799
Rym: We can win against Discord, they gave up.

364
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:28,600
Rym: Can't win against some giant international bank, they're going to deal with it in a much different way.

365
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,619
Rym: So fight the battles you can win and boycott the companies that you can win against.

366
00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:35,690
Scott: Alright, that's enough of that.

367
00:27:36,013 --> 00:27:36,880
Rym: Let's move along.

368
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:40,160
Rym: One last little gaming news, this is sports news, but it's just--.

369
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,299
Scott: How much time are we going here?

370
00:27:41,823 --> 00:27:42,659
Rym: Oh, we haven't gone that long.

371
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,900
Rym: So there is a high school football team.

372
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,200
Rym: This was making the rounds for a while, but in December-- This is multi-year old news.

373
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,899
Scott: In December-- This is pre-COVID news.

374
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:54,980
Rym: The investigation completed.

375
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,660
Rym: But I realize a lot of people haven't seen this story.

376
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,720
Scott: The investigation confirmed what we already knew to be true.

377
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:03,651
Rym: So I'm going to read this one sentence.

378
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:07,659
Rym: that is the final determination, and it'll raise a lot of questions for you.

379
00:28:08,702 --> 00:28:20,014
Rym: "The Ohio Department of Education has stated that Bishop Sycamore High School is a scam and a way for students to play football in hopes of increasing their chances of playing at the college

380
00:28:20,054 --> 00:28:20,255
Rym: level.".

381
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:28,220
Rym: There was a fake fucking high school that ringers were playing in to try to play football professionally.

382
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:32,240
Scott: Right, so this is an old story, but basically, yes.

383
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:47,529
Scott: Someone made a sports team, and they called it Sycamore High School or whatever, even though no such high school existed, and they got people who were going to play football, and they scheduled games against other real high school football teams in an attempt to--.

384
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:52,300
Scott: You know, football scouts might see them play.

385
00:28:53,202 --> 00:29:05,260
Scott: You can scam people into thinking that you have this avenue for them to get into the NFL or whatever without having to actually go to high school, or maybe they're older than high school.

386
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,600
Scott: You're not eligible, but now you don't have to go to college either.

387
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,960
Scott: You can just play on this high school mistake.

388
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,940
Rym: Basically, it was a real school because private schools can basically just found on nothing because America's broken.

389
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:31,020
Scott: Basically, it was just a football team that called itself high school, scheduled games against other high schools, and what happened was one of their games, A, got scheduled to broadcast on ESPN-whatever at some weird time, somehow, right?

390
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,239
Scott: And two, they got like blowed up.

391
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:35,820
Rym: That's what blew the scam.

392
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,880
Rym: But the scam wasn't that they were succeeding and made this fake avenue for sports stuff.

393
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:52,998
Rym: The scam was tricking kids and parents into paying them to join this fake team to get their kids into the NFL, and that game was 58-0, and that sparked investigations.

394
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:58,660
Scott: They got destroyed by this other high school, and it was on ESPN, so everyone saw it happening.

395
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:05,004
Scott: Sports news people looked into it for a second and said, "Wait a minute.

396
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:06,032
Scott: Where is this high school?

397
00:30:07,321 --> 00:30:08,648
Scott: I can't find that on Google Maps.

398
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,217
Scott: What is going on

399
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:10,438
Scott: here?".

400
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,966
Scott: And then that brought some justice department in the state to be like, "All right, what's going on

401
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:16,148
Scott: here?".

402
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:16,853
Scott: Something's up.

403
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,540
Rym: The reason I bring this up is you can read the article for all the details because it's just fascinating.

404
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,639
Scott: It took them how many years to investigate this.

405
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:31,359
Scott: It's like there's probably, meanwhile, 20 other people running the same scam which just aren't on ESPN getting away with it.

406
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:47,319
Rym: But I guess the point is if there is any extrinsic incentive in any sort of game, people will absolutely go to extreme lengths to cheat in order to get whatever that extrinsic motivation is.

407
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,400
Rym: If there's money, if there's power, if there's fame, people will cheat.

408
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,350
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

409
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,618
Rym: So you can read this article.

410
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:03,809
Rym: I'm not going to share all the details because they're great to read.

411
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:08,889
Rym: But you know Lenin, Vladimir Lenin, his body is just there to look at.

412
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:10,169
Rym: It's preserved.

413
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,423
Scott: If you go to the Kremlin, it's right nearby.

414
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:14,650
Scott: It's in the same area.

415
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,990
Rym: I'd like to see it someday, honestly.

416
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,150
Scott: I've never been there, but I've seen pictures.

417
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:26,210
Rym: I had, at two different points in my life, planned trips to Russia that I had to cancel for, in both cases, actually strange reasons.

418
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,169
Rym: But anyways, I've never actually been to Russia.

419
00:31:29,453 --> 00:31:31,250
Scott: I don't think we're going to be going to Russia.

420
00:31:31,612 --> 00:31:32,094
Rym: Oh, no.

421
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:39,689
Rym: I mean, not that it's a good gig night topic for a Tuesday, but if you didn't read the news, Russia was literally planning to invade Ukraine, like, next week.

422
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:48,050
Rym: And the only reason they're likely not going to is that the US exposed this and there's a bunch of ridiculous drama going on in Europe that you should probably at least keep an eye on.

423
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,730
Rym: But anyway, Lenin's body was not intended to be preserved.

424
00:31:53,192 --> 00:31:56,870
Rym: It was just going to be buried in a tomb, like any state leader.

425
00:31:57,372 --> 00:32:03,670
Rym: But for a bunch of reasons that you can learn about by reading this article, if you didn't know, the Russian government ended up preserving his body.

426
00:32:04,252 --> 00:32:15,710
Rym: And this talks about the ridiculous lengths Russian scientists and technicians have gone through over the years to continue to maintain Vladimir Lenin's body.

427
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,189
Scott: It is fascinating.

428
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:26,670
Scott: I'm sure that at the original time, right, over 100 years ago already, they preserved it to the best of their abilities.

429
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:38,045
Scott: But then once you've got it there in this sort of tourist attraction, National Monument/National Monument place, it's like, "Well, now we're stuck with

430
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:38,227
Scott: this.".

431
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:41,550
Scott: We can't be like, "All right, that's enough looking at Lenin.

432
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,546
Scott: Let's put him underground

433
00:32:42,608 --> 00:32:42,710
Scott: now.".

434
00:32:43,612 --> 00:32:56,249
Scott: They had to stick with it, so they had to keep basically getting the best embalming body preservation taxidermy, whatever, known to man, and keep reapplying it constantly to keep this place open.

435
00:32:57,237 --> 00:32:58,769
Scott: And so that's exactly what they have done.

436
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:03,423
Rym: So, seriously, read this article about this 145-year-old weird mummy thing.

437
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:07,530
Rym: It is fascinating.

438
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,649
Rym: So, what do you got?

439
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:11,249
Scott: What do I have?

440
00:33:11,611 --> 00:33:17,689
Scott: So, I don't know much about farming, or especially not pig farming, other than don't trust a man who raises pigs.

441
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:35,130
Scott: But I did see this video advertising some actual legitimate farm equipment that you can buy and might be very useful if you run a pig farm, specifically the boar bot, but there are other devices sold by this.

442
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,930
Rym: I could see uses for several of these at nerd conventions.

443
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:39,985
Scott: Quite possibly.

444
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:46,490
Scott: But, yeah, this company, right, they make swine robotics.

445
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:49,042
Scott: They make several different robots.

446
00:33:49,143 --> 00:34:01,549
Scott: that would be very useful if you run a pig farm to do things like, you know, take your boar and have it pull itself around to go meet all the lady pigs and figure out which ones are in heat or whatever.

447
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:08,061
Scott: Clean all these plastic boards that apparently they have to separate pigs or something.

448
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:09,290
Scott: I don't fucking know what they do.

449
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:16,370
Scott: But they've got a machine that washes many, many plastic boards very, very quickly, among others.

450
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,449
Scott: But the boar bot in particular is just really entertaining.

451
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:28,268
Scott: I'm sure it's like really run of the mill and boring for anyone who actually knows about farming or works on a farm.

452
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:42,030
Scott: But as a nerd who thinks robots are cool and doesn't know anything about farming, there is an element of humor and also, you know, coolness to the products made by the swine robotics company.

453
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:50,570
Rym: Existing technology implemented to solve real problems is way more valuable to society than bleeding-edge technology used to solve bleeding-edge problems.

454
00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:52,014
Scott: Yeah.

455
00:34:52,136 --> 00:34:53,083
Scott: And it's also kind of funny.

456
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:55,650
Scott: It's like you look at this, it's like how many options do they have for this?

457
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:58,549
Scott: It's sort of like configuring a PC if you want to buy one.

458
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,610
Scott: It's like you can get the bigger model, the smaller model.

459
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:18,010
Scott: But it also, right, if you apparently, if you believe they're advertising, if you operate your farm with these instead of, I guess, whatever old-fashioned non-robot method, it's apparently better for the animals, right, and better for the safety of the people.

460
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,606
Scott: You know, it's like a, you know, supposedly.

461
00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:21,129
Scott: I don't know.

462
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,942
Scott: Well, maybe it's worse.

463
00:35:23,003 --> 00:35:23,870
Scott: I don't know anything about farming.

464
00:35:24,995 --> 00:35:25,908
Scott: I just know it's a cool video.

465
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:31,650
Rym: Anyway, in the meta moment, the GeekNights' Book Club book, The Tale of Genji, I continue to steamroll along.

466
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:33,929
Rym: I'm willing to do the episode at the end of January if you are.

467
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,710
Rym: First week of February.

468
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:38,510
Scott: I am likely to finish the book by the end of January.

469
00:35:39,494 --> 00:35:49,410
Scott: I think the Kindle was lying to me about the percentage because I looked, and I've got like less than 10 chapters left, but it's like, oh, you're only like 50-something percent done.

470
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,550
Scott: But I looked at the page numbers, and it's like, I think you're lying.

471
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:54,070
Scott: I think I'm a lot closer.

472
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,910
Scott: I think it's including some appendices in its estimation.

473
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,149
Rym: I've been burned by that so many times.

474
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,590
Scott: Yeah, I crossed a, you know, I read it a whole lot.

475
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,170
Scott: I've crossed, you know, major thresholds in the plot here.

476
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:08,828
Rym: I assume Genji is no longer with us.

477
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:10,489
Scott: Most likely.

478
00:36:11,574 --> 00:36:12,605
Rym: Oh, you're just getting that part?

479
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:12,989
Rym: Okay.

480
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,810
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, I think I am going to finish this book.

481
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,750
Scott: The end is in sight.

482
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:21,050
Scott: It's not like, oh, there's a mountain over there somewhere.

483
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:22,850
Scott: It's like, oh, I can see the mountain on the horizon.

484
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:24,010
Scott: I'm getting there.

485
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,190
Rym: All right, let's plan on doing that episode first week of February.

486
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,548
Scott: How's that?

487
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:27,548
Scott: Are you going to finish it?

488
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:28,349
Rym: Yeah, easily.

489
00:36:29,211 --> 00:36:30,870
Scott: Are you just going to give up and be like, you know.

490
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:35,629
Rym: I'm actually, once I got like into a groove on it, I'm really enjoying reading it.

491
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:42,650
Rym: Really, like I said, it was the point when I stopped trying to do Lit Crit and just write it like a soap opera.

492
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,310
Scott: So I have an idea actually, right?

493
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,550
Scott: How can we possibly do justice to a book?

494
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,909
Rym: I'm trying to take notes on like my top 10 favorite moments.

495
00:36:52,131 --> 00:36:56,370
Scott: How can we possibly do justice to a book that took us to who knows how many years to read?

496
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:58,310
Scott: So I was thinking we're canceling Ignite.

497
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,370
Rym: So we're going to do a two year long Genji podcast.

498
00:37:01,392 --> 00:37:03,429
Scott: Or we could kill a few birds with one stone.

499
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:03,870
Scott: Right.

500
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,990
Scott: The fact that we, A, never know what to talk about on Thursday.

501
00:37:07,674 --> 00:37:17,729
Scott: I think we could do at least two episodes, if not three on this book by breaking it down as a, we got to talk about the actual story in the book.

502
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:17,906
Rym: Yeah.

503
00:37:18,074 --> 00:37:18,289
Rym: Right.

504
00:37:18,731 --> 00:37:20,766
Scott: And then we can do a second episode.

505
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:30,470
Scott: that's meta, but the meta could, if we want to be broken into two episodes itself, because this is the first meta, which is, this is the first novel ever.

506
00:37:31,141 --> 00:37:31,369
Scott: Right.

507
00:37:31,671 --> 00:37:33,788
Scott: Let's look at where novels came from.

508
00:37:34,263 --> 00:37:34,410
Scott: Right.

509
00:37:34,511 --> 00:37:39,009
Scott: Look at what was the same, what was different in terms of, you know, writing all that long ago.

510
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:43,710
Scott: And the second meta is just, you know, the historical meta, like what was going on at that time.

511
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,170
Scott: Clearly this is not a true story with ghosts and shit.

512
00:37:47,522 --> 00:37:47,690
Scott: Right.

513
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,889
Rym: But I mean, the ghosts are just malaria.

514
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,030
Scott: Right.

515
00:37:51,190 --> 00:38:00,150
Scott: But you can learn about what life was like at that time from this book, as much as you can learn about like the eighties by watching dirty dancing.

516
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:00,341
Scott: Right.

517
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,229
Scott: Which is not a true story, but you learn a lot about what's going on in the eighties.

518
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,249
Rym: It may not be true, but it speaks to truth.

519
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:08,453
Scott: Right.

520
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:08,909
Scott: Exactly.

521
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,830
Scott: So, you know, we can, we could get two to three episodes out of this.

522
00:38:14,011 --> 00:38:27,108
Rym: I feel like too, because I am, I have a extremely superficial knowledge of Heian era Japan to the point that I've learned from reading this book more about Heian era Japan than I knew before going in.

523
00:38:27,893 --> 00:38:28,490
Scott: That's true.

524
00:38:28,751 --> 00:38:30,110
Scott: Yeah, that's true of me as well.

525
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:30,608
Rym: I knew very little.

526
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:37,090
Scott: Do you think, I wonder if, uh, this is probably like never going to happen, but I just, it came to me in the, in the shower.

527
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:37,430
Scott: Right.

528
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:41,480
Scott: The guy who translated it, the Royal Tyler guy, a is he alive?

529
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:42,970
Scott: B come on nights.

530
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:45,888
Scott: C is he a good person that would actually be good to talk to?

531
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:50,790
Rym: I mean, I feel like we should knowledge the next, uh, the, the translation we read of the Odyssey.

532
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,990
Rym: I feel like that's the kind of person you want to get on GeekNights.

533
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,610
Scott: Oh, that, yeah, she would be amazing.

534
00:38:55,071 --> 00:39:04,909
Scott: It's like, yeah, but I don't know if, uh, like, well, Tyler Clinton has the knowledge cause he translated this whole fucking thing, but I don't, I don't know what kind of person he is.

535
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:11,350
Scott: It would make a good episode or not, or if, if he's even alive, I don't know anyway.

536
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:12,386
Rym: All right.

537
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,390
Rym: Otherwise we are not going to be at magfest.

538
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,520
Rym: Obviously you shouldn't be either like.

539
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:19,644
Rym: seriously do not fucking go to magfest right now.

540
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:28,270
Rym: The panel I did effects unplugged during that brief window when I felt comfortable going to a con for 2.5 hours and I'm wearing a mask on stage.

541
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:29,230
Rym: It's on YouTube.

542
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,610
Rym: And, uh, otherwise we're working on a bunch of GeekNights stuff.

543
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:44,110
Rym: Both of us, Scott more heavily than me right now because Scott's work is way more important, but, uh, I'm working on some things around panels that we might just do outside of cons because might not be any cons for the foreseeable future.

544
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,045
Scott: He's alive, but he's like 86 years old.

545
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:54,077
Rym: So during this whole pandemic, one thing we haven't been doing is playing a lot of tabletop board games for a lot of reasons.

546
00:39:54,259 --> 00:40:02,730
Rym: you can imagine, uh, mostly playing 18 X X games because the reason they do asynchronously, uh, occasionally playing a game and like TTS or something, but not that often.

547
00:40:03,352 --> 00:40:09,270
Scott: So, uh, even if we got together, right, the board, the supply chains hurting the board gaming people, you know, so, yup.

548
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:10,537
Rym: But it just so happened.

549
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:18,290
Rym: There's a recent game from 2020, the lost ruins of arnic or our neck or air nake, uh, which is moderately popular.

550
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:20,429
Rym: Got a pretty high rating on board game geek right now.

551
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:24,350
Rym: And also it happens to be supported on board game arena.

552
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:27,929
Rym: So the stars came together and we played it the other day.

553
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:32,879
Scott: I've only played at one friend who had a friend who learned it and, and went out of their way to teach it to us.

554
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,781
Rym: And that helped a lot, uh, designed by men, Ellen.

555
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:50,050
Scott: So, yeah, so this game is a game that combines basically two of the biggest mechanics in the Euro gaming world, deck building like dominion and worker placement like every worker placement game ever a curricula, right?

556
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:55,805
Scott: So we had already previously played a game that did a similar thing, the same combination, which is do an imperium.

557
00:40:55,825 --> 00:41:04,521
Rym: Uh, I don't think we did a show on it because I got, I got to play that one again before I have an opinion that I'm going to share public because we didn't do a show right away.

558
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:05,850
Scott: So it wasn't fresh in our minds.

559
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:12,929
Rym: Not just that, but we are first play through had several errors and issues that I need to play again with knowledge to decide if I like the game or not.

560
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,556
Scott: I need to like reread the rules.

561
00:41:14,576 --> 00:41:27,078
Scott: It's been so long, but ruins of our neck, we just played it the other day and it was much simpler and easier to comprehend in our minds as much more streamlined, uh, you know, and whatnot.

562
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:31,510
Scott: So, uh, I don't feel like we need to play it again to do an episode.

563
00:41:32,132 --> 00:41:35,390
Scott: We can't obviously talk about how to win, especially not the way I play it.

564
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,195
Scott: I played like trash.

565
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:36,960
Scott: Yeah, I did.

566
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,443
Scott: Okay.

567
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:42,637
Rym: But, uh, but I was, I was basically doing what the player who won was doing, but one round behind worse.

568
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:43,701
Rym: So, yeah.

569
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:52,254
Scott: Um, but yeah, so obviously, you know, it take the two biggest mechanics of Euro gaming that are and combine them into one game.

570
00:41:52,274 --> 00:41:53,882
Scott: That's obviously a great idea.

571
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:55,730
Scott: It's going to be a winner.

572
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,310
Scott: Uh, I enjoyed both of those games.

573
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,990
Scott: So I don't know if there's any other games that have attempted that combo.

574
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:11,516
Scott: I expect more to come, but you know, both of those games I enjoyed, uh, ruins of our neck, I think was like the, you know, more accessible.

575
00:42:11,536 --> 00:42:21,370
Scott: Uh, the theme is obviously less fun cause it's not doing, there's no worms and whatnot, but it's just, the game is very like elegant for this kind of game.

576
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,789
Rym: Like you're managing all these mechanics together, but they're matched together pretty elegantly.

577
00:42:25,512 --> 00:42:26,983
Rym: It's a very fast play.

578
00:42:27,104 --> 00:42:30,950
Rym: Once you know the rules, like this is a 20 to 30 minute game among people.

579
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,327
Scott: I think the reason it's a fast play is, is for two reasons.

580
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:40,316
Scott: Number one, it does the thing I like where on your turn you do an action and then it's the next person's turn.

581
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:42,710
Scott: You don't take your whole goddamn turn like root.

582
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,610
Scott: And then everyone else takes a nap, right?

583
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,374
Scott: You do one action that it goes around and then you one action that goes around like tickets to ride.

584
00:42:48,394 --> 00:42:53,945
Scott: So that makes it feel faster because you're constantly, you're doing actions and you're not waiting too much.

585
00:42:54,469 --> 00:43:00,030
Scott: Um, and two, the game is always a set number of rounds and it's not that many.

586
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:05,078
Scott: It's like five, six, it's not a lot of rounds, five rounds ever, no matter what, it's five rounds.

587
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:17,470
Scott: So you're really only taking, and especially in the early rounds, you're taking like two actions in the later rounds, maybe six or seven, you know, not that many actions and you've got two workers and that's all you ever get.

588
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,330
Scott: You start with two workers and end with two workers.

589
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,574
Rym: So it's sidesteps.

590
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:30,370
Rym: a fundamental issue with most worker placement games is that if they're not designed extremely well, the get more workers action ends up being the most important thing in the game.

591
00:43:30,812 --> 00:43:33,409
Rym: And that tends to cause certain styles of play that aren't actually that fun.

592
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:43,727
Scott: In ruins of our neck, you are, you know, the, the, there are some actions where you don't need workers, but of the actions that you do need workers, the big actions, you basically have 10 actions the whole game.

593
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:43,989
Scott: That's it.

594
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,509
Scott: It's take 10 actions game over.

595
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,690
Scott: So it's going to be a quick one and each action is going to matter a lot.

596
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:50,488
Rym: We'll get back to that.

597
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:54,470
Rym: Some actions don't need workers because that actually really adds to this game.

598
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:01,969
Rym: And I will actually, what I would compare this game the most to, of all the games I could say, I don't think, I don't know if you'll agree, but I played this game more.

599
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:09,509
Rym: It does a lot of whatever Dell does in terms of your directional heuristics, but it does them so much better.

600
00:44:11,214 --> 00:44:17,129
Scott: I mean, I think I'm going to compare it the most to Dune Imperium still, which is another game that is worker placement and deck building.

601
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:23,730
Rym: So basically the theme is a typical, you're exploring some ancient ruins in some forgotten continent somewhere.

602
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,890
Scott: Some sort of, you know, fantasy, archeology, Indiana Jones deal.

603
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,049
Scott: You know, you know the theme.

604
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:29,990
Rym: But the game at least it makes it clear.

605
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:34,970
Rym: It's not a real world place, nor are there any people there at all.

606
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,449
Rym: Like they're very explicit about that.

607
00:44:37,992 --> 00:44:41,209
Rym: And there is a temple with ridiculous magic nonsense in it.

608
00:44:41,632 --> 00:44:44,330
Rym: And you're the first people ever setting foot here, basically.

609
00:44:45,332 --> 00:44:48,424
Scott: But you're still looting an ancient or lost civilization.

610
00:44:48,465 --> 00:44:49,750
Scott: that just, you know, of some kind.

611
00:44:49,933 --> 00:44:50,047
Scott: Yeah.

612
00:44:50,750 --> 00:45:00,230
Rym: So basically you've got this board that has some near areas that are like a base camp, some kind of far away areas and some really far away areas.

613
00:45:00,611 --> 00:45:04,850
Rym: And then an exploration like track on the right.

614
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:11,190
Rym: So on the first part, you can spend movement actions to put a worker in one of these places.

615
00:45:11,331 --> 00:45:13,168
Rym: And the further away it is, the harder it is to get to.

616
00:45:13,931 --> 00:45:16,970
Rym: And there could be monsters and there's resources.

617
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:24,990
Rym: And you're basically opening up more spaces to put workers to get resources and also get victory points.

618
00:45:25,691 --> 00:45:29,550
Rym: And then the track is the most fascinating thing because it's really the core of the game.

619
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:36,890
Rym: You're basically spending resources to move your book and your magnifying glass up this track.

620
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:48,170
Rym: And there's different paths through the track that require different resources, a little bit clank-like in that regard, like spend two arrowheads and a ruby to move from this space to this space.

621
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:57,090
Rym: And the shtick is that as you move the magnifying glass up, you get increasing numbers of victory points.

622
00:45:57,151 --> 00:45:59,130
Rym: It's clearly the primary way to get victory points.

623
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:02,530
Rym: And whoever gets to places first gets additional boons.

624
00:46:02,913 --> 00:46:04,489
Rym: And then there's some endgame scoring at the top.

625
00:46:05,031 --> 00:46:12,370
Rym: Moving your book up gives you way fewer victory points, but it gets you powers on your own board.

626
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:19,770
Rym: And the sort of interesting, fun mechanic there is you can never move your book past your magnifying glass.

627
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,088
Rym: And all that combined...

628
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:25,230
Scott: Yeah, the magnifying glass symbolizes like you're investigating, right?

629
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,490
Scott: You're looking at artifacts.

630
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:29,856
Scott: And then the book symbolizes.

631
00:46:29,896 --> 00:46:35,210
Scott: you're recording your findings, publishing what you've learned for the world.

632
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,290
Rym: You can choose to just never move your book.

633
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,430
Rym: Just explore on your own and then go home satisfied.

634
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:41,297
Rym: Like, you could do that.

635
00:46:41,378 --> 00:46:42,290
Rym: That's a valid strategy.

636
00:46:43,254 --> 00:46:43,596
Scott: Yep.

637
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,548
Scott: You probably wouldn't win, but you can do it.

638
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:54,890
Rym: And otherwise, the only other thing on the board, really, is a track that has artifacts and items that you can buy.

639
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,690
Rym: Artifacts and items are basically just cards that you put into your deck.

640
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:03,249
Rym: The deck building is important, but the deck you build is extremely small.

641
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:09,910
Scott: Yeah, so the items are, basically early in the game, the card market is mostly items.

642
00:47:10,752 --> 00:47:12,770
Scott: And the item cards are not very powerful.

643
00:47:13,575 --> 00:47:16,149
Scott: Some of them can be if you get good combos and whatnot.

644
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:19,250
Scott: But, you know, they do good stuff, right?

645
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:23,129
Scott: But they're also easy to get and you just sort of play them.

646
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:26,790
Scott: The artifact cards are very powerful.

647
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:29,710
Scott: And when you buy one, it activates immediately.

648
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:38,060
Scott: But if you draw an artifact again later, after you bought it, it activated immediately.

649
00:47:38,532 --> 00:47:40,129
Scott: It eventually makes its way into your deck.

650
00:47:40,515 --> 00:47:41,349
Scott: You draw it again.

651
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:47,770
Scott: If you want to play it again, you actually have to spend a tablet resource every time you play one.

652
00:47:48,552 --> 00:47:52,290
Scott: And so it's harder to get the repeat effect on the artifacts.

653
00:47:52,490 --> 00:48:01,530
Scott: And as the game goes on, that card market where you can get new cards from shifts to basically consist of more artifacts and less items.

654
00:48:02,751 --> 00:48:07,430
Scott: So it's like eventually at the end of the game, it's like, yeah, you know, first of all, it's late in the game.

655
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:08,781
Scott: Why are you even buying items?

656
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:09,870
Scott: They're so weak.

657
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:16,090
Scott: But also, right, it's like, here's more artifacts to choose from late in the game, you know, go ahead.

658
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:19,530
Scott: And especially if you buy them late in the game, you probably will never draw them.

659
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,710
Scott: You're just going to buy them, get their immediate effect.

660
00:48:22,251 --> 00:48:27,270
Scott: And there are worth victory points, even though the most victory points comes from the magnifying glass.

661
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:32,470
Scott: There are so much, pretty much everything you do gives some number of victory points.

662
00:48:32,591 --> 00:48:35,450
Rym: A good thing about this game, one victory point matters.

663
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,650
Rym: And three victory points is kind of like the unit of significant advancement.

664
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:44,310
Rym: Like three victory points is a big fuck you to everyone else at the table.

665
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,049
Rym: But one victory point could easily make or break the game for you.

666
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,090
Scott: Yep, sure enough.

667
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:52,809
Rym: So the cards in your deck are interesting, too.

668
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,090
Rym: Because remember what we said earlier, you have two workers, but you could take more than two actions.

669
00:48:58,572 --> 00:49:01,069
Rym: Some actions require you put a worker down to do a thing.

670
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:04,070
Rym: Usually the worker things involve getting resources.

671
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:12,450
Rym: And cards can be used as free actions to do a thing, usually give you a resource of a particular type.

672
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:15,389
Rym: But they can also do other things, depending on what the card says.

673
00:49:16,171 --> 00:49:20,790
Rym: And you keep going around, taking turns, until you pass.

674
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:21,850
Rym: Once you pass, you're out.

675
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:28,050
Rym: So you could use all your cards first, and then use your two workers.

676
00:49:28,411 --> 00:49:34,070
Rym: You could use a worker to do a thing, use a bunch of cards, then use your second worker to do a thing you couldn't have done before.

677
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:42,690
Rym: You could mess up and not have any workers left, and then there's a thing you really wanted to do that someone else unlocked or changed the state of the game.

678
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:47,010
Rym: So you're always having this decision of what do I do and how do I limit my options.

679
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:53,910
Rym: Because every action you take severely limits what additional remaining actions you can take in a given turn.

680
00:49:54,612 --> 00:50:00,430
Scott: So the two workers that you have, basically the actions they do are the ones in the middle of the board.

681
00:50:00,891 --> 00:50:07,010
Scott: Go explore a new spot, go collect resources from the camps at the bottom, the easy free spots.

682
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,210
Scott: Fight a monster, those sorts of things.

683
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:13,990
Scott: You could only do that twice per turn, and that's it.

684
00:50:14,413 --> 00:50:15,768
Scott: You got the two workers at the end.

685
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,590
Scott: Moving the magnifying glass, that's just spending resources.

686
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:21,048
Scott: You spend resources and you move it.

687
00:50:21,415 --> 00:50:22,170
Scott: That's just an action.

688
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:27,270
Scott: Buying a card, you just get the resources and you just buy the card from the market.

689
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,490
Scott: You don't need a worker to do that.

690
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:29,630
Rym: But it is your action.

691
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:36,050
Rym: So for example, if you have no valid actions on your turn, you're forced to pass even if you didn't want to.

692
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:46,710
Rym: So you might do actions that make sure you have additional possible actions to stay in the round hoping someone else will do something, waiting for a new item to come out.

693
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:52,290
Rym: There's a lot of surprising tactical depth for how simple this game is because of that.

694
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:53,845
Rym: The other thing this does...

695
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:56,350
Scott: There's that typical balance, right?

696
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:02,470
Scott: Normally in a worker placement game, a lot of them tend to either swing in one direction or the other.

697
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:08,170
Scott: One direction being, I want to get my workers out first to get the spots before they get blocked.

698
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,969
Scott: Because yes indeed, in this game, if someone else went to that spot, you can't go there.

699
00:51:13,311 --> 00:51:18,370
Scott: But also, some worker placement games, you're like, well, I kind of want to hold out to the end.

700
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,144
Scott: I have the most information, right?

701
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:26,948
Scott: Then I can run wild with my workers on whatever remains blocked or not blocked.

702
00:51:28,231 --> 00:51:35,870
Scott: In this game, since it goes around and around and around, you're sort of in this constant struggle between the two, right?

703
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,558
Scott: If I put up my workers quickly, right?

704
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,223
Scott: One, two, then that's sort of it.

705
00:51:43,111 --> 00:51:47,530
Scott: And I won't be able to respond to anything else that happens, but I'll get what I wanted.

706
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:53,170
Scott: But if I hold out, well, yeah, sure, you're going to get more info, maybe get what you wanted, right?

707
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,649
Scott: So you actually have both pressures at once.

708
00:51:56,111 --> 00:52:01,130
Scott: Whereas I think in a lot of other worker placement games, only one of the two pressures is present at any given time.

709
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:15,730
Rym: The most important thing this does is that the way these actions play out and the way the magnifying glass and book track works, where you're limited, is once you move onto a space, you can only move to other adjacent spaces as you go up.

710
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:24,630
Rym: So it's constraining what resources you will need, which reduces the cognitive load of considering all the possible options.

711
00:52:24,951 --> 00:52:30,390
Rym: If all your biz doesn't need rubies to advance, you don't need to worry about rubies on the board, most likely.

712
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:34,050
Rym: So you can avoid some of the analysis paralysis that happens with more open games.

713
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:38,143
Scott: Well, there's only three, there's two resources, right?

714
00:52:38,163 --> 00:52:39,890
Scott: The compass and, what's the other one?

715
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,830
Rym: Well, there's compasses, there's gold, there's rubies, and there's arrowheads.

716
00:52:46,635 --> 00:52:52,710
Scott: So compasses are mostly used for traveling, to get your workers to go to more distant places, right?

717
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:56,050
Rym: But some artifacts use them, some other things use them.

718
00:52:56,691 --> 00:53:00,118
Scott: Gold is mostly used for getting cards, right?

719
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:05,550
Scott: So those are your early game resources that mostly are used to build up your engine.

720
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:18,496
Scott: The other three resources, the tablet, the ruby, and the arrowhead, are sort of the victory point, move your magnifying glass, do research resources, which are mostly used for that purpose.

721
00:53:19,338 --> 00:53:22,384
Scott: But then, each resource has a little bit of extra, right?

722
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:29,490
Scott: You're eventually going to need some compasses to go with the magnifying glass, right?

723
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:35,630
Scott: To play an artifact card, like I said before, you're going to need a spare tablet resource left over from somewhere.

724
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:42,368
Scott: So they do mix it up a little bit with the costs to keep it interesting, it's not locked in.

725
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:46,144
Rym: They even have a really clever win more at the very end of the game.

726
00:53:46,164 --> 00:54:03,690
Rym: If you make it to the top of that track, there's like this pyramid of extra victory points you can buy out of, where there's three places that require different amounts of resources, and you can buy one, two, or three of them in any combination every round if you somehow are sitting up there with extra resources at the end of the game.

727
00:54:05,591 --> 00:54:13,190
Scott: I guess the last thing is that every card, in addition to having an effect of some kind, if it's like an item, right?

728
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:20,690
Scott: Or even the basic cards the game just gives you from the start, you can spend them for free to get a compass or a gold or whatever.

729
00:54:21,252 --> 00:54:26,210
Scott: Every card has some sort of travel possibility on it.

730
00:54:26,651 --> 00:54:28,690
Rym: Yep, boots, boats, cars, planes.

731
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:30,032
Scott: Right, boots, boats, cars.

732
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:57,790
Scott: So it's like when you want to send your worker out into the world, not only do you need enough compasses to get them where they're going, so you have to get those compasses from somewhere, you also have to play cards with enough correct transportation symbols, so now you can't use those cards for what their effect was because you had to use those cards to make the worker go to the spot that you wanted, and so then you get some tough choices as well, right?

733
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:02,907
Scott: Sometimes you might pick up a crappy item just because, "Well, I'll use it as an airplane on it," right?

734
00:55:03,027 --> 00:55:03,650
Scott: You know, whatever.

735
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:19,347
Scott: So you might be forced to be like, "Oh, I really want to play this good item, but that's the only way I can get that worker out is to use it as a boat, and, well, if I don't do that, then the worker won't even get used this turn.

736
00:55:19,387 --> 00:55:19,688
Scott: What do I

737
00:55:19,729 --> 00:55:19,889
Scott: do?".

738
00:55:21,010 --> 00:56:05,290
Rym: So this is sort of where the reason I want to compare and contrast this a little bit to Everdell is that Everdell, while it's a very different game, this game and Everdell share a few very core heuristics in that in the early game, you're buying items and sort of either collecting resources or collecting ways to collect resources, and in the later game, you're doing victory points and other stuff, but the big difference is Everdell, as you get into later phases of the game, the possibilities open up and explode and cause extreme analysis paralysis, but in this game, your options are constrained by the decisions you have made up to this point, so it never opens up enough for you to get just completely overwhelmed with options.

739
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:12,430
Rym: If you're in a spot where you need a ruby and you don't have a ruby, you fucked up, you should have gotten a ruby, you could see it coming the whole time.

740
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:20,930
Scott: I do think that is a problem for just many games in general, right, is that, you know, think about like, you know, something like Monopoly or Civilization.

741
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:24,076
Rym: Well, characters in the games, it's bushiness, the concept of bushiness.

742
00:56:24,097 --> 00:56:27,884
Rym: You cannot have a game where bushiness increases over time.

743
00:56:27,924 --> 00:56:30,650
Rym: That will greatly extend the length of that game.

744
00:56:31,691 --> 00:56:36,624
Scott: A lot of games, the bushiness goes up and up and up and up, like Civ 6, you know, any Civ.

745
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:38,830
Scott: really, towards the end of the game, the bushiness is huge.

746
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:42,623
Scott: You got a ton of cities, a ton of units, it's just like, it's too big, right?

747
00:56:42,643 --> 00:56:44,470
Scott: You got to deal with all this crap, right?

748
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:50,286
Scott: And usually early in games, you don't want to start people out with like a whole pile of resources right at the beginning.

749
00:56:50,326 --> 00:56:51,730
Scott: That's two hits, like you didn't earn it.

750
00:56:52,051 --> 00:56:54,210
Scott: So the bushiness is small in the beginning.

751
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:56,317
Rym: Like a lot of train games, take a loan.

752
00:56:56,337 --> 00:56:58,970
Rym: That's the only thing you can do, take a loan.

753
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:00,471
Scott: Right.

754
00:57:00,712 --> 00:57:05,566
Scott: So I think, you know, the ideal game is going to increase bushiness quickly, right?

755
00:57:05,586 --> 00:57:07,170
Scott: To get your options out early.

756
00:57:07,251 --> 00:57:08,569
Rym: And then winnow that bushiness down.

757
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:09,271
Scott: Right.

758
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:12,416
Scott: Constrain them and push the game towards the conclusion.

759
00:57:12,456 --> 00:57:20,750
Scott: And this constrains you by, A, it's hard to get a huge pile of resources and keep, there's no engine building really, right?

760
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,009
Scott: You just, you don't build, there's like no way.

761
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,830
Rym: You might get one combo between like an assistant and an artifact.

762
00:57:27,251 --> 00:57:28,474
Scott: But I tried it.

763
00:57:28,614 --> 00:57:35,310
Scott: when I played, I tried to take the dominion path of aha, I'll build and make a really polished deck of deck.

764
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,768
Rym: Oh, you had the best deck by far.

765
00:57:37,551 --> 00:57:37,752
Scott: Yeah.

766
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:39,799
Scott: I was like, I'll clear the crap out of my deck.

767
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,830
Scott: I'll bring in all the really powerful cards into my deck.

768
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,053
Scott: I'll build an amazing deck.

769
00:57:44,374 --> 00:57:49,910
Scott: And hopefully then I'll draw this ridiculous hand of amazing cards, play them and score a pile of points.

770
00:57:50,431 --> 00:57:50,672
Scott: Right.

771
00:57:50,993 --> 00:57:54,181
Scott: And the thing is, it took so long because you have so few actions.

772
00:57:54,562 --> 00:57:55,003
Scott: to build.

773
00:57:55,063 --> 00:57:57,770
Scott: that amazing deck took all five rounds.

774
00:57:58,311 --> 00:58:01,621
Scott: And I was never, if there were six or seven rounds, I would have won for sure.

775
00:58:02,122 --> 00:58:03,867
Scott: But there weren't six or seven rounds.

776
00:58:03,927 --> 00:58:04,810
Scott: There were five rounds.

777
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:14,750
Scott: And I had not scored basically any victory points worth of shit because I couldn't get the valuable resources because I was spending my resources on polishing my deck instead.

778
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:22,150
Scott: And there was, there aren't a lot of, I had basically all the draw mechanics that you could get and there aren't enough of them.

779
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:26,562
Scott: So it's not like I could, I was drawing cards during my turn as much as anyone could.

780
00:58:26,582 --> 00:58:29,370
Scott: And it wasn't enough to like play some combo.

781
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,537
Scott: It's like, you can only do so much.

782
00:58:31,798 --> 00:58:34,146
Scott: You start with two workers, you end with two workers.

783
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,190
Scott: It's like, that's it.

784
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,062
Scott: You're 10 worker actions or the whole game, right?

785
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:39,789
Scott: Plan those out and you're done.

786
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:46,430
Rym: So second point of comparison between this and Everdell, the cards are the reason the game does not fall into a stale meta.

787
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,663
Rym: The cards are the thing that shuffles the game up.

788
00:58:48,985 --> 00:58:49,750
Rym: Same with Everdell.

789
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,469
Scott: Different cards every time.

790
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:55,728
Rym: The cards guide like what's possible, what people are fighting over, et cetera.

791
00:58:56,390 --> 00:59:06,490
Rym: But the cards do not use a lot of word language so much as they have a very simple lexicon of very straightforward actions with symbols.

792
00:59:07,052 --> 00:59:12,310
Rym: So it takes a couple seconds to figure out what a new card does and no card...

793
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:16,170
Scott: As long as you have the how to play guide is necessary for some of the symbols, right?

794
00:59:16,471 --> 00:59:22,590
Scott: It's not quite a race for the galaxy situation, but you do need a little guide cheat sheet to understand some of the cards.

795
00:59:22,991 --> 00:59:24,361
Scott: But there's not that many symbols.

796
00:59:24,401 --> 00:59:25,630
Scott: You'll learn them all pretty quickly.

797
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:29,490
Rym: And none of the cards do anything particularly crazy out of the bounds of what you would expect.

798
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:34,910
Rym: Like if you look at 10% of the cards, you've got a good sense of what 100% of the cards are capable of.

799
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:39,270
Scott: I think we had one late game card question because there was some bad wording.

800
00:59:40,072 --> 00:59:41,027
Rym: But look at Everdell...

801
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,210
Scott: We looked it up and we got an answer.

802
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:50,050
Rym: Everdell, the cards have a whole bunch of language you have to parse and the cards interact with each other in really complex ways.

803
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:52,170
Rym: That's why Everdell takes four hours to play.

804
00:59:52,730 --> 01:00:01,349
Rym: And while BoardGameGeek weirdly says this game takes 30 to 120 minutes, I cannot imagine a game of this taking longer than 45 minutes.

805
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,965
Scott: No, it's only five rounds.

806
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:05,570
Scott: What are you doing?

807
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:08,500
Rym: Yeah, but I like it.

808
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,263
Rym: I like it a lot.

809
01:00:09,363 --> 01:00:10,608
Rym: I want to play it again soon.

810
01:00:11,771 --> 01:00:15,750
Rym: And I think it has a lot of replay value because the cards are key.

811
01:00:16,031 --> 01:00:19,230
Rym: They are how you construct the decks, but you make such a small deck.

812
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:23,810
Rym: I don't think this will fall into a hard meta under 10 to 12 plays.

813
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:27,550
Rym: I think you could get 10 or 12 plays out of this and they would all be satisfying.

814
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:28,352
Scott: Right.

815
01:00:28,412 --> 01:00:29,055
Scott: I think it does.

816
01:00:29,115 --> 01:00:31,285
Scott: Like you said, I think it has replay value.

817
01:00:31,305 --> 01:00:32,490
Scott: You could play this a bunch.

818
01:00:32,772 --> 01:00:33,489
Rym: But you could exhaust it.

819
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:37,088
Scott: But it doesn't have the infinite replay value of like a T&E.

820
01:00:37,671 --> 01:00:38,629
Scott: Or a Hanzo-Tortonica.

821
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:39,671
Scott: Right.

822
01:00:39,691 --> 01:00:42,430
Scott: You can play it a bunch, but then you're going to be done with it.

823
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:46,050
Scott: However, it's very obvious if there aren't expansions for this already.

824
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,215
Rym: Well, it comes with an expansion.

825
01:00:47,235 --> 01:00:50,470
Rym: You flip over the board and there's like the Temple of the Snake and everything's different.

826
01:00:51,391 --> 01:00:51,794
Scott: Oh, okay.

827
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:52,882
Scott: So there you go.

828
01:00:52,902 --> 01:00:53,950
Scott: There's some replay value.

829
01:00:53,990 --> 01:01:01,230
Scott: But yeah, this game, not only does it come with an expansion, the Temple of the Snake, but it is ripe for further expansion.

830
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:05,910
Rym: Oh yeah, just release a deck of weird artifacts, another sideboard you can advance on.

831
01:01:09,012 --> 01:01:10,178
Scott: Just put out different cards.

832
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:12,510
Scott: Be like, all right, play with deck two instead of deck one.

833
01:01:13,111 --> 01:01:15,681
Scott: It's so easy to expand this game.

834
01:01:15,742 --> 01:01:17,750
Scott: They absolutely will if they haven't already.

835
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:19,449
Scott: I just haven't looked up whether they have already.

836
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:24,170
Scott: And I think that's where you can get even more replay value from out of this.

837
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:32,770
Scott: But, you know, even if they never release an expansion and you do play it out, you know, whatever this game costs or whatever it costs to play on Board Game Arena.

838
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:43,570
Scott: I don't know if it's one of the free ones or one of the ones where you have to... Basically, the way Board Game Arena works, if people don't know, is it's a website that lets you play board games against people online and it works.

839
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:44,915
Scott: So that's really good.

840
01:01:45,116 --> 01:01:48,830
Scott: But the UI is really not great, but it works.

841
01:01:49,632 --> 01:01:56,050
Scott: And they have a lot of top tier board games on there, you know, ranging from all sorts of different weight levels and whatnot.

842
01:01:56,130 --> 01:02:02,047
Scott: But if you want to start a new game, like if you want to play 6nimped, you can just play.

843
01:02:02,067 --> 01:02:02,970
Scott: 6nimped on there for free.

844
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:10,850
Scott: If you want to play some games, like I wanted to play, what was it called, Don't Stop or whatever, or Can't Stop.

845
01:02:11,371 --> 01:02:13,170
Scott: It's like, well, I didn't have a premium account.

846
01:02:13,591 --> 01:02:19,050
Scott: So if someone else who did have a premium account started a game of Can't Stop, they could invite me to join it.

847
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:21,930
Rym: Might just be worth it for me to get a premium account.

848
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:27,870
Scott: But if you have a premium account, you can start a new game of any game.

849
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:35,250
Scott: But if you have a free account, you can only join games created by premium accounts or start games if they're free games.

850
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:36,315
Rym: I will warn you on this.

851
01:02:36,738 --> 01:02:38,850
Rym: If you play this on Board Game Arena, it works great.

852
01:02:39,271 --> 01:02:44,170
Rym: But any card, Scott got burned by this, two different players got burned.

853
01:02:44,871 --> 01:02:52,870
Rym: If there's a card where you can get a resource thing or pass to get a different resource thing, you have to pass via the card.

854
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:55,309
Rym: If you just click pass, you're just SOL.

855
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:57,737
Scott: Yep, that's what happened to me.

856
01:02:58,018 --> 01:03:00,010
Scott: And that's a user interface Board Game Arena.

857
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,399
Rym: Yeah, nothing to do with the game itself.

858
01:03:01,419 --> 01:03:02,669
Scott: The card was really straightforward.

859
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:05,670
Scott: If we're playing in person, there's no way that can happen.

860
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:06,372
Rym: Exactly.

861
01:03:06,392 --> 01:03:11,645
Rym: I don't know if I would buy this game personally.

862
01:03:11,706 --> 01:03:12,628
Rym: Not saying you shouldn't buy it.

863
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:15,021
Scott: Only because, one, It probably takes up a lot of space.

864
01:03:15,081 --> 01:03:16,290
Scott: It's not a small game.

865
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:20,610
Rym: I don't know when I'll be playing games in person anytime soon.

866
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:26,890
Rym: But also, this is the kind of game that the PAX tabletop library will probably have two or three copies of.

867
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:31,650
Rym: And this is the kind of game, if I was to add any random PAX, I would check it out at least once and play it.

868
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:32,487
Rym: Like every PAX.

869
01:03:33,395 --> 01:03:36,030
Scott: Yeah, play it once, put it back, right?

870
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:36,579
Scott: Yeah.

871
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:43,810
Scott: If you're a person who has board game nights still, somehow, and you've got, it only goes up to four players, I think.

872
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:45,079
Rym: Yeah, it goes one to four.

873
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,630
Rym: Obviously, one is not the same game.

874
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:49,361
Scott: Two isn't the same game either.

875
01:03:49,381 --> 01:03:50,309
Scott: You want three or four.

876
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:51,855
Rym: Yeah, you definitely want three or four.

877
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:55,730
Rym: Though, I think two is more the same game than other games because it is mostly a race.

878
01:03:56,311 --> 01:03:57,615
Scott: It is mostly a race.

879
01:03:57,655 --> 01:04:03,950
Scott: There isn't too much player interaction other than blocking off other people's spaces with your workers.

880
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:07,669
Scott: And also buying cards before other people can buy them.

881
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:10,949
Scott: Other than that, there's no contention and there's no player interaction.

882
01:04:12,212 --> 01:04:14,540
Scott: But you could make an, like, Agricola, right?

883
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,330
Scott: Agricola is a game that has cards, even though it's not deck building.

884
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:23,170
Scott: Where, you know, the main deck of Agricola cards, the basic one, didn't have any player interaction.

885
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,290
Scott: The only interaction in Agricola is blocking.

886
01:04:25,351 --> 01:04:27,529
Rym: They could make a player interaction expansion.

887
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:27,971
Scott: Right.

888
01:04:28,011 --> 01:04:31,590
Scott: Agricola had the alternate deck with player interaction cards.

889
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:39,190
Scott: They could easily, maybe those cards exist and we just didn't see them in our play, but they could easily print more cards that have player interaction.

890
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:46,830
Scott: Like, steal a resource from a friend or, you know, move someone else's magnifying glass backwards or steal someone's book.

891
01:04:47,011 --> 01:04:47,696
Scott: I don't know.

892
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,529
Scott: You could do so much stuff with that.

893
01:04:51,511 --> 01:04:53,245
Scott: You know, take someone's monster.

894
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:53,810
Scott: I don't know.

895
01:04:54,151 --> 01:05:00,289
Rym: I would also say that if you like this game, you would probably like Crown of Amara in terms of...

896
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:04,950
Scott: If you like this game, you're going to like Dune Imperium, which is also deck building and worker placement.

897
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:08,989
Rym: Well, honestly, if you like this game, you're going to like a lot of classic euros, too.

898
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:11,053
Scott: Yeah.

899
01:05:11,334 --> 01:05:12,135
Scott: And vice versa.

900
01:05:12,195 --> 01:05:15,623
Scott: It's basically just, you know, it's a solid euro.

901
01:05:15,883 --> 01:05:18,088
Scott: I don't think it's a legendary all-time game.

902
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:19,071
Rym: Wow.

903
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:20,563
Rym: But it's just, it's polished.

904
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,167
Rym: It's well-made.

905
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:23,623
Scott: It's a really solid, polished euro.

906
01:05:23,643 --> 01:05:24,509
Scott: It's balanced.

907
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:25,770
Scott: It binds to the top mechanics.

908
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:26,974
Rym: The rules feel right.

909
01:05:27,095 --> 01:05:28,601
Rym: Like, everything's elegant about it.

910
01:05:28,742 --> 01:05:30,510
Rym: I have no material complaints.

911
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:31,309
Scott: It's not broken.

912
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:38,390
Rym: And seriously, if you know the rules and your friends know the rules and they're like us, this is a 30 to 40 minute game tops.

913
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:40,550
Rym: You could crank out a few of these in a row.

914
01:05:41,565 --> 01:05:41,627
Scott: Yep.

915
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:41,708
Scott: Yep.

916
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,050
Rym: I do worry that setup would take a while physically, though.

917
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:51,510
Scott: You don't have to deal out, like, the spaces and the monsters immediately.

918
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:51,872
Rym: Oh, yeah.

919
01:05:51,892 --> 01:05:53,102
Rym: You deal them when you land on them.

920
01:05:53,122 --> 01:05:53,929
Rym: So, I guess it could just be...

921
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:55,091
Scott: Yeah.

922
01:05:55,172 --> 01:05:58,870
Scott: I mean, you could deal them when you land on them or otherwise, but it doesn't matter, right?

923
01:05:59,050 --> 01:05:59,714
Scott: What's the difference?

924
01:05:59,996 --> 01:06:00,720
Scott: There's no difference.

925
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:01,947
Scott: They're face down.

926
01:06:02,028 --> 01:06:02,450
Scott: So, who cares?

927
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:03,331
Rym: Yep.

928
01:06:03,351 --> 01:06:05,820
Rym: But no, this is a solid game that I recommend.

929
01:06:06,602 --> 01:06:08,690
Rym: And it's not just because we haven't played a lot of tabletop games lately.

930
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,619
Scott: It's like a B, B plus, you know, solid game.

931
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:12,582
Scott: Worth playing.

932
01:06:12,623 --> 01:06:14,810
Scott: Worth owning if you got a lot of Euro players.

933
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:15,426
Scott: Yeah.

934
01:06:16,582 --> 01:06:16,789
Rym: You know.

935
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:23,010
Rym: I feel the same urge to play it that I feel the urge to play things like Honus and Toytonica or like Tempest, like all the games I like.

936
01:06:23,711 --> 01:06:25,385
Rym: It's in the class of Games Rym Likes.

937
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:38,636
Scott: The only thing I guess that I think it's lacking game wise is that I don't feel like there's a high... Even though I sucked at it, right?

938
01:06:39,338 --> 01:06:43,469
Scott: It doesn't look like there's a lot of room to like for mastery, right?

939
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:49,950
Scott: It's like in a... I feel like with a few more plays, I would... And just knowing all the cards and such.

940
01:06:50,251 --> 01:06:52,690
Rym: I feel like I could play near optimally the second time.

941
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:54,350
Rym: And I feel like I could play optimally within five plays.

942
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:58,016
Scott: There's going to be a huge luck factor and also a turn order factor.

943
01:06:58,337 --> 01:07:12,410
Scott: But beyond that, it's like I'm going to be playing the best that... Figure out intricacies and small details to step up my game and get even better at it.

944
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:22,030
Scott: So if you play games because you're seeking strategic mastery, there's not a lot of high skill cap and a low ceiling, right?

945
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:23,642
Scott: It's like you're going to play it out.

946
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,620
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

947
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:36,740
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

948
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:42,160

949
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,107
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

950
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:49,820
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

953
01:07:57,891 --> 01:08:00,780
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

954
01:08:01,121 --> 01:08:08,340
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyceling, Gigi Dredlow, Lieutenant Brey, and a bunch of people who really don't want me to say their names.

Rym: Chris Haddad, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Dex Finn, Kishiai85, Rebecca Dunn, ReviewMadBull, 34 Cowards, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Harlow.

956
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:22,220
Rym: You hold the key to my heart and several people who do not want me to say the names that they have typed into Patreon.

957
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,944
Rym: So yeah, stay safe out there.

958
01:08:24,466 --> 01:08:27,679
Rym: Please don't go to MAGFest and at least not this year.

959
01:08:28,263 --> 01:08:32,484
Rym: And for now, I leave you simply with... Please, sir.

960
01:08:33,428 --> 01:08:35,618
Scott: I'm as curious as can be, sir.

961
01:08:36,143 --> 01:08:37,060
Rym: Wait, is he talking to me?

962
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,810
Rym: Could you stop and chat with me for a minute?

963
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:42,500
Scott: Can you teach me to be a smarter boy?

964
01:08:42,981 --> 01:08:43,578
Rym: Smarter boy!

965
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:45,720
Rym: Okay, what do you want to know?

966
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,643
Rym: Hey, sir.

967
01:08:48,404 --> 01:08:51,331
Rym: I have always loved my yum yums.

968
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:53,975
Scott: But I just know how to eat 'em.

969
01:08:54,015 --> 01:08:55,578
Rym: so I ask you, sir.

970
01:08:56,384 --> 01:08:58,639
Rym: Where does food come from?

971
01:08:59,809 --> 01:09:00,115
Rym: Oh, no.

972
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,100
Rym: World to this young man, if you could help him understand.

973
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:15,140
Rym: Where all his favorite treats, the things he likes to eat, originate from before he puts them in his dum dum.

974
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,880
Scott: Do you really not know?

975
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:19,469
Scott: Well, golly, lolly gumdrops, please, sir.

976
01:09:20,332 --> 01:09:22,198
Scott: I don't want to be a dum dum.

977
01:09:23,962 --> 01:09:27,773
Rym: I'm just hungry and I want some information, mister, please.

978
01:09:28,294 --> 01:09:30,420
Rym: Where does food come from?
