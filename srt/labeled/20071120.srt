1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,157
Scott: It's Tuesday November 20th.

2
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:12,120
Rym: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:15,350
Scott: I'm exhausted and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,002
Scott: We make fun of the game of life.

5
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:19,810
Scott: No the other game of life.

6
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,377
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:36,641
Scott: You know one of the worst things in the world is when you're going on like this someone for CD poop and torches you do Or something horrible like that.

8
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:43,370
Rym: go no It's very much when you're gonna go on vacation and everyone else in your house is going on vacation in a few days.

9
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:51,830
Rym: So you're running low on food in the house But you don't want to go grocery shopping because you're either gonna have to go again as soon as you get back.

10
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,243
Rym: Are you gonna buy stuff that's gonna go bad as a result?

11
00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:56,849
Rym: There's not much food left.

12
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:58,933
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

13
00:00:58,953 --> 00:01:03,510
Scott: I mean I go down there and there's some food, but it's like I could defrost something.

14
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,910
Scott: But it takes a while to defrost and by the time it defrost will all be gone, and then it'll go bad.

15
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:11,745
Rym: So I think the real problem is that there's plenty of food just got.

16
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:12,407
Rym: won't eat any of it.

17
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:14,817
Rym: He doesn't like ham He doesn't like sausage doesn't like crab.

18
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:16,223
Scott: There's plenty of food like.

19
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:18,030
Scott: what the thing is you seem to like?

20
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:27,001
Scott: Just have these black all you the only food You see is like the food that I don't eat because all the food you'll eat is frozen and won't thought before I go to The grocery store will come home, and you'll be like.

21
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:28,186
Scott: I'll be like alright.

22
00:01:28,287 --> 00:01:29,757
Scott: You know the next day I'll be like what are we?

23
00:01:29,777 --> 00:01:33,508
Scott: you'll be like oh, there's only stuff You don't like and you act like I don't eat any food.

24
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:41,970
Rym: well No, cuz after we get back from the grocery store We usually eat you know things you'll eat like chicken and beef But then we eat all the chicken and beef and the rest of its frozen.

25
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:46,183
Scott: So you know that there's that game that Psychonauts game that people.

26
00:01:46,324 --> 00:01:50,828
Scott: it's one of those games where everyone's like oh It's the best game ever but apparently nobody bought it.

27
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,710
Rym: well Like five people say it's the best game ever because no one else has ever heard of it.

28
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:56,230
Scott: No, lots of people say it's the best.

29
00:01:57,335 --> 00:02:00,369
Rym: I wouldn't say that many people compared to how many people play games.

30
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:02,164
Scott: Very well talking about like.

31
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:02,829
Scott: you know the games.

32
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:03,953
Scott: You know journalism.

33
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:09,616
Scott: if you go to any like you know blog of video games or any magazine of video games You know.

34
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:16,730
Rym: as for an opinion of Psychonauts There's probably more blogs about World of Warcraft than there are about people than there are people who know about Psychonauts.

35
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:35,870
Scott: Probably what I'm talking about is you know in terms of the it's a critically acclaimed game That did not sell well and is not popular and despite critics Continuing to bring it up and continuing to clamor for you know respect for this game that no one played and very few people bought.

36
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:43,070
Scott: You know it it's yeah anyway, so the game now you can get it for free.

37
00:02:43,472 --> 00:02:44,799
Rym: Will it just work on my computer?

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,850
Scott: it works on I guess Windows PCs.

39
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:47,151
Scott: It's.

40
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:48,918
Scott: you know it's those game tap people.

41
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:52,010
Scott: they let you like pay a monthly fee to like get all these games on their service.

42
00:02:52,991 --> 00:03:02,284
Scott: It's from them, but you can get it for free without paying for the monthly service supposedly, so That's all I know about it, but I assume it's the whole game for free.

43
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:10,208
Scott: I played the demo of this game and It's sort of a rough-around-the-edges platform 3d platform game.

44
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,428
Scott: But the thing it that makes the game special is like all the plot and the character designs and the levels.

45
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:16,990
Rym: wait wait wait.

46
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,429
Scott: So it's not a great game, but I never said I thought it was a great game.

47
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:23,097
Scott: Aha, I said it was critically acclaimed.

48
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:25,203
Scott: many people keep talking about how.

49
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:28,848
Scott: it's some great game, and they you know They want it real bad.

50
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,217
Scott: It's sort of like how they really want.

51
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:32,549
Scott: and you know earth bounds in the u.s.. And they won't bring it.

52
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:36,402
Scott: It's sort of like hey, you'll release this game in the u.s.. And no one bought it.

53
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:37,205
Scott: fix it.

54
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:51,262
Rym: and you know It's one of those situations People yell about how a game is so great that no one bought except I don't know I mean even the zero punctuation guy basically said yeah this game was great But it's not actually that great to play.

55
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:53,330
Rym: It's not actually that good of a game.

56
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,965
Scott: Yeah, but you know what I figure the demo was fun enough for however many minutes.

57
00:03:58,026 --> 00:03:59,049
Scott: I played it maybe 15 minutes.

58
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:01,250
Rym: I've never played a single second of that game.

59
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:14,547
Scott: Yeah, but if you need a video game to play and either you're poor Or maybe you already beat all the video games that have come out or are coming out and you sit in there you say man I want to play a video game, and I don't have a video game to play.

60
00:04:15,273 --> 00:04:16,543
Rym: That should never happen to you.

61
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:21,421
Rym: There are already How many games you have to play to run out of games to play now.

62
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,070
Scott: well imagine if you're like a college student and?

63
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,582
Scott: You had a lot of money, but you didn't have anything to do.

64
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:29,244
Rym: I didn't care.

65
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:30,930
Rym: I played tribes or counter-strike.

66
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:36,690
Rym: Those games alone were enough to amuse me in my idle single hours pretty much continuously.

67
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:43,750
Rym: I know time I was ever bored was when other people were around and I didn't feel like playing a one-guy game.

68
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:48,329
Rym: And I consider counter-strike to be a single-player game because there aren't actually humans playing with you.

69
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:53,266
Scott: Yeah, the point is is that is what a good free game.

70
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:56,278
Rym: Yeah, well I thought we just agreed that it wasn't good.

71
00:04:56,318 --> 00:04:58,225
Rym: It was only critically acclaimed.

72
00:04:58,245 --> 00:04:58,827
Rym: Well.

73
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:00,092
Scott: It's good It's just not.

74
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:01,217
Scott: it's not super amazing.

75
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:03,285
Rym: How good is it better than I don't know.

76
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:04,851
Rym: Mario 2?

77
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:07,118
Rym: Yeah, is it better than Mario 64.

78
00:05:07,118 --> 00:05:08,622
Scott: Yeah, maybe not.

79
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:15,042
Rym: is it better than doom - he depends I could just go play doom - right now you already played doom - though.

80
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:17,210
Rym: Yeah, but you know what really good for something new.

81
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:19,844
Rym: I've never gotten sick of doom - well.

82
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:22,115
Rym: That's you doom I got a little sick of.

83
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:25,150
Rym: but doom - I played slightly less even though it was better.

84
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,469
Rym: So I feel like I could play through it a few more times.

85
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:29,769
Scott: All right you got a news over there.

86
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:36,750
Rym: Well, I tried to go buy a second DS light today, and I failed at this before.

87
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:42,617
Scott: I want to buy a DS light, but you know what all the colors suck, but wait There's one good color gold that's coming out.

88
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:45,626
Scott: Oh, but it comes with phantom hourglass, which I already own.

89
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:50,761
Rym: so what the fuck I point out that I care more about.

90
00:05:50,781 --> 00:05:55,677
Rym: I don't know the system And how good it is and useful and practical is.

91
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,287
Rym: then what color the plastic on the outside is?

92
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:01,896
Scott: I'm not getting the Like the pink one all right.

93
00:06:01,956 --> 00:06:02,599
Scott: It's not gonna happen.

94
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:02,819
Scott: Well.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,984
Rym: There's a black one.

96
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:05,450
Rym: It's perfectly fine.

97
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:05,933
Scott: No, I need.

98
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:07,723
Scott: I need the silver one or the green one or something.

99
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:18,370
Rym: so you're saying that Aesthetics matter that the look of your DS Was gonna force you to wait and then pay the same amount later that you would have paid now for a clearly superior product.

100
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,189
Scott: Well, you know if I already have a DS fat that works right I?

101
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:25,429
Scott: Probably shouldn't buy a DS light in the first place.

102
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:33,804
Scott: well So if I'm gonna buy one to replace if I'm gonna buy a thing to replace a working thing I Might as well wait for one.

103
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:34,330
Scott: That's perfect.

104
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,423
Scott: It's not unless like the green one costs more or the silver one costs more.

105
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:40,710
Rym: apparently the gold one does cost more.

106
00:06:40,831 --> 00:06:41,800
Scott: Hey, it does it you notice.

107
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,153
Scott: I'm not buying it I'm just.

108
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:45,981
Rym: I find it funny that you of all people now.

109
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,929
Rym: Oh, I gotta wait for the special colored DS.

110
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:49,489
Rym: I can't just use the normal DS.

111
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:56,090
Scott: No, you know given a choice where it's equal cost for the same thing gonna choose what it's not a color.

112
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:01,973
Scott: You're forgetting the the cost of an action the fact that every day is no cost of an action because I have a DS fat That works.

113
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:09,030
Rym: if you ever use a DS light You'll realize that the cost of an action is the fact that the DS fat looks like crap compared to the DS light.

114
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,316
Scott: I'm using DS light.

115
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:13,230
Scott: It's better, but it's not so much better that it's hurting me.

116
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,819
Rym: I'm so much better than it is hurt.

117
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:16,630
Rym: I can't play on a DS fat anymore.

118
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:18,608
Scott: The Phoenix right through the DS fat.

119
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:22,980
Rym: it was Wasted that game on a fat with an old screen.

120
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:24,586
Scott: Whatever you crazy piece like.

121
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:26,514
Rym: the worst thing you could do No, it's not.

122
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:28,845
Scott: the worst thing I could do would be to not play Phoenix, right?

123
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:29,890
Scott: Which is what you did.

124
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:31,339
Rym: Well, I'll be honest.

125
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,567
Rym: I liked Phoenix right.

126
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:38,470
Rym: one Phoenix right - was more of the same but the puzzles weren't as fun and I cared less about the story.

127
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,947
Rym: Thanks, right three is better than - it better be because I'm not that excited about it.

128
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:47,850
Scott: I'll be honest I think you just got to get past where you are in two to get to the good part.

129
00:07:48,091 --> 00:08:01,033
Rym: Well part of it too is I started noticing I think it was more so in the second one than the first one that They I mean they did localize the living hell out of that game understandably But I really think that they didn't change.

130
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,459
Rym: they just changed the words.

131
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:09,385
Rym: and they didn't change the facial expressions because People's facial expressions often do not match what they're saying at all.

132
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:12,762
Scott: and three they match up I think a little better better than two.

133
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:15,298
Scott: Yeah, we'll see Plus and two.

134
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:16,910
Scott: I didn't really notice them not matching up.

135
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:27,850
Rym: So but yeah, I take the six train down and I go to the game stop at 34th Street and I think alright I'm gonna go grab two copies of worms and I'm gonna grab a new DS light.

136
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,606
Scott: Did you order the worms in Amazon yesterday?

137
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:30,009
Scott: Not yet?

138
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,124
Rym: Oh, it doesn't matter when it comes if it doesn't come before I go on a trip.

139
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:34,893
Scott: Okay, that's true I'll try.

140
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:36,561
Scott: maybe I'll try to get at the no way.

141
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,607
Scott: I'm not going any malls.

142
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:38,129
Scott: forget that.

143
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,306
Scott: I was thinking I go to the mall next.

144
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:41,934
Scott: my parents Like wait a minute now.

145
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:51,807
Rym: my news story ostensibly Is that the Wii is selling like crazy fuck and Nintendo can't keep up and there's shortages worldwide like always.

146
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,833
Rym: and the reason for that Is pretty simply.

147
00:08:53,853 --> 00:08:56,605
Scott: they're making 1.8 million and the demand is higher than that.

148
00:08:56,725 --> 00:08:57,730
Scott: Well, it's all there is to it.

149
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:04,168
Rym: I think the reason the demand is so high is that the Wii was kind of this new thing last season.

150
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:06,194
Rym: now It's established.

151
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:06,696
Rym: it's known.

152
00:09:06,857 --> 00:09:10,410
Rym: people out there even you know, normal muggles don't play video games so much.

153
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:11,994
Rym: They know what the Wii is.

154
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:15,584
Rym: It's that Nintendo thing that everybody likes and everybody wanted.

155
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:16,967
Rym: there's a big rush for it last year.

156
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:19,036
Rym: Oh Shit, it's Christmas.

157
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,061
Rym: Oh shit.

158
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:21,650
Rym: I don't have a gift for little Billy.

159
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,376
Rym: I should get him that we thing.

160
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:31,502
Rym: and every parent who doesn't already own a Wii is buying a Wii for Billy and There's a lot more than 1.8 million of them per month.

161
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:32,406
Rym: Yep.

162
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:33,430
Scott: I mean think about it.

163
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,132
Scott: They're gonna sell.

164
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,817
Scott: what two points.

165
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:36,840
Scott: There's two months left.

166
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,143
Scott: two point six million wheeze.

167
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:38,946
Scott: That's it.

168
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:40,470
Scott: How many people are in this country?

169
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,370
Rym: How many of them want wheeze and don't already have them more than two point six million?

170
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:48,304
Rym: But I didn't really think about that as news.

171
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:51,684
Rym: I mean, oh Nintendo's kicking everyone's ass again.

172
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:52,510
Rym: Oh my god.

173
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:56,829
Rym: Well money wise maybe not online content wise but I digress.

174
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,310
Rym: So I go to this GameStop and now I expected a line.

175
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,919
Rym: There's always a line not just that a lot GameStop has.

176
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,010
Scott: the biggest lines of any GameStop thing is every GameStop.

177
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,860
Rym: I've realized now that of the last like six times.

178
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,450
Rym: I've gone into any GameStop anywhere in this country.

179
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:22,010
Rym: I have walked out having put down the thing I was going to purchase and left in disgust because the line just didn't move well except for the one in Baltimore.

180
00:10:23,112 --> 00:10:24,157
Scott: Did I buy something there?

181
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:26,950
Scott: I don't remember if you bought anything there, but it was a pleasant experience.

182
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,093
Rym: It was.

183
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,785
Rym: but I wanted to buy something and I think I remember failing.

184
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:31,830
Scott: what did you want to buy?

185
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,372
Rym: I don't know.

186
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:33,542
Rym: every time I go to a GameStop.

187
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:39,570
Rym: There's some old used game I want to buy but I always go walk up to the counter and there's always two people two employees.

188
00:10:40,254 --> 00:10:50,249
Rym: One of them is dealing with the kid who's selling like every video game He's owning and the other one should stand there not doing anything and I usually go god Damn it after ten minutes put my thing down and walk away.

189
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:53,590
Scott: Yeah, that happened one time pretty badly.

190
00:10:53,892 --> 00:10:57,030
Rym: Well that happened to me when I went to the GameStop in Times Square not too long ago.

191
00:10:57,314 --> 00:10:58,994
Rym: Well, not not Rockefeller But it close enough.

192
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:05,562
Rym: and it happened to me again when I went to 34th Street Because there was one dude man in the line that went out the door.

193
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:10,023
Rym: even though worms was cheaper It was like 28 bucks for some reason.

194
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:13,269
Rym: I Wasn't gonna stand in line for an hour and change.

195
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,710
Scott: This is why I've been buying all my video games on Amazon.

196
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:21,470
Scott: The only problem with buying video games on Amazon is that they might come like a few days after the game comes out.

197
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,630
Scott: So you're not gonna get the game on the release date, but you just go online.

198
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:29,630
Scott: You click your mouse and then the game shows up at your door with no trouble.

199
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,255
Scott: You know what doesn't get better than that.

200
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:42,870
Rym: release date only mattered when I thought that I would care about the online offerings and Now that Nintendo Wi-Fi is pretty much useless Doesn't matter if I own the game the day it comes out or not.

201
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:52,470
Scott: the only game that I care about getting it on the release date is of course the Smash Brothers which I Ordered from EB world calm or which is you know, guess is the same as GameStop calm.

202
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,988
Scott: so we'll see if they can actually deliver the game like the day after the release date.

203
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:59,520
Scott: or if Yeah, we'll see what happens with that.

204
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,510
Rym: I think I'll live if I don't get that game right away.

205
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:06,330
Scott: Yeah, I just figured you know cuz Amazon was back in before the game got delayed.

206
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:14,129
Scott: Amazon's estimated ship date for the game was like a month after it was supposed to come out So I ordered it from the other site instead.

207
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:27,430
Rym: But the all this comes together in that I have a tradition not really tradition more of a One of those things that allows you to live your life in a way that is better.

208
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:30,650
Rym: It's kind of like you have a rule and you might forget why you had the rule.

209
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:34,621
Rym: But anytime you break that rule you suddenly remember why that rules.

210
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:35,143
Rym: they're like.

211
00:12:35,644 --> 00:12:43,690
Rym: don't pet the weird animals at the zoo Don't go poke a hippo, especially if it's angry, especially if it's a hippo hungry hungry.

212
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:59,670
Rym: but When I went to that GameStop, I realized that I had vowed long ago that from the end of September until the middle of January I will go nowhere near a retail establishment unless I am forced to because except the grocery store.

213
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,479
Rym: Yeah, I consider that necessary food and not so much retail.

214
00:13:04,021 --> 00:13:05,605
Scott: Yeah, it counts as retail.

215
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:06,989
Scott: I guess not wholesale.

216
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:13,210
Rym: I don't think many people count that as retail anyway, and yeah, I made that mistake.

217
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:20,017
Rym: I went to that goddamn GameStop, you know how long it took me to fight my way into the door let alone to fight my way back out let

218
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:20,659
Scott: alone even get in

219
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:28,567
Rym: near the place because all the people who were shopping for Christmas and Once Thanksgiving comes wealth God, I'm just not even to get in my car.

220
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:35,999
Scott: Yeah I just don't go to stores in the winter until you know the worst January around here.

221
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:48,430
Rym: you pretty much can't drive north because once Thanksgiving goes by The road that goes by the mall is pretty much a sea of people trying and failing to get into the mall until January.

222
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:54,050
Scott: Yep, so, you know I went and I it since I am a dad.

223
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:55,373
Rym: What was that?

224
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:56,718
Scott: Yeah near my work.

225
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,445
Scott: There's some stores I can go to.

226
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:04,270
Scott: so like I needed a winter hat So I just walked to the EMS near my work at like 10 and I bought a winter hat, you know.

227
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,670
Scott: So I have a way to get things if I need them, but you could have bought it online.

228
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:10,255
Scott: A winter head.

229
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:11,299
Scott: Yeah where?

230
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:12,383
Scott: and the shipping?

231
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,105
Rym: Amazon?

232
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,430
Rym: the shipping's practically nothing.

233
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:17,318
Scott: Yeah, I think I'd rather like try the head on.

234
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:17,960
Scott: it was $15.

235
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,065
Rym: winter heads all fit the same.

236
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:20,848
Scott: No, they don't.

237
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:21,650
Scott: Yeah different sizes.

238
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,541
Rym: There's three sizes little kid normal and big head.

239
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:26,764
Scott: No, there's different side.

240
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:27,366
Scott: No, there aren't.

241
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,569
Rym: they're all the same.

242
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:33,289
Rym: Wint knit like winter hats are all identical except that mine had a Zelda on it.

243
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,085
Scott: Well, the ones on the internet here more expensive.

244
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:42,738
Scott: So yeah military Gore-tex cap black 20 bucks.

245
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,182
Rym: get the one like George stands ahead.

246
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:45,526
Scott: What kind of do you have?

247
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:46,729
Rym: Yeah that big Russian thing.

248
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,820
Scott: No, you know how much those cost?

249
00:14:48,981 --> 00:14:54,360
Scott: Yes, like a zillion dollars There's a real full wall a real fur on the side of those things.

250
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,844
Rym: That's not wool fur.

251
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:57,689
Scott: It's for animals.

252
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:06,728
Rym: Anyway things of the day.

253
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,910
Rym: Surprisingly I had not actually seen this before.

254
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:13,583
Rym: It's a bunch of deleted scenes from the life of Brian.

255
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:15,490
Scott: Oh you took my future thing today.

256
00:15:17,311 --> 00:15:18,416
Scott: It's gonna use that.

257
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:20,084
Rym: I said I was using it.

258
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:32,522
Rym: No, yes But yeah, the one thing I can say is that whenever there are deleted scenes especially from Monty Python stuff They're usually not that funny whenever this deleted scenes from anything.

259
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:34,670
Scott: There's usually a reason that they were deleted.

260
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:42,090
Rym: They're two times either it was deleted because it wasn't that good or it was deleted because of censoring.

261
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,884
Rym: Yeah in the case of the latter.

262
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:44,570
Rym: It's usually hilarious.

263
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,581
Scott: Usually sometimes it's deleted for other reasons though.

264
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:50,390
Scott: Like just they ran out of time in the episodes.

265
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:54,248
Scott: They took out the least funny joke, but least funny joke is still pretty funny.

266
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:54,770
Scott: that could happen.

267
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,073
Rym: Yeah more and more.

268
00:15:57,134 --> 00:16:02,450
Rym: I feel like a lot of movies purposefully have deleted scenes just so they can put them in the extras.

269
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:09,704
Scott: Yeah, I think they're purposefully like, you know, they people just come up with scenes and they film them all and then in editing You know some of them they just don't put in.

270
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:15,010
Scott: or you know They know they're filming more scenes and then they then they're gonna put in the movie in the first place.

271
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:17,043
Rym: yeah, but these scenes are all about.

272
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:25,241
Rym: it looks like semi-nazi but ottoman style German suicide soldier extravaganza.

273
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:27,429
Rym: It's just a bunch more with those guys.

274
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,860
Scott: Yeah, it's those guys.

275
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:40,184
Rym: It's pretty funny like the part at the end there It's funnier than the deleted scene from Bonnie Python and the Holy Grail Which no it was never actually filmed or at least if it was.

276
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:41,290
Rym: we don't have any footage of it.

277
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:47,430
Rym: I've seen an animated version of it where people did the voices and I have the script for it, but it's not that funny.

278
00:16:47,512 --> 00:16:48,329
Scott: No, it's really not.

279
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:56,616
Rym: I think the only good joke in that at all was there's a bunch of archers that only have one leg and where they're marching They go left left Left.

280
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:58,290
Scott: I wonder how they were gonna film that.

281
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:01,270
Scott: That's probably why I didn't make it into the movie.

282
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,916
Scott: Yeah They gotta have all those one-legged guys hopping.

283
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:05,219
Rym: actually what's really weird.

284
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:13,289
Rym: if you ever read the original screenplay like the early treatment of Monty Python and the Holy Grail It's a totally different movie.

285
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:20,329
Scott: Well, you know if you if you have a plan to make a movie and you go to make that it ends with God not Knowing how to drive an automatic.

286
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:27,496
Scott: Yeah But I mean if you make if you make a plan to make a movie and you go to make that movie you'll end Up with something pretty close to the plan.

287
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,273
Scott: if you got a plan to make a movie and you get drunk and then try To make that movie.

288
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:35,302
Scott: It's gonna be nothing like the plan and you know what they did.

289
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,346
Scott: the latter.

290
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:38,899
Rym: Ah Graham Chapman We hardly knew ye.

291
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,657
Scott: All right So I can do my thing of the day.

292
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:43,139
Rym: I guess.

293
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:43,460
Scott: All right.

294
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,306
Scott: Well, we were talking about Phoenix Wright before right?

295
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:48,595
Scott: We were yep You like you like Phoenix, right?

296
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:51,945
Rym: I think I made my statement earlier about that.

297
00:17:51,985 --> 00:17:52,486
Rym: It's okay.

298
00:17:52,847 --> 00:17:56,403
Rym: Well, it's pretty funny I like those Phoenix wrongs until they got stupid.

299
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:08,528
Scott: Yeah, well imagine if you took the lolcats Which are pretty amusing and the Phoenix right and you combine them and you had a great quantity and varying quality.

300
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:10,598
Rym: I See what you did there.

301
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:14,364
Scott: Here's a gallery of Phoenix Wright lolcats.

302
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:18,345
Scott: and Well, some of them are lol and some of them are epic lol.

303
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:21,195
Scott: and some of them are Oh.

304
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:26,570
Rym: and I should point out because Scott didn't tell me until I saw one spoilers for the love of fucking God spoilers.

305
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:36,294
Scott: Yeah, some of these are pretty spoiler epic Like someone will say I'm in your blank blank in your blank and that's like the what happens at the end of one of the mystery Cases or whatever.

306
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:41,810
Rym: now granted one of those spoilers that I actually knew what happened in was uh, hilarious.

307
00:18:42,272 --> 00:18:50,807
Scott: Shall we say yeah, some of them aren't spoilers to you know, some of them are miss spoilers But if you look at all these and you haven't played all the Phoenix rights, you're good.

308
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:52,353
Scott: Well, there's no spoilers I guess for Phoenix.

309
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:55,769
Scott: right for but the spoilers for one two and three, but that's it.

310
00:18:56,271 --> 00:19:01,290
Scott: So yeah Phoenix Wright fan, you owe it to yourself to look at these here and get some lol's.

311
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:07,266
Rym: So back at Connecticut last year, which is an awesome con you can pretty much guarantee.

312
00:19:07,306 --> 00:19:16,109
Rym: We'll be guests again this year, but we did a panel on German board gaming and board games in general and we got a guy in the audience who Really?

313
00:19:16,952 --> 00:19:17,737
Scott: Hayes a hassler.

314
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:18,421
Rym: No, I was gonna.

315
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:32,150
Rym: he really wanted us to talk about American board games and we shouldn't you know slight the American efforts in the field of board gaming because American efforts are just as valid and important to the the medium of board gaming as the German and French efforts.

316
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,570
Rym: So I thought it was about time for us to talk about an American board game.

317
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:44,107
Scott: Well, actually we were gonna talk about an extremely German game But since we only ever played it once or twice I decided to not do that and do something else.

318
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:45,456
Rym: Oh you decided That's right.

319
00:19:45,497 --> 00:19:46,569
Scott: I decided it was my idea.

320
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:47,594
Rym: I actually know.

321
00:19:47,614 --> 00:19:51,870
Rym: I think the reason I decided not to do that was that I want to have Alex on board for that show.

322
00:19:51,995 --> 00:20:01,629
Rym: since He has as much experience as me which is twice as much as you and I figure between the three of us We I think we should just play more before we do that show.

323
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:25,788
Rym: yeah, the real issue there is just that we actually came to an epiphany and realized that we had beaten and become dissatisfied with almost every board game we had ever owned and We realized there's only two directions to go that game which is pretty much the last bastion of fiddling with abstract cubes and Then the other direction which is all the way abstract and just playing.

324
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:29,842
Rym: go Maybe but anyway, well my go boards in the mail.

325
00:20:29,902 --> 00:20:31,489
Scott: So yeah, so we're gonna.

326
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:38,603
Scott: today We're gonna talk about an American board game that when I was a kid I liked it a lot and now I hate it to death.

327
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:44,650
Rym: I can say this when I was a little kid I liked it in terms of playing it with the family.

328
00:20:45,192 --> 00:21:04,430
Rym: But at the same time I often angered my family because I would pretty much constantly throughout the game Whenever anyone and in any way insinuated that them doing better or worse than anyone else had anything to do with skill I would begin the argument that I always began which was we'd might as well just flip a coin.

329
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:07,330
Rym: This game has about as much skill as flipping a coin.

330
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:12,477
Rym: In fact, I could probably affect the outcome of a coin flip more so than I can.

331
00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:18,410
Rym: the outcome of this game and My family would always say I was just a curmudgeon who couldn't just lighten up and enjoy a fun board game with the family.

332
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:19,314
Rym: Mm-hmm.

333
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:28,162
Rym: We're talking about probably one of the more Derided yet well-known games in America and that is the game of life.

334
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:34,884
Scott: and we're not talking about you know, the the mathematical Game of life, you know that computer science students will study.

335
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:36,270
Rym: that game is awesome.

336
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:37,515
Scott: That is an awesome game.

337
00:21:37,555 --> 00:21:38,579
Scott: That's not really a game.

338
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,427
Scott: You can play so much, but you can.

339
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:41,190
Scott: yeah, you can.

340
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,722
Rym: There is a game that is based in that game.

341
00:21:44,862 --> 00:21:45,324
Scott: That's true.

342
00:21:45,544 --> 00:21:47,230
Rym: It's kind of like that 7-up spot game.

343
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:54,070
Scott: Yeah, but you know if you want to learn about that game of life I suggest you go ask Google about it or wait for us to do a show about it or something.

344
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:59,670
Rym: No We're talking about a game that is designed to teach children a few important things about life.

345
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:09,469
Rym: Like for example, if you don't go to college You're gonna lose - the more kids you have the more money you'll have.

346
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,415
Rym: Not true In the game, it's true.

347
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:13,217
Rym: It's patently true.

348
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:17,430
Rym: three life insurance will always pay out for car insurance.

349
00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:20,370
Rym: We'll never pay out normal fire insurance.

350
00:22:20,731 --> 00:22:22,057
Rym: I don't even know why that was in the game.

351
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:30,010
Scott: and right before you're ready to retire You've got one shot to make it big like super big and if you fail, you'll be super poor.

352
00:22:30,493 --> 00:22:36,036
Rym: There's pretty much two options in life Millionaire tycoon or Philosopher.

353
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:37,450
Rym: I like how philosophers?

354
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,358
Scott: Well, no, this millionaire is the default millionaire.

355
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:45,913
Scott: tycoon is the super lucky and philosopher is the not as the sucky I love.

356
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:49,606
Rym: I love a game that teaches you that philosopher means you lost.

357
00:22:49,948 --> 00:22:53,263
Rym: Yeah, of course I guess if money is the game that's probably true.

358
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:54,770
Scott: All right, so the game of life.

359
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,753
Scott: Here's how this game works.

360
00:22:55,813 --> 00:23:08,750
Rym: Everyone has a car and in that car you put yourself now it has to be there's a little pink Phallus for a man and a little above well for a woman, I guess Blue phallus for a man, I guess the pink phallus is to represent Rym.

361
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:11,628
Rym: They're these little Peggy things and they stick in the car.

362
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:20,124
Scott: But and so you drive your car and the fur and basically the way the game works is you spin this spinner Which is numbers one to ten and then you move that many spaces.

363
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:23,135
Scott: and if there's a fork in the road you can choose which way to go.

364
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:27,649
Scott: and every time you pass a payday spot you get your salary.

365
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:32,484
Scott: and If you land on a payday spot, I think you get your salary and a card.

366
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:34,673
Scott: whatever this is cards You can ignore.

367
00:23:35,437 --> 00:23:37,789
Scott: and if there's a fork in the road, you can choose which way to go.

368
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:44,950
Scott: The game is Candyland plus money pretty much and I guess why I liked it when I was a kid.

369
00:23:45,011 --> 00:23:45,638
Scott: Let's start with that.

370
00:23:46,043 --> 00:23:50,249
Scott: when I was a kid I liked it because you actually got to choose which way you were gonna go.

371
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,418
Scott: So it felt like you were making some decisions.

372
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,021
Scott: see now.

373
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:54,547
Rym: Here's the real issue.

374
00:23:54,587 --> 00:24:01,210
Rym: my family Decided when I was a kid that it was cheating to count ahead at a fork to figure out where you'd land.

375
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,153
Scott: I was bullshit.

376
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:02,655
Rym: She was the best.

377
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:03,036
Scott: everyone.

378
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:04,882
Scott: everyone can count whatever they way they want.

379
00:24:05,203 --> 00:24:09,195
Rym: So they made a rule you can't count and I just counted.

380
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:11,344
Rym: and as a result, I don't think any of them did.

381
00:24:11,364 --> 00:24:12,570
Rym: I don't think anyone else cheated but me.

382
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:14,544
Rym: So as a result, I tend I wasn't cheating.

383
00:24:14,565 --> 00:24:15,189
Scott: you're allowed to count.

384
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:16,356
Scott: Yeah, sort of the pull.

385
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:19,714
Rym: the other thing was I could spin the spinner to whatever number I wanted But that was so.

386
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:20,901
Scott: that's because the spinner suck.

387
00:24:20,921 --> 00:24:21,424
Scott: They should use a d10.

388
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:27,243
Scott: Anyway there yeah, and then see you move the number of space on the spinner.

389
00:24:27,263 --> 00:24:32,050
Scott: you land on a space and you do what the space says and Eventually you get to the end of the game.

390
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,950
Scott: So why else did I like it when I was a kid?

391
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:40,693
Scott: the other reason I liked it was because in monopoly what the biggest dollar bill was like 500 right in The game of life.

392
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:45,190
Scott: The smallest bill is a thousand and you can get the biggest one was a hundred thousand.

393
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,933
Scott: They were whites.

394
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:49,990
Scott: Yeah, it was like you had mad monies playing this game and it felt really good.

395
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:50,632
Scott: We're a little kid.

396
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:52,078
Scott: Just have like a zillion dollars.

397
00:24:52,098 --> 00:24:55,110
Scott: You're like, oh man, look how much money I got.

398
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:58,270
Rym: You can also get promissory notes and go into debt.

399
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:03,763
Scott: Yeah if you end a debt they gave you these $20,000 promissory notes and it was like you had to pay them back.

400
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:04,184
Scott: and it was.

401
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:05,710
Scott: it really sucked if you got him.

402
00:25:06,031 --> 00:25:11,130
Scott: But I always sort of wanted him because they sat there unused because no one was ever bad enough to actually get them bad enough.

403
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:14,402
Rym: That that is that you can't be bad at that game there.

404
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:16,370
Rym: You cannot make poor decisions.

405
00:25:16,711 --> 00:25:19,884
Rym: The only decision you can make that's bad is skipping college.

406
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:22,869
Scott: Yep, right at the beginning of the game Oh and buying fire insurance?

407
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,928
Scott: Yeah, right at the beginning of the game you can.

408
00:25:25,969 --> 00:25:27,179
Scott: you know There's a little this.

409
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,843
Scott: you make a few spaces But then you can choose to go right or left.

410
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:30,529
Scott: if you go, right?

411
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,505
Scott: You have to go through a lot of spaces and it's gonna take you a lot longer.

412
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:42,530
Scott: if you go left You can run through really quickly to sort of you know Get ahead of everyone and sort of beat the game faster, which has advantages.

413
00:25:43,152 --> 00:25:52,008
Scott: But you'll only get like a high school diploma if you go that way and your salary will be shit if you go the long Way, you have a chance of landing on.

414
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:58,270
Scott: you know Different degrees in from college and you could land on like doctor and your payday will be like 40,000.

415
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,130
Scott: And I think if you go to high school your payday is like 16,000.

416
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,247
Scott: So you're gonna end the game with almost no money if you do the high school thing.

417
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:08,254
Rym: Yeah Yeah, there was also.

418
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:13,473
Rym: I mean going ahead had the one advantage in that there was the bridge and the first dude to cross The bridge.

419
00:26:13,513 --> 00:26:15,404
Rym: that was always a big deal when you're playing it as a kid.

420
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:16,329
Rym: Oh shit the bridge.

421
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,122
Rym: Everyone across after had to pay a toll to whoever crossed at first.

422
00:26:20,624 --> 00:26:22,170
Scott: Yeah, the bridge is pretty close to the end of the game.

423
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,890
Rym: Though yeah, it just meant you got a bunch of money from everyone.

424
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,712
Scott: Yep The other.

425
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:28,744
Scott: the other thing in the game that you can do is some spaces you land on.

426
00:26:28,764 --> 00:26:52,422
Scott: well some spaces you pass Allow you to buy insurance and it's pretty much you can choose yes or no for auto Yes and no for life yes and no for fire and all they do is During the game you might land on a space that says hey if you've got insurance do this if you don't have insurance do this and it's usually good if you have insurance and bad if you don't and So it costs money to buy the insurance.

427
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:56,090
Scott: you have to decide, you know What are the odds that I'm gonna need this insurance?

428
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:00,085
Scott: Is it gonna make a profit for me in the long run and at the end of the game?

429
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:01,028
Scott: if you still have?

430
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:01,530
Scott: because sometimes?

431
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:09,047
Scott: You might lose your insurance if you still have insurance at the end of the game some of them you can turn into money Like you can turn your life insurance into money at the end of the game.

432
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:10,839
Scott: What else that?

433
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,850
Scott: the only other thing in the game?

434
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:17,990
Scott: Is that some spaces you land on give you children and wives and kids and all that stuff and you fill up your car with?

435
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,605
Scott: People besides yourself and the more people you have the more money you get.

436
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:24,288
Scott: so you want to get lots of people And that's the whole game.

437
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:29,690
Rym: For some reason this game has kind of legendary iconic status in the United States.

438
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:36,850
Rym: Everyone's played it a lot of people like it a lot even people who are not six years old which kind of surprises.

439
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,273
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

440
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:48,366
Scott: it's like one of those big games in this country You know, it's very historic like Monopoly Scrabble the game of life Like these are like big, you know, very big parts of like Americana in a way these games.

441
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:58,050
Rym: but the game now I mean not only was it not a game I mean it was about the same level as candy land, but it went once every land with one step further.

442
00:27:58,111 --> 00:27:58,393
Scott: That's it.

443
00:27:58,454 --> 00:28:08,645
Rym: But the step further it went was that every choice you made there was the Obviously clearly superior choice and the stupid choice the.

444
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:10,490
Rym: I want to lose this game choice.

445
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:11,835
Rym: There was no middle ground.

446
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:12,658
Rym: There was no debate.

447
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,842
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't.

448
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:14,785
Scott: it wasn't like.

449
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:23,207
Scott: huh, man You know if I go around the board this way I might become a doctor and at least I'm gonna be like, you know a teacher make some money.

450
00:28:23,488 --> 00:28:30,938
Scott: if I go this way Broke-ass poor and even though I might have a chance of getting to the game for end faster That's not gonna make up for the money.

451
00:28:30,998 --> 00:28:31,520
Scott: I'm gonna lose.

452
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,870
Scott: there is no reason to ever skip college ever.

453
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,830
Scott: That's the dumb it.

454
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:38,633
Scott: You just lose if you do that unless everyone does that or so Why would you do that?

455
00:28:38,995 --> 00:28:42,290
Rym: life insurance cost pretty much nothing at the end of the game?

456
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,220
Rym: I believe it's worth a hundred thousand.

457
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,009
Scott: It's worth a lot of money at the end of the game.

458
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,290
Scott: There's no reason not to buy life insurance.

459
00:28:48,723 --> 00:28:53,560
Scott: I mean Even if it never pays off on any spot Even if you land on every spot on the board.

460
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,930
Scott: that says haha life insurance you lose.

461
00:28:56,775 --> 00:28:59,330
Scott: If you still hold on to at the end of the game, you're okay.

462
00:28:59,712 --> 00:29:03,508
Scott: The only way it can fuck you is if you buy it and you happen to land on like the one space.

463
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:04,854
Scott: that says lose Your life insurance.

464
00:29:05,116 --> 00:29:13,310
Rym: now, not only was the game completely random But they added this extra fuck you at the end where you see, you know, we talked earlier.

465
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,859
Rym: You can win or you can double win.

466
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,683
Rym: tycoon win.

467
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:19,734
Rym: Mm-hmm anyone at the end of the game Can choose.

468
00:29:19,854 --> 00:29:24,958
Scott: well, I think what it is is as you approach the end of the game right on the board You're getting to the final space on the board.

469
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,946
Scott: The final space on the board is millionaire.

470
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:31,564
Scott: retire in style right a few spaces before that like five spaces before.

471
00:29:31,624 --> 00:29:41,980
Scott: that is the day of Reckoning space and when you get to the day of reckoning space no matter what you spun you have to stop there And there's a whole big set of stuff you have to do on the day of reckoning.

472
00:29:42,462 --> 00:29:44,930
Scott: and then you decide are you gonna?

473
00:29:45,691 --> 00:29:54,930
Scott: Bet it all I'm becoming the millionaire tycoon and the instant winner or Are you going to just end the game normally and hope you have more money than everyone else that you can win?

474
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,589
Rym: Which money is not secret so you can pretty much just calculate that.

475
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:04,438
Scott: Yeah, so it's like huh you look at how much money you have and you figure out how much money you're gonna have after you Land on the millionaire.

476
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:05,489
Rym: I always hid my money.

477
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:11,575
Scott: Yeah, you look at how much money everyone else has and you say well if I end the game normally do I have a chance Of winning?

478
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:15,961
Scott: if yes Then just end the game and you just go to the end now.

479
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:19,915
Scott: if no you might as well gamble on the one in ten Chance of automatically winning.

480
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:21,301
Rym: now the rules were very clear.

481
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:23,370
Rym: There's this little rainbow board.

482
00:30:23,511 --> 00:30:25,347
Rym: It's like a strip has one to ten on it.

483
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:29,684
Rym: You take all your money and your car and everything you've got in front of you.

484
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:33,042
Rym: your insurance is your cards And you put them on one of those numbers.

485
00:30:33,546 --> 00:30:37,303
Rym: then you spin And if you make that number game ends immediately.

486
00:30:37,624 --> 00:30:38,608
Rym: you double win.

487
00:30:38,688 --> 00:30:39,792
Rym: everyone else It's over.

488
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:42,081
Scott: you win one in ten chance of just winning.

489
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:56,269
Scott: so no matter what you did the whole game No matter what even if you became the shitty teacher even if you you know just spent all your money even if you're holding a Fistful of promissory notes at the end of the game you have a one intense ten chance of just automatically winning no matter what?

490
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,403
Scott: Has has that for a good game it?

491
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:05,179
Rym: I mean on one hand I would say oh well maybe the game is good for kids because it's simple like Candyland and all that.

492
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:14,712
Rym: but What really bothered me was that the game of life kind of got re-released a bunch of times and From what I've read of the re-releases they dumbed it down.

493
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:17,280
Rym: that game wasn't dumb enough for kids today.

494
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:21,339
Scott: Well, I know that the version I had was slightly different from the version like my parents had.

495
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:23,967
Rym: well I had the like 1960s version.

496
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:26,654
Scott: I had I think the 1990 early 90s version.

497
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:32,980
Scott: so but yeah like The game also had these cards that you could get at certain times, and they let you do stuff.

498
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,687
Scott: But we mostly ignored those cards.

499
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:35,591
Rym: I don't remember that.

500
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:40,680
Scott: yeah, they were sort of like community chess cards But not really sure those that weren't just in your newfangled version.

501
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,352
Scott: They might have been but that made the game more complex.

502
00:31:43,413 --> 00:31:46,599
Scott: so as opposed to the more simple It's like consider that a good thing.

503
00:31:47,262 --> 00:31:51,795
Scott: I think you got one if you landed on a payday instead of going past one.

504
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,320
Scott: I don't remember exactly.

505
00:31:53,922 --> 00:32:01,946
Rym: I just I really I can't understand why this game is popular among people or why it is retained its status as like the game Americans play.

506
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,454
Rym: they play Monopoly they play this.

507
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:10,920
Scott: there are a lot of American games that boil down to roll the dice or spin the spinner and move forward that many spaces and see what the board says.

508
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,746
Scott: I mean Monopoly careers Candyland, Uncle Wiggly The game of life.

509
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:22,540
Scott: there's a whole bunch of them, and they're all the same exact game pretty much shoots and ladders.

510
00:32:22,801 --> 00:32:23,571
Scott: Oh, it's just ladders.

511
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:27,004
Scott: actually good Trouble.

512
00:32:27,064 --> 00:32:29,280
Rym: sorry right there was one good game.

513
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:32,344
Rym: It was called payday, and I remember pretty much It was.

514
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:39,534
Rym: you have to make it through the week and pay all your bills With your paycheck, and it was kind of learn about managing money.

515
00:32:39,976 --> 00:32:43,973
Scott: learn not to waste money on Educational game even if it wasn't a strategy game.

516
00:32:44,154 --> 00:32:46,880
Rym: It was also a little bit strategic But yeah.

517
00:32:47,402 --> 00:32:56,533
Scott: so the thing that all these games have different is the theme and I guess it was the theme of the game of life that Really carried it along as opposed to you know the game itself.

518
00:32:56,955 --> 00:33:01,071
Rym: the theme was just kind of very like 1950s idyllic.

519
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:08,560
Rym: you Marry a nice young person, then you have a million kids, and then you retire after working your whole life.

520
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:11,340
Scott: It's pretty much the American dream guaranteed.

521
00:33:12,342 --> 00:33:15,630
Rym: Well, no because if you failed you could millionaire tycoon.

522
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:24,160
Rym: you became a philosopher, and it showed this sad little goat Sad little farm right next to the mansion where everyone else was living.

523
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,520
Scott: I always kind of wanted to be the philosopher because it was like that space on the board didn't really get used.

524
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:30,370
Rym: Ah that was the other thing I did.

525
00:33:30,773 --> 00:33:33,786
Rym: I always run for millionaire tycoon No matter what really because.

526
00:33:33,806 --> 00:33:37,016
Scott: and then why even bother doing anything the rest of the game?

527
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:37,738
Scott: because it's just.

528
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:39,063
Scott: you might as well Just spin the spinner.

529
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:39,224
Scott: right.

530
00:33:39,244 --> 00:33:52,616
Rym: at the beginning rationale was that all right mom and dad and brother I would rather be a philosopher, so if I have the chance of being super wealthy But also a philosopher why am I not gonna take that chance?

531
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,806
Scott: yeah, it's like The only thing about the.

532
00:33:56,147 --> 00:33:56,889
Scott: I say I win.

533
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,976
Scott: the only thing about becoming the philosopher.

534
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:03,680
Scott: the only reason you don't do it at The beginning of the game is because whoever gets there first has the first dibs at it.

535
00:34:03,821 --> 00:34:05,539
Scott: So it's sort of like if you do that right away.

536
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:06,946
Scott: That's not quite right.

537
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:09,998
Scott: you had to like roll a d6 to see who gets there to.

538
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:13,091
Scott: you know It's is Rick because it's whoever gets there first is completely random.

539
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:24,239
Rym: Well that you could do is just Flip a coin or roll the dice to figure out who wins and then roll a d10 for everyone in Order of the number they got on the first die to see if no they win.

540
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:31,245
Scott: And I don't know because then the person who goes last sorta has an advantage because if no one else wins Then they automatically win.

541
00:34:31,304 --> 00:34:33,475
Scott: They don't have to roll the d10 well.

542
00:34:33,495 --> 00:34:34,277
Rym: No they just have a 10% chance.

543
00:34:36,281 --> 00:34:38,730
Scott: Well, I guess it's temporary.

544
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:41,379
Rym: whatever it works believe me it works.

545
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,609
Scott: Anyway the game of life is a pretty sad game.

546
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:47,716
Scott: I don't recommend playing it.

547
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:48,980
Rym: see it's not even.

548
00:34:49,562 --> 00:34:53,980
Rym: I mean, I guess it was nominally fun when I was a kid, but that was mostly because I played it with my family.

549
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,503
Scott: Yeah, it was cuz.

550
00:34:54,543 --> 00:34:58,200
Scott: I played it with my family my relatives, and you know we were kids We didn't really understand.

551
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,465
Scott: We like to play with.

552
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:06,813
Scott: we'd like to put the people in the cars and drop the cars around and play with huge amounts of Money, but as a kid once I played monopoly.

553
00:35:07,215 --> 00:35:12,480
Rym: while it wasn't a great game Skill mattered a lot more there than it did in life.

554
00:35:13,002 --> 00:35:13,785
Scott: Oh, I sure did.

555
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,174
Rym: I pretty much hated the game of life from the day.

556
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,920
Rym: I knew the game monopoly onward.

557
00:35:18,603 --> 00:35:19,718
Scott: Yeah, it's something like that.

558
00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:25,520
Rym: I just feel like if you're a parent and you got a kid give him Carcassonne or at least give him Monopoly.

559
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,554
Scott: But the game of life they have kids of Catan that you can get and get.

560
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:29,880
Scott: have your three-year-old playing the settlers.

561
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:36,332
Rym: I'll say that I think the game of life has absolutely no redeeming qualities Other than to make fun of.

562
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:40,860
Scott: retroactively I I think I'm gonna show you the first redeeming quality of the game of life.

563
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:48,731
Scott: Oh, everyone's gonna tell their stories of the game of life in the forum for fun times ah But even then it's pretty much retroactive.

564
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,374
Rym: making fun of.

565
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:57,839
Rym: yeah pretty much I guess one use it could have is that if you force a kid to play the game of life Then he's gonna appreciate settlers a lot more.
