1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,939
Scott: It's Thursday November 3rd, and this is keep nights with Rym and Scott.

2
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:17,218
Scott: All right Let's do this.

3
00:00:18,162 --> 00:00:20,839
Rym: So I couldn't get home from work today.

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,199
Scott: Yeah, and again my phone sucks at telling me when I have voicemail.

5
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:31,297
Rym: So I'm at work and I figure I'm gonna leave around you like 530 cuz I got there late.

6
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:31,980
Rym: if you're I'll leave late.

7
00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:41,667
Rym: And then they announce something over the PA system Which is a big deal because when they use the PA system usually means like there's been a chemical leak or or Something like.

8
00:00:41,688 --> 00:00:43,924
Scott: we have a PA system But the work doesn't use it.

9
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:48,879
Scott: only the building can use it and it's usually like there is to fire drill.

10
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:58,687
Rym: But now I They announce that I-84 the way I go home is Blocked due to an accident.

11
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:01,280
Scott: it gets blocked all the time like when it rains.

12
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:09,891
Rym: Yeah, whenever it rains whenever it snows whenever it's dark out people just get into accidents and block it Which I wouldn't care about except that it's the only way home.

13
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:11,256
Scott: You can take the side road.

14
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:12,520
Rym: Oh, there's one side road.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,924
Rym: There are only two roads that go east and west here I-84.

16
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:19,155
Rym: and there's another crap road with a bunch of stoplights in small towns on it.

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,180
Rym: I Took the crap road because the freeway was blocked and it took me two hours to drive six miles.

18
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:32,223
Scott: I think this just might be only the stretch of 84 between your work in here because when I take 84 Home to Connecticut.

19
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:33,066
Scott: I never have a problem.

20
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:34,773
Scott: I freakin fly down that road.

21
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:36,619
Rym: You're going east and I go west.

22
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:38,564
Scott: West not so good.

23
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:41,974
Rym: No West not so good because right at the end of going home.

24
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:43,057
Scott: You're going east right?

25
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:44,789
Rym: No coming home I'm going west.

26
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,434
Rym: Oh We live next to the Hudson River.

27
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:50,044
Rym: I work East of the Hudson River.

28
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:51,268
Scott: Ah suck.

29
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:52,331
Rym: Yeah, mr.

30
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:52,974
Rym: Geography.

31
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:53,575
Scott: Yeah.

32
00:01:54,258 --> 00:02:01,960
Rym: Yeah But remember the only Hudson River crossing anywhere around here Newberg beacon bridge right there Hudson, whatever bridge.

33
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,344
Rym: Yeah, that's like 20.

34
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:05,933
Scott: and then if he goes south Tappan Zee bridge.

35
00:02:06,214 --> 00:02:09,503
Rym: Yeah, so that's farther say many miles That's near New Jersey.

36
00:02:09,685 --> 00:02:13,498
Rym: So all the traffic from all the commuters funnels into the one way.

37
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:15,509
Rym: I go home Awesome.

38
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,118
Scott: Yeah Just go the other way home.

39
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:19,544
Rym: There is no other way home.

40
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:21,009
Scott: the side road with the small towns.

41
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:25,878
Rym: see whenever I 84 blocks all the traffic all the people get off I84 and get on that road.

42
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:29,749
Scott: So why don't you go like this really roundabout way?

43
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:33,140
Rym: Because even though you'll be really I can't get to the roundabout way.

44
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:37,582
Rym: You realize there aren't many roads Around.

45
00:02:37,602 --> 00:02:40,072
Scott: couldn't you go like way north and then take 90?

46
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:40,795
Rym: All right.

47
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:41,497
Rym: What do I get on to?

48
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:42,080
Rym: go way north?

49
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,824
Scott: That road near IBM.

50
00:02:44,326 --> 00:02:50,080
Rym: Oh that little short road that is also full of traffic from people avoiding I 84 Yeah.

51
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:55,428
Rym: So I hate people and I think if you ever get in a car accident They just take your license away or something see.

52
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:59,349
Scott: while I like I don't like Being far away from work and having to commute.

53
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,599
Scott: at least I'm gonna deal with shit like that.

54
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,339
Rym: No, no, you just get on the train and it always gets there.

55
00:03:05,222 --> 00:03:07,700
Scott: Well, you know, you never know when it might be canceled or something.

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,028
Rym: They almost never cancel Metro north.

57
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:12,332
Scott: Yeah, but it could happen.

58
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:16,390
Rym: last year during that crazy blizzard They were delayed like 10 minutes.

59
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:16,812
Rym: That was it.

60
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:17,879
Scott: That's about right.

61
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:22,432
Rym: So It was a slow news day real slow.

62
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,803
Scott: I mean half the news is just Yesterday's news.

63
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,026
Rym: Yeah again.

64
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,350
Rym: Oh news flash news flash.

65
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:33,658
Scott: Libby pleaded, uh, not guilty, you know Whether you did it or not.

66
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,760
Scott: Let's say you did it right when you got those kind of charges.

67
00:03:36,864 --> 00:03:41,200
Scott: Yeah You don't say guilty because you're gonna die like the next day when they kill you.

68
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:47,880
Scott: So you're freaking say not guilty no matter what if only to delay imminent death and prison and in prison.

69
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,787
Scott: So that's not a surprise at all.

70
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:51,570
Rym: Yeah, though.

71
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:58,005
Rym: He did waive his right to a speedy trial Which means he wants to drag this out Like I just said yeah.

72
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:07,840
Scott: Yeah, if you're guilty and you know You're gonna be found guilty and there's this pile of evidence that Fitzgerald found you want to delay it as long as possible.

73
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:14,520
Rym: So, uh, you know how long they're delaying it a year the uh next hearing which just another hearing.

74
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:18,974
Rym: This isn't even the trial yet February 3rd, that's not too far away.

75
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:26,420
Scott: Yeah Yeah, but that's not think about how much time was between when OJ was driving his Ford Bronco and when OJ was actually in court.

76
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:30,259
Rym: You know, I don't even remember I was in middle school any month there many months.

77
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:34,920
Rym: I just remember that when the trial ended in middle school, they showed it on all the TVs in the school.

78
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,760
Scott: They didn't show it but someone ran around the building.

79
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,646
Rym: So they showed it and it was not guilty.

80
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,693
Rym: and I remember going son of a.

81
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:49,620
Scott: but then half my class jumped up and cheered like whoa, I Didn't even you know it had gone on so long Like I thought he did it.

82
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,704
Scott: I thought he might have not done it that I was pretty sure he did it and then I just didn't care by the time It was over.

83
00:04:55,744 --> 00:05:01,066
Scott: So when they said not guilty, I was just like oh I just remember it.

84
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:09,060
Rym: at the height of the stupid popularity of this thing I remember going to the Gibraltar Trade Center, which is like a giant flea market in Michigan where I used to live.

85
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:10,470
Scott: Okay, you see the Trade Center.

86
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,800
Scott: I'm like an office building.

87
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:15,597
Rym: No, no, like imagine a flea market bigger than RIT's entire campus.

88
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,668
Rym: All right All right in a big building.

89
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:18,734
Rym: It's a big warehouse for like.

90
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:19,620
Scott: I know those kind of things.

91
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:23,140
Rym: Yeah, they have in Florida and back then pogs were real big.

92
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:26,193
Scott: I went to a flea market in Florida when pogs are real big.

93
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:27,277
Scott: I got them pogs.

94
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:27,880
Scott: I should get them.

95
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,361
Scott: They're fun.

96
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,407
Rym: Not only were there OJ Simpson pogs.

97
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:31,410
Scott: Oh my god.

98
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,960
Rym: There was one guy who sold nothing but OJ Simpson's pogs.

99
00:05:35,665 --> 00:05:38,000
Rym: Oh my god, and he was doing brisk business.

100
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:45,199
Rym: He had a half of them that were like the juice is loose or innocent and the other half were like guilty or he's gonna Fry and they were selling in equal portions.

101
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,630
Rym: Yes, he was selling slammers.

102
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,140
Rym: He was selling the regular land.

103
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,467
Scott: See that was the problem with pogs is like.

104
00:05:51,848 --> 00:06:01,998
Scott: they had the official pog brand pogs and they were high Quality like and then they had the cheap-ass third-party knockoff pogs everywhere and wait a minute.

105
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:03,462
Rym: Wait a minute High quality.

106
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:08,579
Rym: you realize that the game of pogs is probably the stupidest game in the world second only to Conker's.

107
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:10,075
Rym: But I think even Conker's has.

108
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:14,480
Rym: I don't know Conker's but Conker's is a game they play in Britain when they were kids when people were kids.

109
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,719
Rym: I don't think anyone plays anymore.

110
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:24,967
Rym: Well, you take like a chestnut and you tie a string to it and you take turns hitting your chestnut against other people's chestnuts Until when your chestnut breaks you're out of it.

111
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:26,713
Rym: And then the last standing chestnut wins.

112
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,479
Scott: All right, Tiddlywinks is better than that.

113
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:32,540
Rym: I kind of like Conker's Pogs is at least.

114
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:36,529
Scott: It's not a game of strategy or skill or smartness, but it is.

115
00:06:36,549 --> 00:06:38,475
Scott: it's like a manual dexterity game.

116
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:49,179
Scott: You got to throw this thing Really hard and really accurately straight down to the ground And you have to hit a target that's the same size as the thing you throw.

117
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:57,808
Scott: But even if you weren't playing it for the I Really never actually played the game.

118
00:06:57,848 --> 00:07:00,420
Scott: that much, you know, I never played it ever.

119
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:04,740
Scott: I only played it once in like middle school at lunch when I really did them.

120
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:15,980
Rym: They banned him from my school right away because some kid like threw one and it hit some kid in the face whatever, but I remember because I Would always they were basically I was collecting them when I was into him.

121
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:17,949
Scott: I didn't collect that many like I remember.

122
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:20,280
Scott: I only bought him like maybe three times ever.

123
00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:26,869
Scott: Yeah, cuz I was a little impressionable kid and Cuz there was really nothing else to collect at that time.

124
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,940
Scott: It was like I was like in between things, you know It's like magic was getting kind of.

125
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:36,194
Scott: You know and you know comic books were already done.

126
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:37,800
Scott: the complex store in the mall went out of business.

127
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:40,208
Rym: See back then I had D&D and that was all I needed.

128
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:40,790
Scott: Yeah.

129
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:43,560
Scott: So anyway Pogs that that's not news.

130
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:46,011
Scott: Yeah, Pogs is definitely not new.

131
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:47,919
Rym: I'll bet they come back someday.

132
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:53,037
Scott: Dude, why don't we bring back Pogs and make a business out of it and then make an internet pog thing.

133
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:55,346
Scott: Oh my god I'm sure there's an internet pog thing.

134
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:56,390
Rym: I'm sure there is.

135
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,060
Rym: All right, I'll bet someone made an online version of Pogs.

136
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:00,865
Scott: All right, that was in flash.

137
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,349
Scott: Oh my god, that'd just be so dumb.

138
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:02,690
Scott: All right.

139
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,576
Scott: Anyway, what else is news?

140
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:15,412
Rym: Uh, Congress got rid of that act that would have let us take unlimited amounts of money from Congressmen to uh do political advertising on our little cast here.

141
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:17,740
Scott: That's not what I thought the law said.

142
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:18,800
Rym: What do you think the law said?

143
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:25,120
Scott: I think the law said that we could say whatever we wanted on blogs about the FCC interfering.

144
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:32,818
Rym: Oh, yeah No, what the law said was that campaign finance laws don't apply to the earth do should apply should not apply to the internet.

145
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:34,734
Rym: Currently they do.

146
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:45,240
Rym: Okay, the law said oh they won't which would mean that anyone who was running for an office could spend infinite money on the internet And they wouldn't even have to say they were spending that money or say who they were given that money to.

147
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:47,989
Scott: Right now candidates can spend infinite internet money.

148
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:48,772
Rym: No right now.

149
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:49,234
Rym: They cannot.

150
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:50,859
Rym: the law was gonna make it so that they can.

151
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,385
Scott: oh So they can't.

152
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:55,403
Rym: they can't okay, so That's it.

153
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,227
Scott: That's fine.

154
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:57,634
Scott: I don't want them to spend any money.

155
00:08:57,654 --> 00:08:58,056
Scott: Exactly.

156
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:01,354
Rym: That's all the law, dude People are really making a big deal on what because it seemed like some.

157
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:02,540
Scott: it was described differently.

158
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:03,616
Scott: I think you're missing some.

159
00:09:03,718 --> 00:09:07,320
Rym: no No Because you got the slash dot summary and I read the actual law.

160
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:10,834
Rym: It also had a thing about oil drilling in it and all this other crap.

161
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:12,099
Scott: Well, you know that crap.

162
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:13,378
Scott: whatever It's a Christmas tree law.

163
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:15,388
Scott: There's a bunch of ornaments all over it.

164
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:18,420
Scott: You have nothing to do with the trunk or the little pine needles.

165
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:21,048
Scott: In fact, usually all the pine needles fall off.

166
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:22,153
Scott: That's why it's a Christmas.

167
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:26,023
Rym: Yeah, all the bill really was is to Let make it so.

168
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:34,180
Rym: the internet was just free grain completely when it came to political speech, but that also included No more finance laws.

169
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,040
Rym: So you could just pay a bunch of bloggers a whole bunch of money to shill you and not have to account for that.

170
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:41,659
Rym: But yet you still have to account for if you bought a TV ad.

171
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:50,465
Scott: huh, but it seems like a lot of people are saying this is they wanted the law to go through because it would allow bloggers to Do something that they can't do currently.

172
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:51,789
Rym: What can't we do currently?

173
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:52,652
Scott: I don't know.

174
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:55,180
Scott: It seemed like they said what what?

175
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,043
Rym: What can't we do?

176
00:09:56,707 --> 00:10:02,230
Scott: it said that like, you know now we could if the law passed We would have been free to to accept a lot of money.

177
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,816
Rym: We can be as political as we want right now.

178
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:07,169
Scott: Oh So now we can accept money for our politics.

179
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:08,052
Rym: No, we can't accept.

180
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,900
Rym: Well we can but it has to be disclosed.

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,213
Rym: It's like if someone buys a political ad on TV, they have to disclose.

182
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,419
Rym: I spent this much on the ad blah blah blah.

183
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,024
Scott: Oh, so this would have a lot.

184
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:21,597
Scott: So we wanted the bill to pass so we could make out like bandits.

185
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:32,795
Rym: Yeah, basically, ah isn't nearly the free speech issue that a lot of people on slashdot and Fark were making it out to be and People in the blogosphere just busting a nut over this?

186
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,740
Rym: nothing that happened?

187
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:40,268
Scott: Maybe I'll go read it more in depth to see if we're a hundred percent accurate because that's basically Fleecing with a lot of the things I read.

188
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:44,745
Rym: a lot of people are not that I read them very and a lot of people Are real alarmist about things.

189
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,599
Scott: Hey, so, um Brown the FEMA guy, right?

00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:53,229

Rym: is he our new Jack Thompson?

197
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,358
Scott: No, he's not evil or anything.

212
00:11:54,655 --> 00:12:06,700
Scott: Mm-hmm CBS News correspondent Bob or reports that an hour later as thousands of evacuees huddled in the Superdome shelter of last resort Brown fired off another email.

214
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:21,200
Rym: I am a fashion god Alright, so we're two for two on fashion and over two on saving poor people from a hurricane.

Scott: This is the last one I'll do.

218
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,549
Scott: After the levees failed the situation grew even more desperate.

219
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:32,800
Scott: FEMA's point man in New Orleans pleaded for Brown to send more help.

220
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:37,739
Scott: That this is what the guy said to Brown, you know, the situation is past critical.

221
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:40,679
Scott: Estimates are many will die within hours.

222
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:41,963
Scott: All right.

223
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:44,999
Scott: Yeah, just four minutes later Brown wrote back.

224
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:46,586
Scott: Thanks for the update.

225
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:47,613
Scott: anything specific.

226
00:12:47,653 --> 00:12:48,659
Scott: I need to do or tweak.

227
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,690
Rym: Wow This guy is uh, I don't even know what to say.

228
00:12:58,031 --> 00:13:01,060
Scott: the following day Brown wrote to a fellow FEMA employee.

229
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:03,512
Scott: I feel like I'm getting the shit beat out of me.

230
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:04,678
Scott: that that that.

231
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:17,317
Rym: So, uh, if we learn anything from this, it's that in the event of an actual Emergency the federal government isn't gonna be anywhere to interfere with us at all.

232
00:13:17,718 --> 00:13:17,918
Scott: good.

233
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:18,440
Scott: They're incompetent.

234
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,468
Scott: I don't want them anyone near.

235
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:20,213
Scott: they'll just fuck it up.

236
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:20,515
Scott: Yeah.

237
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:21,019
Rym: Yeah.

238
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:27,553
Rym: So if there's ever some crazy disaster, like I don't know angels attack like Evangelion or something Whatever the government says to do.

239
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,340
Rym: I'll just do the opposite.

240
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:29,902
Scott: I'll just.

241
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:34,200
Scott: I won't do the opposite of whatever they say because you know, I'll figure out what to do best.

242
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,165
Rym: Oh, yeah, regardless of what they I wouldn't be sitting in that dome.

243
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:39,610
Scott: I'll tell you what, yeah, definitely not sitting in the dome.

244
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,205
Rym: So, uh, STI silicon graphics isn't doing so well.

245
00:13:44,686 --> 00:13:51,209
Scott: Well, no kidding because um, their computers are Crazy more powerful versus expensive than anyone needs.

246
00:13:51,712 --> 00:14:01,930
Scott: Yep, and no one needs Irix know and pretty much you can do a bunch of cheap You know supercomputers Linux to do better than what they give you hell depending on I mean from what they used to give you.

247
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:04,725
Rym: You could buy just one Windows machine to do some of those things now.

248
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:05,288
Scott: now.

249
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:10,230
Scott: Yeah They were good back in the day when they were the only machines that could really do the graphic action.

250
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,640
Rym: But yeah, plus they've been real pro open source.

251
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,930
Rym: Yeah, they have been but hasn't helped him Yeah, so I feel bad that a company like that that they kind of cool.

252
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,094
Rym: Okay, there was.

253
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:20,801
Scott: they're in the same business as Sun.

254
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:22,950
Scott: only Sun has other Java business stuff.

255
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:25,578
Scott: So yeah, it doesn't have anything else at all.

256
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:32,245
Scott: Yeah, though Sun also has its IBM stuff now Yeah, but hopefully we'll be able to get some cheap SDI machines.

257
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:33,170
Rym: Oh, that'd be awesome.

258
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:36,319
Scott: Yeah, just nice little good-looking SDI machine.

259
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,586
Rym: Maybe some air on chairs air on chairs.

260
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:44,713
Rym: Those aren't SDI Yeah, but if they're if they really go down there all the way they sell those to businesses though You can't get them.

261
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:45,578
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

262
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:46,080
Rym: We'll see.

263
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:47,367
Rym: I'm a business.

264
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:55,369
Scott: Yeah So, you know Radio City and every winter they have the Christmas spectacular show the ladies kicking their legs in the air.

Rym: yeah, cuz I'm just not interested in that at all.

271
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:06,790
Scott: I don't know why I've seen the show once.

272
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,794
Scott: It's not really the greatest show.

273
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:10,102
Scott: But anyway, the the musicians.

00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:12,130
Scott: Yeah, they went on strike.

275
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:16,702
Rym: Aha that's this because there's another strike going on in New York right now.

Rym: yeah Are they getting her?

282
00:15:34,073 --> 00:15:37,584
Scott: the musicians are sitting outside the theater during the little strike protest.

283
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:39,835
Scott: people just walk right into the theater and watch the show.

284
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:44,985
Scott: Wow Wow That that's it.

285
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:49,267
Rym: This wasn't canceled like our video game concert was.

286
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:55,267
Scott: yeah And the last tiny bit of news do it would is Firefox now has 10% market share.

287
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,880
Scott: Yeah, I saw that one in ten computers at the Firefox.

288
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,287
Scott: Well one in ten internet web browsers.

289
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:04,062
Rym: That's not so bad at all It's not bad.

290
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,805
Scott: Is it the point where you can start giving the finger to nine out of ten people?

291
00:16:07,825 --> 00:16:11,808
Scott: Yeah People were saying that Firefox growth is slowing down.

292
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:15,580
Scott: well Shows them.

293
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:21,734
Rym: So my thing of the day It's not anything new.

294
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,097
Rym: In fact, it's very old.

295
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:26,806
Rym: It's uh, two million or two billion years old.

296
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:30,623
Rym: It's real old and It's just something that a lot of you probably know about.

297
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:31,530
Rym: but I didn't know about it.

298
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:33,644
Rym: I found out about it and it was really cool.

299
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:34,470
Rym: I read a bunch of stuff.

300
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:40,689
Rym: All right, but in Gabon which is a country in Africa I never heard of this country.

301
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:46,356
Scott: there City or an area or something called, Oklahoma Okay.

302
00:16:46,376 --> 00:17:02,173
Rym: Hello and In the 1970s a bunch of scientists there noticed something odd and to cut to the chase because I'm not gonna go on about this Forever there was a naturally existing nuclear reactor there Naturally existing it.

303
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:14,130
Rym: just it happened when some geological events put uranium 235 and water in such a configuration That a nuclear reactor was formed and it reacted for thousands and thousands of years.

304
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,098
Scott: It says uranium heating up a water.

305
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:19,210
Scott: The water is cooling the uranium and steam is coming out.

306
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:23,141
Rym: Actually, what was happening is the uranium was visioning with itself.

307
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,685
Rym: The water was acting.

308
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,170
Rym: there's like the stream went through this uranium.

309
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:33,110
Rym: So the water was acting as a neutron What you might call it gun, no, no, no, but maybe uranium.

310
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,967
Rym: It facilitated fission, but then when it got too hot where it would like it would have exploded.

311
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:38,870
Scott: water is cooling it off.

312
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:46,195
Rym: No with all those water would evaporate away into steam and then there wouldn't be any water there and the reaction would stop and then The water come back in.

313
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:48,629
Scott: it was just like a little river with a piece of uranium in it.

314
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,066
Rym: Basically it a lot of uranium and it went fall.

315
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:55,664
Scott: It needs to be a lot Thousands of years if you got that much uranium.

316
00:17:55,684 --> 00:18:01,965
Rym: the half-life is pretty long You know, and it's a really interesting site and they're doing a lot of cool research there.

317
00:18:02,065 --> 00:18:05,029
Rym: because of the unique properties of the soil It's not reacting anymore.

318
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:11,503
Scott: Nuclear reactors are real easy to make and we shouldn't be worrying about like I ran.

319
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:13,845
Rym: actually what a lot of people are talking about Is that?

320
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,194
Rym: This made nuclear waste.

321
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:20,710
Rym: it made nuclear waste very similar to the nuclear waste our nuclear reactors make it did.

322
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,576
Scott: Yeah, it would have to and you know what.

323
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:24,564
Rym: it didn't get into the groundwater.

324
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:26,270
Rym: It didn't contaminate shit.

325
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,508
Rym: it just stayed exactly where it was buried.

326
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:32,062
Rym: and The way it's set up is a lot like the way didn't like.

327
00:18:32,162 --> 00:18:33,629
Scott: alpha particles fly off of it and shit.

328
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:37,032
Rym: alpha particles would get about a Millimeter.

329
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:39,601
Scott: Well, it's not releasing gamma rays.

330
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:40,182
Scott: I know that.

331
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:40,744
Scott: so the only other.

332
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:42,450
Scott: you could get some beta particles on there.

333
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:44,565
Rym: Um alpha particles are stopped by anything.

334
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:48,778
Scott: Well, it's like a Helium and a something an alpha particle.

335
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:52,210
Rym: an alpha particle is pretty much an atom that gets shot out.

336
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,041
Rym: Yeah, a beta particle is an electron.

337
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:55,490
Rym: a gamma ray is a gamma ray.

338
00:18:55,731 --> 00:18:58,702
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that the alpha particles like a helium.

339
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:10,707
Rym: The point is yeah that Yuka mountain is very similar and everyone who's afraid of it all the scientists know they're talking about are saying look if we bury Our waste and you come out and nothing bad will happen to it.

340
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:15,941
Rym: Aha There you go and as a result a lot of anti nuclear activists are decrying.

341
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:19,777
Rym: this is a false or a forgery or didn't really happen or It's a fluke.

342
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,746
Scott: We should take them to see it.

343
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:22,674
Rym: I'd like to go see it.

344
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:25,447
Scott: a green piece is outside the train station on my way home.

345
00:19:25,527 --> 00:19:28,681
Scott: Oh great They were talking about some forest crap.

346
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:29,888
Rym: I don't know.

347
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,818
Scott: They're like save the forest and I was like.

348
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,530
Scott: and then there's one guy who's always there and he's like save the homeless people.

349
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:39,050
Scott: And I'm like, yeah, we should cut down the forest to build homes for the homeless people.

350
00:19:39,951 --> 00:19:46,806
Rym: Well, the thing is most of the logging industry outside of like the rainforest where they're just clear-cutting and they are doing kind of bad things.

351
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:54,075
Rym: They're actually a really good industry and they plan 40 years ahead and they plan enough trees to make sure there will always be Trees for them to cut down.

352
00:19:54,417 --> 00:20:01,910
Rym: Yeah, see I'm not a preservationist But I'm definitely a conservationist and you maximize your use of the resources and minimize your negative impacts.

353
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:10,500
Rym: Yeah, the problem is Greenpeace seems to want to minimize everything and maximize Their own money making they're just nuts.

354
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:12,450
Scott: Yeah, so my thing of the day.

355
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:13,935
Scott: Yeah, so so me.

356
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:17,347
Scott: Sony has this DRM on their CDs which puts in the root kits.

357
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:17,729
Rym: Yep.

358
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,830
Rym: Yep Yep, a lot of people know about that and do we talk about that before?

359
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,199
Rym: I don't know if we did or not.

360
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,070
Rym: I don't remember anyway.

361
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,725
Scott: So if you want to put it you want to play a Sony CD in your Windows computer.

362
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:27,850
Scott: it installs this DRM.

363
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,990
Rym: Is it incredibly difficult to remove incredibly powerful?

364
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,602
Scott: Well, it's just a little root kit and it goes and it makes.

365
00:20:34,803 --> 00:20:38,429
Scott: if you try to remove it just by deleting files You end up deleting your CD ROM driver.

366
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:43,807
Rym: What it does is it kind of infects your CD ROM driver and what it does is it makes it so.

367
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:47,685
Rym: any file that has A certain prefix in the file name is 100% hidden from the operating.

368
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:52,064
Scott: It's the file name starts with dollar signs.

369
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:53,470
Scott: SYS dollar sign.

370
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:57,507
Rym: It's invisible even in safe mode even to antivirus to anything.

371
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,210
Rym: You can't see it.

372
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,278
Scott: Well, you can see it if you use a rootkit revealer.

373
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:05,950
Scott: because what it does is is it replaces the code in the operating system?

374
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,057
Scott: For listing the contents of directories.

375
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:13,615
Scott: So when you make the operating system call and you say hey operating system What's what files are here?

376
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:15,262
Scott: It won't list anything.

377
00:21:15,322 --> 00:21:16,586
Scott: that begins a dollar score.

378
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:17,530
Scott: SYS dollar sign.

379
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,836
Rym: Yep, or you can just boot into a lie.

380
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:19,480
Rym: dollar sign.

381
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,424
Scott: SYS dollar sign.

382
00:21:20,444 --> 00:21:21,550
Rym: Yeah, good game.

383
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:23,960
Scott: Anyway, World of Warcraft has spyware.

384
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,390
Rym: Uh, yeah, it makes sure that I'm not cheap.

385
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,594
Scott: Make sure that you're not cheating.

386
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:32,610
Scott: but it is a spyware even though that currently everyone's pretty sure they're not doing anything evil with it.

387
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,832
Scott: They are sending your list of processes and such to to Processes.

388
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:40,527
Rym: also a list of the title of every window you have open.

389
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:46,230
Scott: Yep And all kinds of you have to have Firefox open to like one page and the name of the page is like child porn.

390
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,502
Rym: They got a list of whatever websites you're looking at while you're playing World of Warcraft.

391
00:21:49,863 --> 00:21:50,023
Scott: Yep.

392
00:21:50,104 --> 00:21:56,005
Scott: Well the page you're looking at right now Yeah, but anyway, you know, I don't think they're actually looking at that information.

393
00:21:56,145 --> 00:21:57,510
Scott: I think they're really just looking for cheating.

394
00:21:57,771 --> 00:22:01,250
Rym: I figure they have no vested interest in finding out but that's not the point.

395
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,109
Scott: The point is that they shouldn't be doing that with the spyware or such.

396
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:05,894
Scott: Yeah, here's the trick.

397
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:17,170
Scott: if you install the Sony DRM and you rename your cheat files to dollar sign SYS dollar sign World of Warcraft can't get you cheating.

398
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:26,608
Rym: You know fight fire with flamethrower, you know, you know, I got one thing to say to that Leroy Jenkins.

399
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:30,939
Scott: So, uh, who would think this is DRM you would want?

400
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:31,761
Rym: Yeah.

401
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:33,728
Rym: I wonder how many people are gonna start cheating?

402
00:22:33,828 --> 00:22:36,647
Scott: crazily At least a few.

403
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:42,188
Rym: Yeah, and especially as the internet spreads this should be interesting when a bunch of people are running around with like 50 gold.

404
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:45,159
Rym: Yeah, 50 gold.

405
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:45,883
Scott: That's like nothing.

406
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:47,270
Rym: That's a lot in that game.

407
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:53,090
Rym: Apparently one gold piece is real valuable in World of Warcraft, but it's like silver the most current common piece or what?

408
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:55,781
Rym: There's just gold and there's just gold and it's rare.

409
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:56,946
Rym: as far as I can tell.

410
00:22:56,986 --> 00:22:57,669
Rym: I don't play the game.

411
00:22:58,732 --> 00:23:01,089
Scott: Maybe that's why this those gold miners in China.

412
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:05,586
Scott: Because apparently if one gold is rare you could freakin find a way to get a bunch of it.

413
00:23:05,606 --> 00:23:07,593
Scott: You're freaking damn There's.

414
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:08,662
Rym: it's easy to get a bunch of it.

415
00:23:08,682 --> 00:23:13,840
Rym: You get a bunch of Minimum wage or low wage workers to sit there and play World of Warcraft.

416
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,422
Scott: There you go.

417
00:23:16,668 --> 00:23:17,070
Scott: All right.

418
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:22,729
Rym: so, uh Yeah It's Thursday night and we miss college.

419
00:23:23,596 --> 00:23:29,984
Rym: We do a lot a whole lot see, we wonder really geeky school.

420
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:39,639
Rym: we went to RIT and We were surrounded and immersed but surrounded by an immersed in geekery 24/7 for pretty much four years.

421
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:42,030
Scott: It is the geekiest geekiest school.

422
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,330
Scott: There is in fact, there was that comic recently about how geeky RIT was.

423
00:23:46,932 --> 00:23:50,790
Scott: It's also like the center of like all piracy in the you internet piracy.

424
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:53,610
Rym: Remember the big piracy group drink or die.

425
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:57,681
Rym: They were an international piracy group and they were busted by the feds a couple years ago.

426
00:23:58,183 --> 00:23:59,787
Rym: They were run entirely out of RIT.

427
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:04,038
Scott: Yep RIT is is nerd capital of the world.

428
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:04,579
Rym: Yep.

429
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:07,670
Rym: I mean it has the biggest anime club in America.

430
00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:11,070
Rym: It has the scariest gaming club in the world.

431
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:15,095
Scott: I've seen scarier gaming clubs.

432
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:18,385
Rym: But yeah, it used to have a. it has a gaming convention.

433
00:24:18,485 --> 00:24:37,179
Rym: It has an anime convention edit yep, and If you walk through the dorms at 3 a.m you'll either hear the sounds of people playing a counter-strike or you'll hear the sounds of Lonely nerds Some non lonely nerds like frat boys or whatever.

434
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:53,241
Rym: Yeah, or or uh deaf people having sex Connected to RIT is NT ID the National Technical Institute for the Deaf and it's a good school and they're cool people but Goddamn, they can't hear how much noise they're making.

435
00:24:53,943 --> 00:25:05,110
Scott: and some of them, you know because RIT is a is a cross-section of nerd them, which is typically more intelligent and NT ID is a cross-section of society.

436
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:11,350
Scott: the average Smartness of NT ID is less smart.

437
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:33,697
Rym: well Actually, alrighty when I worked for RIT I always delivered stuff around and I ended up seeing a study that some professor was doing where Apparently most of the crime committed at RIT I don't know if it was most but was definitely the majority was committed by NT ID students to NT ID students To the point that well even while we went there there were security cameras all over the NT ID side of campus But nowhere else.

438
00:25:33,717 --> 00:25:35,043
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

439
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:38,840
Scott: You know what it was is They were the only ones who could think that.

440
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:40,007
Scott: you know, they wouldn't hear him coming.

441
00:25:40,696 --> 00:25:53,650
Rym: I Sneak in grab a laptop run away, you know One of the big problems are right here actually because it's mostly geeks were real smart At least smart in terms of figuring out how to pull something off.

442
00:25:55,292 --> 00:26:06,394
Rym: Alright, he had a lot of projectors real expensive projectors like 10 $20,000 project in every classroom and they were stolen at a rate that you would not believe Scary rate.

443
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:07,640
Scott: and then they replaced them all.

444
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,890
Rym: but they still they get stolen constantly.

445
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:16,170
Scott: So eventually, well, I think there was one guy with like an epidemic of stealing, but I think they eventually I don't know if they Caught him, but I think it eventually stopped.

446
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:17,313
Rym: Yeah I mean cuz.

447
00:26:17,354 --> 00:26:24,190
Rym: first of all they had a mounted to the ceiling and they had like a cable that connected to it and if The cable got cut or disconnected it called security immediately.

448
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,256
Rym: So what are the nerds do?

449
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:29,610
Rym: they left the cable intact and cut all the stuff holding it up?

450
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:30,993
Rym: They cut everything except the cable.

451
00:26:31,393 --> 00:26:33,257
Rym: then when they were ready to bolt they cut the cable and ran.

452
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:35,081
Rym: works worked real.

453
00:26:35,101 --> 00:26:44,470
Rym: Well, I Just have many of them since we left the school locked down and locked down a little bit.

454
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,909
Rym: Well, the dorms are locked all the time now and you can't get in without a key.

455
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:54,010
Rym: Yeah, but someone lets you in and stuff, you know, yeah, but remember when we were there the doors just open all the time.

456
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,599
Scott: yeah, there was a school in Europe actually did something.

457
00:26:56,639 --> 00:27:12,686
Scott: cool is if you wanted to get into the dorm - with Your boyfriend or girlfriend from outside the school at night, then you'd have to pay like so many pounds British pounds Which is - it's basically like, you know, this isn't your house.

458
00:27:12,746 --> 00:27:16,630
Scott: if you want to stay here You got to pay because you know the students who were there got to pay.

459
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,244
Scott: So if anyone wants to spend the night, they may know that's crap.

460
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,310
Rym: Cuz say I have an apartment.

461
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,588
Rym: My landlord it was only the dorms.

462
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,142
Rym: Alright dorms like an apartment say I have an apartment.

463
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:27,770
Rym: My landlord can't charge me extra five bucks.

464
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,230
Rym: Cuz I had my girlfriend stay over one.

465
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,900
Scott: Yeah, the thing is is that you're not technically renting the.

466
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,908
Scott: the dorm is that they're letting you stay there.

467
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:34,530
Scott: It's like a hotel.

468
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,839
Scott: Yeah, it's like a hotel.

469
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Scott: if they find out you have an extra person You know what?

470
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,509
Rym: That's still crap.

471
00:27:39,252 --> 00:27:47,068
Scott: But anyway, the point is is that people paid this happily and they even like guys are showing off their receipts to be like Hey, I stayed in the dorms of some chick

472
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:48,791
Rym: Wow,

473
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,696
Scott: and the

474
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:51,117
Rym: school made

475
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:54,366
Scott: a lot of money off of it to do cool stuff like renovate the dorms.

476
00:27:54,868 --> 00:28:03,590
Rym: Yeah But I mean the college lifestyle, oh, yeah, let's see we would get up late and skip whatever morning classes we had.

477
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,490
Rym: We'd go to class and either sleep or not pay attention or do work for other classes.

478
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:13,242
Rym: Yeah And then we do crazy stuff all night until real late.

479
00:28:13,262 --> 00:28:18,208
Rym: then we'd all go out like a diner and eat and then we'd stay Up later and then we'd eventually fall asleep and wake up and repeat the next day.

480
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:23,570
Rym: Yeah We would go to our anime club hundreds of people milling around yelling at each other.

481
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:27,905
Rym: Yeah, we'd go to our board game club play board games and yell at scary people.

482
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:29,190
Scott: I think that's about it.

483
00:28:29,692 --> 00:28:31,882
Scott: Got a hockey RIT hockey.

484
00:28:32,364 --> 00:28:35,940
Rym: see it's such a geeky school But it had a really good hockey team.

485
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:36,422
Rym: it had.

486
00:28:36,462 --> 00:28:41,343
Rym: well relative to the hockey teams They play it had a top-tier division 2 hockey 3.

487
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:42,326
Rym: No, it was division 2.

488
00:28:42,326 --> 00:28:43,190
Scott: vision 2 doesn't exist.

489
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:44,108
Rym: That's the point.

490
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:56,191
Rym: It was a top-tier division 2 hockey team back in the day because he didn't let me finish here and then they got rid of division 2 in hockey and Instead of putting RIT in division 1 where they should have been they put him in division 3.

491
00:28:56,191 --> 00:29:02,730
Scott: They're in division 1 now, but they're only doing their win-lose win-lose win-lose, you know, that was their first year in division 1.

492
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,448
Rym: That's a big leap when you're in division 3 for a long time.

493
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,162
Rym: But in division 3 they were just unstoppable.

494
00:29:10,704 --> 00:29:18,637
Rym: they won a game our freshman year Against the worst team ever 24 to 0 in hockey.

495
00:29:18,837 --> 00:29:21,364
Scott: Hey once playing ice hockey on the NES against my cousin.

496
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:23,832
Scott: I won 125 to like 0.

497
00:29:23,832 --> 00:29:25,502
Rym: I can't imagine how that's even possible.

498
00:29:25,582 --> 00:29:25,924
Scott: I did it.

499
00:29:25,944 --> 00:29:27,953
Scott: I Remember it very clearly.

500
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:32,830
Rym: no because I can't imagine anyone you were playing with putting up with that and continuing to play.

501
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:34,382
Scott: Oh, you know, you also.

502
00:29:34,403 --> 00:29:37,884
Scott: there were a lot of games He kicked my ass at like the stupid championship bowling game like that.

503
00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:38,929
Scott: I couldn't beat him at all.

504
00:29:39,632 --> 00:29:43,150
Scott: You get like a 300 I get like 60, but I missed that.

505
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:48,270
Rym: I mean in college I pay a dollar and I could see an awesome hockey game and then hang out all night.

506
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:50,698
Scott: It was three dollars, I think that was two bucks.

507
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,303
Scott: I think it raised the price.

508
00:29:52,363 --> 00:29:53,707
Rym: They raised the prize our senior year.

509
00:29:54,008 --> 00:30:02,524
Rym: Yeah Now nothing if I want to see a Rangers game I can pay like 70 bucks Yeah, and I got a drive down there.

510
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:09,528
Scott: man I went from do whatever I want whenever I want with literal no responsibility, but I complained about having homework.

511
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,459
Scott: now I got no homework But it's wake up go to work.

512
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,974
Scott: Come home do stuff eat Yeah, go to bed.

513
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:20,208
Rym: we can only really do stuff on the weekends when you're in college.

514
00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:22,982
Rym: the weekends We're just like extra bonus time and we just have all the time.

515
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:28,116
Scott: Yep, man I used to make fun of people for wake up go to work Come home watch TV go to bed.

516
00:30:28,397 --> 00:30:32,600
Scott: now of all those things except I replaced watch TV with some other stuff Yeah like this like this.

517
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:38,981
Rym: I mean The biggest problem is that we had all our friends together.

518
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:41,370
Rym: we had a huge posse we had our front row crew.

519
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,030
Scott: Well, we made the posse there.

520
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,503
Rym: Yeah And we had a posse there because we made it there and we were real close.

521
00:30:46,965 --> 00:30:48,210
Scott: and now we got a fine.

522
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,751
Scott: You got to make a new posse here But there's.

523
00:30:49,771 --> 00:31:03,934
Rym: no it's not easy because you don't have a giant pile of nerds to to run through the sieve But it's cool because we moved out here and bit by bit as all our friends from college graduate or get jobs Or whatever.

524
00:31:04,316 --> 00:31:05,141
Rym: They're moving out here.

525
00:31:05,162 --> 00:31:08,170
Rym: Yeah, kinda Yeah, we got a good bit.

526
00:31:08,971 --> 00:31:10,237
Rym: We're better off than staying there.

527
00:31:10,257 --> 00:31:34,010
Rym: Definitely better off than staying because there was a time when I thought You know living here at RIT is great I could just live in this town forever and have the same awesome forever and then I realized that no because everyone else will leave and I won't get a good job because the market there is glutted with kids who all want to do the same thing and It's kind of a crappy area outside of the college.

528
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,816
Rym: The only thing that made RIT great was the people.

529
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:38,124
Scott: Giant pile of nerds in one basket.

530
00:31:38,545 --> 00:31:39,990
Scott: We don't live near a game store anymore.

531
00:31:40,392 --> 00:31:44,370
Rym: Yeah, I mean the best game store I've ever been in in my life is still Millennium in Rochester.

532
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:46,304
Scott: I think it's the biggest game store.

533
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:47,170
Rym: It's one of the biggest.

534
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,768
Rym: I don't know if it's the biggest but it's up there.

535
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:55,329
Scott: But it's like even though you know, alright, so now we can buy all the board games We didn't have before but now we have no people to play them with.

536
00:31:55,772 --> 00:32:01,054
Rym: But I mean it's not like we have no people because we have a lot of friends who live near enough where they can hang Out for a weekend.

537
00:32:01,435 --> 00:32:05,290
Rym: We've had at least one big party where everyone came and we had a job.

538
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,863
Scott: We're gonna have a bigger party where everyone comes in New Year's.

539
00:32:08,144 --> 00:32:11,079
Rym: Oh God on New Year's I think we're gonna have more people than our house can hold.

540
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:18,225
Scott: we should get even like the such Extraneous people like like my family and your family and make it crazy.

541
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:19,570
Rym: I've been invited pretty much.

542
00:32:20,114 --> 00:32:27,450
Rym: I have told everyone I think is cool and I haven't gotten to everyone yet because it's still a ways off and I'm pretty much trying to contact everyone.

543
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:32,408
Scott: I know and I'm being like like even really like like can even like.

544
00:32:32,448 --> 00:32:34,417
Rym: yeah Everyone.

545
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:41,643
Scott: we should get every Warm and even some cold bodies and I wonder if Dwayne's still alive.

546
00:32:41,883 --> 00:32:43,367
Scott: No, we don't want to ain't God.

547
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:48,674
Rym: Dwayne was when we first got to RIT and we all like.

548
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:49,056
Rym: the first.

549
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:54,530
Rym: the way we all met was because we went to this gaming club and We're all standing there were all a little freshman.

550
00:32:55,651 --> 00:32:59,010
Rym: And then we hear a guy yell in the distance, I'm running a third edition.

551
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,705
Rym: He wasn't in the distance like in the other side of the room.

552
00:33:01,765 --> 00:33:03,957
Scott: No, he was well Maybe you were on the other side of the room.

553
00:33:03,977 --> 00:33:06,370
Rym: Yeah, I wasn't cuz I saw me stood up on a table.

554
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,379
Rym: He's like I run in a third at D&D game.

555
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:10,910
Rym: I ran over there and I met a bunch of geeks.

556
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:19,158
Scott: I know I walked in expecting to play some battle take on the battle tank and Katsu was there with his crazy umbrella and I talked to him.

557
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:22,415
Scott: cuz he was like in the battle tech even though It was.

558
00:33:22,576 --> 00:33:28,744
Scott: he didn't play it for so many years Even though we had already played it out in all those times in.

559
00:33:28,805 --> 00:33:33,244
Scott: Peterson 3 had never played Battle tank until like two years later.

560
00:33:33,264 --> 00:33:38,080
Scott: Yeah, Katsu was awesome But he's not good at battle Even though I saw I met him before anyone else.

561
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:43,441
Scott: and then do I was right there with all the group of people and this Guy was like, yeah, there's like third ed D&D.

562
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:45,330
Rym: So we all make our characters.

563
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:47,743
Scott: I never I had last D&D I saw was second.

564
00:33:47,784 --> 00:33:48,447
Scott: It was like third ed.

565
00:33:48,488 --> 00:33:52,690
Rym: Holy crap I had just bought third ed and I had just converted a character to third ed.

566
00:33:52,891 --> 00:33:53,935
Rym: So I barely knew it.

567
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,690
Rym: and it was awesome because this guy seemed really cool and it was a huge group.

568
00:33:57,751 --> 00:33:59,090
Rym: So we split it up into like two groups.

569
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:04,187
Rym: There's gonna be a DM and a co DM this crazy D&D game and the first session was awesome.

570
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:05,130
Scott: It's pretty good.

571
00:34:05,351 --> 00:34:18,348
Rym: So we uh go the next week to play again and we learned that Dwayne apparently Has all like this amount of awesome in his body and he spent it all that night and all that was left was this pot smoking.

572
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:22,960
Rym: Doofus husk just a husk of a man with like pot smoke floating.

573
00:34:23,081 --> 00:34:25,670
Scott: other DM guy was actually cool, but he disappeared.

574
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:27,179
Rym: Yeah, he like literally disappeared.

575
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,063
Rym: I never heard from him again.

576
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:32,554
Rym: Yep Yeah D&D we used to play.

577
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,826
Scott: people say, you know, oh we should make marijuana legal.

578
00:34:36,187 --> 00:34:37,612
Scott: It doesn't hurt you It doesn't?

579
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:38,255
Scott: you know?

580
00:34:38,315 --> 00:34:39,802
Scott: chemically you don't get addicted.

581
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:42,187
Scott: Yeah, but it turns you into a Stupid.

582
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:49,243
Rym: Dwayne would have probably been addicted to like Tylenol.

583
00:34:49,263 --> 00:35:03,263
Scott: I don't think there was any stop in his proliferary proliferary His proclivity toward addiction But he could have been addicted to something that wouldn't turn you into a doofus.

584
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:15,135
Scott: I could play World of Warcraft You know while World of Warcraft it eats up all your time and some of your money It doesn't turn you into a doofus Doofus.

585
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:21,876
Rym: Yo, I Miss D&D though.

586
00:35:21,896 --> 00:35:28,502
Scott: We used to play Dungeons & Dragons for hours And now I guess you could think people do play two-person D&D.

587
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:30,086
Rym: I'll be the DM.

588
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:31,430
Rym: All right, let's play right now.

589
00:35:31,771 --> 00:35:34,159
Rym: All right, you're you're like a human fighter.

590
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:35,504
Scott: No, I don't wanna be a fighter.

591
00:35:35,544 --> 00:35:36,206
Scott: I'll be wizard.

592
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:38,473
Rym: find your wizard sweet You're level five.

00:35:39,035 --> 00:35:40,861
Scott: Oh, sweet fireball fireball.

594
00:35:40,901 --> 00:35:43,550
Rym: So you're standing at the entrance to a dungeon.

595
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:51,043
Scott: Alright, there's a sign that says dungeon I don't go in the dungeon cuz I have no reason to go in there and it's scary and dangerous.

596
00:35:51,203 --> 00:35:56,040
Rym: All right, I turn around a New blocks your way.

597
00:35:56,061 --> 00:35:58,920

Scott: Yes Is it a normal canoe or is it?

600
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:04,902
Scott: somehow I detect magic on it.

601
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:06,347
Rym: It is magical.

602
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:08,013
Scott: it is Magic.

603
00:36:08,053 --> 00:36:11,350
Rym: text is written on the side that says the dungeon master wants you to go into the cave.

604
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:15,202
Scott: Oh, well, I must defy the dungeon master with all my power.

605
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:16,909
Rym: You know what a dragon eats you?

606
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,092
Scott: Where did the dragon come from?

607
00:36:19,112 --> 00:36:24,280
Scott: I would.

608
00:36:26,062 --> 00:36:27,377
Scott: That's why you don't play two-person D&D.

609
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:38,264
Rym: We're trying to play a forum game of D&D and it's fun, but it's kind of dragon mostly because we all have dragon dragons Dungeons & Dragons dragon.

610
00:36:38,785 --> 00:36:39,929
Rym: Yeah after this podcast.

611
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:41,553
Rym: I'm gonna go drain the dragon.

612
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:42,576
Scott: drain the dragon.

613
00:36:42,797 --> 00:36:43,779
Rym: Yeah dragon is a little full.

614
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:49,900
Rym: What was the thing in order of the stick the the trouser Titan the trouser Titan coxmanship?

615
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,702
Rym: I have a plus five to coxmanship.

616
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,472
Scott: I wish there was someone to play D&D with besides Me.

617
00:37:00,492 --> 00:37:04,049
Rym: Yeah, I mean we're playing the online game, but it's kind of slow.

618
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:11,712
Scott: But if everyone moves out here, I'll totally run a game And everyone who'll run a game we'll have a game every night of the week of the crazy Yeah cops.

619
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:15,710
Rym: who wants to run a game or find Alex our DM wants to run a game?

620
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:21,808
Scott: Yeah Let's run games Let's play a lot.

621
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:22,754
Scott: What do you want?

622
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:26,130
Scott: all we want to do is play lots of games and just crap gets in our way.

623
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,750
Scott: So then we obsess about getting rid of the crap and we totally lose sight.

624
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,996
Scott: All we want to do is sit around and play games the rest of our lives One of the happiest summers of my life.

625
00:37:34,658 --> 00:37:50,835
Rym: we stayed in RIT over the summer and we paid like half rent because that's how it worked back then and You took like one class and I worked at a sub shop and our friend Alex worked at a sub shop And we just played German board games specifically Puerto Rico Every day

626
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:51,697
Scott: man.

627
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:53,965
Scott: I realize if there's no bullshit in this entire world.

628
00:37:54,125 --> 00:38:01,161
Scott: All we would do is eat and Play games all day Bike a lot and stuff.

629
00:38:01,704 --> 00:38:02,850
Scott: It would be part of a game.

630
00:38:07,594 --> 00:38:18,047
Rym: Most of our time would be spent Yeah Playing games and eating in college The only time we stopped playing games if we had bigger things to do or we were too tired to continue playing physically.

631
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:23,010
Scott: Yeah But even then there are some games that don't take so much like apples to apples.

632
00:38:23,392 --> 00:38:25,464
Rym: Yeah, apples to apples is a great game.

633
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,550
Scott: Definitely great game.

634
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,616
Scott: They actually sell that in stores.

635
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:28,943
Scott: Now Carcassone is actually in.

636
00:38:28,984 --> 00:38:30,130
Scott: Toys R Us is some place.

637
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,314
Rym: Nanofictionary was always fun.

638
00:38:33,317 --> 00:38:34,100
Scott: We haven't played that in a while.

639
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,405
Scott: I think I don't know the instruction book.

640
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:35,967
Scott: is it to find it?

641
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:38,507
Scott: Yeah Such a drum line anyway.

642
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:51,789
Rym: See there's no real moral here because we're still kind of in the transition to the real world which the real world generally sucks, but Don't think that you can stay in college because it won't work.

643
00:38:52,412 --> 00:38:56,170
Rym: But don't give up on trying to live the college lifestyle and become a nine-to-five schlub.

644
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:01,430
Rym: Definitely you got to live the college lifestyle somehow outside of college.

645
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:05,144
Rym: But that can't happen if you stay in college because every generate like.

646
00:39:05,204 --> 00:39:05,646
Rym: think about it.

647
00:39:05,867 --> 00:39:09,265
Rym: You're at RIT Then you graduate but you stay at RIT.

648
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:09,969
Rym: All right.

649
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:13,530
Rym: So now you've got some low-paying job because it's Rochester, but your rent's low.

650
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,040
Rym: So it's okay and you know people are in school.

651
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,003
Rym: So you still hang out there.

652
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,610
Rym: then another year goes by.

653
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:23,970
Rym: Now, you know people who know people in school and you only kind of know people in the school.

654
00:39:24,353 --> 00:39:26,109
Rym: So when you hang out people are always like who's that?

655
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:36,189
Rym: Then the next year now you kind of know people who kind of know people who go to the school and you're just that old Creepy guy who's hanging around in the corner trying to get people to play apples to apples with him.

656
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,274
Scott: Don't be that guy.

657
00:39:38,696 --> 00:39:40,905
Scott: Yeah, there are a lot of guys you don't want to be.

658
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:42,737
Scott: that's one of the guys You don't want to be.

659
00:39:42,878 --> 00:39:48,975
Scott: but by that logic What you should do is you should stay at the school for like an extra year and then leave Yeah, which I kind of did.

660
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:50,602
Rym: I could have left a year early and I stayed.

661
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:53,133
Rym: yeah came back after that co-op Left.

662
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:57,490
Scott: see now it would be extra school as if they were like nerdy towns.

663
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:03,970
Scott: Yeah, it's like my house would be part of like a nerd condo and everyone in the whole condo is like a friendly nerd.

664
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:10,470
Scott: So it's like I live in an awesome college dorm with college awesome nerd action, but I go to work somewhere.

665
00:40:10,731 --> 00:40:16,330
Scott: Yep, even better if all the nerds living in that condo were the work and then it was just awesome.

666
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:25,950
Rym: Now, I think the biggest thing is if you have enough money You can continue to live the college life no matter where you live Because then you don't have to work as much.

667
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:30,950
Rym: Yeah Or you have enough money to get all your friends together or to travel to go to Otakon is the wrong.

668
00:40:31,071 --> 00:40:39,249
Scott: Imagine if one of us had like a 20 like a super Time-consuming CEO job of millions of dollars and the rest of us were just supported by that guy.

669
00:40:40,432 --> 00:40:43,529
Scott: One guy basically gets the stick and all these other people go.

670
00:40:44,671 --> 00:40:47,970
Rym: Yeah, but then he quits and you still have enough money to live out your day.

671
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:53,693
Scott: Well, you just had you'd have to quit when he got enough money to live off the interest or form some sort of Skinner Colony.

672
00:40:54,356 --> 00:41:04,790
Rym: Yeah, those don't work so well, but we've realized Cuz if you just stay in your college town It's probably a dead end in the long run because everyone's gonna leave to get you know.

673
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,150
Scott: Real jobs unless you get everyone to stay but then you all suffer together.

674
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:16,800
Rym: Yeah, because no matter what people tell you unless you live in a military town or a factory town Many factory towns that have colleges anymore.

675
00:41:17,564 --> 00:41:28,516
Rym: You're not gonna get a good job unless you do something crazy like start your own business because Everyone has the same idea you do and they can always hire some fresh punk kid out of college for a lot less money than They'll pay you.

676
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:34,210
Scott: I remember when I was in college I had to find a co-op and it was so hard because I had to put limits like where it was.

677
00:41:34,571 --> 00:41:36,920
Scott: Yeah, I found co-ops like in California like ding.

678
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,643
Scott: I could have just gotten them.

679
00:41:38,486 --> 00:41:39,410
Scott: It would pay needed jobs.

680
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:44,310
Rym: I looked like I need a job and there were jobs everywhere just not in any college.

681
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:48,350
Scott: But if I limited myself by where I would have gotten a job much later.

682
00:41:48,451 --> 00:41:52,532
Scott: I got a job two weeks after grad after I was Back home.

683
00:41:52,673 --> 00:41:53,395
Scott: Yeah two weeks.

684
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:58,130
Rym: I've technically been employed from while I was still in school until now.

685
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:00,216
Scott: Yeah, I mean I went home.

686
00:42:00,236 --> 00:42:07,123
Scott: I did a little relaxing at home, you know built a robot did some internetting Put my resume about and even put that much effort into it.

687
00:42:07,184 --> 00:42:08,490
Scott: Not as much as I had done previously.

688
00:42:09,037 --> 00:42:17,837
Scott: Put the resume on Craigslist You know, I got one email that was just kind of like I wasn't even really because it was a job involving something that I Wasn't 100% about.

689
00:42:17,857 --> 00:42:19,929
Scott: but then you know, I replied cuz someone emailed me.

690
00:42:20,851 --> 00:42:21,554
Scott: Now I have a job.

691
00:42:22,177 --> 00:42:30,390
Rym: I still have the job and at first I thought not so bad Oh this sucks cuz I moved away and I was working for IBM and I was living out in the Mid Hudson Valley all alone.

692
00:42:31,954 --> 00:42:40,370
Rym: But then after the initial, you know leaving and establishing myself somewhere once one person is established somewhere It's easy for other people to go to the same type of area.

693
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:53,829
Rym: Hmm, so then one of my friends moved in nearby and then one of my friends moved in with me and then two more of my friends are thinking of moving into the area and I got a friend who has like he stays nearby like kind of far away but much closer than the old college town.

694
00:42:54,672 --> 00:43:00,570
Scott: One of these days will come with an idea and someone will give us money to do something Yep, and then we can quit and do that.

695
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:09,210
Rym: but the best way to keep live in college is to flee college and Get the money and find a place to establish yourself and then reconvene.

696
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,042
Scott: Yeah, sometimes hard to reconvene though, depending on what your situation is.

697
00:43:14,223 --> 00:43:15,186
Rym: Yeah, we got real lucky.

698
00:43:15,227 --> 00:43:24,270
Rym: We found a great house We both got jobs easily and of course We're looking to New York City area where there's a million million million tech jobs million million jobs in New York City.

699
00:43:24,371 --> 00:43:25,759
Scott: Just sucks to live in New York City.

700
00:43:26,102 --> 00:43:27,450
Rym: Yeah, not so bad to live in the suburbs.

701
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:30,270
Scott: I mean we're paying my cousin just who works in the city.

702
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:36,113
Scott: she just got an apartment in the city with another person and Basically, they've got.

703
00:43:36,234 --> 00:43:43,716
Scott: it's so small to one bedroom one person's in the bedroom and they put like a wall like in the living room To split it in half.

704
00:43:43,857 --> 00:43:46,849
Scott: It's so small and they pay a lot as much as we do for this whole house.

705
00:43:47,552 --> 00:43:50,850
Scott: Yep, but she doesn't lose two hours a day to train.

706
00:43:51,372 --> 00:43:54,060
Rym: Yeah, but eventually you could telecommute or we could start our own company.

707
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:56,850
Scott: or definitely I'm not keeping this job.

708
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:00,751
Scott: You know, well the job itself is good It's.

709
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:03,401
Scott: it's really just you know, the time it takes to do the job.

710
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:04,385
Scott: that kills me.

711
00:44:04,405 --> 00:44:06,473
Scott: I You know, I would.

712
00:44:06,494 --> 00:44:09,224
Scott: I'm probably not gonna keep it before I'm 30.

713
00:44:09,224 --> 00:44:10,187
Scott: I won't be working there.

714
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:16,070
Rym: Oh, definitely I won't be at IBM when I'm 30 I could tell you 100% guarantee Unless they make me some sort of crazy manager.

715
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:19,986
Scott: Even if I become one of those guys who tries a business it fails tries business it fails.

716
00:44:20,287 --> 00:44:28,656
Rym: I won't Yeah, because a lot of people they have great aspirations, but then they aren't willing to take the risk Mmm-hmm.

717
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:30,430
Rym: We are definitely willing to risk.

718
00:44:32,192 --> 00:44:37,302
Rym: We're definitely willing to risk our middle-class Lifestyle for the possibility of leading an awesome life.

719
00:44:37,964 --> 00:44:39,470
Scott: There's no other way to lead the awesome life.

720
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,680
Rym: We have to yeah, unless we get more else.

721
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,005
Scott: We're basically saying we give up.

722
00:44:43,045 --> 00:44:44,050
Scott: We don't want an awesome life.

723
00:44:44,343 --> 00:44:50,536
Rym: Yeah The moment we give up we cease to have the college in us and all that's left is the nine-to-five husky Like all your co-workers.

724
00:44:50,898 --> 00:45:02,121
Rym: Yeah, like most of my co-workers like pretty much everyone I've met in the tech industry who has worked in the tech industry for more than a few years hmm sucks Yeah, we're not gonna be that way.

725
00:45:02,222 --> 00:45:09,530
Rym: if we ever get that way We'd probably just say fuck it and quit and like do some credit card scam and then run off and do something crazy like Mexico.

726
00:45:10,431 --> 00:45:12,180
Scott: I don't want to do something like that.

727
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,050
Rym: I forgot to that point.

728
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:21,056
Rym: I'd rather do that than continue to live nine to five until I am old enough to retire And just don't want to do anything.

729
00:45:21,076 --> 00:45:22,119
Scott: we're at the run to Mexico.

730
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:29,630
Rym: we could run somewhere nice like France it's not with their Riots, yeah All right Yeah.

731
00:45:30,551 --> 00:45:32,536
Scott: So do we have a daily thing?

732
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:33,519
Rym: Not really.

733
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:37,570
Rym: This was just kind of a pseudo angsty rant about how we miss college.

734
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:38,694
Scott: It's not so angsty.

735
00:45:38,855 --> 00:45:39,317
Rym: Not really.

736
00:45:39,497 --> 00:45:39,999
Rym: Thanks.

737
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:44,853
Scott: You'd be like, so my college days are Forgone.

738
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:48,405
Rym: oh for now, I am against the LARP and I cannot LARP anymore.

739
00:45:48,425 --> 00:45:52,302
Scott: Oh But secretly inside have a strong desire to learn.

740
00:45:53,328 --> 00:45:55,157
Scott: Oh But I will not.

741
00:45:55,277 --> 00:46:00,896
Rym: that will not say if you get one thing out of this Live-action role-playing LARPing.

742
00:46:01,237 --> 00:46:02,119
Scott: It's a cool thing.

743
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:05,810
Rym: It's not however, it is not cool in Rochester, New York.

744
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:07,135
Scott: It's not cool.

745
00:46:07,396 --> 00:46:08,058
Rym: It's cool.

746
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:11,270
Scott: I saw a thing on TV people doing in, Texas.

747
00:46:11,654 --> 00:46:13,370

749
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:33,350
Rym: well, I guess the moral is be leery of people who LARP and Stay in college as long as you can but when it's time to leave college fucking leave Yeah, and go to college because if you don't you'll just be a dumb waste.

Rym: Yeah.

752
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:40,250
