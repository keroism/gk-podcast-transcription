1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,928
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 26th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:10,109
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:13,957
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,385
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:20,640
Rym: Tonight, we are reviewing Spider-Man 2099.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,638
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,700
Rym: So, uh, I have not been called up for jury duty in like a decade.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,184
Scott: We just talked about it.

9
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:36,371
Scott: You can figure out our whole jury duty history by listening to enough GeekNights, 'cause every time we have a jury duty, we do an episode on it.

10
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:38,739
Scott: It's the opening bit guaranteed, no matter what.

11
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:55,920
Rym: We'll probably remind you that if you're on a jury, you have a natural de facto right to nullify, in that even if someone is clearly guilty, and you're instructed just to decide if they are guilty, you can still vote not guilty if you believe the law itself is unjust, or you think the punishment is unjust.

12
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:57,649
Scott: Or you just fucking feel like it.

13
00:00:57,669 --> 00:00:58,212
Scott: It's like...

14
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,346
Rym: It's not illegal.

15
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,252
Rym: They can't stop you.

16
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:02,420
Rym: They can't know your hearts.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,700
Scott: They can give you all the instructions they want, but at the end of the day, it's like the reason you're there is 'cause you have the power to choose guilty or not guilty.

18
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,840
Rym: Jury of your peers.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,952
Scott: No one can make you choose in the United States, either one.

20
00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:17,340
Scott: It's up to you what you choose entirely.

21
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:22,000
Scott: And if you just have some other reason, you know, you can Google jury nullification on your own.

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,481
Scott: Yep.

23
00:01:23,046 --> 00:01:24,780
Rym: I suggest you do if you get called up for jury duty.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,957
Rym: But I gotta go back in tomorrow, and I am 100% sure they will never, ever in my life.

25
00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:32,140
Rym: let me sit on a jury.

26
00:01:32,523 --> 00:01:34,680
Scott: Even though I really would like to be on a jury.

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:42,899
Scott: What two lawyers opposing each other would both look at... It could be that one of them is looking at Rym and saying, "Oh yeah, he's gonna say what I want him to

28
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:43,100
Scott: say.".

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,255
Rym: And the other one's gonna be like, "He just said he hates the

30
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:45,638
Rym: cops.".

31
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:47,215
Scott: The other one would be like, "Fuck

32
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:47,478
Scott: no.".

33
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:56,334
Scott: There is no way that two opposing lawyers would both take Rym in, question him, hear his answers, and both say, "Fuck yeah, going on my jury.

34
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:56,897
Scott: I like this

35
00:01:56,938 --> 00:01:57,240
Scott: guy.".

36
00:01:57,501 --> 00:02:02,320
Rym: The last time I went through Vardear, like, it was almost a scene from a comedy movie.

37
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,360
Rym: They asked me a question, I gave a short, honest answer, and I thought they were gonna, like, follow up or grill me because the answer was an atypical one.

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,600
Rym: Like, it was the one they wouldn't expect.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,338
Rym: But instead, literally, both lawyers kind of look at each other and they raise their hands, and I was just dismissed with no more words, and that was it.

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:25,199
Rym: The question was, "Would you trust the testimony of a law enforcement officer over the testimony of a private

41
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:25,540
Rym: citizen?".

42
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:27,557
Rym: And I said, "Absolutely

43
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:27,819
Rym: not.".

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,173
Rym: Kind of waiting for them to, like, ask me why, and they were just like, "Nope.

45
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:34,197
Rym: Get out of here.

46
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:34,679
Rym: You're done.

47
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:34,919
Rym: Go

48
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,060
Rym: home.".

49
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,178
Scott: And it's like, "I will trust the testimony of any human equal to any other

50
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:40,519
Scott: human.".

51
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,740
Rym: I would actually trust the testimony of a cop less than a private citizen.

52
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,671
Scott: Could be, depends, you know, but equal at most, right?

53
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,640
Rym: But also, I don't trust eyewitness testimony at all because I know that it's mostly bullshit.

54
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,199
Scott: Of course not.

55
00:02:53,562 --> 00:02:55,372
Rym: I'm going to judge based on evidence.

56
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,360
Scott: I'm judging going to be based on the physical evidence more than is going to outweigh what anyone says by, like, a thousand.

57
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:07,840
Rym: So, yeah, in the news, we're not going to, like, do a full review here.

58
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,740
Rym: We'll talk about spoilers and go in-depth on this.

59
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,360
Rym: At some, like, when the last Adventure Time special comes out, we'll probably do a show.

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,512
Scott: Yeah, we did episodes on the first two.

61
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:17,840
Scott: They're only making four.

62
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:23,460
Scott: I really didn't feel like making four GeekNights episodes for four Adventure Time episodes.

63
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,915
Rym: Because we only do 26 animation episodes a year on average now.

64
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,012
Scott: Yeah, so...

65
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,600
Rym: So four twenty-sixths of GeekNights becomes Adventure Time?

66
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,498
Rym: We already turned, what, five twenty-sixths of GeekNights into train game reviews?

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:46,060
Scott: If they do, if after the next one, the Peppermint Butler one, they're not doing any more, we'll do an episode.

68
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,640
Scott: But if they announce, like, "Hey, we're going to do some more even," then we'll hold off, I guess, even longer.

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,480
Rym: Yeah, but I think it's worth Geek Biting because we did watch Finn and Jake together again, the third installment.

70
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,655
Rym: Uh, Geek Biting, what I would say is it's good.

71
00:03:58,997 --> 00:03:59,460
Rym: It's solid.

72
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:00,539
Scott: It is good.

73
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:06,620
Rym: I think it's the, it's either the weakest of the three new Distant Lands episodes.

74
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,039
Scott: That's not to say, it's not weak.

75
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,518
Rym: It's just like saying, "Oh, I had this great, like, custom donut, and then I had this fancy eclair, and then I had a really good

76
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:16,100
Rym: milkshake.".

77
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,440
Rym: Like, yeah, the milkshake might have been the weakest of those three, but it was still amazing.

78
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:20,978
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

79
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,754
Rym: Uh, the one thing I would say, though, is that it was poignant.

80
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,100
Rym: It hit moderately hard.

81
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:27,418
Rym: I got a little bit choked up.

82
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:33,720
Rym: But it also didn't actually, like, push any particular boundaries.

83
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:38,680
Rym: It didn't really do anything particularly new or different.

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:49,700
Rym: And I would even argue that the major beats and moments and the story it told were already told by the show itself, and this didn't add anything.

85
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,715
Rym: But I still enjoyed watching it.

86
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:54,919
Scott: I agree with that.

87
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,600
Rym: Like, I don't think it's a different opinion of the characters, and even the Jake thing is 100% derivable from having just seen the show.

88
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:09,440
Scott: The other ones, I think, had some sort of higher concept in some sense or another.

89
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,900
Scott: Yeah, the Beemo one the most.

90
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,244
Rym: Because it played with the timeline.

91
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:18,039
Rym: It also played with your expectations about what Beemo's up to.

92
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,738
Rym: That character who is so 100% obviously looks exactly like Finn's dad, and you're like, "I wonder what the deal is with

93
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:24,999
Rym: that?".

94
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:27,039
Rym: Like, there's good stuff there.

95
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,720
Scott: This one was just really straightforward.

96
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:35,379
Scott: Yeah, it was just taking what it was on its face and just sort of tying it up in a way, right?

97
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,809
Scott: And then it's like, "Okay, but you didn't try to go anywhere

98
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:39,411
Scott: new.".

99
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:43,938
Scott: It wasn't as necessary.

100
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:47,873
Scott: Not even just story-wise, but art-wise or anything like that.

101
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:58,520
Rym: The Beemo one did interesting stuff and also explored an unexplored aspect of what is Beemo like when these other people aren't around for real on a real mission.

102
00:05:58,601 --> 00:05:59,560
Rym: Like a real adventure.

103
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:07,660
Rym: Marceline and Bubble Gun, that one just resolved their relationship and a big chunk of the world around them in a really good way.

104
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,360
Rym: And this one just kind of told you something that if you were even remotely perceptive to the show, you already knew.

105
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:19,000
Rym: I guess the part I actually like the most is the whole thing with death.

106
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:26,920
Scott: Yeah, because that's a whole part of the universe that did not get enough screen time in the show.

107
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,800
Rym: In fact, I think most of the screen time that those characters get in the show are in those specials, and you don't actually get much plot, if anything, around them.

108
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:44,500
Scott: Right, it's like that part of the universe where death is is sort of established in some episodes.

109
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:52,500
Scott: There's one episode that really goes in on it, but other than that, there are other parts of the universe to get more attention.

110
00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:01,456
Scott: So, going back there was cool, but going back there in this way was sort of like, "Well, I didn't really learn anything more.

111
00:07:01,516 --> 00:07:03,199
Scott: I learned some more about it, but not that

112
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:03,480
Scott: interesting.".

113
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:12,560
Rym: Well, the most compelling arc was between life, death, and the third unnamed character, those three, because that did the stuff I like about Adventure Time.

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,043
Rym: It didn't explain everything.

115
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:16,409
Rym: It gave you just enough.

116
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:21,080
Rym: You know the gist of these characters, and you just have to infer a lot of what happened.

117
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,047
Rym: You don't know the whole story, and it was sad.

118
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,977
Rym: Life being angry was a very good moment.

119
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:29,300
Rym: That was well animated and fun.

120
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,380
Scott: Yeah, it's good.

121
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,182
Rym: So yeah, it's worth watching.

122
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:33,986
Rym: It's Adventure Time.

123
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:37,775
Rym: It is better than the weakest episode of Adventure Time.

124
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:39,759
Rym: Not that I could even name what that episode might be.

125
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:43,888
Rym: All right, you got any other news?

126
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:45,900
Rym: I guess I got a couple little things we can talk about.

127
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,664
Scott: Yeah, there's not any big news.

128
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:49,408
Scott: I don't know.

129
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,511
Scott: There's that camera news.

130
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:51,754
Scott: Do people care?

131
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:52,054
Scott: I don't know.

132
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,980
Rym: I don't know if Wednesday people care.

133
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,720
Scott: Right, considering we just talked about digital cameras, and then suddenly a news comes that changes some of what we said.

134
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:10,659
Scott: But yeah, the camera that I have that I use for pretty much all our video stuff and also some photo stuff is the Panasonic GH5.

135
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:15,377
Scott: The GH4 was pretty much like the first camera.

136
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:19,080
Rym: The X1, and then I have a fancy Panasonic camcorder.

137
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,820
Scott: Yeah, which was one of the first ones to do 4K video at any kind of reasonable consumer accessible price.

138
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,166
Scott: And the GH5 expanded upon that.

139
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:32,960
Scott: But now, nowadays, everyone else has gotten into that market.

140
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,827
Scott: So it's like, what's Panasonic going to do?

141
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:40,640
Scott: They started this thing, kind of, and everyone else has come and been eating their lunch away.

142
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,225
Scott: You know, Nikon, Canon, Sony, everybody.

143
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:49,920
Scott: So they announced the GH5 II and the GH6 is coming later this year.

144
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:54,360
Scott: They announced it exists, and they gave some specs, but not all the specs, right?

145
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:07,832
Scott: And basically what the deal is, the GH6 is going to record at not 6K or 8K, but 5 point something K. Right, so more than 4K at like 60, right?

146
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:09,837
Scott: It's like ridiculous, and it's going to cost $2,500.

147
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:10,157
Scott: That's a lot.

148
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:18,134
Scott: And it's like, okay, if you are someone who's a filmmaker or something like that, still $2,500 for better than 4K video.

149
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,079
Scott: It's like, you're waiting for that, right?

150
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,660
Rym: Now, it's interesting, on the Panasonic website, they have a big caveat noted about it, saying that because they have an estimate.

151
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:30,538
Scott: Nothing is final.

152
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:39,760
Rym: Yeah, the recording time, but they make a prominent note that the camera's video recording time is limited by its own temperature.

153
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:40,978
Scott: Yep.

154
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:50,200
Rym: That is something we didn't talk about on the show, that the large fancy camcorders, one thing they do have often is active cooling.

155
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:55,878
Rym: So they can record, I could use my camcorder for 12 hours constantly, in hot weather.

156
00:09:55,938 --> 00:09:56,460
Rym: it'll be fine.

157
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:06,200
Scott: Panasonic, they have the BGH, which is one of those box style ones, where it's literally just a box that you put a lens on and everything else is external to that, that you have to attach yourself.

158
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,285
Scott: And that one, I believe, has fans in it, right?

159
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:15,419
Scott: But if you have the carry around, you know, sort of SLR shaped cameras, they usually don't have fans on them.

160
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:18,540
Scott: So the cooling is a factor.

161
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:24,999
Scott: But the GH5 II, they were announcing all the upgrades of the GH5 II versus the GH5.

162
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,080
Scott: And I already have a GH5, so those upgrades got to be something significant to make me want to switch over, right?

163
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:38,000
Scott: And switching over actually wouldn't be, you know, prohibitive because I could sell my GH5 after I get the GH5 II and I'm just paying the difference.

164
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:40,919
Scott: So it's sort of like an upgrade fee, if you think about it that way.

165
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,238
Rym: I would even consider buying it from you just because all I have is an old GX1.

166
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,579
Rym: Oh, okay.

167
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:51,459
Rym: The problem with the X is, it's actually a fine camera for like what I do.

168
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,340
Rym: The problem is, what I would want to use it for is a secondary video camera.

169
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,957
Rym: The X, the GX cannot output HDMI.

170
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,560
Scott: No, it can't do that.

171
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:06,160
Rym: It can record video, but I had to hack the firmware to record more than like 20 minutes of video because of that stupid EU tax law thing.

172
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,372
Scott: So they're announcing all these features for the GH5 II versus the GH5.

173
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:13,160
Scott: And they're nice features, right?

174
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,200
Scott: Better image stabilization, which is already amazing on the GH5, and they're making it better.

175
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,756
Scott: You know, more FPS on the 4K.

176
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:25,760
Scott: You know, you get the vlog included instead of having to buy it.

177
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,940
Rym: Ah, they did warn you the GH5 II also does not do raw video output.

178
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:31,739
Scott: No, almost no one does that.

179
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:33,959
Scott: Only like the ultra pro cameras do that.

180
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,620
Scott: You know, all these really nice features, right?

181
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,200
Scott: They're announcing, but I'm like, you know what?

182
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,219
Scott: Those are all really nice.

183
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:42,217
Scott: You know, if I was buying a brand new camera today, obviously I would get the GH5 II.

184
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,660
Scott: But those are not worth going through the hassle of paying $1,700 for the new one and then selling the old one, right?

185
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,559
Scott: It's like, it's like, cause none of those things really matter for what I do.

186
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:58,700
Scott: And then they come out and the last thing they say is like, by the way, also the camera can just stream on its own directly to YouTube.

187
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,439
Rym: Like we said, all the good new cameras are doing this.

188
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:08,520
Scott: It's like camera, you can just have camera and that, and that, and just if you've got wifi somewhere, or you can even use your phone as a hotspot and use that wifi.

189
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:14,180
Scott: And the camera will go from the camera to YouTube or Twitch or Facebook live.

190
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:14,869
Scott: That's it.

191
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,479
Scott: That's all you need.

192
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,280
Scott: Camera, internet service, no other equipment necessary.

193
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:24,599
Scott: And I'm like, God, that's the one feature to add that to the GH5.

194
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:28,420
Scott: I would have to carry around like a thousand dollar extra piece of equipment.

195
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:31,320
Scott: And they're just gonna include that shit in the camera.

196
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:34,760
Rym: Or a hundred dollar piece of equipment that won't work and might catch fire.

197
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,202
Scott: Exactly.

198
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:39,900
Scott: And I'm like, well, maybe I will buy the new one and then upgrade.

199
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,427
Scott: But I have a lot of other questions.

200
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:43,899
Scott: I'm gonna, I'm gonna get the answers to these other questions.

201
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:50,520
Scott: They actually, so Panasonic did say- My strategy is I put in a pre-order just in case, but I can cancel it.

202
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,422
Scott: I can cancel it.

203
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:57,340
Scott: So when I, if I don't like the answers to my questions that are technical and not necessary to discuss on the show.

204
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:58,826
Scott: I'll cancel my pre-order.

205
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:02,000
Scott: But if the questions have good answers, then I'll be, I'll be good.

206
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:07,060
Rym: So they made a point actually Panasonic about why they don't include raw output in these.

207
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,049
Rym: It's not because they can't.

208
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:09,620
Scott: It's because- It's sort of pointless.

209
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:19,900
Rym: It's pointless because one, their image processing in the camera is better than what anyone who would use this camera professionally would probably do on their own with the raw footage.

210
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,198
Rym: Like it's a lot of work to take raw footage and make it look good.

211
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,135
Rym: Yep.

212
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,360
Rym: Like we do, like I do with raw photos in Lightroom.

213
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:33,160
Scott: It's not really, it's not really saving you anything unless you're ultra, ultra, you know, Hollywood in case you're not using this camera.

214
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:33,800
Rym: Yep.

215
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:46,580
Rym: But also that they encode at a bit rate, basically the way the camera encodes the video it saves and outputs is pretty good, like better than their previous iterations of cameras.

216
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:49,313
Rym: So they basically were pretty open about why they made that decision.

217
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:50,720
Rym: If you want to read more.

218
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,979
Scott: So we'll, we'll see how that goes.

219
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,410
Scott: Yeah.

220
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:53,894
Scott: So that's a, that's a news.

221
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:54,420
Scott: Any other news?

222
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,760
Scott: Yeah.

223
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:08,080
Rym: So in some little news, it's kind of been for since Fujiko Mine came out, we've hit an era where Lupin generally is pretty good when it comes out and that track seems to be continuing.

224
00:14:08,762 --> 00:14:10,159
Rym: Like the 3D CG movie was good.

225
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,080
Scott: Yeah.

226
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:16,640
Scott: There was a period of time where like Lupin, you know, Lupin never truly faded from the world of anime, right?

227
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:25,120
Scott: But, you know, there, the quantity of Lupin product being pushed at any given time has waxed and waned and it waned quite a bit.

228
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,669
Scott: In fact, at the time when our interest was the highest in our, in the college days, right?

229
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:35,140
Scott: There was only, we were mostly watching older ones and newer ones weren't coming out too much.

230
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,209
Scott: So like the later two thousands, they started to come right more.

231
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:41,720
Scott: And now at the anniversary times, they're coming at a steadier clip, right?

232
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:51,260
Scott: So yeah, there's more Lupins coming out lately and they're all seem to be at this relatively very good quality level.

233
00:14:51,581 --> 00:14:57,297
Scott: I don't want to say they're S tier or even A tier, but it's like, I don't see any bad ones.

234
00:14:57,477 --> 00:14:58,420
Scott: I don't see any bad ones.

235
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,708
Rym: So if you want to get back on the Lupin train, one, you could just watch that 3D CG movie.

236
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:04,349
Rym: Like it's fine.

237
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:10,380
Rym: But two, Fujiko Mine is the one that kind of started this new era of Lupin.

238
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,459
Rym: And it is a fantastic show that you should watch.

239
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:23,240
Rym: So, uh, the news is what we're getting specifically is there's going to be a sixth full on Lupin TV anime specifically.

240
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,193
Scott: How many episodes?

241
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:25,240
Scott: 26?

242
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,632
Rym: It doesn't actually say yet.

243
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:27,600
Rym: I'm digging through this.

244
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,619
Scott: Some of those Lupin TV series were longer, right?

245
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,741
Rym: Uh, yeah.

246
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:31,062
Rym: Yeah.

247
00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:33,708
Rym: So part five was the one that was out.

248
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:39,100
Rym: It doesn't tell me yet how many episodes are going to be in part six, but it's for the 50th anniversary.

249
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:40,182
Scott: Yep.

250
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:42,026
Rym: Okay.

251
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:42,387
Rym: Yep.

252
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:48,560
Rym: And the other little news we got, so Funimation has added a few more shows and, uh, they're a little bit notable.

253
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,090
Rym: Uh, God messenger, not that I've watched much messenger.

254
00:15:52,712 --> 00:15:54,960
Rym: God messenger comes later, right?

255
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:02,760
Scott: Yes, it's messenger Z, great messenger, and then I think God messenger is after that.

256
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:10,901
Scott: It's like, uh, you know, so it seems like it seems like the Lupin part five series just came out in 2018.

257
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:16,040
Scott: So it's three years old and that one has like 24 episodes, I think.

258
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,876
Scott: So I imagine that the sixth one will also have a similar 24 episode run just by guessing.

259
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,280
Scott: I have no confirmation on that.

260
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:31,600
Rym: That little Nemo anime they picked up, which I've never actually seen except some clips, but honestly, it looks pretty good.

261
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:34,835
Scott: I've just never, just read the original little Nemo comics.

262
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:35,759
Scott: That's where the action is.

263
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:37,366
Scott: I could watch a couple episodes.

264
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:40,180
Rym: The NES game was pretty good too, though it was really hard.

265
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,340
Scott: Yeah.

266
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:45,540
Scott: I mean, little Nemo is this thing where it's like, uh, for Windsor McKay, right?

267
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:54,020
Scott: Uh, is ridiculously good, but it's in public domain and that's why you keep seeing it coming back and being published in all sorts of places, right?

268
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,304
Scott: Because anyone can do it.

269
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:56,568
Scott: It's public domain.

270
00:16:56,588 --> 00:17:00,240
Scott: So that'll be so awesome when that happens to something more popular than little Nemo.

271
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:08,460
Rym: The NES game was just really fun because it's got all these little animals that you can kind of like crawl into their skin or ride them around and it had a lot going on for an NES game.

272
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,358
Scott: Yeah, it's not a bad NES game at all.

273
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,160
Rym: And, uh, Space Adventure Cobra, the original one, is also going to be on Funimation now.

274
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,769
Scott: I think it's on Crunchyroll already.

275
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:19,400
Scott: I kind of want to watch it.

276
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:21,566
Rym: I have planned to watch it for a long time.

277
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,700
Rym: Way back, way, way back, Gerald at Anime World Order was of all people.

278
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,880
Scott: Gerald is like, Gerald is like Cobra fan number one, right?

279
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,141
Scott: Yep.

280
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:32,171
Rym: But he sold me on it and I just haven't, I've seen some episodes.

281
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,937
Rym: I just never watched like a lot of it.

282
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:34,700
Rym: I never watched the whole thing.

283
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,924
Scott: I think I watched one episode.

284
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:40,980
Scott: I think there was like a newer, newer one, like a remake or a, you know, some, a newer version at some point.

285
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,160
Rym: I watched, I think we might have even reviewed that on Geek Notes.

286
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,520
Scott: And I think I watched one or a few episodes of that.

287
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,240
Rym: Did we talk about that or not?

288
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:51,093
Scott: Check our, search our website.

289
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:51,478
Scott: I don't know.

290
00:17:52,824 --> 00:17:54,800
Scott: If we did, it was so long ago, right?

291
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,067
Rym: That would have been ancient times.

292
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,820
Rym: I don't think we have ever reviewed it on GeekNights.

293
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:02,700
Rym: Well, alright, put that in the hopper.

294
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,240
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

295
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:14,593
Rym: This is not a new artist, but I bumped into this song recently and it's great.

296
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:17,060
Rym: if you've never heard of Brushy One String.

297
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:19,360
Scott: I have not heard of Brushy One String.

298
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:26,900
Rym: He's a cool Jamaican singer and his shtick is that he sings while drumming on and playing a guitar that has one string on it.

299
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,240
Rym: He's just Brushy One String.

300
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:31,060
Rym: And he does the song Chicken in the Corn.

301
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,260
Rym: Apparently it was made famous in a documentary, pseudo-documentary that I've, I guess there's a real documentary.

302
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,160
Rym: I haven't actually seen it, but I've been, it's seen it pop up numerous times in conversation.

303
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:44,559
Rym: And I've made a point that I want to watch it at some point.

304
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,060
Rym: Rise Up, which is about the underground music scene in Jamaica.

305
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:52,199
Rym: And it looks like a really good documentary.

306
00:18:52,722 --> 00:18:57,520
Rym: But apparently this guy was featured in it and his music is popular.

307
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,696
Rym: He only has three albums out.

308
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,540
Rym: But check this guy out, because this song is really good and really catchy.

309
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,539
Rym: It's a really good video.

310
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:05,834
Scott: Okay.

311
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,698
Scott: So, manga genius Naoka Urasawa, right, who made Monster, Pluto, 20th Century Boys, etc.

312
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:20,000
Scott: Apparently had a YouTube channel.

313
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:22,959
Scott: I didn't know that until recently, so I subscribed to it.

314
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,580
Scott: But most of the videos I saw when I went to it weren't subtitled.

315
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,140
Scott: And I was, and you know, were not really useful to watch without subtitles.

316
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,040
Scott: So, I didn't really watch any.

317
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,240
Scott: I saw one show up in my feed, like, today.

318
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:40,058
Scott: And it said it had a big thing on the thumbnail, "ing

319
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:40,400
Scott: sub."

320
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:41,600
Scott: And I'm like, well, click.

321
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,898
Scott: I'm clicking on that.

322
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:47,000
Scott: But most of the video is actually not Urasawa talking.

323
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:50,100
Scott: He talks in the beginning and at the end to sort of introduce what the video is.

324
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:55,320
Scott: But what he is doing in the video is just illustrating one scene, right?

325
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,900
Scott: Just a character from his current manga Asadora, right?

326
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:05,180
Scott: Just standing, like, on a road, right, facing out of the paper, right?

327
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:09,300
Scott: But he draws it using, I guess, like, fountain pen.

328
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,838
Rym: Yeah, that looks like a fountain pen.

329
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:16,900
Scott: And he doesn't, he intentionally, this isn't his normal process, right?

330
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,080
Scott: But he intentionally does not pencil beforehand.

331
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:21,479
Scott: He's just fountain pen only.

332
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:35,799
Scott: And he explains in the video how he's trying to show you, right, how, like, you know, he draws some lines and then how the, you know, the emotion of the scene, like, appears at, like, a certain moment, right, in his process there.

333
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:43,300
Scott: And most of the video is almost entirely uncut footage of just him drawing the whole thing.

334
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:47,600
Scott: Like, every line he draws is on video here, right?

335
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,793
Scott: I don't know if it cuts away from him to go to the bathroom at any point, but it didn't look like it.

336
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,520
Scott: There's not a lot of cuts, right?

337
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,820
Scott: It's just him, his entire drawing from blank paper to completed.

338
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,859
Scott: And it's just, like, this fucking genius guy.

339
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:06,320
Scott: And then at the end, he's, like, you know, he's, like, you do a drawing and there's just so many things you want to improve.

340
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,900
Scott: And I'm, like, what the fuck are you going to improve?

341
00:21:08,181 --> 00:21:11,000
Scott: He's, like, really makes you want to, makes you want to draw better the next day.

342
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:11,978
Scott: And I'm, like, fuck you.

343
00:21:12,464 --> 00:21:14,080
Rym: Or is that me going around just recently?

344
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,220
Scott: I can't even draw, I can't even draw a goddamn stick figure.

345
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,700
Scott: And he's sitting there being that, like, that, you know, artist, the typical artist.

346
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,280
Scott: He's, like, oh, my beautiful drawing that I made with the fountain pen and no pencil beforehand.

347
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:26,880
Scott: Oh, yeah, you know, it's got so many problems.

348
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,619
Scott: I'm, like, oh, my God.

349
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,737
Scott: He starts by drawing, the drawing begins, right?

350
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:36,440
Scott: He's drawing the hand attached to a hat before he draws the head underneath the hat, right?

351
00:21:36,981 --> 00:21:39,559
Scott: So he starts by drawing a hand attached to the brim of a hat.

352
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:42,839
Rym: Because that's the emotional center of the scene.

353
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,019
Scott: And then he draws the head and the neck.

354
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:50,220
Scott: And then somehow the arm, the arm comes around to meet the hand.

355
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:56,080
Scott: And everything is correct in proportion and angle wise and everything.

356
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:58,520
Scott: Even though the hand was there long before the shoulder.

357
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,415
Rym: Yeah, if either of us tried to do that, you know, the image where two railroad tracks meet in the middle and they don't line up?

358
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,299
Scott: It's, like, goddamn this guy.

359
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:15,439
Scott: But yeah, if you want to watch, you know, genius Urasawa draw a still picture, here's like YouTube dot com.

360
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:23,060
Scott: And then, you know, while watching the video, I realized, like, you know, I thought, you know, because I think he had a manga.

361
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,299
Scott: Wasn't there like a shonen bat manga he did?

362
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:30,240
Scott: I don't think that ever came out in English, as far as I'm aware, legally.

363
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,480
Rym: If it did, we just didn't notice.

364
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,359
Scott: I have to search again.

365
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:39,400
Scott: But I knew he was working on this Asadora manga, but it's so recent.

366
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,159
Scott: Like, it's it's not that old.

367
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:51,014
Scott: I didn't think it was in English, but I went and I searched and actually volume one came out like January of this year when I wasn't paying attention because, you know, pandemic going on.

368
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:56,380
Scott: So, yeah, there's two volumes out already and volume three is on the order form.

369
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,959
Scott: This month should be out in July.

370
00:22:58,622 --> 00:23:02,835
Scott: So I went and I grabbed volume three onto my order form and I put one and two in my cart.

371
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:05,199
Scott: So maybe we'll talk about that.

372
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:07,760
Rym: All right.

373
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:14,142
Rym: In the moment, we're slowly, cautiously emerging into the world bit by bit with outdoors stuff.

374
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:17,820
Rym: I was a jury duty today, obviously, but then you went to your office one time.

375
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,059
Rym: I went to my office one time.

376
00:23:19,221 --> 00:23:21,737
Rym: I'll go every now and then, but not going to make a habit out of it.

377
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:25,140
Rym: But yeah, no conventions yet.

378
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,660
Rym: Stay tuned on what we're going to do at PAX East online.

379
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,780
Rym: It seems like it's branded PAX East online to replace PAX East.

380
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:39,020
Scott: Well, yeah, I mean, the online PAX is the way they differentiated them geographically because obviously they're worldwide no matter what was time zones.

381
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,421
Scott: Right.

382
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:42,000
Scott: All of they weren't having events around the clock.

383
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,642
Scott: Right.

384
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:48,100
Scott: So the live streams of things were at times in the local time zone of the pack.

385
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Scott: So the existing the car, the two packs on lines that already happened, the West one and the OS one broadcast their events at West local times and also local time.

386
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,060
Scott: So the PAX East online is going to put out its events at East local time.

387
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:15,820
Scott: So if you're in Australia, it'll be really inconvenient for you because all the if you want to watch live or chat live because it will be happening at the, you know, 24 hours opposite whatever or 12 hours opposite whatever time you get the idea.

388
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,960
Rym: But otherwise, obviously no conventions in person anytime soon.

389
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,065
Rym: So we're kind of just waiting.

390
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:28,140
Rym: Everything's still just hanging out in the hopper, starting to prepare the technology and pipelines for the stuff we want to start doing.

391
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:32,940
Rym: Once the pandemic, once we're more in a post COVID world, there's a lot of stuff we've wanted to do.

392
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,866
Rym: This kind of just on hold.

393
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,859
Rym: So I guess stay tuned for a lot of that biz.

394
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,360
Scott: A camera that live streams itself, if we get that thing and it works.

395
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,140
Scott: Right.

396
00:24:41,462 --> 00:24:45,600
Scott: It's like suddenly we don't have to do the effort of setting up OBS on the computer.

397
00:24:46,022 --> 00:24:48,897
Scott: We don't got to do the effort of editing video.

398
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:49,440
Scott: Right.

399
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:56,080
Scott: We can literally just go somewhere, plug microphones into it somehow, turn it on and just live stream.

400
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,340
Scott: So whether at a convention, just hanging out, playing a board game.

401
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,780
Scott: We can just turn this camera on and push a button and it streams.

402
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:05,580
Scott: You might want to follow us on YouTube, Twitch, wherever.

403
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:14,698
Scott: Because this camera might, you know, if that thing works out, we might just start random unscheduled stream whenever appropriate.

404
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:14,940
Scott: Right.

405
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,216
Scott: So that's ultra low effort for us if it works.

406
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:20,260
Scott: Ultra low effort.

407
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:20,822
Rym: Yeah.

408
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:27,260
Rym: It also makes some of the larger things that are high effort easier because this reduces the amount of effort necessary.

409
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,816
Rym: But there is a lot of other high effort pieces we got to deal with.

410
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,158
Rym: Being vague because I'm not going to shit talk anything, but stay tuned.

411
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,280
Scott: Exactly.

412
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:41,160
Rym: Book Club book, which I'm reading at a slow, I paused reading it to read a bunch of Spider-Man, but I'm going to resume reading.

413
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,880
Scott: I'm in a reading mood, but I'm pretty much in the mood to read anything.

414
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,900
Scott: So yeah, I used some of my read mood to read what we're about to talk about.

415
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,140
Scott: But prior to that, and probably starting after tonight, I'll do some more Genji reading.

416
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,640
Scott: It helps when it's warm out because then I can go on the balcony and read.

417
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,240
Scott: That's nicer than bed reading.

418
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,899
Rym: Balcony, go to the park right there because Queensbridge Park is just right next door.

419
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,544
Rym: Can't use our little garden yet.

420
00:26:08,585 --> 00:26:14,880
Rym: There's like 20 workers and a whole bunch of platforms as they're replacing the entire facade of our stupid building.

421
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:15,880
Scott: Well.

422
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:17,794
Scott: So yeah.

423
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:18,359
Scott: Anyway.

424
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:20,589
Rym: Spider-Man 2099.

425
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:22,798
Rym: I will admit, I had never read any until now.

426
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:30,620
Rym: This was something that Scott would bring this comic up a lot when we were just like early days at RIT.

427
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:37,392
Rym: Like anytime superheroes came up, Scott would like make a point of saying, "Oh yeah, Spider-Man 2099.

428
00:26:37,392 --> 00:26:38,236
Rym: That was the good one.

429
00:26:38,256 --> 00:26:38,779
Rym: That's the one I

430
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:39,000
Rym: read.".

431
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,321
Scott: Yeah.

432
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:51,680
Scott: So yeah, so the backstory is that when I was a kid in the early 90s, I didn't really, you know, I read comics in the newspaper and I enjoyed a Spider-Man or whatever, but I wasn't reading comic books, comic books.

433
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,000
Scott: And then a friend down the kid who lived down the street was reading comic books.

434
00:26:55,543 --> 00:26:57,460
Scott: And then the comic book store opened in the mall.

435
00:26:58,061 --> 00:27:02,160
Scott: So once the comic book store opened in the mall, well, it's like, well now, right, I can buy comic books.

436
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:15,219
Scott: So I went there and while there were many comics characters, I enjoyed like regular old Spider-Man or X-Men and, you know, all the space, cosmic stuff, obviously, you know, mostly Marvel stuff.

437
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:21,260
Scott: All the comics, you know, I just had this thing where I needed to know the whole story.

438
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,140
Scott: I couldn't, even then I was like against the cross.

439
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,520
Scott: I understood these crossovers and I was against them.

440
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Scott: Even then, A, because I didn't have enough money to buy that many comics.

441
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,357
Scott: I was like, no, you're not, I'm not falling for that.

442
00:27:32,438 --> 00:27:32,639
Scott: Right.

443
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,457
Scott: But B, I was like, well, I haven't read, you're on Uncanny X-Men 200 and what?

444
00:27:38,381 --> 00:27:40,117
Scott: It's like, I'm not buying 200 comics.

445
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:40,379
Scott: Right.

446
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:47,698
Scott: There weren't trade paperbacks or anything in those early nineties days, you know, and I wanted to start with number one and get the whole story.

447
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:48,040
Scott: Right.

448
00:27:48,622 --> 00:27:50,720
Scott: So there were comics that I would buy.

449
00:27:51,060 --> 00:28:03,680
Scott: I bought this miniseries like NX at one point, which is only like a four issue miniseries, just because it was a cool cyborg dude, but also I could get the whole, I saw number one on the shelf in the comic book store and I'm like, I can read the whole damn thing.

450
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:04,251
Scott: Hooray.

451
00:28:04,394 --> 00:28:04,620
Scott: Right.

452
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:12,496
Scott: So it just coincidence that at that time, 1992, I believe when I was a kid going to comic book store.

453
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:13,160
Scott: Right.

454
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,961
Scott: There was a new thing from Marvel, which is 2099.

455
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:25,513
Scott: They made a whole bunch of comics that were based on the idea that, well, it's the Marvel Universe, but in the year 2099, like almost over 100 years from now.

456
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:27,501
Scott: Right.

457
00:28:28,264 --> 00:28:28,646
Scott: Because it was 1992.

458
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:29,972
Scott: So 2099 was sort of like, you know, out there.

459
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:31,841
Scott: Right.

460
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:36,419
Scott: And it's sort of a cyberpunk universe because it's so far out there.

461
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:39,893
Scott: And what they did is they had different series.

462
00:28:39,913 --> 00:28:41,040
Scott: They had Spider-Man, obviously.

463
00:28:41,783 --> 00:28:44,859
Scott: They had X-Men 2099, which I bought the first issue of, but didn't read any more of.

464
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:53,250
Scott: There was Ravage 2099, Punisher 2099, Doom 2099, and maybe some others came later.

465
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,117
Scott: I think there might've been a Fantastic Four 2099 later.

466
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,039
Scott: I could be wrong on that, but at the start they just had this set of them.

467
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:02,320
Scott: So I obviously couldn't afford to buy that in my comic books.

468
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,060
Scott: And as we discussed earlier, I was stupidly spending a lot of money on superhero cards.

469
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,560
Rym: That was something we were talking about a lot in our own life.

470
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:28,018
Rym: I did a similar thing where I would buy these fucking cards and then I'd have them and I'd piece together the stories, or at least try to piece together the stories of superheroes I'd never read because they weren't in the comics I was reading, but it would have been cheaper to just buy the comics they were in.

471
00:29:29,261 --> 00:29:31,648
Scott: The first issue of Spider-Man 2099 was $1.75 in 1992 US dollars.

472
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,577
Scott: And nowadays a comic book would be like $3 or $4, a floppy one like that.

473
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,420
Scott: It had a fancy foil sort of cardboard cover and it came with a poster, I think.

474
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:53,365
Scott: But issue two was $1.25 maybe, and I think the price went up over time a little bit, but really cheap.

475
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:57,440
Scott: A pack of cards then was about the same price, maybe even more.

476
00:29:57,721 --> 00:30:01,080
Rym: A pack of cards, because there are a lot of different Marvel cards.

477
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,920
Scott: It depended which cards you bought.

478
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:10,137
Rym: Yeah, the regular ones were about the same price for a pack as the comics, but there was this one series that was fancy, because I remember as a kid, this was probably '92, '93.

479
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:23,720
Scott: The Masterpieces one, which was an advertisement on the back of issue one of Spider-Man 2099, was an ad for Marvel Masterpieces, which were thicker cards with fancier oil painting art.

480
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,360
Scott: They were really unbelievable.

481
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,600
Scott: I have this very good art on these cards.

482
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:33,176
Rym: Very clear memory of being at the Gibraltar Trade Center in Michigan, and those cards were $4 a pack.

483
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,385
Scott: Yeah, they were expensive.

484
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:40,206
Scott: I only have a very small number, like a handful of those cards, because they were so much money.

485
00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:42,420
Scott: But they're really nice.

486
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,458
Scott: Maybe I could get a full set of them on eBay cheap or something nowadays, right?

487
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:46,820
Scott: Who knows?

488
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:55,180
Scott: Anyway, so when I was a kid, Spider-Man 2099 came at an exact right time, and I bought every issue until the comic book store went out of business.

489
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,369
Scott: So I didn't finish the series, because the comic book store eventually went out of business when that was no longer a thing.

490
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:00,720
Scott: But that was after years, right?

491
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,528
Scott: It's like only 12 issues a year.

492
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:05,100
Scott: Once a month I'd go to the comic book store and get an issue.

493
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:12,573
Scott: And these issues are tiny, so you're going to get a very small amount of story every month over this very slow pace, right?

494
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:13,537
Scott: I got to like 20 or 30 issues.

495
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,690
Scott: That was like three or four years' worth.

496
00:31:17,091 --> 00:31:23,480
Scott: And then the series ended after that, but I wasn't able to get those issues until later in life by using eBay and such.

497
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:25,126
Scott: Much later in life.

498
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:27,660
Scott: I would think I was living in Beacon maybe when I scooped those up.

499
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,404
Scott: The remainders?

500
00:31:28,424 --> 00:31:29,230
Scott: I don't even remember.

501
00:31:29,753 --> 00:31:30,639
Scott: Maybe even later than that.

502
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:37,026
Scott: So I never read the whole thing as a kid, but I read it every issue every month for a very long period of time.

503
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:51,620
Scott: And also, going back in my mind, as I became an adult and realized, I hadn't read, for example, like William Gibson novels, like pre-college I want to say even, right?

504
00:31:53,828 --> 00:32:00,460
Scott: But when I would read them or watch Ghost in the Shell or something, like all these cyberpunk tropes, like I already understood them, right?

505
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,127
Scott: And I didn't know from where.

506
00:32:02,327 --> 00:32:05,661
Scott: And then I realized, oh, it was from Spider-Man 2099.

507
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:10,000
Scott: That's where I learned all cyberpunk related things was from this comic.

508
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,477
Scott: And now reading it again, just yesterday, it's like there's even more stuff.

509
00:32:14,538 --> 00:32:19,059
Scott: I can see that this comic borrowed from and introduced me to.

510
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,646
Rym: You know, it's fun because I double checked.

511
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:23,340
Rym: You know what got me into cyberpunk primarily as a kid?

512
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,529
Rym: Because it also came out in 1992, was Shadowrun 2nd Edition.

513
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,120
Rym: Because the first edition was in '89 and the second edition is the book I had.

514
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:33,462
Scott: Yep.

515
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:35,900
Scott: I also just want to briefly, we got to talk about the adverts.

516
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,288
Scott: You know, a comic book, floppy comic books.

517
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,260
Scott: You read this pirated version online, right?

518
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:41,529
Rym: Yep.

519
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:42,645
Scott: Yeah.

520
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:42,807
Scott: Okay.

521
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,160
Scott: So I read the actual comics.

522
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,307
Rym: It's on Comixology, too.

523
00:32:45,368 --> 00:32:45,711
Rym: I checked.

524
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:46,780
Rym: You can actually read it legit.

525
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:47,942
Scott: Oh, okay.

526
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:52,979
Scott: But yeah, I read the actual comic books from the 90s that I have, which means the advertisements were still in there.

527
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:54,460
Scott: Oh, that's a treasure.

528
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,180
Scott: So, you know, we say block all ads everywhere always, which is true.

529
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:05,980
Scott: But once the thing an ad is for is no longer a thing, suddenly that ad transforms into art, right?

530
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:08,840
Scott: Because it's like you can't buy the thing anymore.

531
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,220
Scott: So notable things advertisement-wise, lots of ads for cards of all shapes and sizes.

532
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,990
Rym: Cards for so big back then.

533
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:18,497
Rym: Not that they're not big now, but...

534
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,960
Scott: Ads for foods like Charleston Chew or, you know, Justice Fruit Pie equivalent, right?

535
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,380
Scott: Lots of SNES and Game Boy game ads, right?

536
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,109
Scott: I mean, '92 is some peak SNES time.

537
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,880
Scott: Hook for SNES, you know, things of that nature.

538
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,878
Scott: Wing Commander SNES, Chuck Rock SNES.

539
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,059
Rym: Rad Final Fantasy Mystic Quest ad.

540
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,479
Rym: Because when Scott mentioned that he saw an ad for it, I imagined in my head what that fucking ad looked like because it was weird and I remembered it.

541
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,419
Scott: It was a big ad campaign in all of the video games.

542
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:57,506
Rym: It was a weird ad campaign because some of these SNES ads from the early 90s were like, "Hey, this is a game you could

543
00:33:57,526 --> 00:33:57,707
Rym: play.".

544
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:03,460
Rym: But a lot of them did this weird, like, the ad almost had nothing to do with the game at all.

545
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,408
Rym: Like, it's a picture of a brain.

546
00:34:06,568 --> 00:34:07,352
Rym: Get out of body.

547
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,060
Rym: Brain transplant, $40.

548
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,127
Rym: A tiny print at the bottom.

549
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:13,239
Rym: Final Fantasy Mystic Quest on the SNES.

550
00:34:14,141 --> 00:34:14,322
Scott: Yep.

551
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:21,699
Scott: Also ads for movies, which were basically, when there's an ad for a movie in a comic book, it's basically just the movie poster taking up a full page.

552
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,299
Scott: I saw Aladdin coming soon.

553
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:24,684
Scott: Ooh!

554
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,949
Scott: Disney's Aladdin coming soon.

555
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:29,799
Scott: Candyman coming soon.

556
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,342
Scott: Ooh!

557
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:30,940
Rym: Right?

558
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:32,619
Rym: Those hit me right in the old.

559
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,645
Scott: Right, exactly.

560
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:35,672
Scott: What was the other one?

561
00:34:35,772 --> 00:34:37,060
Scott: Army of Darkness coming soon.

562
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:37,862
Rym: Wow.

563
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,000
Scott: It's like, holy shit.

564
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,179
Rym: I saw all of those in the theater.

565
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,620
Scott: Right, it's like, I don't even know if I saw all of those.

566
00:34:46,522 --> 00:34:49,100
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, the ads were really something.

567
00:34:49,481 --> 00:34:52,600
Scott: And lots of ads for, like, you know, buying comic books, right?

568
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:56,400
Scott: I forgot you could subscribe to comic books, like, directly from Marvel.

569
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,218
Scott: Like, that was a thing.

570
00:34:58,982 --> 00:35:00,048
Scott: So yeah, really interesting.

571
00:35:00,088 --> 00:35:02,100
Scott: The ads are really a historic thing going on here.

572
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,860
Scott: Okay, so now let's talk about the comic, right?

573
00:35:05,585 --> 00:35:09,420
Scott: So, Spider-Man 2099 is basically, it's far future.

574
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,980
Scott: It's still, it is the Marvel Universe, though.

575
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:21,100
Scott: So there was, like, this, the Marvel Universe is in the past, but clearly something has happened that has, you know, the heroic era ended, right?

576
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:21,367
Scott: Yep.

577
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:25,400
Scott: It's very mysterious, but all the superheroes are dead and/or gone.

578
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:26,488
Rym: Yeah, with a few caveats.

579
00:35:26,508 --> 00:35:28,220
Rym: Like, Doctor Doom is doing something.

580
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,460
Scott: But is that the, I forget if that's the, I haven't read, I have some Doom 2099, but I haven't read enough to know if that's the original guy.

581
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:42,112
Rym: All I know is whoever is in that Doctor Doom costume is like, "Oh, just as I reemerged, so too does the Spider-Man.

582
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:42,974
Rym: There is no way.

583
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:43,376
Rym: This is a

584
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:44,038
Rym: coincidence.".

585
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:46,188
Scott: Sure.

586
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:48,120
Scott: It could be the original Doctor Doom Resurrected.

587
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,320
Scott: It's definitely running Latveria, which still exists somewhere on the map, right?

588
00:35:52,662 --> 00:35:56,540
Scott: But clearly there's, you know, if there's a government, it's not really doing much.

589
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,640
Scott: It's now a very William Gibson-esque cyberpunk dystopia.

590
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:04,820
Scott: There are mega-corporations that sort of really actually run the world.

591
00:36:05,261 --> 00:36:10,360
Scott: The police are just, you know, they work for the corporation, right?

592
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,325
Scott: They're corporate cops.

593
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:14,160
Scott: They're not public cops that someone voted for, right?

594
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:16,500
Scott: The company that runs everything is Alchemists.

595
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,660
Scott: If you watched these, you know, what's the Spider-Man movie?

596
00:36:20,883 --> 00:36:21,368
Scott: The good one?

597
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:22,057
Rym: The animated one?

598
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:25,655
Scott: If you watched Into the Spider-Verse, the name of the company is Alchemax.

599
00:36:25,715 --> 00:36:26,740
Scott: that came from this comic.

600
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,500
Rym: I assumed it was just Alchemax, like alchemy and chemistry.

601
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,560
Scott: It could be, it could be, oh sure, Alchemax, whatever.

602
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,340
Scott: How you pronounce it, I don't know how you pronounce it.

603
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,520
Scott: But that's where the company came from, right?

604
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:36,959
Scott: That was from this.

605
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,460
Scott: So, yeah, it's corporations run everything.

606
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,127
Scott: There's a cyberspace world.

607
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,720
Scott: You didn't get that far to actually read about the cyberspace brother.

608
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,420
Rym: No, I got up to reading this.

609
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,998
Rym: I got up to when he fights the vulture and deals with him and goes back uptown.

610
00:36:53,301 --> 00:37:01,820
Scott: So there's this jerky dude who is a genius geneticist person who was brought up by the company.

611
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,660
Scott: Like he went to company school, right?

612
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,100
Scott: Because he was gifted, they brought him into the company school.

613
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:08,460
Scott: They taught him everything he knows, right?

614
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,150
Scott: But he's a huge asshole, right?

615
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,520
Scott: He's just an asshole to everyone.

616
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:15,699
Rym: Yeah, like it starts, he's being an asshole to people who deserve it.

617
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:18,820
Rym: But then he's also an asshole to like his friends, his fiance.

618
00:37:20,061 --> 00:37:25,540
Scott: His fiance is like the best, awesomest person and he treats her so poorly.

619
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,099
Scott: It's like, why are you, how did you even get with this guy to begin with?

620
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:34,060
Scott: He treats his brother who's a really nice, you know, if somewhat milk toasty kind of guy.

621
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,420
Scott: You know, but talented and has his own positive traits.

622
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,880
Rym: Dude reminds me of a good looking cereal figgis if any of you have watched Archer.

623
00:37:42,082 --> 00:37:44,180
Scott: Yeah, his name is Miguel O'Hara, right?

624
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,140
Scott: So his mom is Hispanic, his dad is Irish, he didn't get to that part yet.

625
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:48,665
Rym: Yeah, he did.

626
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:49,518
Rym: That came up right away.

627
00:37:50,345 --> 00:37:50,660
Rym: Oh, okay.

628
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,919
Rym: He breaks that up like four times.

629
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,182
Scott: Oh, okay.

630
00:37:54,202 --> 00:37:56,940
Scott: Because you actually see the mom and dad eventually.

631
00:37:58,181 --> 00:38:03,400
Scott: Because in later issues, there's sort of a backup feature that is like young Miguel O'Hara.

632
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,959
Scott: And it shows him in the company school and stuff.

633
00:38:06,402 --> 00:38:08,200
Scott: And you actually see his parents and everything.

634
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:09,979
Scott: We didn't get that far.

635
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:13,420
Scott: So, but yeah, he's this guy and he's just an asshole.

636
00:38:13,721 --> 00:38:19,380
Scott: In his mind, when you see what he's thinking, he's not really thinking bad thoughts or doing bad things.

637
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,840
Scott: In fact, one of the first things you see him doing is advocating for not human testing.

638
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,229
Scott: He's got like a genetic device.

639
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:27,780
Scott: He doesn't want to test it on humans.

640
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,419
Scott: Like he has a high moral standing in terms of what he wants to do.

641
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,260
Scott: It's like you're presented as a good person.

642
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:38,060
Scott: He just is really rude and nasty to everybody.

643
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,080
Rym: Whether they deserve it or not.

644
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,819
Rym: He's rude and nasty to people who deserve it.

645
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:50,460
Rym: And like, it's not spoilers for this old comic book, but like in the first couple issues, like basically what happens is he's like working for this evil company.

646
00:38:50,802 --> 00:38:53,280
Rym: They make him do something too evil and it causes someone to die.

647
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:55,220
Rym: It's a very RoboCop style scene.

648
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:57,191
Rym: And then he's like, fuck it.

649
00:38:57,271 --> 00:38:57,614
Rym: I quit.

650
00:38:57,815 --> 00:38:58,480
Rym: Fuck you all.

651
00:38:58,622 --> 00:38:59,720
Rym: And he just quits and leaves.

652
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:02,289
Scott: The high moral standing.

653
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:03,860
Scott: actions wise, right?

654
00:39:04,983 --> 00:39:06,800
Scott: But not behavior wise.

655
00:39:06,961 --> 00:39:09,799
Rym: It doesn't work out of course, but he tries to quit.

656
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:15,519
Scott: So yeah, obviously he becomes the Spider-Man, right?

657
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:33,640
Scott: The genetics of the original Spider-Man are like in their database and he combines them with his own DNA in order to kick the company guy, the evil company boss guy, sort of gets him addicted to a drug that he will die if he doesn't get it and sort of trap him in the company.

658
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,760
Scott: He tries to kick the drug by modifying his own DNA.

659
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:39,460
Scott: He figures, well, I'm going to die from the drug anyway.

660
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,260
Scott: He's like, if this fails and I die, I'm breaking even.

661
00:39:43,801 --> 00:39:52,840
Scott: So he tries it, goes wrong because this other jerk comes into the play and combines his DNA with the original Peter Parker Spider-Man's DNA.

662
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:56,240
Scott: And now he's biologically Spider-Man, right?

663
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:03,359
Scott: His webs come out of his actual, like these glands in his arms or some shit as opposed to Peter Parker who made a web shooter, right?

664
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:08,060
Scott: He climbs with claws that he has to retract, not with stickiness.

665
00:40:09,601 --> 00:40:21,120
Scott: The only thing he has that's not his actual power is he has a costume that, because he's Hispanic, from the Day of the Dead festival, he had a costume made out of, what's it, UMD or something?

666
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,820
Rym: Yeah, like ultra unstable matter or something.

667
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,419
Scott: Unstable molecules fabric, UMF, I think.

668
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,600
Scott: I don't know, but it's basically fancy material that is bulletproof and everything.

669
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:38,200
Scott: It's really fancy and he has that because he wanted, he owns it because obviously a lot of money.

670
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:43,780
Scott: So he bought it to wear to the festival in case, you know, because the festival is going to get rowdy, right?

671
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,840
Scott: And then he turns that into his Spider-Man costume and now it's armored.

672
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:53,300
Scott: But other than that, all his powers are biological in nature.

673
00:40:54,761 --> 00:41:06,000
Scott: And so yeah, he ends up just by, you know, he's not like even trying to be Spider-Man the way that Peter Parker decided to go out and be Spider-Man after a certain amount of time.

674
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,737
Scott: He's like, "All right, I'm going to go find criminals and stop

675
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:08,878
Scott: them.".

676
00:41:09,422 --> 00:41:12,020
Scott: He's just caught in these scenarios, right?

677
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:18,680
Scott: Of people going after him, going after the people he knows and loves and, you know, just bumping into circumstance.

678
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:21,400
Scott: Like he has to do Spider-Man shit.

679
00:41:22,221 --> 00:41:26,040
Scott: And even though his skills are not high, his powers make up for it.

680
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,360
Scott: And he usually wins even against like these trained killers sent to hunt him down, right?

681
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,379
Scott: He's just too strong for them, even though they have much more combat training and such.

682
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,414
Scott: And yeah, other than that, it's his cyberpunk troubles.

683
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:44,859
Rym: The first many issues are he's just trying to figure out what to do.

684
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,040
Scott: The first three issues are the origin.

685
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:55,460
Rym: Yeah, but it's like every time he just almost has a moment to rest, some random superpower jerk-off shows up and tries to fight him.

686
00:41:56,565 --> 00:41:57,215
Scott: Yep, pretty much.

687
00:42:00,763 --> 00:42:03,860
Scott: There are some issues that are too much fighting, right?

688
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:07,596
Scott: Like he fights the Vulture for most of an issue and it's sort of like, "All right,

689
00:42:07,636 --> 00:42:07,857
Scott: dude.".

690
00:42:09,581 --> 00:42:12,680
Scott: But all the circumstances, they get a lot done.

691
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,260
Scott: When they're not fighting, there's a lot happening in just a few pages, right?

692
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:29,760
Scott: There'll be like two pages where the boss, Spider-Man's girlfriend, the good one, the fiancé, goes to meet the evil corporate boss, right?

693
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,278
Scott: Stone, Tyler Stone, yeah?

694
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,332
Scott: To sort of ask him, because he's like, "Hey, where's my fiancé?

695
00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:37,455
Scott: I haven't seen him in forever.

696
00:42:37,495 --> 00:42:38,177
Scott: You're his boss.

697
00:42:38,398 --> 00:42:39,039
Scott: Do you know where he

698
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,280
Scott: is?".

699
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:43,614
Scott: And he shows her all this shit like, "Hey, look, we're terraforming Mars.

700
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:44,738
Scott: We're terraforming under the

701
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:45,019
Scott: sea.".

702
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,717
Scott: He shows her all this stuff and it reveals this whole part of the universe within two pages.

703
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,256
Scott: And it's like, "Whoa, that's a lot of information that really fleshes out this world a

704
00:42:56,337 --> 00:42:56,618
Scott: lot.".

705
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:00,592
Rym: The world is actually moderately complex in an interesting way.

706
00:43:00,672 --> 00:43:02,900
Rym: I enjoyed reading what I read and I'm going to keep reading it.

707
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,140
Scott: It's a really good cyberpunk world because it's not really inventive as far as cyberpunk worlds go.

708
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:14,620
Scott: It came out in the early 90s after other cyberpunk things already existed, right?

709
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,325
Scott: Like when did Neuromancer come out, right?

710
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,449
Scott: Neuromancer.

711
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,536
Scott: No way, it came out after this.

712
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:20,078
Scott: '84, right?

713
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,650
Scott: So it's ten years of cyberpunk or more, right?

714
00:43:23,731 --> 00:43:25,497
Scott: At least ten years of cyberpunk stuff.

715
00:43:25,557 --> 00:43:26,300
Scott: it's borrowing from.

716
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,390
Scott: But the cops fly around on these bikes, they're 100% Akira.

717
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:31,933
Scott: Peter David is the writer on this.

718
00:43:35,922 --> 00:43:42,519
Rym: You go downtown to where the corporations don't give a shit and they basically just hire random thugs to be the cops down there.

719
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,795
Scott: Well, so New York, it takes place in New York/Nueva York, right?

720
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:49,400
Scott: Which is very fascinating.

721
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:54,256
Scott: What they've done is the original New York is on the ground, right?

722
00:43:54,296 --> 00:43:55,180
Scott: The floor of Earth.

723
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,031
Rym: Yeah, that's downtown in this comic.

724
00:43:57,192 --> 00:43:58,240
Rym: That's literally down.

725
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,129
Scott: Yeah, downtown isn't south, it's down, right?

726
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:07,160
Scott: They ran out of space and they built New York at some point vertically up.

727
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:07,860
Rym: Jetson style.

728
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:14,455
Scott: It's sort of Jetson style in that it's up, but it's not Jetson style where everything's spread out.

729
00:44:14,575 --> 00:44:16,440
Scott: It's compacted and up, right?

730
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,816
Scott: So if you're up in New New York, up above, you're in a flying maglev car, right?

731
00:44:22,836 --> 00:44:24,280
Scott: You're not using the wheels on the car.

732
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:31,192
Scott: You're in a skyscraper because everything is a skyscraper, right?

733
00:44:31,312 --> 00:44:31,973
Scott: There's no dirt.

734
00:44:33,175 --> 00:44:35,520
Scott: If you've got dirt, you've got the dirt from somewhere, right?

735
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,990
Scott: You go to the park, it's not dirt.

736
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,080
Scott: It's like a floating platform of some kind, right?

737
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:56,880
Scott: And then you can pop the wheels out of your maglev car, bop onto a road, drive down a tunnel that goes down and come out into the old New York on the ground where everything sucks and everyone's either unemployed or part of a gang, and it's the warriors down there, right?

738
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:08,000
Scott: And everything up above is cyberpunk dystopia, so it's either the warriors cyberpunk or evil, wealthy cyberpunk people on top, right?

739
00:45:08,743 --> 00:45:10,359
Scott: It's kind of a fascinating world.

740
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:27,031
Rym: Especially because it's all layered over this, like, the precursor, like, the people who are reading other Marvel comics have fresh in their minds what was going on in the Marvel comics in the contemporary era, and you see echoes of what was going on in this future era.

741
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:31,540
Rym: Like, there's the people who've worshipped Thor, like, the Thorites wandering around dressing up like Thor.

742
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,130
Scott: Even though the heroic era has ended, clearly it was so impactful, right?

743
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,680
Scott: I mean, if anything from the real Marvel universe was real, that would impact history forever, right?

744
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,322
Scott: And so it does.

745
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:49,360
Scott: So yeah, there's the people who believe in Thor, like, that's their religion, and some of them are fanatical and some of them are sort of normal.

746
00:45:50,022 --> 00:45:54,376
Scott: They just believe in Thor the way, like, a normal Christian person would believe in God, you know?

747
00:45:54,396 --> 00:45:55,700
Scott: It's like, you know, whatever.

748
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:05,960
Scott: And then you have, for example, you know, you might not, if you're not, you know, I didn't realize this as a kid, but like, they taught, like, one of the evil cyber companies is Stark Fujikawa.

749
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,420
Scott: It's like, oh, at some point Iron Man's company merged with a Japanese company.

750
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:10,881
Rym: Yup.

751
00:46:11,222 --> 00:46:18,980
Rym: One sour note that does not hold up well is that the first villain he fights is this, like, super fakie Japanese samurai stereotype.

752
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,180
Scott: No, the first villain he fights is Venture.

753
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:21,698
Rym: True.

754
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,346
Scott: The second villain he fights is- Venture's cool.

755
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:26,900
Scott: The Specialist is the second one.

756
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:36,140
Rym: The Specialist is a stereotypical- He is a samurai, screaming, fanatic Japanese with both a samurai sword and nunchucks for some reason.

757
00:46:36,581 --> 00:46:36,821
Scott: Right.

758
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:47,880
Scott: It's the typical, you know, racist stereotype depiction of, you know, of Asian-ness, especially Japanese, you know, imagery and aesthetic merged with the cyberpunk stuff.

759
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:59,238
Scott: So it's very in with the times and the style there, but it's, you know, a very, you know, the depiction is like, oh, we have to uphold our honor, right?

760
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:00,440
Scott: And it's like, oh, God, really?

761
00:47:03,144 --> 00:47:10,078
Scott: But it's from 1992, so, you know, it doesn't excuse it, but I gotta point it out that it's there, right?

762
00:47:10,138 --> 00:47:11,400
Scott: It doesn't hold up well at all.

763
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:20,660
Rym: Yeah, I mean, the character is dispatched and it moves on from that pretty quick, but that corporation is still one of the major players, so it's not gonna go away entirely.

764
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,119
Scott: No, that plot definitely comes back into play after a certain point.

765
00:47:26,901 --> 00:47:37,207
Scott: But yeah, if you want to read a Spider-Man story, right, but you don't have to know shit about anything else- Yeah, you don't need to know anything.

766
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:39,220
Rym: If you ever heard of Thor, all right, you're good.

767
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:45,240
Scott: Right, it's like, if you know some stuff about the Marvel Universe, like, it plays in, but not really.

768
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:45,705
Rym: Yup.

769
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,360
Scott: There is a, you didn't get to the crossover, there's a Hammer-Thor-related crossover at some point.

770
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,789
Rym: Oh, Thor shows up?

771
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,020
Rym: How could I have possibly?

772
00:47:56,282 --> 00:48:06,318
Scott: Well, no, there's one issue, the crossover that comes, I forget what it's actually called, it's Hammer-something, it's related to the Thorites, but it's one issue in each of the 2099 comics, right?

773
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:19,940
Scott: So I forget what the order is of that, but it's basically like you would have to stop reading Spider-Man 2099 for a minute and read, like, a Doom issue, a Ravage issue, a Punisher issue, right, to get the whole story together.

774
00:48:21,944 --> 00:48:23,320
Scott: It's a very tiny little crossover.

775
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,039
Rym: I can deal with that.

776
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,672
Scott: And after that, it's sort of, I don't think it crossovers again after that.

777
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:30,060
Scott: I think it just keeps going straight.

778
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:37,940
Scott: I don't know if they wrap, you know, I don't think I ever finished all the issues that came out at the time, so I don't know if it ever, like, wraps things up.

779
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:48,700
Scott: But what does happen is over the years, you know, obviously there was a big gap of many years, but they started using Spider-Man 2099 again in other comics, like, he still exists.

780
00:48:50,421 --> 00:49:02,540
Scott: There have been other Marvel comics where he came as a character, like, from another dimension or they went to the 2099 dimension or, you know, I think he was trapped in the regular Marvel universe for some time and then got sent back.

781
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:09,860
Scott: It's like, you know, Miguel O'Hara, the character, he keeps going and he's still a part of Marvel in some ways, right?

782
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:20,140
Scott: But this core story of Spider-Man 2099 is, you know, I don't know if it ends, but it goes and then they don't print any more comics, so it's ending whether you like it or not.

783
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,067
Rym: Yeah, the dialogue is actually better than the other comics I read from that era.

784
00:49:26,348 --> 00:49:33,560
Rym: Like, it's a little verbose like these kinds of comics tend to be, but the dialogue actually conveys a lot of information.

785
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:37,264
Scott: You don't get the "I hit you, you little guy," right?

786
00:49:37,284 --> 00:49:50,100
Scott: It's like when they're fighting and all the frames and the panels are full of combat, they're actually just talking to each other, like, about, you know, whatever it is that is at issue here, right?

787
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,623
Scott: Usually they're like bargaining, right?

788
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:56,410
Scott: It's like, "Listen, just stop fighting me and, you know, I know what you want.

789
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:57,772
Scott: This is what I want," right?

790
00:49:57,812 --> 00:49:58,854
Scott: It's like, "Don't kill me.

791
00:49:58,874 --> 00:49:59,475
Scott: What if I kill

792
00:49:59,495 --> 00:49:59,595
Scott: you?".

793
00:49:59,615 --> 00:50:02,020
Scott: You know, that's the kind of conversation they're having.

794
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:11,187
Scott: It's just sort of a big contrast with regular Spider-Man who will have sort of witty, good-natured banter, right?

795
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,169
Scott: And not generally kill people.

796
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:17,773
Scott: Spider-Man 2099 will be an asshole to people and kill them by accident.

797
00:50:17,813 --> 00:50:19,655
Scott: Like, he kills people and he's like, "Oh, fuck," right?

798
00:50:19,675 --> 00:50:24,900
Scott: He's like, "Oops," because he's like usually with his claws by accident because he forgets he has them, right?

799
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,848
Scott: It's like he slits a dude's throat with the claws and he's like, "Oh, fuck.

800
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:30,076
Scott: I wasn't trying to do that.

801
00:50:30,618 --> 00:50:30,738
Scott: Oh,

802
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:30,999
Scott: no.".

803
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,739
Rym: He's still learning his powers.

804
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,643
Scott: Yeah.

805
00:50:34,663 --> 00:50:36,852
Scott: Just, you know, just killing people by accident, that's all.

806
00:50:37,193 --> 00:50:38,237
Scott: You know, no big deal.

807
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:38,920
Scott: Just murder.

808
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:46,376
Rym: But it's also got just like a pretty fun and varied cast of characters and I'm honestly pretty into it.

809
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:48,340
Rym: Like, there's not really much to spoil.

810
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,868
Scott: I grew up on this thing, right?

811
00:50:52,888 --> 00:50:54,370
Scott: Like, I was reading this every month.

812
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:59,660
Scott: This is like my number one thing from like the early 90s for three or four plus years, right?

813
00:51:00,901 --> 00:51:10,580
Scott: And that really, you know, looking like I didn't think about it much at the time, like after I, you know, but now that I think about it, it's like, "Oh, that really doesn't form a lot of what I like

814
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:10,660
Scott: now.".

815
00:51:12,521 --> 00:51:18,911
Scott: I like things like this and this was probably the first thing like this that I was into, right?

816
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:24,220
Scott: That probably set my taste, I think, more so than a lot of things.

817
00:51:24,701 --> 00:51:28,671
Scott: Oh, one last somewhat unrelated thing.

818
00:51:28,691 --> 00:51:31,900
Scott: So, I guess you wouldn't see this either not having read the actual issues.

819
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:51,680
Scott: But in the day, they would always dedicate a page of each comic to the bullpen bulletin, which is sort of like this behind the scenes sort of like you'd get one, there would be a one panel comic, like a far side, but it would be, the main character of it would be the editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, right?

820
00:51:52,121 --> 00:52:03,557
Scott: The top half would be a letter from Stan Lee and the bottom half would be a letter from the editor-in-chief guy, who at the time I think was, was it Tom DeFalco, I guess, maybe?

821
00:52:03,577 --> 00:52:03,998
Scott: I don't know.

822
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:05,380
Scott: I had to look at it again.

823
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,026
Scott: And it was like telling you about what was going on at Marvel Comics, right?

824
00:52:10,928 --> 00:52:19,300
Scott: And it sort of was interesting in that even if you were just reading one Marvel comic, by reading this thing, you sort of got this behind the scenes.

825
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:23,930
Scott: They brought you, sort of gave you more of a community feeling, right?

826
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:27,458
Scott: Like, "Hey, Marvel readers, you're in with us, right?

827
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:27,759
Scott: Let us...".

828
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,365
Scott: Because if you didn't have that, you would just be reading the comic.

829
00:52:32,006 --> 00:52:33,729
Scott: As a kid, you're not looking at who the writer is.

830
00:52:33,769 --> 00:52:38,137
Scott: I didn't pay attention to who the writer was until late 2000s, right?

831
00:52:38,277 --> 00:52:39,860
Scott: I didn't know Peter David's name before then.

832
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:42,687
Scott: Now I know exactly who he is, right?

833
00:52:42,907 --> 00:52:44,231
Scott: But I didn't know it.

834
00:52:44,271 --> 00:52:47,840
Scott: then, even though we wrote all of these issues, pretty much.

835
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:59,693
Scott: And that sort of community building, by having that one page, I think is something that nowadays we have it, but we have it so much that you don't notice it.

836
00:52:59,733 --> 00:53:04,660
Scott: Like, someone has a Patreon, it's like you are involved with the creators on everything, right?

837
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:12,152
Scott: It's like no matter what art you're into, like you know who the creators are, you're following them on Twitter, that's sort of like automatic, right?

838
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:16,940
Scott: That you're in that behind the scenes, knowing what the creators are up to community thing.

839
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:27,680
Scott: You don't have this sort of "you're only getting the artwork and the creators are inaccessible and unknown unless they purposefully bring you in" kind of thing.

840
00:53:28,261 --> 00:53:30,743
Scott: So that really stood out to me, that bullpen bulletin page.

841
00:53:31,163 --> 00:53:47,280
Scott: And also, just to wrap this up with another feel old, the bullpen bulletin page in the very first issue, Stan Lee's note is basically an advertisement because he's so excited that X-Men cartoon is about to be on Fox.

842
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:51,460
Rym: Oh no, I remember when that premiered.

843
00:53:52,262 --> 00:54:06,520
Scott: Stan Lee's like "X-Men's gonna be on Fox real soon" and I'm so excited that it's not... Yeah, and he's excited because it's actually true to what X-Men is about and isn't, you know, one of those messed up adaptations.

844
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:14,680
Scott: And then in the further issues, like four or five issues in, you start seeing ads for X-Men cartoon VHS tapes.

845
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:22,457
Scott: Because each of these issues is a month apart, so yeah, by the time you're on issue five, you've seen a bunch of episodes, they're weekly, right?

846
00:54:22,657 --> 00:54:23,700
Scott: The VHS tapes are coming.

847
00:54:27,266 --> 00:54:28,360
Scott: That dates this comic.

848
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:33,047
Rym: Yup, and I guess the last thing is the dialogue, it is clear.

849
00:54:33,127 --> 00:54:40,918
Rym: these characters say the word "fuck" specifically a lot and they just translate it to "shock", but the way they use the word "shock" is 100% just "fuck".

850
00:54:42,881 --> 00:54:48,032
Scott: Yes, obviously, but I think it gives it sort of like a, they're trying to increase the cyberpunk feel, right, of like.

851
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:51,480
Scott: people have a different language, but they didn't go far enough with it, right?

852
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:57,852
Scott: People still have, like, you know, their 20th century accents from whatever, you know, nationality it was.

853
00:54:57,912 --> 00:55:02,140
Scott: I feel like by 2099, there's gonna be a lot more, you know, a lot less of that, right?

854
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:06,671
Rym: Yeah, I mean, what do we sound like compared to people from the, like, 70s?

855
00:55:06,851 --> 00:55:08,335
Rym: Mostly, we just use a lot of new jargon.

856
00:55:08,997 --> 00:55:10,220
Scott: Same swears, for the most part.

857
00:55:11,986 --> 00:55:15,640
Scott: Accents that, like, my parents' generation had, a lot of those are fading already, right?

858
00:55:17,001 --> 00:55:18,503
Rym: Yeah, though I did see a thing about how.

859
00:55:18,803 --> 00:55:33,260
Rym: there's a strong argument that the total number of English accents is not changing, it's just that different ones are gaining prominence, and localized, like, they're localized based on interest and internet stuff as opposed to physical location with a few exceptions.

860
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,461
Scott: That's good.

861
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,248
Scott: Oh, I guess we didn't talk about the artwork at all.

862
00:55:36,268 --> 00:55:39,440
Scott: The artwork in this comic is serviceable 90s comic artwork.

863
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:46,840
Rym: Because some parts of it, like, not Mobius quality, but, like, it has this Mobius aesthetic to it, like some of the sci-fi-y stuff.

864
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,100
Rym: But some parts of it are just very comic book punching.

865
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:57,458
Scott: Yeah, I think what it is, is you can definitely see the effort that, who's the penciler?

866
00:55:57,578 --> 00:55:58,180
Scott: Was it Leonardo?

867
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:06,400
Rym: Oh, they're really trying to make it look good, and look cool, and look different, and they're definitely leaning into the "it is the future, things are weird, for

868
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:06,580
Rym: real.".

869
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:13,387
Scott: Yeah, but there are some parts where the effort level clearly goes up on the drawing, right?

870
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:24,520
Scott: So it's like, there'll be these really impactful panels suddenly, where, like, you can tell that all the artists, the inker, the color, everyone, just like, that was a big two-page spread, they went hard, right?

871
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:30,853
Scott: And then there'll be a bunch of panels you're flipping through quickly, and you can see that they didn't put as much effort onto those, right?

872
00:56:30,873 --> 00:56:34,060
Scott: They're not as detailed, they're not as attention-grabbing.

873
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:43,778
Scott: And then you'll turn the page, and you'll see one that's amazing, and it looks like Spider-Man 2099 is coming out of the page at you, and staring you right in the face, right?

874
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:44,820
Scott: With something really intense.

875
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:49,285
Scott: And then the next page is just a lot more sketchy, just, alright, breeze through this, right?

876
00:56:49,705 --> 00:57:05,927
Scott: And it's sort of like, okay, you wanna be disappointed, they didn't put as much effort into all the art, but also, that effort controls the pacing and impact of the story as it goes, 'cause you, okay, flip through, flip through, suddenly don't flip through, right?

877
00:57:05,987 --> 00:57:13,140
Scott: Really, you know, this page you're gonna spend some time on, so they'll put better art to sort of keep you on this page longer, right?

878
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:29,660
Rym: But it also serves a good purpose of, it's often a little disorienting about where the characters are in space, but usually, especially during a fight, at least in the issues I read so far, but that almost serves to highlight how disoriented the characters are in terms of what's going on.

879
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,980
Rym: Like, he didn't even know a lot about downtown.

880
00:57:32,781 --> 00:57:36,760
Scott: Dude, Spider-Man 2099 is this dude who's been living in the fancy cyberspace.

881
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:48,280
Rym: Imagine someone who was born, went to Google school, worked at Google his whole life, quit Google when they made him kill somebody, and now he's pissed at Google, and has literally, like, never ridden the subway before.

882
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,626
Scott: And his biology has gotten completely fucked up with a bunch of powers, right?

883
00:57:51,987 --> 00:57:59,140
Scott: And it's like, all these, like, first year of this comic, the dude doesn't even get to go back to his apartment for more than five minutes.

884
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:06,852
Scott: And he's getting bounced around all over town by villains, and it's just like, he's on this hell rollercoaster.

885
00:58:06,932 --> 00:58:11,299
Scott: He's a jerk, but he's getting bounced around like this hell rollercoaster of life between different situations.

886
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:17,550
Scott: Like, he can't just, like, you know, take a nap or fucking, you know, stop and eat a sandwich.

887
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:22,580
Scott: Like, he is just, like, everything that's bad is happening to him constantly.

888
00:58:23,181 --> 00:58:25,968
Scott: And, you know, everyone in his life is trying to find him, like, "Where are you?

889
00:58:26,048 --> 00:58:27,151
Scott: I've been trying to call you for

890
00:58:27,191 --> 00:58:27,612
Scott: days.".

891
00:58:27,672 --> 00:58:30,820
Scott: He's like, you know.

892
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:33,640
Rym: Yeah, I'd say it's pretty worth reading.

893
00:58:34,442 --> 00:58:36,918
Scott: Yeah, no good very bad month.

894
00:58:38,841 --> 00:58:48,182
Rym: So, if you want to scratch a Spider-Man itch, and you also want to scratch a cyberpunk itch, you could do a lot worse than Spider-Man 2099.

895
00:58:48,182 --> 00:58:55,597
Scott: You could also, you know, Peter David, who wrote this, is a really good comic writer, so if you like this, you can look up other comics that Peter David has written.

896
00:58:55,617 --> 00:58:56,860
Scott: He is quite good.

897
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,646
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:08,680

907
01:00:04,607 --> 01:00:11,338
Rym: I got a little more jury duty tomorrow, so you won't see a lot of new content from me until maybe the weekend, but I'm working on something.

908
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:12,499
Rym: But anyway, now I leave you with...

909
01:00:13,021 --> 01:00:15,240
Scott: Oh, did you get any cool birthday presents?

910
01:00:16,901 --> 01:00:17,285
Scott: Presents?

911
01:00:18,093 --> 01:00:18,820
Scott: Like Christmas presents?

01:00:19,622 --> 01:00:22,700
Scott: No, just presents, like stuff you want or stuff you need.

913
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:23,841
Rym: No.

914
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,654
Scott: Why would I get presents on my birthday?

915
01:00:28,577 --> 01:00:29,440
Scott: It's like a Christmas thing.

916
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,020
Scott: So what do you do on your birthday?

917
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,162
Scott: Just usual stuff.

918
01:00:35,063 --> 01:00:36,405
Scott: Have cake.

919
01:00:37,026 --> 01:00:38,048
Scott: We had a big steak dinner.

920
01:00:38,148 --> 01:00:39,790
Scott: That was awesome.

921
01:00:40,431 --> 01:00:41,413
Rym: Have a couple people over.

922
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:42,534
Rym: Yeah.

923
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:46,400
Scott: And you get your birthday tickles, of course.

924
01:00:51,563 --> 01:00:52,007
Scott: I'm sorry.

925
01:00:52,914 --> 01:00:55,039
Scott: Your... Your birthday tickles.

926
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:55,865
Scott: Yeah.

927
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:00,320
Scott: Tickles on your birthday.

928
01:01:00,827 --> 01:01:00,999
Rym: Yeah.

929
01:01:09,162 --> 01:01:10,259
Scott: So you're getting tickled?

930
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,259
Scott: No, why would I get tickled?

931
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,819
Scott: Because you just said birthday tickles.

932
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,499
Scott: Yeah, you get to tickle your parents on your birthday.

933
01:01:23,108 --> 01:01:26,740
Scott: So you tickle your... Yeah, like I get to tickle my mom, and then I get to tickle my dad.

934
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,500
Scott: So on their birthdays, you don't buy them a gift?

935
01:01:30,021 --> 01:01:36,180
Scott: No, they get birthday tickles, and my dad gets to tickle me and my mom, and my mom gets to tickle me and my dad.

936
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:38,740
Scott: How long are you tickling each other for?

937
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,500
Scott: Just like a standard amount, like 30 to 45 minutes probably.
