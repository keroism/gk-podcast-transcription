1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,880
Rym: It's Tuesday, December 5th, 2017.

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,402
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:21,070
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight 1846 the race for the Midwest.

4
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:25,418
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:27,545
Rym: So, uh, yeah, we're back.

6
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:29,793
Rym: We actually had some fun times just now.

7
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:34,909
Rym: so I got a brand new opening bit basically in the last episode of GeekNights.

8
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:44,039
Rym: anyone who's watching the live stream might have noticed that After like three chords the show Scott just got really quiet for a while and then he got loud again.

9
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:49,780
Scott: So how come you can't just set up the audio equipment perfectly one time and leave it that way forever?

10
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,684
Scott: Why are you gonna mess with it?

11
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:51,588
Rym: So I didn't mess with it.

12
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:54,702
Rym: It has been the same for years Uh-huh.

13
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,348
Rym: I had not touched it at all.

14
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:56,609
Rym: Uh-huh.

15
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:59,240
Rym: And then after you left I was like, huh, that's weird.

16
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:06,121
Rym: So I corrected it for that because the raw audio goes into like the computer and what's going out to the live stream is actually Something.

17
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:07,246
Rym: it's like a different pipeline.

18
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:08,972
Rym: So they're independent of one another.

19
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:09,755
Rym: Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:09,996 --> 00:01:20,800
Rym: So basically Previously the last time that this happened I identified an XLR cable that was legit bad and I threw it away and I replaced it with a new XLR cable.

21
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:28,940
Rym: It seems like the port Scott was plugged into is also having a problem Mm-hmm as Scott saw me test and go hey something's wrong here.

22
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:31,560
Scott: But you plugged your microphone in port 2 and it looked like it was working.

23
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:39,960
Rym: it was but what you didn't hear because I got these headphones on is There was a really weird crackling sound and I would cut out and get quiet.

24
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,260
Rym: I thought you the crackling was in the compressor area that it was in that compressor pipeline because that's a different pipeline.

25
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:51,278
Rym: So when I monitored that that crackle went away when I removed this port from the equation.

26
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:51,779
Rym: Mm-hmm.

27
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:56,800
Rym: So the plot thickens, but I don't want to replace this mixer because I really like this mixer.

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,286
Rym: So I'm gonna have to investigate that port.

29
00:01:58,507 --> 00:01:59,692
Scott: get your rice krispies outta here.

30
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:04,126
Rym: The thing is remember this mixer is The firewire only one.

31
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:06,374
Rym: so I kind of want to go USB.

32
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:07,438
Scott: no, it's your money's.

33
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,651
Rym: well The thing is I don't want to replace this mixer unless it's dead.

34
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:12,273
Rym: Uh-huh.

35
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:13,858
Rym: So I got four ports.

36
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:14,340
Scott: Rym loves.

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,046
Scott: This is a another situation.

38
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:17,511
Scott: room is gonna break something on purpose.

39
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:21,820
Rym: to feel not bad about buying a new thing I do not want to buy a new mixer.

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,664
Rym: This mix is great.

41
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:26,360
Rym: And actually as far as I can tell all the good mixers are also firewire.

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,887
Rym: So I can't even achieve what I wanted.

43
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:28,429
Scott: Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:30,920
Rym: So we'll see that's neither here nor there.

45
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:32,891
Rym: We'll talk about that more on Monday when I'll figure out.

46
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:34,420
Rym: we'll do a Monday show on QA.

47
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:35,372
Rym: We'll talk about the mark 14 torpedo.

48
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:41,116
Scott: So this is just some tiny gaming news is going down right.

49
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:46,760
Scott: on Thursday the hearthstone expansion comes out and it's gonna have.

50
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:51,680
Scott: You know, I'm not gonna encourage people to go spend their money on digital cards.

51
00:02:51,720 --> 00:03:08,451
Scott: You're better off spending your money on real cards first, right if you're gonna do collectible cards Magic cards, they're adding a single-player Free-to-play mode that is actually has significant play and replay value So and you don't have to pay a single dime for that.

52
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:10,639
Scott: So why not check it out?

53
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,368
Rym: Oh, yeah, if you play hearthstone, I uh Play hearthstone.

54
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:15,294
Scott: It's like you could.

55
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:16,120
Scott: just it has this freeze.

56
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,719
Scott: They're gonna add a free single-player mode that is worth playing and worth, you know, like into play until you get bored of it.

57
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:30,920
Rym: Yeah, I guess I kind of avoided Going down the road of hearthstone because between that and overwatch I can really only have one game that I play every day.

58
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:31,965
Scott: Oh, I mean you only.

59
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:34,860
Scott: I only played every day for like 30 minutes less.

60
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,391
Rym: Yeah, I play overwatch every day for like an hour pretty much.

61
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:38,692
Rym: Yeah.

62
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:40,960
Rym: Anyway, I'm still only like gold here.

63
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:47,460
Scott: So speaking of overwatch your you know We've been waiting for them to actually have this league with teams that are actually located in cities.

64
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:55,880
Scott: So we can have our New York eSports team for finally And I guess tomorrow the jerseys go on sale, so we'll see if they're ugly or not.

65
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:57,206
Scott: I imagine they will be.

66
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:58,995
Rym: it better say New York something's.

67
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:02,699
Scott: yeah, but you know Maybe it'll be good enough to buy but I doubt it.

68
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,574
Scott: But if it is I will but probably won't.

69
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:10,780
Rym: I do Appreciate the fact that the teams have in-game jerseys for all the characters - I think you got to pay for those.

70
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:11,483
Rym: Oh, yeah.

71
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:12,406
Rym: Yeah you but if you're.

72
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:15,620
Rym: but if you're the team you wear your jersey in the game.

73
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:19,899
Scott: Yeah, wouldn't that be weird if you were playing like hockey online and you couldn't wear Rangers Jersey hundred?

74
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:36,114
Rym: or you're watching a real NHL game back in the future when the NHL is replaced by nothing but eSports and like the equivalent of grab nurse Zuccarello is Wearing like a dragon mask and boffer shoes and carrying a broom instead of a hockey stick.

75
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:38,139
Scott: Yeah, let's not go to that world.

76
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:49,160
Rym: There is actually some pretty big news and we're not gonna be able to talk about the full extent of what this means But it's something I want to bring up today.

77
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:53,024
Scott: Yeah, this was this was so awesome when I saw it and I was like, whoa What have I been missing out on?

78
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:57,920
Rym: I'm gonna read the headline on Ars Technica because you get literally summarized as my full sentiment.

79
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:04,960
Rym: Yeah formula one eSports now more exciting than the real thing and that's a problem.

80
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:16,680
Scott: Yeah, so there's always been this formula one racing games even back going back like the Gameboy, but this There's an official f1 game that like is licensed and has all the actual drivers and cars in it.

81
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:22,107
Scott: That's been coming up for quite a few years and I never bought it because every year it would come out and I say Ooh, that looks really cool.

82
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,200
Scott: But how much am I actually gonna play it?

83
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,044
Scott: Yeah, and it's a real expensive.

84
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:29,212
Rym: and also I've played realistic driving simulators before.

85
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:33,420
Rym: I suck ass at the very simulator of how many ways Rym can die, right?

86
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,865
Scott: It's definitely a sim like.

87
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:47,607
Scott: it tries to be super accurate to the real world like you could practice driving with it right if you get a wheel in pedals and Then it would get cheap and I'd be like, ooh, and then the new one would come out like wow I don't want to buy the old one.

88
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:49,980
Scott: Oh, it's only worth it to get the new one, but no one's expenses.

89
00:05:50,100 --> 00:06:05,637
Scott: I never played it, but apparently it's actually an eSport like playing this game and Because it doesn't have any even though it's modeled on the real world formula one It's not constrained by real the real world.

90
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:10,836
Scott: in the same way It's still a simulation and I'm not sure exactly how which parts are accurate and which parts aren't.

91
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:14,634
Scott: but like they had to go in They were playing with realistic damage on.

92
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,539
Scott: I noticed that part.

93
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:20,457
Scott: Yeah But I don't know if like are the cars actually faster than is like hurt you to get in one car.

94
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:21,160
Scott: That's faster?

95
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,083
Scott: Well, here's here's one.

96
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:25,897
Rym: Here's a very interesting example of where this could go.

97
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:35,202
Rym: So One of the most exciting things about Formula One would be the ridiculously dangerous nonsense that they ban because it's too dangerous people to drive Mm-hmm.

98
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:39,160
Rym: with an eSport of Formula One you could bring back ground effect.

99
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,224
Scott: There's no reason to not.

100
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:45,611
Scott: the thing is if you're gonna have an eSport that's a racing game straight up You might as well just have f-zero.

101
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,718
Scott: Why have I have f1?

102
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,940
Rym: Well, so that the here's the interesting like overlap between just go to f-zero.

103
00:06:52,783 --> 00:06:57,700
Rym: Right now f1 as a real physical sport has a lot of like cultural cachet.

104
00:06:57,782 --> 00:07:13,880
Rym: Yeah There's a lot of reasons to be excited about it and to be able to be follow and be interested in it but as a pure spectator The graphics and the way it plays out if you watch someone playing the eSport version It could be an identical experience.

105
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:24,630
Scott: Yeah, watching the eSport f1 was not very different than watching the real one except obviously you can tell it's not the real world Even though it still looks incredible, but it looks pretty close.

106
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,920
Rym: Like if you had not a great TV, they look the same.

107
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,735
Scott: Yes, also, uh, you know, no fuel is being consumed.

108
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:35,106
Scott: There's no environmental damage Okay But it's just a lot shorter.

109
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,217
Scott: They don't run like a you know, 30 whatever 60 laughs.

110
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:39,361
Scott: however many laps it is Right.

111
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:40,164
Scott: It was really quick.

112
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:48,194
Rym: Yeah, but it was also a lot more exciting and part of that It was definitely one of the most exciting f1 races I've seen recently.

113
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:53,060
Rym: the people racing can take The risks that a human might not take in a real race.

114
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:57,880
Rym: They could also have a lot more races because you don't need all this physical infrastructure to make them happen.

115
00:07:58,362 --> 00:07:59,406
Rym: It's a lot more accessible.

116
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:02,939
Rym: you can you can do a lot of stuff to make it interesting.

117
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:16,958
Rym: and the problem part is that For the average consumer like someone who wants to watch f1, but isn't like a hyper purist It's a better experience than literally every way Most people cannot go see f1.

118
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:24,204
Rym: The fact that I have seen f1 races in person is a position of privilege and even then I only saw them because someone else Paid for it.

119
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:26,153
Scott: It's also because it's shorter.

120
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,218
Scott: It's a lot less time-consuming.

121
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,293
Scott: Yeah The length of that race is the amount is like.

122
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:41,955
Scott: I do like f1 But I don't like it enough to wake up early on every Sunday morning and watch a race for hours But I like it enough to watch one of these maybe once a week once a month for 15 20 minutes.

123
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:52,222
Rym: if this continues eSports of Physical car racing that are close enough for the layman are gonna be the kind of thing I would watch.

124
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:57,480
Scott: I mean, I'm gonna go look for like competitive for the Gran Turismo and you know, see what's up with that.

125
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,429
Scott: Right, there must be a scene and it's like.

126
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:01,840
Scott: that's a scene I could spectate and be into if it's good.

127
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:05,351
Scott: But really let's just fast forward and get to f0 already.

128
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:06,575
Rym: Yeah, what's the problem?

129
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:07,418
Scott: What's holding you up?

130
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:20,049
Scott: Make an f0 that controls realistically and is very difficult so that it can become an e-sport But still have loop-de-loops and jumps and ridiculous cars because hey There's no constraints of the real world in there.

131
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,895
Scott: make it go like 10,000 miles an hour.

132
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:22,778
Rym: who gives it stunts 4d.

133
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,615
Rym: That's where we'll get down the road.

134
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:26,784
Rym: Whatever Down the road.

135
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:36,640
Rym: All right, so it'll be a race between this and the other crazy side of that Which is the drone racing of robot cars in the real world controlled by people who are not in them.

136
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:45,319
Scott: Well, let's just fast forward again and have robot AI's controlling e-sport cars But the the the driving point so it becomes a pretty good addition.

137
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,055
Scott: Yeah the dry

138
00:09:46,902 --> 00:10:01,180
Rym: the driving point of all this the thing that you really need to think about let's simmer in your head for like when we talk About this in more depth in the future Is that the only thing that matters for the like future of a sport is the spectator?

139
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,003
Rym: Experience.

140
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:03,533
Rym: is it exciting?

141
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:04,600
Rym: Is it accessible?

142
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,619
Rym: And eSports are already on track to be better than most real sports at both of those things.

143
00:10:13,304 --> 00:10:32,059
Rym: Mmm, that is that is the important part This news is is a very important thing that not a lot of people are talking about The direct competition between traditional sports and eSports and how eSports are well positioned to destroy the former Mm-hmm, and if you think that isn't true as we like to say boxing used to be literally the most popular sport on earth.

144
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:34,420
Rym: Where is it now going?

145
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:42,199
Rym: occasionally on a hockey field Occasionally on the ice Sure, so you got some other news.

146
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,205
Scott: Yeah So it also sports news.

147
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:51,692
Scott: everybody knows that in previous Olympic and other international sporting competitions Russia do some big-time cheating action.

148
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:53,880
Rym: and this isn't just like an individual player cheating.

149
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:57,660
Rym: This is like a speculation like oh that country is cheating.

150
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:10,820
Scott: This was organized like organized across-the-board cheating like almost every Russian athlete was probably Government-assisted big-time doping organized by their you know whatnot, right?

151
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,580
Scott: It was like, you know an epidemic not like oh one individual from your country on their own cheated.

152
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:16,901
Scott: It's like.

153
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:22,860
Scott: no the whole country's sporting organization got together to have a system of cheating in place.

154
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:24,568
Scott: right and they were caught.

155
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:37,035
Scott: they were caught so red-handed and now you know the Winter Olympics are coming up real soon in South Korea and The big news is that Russia is getting penalized and they're getting penalized for this cheating.

156
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:47,106
Scott: a punishment likes the wit and this might be the greatest punishment to a sporting organization in the history of Sports like within the context of sport.

157
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:56,848
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's like it might be like I guess before that maybe Lance Armstrong has always you know the Tour de France is taken away.

158
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:59,280
Scott: This might be a bigger punishment than that.

159
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:05,757
Scott: So what they're doing is all Russian Russia cannot participate in the Olympics period.

160
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,786
Scott: no Russian flags No Russian anthems.

161
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:08,772
Scott: No Russian nothing.

162
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:09,094
Rym: Yep.

163
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:10,120
Rym: They're basically banned.

164
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:23,153
Scott: However, if any athletes from Russia right want to go they can go but of course they have to be Extra-doubly triply quadruply thoroughly vetted to make sure they aren't cheating.

165
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:30,969
Scott: Yep, and if they do participate They're gonna have to wear like boring generic Olympic things.

166
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,600
Rym: they wear the dunce uniform.

167
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:38,080
Scott: They cannot use the Russian flag right like a white like a blank white uniform with Olympic rings on it.

168
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,813
Rym: They don't even get their own national anthem.

169
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:45,803
Scott: No, they get the Olympic anthem, you know That one?

170
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:47,890
Scott: yeah, right they don't get nothing.

171
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:48,391
Scott: nothing.

172
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:53,367
Scott: Russian can be at the Olympics in South Korea Which is really close to Russia geographically.

173
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:53,668
Rym: Yep.

174
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:54,712
Rym: This article says the best.

175
00:12:54,752 --> 00:13:00,232
Rym: the IOC after completing their investigation blah blah blah Handed Russia penal is for doping so severe.

176
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:01,960
Rym: They were without precedent?

177
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:02,764
Scott: No, definitely.

178
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:05,660
Scott: I said with that they've never seen penalties this severe for anyone ever.

179
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:11,643
Rym: This is exactly this is the kind of penalty that I want to see in eSports - yeah, well, yeah Yeah, I want to see.

180
00:13:11,663 --> 00:13:19,575
Scott: you know, if you cheat if you do something wrong if you're harassing people in a game Why shouldn't the penalties be incredibly severe now?

181
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:20,660
Rym: This is breaking news.

182
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:35,640
Scott: We're not talking about like, you know, I'm not someone who's in favor of death penalties or lifetime prison sentences But these are penalties which like they're within the context of a game You can make them as severe as you want and they actually do work as a deterrent because it's within the context of a game.

183
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,090
Scott: So why not make them ridiculously severe?

184
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,460
Rym: but as this is breaking news today?

185
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,679
Rym: We don't know yet how Russia has responded or will respond, right?

186
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,900
Rym: Well, they didn't let their athletes attend, right?

187
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,886
Scott: Is there a boycott?

188
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:48,429
Rym: the Olympics?

189
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,899
Scott: is there gonna be a hockey team?

190
00:13:50,201 --> 00:14:00,336
Scott: That is like the Janeiro Olympic hockey team because the NHL is not going to the Olympics So it's gonna be all junior teams and supposedly KHL people would have gone and dominated.

191
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:01,279
Scott: Are they gonna go?

192
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:16,672
Scott: Mm-hmm, right, so It'll still be great to watch some hockey's though with some swamis and some three gays and some but the two Some Canada's will especially the hockey is some check.

193
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:24,839
Rym: do the hockey kids care so much about hockey that they'll go play just to play even if they don't even get to play under their own flag?

194
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:29,154
Rym: and Secondarily will the Russian government even let them do that?

195
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:36,440
Scott: Mm-hmm, cuz I Especially because there's more to this I think you also need to be invited and you got to pass through the muster that you know.

196
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,540
Scott: If you're from Russia, you're gonna have to pass a lot more qualifications and such than anyone from any other country.

197
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:44,620
Scott: There is even more they'll check your PP every two hours.

198
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,232
Rym: So the investigation cost the IOC over 15 million dollars.

199
00:14:48,593 --> 00:14:55,520
Rym: Russia has to pay all that money before Anyone before they can even have the option of competing not under their own flag.

200
00:14:57,065 --> 00:15:07,046
Rym: So I Suspect that Russia is going to tell them to eat a dick and this is gonna be a really interesting geopolitical situation Which is extra.

201
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:13,939
Rym: It's not really a Tuesday show topic, but considering the current Shall we say troubles between the United States and Russia?

202
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:29,843
Rym: The fact that Russia might end up boycotting current troubles You mean they be almost 50 60 year long 70 year long troubles I guess the re-emergence into the public sphere since the mid 40s troubles the Russia literally Troubles.

203
00:15:29,903 --> 00:15:33,013
Rym: as old as Stalin swung the American election the wrong way.

204
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:34,900
Scott: that are the same troubles.

205
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:43,240
Rym: So I guess I'm gonna get to live through a cold war where Russia boycotts the Olympics already lived through cold war.

206
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:44,505
Scott: We've been living it all lives.

207
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:46,413
Scott: They were born in it and it hasn't ended.

208
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:48,040
Rym: take to boogaloo.

209
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:49,823
Scott: Cool facts.

210
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:54,155
Scott: Ovechkin if he wants to almost definitely won't can go compete for Schweiss.

211
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:57,123
Scott: if he wants to oh, yeah That'd be interesting.

212
00:15:57,444 --> 00:15:58,006
Scott: It won't happen.

213
00:15:58,046 --> 00:15:58,246
Scott: I do.

214
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:01,716
Scott: well, they'll probably just stay and compete for das Kapital.

215
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:05,171
Scott: I feel like Especially like you what I did there.

216
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:06,560
Rym: Yeah, I see what you did there.

217
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:15,237
Rym: I feel like if there are any Russian athletes who could compete under another flag, that would be tantamount to suicide to do so.

218
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,545
Rym: Political also.

219
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,755
Scott: Ovechkin is like super pro-putin.

220
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:20,760
Scott: He's like Putin's biggest fan.

221
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,559
Rym: Well, I either he's pro-putin or it is not safe for him to not be pro-putin.

222
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:27,265
Scott: I mean he could just stay in the u.s.

223
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:28,248
Scott: Isn't the go-dealing.

224
00:16:28,268 --> 00:16:29,612
Rym: Yeah staying in the u.s.

225
00:16:29,652 --> 00:16:31,417
Rym: Man always been safe.

226
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:35,714
Scott: many other Russian athletes in the NHL are not pro-putin.

227
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:36,619
Rym: Yeah, but it's a.

228
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:44,388
Scott: It's a complex situation and also he goes out of his way to be extra pro-putin Just quietly not being anti-feud.

229
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:48,829
Rym: There's a fun little bit at the end of this article - this might be even more interesting down the road.

230
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:57,500
Rym: Quote Tuesday's decision could have consequences for another major sporting event scheduled be held in Russia next year's 11 billion dollar soccer World Cup.

231
00:16:58,562 --> 00:17:01,520
Rym: I like how the article has to specify that the World Cup is soccer.

232
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:04,960
Scott: I mean, I don't think it's an issue because even if the Russians cheat they're not winning the World Cup.

233
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,928
Scott: No, no, no, but they have to.

234
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:10,119
Scott: they have to bribe the refs or something because their reps really control soccer.

235
00:17:10,682 --> 00:17:15,099
Rym: It'd be interesting if the World Cup follows suit and maybe that event moves or changes.

236
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,513
Scott: Well has the as Russian soccer been cheating as much as Russian Olympics are cheating.

237
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:21,339
Rym: I don't know different organization, right?

238
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,670
Scott: You know like you know what not yeah, and I don't know.

239
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,789
Rym: so it'll be interesting to see how this all shakes down because this Is Britain even qualify for the World Cup?

240
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,498
Rym: Well, it's breaking news and it's night in Russia So I don't think there's even gonna be any response until tomorrow.

241
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:37,375
Scott: No, it's gonna be morning there soon.

242
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:39,435
Rym: Yeah We'll see how this goes.

243
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:48,040
Rym: so anyway things of the day.

244
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:54,239
Rym: So I was at the scojo Laura house party that Scott skipped and I played a lot of st Petersburg there.

245
00:17:54,682 --> 00:18:00,568
Rym: But the night before we were doing the thing that members of the front row crew do when it's late at night We're hanging out at someone's house.

246
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:12,560
Rym: We were looking at random YouTube videos Yeah random YouTube videos and we kept seeing this one video recommended and It was like it looked like this guy who had made a lot of chicken fingers.

247
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:20,562
Rym: We don't really think much about it But eventually we clicked on it and the video was from this channel called grandpa kitchen Mm-hmm.

248
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:26,397
Rym: The channel has a lot of videos and some of the other videos involve such things as good at cooking.

249
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:27,762
Rym: making a 1,000 egg curry.

250
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:35,169
Scott: whoa Followed immediately never made curry with any egg.

251
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:40,350
Rym: the next video was a recipe that involved him using 2,000 eggs.

252
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:44,659
Scott: All right Every recipe is 1,000 eggs more than the last one.

253
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,185
Rym: So I'm not gonna.

254
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:48,010
Rym: basically one of them was he just makes pancakes.

255
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:49,254
Rym: Holy shit.

256
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:50,478
Rym: Where those pancakes?

257
00:18:50,518 --> 00:18:51,140
Rym: those look so good.

258
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,150
Rym: The problem was we started watching this video.

259
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,220
Scott: How could I go if he's making something with that many eggs?

260
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,631
Scott: It's got to be enough food to go around.

261
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:57,619
Scott: Can I go eat with grandpa?

262
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,551
Rym: Ah, so these videos are long and we watch many.

263
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:04,780
Rym: we stayed up way late watching these videos to their conclusion.

264
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:13,796
Rym: And I'm gonna warn you right now if you watch this video You're going to be desperate to eat the thing that he made and it's gonna be a problem for you.

265
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:15,060
Rym: and we were in, Pennsylvania.

266
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:20,980
Rym: So there was no way for us to in fact get chicken fingers or pancakes at 3 in the morning.

267
00:19:21,223 --> 00:19:21,931
Scott: No, I can do that.

268
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,559
Scott: I can do that right now.

269
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,820
Rym: So you realize the next morning we all got up early and went to a diner to eat pancakes because otherwise we couldn't made it.

270
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:30,720
Rym: No, so this video I'm gonna link to is the chicken fingers one.

271
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:40,440
Rym: these look like the best chicken fingers anyone's ever made on earth and Grandpa is in India and he cooks these giant meals for orphans.

272
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:54,734
Rym: Oh That's why he's got a thousand eggs and the videos are just very long procedural videos of him cooking in the woods with very simple tools Amazing recipes in quantity and the first half of every video.

273
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:56,660
Scott: Why don't we make grandpa's chicken fingers?

274
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:58,385
Rym: I want to make grandpa's chicken fingers.

275
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,074
Rym: In fact, I plan to make grandpa's chicken fingers.

276
00:20:01,215 --> 00:20:02,800
Rym: Yeah, they look pretty straightforward.

277
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:04,460
Rym: They look so good.

278
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:13,367
Rym: So you watch it make these crazy recipes and then the end of every video is all the orphans Eating the food and it looks fantastic.

279
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:17,360
Rym: This channel is just amazing to watch when you want something kind of chill and low-key.

280
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,436
Rym: It's it's why I think it's just my top ten of favorite things that I've ever found.

281
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:22,140
Scott: that reminds me.

282
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,475
Scott: There's a. there's a I think I've told you before but I don't know the listeners know.

283
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:30,768
Scott: there's a Korean cooking show I watch occasionally called please take care of my Refrigerator and I don't want it.

284
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:45,451
Scott: to explain the entire concept of the show would take a while but basically celebrities bring their actual Refrigerators to the show and a bunch of chefs compete to see which food they can make from the celebrities fridge Right and which and the celebrity decides which one they like most.

285
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:46,835
Rym: it's always celebrity shows up.

286
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,119
Rym: There's just beer and like.

287
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,560
Scott: Sometimes there is but basically it's an excuse to for the celebrity to promote their stuff whatever they're up to.

288
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,840
Scott: Right for that for you to see some cool cooking and also to enjoy a lot of banter between the chefs and the celebrities.

289
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:05,160
Scott: Right, but usually the episodes are split over two weeks.

290
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,980
Scott: They'll have like one recording session with two celebrities.

291
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,880
Scott: It's one celebrities meals get cooked the first episode and then the week later you see the other celebrity right getting cooked for right?

292
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:25,759
Scott: But this week and next week or truly special The it was the first time I've seen a chef not from Korea on the show.

293
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:32,954
Scott: the famous Most maybe most famous chef on earth the Gordon Ramsay appeared on this show.

294
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:35,020
Rym: Ha I should watch that one episode.

295
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,865
Scott: He's gonna cook next week.

296
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:41,217
Scott: He's got 15 minutes to cook something from a celebrity Korean celebrities fridge.

297
00:21:41,438 --> 00:21:42,260
Rym: whose fridge is it?

298
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,343
Scott: I don't know who is it is.

299
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:43,906
Scott: I didn't watch.

300
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:45,974
Scott: Okay, but I just I'm gonna watch.

301
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:47,180
Scott: so oh man.

302
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:50,820
Rym: So the only other thing about this videos is want to point out that's cool.

303
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,739
Rym: Is that he makes these giant recipes with a very simple and limited set of tools?

304
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,779
Rym: Mm-hmm, and that is part of why it's so fascinating to watch the entire thing.

305
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:02,751
Scott: Anyway, so my actual thing of the day.

306
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:19,610
Scott: another excellent Craftsman, I guess you could say artisan artisan here is a man who is I guess his job is exterminator and He is called in for this hornet's nest in someone's shed and the hornet's nest is like engulfed.

307
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:24,835
Scott: You know many things in the shed like this is some Right here.

308
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:31,830
Scott: Yeah, it's a huge ass hornet's nest and he removes it with the greatest of ease without getting stung even once.

309
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,856
Rym: Well, he's basically wearing like armor.

310
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:36,184
Scott: Yeah, but you got to check out this hornet's nest.

311
00:22:36,204 --> 00:22:42,777
Scott: Yeah, he's got basically got a GoPro with him I assume as a GoPro while he's a De-nesting the shed.

312
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:47,190
Rym: I'm gonna say if one how did these people let their shed get to this state?

313
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:54,490
Scott: I don't know, but it's also kind of awesome because when he rips the hive out of there You can see all the queens at the bottom and stuff and it's like oh man.

314
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:57,041
Scott: But if I were them, it's like a whole bunch of queens.

315
00:22:57,081 --> 00:22:58,990
Rym: I would just burn the shed down and start over.

316
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,675
Scott: Well, but this guy got their stuff in there.

317
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:02,020
Rym: Yeah a bunch of garbage.

318
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,345
Scott: basketball their lawnmower.

319
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:04,910
Rym: They got this faded-ass basketball.

320
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:12,019
Rym: They got this pile of what looks like all their garden tools, you know Just it's a shed filled with mostly garbage.

321
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,404
Rym: and look look at the super soaker.

322
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:15,210
Rym: That looks like a vintage super soaker.

323
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,933
Scott: Oh, man, I want it.

324
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:18,524
Rym: I don't think I think it's off-brand actually.

325
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:19,066
Rym: Yeah, it's.

326
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:20,070
Scott: the colors are backwards.

327
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,040
Rym: Yeah, that's not a super circuit 50.

328
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,629
Scott: Anyway, this is the video still awesome.

329
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:27,927
Rym: So in the meta moment, it is the calm before the storm.

330
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:35,446
Rym: We are home Just you know making GeekNights stuff, but coming up real soon is both mag fest and packs.

331
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:38,296
Rym: a PAX South Mm-hmm not PAX Unplugged.

332
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,461
Rym: We're just at PAX Unplugged.

333
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:44,170
Rym: also New Year's and Holidays, there's gonna be a lot of biz in January.

334
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:48,929
Rym: So if you are at PAX South one, it's a full-on packs and it's one of our favorite paxes.

335
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:50,819
Rym: It's more fun than PAX East.

336
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:51,562
Rym: I'm just gonna say it.

337
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:57,865
Rym: I'm sorry PAX East is true And we're gonna be there on Friday for that's just like saying well Platinum's worth more than gold.

338
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:01,084
Scott: Yeah, I ain't scoffing at gold I just I like platinum more.

339
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,197
Rym: Yeah Got some electrum.

340
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,423
Rym: That's that's packs.

341
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,689
Rym: So pack sauce is the electrum.

342
00:24:06,934 --> 00:24:08,539
Rym: So we're gonna be there at 4 p.m.

343
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:11,690
Rym: Doing a brand new panel a Scott panel balance in game design.

344
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,759
Rym: It's looking pretty good like 30% done.

345
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,450
Rym: Yep At MAGFest, we're gonna be doing a bunch of panels.

346
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:25,965
Rym: We're doing probably three with the mages one of which is a different version of this balance panel where we might have dr Pat hazard honors someone of his caliber with us.

347
00:24:25,985 --> 00:24:26,910
Scott: What else do I have to do there?

348
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,481
Scott: What else is gonna pull me away from my dig dug machine?

349
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:31,168
Rym: I forget what panels I put in.

350
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:32,954
Rym: I gotta go I'm also.

351
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,240
Rym: I put in a brand new one.

352
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,209
Rym: Not a mages panel, but a regular panel.

353
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:41,450
Scott: Top 40 tabletop games you should play and you're gonna come up with this list on your own.

354
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,610
Scott: I already started writing it because I saw make a Google Doc so I can edit your incorrect list.

355
00:24:45,911 --> 00:24:51,689
Rym: Ah, so I saw someone else do a similar talk about games as a whole and the angle wasn't the best.

356
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:52,713
Rym: 40.

357
00:24:52,713 --> 00:24:55,207
Rym: The angle is also not the most important.

358
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:56,393
Rym: 40.

359
00:24:56,393 --> 00:24:57,297
Scott: Cover all the bases.

360
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:58,140
Rym: 40 it's.

361
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:04,928
Rym: if you've played these 40 tabletop games You will be a player of games and have gnosis about tabletop gaming.

362
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:05,430
Scott: That's right.

363
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,708
Scott: so if there's even a game like pandemic will make that list and you basically you look at a category.

364
00:25:09,728 --> 00:25:18,862
Scott: you look at every Category of games right the 40 most important types of game and you pick the iconic game from each of those guys Not the first one not the best one.

365
00:25:18,882 --> 00:25:20,110
Rym: I don't illustrate.

366
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:32,170
Scott: I don't like co-op solitaire pretend garbo garbo games But you must play one of them to understand them and pandemic is the one Yep, and you have to play Hanabi to understand why that was a garbo Yep.

367
00:25:32,371 --> 00:25:39,757
Rym: and if basically I want to try this panel out at magfest and then we'll probably tweak the list and I think we're gonna do It at paxies like legit.

368
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:40,982
Rym: That's my plan.

369
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:49,810
Rym: Yeah, that's a cool one and I'm doing Magfest has a Saturday morning cartoons panel block where they do a bunch of this fun Saturday morning cartoon type stuff.

370
00:25:50,313 --> 00:25:52,185
Rym: So I'm gonna do the anime openers thing at 8 a.m.

371
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:52,789
Rym: On Saturday.

372
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:54,431
Rym: Cuz.

373
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:56,057
Rym: apparently there's a big crowd of people.

374
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,642
Scott: look at the free badge.

375
00:25:57,703 --> 00:25:59,027
Scott: cuz I'm paying for one.

376
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:01,198
Scott: Yeah And I didn't pay for one.

377
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:03,960
Scott: It would be sad if I showed up and couldn't get in I would make.

378
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,720
Rym: this is one of the rare cons I would pay to go to if I were not a guest.

379
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:10,632
Scott: I might but I just want to make sure I'm doing My.

380
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:11,134
Rym: are you kidding?

381
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:13,283
Rym: You would skip magfest for the like.

382
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:14,469
Rym: how much does the badge even cost?

383
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:14,750
Rym: 50 bucks?

384
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,610
Scott: I don't know, but I'm just saying I also know for the free badge, right?

385
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,403
Scott: Cuz I don't have to fill any other forms or anything.

386
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:20,270
Rym: I don't believe so.

387
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,990
Rym: We should just be some follow-up link or something should be fine.

388
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:29,306
Rym: I just want to confirm it because times getting the consternation right now is making sure all the panelists have hotel rooms We don't need to worry about because we just get our own.

389
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:30,252
Rym: That's right I don't get.

390
00:26:30,353 --> 00:26:33,186
Rym: I don't try to get into like the weird hotel room.

391
00:26:33,206 --> 00:26:37,690
Rym: We don't got our thing Nope, so yeah, we will be at packs on pec south now PAX Unplugged.

392
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,466
Rym: We were there and mag fest and pax East is like not too long after that.

393
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:43,690
Rym: We will be there two months.

394
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:52,762
Rym: so if you had to Describe a game that most people would assume that Rym and Scott would have no interest in 1846 should be near the top of that list.

395
00:26:52,883 --> 00:26:54,793
Scott: No, I mean, it's not a game We have no interest in.

396
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:57,523
Scott: it's one of those like stereotypical games.

397
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:59,570
Scott: We sort of always jokingly referred to right?

398
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:06,848
Scott: It's like we laugh about like aha train game that uses crayons or grog nard war game or train game Where you only take four turns?

399
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:17,149
Scott: Yeah, this is this is a you know It's stereotypical grog nard train game that we sort of you know The kind that you see in the game store and you look at and you go I know that kind of game and then you don't ever play it.

400
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:22,150
Rym: You very rarely see people playing these kinds of games and when you do they tend to fit certain stereotypes.

401
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:24,981
Rym: Yes games tend to take a very long time.

402
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:32,186
Rym: The games tend to be more Simulatory than the sort of elegant machine building type games.

403
00:27:32,227 --> 00:27:43,566
Rym: We tend to prefer They tend to be more experiences where you explore a set of complex mechanics Rather than a game where you read the rules and already have a pretty good heuristic about what to do.

404
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:51,229
Scott: They also Accurately represent true historical events at least related to trains in this case so that you can you know learn.

405
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:57,770
Scott: So someone who's a nerd about old trains would like get jollies playing this game right regardless of the winning and losing factor.

406
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:05,417
Rym: now What's funny is that even games like not age of steam but railroad tycoon like the baby version That game all the cars.

407
00:28:05,437 --> 00:28:12,587
Rym: when you buy trains they have that numerical like 422 like this is a 422 train and because of that I actually know what that means.

408
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:13,370
Scott: I don't know what that means.

409
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:17,645
Rym: It's those guide wheels versus drive wheels versus those trailing wheels.

410
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:18,970
Rym: how many of each there are?

411
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,858
Scott: Okay, and I mean only on the locomotive.

412
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:24,047
Scott: that all the cars but yeah the locomotive itself.

413
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:27,984
Rym: Yeah, but 1846 has that amped up to 11.

414
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:28,185
Rym: Mm-hmm.

415
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:30,860
Rym: So this game was presented.

416
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,730
Rym: basically our friends Chris and Anthony like this game.

417
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:40,197
Scott: They played it and well, there's a whole series of 18xx games that are all train games from different Geographies and areas.

418
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:41,321
Scott: like is mostly in the u.s.

419
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:43,530
Scott: But I assume they've also got euro rails and stuff like that.

420
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:53,432
Scott: but you know that are you know, so this one is about the Midwest and of course the year 1846 like what was happening with train companies there and then yep And apparently the.

421
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:56,963
Rym: I have not looked at these other games, but I've learned a little bit about them.

422
00:28:57,465 --> 00:29:11,570
Rym: all the other 18 Dot-dot games are very similar but have like soul crushingly Esoteric differences or like very specific nuances that make them completely different game, right?

423
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:19,250
Scott: So it's like you could learn one and then easily learn to play another one in a short amount of time Once you've learned one, but there will be significant differences.

424
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,279
Scott: You'll probably not win because you like you'll mess those up right because.

425
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:29,410
Scott: but I guess if you're super studied on train history Maybe you'll just anticipate those differences because they match real-world event.

426
00:29:29,452 --> 00:29:35,466
Rym: Yeah like you might know about One of the like small railroads like it like the Erie line or something and what happened to it.

427
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:41,610
Scott: and then you when you see What happens to in the game like oh it makes perfect sense Cuz actually there is this this line that used to go around Lake Erie.

428
00:29:42,012 --> 00:29:44,910
Rym: It's not in this game, but it is a train line.

429
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,297
Rym: I know a lot about what.

430
00:29:46,337 --> 00:29:48,286
Scott: was it there in 1846 or before then or after then?

431
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,096
Rym: Uh, I think it was around.

432
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:51,939
Rym: it was around before then.

433
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,481
Rym: Definitely.

434
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:53,907
Rym: It just does not play in the 1846 game.

435
00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:00,850
Rym: I think it's heyday was earlier, but I know stuff about it because it's intrinsically tied to the history of Cedar Point anyway.

436
00:30:02,072 --> 00:30:11,664
Rym: So yeah, but the other interesting thing about this game like the the the core point I want to get out in the review before getting the details is that We both enjoy it.

437
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:23,410
Rym: Mm-hmm And I did not expect to feel the desire to not only play it but to play it again And having played it twice to actually really want to play it a third time.

438
00:30:23,652 --> 00:30:27,110
Scott: Well, here's the thing is like I don't Super want to play it, right?

439
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:33,737
Scott: But it's like I totally will play it and it's sort of on this borderline where it's like it's got a lot of action Right.

440
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,589
Scott: One thing I really like about it Is that even if you're losing and getting your ass kicked like you still do stuff.

441
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:40,335
Rym: There is an exception to that.

442
00:30:40,495 --> 00:30:50,269
Rym: Amanda got into a specific situation where she was pushed to bankruptcy by Nonsense and literally could not do anything meaningful for many turns in a row.

443
00:30:50,873 --> 00:30:52,220
Scott: But it's really hard to not do.

444
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,522
Scott: it was.

445
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:57,290
Rym: it was such a like crazy Situation a turn of events that happened that she had no control over.

446
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:03,017
Scott: It's also like a lot is a lot of even though the rules are sort of esoteric There's a lot of flexibility and what you can do.

447
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:07,151
Scott: and yeah terms of like stock trading and train building and train buying it's like.

448
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:18,911
Rym: so there's a bunch of very fiddly specific arbitrary seeming exceptions to general rules, but they are To do.

449
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:27,069
Rym: then the games are I would complain about that like there's limits on how many stock certificates you can own But that doesn't really come into play until the very end of the game.

450
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:33,769
Rym: So even though that is an arbitrary distinction It is not something that I bumped into in the course of natural play anyway.

451
00:31:34,111 --> 00:31:37,806
Scott: So the main thing is like the game takes a little while to play.

452
00:31:37,826 --> 00:31:38,750
Scott: it takes a few hours.

453
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:42,710
Scott: Yeah, you can play fast if you've got skills and help and experience.

454
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:48,704
Scott: But it still takes a while no matter what the game is sort of on this border Between where it takes too long.

455
00:31:48,744 --> 00:31:49,549
Scott: It's not worth it.

456
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:51,839
Scott: If it was shorter, it would be like the best game ever.

457
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,376
Scott: but it's not so long like Monopoly long You want to kill yourself?

458
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:56,040
Scott: It's like, okay.

459
00:31:56,462 --> 00:31:57,630
Scott: I put the time aside.

460
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:02,605
Scott: It's still and unlike say Eclipse where there's a lot of time sitting doing nothing.

461
00:32:02,885 --> 00:32:06,758
Scott: You're doing stuff the whole time You don't you know, I haven't gotten bored and distracted.

462
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:15,797
Scott: usually when there's an Eclipse playing Eclipse takes as long or longer But I'll spend a lot of time during an Eclipse game sitting around being bored Waiting for my turn in this.

463
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:18,486
Scott: that's almost never happens, right either either.

464
00:32:18,506 --> 00:32:26,165
Rym: while I'm waiting for my turn I'm thinking about like Stock value and like could I pull this off over the next few turns and wonder what Scott's gonna do?

465
00:32:26,506 --> 00:32:29,256
Rym: or I'm watching some drama Unfold in the stock market.

466
00:32:29,377 --> 00:32:32,290
Scott: Yeah, and you can only do a very small number of things on your turn.

467
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:38,050
Scott: So the the rounds go around very quickly and then everyone sort of calculates simultaneously.

468
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:45,150
Scott: Yeah, so without that downtime like you're into it for those hours You're actually probably in sort of play per time.

469
00:32:45,232 --> 00:32:57,584
Scott: It's very efficient right whereas Eclipse if you actually you know how like they talk about if you took an NFL game and cut out all the commercials the game is only like 20 minutes of real time or something like that of Actual playing from like start of plays to end of plays.

470
00:32:57,985 --> 00:33:00,762
Scott: this game is like no It's actually four hours long.

471
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:01,850
Scott: and use the whole four hours.

472
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:08,322
Scott: Eclipse is like five hours long but you actually you're only using like one hour of your own time and four hours of waiting.

473
00:33:08,563 --> 00:33:18,990
Rym: but it is also interesting how such a Sort of diversion and simulatory experience is crafted from a relatively small set of relatively elegant mechanics.

474
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:19,856
Scott: Yeah, no, there's not.

475
00:33:20,037 --> 00:33:22,930
Scott: actually it's like it looks complicated It feels complicated.

476
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:34,762
Scott: but if you were to say Redraw this game or read graphically design it to remove all the history stuff and the reality stuff and I would not be interested Mate, well, yeah, but make the symbology, you know more.

477
00:33:35,123 --> 00:33:36,930
Rym: Oh, I see where you're going on this, right?

478
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:40,629
Scott: You would see the game actually isn't really as complicated as it appears.

479
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:41,672
Scott: Yeah it is.

480
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:43,177
Scott: it is actually not.

481
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:51,050
Scott: it's like oh you have a round where you do stock stuff and Then you do have two rounds of not of playing the game and then you do stock stuff again.

482
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:53,699
Rym: But what's also interesting is stock market play.

483
00:33:53,759 --> 00:34:05,297
Rym: play stock market games you go around and around like this that are reasonably Simulatory like that kind of game style the fact that it has so much history steeped into it like the proper nouns and all Those like other train companies.

484
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:10,907
Rym: it actually helps you build Pretty reasonably good directional heuristics.

485
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:26,530
Rym: Yeah Yeah based on just associating the fiction of the game with the mechanics like the combinations of some of those like independent railroads and Certain things you might want to do in a region is very intuitive like it would be in the real world.

486
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:40,243
Rym: So the only real problem I have with this game before we get into like explaining how it actually works Is that so there's a concept in that book characteristics of games on Called busy work like games that have busy work like this

487
00:34:40,263 --> 00:34:41,850
Scott: does have one busy work in it.

488
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:50,478
Rym: But I'm gonna go one step further and there's I think I want to make a distinction I've been using this word a lot lately in game reviews between Pure busy work and what I like to call rituals.

489
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,505
Rym: This game has a lot of rituals.

490
00:34:52,567 --> 00:35:06,896
Rym: rituals are fine meaning but meaning that they are things that are moderately complex to do need to be done for the game to continue But they can be basically Entirely removed from your like.

491
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:11,710
Rym: you don't need to know them to play as long as at least one person playing knows them.

492
00:35:12,051 --> 00:35:12,473
Scott: I think it was.

493
00:35:12,594 --> 00:35:16,732
Scott: I think it's basically there's a bunch of stuff that a computer could do and then the game would take a Little hands.

494
00:35:17,054 --> 00:35:24,509
Rym: Chris had that spreadsheet that we use for the dividends and all that crap Mm-hmm, and if you don't have that spreadsheet it takes longer to figure that out.

495
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:30,678
Rym: so there and there is a ritual of moving the stock stuff up and down and Figuring out the numbers on the dividend.

496
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:32,045
Scott: Yeah, this one makes a triple jump.

497
00:35:32,085 --> 00:35:33,130
Scott: That one makes a double jump.

498
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,970
Scott: Yeah, I didn't need to know.

499
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:39,550
Scott: I mean, I guess I would have helped me have better direction or his sticks if I did fully understand that.

500
00:35:39,892 --> 00:35:41,584
Rym: But I thought you don't need to fully understand.

501
00:35:41,604 --> 00:35:42,148
Rym: Yeah, I didn't play.

502
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:43,133
Scott: well I didn't need to.

503
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:43,354
Scott: I was.

504
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:48,417
Scott: I was able to play well enough without knowing the exact Excruciating details.

505
00:35:48,658 --> 00:35:53,650
Scott: but because the board game someone has to know them But only one person needs to know them and sort of be the computer.

506
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,494
Rym: So that's my difference.

507
00:35:54,554 --> 00:35:57,810
Rym: busy work is things that are generally equally spread among the players.

508
00:35:58,011 --> 00:36:03,330
Scott: Imagine if you were playing civilization the video game on a tabletop, but the rules are not changed at all.

509
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,361
Scott: You have to be like, okay this city produces this much food this turn.

510
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,990
Scott: Okay, it has enough food for population to increase.

511
00:36:09,116 --> 00:36:12,303
Scott: Yeah Which means this much food gets eaten and this much surplus food is left over.

512
00:36:12,323 --> 00:36:17,745
Scott: and it's like a thing that when you play the Video game the computer just does for you, but because you're playing a board game here.

513
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:19,030
Scott: You have to do that yourself.

514
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:19,872
Scott: Yeah You are.

515
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:27,738
Rym: you can choose to zoom in and pay attention to the specific math if you want to but you don't need to for Just need to know generally.

516
00:36:27,758 --> 00:36:29,406
Scott: I want my population to go up.

517
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:30,190
Scott: I need more food.

518
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:41,624
Rym: so in this game the ritual is that as long as only as long as one person can Facilitate all the details which Chris did for us then I probably couldn't play it.

519
00:36:41,885 --> 00:36:54,910
Rym: Yeah, the game is way more fun and That's why I'd be very interested in a well-made computer version of this game because the only other thing that has significant Ritualistic well, this one actually is busy work as well as that's dude on their own.

520
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,613
Scott: This is the busier.

521
00:36:55,653 --> 00:36:59,250
Rym: guys are calculate the optimal set of routes to run your trains on right?

522
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,194
Scott: So here's how this works.

523
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:01,822
Scott: is your each train company.

524
00:37:01,842 --> 00:37:03,450
Rym: Yeah, let's talk about how the game actually plays.

525
00:37:03,851 --> 00:37:04,895
Scott: You have a train company.

526
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:06,159
Rym: Well, no, you don't.

527
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:08,707
Rym: you found a train company.

528
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:09,168
Rym: Yes.

529
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:11,889
Scott: Sure Whatever and you might have more than one.

530
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:13,159
Scott: There's the tree.

531
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,973
Rym: one might steal it from you Whatever.

532
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:18,130
Scott: the train companies have money and trains and stocks.

533
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:22,282
Scott: You as an individual person also have monies and trains and stocks.

534
00:37:22,362 --> 00:37:29,910
Scott: right and whoever has enough stock in a company Controls that company, but obviously someone could buy all the stock and take the company.

535
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,183
Scott: Yeah, there's companies that don't exist yet in the game.

536
00:37:32,244 --> 00:37:37,565
Scott: ever at the beginning of the game Everyone buys one company or founds one, but there's some unfounded ones.

537
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:38,549
Scott: You can always pick those up.

538
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:38,970
Scott: mid game.

539
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,395
Rym: You might found a second one.

540
00:37:40,415 --> 00:37:41,679
Rym: You can have two different drink company.

541
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:55,009
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, but anyway, there's the independent drink When it's your turn when you operate you operate the companies that you control because you have enough stock in them that you're the president and You you you are the boss of that company.

542
00:37:55,029 --> 00:37:56,193
Rym: now This is where it gets fascinating.

543
00:37:56,234 --> 00:38:00,810
Rym: The goal of the game is for you the player to have the most money at the end.

544
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:06,265
Rym: Yep, but your money is entirely distinct from the company's money.

545
00:38:06,425 --> 00:38:06,605
Rym: Mm-hmm.

546
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:08,270
Rym: That is the interesting thing.

547
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:13,070
Rym: So when you operate a train company you spend the train company's money.

548
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:21,699
Scott: Yeah, you can't use your personal money to buy a train for the train company But you can order stock in a train company And that money goes to the train company.

549
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:24,350
Scott: if the company still owns some of its own stock.

550
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:33,870
Scott: You could buy stock from the company does to move your money in and the stock out and then when the train company Gets revenues those monies go to the shareholders.

551
00:38:34,031 --> 00:38:41,916
Scott: So if you own shares in a company or your opponent's companies when that train company operates and brings in revenue You would get some of that money.

552
00:38:41,997 --> 00:38:45,610
Scott: but the train company still owns some of its own shares.

553
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,480
Scott: That's how it gets more money.

554
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:56,990
Scott: if a train company lose all of its shares It can't really make any more money and it has to continue to operate without any revenues because shareholders are taking all the revenue.

555
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:04,696
Rym: Yep Now the other interesting thing is that the train companies they can invest in their own infrastructure Which basically just means buying trains.

556
00:39:04,997 --> 00:39:08,990
Rym: Yep, and they can invest in shared track infrastructure.

557
00:39:09,211 --> 00:39:10,720
Rym: Literally anyone can use.

558
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,831
Scott: this is the most interesting part of the game Right?

559
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:18,150
Scott: is that in most train games like in rare or tycoon you're moving cubes around and stuff like that, right?

560
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,490
Scott: That's not what's going on here.

561
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:23,370
Scott: Right what happens here is on a train company's tournament operates.

562
00:39:23,751 --> 00:39:28,609
Scott: It can basically like do only a little bit very limited how much track they can lay out.

563
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,341
Scott: They could like what do one upgrade in one piece of track?

564
00:39:31,462 --> 00:39:33,270
Scott: Yep, pretty much or two pieces of track.

565
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,739
Scott: I think it's not two upgrades.

566
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:36,390
Rym: No, I messed that up like twice.

567
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:41,163
Scott: Yeah, so you can only lay out a little bit of track and what you want.

568
00:39:41,203 --> 00:39:43,810
Scott: and the thing is the tracks belong to everybody.

569
00:39:44,013 --> 00:39:50,410
Scott: There's no owner of track It's just you're upgrading the tracks around the country or the city where the train station is.

570
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:54,003
Rym: If you upgrade Centralia and have a better train station, that's great for everybody.

571
00:39:54,203 --> 00:39:56,010
Scott: and now the train company has stations.

572
00:39:56,851 --> 00:40:02,389
Scott: And if all the stations in a city are blocked up, well, then someone else can't run their trains past it.

573
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:13,310
Scott: But as long as they basically your trains start from one of your stations and then they run Where as long as it's not blocked pretty much to wherever they're gonna make the most money.

574
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:19,390
Scott: And so this is the busy work part is basically you say well this train company has these two trains.

575
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:21,661
Scott: These two trains can drive this far.

576
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:23,249
Scott: Here's where my stations are.

577
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:27,664
Scott: What are the routes that will make the most money for these two trains?

578
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:29,410
Rym: and this is where a video game you could literally hit?

579
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,397
Rym: And it would tell you the maximum run.

580
00:40:31,518 --> 00:40:34,750
Scott: yeah, it's not like a decision it's just like what's the answer?

581
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,764
Scott: You're trying to look at the board and figure out like how much money.

582
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:43,670
Scott: it's like you audio The rule is you make the maximum, but it's like what is the maximum you had to some?

583
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:52,610
Rym: It's like a little and you might choose to make less but and there are situations where that might make sense Yeah, sure, but yeah, you make the maximum.

584
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,850
Scott: Yeah, pretty much you might fail to figure out the maximum because it's trying to hard to figure out.

585
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,522
Scott: Well, I can use all the tracks on the board.

586
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,650
Scott: What is the best route?

587
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,970
Scott: Well, I guess it's these four stations and you most of the time you get it, right?

588
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:04,933
Scott: But it's like annoying.

589
00:41:04,953 --> 00:41:09,430
Scott: I if you played in a computer the computer could just be like your revenue is X done.

590
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:12,570
Scott: It would take a fraction of a second part of my brain.

591
00:41:13,193 --> 00:41:16,389
Rym: It's kind of fun until the map gets really complex toward the end.

592
00:41:16,771 --> 00:41:19,829
Scott: Yeah, and the early game is very obvious because you've only got like two stations like.

593
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:21,577
Scott: well Yeah, it's these two stations.

594
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:23,847
Scott: I get 80 bucks, but later in the game.

595
00:41:23,907 --> 00:41:26,449
Scott: It's like oh, no I can get ten more dollars if I go this way.

596
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:33,293
Scott: Alright, and the other thing is that your your trains cannot share Track.

597
00:41:33,635 --> 00:41:42,419
Scott: they can't like bump into each other like each track Route or each hex edge can only be used once for you for you But someone else can use those hex edges.

598
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:42,781
Scott: just not.

599
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:44,430
Scott: you can't use your own hex edge twice.

600
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,754
Scott: We have more than one train.

601
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:50,548
Rym: So yeah, and there's all these other mechanics like so you can buy.

602
00:41:50,568 --> 00:42:04,410
Rym: at the beginning of the game There's this whole draft where you can buy Independent companies that do different things up to and including Entire small independent railroads that run like a real company and eventually get brought into the big railroad.

603
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:10,370
Rym: But you the player buy them with your own money, but then maybe you sell them to one of your train companies.

604
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:12,335
Rym: But the game ends.

605
00:42:12,576 --> 00:42:14,080
Rym: there's a there's an amount of money.

606
00:42:14,582 --> 00:42:20,796
Rym: when that amount of money is taken from the bank then You the game ends.

607
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:24,347
Scott: imagine playing Monopoly and the bank has ten thousand dollars in.

608
00:42:24,407 --> 00:42:25,170
Scott: I'm just making up a number.

609
00:42:25,216 --> 00:42:27,158
Rym: Yeah Once that number was like it's zero right.

610
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:31,155
Scott: and once the ten thousand dollars in the bank is completely gone The bank has zero left.

611
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:35,356
Scott: you keep giving people money for that round until everyone has the amount of money They're supposed to have.

612
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:37,090
Scott: yep, and then whoever has the most wins.

613
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:49,890
Rym: So when that happens then the the winner is whoever themselves not their companies Just themselves has the most money between their money and the actual value of the stock they own.

614
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,272
Scott: That's it.

615
00:42:51,513 --> 00:42:54,543
Scott: Yeah, so this game has like the the interesting parts of the game.

616
00:42:54,623 --> 00:42:58,630
Scott: right you know the the large macro strategy parts is.

617
00:42:58,892 --> 00:43:10,114
Scott: The big one is the buying of trains Because the trains go out of style and they become obsolete and if the train company can't afford to buy new or better trains They're just done They're screwed right.

618
00:43:10,496 --> 00:43:22,349
Scott: so you have to basically acquire get a big pile of money in the train company So that the train company can buy a larger better superior train like two or three times during the game.

619
00:43:23,132 --> 00:43:29,629
Scott: What happens almost immediately then is the next one is a little hard and the final one is super hard And you can get into situations where?

620
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:35,510
Rym: Older trains become like obsolete and run a little bit, and then they're just like literally work.

621
00:43:36,233 --> 00:43:38,882
Scott: Those trains get like one last run, and then they're out.

622
00:43:39,143 --> 00:43:48,131
Scott: you better have the new train lined up And it's like you have to make your trains Companies profitable enough that they can keep upgrading the trains and get that final up And you have

623
00:43:48,151 --> 00:43:52,390
Rym: to manage how much of the stock you like you buy for someone should leave in the company.

624
00:43:52,682 --> 00:44:01,590
Scott: Yeah If you leave too many shares in the company Then you're sort of losing out on money and also leaving those stocks available to like be bought up by other people.

625
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:05,970
Rym: But you're letting the company profit from its own work instead of extracting that wealth early.

626
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:10,130
Scott: Yeah, but if you buy the shares - you know you got to buy.

627
00:44:10,271 --> 00:44:13,129
Scott: It's like you got to buy them, but you don't want to buy them too early on buying too late.

628
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,661
Scott: But you know shares in other people's company.

629
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:16,986
Rym: Yeah, which is crucial.

630
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,152
Scott: so like yeah It's like.

631
00:44:18,192 --> 00:44:20,424
Scott: well Rym's train company is better than mine.

632
00:44:20,464 --> 00:44:21,410
Scott: doesn't mean I'm gonna lose.

633
00:44:22,073 --> 00:44:25,307
Scott: You know I could maybe buy all his shares out right now his train company doesn't.

634
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:28,968
Rym: it's interesting How accurate to the time the corporate stuff is yeah?

635
00:44:29,912 --> 00:44:34,030
Rym: You literally you're trying to extract as much wealth from the system as possible.

636
00:44:34,311 --> 00:44:36,320
Rym: You don't give a fuck about the train company.

637
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:36,742
Scott: It doesn't?

638
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:38,610
Scott: your train company has to be the best one.

639
00:44:39,152 --> 00:44:39,474
Scott: You know.

640
00:44:39,615 --> 00:44:48,338
Scott: the strategy I saw Chris use a lot was have one train company Run it into the ground then have a second one that comes in later And that one runs to the end game.

641
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:53,739
Rym: because when you find a train company you do an IPO And you can pick the value of your stock right.

642
00:44:53,759 --> 00:45:02,888
Scott: so it's like he makes a bunch of early game money by running one train Company in the ground uses that on a second train company that now has a bunch of money in its coffers So it can buy the better train.

643
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:11,030
Rym: Anyway, so the get in terms of play and the way it feels you're using more real-world fuzzy heuristics.

644
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:13,922
Scott: Also when that second train company comes in doesn't really need to buy tracks.

645
00:45:13,942 --> 00:45:15,710
Scott: There's already tracks everywhere exactly.

646
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:26,674
Rym: but you sort of have to just play it and Explore these mechanics kind of bounce off of them like if you play this game with anyone who's played it before You'll have fun.

647
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:27,698
Rym: You'll lose.

648
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:37,129
Scott: Yeah, that's I think that's the one best thing I can say about this game Even though it is a competitive skill game and also has this historical element and a thematic element, right?

649
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,185
Scott: You know it takes a while never been upset by losing or winning at this game.

650
00:45:42,286 --> 00:45:43,330
Rym: Yeah, it's an experience.

651
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,092
Scott: It's just like.

652
00:45:44,233 --> 00:45:51,077
Scott: it's just like oh you get to have a bunch of fun times playing trains running trains buying and selling stocks And like it feels good.

653
00:45:51,097 --> 00:45:54,290
Scott: It doesn't feel like some roll and move garbage like Monopoly.

654
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,275
Scott: It's all decisions.

655
00:45:55,316 --> 00:45:56,180
Scott: This is not like.

656
00:45:56,241 --> 00:45:57,588
Scott: what luck is there in this game?

657
00:45:57,729 --> 00:45:57,970
Scott: Nothing.

658
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:02,121
Scott: Is there any luck at all in this guy just the initial drafting?

659
00:46:02,141 --> 00:46:06,234
Scott: Yeah, I don't think there's not a. there's not a deck There's not a dice roll.

660
00:46:06,254 --> 00:46:06,957
Scott: There's not a nothing.

661
00:46:07,258 --> 00:46:10,130
Scott: Yep, right and it just feels way good the whole time.

662
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:10,943
Scott: So you don't really.

663
00:46:10,964 --> 00:46:17,690
Scott: you know You don't get too upset and even though I don't think I don't think I've ever won I've always had done well enough had like a bunch of monies.

664
00:46:17,831 --> 00:46:20,630
Scott: It's not like I got blowed up and sat there getting crap.

665
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:23,190
Scott: You know the shit kicked out of me, but I could play this a few more times.

666
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:30,010
Rym: I'm curious about trying the because apparently as from what I gather this one is probably the most accessible.

667
00:46:30,452 --> 00:46:36,669
Rym: Yeah, I don't see a reason to play the other ones unless you're a super trained nerd or unless you've played this one a bunch Of times and you're kind of sick of it.

668
00:46:36,856 --> 00:46:40,263
Scott: Yeah The one thing is that every time I play this I've played it three times.

669
00:46:40,303 --> 00:46:45,203
Rym: now actually play one of the other ones might Give insight like if the rules are a little different about a thing.

670
00:46:45,364 --> 00:46:48,980
Scott: Yeah, like strategies back I think you'd only do that if you're way into it.

671
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,358
Scott: true if you're just a board gamer in general It's like you're gonna try one of them.

672
00:46:52,378 --> 00:46:58,550
Rym: try this one if you want to try a game That's more like these stimulatory war game II like weird stuff.

673
00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:05,294
Rym: This is a pretty good one for a euro gamer to try as long as you have someone who is going to teach you into The rituals.

674
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:05,555
Rym: yeah

675
00:47:05,977 --> 00:47:23,257
Scott: anyway, so the one thing about this game I played it three times and even though I played it three times There's plenty of time to learn the rules of a game is that it's this much time between plays that I sort of forget The not the maid done the general rules But these small details right.

676
00:47:23,518 --> 00:47:25,606
Scott: when exactly do these trains expire?

677
00:47:25,947 --> 00:47:26,770
Scott: when exactly?

678
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,740
Scott: Can you start doing this versus doing that and whatnot?

679
00:47:30,082 --> 00:47:31,950
Scott: and those details matter a lot?

680
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,825
Scott: So what happens is I forget those details the next time I play and I'll make a mistake.

681
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:39,805
Scott: for example the most recent time We played at PAX Unplugged.

682
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:41,910
Scott: I Definitely made a huge mistake.

683
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:48,390
Scott: I did something on a turn and there was no reason I couldn't have done that thing a turn earlier Which would have been just better.

684
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:58,190
Scott: I just did a turn later than I could have for no reason just because I didn't realize I could at that time and That cost me some money whatever right?

685
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:04,730
Scott: But it's like if I could play the game twice in a row or twice very close to each other.

686
00:48:05,271 --> 00:48:13,210
Scott: I would basically remember all those tiny details that I've probably have already forgotten since PAX Unplugged in the first game like the warm-up.

687
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:22,630
Scott: Remember how to play remember all the details game Yeah And then play a second game with no excuses and no forgetting of those details and probably perform Really?

688
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:36,210
Scott: Well, like I give myself an actual above zero percent chance of winning if I could play twice in a row in game two In game one no zero percent chance, but in game two, I think if I played twice in a row I would have a greater than zero percent chance of winning.

689
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,898
Rym: So you wanna know the kind of person who plays this game?

690
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:41,636
Rym: I'm looking at board game because had like the screenshot up The first comment.

691
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:44,677
Rym: someone commented on this individual picture Mm-hmm.

692
00:48:45,111 --> 00:48:50,008
Rym: And the comment is why is there a city tile on the hex immediately to the west of Detroit?

693
00:48:50,349 --> 00:48:53,525
Rym: and sure enough There's one there because there's no city there in the game.

694
00:48:53,546 --> 00:48:53,968
Rym: Mm-hmm.

695
00:48:54,651 --> 00:49:06,008
Rym: And the next response is did they house rule Ann Arbor in and get a third person said basically There's a lot of people chatting about this error in this one random screenshot on board game.

696
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:06,810
Rym: Can you mean photograph?

697
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:09,117
Rym: Yeah, it's not a screenshot.

698
00:49:09,217 --> 00:49:10,220
Rym: it's not a screenshot.

699
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,343
Rym: no board game it's not.

700
00:49:11,724 --> 00:49:12,446
Rym: I'm going with that.

701
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:13,750
Scott: okay, it's a photograph.

702
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:24,450
Rym: But someone noticed that and there is a robust discussion in this one thread about literally this one picture among dozens.

703
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:32,930
Scott: Yeah So yeah, if you are at all, you know, it's like, you know If you hear people talk about like these You know things that you know.

704
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:35,443
Scott: It's sort of like I talked about back in the day fist of the North side.

705
00:49:35,483 --> 00:49:38,670
Scott: keep hearing about fist of the North Star But you never actually go to watch it, right?

706
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:43,530
Scott: It's just like a thing, you know That's in your hobby a thing you keep hearing about but you never experience it yourself.

707
00:49:44,152 --> 00:49:50,239
Scott: You keep hearing about like super nerdy train games super nerdy war games or things like that But you never actually go and play them ever.

708
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:52,290
Scott: You just know that that's sort of out there.

709
00:49:52,711 --> 00:49:54,017
Scott: It's like that is.

710
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:54,539
Scott: it's out there.

711
00:49:54,579 --> 00:49:55,101
Scott: you heard of it.

712
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:56,989
Scott: It's a thing go check it out at least once.

713
00:49:57,391 --> 00:49:58,603
Scott: Yeah, it might be worth it.

714
00:49:58,643 --> 00:50:02,965
Scott: You might like it You might discover something new and even if not, you'll learn something and then you'll learn.

715
00:50:02,985 --> 00:50:04,069
Scott: you just don't have to do it again.

716
00:50:06,032 --> 00:50:13,246
Rym: Yeah, and actually to be honest this game is Literally the ins the reason why I was inspired to make that new panel on the top 40 board the 40 board games.

717

719
00:50:27,095 --> 00:50:35,150
Rym: and shows what you know, I mean, I wouldn't buy it I wouldn't play no, I would not play it without someone who was able to do the ritual.
