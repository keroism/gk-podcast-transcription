1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,738
Scott: It's Tuesday January 19th.

2
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:12,461
Scott: I'm Scott.

Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight the secrets of Street Fighter.

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,917
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,193 --> 00:00:34,886
Rym: So last year we talked a lot about PAX East and now we're looking forward to it.

6
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:36,010
Rym: We're going to do some panels at it.

7
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,229
Rym: We didn't really announce anything beyond that.

8
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:42,886
Rym: It's finally time to announce that we actually are doing stuff at PAX East.

9
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:43,910
Scott: no, we're not now.

10
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,334
Rym: Now in Boston March 26th through 28th Pax is coming to the East Coast.

11
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:56,973
Rym: in case you lived under a rock and didn't know Kansas, Boston, Massachusetts What was that?

12
00:00:56,993 --> 00:01:04,069
Rym: that I didn't use this thing that in college humor of the German people trying to pronounce, Massachusetts That was old like Mahasisht.

13
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:08,537
Rym: But yes in Boston Mahasisht.

14
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,570
Rym: March 26th 27th 28th the penny arcade expo on the East Coast.

15
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,558
Rym: This is a grand grand.

16
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:16,683
Scott: I love how they posted that.

17
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:20,017
Scott: they thought that it would alleviate From the PAX West.

18
00:01:20,178 --> 00:01:22,450
Scott: when it's just I'm gonna boat you morons.

19
00:01:22,642 --> 00:01:31,066
Rym: Yeah We've been talking to them for a long time and way back when they were like there's gonna be a PAX East I believe I Said you're gonna get like 50 or 60 thousand people.

20
00:01:31,146 --> 00:01:34,210
Rym: you realize Everyone's gonna come out of the woodwork.

21
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,295
Rym: There are so many more like.

22
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:36,479
Scott: they basically thought that they.

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:46,627
Scott: you know that anyone who wanted to come to PAX is already coming to Pax and they wanted to make a PAX East so that the people maybe who were traveling across the country to PAX West would just Stay home not go to PAX West.

24
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:49,159
Scott: like okay We'll have two smaller conventions instead of.

25
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:51,970
Scott: no the PAX East is bigger than the West.

26
00:01:52,372 --> 00:01:55,769
Scott: It's gonna be I can guarantee it because there's more cities closer to each other.

27
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:01,103
Rym: Yeah, like population density an anime con in Baltimore gets 26,000 bodies.

28
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:03,008
Rym: PAX West only gets like 20,000 bodies.

29
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:07,340
Rym: Yeah, so PAX East is far and away.

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,480
Rym: like.

31
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,682
Rym: the only reason it's not going to be some crazy enormous disaster Is that they're gonna cap registration?

32
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:17,468
Rym: In fact badges are gonna be sold out Probably within a few days.

33
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:18,775
Scott: Yeah, probably.

34
00:02:18,976 --> 00:02:24,290
Rym: so if you have not pre registered for PAX East and you want to go well Yeah, first of all, if you haven't already you are a fool.

35
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,330
Rym: Yes, but pause GeekNights and go pre register right now, or you're not going to get a badge and not even kidding.

36
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:31,695
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what year you're.

37
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:35,990
Scott: you know, someone might be digging through the archives years from now digging this up listening to it.

38
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,399
Rym: Well, you know what?

39
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,464
Scott: You should do Year 2013 register for the next PAX East whatever it may be or else.

40
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:43,466
Scott: You're probably not gonna get it.

41
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:44,890
Rym: and PAX West.

42
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:47,290
Rym: Yeah, I feel like the two are gonna be very different.

43
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:47,654
Rym: I can't.

44
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,770
Rym: I think they'll both be good But they'll serve different purposes and I feel like I'm going to have to attend both every year.

45
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:58,369
Scott: Yeah, most I'm gonna be very curious to see what the culture of PAX East becomes, you know.

46
00:02:59,073 --> 00:03:02,390
Rym: So I do want to point out too they are looking for more enforcers.

47
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:07,742
Scott: they need a lot of help and Yeah, a bunch of people I know signed up to be enforcers.

48
00:03:07,943 --> 00:03:15,919
Scott: In fact, even some crew Yeah, even some people I would not suspect of being Enforcers have been accepted and signed up and everything.

49
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,430
Rym: So if you are willing to take up the black it is a bad.

50
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,802
Scott: You just can't stop saying that because that's what they say.

51
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:24,447
Rym: Think about that some anime con.

52
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:26,153
Rym: You're a gopher You're a volunteer.

53
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:28,319
Rym: PAX, you have taken up the black.

54
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,044
Rym: You are an enforcer.

55
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:33,818
Scott: Yeah, but it's really corny when you say it over and over It's take up the black.

56
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:34,702
Scott: It's far less corny.

57
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:46,710
Rym: I take up the black you little guy to say it just once You know, however, I do want to announce because we finally have the initial tentative schedule.

58
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:47,758
Rym: I hope this won't change.

59
00:03:47,838 --> 00:04:04,736
Rym: but we are doing Three and a half panels at PAX East this year on Friday in the wyvern theater It's the wyvern at 8 30 p.m We are doing beyond dungeons and dragons again again Again, we've already done it in that city.

60
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,270
Rym: I know but for a different convention, we might be doing it of anime Boston, too.

61
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:08,792
Rym: I don't know.

62
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:10,598
Scott: It's again in the same exact convention.

63
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,123
Scott: I don't like.

64
00:04:12,324 --> 00:04:13,990
Scott: we got to retire the panel at some point.

65
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:16,910
Scott: Well, we have to feel it is pretty much our number one panel.

66
00:04:17,151 --> 00:04:17,714
Rym: I know every.

67
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:24,209
Rym: it's kind of like when we did that gecky goth panel and every stupid anime con for the next three years was Like yeah, could you run that horrible rape panel for us again?

68
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,314
Rym: on Saturday Losing should be fun.

69
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:30,943
Rym: I already know the days in at 1 p.m.

70
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:32,810
Rym: In the Naga theater.

71
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:35,244
Scott: Oh, how could we in the Raven theater or not?

72
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:36,250
Rym: There is no Raven theater.

73
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:42,248
Rym: There's a wyvern and a Naga and I don't know any other names But those are the two that all of our panels are in.

74
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:44,038
Rym: Losing should be fun.

75
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:44,621
Rym: 1 p.m.

76
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,968
Rym: Naga theater on Saturday.

77
00:04:45,988 --> 00:04:52,330
Rym: on Sunday at noon beyond Candyland back in the wyvern and also on.

78
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:57,322
Scott: It's either wyvern or wyvern I like with urn.

79
00:04:57,543 --> 00:04:58,286
Scott: it's no urn.

80
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:01,276
Rym: it's urn Saturday sorry Sunday.

81
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:04,526
Rym: action castle with Jared Sorenson.

82
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:11,470
Rym: at 10 30 a.m The secret event for two years at Pax is finally on the schedule before packs.

83
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:21,910
Scott: It takes a long time to get that on the schedule And we'll probably action castle is gonna be run by Jared, of course, but I didn't get game as mind control the schedule.

84
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,697
Rym: Nah, we didn't get we.

85
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:27,310
Rym: we only got four of the I don't know 11 events we proposed.

86
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:29,136
Scott: So that's nice.

87
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:29,979
Scott: We need more than that.

88
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,043
Rym: Yeah, we'll work on it.

89
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:32,427
Rym: We'll work on it for Pax West.

90
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:36,070
Rym: Yeah But action castle probably won't take the whole hour.

91
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:40,490
Rym: So there will probably be something cool for the second half of that panel.

92
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,664
Rym: Maybe some sort of discussion maybe involving Luke Crane and Jared Sorenson.

93
00:05:44,764 --> 00:05:45,627
Scott: one hour dealies.

94
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:48,237
Scott: Yep And what I want?

95
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:49,723
Scott: a two hour deal there are.

96
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:51,550
Rym: there are only like 50 panels and packs.

97
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:54,682
Rym: We already account for a surprising percentage of them.

98
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:56,910
Scott: Did we get any gaming tables?

99
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,375
Rym: I can't announce anything else yet.

100
00:05:58,395 --> 00:06:01,890
Rym: The only thing I have in writing that is done are the panels.

101
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:04,417
Rym: So register for Pax East.

102
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:06,346
Rym: it's already possibly too late.

103
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:07,210
Rym: So go right now.

104
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:09,575
Scott: It's likely too late.

105
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:14,210
Rym: I mean they even tweeted they're like, hey, it's gonna sell out with Pax West also.

106
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,430
Rym: Yeah, but think about how early it is sold out.

107
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,230
Rym: I mean, they're not even gonna pretend they're already at the stage of there will be no badges at the door.

108
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:24,581
Rym: It's just a matter of when they actually physically sell out.

109
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:24,902
Scott: Yep.

110
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:34,170
Scott: All right, so There's a lot of iPhone action lately, you know, there's some apps coming out that people I never thought I would see, you know.

111
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,230
Rym: Yeah, you know start with the generic statement and kind of bring it into whatever your actual news is.

112
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,321
Scott: Yeah, you know how we do.

113
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:40,149
Scott: that's how I do.

114
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:52,517
Scott: so there's gonna be Something that you know, a lot of other portable devices have like, you know The n900 and the PSP things that people tend to like, you know They hack their device in order to get these things on there.

115
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:59,398
Scott: This is gonna be totally legit Sega Genesis emulator for The iPhone made by Sega.

116
00:06:59,498 --> 00:07:02,610
Rym: now the thing is wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, so how do ROMs work?

117
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,441
Rym: You just buy them for how much money?

118
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:11,642
Scott: Well, Sonic the Hedgehog is $6 It's a little pricey and Golden Axe is $5.

119
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:12,745
Rym: That's a little pricey.

120
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:13,066
Scott: echo.

121
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:16,055
Scott: The dolphin is $3 That's a little pricey.

122
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:18,784
Rym: Shining Force is $3.

123
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:23,917
Scott: I pay three bucks for that for Shining Force, maybe But on your on your iPhone.

124
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,121
Rym: see here's the problem.

125
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:28,170
Rym: Sega games for me have this situation of one.

126
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,239
Rym: I was a Nintendo kid.

127
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,721
Rym: So I have this weird Remembered latent hatred for Sega even though I owned a Game Gear and I love Sonic.

128
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:37,890
Rym: Mm-hmm, but to rose-tinted glasses.

129
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:46,897
Scott: Well the thing here, right something I've recently realized is that I don't know how much longer People are going to stand for this.

130
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:48,743
Scott: maybe another year or so.

131
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:49,365
Rym: It's simple.

132
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:52,978
Rym: It's the exact same thing that happened With cassettes and with DVDs.

133
00:07:53,099 --> 00:08:02,670
Rym: when DVDs first came out everyone was like, oh crap I can buy that movie that I liked as a kid that you know I have a busted old VHS for again and own it in a modern format.

134
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:06,942
Rym: but Nowadays, there's no reason to keep doing that.

135
00:08:06,982 --> 00:08:09,231
Scott: like if formats are digital I mean It's.

136
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:13,201
Scott: eventually we're gonna get to the point once everything is in a digital format.

137
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:25,609
Scott: if I've bought say an exe file I'm not gonna repay To get a you know Something else file for a different, you know, so it runs on something else.

138
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,450
Rym: But they do planned obsolescence or just things change standards go away DRM servers shut down.

139
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,186
Rym: There are ways to force that however with digital media the moment that happens is pirated because I already bought it.

140
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:40,143
Rym: if I already bought It pirating the exact same thing again.

141
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:41,610
Rym: What could you possibly say again?

142
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:47,110
Scott: I mean it even extends beyond this right like look I just bought Street Fighter 4 for the PC on Steam, right?

143
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:48,273
Scott: It's nice.

144
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:50,740
Scott: it's basically 100% the same exact game.

145
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,104
Scott: that is on Xbox, right?

146
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:57,060
Scott: The only difference is that the PC version is They added some slight modifications like cuz.

147
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:05,690
Scott: they need an options menu in order to you know Configure your video card settings, which you don't need in the Xbox and they needed an options menu to configure different buttons.

148
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,859
Scott: Cuz you know computers have keyboards.

149
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,630
Rym: They should put those Xbox games anyway, just to confuse you.

150
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:13,849
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but I mean those are the only changes they've really made at all.

151
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:17,610
Scott: Other than that, it's probably you know, they probably it's the exact same code.

152
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,924
Scott: I know the Capcom has a system that they make can make games cross-platform very easily.

153
00:09:21,944 --> 00:09:23,910
Scott: that where it's 90% like the same exact game.

154
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,298
Scott: So and even if they didn't they can.

155
00:09:26,378 --> 00:09:32,381
Scott: if you're making something in like XNA for the Xbox and the PC It's 90% the same exact thing even more than that.

156
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:34,150
Scott: Maybe 99% the same exact thing.

157
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,033
Rym: Well, that is why.

158
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:37,039
Scott: so why should I have to pay again?

159
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,745
Scott: I bought Street Fighter 4.

160
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,390
Scott: Why can't I play it on the Xbox?

161
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:41,900
Scott: It's the same exact thing.

162
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,127
Rym: Well, here's here's brilliant.

163
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:48,410
Rym: Yes So they do not do what if they you buy one version of the game?

164
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,350
Rym: Whatever now the smart the nice thing to do would be now you have it for every system forever.

165
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:59,114
Rym: Yep, what I would do is the business man and say all right you own it on the PC for $1.

166
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:01,948
Rym: You can get the whatever you need to also play it on your.

167
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:08,559
Scott: I mean That's something I think that they can do actually in the short term is they could say, you know, PC version $20.

168
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:15,750
Scott: Xbox version $20 Version for both computer $30, you know that would work for a short time.

169
00:10:15,951 --> 00:10:23,070
Scott: I would even pay $30 for the double version instead of $20 individually for the you know Versions that only work on one platform, right?

170
00:10:23,351 --> 00:10:31,397
Scott: And that would actually also be good because all the people who are only interested in getting it for one platform or the other Would also buy more copies to save more money.

171
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:41,904
Scott: and here's the thing right is that if you think about it having separate copies for separate You know platforms how much money that's not giving them any extra sales.

172
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:43,870
Scott: How many people are buying the game twice?

173
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:53,090
Rym: I know it would not too many people If they do well for them if they did the thing where the Xbox version has this tiny little difference.

174
00:10:53,191 --> 00:11:00,509
Scott: So the hardcore bands by both but you know If they that's what they do it like adding the characters and Soul Calibur on the different platforms.

175
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,857
Rym: well, I mean, who do you who do you want link or How many extra copies do they sell?

176
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:07,081
Scott: I don't.

177
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:21,844
Scott: I can't believe that they would sell that many extra copies of Because people need to buy both right, but if they sold a version that was the double version They would sell a lot of extra copies of people who would just say oh man That's such a huge bargain something that works on both.

178
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:22,690
Scott: I'll totally buy that.

179
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:27,090
Rym: I think the reason they don't probably boils down to a misunderstanding on their part of the market.

180
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:33,270
Scott: Yes So I think in the short term you could make money with that sort of pricing model of having a double vert.

181
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,410
Scott: You know selling a combined pack of you know stuff.

182
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:40,990
Scott: But I think in the long term pretty much you're gonna be forced to just sell your game.

183
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:49,290
Scott: This is my game if your game happens to be multi-platform You're just gonna have to give them the game on every platform at once in one package, you know.

184
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:50,719
Scott: And the thing is right.

185
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:51,888
Scott: you think about it.

186
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:55,223
Scott: Let's say I make a game for Xbox three 360 and ps3, right?

187
00:11:56,972 --> 00:12:02,620
Scott: Okay, it doesn't cost me anything To you know print a CD.

188
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,710
Scott: It's like a dollar not even a dollar to print another disc.

189
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:10,047
Scott: So why not just put both discs in the same box and say, you know 50 bucks.

190
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:10,609
Scott: That's what it is.

191
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,274
Scott: Why why go through the?

192
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:17,770
Scott: you're actually spending more money to print up two separate boxes with two separate instruction manuals.

193
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:22,782
Scott: You would save money in the economy of scale Because the only extra cost is actually manufacturing be.

194
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:28,890
Scott: the thing they had to worry about though With that specific instance is because these are you know physical media.

195
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:31,941
Scott: I would buy the double version and my friend has a ps3.

196
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:32,985
Scott: I have an Xbox now.

197
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:34,290
Scott: We actually have two copies.

198
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:36,547
Rym: That's why you have to do with digital activation, right?

199
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,382
Scott: But with digital this isn't a problem anymore.

200
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:40,729
Scott: if it's steam or something, right?

201
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:48,493
Scott: So if Mike if my console hooked up to my TV is also steam and my iPhone is also steam and my you know Take that.

202
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:52,968
Scott: that's the way we need to go is wherever you have a steam or something like it and it's just.

203
00:12:53,189 --> 00:13:05,250
Scott: all your Platforms of gaming TV your portable your PC all your gaming platforms all run on the same Store and you only buy a game once and you can play it everywhere.

204
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,345
Scott: This is why I can buy Mario Brothers and I could play it on the Wii.

205
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:10,539
Scott: I could play it on the DS I could play it on my iPhone.

206
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:11,405
Scott: I could play it on my PC.

207
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:12,070
Scott: I could play anywhere.

208
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:14,962
Rym: This is why I'm not buying an Xbox in this general.

209
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:17,051
Rym: I've decided not to bother with the Xbox 360.

210
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:21,825
Scott: Well, the only reason is because I realized the Xbox 360 is gonna be around for years.

211
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:27,384
Rym: Oh, yeah, but I see This trend and I I imagine that it won't be that long before.

212
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:32,410
Rym: much of the Xbox 360 Repertoire is available in Windows game.

213
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:37,330
Scott: First of all, it already is most of the Xbox games that are any good, but not all of it.

214
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,189
Rym: Yes, I can't play every Xbox game on my PC yet.

215
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:49,337
Scott: Yep, and I the thing is the reason I got the Xbox is because it was mad cheap there's a big deal on it and Because there are a few games.

216
00:13:49,397 --> 00:13:52,870
Scott: I really wanted to play and I noticed I haven't bought any physical games for it whatsoever.

217
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:56,319
Scott: And the other thing is that I already had controllers for it.

218
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:03,162
Scott: So it was sort of like a double bonus, you know, and I can also make games for it, which is kind of neat.

219
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:04,527
Rym: So how many games have you made?

220
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:04,989
Scott: zero?

221
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:06,512
Rym: Yeah Yeah there is one.

222
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:08,721
Rym: I think there are two separate days of reckoning.

223
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:18,910
Rym: the first day of reckoning that they're just not addressing at all is The conversions of platforms, but there's a very specific phenomenon of selling retro games to people primarily based on nostalgia.

224
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:22,710
Scott: There's also I think selling retro games to people who never played them.

225
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,236
Scott: I mean how many people.

226
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:26,968
Scott: you know, we played the fuck out of Mario 3, right?

227
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:33,414
Scott: But there are a lot of people out there who didn't play Mario 3 and they could still buy Mario 3.

228
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,987
Scott: So if Nintendo puts it up for sale, they can make some money.

229
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:40,790
Rym: Yep However, this only works because of these weird market conditions.

230
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:47,807
Rym: I mean say I have an original copy of Mario 3. until you know, not that long ago It was the biggest selling game in the history of games ever.

231
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:56,530
Rym: now It's not even on the top 10 list But in terms of the thing about how many Mario 3 cartridges exist just in North America too many.

232
00:14:57,051 --> 00:15:04,410
Rym: So what if you bought all of them up for cheap or you acquired one somehow and you just dump the ROM and destroy the cartridge?

233
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:06,638
Rym: You haven't committed a crime as far as I'm concerned.

234
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,130
Rym: So what if you didn't even copy the ROMs?

235
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,163
Rym: What if you just sold the ROMs and everyone was perfect and no one pirated it?

236
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:16,777
Rym: that would still destroy This whole.

237
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:18,450
Rym: buy it for five bucks market.

238
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,978
Scott: Yeah, cuz I mean the cartridges.

239
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:22,050
Scott: I mean there are some people with NES is out there.

240
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,819
Scott: But really the cartridges no one's.

241
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:38,410
Rym: very few people in this weird situation the cartridges direct where a lot of the media from the past that isn't just available in a completely digital DRM free format is Not competing with modern media as effectively as it could because there's an artificial price limitation.

242
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:48,431
Rym: There's an artificially high price to get Mario 3. when the considering the supply Mario 3 It's harder to get a lot of things than it is to get a copy of Mario 3.

243
00:15:48,431 --> 00:15:53,750
Rym: Yep, I mean you see like a cartridge ever for sale for like a dollar at some Chinese knockoff store.

244
00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:02,480
Rym: Yeah, but anyway things of the day.

245
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:06,800
Rym: There are a ton of remixes of that Hitler movie where they'll just resubtitled.

246
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:09,008
Scott: I'm so tired of these Hitler you make.

247
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:11,638
Rym: you got to admit the first Hitler remix was pretty funny.

248
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:17,115
Scott: Yeah So played out, you know and it's like alright.

249
00:16:17,135 --> 00:16:19,125
Scott: at this point guys The joke is not.

250
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:22,200
Rym: there's always the trend where someone will do something clever like that.

251
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:31,055
Rym: There will be a million copycats for a while and then someone will do something More clever with it to change everything and kind of jump up above the crowd.

252
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:32,380
Scott: I don't think this is one of those cases.

253
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:42,700
Rym: I think it is because rather than taking that one scene and just changing all the words which anyone could do They took that scene changed all the words and integrated it with Khan from Star Trek.

254
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,193
Rym: Maybe it's just because you don't like Star Trek.

255
00:16:45,273 --> 00:16:46,200
Rym: I found this hilarious.

256
00:16:46,683 --> 00:16:49,740
Rym: Okay, mostly for the piss-off at the end for Hitler, yeah.

257
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:55,384
Scott: So in gaming no matter what kind of gaming you're doing There is one shape.

258
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:58,436
Scott: that is the most important shape in all of gaming.

259
00:16:58,456 --> 00:16:59,159
Scott: Do you know the shape?

260
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,759
Rym: See, I do know but I'm not going to spoil your thing of the day.

261
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,365
Rym: I'm not gonna spoil it.

262
00:17:04,484 --> 00:17:06,832
Rym: perhaps the the rhombus.

263
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:09,260
Rym: No, maybe the the decahedron.

264
00:17:10,522 --> 00:17:11,267
Scott: It is it.

265
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:23,597
Scott: a decahedron is double is a dough Decahedron it's not I don't know if you look at a double dough decahedron from a certain angle Perhaps it looks like a hexagon the most important shape in all of gaming.

266
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:27,028
Scott: So here's a website Hall of hexagons.

267
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,657
Scott: This website is about nothing but hexagons.

268
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:50,699
Scott: It contains A cornucopia of maths facts about hexagons including the area lengths and angles number sequences tiling tessellation the Sizzles, you know I see Polyhedron, I think you can differentiate what kind of gamer and from what era someone is by what shape they actually say.

269
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,430
Rym: because Remember when third-aid D&D switched to the square?

270
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:54,530
Scott: Yeah.

271
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:58,060
Rym: Yeah, and of course, I thought you're thinking today was something else.

272
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,079
Rym: I thought you're going to talk about the om nom nom a gone.

273
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:03,599
Rym: What's the official name for the shape of pac-man?

274
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:14,533
Scott: This is uh, here's a website all about hexagons And if you need to do something like it's really it's mostly useful.

275
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:35,940
Scott: right if you're going to make a game You know Maybe you need to print a hex map or maybe you need to make a hex object or maybe you need to program a game involving hexes and you need like the algorithm to draw a Hex grid or you need to find the distance, you know Like if my battle mech is gonna move from this hex to that hex How much distance is there from the center point of this one to the center point of one?

276
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,446
Scott: That's three up and two over.

277
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:43,190
Rym: remember using the laser pointer on battle tech with lines of sight and be like It's just touching the edge of the hexagon.

278
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,893
Rym: I can hit him.

279
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:45,079
Scott: Yeah, right.

280
00:18:45,802 --> 00:18:49,560
Scott: So here is here's the exact math you can use to avoid using a laser pointer.

281
00:18:50,262 --> 00:19:03,640
Rym: The sad thing is all through my high school career all through my middle school career all through my time at RIT What I wanted and needed more than anything was a hex map and a square math, but I just there were too much money.

282
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:11,140
Rym: It was never worth it and I bought one on sale when I realized that if you buy these slightly imperfect ones They're like quarter the price, right?

283
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,720
Scott: Cuz usually you go to the store and you want to buy a hex map and there's like a perfect hex map.

284
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:15,163
Scott: It's all.

285
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:22,300
Scott: they're all lined up in your straight, you know And there's a nice border around the edge of the map and the hexes are printed directly in the middle, right?

286
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:40,180
Scott: so but apparently at the store they just have like these off-cut ones where it's just like they basically just slapped a bunch of hexes down in a big sheet and just cut it up into you know, sort of squares and They're straight enough and it's like way way way cheaper than getting the pretty hex map and it's just as serviceable.

287
00:19:40,902 --> 00:19:43,831
Rym: So we bought it and I've never used it.

288
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:45,235
Rym: because I never needed it.

289
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:49,191
Scott: because I don't play D&D anymore I don't bought it at like the last minute.

290
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,980
Scott: It's like just as we didn't need it anymore.

291
00:19:51,161 --> 00:19:51,643
Scott: We bought it.

292
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:53,611
Rym: It sat there in the living room and every day.

293
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:55,880
Rym: I was like, oh man, I can't wait to play battle tech.

294
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,359
Rym: I have not played battle tech since we bought that.

295
00:19:59,290 --> 00:19:59,999
Rym: Maybe it's time.

296
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:03,745
Scott: It's time to live battle tech for a long time.

297
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,694
Rym: I think we should schedule an FRC battle tech meetup.

298
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:07,897
Scott: Oh snap.

299
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:12,149
Scott: No girls I mean is the thing right?

300
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:16,180
Scott: Okay, you know any girls who want to complain about no girls allowed in battle tech.

301
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:18,840
Scott: I ask you do you actually want to play battle?

302
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,563
Rym: I'll say a different.

303
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,093
Scott: are you seriously saying you want to play battle?

304
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:23,660
Rym: I will put it this way for reals.

305
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:28,993
Scott: Like most people of my age back in the day arcades still existed.

306
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:31,420
Rym: We kind of we're at the end of the arcade era.

307
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,567
Rym: I remember going like Mortal Kombat 3.

308
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:37,507
Rym: I'd stand there in line and lose my quarter to the one guy who was good at fighting games.

309
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:39,402
Scott: exactly You know.

310
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:47,231
Scott: and I played the street fighter - I played Street Fighter - I played Super Street Fighter - I mostly played Street Fighter 2 Championship Edition.

311
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:51,240
Rym: when I was a kid I wondered if there was a Street Fighter 1 and I did not believe it existed.

312
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,357
Scott: I had played the Street Fighter 1 at a young age.

313
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:57,417
Rym: actually I had never played it until that katsu-kan where they brought it.

314
00:20:57,517 --> 00:21:03,860
Scott: really See I had played it much earlier than that because there was a an arcade in Milford that had the machine.

315
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,746
Scott: There was pretty also had accused are there?

316
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:07,632
Rym: there was precedent for that sort of bullshit?

317
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:11,683
Rym: because remember goonies - no one remembers goonies won That's true.

318
00:21:11,824 --> 00:21:12,105
Scott: Yeah.

319
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:12,486
Scott: Yeah.

320
00:21:12,908 --> 00:21:15,680
Scott: But anyway, so I had played my share of Street Fighter.

321
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:22,026
Scott: I even had Street Fighter 2 Championship Edition for the Sega Genesis and the six button gamepad, you know I played it.

322
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:24,317
Scott: now thing is I was never good, right?

323
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:28,740
Scott: I would always just get my ass kicked by anyone who actually knew what they were doing.

324
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:33,627
Scott: You know, even if I went to a convention and played open gaming I would just get my ass completely destroyed.

325
00:21:33,968 --> 00:21:39,710
Scott: people do these combos and then I would try to like even if I tried a little Bit like to read a combo in the book.

326
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,360
Scott: I would try to do the combo.

327
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,660
Scott: It'd be like okay jump in with a light punch do two standing light kicks a low-light punch and then a hadouken.

328
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,754
Rym: Yeah, so you're thinking that meanwhile the guys just like boom boom boom, right?

329
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:57,779
Scott: Okay, so I was like I have no idea what to do and I had always assumed it's my reflexes It's something you know.

330
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,608
Scott: And the thing is even beyond that.

331
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:09,240
Scott: like I couldn't do most moves like I would see okay to do a shore You can I press forward down then down forward then push the punch button, right?

332
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:11,053
Scott: So I try to do it and it wouldn't work.

333
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:11,760
Scott: and I try to do it.

334
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,324
Scott: It wouldn't work.

335
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:12,868
Scott: and I try to do.

336
00:22:12,928 --> 00:22:14,619
Scott: I try doing the arcade it wouldn't work.

337
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:16,749
Scott: I was just like what the fuck.

338
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:22,874
Rym: I also had the problem if I learned a complicated move I would always try to use it at the wrong time because I could use it.

339
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:24,220
Rym: So I wanted to use it all the time.

340
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:24,741
Scott: Yep.

341
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:29,837
Scott: Yeah, I mostly be like M bison do psycho crushers back and forth because I was able to do charge moves.

342
00:22:29,878 --> 00:22:30,881
Scott: charging was easy Right.

343
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:35,360
Scott: Just hold the button down for two seconds then push the other button and you know, then push two other.

344
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:37,100
Rym: So I played guile a lot of the time.

345
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:42,360
Scott: Yeah, those moves are relatively easier to understand that I could actually execute them, right, you know.

346
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:52,992
Scott: But basically because I was never able to achieve any skill and I never had enough money to pump quarters into the arcade And I you know, I just I just couldn't get good at the games.

347
00:22:53,273 --> 00:22:54,918
Scott: You know, I just sort of stuck at my level.

348
00:22:55,078 --> 00:23:01,519
Scott: but Very recently steam had a big sale and Street Fighter 4 was cheap cheap cheap cheap.

349
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:02,845
Scott: So I was like, you know what?

350
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:05,015
Scott: I'm gonna buy Street Fighter 4 and you know what?

351
00:23:05,637 --> 00:23:10,420
Scott: I know That I am never going to be good at these games.

352
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:24,307
Rym: the last time I had an illusion that would be good at a game is when the new Smash Brothers came out because I thought I will from day one practice and make sure that this is the game now Fucking that stops right right away.

353
00:23:24,748 --> 00:23:28,900
Scott: So, you know, I thought you know, I'm like, I'm never gonna win a tournament ever in my life.

354
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:41,519
Scott: I'm never gonna beat anyone who actually you know It's like some young kid who's good at fighting games never gonna beat anyone who's like a Korean and who learned how to play Street Fighter from their elementary school teacher where they had, you know Street fighting class and Mortal Kombat class, right?

355
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:46,300
Rym: A Starcraft class, I believe you mean Starcraft University.

356
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,099
Rym: Yeah, right.

357
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:50,740
Scott: So I'm never gonna expect to beat them or be as good as them.

358
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,349
Scott: But I would if I'm gonna buy this.

359
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:56,520
Scott: I want to get to the point where I can get a combo off.

360
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:59,209
Scott: You know, I can actually do the super move.

361
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,120
Rym: I at least hit him one time before I go down.

362
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:04,093
Scott: Yeah, I don't just get pinned in the corner.

363
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:06,759
Scott: infinite combo done I'm dead because I don't know what to do.

364
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:08,306
Scott: I you know, I just want.

365
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:11,440
Scott: I want to be able to go to PAX go this open gaming.

366
00:24:11,822 --> 00:24:13,750
Scott: I can go up to a game a fighting game.

367
00:24:13,771 --> 00:24:15,840
Scott: All right, and not just be embarrassed.

368
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:28,819
Scott: You know if I'm doing a podcast about gaming I should be able to at least have a mildly Respectable amount of skill and there is no reason even though my reflexes probably don't compare to like some 13 year olds.

369
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:35,040
Scott: There is no reason that I cannot practice this for a few hours a day and get some progress.

370
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:38,271
Scott: You know, I can read these instructions on these special moves.

371
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:40,740
Scott: The game has all the special move instructions in it.

372
00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:41,888
Scott: I can do this.

373
00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:50,279
Rym: plus I'll say this as a kid I at least had unrealistic expectations as to my skill because I was playing FPS is constantly and I was really good.

374
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:50,780
Scott: and you're down.

375
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,630
Scott: Yeah, you're dominating in other genres that weren't fighting games.

376
00:24:53,690 --> 00:25:00,750
Rym: Yeah, I didn't think as a kid that wait a minute I've spent many many years Practicing constantly at FPS.

377
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,216
Rym: is why do I expect to be good?

378
00:25:02,296 --> 00:25:04,288
Scott: thing is well The thing is right.

379
00:25:04,388 --> 00:25:05,980
Scott: I did play a lot of fighting games.

380
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,667
Scott: I owned Street Fighter 2 championship edition.

381
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,394
Rym: You played them, but you did not grok them.

382
00:25:11,495 --> 00:25:27,680
Scott: Well, listen, I'm gonna tell you I Played probably Street Fighter 2 championship edition just as much as I played like fucking Mario 3 or Sonic the Hedgehog or whatever, but I'm way better at those than I am at Street Fighter 2, right?

383
00:25:28,441 --> 00:25:33,699
Scott: so I start playing Street Fighter 4 and You know, I can do a Hadouken.

384
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:41,450
Scott: I'm already like just reading the instructions and how to do the moves and going into training mode and just sort of practicing Doing the special move over and over again.

385
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,700
Scott: I'm building up a little bit of skill, right?

386
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,223
Scott: I can do it.

387
00:25:44,284 --> 00:25:44,909
Scott: I can just do it.

388
00:25:44,949 --> 00:25:54,548
Scott: who can's over and over again like I do Right, and I'm like, alright, and if they get close I can actually most of the time do a shoryuken when they come into jump Kick, right?

389
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,936
Scott: So I'm getting somewhere.

390
00:25:55,997 --> 00:26:00,070
Scott: but really That amount of skill is not any I can't on the game.

391
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:05,911
Scott: if I try to play the game on medium with that level of Skill, I can't beat it without continuing right?

392
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:11,716
Scott: So clearly I am NOT and if I play online I basically have a 0% win rate against random internet opponents.

393
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:12,560
Scott: Okay?

394
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:13,890
Scott: All right.

395
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:20,198
Scott: So this was obviously not enough to achieve my goal, right, but I was having fun.

396
00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:21,803
Scott: The game is fun It's a good game.

397
00:26:22,104 --> 00:26:24,092
Scott: So I I'm able to stick with it, right?

398
00:26:24,654 --> 00:26:24,975
Scott: Okay.

399
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,140
Scott: So what do I do now?

400
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,780
Scott: Well someone I get some advice from people I know on the internet.

401
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:38,971
Scott: So I talked to someone who's you know, who has it for the ps3 and he's giving me some advice like hey You should stick with one character to learn all their stuff and I'm like, yeah You know, that sounds like a good idea cuz that helped.

402
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:40,380
Scott: that worked for me in Soul Calibur, too.

403
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,526
Scott: You know stick with one guy learn their stuff, right?

404
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:47,120
Scott: And then he tells me, you know, like there's a trials mode now.

405
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,101
Scott: Remember we were talking that there should be some sort of DDR for Street Fighter Shouldn't

406
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:52,466
Rym: show you can

407
00:26:52,607 --> 00:27:00,138
Scott: do right where it's like the arrows and the buttons would fall from the top of the screen So that you would know what to push right and you would learn the timing from that.

408
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:05,480
Scott: now Trials mode doesn't have that but trials mode is still pretty close to that.

409
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:10,759
Scott: What it does is it'll tell you like, okay do a strong punch as you do it and it says yes.

410
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:14,149
Scott: Then it says okay now do a crouching kick ha.

411
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:15,634
Scott: and it'll get you say good.

412
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:17,760
Scott: and then it'll say now do a fireball.

413
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,426
Scott: So you do a fireball and says good.

414
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:23,480
Scott: and then you know, you can just keep doing this and it gets progressively harder.

415
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,510
Scott: It'll be like, okay do the super move.

416
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:35,340
Scott: Okay now do Jump punch followed by a low punch followed by a fireball right and you have to do them really quickly.

417
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:43,360
Scott: It's like, you know, you can see Graphically, it'll show you like how long you have to do one move after the previous move and it's no time at all.

418
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,799
Scott: Basically and when you do it properly, it'll be like punch punch arugan.

419
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:53,697
Scott: It's like fast really fast, but I was able to do it eventually with practicing and I was like, all right I felt good.

420
00:27:53,981 --> 00:28:03,160
Scott: I mean to push the buttons and see him do three things really fast where you know As long it's a combo a real combo the first one hits and that he can't avoid you for like three more hits.

421
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,910
Scott: That's it feels real good.

422
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,318
Scott: It makes you want to keep playing, right?

423
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:13,240
Scott: So eventually, you know, I'm playing just sort of random modes and doing some trials and playing against computers.

424
00:28:13,643 --> 00:28:16,917
Scott: right and The computer is based.

425
00:28:17,018 --> 00:28:26,552
Scott: one time I'm playing against the computer and also I saw a real person do this and they're basically going like sonic boom sonic boom Sonic boom sonic boom and I'm like what?

426
00:28:27,195 --> 00:28:28,380
Scott: how the are they cheating?

427
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,113
Scott: Do they have a sonic boom button on the game?

428
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:32,120
Scott: What are they doing?

429
00:28:32,722 --> 00:28:42,539
Scott: Right to do a sonic you have to hold back for two seconds And then to do a sonic boom the instructions say you must hold back for two Seconds on the game clock.

430
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,546
Rym: I always said that from Street Fighter 2.

431
00:28:44,546 --> 00:28:56,800
Scott: then you have to push forward and then push a button right which means According to that all laws of physics say that you must wait two seconds between sonic booms.

432
00:28:57,481 --> 00:29:03,880
Rym: Am I actually two seconds plus I guess the Planck limit of time of you know, hitting all the other buttons, right?

433
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,220
Scott: Right.

434
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,207
Scott: Well the you know the time on the clock that the Street Fighter in-game clock is pretty much Seconds the real-world seconds.

435
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:12,532
Scott: It's a pretty accurate clock, right?

436
00:29:12,572 --> 00:29:13,716
Scott: Maybe it's a little bit fast.

437
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:14,419
Scott: Maybe a little bit.

438
00:29:15,141 --> 00:29:16,545
Scott: So how were they doing?

439
00:29:16,685 --> 00:29:19,012
Scott: one sonic boom per second, right?

440
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:21,980
Scott: How is that even possible?

441
00:29:22,281 --> 00:29:25,131
Scott: You know, did you mean after the first sonic boom comes out?

442
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:27,540
Scott: I shouldn't see another one for two seconds, right?

443
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,900
Rym: So obviously there is some secret here that we are stupid.

444
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:39,320
Scott: So usually right when it let's think about other games for a minute, right, let's take advance wars, right?

445
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,271
Scott: I'll play against Rym and advance wars.

446
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,900
Scott: Yeah, like ring you're cheating.

447
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:49,203
Scott: How the fuck did you get three medium tanks in the same amount of time with the same number of cities and all I have For three mechs?

448
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:51,615
Scott: and I'm like, there must be some gnosis.

449
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:56,514
Scott: you have The secret knowledge right.

450
00:29:56,816 --> 00:30:00,569
Scott: that is Preventing me from being that good there is.

451
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,816
Scott: I was convinced there is a secret knowledge.

452
00:30:02,856 --> 00:30:03,880
Scott: now Rym in advance wars.

453
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,904
Scott: Is there a secret knowledge?

454
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:14,623
Rym: I fucking count how much money I've got and I plan ahead a couple rounds so that so we can Agree that there isn't really a gnosis in advance or no, there's just bad Right.

455
00:30:14,843 --> 00:30:23,000
Scott: So going by the you know, I mean I have complained of secret knowledges in many games But really I've never actually found a secret knowledge, right?

456
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:34,779
Scott: What can you think of an example of a game that actually has Gnosis some secret secret things that aren't in the instruction manual where if you know them Suddenly the world opens up to you and you're on another level.

457
00:30:35,642 --> 00:30:40,518
Rym: One minor one is pay me for the fucking door, but that's that is a sort of a nose.

458
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:41,120
Scott: What is minor?

459
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,662
Rym: It's not.

460
00:30:41,762 --> 00:30:43,672
Rym: it's not a game changer, right?

461
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:47,367
Scott: I'm gonna tell you something I actually had to research very.

462
00:30:47,407 --> 00:30:50,176
Scott: it was surprisingly difficult to find this information.

463
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:51,540
Rym: Did you try to just like do them?

464
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:54,340
Scott: I tried to just go to game facts to see if I could find the nose.

465
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,473
Rym: I mean you turn into guile and just try to like do a bunch of.

466
00:30:57,553 --> 00:31:05,139
Scott: I couldn't do more than one every two seconds right, so You know there were two seconds between my sonic booms when I tried to do it.

467
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:06,927
Scott: So I tried to go to game facts.

468
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,137
Scott: now there was some you know.

469
00:31:09,237 --> 00:31:15,729
Scott: in game facts I couldn't really find the gnosis but what I could find were some lingos.

470
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:21,060
Scott: words like Cancel counter tech right like oh you got to tech out, you know.

471
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,251
Scott: And I was like what the hell is tech out mean?

472
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:24,357
Scott: is that something?

473
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:24,860
Scott: I don't know.

474
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,517
Scott: I mean I've seen the words tech flash across the screen when I'm playing.

475
00:31:28,578 --> 00:31:32,618
Scott: sometimes It's usually when I try to throw and the other guy tries to throw at the same time.

476
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:38,485
Rym: see now I know in like for example spinning disk appears, and this is tech I've never brought.

477
00:31:38,907 --> 00:31:47,980
Rym: I think it means technique not technology is a good example because there's these Situations in the game that I could never take advantage of and I didn't even know about them to some fanboy told me about him.

478
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:53,760
Rym: But like all right you can do a block in the air to like cancel out the timer on some move.

479
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,698
Rym: You just did to do it again.

480
00:31:55,302 --> 00:32:00,060
Rym: But it was always so esoteric that I didn't care about it because none of our friends did any of that stuff.

481
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,065
Rym: So I didn't need to worry about it.

482
00:32:01,246 --> 00:32:03,980
Scott: Yep, so I researched further.

483
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:12,245
Scott: I was I was very very determined to learn the secrets right because I was just so convinced there was Gnosis.

484
00:32:12,386 --> 00:32:13,050
Rym: so came in.

485
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,420
Rym: are you gonna tell me this fucking gnosis?

486
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:19,926
Scott: I'm gonna tell you I have not learned all of the gnosis right I have only learned a little bit.

487
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:21,050
Rym: so the core I will.

488
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,060
Scott: they hit you, but let me tell you the gnosis is real.

489
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:25,745
Scott: There are through.

490
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:34,840
Scott: the rules of Street Fighter are not in any instruction manual or in any game fact And this is why everyone in the world is better at Street Fighter and similar fighting games.

491
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:40,631
Scott: Then we are is because there is secret information That is not well published on the internet.

492
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,020
Scott: the game doesn't tell you the secret information.

493
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:44,810
Scott: Game facts doesn't even have it.

494
00:32:44,891 --> 00:32:45,414
Scott: It's only in.

495
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:48,307
Scott: like these other facts We're kind of hard to find.

496
00:32:48,327 --> 00:32:49,070
Scott: I had to go.

497
00:32:49,311 --> 00:33:02,879
Scott: someone gave me a link to a something awful Forum thread that had links to some facts that had like inklings of the gnosis And I was able to read that and derive the gnosis by inferring things from that tag.

498
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,260
Rym: It's tough.

499
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,480
Rym: You're digging through the asartic library, but half of its burned down.

500
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,915
Scott: I was also got a lot of help by watching YouTube videos.

501
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:12,320
Scott: There was actually a YouTube video.

502
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,625
Scott: Maybe I'll link to it right.

503
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:29,805
Scott: that has that shows a lot of things from Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, maybe I'm not sure if it's turbo or not But it's definitely Super Street Fighter 2 and a lot of those same things apply in future Street Fighter games like Street Fighter 4 Gnosis number one.

504
00:33:29,825 --> 00:33:30,808
Scott: This is the.

505
00:33:30,828 --> 00:33:31,631
Scott: this is the big one.

506
00:33:31,651 --> 00:33:32,815
Scott: you're ready you ready for this.

507
00:33:32,896 --> 00:33:34,200
Rym: lay it on me, okay?

508
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:40,620
Scott: So let's say I want to do something real simple do a jumping punch followed by a hurricane right?

509
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:54,838
Scott: So I tap up and forward my guys jumping forward I get close to you I press the punch button I land on the ground then I press down down forward forward And I press hadouken that is much too slow because I punch and then I have to do this whole movie.

510
00:33:54,878 --> 00:33:56,544
Rym: wait Wait wait wait do I?

511
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:58,250
Rym: I think I see where you're going with this.

512
00:33:58,431 --> 00:34:01,602
Rym: do I not need to wait for what my guy was gonna Do to finish?

513
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,946
Rym: do I just have to do the motions?

514
00:34:03,588 --> 00:34:06,436
Scott: no it's even crazier than that.

515
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:07,620
Scott: you ready for this.

516
00:34:08,603 --> 00:34:10,780
Scott: So there are certain moves.

517
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:12,123
Scott: It's called a cancel.

518
00:34:12,424 --> 00:34:15,473
Scott: right it depends on what the first move you're doing is.

519
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,762
Scott: some things are cancelable and some things are not Right.

520
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:24,920
Scott: if something is cancelable you can start doing stuff while that is still happening, right?

521
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,719
Scott: So like your super moves are our quote-unquote infinitely cancelable.

522
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:37,808
Scott: So you can input moves while the super move animation is happening and when the super move animation is done the moves will come out right.

523
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:49,393
Scott: so If you do a cancelable You know attack You can do the hadouken while the animation for that cancelable attack is happening And then the hadouken will come out immediately afterwards.

524
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:51,563
Rym: so sonic boom is cancelable and you can.

525
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:52,387
Rym: just so you do it.

526
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:52,748
Rym: so you

527
00:34:52,789 --> 00:35:07,797
Scott: do a sonic boom and then you me as soon as you let Go of it you pull the stick back to start charging the next sonic boom while the first one well He's still saying sir He's like it isn't even gotten to the onik and you're already charging right the second sonic boom.

528
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:08,639
Scott: so it's like boom.

529
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:17,960
Scott: Right it takes him like almost two seconds to do the sonic boom move especially if it's the fear sonic boom which is slower.

530
00:35:18,703 --> 00:35:22,880
Scott: So as soon as he's done with that one you let out the next one and start charging the third one.

531
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,840
Scott: And you can just go sonic boom you only need the two second weight on the first one.

532
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:29,227
Scott: But get this you can do a jump kick.

533
00:35:29,548 --> 00:35:30,591
Scott: so I jump forward.

534
00:35:30,872 --> 00:35:32,116
Scott: right to do the jump kick.

535
00:35:32,136 --> 00:35:33,240
Rym: is jump kick cancelable?

536
00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:34,303
Scott: No check this out.

537
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:35,768
Scott: I jump forward right.

538
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,657
Scott: I immediately before I even do the jump kick.

539
00:35:38,738 --> 00:35:41,448
Scott: I'm holding back I'm still and I just tap up and forward.

540
00:35:41,488 --> 00:35:42,512
Scott: I'm to jump into the air.

541
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:43,496
Scott: just tap it.

542
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:44,280
Scott: any jumps, right?

543
00:35:44,802 --> 00:35:48,889
Scott: So before I even reach the height of the jump I already have the stick facing backwards.

544
00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:53,498
Scott: then when I get close to you I tap some attack buttons and then forward in the sonic boom.

545
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,532
Scott: and That those two seconds started while I was wet.

546
00:35:56,632 --> 00:36:00,912
Scott: before I even reached the peak of the jump I was already counting up the charge on the sonic boom.

547
00:36:01,214 --> 00:36:02,460
Scott: whoa I can do the same thing.

548
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,354
Scott: I could jump forward and push down immediately and then do the flash kick Right and then while I'm in the air with the flash kick I can hold down.

549
00:36:09,454 --> 00:36:10,157
Scott: I land on the ground.

550
00:36:10,217 --> 00:36:10,920
Scott: another flash kick.

551
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,686
Rym: You know we need to do.

552
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:12,857
Scott: I could do a flash kick.

553
00:36:13,078 --> 00:36:15,013
Scott: hold Backwards while I'm in the air with the flash kick.

554
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:15,920
Scott: land do a sonic boom.

555
00:36:16,362 --> 00:36:17,930
Rym: We have a holy mission in front of us.

556
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:22,230
Rym: We need to organize the forumides to make a day Bible of.

557
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,565
Rym: Here is all the bullshit.

558
00:36:24,605 --> 00:36:26,272
Rym: to end this tyranny once and for all.

559
00:36:26,472 --> 00:36:27,235
Scott: um ram.

560
00:36:27,296 --> 00:36:28,420
Scott: I'm not done with the gnosis.

561
00:36:29,705 --> 00:36:32,288
Scott: There is more Gnosis, are you ready for this?

562
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:34,076
Rym: I see but I do not witness.

563
00:36:34,156 --> 00:36:34,860
Scott: that is correct.

564
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:37,588
Scott: So I jump in for my punch.

565
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:42,709
Scott: hadouken move right and while my punch is still happening I go down down forward forward punch right.

566
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:49,460
Scott: yeah now if you want to do Let's say you're just standing there in Street Fighter, and you want to punch someone you press the punch button.

567
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:53,898
Scott: Yes, if you want to punch them two times you must punch the punch button two times.

568
00:36:54,038 --> 00:36:54,420
Scott: punch punch.

569
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:58,259
Rym: Yeah, now if I'm a button measure I'll just keep hitting it until I've punched them through jobs.

570
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:01,798
Scott: But you will do a number of punches equal to the number of presses right?

571
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:02,080
Scott: yes.

572
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,592
Scott: So if you wanted to do the game will tell you the instructions.

573
00:37:05,632 --> 00:37:11,110
Scott: to do a hadouken is to do down down forward forward Quarter circle that you know and then the punch button right.

574
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:17,352
Scott: so you would think that to do a punch and hadouken You must need to press the punch button two times.

575
00:37:17,995 --> 00:37:19,040
Scott: that is incorrect.

576
00:37:19,761 --> 00:37:23,700
Scott: You only need to press the punch button one time to do a punch followed by a hadouken.

577
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:32,113
Scott: Because if it is a special move You can use a button release to execute it.

578
00:37:32,173 --> 00:37:37,046
Scott: so I can press the punch button hold it down The while the punch is executing.

579
00:37:37,226 --> 00:37:42,140
Scott: do the quarter circle then let go of the punch button and that let go will execute the hadouken.

580
00:37:42,681 --> 00:37:49,400
Rym: This is becoming more and more like the way you learn how to play an open hold flute where they're like the the decks.

581
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:56,959
Rym: dexterity of memorizing the combinations These very specific overlapping like what path should my fingers take a or B?

582
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:01,436
Rym: Well if I'm going into move see I have to memorize path B instead of path a even though they're both otherwise equivalent.

583
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:01,858
Rym: mm-hmm.

584
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,907
Scott: Huh here is some more minor.

585
00:38:04,988 --> 00:38:05,529
Scott: No C's.

586
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:07,114
Scott: Are you ready for this minor?

587
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:07,595
Scott: No C's.

588
00:38:08,057 --> 00:38:10,469
Scott: so in Street Fighter 4 They have the focus attack.

589
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:23,360
Scott: you ready, so if you press Actually, I kind of like this about Street Fighter 4 is that if you want to do a throw You know it always be kind of hard to do with throwing old Street fighters You have to get really close and press hold forward and a punch or a kick or back in a kick right?

590
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:31,854
Scott: You just push both light punch and light kick at the same time and that does a throw You know and the direction you're gonna do a throw forward or throw back.

591
00:38:31,914 --> 00:38:33,620
Scott: It's real simple to do throws now, right?

592
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:44,480
Scott: You can do a focus attack by pushing both medium attack buttons at the same time and what this does is it makes your guys Sort of flash like right, and they'll start charging up like.

593
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:49,867
Scott: And then when you let go of it they go Right it's a focus attack.

594
00:38:50,631 --> 00:38:52,559
Scott: the focus attack has armor.

595
00:38:53,681 --> 00:39:04,700
Scott: So that means that if you take damage during the focus attack your health meter will go down But it will still leave this sort of gray shadow up there, and you know where your health is miss.

596
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,748
Rym: Yeah, I've always seen that.

597
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:07,200
Rym: I just assumed that was the way they drew it.

598
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,747
Scott: No That gray shadow means that you got hit But your armor block the hit.

599
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:14,860
Scott: see because if you actually get hit you'll see your guy take damage.

600
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:18,040
Scott: He'll go out or fall down or something and then you've taken real damage.

601
00:39:18,664 --> 00:39:27,139
Scott: But if you take if you block the damage with armor Right then it's only sort of this half damage, and you can get that life back.

602
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:33,480
Scott: What you have to do is just you know you if you hit with the focus attack the other guy is gonna be in trouble.

603
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:35,928
Scott: So then you just sort of any.

604
00:39:36,149 --> 00:39:42,199
Scott: as the time goes on as long as you're not actually getting hit for real Your health will slowly fill in that space again.

605
00:39:42,742 --> 00:39:48,982
Scott: So if you doesn't matter how much damage you take if you blocked it with armor as long as you don't get hit before it Fills up again.

606
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:50,969
Scott: that health wasn't actually lost.

607
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,939
Rym: You know what that is in many ways battle balls.

608
00:39:54,901 --> 00:39:58,380
Scott: You're ready for more the focus attack because the focus attack has armor.

609
00:39:58,842 --> 00:39:59,545
Scott: You could you know.

610
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:03,200
Scott: you can charge the focus attack up a little bit a little bit more or a lot.

611
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:11,659
Scott: You know you can charge it up as much as you want and there are some moves that have armor break So that they'll break through and actually do real damage to you while you're doing the focus attack.

612
00:40:12,342 --> 00:40:16,420
Scott: But you know most people don't actually use the focus attack to do the focus attack.

613
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,030
Scott: What they use it for is that armor property.

614
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:22,948
Scott: so what they'll do is let's say Ryu is throwing a fireball at you.

615
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:23,711
Scott: Let's say it's some guy.

616
00:40:23,731 --> 00:40:25,238
Scott: He's just throwing constant fireballs, right?

617
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,102
Scott: What do you do?

618
00:40:27,142 --> 00:40:31,078
Scott: you got a. you know you got to slowly jump over the fireballs and get close to him right?

619
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:31,540
Scott: or maybe?

620
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:39,200
Scott: You can just hang back and continuously jump over the fireballs with timing until he's forced to do something else or the game clock runs out or something along those lines.

621
00:40:40,181 --> 00:40:41,445
Scott: You can use the focus attack.

622
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:46,520
Scott: one fireball will hit you during with the correct timing will be blocked by the armor.

623
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:50,133
Scott: Then you can tap forward two times to dash forward.

624
00:40:50,494 --> 00:40:56,299
Scott: You'll be right in his face Ready to punch him in the face, and he won't have the next fireball ready.

625
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:03,212
Scott: yet you'll be able to just like throw him or do whatever the hell you want right and You didn't even have to jump in the air or dodge any fireballs.

626
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:08,138
Scott: all you had to do is press these two buttons simultaneously to block a fireball and then dash right into him.

627
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:15,900
Scott: and that's that's a move that works and Nowhere nowhere in the instruction manual is any of this explained whatsoever.

628
00:41:16,262 --> 00:41:19,180
Rym: I'm surprised that some nerd hasn't just written like a definitive.

629
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:21,891
Scott: I mean look at there are that but the definitive guide.

630
00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:23,940
Scott: the thing is these definitive guides.

631
00:41:24,622 --> 00:41:26,267
Rym: They're written in an ancient language.

632
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:29,497
Scott: They use a lot of lingo, and there was even a glossary right.

633
00:41:29,518 --> 00:41:32,925
Scott: so An example from the glass lingo.

634
00:41:32,965 --> 00:41:37,538
Scott: It's jargon right, but I mean they for example in the glossary it talked about.

635
00:41:37,558 --> 00:41:50,520
Scott: it talked about You know a cancel or a two-in-one right and it was like a cancel or a two-in-one is when you buffer up one move You know while the another move is still executing, and then we've you look up buffer.

636
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:58,200
Scott: It says yeah, you basically input a whole bunch of commands You know getting ready for them to execute, but it that's not really specific enough.

637
00:41:58,381 --> 00:42:00,476
Scott: It took me a while to actually figure out.

638
00:42:00,496 --> 00:42:02,506
Scott: well like well When do I start buffering?

639
00:42:02,848 --> 00:42:05,620
Scott: you know can I which which things can I buffer up?

640
00:42:05,741 --> 00:42:07,820
Scott: And then when do I actually push the punch button?

641
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,249
Scott: You know I mean even something so simple.

642
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:15,455
Scott: if you tried to teach someone brand-new to do a Hadouken They've never played Street Fighter or any fighting game before right?

643
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:20,593
Scott: you tell them Oh, it's a quarter circle, and then a punch button right you have to.

644
00:42:21,034 --> 00:42:22,820
Scott: what's the actual timing of that?

645
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,680
Scott: How soon after the forward do you push the punch?

646
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,439
Scott: Do you push it simultaneously a whole second after a microsecond after you know?

647
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:33,175
Scott: Do you how quickly do you need to do the quarter circle?

648
00:42:33,195 --> 00:42:34,020
Scott: if you do it too quickly?

649
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,582
Scott: It won't work.

650
00:42:34,602 --> 00:42:38,960
Scott: if you do too slowly then your guys just gonna crouch, and then walk forward a little bit.

651
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:42,539
Scott: He's not actually gonna do the move you know and they don't tell you these things.

652
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:44,589
Scott: Nowhere does it tell you these things.

653
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:58,500
Scott: it is it is just completely Non-explained information because the audience is assumed to already have these ultra Fundamentals and even though I'm trying to practice and learn them I can only learn so many of them.

654
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,075
Scott: I still can't do like Zangief's moves.

655
00:43:01,256 --> 00:43:05,089
Scott: We have to do a 360-degree circle and then press a button.

656
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:08,598
Scott: I still cannot do that move with any reliability.

657
00:43:08,698 --> 00:43:11,008
Rym: well the noses Clearly goes deeper and deeper.

658
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:13,720
Rym: you've learned two of the voices, but you don't have the third and utterable.

659
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,663
Rym: Yeah, there.

660
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:18,127
Scott: There are a lot of voices that are missing here.

661
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:25,666
Scott: right but The point is that there is a gnosis here And it is like it.

662
00:43:26,368 --> 00:43:33,345
Scott: if you bought a video game and the instruction book was incomplete I mean, but by the same token Pokemon are the same way.

663
00:43:33,365 --> 00:43:38,422
Rym: I mean if you want to be the master you go to the Eevee and the IV training and the seating And all that stuff.

664
00:43:38,763 --> 00:43:42,213
Rym: it's basically the same thing the only difference right, but I mean in Pokemon.

665
00:43:42,715 --> 00:43:50,435
Rym: the facts to do this are Immaculately precise that a five-year-old could follow them, but the thing is this right.

666
00:43:50,977 --> 00:43:54,435
Scott: the kind of gnosis We're talking about here is a little bit different.

667
00:43:54,476 --> 00:43:57,040
Scott: right in Pokemon You're not really supposed to know Eevee training.

668
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,616
Scott: You don't need to know Eevee training to beat the game.

669
00:43:59,797 --> 00:44:00,019
Scott: right.

670
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:07,324
Scott: in Street Fighter 4 if you want to beat the game on hard you need to know this shit right that you can beat all of Pokemon without knowing anything.

671
00:44:07,364 --> 00:44:14,499
Scott: see one could argue that number two right something like the fact that you can let go of a button to Do a Hadouken instead of pressing one?

672
00:44:15,461 --> 00:44:16,747
Scott: That is not like some.

673
00:44:17,068 --> 00:44:19,579
Scott: you know Eevee training where you don't need to know that.

674
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:20,723
Rym: well Well that is pretty.

675
00:44:20,904 --> 00:44:35,374
Rym: one argument they could make but I'll say why this is wrong is that you know that's the kind of Mastery that you start to play the game with the basic rules, and then you emergently figure it out, but because it's so Methodical like cancel uncancellable.

676
00:44:35,434 --> 00:44:36,380
Rym: It's so specific.

677
00:44:36,843 --> 00:44:39,260
Rym: It is clearly by design and really should be in the instruction.

678
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:40,859
Scott: It is absolutely by design.

679
00:44:41,302 --> 00:44:44,700
Scott: You know the armor is a built-in thing in the game like nowhere.

680
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:49,880
Scott: Does it explain that if your health bar goes down and there's a gray bar left behind that that's going to recover?

681
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,766
Scott: It doesn't say that anywhere.

682
00:44:50,927 --> 00:44:53,000
Rym: Are you absolutely sure that's not in the instruction book?

683
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:54,647
Scott: It's not in the instructions in the game.

684
00:44:54,707 --> 00:44:56,314
Scott: the game Barrett doesn't even have a tutorial.

685
00:44:56,395 --> 00:44:59,566
Scott: all it has that trials mode You know it's there is.

686
00:44:59,687 --> 00:45:01,051
Scott: there is nothing you know.

687
00:45:01,272 --> 00:45:04,604
Scott: and if you go to the command list right to say How do I do this move?

688
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:06,391
Scott: all it says is do like you know.

689
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:09,784
Scott: it says quarter circle forward with a plus sign And then a picture of a fist.

690
00:45:09,945 --> 00:45:10,808
Scott: that's all it has.

691
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,474
Scott: it doesn't teach you the timing.

692
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:15,627
Scott: it doesn't tell you if plus means Simultaneous or afterwards.

693
00:45:15,928 --> 00:45:17,476
Scott: it doesn't tell you anything.

694
00:45:17,556 --> 00:45:18,400
Scott: all it says is quarters.

695
00:45:18,561 --> 00:45:22,480
Scott: It gives you a picture of a quarter circle forward followed by a plus sign followed by a fist.

696
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,706
Rym: I just I am surprised.

697
00:45:23,726 --> 00:45:24,269
Rym: There's got to be.

698
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:27,644
Scott: that is not enough information for a nub Not enough.

699
00:45:27,965 --> 00:45:30,434
Scott: and the thing is if they gave out that information.

700
00:45:30,454 --> 00:45:35,309
Scott: I think that the level of Skilled play of nubs would go way up.

701
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:37,416
Scott: I mean they still would get crushed by the Masters.

702
00:45:37,496 --> 00:45:38,520
Scott: right, but a notice.

703
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,244
Rym: There's two sides.

704
00:45:39,264 --> 00:45:40,833
Rym: There's knowing, but they're still doing.

705
00:45:40,873 --> 00:45:41,838
Rym: and doing is not easy.

706
00:45:41,898 --> 00:45:42,200
Scott: That's right.

707
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:42,682
Scott: I mean I can.

708
00:45:42,723 --> 00:45:42,964
Scott: still.

709
00:45:43,004 --> 00:45:56,780
Scott: there are still cases right where I just don't have the reflex And I'm trying to practice and build it up like this one trial where M bison has to do like a crouching fierce Followed by a super like super move, and I just can't do it quickly enough.

710
00:45:56,841 --> 00:46:01,553
Scott: I can't make it happen you know even though I I know that I can cancel and buffer it up and all this.

711
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:03,140
Scott: there's no more noses left on this one.

712
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:03,987
Scott: I just can't do it.

713
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:08,426
Scott: no matter how much I try now I'm not like you know.

714
00:46:08,446 --> 00:46:09,729
Scott: um right now.

715
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:12,417
Scott: I'm into this you know and I'm having fun.

716
00:46:12,457 --> 00:46:20,480
Scott: I want to figure it out But I'm not like hardcore into it like I. could I really justify like going to buy a stick?

717
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,424
Rym: Well, it's the question.

718
00:46:21,484 --> 00:46:25,039
Rym: you want to at least find the knowledge to prove that you can do it.

719
00:46:25,562 --> 00:46:26,849
Rym: But then beyond that it's the.

720
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:28,820
Rym: do you want to spend the time to achieve mastery?

721
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,849
Rym: Yeah, so you want to be a master or a professional.

722
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:35,020
Scott: so I was thinking about if I should buy a stick.

723
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:38,168
Rym: You really should at least everything.

724
00:46:38,248 --> 00:46:40,656
Rym: I read everyone even Conrad's into that stuff.

725
00:46:40,696 --> 00:46:41,800
Rym: He plays these games a lot.

726
00:46:42,144 --> 00:46:42,753
Rym: He has a stick.

727
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:47,753
Scott: yes I was looking to buy a stick maybe and I was like oh I can't really justify buying a stick for one game.

728
00:46:47,793 --> 00:46:48,376
Rym: what like 40 50 bucks?

729
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:49,603
Scott: No, they're more.

730
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:50,567
Scott: That's like 70 bucks.

731
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:53,019
Rym: I paid more than that for my flight stick Pro.

732
00:46:53,783 --> 00:46:55,009
Rym: Yeah, but I played.

733
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:57,300
Rym: you know what I played on that flight stick Pro tie fighter.

734
00:46:57,683 --> 00:46:59,757
Rym: That was worth all the money by itself.

735
00:46:59,777 --> 00:47:01,384
Scott: so at first I wasn't gonna buy a stick.

736
00:47:01,465 --> 00:47:09,620
Scott: right, but you know I'm using the Xbox 360 controller, but then right I'm actually starting now that I've learned things right.

737
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,960
Scott: It's like because I did actually always sucked when using a stick in the past.

738
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:17,983
Scott: I mean I played Street Fighter 2 championship vision on my Genesis with the six button gamepad You know.

739
00:47:18,566 --> 00:47:20,700
Scott: so a stick was never really good for me.

740
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:23,499
Scott: I always kind of sucked in the arcade and not good with the stick.

741
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,888
Scott: I would hurt my hands using all those buttons.

742
00:47:25,908 --> 00:47:27,253
Scott: You know get like the claw hand.

743
00:47:27,635 --> 00:47:29,020
Scott: You know hitting those six buttons like that.

744
00:47:30,904 --> 00:47:35,569
Scott: So I wasn't gonna get the stick and I started investigating and I started.

745
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:41,400
Scott: as I played more I realized wow Now that I'm playing more properly.

746
00:47:42,522 --> 00:47:45,120
Scott: Now I understand why the stick is better.

747
00:47:45,421 --> 00:47:48,896
Scott: You know it's like the stick wasn't better for me when I didn't know these things.

748
00:47:49,137 --> 00:47:49,840
Rym: well think about that.

749
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:50,824
Scott: I know these things.

750
00:47:51,226 --> 00:47:54,680
Scott: now this that it's like if you it's like a it's like a whole hog.

751
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:58,556
Scott: Right if you're drilling a whole hog is probably just gonna destroy you.

752
00:47:58,616 --> 00:48:09,080
Rym: if you don't know Imagine a halo only console playing FPS guy Who is just put in front of a computer with a mouse and keyboard with tribes to mouse and keyboard?

753
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:09,966
Scott: He's got nothing.

754
00:48:10,431 --> 00:48:19,545
Rym: it's gonna ruin him But if he understood the value of the mouse and keyboard then he would suddenly have this new tool Disposition that would make him a god.

755
00:48:19,806 --> 00:48:23,036
Scott: Yes, so I'm trying to justify buying like the $70 stick right?

756
00:48:24,762 --> 00:48:28,159
Scott: So this is mad cat Street Fighter 4 stick for the 360, and I'm like.

757
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:30,147
Scott: well I bought Street Fighter 4 for the PC.

758
00:48:30,368 --> 00:48:31,191
Scott: so I researched.

759
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:31,372
Scott: yep.

760
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:32,496
Scott: It works on the PC.

761
00:48:32,516 --> 00:48:32,637
Scott: Well.

762
00:48:32,657 --> 00:48:33,540
Scott: That's good, right?

763
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:43,532
Scott: I found out that this stick is also like made to be moddable like it opens up, and it's Purposefully everything inside is all exposed and standard arcade.

764
00:48:43,572 --> 00:48:44,275
Scott: Why are you?

765
00:48:44,295 --> 00:48:45,660
Rym: you could have fun with that in your Arduino?

766
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:56,059
Scott: I could do lots of stuff with that right also if I get you know like that You know like a computer plugged into the TV again, and you get some maim on there.

767
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,695
Scott: Hello, this you know.

768
00:48:58,715 --> 00:49:04,600
Scott: so I think Because this stick is all moddable and such I could just get this stick and use it forever.

769
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:06,836
Scott: I'd never need another stick you know I could.

770
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,228
Scott: it's USB I mean what.

771
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:10,701
Scott: I could use that for all Eternity.

772
00:49:11,123 --> 00:49:14,213
Scott: you know if super Street Fighter 4 comes out, which it is coming out.

773
00:49:14,694 --> 00:49:22,661
Scott: I'll be all set you know and maybe I'll have a new genre here the maybe I won't suck as much Me.

774
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:26,215
Scott: I still haven't won against any online opponent who wasn't Scott Johnson.

775
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:28,225
Rym: You've got a long way to go I mean you just.

776
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:30,380
Rym: you just scratched the surface of the gnosis.

777
00:49:30,882 --> 00:49:36,060
Scott: I know, but the fact that there was actually a gnosis that was real because usually there isn't like.

778
00:49:37,064 --> 00:49:40,064
Rym: It's always the advanced war situation Game.

779
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:46,900
Scott: since I was in like middle school right how old the Street Fighter 2 god You know I. I've been playing it since that was just Street.

780
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:49,811
Scott: I'll admit I never knew these things.

781
00:49:49,872 --> 00:49:51,920
Scott: apparently these things have always been true.

782
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:56,950
Rym: I always just assumed that I sucked And then I just wasn't good at these games.

783
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:57,833
Rym: that I never would be.

784
00:49:57,853 --> 00:50:03,560
Scott: I thought it was like Reflexes or something that you know like with some sort of natural limitations.

785
00:50:03,781 --> 00:50:11,198
Rym: I was even worried that because Scott was playing this game again that maybe because we're past the age of 22 We're just getting too physically old, but no it's not.

786
00:50:11,238 --> 00:50:11,823
Scott: well We are.

787
00:50:11,923 --> 00:50:25,471
Scott: we are too physically old to achieve a certain level But our maximum level is still far higher than I thought it was simply because there really were just secrets Just plain old secret knowledge that was hidden from us.

788
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:26,052
Rym: well Scott.

789
00:50:26,514 --> 00:50:27,657
Rym: It's a secret to everybody.

790
00:50:27,677 --> 00:50:28,920
Scott: it is a secret to everybody.

791
00:50:35,435 --> 00:50:37,970
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
