1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,778
Rym: It's Thursday February 1st.

2
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:14,767
Rym: I'm Rym, and I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:18,450
Rym: tonight We talk about my experiences with jury duty.

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,071
Rym: Let's do this Now.

5
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:26,796
Rym: being a geek there is something that you'd assume.

6
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:31,374
Rym: you just assume that I would own A Leatherman.

7
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:34,870
Rym: well I do own one, but actually I own a Gerber not a Leatherman.

8
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:36,317
Scott: I need to get a Leatherman.

9
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:37,382
Scott: the thing is it too much money.

10
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:39,090
Rym: Yeah, they're not really so much money.

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,608
Scott: Well, I mean the thing is it's like yeah, you really need one, but then you look at it.

12
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:48,500
Scott: It's like $70 and you go man Okay one for 40 bucks.

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,707
Scott: Yeah, I don't like those ones.

14
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:53,170
Scott: the 70 I've looked and the minimum one is 70 bucks anyway.

15
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:59,631
Rym: But also more important than that even is the simple subtle Maglite.

16
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:16,230
Scott: you see a maglite is a very interesting device in that not only is it probably the best flashlight You can well the best non LED flashlight that you can easily obtain just about anywhere It is also perhaps the most practical bludgeon available in stores.

17
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:20,986
Rym: I mean granted it's nothing compared to that special flashlight in kryptonomic.

18
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:26,309
Rym: on now that I'm finally reading it good God know I want a galvanic Lucifer more than anything.

19
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,809
Scott: yeah Well the thing is you know you got the the 4d version there.

20
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,999
Rym: Yep, I got the 4d mag light.

21
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:34,310
Scott: the 8d mag light is far superior.

22
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:36,910
Rym: Well the thing is I don't need the 8d mag light.

23
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:39,120
Scott: Oh, no you do the same way.

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,370
Scott: you need no you know or gigahertz processor.

25
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,769
Scott: There's the different gigs of RAM.

26
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:48,421
Rym: I could have gotten the 2d But the 2d doesn't last as long and it's not as effective a bludgeon.

27
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:51,270
Rym: the 4d is an excellent bludgeon.

28
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:55,528
Rym: Lasts for freaking ever with the 4d batteries in it, and it's super bright.

29
00:01:55,889 --> 00:02:02,480
Rym: Yeah Here's the difference between the 4d and the bigger ones The 4d and less if I'm just carrying it around with me.

30
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:05,970
Rym: It doesn't terribly arouse suspicion on its own and I can conceal it easily.

31
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:14,766
Rym: Merely carrying this 4d mag light does not in and of itself give a police officer probable cause to look for the rest of my burglars tools.

32
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:20,155
Rym: Now if I'm carrying the 8d mag light I'm definitely up to no good.

33
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:22,241
Scott: burglars did not use the 8d mag light.

34
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:23,646
Scott: burglars use what I have.

35
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:25,130
Scott: well not exactly what I have.

36
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:27,201
Scott: I have the single triple-a mag light.

37
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:28,649
Scott: It is so small.

38
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:36,602
Scott: Oh, man, someone could totally make innuendos about mag light size and yeah, but yeah well I'm holding my mag light right now, but the thing is my triple-a.

39
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:42,304
Scott: my single triple-a mag light is Bright silver and only a crook would get the black one.

40
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:49,170
Rym: ah yes Well, I got the black one because it's all RadioShack head, and I realized suddenly that one I have money.

41
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:51,057
Rym: Yeah, and I don't own a mag light three.

42
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:51,559
Rym: I need him.

43
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:56,330
Scott: I have two or three flashlights, but they're all shitty and They're shitty.

44
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:57,936
Scott: That's all I got to say.

45
00:02:58,298 --> 00:03:06,904
Rym: well also considering that at ToraCon I'm kind of planning on skipping out on the con and Taking a bunch of people who missed it the first time through the Rochester subway again.

46
00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:08,330
Scott: Yeah, you go do that.

47
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:14,909
Rym: Yeah, well I need a flashlight and a bludgeon for this and I've just killed two birds with one stone you have indeed.

48
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:16,796
Scott: Oh, when is ToraCon?

49
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:17,499
Rym: I don't know.

50
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,169
Scott: spring right March something like coming up.

51
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,728
Scott: February's Katsucon at the end of February is newer comic-con if I go to it.

52
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,095
Rym: March ToraCon yeah, so I got to figure it out.

53
00:03:29,116 --> 00:03:30,841
Rym: the uber cons cancelled right yep.

54
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:32,045
Rym: We're good after that.

55
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:33,569
Scott: There's no conventions until.

56
00:03:34,652 --> 00:03:35,356
Rym: Well, I'm going summer.

57
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:35,698
Rym: Well.

58
00:03:35,718 --> 00:03:36,623
Rym: There's a bunch of little ones.

59
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:37,810
Scott: I think oh, when's an amazement?

60
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,637
Rym: I don't know Otakon.

61
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,401
Scott: May sometime.

62
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:41,044
Scott: What else?

63
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:42,170
Rym: Otakon, Katsucon?

64
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:47,050
Scott: All of a sudden it feels like a bunch of cons disappeared.

65
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:53,631
Rym: Well no because we go to all those cons we forget about in the summer like Kinetic Con Anime.

66
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:55,437
Scott: next are you gonna go to Kinetic Con?

67
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:59,630
Rym: Yeah, well theoretically they said we could be staff, but they haven't gotten back with us, okay?

68
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:02,055
Scott: Anyway, so today.

69
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,005
Scott: I didn't go to work, but my work doesn't know that.

70
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:08,135
Scott: uh-huh instead I went to interview for another job.

71
00:04:08,155 --> 00:04:09,458
Rym: How'd that go?

72
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,875
Scott: it went pretty well really yep, and I don't know I might take the job.

73
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:15,377
Scott: I might not.

74
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:16,160
Scott: who knows we'll see.

75
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:25,198
Rym: well Scott doing this cuz I my job's doing okay I mean the money isn't as much as I'd like and the jobs really kind of easy and not Particularly challenging.

76
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:27,209
Rym: I mean someone without my degree could do this job.

77
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:30,990
Rym: And I was thinking you know I should just get more money and work somewhere else.

78
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:35,649
Rym: And it looks like Scott just with zero effort was offered a lot more money.

79
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,085
Rym: Yep, I could probably also get offered a lot more money with zero.

80
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:45,310
Rym: We basically we could probably One point five X our income with almost no effort.

81
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:48,661
Scott: Yeah, well I will have to work more hours.

82
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:53,910
Scott: Oh you mean you'll actually have to work Yeah, and I'll still lose time on the train.

83
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,519
Scott: But I won't really lose time on the train.

84
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:57,610
Scott: cuz I'll get work done on the train like I did before.

85
00:04:58,012 --> 00:05:01,146
Scott: Yeah, I do wasn't living a bad life when I was commuting before.

86
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,050
Scott: it'll be the same now.

87
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:02,848
Scott: So it's yeah.

88
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:05,122
Rym: well I mean riding the train as opposed to the car one.

89
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,489
Rym: if you're tired you can sleep.

90
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:09,627
Rym: Yep - you can do things other than listen to podcasts.

91
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:14,130
Scott: Yep I usually listen to podcasts while doing something else on the train depends on what I'm doing.

92
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:15,537
Scott: Yeah, it does.

93
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:21,126
Rym: You know what if I had a commute on a train I'd probably have a laptop, and I'd probably get a lot more GeekNights work done.

94
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:24,730
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I might definitely make a promo CD like every week.

95
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,149
Scott: I'd need like a web server on the laptop there and stuff who knows I?

96
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,603
Scott: Definitely use the Bluetooth dial-up networking of my phone now anyway.

97
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:33,887
Scott: Yep of course.

98
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:39,484
Scott: I still have Some other job Prospects and as soon as I tie them all up.

99
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,430
Scott: I'll make a decision.

100
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:42,009
Rym: Yeah, I'm kind of waiting.

101
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:52,990
Scott: It's almost certain that there's gonna be some sort of a change at the bare minimum getting paid more money to do what I'm doing Already, I'm just kind of waiting for the one year anniversary of me being hired at my current job.

102
00:05:53,050 --> 00:06:01,610
Rym: Cuz I assume there'll be some sort of performance approach even though in all the jobs I've had I've only ever once had any sort of formal or even informal performance appraiser.

103
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:07,330
Scott: You know what when I was a summer camp counselor that was when I had the most formal performance appraisals ever.

104
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:16,239
Scott: I actually had like graded you on different things like enthusiasm and and Attentiveness and all sorts of shit.

105
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,245
Rym: see they did that at RIT.

106
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:23,423
Scott: meanwhile at the job I'm working at now that I might not be working at too much longer It basically when I was one year into it.

107
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:26,541
Scott: They were just like yeah You're doing a great job.

108
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:27,550
Scott: Here's more money.

109
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:35,788
Rym: Well, they did that to me at RIT once and they gave me all these grades on how good I was and how smartly Dressed I was and whatever and then they bought me a lunch and then I quit that day.

110
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:41,117
Rym: I have a lot more experience quitting jobs than getting jobs.

111
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:41,719
Scott: Yeah.

112
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:43,343
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

113
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:47,188
Scott: I've never quit a job Really?

114
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,227
Rym: Well, yeah, you've really only worked for this one company since you got out of.

115
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:51,670
Scott: so I work.

116
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,177
Scott: I've worked for a lot of things.

117
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:59,336
Scott: I was kind of fired once From why Remember when I worked at that?

118
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:01,926
Scott: Well, I work freshman year of RIT.

119
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:03,030
Scott: I worked at Crossroads, right?

120
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,116
Scott: Yeah, and then sophomore year right away.

121
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:11,670
Scott: I got a job working in Like the student services office of the art school.

122
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:14,690
Rym: Yeah, you had that job for a while kind of like how I had that IT job, right?

123
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,616
Scott: I worked in that office and it was cool.

124
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:23,055
Scott: then as soon as the summer came around I kept that job But instead I used.

125
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:36,785
Scott: I was working like two different student services offices for the two halves of the art school but then in the summer I just got stuck in one half and not the other and then Someone who had had that job previously decided to come back in the summer.

126
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:40,303
Scott: So they're just like, yeah All right, we'll let that person work instead of you.

127
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:41,250
Scott: We like them better.

128
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:54,318
Scott: so Wow, but then base it wasn't really sort of a like a firing because it was like There's someone else downstairs in another office and you could work for them and I worked for them the rest of the time I was at RIT except for when I was like co-op.

129
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:58,010
Rym: Well, I mean I worked at the Ritz and then I quit.

130
00:07:58,231 --> 00:07:59,395
Rym: Yeah, I was just not working.

131
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:01,202
Scott: you worked at the Bellas and then you quit.

132
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:02,948
Rym: Yeah, I worked at that factory.

133
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:03,470
Rym: one day.

134
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:07,262
Scott: This is gonna be the first time I've ever gone and been like I'm.

135
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:12,410
Scott: you know, I mean I've left jobs But it's never been like I'm leaving prematurely.

136
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:18,150
Rym: Anyway, so we don't go too long tonight since we keep seem to be going long fairly often on the show lately.

137
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:21,000
Scott: Yeah, Oh lips and thing has never filled up.

138
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:23,610
Scott: even though we seem to go long every time.

139
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:26,649
Rym: We've got about a hundred megabyte buffer at any given moment.

140
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:35,030
Scott: now that sounds good because I was alright because I remember doing Calculations and it always came out to where we were gonna be way in the hole or living on the edge.

141
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,256
Scott: But if we're not that's cool.

142
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:38,006
Rym: What calculations were you doing?

143
00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:38,389
Rym: when?

144
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,909
Scott: megabytes per episode.

145
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,380
Rym: We're using to calculate megabytes per episode.

146
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,383
Rym: how many megabytes you think?

147
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:51,477
Rym: the average episode of GeekNights is now 40 50 60 45 50 at the absolute most.

148
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,082
Scott: All right, it's not that big.

149
00:08:53,343 --> 00:08:54,225
Scott: So what is the?

150
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:55,750
Rym: anyway, whatever it doesn't matter.

151
00:08:56,713 --> 00:09:01,067
Rym: in the news a Roman treasure has been discovered and I am all a twitter about this.

152
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:02,693
Scott: a Roman treasure.

153
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:05,202
Scott: you say yeah, they found pirate universe.

154
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:06,608
Rym: Um, not at all.

155
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:21,129
Rym: Anyway Apparently they've discovered a bunch of the various artifacts from Maxentius who you may remember from the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, which is where Christianity and paganism had their essential final stand.

156
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:23,615
Scott: Wait, but they won.

157
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:26,143
Rym: There's no Maxentius lost.

158
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,229
Scott: No, I'm saying Christianity still here.

159
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,864
Rym: Yeah, cuz constant it was this last stand between the two.

160
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,030
Rym: one of them was going to fall.

161
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:40,365
Rym: It's more complicated than that But essentially Maxentius was the Emperor and Constantine wanted to be the Emperor.

162
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:44,610
Rym: and Constantine wasn't a Christian But he liked Christianity for various reasons.

163
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:56,749
Rym: so he eventually won the battle due to Maxentius foolishly putting his troops in front of a bridge and then trying to retreat over the bridge and then just basically being Slaughtered while he was trying to retreat over the bridge.

164
00:09:57,492 --> 00:09:58,415
Scott: Those bridges there.

165
00:09:58,736 --> 00:10:03,090
Scott: whenever there's a war game or some sort of tactical game bridges are so important.

166
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:05,200
Scott: Advance Wars bridge is so important.

167
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,943
Scott: You know, it's just.

168
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,410
Scott: how could you be so dumb?

169
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:13,811
Rym: Yeah, but anyway They found a bunch of cool Roman bits and I think this is really neat and I really don't have anything more to say about It.

170
00:10:14,457 --> 00:10:19,421
Rym: I see if you want to learn more about Rome You should listen to the best podcast ever made 12 Byzantine emperors.

171
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,624
Scott: You mean not GeekNights?

172
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:21,768
Rym: No, we're number two.

173
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:31,558
Scott: Okay so this is old news very old news, but it seems a lot of people don't know it because Well, it was on the guard.

174
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:34,007
Scott: it was in the Guardian Unlimited on January 16.

175
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:41,590
Scott: Oh 2003 okay, so it is very old news, but it was just on dig recently because apparently people never heard.

176
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:45,325
Rym: Well, never mind the fact that we've talked about this at least three times on GeekNights.

177
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:46,048
Scott: Have we really?

178
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:50,949
Rym: Yes I don't remember that we never used a main bit for it, but we have talked about this more than once.

179
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:54,765
Scott: Okay, okay, cuz I don't remember us ever talking about it.

180
00:10:54,825 --> 00:10:55,850
Scott: I want to talk about bananas.

181
00:10:57,694 --> 00:10:59,370
Scott: Bananas are gonna be extinct probably.

182
00:10:59,873 --> 00:11:02,828
Rym: Well, the thing is they've been saying that for a long time and they haven't become.

183
00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:10,298
Scott: let's see this was in 2003 and they said in ten years time and it's been four years and Bananas in the store ain't what they used to be.

184
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,282
Rym: So, I don't know.

185
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:11,964
Rym: What do you mean?

186
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:13,510
Rym: They're the same Cavendish banana.

187
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:17,968
Scott: They are but you know, like the stores aren't restocking as much.

188
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:18,911
Scott: Yeah, they are I don't know.

189
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:20,337
Rym: I don't know where you're getting this.

190
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:23,149
Rym: the bananas at the store near us have been the same as they always are.

191
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:27,850
Rym: Anyway, they're a little more green lately, but that's probably just because it's winter.

192
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,458
Rym: They're always a little more green in the winter.

193
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:31,589
Scott: No, I guess I never realized stuff like that.

194
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:33,396
Rym: Yeah, but bananas are the same.

195
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,307
Rym: There's no difference in the banana supply as far as we're concerned here.

196
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:40,100
Scott: downstate, New York Yes, but well, I guess now this is new 2003.

197
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,803
Scott: The only thing.

198
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:46,166
Scott: well, okay Let me sum up the banana story just for anyone did it hasn't heard it before?

199
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:49,138
Scott: on GeekNights Cuz Rym seems to think we said this before.

200
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:52,290
Rym: we talk about this a lot both on GeekNights and in our daily lives.

201
00:11:52,490 --> 00:12:00,818
Scott: Yeah, anyway back in the day the type of banana that was most common was the gross me hell banana Which I really want to try.

202
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:01,522
Rym: I've never had one.

203
00:12:01,643 --> 00:12:12,241
Scott: I never had one either But the commercial banana plantations were devastated in the 50s because there was a Panama disease And the Panama disease killed the gross me hell.

204
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:14,950
Scott: There is still some out there probably but not many.

205
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:20,670
Rym: Well, the reason it was such a bad plague was mostly due to the fact that the gross me Cal was effectively a monoculture.

206
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:24,870
Rym: So if there was something that would kill one it would kill all of them and spread easily.

207
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,261
Scott: Yes, because bananas, you know, they didn't grow them from seeds.

208
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:36,910
Scott: the way normal plants grow the the banana trees You know, they would just split off other banana trees and they're basically all clones with the same exact genetics.

209
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:40,730
Rym: Yeah, they basically originally bred them because people don't like having seeds in their bananas.

210
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:47,827
Rym: They wanted them to have as few seeds and the smallest seeds as possible and eventually Bananas just basically didn't have any seeds at all in them.

211
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:58,221
Scott: Yep Anyway, so the gross me hell died out mostly but the Cavendish Happened to not get killed by this Panama disease the cat.

212
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:02,958
Rym: the Cavendish is also a monoculture and it became the dominant Banana at least in America.

213
00:13:02,978 --> 00:13:03,139
Scott: Yep.

214
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:11,370
Scott: The Cavendish banana is the banana you eat today But only the only reason we still have them is because we spray fungicide on them 40 times a year.

215
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:15,210
Rym: Not just that but there are crazy rules about banana plantations.

216
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:23,570
Scott: There are crazy rules and it's apparently the number one threat is this Sigatoka fungus that will eat all the bananas in if we don't eat them first.

217
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,535
Scott: Now what's the solution?

218
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:31,450
Scott: Well, we can try to get bananas to evolve again.

219
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:48,570
Rym: Basically, the only solution up until now when someone did some trickery that Scott's gonna talk about Was to try to genetically engineer seeds back into the Cavendish or to genetically engineer Cavendish's that are immune to this disease Which a lot of people are against any genetically modified food and there's a lot of trouble with that as a result.

220
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,237
Rym: So that really wasn't an option people.

221
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:53,611
Scott: But anyway, this is a story from 2003.

222
00:13:53,611 --> 00:14:04,041
Scott: But some Honduran scientists peeled and sieved 400 tons of bananas and they found 15 seeds for breeding.

223
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:11,134
Rym: Yeah, I mean think about it It's not perfect that they bred the seeds out so odds are every now and then a seed might just accidentally get formed Mm-hmm.

224
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,790
Scott: But yeah, this is why Cloning is bad and Darwin was right.

225
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:20,810
Rym: Well, the cloning isn't necessarily not necessarily bad.

226
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:30,123
Scott: But if your species consists entirely of clones and there is no Darwinian evolution and DNA You know mutation going on anywhere.

227
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:31,389
Scott: That's not good.

228
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:36,030
Rym: Well, if you're a monoculture then whatever one of you is weak against you're all a week again.

229
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:42,670
Scott: Imagine if every person on earth had the same DNA because we were all clones of this one banana plant somewhere.

230
00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:51,930
Scott: Well, if some bacteria finds a sort of plus-five against human Rude the fact that we have all these different DNA, you know.

231
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,290
Scott: Sure, a bunch of people over there have one horrible condition and other people over there have a horrible condition.

232
00:14:56,351 --> 00:14:58,510
Scott: But as a whole we're gonna keep going.

233
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:00,217
Rym: Yeah, I mean even the bubonic plague.

234
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:03,369
Rym: it killed a lot of people but there were also people who survived it.

235
00:15:03,751 --> 00:15:07,607
Rym: Yep, all right, of course that might have had more to do with hygiene.

236
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:15,377
Scott: and But hygiene I think you could link it back to DNAs, you know only the smart people.

237
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:21,672
Scott: because because the DNA made us have bigger brains and then we were smart We were able to think of hygiene Etc.

238
00:15:22,393 --> 00:15:30,941
Rym: I'm not gonna touch that statement because I don't think the people who had better hygiene during the Middle Ages were particularly more evolved Physiologically than the people who didn't.

239
00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:32,750
Scott: huh, perhaps but they are.

240
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:37,750
Scott: But they were more evolved than the people from before the Middle Ages who did not have high.

241
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:40,321
Rym: Oh, you mean the Romans who had excellent hygiene?

242
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:42,270
Scott: Yeah with their vomitoriums.

243
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:44,377
Rym: Yes, the vomitoriums.

244
00:15:44,397 --> 00:15:49,297
Rym: you actually know what the vomitoriums were used for prevalent They were or what their purpose actually.

245
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:53,897
Scott: even if there was only one of them and it wasn't like I think it was there was Still vomit everywhere.

246
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:55,950
Rym: Well, what's wrong with the vomit?

247
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:56,897
Scott: You can't tell me.

248
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,650
Scott: the Colosseum was had the good hygiene.

249
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:06,130
Scott: they didn't Wob the swab those gladiators with the antiseptic before they got bit by lions.

250
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:09,843
Rym: However, you know what the Romans had that a lot of people in the midget Middle Ages didn't.

251
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:13,528
Rym: aqueducts running water sewers.

252
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:15,000
Rym: Yeah bads.

253
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:19,167
Rym: Taking bads is probably the most important part of civilization.

254
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:19,910
Rym: as far as I'm concerned.

255
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,516
Scott: The Vikings did not take that.

256
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:28,660
Rym: I go to anime cons and I will tell you now if you do not bathe You're not evolved.

257
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:37,468
Rym: Oh burn things of the day.

258
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,104
Rym: So one of the biggest problems I have in my life and I don't have many anymore.

259
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:43,710
Scott: Is that what you got problems?

260
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,770
Rym: You just don't know when I do my laundry, right?

261
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:56,270
Rym: I gotta you know Keep track of what time I put it in and I gotta go take my laundry out at the right time And I have to plan around when I'm doing laundry, especially if I have to go to a laundromat.

262
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,629
Scott: Yeah, I think a biggest problem we have is that we have a washer but not a dryer.

263
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,396
Scott: So it's a wash a whole bunch of clothes.

264
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:05,210
Scott: carry them to a laundromat dry them all then bring them back.

265
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:10,349
Rym: Absolutely fine because I really don't want to put my clothes in those industrial washers me either.

266
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:14,470
Scott: But I do wish I could just put them in my own dryer in my own house.

267
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:17,530
Rym: Well, we could have a dryer but you don't seem to think we can fit one in there.

268
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:19,300
Scott: I don't think we can fit what we can.

269
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:20,569
Rym: it'll be a tight fit, but it'll fit.

270
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:21,858
Scott: I don't think we can fit one.

271
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:30,429
Rym: Anyway, well the thing is There's some interesting good news and some interesting really kind of stupid news all rolled into one here.

272
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:30,850
Rym: What?

273
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:38,190
Rym: Apparently there's a school not gonna go in any details because no one cares where this happened or what school or what companies or anything.

274
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:50,330
Rym: But for the school at this university, they set up a system where when your laundry is dry You can set it up so that the dryer will email you telling you that your laundry is ready.

275
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:51,753
Scott: Oh, that is awesome.

276
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:53,538
Rym: That's really awesome.

277
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:54,520
Rym: Plus one.

278
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:58,530
Rym: I want that in every washer or dryer ever.

279
00:17:59,351 --> 00:18:00,073
Rym: Here's the problem.

280
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:04,849
Scott: I'm gonna quote from the IMU though or text message because email you might not be checking it.

281
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,238
Rym: No, because you could have it email a computer.

282
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:10,610
Scott: that does something you could you could but you see my point.

283
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:14,485
Scott: I want or at least you should have the option to also do IMs text messages, etc.

284
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:18,158
Rym: I just want any sort of Electronic notification, but here's the problem.

285
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:29,347
Rym: quotes the school paid for the $13,000 annual software fee dot-dot-dot By raising the load of laundry about 50 cents.

286
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:29,770
Rym: the cost.

287
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:38,950
Rym: see apparently there's this company called laundry view monitoring service and They provide this to colleges and it's a total scam.

288
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,705
Rym: They set up a system where the laundry machine will email you.

289
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:47,156
Scott: which god That's such a trivial system.

290
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:49,905
Scott: If you paid me you could pay me almost nothing.

291
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:50,949
Scott: I could set that up.

292
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,077
Scott: Yeah, and you know what make it happen.

293
00:18:53,218 --> 00:18:54,021
Rym: even here's the better part.

294
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:55,788
Rym: This doesn't require any ongoing maintenance.

295
00:18:55,828 --> 00:18:56,270
Rym: You set it up.

296
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:57,500
Rym: It's done forever yet.

297
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:06,986
Rym: They charge $13,000 a year and Stupid stupid stupid universities like you know what I will call about the University of Iowa will pay this.

298
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,216
Scott: Oh Iowa there They're all dumb over there.

299
00:19:09,236 --> 00:19:09,940
Rym: They'll pay this.

300
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:19,110
Rym: Hello, Iowa for a service That is effectively something I could write with a bash script and a serial port and a breadboard in about a day.

301
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:23,410
Scott: Yeah, I could make this and set the whole thing up and you would only have to pay me once.

302
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,016
Scott: I would use all open-source software.

303
00:19:25,036 --> 00:19:26,341
Scott: It'd be amazing and perfect.

304
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:27,907
Scott: I would need one server.

305
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:29,674
Scott: That would be like $300.

306
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:30,980
Rym: there seems to be more and more.

307
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,517
Rym: this problem of colleges will purchase Absolutely stupid services for their students.

308
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:56,330
Scott: Well, no, it seems to be a problem all around of all sorts of businesses whether they be Academic service providers or otherwise, you know buying things that are ludicrously expensive Or overpriced because they don't know any better, you know I mean you could do pretty powerful things with technology nowadays, you know, very simple technology.

309
00:19:56,792 --> 00:20:00,629
Scott: I could take something really cheap and really simple and do something amazing with it.

310
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:04,697
Scott: And if I sell you just that one feature You'll be amazed.

311
00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:11,889
Scott: so amazed you're willing to pay a pile of money for it Even though you don't realize it's not that amazing a feat, you know, and there's a lot of scamming going on.

312
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,219
Rym: Well, I've universities in particular.

313
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,672
Rym: one have a captive audience and they have money to burn That's.

314
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:21,914
Rym: or when they don't they don't have money to burn per se but they have money That's always available to.

315
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:26,829
Rym: you know, help out the students and they usually these systems will set up something where?

316
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:30,689
Rym: You take a cut and we'll take a cut kind of like speed trap cameras.

317
00:20:31,392 --> 00:20:33,499
Rym: Yep, I remember RIT fell into that.

318
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,930
Rym: with one of those students can download music for free services.

319
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:38,769
Rym: We just have to raise tuition a little bit.

320
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:47,719
Scott: Yeah I'm sure that every time students go to Iowa to see if they want to become student enroll there that the school is gonna be Like hey, you know, we're so cool.

321
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,689
Scott: are washing machines email you when they're done?

322
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:53,010
Rym: Yeah, and then you know when the students ask oh, how do they do that?

323
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:59,707
Rym: And the answer is we pay thirteen thousand dollars a year for what's probably a Windows 95 box and some cereal parts.

324
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:04,350
Rym: Yeah Yeah Yeah, so that's all I got.

325
00:21:04,852 --> 00:21:13,620
Scott: So for anyone who did not know the car from the first Ghostbusters movie the Ecto one That car is a 1959 Cadillac.

326
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:16,048
Scott: I did not know that me either but now I do.

327
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:21,450
Scott: well Did you know that that car was also used in the movie?

328
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:23,336
Scott: The heat of the night.

329
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,928
Rym: I've never even seen that movie.

330
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:32,697
Scott: There's a movie called in the heat of the night starring Sidney Pottier and Rod Steiger and This car was in it before.

331
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:34,001
Scott: it was in Ghostbusters.

332
00:21:34,403 --> 00:21:34,724
Scott: Of course.

333
00:21:34,764 --> 00:21:36,330
Scott: It wasn't in its Ghostbusters form.

334
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:37,963
Scott: It was heavily modified for Ghostbusters.

335
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:41,697
Scott: Oh, so whatever Yes, it's a very famous car.

336
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:52,850
Scott: apparently when they were moving the Ecto one from one place to another One time they did it on You know an open truck as opposed to a closed truck and it screwed up traffic because everyone stopped to look at it.

337
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,947
Rym: I can see that I would stop to look at it.

338
00:21:55,168 --> 00:21:57,830
Rym: Yep I'd stop and take a picture and then of course steal it.

339
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:05,856
Scott: It seems to be in in perfect working order and it draws lots of crowds whenever it's available at auto shows And that makes perfect sense.

340
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:07,040
Rym: I should buy it.

341
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:08,123
Scott: you can.

342
00:22:08,665 --> 00:22:24,219
Scott: you can purchase the Original and only Ecto one the one used in the first Ghostbusters movie the Cadillac 1959 Cadillac for a hundred and forty nine thousand nine hundred ninety eight For a lot less money than that.

343
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,630
Rym: I could make a car that looked almost like it.

344
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,163
Scott: Well, it'd be tough to get the 59 Cadillac.

345
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,586
Scott: But I imagine the 59 Cadillac that isn't Ecto one would be less than a hundred and fifty thousand.

346
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:35,890
Scott: the modifications I don't know.

347
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,773
Scott: It might be you.

348
00:22:37,174 --> 00:22:42,510
Scott: it'd be tough to figure out exactly what they modified to get it exactly to nerd specification.

349
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:49,479
Rym: Most people you could probably make a car that looked half like the Ghostbusters thing And they think it was amazing.

350
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:58,451
Scott: People are really easily fooled about things like that partly because only the nerds would say hey your car does not have the Ecto Tank.

351
00:22:58,572 --> 00:23:03,567
Scott: blabbe blabbe blah on it, obviously, you know, but there aren't many Ghostbusters nerds.

352
00:23:03,828 --> 00:23:04,350
Scott: No, they're alright.

353
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:08,730
Scott: Well the thing the only thing you really need to get right on the Ghostbusters car is get the logo on the side.

354
00:23:09,232 --> 00:23:21,018
Scott: You gotta have the thing on the roof and you got to make it so that when you open up the back the the hatch In the back that all the power packs slide out that you can put them on Three things you need for the Ghostbusters.

355
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:21,621
Rym: You don't need that.

356
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:22,364
Rym: You just don't stop.

357
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:23,690
Rym: you just drive around town cruising.

358
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:30,476
Scott: Yeah, I don't know that I would notice that and I don't know all the Specifications that was missing.

359
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:31,399
Rym: How would you notice?

360
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,683
Scott: because that's the.

361
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:35,853
Scott: those are the three cool features of the Ecto one.

362
00:23:36,074 --> 00:23:43,970
Rym: so if the real Ecto one's there and they just don't decide to open up the back and show you I can look In the rear window and see that the power packs are not in there.

363
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,369
Rym: What if I have the power packs in there, but they just don't slide out?

364
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:49,019
Scott: Huh, yeah, you might fool me.

365
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:59,787
Scott: I'd ask though and I'd say yes They slide out and then I believe you because it's your Ecto one and you paid $150,000 you have the right to lie, even though I probably actually paid half that and have a fake everything.

366
00:24:00,268 --> 00:24:04,421
Scott: Yeah Those are the three key features of the Ecto one.

367
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,967
Rym: Yeah, I always liked the Ecto one.

368
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:06,570
Rym: It's a little kid.

369
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,950
Rym: I had a model of it and I loved it and one day I threw it down the stairs and it broke.

370
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:12,054
Scott: I didn't have one.

371
00:24:12,376 --> 00:24:14,343
Rym: I threw it down the stairs as hard as I could.

372
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:15,207
Scott: someone else.

373
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:17,239
Scott: I knew had a big one I think I was simulating.

374
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,306
Scott: you could be action figures in.

375
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:18,869
Scott: it was so big.

376
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:22,510
Rym: Oh, yeah, I was pretty big and I put action figures in it and I threw it down the stairs.

377
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,739
Rym: I was simulating some sort of horrible car accident.

378
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:27,390
Rym: Good job, and I believe everyone died.

379
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:35,697
Rym: Okay, so this week I had the wonderful experience of going to jury duty And I thought I'd talk about that a bit.

380
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:50,570
Rym: since we've talked about juries jury nullification Drug laws all those sorts of things fairly often on GeekNights And now that I've actually gone through the civil process I am a little bit scared that I will ever be put in front of a jury.

381
00:24:51,152 --> 00:24:56,990
Scott: Well, I've never had jury duty, but I know about as much about it as the average person.

382
00:24:57,191 --> 00:24:58,943
Rym: Well now that I have gone to jury duty.

383
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:00,070
Rym: I've learned a number of truths.

384
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,510
Rym: But first I'll just tell the story of exactly what happened.

385
00:25:02,972 --> 00:25:06,546
Rym: So I call Sunday night and they say you don't have to show up on Monday.

386
00:25:06,747 --> 00:25:11,650
Rym: Whatever I go to work I called Monday night and they say hello you have to come in on Tuesday.

387
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:18,835
Rym: So I show up at 930 which meant I could wake up at like eight forty five eight fifty Which was great.

388
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,602
Rym: Normally I have to wake up at six to get to work.

389
00:25:20,944 --> 00:25:21,245
Scott: Awesome.

390
00:25:21,526 --> 00:25:22,490
Rym: So I take the day off work.

391
00:25:23,014 --> 00:25:24,908
Rym: I take a leisurely train up to Poughkeepsie.

392
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:27,138
Rym: now I'm kind of miffed that I have to pay for parking.

393
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,303
Rym: I have to pay for transportation.

394
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:29,910
Rym: I drive to the train station.

395
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:33,330
Rym: I'm looking for a parking space and I see a guy pulling out of a really close one.

396
00:25:33,872 --> 00:25:40,015
Rym: So as I'm driving up he rolls down his window, so I'm expecting him to be along the lines of hey I'm gonna be right back.

397
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:41,924
Rym: Don't take my spot or something instead.

398
00:25:41,944 --> 00:25:44,939
Rym: He says hey, man I'm out of here that space is paid for.

399
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:47,069
Rym: have a nice day and I was like you're the man.

400
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:51,927
Rym: I park I buy my little two-trip train ticket and I get my way for the train.

401
00:25:51,947 --> 00:25:52,449
Rym: get on the train.

402
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:57,610
Rym: No one ever takes the train north from Beacon to Poughkeepsie out a week morning.

403
00:25:58,172 --> 00:26:01,385
Scott: Well, there are a few people but no not many now.

404
00:26:01,445 --> 00:26:02,549
Scott: I've seen people do it.

405
00:26:03,232 --> 00:26:05,523
Rym: I was the only one as far as I can tell and they didn't.

406
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:08,036
Rym: I didn't even see a conductor I didn't even need my ticket.

407
00:26:08,257 --> 00:26:09,302
Rym: No, you didn't so I got your.

408
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:10,930
Scott: I think it's only two dollars anyway, right?

409
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,657
Rym: It was five fifty four.

410
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:14,708
Scott: Oh, I thought it was much cheaper than that.

411
00:26:14,828 --> 00:26:16,960
Rym: No, no Anyway, so I didn't have to pay.

412
00:26:16,981 --> 00:26:19,145
Rym: so I had this train ticket that was unused Mm-hmm.

413
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:26,669
Rym: So I get there and I go in and I'm confronted one by the fact that I'm the only one who showed up on time Really?

414
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,010
Scott: Eventually about I think if you're gonna show up to jury duty you'd show up on time.

415
00:26:31,211 --> 00:26:34,624
Rym: Oh a few people showed up on time, but a lot of people showed up after 930.

416
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,436
Scott: Wow Like we're talking 945.

417
00:26:37,436 --> 00:26:39,063
Scott: We're talking 1030 here.

418
00:26:39,385 --> 00:26:40,630
Rym: They're like five to ten minutes.

419
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:44,650
Rym: I showed up early a little bit because I was afraid that something bad would happen if I was late.

420
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:45,315
Scott: Okay.

421
00:26:45,336 --> 00:26:47,039
Scott: Well five to ten minutes isn't really a big deal Yeah.

422
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:54,577
Rym: So I think they planned on starting everything at ten and the Commissioner of Jurors for the county or whatever comes out and introduces How do you get that job?

423
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:55,321
Rym: I don't know.

424
00:26:55,341 --> 00:26:56,970
Rym: Maybe it's elected maybe now.

425
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,590
Rym: They also went to great pains to explain that normally they would pay for your parking.

426
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:13,007
Rym: In fact, they'd love to give us free parking but apparently the County of Dutchess and the state of New York have a very Adversarial relationship with the city of Poughkeepsie and the city refuses to accommodate the courts in any way.

427
00:27:13,027 --> 00:27:14,914
Scott: the town of Poughkeepsie school But the city sucks.

428
00:27:15,578 --> 00:27:17,930
Rym: the town of Poughkeepsie is very upscale and very nice.

429
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:20,039
Rym: We couldn't afford to live in many places in it.

430
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,521
Rym: Even now.

431
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:24,259
Rym: All right, the city of Poughkeepsie is essentially a hellhole.

432
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,129
Rym: I think God we.

433
00:27:27,736 --> 00:27:35,020
Rym: we went up to a heavy metal show in Poughkeepsie one time and They were like woo Poughkeepsie and no one really cheered.

434
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,685
Rym: and then they're like, where are y'all from?

435
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:38,050
Rym: and everyone is from out of town.

436
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,789
Scott: Yeah, they're like who's from Poughkeepsie like three people like whoo.

437
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,221
Rym: Yeah, and it was in Poughkeepsie and the band was like what like.

438
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:49,738
Scott: imagine if you went to a show in say Chicago And you're like, yeah, Chicago.

439
00:27:49,819 --> 00:28:00,226
Scott: Whoo rock and roll people be like, yeah It'd be like who here's from Chicago and most people would be like me You know, you'd ask who's not from Chicago and three guys would go.

440
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:04,598
Scott: Whoo It was totally backwards in Poughkeepsie.

441
00:28:04,658 --> 00:28:06,887
Rym: Yeah, plus there's all those sculptures on Main Street.

442
00:28:07,148 --> 00:28:10,770
Rym: Yeah Poughkeepsie's not the most happening city at all.

443
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:15,670
Scott: It's definitely it used to be happening half a century ago and now not so much.

444
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:23,190
Rym: But I go in and I have to fill out this little form that basically says I assert that I'm not a felon That blah blah blah felons can't be on juries.

445
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:30,812
Rym: No that I'm a US unless you have a a God the thing that waives your civil disability You know.

446
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:37,010
Scott: if the consequences of being a felon weren't so much I might be inclined to commit felony to avoid jury duty.

447
00:28:37,392 --> 00:28:39,962
Rym: Uh, not really because I learned something really important.

448
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:46,390
Rym: I'll say that in a minute I'll go through the whole story because the thing I learned really frightens me, but alright, so we sit down.

449
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,790
Rym: There's all 500 people and this woman walks up and she's like the assistant.

450
00:28:49,931 --> 00:28:53,065
Rym: She's the deputy commissioner of jurors and she explains what's going on.

451
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,030
Rym: She thanks us all for coming.

452
00:28:54,512 --> 00:28:57,904
Rym: She makes a nice joke about how you know, even though you didn't really have a choice.

453
00:28:58,366 --> 00:28:58,908
Scott: Wait a second.

454
00:28:58,948 --> 00:28:59,450
Scott: Wait a second.

455
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:01,890
Scott: There's a deputy commissioner of jurors.

456
00:29:02,613 --> 00:29:06,850
Rym: I will say this the two people are running the show of the the deputy and the real guy.

457
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:13,390
Rym: They look like they have to run all this on a shoestring budget and despite that they were very cheery and very cool.

458
00:29:13,871 --> 00:29:18,390
Scott: Well, I mean, yeah, but you're their job every day is to deal with a whole bunch of jury people.

459
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:19,649
Rym: There's a lot of crime.

460
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:23,722
Scott: Okay, I was like this two people to do that job.

461
00:29:24,104 --> 00:29:25,509
Scott: How do I get the deputy job?

462
00:29:26,471 --> 00:29:32,006
Rym: Yeah, so then they explain that there's judge Hayes is gonna have a trial and judge Hayes.

463
00:29:32,046 --> 00:29:34,374
Rym: this trial could last two weeks If not more.

464
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:35,319
Rym: it's gonna be a big deal.

465
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,310
Scott: What happened to the right to a speedy trial?

466
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:44,609
Rym: So well see the right to a speedy trial is often interpreted from what I've heard as a right to Begin your trial within a reasonable span of time.

467
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:52,490
Rym: Anyway, so and then she basically says this trial could last up to two weeks maybe more probably last about two weeks.

468
00:29:52,772 --> 00:29:55,729
Rym: Is there anyone who doesn't think they could commit to a two-week trial?

469
00:29:55,749 --> 00:29:58,556
Rym: and Almost everyone raises their hand.

470
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:02,930
Rym: Of course, and I actually didn't raise my hand cuz I thought it'd be kind of cool.

471
00:30:03,895 --> 00:30:04,619
Rym: I don't really care.

472
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:16,123
Rym: I'm interested in the process Alright, but then we break up into groups and I you know, I look at my calendar and I realized that Even though my work could not technically penalize me for going to jury duty.

473
00:30:16,143 --> 00:30:23,670
Rym: I am at least going to fill out the form Stating all the possible problems that might be caused by me going to jury duty.

474
00:30:23,751 --> 00:30:27,293
Rym: That way I could at least say that I put forth my due diligence Mm-hmm.

475
00:30:27,473 --> 00:30:32,330
Rym: So I signed this little form that says is there any conceivable reason you couldn't serve on a jury this long?

476
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,969
Rym: And I basically just said here's what my job is.

477
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,775
Rym: I just said my job description and that's it and I didn't.

478
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,005
Rym: I expected them to say that's not an excuse.

479
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:46,484
Rym: get back in there and She looks at me and she says alright your job is obviously important.

480
00:30:46,504 --> 00:30:48,070
Rym: You can go home and I said what?

481
00:30:48,636 --> 00:30:56,387
Rym: She said yeah There's no reason we'd have you serve on a jury Because my job is important enough to where it's not worth taking me away from it.

482
00:30:56,468 --> 00:31:00,547
Scott: for a jury I Rym if you didn't go to work for say a month, right, but they kept.

483
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:01,170
Scott: you kept your job.

484
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,697
Scott: Let's say you took a month's vacation, right?

485
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,886
Scott: What would anything bad happen?

486
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:07,196
Rym: I Bad things would happen.

487
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:08,401
Rym: I mean projects wouldn't fail.

488
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:10,450
Rym: the company would go on as it did before.

489
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:16,266
Rym: I think a lot of projects would happen a lot slower and there'd be a lot of problems.

490
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:24,150
Rym: just cuz I I Mean on a larger scale in the grand scheme of the world me not going to work like people wouldn't die.

491
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:27,330
Rym: No, because I'm not support for all that hospital stuff.

492
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,454
Scott: Yeah all right So but no.

493
00:31:29,835 --> 00:31:34,670
Rym: and basically what I got out of this and from looking at the other excuses people were giving was that if you?

494
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:42,789
Rym: Have a job of any note whatsoever if your job is Anything at all they'll excuse you like that.

495
00:31:43,432 --> 00:31:50,031
Rym: Wow, and it seems like the only people who they would even allow to serve on a jury are the people who want to be There.

496
00:31:50,312 --> 00:31:55,209
Rym: and the only people who really really want to be there are the people who don't have anything better to be doing.

497
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:57,557
Scott: Who wants to be there?

498
00:31:57,738 --> 00:31:59,969
Scott: I mean, I guess if you have no job or

499
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,697
Rym: Well, actually all the people who work

500
00:32:02,717 --> 00:32:03,459
Scott: at McDonald's

501
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:16,435
Rym: all the people who were in the room with me doing me fill out the form That says why you might not be able to commit to this trial They were all basically mumbling or saying to themselves or saying to each other the same thing I want to do it I want to be here.

502
00:32:16,455 --> 00:32:20,430
Rym: This is important, but I just have too much to do in my role in my life.

503
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:21,674
Rym: I don't have time for this.

504
00:32:21,694 --> 00:32:25,345
Rym: hmm, and it seems like the if your excuses.

505
00:32:25,365 --> 00:32:26,148
Rym: I have a job.

506
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:26,650
Rym: That's enough.

507
00:32:27,092 --> 00:32:29,290
Scott: Yeah, actually I kind of feel the same way.

508
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:35,475
Scott: It's like surfing on a jury might be interesting and entertaining and fun And they're you know, it'd be pretty cool.

509
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:39,005
Scott: go see some court, you know decide someone's fate.

510
00:32:39,427 --> 00:32:40,450
Scott: Oh, you know good stuff.

511
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,923
Rym: Yeah, in fact the trials I was up for.

512
00:32:43,185 --> 00:32:45,234
Scott: if it takes two weeks I don't have time for that.

513
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:51,099
Rym: that that like mess up my whole business especially since by law Jury duty is totally a sucker's bet.

514
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:58,528
Rym: if you'd aside from being a juror and all the goodness of that They'll pay you 40 bucks a day only if your employer doesn't pay you that 40 bucks.

515
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:11,270
Rym: And your employer while they can't fire you for going to jury duty is not obligated to accommodate you in any way pay you or Anything other than the first $40 of your salary if you make less.

516
00:33:11,593 --> 00:33:15,320
Scott: So if I was at a two-week jury Assuming I didn't get paid for those two weeks.

517
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,510
Scott: I'd basically lose half of my month's salary.

518
00:33:17,591 --> 00:33:19,373
Scott: I only get paid twice a month So I'd lose one.

519
00:33:19,473 --> 00:33:23,370
Rym: I'd lose a whole paycheck and you'd get 40 bucks a day from the state.

520
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,016
Scott: And you know what I'd be disastrous.

521
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:28,870
Rym: after the first three days your employer doesn't even have to pay you that 40 bucks anymore.

522
00:33:30,311 --> 00:33:31,857
Rym: Even worse when I got the summons.

523
00:33:31,897 --> 00:33:34,246
Rym: now, this is what something that really pisses me off one.

524
00:33:34,528 --> 00:33:41,230
Rym: the summons Obviously wanted to be a Netflix kind of envelope, but they didn't want to violate any copyright or patents.

525
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,482
Rym: So they made this ghetto thing.

526
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:48,380
Rym: that didn't work at all - they don't give you free return postage.

527
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,048
Rym: You have to buy a stamp and stick it on.

528
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:50,490
Rym: the summons.

529
00:33:50,651 --> 00:33:50,992
Rym: You know what?

530
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:51,574
Scott: Wait a second.

531
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:53,321
Scott: that makes me think of something.

532
00:33:53,763 --> 00:34:01,674
Scott: it really shouldn't be illegal for The government to infringe on Intellectual properties.

533
00:34:02,315 --> 00:34:06,145
Scott: and you know, it's like the government wants to make a Netflix envelope.

534
00:34:06,165 --> 00:34:06,887
Scott: Why shouldn't they?

535
00:34:07,068 --> 00:34:17,449
Rym: well actually Scott The basis of modern American industry comes from the fact that our government pointedly ignored copyright law in order to steal Anything of note from the Industrial Revolution from Europe?

536
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,135
Scott: Yeah, yeah, we.

537
00:34:19,215 --> 00:34:22,690
Rym: our country has a fine history of pirating for the greater good of ourselves.

538
00:34:23,213 --> 00:34:29,730
Scott: It's like, you know if some guy, you know invents Let's say a pharmaceutical company invents an amazing drug, right?

539
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,309
Scott: They have a right to sell it and keep other companies from making it and all that.

540
00:34:33,811 --> 00:34:39,210
Scott: But if there's some sort of need for it because usually you don't want the government involving itself in business, you know.

541
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:44,166
Scott: But if there's like a sudden outbreak the government should be allowed to mass-produce that shit all at once.

542
00:34:44,507 --> 00:34:46,368
Rym: But anyway, yeah Here's the even worse part.

543
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:55,087
Rym: The only notice that I am going to be on a jury is the summons that comes about a week and a half Before I'm supposed to show up.

544
00:34:56,036 --> 00:34:57,590
Rym: Now it comes just normal mail.

545
00:34:58,492 --> 00:35:01,169
Rym: I have often gone out of town for two weeks or more.

546
00:35:02,191 --> 00:35:08,430
Rym: If I had happened to have been out of town when this arrived like say this arrived the Wednesday before Otakon, right?

547
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:16,039
Rym: I would have come back from Otakon in the shore to find that I had violated the law by not showing up to a jury Duty summons.

548
00:35:16,627 --> 00:35:16,870
Scott: Wow.

549
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:23,926
Scott: So if you go on vacation jury, I'm sure that if you were on vacation that we know when they came to get you You would say I didn't get the man.

550
00:35:23,986 --> 00:35:24,410
Rym: What do you mean?

551
00:35:24,511 --> 00:35:29,700
Rym: They don't come to get you they just basically Do bad things to you and that basically they warn you.

552
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,310
Rym: if you don't show up your credit rating could suffer You.

553
00:35:32,872 --> 00:35:36,584
Scott: there'll be a warrant possibly sure that when you get back you say I got this.

554
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:38,650
Scott: I just got it in the mail today.

555
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,697
Scott: I was on vacation.

556
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:40,100
Scott: His proof.

557
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,450
Scott: I was on vacation the whole time.

558
00:35:43,612 --> 00:35:46,562
Rym: I mean, you're not obligated to get your mail every day.

559
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:48,690
Rym: What if you just don't get your mail for a while?

560
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,530
Rym: What if you just you don't have any proof that you were on vacation?

561
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,243
Rym: What if you're just at your mom's house and she wasn't there?

562
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:55,530
Rym: you were just bumming there for a month?

563
00:35:55,931 --> 00:35:56,654
Scott: I have no idea.

564
00:35:57,176 --> 00:36:00,328
Rym: It's just it's kind of annoying that they they don't really think these things through now.

565
00:36:01,316 --> 00:36:09,501
Rym: But the one nice thing Even though I had to call this number every night to find out if I had to show up the next day They had the call-in message on the website.

566
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:10,866
Rym: So I just go to the website every night.

567
00:36:11,248 --> 00:36:11,770
Scott: Oh, that's cool.

568
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:12,754
Rym: Yeah, that was kind of cool.

569
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:15,024
Scott: That was the government actually taking advantage.

570
00:36:15,044 --> 00:36:16,008
Scott: technology amazing.

571
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,408
Rym: now I noticed two interesting things when I showed up.

572
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:23,010
Rym: The first thing was that most people seem to be at least minimally smart.

573
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,448
Rym: They were smart enough to understand the instructions of jury duty and to show up.

574
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:30,590
Rym: About 10% of the people there just totally fucked it up.

575
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,830
Rym: They just had no idea what was going on and they couldn't follow the simple instructions.

576
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,970
Rym: There are people who showed up and the Pearson was like didn't you call the call-in number?

577
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,764
Rym: We said specifically you don't have to show up and their excuse wasn't.

578
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:45,157
Rym: Oh, I didn't call the number or oh Whatever their excuse was.

579
00:36:45,197 --> 00:36:48,824
Rym: basically I didn't understand the call-in message So I figured I should come in.

580
00:36:49,611 --> 00:36:56,972
Rym: The call-in message was effectively if your number is between 1 and 500 come in tomorrow at 930.

581
00:36:56,972 --> 00:37:04,150
Rym: Wow, yeah, the other thing I noticed was that the average a what do you think the average age of the people there was?

582
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:06,919
Scott: It's probably mostly older people.

583
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,907
Rym: I think the average age was over 50.

584
00:37:08,907 --> 00:37:21,848
Rym: I There was one girl who looked like she was like 14 So you may have just barely turned 18. and there's this one kid who looked like he was 19 And then I was the next youngest person and every single other person was at least in the late 30s.

585
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:26,707
Rym: And what most of them looked like they were in their 40s or 50s and this is out of about 600 people.

586
00:37:28,232 --> 00:37:33,069
Scott: I guess I know that I probably should you know, my odds of getting jury duty increase as I get older.

587
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:37,050
Rym: Well, also it seems interesting that the most jurors are old.

588
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,180
Rym: I mean, it's just that this area has a lot of old people.

589
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,115
Rym: a lot of people though had to drive an hour or more To get to this court.

590
00:37:42,578 --> 00:37:42,940
Scott: Oh, wow.

591
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,669
Scott: We only had to drive like 20 minutes to get to.

592
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:54,374
Rym: well Remember it's a county court and a state court And in fact one of the cases that I almost was on selection for was for a state Supreme Court case that could have gone On forever.

593
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:57,370
Scott: Yeah, don't just the thing is in New York State.

594
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,989
Scott: It's weird because the Supreme Court of New York State is the lowest state court.

595
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:04,429
Scott: It's it's totally backwards.

596
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:05,733
Rym: Yeah, no I have.

597
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:09,985
Scott: it's like if you commit a state crime The first court you go to is the state Supreme Court.

598
00:38:10,146 --> 00:38:10,810
Rym: There was a chance.

599
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,910
Rym: I had a suspicion that one of the trials that was gonna go on was the crazy murder case that happened in Fishkill.

600
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:16,655
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

601
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:18,043
Scott: I think that might be coming up soon.

602
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,110
Scott: I don't think it was one of those.

603
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,338
Rym: Yeah, well the thing is it sounds like the big case.

604
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:24,572
Rym: they were doing the jury selection well ahead of the case and it was The.

605
00:38:24,773 --> 00:38:27,329
Rym: even the Commissioner couldn't really tell us anything about it.

606
00:38:28,193 --> 00:38:31,850
Scott: So maybe they were getting ready for it because they knew it was gonna come in the future.

607
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:38,410
Rym: Now they also made a point of telling everyone very specifically not to talk at all while we were there about anything to anyone.

608
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:40,822
Scott: No, oh you mean anything that related to?

609
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:49,488
Rym: no just don't have Conversations among yourselves until the trial itself because you don't want anyone to have any sort of pre-existing relationship.

610
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,340
Scott: Oh Okay, so you can't even like say hi.

611
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,923
Scott: How you doing?

612
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:53,626
Scott: My name is Rym.

613
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:55,514
Rym: now the other Living.

614
00:38:55,915 --> 00:38:56,497
Scott: that's nice.

615
00:38:56,517 --> 00:38:57,180
Scott: How's the weather?

616
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,230
Rym: most people didn't seem to bring any form of entertainment with them?

617
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,090
Rym: And they basically just sat there quietly.

618
00:39:03,411 --> 00:39:06,906
Scott: Whoa, it seems like they didn't have anything like magazines there anything.

619
00:39:06,986 --> 00:39:07,790
Rym: Well, here's what I saw.

620
00:39:08,134 --> 00:39:09,250
Scott: It seems like there was this paper.

621
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:17,266
Rym: The older a person was the less likely it was that they had anything with him at all Except all the old people brought their own pens and paper and all that stuff.

622
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:22,390
Rym: They brought supplies For I don't know jury duty, but they didn't bring any form of entertainment.

623
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:26,312
Rym: The younger the person was the more likely were to have something Mode.

624
00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:30,890
Rym: by and large people had like New York Post's and just you know little newspapers and magazines.

625
00:39:31,593 --> 00:39:33,865
Rym: I was the only person in the room who had a book.

626
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:34,649
Scott: Did you see a DS?

627
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,938
Rym: Didn't see a single video game system.

628
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,447
Scott: I didn't play a game on a cell phone.

629
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:41,619
Rym: Nope I saw nothing but like newspapers and magazines.

630
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,164
Rym: I had a book and another book and my One woman.

631
00:39:47,244 --> 00:40:00,718
Rym: actually they were explaining You know what you can do during a trial and she asked if there was any way we could get internet access over the lunch To check on our stuff and the answer was basically internet Blackberries, uh, I didn't see any.

632
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,341
Scott: Yes.

633
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:08,990
Scott: My aunt went to court For a jury duty like a while ago and she said they had like a little room with some computers that had some internet access.

634
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:09,593
Scott: Oh, we didn't.

635
00:40:09,854 --> 00:40:12,930
Scott: you could use while you were waiting like, you know, there are only a few of them.

636
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,460
Scott: But because he doesn't have anything they had that something.

637
00:40:15,902 --> 00:40:22,190
Rym: actually the lady said to the woman Well, if you have a laptop and you can find a jack that works or a wireless signal go nuts.

638
00:40:22,831 --> 00:40:23,373
Rym: Yeah, okay.

639
00:40:23,494 --> 00:40:23,976
Rym: She didn't know.

640
00:40:24,017 --> 00:40:26,267
Rym: like there were jacks all over the room and she didn't know what they were.

641
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:33,690
Rym: Alrighty then I thought about inspecting them, but I didn't want to draw attention to myself by standing up and poking around the room.

642
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,317
Scott: Yeah, then you would have a pre-existing relationship.

643
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:37,762
Rym: You got a weird guy.

644
00:40:37,782 --> 00:40:39,407
Rym: Yeah, I I was weird.

645
00:40:39,468 --> 00:40:42,317
Rym: Anyway God Everyone there was.

646
00:40:42,337 --> 00:40:43,423
Rym: so it's hard.

647
00:40:43,664 --> 00:40:44,890
Rym: I don't know how I could explain it.

648
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:49,829
Rym: I mean, I'm not I don't want to be derogatory but everyone was so just totally mundane.

649
00:40:50,952 --> 00:40:57,587
Scott: No one had anything interesting other than the 19 year old did have something interesting But they couldn't because they couldn't talk to you.

650
00:40:57,607 --> 00:41:01,201
Rym: Oh, yeah I mean, I'm not saying they weren't interesting people possibly but there was.

651
00:41:01,563 --> 00:41:03,510
Rym: everyone looked so generic like it.

652
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,323
Scott: Maybe the process is working like the process is supposed to make you.

653
00:41:07,463 --> 00:41:09,510
Rym: I stood out like a sore thumb.

654
00:41:10,013 --> 00:41:20,812
Rym: I'm a guy with a day stubble long hair Untied wearing a trench coat carrying the god delusion and kryptonomicon playing a DS with earrings Awesome.

655
00:41:21,294 --> 00:41:27,090
Rym: Everyone else was like frumpy wearing, you know, just boring normal clothes.

656
00:41:27,453 --> 00:41:29,270
Rym: Everyone had like a standard jacket.

657
00:41:29,632 --> 00:41:30,074
Rym: They were all.

658
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:33,630
Rym: anyone who talked at all when they walked in was just making small talk about the weather.

659
00:41:34,352 --> 00:41:35,114
Scott: So what happened next?

660
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:40,592
Rym: Well, they sent me home because I have a job and then and then I was on call for the rest Of the week.

661
00:41:40,712 --> 00:41:50,150
Rym: I have might I have to find out if I'm gonna show up tomorrow for my last day But regardless I have fulfilled my duty and I am not eligible for jury duty again for six years.

662
00:41:51,013 --> 00:41:51,696
Scott: So what what's?

663
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:52,479
Scott: how old do you know?

664
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:52,700
Scott: 25?

665
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,133
Scott: Yeah, so when I'm 31.

666
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:57,163
Rym: So now here's the thing.

667
00:41:57,183 --> 00:42:03,290
Rym: when I'm 31 I will have at least the same kind of job I have now if not a more important job.

668
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:10,389
Rym: I cannot serve on a jury unless they change the rules or maybe the people who make these decisions change the way they decide.

669
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:16,010
Rym: but Basically I was told that because of my line of work I am free to leave jury duty at any time.

670
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:17,981
Scott: Well, you know who could go on juries.

671
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:34,810
Scott: like the immediate thing is like, okay The people were probably gonna be on juries or people who don't have jobs like homemakers or whatever people who work at shit jobs like McDonald's or Unimportant jobs, but also really rich people who don't do anything but live off their richness.

672
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,961
Rym: Oh if I was rich, I would have stuck around and tried to get on that jury.

673
00:42:38,584 --> 00:42:40,390
Scott: Yeah, so it's it's kind of weird.

674
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,622
Scott: It's like people would you know?

675
00:42:42,703 --> 00:42:44,030
Scott: normal productive people?

676
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:49,590
Scott: You know the kind of people that are probably peers are the kind of people that are least likely to end up on juries.

677
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:54,214
Scott: Yes, Lee is gonna be poor people and rich idle people, you know I'm gonna sound horrible.

678
00:42:54,314 --> 00:43:07,130
Rym: and I'm saying this more to be funny than to make an actual point if a jury for a crime is going to be a jury of your peers and Generally lower-class poor people are gonna be on juries That might just be a jury of your peers in most cases.

679
00:43:08,123 --> 00:43:10,214
Rym: Yeah Considering crime demographics.

680
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:14,324
Scott: Yeah, but if someone like me goes to you know, have a trial.

681
00:43:14,445 --> 00:43:16,670
Scott: here's a skipping jury duty.

682
00:43:16,911 --> 00:43:19,059
Rym: Here's another interesting thing that I noticed.

683
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:21,930
Rym: there were almost no black people really.

684
00:43:22,171 --> 00:43:25,450
Rym: Oh and yet I know there are a lot of black people around here.

685
00:43:25,892 --> 00:43:29,910
Rym: There's also a lot of Mexican people around here, but there were almost no Mexicans.

686
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,096
Scott: Well, I don't know.

687
00:43:32,197 --> 00:43:38,742
Scott: you could possibly explain the Mexicans by saying this illegal immigration going on Even though I know not all of it is illegal.

688
00:43:38,903 --> 00:43:39,285
Rym: Yeah, though.

689
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:39,949
Rym: Actually it worked.

690
00:43:39,969 --> 00:43:40,130
Rym: today.

691
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:44,529
Rym: I drove past a street corner that obviously had all the day laborers waiting for people to pick them up.

692
00:43:44,891 --> 00:43:48,071
Scott: Wow, but yeah, that's just kind of weird Do they?

693
00:43:48,413 --> 00:43:52,827
Scott: there's no way they can know when they mail out to send the summonses.

694
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:53,309
Rym: I don't know.

695
00:43:54,074 --> 00:43:55,430
Rym: It was just I thought it was interesting.

696
00:43:55,430 --> 00:44:02,122
Scott: I mean, you know, it's not like everyone has those names that it's like, ah, my name obviously gives away my race and creed.

697
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:11,376
Scott: I Will say a Jewish one Avi Avi Goldstein bag.

698
00:44:11,456 --> 00:44:15,399
Rym: Yeah names Avi That is the stone.

699
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,330
Scott: Yeah, or Donna Chang?

700
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:19,614
Scott: Okay

701
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:21,997
Rym: Yeah,

702
00:44:22,545 --> 00:44:22,850
Scott: all right

703
00:44:23,058 --> 00:44:39,364
Rym: But yeah My jury duty experience basically just taught me that I will never get a jury of my peers because no one in my line of work Will get jury duty unless maybe I guess there's a chance that the jury duty place I went to or maybe just this court is weird and maybe it's different elsewhere.

704
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,351
Rym: because the whole time even yeah I'm sure.

705
00:44:41,391 --> 00:44:49,355
Scott: if you went to like a court and say where's a really happening place like Austin, Texas or Where else is happening?

706
00:44:49,455 --> 00:44:50,539
Rym: I don't know New York City.

707
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:52,024
Scott: No, New York City is not so happening.

708
00:44:52,044 --> 00:45:00,028
Rym: You'd get a crazy mix of people there San Francisco or LA maybe the local court in one of those rich suburbs somewhere.

709
00:45:00,048 --> 00:45:08,650
Scott: Yeah Like the town court in the in the rich suburb or something like that I'm sure if you went there, then you would get a totally different mix of jurors.

710
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:13,830
Scott: Yeah, but I I think it speaks more about the Kipsy than it speaks about jury.

711
00:45:14,022 --> 00:45:24,245
Rym: Yeah But I want to ask all of you out there because the the person who decided that I was free to leave jury duty Obviously knew what she was talking about and was well versed in how juries work.

712
00:45:24,747 --> 00:45:25,570
Scott: This is the deputy.

713
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:31,003
Rym: Okay, and I wonder if that criteria is the same everywhere.

714
00:45:31,183 --> 00:45:34,914
Rym: if basically anyone with an IT job because I didn't Try to get out of it.

715
00:45:34,994 --> 00:45:41,437
Rym: I didn't write some fancy like oh, well, I Maintain critical systems in a hospital blah blah blah.

716
00:45:41,497 --> 00:45:46,730
Rym: I basically just said I'm I'm a cable monkey and a supervisor at an IT company.

717
00:45:47,192 --> 00:45:53,303
Rym: Yeah, and then they said oh, well, you can't serve on a jury go home Yeah, and it had nothing to do with the trial.

718
00:45:53,323 --> 00:45:54,590
Rym: This wasn't even for the trial.

719
00:45:54,670 --> 00:46:02,190
Rym: This was pre-screening solely to determine if people had valid reasons to not be on jury duty period not to not be on this case.

720
00:46:02,873 --> 00:46:05,003
Scott: Yeah, this was before they started asking questions.

721
00:46:05,044 --> 00:46:06,189
Scott: Like have you heard the news?

722
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,269
Scott: When's the last time you read a newspaper which newspaper etc?

723
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:10,472
Scott: Oh wasn't it this?

724
00:46:10,753 --> 00:46:14,102
Scott: you didn't even get to the jury nullifications or the.

725
00:46:14,422 --> 00:46:19,999
Scott: that man is likely to judge based solely on evidence And not on lawyer rhetoric.

726
00:46:20,884 --> 00:46:25,810
Rym: Oh, well, I guess the moral is now I'm not eligible to be on jury duty unless I lie about my job.

727
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:26,711
Scott: Yeah.

728
00:46:27,173 --> 00:46:28,599
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

729
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,064
Scott: I probably won't get jury duty.

730
00:46:30,105 --> 00:46:31,510
Scott: Who knows watch one will show up tomorrow.

731
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:31,996
Scott: I'll be crazy.

732
00:46:32,017 --> 00:46:32,584
Scott: That'd be great.

733
00:46:32,746 --> 00:46:34,677
Rym: Yeah Well, I know where the court is.

734
00:46:34,737 --> 00:46:36,003
Rym: It's right next to the train station.

735
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:39,720
Scott: The thing is if I went to jury duty Oh, here's the other interim funny thing.

736
00:46:40,142 --> 00:46:41,208
Rym: So I took the train up, right?

737
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:42,994
Rym: Yep So I'm already.

738
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:44,018
Rym: they keep talking about parking.

739
00:46:44,038 --> 00:46:48,514
Rym: like talked about parking situation for a while and people were grumbling a little bit on Parking.

740
00:46:48,534 --> 00:46:49,056
Rym: blah blah blah.

741
00:46:49,659 --> 00:46:50,865
Rym: I went to leave after you said.

742
00:46:50,945 --> 00:46:53,717
Rym: All right, uh You're not gonna be on any of these trials.

743
00:46:53,798 --> 00:46:57,393
Rym: and she says it's quicker to the parking lot out that way and I said oh I took the train.

744
00:46:57,975 --> 00:46:58,798
Rym: and she says like.

745
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:00,867
Rym: she stopped for a second says what I was like.

746
00:47:01,007 --> 00:47:01,670
Rym: I took the train.

747
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,008
Rym: She's like, where'd you take the train from?

748
00:47:03,771 --> 00:47:05,732
Rym: Like I live down in Beacon she's like.

749
00:47:05,752 --> 00:47:12,381
Rym: so you took the train up here instead of driving and I was like, yeah, it was faster and It was cheaper than paying to park.

750
00:47:12,824 --> 00:47:13,530
Rym: and she was like, huh?

751
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:14,592
Rym: and then I left.

752
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:15,556
Rym: like.

753
00:47:15,576 --> 00:47:22,720
Scott: people don't even think that there's a train to take around because that train is Primarily a commuter train to bring people in New York City.

754
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:28,749
Scott: people don't realize that what you know, that's its purpose Basically, they don't realize that no it has a secondary purposes.

755
00:47:29,331 --> 00:47:29,853
Scott: It's sort of it's.

756
00:47:30,053 --> 00:47:31,216
Scott: it's cuz they're not hackers.

757
00:47:31,497 --> 00:47:39,666
Scott: hackers are the only people who think to use things for purposes other than their main Intended purpose, you know only a hacker would say aha.

758
00:47:39,746 --> 00:47:40,590
Scott: I see that train.

759
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:47,758
Scott: I could use that train to do this in addition to what it is mainly supposed to do and Normal people would never think to do that ever.

760
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,970
Rym: I can't wait to try someday to use that special flag stop.

761
00:47:51,232 --> 00:47:53,749
Rym: That's basically just a wooden platform in the middle of the woods.

762
00:47:54,711 --> 00:47:56,079
Scott: You really want to go there.

763
00:47:56,219 --> 00:47:57,185
Rym: I really want to try that.

764
00:47:57,205 --> 00:47:58,150
Rym: I mean I could drive there.

765
00:47:58,573 --> 00:48:00,650
Rym: I know how to get to that platform on foot.

766
00:48:01,152 --> 00:48:06,370
Rym: I just wonder I want to see how it works to go to the conductor and say I want to get off at breakneck Ridge.

767
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,109
Scott: Get off at breakneck Ridge, you know what happens?

768
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:22,011
Rym: I want to see to bring your neck because the thing is These trains some of them are driven really well and some of them aren't and There's only one platform and it's about as wide as one train door Mm-hmm.

769
00:48:22,493 --> 00:48:28,590
Rym: I want to see if the whoever's riding the train that day can actually hit that platform so I can get off easily.

770
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:35,592
Scott: I imagine they'll miss it slightly or they'll slow down before it and then creep up to it and then the conduct the the Engineer not the.

771
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:37,398
Scott: the conductor not the engineer.

772
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:40,527
Scott: the conductor will flag the engineer and tell them when to go.

773
00:48:40,568 --> 00:48:43,218
Scott: go go go go Stop and then tell they'll get it lined up.

774
00:48:43,439 --> 00:48:45,770
Rym: Yeah, cuz I know all the other stations have electronic signals.

775
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:46,754
Rym: I don't think that one does.

776
00:48:46,975 --> 00:48:47,478
Scott: no no.

777
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:50,310
Rym: No, but yeah, I didn't get to actually go through jury selection.

778
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:54,490
Rym: I didn't get to see if anyone noticed that I had the God delusion on me.

779
00:48:54,971 --> 00:48:55,252
Rym: I didn't.

780
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:59,467
Rym: I was really hoping for some sort of interesting experience and it was just really got a day off work.

781
00:48:59,487 --> 00:49:00,190
Scott: and what 40 bucks?

782
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:01,974
Rym: No, though.

783
00:49:01,994 --> 00:49:04,868
Rym: I I'm pretty I don't know what my employer's policy is.

784
00:49:04,888 --> 00:49:12,922
Rym: either I burned a vacation day and I got an extra 40 bucks on top of that or I got 40 bucks or my employer just paid it.

785
00:49:13,002 --> 00:49:13,624
Rym: I really don't know.

786
00:49:13,704 --> 00:49:15,530
Rym: and they I didn't see a written policy document.

787
00:49:15,671 --> 00:49:16,556
Rym: I didn't ask anyone.

788
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:18,989
Rym: So yeah, tell us your jury duty experiences.

789
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:23,990
Scott: Yeah, you know what these stories are often filled with humor and I know we have lawyers listening.

790
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,697
Scott: So they probably have jury stories also.

791
00:49:25,717 --> 00:49:25,918
Scott: Yeah.

792
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:28,890
Rym: In fact, if you've got a good jury selection story, that'd be great.

793
00:49:29,071 --> 00:49:31,725
Scott: Yeah, also like if you're a lawyer, can you get on a jury?

794
00:49:32,006 --> 00:49:32,710
Scott: That's kind of weird.

795
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:38,590
Rym: Actually, they told us kind of specifically that if you're a lawyer in the area, you're pretty much confused automatically.

796
00:49:39,032 --> 00:49:41,422
Scott: yeah, but what if we're a lawyer not from the area?

797
00:49:41,483 --> 00:49:42,226
Scott: like what if I?

798
00:49:42,326 --> 00:49:42,808
Scott: or what if?

799
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:48,410
Scott: uh, I was a lawyer and now I'm not or maybe I'm a big-time national lawyer?

800
00:49:48,651 --> 00:49:58,210
Rym: Well, one of the facts I read I was I've read all this stuff before I went in the handbooks Basically said that if you have a lot of knowledge of the legal system, you were generally discouraged from being on juries.

801
00:49:58,551 --> 00:50:00,538
Scott: No, is he gonna mess it up?

802
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,482
Rym: I don't know.

803
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:02,867
Scott: I don't make a decision.

804
00:50:02,887 --> 00:50:03,690
Scott: That's too correct.

805
00:50:04,195 --> 00:50:09,580
Scott: I went into this with an open mind Have a good understanding of what reasonable doubt is instead of a vague understanding.

806
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:18,630
Rym: I basically came out learning that it is So trivial to get out of jury duty like you just blink and you're not on a jury.

807
00:50:19,293 --> 00:50:21,784
Scott: So I mean even if that didn't work you could have just gone.

808
00:50:21,824 --> 00:50:22,808
Scott: Hitler Hitler Hitler.

809
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:31,340
Rym: Oh, well that might mean if you do it, obviously it stupidly like that the judge and fried you say all right asshole contempt You're not on the jury.

810
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:31,501
Scott: Now.

811
00:50:31,521 --> 00:50:37,310
Rym: You're contempted punned No, I can see you know, especially with some stupid chintzy child be like you're on this jury.

812
00:50:39,254 --> 00:50:39,848
Rym: That'd be great.

813
00:50:40,553 --> 00:50:41,740
Rym: But no, you got to be more subtle.

814
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,190
Rym: you just stand up and say, you know at the end They always ask you some sort of question.

815
00:50:45,312 --> 00:50:52,290
Rym: I hear tell like Can you think of any reason why you could not serve on this jury and give an objective blah blah blah and at that point?

816
00:50:52,550 --> 00:51:10,614
Rym: regardless of your feelings you just say I Feel the need to inform the court that I am aware of the idea of jury nullification and I feel that I could not Separate my logical decision from my knowledge of this and therefore I want to make it known to the court so that you can decide Accordingly.

817
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:18,365
Rym: if you want me to be on this jury knowing full Well, my personal love love love love love and basically keep talking to the lawyers laughs as they get the hell out of here.

818
00:51:18,385 --> 00:51:20,900
Scott: I Don't know if that would work.

819
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:23,837
Rym: probably I Would bet money that it would work.

820
00:51:23,978 --> 00:51:24,742
Scott: it might it might.

821
00:51:24,863 --> 00:51:25,144
Scott: of course

822
00:51:25,164 --> 00:51:28,330
Rym: if they don't ask that question I don't think you should stand up and say well

823
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:37,688
Scott: I think if I just if I ever went in for anything I would just answer everything honestly and let them do whatever they want because you know, what's the worst possible thing?

824
00:51:37,889 --> 00:51:40,369
Scott: Oh, Jimmy Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh.

825
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:44,930
Rym: So like I'm sitting there right and someone dropped a pair of leather gloves by the front.

826
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:53,370
Rym: So so the Commissioner comes out the guy and he picks him up and he looks around and I see him.

827
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:57,430
Rym: So I'm just gonna looking around the room and he smirks for a second and then the smirk goes away.

828
00:51:58,552 --> 00:51:59,577
Rym: Then he goes back to his desk.

829
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,050
Rym: He putzes around for a while like he's planning it out.

830
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:06,325
Rym: Then he walks up to the front of the room and says did anyone lose the pair of leather gloves?

831
00:52:06,847 --> 00:52:08,557
Rym: and without a beat He says don't worry.

832
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:14,529
Rym: We're not gonna make you try him on And I I lo I just lost it.

833
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:25,386
Scott: It sounds to me like the Commissioner of Jurors in Poughkeepsie, New York And the deputy Commissioner of Jurors are the awesome and they make their crap as jobs.

834
00:52:25,486 --> 00:52:26,930
Scott: entertaining in some way.

835
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:29,524
Rym: He was a jolly funny chubby cool guy.

836
00:52:29,544 --> 00:52:33,210
Scott: I Kind of want that job, but I don't think I should take it away from him.

837
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,655
Scott: I should be the fun jolly Commissioner of Jurors somewhere else I don't think.

838
00:52:36,675 --> 00:52:38,149
Scott: where the Commission of Jurors is an asshole.

839
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:45,173
Rym: I get the impression that we make more money doing what we do now than we would ever make in any sort of local Governmental role.

840
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:47,361
Scott: but wouldn't that be fun being the Commissioner of Jurors?

841
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:50,739
Scott: You see all those people every day and yeah You know, it might be.

842
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,110
Rym: see it's always the crazy.

843
00:52:52,271 --> 00:52:56,009
Scott: I could maybe you could do that fun thing like Commissioner of Jurors for a day.

844
00:52:56,856 --> 00:52:59,601
Scott: ha There might be like mayor for a day.

845
00:52:59,621 --> 00:53:01,670
Rym: I could see legal problems with that.

846
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:05,370
Scott: I wonder what other interesting civic jobs there are that you don't even realize they exist.

847
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:10,430
Scott: Like I didn't even know till just now like I knew it, but I didn't consciously know.

848
00:53:10,711 --> 00:53:13,560
Scott: There's a guy whose job it is to deal with juries every day.

849
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,563
Scott: That's his only job.

850
00:53:15,084 --> 00:53:17,692
Scott: and uh now I understand Oh, there's a guy.

851
00:53:18,314 --> 00:53:20,300
Scott: Is there a guy who does something else crazy?

852
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:20,962
Scott: I don't know about.

853
00:53:21,483 --> 00:53:26,521
Rym: maybe I can guarantee at any rate We'll find out if I have to go to jury duty tonight tomorrow.

854
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:28,890
Rym: I'll bet no, but you never know.

855
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:34,167
Rym: I got a call in the number again and make sure yep, and unless something crazy happens.

856
00:53:34,187 --> 00:53:34,969
Rym: I think that's it.

857
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,929
Scott: Are we gonna go to work tomorrow?

858
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:37,972
Rym: We'll see.

859
00:53:38,394 --> 00:53:41,067
Rym: but in any case tell us your funny jury stories.

860
00:53:41,188 --> 00:53:41,590
Rym: see this one.

861
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:47,410
Rym: I wish we had a live kind of ISDN line and a live radio show people call Intel's funny jury duty story.

862
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,861
Rym: We could basically just do pendulate show only with us.

863
00:53:49,881 --> 00:53:50,645
Scott: Yeah, it sucks.

864
00:53:50,866 --> 00:53:51,710
Rym: We could do it once a week.

865
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:52,353
Rym: That would be funny.

866
00:53:52,393 --> 00:53:55,770
Scott: I think yeah, I'm just looking forward to the shows you can do next week.

867
00:53:56,192 --> 00:54:00,430
Rym: Yeah, we got some good shows lined up as always and of course Katsucon is coming up.

868
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,448
Rym: I didn't mention it much yesterday, right, right, right?

869
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:06,450
Rym: We'll talk about it next week, but look it up Katsucon calm.

870
00:54:07,091 --> 00:54:10,403
Rym: It's a great convention and anime con with some good gaming at it in.

871
00:54:10,464 --> 00:54:12,090
Scott: we're gonna rock the house at it.

872
00:54:12,372 --> 00:54:13,439
Rym: Oh, are we going to rock?

873
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:14,084
Rym: We're pretty much gonna.

874
00:54:14,104 --> 00:54:17,221
Scott: We're not gonna rock the house We're gonna rock the hotel the whole thing us too.

875
00:54:17,261 --> 00:54:18,749
Scott: We're gonna rock the whole thing back and forth.

876
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:24,126
Rym: also I just confirmed my staff position again at an amazement which I think is in May in North Carolina.

877
00:54:24,507 --> 00:54:26,956
Rym: if you're gonna be there I'll at least be there.

878
00:54:27,558 --> 00:54:28,581
Rym: Maybe Scott will be there.

879
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:29,866
Rym: We're thinking about that if I go.

880
00:54:29,906 --> 00:54:30,890
Scott: What's my position there?

881
00:54:31,761 --> 00:54:32,291
Rym: I don't know I could.

882
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:32,693
Rym: we'll see.

883
00:54:32,733 --> 00:54:38,099
Rym: we could talk because they need smart intelligent people and to if nothing else We could do all this stuff.

884
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,867
Rym: or are you gonna do it Katsucon?

885
00:54:39,887 --> 00:54:42,250
Rym: Yeah Alright, alright.
