1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,155
Rym: It's Thursday November 2nd.

2
00:00:11,536 --> 00:00:13,923
Rym: I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:18,270
Rym: Tonight with the upcoming US midterm elections We talk a little bit about politics.

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,707
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:24,336
Rym: Today I actually had some work to do.

6
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:28,670
Scott: Oh my god, cuz I didn't have work to do and I left work early to go buy.

7
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:31,869
Scott: Shit, we desperately needed and did not have an opportunity to go buy.

8
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:38,730
Rym: Though by having work to do I ended up being in Mount Vernon today and I ended up being in an area that is Predominantly Hispanic.

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,221
Rym: Now the interesting thing is I needed some food.

10
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:43,145
Rym: So I just wander out.

11
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:44,430
Rym: I'm looking for a deli or something.

12
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:45,135
Rym: I see a deli.

13
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:48,213
Rym: I just walk in stand in line get to the front I go to order.

14
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:51,989
Rym: then I realize that I'm the only one in this place who speaks English.

15
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,479
Scott: Oh my god, everything's in Spanish.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,899
Rym: the menus in Spanish on the wall the Owners and employees.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,709
Rym: none of them speak English at all.

18
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:05,447
Scott: You know, I haven't, you know taken a Spanish class since high school.

19
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:07,124
Scott: high school I took two years of Spanish.

20
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:07,630
Scott: middle school.

21
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:22,050
Scott: I took three years and since then not so much but I still find I can kind of read a Spanish newspaper I guess like a Spanish elementary school kid maybe and I probably could order food in a Spanish restaurant.

22
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:25,198
Scott: But yeah, that's that's pretty interesting there.

23
00:01:25,278 --> 00:01:25,439
Scott: Yeah.

24
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:25,760
Rym: Well, it was.

25
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:39,402
Rym: it was interesting that no one spoke English at all Which is something I've never actually run into in this country before Where I went to a place of business and tried to conduct business and I was unable to Because the people owning the business did not speak my language.

26
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:41,230
Scott: Yeah, I mean they guys speak English.

27
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,837
Scott: I mean, I've never encountered some.

28
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:53,830
Scott: I've encountered people who can't speak English at all but they're usually people directly from foreign countries like vacationing someone or You know someone from an older generation.

29
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,095
Rym: Well, I have another little.

30
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:57,490
Rym: I have a beef though before I get into what actually happened.

31
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:00,620
Rym: Alright the the sign outside said it was a deli.

32
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:02,405
Rym: I went in because I wanted to sub.

33
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:03,950
Rym: it wasn't a deli.

34
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:15,850
Rym: They only had like tacos and burritos awesome, so and I didn't want to walk out because that was awkward even though it's awkward enough that everyone's just kind of staring at Me and I'm obviously this guy.

35
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,770
Rym: It doesn't speak the language and I didn't want to leave because I thought that would be rude.

36
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:35,030
Rym: so eventually it turns out one of the other customers spoke enough English to Translate to the patron or the proprietor that I wanted a chicken burrito Which in the end was really really good and really really big and it was only like three bucks.

37
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,355
Scott: I imagine it would be.

38
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,137
Scott: it was.

39
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:40,590
Rym: it wasn't as good as the cafe Maya, but it was three bucks.

40
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:44,872
Rym: I pay more than that for a slice of pizza and sometimes Great.

41
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:49,714
Rym: All right, but then more much more interestingly I I work.

42
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:53,950
Rym: I go to these two big hospitals to do a whole bunch of work and that you need diseases.

43
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:54,988
Rym: I hope not.

44
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,458
Rym: But though at one point I dropped a pen on the floor in one of these data Closets and the guy was like I go to reach it.

45
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:03,366
Rym: the guy says don't pick anything up off the floor.

46
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:05,173
Rym: Here's the new pen Mm-hmm.

47
00:03:05,193 --> 00:03:06,926
Rym: He's like don't touch the floor here.

48
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:10,708
Rym: You'll get sick Wasn't the best hospital I was in?

49
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,050
Rym: Okay, well at least the first hospital one was better.

50
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,653
Rym: But the cool thing is while I was that I've never been in a not nice Hospital like.

51
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:21,827
Scott: I went to a hospital once that looked not nice on the outside like outside the hospital.

52
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:22,570
Scott: I was like, huh?

53
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:26,710
Scott: This looks like a shady hospital, but inside it was nice hospital.

54
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,610
Scott: I mean it was gone.

55
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,529
Rym: It wasn't any dirtier than any other hospital that I've worked in.

56
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:30,951
Rym: It's just.

57
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:36,070
Rym: no one had ever specifically warned me against touching the floor before and I've been in operating rooms.

58
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:36,495
Rym: Maybe

59
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:39,880
Scott: that was just a scared, dude You know the kind of people are afraid of germs all the time or

60
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,965
Rym: you might just been making a joke

61
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:42,575
Scott: or maybe he's making A joke, but

62
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:51,929
Rym: the point is while I was working I met a cool guy who you know I'm just making small talk while I'm doing my business and he's showing me around and Unlocking all these places I have to get into to do my business.

63
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:54,242
Rym: And we're talking a bit about hobbies.

64
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:56,452
Rym: and I mentioned yeah, blah blah blah Convention.

65
00:03:56,492 --> 00:03:59,963
Rym: whenever I talk about my hobbies most people in the world.

66
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:04,828
Rym: I interact with in my job Do not understand geekery at all.

67
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:17,236
Rym: So when I say like normally if I meet someone I'm cool, I'll be like, yeah I was just at an anime con or yeah, I do a podcast but to normal muggles I say things like yeah I speak at Japanese muggles.

68
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:17,577
Scott: Yes.

69
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:18,279
Rym: I said muggles.

70
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:19,704
Rym: I speak it.

71
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:31,209
Rym: nor I speak at a Japanese cultural or Japanese film Conventions or Japanese film and animation things and I do an internet radio show or something like that.

72
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:39,381
Rym: but I mentioned blah blah blah Japanese blah and the guys like Like Katsu Kanon Otakon ride and all that and we start talking.

73
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:42,330
Rym: He's kind of an anime fan and he wants to start a podcast.

74
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:44,637
Scott: What kind of other hobbies did he have?

75
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:45,821
Rym: We talked a bit.

76
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:46,744
Rym: He's into computers.

77
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:47,948
Rym: No, he's an IT guy.

78
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:48,570
Rym: He knows a lot.

79
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,909
Rym: He doesn't isn't so big in Linux, but he wants to be.

80
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:53,638
Scott: Where does it live?

81
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:54,969
Rym: somewhere in the city?

82
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:57,950
Rym: I'm not gonna tell this guy's life story on the show.

83
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:12,105
Rym: I just thought it was cool that perhaps the for the first time in many years of employment I met another geek in the course of my work No a geek who seemed to know what he was talking about about technology.

84
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:16,945
Rym: because most of the people I end up Meeting in my work don't really know much about what the job is.

85
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:17,910
Rym: They're supposed to be doing.

86
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:18,934
Scott: That's just what it is.

87
00:05:18,974 --> 00:05:22,730
Scott: Like as these old people go out, you know, then we're just we're on the edge.

88
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,190
Scott: We're the young people coming in who know what we're talking about.

89
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,982
Scott: And we just got a more of us got to get in there.

90
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:32,178
Scott: because yeah, many of us are Knowing but not getting jobs.

91
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:33,643
Scott: They're just being bums.

92
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:35,589
Scott: I know a lot of people being bummed.

93
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:36,295
Rym: Yeah Yeah, we do.

94
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:42,749
Scott: we could call them out by name Yeah Go get jobs so that we can infiltrate the workforce faster and get rid of the old.

95
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:59,789
Rym: more Importantly to all of you out there who are friends of mine who are good at technology particularly computers I Get a pile of money if you work for my company and you also get a pile of money and by a pile I mean multiple thousands, so I want that money.

96
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:05,790
Scott: That's all I got to say Rym not yet wealthy enough to say himself.

97
00:06:06,252 --> 00:06:10,230
Rym: No, no, the thing is I get almost everything I want out of life.

98
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,478
Rym: I don't need much more money to live a perfect life.

99
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:18,030
Rym: And if I didn't have my school debt, which is rapidly going away I'd be living in luxury as far as I'm concerned.

100
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:25,099
Scott: Well, the thing is I could always do with more money But the thing is to improve my life I would need so much more money.

101
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:27,410
Scott: like it used to be I needed a house in a car.

102
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,574
Scott: Well now I have a house in a car.

103
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:32,570
Scott: So how much money more would it take to significantly improve my life?

104
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,510
Scott: Yeah, the probably it would take like five hundred thousand dollars to buy a wicked house.

105
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:38,730
Scott: I mean it said I don't get five hundred thousand dollars.

106
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,568
Scott: I'm basically it doesn't change my life at all.

107
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:51,290
Rym: The sad truth is that the next step to make us more happy in terms of you know money and physical Possessions and lifestyle would to be it to be to be independently wealthy.

108
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:54,767
Scott: Yeah, I got to remove the debt or remove the job somehow.

109
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:55,189
Scott: Yeah.

110
00:06:56,497 --> 00:07:03,950
Rym: So we can't be happier physically Unless we have independent wealth or like Ferraris and mansions and shit.

111
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:08,030
Scott: But even then that doesn't make me that much happier compared to how much money it got.

112
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,530
Rym: You know, what made me the most happy is being independently wealthy and having all that free time.

113
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:19,938
Scott: Yeah, I think the only real thing I could buy would be like vacations constantly just traveling around the world crazily Yeah, but I can't afford that with a job.

114
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:20,500
Scott: Yeah.

115
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:21,222
Scott: Yeah.

116
00:07:21,543 --> 00:07:22,446
Rym: Well, no I can afford it.

117
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,650
Rym: I can't afford the time.

118
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:24,908
Scott: Yeah that too.

119
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:31,638
Rym: I mean we could Scott and I could right now just like go to the airport and fly to Greece and Then we can get back to.

120
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,947
Scott: yeah, that's about it.

121
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,430
Scott: It's like a thousand-something dollar plane ticket.

122
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:40,369
Rym: Yeah, we can live there for a while too and we could pay off that debt pretty handily with Greek money.

123
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:43,996
Rym: I'm not saying move to Greece.

124
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:45,582
Rym: I'm saying fly there stay there.

125
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:46,807
Rym: We fly back.

126
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:51,590
Scott: Okay Work in Greece to pay off our American debt.

127
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:54,243
Rym: We just go on a two-week vacation in Greece.

128
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:55,350
Rym: on like my credit card.

129
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,278
Scott: Did they use euros in Greece or something else?

130
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:58,423
Rym: They're part of the EU.

131
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,150
Scott: I think I gotta go check on that.

132
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:05,630
Rym: Yeah, I gotta admit I haven't been paying attention to modern European politics, it's so weird.

133
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,558
Scott: It's like I know all about old Greece relatively.

134
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,401
Scott: I know a lot.

135
00:08:10,063 --> 00:08:12,610
Rym: Yeah, shall we have quiz time with Rym and Scott?

136
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,570
Scott: No, because I just read I know more about old Greece and I know nothing about new Greece.

137
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,660
Scott: I know nothing about what Greece is like right now at all.

138
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,830
Rym: Where did Alexander the Great come from?

139
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:23,813
Scott: Greece no.

140
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:27,970
Rym: No, he came from a Greek ish nation to the north of Greece.

141
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,058
Rym: Whatever who is his dad?

142
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:36,990
Rym: Rym the grim the not-so-great Anyway was Archimedes Greek.

143
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:39,306
Scott: He had a principal.

144
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,076
Rym: Okay, I I just.

145
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:48,865
Rym: it's funny because yesterday I read a long Wikipedia on something in Greece and now Greece is coming up a lot in our lives.

146
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,881
Scott: Oh better get some some more sandwiches Sandwiches not Greek fire of the gyro nature.

147
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:59,214
Rym: You could have said Greek fire, but you said sandwich Damascus steel.

148
00:08:59,315 --> 00:08:59,535
Rym: Okay.

149
00:08:59,656 --> 00:08:59,876
Rym: Okay.

150
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:00,459
Rym: I'm down with that.

151
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:00,880
Rym: All right.

152
00:09:01,301 --> 00:09:03,369
Rym: Anyway, that was a crazy tangent.

153
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:06,017
Scott: I got some great news.

154
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,220
Rym: I got some interesting news.

155
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,461
Scott: All right.

156
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:13,757
Scott: Well our favorite professional sport Is ice hockey.

157
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,930
Scott: and well ice hockey is not doing so well.

158
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,370
Scott: I mean, it's not as popular as any other professional sport in the country.

159
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:22,880
Scott: I mean pretty much.

160
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:28,223
Scott: you got football at the top Then you got your basketballs and your baseballs and all that stuff.

161
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:30,450
Rym: granted baseball seems to be dropping like a rock.

162
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:37,130
Scott: Yeah, that's you got your NASCAR's doing pretty well, but you know of all of them NHL not doing so.

163
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:43,280
Scott: Well, you know, the only thing is doing worse than the NHL are like, you know We golf is doing better than the NHL.

164
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:45,530
Rym: Well, but I mean think about it in these terms.

165
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:51,423
Rym: This is what I really think Differentiates hockey from many other professional sports in the US and Canada.

166
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:53,630
Rym: is that in every other sport?

167
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:59,667
Rym: it seems many of the players do it more for the money than for the love of the game and hockey players.

168
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:04,402
Rym: when there's no Hockey or something happens or they can't play their hockey.

169
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:07,374
Rym: They just go play hockey somewhere else Even if they don't get paid.

170
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:08,902
Scott: that's something I always liked about hockey.

171
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,309
Scott: is I asked my dad once you know.

172
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:14,167
Scott: Hey, wait a minute those NHL guys, you know when there was that strike.

173
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:16,962
Scott: All right Why did they go and play in Europe?

174
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,290
Scott: It's like they're hockey players.

175
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:27,050
Scott: They just want to play hockey and then when the hockey players are in the Olympics You know, there's the Olympic break and they go play in the Olympics and I'm like, why would you try hard in the Olympics?

176
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,750
Scott: Wouldn't you just get tired out and then not be able to play in the Stanley Cup?

177
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,583
Scott: He's like, they're crazy hockey players.

178
00:10:31,603 --> 00:10:32,490
Scott: They just want to play hockey.

179
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:41,148
Rym: Yeah, but I mean while hockey isn't doing well in terms of making a lot of profit It's doing well in that it supports itself and all the people who like hockey can get their hockey.

180
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:54,378
Scott: Yep Anyway, because NHL obviously knows it's having problems, you know outside of the big teams that are really popular A lot of the other teams Not too many people care about at all.

181
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:57,547
Scott: And they're just basically fodder for the real teams.

182
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:58,470
Scott: quote real teams.

183
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:01,236
Scott: So what have they done?

184
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,610
Scott: something that is pure genius that I've been begging.

185
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:12,527
Scott: Every single sport that exists to do and I think Formula One the sport that should do it The most is gonna be the last one to do it.

186
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:24,195
Scott: but regardless if you go to video Google dot-com slash NHL dot HTML you can watch Hockey for free.

187
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:30,030
Scott: now NHL pretty much said all the hockey videos on Google video are awesome.

188
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:36,088
Scott: You can watch the Rangers game from two or three days ago on Google video just right off MSG.

189
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:45,880
Rym: now I the only reason I don't watch a lot of hockey is that I really don't like television and it's not worth the money To have it even if it were just a hockey machine.

190
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,783
Scott: I mean think about it.

191
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,490
Scott: We could get cable television, right?

192
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,041
Scott: What would we watch on cable television?

193
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:50,444
Scott: hockey?

194
00:11:50,484 --> 00:12:00,442
Scott: We would watch hockey I might watch an f1 race and I might watch like I don't even know if I'd watch the Super Bowl if my Might what I might watch like Battlestar Galactica.

195
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:05,250
Rym: The problem is wouldn't while I would watch all that stuff I would totally TiVo it and watch it.

196
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:10,764
Scott: Most of those things like Simpsons South Park Futurama all that shit.

197
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:13,130
Scott: We Netflix that we don't need a TV for that.

198
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,414
Scott: Netflix is way cheaper.

199
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:18,989
Scott: Yeah, because he would be paying that was it like 40 bucks a month more than that.

200
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:30,650
Scott: Yeah Just to watch hockey game, which wouldn't be that bad Except that also I don't have that much time and I don't really have time for it and not all the rituals.

201
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,941
Scott: Yeah, and hockey games are only once every three days.

202
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:38,496
Rym: So now I can just go to Google pick the hockey game I wanted to watch and watch it.

203
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:38,838
Scott: Yes.

204
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:40,183
Scott: This is I don't do work at work.

205
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:43,738
Scott: whenever there's a new Rangers game I'll just watch yesterday's hockey game.

206
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:44,340
Scott: Why not?

207
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:45,144
Scott: It's free.

208
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:49,090
Scott: This is awesome And I think what they have to do now, this is the great.

209
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:56,210
Scott: This is a huge step for the NHL because now it's not popular but all internet people might get into it.

210
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:58,018
Scott: Yeah, watch these videos for free.

211
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,310
Scott: What they've got to do is they got to take it to the next level.

212
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,250
Scott: They have to really not let up and keep pushing.

213
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:08,325
Scott: You know the fact that this webpage exists and that you can watch this stuff for free.

214
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:09,850
Scott: to get people to watch it.

215
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:11,216
Scott: Here's what I would do if I were them.

216
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:11,939
Scott: Watch hockey for free.

217
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:12,682
Scott: Go go go.

218
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:17,520
Rym: I would one make forever Hockey games more than I'd say, I don't know.

219
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,830
Rym: 24 hours 48 hours older hockey games.

220
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:20,693
Scott: Oh, you could.

221
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:22,782
Scott: there's older hockey games on here newer games.

222
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:24,589
Rym: No, no, no, I'm saying what I would do.

223
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:30,090
Rym: I'd make all the non live hockey free to watch and it'd be awesome.

224
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:34,830
Rym: I'd have a service where you could pay to see the games live.

225
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,738
Scott: I would pay five bucks a year.

226
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:38,727
Rym: Like you just pay, no you just pay per, I'd even make it.

227
00:13:38,747 --> 00:13:42,002
Rym: you just pay per game Or get a lifetime thing or yearly thing, whatever.

228
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:43,630
Rym: The numbers don't matter.

229
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:48,546
Rym: The point is you always make the old ones free because those are nothing but promotion.

230
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:54,510
Rym: People who actually get into hockey Will probably want to see the games live and they'd probably willing to pay a small amount.

231
00:13:55,196 --> 00:13:58,655
Rym: Couple that with advertising Targeted at geeks and nerds.

232
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:05,086
Rym: because I got to say a lot of geeks and nerds are into hockey in Proportion to geeks and nerds who are into other sports.

233
00:14:05,368 --> 00:14:06,553
Scott: Yeah I don't know.

234
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:11,930
Scott: I think that if they if they try really hard because other sports are pretty much neglecting the internet.

235
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:16,070
Scott: You know, it's if you want to watch baseball in the internet, you got to pay a fuck ton of money.

236
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,672
Scott: It's not worthy.

237
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,241
Scott: football basically non-existent on the internet.

238
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:20,505
Scott: You can't watch football in the internet.

239
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:21,749
Rym: You can't watch head footballs.

240
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,357
Scott: Yeah, you know basketball not on the internet.

241
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:26,825
Scott: hockey now is all on the internet.

242
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:35,739
Scott: You can watch all the games After they're done being played on Google video for free legally, you know sponsored by you know They gotta add a fight video.

243
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:39,218
Scott: The thing is the NHL.

244
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:44,359
Scott: if they ever, you know say, you know promote their fighting That doesn't work because then they get this huge backlash.

245
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:50,490
Scott: You know what the backlash is only from non hockey I know but they just they can't do it even though they want to real bad.

246
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:56,950
Rym: Yeah, they could because then it creates the sort of you know All the people who complain about the fighting just make the people who are interested more interested.

247
00:14:57,312 --> 00:15:00,290
Scott: I know I know but that's how it goes.

248
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:03,510
Scott: Anyway, yeah, the NHL just keeps pushing it.

249
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,150
Scott: They can I think they definitely become popular again and awesome.

250
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:12,870
Scott: And even if they don't I can watch hockey now if I have bored and I got nothing to do hockey game.

251
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:15,898
Rym: So a while ago there was a study.

252
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,870
Rym: Well a poll that was going around and a lot of people were quoting it on the internet.

253
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:34,745
Rym: It's kind of an old poll and it's been done a few times and it basically said that 90% of Americans believe in God and a lot of people were trying to use this as Evidence in various arguments and debates all over the internet most notably on FARC.

254
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:36,770
Scott: So do we know how this poll worked or anything?

255
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,629
Rym: Oh, well The poll wasn't that good.

256
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:49,578
Rym: Recently a real Harris poll that went much more in depth came out and very similar if you don't know Harris is a really really Reliable and well done polling company.

257
00:15:49,598 --> 00:16:03,764
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, and there have been other studies and what they discovered is that actually 42% of Americans are not certain that there is a God they believe kind of but they will not commit to being absolutely Certain that there is a God.

258
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,607
Rym: Mm-hmm, which is significantly different than saying that 90% of Americans believe in God.

259
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:11,139
Rym: now I'm not really going anywhere this other than that.

260
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:13,290
Rym: There are a lot of interesting correlations.

261
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:16,633
Scott: Read the part that you know, I want you to read All right.

262
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:22,528
Rym: One thing is that very many Jews or people who claim to be Jews do not actually believe in God.

263
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,137
Scott: Yep What was the percentage?

264
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:32,467
Rym: let's see only 76% of Protestants 64% of Catholics and 30% of Jews are certain that there is a God.

265
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:43,702
Scott: now I want to point out that Jewish culture, especially, you know, the United States mostly but Jewish Culture and the way Jewish people are mostly Jewish families Jewish mothers.

266
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,729
Scott: They really stress education a lot.

267
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:48,214
Scott: Well a lot funny.

268
00:16:48,234 --> 00:17:00,550
Rym: you mentioned that because apparently there is a direct and clear negative correlation between level of education And belief in God and that is why a lot of Jews like I identify myself as Jewish.

269
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,140
Scott: Ish, I guess Jewish ish kinda.

270
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,390
Rym: did you call yourself an open-source juggle a while ago?

271
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,598
Scott: Yeah, you could call it.

272
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:11,400
Scott: whatever the hell you want The point is Jewish don't believe in God.

273
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,547
Scott: A lot of rabbis don't even believe in God.

274
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:14,310
Scott: It's kind of crazy.

275
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:17,290
Rym: Yeah, well, it's more of a culture that we get into that but that's not the point.

276
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,295
Scott: I want to know a lot about it.

277
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,983
Scott: You can read Douglas Rushkoff's book.

278
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:21,430
Scott: Nothing sacred anyway.

279
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,268
Rym: There's just a lot of interesting things.

280
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:28,079
Rym: Women are slightly more likely than men to believe in God.

281
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,890
Rym: blacks are super more likely than whites to believe in God.

282
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:34,509
Rym: So are Hispanics but not as much as blacks.

283
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,750
Rym: Republicans are more likely to believe in God than Democrats.

284
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:50,510
Rym: The education thing and then they ask a whole bunch of other interesting questions Like do you believe that all religious people worship the same God or does God actually control events on earth and all sorts of things?

285
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:56,886
Rym: Now here's an interesting only 29% of people believe that God has an effect on the earth only 29%.

286
00:17:56,886 --> 00:17:57,246
Scott: you say yeah.

287
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:00,706
Scott: well to the see the thing is.

288
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:07,590
Scott: Gotta ask people if they allow their belief or disbelief in God to affect their decisions.

289
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,301
Rym: See a question like that's not good for a poll.

290
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,490
Rym: Yeah internal subjective question.

291
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,707
Rym: They're asking very direct questions like is God male or female?

292
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:19,303
Scott: What do people say to that?

293
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:21,416
Rym: well 36 percent.

294
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:23,626
Scott: there was a big controversy actually because I went to this.

295
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:24,670
Scott: it's 50/50.

296
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,929
Rym: It's 50/50 between God is male and God is neither male nor female.

297
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:33,090
Rym: Ten percent say God is both and one percent say God is a woman.

298
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,549
Scott: Only one percent say God's a woman.

299
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:41,674
Rym: Well, remember most people in this country if they have a religion have a monotheistic Religion.

300
00:18:41,975 --> 00:18:44,330
Rym: that is probably not believing in some sort of earth spirit.

301
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:49,678
Rym: Yeah, except for you know Wiccans and all then but They weren't heavily represented.

302
00:18:49,718 --> 00:18:52,630
Rym: or if they were they didn't say that God was female.

303
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:56,677
Scott: Yeah, see one of the key tenants of Judaism is iconoclasm.

304
00:18:56,697 --> 00:19:00,194
Scott: You're not supposed to like, you know Iconify anything.

305
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:08,331
Scott: Yeah, so there was one temple I went to once where they said this They said this song or whatever you want to call it and in the song It's.

306
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:16,530
Scott: there are some words that were like, you know, God is black hair and he's a man, you know It was like one sentence and it was a big controversy.

307
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,257
Scott: So, okay, it just reminded me of that.

308
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:25,270
Scott: well the only other talking about Jewish the only other interesting thing you're talking about Jewishness.

309
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,001
Rym: I was going on a different tack and well Jewishness.

310
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:28,563
Scott: I'm Jewish.

311
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,587
Scott: That's all I could talk about.

312
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:31,354
Scott: Okay Not really.

313
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:37,857
Rym: the the interesting thing they talk about at the end is they're trying to figure out whether or not belief in God is actually declining or not.

314
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:47,210
Rym: and the reason it's a difficult question to answer is Because in the past a lot of these polls were conducted over the phone and now many polls like this are conducted over the internet.

315
00:19:47,914 --> 00:19:59,970
Rym: and it turns out that a lot of studies have shown that when given a poll that is by mail or over the internet people are much more likely to tell the truth when they are asked about Something that may be socially undesirable.

316
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:11,990
Rym: So if you call someone and ask them if they believe in God Even if they don't they're much more likely to say yes because they're afraid of stigma from saying no Because they're talking to an actual person.

317
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:16,970
Rym: But if they're responding to a machine they're much more likely to tell the truth about their actual beliefs.

318
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:31,610
Scott: But isn't there also a problem of when you're calling people on the phone You're only polling the subset of people who have home phones Which is not us and when you're doing the internet you're doing the subset of people who have internet connections and take polls on the internet.

319
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:39,980
Rym: Well the way us the way Harris does it they have a very strict methodology that basically Comes up with very statistically significant results.

320
00:20:40,482 --> 00:20:42,269
Scott: Yeah, I know that but I'm just pointing that out.

321
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:52,129
Rym: Oh, yeah Telephone polls are largely becoming irrelevant because the only people who have telephones and are willing to do polls Tend to be busybodies.

322
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:56,688
Scott: Yeah Busybodies do they believe in God?

323
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,588
Rym: Things of the day.

324
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:08,604
Rym: I've got a very relevant thing of the day My thing.

325
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,408
Scott: it is not relevant.

326
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:11,297
Scott: So I'll go first, but mine's very relevant.

327
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:11,840
Rym: I want to do it.

328
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,603
Scott: That's why you do it.

329
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:12,925
Scott: second.

330
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,934
Rym: No, cuz it's not actually relevant.

331
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:16,180
Rym: You know, what my thing of the day is.

332
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:17,529
Rym: That's why there's a joke.

333
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:18,879
Scott: Okay, we'll go for it.

334
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:28,439
Rym: Then someone just put up this video of a banana spider who has found a grub in his in his web And he goes over and he eats it and I just thought it was really cool.

335
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:29,544
Scott: Yeah, I was.

336
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:33,460
Scott: I was watching the video and I saw the grub in the web and I was like, where is the spider?

337
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,703
Scott: Where is the spider?

338
00:21:34,724 --> 00:21:37,556
Scott: and then the spider comes and it's like aha.

339
00:21:37,617 --> 00:21:41,540
Rym: There is the spider There is the spider there's the spider.

340
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,630
Scott: Alright, alright, is that it?

341
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:44,413
Rym: That's it.

342
00:21:44,473 --> 00:21:45,217
Rym: Just watch this video.

343
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:45,759
Rym: It's kind of cool.

344
00:21:46,424 --> 00:21:48,760
Scott: Okay, I guess you're not getting enough Discovery Channel.

345
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:53,019
Rym: You can watch rooms if you want to watch a really big spider eat a really little yellow grub.

346
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:03,160
Scott: So my Google video is titled almost terrible workday and in the video They say like this guy's the luckiest store clerk ever.

347
00:22:03,562 --> 00:22:05,594
Scott: I don't think he's a lucky store clerk because he was lucky.

348
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:08,388
Rym: this wouldn't happen to him Because that was an awesome story.

349
00:22:08,408 --> 00:22:10,800
Scott: if it is an awesome story, but you're not the luckiest.

350
00:22:11,181 --> 00:22:25,078
Rym: no, the luckiest would be if right after it happened a lottery ticket fell out of it and landed in his pocket and then I don't know Jesus and Moses and yeah Hanukkah, Harry came down and gave him a present the Jewish today.

351
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:25,800
Scott: No more Jew talk.

352
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:27,189
Rym: You're the one who started it.

353
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,417
Scott: I know I'm gonna stop it, too.

354
00:22:29,302 --> 00:22:32,879
Rym: I'll start saying random Yiddish words if you don't say you're watching this video.

355
00:22:33,522 --> 00:22:35,348
Scott: It's very obviously a music store.

356
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:50,605
Scott: you can see some amps going you could see a keyboard and there's a rack of sheet music And on the right side there's a guy sitting behind the counter and he's I think he's browsing the web on that computer there You know, he's doing something.

357
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,354
Scott: So you're watching and the guy's sitting there.

358
00:22:53,394 --> 00:22:53,996
Scott: He's typing.

359
00:22:54,236 --> 00:23:04,640
Scott: He's doing something All of a sudden like out of nowhere Frickin, you know, he picks his head up because he hears a noise and he looks to the back of the store.

360
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:08,827
Scott: But you think oh he's looking to the back of the store because there's a guy in the back of the store He's looking at.

361
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:15,527
Scott: then I don't know if a car hits the store or maybe just the wall Collapses for no reason or they.

362
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:21,357
Scott: maybe they hung too much shit on the wall, but the wall behind him just Smashes right in on him.

363
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:24,129
Scott: And I think he was the reason.

364
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:26,619
Scott: they say he's real lucky is it totally misses him.

365
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:31,960
Rym: Yeah, the whole area is completely crushed except for this tiny area right around where he's sitting.

366
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:33,804
Scott: Yeah basically it's like a man.

367
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:40,850
Scott: the guys like those looney tunes are like there's a hole in the wall and the wall falls down and Bugs Bunny ends up standing where the hole was.

368
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:41,694
Rym: after it happens.

369
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:42,999
Scott: The guy's just like what the fuck.

370
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:50,799
Scott: He freaks out and he gets up and he starts running around doing whatever You know that you would do if the entire wall of your store fell in on you.

371
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:55,213
Scott: But yeah the one spot sitting at the desk is where he didn't get hurt.

372
00:23:55,514 --> 00:24:02,159
Scott: if he was like not browsing the web He would have been totally crushed by the wall Probably had to go to the hospital with some serious injuries.

373
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:06,620
Rym: Alright, so we were inspired to do today's show.

374
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:25,231
Rym: well tonight's show mostly due to the fact that back in the day a lot of newspapers and a lot of publications would around election times Come straight out and not only have opinions that were actually the opinion of the newspaper But they would officially endorse candidates in elections.

375
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:34,340
Scott: Yeah nowadays all the newspapers and TV stations They say the opinions Dated here are solely those of the people on the show and are not the opinion of the network at all.

376
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:39,920
Rym: I like the idea of a newspaper saying you know what we're back in so-and-so because blah and you can suck it.

377
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,826
Rym: This is our opinion.

378
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,879
Rym: If you don't like it, well suck it.

379
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:44,989
Scott: Yeah, nowadays you get newspapers.

380
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:50,530
Scott: the editor-in-chief will write an article saying, you know This guy is great and some other people write op-eds about.

381
00:24:50,590 --> 00:25:09,353
Scott: so-and-so is great and someone will write a letter to the editor saying So-and-so is great But it's only in this op-ed section and the rest of the newspaper while it might obviously be slanted you know, I mean everyone knows the New York Post is totally right-wing and everyone knows the New York Times is slightly left-wing if not a lot more than that.

382
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:18,639
Scott: and everyone knows that those newspapers with just the Red-ink and the black ink totally socialist the socialist worker the communist worker the yeah I know at least know what it is.

383
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,937
Scott: at least those newspapers had the balls to say they're socialist.

384
00:25:22,138 --> 00:25:28,003
Rym: the Piece of paper with a bunch of red ink that some hippie guy with dreadlocks tries to show newspaper.

385
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:31,494
Scott: that's in New York the epoch whatever the one for the.

386
00:25:32,116 --> 00:25:38,560
Rym: I just remember the one day at RIT Where I was walking to class and I was dressed up real nice because I was doing something that day.

387
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:46,988
Rym: And one of these hippies with the socialist club on campus, which was probably the smallest status club on the campus Even though it's pretty vocal.

388
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,460
Rym: Yeah, they were real loud, but there weren't many of them.

389
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:49,740
Scott: Nope

390
00:25:50,222 --> 00:26:03,032
Rym: and he's in the middle of the quarter mile yelling and screaming and handing out the socialist worker and he's like The war in Iraq blah blah blah because this is before the war in Iraq happened, you know back before everything went to shit and I was against the war.

391
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:04,398
Rym: I was against the war from the start.

392
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:14,133
Rym: but When this guy comes up to me and he's like the wars about oil blah blah blah blah blah I was just like I'm for the war.

393
00:26:14,153 --> 00:26:20,934
Rym: He's like what blah blah I'm like cuz it'll probably make oil prices go down and the guy just exploded.

394
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:30,640
Rym: and then he every point he made I just made the stupidest Simplest counterpoint I could even when it was something I totally disagreed with and he couldn't deal with it.

395
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,614
Rym: He's just yelling and yelling and yelling and yelling and getting red at the face.

396
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:34,820
Rym: I just laughed and walked away.

397
00:26:35,843 --> 00:26:36,866
Rym: It was the best thing ever.

398
00:26:36,966 --> 00:26:40,899
Scott: I would have been like, you know, I'm for the war just because I'm against you.

399
00:26:41,303 --> 00:26:46,418
Scott: No, I was against the war But because you're also against the war and I really don't want to end up a dirty hippie like you.

400
00:26:47,282 --> 00:26:51,220
Rym: At one point I was like my dad works in the arms industry.

401
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,068
Rym: I'm gonna get a lot of money if this war happens.

402
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:54,053
Scott: Oh, that's great.

403
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:55,580
Rym: This our war is paying for my college.

404
00:26:56,902 --> 00:26:57,239
Scott: awesome.

405
00:26:58,464 --> 00:26:59,599
Rym: He was so mad.

406
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:09,866
Rym: It was great every day and a couple times I'd see him on campus and he'd see me and he'd narrow his eyes and that Newman here remembered you Like how to stand out?

407
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:11,491
Scott: Yeah a little bit a little bit.

408
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:13,037
Scott: Yeah, those guys are fun though.

409
00:27:13,538 --> 00:27:22,760
Rym: Yeah, so Inspired by that GeekNights is going to officially endorse some candidates However, not many because we don't like most of the people running in the United States elections.

410
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:25,109
Scott: No, no, and we're only pretty much the elections.

411
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:27,599
Scott: this what's a week from its next Tuesday.

412
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:37,391
Scott: Yeah It it's only New York State people we have to vote for and you know our local representatives and we have I think one Person in the Federal House of Representatives to vote for.

413
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:39,700
Rym: and now to to all of our non US listeners.

414
00:27:39,861 --> 00:27:43,280
Rym: I promise we'll keep this interesting and not go into boring detail.

415
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,868
Scott: Yeah I mean even people in the US.

416
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:50,811
Scott: if you don't live in New York and don't have the same candidates as we do It's not gonna be interesting to you at all.

417
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:51,274
Scott: What do you care?

418
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,120
Scott: who our governor is?

419
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,349
Scott: They have they're not governing you.

420
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,529
Scott: if you're living, California You have the govern ater.

421
00:27:56,589 --> 00:28:02,480
Scott: whatever I like the govern ater he's alright But I'm you know, it's not as bad as some people make him out to be at least no, not at all.

422
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,393
Rym: I'm a supporter of the govern ater because he while I do disagree with him on points.

423
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:17,586
Rym: He is very much a Republican like the old Newt Gingrich days which while not great or a lot better than the current Republican day I don't know enough about him to say anymore.

424
00:28:18,027 --> 00:28:23,353
Scott: But yeah, anyway, alright, so we're gonna talk about New York candidates But we're still gonna try to make it entertaining.

425
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:25,666
Rym: Yeah real quick Let's just get the names out of people.

426
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:28,820
Rym: We officially want to endorse as I guess journalists.

427
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,365
Rym: Alright, you know what?

428
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,291
Rym: I'll start cuz I got the easiest one.

429
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,635
Rym: This is probably the only candidate.

430
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:35,678
Rym: I'm actually behind.

431
00:28:35,698 --> 00:28:42,980
Rym: Mm-hmm Elliot Spitzer and David Paterson are running for office governor and lieutenant governor.

432
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,590
Rym: Respectively and not only am I endorsing them but they are running.

433
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:49,860
Rym: they have been nominated by more than one party.

434
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:57,420
Rym: They're running as Democrats, but they're also running as the Independence Party Which is a party that I am pretty much.

435
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:58,102
Rym: It's the.

436
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:03,907
Rym: it's the political party in America founded by a guy who gave a lot of money to RIT Among other things.

437
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:05,375
Scott: I guess he got his money's worth.

438
00:29:05,415 --> 00:29:14,688
Rym: he convinced us the party is the closest thing to my beliefs as to how government should be run if Any party in the United States far and away?

439
00:29:14,748 --> 00:29:22,673
Rym: I mean, I'm very Libertarian party not at all because they do not agree.

440
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:29,764
Rym: I do not agree with them on many points Many points and I get this party is the closest thing to what I believe politically of anything.

441
00:29:29,804 --> 00:29:32,533
Rym: not to say that I agree with them a hundred percent because I certainly don't.

442
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:39,071
Rym: but that's the closest thing and Because Elliot Spitzer and David Patterson are running in America.

443
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:43,345
Rym: You can be nominated by as many parties as Parties will not like.

444
00:29:43,386 --> 00:29:46,280
Scott: let's say me and Rym started the GeekNights' political party, right?

445
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:52,140
Scott: Since we were a really small political party, we might not have a person in every disc.

446
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,428
Scott: Let's say we're only in New York political party, right?

447
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:57,980
Scott: New York has I don't know how many districts a whole lot of districts of voting.

448
00:29:58,525 --> 00:30:03,820
Scott: let's say we don't have a Candidate for every single district of New York.

449
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:12,553
Scott: well in those districts, you know, we can either have a blank spot on the ballot or We can endorse say the Republican candidate.

450
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:20,680
Scott: then people have a choice They can vote for the candidate on the Republican line or they can vote for the candidate on the GeekNights' party line.

451
00:30:20,745 --> 00:30:22,969
Rym: Yeah Now the benefit of this is in America.

452
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:29,499
Rym: if you get a certain percentage of the vote Then you are eligible for money from the government in the next set of elections.

453
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:34,420
Rym: Yeah, so let's say also basically get recognized as a real political party.

454
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:40,420
Scott: Yeah, so let's say Joe Blow is running for governor and we don't have a candidate for governor in our shitty little party.

455
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:51,920
Scott: So we endorse Joe Blow and Joe Blow wins because enough people vote for him But 25% of the people who voted for Joe Blow voted for him as a GeekNights' party member and not as a Republican.

456
00:30:52,303 --> 00:30:53,271
Scott: We get mad moneys.

457
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:54,420
Scott: Yo, it's awesome.

458
00:30:54,922 --> 00:31:00,140
Rym: Yeah, so Elliot Spitzer and David Patterson are running on the Democratic Party and the Independence Party.

459
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:04,878
Rym: So I officially endorse voting for these two men on the Independence Party.

460
00:31:04,918 --> 00:31:08,552
Rym: line State is column C on the ballot.

461
00:31:08,572 --> 00:31:10,600
Scott: I just want to talk about Elliot Spitzer for like a minute.

462
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,280
Scott: All right Is that basically Elliot Spitzer was until recent?

463
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:21,220
Scott: Well, he still is the Attorney General of New York State and as Attorney General he has done many things that are awesome.

464
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:27,640
Scott: He basically goes after all the people I think are assholes and tries to sue them as the state.

465
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:30,113
Scott: He sued a bunch of evil insurance guys.

466
00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:31,380
Scott: He sued spammers.

467
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:38,444
Scott: He sued spyware guys all sorts of awesomeness and it you know, that's how I found out about him and he's way cool for it.

468
00:31:39,007 --> 00:31:42,379
Scott: and I look at what he stands for and most of it's awesome.

469
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:47,820
Scott: and You know a lot of people say, uh, he's just doing that kind of stuff to get people to like him.

470
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:53,363
Rym: You know what if someone does good things because they want to be liked and then they keep doing good things because they keep wanting To be liked.

471
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:57,060
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm saying is it doesn't matter his intent.

472
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:00,700
Scott: He's doing what I want and he's probably going to continue to do what I want.

473
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:04,338
Scott: I don't care if his intent is because the result will be pleasing to me.

474
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:10,739
Scott: and The only thing I disagree with Elliot Spitzer on is he is anti, you know, violent video game.

475
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:22,495
Scott: and While I don't want to vote for someone who's anti violent video game I think it'll be enough to just write him a letter because I if I agree with him on almost everything else I can let one thing slide.

476
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:25,633
Scott: Yeah This will be banned.

477
00:32:25,915 --> 00:32:26,720
Rym: that's not gonna happen.

478
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,479
Scott: It's not like the other if the other candidate isn't exactly pro violent video game.

479
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:34,600
Rym: So we really need a pro violent video game candidate.

480
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:37,404
Scott: Yeah, dude The candidate goes up and he's like.

481
00:32:37,504 --> 00:32:43,700
Scott: I think video games need to be gorier and bloodier with more sex and more guts.

482
00:32:44,342 --> 00:32:47,896
Scott: This I got the name of the party already the not enough Gibbs.

483
00:32:48,238 --> 00:32:50,989
Scott: Yeah Oh, I gotta say this right now.

484
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:53,100
Scott: I'm looking at the list of parties in New York State.

485
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:54,810
Rym: Now what I just wanted.

486
00:32:55,112 --> 00:33:04,143
Rym: I'll I know what Scott's gonna say But I want to jump in real quick and point out that in America the name of your political party usually has Absolutely.

487
00:33:04,304 --> 00:33:06,672
Rym: Fuck all to do with what your party stands for.

488
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,558
Scott: for example, the Constitution Party.

489
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:09,782
Rym: Oh God Don't God.

490
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:13,292
Scott: the Constitution Party has nothing to do with the Constitution.

491
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:18,268
Rym: the Constitution Party wants quote To their conservative blah blah blah.

492
00:33:18,489 --> 00:33:22,060
Rym: They want to bring the quote biblical foundations of American jurisprudence.

493
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:27,157
Scott: Yeah, they should be the Bible Party, but no they are the Constitution Party.

494
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:28,979
Scott: why they call themselves that I don't know.

495
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:38,229
Scott: But anyway You know looking at the list of New York State parties this Republican Democratic Independence working families working families make sense.

496
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:42,120
Scott: libertarian green socialist workers socialist equality.

497
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:43,745
Scott: alright, alright, alright.

498
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:46,936
Scott: hit this one party that catches my eye.

499
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:54,787
Scott: and The abbreviation for the party is our th And it says here on the right side.

500
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:56,051
Scott: What does our th stand for?

501
00:33:56,111 --> 00:33:58,520
Scott: it stands for rent is too high.

502
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:06,160
Scott: Ha if you think rent is too high you can vote for Jimmy McMillan for a New York State governor.

503
00:34:06,582 --> 00:34:10,196
Scott: I don't think he's gonna win because you know what my rent isn't too high.

504
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:12,464
Rym: Maybe I'll vote for him Maybe I don't know.

505
00:34:12,524 --> 00:34:14,290
Scott: No, I think that spitzer is better.

506
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:22,739
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I would love to have lower rent But I'm not gonna vote for a guy whose only political stance is rent is too high.

507
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:30,280
Rym: Now the sad truth is I hate to say it but there's other than maybe kinky Friedman in Texas just because he's hilarious.

508
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:35,027
Rym: There's no one I support Anywhere, there's no one else I could endorse.

509
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:38,000
Rym: I could anti endorse a bunch of people but that list is long.

510
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:45,559
Scott: Yeah, there's only one person I want to specifically anti endorse and this is our person who is the representative of.

511
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:52,757
Scott: you Know us in New York where we live in New York State in the federal House of Representatives and that is Sue Kelly.

512
00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:05,986
Scott: I looked back in the day when I moved to Beacon at you know, the voting record of all my congress people and senators and Sue Kelly everything she voted on like Every single thing.

513
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:10,580
Scott: I went looking at all the bills in the House of Representatives at the federal government in the United States.

514
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:16,387
Scott: She voted the opposite of what I would have voted on every single bill Every single one.

515
00:35:16,488 --> 00:35:18,739
Scott: I would look at it and I would say yes, Sue Kelly voted.

516
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:20,889
Scott: No No, Sue Kelly voted.

517
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:22,499
Scott: Yes, every last one.

518
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:27,980
Scott: Now the Independence Party is supporting her and so is the Conservative Party in the Republican Party.

519
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:32,820
Scott: But god damn there's no way I'm voting for someone who votes the opposite of the way I do.

520
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,180
Scott: Yeah, the Democrat running is John Hall and I'll probably end up voting for him because he's the only other choice.

521
00:35:39,903 --> 00:35:47,760
Scott: but even if I disagree with him on a lot of things which I'm sure I do I Know that he'll vote differently from the Republican Sue Kelly.

522
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:50,089
Scott: Well, I mean even he votes differently.

523
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:53,160
Scott: just once I'll agree with him more than I agree with Sue Kelly.

524
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:58,469
Rym: I spoke with John Hall very briefly a while ago really as he was around and I ran.

525
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:13,080
Rym: actually I Ran into a whole bunch of candidates over the past month just around New York City and in various places doing things Mm-hmm, and I ran into John Hall up here when he was doing something one day and he seems like an unassuming guy.

526
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:24,149
Rym: Yeah, he's one of his platform seems to be I was something to the effect of make the Bush administration accountable for what it's done, which is Definitely vague and not actually going to happen.

527
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:27,420
Rym: But yeah, this is definitely a lesser of two evils situation.

528
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:29,600
Scott: Yeah, I don't know about John Hall.

529
00:36:32,062 --> 00:36:32,845
Scott: Slowly on her vote.

530
00:36:32,865 --> 00:36:39,411
Rym: John Hall votes for one thing Differently from the way Sue Kelly would if I consider it a victory.

531
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:43,526
Scott: That's what I'm saying is is suke, you know, he Every single thing?

532
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:44,209
Scott: she voted the way.

533
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,838
Scott: I disagree with every last one.

534
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:52,079
Rym: So for all of you foreign listeners American elections are really kind of silly.

535
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:56,882
Rym: Yeah, we don't have but we don't have or anything good We don't have.

536
00:36:56,922 --> 00:36:57,606
Rym: it's just a winner.

537
00:36:57,626 --> 00:37:06,891
Scott: take the big elections aren't so silly because they get a lot of attention But everything that's not big in the public eye The big elections is all really silly and kind of fun.

538
00:37:06,911 --> 00:37:09,160
Scott: and that's where the democratic process actually works.

539
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:10,706
Rym: Yeah, except that no one votes.

540
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:14,460
Scott: I know if more people voted it would work but but no cuz no one cares.

541
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:16,930
Scott: Oh, there's 29 districts in New York.

542
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:17,673
Scott: That's interesting.

543
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:19,380
Rym: That is interesting.

544
00:37:21,026 --> 00:37:28,733
Rym: Yeah, I mean in general we could talk a bit about our actual political leanings I guess or we could just go to bed and start fresh next week.

545
00:37:28,753 --> 00:37:30,699
Rym: cuz once again, we got a crazy weekend coming up.

546
00:37:31,061 --> 00:37:36,686
Scott: Yeah, I don't know who I'm gonna vote for for our senator though You know what I had to say it.

547
00:37:36,766 --> 00:37:51,420
Rym: but I'm pretty much not going to vote at all on Many of the positions that I can vote on because I simply don't agree with any of the candidates or can't find enough actual Information about him or I really don't care because none of them stand for me at all.

548
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,866
Rym: So it doesn't matter which one gets elected.

549
00:37:52,906 --> 00:37:54,432
Rym: I'm not gonna endorse one with a vote.

550
00:37:54,613 --> 00:37:56,380
Rym: Yeah, I'm not going to lend legitimacy.

551
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:59,515
Scott: I think there's like three positions where I'm just not gonna vote.

552
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:00,500
Rym: cuz here's the cool thing.

553
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:17,440
Rym: One of the things that a lot of members of the Independence Party are really pushing is that they want there to be very literally a none-of-the-above option where if you go and vote you can say I Do not want any of these people and if that wins then you have to do something to the election

554
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:21,536
Scott: But you to make a new election where none of the existing candidates can run again.

555
00:38:21,837 --> 00:38:22,580
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

556
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,486
Scott: That would be the way.

557
00:38:23,506 --> 00:38:25,520
Rym: I mean you'd have to think out all the details of that.

558
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:33,708
Rym: But in general a lot of people say, you know You should vote no matter what but I say if you really don't agree with any of the candidates Don't vote for the lesser of two evils.

559
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:36,800
Rym: Just don't vote because not voting does say something.

560
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:47,140
Rym: It says you either don't care or aren't represented and the less people vote the less Legitimacy there is around the voting process which might force some people to take action.

561
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:56,214
Scott: Yes That's what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in and the people I want I'm gonna vote for and when there's no one To choose from I just won't vote in that column for any of those people.

562
00:38:56,636 --> 00:39:00,756
Scott: and then you know They'll see that though They'll freakin see that.

563
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:11,698
Scott: you know there was someone who went in and specifically voted for X Y & Z but didn't vote for any of the people for the position of Comptroller because they all suck unless we use d-bold machines.

564
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,839
Scott: Oh Pund yeah.

565
00:39:14,582 --> 00:39:22,166
Scott: The other thing is that in the United States when you go into vote at the top of the voting machine on the ballot There are questions you can vote for.

566
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:26,500
Rym: well referendum reference got a little while ago was like we should talk about the questions.

567
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,592
Rym: I was like what the fuck are you talking about?

568
00:39:28,612 --> 00:39:30,040
Scott: They phrase them as questions.

569
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:34,595
Scott: It's like, you know, do you want you know this to go into effect?

570
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:36,200
Scott: or do you think that you know?

571
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,950
Scott: This is right.

572
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:37,458
Scott: Yes or no?

573
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,664
Scott: And they're all yes or no.

574
00:39:38,824 --> 00:39:42,075
Rym: the problem it varies state by state and city by city.

575
00:39:42,095 --> 00:39:44,952
Rym: how these things work is in a lot Of places referendums are non-binding.

576
00:39:44,972 --> 00:39:45,979
Rym: They're basically just a poll.

577
00:39:46,502 --> 00:40:03,634
Scott: Yeah, but I always even if there's no one on the ballot I want to vote for I will go always go in and answer the questions Because you know if you get there's a little piece of paper you can pick up that gives you the full details of what you're Exactly doing with the questions and I will always have an opinion yes or no.

578
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:07,583
Scott: and that's where I can vote directly representing myself without Between.

579
00:40:07,703 --> 00:40:13,540
Rym: I'm generally in more in favor of a more representative government and I generally dislike the idea of referendum.

580
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,316
Rym: Don't move to Oregon except on issue.

581
00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:22,300
Rym: I know about Oregon Yeah, except on issues where it really matters or it really should be that way which aren't many.

582
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:32,213
Rym: I mean I'm of the mind that people should work with their state legislature for local issues or their local government and Vote and however in that and the local government represents them.

583
00:40:32,957 --> 00:40:38,453
Rym: They elect Representatives to the United States federal House of Representatives, which represent them.

584
00:40:38,614 --> 00:40:50,339
Rym: the people to the federal government the House of Representatives The door the state legislature or someone should then choose a senator though It could be okay if states have people choose them like they do now.

585
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:55,740
Rym: But the senators should be the representatives of the state to the federal government.

586
00:40:56,102 --> 00:40:58,920
Rym: The senator should not be accountable to the people of the state.

587
00:40:59,221 --> 00:41:01,711
Rym: They should be accountable to the state legislature like they used to be.

588
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,880
Scott: Yeah, it is a little bit that way.

589
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,900
Scott: I mean if you send a letter to your senator, you're almost always gonna get some crap form letter back.

590
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,228
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is you send a letter to your representative.

591
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,272
Scott: It's a good chance.

592
00:41:12,413 --> 00:41:14,300
Scott: They'll actually reply to you kind of.

593
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,040
Rym: Well, the thing is senators are a little more high-profile.

594
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:20,319
Rym: So as a result, there's a slightly lower incumbency rate there.

595
00:41:20,721 --> 00:41:34,020
Rym: So as a result, you have a lot of senators who do things in their home states that don't need to be done Just to generate awareness to get votes when they should be working on actual real government business that doesn't involve their home state so much.

596
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:42,579
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I mean my view is actually a lot more complicated than that But I would need a whole show just to lay the basics of what I believe.

597
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:46,914
Scott: Anyway, that's who GeekNights is voting for if you live where we live.

598
00:41:47,095 --> 00:41:48,600
