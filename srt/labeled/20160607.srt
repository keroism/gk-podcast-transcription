00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,638
Rym: It's Tuesday June 7th 2016.

2
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:11,721
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:15,150
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight the grind.

4
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:18,988
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,488
Rym: And also if you are hearing now from us that PAX West badges went on sale.

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,370
Rym: They're already gone.

7
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:36,001
Scott: I mean the thing is I mean this obviously every time they go on sale you have the same discussion on Twitter that you have Every time they go on sale.

8
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:39,559
Rym: right yeah in fact I almost want a catalog.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,212
Rym: if the same people make the same arguments year after year I think they do.

10
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:48,528
Scott: it seems like they do anyway, but yeah just to to reiterate every you know what we say every year.

11
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:53,127
Scott: number one There's an article where they interviewed Robert coup and said everything that we always say.

12
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:53,890
Rym: I will link to it.

13
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:57,238
Rym: It's on geek wire because it's literally like Today.

14
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,617
Rym: everyone who tweeted at me It was like why don't they just X like?

15
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:05,519
Rym: there is literally an answer in this article where Robert coup is like listen We thought about that.

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,193
Rym: Here's why it doesn't work and People.

17
00:01:09,374 --> 00:01:12,030
Scott: the main thing I want to address though is that some people were?

18
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,080
Scott: Scoffing or laughing at me for saying that I would quit my job To get packs tickets and go to packs.

19
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:22,982
Scott: well if my job said sorry we're not giving you vacation time for packs or if I?

20
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:28,774
Scott: The packs tickets went on sale during a meeting and I walked out and then they got mad at me I just give him the finger.

21
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:32,086
Scott: It's like he was doubting me, but it's like no.

22
00:01:32,106 --> 00:01:33,070
Scott: There's what is the point?

23
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:34,897
Scott: I don't want to go to work.

24
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,969
Scott: the reason I go to work is so that I can do things like packs.

25
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,255
Scott: if you tell Me I can't go to packs.

26
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:41,004
Scott: There's no reason for me to be at work.

27
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:42,129
Scott: That's the reason I'm there.

28
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:46,823
Scott: So if you tell me I can't go I'm gonna quit the job first.

29
00:01:47,124 --> 00:01:55,349
Rym: now at the same time it is at least fair To as some of the criticism pointed out to at least acknowledge that that is the privilege of the fact that we're wealthy tech.

30
00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:03,386
Scott: guys If you can't go to packs period if you don't have this privilege packs is expensive Even if there are plenty of packs tickets and no one wanted them and you just get them.

31
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:06,456
Rym: so guys Here's the two tickets for four days.

32
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:10,368
Scott: for me right cost like three hundred dollars plus hotel nights.

33
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:15,443
Scott: for four days It's $200 a night for just a one bed hotel room plus get to Seattle.

34
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:15,684
Scott: right.

35
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:19,217
Scott: so this is already a multi-thousand dollar Endeavor just to go.

36
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:26,788
Scott: so if you can afford to go to packs in the first place Then you're already a very privileged individual, and that's not really.

37
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:27,150
Rym: in fact.

38
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:33,538
Rym: We talked about that at length because it's actually a kind of rough topic for people in the member that Why no one will game with you panel.

39
00:02:33,558 --> 00:02:34,623
Rym: and we talked a little bit about how.

40
00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:36,772
Rym: there's a lot of games like a lot high-end PC gaming.

41
00:02:37,414 --> 00:02:42,150
Rym: unless you've got enough money to buy some fucking like giant video card you can't even come to the table.

42
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:44,349
Rym: Yeah, like that's the reality of the world it sucks.

43
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:54,475
Rym: But at the same time if you really want to go to a packs and prime so hard to go to guys pecs out Like pecs out is so cheap So easy to get tickets to.

44
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:59,090
Rym: the only things that are missing from packs out that you get in Seattle are Seattle itself.

45
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:09,988
Rym: I really like Seattle like there's stuff to do there like sales a really good place with lots of food and The expo hall is kind of baby, but you know what the expo hall is the least interesting part of packs.

46
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:14,260
Rym: Yeah, and Everything else at Pac South is 100% as good as PAX Prime only yellow.

47
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:19,963
Rym: Yeah, like the tabletop is actually better than packs.

48
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:21,390
Rym: prime because you can actually get a seat.

49
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:26,434
Rym: It takes a couple days for the badges to sell out so you can just like no It did there did.

50
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:27,502
Scott: I don't think they sold out at all.

51
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:28,490
Scott: They but they're on sale now.

52
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,017
Rym: I think Friday and Saturday matters.

53
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:30,439
Rym: Let me see.

54
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:31,685
Scott: Let me see anything is sold out.

55
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:32,730
Scott: I think you just buy a ticket.

56
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:34,736
Rym: I'm gonna check right now cuz I had.

57
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:37,085
Rym: I've never bought a ticket to any packs.

58
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:38,209
Rym: at least that I needed to.

59
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,677
Rym: Yeah, you can totally just buy bad guys.

60
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:43,790
Scott: I won whenever the demand is way lower than the supply.

61
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:46,684
Rym: So guys Pac South 2017 go buy a badge now.

62
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:47,830
Rym: It's in the end of January.

63
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,432
Rym: It's a pack.

64
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:56,410
Scott: even if you live and say like Portland, Oregon, right where you'd slut me you could drive to Seattle Maybe and cheaply you're gonna have to pay to park your car and the hotel.

65
00:03:56,591 --> 00:04:01,030
Scott: It will literally be cheaper for you to go to Pac South might be more expensive to go to Pac South from Portland.

66
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:04,830
Rym: Cuz I tried to go to Portland after packs to lecture that other thing.

67
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,150
Scott: I tried to think of the place that was closest to Seattle, but you still needed a hotel.

68
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,169
Rym: But seriously, we live in New York City.

69
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:16,730
Rym: It is cheaper for us to go to Pac South in San Antonio fucking Texas than it is to go to Pac's East in Boston.

70
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:22,152
Rym: Yep, like they are very close to each other in terms of actual total cost Just go.

71
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:23,156
Rym: that is terrifying.

72
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:27,510
Scott: but Pac South is the seat especially all you people with the sour grapes about not getting tickets to prime.

73
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:28,593
Scott: Just go south.

74
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:30,098
Rym: No, no one got tickets to prime.

75
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:30,740
Rym: No one.

76
00:04:31,422 --> 00:04:33,810
Scott: Yeah, no one not all the thousands of people that are gonna be there.

77
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:35,262
Rym: No, cuz there's PAX West.

78
00:04:35,282 --> 00:04:36,089
Rym: there is no packs, bro.

79
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,930
Rym: But here's the other secret and I'm not gonna put this in the text even though it's common public knowledge.

80
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:47,179
Rym: I feel like all these reward people who pay attention a little bit.

81
00:04:47,540 --> 00:05:00,498
Rym: guys if you really really want to go to packs and For some reason like it literally is a many hundred dollar markup to buy a badge from the few scalpers who have them Buy a badge to PAX dev.

82
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:02,264
Rym: It's only 400 bucks.

83
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,979
Rym: And if you're a student at a university It's like 250 bucks.

84
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:19,650
Rym: And if you buy a badge to PAX dev you have the right to buy a four-day pass to PAX Prime Even if it's sold out right because they basically allocate a PAX Prime badge per PAX dev badge.

85
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,190
Scott: Of course, you need a legit reason to go to packs day.

86
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,276
Rym: Yeah, no wait, I mean you.

87
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:25,930
Rym: if you're a student if you have any interest in making games you can go.

88
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,998
Rym: I mean, I've gone to all but one of the packs devs.

89
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:29,343
Rym: They're really really fun.

90
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:36,489
Rym: Like I like going but the only danger of going to PAX dev is Seriously, like you can't fucking talk about it.

91
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:43,850
Rym: Because if you reveal the things that aren't pretty like allowed to be revealed from PAX dev because it's sort of a closed Dev is a secret place.

92
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:48,625
Scott: right if you go there if you reveal any information that you learn there to the public or the press

93
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:51,438
Rym: without permission from the people who Gave you the knowledge that

94
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:58,050
Scott: you're not supposed to you Run the risk of being banned from all packs is forever, which is like the worst thing in the universe.

95
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,370
Rym: I'd rather go to jail for a moderate to short amount of time then.

96
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:13,058
Rym: But otherwise like PAX dev is just like a really focused packs like imagine a packs That there's still people.

97
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:19,630
Scott: the problem with PAX dev though Is that even if you save money compared to the price of scalped prime badges?

98
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:28,390
Rym: You have to pay for those extra two hotel nights But if you're one of those people who lives kind of local then it's actually not that bad.

99
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,970
Scott: Oh, if you're if you're local that man, you should be going right?

100
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,456
Scott: I guess I take more days off of work but I mean I'm quitting my job to go to pack.

101
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:40,698
Rym: and well you might not want to go to dev like if you're really don't care about making games and Money is an issue really like.

102
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:47,690
Rym: don't go to PAX dev because if you don't have a student discount it is like 400 bucks Yeah, but but still that's way cheaper than like normal professional conference.

103
00:06:47,932 --> 00:06:50,246
Scott: All right, so packs badges one and sell yet again.

104
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:50,809
Scott: Let's move on.

105
00:06:50,910 --> 00:07:00,265
Rym: Yep, but it's interesting because literally this morning in a serendipitous moment There's an article an op-ed on the New York Times that I it opened.

106
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:06,628
Rym: I opened it by the Hamilton guy Yeah, and I opened it because I was thinking packs badges go on sale any day.

107
00:07:06,648 --> 00:07:08,710
Rym: as you saw on the forum I was trying to predict when they would go on sale.

108
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,512
Scott: Well, there's also.

109
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:17,190
Scott: a few days ago former Ticketmaster CEO also former executive at Twitter wrote a big article about the same topic.

110
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:19,301
Scott: Yeah in a different news outlet.

111
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:20,729
Rym: So there's two reasons I bring this up.

112
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:33,913
Rym: one It's called stop the bots from killing Broadway and basically take every complaint everyone has about the badges for packs and All the things that Mike and Jerry want to do with packs because they don't want to reward people who have more money as much As they can.

113
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:46,870
Rym: it's the exact same article just about Broadway and about Hamilton and It's sort of a reminder to all the kids who were super butter about Packs or Dragon Con or New York Comic Con or all these conventions where it's hard to get badges.

114
00:07:47,492 --> 00:07:50,101
Rym: Welcome to every other fandom on earth.

115
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,950
Scott: Well, I think there's a more underlying problem here.

116
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,097
Scott: Right that maybe may not be true.

117
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:58,570
Scott: I have no evidence to you know, it just seems like it may be true, right?

118
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,690
Scott: Yeah, and that we've arrived in a society.

119
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:10,490
Scott: We're going towards a situation where many many more things are Abundant and some things are infinitely abundant at least in the privileged United States society.

120
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:13,308
Rym: Yeah, like if I want to listen to a particular song.

121
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:16,662
Rym: Legality aside it's infinitely abundant.

122
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:18,110
Rym: I can just go download it, right?

123
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:29,350
Scott: so first of all, people are saving money not buying a bunch of CDs and stuff, right and People, you know, there's there's certain experiences that have become so common that they've lost worth, right?

124
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:37,379
Scott: So I think that people who are the kind of people who pay for experiences are over there, you know They're more there.

125
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:40,092
Scott: They're Overvaluing right.

126
00:08:40,113 --> 00:08:44,370
Scott: you're overvaluing something like a convention or a concert right or a sporting event.

127
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,193
Rym: You make a good point.

128
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:45,655
Rym: think about this.

129
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:52,104
Rym: if I spent say I used to spend a thousand dollars a year buying music CDs Cuz I'm really into music and then I just start pirating now.

130
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:58,312
Scott: I've got a thousand dollars a year Even if you know this a it might be that you have more money But it be.

131
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:00,941
Scott: it might be because of just the way people's lives are.

132
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:11,650
Scott: so internet that when there is a high-quality In-person thing that just the value of that in terms of what it gives you in your life seems like greater, right?

133
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,006
Scott: You're willing to pay more for something like that because you know, it's like yeah, right, you know.

134
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:26,466
Scott: people look at packs like the concerts are cool, you know are Better than they used to be or people want to go to them more than they used to just because of the way our culture Is now right, you know.

135
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:31,825
Scott: So because of that there's more demand for them than there was before.

136
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:35,296
Scott: people are more interested in Concerts now than they were then.

137
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:45,350
Rym: I think there's even another thing drawing demand or because we've been going to pack since 2008 And back then you could just buy a badge like way late in the game Like you could just show up at the door and buy a bag.

138
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:55,549
Rym: Yeah, we didn't go early enough like oh six oh seven because we couldn't yeah We couldn't afford to or or we weren't willing or able to make the sacrifices necessary to go.

139
00:09:56,253 --> 00:09:57,278
Rym: This is one of my few regrets.

140
00:09:57,358 --> 00:09:58,223
Scott: mistakes are made.

141
00:09:58,243 --> 00:09:59,348
Rym: I should have at least gone to o7.

142
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:01,867
Scott: I could have made it work could have gone to o7 for sure.

143
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,930
Scott: We probably could have even gone to o5 o6 if we really wanted.

144
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:09,870
Rym: You know what if we'd stopped going to like Otakon earlier, we definitely could have done the packs like earlier.

145
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:19,070
Rym: Yeah, but there's I think there might be another thing going on because Hyperion, you know positive this problem and a bunch of other books We've read over the years like culture books even positive problem.

146
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:27,770
Rym: Remember, there's one culture book where there's an event that happened a long time ago and the light from the explosions of that event Is about to hit this big orbital.

147
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:49,330
Rym: so there's gonna be a concert in at the orbital and sure you could do the VR and like see the concert and it'd be Totally fine like over the culture equivalent of the super space internet, but because it's only going to happen once ever People suddenly decided they put value on for real being there and there's only so much space like even the culture can't conquer basic physics.

148
00:10:50,052 --> 00:11:01,227
Rym: So this post-scarcity society redevelops currency just for this one concert mmm, and The internet, you know, like when we used to go to PAX is like even game.

149
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:07,102
Rym: like most gamers I talked to had never heard of PAX Even in like oh 809 even 2010 like PAX East.

150
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:12,090
Rym: a lot of people lived in Boston Didn't know PAX was there but were otherwise gamers.

151
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:18,890
Rym: I feel like the internet being more ubiquitous and like Generation Z or whatever like getting old enough to really use the internet like the younger kids.

152
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:20,598
Rym: They just know what's up.

153
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:26,383
Rym: Like they look online and they see Oh markiplier is a guy I'm a fan of and oh, he's at this thing packs and then they learn about packs.

154
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:31,768
Rym: So there's way more eyeballs independent of if the demand from any individual eyeball went up.

155
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:40,960
Rym: like think about all the people to this day who are anime fans who live in fucking Baltimore and Don't know that the best and biggest anime con except for anime.

156
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,892
Rym: Boston in terms of best in the country is basically like down the street From them.

157
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:48,532
Rym: It's in DC now will be Anyway, yep.

158
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:49,737
Rym: You got any news?

159
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:57,110
Scott: I do have a news about something we saw at PAX Which is radio ball in a deep and distant future.

160
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,184
Scott: Finally, this game is announced for being released on July 12th.

161
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:02,809

00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:05,120
Scott: I thought it was June 12th, which is this Sunday.

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,290
Scott: I got all excited, but no, it's a month from Sunday.

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,315
Scott: Yeah, July 12.

166
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:09,681

Scott: We're gonna come back and then on Tuesday It'll be on Steam for $9.99.

168
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:16,387
Scott: is gonna be the price to play video ball.

169
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:17,290
Scott: That is a great price.

170
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:20,905
Scott: I'm gonna be buying and playing that game on July 12th.

171
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:22,030
Scott: So look forward to it.

172
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,022
Rym: Scratch is so many inches that I've had for a long time.

173
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:26,930
Scott: because we should have a streaming video ball party.

174
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:27,715
Rym: We should work.

175
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,258
Rym: I mean you.

176
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:30,090
Rym: we just form a team and just try to compete.

177
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,908
Scott: We need a third person for our video ball team.

178
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:36,201
Rym: Let's get good and then we'll host tryouts for who can be our third.

179
00:12:36,262 --> 00:12:37,527
Scott: we or we can just play two people.

180
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:37,748
Scott: team.

181
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:39,960
Scott: that there's You know one on one two and two and three on three.

182
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,009
Scott: Yeah, I think we wanted three on three I feel like is the real mode.

183
00:12:44,512 --> 00:13:02,733
Rym: We did that Atari game design panel at a bunch of packs as in other places and we've been I've been really thinking a lot About these like simple like very direct competition ortho games like Atari style and I feel like that genre really needs a huge Renaissance for just starting to get like video ball is one of Many games

184
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:04,601
Scott: she knows even out yet.

185
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:06,328
Scott: I know dude release that.

186
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:10,890
Rym: yeah I mean, it's interesting how like I don't pay attention to certain games.

187
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:20,350
Rym: But so like there's these specific games shapes and beats and video ball that every packs I've seen the actual hella is coming out rare very very soon like oh man days away.

188
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:26,088
Scott: This is the cyberpunk anime bartender simulation visual novel type game.

189
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:32,937
Rym: Yep Oh my god, but these games I see him every year every packs and I walk by and I go up to these people and I'm Like dude, just give me the game.

190
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:33,922
Rym: I don't even care if it's done.

191
00:13:34,183 --> 00:13:35,450
Rym: Just I'll give you money.

192
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:37,344
Rym: How much money is do you want already pre-ordered?

193
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:49,645
Rym: Yeah the trouble is because my main news is that overwatch is also out and And So there is I think every single person I know except me is playing this game, right?

194
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:52,896
Scott: Holy shit every person I know every nerdy friend.

195
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:56,429
Scott: I have even like my sister is playing this game, right?

196
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:58,490
Scott: It's like every single person.

197
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:05,150
Scott: I didn't you know, I knew this was gonna be a big game when it was You know having boobs and Blizzard was making a tf2 type game.

198
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,672
Scott: I don't know.

199
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:09,570
Rym: a lot of people were confusing this and battle-born because they look very superficially.

200
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:14,166
Scott: Anyway, but like I knew the Blizzard is making a tf2 type game.

201
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:15,210
Scott: I knew it was coming out soon.

202
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,678
Scott: I actually got the the beta for like.

203
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:19,184
Scott: there's a beta weekend, which I got.

204
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:20,910
Scott: I download installed it and didn't play it.

205
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:26,470
Scott: And then like I knew it was gonna be a hit because it's a Blizzard game, you know.

206
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:31,527
Scott: But it is a like the biggest hit I've ever seen like so even when tf2 came out.

207
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:33,573
Scott: It wasn't like Everyone was.

208
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:38,409
Scott: this is literally I do not know any nerds who are not playing this.

209
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:45,508
Rym: So it's interesting because except me team fortress 2 was supposed to be the successor to.

210
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:54,839
Rym: you know I'm fortress the throne of team fortress team fortress classic weapons factory Mega TF like that kind of game real game.

211
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:01,438
Rym: team fortress 2 was supposed to be like the modern version of that and it was Except you go back and listen to our show about it.

212
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,882
Rym: It was kind of baby mode.

213
00:15:03,464 --> 00:15:07,335
Rym: It actually wasn't that fun Unless you like.

214
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,470
Rym: even if you got like if you got really good the game was just not fun anymore.

215
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,413
Scott: Yeah, they put way.

216
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:20,185
Scott: they put all the effort on the aesthetics and pretty much got the best aesthetics in a shooter ever But sacrificed the actual game and then they went down Hat Road.

217
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:24,046
Rym: and but it wasn't just Hat Road It was game affecting hats right before Hat Road.

218
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:24,610
Scott: It was bad.

219
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:34,810
Rym: but then once the Hat Road that was like the last nail in the coffin and I remember this rush where everyone got really into It partly because I'd been talking up this game for as long as it was possibly in development.

220
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:37,839
Rym: Remember that site TF to like Rym weights.

221
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,808
Rym: Yep, every event in history Rym weights.

222
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:41,370
Scott: Yeah.

223
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:48,300
Rym: So it finally came out and it just was deeply unsatisfying and had all these problems and within about a month I was just done with it.

224
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,550
Rym: Like I just didn't care anymore.

225
00:15:49,691 --> 00:15:52,630
Scott: It's an overwatch seems to be significantly more skill based.

226
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:58,570
Scott: So it doesn't seem like it's at the level of like actual super quake, but well, actually it's pretty close.

227
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,413
Rym: So here's my.

228
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,400
Scott: are you flying around like ridiculously?

229
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,062
Scott: Yes.

230
00:16:02,404 --> 00:16:04,170
Scott: Yeah, it was like quake one fast.

231
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:07,913
Rym: It's about as fast as quake two Really?

232
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,140
Scott: Yeah, how are all these people playing it?

233
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,083
Scott: Are they like just like?

234
00:16:11,123 --> 00:16:13,230
Rym: most people are fucking awful at it?

235
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,306
Scott: Are they just like dying instantly to people who are like going so fast.

236
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:16,970
Scott: They can't hit them?

237
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:27,390
Rym: the beauty is shot it by people and so many people are playing and It's six on six And the matchmaking is really good.

238
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,727
Scott: Blizzard is the only people have good matchmaking like.

239
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:33,350
Rym: I'm Legitimately impressed with the matchmaking and how close these games end up.

240
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,790
Scott: Yeah, Blizzard is the only company with decent matchmaking technology.

241
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,750
Rym: So all that together means that there is room for people like the skill level of people.

242
00:16:41,112 --> 00:16:41,555
Scott: Oh, you're never.

243
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,250
Scott: you're never in a match with any gods that are gonna crush you.

244
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,614
Rym: You might be in them occasionally But it's pretty rare.

245
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:56,470
Rym: and because it's not like the old days where a match was an hour long like this shit ends real quick If one team is just that much better and then they rematch you so you're not playing with them again.

246
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:02,230
Rym: So if I had to compare it to one of the games that it succeeded it is actually closest to weapons factory.

247
00:17:02,892 --> 00:17:04,660
Scott: It's like a million different things to do.

248
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,150
Scott: Yes, and you have to bind like a hundred keys on your keyboard.

249
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:10,161
Rym: So remember how Team Fortress 2 distilled that down to like.

250
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:12,630
Rym: every class has like a few weapons and a power.

251
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:14,730
Rym: Yeah, this one distilled it even further.

252
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:22,481
Rym: But unlike Team Fortress 2 where the powers are all kind of samey and bullshitty The powers here are way different like dune level different.

253
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:27,440
Scott: So in mega t so it's like a. it's like MOBA where you have your four Yep, so here's an example.

254
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:31,465
Rym: in old weapons factory Which was the height of that genre weapons factory?

255
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:31,827
Rym: for quick to?

256
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,230
Rym: Weapons factory quake 3 was slow and kind of crappy and like lot like people went back to quake 2.

257
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,371
Scott: What?

258
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,080
Scott: no the only weapons factory is the quake 2 one.

259
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,110
Scott: There's no there was no other weapons factory.

260
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,159
Rym: Well, there was a the the quick grappling hook.

261
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:53,370
Rym: the quake 3 weapons factory was made by the same people who made the fourth Supposed Indiana Jones movie and all those Terminator movies after the second one and I think they tried to make some matrix movies.

262
00:17:54,771 --> 00:18:02,080
Rym: It's really a shame that those guys all died anyway, so in weapons factory Here's some of the classes and then I'll compare them to overwatch classes.

263
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,063
Rym: There was the gunner.

264
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:05,230
Rym: the gunner was super slow.

265
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:07,478
Scott: Yeah, didn't you have like the crazy like minigun?

266
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,161
Rym: Yep.

267
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:09,526
Rym: Now the gunner was a woman like.

268
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,490
Rym: the models are all way different.

269
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,599
Rym: It was this big buff woman.

270
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:12,929
Rym: She had a chaingun.

271
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:14,896
Rym: Well, she had three chainguns.

272
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:19,030
Rym: cuz this game had you had like a different weapons factory right different ammo in each one.

273
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:23,201
Rym: One chaingun is that you can run at normal speed and it's the normal chaingun.

274
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,376
Rym: one chaingun fired like did twice as much damage But you're real slow.

275
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,690
Rym: and it also made a bunch of like lens flaring effects.

276
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:37,548
Rym: So people would like see where you were and then one of them was crazy ridiculous bullshit strong But you couldn't move while you were firing it.

277
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:40,801
Rym: They all that class also had a pod.

278
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:46,923
Rym: you could stick on a wall and when you stuck it there It's shot out a laser as far as it could and just sat there.

279
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:49,853
Rym: if anyone touched that laser Instant death.

280
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:53,545
Rym: and that laser disappeared after like 30 seconds or so.

281
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:55,090
Scott: So it's like it's a long time.

282
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,041
Rym: Yeah, but then there were other things but to like widely disparate powers.

283
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:02,150
Rym: So there's a character in overwatch called bastion.

284
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,892
Rym: He's a robot.

285
00:19:03,313 --> 00:19:04,878
Rym: He has a regular machine gun.

286
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:12,292
Rym: when he's running around one of his powers is shift into now I am just a turret mode much like the gun I see.

287
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:20,240
Rym: Yep, but his other power is he can heal himself Instead of shooting but you can't shoot while healing yourself.

288
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:20,681
Scott: Nope.

289
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:21,664
Scott: It's a hide some way.

290
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:23,630
Rym: But meanwhile, there's another character.

291
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,835
Rym: Remember that laser.

292
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:28,290
Rym: so symmetra is a character who has like this weird close-range weapon.

293
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:38,170
Rym: She can leave little turrets around that stop that hit people and slow them down and do increasing damage over time like tribes - she can Also throw down a teleporter.

294
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,376
Scott: Okay, that's a tf2 thing.

295
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:44,407
Rym: Yeah, so in weapons factory the engineer could build a sentry and a teleporter.

296
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:48,830
Rym: in this game There's one character who can make sentries and another one who makes teleport.

297
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:54,130
Rym: Yeah, and they so basically it's like they took all the core ability made a lot more character choices, right?

298
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:57,370
Rym: I mean, well, there's actually fewer character choices than weapons factory.

299
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:03,637
Scott: Really when I see pictures of overwatch, it's like a hundred freaking characters about the same compared to like tf2 Where there's only like a handful?

300
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:03,998
Scott: Yeah.

301
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,304
Rym: Well tf2 is way limited.

302
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:06,530
Rym: weapons factory had more like weapons.

303
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:12,070
Scott: You think are they gonna keep making more characters like a MOBA until eventually there's a screen with like a million rectangles?

304
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,375
Rym: I don't think so.

305
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:16,646
Rym: They have said it's never gonna be pay to win.

306
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,884
Scott: when you play competitive Do you have to like draft characters like a MOBA?

307
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:20,770
Scott: you can you can match?

308
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,929
Rym: So basically each team just picks their team.

309
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:26,186
Rym: It tells you if you're the attacker of the defense and show you what the other people are picking.

310
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:29,339
Rym: No But you can change intramatch.

311
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,978
Scott: So it's like oh you can change in the middle of the game Yeah, so when you're dead, you just be like, nope.

312
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:33,722
Rym: I'm gonna be diva now.

313
00:20:33,842 --> 00:20:34,566
Scott: Okay, so like any?

314
00:20:34,988 --> 00:20:38,021
Scott: yeah, okay Yeah, so can you let yourself on purpose to switch?

315
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:40,923
Rym: Ah, you might have to go do it in the environment I don't know.

316
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:44,359
Rym: if there's a Yeah, you can fall.

317
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:47,470
Rym: there's no falling damage, which is more like quake, but you can just jump off the edge.

318
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,322
Rym: You can jump off the edges.

319
00:20:48,383 --> 00:20:52,630
Rym: Okay The maps have a lot of nooks and crannies and nonsense and they're real big.

320
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:54,131
Rym: Like.

321
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:59,647
Rym: basically that tribes big no, but they're like weapons factory big if not bigger.

322
00:20:59,947 --> 00:21:09,579
Rym: They're bigger than counter-strike Yeah, yeah, but like in weapons factory the marine had like a grappling hook to fly around Rockets and Could leave these little mini centuries.

323
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:11,970
Rym: so they took the centuries away gave that to another character.

324
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:16,290
Rym: The rocket character can just fucking fly like crazy has concussion rocket.

325
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,253
Scott: It's a rocket jumper.

326
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:18,557
Rym: just actually fly so you can.

327
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:22,530
Rym: you can tribes to fly and you have a boost rocket jump.

328
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,470
Rym: That has a cooldown time and you have a concussion grenade.

329
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,090
Rym: You can also use the rocket jump with if you really wanted to and you just have rockets.

330
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:31,770
Scott: All right, so they do give you a lot of stuff to work with.

331
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:45,890
Rym: So you you have the same almost the same number of options as Team Fortress 2 but they're all so different and so Satisfying to play that it is the closest game to this I can possibly describe is weapons factory.

332
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:52,473
Rym: This is literally the successor to weapons factory for quake 2 wholly and thoroughly So.

333
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:56,070
Rym: I play it every day for at least a few hours and my friends list is huge.

334
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:59,724
Rym: I can always get like six friends to play together the boys like.

335
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:00,667
Rym: everything just works great.

336
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:01,390
Scott: Everyone's playing.

337
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:08,490
Rym: Even if I play by myself I use like I'd say about 70% of the games I get into just by myself are good.

338
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:09,872
Rym: And the way?

339
00:22:09,993 --> 00:22:10,796
Rym: the matchmaking world?

340
00:22:10,836 --> 00:22:12,101
Scott: I think there's some things I've heard.

341
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:14,570
Scott: for example, they're aggressively banning cheaters.

342
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,205
Rym: So that's like yeah if you get so if you get caught cheating, you're just banned forever period.

343
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:21,250
Rym: you're banned for life And they keep information about you.

344
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:28,862
Scott: So if it looks like people have tried all sorts of ways to like like buy the game again And they just keep getting rebanned no matter what people have tried.

345
00:22:28,942 --> 00:22:45,853
Scott: I've read that somebody I don't know if this is true somebody rebought the game with a different account and a different credit card and a different address and put it on a different computer right and Then they went through like a VPN so that they wouldn't know where the person was playing from and after playing for a few minutes They were rebanned.

346
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:50,004
Scott: I don't know how that's technologically possible, but good job Blizzard.

347
00:22:50,345 --> 00:23:00,330
Rym: So yeah, they are so serious about anti-cheat and They seem like they're also pretty see like while they don't have the same like counter-strike thing yet.

348
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,769
Rym: We're like I get people banned from counter-strike all the time.

349
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:06,889
Rym: But it is like if you make a group and play by default.

350
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:11,590
Rym: You're in a voice chat just with your friends and you have to opt into the team chat.

351
00:23:12,013 --> 00:23:14,550
Rym: So it's like our four friends and then you go in as a group.

352
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:18,509
Rym: It'll find two randos or group of two and stick them in your team and then start the match.

353
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:24,569
Rym: Everything about this game is great and there is room for people who have never played an FPS before.

354
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:28,666
Scott: that Yeah, cuz you're gonna get match makes with other garbage players like, you know, everyone is.

355
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:29,650
Rym: oh so even better.

356
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,967
Rym: It includes a mode where you can practice against a eyes.

357
00:23:33,027 --> 00:23:34,869
Rym: includes the mode You can just walk around the maps and check it out.

358
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:39,450
Rym: It includes a mode where there's a special map that has a bunch of enemies doing different things.

359
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:42,689
Rym: Like it's like a giant playground where you can just practice.

360
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:49,730
Rym: And it has a tutorial like the original half-life 1 tutorial that literally teaches you how to have to walk.

361
00:23:50,071 --> 00:23:52,217
Scott: Yeah to aim tracer runs on screens.

362
00:23:52,237 --> 00:23:53,461
Rym: Like I'm gonna run over to the right.

363
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:54,284
Rym: now watch me.

364
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:55,969
Rym: You're not looking at me.

365
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:57,196
Rym: Look at me.

366
00:23:57,277 --> 00:23:58,708
Rym: turn use your mouse and look at me.

367
00:23:59,894 --> 00:24:01,129
Rym: This game is so good.

368
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:05,061
Rym: Now it's it's good because people who don't have like.

369
00:24:05,382 --> 00:24:11,950
Rym: I have this history with games like weapons factory Where I was kind of obsessed with them and this is what a team fortress 2 was supposed to be for me.

370
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,496
Rym: So I'm like prime.

371
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:22,850
Rym: this is like it's like if someone made a new advanced wars Rym just starts playing this game But people who have never played FPS is before are getting into this game equally strongly.

372
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:24,401
Rym: That says a lot.

373
00:24:24,442 --> 00:24:29,482
Rym: this game is Possibly the best FPS in the genre since weapons factory.

374
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:30,185
Rym: for quick to know.

375
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:31,509
Scott: there have been a lot of competition.

376
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:40,518
Rym: really Well, also the people who may also tribes to the people who made it said straight-up games like action quick to where they're like primary Inspiration sure like they know what's up.

377
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:41,059
Scott: Yeah.

378
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:49,663
Scott: I mean, you know, anyone who's making an FPS knows about these People because they don't follow up on what they write.

379
00:24:49,703 --> 00:24:51,048
Scott: what they know right is they?

380
00:24:51,068 --> 00:24:53,180
Scott: you know They think they're smarter than the.

381
00:24:53,461 --> 00:24:55,171
Scott: you know, the old good stuff It's like.

382
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:58,750
Scott: no, all you had to literally do is take action quick to and change the graphics to make the modern.

383
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,130
Scott: You don't have to do anything else, but yeah, we'll clean it up a little bit.

384
00:25:01,331 --> 00:25:04,871
Rym: I think they know better like an action quick to or in a weapons factory Like.

385
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:11,630
Rym: you had a lot of options that were just like way inside the Pareto frontier like not worth using.

386
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:20,622
Rym: Yeah, and this game is everything is extremely well balanced characters are hard counters for each other And I'm gonna play it pretty much right after Scott leaves the apartment.

387
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,430
Rym: In fact, our friends came out this weekend.

388
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:25,621
Rym: They brought their computers so we could land party play the game all weekend.

389
00:25:25,882 --> 00:25:26,424
Rym: And we did.

390
00:25:26,444 --> 00:25:28,170
Scott: you could have just played from their house.

391
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:30,634
Rym: Well land party.

392
00:25:31,357 --> 00:25:35,009
Rym: What's different also how you get just hard to go a few days without oh the other thing.

393
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:39,930
Rym: Even my old ass computer runs it fine like a surface pro for you can play.

394
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,680
Scott: I mean blizzard games run and everything.

395
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,240
Rym: That's how they do right even runs on Mac But like this seems to even run on my laptop.

396
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:50,884
Rym: like this game runs real graphics down Yeah, but not that not as far down as you think.

397
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,998
Rym: it's kind of like Counter-Strike Go where it's.

398
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:59,766
Rym: they take a lot of shortcuts in the rendering So it looks great, but they cheat to make sure it'll work on your video card.

399
00:25:59,907 --> 00:26:08,377
Rym: Yeah things of the day Cuz.

400
00:26:08,397 --> 00:26:09,329
Rym: I'm so into overwatch.

401
00:26:09,532 --> 00:26:17,216
Rym: So there's a thing it does Where after every game like one you can vote for people like commend them like you did a good job like it shows like the four Top players based on various heuristics.

402
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:21,029
Rym: I mostly vote up whoever was being like support or healing or like help me out.

403
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:38,990
Rym: But they also do a play of the game where the game tries to Algorithmically decide what like the craziest or most important moment in the victory or whatever happened in the game was and it's like Overwatch play of the game and sometimes it shows a really epic moment.

404
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:46,390
Rym: Sometimes it shows me as Trobjorn literally just dying and then I'm laying there dead while my turret kills a bunch of people.

405
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,710
Scott: Right, so it detected that you got a bunch of kills at that moment.

406
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:49,970
Scott: So I thought that was the play of the game.

407
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,803
Scott: But really it was your turret getting a bunch of and I was just literally laying.

408
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:56,619
Scott: it shows you because you're the one who was Doing the killing and the cameras too dumb.

409
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,410
Scott: the camera should focus on the people getting killed not the person doing the kill.

410
00:26:59,430 --> 00:26:59,792
Scott: Well, we'll see.

411
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:00,816
Rym: cuz the thing is it also.

412
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:03,910
Scott: camera also should try to get the killer and kill II in the in the same.

413
00:27:04,052 --> 00:27:05,029
Rym: Well, it's even more than that.

414
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:15,169
Rym: You don't want to necessarily have it always be whoever did the most killing in a clever way because sometimes the play of the game Is well, it's a kills per in a short burst Five kills within like ten seconds.

415
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:17,056
Rym: Sometimes the play of the game must like

416
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:17,638
Scott: someone

417
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:29,644
Rym: use their resurrection power cuz like the team got wiped except for the healer and they Like raise the whole team on the spot like at a critical moment and then everyone's there and they win like there's the moment that won the game or like the play of the day.

418
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:34,589
Rym: basically and It blizzard appears to be because the algorithm seems to be changing.

419
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:45,012
Rym: They I think they're putting a lot of effort and trying to tune that thing to where it'll find if not the best play at least always something that's very satisfying to watch and Satisfied.

420
00:27:45,192 --> 00:27:45,313
Rym: like.

421
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:48,182
Rym: I got to tell you it's pretty rare because you know, there's 12 people.

422
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:58,769
Rym: It's rare that you are the play of the game But when it happens you feel real cool unless it's something dumb like you're lying Like I'm lying there dead in my turds doing all the work which has happened a few times.

423
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:09,610
Rym: So the other thing that's happened is that people are using the play of the game Aesthetic to make wonderful memes like there's one guy that the demolition guy like there's grenades and things everywhere.

424
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:17,370
Rym: His power is this he basically spins up this Mad Max tire full of explosives and then drives it off to blow up on somebody.

425
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:29,730
Rym: So people made an overwatch play of the game that shows him like ha ha ha and then it cuts to a real clip of A monster truck tire just like rolling down the highway and then eventually hitting someone.

426
00:28:30,831 --> 00:28:40,485
Rym: so the meme of an overwatch player and then a real-life event that somehow evokes that player is Something that has been thoroughly amusing me of late.

427
00:28:40,948 --> 00:28:47,810
Scott: Hmm so It's summer which means and also in video game land these steam summer sales coming up soon.

428
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:50,718
Scott: You know get your Gabe end videos ready.

429
00:28:50,738 --> 00:28:52,484
Scott: Yeah, it's a money raining down.

430
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:57,178
Scott: But here on steam There's actually a game that's on sale right now that you can buy.

431
00:28:57,198 --> 00:29:01,235
Scott: this game cost you 54 cents because it's usually 99 cents And it's 45% off.

432
00:29:03,095 --> 00:29:05,150
Scott: And this game is called summer sale.

433
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:08,785
Scott: Experience summer sale without losing money while you lose 45 54 cents.

434
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,585
Scott: But yeah, it's the game that simulates the steam summer sale.

435
00:29:13,665 --> 00:29:16,073
Scott: It's a candy box, but 54 cents.

436
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:19,363
Scott: I say award this person for their great humor.

437
00:29:19,664 --> 00:29:24,566
Rym: It's funny how it took me Several seconds when Scott told me to click on the link.

438
00:29:24,606 --> 00:29:25,190
Rym: I'm looking at it.

439
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,104
Rym: I'm like steam summer sale, but is this just the same?

440
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:29,290
Rym: something like it took me a minute to realize?

441
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,976
Scott: Oh, it's on steam steam page.

442
00:29:31,996 --> 00:29:34,985
Scott: It's a steam game page for a game called summer sales.

443
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:35,747
Scott: No dog.

444
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:36,970
Scott: It's steam summer sale.

445
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:43,169
Rym: Okay, what took my brain a minute to figure that out and then it was legit funny even after I explained it to you.

446
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:44,761
Scott: Could you click on the thing at the day?

447
00:29:44,802 --> 00:29:45,730
Scott: Like you still might be like.

448
00:29:47,491 --> 00:29:51,570
Rym: So in the meta moment, the book club book will be Oryx and Craig by Margaret Atwood.

449
00:29:52,052 --> 00:29:54,984
Rym: I am plowing through the last wheel of time book Scott.

450
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:56,229
Rym: I know everything about that tower.

451
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:57,576
Scott: now Tell me all the tower stuff.

452
00:29:57,637 --> 00:30:00,271
Scott: No, tell me no tell me the tower It's.

453
00:30:00,411 --> 00:30:03,280
Rym: it's actually real complicated and how complicated could it be?

454
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,347
Scott: Oh this snake people.

455
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:06,330
Scott: they have powers.

456
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,987
Rym: It would take me about 20 minutes to actually explain what the deal is.

457
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:10,550
Scott: I got time.

458
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,170
Scott: It's just less time than it take me to read 14 fucking books.

459
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,947
Rym: It didn't take me long to read those books less than 20 minutes.

460
00:30:16,951 --> 00:30:19,119
Rym: But that but don't you also want to know about like the Dragons?

461
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:20,886
Scott: there used to be dragons.

462
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:21,970
Rym: Well, what about them?

463
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:22,912
Scott: They're dragons.

464
00:30:22,932 --> 00:30:23,354
Scott: They have wings.

465
00:30:23,394 --> 00:30:23,896
Scott: They breathe fire.

466
00:30:23,937 --> 00:30:24,780
Rym: What's up with the taint?

467
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:26,246
Rym: Like what is that?

468
00:30:26,347 --> 00:30:27,110
Rym: Why taint?

469
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:27,732
Rym: What do you say?

470
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:28,456
Rym: is that voice?

471
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:29,924
Rym: and Wren said really lose Theron?

472
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:35,018
Rym: Yeah Let's just say that a bunch of stuff went down.

473
00:30:35,078 --> 00:30:37,490
Scott: isn't he just like inhabited by the spirit of lose Theron or whatever?

474
00:30:37,771 --> 00:30:39,176
Rym: It's just the book series.

475
00:30:39,197 --> 00:30:42,550
Rym: The only way to act like it's literally faster to read the books than to read the wiki.

476
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:45,641
Scott: Yeah, but it's not faster than the 20-minute explanation.

477
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:47,730
Rym: Yeah, but that would just be to explain the tower.

478
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,275
Rym: Anyway, I'm gonna be done with those books.

479
00:30:49,737 --> 00:30:53,790
Rym: I'll know everything there is possibly to know except I'm not going to read.

480
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:57,182
Scott: I was at the bookstore and saw a supplementary appendix type.

481
00:30:57,262 --> 00:31:03,259
Rym: Yeah, so I was about to say I'm not going to read that Because I looked into it and there are apparently some inconsistencies.

482
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:17,299
Rym: if you look at that in addition to the books and Also, I don't care about the actual power ranking of all the guys to die literally numbered from most powerful to least powerful Literally every single one in the entire series.

483
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:17,961
Rym: Okay.

484
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:19,326
Rym: There are a lot of them.

485
00:31:19,507 --> 00:31:28,370
Rym: Let us say But yeah, Oryx and Craig Margaret Atwood though with the way the American politics are going I feel like the Handmaid's Tale might be a more relevant one to read.

486
00:31:29,392 --> 00:31:31,288
Rym: But we'll do Oryx and Craig because that's what we said we'll do.

487
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,920
Rym: Kinetic count is coming up that stay tuned for that.

488
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:36,567
Scott: That's actually scarily soon.

489
00:31:36,587 --> 00:31:43,029
Rym: Yeah Otherwise, hopefully we'll see you at PAX Prime If you're cool, yeah.

490
00:31:43,712 --> 00:31:46,182
Rym: And if not, seriously buy tickets to PAX South like we'll be there.

491
00:31:46,242 --> 00:31:48,169
Rym: PAX South is great and you can just buy them.

492
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,080
Rym: now You just go click and you'll have badges.

493
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:51,730
Rym: You can just go click and have a hotel.

494
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:54,061
Rym: That's like a one-minute walk away from the convention.

495
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:55,086
Scott: It'll be warm.

496
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:55,669
Scott: Yeah.

497
00:31:57,433 --> 00:32:06,374
Rym: So if there's one thing that I complained about a lot At least up until about a decade ago when I didn't give it yet anymore is grinding in games Like I have.

498
00:32:07,117 --> 00:32:11,049
Rym: there was a time in my life when I actually think my stupid kid brain enjoyed it.

499
00:32:11,493 --> 00:32:25,679
Rym: yep, like leveling up in Final Fantasy 1 when I was in elementary school felt like it was a very productive thing and like I would really Like like I'd like I'm gonna go I'm gonna fucking get that silver sword and I'd be walking back and forth Fight like two ogres go to the inn.

500
00:32:25,699 --> 00:32:28,010
Scott: Pokemon Pokemon was the turning point for me.

501
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:32,590
Scott: Like when I started playing Pokemon, I was like all grind and I didn't even notice it was a problem.

502
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,193
Scott: It's just like we.

503
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:34,158
Scott: this game is amazing.

504
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:44,632
Scott: And then before I beat it, I was like Walking back and forth back and forth killing Pokemon back and forth back and forth kill a Pokemon and it was like this sucks Fuck this.

505
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:47,520
Scott: Yep, and that's what I you know, I realized.

506
00:32:47,861 --> 00:32:51,450
Rym: so we started thinking about that because it's it seems like a really simple topic.

507
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:55,296
Rym: But if you really broaden it What is grinding?

508
00:32:55,316 --> 00:32:58,670
Rym: because that actually means very different things depending on the kind of game you're playing.

509
00:32:59,071 --> 00:33:02,023
Scott: Yeah, there's so many other grinds out there besides the.

510
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:03,830
Scott: you know, most people JRPG grind.

511
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,421
Scott: Yeah, most people just think of the RPG grind like you.

512
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:16,130
Scott: you do the same thing over and over again Usually mindless tasks in order to you know increase numbers in order to do other things right like Fire Emblem.

513
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:22,590
Rym: You can be clever and beat the game low-level or just kill a bunch of people and the numbers will be high and then You don't have to solve the puzzle.

514
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:29,030
Rym: You just have the rabbit girl and the night guy just marry each other and then they single-handedly kill literally fucking everyone in the game.

515
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:32,859
Rym: Yeah, didn't even make anyone have kids because kids are useless like.

516
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,570
Scott: but there's such a wide variety of grinds out there.

517
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,750
Scott: Right, there are grinds of the candy box variety where you just wait you do literally nothing.

518
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:45,151
Scott: It's not like you have to keep fighting bad guys and do random encounters Like you.

519
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:50,454
Rym: there's there's the alternate candy box grind where you actually have to keep clicking As much as you want.

520
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:52,280
Scott: even less mindless then.

521
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,510
Scott: it's even more mindless than an F in our JRPG combat.

522
00:33:55,651 --> 00:34:04,770
Scott: It's like you literally you just click you just do some Completely manual no thought task over and over again, but there's also some grinds where you actually do a complex test, right?

523
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:08,130
Scott: Think about something like a rune factory or a harvest moon.

524
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:15,150
Scott: It's like every day You got to check the plants and walk around town and maybe go on an adventure and you got to do all these things.

525
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,732
Rym: Oh my god.

526
00:34:15,993 --> 00:34:19,347
Rym: in a more reason Pokemon the third time all my berries were dead.

527
00:34:19,467 --> 00:34:20,050
Rym: I just fuck it.

528
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,870
Rym: I never grew a berry again, right?

529
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:30,159
Scott: It's like there's so many things you have to do some of which require like actual thought and like planning out your garden Like what are you gonna plant where and when?

530
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:30,380
Scott: and like.

531
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,402
Rym: this is actually a lot of stuff to do But the planning is the only thing that matters.

532
00:34:34,442 --> 00:34:35,630
Rym: the doing is mine, right?

533
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:42,585
Scott: But it's like but then you have to push all these buttons and you have to do it Oh every single day of the game because the game has days right?

534
00:34:42,605 --> 00:34:43,710
Scott: It's like there's a complex task.

535
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:54,010
Scott: It just takes a long time To do all these things and that's how you progress is by you know Sticking to do you know having discipline and keeping doing this thing over and over again.

536
00:34:54,250 --> 00:35:00,210
Rym: Where most people seem to get really mad or at least start to have opinions about grinding other than just like why'd you do?

537
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,350
Rym: Your stupid grind and don't shame me in my mindless entertainment is with MMOs.

538
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:09,244
Rym: Because at least in a JRPG like if you like to grind you just grind.

539
00:35:09,304 --> 00:35:12,609
Rym: if you don't like to grind you just cheat And skip it and who cares?

540
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:19,369
Rym: but in an MMO You have to grind in order to get better in order to level up.

541
00:35:19,831 --> 00:35:23,970
Rym: But by you grinding you now become more powerful than other people.

542
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:32,941
Scott: But you had to spend time and effort or at least so someone else for example pays money to do To do because I level up instead of spending time.

543
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:34,186
Scott: That's not fair.

544
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,752
Scott: I had to spend time Yep.

545
00:35:35,812 --> 00:35:38,609
Scott: Now if it's a non-competitive, it's like did you enjoy what you did?

546
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:39,999
Scott: Yeah, but then don't.

547
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:41,550
Scott: why do you even fuck about what other people did?

548
00:35:41,612 --> 00:35:44,469
Rym: Yep Cuz I like it like Borderlands is even a better example of this.

549
00:35:44,711 --> 00:35:49,510
Rym: Borderlands is a single-player game or a like local friend or remote friend co-op game.

550
00:35:49,912 --> 00:35:58,429
Rym: Yet if you want to play at the same level as your friends You literally have to grind just so the numbers are arbitrarily at the same level or it's not fun.

551
00:35:59,232 --> 00:36:02,945
Rym: And if you choose not to either the game sucks for you or it sucks for your friends.

552
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:06,090
Rym: and when people suggested Why don't you let people just pick their level?

553
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:12,390
Rym: The amount of butthurt coming from people who thought that was somehow unfair to them on the internet was ludicrous.

554
00:36:12,912 --> 00:36:16,342
Rym: Right, I suspect that overlaps heavily with people who like ready player one, but I digress.

555
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:17,886
Scott: so so why does?

556
00:36:18,046 --> 00:36:19,230
Scott: why is grinding a thing?

557
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:19,572
Scott: Right.

558
00:36:19,593 --> 00:36:20,288
Scott: So here's the deal.

559
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:23,080
Scott: Sometimes when you play a game, right?

560
00:36:23,402 --> 00:36:27,335
Scott: Let's say you go out and you play Soccer, right?

561
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:28,762
Scott: You play soccer you.

562
00:36:29,224 --> 00:36:32,903
Scott: the more you play soccer You get better at it, right?

563
00:36:32,963 --> 00:36:33,426
Rym: There's an edge.

564
00:36:33,446 --> 00:36:36,119
Rym: Well, there's a touch case But this varies a lot.

565
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:38,350
Scott: this isn't like a guarantee to get better, right?

566
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:43,274
Scott: I mean, there's plenty of kids out there playing soccer like and they're super into it and There's all.

567
00:36:43,294 --> 00:36:45,444
Scott: they're not becoming like fucking Ronaldo, right?

568
00:36:45,826 --> 00:36:47,121
Scott: Even the professionals They're not.

569
00:36:47,182 --> 00:36:47,510
Scott: you know.

570
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:51,290
Scott: It's like how many kids out there playing hockey and how many of them are Wayne Gretzky?

571
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,835
Rym: Well, I think none of them.

572
00:36:52,955 --> 00:36:54,402
Rym: like I ski and I always get better.

573
00:36:54,482 --> 00:37:04,930
Rym: Emily started skiing after me And she'd continuously got better at a pretty steady rate but but I've known people who have skied as long as me and Basically hit this plateau and literally never got better, right?

574
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:10,970
Scott: There's a people seem to have a limit that they hit to where they can't get better without doing something different.

575
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,096
Scott: Maybe they need extra help or more alert.

576
00:37:13,577 --> 00:37:19,333
Scott: They hit, you know limits where without something extra mixing things up They can't improve.

577
00:37:19,915 --> 00:37:24,350
Scott: even with more practice people seem to also get better at different rates.

578
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:36,187
Scott: there are two people who start doing the same thing at the same exact time like two kids take piano lessons at the same time and After a week later They've practiced the same amount and one of them can play twinkle twinkle little star and the other one still can't.

579
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:36,970
Rym: well Scott that happened.

580
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:37,777
Rym: It was in two ways.

581
00:37:37,817 --> 00:37:44,190
Rym: Like we both got Street Fighter 5 You played it a little more than me and then a month later video wasn't the same amount of practice.

582
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:50,368
Rym: Yeah But because I put a little bit less practice in that just snowball now was Fox and then the opposite.

583
00:37:50,388 --> 00:37:52,717
Rym: remember we both bought Harmonicas and then a month later.

584
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,541
Rym: I was like to turn around.

585
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:58,340
Scott: you were like and that's - I didn't practice Because I had no discipline.

586
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,235
Scott: well, okay, I didn't want to do it So I didn't enjoy doing it.

587
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:05,070
Rym: and then you just got you got to mesmerize by that cool guy with his video.

588
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,339
Scott: At least it was only five bucks.

589
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:09,272
Scott: Yeah ever cost anyway Right.

590
00:38:09,693 --> 00:38:14,170
Scott: So when you're playing a video game, right say like Street Fighter, right?

591
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,504
Scott: If you want to get better at Street Fighter guile doesn't level up.

592
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:18,850
Scott: You have to level up.

593
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,042
Scott: It's the same as playing soccer or tennis, right?

594
00:38:21,123 --> 00:38:22,310
Scott: You have to get better at it.

595
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,749
Scott: You the human being right has to get better at the game.

596
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:34,032
Scott: So some people based on their skill level They might not be a person who's good at something like Street Fighter or because Street Fighter is fucking Impenetrable.

597
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:38,910
Rym: with all this nonsense and no good tutorials follow Daryl Surratt on Twitter if you want to see some details of that lately.

598
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:39,733
Rym: Right, you can't.

599
00:38:39,853 --> 00:38:47,735
Scott: you just can't get better without learning secret information that even the pros can't answer my fucking questions that I have for Them right about the game Shit like that.

600
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:51,729
Scott: So, you know you get frustrated with something like that when you play say a JRPG.

601
00:38:52,493 --> 00:38:53,761
Scott: It doesn't matter who you are.

602
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:55,390
Scott: It doesn't matter what your skill level is.

603
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:04,393
Scott: Right, as long as you're at this minimum level of confidence Which is pretty much any human being who's literate and knows how to use a controller, which is everybody I know pretty much.

604
00:39:05,055 --> 00:39:13,270
Scott: if you just keep playing you don't get the human being you doesn't improve at all Right, but your character in the game There's.

605
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:17,721
Rym: the numbers just fucking go up and the illusion you of progress.

606
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:30,930
Scott: you feel as if you you get the same emotional feelings that you that in satisfaction and gratification you get from Actually getting better and achieving mastery at something without actually achieving mastery anything.

607
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,570
Scott: It's like practice that's guaranteed to work and guaranteed to always make you better.

608
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:35,858
Rym: Oh, I think it was.

609
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:47,938
Rym: I think it was Dave Riley on fast karate But he because he was talking about ready player one which is why I referenced it before and he pointed out that ready player one is almost like a celebration of Someone who spent their life like.

610
00:39:48,038 --> 00:39:56,986
Rym: instead of someone who spent their life like getting good at weapons factory or tennis It's someone who spent their life getting good in quotes at grinding out potions in Final Fantasy 11.

611
00:39:56,986 --> 00:39:59,414
Rym: Mm-hmm And like.

612
00:39:59,474 --> 00:40:08,153
Rym: that's the kind of person who is into that book because it's the illusion of progress But actually it's just a candy box in practice Right.

613
00:40:08,213 --> 00:40:25,528
Scott: So if you make a game like this the game will be really satisfying to a lot of people because you know They play it they're doing some kind of thing that is somewhat fun and interesting But they keep getting rewarded for what they do like a rat in a you know, a Skinner box constantly getting bits of cheese,

614
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:26,230
Rym: right?

615
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,040
Rym: It's like actually we give them cheese and a non constant rate.

616
00:40:29,101 --> 00:40:31,510
Rym: They'll act even more crazy for it, right?

617
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,118
Scott: I mean, it's like that, you know and it's like.

618
00:40:33,138 --> 00:40:38,068
Scott: it's like hey, you're fighting all these, you know Skags and scag gold scag.

619
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:47,250
Scott: But if you do that enough eventually you get like cheese in the form of crazy ridiculous weapons And your level goes up and now you feel super powerful.

620
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:54,497
Scott: But really all it means is that skags change into a different model in a different part of the map But you're still doing the same fucking thing.

621
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:56,928
Scott: It's just the numbers are bigger and it looks cooler.

622
00:40:56,948 --> 00:40:57,591
Rym: now There's.

623
00:40:57,651 --> 00:40:58,595
Rym: this is where already.

624
00:40:58,635 --> 00:40:59,278
Rym: this is why I like.

625
00:40:59,298 --> 00:41:04,229
Rym: doing this as a panel or a show is already sort of complex single-player versus multiplayer.

626
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,716
Rym: There's completely different discussions.

627
00:41:06,837 --> 00:41:12,849
Rym: a single-player game like Deus Ex human revolution or even like the old system shock Like your dude levels up in the course of the game, right?

628
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:17,350
Rym: And in laws gives like Symphony the Night like you level up your shit in the core for the course of the game.

629
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:22,608
Rym: Yeah in a single-player game while you are leveling up as a person or else you won't be good at the game.

630
00:41:22,628 --> 00:41:35,090
Rym: the Escalation of the numbers and the powers and the other things adds to that like they complement each other both to make the game feel Very expansive but also to sort of like unlock more abilities as the game goes on.

631
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:49,276
Rym: So that sort of grind like in a single-player game can be used to make a game more immersive more effective like sure the crazy axe takes more human skill to use in days of root dawn of DS Dawn of Sorrow.

632
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:59,810
Rym: that one the crazy axe at the end, but at the same time Leveling up to get that axe like getting the axe feels really good too Even though I know I kind of just ground it out.

633
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:05,941
Rym: It was like this good balance between grind and satisfaction and because there's no competitive element You don't have to do it.

634
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:06,569
Rym: who cares?

635
00:42:07,312 --> 00:42:09,910
Scott: Now when there is a competitive element you get all sorts of problems, right?

636
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:18,590
Scott: For example, if there's a game where you can grind like save MMO But you can grind on your own and then you get into a fight with someone like maybe a Diablo or something.

637
00:42:18,631 --> 00:42:29,170
Scott: It's like whoa You played the game for 30 hours and I played it for 10 and now we're gonna fight even if I'm better at you than At this game you or just have bigger numbers than I do because you put more time into it.

638
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:34,510
Scott: We might as well just automatically give the trophy to whoever has already spent the most time and not even bother playing.

639
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:40,670
Rym: Yep, no amount of skill can overcome the loot or gear or level difference in a lot of these games, right?

640
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:50,310
Scott: It'd be like, you know if you imagine if you were a baseball player professional baseball player and you go and you you know You get your bat and you go up to the plate and the pitchers out there and you're like what the fuck is that?

641
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,819
Scott: And he's got like a tiny tiny golf ball.

642
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:53,341
Scott: He's throwing.

643
00:42:53,382 --> 00:42:55,530
Scott: it's like where the fuck he has to throw baseball.

644
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,693
Scott: What's up with this bullshit?

645
00:42:56,713 --> 00:43:00,123
Scott: And it's like actually he's been playing baseball for like 20 years.

646
00:43:00,484 --> 00:43:02,048
Scott: So he's allowed to throw this ball.

647
00:43:02,068 --> 00:43:04,153
Scott: Yeah And it's like.

648
00:43:04,173 --> 00:43:08,830
Scott: that's fucking bullshit, right, you know, it's like what he ground out in the league for so long.

649
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:13,419
Scott: He gets this but you know, it's like and then when the guy gets up to bat He's got like this giant metal bat.

650
00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:14,986
Scott: that's got like a rocket on the back of it.

651
00:43:15,006 --> 00:43:15,870
Scott: It's like what the fuck is that?

652
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,661
Scott: He's like, well, actually he's been in the league for 15 years.

653
00:43:18,701 --> 00:43:19,946
Rym: So it's baseball simulator 1000, right?

654
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:27,209
Scott: He's allowed to have that even though the rookie has to have like a tiny stick and has to throw a beach ball.

655
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,396
Rym: now It gets even worse.

656
00:43:28,436 --> 00:43:30,188
Rym: cuz remember how we just talked about when you're.

657
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:39,070
Rym: you know When you when you use this mechanic to grind something It's partly because it either augments or replaces the actual progression of the skill of the human.

658
00:43:39,813 --> 00:43:43,770
Rym: So the human transfers the progression of the character unto themselves.

659
00:43:44,435 --> 00:43:46,329
Rym: So they feel like they accomplish something.

660
00:43:46,632 --> 00:44:02,570
Rym: So now if you let someone shit But if you let someone else skip the grind by paying money Then the player who grounded out Feels cheated even if they have no logical reason to feel cheated because they feel like their accomplishment was literally just taken from them

661
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:04,058
Scott: Because it

662
00:44:04,098 --> 00:44:04,561
Rym: was really.

663
00:44:04,863 --> 00:44:08,036
Scott: it's really just you know Truth-telling right?

664
00:44:08,077 --> 00:44:10,530
Scott: They couldn't handle the truth, which is that you fucking wasted your time.

665
00:44:10,971 --> 00:44:14,864
Scott: You spent hours to change numbers in a database that could have been changed with a single line of.

666
00:44:14,924 --> 00:44:20,816
Rym: but that's the danger of using character progression to Substitute for human progression.

667
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:25,550
Rym: the more you use that the more the truth will hurt the people who play your game.

668
00:44:25,811 --> 00:44:34,466
Scott: But the other thing is that you could almost argue that like hey, we're simulating what in the real world You actually do have to grind things out to get better at them, right?

669
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:35,370
Scott: It's like you don't get better.

670
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:36,857
Scott: It's something like miraculously.

671
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:39,209
Rym: So see this is where it could be used for good if you like.

672
00:44:39,752 --> 00:44:45,396
Rym: Counter-strike actually does this really well and Overwatch actually does something similar.

673
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,139
Rym: So a counter-strike.

674
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,770
Rym: There's the real ranking the competitive ranking.

675
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:52,350
Rym: But there's also this bullshit rank that just goes up the more you play.

676
00:44:53,153 --> 00:45:00,770
Rym: So the fact that there's two ladders there to like ranks for your character Means that the people are pros like they know that the one is just bullshit.

677
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:10,467
Rym: They only pay attention to the real one, but everyone else Even like they're playing counter-strike and they're getting better at whatever rate their human brain and body get better at.

678
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:15,810
Rym: but the game Gives them this sort of like separate indicator of you've been playing it a lot.

679
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,037
Rym: So like you're getting better like it ranks you up ranks you up.

680
00:45:18,459 --> 00:45:32,756
Rym: that causes people who might otherwise get discouraged or quit because they Don't recognize their own progress Which is a real problem if you have good matchmaking because you'll always feel like you're at the exact same skill level forever Unless you have some context to show that you're not Like.

681
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:36,630
Rym: imagine if right matchmaking was perfect You would always win 50% of the time forever.

682
00:45:36,973 --> 00:45:42,987
Rym: You would never feel like you got better at the game Unless you could zoom out watch a video of you playing the game be like, oh wow, it's Neo vs.

683
00:45:43,027 --> 00:45:43,348
Rym: Neo.

684
00:45:43,389 --> 00:45:56,609
Rym: Okay So You can use this mechanic like counter-strike does to encourage people to keep playing the game which will then cause them Most of the time to get better while at the same time have a separate ranking system for the pros that actually matter to them

685
00:45:57,011 --> 00:45:57,112
Scott: Mmm,

686
00:45:57,695 --> 00:46:00,330
Rym: so there are ways to use this for good not just for evil.

687
00:46:00,651 --> 00:46:02,500
Scott: Well, there's other situations where it's like.

688
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:04,630
Scott: is it grinding or is it not right?

689
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:06,779
Scott: So look at something like all the mobas out there.

690
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:09,070
Scott: whenever you play a MOBA you got to level up in that MOBA.

691
00:46:09,532 --> 00:46:13,350
Scott: Right, you know that they're always like everyone starts at level one every time the game starts.

692
00:46:13,712 --> 00:46:15,301
Scott: So it's not an unfair thing where it's like.

693
00:46:15,321 --> 00:46:16,368
Scott: I've been playing mobas for 30 years.

694
00:46:16,892 --> 00:46:23,689
Scott: I got to start with level 20 guys like everyone starts level one and we level up as we play the MOBA and then when we start another round everyone's level one again.

695
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:24,417
Rym: but See, that's all.

696
00:46:24,477 --> 00:46:27,795
Rym: that's like a versus Stateless grind.

697
00:46:28,137 --> 00:46:30,330
Rym: so it's like a competitive grind like you know what?

698
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,055
Rym: You know what has the exact grinding?

699
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:34,264
Scott: is that it's like who can grind the best?

700
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:35,930
Scott: It's like who can grind the fastest.

701
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:37,537
Rym: Yep, so you and so it's again.

702
00:46:37,557 --> 00:46:38,682
Scott: There's actually a it's.

703
00:46:38,843 --> 00:46:40,410
Scott: it's actually almost not a grind.

704
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,783
Scott: It's like you're testing this skill of who.

705
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:43,990
Scott: can you know?

706
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:48,544
Scott: Do these tasks better than other people and then we're just not going.

707
00:46:48,564 --> 00:46:50,310
Scott: you know you were at any time.

708
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:56,969
Scott: You can like sort of like actually try to fight the other people and see who's better and there's actually some skills to that, too.

709
00:46:57,712 --> 00:47:02,830
Scott: But you know if somebody was better at one part then you're not gonna be able to beat him at the second part.

710
00:47:02,931 --> 00:47:03,716
Scott: So they minion.

711
00:47:03,756 --> 00:47:08,138
Scott: they beat you at game a you know Come after you in game B, and you'll be in screw.

712
00:47:08,218 --> 00:47:10,004
Rym: Dominion in a way does the same thing.

713
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:20,390
Rym: the mechanics of playing Dominion are Minimal in terms of the actual play of the game But the real game is you look at the state you look at your opponents like all the cards that are available.

714
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:24,265
Rym: You come up with a strategy of how am I gonna grind out victory points to win this fucker?

715
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:25,670
Rym: and then separately?

716
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:29,403
Rym: There's the execution which gets harder over time like you got to keep track.

717
00:47:29,423 --> 00:47:31,090
Rym: like how many of those cards do I have in?

718
00:47:31,733 --> 00:47:32,617
Rym: How many cards are in my deck?

719
00:47:32,677 --> 00:47:33,220
Rym: is the total?

720
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:34,788
Rym: is it time to start?

721
00:47:34,828 --> 00:47:37,957
Rym: DPT Yep, and MOBAs is the same way.

722
00:47:37,977 --> 00:47:38,218
Rym: you're like.

723
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:39,503
Rym: you're both like the competitive.

724
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,708
Rym: like there's a there's this morass You have to fight your way through.

725
00:47:43,192 --> 00:47:48,709
Rym: Everyone picks a strategy and a path as a team to fight their way through it And then you're eventually gonna bump into the other team.

726
00:47:49,091 --> 00:47:52,504
Rym: Whoever got a little bit further as a huge advantage still sort of a problem.

727
00:47:52,524 --> 00:47:54,110
Scott: because let's say I'm really good.

728
00:47:54,415 --> 00:47:56,274
Scott: Let's say you know I'm a person where I'm.

729
00:47:56,354 --> 00:47:57,137
Scott: actually I'm not.

730
00:47:57,237 --> 00:48:02,430
Scott: but let's pretend that I was the kind of person who was really good at like Combat in the MOBA, right?

731
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:11,470
Scott: so you give everyone characters that are all the same level with the same amount of gold and shit and I just kill everyone because I'm just so fucking good at this game.

732
00:48:11,912 --> 00:48:21,320
Scott: But if I'm not good at that first part and I get into a situation We're like, I'm level 7 and everyone else is like level 10 I just get blowed up because I'm not good.

733
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:26,830
Scott: the first that grindy game ends up becoming You know more important than the combat II game.

734
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:30,570
Scott: It's like even it doesn't matter how good you are the second one if you can't do the first one.

735
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:36,610
Rym: So the grinding game is actually more important Which is interesting because you look at the pedigree of MOBAs and they sort of come out of this idea.

736
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,880
Rym: You know Warcraft 3 basically.

737
00:48:39,342 --> 00:48:41,210
Rym: so they come out of this idea that you know.

738
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,330
Rym: There's a bunch of goons and basically it's just competitive.

739
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:47,369
Rym: Everyone stand there and level up until someone's leveled up a little bit more than someone else.

740
00:48:47,532 --> 00:48:49,838
Scott: All right Then I can go and fight you because I'm stronger than you.

741
00:48:49,898 --> 00:48:51,083
Scott: watch out here I come like.

742
00:48:51,283 --> 00:48:55,181
Rym: obviously the modern MOBAs have gone Way beyond that but that's kind of the core mechanic.

743
00:48:55,281 --> 00:48:57,070
Scott: It's still the core mechanic.

744
00:48:57,633 --> 00:48:58,015
Scott: There's other.

745
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:05,649
Scott: they layered a whole bunch of stuff on to it to make the different parts more interesting Like, you know, I know the heroes of the storm is like events on the map and all this kind of.

746
00:49:05,669 --> 00:49:19,818
Rym: you know It's all kind of things going on But there's always a danger if you have that kind of progression in a game then things like build orders like Starcraft style Matters so much that not memorizing those just you can't even come to the table.

747
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:31,530
Scott: Mm-hmm Where to get the payoff from the game is just too fucking time-consuming, right?

748
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:38,369
Scott: so let's say I go to the store and I buy something like Final Fantasy 21 and It's I paid money for this.

749
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:42,890
Scott: It's full of all these videos and all the story and this carries so much stuff in there, right?

750
00:49:42,971 --> 00:49:44,668
Scott: And I want to experience a whole bunch of it.

751
00:49:45,193 --> 00:49:52,569
Scott: But in order to experience a whole bunch of it I have to spend time pushing a bunch of buttons mindlessly before I'll get to the next bit of it.

752
00:49:53,132 --> 00:49:56,070
Scott: It's like that's fucked up, especially in a single-player thing.

753
00:49:56,391 --> 00:50:05,830
Scott: Imagine if you went to the store and you bought Lord of the Rings on DVD and after 15 minutes And the first movie it stops and it says hey you want to see the rest of the scenes?

754
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:10,850
Scott: Well, you can't see them unless you push this button for like an hour and then we'll show you the next scene in the movie.

755
00:50:10,931 --> 00:50:12,570
Scott: It's like fuck you I paid for this.

756
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:15,724
Scott: I just want to watch the whole fucking thing right now and of course like here's.

757
00:50:15,764 --> 00:50:17,431
Rym: here's so Final Fantasy 4.

758
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,402
Rym: Here's a not really a counter example, but a more nuanced example.

759
00:50:20,744 --> 00:50:22,350
Rym: That game is random encounters and boss fights.

760
00:50:22,471 --> 00:50:25,230
Rym: Yeah, it also has very limited resources.

761
00:50:25,471 --> 00:50:33,961
Rym: so I mean you could grind out like I'm gonna skip this part but you could like fight random counters and grind out to like Level up and get infinite money and then go through.

762
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:38,569
Scott: but I just go just hang around near a town Keep going to the inn if you're not willing to do that.

763
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:50,847
Rym: There is a skill a pretty significant and interesting skill game there I actually enjoyed as a kid and I played Final Fantasy 4 again like five or six years ago And I actually enjoyed it despite that grind.

764
00:50:51,390 --> 00:51:01,069
Rym: now I got a little sick of the grind at a few points along the way But the idea that for example, I gotta go into the Silf cave to get the thing It's like this ordeal of all right.

765
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:06,209
Rym: how what resources do I need to bring in like how many potions do I actually need to bring in to deal with this?

766
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,139
Rym: and Then each encounter is a puzzle of.

767
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:11,189
Rym: do I fight it if I do fight it?

768
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,950
Rym: What is the optimal path through this particular encounter?

769
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:15,776
Rym: Right because it is my resource right.

770
00:51:15,816 --> 00:51:26,130
Scott: if you grind it less and you want to get the game done quicker You can save time by you know going in with less, you know less levels less potions less.

771
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:34,549
Scott: You know now this where you can spend more time up front getting more potions And then it'll be a breeze to go through the cave, but you know you spent more time on it.

772
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:53,470
Rym: Yep, so the other thing the original Final Fantasy 4 did was that the boss fights were fucking Disaster parties like they were so hard at that the trick like figuring out the patterns and the tells and figuring out how to beat The guy was actually like more powerful than grinding up to a certain point.

773
00:51:53,492 --> 00:52:01,310
Scott: Yeah In order to in order to level up enough to beat a boss without Trouble like with like just a wrecking Rubicon without actually knowing his deal.

774
00:52:01,471 --> 00:52:05,230
Scott: They were just so powerful that you couldn't really do that without spending an inordinate of time.

775
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:11,419
Scott: You had to learn like aha on this boss You have to use reflect after he wiggles and then he'll spell will bounce back at him And you'll kill him really easily.

776
00:52:11,439 --> 00:52:12,629
Scott: we had to figure that out.

777
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:19,150
Rym: So also Final Fantasy 4 American kids tended to turn this off But in the basic original Japanese mode.

778
00:52:19,652 --> 00:52:26,798
Rym: Combat was actually semi real-time and all the time you spent like in windows and menus like thinking and clicking around Bad guy just kept doing yep.

779
00:52:26,878 --> 00:52:29,188
Rym: He just kept attacking so it was really like oh shit.

780
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:29,590
Rym: What do I do?

781
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,181
Rym: No, no, I used the potion on the wrong person.

782
00:52:31,261 --> 00:52:32,067
Rym: fuck ah.

783
00:52:32,088 --> 00:52:36,230
Rym: and That made the game actually really stressful and skill base.

784
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:43,930
Scott: Compare this to Final Fantasy 1 where as soon as you get to elf town where the silver sword is you walk around outside That town until you can afford to buy yourself a silver sword.

785
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:52,970
Rym: Unless you're on Awesome games done quick with like some memorized random seated route You're gonna go get the silver sword before you try to beat astos.

786
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:53,815
Scott: Yeah, you're getting.

787
00:52:53,876 --> 00:52:56,150
Scott: and you know what if you got two fighters you're getting fucking two silver.

788
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,295
Rym: So yeah, you are fuck.

789
00:52:57,315 --> 00:53:00,008
Rym: that shit was 8,000 gold by two silver sword.

790
00:53:00,028 --> 00:53:10,077
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it doesn't matter if it takes you two hours walking around outside that elf town You're fucking doing it because if you don't and you try to go in the next place without any silver swords You're not killing shit.

791
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:11,524
Rym: There's also an interesting.

792
00:53:11,544 --> 00:53:27,090
Rym: You know you're killing the white mage Survive but in when like when I was a kid like I would play Final Fantasy 1 and beat it About once a year and like I knew my path through the game and I just go through the motions again.

793
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,599
Rym: Like I knew my strategies.

794
00:53:28,881 --> 00:53:39,561
Rym: I had the strategy I came up with that I did like easily 20 times in my childhood where I go all the way up until I could get the airship Having only beaten one fiend.

795
00:53:39,581 --> 00:53:41,189
Rym: you have to beat at least one fiend to get that far.

796
00:53:41,931 --> 00:53:47,557
Rym: Then I would go around and do everything in the game Except beat the four fiends.

797
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:50,490
Rym: then I'd go back and beat all the fiends real easily.

798
00:53:50,771 --> 00:53:56,830
Scott: Yeah, cuz you'd have all the shit, but like and it was weird because I did similar stuff in Zelda 1, right?

799
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:59,804
Scott: So in Zelda 1 there's not grinding in Zelda 1. right and you can be.

800
00:53:59,864 --> 00:54:02,395
Scott: I could beat Zelda 1 and like Maybe under an hour.

801
00:54:02,415 --> 00:54:02,877
Scott: I don't know.

802
00:54:02,897 --> 00:54:04,022
Scott: I don't know what the maybe that's.

803
00:54:04,122 --> 00:54:05,046
Rym: you could grind out.

804
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:06,070
Scott: I can tell the world.

805
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:07,170
Scott: I don't know what the world record is.

806
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:10,990
Scott: I might be getting the time way off but I can beat Zelda 1 very quickly.

807
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:17,230
Rym: You could grind out multiple times in a day grind out coins and then buy the blue ring before you do anything, right?

808
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:21,810
Scott: So that's what I end up doing is like if there's things that are if there is equipment available to me, right?

809
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,197
Rym: I will go around and get like every.

810
00:54:24,298 --> 00:54:25,240
Scott: I'll get bombs.

811
00:54:25,361 --> 00:54:27,086
Scott: I'll get them all the heart containers.

812
00:54:27,187 --> 00:54:29,314
Scott: I'll get a blue candle I'll get a blue ring.

813
00:54:29,535 --> 00:54:32,987
Scott: Like I will get everything I can get before going into dungeons.

814
00:54:33,007 --> 00:54:36,670
Scott: Yep as a kid I would fuck I would go get that rat because I know right I know where the.

815
00:54:37,713 --> 00:54:41,024
Scott: You gotta get the raft in dungeon 3 but I would go anything 3.

816
00:54:41,024 --> 00:54:44,348
Rym: get the raft come out get the heart container Then go back in and beat the boss.

817
00:54:44,691 --> 00:54:50,010
Scott: Okay, but it's like I would usually go to dungeon 2 because dungeon 2 is so coin rich.

818
00:54:50,171 --> 00:54:51,217
Scott: Yeah, right.

819
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:53,410
Scott: and then I like wouldn't do dungeons.

820
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:57,590
Scott: I would just get all the free coins that are in this, you know secrets to everybody.

821
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:03,559
Scott: Because like once you get the coins from level 2 you can buy the blue candle You can secret to everybody then you can get the blue ring.

822
00:55:03,921 --> 00:55:05,687
Scott: then you can you know buy bombs.

823
00:55:05,747 --> 00:55:06,690
Scott: you can buy everything, right?

824
00:55:06,952 --> 00:55:09,130
Scott: You're getting bombs from a blue octorok or blue moblin.

825
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:17,174
Rym: Anyway, even way early I'd go into the dungeon and get the magic book because while everything else that dungeons unbeatable And when you're the magic book is right there at the job He's going to get it.

826
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:18,180
Scott: you can sneak in and get it.

827
00:55:18,221 --> 00:55:20,796
Rym: Yeah, and then as soon as you get that wand That's a white sword.

828
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:21,380
Rym: Yeah.

829
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:22,507
Scott: Well, I get the white sword.

830
00:55:22,567 --> 00:55:23,070
Scott: I don't need the one.

831
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,690
Scott: I never use the wand really except for fun.

832
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:29,390
Rym: But yeah, but the wand once you have fire is a white sword that shoots all the time, basically, right?

833
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:30,049
Scott: But you know.

834
00:55:30,131 --> 00:55:34,140
Scott: So it's like I get all this stuff Before actually going to do the dungeons.

835
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,250
Scott: and the dungeons are so easy because it's like dude.

836
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,937
Scott: I'm in dungeon 3 and I guess what I'm getting.

837
00:55:37,997 --> 00:55:40,165
Scott: I got a ring and a white sword.

838
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:46,723
Rym: I somehow was a kid Legitimately enjoyed Grinding through Final Fantasy 1 once a year.

839
00:55:46,803 --> 00:55:48,170
Scott: I enjoyed leveling up pokemons.

840
00:55:48,672 --> 00:56:00,390
Rym: So you can't even just say like even I know people who are adults though enjoy leveling up pokemons Yeah But I'm saying that is a that that is a legitimate aspect of gaming that I cannot deal with anymore.

841
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,706
Rym: No But as a kid I did deal with and I know people who still deal with.

842
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:09,900
Rym: so it's a Part of gaming that can be used for good for bad for evil.

843
00:56:10,261 --> 00:56:12,266
Rym: Like it is a very nuanced topic.

844
00:56:12,647 --> 00:56:14,976
Rym: Mm-hmm So maybe we should do a panel on it.

845
00:56:15,016 --> 00:56:16,303
Scott: Yeah, don't waste your time.

846
00:56:16,323 --> 00:56:19,239
Scott: Yeah We're only gonna live so long.

847
00:56:19,299 --> 00:56:19,882
Scott: How much are you that?

848
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:21,190
Scott: how much of the limited short life?

849
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:21,512
Scott: Do you have?

850
00:56:21,532 --> 00:56:24,508
Scott: do you want to spend press an a go and fight fight fight?

851
00:56:24,669 --> 00:56:28,610
Scott: Yeah I mean the one thing I can how much time you wanna play Dragon Quest?

852
00:56:28,873 --> 00:56:30,390
Scott: Kill slime kill slime kill slime.

853
00:56:31,976 --> 00:56:44,831
Rym: when I would beat Final Fantasy 1 once a year was like second grade when my life was a blur of Video games and family events and I don't know what else I did in my entire like childhood I got

854
00:56:44,851 --> 00:56:48,509
Scott: to say the Dragon Quest is the most disappointing because like those games are like.

855
00:56:49,053 --> 00:56:53,219
Scott: Everything is so good about them except for the grinding part But the grind is so bad.

856
00:56:53,259 --> 00:57:00,409
Scott: if I could play a Dragon Quest without grinding That would be like the most glorious thing cuz you could shoot slimes and it's like there's so much stuff is you know?

857
00:57:00,891 --> 00:57:16,000
Rym: Oh, man, what's also interesting though is like I my favorite AGD cues recently are Like the Final Fantasy 4 one where they it's just fun They did a speedrun of Final Fantasy 4 No grinding in case you didn't know new listeners.

858
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,726
Scott: Rym is a big Final Fantasy 4 fanboy.

859
00:57:17,746 --> 00:57:18,388
Scott: It always has been.

860
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:22,878
Rym: yeah I Was like for whatever reason that game.

861
00:57:22,918 --> 00:57:27,175
Rym: just really I guess it was the perfect storm of Like.

862
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:32,162
Rym: I was in the anime already When Final Fantasy 4 came out or two in the United States.

863
00:57:32,724 --> 00:57:34,209
Scott: and finally six is just better, right?

864
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:38,101
Rym: Uh, I like them both equally actually for very different reasons.

865
00:57:38,743 --> 00:57:39,385
Scott: six is just better.

866
00:57:40,027 --> 00:57:42,730
Scott: I'm not saying four is bad I'm just saying six is better.

867
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:43,615
Rym: I think I could.

868
00:57:43,715 --> 00:57:43,937
Rym: I could.

869
00:57:44,077 --> 00:57:56,523
Rym: Moore's for is probably is easily the second best For actually almost has a more at like the fat the moon The fact that you go to the moon and the core of the earth I mean, he found a fantasy legend through.

870
00:57:56,543 --> 00:57:57,670
Scott: your dad is a stealth bomber.

871
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,158
Scott: You're not gonna compete with the moon does?

872
00:57:59,178 --> 00:58:01,390
Rym: the final lesson three wasn't actually a Final Fantasy game.

873
00:58:01,632 --> 00:58:02,320
Scott: I know it doesn't matter.

874
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,250
Scott: Your dad is a stealth bomb.

875
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:04,795
Rym: Also Final Fantasy legend one.

876
00:58:05,076 --> 00:58:09,210
Rym: you're in a tower of searching for heaven and remember how you find heaven like right away.

877
00:58:09,932 --> 00:58:14,700
Rym: Yeah, no that game is good - yeah Legend - was a lot like Final Fantasy 6.

878
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,365
Scott: actually, I wish I could stream those games.

879
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:17,008
Scott: It's not easy.

880
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:18,934
Scott: Uh emulator Yeah, it sucks.

881
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:21,261
Rym: But maybe ah, maybe I should.

882
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:27,710
Rym: I could play those games again cuz while they're grindy They're also more way more puzzling those games and they're also shorter.

883
00:58:28,152 --> 00:58:31,670
Rym: Yeah, and as a kid like I couldn't get past some parts that I had a lot of trouble with.

884
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,610
Rym: I think my adult brain would just not have trouble with that.

885
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:42,180
Rym: I beat one in three and ever beat - - is actually - as though there's a lot of fourth wall breaking like there's one moment Because it has a lot more cutscenes than one in three.

886
00:58:42,301 --> 00:58:43,607
Scott: I never even played - I don't think so.

887
00:58:43,627 --> 00:58:51,470
Rym: at one point There's this whole plot where like your dad ran away like, you know That's a fancy trope of like your dad's dead and your mom like he's a self bomber.

888
00:58:52,004 --> 00:58:57,024
Rym: Yeah Well in all the regular games your dad's dead like it or both your parents are dead.

889
00:58:57,625 --> 00:59:00,810
Rym: in Final Fantasy legend games Your parents aren't actually dead.

890
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,228
Rym: There's just some bullshit going on with them.

891
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:06,709
Rym: and the Final Fantasy legend - your mom's like your father ran away and I don't know.

892
00:59:06,729 --> 00:59:12,070
Rym: and You keep finding people who look like your dad, but they're not your dad and then eventually you find your dad.

893
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:12,746
Rym: He's kind of a schmuck.

894
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:39,435
Rym: but there's a scene like there's a lot of cutscenes where you like come up to a door and then it like shows you what's going on in that room and it's like the mini like the minor bosses of the game and they're In there and they're like making their evil plans and there's a bunch of chests and then you're like, oh fuck I'm gonna fight them I'm gonna open those chests and then your theme music starts playing and then the bad guys like oh shit That's their theme music.

895
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:42,204
Rym: They're here and the three guys literally open the chest.

896
00:59:42,485 --> 00:59:43,870
Rym: There's badass items in them.

897
00:59:44,211 --> 00:59:53,879
Rym: They take the items and they just run away and then you come into the empty room like well shit Yeah, oh I would be remiss also just not mention Chrono Trigger.

898
00:59:53,899 --> 00:59:57,610
Scott: right Chrono Trigger the key there and a lot of other games do.

899
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:03,210
Scott: Also is that even though you've got a grind a bit right you there's no random encounters.

900
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,730
Scott: They don't force you into the grind, right?

901
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,076
Scott: It's like you can grind to your own.

902
01:00:07,096 --> 01:00:22,630
Scott: you control when you're gonna do it and when you're not it's like oh I'm just gonna not go bump into that bad guy and I won't have to fight him right now and you can sort of still do the things you want to do when you want to do them and Only grind when you need to grind or want to grind the exact amount you want Final Fantasy.

903
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:29,966
Scott: It's like you might just want to walk back to a town right now and it's like no here comes some begging Yep, which could be used to be terrifying.

904
01:00:30,006 --> 01:00:37,494
Rym: like as a kid I remember once I was I got the floater and I came out of that cave and I'm like, holy fuck I'm gonna get the airship.

905
01:00:37,795 --> 01:00:38,297
Rym: I'm gonna do it.

906
01:00:38,537 --> 01:00:40,965
Rym: I'm gonna do it, but I didn't have any tents.

907
01:00:41,567 --> 01:00:44,520
Rym: Mm-hmm And let's just say I didn't make it back to town.

908
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:45,324
Scott: Did you have a cabin?

909
01:00:45,847 --> 01:00:49,357
Rym: Uh, no, of course Kevin that's some rare luxury son.

910
01:00:49,377 --> 01:00:51,082
Scott: He said you have a tense.

911
01:00:51,123 --> 01:00:51,544
Scott: You never know.

912
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:54,018
Scott: Yeah might be already on Kevin Let the house.

913
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:54,748
Rym: house was good.

914
01:00:55,205 --> 01:00:58,488
Rym: Oh As long as it's not sweet home.

915
01:01:03,983 --> 01:01:06,520
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

916
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:11,400
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

917
01:01:11,641 --> 01:01:13,608
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

918
01:01:13,648 --> 01:01:16,660
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

919
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:24,340
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

922
01:01:32,411 --> 01:01:33,875
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

923
01:01:33,996 --> 01:02:03,487
Rym: It's actually recorded at night and the patrons for this episode of GeekNights in the amount of money that they give us on a continuing basis are Alan Joyce Rebecca Dunn Nicholas Brando Heidi McNichol Amanda Duchette James David White Christian open parenthesis cuts my state.

924
01:02:03,568 --> 01:02:03,868
Rym: e.com.

926
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:20,078
Rym: rare Lavelle Brian Sidroni Rochelle Montanota Finn Eric Silver on and the infinite sadness.

927
01:02:20,098 --> 01:02:27,530
Rym: kinetic man Aaron Cerise Chris midkiff Chris Knox flame dark fire Sam Corddry Daniel Redmond Chris had odd Sean Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

928
01:02:28,371 --> 01:02:30,776
Rym: That the episode we just did is actually a preview.

929
01:02:31,197 --> 01:02:41,563
Rym: We said one of the panels we submitted for Pax prime is called the grind and we're basically just going to talk about all those concepts in much more detail and with Citations.

930
01:02:41,905 --> 01:02:44,940
Rym: the other we submitted remember designing game rules.

931
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:50,880
Rym: Well, we're sort of rejiggering that panel to focus specifically on writing board game rules.

932
01:02:51,323 --> 01:02:59,220
Rym: So it's gonna be like 60% the same panel But with more examples, we're gonna drop the video game aspect and focus a lot more on the game design aspect.

933
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:00,690
Rym: So we'll see which.

934
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:11,569
Rym: if either they Schedule for Pax prime if somehow they schedule neither and it's the end of an era and we don't get to speak at Pax Then we bought tickets, so we'll be there anyway.

935
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:13,073
Rym: So yeah, see you there.

936
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:23,952
Rym: and now I leave you with something Particularly interesting and Try keep track of how long it takes you to realize what's going on here.

937
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:28,157
Media: theory that energy equals mass times the speed of light.

938
01:03:28,177 --> 01:03:31,922
Media: e equals MC squared Okay.

939
01:03:32,263 --> 01:03:37,020
Media: Now if you take that formula and we think there's a lot of mass, right?

940
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:45,219
Media: Okay, if you collapsed all the mass down into the universe, so there is no space between the mass.

941
01:03:46,265 --> 01:03:48,780
Media: Do you know how much mass there is in the entire universe?

942
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,867
Media: You think you're a lot of mass right?

943
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:53,557
Media: I'm a lot of mass right.

944
01:03:53,577 --> 01:04:03,800
Media: this building Okay Well, the whole universal mass can be consolidated down into the size of a bowling ball.

945
01:04:04,562 --> 01:04:07,171
Media: That's all there is in the whole world and the universe.

946
01:04:07,612 --> 01:04:09,800
Media: So how much mass are you?

947
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:13,407
Media: That's right an infinitesimal amount.

948
01:04:13,748 --> 01:04:19,842
Media: So if you take that formula e equals MC squared you can almost cross out Mass.

949
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:24,440
Media: so the formula ends up being energy equals the speed of light.

950
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:32,460
Media: Okay, and that's why the vision system is so important because we have lots of photoreceptors that receive light.

951
01:04:33,822 --> 01:04:44,019
Media: But when Hanuman died he the scientist didn't fall in his camp okay, and The pieces of the puzzle didn't fit well together.

952
01:04:44,682 --> 01:04:50,020
Media: So God and his infinite wisdom sent him another Einstein called Stephen Hawking's.

953
01:04:50,980 --> 01:05:04,620
Media: Okay, Stephen Hawking's gave us the string theory and what he discovered is that there are other Energetic particles in the universe and they're shaped like little you ease and what they do is they work by vibration.

954
01:05:05,721 --> 01:05:09,050
Media: So our body is so wonderfully designed.

955
01:05:09,471 --> 01:05:15,350
Media: We have light receivers and we have ears String vibratory.

956
01:05:15,652 --> 01:05:16,860
Media: they pick up vibration.

957
01:05:17,523 --> 01:05:28,940
Media: So if you add it to that theory Einstein's theory of relativity we have e equals MC squared that mass is crossed out almost and strings vibration.

958
01:05:30,062 --> 01:05:32,050
Media: But that still doesn't tell us the whole picture.

959
01:05:32,472 --> 01:05:34,180
Media: because what is a cell?

960
01:05:36,021 --> 01:05:42,373
Media: Right, okay, so a cell has Cell wall cell membrane cytoplasm.

961
01:05:43,116 --> 01:05:43,879
Media: Is that mass?

962
01:05:45,781 --> 01:05:47,150
Media: Not very much really right.

963
01:05:47,331 --> 01:05:48,176
Media: So what are that?

964
01:05:48,216 --> 01:05:48,779
Media: What is that?

965
01:05:49,960 --> 01:06:06,180
Media: You can break down the cells into tiny pieces of energy called electrons protons Neutrons, right Okay, so the whole body has an infinitesimal amount of mass, but what is the remainder?

966
01:06:08,071 --> 01:06:08,338
Media: Energy?

967
01:06:09,381 --> 01:06:11,248
Media: So I am energy.

968
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:12,351
Media: you are energy.

969
01:06:13,033 --> 01:06:13,254
Media: Okay.

970
01:06:13,475 --> 01:06:17,880
Media: Now if you go to study physics Energy cannot be created.
