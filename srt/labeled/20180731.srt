1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,794
Rym: It's Tuesday July 31st.

2
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:10,676
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,338 --> 00:00:13,904
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights side.

4
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:16,068
Rym: We're talking about rogue.

5
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:21,610
Rym: you like Rogue likes as in games that are like the game called rogue.

6
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:39,890
Scott: Let's do this All right, so earlier this year when it was fucking cold, and I perhaps foolishly agreed to bike ten Saturdays in a row Which is great except for the cold part everything else about it was great.

7
00:00:40,252 --> 00:00:41,096
Scott: There was one ride.

8
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:48,350
Scott: we went on and on the way home on that ride We hopped onto this bike path, and it went from someplace upstate.

9
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,770
Scott: I don't know where the hell we were all the way to Tarrytown, and I was like where the hell is this path been?

10
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,016
Scott: I've never seen it before.

11
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:56,183
Scott: no one ever told me about it.

12
00:00:56,263 --> 00:01:03,345
Rym: I've biked up there And I found like these really really great bike paths But I never was able to cobble together like a route around.

13
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:04,470
Scott: so I you know went online.

14
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,928
Scott: I found it and on Sunday Rym didn't want to come because I don't know why but I went out stuff to do.

15
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:19,715
Scott: I went Out to take the path and supposedly according to maps the path would take me from the Bronx to Brewster it where I would then Take the train home, so trying to find the start of the path I got to the Bronx.

16
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:27,270
Scott: okay because I'd been that down that way before But trying to find the beginning of the path near Van Cortlandt Park was not so easy.

17
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,108
Rym: There's a lot of like really nice two-lane bike paths up there that start at random points.

18
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:38,208
Scott: as I go Went into the woods in the mud and the various I saw bike like tracks in the mud.

19
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:38,609
Scott: so I was like huh?

20
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,729
Scott: I think I'm going the right way, and then I was slightly lost.

21
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:51,710
Scott: But I basically just gave up on finding the a real start of the path And I just went on the normal roads on like the 87 service road until I got to Tibbetts Park.

22
00:01:51,811 --> 00:02:02,710
Scott: Whatever that is yeah, then from there I was able to find the South County Trail way Which goes north and then becomes the North County Trail way which takes you all the way to Brewster.

23
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:11,994
Rym: So unrelatedly I was looking for a map of that bike path And I found something I didn't know about apparently the sprain Ridge Park bike trail Which I've heard of.

24
00:02:12,154 --> 00:02:15,790
Scott: yeah this there is another path someone posted about that's farther to the east.

25
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,608
Scott: It's not a bike, but it doesn't go as far, and it's not as you know.

26
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:19,950
Scott: It's it.

27
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,175
Rym: Oh, it's not a bike trail.

28
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:21,738
Rym: You know what it is.

29
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:24,369
Rym: It's a mountain biking park that I didn't know was there.

30
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:27,102
Rym: Oh, I can go mountain biking.

31
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:27,664
Rym: I'm sure Emily.

32
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:28,930
Scott: I'm sure it's not very mountainous.

33
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:32,170
Rym: I mean it looks like it's about on the level of Palau bin.

34
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:36,650
Scott: I mean the climb from the whole entire path was not much.

35
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:41,602
Rym: Mountain biking doesn't necessarily mean you're going up and down mountains sometimes.

36
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:43,930
Rym: It just means you're going straight over crazy obstacles.

37
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:45,860
Rym: Looks like it's more like that.

38
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,050
Rym: This is like what I did in Singapore.

39
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:51,049
Scott: Yeah, it was so nice to ride in this path because basically there's no cars.

40
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:53,657
Scott: There's nothing in the way is you know?

41
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:55,944
Scott: there's people all along it also using the path.

42
00:02:56,646 --> 00:03:02,230
Scott: the only thing I would do differently As I managed to have good timing and caught the 211 train back.

43
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:05,239
Rym: Yeah Cuz those upstate trains do not run that often on Sundays.

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,562
Scott: if I had missed it which would have been a close miss based When I left my house.

45
00:03:09,602 --> 00:03:13,784
Scott: I want to our weight I would had to wait an hour for the 311, but you know what I would do next time.

46
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:18,208
Scott: the only thing I do differently is Take the train there and bike back.

47
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:25,592
Scott: You're not gonna get lost trying to find the start of the path right you're not gonna have to worry about the train timing of Getting there.

48
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:31,456
Scott: yeah, yeah, you just wake up go to Grand Central take the train there and Once you're at the Brewster train station.

49
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:35,594
Scott: It's easy to get to the path, so then just bike home and bike home Whatever.

50
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:36,749
Scott: you're not gonna get lost in the Bronx.

51
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:37,655
Rym: Yeah, well the time.

52
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:42,549
Rym: because I do a thing like when I run my half marathons the route I take is to the top of Manhattan basically from here.

53
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,590
Scott: I also you know the trouble is I would just bike to Brewster and bike back, but that way to take a long.

54
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:48,820
Rym: Yeah, but same thing.

55
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:49,990
Rym: so I end my run.

56
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,643
Scott: I would have been home at like 8 or 9 and I'm at the top of Manhattan.

57
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:57,930
Rym: so my options are either just run home or Take the subway home.

58
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,110
Rym: And it takes like an hour to take the subway from the top of Manhattan back to here.

59
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:07,130
Rym: So I decided the last time I did it then I'm gonna take the subway there in the morning and just run back.

60
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,270
Rym: That way I'll end when I'm exhausted and feeling like crap in front of my own apartment.

61
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:16,510
Rym: Yep, as opposed to next to the only grocery store in the top of Manhattan.

62
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:23,410
Scott: So if you want to you want to come you should come because it's way good I'm up for it next time and I since now I now I totally know the way so you can just follow me.

63
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:23,993
Rym: See that's it.

64
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:26,203
Rym: you figured it out, and now I can come and read.

65
00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:27,590
Scott: I know the way in the reverse.

66
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:31,130
Scott: I'd still probably get a little lost trying to find it from the bottom.

67
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,390
Rym: I mean I remember a couple times.

68
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,945
Rym: I only went over the RFK one way because I wasn't really sure where the entrance was.

69
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:41,867
Scott: I figured out Randall's Island - I can Show you I know I know Randall's Island in excruciating detail.

70
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:42,231
Rym: now That's.

71
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:50,744
Rym: I figured I had a bike over the bridge to 125th Street because I have another route where I go when I do a loop Around Randall's Island, and then I come back over and run down in Queens anyway.

72
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:52,310
Rym: anyway in some gaming news.

73
00:04:52,884 --> 00:04:57,840
Rym: so valve Added a temporary fix for this fake item scam.

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,141
Scott: right.

75
00:04:58,161 --> 00:04:59,284
Scott: so I don't I'm not.

76
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:01,230
Scott: it's still not a hundred percent sure on all the details.

77
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:03,440
Scott: So if I'm wrong about anything, I'm wrong.

78
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:04,726
Scott: That's just how it's gonna be.

79
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:04,947
Rym: wait.

80
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:05,530
Rym: It's GeekNights.

81
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,823
Rym: I should be the disclaimer in literally every episode.

82
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:09,010
Scott: I might be wrong.

83
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:12,723
Rym: I'm likely wrong, but here's we reviewed games based on half a play.

84
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:14,630
Scott: This is what it seems to have happened.

85
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:17,370
Scott: It seems like there was some indie game called something.

86
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:24,912
Scott: So many game called something and it seems like it changed its name or something to try to trick Abstractism.

87
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:25,274
Scott: right.

88
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:28,286
Scott: so apparently the game was up to multiple scams at once.

89
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:32,526
Scott: scam number one It was just mining coins and all the reviews were like oh my god.

90
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:34,280
Scott: This isn't a game It's just mining my coins.

91
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:35,149
Scott: what the hell you know.

92
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:41,848
Rym: I wouldn't be surprised if battle tech were doing that because battle tech somehow maxes out my 1080 every time I play it.

93
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:47,334
Rym: yet both live streaming to two different streams Does not even touch.

94
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,460
Rym: overwatch like overwatch can do that fine.

95
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,329
Scott: Well, that's the difference between a indie studio and a blizzard.

96
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:52,770
Scott: yeah.

97
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:57,300
Scott: so the other thing is That apparently it.

98
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:08,850
Scott: This is the part I'm probably wrong about right is that there was some sort of fake item scam where basically this game had steam items that you could Trade and sell on the steam marketplace that were associated with this game.

99
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:27,235
Scott: They made their items look like valuable items from tf2 to trick the trick people into trading for this games items and thus they scanned people out of their valuable items and Got and to get monies.

100
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:28,820
Rym: this reeks very much.

101
00:06:28,981 --> 00:06:31,790
Scott: valve is basically giving people their legit items back.

102
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:40,549
Rym: I mean one on one hand like I don't want to blame the victim But you could have you could have figured this basically the steam.

103
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:45,170
Scott: look It's the steam equivalent of going on ebay and buying a picture of a macbook pro.

104
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:57,450
Rym: I'm gonna say that the statute of limitations ran out on this considering that the MMO is long gone.

105
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:59,350
Rym: But you might know I talked about it a lot.

106
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,521
Scott: I was having a minor minor minor resurgence right now.

107
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,103
Scott: for some reason.

108
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,830
Scott: there was actually a news about Wow.

109
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:10,953
Scott: First of all I see people in my you know battle net friend list playing Wow Which is strange.

110
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:12,980
Scott: I've seen news about Wow recently.

111
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,990
Scott: how like they're basically making everything free except for the new expansion.

112
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:18,359
Scott: So like you don't have to go and buy all the old expansions.

113
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:21,510
Scott: You can just play Wow and you'll get every old expansion.

114
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,641
Scott: I think that's what it said.

115
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:27,200
Scott: and also There's some bug in the Wow leveling.

116
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,330
Scott: that's happening, and they're fixing it or something.

117
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,437
Scott: There's some news about that huh.

118
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:35,573
Scott: so wow is having a minor resurgence I think because there haven't been MMOs And I think people.

119
00:07:35,593 --> 00:07:37,740
Scott: true it's been so long since MMO.

120
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,326
Scott: people are back on the MMO.

121
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:51,150
Rym: so in Sierras the realm yeah, okay, the only MMO Rym can talk about because the only one I played cuz I knew better But everybody gets one, but well no I played oh, but I really knew better.

122
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,753
Rym: I played what's it with you at RIT for a while the Korean grindy one Ragnarok.

123
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,218
Scott: we played that for like a week.

124
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,609
Rym: I kept playing it for a couple months, which maybe was a mistake, okay?

125
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:02,896
Scott: But I bash.

126
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:05,488
Scott: I never got beyond bashing slimes, and then I see errors.

127
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:05,830
Rym: the realm.

128
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:30,414
Rym: I had my main character and my brother as character and I had another character that I leveled up enough to be plausible who had a fake identity and generated a pretty reliable in-game gold income by crafting items that appeared to be very valuable items and Trading them or selling them with people who were too dumb to actually right-click on the item and look at the stats to see What it really was.

129
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:33,049
Rym: and I generated a handsome income with this.

130
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:40,423
Scott: That would be like if I had a magic card and at the top it said mox emerald But at the bottom it didn't say tab get a green mana.

131
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:44,567
Scott: It said tab do five damage to you, so Stop hitting yourself.

132
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,949
Scott: And I sold it to you for the value of mox emerald.

133
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:50,640
Rym: It's just it's interesting.

134
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:59,968
Rym: I think that the salient point Lose the game is that if you're gonna scan people in the modern era you can't just run one scam.

135
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:10,158
Scott: this game looks like It was multiple interleaved scams props to the scammers, but also because valve is fixing it, but yeah This just it's just more examples of valve.

136
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:11,622
Scott: you cannot get around this.

137
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:27,730
Scott: you need to pay fucking money all the zillions of dollars You make from steam and whatever to hire people and treat them well and have them human moderate Steam and choose which games go in and which games go out just like Apple does with the stupid Apple App Store.

138
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,797
Scott: Right because otherwise steam will be.

139
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:33,850
Scott: steam is right now sort of in between the Apple App Store and the garbage Google Play Store.

140
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,090
Rym: I mean, I would never search steam for a genre of game to see what's out there.

141
00:09:38,231 --> 00:09:41,330
Scott: No, it's like the Apple Store is like almost all human controlled.

142
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:43,981
Scott: It's very hard to get crap in there, but not impossible.

143
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:45,990
Scott: and the Google Play Store is just a fucking mess.

144
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:47,698
Scott: And steam is in the middle.

145
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:49,024
Scott: right and steam.

146
00:09:49,365 --> 00:09:50,330
Scott: you know the Apple Store.

147
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:58,039
Scott: They're legit criticisms of that method as well, but you know you steam basically has to do what the Apple Store does But not the evil part.

148
00:09:58,059 --> 00:09:58,924
Scott: It's just the good parts.

149
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:03,569
Rym: yep I mean if they really wanted to valve could have like its default stuff Google to do that, too.

150
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,536
Rym: But they could have the like.

151
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:07,343
Rym: yeah, here's where all the garbage is.

152
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:09,490
Rym: you can buy it if you want, but there be dragons there.

153
00:10:10,732 --> 00:10:14,655
Rym: Yeah, bad dragons not good dragons But not bad dragon.

154
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:18,849
Rym: so in some other news that's actually pretty interesting.

155
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,068
Rym: I Did not think this would ever happen okay?

156
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,198
Rym: But you might recall that a long time ago like I was still working at IBM I would think it was still God.

157
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:29,163
Scott: I think we're still.

158
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:29,646
Rym: yeah, well remember.

159
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,335
Scott: I was working at IBM Or just out of art.

160
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,421
Rym: it was in that era the mid 2000s.

161
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:37,630
Rym: the escapists was a magazine.

162
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:39,739
Scott: I remember I got the first escapist ever.

163
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:40,804
Scott: it was like a PDF cuz.

164
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:42,210
Scott: I tried to make it like a magazine.

165
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:49,770
Scott: It was a real magazine Form fancy looking articles, and you would flip the pages, and I don't remember was actually PDF, but it felt like a PDF.

166
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:51,901
Rym: Yeah, I think it was actually a PDF cuz.

167
00:10:51,941 --> 00:10:52,323
Scott: I've been.

168
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:53,710
Scott: it might have been a fancy website.

169
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:59,104
Rym: I remember getting emailed to me And I like read it at work right the PC.

170
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:05,210
Scott: the point is is that they're like hey We're doing highbrow games journalism digitally with fancy magazine looking stuff.

171
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:07,197
Rym: It was just original escapist.

172
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:10,870
Rym: people described it as the you know the New Yorker of video game journalism.

173
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:18,530
Rym: That's what it was for like a month yep And then it just got kind of hacky and bad and eventually it kind of got taken over by gamer.

174
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,246
Scott: Eventually it became the escapist that you know right the one that employed You know Yahtzee and all those other people.

175
00:11:24,286 --> 00:11:27,918
Rym: yeah But it had a lot of problems that we don't want to get into.

176
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,490
Rym: it was bad news, and I wasn't eventually died right?

177
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:33,399
Rym: I don't even know.

178
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,135
Scott: all I know is either Not telling.

179
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:49,593
Rym: I don't know either cuz the news is that Defy Media who owns the escapists And had been just ignoring it they sold it To let's see to Canada's Enthusiast gaming.

180
00:11:49,614 --> 00:11:54,809
Rym: so the escapist is now Canadian, and it's owned by this group called enthusiasts gaming which I didn't know anything about.

181
00:11:54,929 --> 00:12:03,313
Rym: okay I don't know either of these groups so but their goal is to bring it back and make it as good as what it Originally was.

182
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:04,396
Scott: so for that one week what?

183
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:08,087
Rym: and not let like gummergate bullshit infiltrate it and ruin it all right.

184
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:08,649
Scott: good luck with that.

185
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:19,470
Rym: I Would not even talk about this on gig nights But for the fact that there is a piece of information that makes me go from very distrustful of this to cautiously optimistic.

186
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:28,573
Rym: So the escapist former editor-in-chief like way back in the day Russ Pitts who you may know is running take this Didn't he?

187
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,107
Scott: wasn't he also like editor at?

188
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,757
Scott: Was a gamers with jobs?

189
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:33,563
Scott: was that what Russ Pitts?

190
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:34,429
Rym: is that what it was stuff?

191
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:37,648
Scott: I think that and I think I think that's Laura that worked with that.

192
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:37,809
Scott: right.

193
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:40,177
Scott: well Well, I think she wrote at gamers a job.

194
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:41,361
Scott: That's the first place.

195
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:45,631
Scott: I heard him was actually in the earliest days of podcast 2006.

196
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:52,264
Scott: I never read gamers of jobs, but I did listen to the gamers of jobs podcast Which I believe was Russ Pitts and another guy I forget.

197
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:54,620
Rym: yeah, so Russ Pitts I trust and for a lot of reasons.

198
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,030
Rym: I know him he's a good dude.

199
00:12:56,371 --> 00:13:04,778
Rym: But take this is a fantastic organization that provides the AFK rooms at conventions and does training for convention staff Among many other things.

200
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:07,090
Rym: yeah, just super stand-up, dude.

201
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:16,784
Rym: The fact that he is involved in this and is basically in charge of the new escapist Means that if there's if there's a chance for this to work.

202
00:13:17,286 --> 00:13:18,169
Rym: This is the chance.

203
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:23,259
Scott: Like I wouldn't trust my by escapist Why not just make something completely new?

204
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:31,750
Rym: well because escapist had a pretty good brand And it actually has a back catalog of a bunch of good long-form journalism that could be brought back or revisited.

205
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:34,693
Rym: There's a lot of reasons to bring it back I guess.

206
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:36,621
Scott: I guess when I guess they bought it right so they must.

207
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:38,769
Scott: there must be some value in what they bought.

208
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:43,889
Scott: you know The intellectual properties and yeah contracts or who knows what they've got hopefully not debts Yeah.

209
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:54,116
Rym: But Ross also made a good point on Twitter and because a lot of Gomer gate types were really invested in the escapist adjacent media And he pretty much said straight up.

210
00:13:54,577 --> 00:14:00,010
Rym: Yeah political extremists referring to gamer Gators are not welcome in this new outlet.

211
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:03,120
Scott: So We'll see how this goes.

212
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,610
Rym: I'm cautiously optimistic.

213
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:06,236
Scott: I wonder if that's a good strategy.

214
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:09,630
Scott: right of buying like buying media outlets, dude

215
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,356
Rym: I would have bought the Gothamist if I could have

216
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:18,642
Scott: where the audience is the enemy and then start publishing things that you know are Anti the the audience to then right like

217
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:19,004
Rym: two ways

218
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:23,489
Scott: to imagine if I could buy Breitbart And then suddenly only publish you know actually good stuff.

219
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,339
Scott: Yeah, actually publish real journals suddenly publish real news But I but I right like that cut.

220
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,123
Scott: is that a good idea.

221
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:29,564
Scott: I don't know.

222
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:30,750
Scott: or is that a bad idea?

223
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:36,165
Scott: I don't know like if I Go by Fox News and put legit journalism.

224
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:37,030
Scott: Here's the difference though.

225
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,397
Scott: Would that be a good idea or a bad?

226
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:41,090
Rym: Fox News and Breitbart were always vile garbage?

227
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,517
Scott: I mean, I guess this was.

228
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:44,769
Scott: I guess it could only help right it can't hurt.

229
00:14:45,313 --> 00:14:51,010
Scott: Yeah, it would hope because at least you'd get rid of the fox Even if you buy it and it fails, but here's the case.

230
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:53,900
Scott: Here's the case where the escape was already dead.

231
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,550
Scott: so if Fox News was already dead And off the air would it be worth buying it yeah?

232
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:04,949
Rym: I mean if I had the money I would have done anything possible to buy the Gothamist when it went down.

233
00:15:05,598 --> 00:15:26,790
Scott: so trivia the Person who was my boss two jobs ago his friends childhood friends I believe with Jake Dobkin the Gothamist guy and he his startup that he started after He left the company where I was working for him in Dumbo, Brooklyn.

234
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,750
Scott: It's apparently very successful, and he gave mad monies to the new Gothamist.

235
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:40,313
Scott: Interesting that he's a very interesting, dude He was involved with like the FBI raiding him for Apple to wears when he was a kid and such.

236
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:51,918
Rym: So in some other news if you are going to be at Gen Con Which I would not personally recommend Don't go to Gen Con.

237
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,216
Scott: if you live near, Indiana I still maybe it's worth.

238
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:56,797
Scott: It's okay.

239
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:59,544
Rym: We live on the same train lines.

240
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:00,507
Rym: the New York Comic Con.

241
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:01,610
Rym: We don't go to that nonsense.

242
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:05,346
Scott: Yeah, I mean Gen Con is a little better than New York Comic Con.

243
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:08,037
Rym: yeah But it's also got like.

244
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:09,081
Rym: I wouldn't do panels at it.

245
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:11,510
Scott: the thing with Gen Con is like has good parts and bad parts.

246
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,600
Scott: Right it's actually so you know what I might get.

247
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:15,530
Scott: actually good in a socially progressive way.

248
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,828
Rym: It's just bad in a convention management like gig nights would never perform at Gen Con.

249
00:16:20,868 --> 00:16:21,550
Scott: It's like Gen Con.

250
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:34,927
Scott: it's like you know the people they're good and the the content is good and all that stuff is just the Convention structure is bad, but if you are going to be there And you listen to gig nights, then you might be interested that Luke Crane.

251
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:46,641
Rym: Oh, you know Head of games at Kickstarter burning wheel dude among other things he has a game That he wants to play test at Gen Con?

252
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:50,950
Scott: pretty sure, but if you are hearing this now for the first time It's too late to get in on that game.

253
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:58,175
Rym: It's hard to say though because I feel like he's going to be selective about who he brings in and the things I know about This are that one.

254
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:04,425
Rym: he published a Twitter poll that was adjacent to this and the question was fuck elves Or I want to be an elf?

255
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:06,613
Scott: Rym wants to choose.

256
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:08,478
Rym: I want you both fuck elves and be an elf.

257
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:21,601
Scott: I Would choose fuck elves, but not in the way the Rym wants to and I'm more the way that like you know Fuck the Philadelphia Eagles and fuck elves.

258
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:23,390
Rym: You know there is a third way though the drow.

259
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:28,470
Rym: It's both fuck elves, and I secretly want to be an elf because I kind of am an elf anyway.

260
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:43,679
Rym: The other thing is Luke said to me specifically and I quote you will like this yeah I Hope they're Santa's elves and not oh great.

261
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,027
Rym: That would be super great, and it wouldn't change the answer to my question.

262
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:53,861
Rym: Maybe anyway You should check this out.

263
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,290
Rym: if you're gonna be at Gen Con.

264
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,880
Rym: There's rumors that we there might be able to.

265
00:17:58,121 --> 00:18:00,329
Rym: something similar might happen at PAX West so we'll see.

266
00:18:01,693 --> 00:18:04,085
Rym: If it happens, I'm gonna do everything I can to be involved in that.

267
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:25,904
Rym: but also If you are a fan of parsley games the Jared Sorensen variety like such games as danger town beat-down spooky man Action castle with torch hands They're going to be there and the parsley hardcover collection is out.

268
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,889
Rym: the Kickstarter is like done and everything.

269
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,969
Rym: yep.

270
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:29,790
Scott: So yeah, I kick-started it.

271
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,369
Scott: So I'm just waiting for my book to come in the mail.

272
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,189
Scott: But so originally the parts the games are published in individual pieces of cardboard which I have all of.

273
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:39,750
Scott: yeah But why not get all the games again in a hardcover book?

274
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,750
Scott: That's much more convenient.

275
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:45,625
Rym: And they are running events at Gen Con and I remembered why I don't like Gen Con.

276
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:52,065
Rym: two of the events are sold out And you can't go to them yep, but for two dollars on Saturday at 3 or 4 p.m.. That's okay.

277
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,637
Rym: I've put more money into arcade machines before.

278
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,647
Rym: you could play spooky manor or danger town beat-down And that's why we don't go to.

279
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:03,410
Scott: Jen Do you think Jared gets those two dollars?

280
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,037
Rym: No, I'm pretty sure Gen Con gets those two dollars.

281
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:09,789
Rym: Jared probably has to pay for the table that he's gonna have in the room.

282
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:15,610
Rym: Fucking Gen Con you're like so close and yet, so you just got rid of your stupid ticketing.

283
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,232
Scott: I'd be like well.

284
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:16,935
Scott: Let's go Jenga.

285
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:20,108
Rym: Yeah, good ticketing will never be a part of Pax.

286
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:22,327
Rym: unplugged That is the hill I will die on.

287
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:33,482
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

288
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:40,365
Scott: so this Rym Had for once an Respectable high quality thing of the day.

289
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:40,930
Rym: I'm rid.

290
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,870
Scott: This is a real good could not compete with my even better thing of the day.

291
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:50,493
Rym: So the problem is with Scott's thing is that my thing of the day is great because one my thing of the day It is great Mine is just greater.

292
00:19:50,593 --> 00:19:53,103
Scott: as usual my thing of the day you tried to step up.

293
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:57,500
Scott: you came up to my usual level of thing Of the day goodness, and then I stepped it up even more.

294
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:05,050
Rym: my thing of the day is a mathematical model That you can use to determine when you should leave a Mets game.

295
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:08,448
Scott: So I got a lot of stories about this.

296
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:11,596
Rym: I've been in some situations.

297
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,310
Rym: We left a hockey game a little early once because there was a snowstorm.

298
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:17,660
Scott: That was a fucking mistake all right, so I got.

299
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,805
Scott: I got two stories right.

300
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:21,138
Scott: so first of all when we were young We went to a lot of games.

301
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:26,817
Scott: Yeah, especially Mets games You know you would go home early because you drove there And you didn't leave early.

302
00:20:26,918 --> 00:20:30,725
Scott: if there was if there was if you're gonna lose the game There's no reason to stay to the end.

303
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:34,300
Scott: yeah Inning ninth inning why the hell would you stay to watch?

304
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:36,950
Scott: right you know anyway, and it's like not like hockey.

305
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,158
Rym: We're like something might have nothing's gonna happen.

306
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,262
Scott: You're all you're gonna.

307
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,370
Scott: Do is get home way later.

308
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,350
Scott: You're gonna sit in traffic in the parking lot.

309
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:47,390
Rym: It's like you know what I remember to get out of the Joe Louis arena.

310
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,322
Rym: We would sit in the parking garage for almost an hour.

311
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:52,084
Scott: yep exactly.

312
00:20:52,104 --> 00:20:53,729
Scott: so you want to leave before right?

313
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,050
Scott: yeah.

314
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,623
Scott: And nowadays though I go to MSG and everyone else.

315
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,090
Scott: they start leaving the game.

316
00:20:58,553 --> 00:21:06,484
Scott: Man if I drove here, I'd be leaving - yep, but I took the train No matter what happens, but anyway, so there was two notable incidents.

317
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:08,530
Scott: one notable incident, which is actually a Mets game.

318
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:21,030
Scott: We went to this mess game and I remember Kurt Schilling piece of shit douchebag was pitching and There was a rain delay like partway through the game and the rain delay went for a long time.

319
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:31,898
Scott: And you know it's a long rain delay when they start showing the videos of the two times the Mets won the World Series On the screen on the little TVs To keep you entertained while you wait.

320
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,230
Scott: Yeah, it went on for quite a while.

321
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:41,018
Scott: I think we waited at least maybe an hour or even longer and then the game didn't resume And it was still wet and the tarp was still on the field.

322
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:43,650
Scott: so we left in the car on the way home.

323
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:50,760
Scott: we're already in Stanford, Connecticut dropping people off I think and On the radio the game continued.

324
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,704
Scott: Oh, you're losing.

325
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:58,810
Scott: by the way when we left Continued and somehow the Mets miraculously came back in one and like the was extra innings.

326
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:04,357
Scott: I need to remember this was 19 late 90s Maybe 898 or 99 something like that.

327
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,708
Scott: if anyone can figure out exactly which game this was props to you.

328
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:16,188
Rym: great this is the thing of based on the the number of runs that a team is up by and What inning it is?

329
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,289
Rym: What is the confidence interval where you can leave and know the outcome of the game?

330
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:27,795
Scott: Like what are the odds that the team's gonna make an app where you tell it what game you're at and it tell it goes Ding time to go home.

331
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:34,830
Rym: This is so simple that you could do the rule yourself And if someone's up by six just leave after the first inning, maybe I will make that app.

332
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:36,899
Scott: Yeah, you put in what game you're at.

333
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,888
Scott: The problem is getting the stupid sports data.

334
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:39,912
Scott: That's yeah That's every.

335
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:44,730
Scott: I have all these great ideas for sports apps and I don't have access to just the basic sports data.

336
00:22:44,793 --> 00:22:56,086
Scott: Hey I've looked into getting it and basically the only places that offer sports data are Offering it for fantasy sports and they charge a fortune because that is a Incredibly granular amount of data about all these players.

337
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:59,081
Scott: It's like no I just want to know the scores of all the games in real time.

338
00:22:59,101 --> 00:22:59,443
Scott: That's it.

339
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:00,789
Scott: So not even real time.

340
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:02,795
Rym: So read this article.

341
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:06,270
Rym: I'm not gonna explain you the details, but it's really good and like this graph.

342
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,836
Rym: Yeah, that they show is excellent.

343
00:23:07,957 --> 00:23:08,800
Scott: The other incident.

344
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:14,099
Scott: We were at New England Patriots game against the Saints and The Saints made a big interception.

345
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,830
Scott: There was like no time left in this game and the Saints were ahead.

346
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:22,015
Scott: So as soon as he caught that interception we got up and we walked to the parking lot Got in the car.

347
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:27,997
Scott: We're in the parking lot waiting in a line of cars to get out Patriots fans, right?

348
00:23:28,037 --> 00:23:40,549
Scott: So all the Patriots fans had left this game also right before us even and suddenly we're just sitting in the car and People outside the car walking around start like getting crazy hootin and hollerin hootin and hollerin.

349
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:50,869
Scott: So like you do whenever you leave a sporting event in a car you turn on the sports radio And sure enough Tom Brady had miraculously come back to win that game.

350
00:23:53,152 --> 00:23:55,570
Scott: So those are the two times you left early and it was a mistake.

351
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:58,841
Scott: We left early many other times and those times were not mistakes.

352
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,430
Rym: So now there's a data model at least for baseball.

353
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:03,441
Rym: I'd love to see this for other sports.

354
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:04,266
Rym: It's 538.

355
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:04,990
Rym: So maybe they'll do it.

356
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:06,290
Scott: I really want the date.

357
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,183
Scott: I really want access to data so I can make an app that tells you when to leave.

358
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:14,744
Rym: but I would Love to see a similar analysis for board games.

359
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:16,370
Scott: Oh, yeah, when do you quit the board games?

360
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,536
Rym: Yeah, at what point should you just flip the table?

361
00:24:18,596 --> 00:24:20,884
Rym: Cuz the game is all my homo Shindeiru.

362
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:21,265
Scott: Yep.

363
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,510
Scott: Oh I mean, oh my thing of the day that's better than you.

364
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,970
Rym: So what I'll say to prelude Scott's thing of the day is I clicked on it.

365
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,899
Rym: It's in French doesn't really tell me the deal.

366
00:24:29,939 --> 00:24:31,326
Scott: I think it's might be Italian.

367
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:31,808
Scott: I don't even know.

368
00:24:32,812 --> 00:24:33,795
Rym: This looks like French.

369
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:34,838
Scott: I have no idea.

370
00:24:34,858 --> 00:24:36,201
Scott: It doesn't even matter.

371
00:24:36,282 --> 00:24:43,947
Rym: It takes three seconds to know how great this Maybe is French because you click play and three seconds later, you know exactly how.

372
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:44,610
Rym: why this is so.

373
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,660
Scott: Yeah, so I actually don't know any information about this.

374
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:51,936
Scott: is le jutes Provencalis Something?

375
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:53,210
Scott: I'm pronouncing all this wrong.

376
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,798
Scott: It must be in Cannes right?

377
00:24:54,818 --> 00:25:05,432
Scott: the place of the festival is the film festival But basically it's dudes on boats that look a lot like the boats They use in Venice only much bigger and it seems like the boats also have people on them Like.

378
00:25:05,452 --> 00:25:06,463
Scott: I don't know what they're doing.

379
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:07,010
Scott: Are they rowing?

380
00:25:07,815 --> 00:25:12,193
Scott: But these dudes are basically standing on the front of the boat Fucking jousting.

381
00:25:12,213 --> 00:25:13,557
Scott: This is so great.

382
00:25:13,577 --> 00:25:16,507
Scott: When you lose the joust you fucking fall in the dirty-ass water.

383
00:25:16,587 --> 00:25:17,510
Scott: How amazing is that?

384
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,392
Scott: This is incredible.

385
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:21,061
Scott: It the only is this even better than that.

386
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:22,264
Scott: Basically that bloodsport.

387
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:27,461
Scott: They have in Italy the violence football Yeah, that even caught I don't know but this is even better than that.

388
00:25:27,682 --> 00:25:28,966
Scott: This is like, holy shit.

389
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:30,050
Rym: This is real good.

390
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:37,115
Scott: I I would even actually try this because even though it seems like you get hurt and to be dangerous It's not that day, right?

391
00:25:37,155 --> 00:25:41,110
Scott: It's like you fall in the water and they have these big fat wooden boards on their chest.

392
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,618
Rym: I mean, I guess you might get hit in the face.

393
00:25:42,638 --> 00:25:43,241
Rym: So it's really.

394
00:25:43,362 --> 00:25:44,950
Scott: it's really just a game of pushing, right?

395
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:50,530
Scott: It's like push but you're on a boat and like the boat is also pushing so there's like a lot of balance going on.

396
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,957
Scott: This is looks like way fun and way awesome.

397
00:25:53,358 --> 00:25:54,140
Rym: Yeah, I would do.

398
00:25:54,481 --> 00:25:57,169
Rym: it's very telling to this video zero dislikes.

399
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:01,509
Scott: If you dislike this you are not a good person.

400
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:03,234
Scott: In the moment.

401
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:06,967
Rym: you may recall that the book club book was Emily Wilson's translation of Homer's.

402
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:07,850
Rym: Odyssey was great.

403
00:26:08,311 --> 00:26:09,134
Rym: We did the show.

404
00:26:09,515 --> 00:26:10,057
Rym: it's done.

405
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:12,124
Rym: You can listen to the book club episode.

406
00:26:12,726 --> 00:26:13,950
Scott: There's a GeekNights' book club.

407
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,561
Rym: Yeah, we've done a bunch of these books.

408
00:26:16,802 --> 00:26:18,710
Scott: if you're an intelligent human being you should read books.

409
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:20,559
Scott: Yeah, the paper kind if you can read.

410
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:24,637
Rym: Yep, the Braille kind if you can't see Yep, or the audiobook if you need to like.

411
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:25,219
Rym: there's reasons.

412
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,070
Scott: Yeah, and I respect the audiobook that much anyway.

413
00:26:29,591 --> 00:26:30,556
Scott: So I tried to happen.

414
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:33,370
Scott: it's my turn to pick a book club book and usually I just got a book in mind.

415
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:36,869
Scott: Right this time is a little harder because I didn't have one in mind.

416
00:26:37,451 --> 00:26:43,567
Scott: So at first since we had just done this Odyssey and since it had been talked about on the internet.

417
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:44,610
Rym: reason thinking about the idiot?

418
00:26:45,094 --> 00:26:46,769
Scott: No, I was thinking about.

419
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:50,822
Scott: So there's this book by.

420
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:55,939
Scott: I think it isn't xenophon the guy's name The old set you're talking about.

421
00:26:56,643 --> 00:26:57,970
Rym: I might have already read this right?

422
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,372
Scott: It's the.

423
00:26:58,412 --> 00:27:02,009
Scott: it's basically this journey of like from Persia to Turkey or so.

424
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,414
Rym: I've read a lot of that.

425
00:27:03,434 --> 00:27:10,484
Scott: we had to read it in high school and apparently one of these is the story that the was based on.

426
00:27:12,873 --> 00:27:16,688
Scott: So I was like, oh we should read that but there's no Emily Wilson translation of that.

427
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:16,909
Scott: No, no.

428
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:18,136
Scott: So then I said wait a minute.

429
00:27:18,156 --> 00:27:18,619
Scott: Wait a minute.

430
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:23,194
Scott: Why don't we just read no Warriors Cuz that's a book.

431
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:24,379
Rym: I've never read that boy.

432
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,283
Scott: I've never read it either.

433
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:26,910
Scott: and I'm saying the movie like ten times.

434
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:27,975
Scott: Yeah, I might read it.

435
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:34,964
Scott: But then I got an even better idea than that because This evolving well, cuz I don't know if I don't really know.

436
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:37,097
Scott: if the Warriors is a good book I don't know.

437
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:40,315
Scott: I just know that there's a Cult classic movie based on.

438
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:43,547
Rym: I like aspects of the movie, but the movie is actually super long.

439
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:44,330
Rym: Not that much happens.

440
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,078
Rym: It's not that good what I like the movie.

441
00:27:46,238 --> 00:27:47,082
Scott: It's not that long.

442
00:27:47,122 --> 00:27:48,830
Scott: It's kind of pretty sure why it's very.

443
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:53,015
Scott: I think I like the movie more than it deserves because it's very New York Yeah, but it's got.

444
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:57,510
Rym: it's deeply flawed and not that enjoyable except for a very specific key moments.

445
00:27:57,792 --> 00:27:59,482
Rym: It's also got some problematic shit.

446
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:02,177
Scott: Well, it's an old 70s movie.

447
00:28:02,238 --> 00:28:02,660
Scott: Yeah.

448
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:04,449
Rym: Anyway, I think it's right for a remake.

449
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:07,178
Scott: Hasn't it been a good remake?

450
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:07,720
Scott: I don't know.

451
00:28:08,102 --> 00:28:09,970
Scott: Anyway, the point it already is a remake.

452
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:23,800
Rym: It's a remake of something that's a robo cops getting a sequel from the original Robocop as in they're canceling Robocop 2 & 3 every for every Robocop since the first Robocop movie is Dropped and this is a direct sequel to the original Robocop.

453
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,824
Rym: The rest of its not canon.

454
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:25,185
Rym: Fuck it.

455
00:28:25,526 --> 00:28:26,710
Scott: I'll take that Frank Miller.

456
00:28:29,051 --> 00:28:30,636
Scott: So then I had an even better idea.

457
00:28:30,656 --> 00:28:33,524
Scott: I was like well thinking about books based on movies, right?

458
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:36,974
Scott: Yeah this Sunday actually It's it's you know this Sunday.

459
00:28:37,034 --> 00:28:39,381
Scott: I'm going but actually I think it started playing already.

460
00:28:40,043 --> 00:28:52,861
Scott: There is a a on Remaster basically of a very very famous and excellent movie in 70 millimeter Screening at the Museum the moving image, right?

461
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,050
Scott: I think it started already, but I'm going to see it on Sunday.

462
00:28:55,351 --> 00:29:04,577
Scott: Oh and that movie is also based on a book that I haven't read and is definitely a good book because it's ultra famous And I don't know I haven't read it.

463
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:08,883
Scott: So the book club book is 2001 a Space Odyssey.

464
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,039
Scott: Alright, that's a good pick.

465
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,744
Scott: Have you ever read it?

466
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:12,669
Rym: I've never read it, right?

467
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:17,370
Scott: So yeah, I don't know if it's good, but you have all stayed your execution.

468
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:19,084
Rym: This is a good enough book to where I am.

469
00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:22,299
Rym: Once again Deferring my selection of some Dumas.

470
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,504
Scott: It's ultra famous.

471
00:29:23,786 --> 00:29:24,670
Scott: It's a sci-fi book.

472
00:29:24,992 --> 00:29:27,529
Scott: It's got like one of the best movies ever is based on it.

473
00:29:28,112 --> 00:29:29,337
Scott: I might as well see what the deal is.

474
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:31,667
Scott: Is it as fucked up as the movie is how 9,000 even in it?

475
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,716
Scott: I don't even know.

476
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:34,339
Rym: I've never read it.

477
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,605
Scott: I've literally don't know anything about.

478
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:36,490
Scott: I feel like as a nerd.

479
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:37,398
Scott: I probably should right.

480
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:43,465
Scott: Yeah, and you know I wonder if the same thing will happen cuz it ain't even long there.

481
00:29:43,706 --> 00:29:44,087
Scott: It's not.

482
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:46,365
Rym: it's like 200 and something pages.

483
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:49,318
Scott: This will be quick Yeah, but you know something interesting has happened.

484
00:29:49,358 --> 00:29:52,910
Scott: my lat my previous book club bit books that were in series.

485
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:57,290
Rym: So we're real of time and I have gone on to read the entirety of all of them.

486
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,354
Scott: And what was the other one?

487
00:29:58,394 --> 00:30:00,623
Scott: the other shattered or in cage MSA?

488
00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:01,365
Scott: Yeah, right.

489
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:02,590
Rym: that is so freakin good.

490
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,880
Rym: So you need to read the rest of it.

491
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:04,223
Scott: I will.

492
00:30:04,566 --> 00:30:06,517
Rym: it's basically Evangelion culture.

493
00:30:06,537 --> 00:30:08,488
Scott: I know I will but you know I did.

494
00:30:08,588 --> 00:30:11,998
Scott: Rym Immediately reads the whole series and I make the first volume.

495
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:16,270
Scott: So will Rym go on to read about Europa immediately after?

496
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:20,737
Scott: Go on to 2010 right as soon as.

497
00:30:20,797 --> 00:30:25,150
Rym: even if I know one thing about Europa, I know that I should attempt no landing there.

498
00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:34,805
Rym: So, yeah, otherwise If you are going to be at PAX West we're doing at least one panel.

499
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:37,650
Rym: our panel is on Monday.

500
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:40,539
Scott: so yeah, we got a Monday first thing.

501
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:47,224
Scott: as soon as packs opens panel, which is not a great time slot and Whatever, but it's in the live streaming thing.

502
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:55,682
Scott: for the first time ever They have put us in a theater which will stream live on a official PAX twitch channel Probably twitch like PAX 3 or something.

503
00:30:55,702 --> 00:30:55,863
Scott: because.

504
00:30:55,883 --> 00:31:02,190
Rym: so if you're at PAX I've never said this before and I'll never say it again because the reality is we video most of our panels.

505
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:04,869
Rym: But if you're at PAX, you should go to this.

506
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:09,270
Rym: So we have a loud crowd in the background for the live stream.

507
00:31:09,651 --> 00:31:10,154
Rym: We don't.

508
00:31:10,174 --> 00:31:14,130
Scott: but if you're nothing to be funnier if there was no crowd and I could play it up to the crowd.

509
00:31:14,512 --> 00:31:18,570
Scott: And yet and the people who are why I think the few people watching on twitch should be like what the hell?

510
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,455
Scott: They'd see me.

511
00:31:20,475 --> 00:31:22,570
Scott: be it all, you know, do my panel to nobody.

512
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:26,349
Rym: But we're gonna live stream.

513
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:31,667
Rym: So if you've never been able to see us live out of packs, you can pretend you're there.

514
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:33,715
Rym: Mm-hmm It's gonna be glorious.

515
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:36,850
Scott: You can also watch those packs channels to see everything else at PAX.

516
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:41,787
Rym: Yeah, at least everything that's in the albatross theater the Hydra theater or main events.

517
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:46,509
Scott: Yeah So we'll either be PAX 2 or PAX 3 as soon as you make it on family along with us.

518
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:49,394
Scott: Yeah in slight you'll be slightly delayed But you won't know that.

519
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:50,097
Scott: and you know what.

520
00:31:50,137 --> 00:31:52,790
Rym: frankly the last few when I got that finales haven't been that great.

521
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:55,890
Scott: So no, but I'll see what else you gonna do on Monday.

522
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,506
Rym: Yeah, boy, you can play one more board game Monday at five o'clock.

523
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:00,490
Scott: You gonna go to Benaroya.

524
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:01,115
Scott: What you gonna do?

525
00:32:01,215 --> 00:32:02,887
Rym: I mean the table tops open till seven.

526
00:32:03,831 --> 00:32:05,860
Scott: No, well, we can go there right after and then go to dinner.

527
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,130
Rym: Yeah, maybe we should anyway.

528
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:09,933
Rym: So, let's see.

529
00:32:09,973 --> 00:32:11,839
Rym: We were talking about Ruby likes.

530
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:15,450
Scott: Yeah, so we haven't played a new game recently.

531
00:32:15,712 --> 00:32:17,709
Scott: So let's just pick a category of game.

532
00:32:18,112 --> 00:32:20,367
Rym: I played some new games that we just Scott hasn't played.

533
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:22,034
Scott: Scott is not Played.

534
00:32:22,054 --> 00:32:25,245
Scott: if you played Sanrio P cross that just came out for three.

535
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:26,650
Rym: Yeah, I know the deal with P cross.

536
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:28,815
Scott: It's a Sanrio P cross.

537
00:32:28,835 --> 00:32:29,297
Scott: It's very cute.

538
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,710
Scott: Yeah, the first item was a was a was a ribbon.

539
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:33,572
Scott: It's how I.

540
00:32:33,592 --> 00:32:36,842
Rym: uh, I know this is a slightly controversial opinion among our fans, but I am.

541
00:32:37,764 --> 00:32:42,109
Rym: I do not respect P cross It's just better Sudoku.

542
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:46,280
Rym: Yeah, you're not selling me Good it doesn't.

543
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,601
Rym: So rogue the original game.

544
00:32:50,641 --> 00:33:00,310
Scott: the reason I don't know if anyone doesn't know this But just in case there was a game way back in the day Probably older than most of the listeners called rogue same as the rogue is the D&D class.

545
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:05,327
Rym: So the genre roguelike literally means games that are like this one old be like it.

546
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:07,900
Scott: instead of calling games Platformers we call them Mario likes.

547
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:09,449
Scott: that's what this is, right?

548
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:12,677
Scott: So What qualifies something as a rogue like?

549
00:33:12,717 --> 00:33:17,070
Scott: what was it about rogue that was different than other games really - it's really just two things.

550
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:18,735
Rym: well I'm sure it's interesting you bring that up.

551
00:33:18,816 --> 00:33:25,879
Rym: as to the the Scotsman argument about roguelikes because there is a Concept that I've been annoyed with for a long time.

552
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:31,013
Rym: I'd look at Wikipedia to figure out the name of it the Berlin Interpretation whatever.

553
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:34,366
Scott: There's really only two concepts that make something a rogue like only two.

554
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:35,490
Rym: There's like eight listed here.

555
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,182
Scott: Whatever the only two that I believe in are number one.

556
00:33:39,544 --> 00:33:40,326
Scott: The game is different.

557
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:49,830
Scott: every time you play this Sort of procedurally generated map some sort of you know something that mixes things up every time is fresh, right?

558
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:55,237
Scott: So imagine if you played Mario, but every time it wasn't just the same world 1-1. every time It's like completely new level.

559
00:33:55,277 --> 00:33:58,152
Scott: every time that's item 1 and 2.

560
00:33:58,152 --> 00:33:58,493
Scott: Is that the?

561
00:33:58,574 --> 00:34:01,870
Scott: when you play the game you start at the beginning and you play until you die?

562
00:34:02,412 --> 00:34:04,439
Scott: And then that's gg game over.

563
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:09,929
Scott: you have to start again from the beginning with a new game with the new map with a new World and that's what makes the game a real good.

564
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,036
Scott: Yeah, now what else?

565
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:12,788
Scott: what other six things do they think you need?

566
00:34:12,828 --> 00:34:13,130
Scott: so first?

567
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:30,637
Rym: I would say that that's a good modern distilled definition Mm-hmm partly because there's a lot of like games that do these things that definitely feel like they're in the genre That don't do a lot of the other things most of the people who have more profound Definitions or more specific definitions are really.

568
00:34:30,717 --> 00:34:37,695
Rym: I'm married to the idea that rogue is the one true roguelike and every other game is just an interpretation of this one Specific experience.

569
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:38,578
Scott: what what else?

570
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:39,581
Scott: what I think has to be.

571
00:34:39,601 --> 00:34:53,726
Rym: but I think the two things you brought up What they really mean is that the game is an emergent narrative experience every time you play it Mm-hmm and that it's the journey is the goal as opposed to winning and all like the that's.

572
00:34:53,786 --> 00:34:55,270
Scott: but you can't usually can't win.

573
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:58,424
Scott: I guess net hack you can get to the whatever level there are definitely like.

574
00:34:58,444 --> 00:34:58,946
Rym: you can win.

575
00:34:58,987 --> 00:35:01,390
Scott: like dragon crystal I guess yeah, you can win a lot of them.

576
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,284
Scott: But like even if you win one, it's like if you beat Mario one.

577
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:06,770
Scott: how much value isn't there playing it again?

578
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,553
Scott: Not much, right?

579
00:35:07,653 --> 00:35:11,850
Scott: Yeah, but roguelikes like you I've beaten slay the spires a million times and I keep playing it.

580
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,210
Rym: Well, I dragon crystal which I never beat as a kid.

581
00:35:14,451 --> 00:35:24,037
Rym: I didn't even know you could beat it until game facts existed, but because this game came out in like 1990 1991 on the Game Gear But it was a pro like.

582
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:30,680
Rym: this game is very rogue, but I never even heard of it before today, by the way It's procedurally generated, but eventually it runs out of steam.

583
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,385
Scott: Usually when Rym talks about Game Gear games.

584
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:33,750
Scott: He talks about a gem fire.

585
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,777
Rym: Gemfire is not a game of your game.

586
00:35:36,018 --> 00:35:38,430
Scott: I thought what was the one you can talk crystal warriors.

587
00:35:39,561 --> 00:35:41,966
Scott: I get confused cuz one's gem and one's crystal.

588
00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:42,426
Scott: You come on.

589
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:44,390
Rym: There's dragon crystal and crystal warriors.

590
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:50,109
Rym: Come on, those are the two Game Gear games I talk about Dot star crystal dot star.

591
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:58,375
Scott: So Rym by all you had to do if you wanted to sell a little kid Rym a game was put the word dragon Crystal or gem on the cover.

592
00:35:58,535 --> 00:36:00,721
Rym: So fun fact, this is actually a total aside.

593
00:36:00,982 --> 00:36:02,927
Rym: when I was a little kid crystalis.

594
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:07,229
Rym: Uh-huh Yeah crystalis or crystalis as most kids.

595
00:36:07,911 --> 00:36:09,094
Scott: Anyway, I didn't know better then.

596
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:24,069
Rym: so I had dragon crystal and crystal warriors the Game Gear and I went to the public library My family and one day in the science fiction section because there was no fantasy section I saw a novel that was called crystal warriors.

597
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:30,463
Rym: Were all these sword dudes and sword ladies decked out in crystals?

598
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:33,230
Rym: it looked very much like crystal warriors.

599
00:36:33,998 --> 00:36:35,068
Rym: So I got this book.

600
00:36:36,472 --> 00:36:44,825
Rym: This book was basically an erotic like thriller Bullshit garbage novel that to this day haunts me.

601
00:36:45,005 --> 00:36:46,450
Scott: I mean just go to any used bookstore.

602
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,650
Rym: You'll find that I learned I learned things about the human body reading this book.

603
00:36:55,114 --> 00:36:56,898
Scott: I hope you consulted an anatomy.

604
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,307
Rym: I learned a lot about crystals and heterochromia.

605
00:37:00,748 --> 00:37:03,056
Rym: and this fucking book I'll make tell you what.

606
00:37:03,277 --> 00:37:06,390
Rym: if you ever pick a bag book club book, that's what I'm bringing back.

607
00:37:06,431 --> 00:37:12,376
Scott: I'm gonna read that book again Have to read it yourself again.

608
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,863
Rym: Yeah, I remember every goddamn detail of that book.

609
00:37:15,003 --> 00:37:16,447
Rym: you want to talk about the hot brothers.

610
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:25,242
Rym: anyway When the game they they were enemies, but then they became friends sort of.

611
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:30,314
Rym: but then they kiss anyway, so brothers it's incest It's complicated.

612
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,280
Rym: Okay, it's it's.

613
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,390
Rym: it gets into some of that technically anime territory.

614
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,710
Rym: so Game gear doesn't have a lot of memory.

615
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:44,830
Rym: So dragon crystal runs out of steam and eventually it runs out of colors to use for palette swaps for all the enemies.

616
00:37:45,477 --> 00:37:49,963
Rym: So in the very end of the game there's just this trophy in a room in the last level.

617
00:37:49,983 --> 00:37:54,269
Rym: if you step on the trophy and Literally, it's just like yep you won.

618
00:37:54,491 --> 00:37:55,257
Scott: Congratulation.

619
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,115
Rym: Yep, you get to go back home Because I guess you were a kid.

620
00:37:59,135 --> 00:38:00,340
Rym: you got trapped in this fantasy world.

621
00:38:00,762 --> 00:38:12,528
Rym: So the Berlin Protocol The interpretation of something that happened after World War two from the international roguelike development conference in 2008 That was held in Berlin.

622
00:38:14,314 --> 00:38:15,969
Rym: Some people care way too much about this.

623
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,297
Scott: If anyone I'd be very very surprised.

624
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:23,413
Scott: if there's any attendee who is below the age of 40 and did not have a beard That was good.

625
00:38:23,513 --> 00:38:25,946
Rym: Oh, this is a eunuch Santa Convention to be.

626
00:38:26,147 --> 00:38:31,802
Rym: to be clear They based this set of high-value and low-value factors.

627
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:35,450
Rym: for what - what is a roguelike based on the five?

628
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,637
Rym: canonical roguelike games Net have rogue.

629
00:38:39,658 --> 00:38:43,034
Scott: Yeah, net hack net heck Lindley's dungeon crawl.

630
00:38:43,074 --> 00:38:43,576
Scott: never heard of it.

631
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:44,679
Rym: ang band.

632
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,461
Scott: I've heard of that.

633
00:38:45,722 --> 00:38:47,647
Scott: and Adam ad om never heard of.

634
00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:48,610
Rym: I've heard of Adam.

635
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:49,313
Scott: I've heard.

636
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,278
Scott: I think it's an acronym.

637
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:52,206
Scott: I'm pretty sure ang band was a mud though.

638
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:52,990
Scott: I guess I must be wrong.

639
00:38:53,712 --> 00:38:58,824
Rym: Yep, so anyway, the idea is to determine how roguelike a roguelike is.

640
00:38:58,844 --> 00:39:02,032
Scott: I mean, those are all like ASCII text games I'm pretty sure.

641
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:07,344
Rym: Yeah, so one the game uses random dungeon generation increased replayability.

642
00:39:07,384 --> 00:39:07,745
Rym: Yeah.

643
00:39:07,785 --> 00:39:09,469
Rym: Yeah, cool - permadeath.

644
00:39:09,871 --> 00:39:11,645
Scott: Yeah, which true use of the two things?

645
00:39:11,706 --> 00:39:18,930
Rym: I said, yeah Three turn-based as in not real time if you stop doing things the game stops doing.

646
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,463
Scott: I don't believe in that because rogue legacy is clearly a roguelike.

647
00:39:22,623 --> 00:39:25,072
Scott: true is rogue in the name and it is a Platforming game.

648
00:39:25,192 --> 00:39:31,230
Rym: so one could argue that that means that rogue legacy is a roguelike that evolved a core characteristic of the original cannons.

649
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:37,530
Rym: The game is non-modal in that every action is available to the player regardless of where they are in the game.

650
00:39:42,192 --> 00:39:47,437
Scott: I think that's because like you think of a game like net hack and there's so many things you can do in that hack you Can do that at any time.

651
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:55,131
Scott: Like a net hack does like this huge list of actions right that you get just from the start and the whole game being good At.

652
00:39:55,171 --> 00:39:58,395
Scott: net hack is basically knowing about all those actions But it already knows the hang.

653
00:39:58,415 --> 00:40:02,310
Rym: then breaks this because of their shops or you can buy special things later in the game, right?

654
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:07,469
Scott: But yeah, I don't believe in that either because you know, even rogues are RPGs, right?

655
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:18,771
Scott: Yeah, even net hack which has this huge list of actions you can do you can't just like Fireball and net hack for the beginning you have to get a fireball spell or wanders scroll or whatever it is or learn fireball Right.

656
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:30,854
Scott: So now even that violates its own idea and because an RPG in an RPG At least not the kind of RPG you play tabletop storytelling RPG the JRPG kind, you know The the Ultima kind.

657
00:40:31,175 --> 00:40:35,190
Scott: you let have a character that levels up and gains abilities and when you gain abilities you gain new actions.

658
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:42,870
Rym: So I'm gonna read the whole sentence for this next one because this one's actually a pretty interesting Though grog Nardin statement, you'll hear the grog Nardin coming out of this.

659
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:51,639
Rym: Okay The game has a degree of complexity due to the number of different game systems in place that allow the player to complete certain goals In multiple ways creating emergent gameplay.

660
00:40:52,402 --> 00:40:54,230
Rym: I mean Apple to get through a locked door.

661
00:40:54,691 --> 00:40:59,689
Rym: You may attempt to pick the lock kick the door down burn the door down dig under the door.

662
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:08,454
Scott: I mean, I sort of agree with that and that if you have a game where you're procedurally generating a map and you want to Replayability you need to

663
00:41:08,494 --> 00:41:12,188
Rym: have a lot of systems that can interact and just let them play out the way they do

664
00:41:12,248 --> 00:41:14,597
Scott: right and you Have a lot of this variance, right?

665
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:16,644
Rym: They actually give a really good example.

666
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:24,070
Scott: This is sort of you know, having Multiple, you know systems that interact in this way is sort of necessary in order to make the read.

667
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,134
Scott: Otherwise you would just be.

668
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:27,664
Scott: it might be a roguelike, but it'd be a really crappy boring.

669
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:29,030
Scott: Yeah, I wouldn't want to replay it again.

670
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:30,025
Rym: Well, it's made makes it.

671
00:41:30,045 --> 00:41:31,556
Rym: this is more This is the door fortress thing.

672
00:41:31,616 --> 00:41:44,490
Scott: even slay the spire works this way where it's like you're fighting the same bad guys But you already have three different classes, you know different cards different figure out different ways to beat the bad guys You know, so even slay the spire the deck builder has this right?

673
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:53,085
Scott: So of course, you know, but I mean you could really instead of having that huge sentence You could really just say needs to be complex enough to make real play worth it.

674
00:41:53,185 --> 00:41:56,523
Rym: They do give a really good example, though I feel like I'll use this in a panel in the future.

675
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:57,530
Scott: Not the door example.

676
00:41:57,831 --> 00:42:10,249
Rym: Uh, so, let's see the dev team thinks of everything blah blah blah blah Such as using gloves to protect your character while wielding the corpse of a cockatrice as a weapon that as a result petrifies any enemy that it touches.

677
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:14,899
Scott: Yeah, I mean like that kind of fortress kind gets that complicated.

678
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:19,270
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, the player must use resource as a cockatrice.

679
00:42:20,592 --> 00:42:23,205
Scott: I've always said cockatrice always said cockatrice and I don't know what's right.

680
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:29,467
Scott: No Bunga At least we both agree on the cocka.

681
00:42:30,212 --> 00:42:30,352
Rym: The.

682
00:42:30,493 --> 00:42:31,998
Rym: uh, I think the height of this is.

683
00:42:32,118 --> 00:42:34,106
Rym: I knew a kid who called the game the NES game.

684
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:34,366
Rym: Dr.

685
00:42:34,407 --> 00:42:34,808
Rym: Chaos.

686
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:36,997
Scott: Dr Chaios, I want to.

687
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,363
Scott: I've been thinking about dr.

688
00:42:38,403 --> 00:42:39,548
Scott: Chaos actually lately.

689
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:43,864
Rym: Dr Chaos has come up a couple times in my life recently like in the last year.

690
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:46,997
Scott: Let's do a stream of dr Chaos because I know a lot of stuff about it.

691
00:42:47,418 --> 00:42:50,453
Scott: Oh, and then let's maybe do a GeekNights episode about dr Chaos.

692
00:42:50,473 --> 00:42:51,563
Scott: cuz no one knows what we should do.

693
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:54,990
Rym: We'll sit on your couch We'll just do like you play the game and we'll just talk about it.

694
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,666
Scott: Well, no one knows about this game besides me and the kid I borrowed it from.

695
00:42:57,988 --> 00:43:00,723
Rym: Yep I too borrowed it from a kid.

696
00:43:00,763 --> 00:43:01,064
Scott: I couldn't.

697
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,170
Scott: I never saw it at a store.

698
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,063
Scott: The only reason I knew it existed is because our friends had it and I borrowed it from them.

699
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:09,610
Rym: I borrowed it from the same fucking kid Who traded me Megaman 3 from a copy of hide lied?

700
00:43:11,011 --> 00:43:15,930
Rym: And then his mom came and made us trade back because apparently he was crying about it for a week.

701
00:43:16,211 --> 00:43:17,718
Scott: Highlight is garbage.

702
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:19,525
Rym: One of the worst NES games ever made.

703
00:43:19,626 --> 00:43:20,590
Scott: It looks like a roguelike.

704
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,823
Scott: I saw it in video game magazines or strategy guides when I was young.

705
00:43:23,944 --> 00:43:27,018
Rym: I bought it from Funkoland for $4 And they wouldn't buy it back from me.

706
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:30,530
Scott: It looked awesome in the skin in the books But I never saw it in any store.

707
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,795
Scott: I never knew anyone who had it.

708
00:43:31,815 --> 00:43:35,610
Scott: so I never played it and that was lucky because that means I never wasted money on it.

709
00:43:35,951 --> 00:43:43,935
Scott: And then when I was older, I got emulators in like 96 7 something like that and I was like, oh my god I got every NES game ever.

710
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,603
Scott: Let's play hide lied and I played.

711
00:43:45,643 --> 00:43:47,049
Scott: hide lied and it was fucking garbage.

712
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,810
Scott: Okay, so and not a roguelike but looks like a roguelike.

713
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,095
Rym: They argue that this I want to.

714
00:43:52,135 --> 00:43:53,561
Rym: actually I've seen in a lot of these games.

715
00:43:53,822 --> 00:44:03,130
Rym: There are there's multiple sets of Limited resources that you must manage to progress things like food or stamina not just hit points.

716
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:10,319
Scott: Um, I don't know if it's absolutely this is necessary But I think it does make a better roguelike.

717
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,930
Rym: well like even faster than light has fuel right exactly.

718
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,414
Scott: Oh, I think that what it is.

719
00:44:15,474 --> 00:44:27,289
Scott: Is that these other these other things they've listed this beyond the core two of permadeath and procedural generation is things that make a procedural generation permadeath game good, right.

720
00:44:28,072 --> 00:44:30,101
Scott: So it's like yeah, you can have a game with.

721
00:44:30,362 --> 00:44:32,350
Scott: proceed, you know, just the two that I mentioned.

722
00:44:32,692 --> 00:44:40,632
Scott: but if you don't have the multiple ways to solve or Resources that run out then it's not going to be very good Right,

723
00:44:40,932 --> 00:44:45,844
Rym: actually, so rich Carlson one of the creators of strange adventures like you need

724
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:55,188
Scott: those limited resources of some kind Be it time or money or food art provide the pressure to push you forward into that.

725
00:44:55,248 --> 00:44:59,624
Scott: permadeath Yeah is what makes you know, the procedural generator permadeath game good.

726
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:04,788
Rym: So rich Carlson called that the clock Some clock that forces the game to progress.

727
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:07,145
Rym: so Crystal had that.

728
00:45:07,226 --> 00:45:07,649
Scott: Oh, thank you.

729
00:45:08,493 --> 00:45:10,783
Scott: Yeah, I'll mention slay the spire again because it's the roguelike.

730
00:45:10,803 --> 00:45:11,927
Scott: I'm playing the most lately.

731
00:45:11,968 --> 00:45:12,490
Scott: It's real good.

732
00:45:12,731 --> 00:45:15,379
Scott: You can't refill your HP very easily at all.

733
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:19,050
Scott: Yeah, like you run at you you go into a fight you lose some HP.

734
00:45:19,191 --> 00:45:20,823
Scott: Good luck healing, right?

735
00:45:20,944 --> 00:45:21,770
Scott: It's like I don't die.

736
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:34,428
Rym: so, you know, it's even better about that is that the decisions and slay the spire because you eat whenever you whenever you can heal hit Points it almost always gives you something you're way more interested in doing as an option.

737
00:45:34,508 --> 00:45:39,110
Rym: instead It's always like yeah, you could get some hit points or I get this car.

738
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:42,230
Scott: It's like look cuz hip losing hit points doesn't met.

739
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:44,983
Scott: This is true for all games and people have a hard time understanding this.

740
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:51,199
Scott: I comes up in like every game I play comes up in netrunner It comes up in hearthstone comes up and slay the spire comes up in.

741
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:55,390
Scott: counter-strike is like hit points don't matter unless you're dead.

742
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:59,970
Scott: It doesn't matter if you have one hit point or a thousand hit points as long as you don't have zero.

743
00:46:00,371 --> 00:46:05,390
Scott: So if you have an ability that's like lose ten hit points do something fucking awesome.

744
00:46:06,034 --> 00:46:09,437
Scott: That is amazing as long as you don't die Right.

745
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:18,350
Scott: So like in hearthstone There's a warlock and the warlocks base ability is spend two mana lose two hit points draw a card and that is fucking incredible.

746
00:46:18,812 --> 00:46:20,277
Scott: No, it's just don't die.

747
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,562
Scott: It doesn't matter.

748
00:46:21,603 --> 00:46:26,039
Rym: You're you still win the game All right, so the so the other options here.

749
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:29,150
Rym: I know we'll just go over this quickly to get away from this Berlin thing.

750
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:48,284
Rym: Yeah, because the one thing that really stands out now that I'm looking at this Berlin thing in detail It reads I want to say like naive game design like people who like roguelikes Tried to define Basic ideas about game design, but they don't know about game design.

751
00:46:48,325 --> 00:46:49,350
Rym: They only know about roguelikes.

752
00:46:49,611 --> 00:47:00,590
Rym: So they describe these like over complicated things that a modern designer or Reviewer or someone who understands games with a narrow view exactly only know roguelike?

753
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,745
Scott: Yeah, kind of like how like training they're going to the roguelike convention.

754
00:47:03,785 --> 00:47:10,950
Rym: That's true true But like you see a lot of old board games will have like rules that are written similar with similar logic and phrasing.

755
00:47:11,452 --> 00:47:15,850
Rym: But games are hack and slash where the goal is to kill things and there's no peaceful options.

756
00:47:17,397 --> 00:47:32,790
Rym: And actually I like this one because Dragon Crystal did this to the their unidentified items The purpose of which must be discovered over the course of the game Like a bubbly potion like things that'll have description.

757
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:41,590
Scott: I mean, that's a fun mechanic, but that's not required to be a rogue at all And it's not well like Dragon Crystal did that in the sense that you'd pick up a red rod red sword.

758
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,830
Rym: There's a whole set of colors and there'd be books rods swords rings that all had the colors.

759
00:47:46,653 --> 00:47:50,289
Rym: You didn't know what red did and what red did was randomized every game.

760
00:47:51,213 --> 00:47:55,310
Rym: Once you used a red thing, then the game would translate red into the thing, right?

761
00:47:55,611 --> 00:48:01,570
Scott: It is a thing that does add to the replay value of a roguelike game, but it's that's definitely not necessary.

762
00:48:02,492 --> 00:48:05,750
Rym: Yeah, so forget these stupid semi-formal definition.

763
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,396
Scott: I think it's I think basically what all.

764
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:19,566
Scott: the only real mistake that they made with that list is that they listed things as required to be a roguelike when most of the things except for the two I mentioned at least in my belief are Things that are simply things that make a roguelike good.

765
00:48:19,706 --> 00:48:21,513
Scott: if you do them They listed them as.

766
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:26,468
Rym: how close to the original roguelikes or rogue are these games?

767
00:48:26,728 --> 00:48:26,809
Scott: Sure.

768
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:32,370
Rym: Okay Yeah, so I guess it's doing what it's supposed to do, which is it's not a necessarily a measure of a good game.

769
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:55,048
Rym: It's almost like it misses the point of why roguelike is a important and interesting genre because if like for example in faster than light if I could save state I Probably would and the game would be very different because I the decisions I was making would not have the kinds of consequences And the kinds of emergent storytelling that they have when I'm playing

770
00:48:55,088 --> 00:48:55,911
Scott: every time Yep,

771
00:48:56,172 --> 00:49:11,921
Rym: when I play FTL and I make a narrative choice and someone dies because of it It's actually really interesting to continue and roguelikes one of the only game genres where Continuing past failure is interesting or possible.

772
00:49:12,462 --> 00:49:17,334
Rym: Most games failure ends your run or Failure just sucks.

773
00:49:17,414 --> 00:49:19,841
Rym: Like if someone dies in fire emblem.

774
00:49:20,182 --> 00:49:21,005
Rym: that just sucks.

775
00:49:21,346 --> 00:49:22,850
Rym: No one's gonna keep playing, right?

776
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:28,921
Scott: Well, I mean if you die in a game that is not Procedurally generated and you the penalty is to go back.

777
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:30,666
Scott: You have to do the same thing.

778
00:49:30,707 --> 00:49:33,219
Scott: You just did again Mario you die.

779
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:34,749
Scott: It's like we'll do the same fucking thing again.

780
00:49:35,335 --> 00:49:36,609
Scott: It's like that's not fun.

781
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:41,150
Scott: But if you die in a roguelike, it sucks that you're not gonna see what's beyond there.

782
00:49:41,633 --> 00:49:43,730
Scott: But you don't have to do the same thing again.

783
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:47,282
Scott: You're basically constantly getting fresh gameplay.

784
00:49:47,664 --> 00:49:52,943
Scott: whether you're at the beginning or the end It's just always fresh all the time, which is what makes it so addicting.

785
00:49:52,963 --> 00:49:57,058
Scott: Just keep playing roguelike game Constantly without stopping right?

786
00:49:57,259 --> 00:50:04,448
Scott: That's how come I can play the slay the spire every day And even though I like Super Metroid and Megaman 2 better I play them once a year every two years.

787
00:50:06,132 --> 00:50:06,594
Scott: You know, there's.

788
00:50:06,634 --> 00:50:16,486
Rym: I think there's actually a more interesting point there about these in terms of When you play a game that's procedurally generated you have to explore in this manner and you build this narrative up.

789
00:50:16,506 --> 00:50:20,573
Rym: I still can't think of other games that Do.

790
00:50:20,654 --> 00:50:23,209
Rym: they can achieve this without having people write at all?

791
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:29,898
Rym: But you can have crazy things happen or game breaking things or unbalanced things Like you might like in slay the spire.

792
00:50:29,938 --> 00:50:31,083
Rym: Sometimes you get a combo.

793
00:50:31,384 --> 00:50:32,750
Rym: That's just on fucking beatable.

794
00:50:33,852 --> 00:50:37,870
Rym: In a normal game people would just use that combo every time now and the game is broken and dumb.

795
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:46,476
Rym: But in a roguelike because you're only gonna get that playthrough once if something's broken and a player encounters it That's just awesome.

796
00:50:46,536 --> 00:50:48,382
Scott: Well, I think that's the thing that happens in game.

797
00:50:48,522 --> 00:50:53,618
Scott: any game not just roguelikes that have both Complex enough systems and RNG.

798
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:55,423
Scott: right is that you get the.

799
00:50:55,644 --> 00:50:57,730
Scott: if you're playing I'll just keep stick with Mario.

800
00:50:58,072 --> 00:50:58,936
Scott: Right is like.

801
00:50:59,037 --> 00:51:00,102
Scott: what can you do in Mario?

802
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:01,892
Scott: You can post a better speedrun You can.

803
00:51:01,912 --> 00:51:04,846
Scott: you know, it's like, you know, there's only so much you can show right?

804
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:15,310
Scott: But with if you're playing roguelikes or any game with RNG and complex systems You're gonna have things happen in your games that no one else has ever encountered.

805
00:51:15,491 --> 00:51:23,795
Scott: Yeah, and you can suddenly have like a nice community online where everyone posts screenshots of oh my god Check out the crazy thing that happened Right.

806
00:51:23,815 --> 00:51:25,622
Scott: Look at this and people, you know, like look at my.

807
00:51:25,904 --> 00:51:27,957
Scott: look at my run and from slay the spire Look at this deck.

808
00:51:27,977 --> 00:51:34,250
Scott: I had holy shit Like 20 of that ultra powerful card in his deck and a managed to eliminate all the weak cards.

809
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:39,330
Scott: Yeah, but it doesn't end up being like posted like a gift the other day of like playing Thunderstruck.

810
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:41,966
Scott: But they had echo form so it cast Thunderstruck twice.

811
00:51:41,986 --> 00:51:46,161
Scott: Yeah Thunderstruck did like a bajillion damage and it was great.

812
00:51:46,321 --> 00:51:46,743
Scott: Awesome.

813
00:51:46,763 --> 00:51:50,337
Scott: It's like I've had close to that happen But not that exact thing.

814
00:51:50,397 --> 00:51:51,745
Scott: It'd be like beat the final boss.

815
00:51:51,765 --> 00:51:52,650
Scott: We're playing one card.

816
00:51:53,552 --> 00:52:00,050
Rym: Other genres of games can't pull that off because unbalanced broken experiences are just detrimental to the experience, right?

817
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:06,030
Rym: But with a roguelike they are literally the reason a lot of people play because people will tell those stories.

818
00:52:06,241 --> 00:52:14,417
Scott: Yeah You can't having outliers of crazy weak or crazy strong outcomes in a game That doesn't you know.

819
00:52:14,457 --> 00:52:17,249
Scott: have this sort of permadeath thing going on?

820
00:52:17,491 --> 00:52:27,749
Scott: Yeah is real bad because those extreme outliers will become the norm Right, and so people are using degenerate strategies constantly like if it's Street Fighter There's a frame perfect input that makes you invincible.

821
00:52:28,051 --> 00:52:31,770
Rym: Guess what literally everyone in the tournament scene has framed perfect input.

822
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:36,230
Scott: But if you have permadeath and procedural generation then suddenly it's okay.

823
00:52:36,391 --> 00:52:47,330
Scott: If occasionally a run has some crazy weak or crazy strong Outcomes where it's the player gets to do is too weak to even get past level one just got bad luck.

824
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:48,876
Scott: They just start again big deal.

825
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:55,630
Scott: or they get so lucky and just get the perfect Stars alignment that they can beat the final boss with one card.

826
00:52:56,212 --> 00:52:59,786
Scott: It's totally awesome because then it even after they beat the final boss.

827
00:52:59,806 --> 00:53:00,910
Scott: Guess what you're back to square one.

828
00:53:01,071 --> 00:53:02,939
Scott: It's not like you can keep that and use it forever.

829
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:07,997
Rym: Yep, and as a result also gives you That LS Metroid about cuz.

830
00:53:08,017 --> 00:53:08,520
Rym: I'm really hungry.

831
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,224
Rym: I might as well just stop.

832
00:53:09,244 --> 00:53:09,988
Rym: we've gone on for now.

833
00:53:10,459 --> 00:53:17,520
