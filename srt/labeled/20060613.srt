1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,133
Rym: It's Tuesday June 13th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:14,980
Rym: We reminisce about counter-strike.

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,670
Rym: Let's do this today in white Plains.

4
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,550
Rym: I discovered an abomination unto man Really?

5
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:28,491
Rym: I wanted to go to a mall down there and I drove and I parked far away because I was doing some other stuff.

6
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:32,299
Rym: and then I walked over to the mall and I Realized that I didn't see the entrance.

7
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:40,290
Rym: So I started walking around the mall and I walked all the way around it twice and then it came to me that no Long walk to walk around a mall twice.

8
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:40,974
Rym: Yeah, it was.

9
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:47,302
Rym: I had some free time But it turns out that there is absolutely no pedestrian entrance to this mall Whatsoever.

10
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:51,460
Scott: Oh, is there like a giant cement concrete wall surrounding the whole thing?

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,141
Rym: No, it was.

12
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:54,528
Rym: just imagine a mall with no exits.

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,400
Scott: I mean so to the building itself or to the parking lots around it.

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,624
Rym: There's no parking lots around it.

15
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:01,030
Rym: There's a big parking garage in it.

16
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,820
Scott: Okay, and you couldn't walk into that parking garage?

17
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:05,259
Rym: No, there's only four cars.

18
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:10,929
Scott: So the only way to get into this mall would be to park in the parking garage Yes, and then walk into the mall.

19
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:17,593
Rym: there were lots of emergency exits But they were very formidable and industrial looking and there were absolutely no ways in.

20
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:19,639
Scott: also so into the building itself.

21
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:22,170
Rym: you mean Into them if there's no way in anywhere.

22
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:24,582
Rym: I think it's a pretty simple concept Huh?

23
00:01:24,863 --> 00:01:26,289
Rym: There was no way in unless you drove.

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,179
Scott: so it's a building sitting in the middle of what a field.

25
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:36,380
Rym: No, it's in white plain surrounded by hundreds of other buildings, okay, so it's bordered by roads and a parking garage.

26
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,524
Rym: Well, the parking garage is in it.

27
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:41,015
Scott: Okay, as I said and the only door to get in.

28
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:45,710
Rym: Well, there's no doors There's just elevators in the parking garage that go to the mall parts.

29
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:48,358
Scott: Oh, it's one of those now.

30
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:48,819
Scott: I get it.

31
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,118
Scott: I've seen those before.

32
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:54,514
Scott: Okay, the way you're describing I thought maybe it was like like why?

33
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:56,220
Rym: what could you possibly be imagining?

34
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:58,449
Rym: This is like when you thought up was away from the Sun.

35
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:02,624
Scott: well because and I think about a mall a mall is a you Know is is separated.

36
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:05,291
Scott: It has a big field of parking lots all around.

37
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:06,755
Rym: what a lot of malls don't.

38
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:08,539
Scott: this isn't some mega mall.

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,392
Scott: This is you know, this is a building in the middle of a city.

40
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:12,176
Rym: Well, no, it's.

41
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,140
Rym: oh, it's a mega mall.

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,426
Rym: It's absolutely huge.

43
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:19,380
Rym: Yeah, but it's not in fact, it's bigger than the mall in Rochester I think in terms of the amount of space in it.

44
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:25,934
Scott: Well, the ball in Rochester is tiny but the you know It doesn't have the same structure as the the usual mall.

45
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:31,151
Rym: whatever you seem to have trouble with Imagining architecture as we learned in that D&D.

46
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:31,795
Scott: It's not like.

47
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:32,720
Scott: you described it very well.

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,440
Scott: You said it as a mall with no entrances, which it was a descriptive because that's all that.

49
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:39,007
Rym: That's the operative part of the story.

50
00:02:39,027 --> 00:02:40,252
Rym: It was a mall with no entrances.

51
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:41,497
Rym: That was behind of the cars.

52
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:41,899
Scott: get in.

53
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:45,633
Rym: Well, there's an entrance for the car and I said specifically pedestrian entrances.

54
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:47,500
Scott: Yeah, why didn't you walk in where the cars went in?

55
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,183
Rym: They wouldn't let me.

56
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:50,556
Rym: there's a guy there and he said this is for cars only.

57
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:51,139
Rym: you can't walk in.

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,955
Rym: Okay, I Walked through a loading dock and a urine-soaked hallway and got into the mall.

59
00:02:56,975 --> 00:03:00,138
Scott: Wow Wow, that's kind of crazy.

60
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:05,116
Rym: But for my news in that mall, I bought the cheapest Mac mini money can buy.

61
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:07,284
Rym: Hooray And an iPod.

62
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:08,208
Scott: All right, everyone.

63
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:09,352
Scott: It's time to tell Rym.

64
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:13,489
Scott: we convinced him to buy something Expensive for you know what he needed.

65
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,960
Rym: I was probably going to buy it anyway.

66
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,720
Rym: Yeah, I tried to buy it before but you can't ship Apple things to yourself without signatures before.

67
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:27,438
Scott: Yeah before meaning yesterday meaning after we were convincing you.

68
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:32,540
Rym: now I like it and I'm gonna use it mostly for podcasting once I figure out garage band and all that.

69
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:35,250
Rym: But long term at least for my initial uses.

70
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:37,600
Rym: I really couldn't use a Mac as my primary desktop.

71
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:39,947
Scott: Well, we'll talk about that next Monday.

72
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:42,054
Scott: Yep, because that's not what today's about.

73
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:43,980
Scott: today's about two games.

74
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,751
Rym: Well, weren't you gonna do your news?

75
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:47,080
Scott: yep to gaming news.

76
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:49,360
Scott: Okay, my gaming news.

77
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,911
Scott: So there's this guy and he decided to make a World of Warcraft strategy guide and that kind of reminds me I had a friend who?

78
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:03,920
Scott: bought himself a Super Nintendo by making Mortal Kombat strategy guides back in the olden days and selling them in school.

79
00:04:04,362 --> 00:04:07,419
Scott: And then he got in trouble for it because you're not allowed to sell stuff in school.

80
00:04:08,424 --> 00:04:10,192
Rym: We used to just play poker straight up in school.

81
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:11,237
Rym: Yeah for money.

82
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:11,840
Rym: Yeah.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,012
Scott: So anyway, this guy wrote a World of Warcraft strategy guide and you know Regardless of what you think about gold farming.

84
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:23,526
Scott: It was a gold farming guide Whatever.

85
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:24,800
Scott: That's not the point of the story.

86
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:37,235
Scott: the point of the story was that he was selling it for $15 as a PDF on eBay, you know by now 15 bucks and Blizzard came down on him like a ton of bricks and he said screw you.

87
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:38,880
Scott: and he kept trying to make new eBay accounts.

88
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:59,819
Scott: He didn't take it like most people take it in the ass And he kept fighting it and fighting it and fighting it and eventually without even having to go to court Blizzard just gave up and they agreed just recently to Let him go about his business as long as a. he leaves the disclaimer that was already in the book in the book

89
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:03,249
Rym: Saying that he's not affiliated with World of Warcraft or Blizzard and

90
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:07,080
Scott: that he's not using any copyrighted materials of World of Warcraft or Blizzard

91
00:05:07,722 --> 00:05:13,060
Rym: Even though he could use a significant number of copyrighted materials per fair use especially since it is a guide

92
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,718
Scott: Yep, but he's not using any.

93
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:24,206
Scott: He also has to not publish any sort of cheats and hacks or links to cheats and hacks in the book Which I don't think he was.

94
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,176
Rym: but even if he did that's not illegal.

95
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:26,940
Scott: No, it's not.

96
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,540
Rym: They can't they really can't go after him for that.

97
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,400
Scott: But he did now he you know to basically keep Blizzard from fighting against him and pestering him.

98
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,790
Scott: He made that agreement with them.

99
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,100
Scott: So now it's a contract I guess.

100
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:50,935
Scott: Yeah We'll see but the point of this story is if someone comes after you like an evil company for something that you know is perfectly Legal don't take it if you fight back if they realize that they're wrong.

101
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:52,719
Scott: They pretty much have to give in to you.

102
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:54,465
Rym: Not always.

103
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:57,279
Rym: they could just sue you and win if they have good lawyers and you can't afford one.

104
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:07,560
Scott: Yeah, but when it's in the problem is when it's an open and shut case like this The lawyers are like, alright don't we don't want to go to court But I don't want to sound like idiots when they go there.

105
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,129
Rym: But then again, is it so open and shut?

106
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:16,655
Rym: because I mean if they have lawyers and money They could probably talk about implied contracts and EULA's and talk their way into a conviction to something.

107
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:18,279
Scott: I don't think so.

108
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,205
Rym: We see it happen a lot.

109
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:22,713
Scott: Yeah, but not when it's something so obvious.

110
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:23,495
Scott: It's like god.

111
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:24,839
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

112
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:27,978
Scott: Plus hey, you know the.

113
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:36,919
Scott: If it was something so obvious that I knew I could win I would go out and get like the best lawyers I could but they usually won't work for free for something like that.

114
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:41,720
Scott: Yeah, but if I know I'm gonna win I won't care why because you still have to pay the lawyer?

115
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,469
Scott: Yeah, and I'll get the lawyers to counter sue to get their money.

116
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:46,455
Rym: It doesn't always work.

117
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:47,759
Rym: So well, I think it'll work.

118
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,897
Rym: Maybe you should ask my lawyer about that.

119
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,865
Scott: How'd you go ask your lawyer?

120
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:54,970
Scott: Cuz I can't ask your lawyer.

121
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:56,155
Rym: Oh, you can ask him through me.

122
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:58,462
Rym: You can just call him Whatever.

123
00:06:58,923 --> 00:07:00,207
Rym: Yeah, I got a bother him soon.

124
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:00,990
Rym: I got some questions.

125
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,515
Scott: You got any news action.

126
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:08,080
Rym: I had my news about a Mac Scott took forever doing his laundry and it's real late.

127
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,855
Rym: My laundry was done at like 10.

128
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:15,620
Scott: Yeah, my law I just started mine later because you know, we can only have one washing machine.

129
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:19,318
Rym: Yeah, I don't think it helped that your laundry was sitting idle for quite some time.

130
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,111
Scott: while you dick There's only sitting around idle for like five minutes.

131
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:23,076
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

132
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:27,526
Scott: Yeah Just Cuz you can't wait for me to do.

133
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,354
Scott: I said I'd had three loads and you're like.

134
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,419
Scott: you said you had two loads.

135
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,189
Rym: You listen what I talk now cuz you talk wrong.

136
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:33,991
Rym: I should have recorded it.

137
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:38,096
Rym: I said anyway, it's late So we're gonna do a short episode.

138
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,127
Rym: Things of the day.

139
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:47,659
Rym: I actually found something kind of cool.

140
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:52,516
Rym: There's this video of a plane a passenger plane a big jetliner landing at an airport.

141
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:53,419
Rym: I don't know what Airport.

142
00:07:53,439 --> 00:08:08,079
Rym: and There's this really really strong crosswind and as the planes coming down it kind of turns sideways and Hovers there using its engines to hold itself into the wind and slowly lowers itself and then turns back around.

143
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,146
Rym: and Lance It's crazy.

144
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:10,479
Scott: It's pretty crazy.

145
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:13,007
Scott: You got to wonder what the pilots doing there.

146
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,675
Rym: I imagine he's either real lucky or real skilled.

147
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:23,041
Scott: I Mean if that plane would have not turned back in the right direction Whoo, it looks like there's some water there.

148
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:23,926
Scott: they would have ended up in.

149
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:26,390
Rym: yeah But I don't think there's any other way to land over there.

150
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:30,230
Rym: I I have this feeling that that sort of thing is a common occurrence and the pilot just knew what to do.

151
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:34,429
Scott: Here's a hint don't build airports places like that.

152
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:39,769
Rym: Yeah, you know, I've heard that actually Hong Kong Airport is a lot like that because there was nowhere else to put one.

153
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:41,590
Scott: Oh, well, yeah, you got no choice.

154
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:48,729
Rym: But and actually I heard on NPR today that experts said if New York, New Jersey don't build another Airport real soon The state's screwed.

155
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,563
Rym: Really JFK is already running at full capacity and LaGuardia is at about 95 right?

156
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:58,023
Scott: No, because it JFK There's the old TWA terminal.

157
00:08:58,063 --> 00:08:59,410
Rym: Yeah, you know what they're unused.

158
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:12,550
Rym: There's this huge thing on NPR this morning where they talked about how JFK and LaGuardia can't handle the air load into the New York City anymore at all and How if we don't build a new airport then within ten years there will not be a way.

159
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:21,864
Scott: I'll have to go check that out because Because what I've been to JFK and they have terminals that are sitting there abandoned that they could use Yeah, apparently they can't or something or they can't.

160
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:25,337
Scott: there's not enough Runway and not a terminal.

161
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:25,799
Rym: I think it's just.

162
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,050
Rym: there's not enough capacity there for the expected load.

163
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:33,130
Rym: Could be since New York City is one of the few cities where the economy is in the upswing and crime is going down.

164
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:33,632
Scott: Yep.

165
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:34,395
Scott: All right.

166
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:36,283
Scott: My thing of the day is actually game related.

167
00:09:36,323 --> 00:09:36,886
Scott: Holy crap.

168
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:37,569
Scott: Really?

169
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:48,294
Scott: Yep This is a guy named flying omelet and he made a website with his top 50 favorite video game ending songs Extravaganza part one.

170
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:49,438
Rym: All right, what's number one?

171
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,255
Scott: Number one, I believe is an RPG Named.

172
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:56,449
Scott: it's an RPG heavy list, by the way.

173
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,239
Rym: Well RPGs tend to have the best music.

174
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,365
Scott: Yes, some of them number one.

175
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,756
Scott: Final Fantasy 6.

176
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:06,291
Scott: Final Fantasy 4.

177
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,618
Rym: Final Fantasy 4. at a great 3 chrono trigger.

178
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:14,828
Scott: number 4 is the first is the one of the only non RPGs in the top of the list Panzer Dragoon saga.

179
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:26,190
Scott: and You know number 5 is Metroid 6 earthbound, you know, the list is pretty Expected but some of them with the real good part of this list is number one.

180
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,548
Scott: He's got an mp3 for pretty much every song in the whole thing.

181
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:37,588
Scott: he's got MIDI's for a whole lot of them and Some of them are games you never even heard of.

182
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:39,182
Scott: like.

183
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:41,382
Scott: What's the crazy one?

184
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:44,353
Scott: I never heard of Hyperzone.

185
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:45,638
Scott: you ever heard of hyperzone?

186
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,667
Rym: never I don't really care to either.

187
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:48,350
Scott: How about skyblazer?

188
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,273
Rym: I've heard of that.

189
00:10:50,413 --> 00:10:51,677
Rym: I've heard that before.

190
00:10:51,697 --> 00:10:54,587
Rym: I don't know what the game is, but I've heard the word skyblazer.

191
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:59,243
Scott: Yeah Megaman 2 and 3 were on the list, but they were pretty low.

192
00:10:59,344 --> 00:11:02,598
Scott: but considering the top 50 I'll let it slide a little bit.

193
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,289
Rym: Yeah, Megaman 2 didn't have the greatest ending music.

194
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,838
Scott: Megaman 2 had excellent ending music.

195
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:09,124
Rym: you talking about a good music.

196
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:10,310
Rym: the ending song wasn't that special.

197
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:13,462
Scott: Number 49 is Drakken, which is one of those games.

198
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:18,390
Rym: It's impossible God Drakken I could do a whole show about how bad that game was.

199
00:11:18,518 --> 00:11:24,630
Scott: Yeah There's a lot of bad games on this list that I for some reason or another this guy thinks they have good ending music.

200
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:27,101
Rym: I definitely agree with the guys top three at least.

201
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:29,170
Scott: I don't say they're the numb.

202
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:32,778
Rym: Do you remember the ending song to Final Fantasy 4?

203
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:33,620
Scott: Yeah, you know.

204
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:34,764
Scott: and while ending songs.

205
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:36,709
Rym: Oh, oh do you how'd it go?

206
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:39,564
Rym: But I thought you said you remembered.

207
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:40,988
Scott: I do but I can't sing it.

208
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:45,570
Scott: Oh Yeah, when something like this, let me push the button on the computer here, right?

209
00:11:46,771 --> 00:12:03,470
Scott: Anyway, yeah, you know while RPGs have you know, usually the good epic music There are plenty of musics in other Genres of video game music that are better, you know It's sort of like it's picking Final Fantasy 6 and 4 and krona trigger.

210
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,241
Scott: It's sort of like you're picking the same song three times now.

211
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:08,345
Rym: Final Fantasy 6 is ending.

212
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:12,149
Scott: song was vastly different from fours Yeah, but it's the same kind of song.

213
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:13,414
Rym: What do you mean?

214
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:14,758
Rym: the same kind of song?

215
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:24,065
Scott: It's like if I made a list of best Songs ever period and I chose all like rock songs for the top 25.

216
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:30,110
Scott: It's like, okay, seriously You know, it's like picking best video game songs ever and choosing mostly RPGs.

217
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:35,550
Rym: Well, I think it's partly that RPG music tends to be more classical and more complex in nature.

218
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:40,750
Scott: Yep, that's true, which generally but that doesn't make it necessarily better than other music.

219
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:48,884
Scott: Well, it depends on what criteria is using for better and I think yeah the guys criteria I have to let him slide also is that it's his top 50 favorites.

220
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,490
Scott: So this is this guy's favorites.

221
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,801
Scott: He's not claiming that these are the best ones.

222
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:54,530
Rym: Well, I at least agree with him.

223
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:59,010
Scott: Yeah, I slight I would take his top 50 and just put him in a different order probably.

224
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:05,835
Scott: So because Rym is all tired and wussy and yeah, Scott's tired, too I'm not tired.

225
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:06,881
Rym: We got to get this done.

226
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,570
Rym: It's late and I want to play with my max amor.

227
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:09,495
Scott: Yeah, you're late.

228
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:09,979
Scott: It's late.

229
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,129
Scott: You want to play with the Mac and I don't care anyway.

230
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:18,886
Scott: Today we're gonna talk about something real easy to talk about real old not that old.

231
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:20,110
Scott: It's still being played today.

232
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:21,033
Rym: I haven't though.

233
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:26,450
Rym: I haven't personally played it in over a year me either but that's besides the point hasn't changed very much.

234
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:34,653
Scott: We're gonna talk about the classic perhaps number one FPS ever in existence multiplayer FPS Counter-strike.

235
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:54,827
Rym: I mean for anyone who doesn't really realize it counter-strike was the number one FPS in terms of number of players for pretty much the entirety of the time we were in college pretty much from the end of the quake 2 era Until the World of Warcraft era when people just started the FPS has started dropping out of favor.

236
00:13:55,348 --> 00:14:10,289
Scott: even so counter-strike is still played by thousands and thousands of people around the world at to this day is Perhaps the most popular multiplayer online game ever to exist and it is doubtful whether it will ever be beaten

237
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:14,223
Rym: Other than lineage possibly in terms of raw numbers, but that is

238
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:14,945
Scott: World of Warcraft.

239
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:16,270
Scott: is beaten lineage in numbers now?

240
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,878
Rym: Oh now it is.

241
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:28,650
Scott: Yeah So, but this is you know counter-strike is a game where there were always around the world Thousands perhaps tens of thousands people playing it constantly no matter where you live.

242
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:37,490
Rym: There were low ping servers near you that were full all the time and it's been going on For how long since since about the year?

243
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,353
Rym: 1999.

244
00:14:39,353 --> 00:14:42,261
Scott: so seven years give or take something like that.

245
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:45,371
Rym: It really really took off the summer of 2000.

246
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:49,290
Scott: Yeah, that's that's when it lost and then it took off again.

247
00:14:49,752 --> 00:14:54,236
Rym: I forget which beta came out, but there was one I think was 1.3 Something.

248
00:14:54,236 --> 00:14:55,364
Scott: 1.3 wasn't beta.

249
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:56,189
Rym: Yeah, that was one point.

250
00:14:56,611 --> 00:14:57,397
Scott: Oh was non.

251
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:02,079
Rym: 1.0 was non beta and one of those versions Shortly after there is when the game exploded crazy like it.

252
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,410
Scott: at one point one was an explosion and beta 7 was an explosion.

253
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,817
Rym: Yeah, beta 7 is the one I think I was thinking of.

254
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:12,270
Scott: yeah, so let's talk about how we started playing counter-strike.

255
00:15:12,731 --> 00:15:13,012
Rym: All right.

256
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:19,010
Rym: Well that thing is I tried it first before Scott, but Scott played it before I did.

257
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:32,007
Rym: It's kind of weird, but I'd heard of this counter-strike and so I think it was can or someone told me to play it and I got it and I played it and I died right away and then I died again and the game was just frustrating and difficult and I quit immediately.

258
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:43,090
Scott: and that was it For me in high school, we only had dial-up modem so I couldn't play too many online games besides Diablo 2 else would never play again.

259
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:51,928
Scott: And I had half-life 1 which I beat and I really like half-life 1 And I wanted to play some multiplayer games.

260
00:15:51,948 --> 00:16:07,017
Scott: and So when I got to college, I played Team Fortress classic mostly the hunted type Which is where you which is sort of like counter-strike with a VIP You know, you got to get this VIP to the to the garage so he's safe But the other guys are trying to snipe him.

261
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,349
Scott: It's it's actually the only decent Team Fortress scenario.

262
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:18,790
Scott: anyway in CS1 lab the lab instructor was like, oh you got to play counter-strike.

263
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,057
Scott: Yeah, when you die, you don't come back.

264
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:23,484
Scott: and I was like, well that sucks.

265
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:25,490
Scott: I'm gonna die and then sit around doing nothing.

266
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,246
Scott: I'll just turn the game off or you know quit and go find another game to play.

267
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:30,089
Scott: and what's the point of that?

268
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:36,789
Scott: Now I had heard of counter-strike, but I didn't really Know that it was a free half-life mod.

269
00:16:37,352 --> 00:16:41,970
Scott: I thought it was some game and that's all I knew is there was a game named counter-strike that I didn't want to play.

270
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:49,350
Rym: See at least cuz I had a cable modem Early early on like me and my friend Ken got cable modems when they were still kind of being rolled out in the country.

271
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:54,843
Rym: So we were playing for every freaking mod quake 1 and quake 2 online pretty all through high school.

272
00:16:54,863 --> 00:17:03,329
Rym: Mm-hmm counter-strike was just another one and Honestly when I first played it, I thought this is like a crappy version of action quake.

273
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:06,290
Scott: Anyway.

274
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,910
Scott: So then, you know, someone told me that counter-strike was actually a free half-life mod.

275
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,807
Scott: So, of course, I'm gonna try it because I'll try it once why not free.

276
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:25,609
Scott: Hey So I tried it and then whoa There's counter-strike from there on till tribes 2 and then counter-strike again and then natural selection and then counter-strike again.

277
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:34,939
Rym: Yep, cuz Scott tells me not too long because this is when we we knew and this is the crew would all come together But we were still freshmen at RIT So we weren't really the front row crew fully yet.

278
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,188
Rym: and I still have all the chat logs from back then when I used ICQ.

279
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,876
Rym: Oh, those were good days.

280
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:41,619
Scott: Nah.

281
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,422
Rym: Yeah.

282
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,485
Rym: I see you as the bomb.

283
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:46,759
Rym: Javert does more and better Yeah, but Javert wasn't around back then.

284
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:47,242
Scott: Yeah, it was.

285
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:48,549
Scott: it was just not as good as it is now.

286
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:52,030
Rym: It was not around in a form that I would have used.

287
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,250
Scott: No No one that you you don't use anything.

288
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:55,474
Rym: But Scott messaged me.

289
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:59,810
Rym: one is I'm playing counter-strike and it's great and I remember thinking I remember trying that game.

290
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,778
Rym: It was just a slow version of action quake.

291
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:13,550
Rym: No, I don't know why I would play that half-life one was crap Mmm, because the back then Quake 2 was still really big for the mods and the quake 2 mods were just about to die.

292
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:18,029
Scott: It's like as counter-strike gained in popularity quake 2 dropped off a cliff.

293
00:18:18,774 --> 00:18:30,929
Rym: Yep, because before counter-strike took off I mean action quake and weapons factory and even like mega TF for quake 1 were still super super super popular Relatively, I mean if you compare it to the popular of games now.

294
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:31,712
Scott: It was.

295
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:41,102
Scott: it was there a popular relative to the time when you see when an FPS gaming wasn't Super crazy huge and not in broadband wasn't widespread.

296
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:44,030
Scott: Yeah, the pills games were wicked more popular than any other game.

297
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:51,650
Rym: Yeah, the people who had broadband were pretty much guaranteed to be in that culture of you know mod FPS quake 2 style gaming.

298
00:18:51,891 --> 00:19:04,086
Scott: Yeah, if graphic in game development had gone slower and network speeds had gone faster Then quake 2 would be now And we all had broadband and it would be the number one game.

299
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:08,690
Rym: Yep And we could do a whole show about the progression of like the quake 2 era.

300
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,420
Scott: I think we already did a show about FPS is.

301
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,210
Scott: so yeah, we'd let's stick to the counter-strike.

302
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:23,533
Rym: but I tried the game again and I started getting it and I started liking it and I played it pretty much continuously until Natural selection.

303
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:30,495
Rym: I was discovered by me and then I went back to it and then tribes 2 came out and tribes 2 came out Before natural selection.

304
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:31,781
Rym: try well long before.

305
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:33,550
Rym: I don't really remember the chronology.

306
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,356
Rym: All I remember is when tribes 2 came out.

307
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:39,070
Rym: We stopped playing counter-strike pretty much until tribes 2 died.

308
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,725
Scott: Yeah, that's how it went.

309
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:44,000
Scott: Tribes - it's like counter-strike was this game.

310
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,570
Scott: You could always go back to because there are people always playing it.

311
00:19:46,610 --> 00:20:04,532
Scott: Yeah, like every other FPS that came out, you know was just a dent in Counter-strike, you know unreal would come out and a few counter-strike people would go to unreal and then some of them would come back And every time a new big FPS came out counter-strike would go down a little bit and then go back up a little bit less Than that.

312
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:12,147
Scott: So, you know after it reaches peak it's been declining but It's still there with still thousands of players.

313
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:19,696
Rym: Yep I still I'll still bet that it's probably one of the most played FPS is still oh Absolutely, if not the most played.

314
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:21,140
Scott: just think about all those FPS.

315
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,710
Scott: is that put a dent in counter-strike over the years are now mostly dead.

316
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:25,754
Rym: Yep, I mean the.

317
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:29,929
Rym: the only real survivor that I know of is natural selection, which is hanging on.

318
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,879
Scott: There's that battlefield.

319
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:32,623
Scott: people play then.

320
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:33,026
Rym: Yep.

321
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:33,570
Rym: It's a good game.

322
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,011
Rym: I'm just.

323
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:38,327
Scott: some people playing unreal some people play sin and some people play quake.

324
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:41,377
Rym: for yeah Not so many people play the newer quakes.

325
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:43,985
Rym: Yeah, like quake 3 was a flash in the pan.

326
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:44,446
Scott: Yep.

327
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:45,349
Scott: There's a bunch of.

328
00:20:46,153 --> 00:20:47,655
Scott: well Quick, there's.

329
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:48,981
Scott: we'll talk about quick three another time.

330
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:51,090
Rym: Yeah, we could do a whole show on the reason anomaly.

331
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:54,583
Scott: Yeah, but there are a lot of half-life mods that have a small following.

332
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:59,055
Scott: you can always get a game as Sven co-op if you want or Science and industry.

333
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:02,987
Scott: Yeah, none of them, you know, maybe a hundred players at most.

334
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:03,790
Scott: that would be insane.

335
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:07,726
Rym: You can't just do with counter-strike with these games what you can do with counter-strike.

336
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:09,835
Rym: log on There's a server.

337
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:11,121
Rym: just click on the top server and play.

338
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:22,381
Scott: Yeah, and there's people there and they're good Mm-hmm, or they're punk kids punk kids All right, now we're not gonna talk about counter-strike cheating yeah, but the culture of counter-strike.

339
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:28,137
Rym: a lot of people pointed to it as the End-all or the bottom of the internet.

340
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:35,099
Scott: and that's just not true because the bottom of the internet is like style project and F Net and style project and fortune and fortune.

341
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,082
Scott: That's the bottom.

342
00:21:36,323 --> 00:21:40,978
Rym: but people always make jokes about about the Terribleness of the people in counter-strike.

343
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:44,930
Rym: and there were a lot of assholes playing counter-strike, but they're mostly just 12 year olds.

344
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,957
Scott: They weren't assholes.

345
00:21:46,078 --> 00:21:47,347
Scott: They're just there like every other 12 year old.

346
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:57,930
Rym: I think it's that so many people played counter-strike that Every server it was like a million different countries and depending on where you played there any every walk of life was represented in counter-strike.

347
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,078
Scott: Well every teenage male walk of life.

348
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:01,881
Scott: that is true.

349
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:03,005
Rym: true though.

350
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:04,490
Scott: I'd a few females here and there.

351
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:06,850
Rym: Yeah, I knew some pretty badass females at that game.

352
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:21,190
Rym: Oh, there are plenty of badass ones but but like I remember the people who complained the most about counter-strike were the people who never played it or Played some other obscure mod Like say the people who still played action quake long after counter-strike at one.

353
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,550
Rym: Those people had a very close-knit community where everyone knew everyone.

354
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:45,006
Rym: So when they get into counter-strike and not only does no one recognize or fear their clan tag but no one recognizes them or talks to them and there are people speaking strange lingos like stfu nub nub Jew I Think around back bomb number two.

355
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:50,024
Scott: Oh my god Go go go.

356
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,137
Scott: Okay, that's the end of the counter-strike radio jokes.

357
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:54,920
Rym: Yeah.

358
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,323
Rym: Yeah fire hole.

359
00:22:56,664 --> 00:23:00,781
Rym: now bear in mind that this is before I mean when counter-strike was super popular.

360
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:02,368
Rym: There wasn't the voice chat built in.

361
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:05,521
Scott: Yeah, all you could do is say the built-in things.

362
00:23:05,902 --> 00:23:10,103
Rym: some people would use things like team speak But some people consider that cheating.

363
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,238
Scott: Yeah There's a lot of dead speak going on.

364
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:18,393
Scott: So they didn't want anyone to use any out-of-game chat Things.

365
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:26,750
Scott: while you play counter-strike, I have to admit Scott and I were the masters of oh We were totally the masters because we'd be in the same room playing cat for anyone doesn't know the way counter-strike works.

366
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,714
Scott: Let's do a short description.

367
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:28,416
Rym: We should we should.

368
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:31,869
Scott: so there's two teams the terrorists and the counter-terrorists.

369
00:23:32,714 --> 00:23:42,935
Scott: There's three scenarios the DE Demolition scenario the CS counter-strike scenario and the a s the long-forgotten Assault scenario.

370
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:45,846
Rym: Well, no as was assassinate assassinate.

371
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:51,776
Scott: a scenario ultra long lost Escape es scenario.

372
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:52,698
Rym: Oh escape.

373
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,168
Scott: now, let's talk about the ultra long lost never to be played again.

374
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:59,529
Rym: escape scenario It was a really cool idea, but it didn't work.

375
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:06,549
Rym: Well, the reason it didn't work is that back when that was around and even that even today It's hard to make maps in half-life.

376
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:12,549
Rym: Oh real hard you because you have to make the map by modeling it, but you also have to program the map.

377
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,182
Rym: Yeah, it's basically you're writing code really the map making tools.

378
00:24:16,202 --> 00:24:21,050
Scott: while they're better now than they were ass They're really not easy to use at all.

379
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,522
Rym: Plus some people like one map.

380
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:25,750
Rym: I think it was docks.

381
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:31,610
Rym: I don't remember all the details because I didn't really care but the map was a terrible terrible terrible map.

382
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:32,940
Rym: It just didn't work.

383
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:34,190
Rym: It was not a dead guy.

384
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:35,030
Scott: Yeah, okay.

385
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:40,570
Rym: But then the guy the kid the punk kid who made the map killed himself not long after making the mat.

386
00:24:41,372 --> 00:24:44,922
Rym: so all the servers kept playing the map and talking about awesome.

387
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:49,960
Rym: the map was as a tribute to this kid and While it's horrible the kid died.

388
00:24:50,261 --> 00:24:51,870
Rym: the map he made was terrible.

389
00:24:52,493 --> 00:25:02,310
Rym: There's no reason that we should have to subject ourselves to that and in fact I got banned from a server for saying that that map sucks because the admin was like a kid died for this map.

390
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:08,090
Scott: Okay, yeah Yes, yes is an escape map.

391
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:18,510
Scott: This is where the terrorists are in a prison of some sort and they have to escape Which means they all have to get to some other place on the map before the counter-terrorists kill them all.

392
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,421
Rym: They usually don't start with weapons.

393
00:25:20,683 --> 00:25:21,870
Scott: Yes, it really sucked.

394
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:33,469
Scott: It was a good idea and if it was executed properly would make a really fun game but it was never executed properly and Everyone would go change the map or servers would just take the map out of the rotation and that would be it

395
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:33,911
Rym: Yep,

396
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:36,541
Scott: and then they took the maps out of counter-strike all together.

397
00:25:37,163 --> 00:25:41,950
Rym: Now as was probably my favorite Was also my favorite there were only a few maps where it actually worked.

398
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:43,495
Rym: Yep, now the whole thing is.

399
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:45,482
Rym: one guy was the VIP.

400
00:25:45,803 --> 00:25:46,305
Scott: Mm-hmm.

401
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:47,589
Scott: He was a counter-terrorist.

402
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:52,592
Rym: Yeah I think he was giving a. he was given a pistol and he had a whole bunch of body armor on and he was a Person.

403
00:25:52,612 --> 00:25:57,057
Rym: his only goal was to escape to the helicopter Yep, and it really suck.

404
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:04,482
Rym: as if you were a counter-terrorist you would be randomly selected to be the VIP Which sometimes it was like you could tell because it always kind of randomly picked.

405
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:08,101
Rym: but there if you were good and you kept surviving It tended to keep picking you

406
00:26:08,404 --> 00:26:19,124
Scott: kinda yeah yeah, but but it really sucked because it threw this big kink in the game where if whoever got picked to be the VIP suck Your game was basically screwed no matter how good the rest of the CT's were.

407
00:26:19,606 --> 00:26:25,830
Rym: or by the same token Sometimes you really didn't like say the terrorists are just owning you and every round they just gun the guy down.

408
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:27,839
Rym: Suddenly you're the VIP.

409
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:28,945
Rym: You have no weapons.

410
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:29,970
Rym: You've got a little pistol.

411
00:26:30,251 --> 00:26:33,549
Rym: You got to worry about all your friends and then here come the terrorists to gun you down.

412
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:35,918
Rym: Yeah, you're running away high corners.

413
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:38,387
Scott: my situation it was usually I was a counter-terrorist.

414
00:26:38,427 --> 00:26:39,310
Scott: we'd lose lose lose.

415
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,346
Scott: I would be the VIP and I would go my patented VIP oil rig guaranteed escape route.

416
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:47,114
Rym: Yeah every single time My what was the snow one?

417
00:26:47,154 --> 00:26:48,138
Rym: That was my favorite.

418
00:26:48,198 --> 00:26:50,285
Rym: Yeah, Tundra was my favorite assassinate man.

419
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:51,870
Scott: No, it's all about oil rig.

420
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,138
Scott: Anyway, then comes the CS.

421
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:57,210
Scott: the CS and the DE maps are pretty much most of the maps.

422
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,397
Scott: Yep, CS is counter-strike.

423
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:00,521
Scott: This is where the.

424
00:27:00,642 --> 00:27:03,110
Scott: there are some hostages which are not actual players.

425
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,237
Scott: They're just kind of standing there.

426
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:06,250
Rym: Yeah, they used to be tricks you could do with them.

427
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:06,815
Rym: we'll talk about.

428
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:11,670
Scott: yeah, they're in some part of the map and The counter-terrorists need to rescue these hostages.

429
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:21,470
Scott: so they need to go to where the hostages are touch the hostages then go to Back to where the counter-terrorists started and then the hostages are rescued.

430
00:27:21,851 --> 00:27:27,610
Scott: So you have to go into the enemy base and out and the terrorists all they have to do is prevent the counter-terrorists from rescuing.

431
00:27:28,451 --> 00:27:32,890
Rym: Now for the long job the game was set up where to grab a hostage.

432
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,122
Rym: You basically run up to him and use him and then he'll follow you around like a dude.

433
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:37,949
Rym: Mm-hmm now terrorists could do this, too.

434
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:46,712
Rym: so Smart terrorists would grab one hostage and hide him somewhere or they grab all the hostages and stash him in a closet somewhere and guard That yep.

435
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:50,250
Scott: No, you couldn't kill the hostages because then you would lose your money, which we'll talk about later.

436
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:53,949
Scott: Yeah, you're killing the hostages no matter what team you are on screwed you.

437
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:57,180
Scott: So unless you were desperate you wouldn't kill all the hostages.

438
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:07,616
Scott: a lot of times hostages got gunned down just in a firefight But that was a because a terrorist would sit near the hostages waiting for the counter-terrorists to come and rescue them And then the counter-terrorists would show up.

439
00:28:07,857 --> 00:28:11,347
Scott: There'd be a billion bullets everywhere and some you know hostages get killed.

440
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:15,184
Scott: It just happens Yeah, anyway, and then there's the DE map.

441
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:16,370
Scott: DE is demolitions.

442
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:25,126
Scott: This is where there are two one or more bomb spots Usually two sometimes three and the terrorists want to blow up any of these bomb spots.

443
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:26,752
Scott: if they blow up just one of them They win.

444
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:44,569
Scott: one guy randomly selected on the terrorist team has a bomb The only bomb and he has to bring that bomb to one of the bomb spots set it up Which takes like five seconds then wait around for it to explode and hope that a counter-terrorist doesn't come and defuse it.

445
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:50,810
Scott: now If you die before you plant the bomb someone else on your team can pick it up and go do the job.

446
00:28:52,091 --> 00:28:55,345
Scott: If the bomb is defused it's over because you only have one bomb.

447
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:58,524
Scott: and once you plant the bomb You can't pick it up and bring it somewhere else.

448
00:28:58,584 --> 00:28:59,410
Scott: It's you planted it.

449
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,449
Scott: That's where it's gonna be until it either explodes or is defused.

450
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:07,923
Scott: Yep You could also always win any game of counter-strike by killing the other team to a point.

451
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:14,762
Rym: if the terrorists plant the bomb and then They all get killed but the bomb still goes off terrorists win the terrorists still win.

452
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:15,363
Rym: That's right.

453
00:29:15,403 --> 00:29:17,850
Scott: terrorists win suicide terrorist bombers.

454
00:29:20,732 --> 00:29:23,930
Rym: I was just thinking of some natural selection things, but I'll talk about those another day.

455
00:29:24,032 --> 00:29:24,652
Rym: Yes another.

456
00:29:24,732 --> 00:29:27,926
Scott: the thing that made counter-strike real popular were two things.

457
00:29:27,986 --> 00:29:34,975
Scott: number one in Any route counter-strike is played in rounds you play until someone wins then you do it again then do it again Then you change the map.

458
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:36,201
Rym: there's short rounds.

459
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,637
Rym: Yeah the game itself You know, there are games like SWAT.

460
00:29:39,657 --> 00:29:42,328
Rym: there are games that involve terrorism counterterrorism action.

461
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:49,788
Rym: Basically, the premise of counter-strike is that the round begins the moment that negotiations broke down.

462
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,013
Scott: Yep So it's the.

463
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:53,597
Scott: you know, the terrorists made some demands.

464
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:56,165
Scott: the counter-terrorists didn't agree to the demands.

465
00:29:56,526 --> 00:29:58,753
Scott: and then you know You go click.

466
00:29:59,034 --> 00:30:03,989
Scott: they said the counter-terrorists decided to go in or the terrorists decided.

467
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:05,623
Scott: All right We're gonna go plant this bomb.

468
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:06,350
Scott: fuck those guys.

469
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,434
Scott: They didn't meet our demands.

470
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:10,848
Scott: and then as soon as the game says let's go team.

471
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,490
Scott: That's the minute that you know, you decided that you're gonna go do the job.

472
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,738
Rym: Yeah, you make your dynamic entry a big firefight.

473
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:18,782
Rym: someone comes out on top.

474
00:30:19,143 --> 00:30:19,323
Scott: Yep.

475
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:20,407
Rym: There's a time limit.

476
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:21,130
Rym: you have an objective.

477
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:23,510
Rym: It's not just kill other people like most FPS is were.

478
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:28,370
Scott: Yes, the one problem in counter-strike is that if you don't end up with good players, they won't try for the objective.

479
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:33,567
Scott: They'll just try to camp or kill all the other players and they won't help you plant the bomb.

480
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:39,750
Scott: many a time I would go with the bomb or and plant it on my own or rescue the hostages all on my own.

481
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:44,694
Rym: Well, everyone else is fighting somewhere else and if Scott and I were on a team and our team sucked It just didn't matter.

482
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:45,599
Rym: we could handle it.

483
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,081
Rym: Yep.

484
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:49,215
Scott: As long as the other team wasn't really really good I mean, I don't want to brag.

485
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:56,419
Rym: Well, I love bragging but Scott and I were Extremely badass at counter-strike.

486
00:30:56,439 --> 00:31:02,590
Scott: I don't know how badass we are now now Counter-strike source where we mostly played the older counter-strike.

487
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:06,750
Scott: Yeah, but I mean when we played when we played we were pretty good.

488
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:10,910
Rym: I mean we the to one of us joining a team could pretty much turn the tide.

489
00:31:11,212 --> 00:31:14,150
Scott: I would say most of the time that we lost it was because of a cheater.

490
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:16,710
Rym: Yeah, I would honestly agree with that.

491
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:19,307
Rym: I mean We're just really freaking good at that game.

492
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:22,609
Scott: But also many times when we won it was because the cheater was on our team.

493
00:31:23,152 --> 00:31:24,456
Rym: You want to know why we were so good.

494
00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:29,773
Rym: We wasted countless hours when we refresh whenever we weren't Class.

495
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:33,050
Scott: you're playing counter-strike until nighttime when we did something else instead.

496
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:40,070
Rym: Yeah, because we'd all get together and play D&D and battle tech and stuff at night But during the day between classes we just played counter-strike.

497
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:42,299
Scott: Yeah, what else are you gonna do for that short amount of time?

498
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,870
Rym: five rounds of CS duh, and you know, what's amazing?

499
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,674
Rym: Pretty much everyone else did too.

500
00:31:47,396 --> 00:31:51,610
Rym: Yeah walking walking around the dorms at RIT at any given daylight hour.

501
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:59,558
Scott: All you could hear in any room was either ticketing Or Those are the two things you heard at RIT dorms.

502
00:31:59,578 --> 00:32:00,380
Rym: Sometimes you heard both.

503
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:03,508
Rym: Oh, you know one roommates playing doesn't notice.

504
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:09,050
Scott: the other roommates The two gimmicks they're not really gimmicks they're the gate.

505
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:13,944
Scott: They're the gameplay aspects that make counter-strike unique and awesome.

506
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:14,807
Rym: Yeah the gimmicks.

507
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:20,224
Scott: Yes One of them is that when you die you don't respawn.

508
00:32:20,264 --> 00:32:25,490
Scott: now if you've ever played quake the second you die You push a button and now you're in the game again immediately.

509
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:31,952
Scott: I know just keep playing and playing and playing until you get enough kills and the game's over and Counter-strike.

510
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:36,550
Scott: when you die you're out for the rest of the round until one of the team's wins.

511
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:40,309
Scott: You can just float around doing nothing usually watching what's going on.

512
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,825
Scott: Well early on you could watch what was going on and now you can too.

513
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:46,636
Scott: I remember in one version They added the black screen of death.

514
00:32:46,997 --> 00:32:50,710
Rym: Yeah, you couldn't see or at least you could only see what your teammates could see.

515
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,158
Rym: Yeah, because otherwise here's the scenario.

516
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,529
Rym: it is now which Scott and I did occasionally just for fun.

517
00:32:56,132 --> 00:33:01,949
Rym: Usually when we were on opposite teams, like I was a terrorist and he was a counter terrorist But then say he died because one of us shot him.

518
00:33:02,552 --> 00:33:09,058
Rym: He would then tell me where the last guys were just different in the round quicker But alright, so we're on the same team.

519
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:11,668
Rym: Let's say in a tournament whatever and I die.

520
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:17,690
Rym: What's to stop me from floating around and then calling Scott on his cell phone and telling him?

521
00:33:18,151 --> 00:33:22,586
Rym: Yeah, the last terrorist is hiding behind the box at the far end of bombsite.

522
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:28,164
Scott: be yep and That was known as ghosting and it's kind of cheating but not really.

523
00:33:28,384 --> 00:33:29,710
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty much cheating.

524
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:34,220
Rym: Yeah, the thing is no one ever did it in a real match And if you did you were just kind of an asshole.

525
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:35,668
Scott: no one did it in a real match.

526
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:40,969
Scott: No but anyway The second thing about counter-strike was the weapons.

527
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:46,430
Scott: The way it worked is when you started a game of counter-strike you had what like eight hundred bucks.

528
00:33:46,831 --> 00:33:49,159
Rym: Yeah, eight hundred dollars not really hundred dollars.

529
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:58,510
Scott: eight hundred dollars in the game and with those eight hundred dollars You could buy Weapons and different weapons cost different amounts of money and you had to pay for ammo and you had to pay for armor.

530
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:08,089
Rym: you had to pay for grenades and the weapons were Varied enough to where you really felt good buying a different weapon and the weapons were all modeled after real weapons.

531
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:11,400
Rym: now They weren't realistic in a literal sense.

532
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:12,123
Scott: Not yet.

533
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,089
Scott: A military fanboy would be pissed off.

534
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,885
Scott: However, I compared to quake or doom or wolfenstein.

535
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:18,909
Scott: these things are awesome.

536
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:24,310
Rym: They were extremely realistic from a minor pseudo military fanboy perspective exactly.

537
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,891
Rym: You know the kids.

538
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:25,594
Rym: you like the kids.

539
00:34:25,614 --> 00:34:25,976
Rym: you hear any.

540
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:32,532
Rym: you hear them all the time online talking about the merits of the stair versus the m4 carbine Carbine.

541
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:34,717
Rym: a lot of people say carbine whatever.

542
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:37,764
Rym: anyway those kids they eat it up.

543
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:39,929
Rym: kids love talking about desert eagles.

544
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:45,181
Scott: They are So usually in the first round of counter-strike on a prop on a server.

545
00:34:45,202 --> 00:34:45,925
Scott: that didn't you know?

546
00:34:45,945 --> 00:34:48,975
Scott: cuz servers could say you could start With more money, but most of them didn't.

547
00:34:49,536 --> 00:34:52,746
Scott: it would be the pistol round because you could only afford pistols.

548
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:55,750
Scott: now everyone starts No matter what you get this shit pistol.

549
00:34:56,492 --> 00:34:58,459
Scott: And the other thing is different teams have different weapons.

550
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,575
Scott: the counter terrorists have in my opinion much better weapons But they're more expensive.

551
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:03,439
Scott: They are more.

552
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,171
Rym: terrorists get all the AKs and Mac 10.

553
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:16,984
Scott: Terrorists get AK-47s Mac 10s and SIGs while I mean terrorists get those and counter-terrorists get Augs, and I remember when they added the p90 p9.

554
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:18,931
Rym: there's both.

555
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:26,072
Scott: people got that or the five seven pistol the five seven pistol the and then the terrorists have the The elites.

556
00:35:26,514 --> 00:35:28,299
Rym: Yeah, the elites Oh elites.

557
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,907
Rym: That was the dumbest thing ever the best pistol.

558
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:36,086
Scott: Oh my god I went through a phase where I would try to elite all I could.

559
00:35:36,106 --> 00:35:39,478
Scott: I always kept my elites And then I would whip them out whenever I had a chance.

560
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,943
Rym: I have for some reason.

561
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:42,950
Rym: I love using the normal shotgun.

562
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:44,934
Rym: Really pump shotgun.

563
00:35:44,974 --> 00:35:45,636
Rym: it was terrible.

564
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:49,850
Rym: I usually died, but there was nothing more satisfying better than using the noob cannon.

565
00:35:50,111 --> 00:36:04,189
Rym: There's nothing more satisfying in the world than standing there and a terrorist war runs around the corner And he stops and he's about to shoot you and you turn and you put one Shotgun blast into him and he flies over and falls dead.

566
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:08,328
Scott: Yeah, his friends and you gotta reload and pump and someone kills you.

567
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:09,043
Rym: Yeah Yeah.

568
00:36:09,592 --> 00:36:14,470
Scott: Anyway, no the the super shotgun the Benelli in counter-strike is known as the noob cannon.

569
00:36:14,852 --> 00:36:18,105
Scott: Some people who don't know might call some other guns the noob cannon.

570
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:19,210
Scott: They're idiots.

571
00:36:20,037 --> 00:36:21,589
Scott: The noob cannon is the Benelli shotgun.

572
00:36:22,532 --> 00:36:25,521
Scott: The thing about the Benelli shotgun is an automatic shotgun.

573
00:36:25,781 --> 00:36:39,859
Scott: It's real you could fire it like how many times it was But it was like doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Until you ran out of shells and you could fire like eight times I think before you had to reload.

574
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:49,310
Scott: now reloading took a while because you had to go click Click click as you filled it with shotgun shells But you could interrupt the loading process to shoot which most other guns you couldn't yep.

575
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:55,147
Scott: So you'd be like, you know, you would start with a full loadout, you know And you'd go you'd see a guy and you go doo doo doo doo.

576
00:36:55,207 --> 00:37:04,686
Rym: now The reason a lot of people call it the noob cannon is that in in close quarters I mean someone skilled could deal with it and team tactics could definitely take it out.

577
00:37:04,987 --> 00:37:05,930
Rym: It wasn't the best weapon.

578
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:11,150
Rym: It was however the best weapon for someone who had absolutely no skill and they probably kill someone.

579
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:20,602
Scott: yeah, if you have absolutely no accuracy in your aiming and You need to kill someone and do a lot of damage Your best bet is to use the noob cannon.

580
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:26,070
Scott: you get a bunch of guys in front of you You push the button as fast as you can and you're likely to deal out a lot of damage.

581
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:37,899
Scott: It's like the real world if you had an auto shotgun and you're in a room full of I don't know five-year-olds If you had an auto shotgun and you in a room full of Navy SEALs You would still hose them until and they would kill you.

582
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:41,030
Scott: maybe like, you know five after you shot a bunch of shells.

583
00:37:41,211 --> 00:37:44,690
Scott: Yep, you could get plenty of shots off if you knew what you're doing.

584
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:53,195
Scott: You can't miss a target with an automatic shotgun, especially not like across the room maybe across the field but not across the room.

585
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:59,736
Scott: and counter-strike had a lot of rooms and not so many fields because of the half-life engine didn't really allow For outdoors so much.

586
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:02,509
Scott: Yep, half-life 2 engine fixes that.

587
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:05,825
Rym: now We actually at one point decided to run a counter-strike server on.

588
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:09,302
Rym: well How slow was that piece of crap computer we had?

589
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:15,447
Scott: it was a piece of shit, man I think it was in my old Pentium 3 450 or no, it was even slower.

590
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:16,732
Scott: It was a Pentium 200.

591
00:38:16,732 --> 00:38:17,998
Rym: I think it was a Pentium 200.

592
00:38:17,998 --> 00:38:18,500
Rym: It might have been a 233.

593
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,284
Rym: It was old and shitty.

594
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:25,752
Rym: We were we just we really wanted to run a counter-strike server, but we didn't have money or extra computers Mm-hmm.

595
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:27,481
Rym: So we took this crap old computer.

596
00:38:28,023 --> 00:38:29,269
Rym: We put counter-strike on it.

597
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:41,935
Rym: we discovered that as long as less than seven people were on the server the ping was okay if More than seven people were on or if the map was actually a real map as opposed to icy world Which is the only map we could run.

598
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:45,630
Scott: Yeah, the icy world if you don't know is the smallest tiniest map.

599
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:47,150
Rym: It's also a map with no objective.

600
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,499
Rym: It's one of the FY maps which unofficially stands for fuck you.

601
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:57,040
Rym: Yeah, and all those maps are is kill the other guys And it's real small and you can.

602
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,490
Scott: this is weapons lying on the ground at the start of the map.

603
00:38:59,892 --> 00:39:03,670
Scott: So all you would do is you would start pick up a weapon and go and then it would be over in five seconds.

604
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:07,203
Scott: Yeah And that's why our server was able to run it because it was the simplest map.

605
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:12,140
Rym: now when we made the server Servers that ran those maps weren't that common yet.

606
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:18,350
Rym: So our server was in high demand and full Constantly despite the fact people wanted to play icy world.

607
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:20,799
Scott: Our server was always full and we had a good.

608
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,573
Scott: was a 10 on 10 going on or was an 8 on 8?

609
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,065
Scott: It was a good number for icy world.

610
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:26,630
Scott: I remember that.

611
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,690
Rym: Yeah, the problem was if any if all those people connected the servers ping got real bad.

612
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,163
Scott: No, I remember we set the limit to like the max the server could handle.

613
00:39:35,183 --> 00:39:37,090
Rym: Yeah point which wasn't so much.

614
00:39:37,732 --> 00:39:38,395
Scott: It was good enough.

615
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:39,057
Rym: We had.

616
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:40,904
Rym: we often kick people off so we could play.

617
00:39:40,924 --> 00:39:41,767
Scott: that's true.

618
00:39:41,787 --> 00:39:42,530
Scott: That's true.

619
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:46,810
Scott: It's because we couldn't setting up all the stuff that lets you reserve slots is a pain in the ass.

620
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:52,166
Rym: Yeah, setting up setting up any sort of Counter-Strike server was an incredibly painful process.

621
00:39:52,607 --> 00:40:04,542
Scott: It's less painful now Thanks to steam But it's still to set the mods on the server to make the server do fancy things is still sucky Mostly because it's that was from the previous generation of mods.

622
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:07,090
Rym: I mean playing the old quake 2 mods.

623
00:40:07,752 --> 00:40:20,330
Rym: Try yeah, all of you kids now who played these new games, you know, like Counter-Strike source and natural selection Go find a copy of quake 2 and try to even figure out how to shoot in some of those mods for quake 2.

624
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:25,270
Rym: Yeah, those games you would have to write your own scripts to do anything.

625
00:40:26,097 --> 00:40:27,390
Rym: Yep, those games were nuts.

626
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:35,765
Rym: You really have it easy these days but the servers for a lot of the early half-life 1 mods and Counter-Strike Were about that level of pain in the assness.

627
00:40:35,786 --> 00:40:48,630
Scott: the other problem But really was even when things were easy to do which they often were they were poorly Redocumented and the websites for the software were hard to find because there really weren't official websites for any of these things.

628
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:53,459
Scott: Yeah, they were all other websites You know distributing them and he was all.

629
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:59,741
Scott: it was very hard to find out exactly the latest and greatest Information and the complete information was like a big secret.

630
00:41:00,062 --> 00:41:04,441
Rym: PC gaming is a lot easier now Thanks to the Xbox 360 mostly.

631
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:10,744
Scott: Yeah and steam But yeah, so counter-strike Good memories.

632
00:41:11,127 --> 00:41:19,148
Rym: Yeah I mean when I think back that game It's weird to think that I have so many fond memories from such a simple stupid game, but I played it constantly.

633
00:41:19,168 --> 00:41:22,416
Scott: Yep Let's think of some good counter-strike memories.

634
00:41:23,158 --> 00:41:24,804
Rym: Oh, I remember this one time.

635
00:41:24,824 --> 00:41:34,774
Rym: It was in Kabul and Not Kabul as in Iraq But Kabul as in this place full of cobblestones and I was a terrorist with an ak-47 And I'm walking.

636
00:41:34,794 --> 00:41:35,798
Rym: then Scott was on the server.

637
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,762
Rym: I think he was dead.

638
00:41:36,822 --> 00:41:55,385
Rym: He was watching and I was walking around and For some reason like this is just random because I would just shoot my gun around a lot because I like doing that and I just kind of flipped around and fired a shot off in the distance and then it I saw a headshot from Shazar and I'd gotten someone and then they kicked me off the server for cheating.

639
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:59,386
Rym: Holy crap I don't know what the odds of that were.

640
00:41:59,406 --> 00:42:03,141
Scott: I Had a similar situation on this map.

641
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:04,650
Scott: I forget the name of it.

642
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,415
Scott: Actually, it was it's.

643
00:42:06,655 --> 00:42:11,770
Scott: it was like the Spanish castle or something and it was water and you would run into the castle.

644
00:42:12,191 --> 00:42:12,974
Scott: I don't really remember.

645
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:15,182
Rym: I remember that map and there was a.

646
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,828
Scott: I think there was a sundial somewhere.

647
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:18,636
Rym: Yes Yes, I don't know what it was called.

648
00:42:18,998 --> 00:42:20,787
Rym: Not many servers ran it, but I love that map.

649
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:26,525
Scott: Yeah, and I think we had the bomb planted or I was looking for the bomb.

650
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:27,830
Scott: I remember I was a terrorist.

651
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:33,282
Scott: I wanted to plant the bomb and I was walking around And I had a desert eagle and that was about it.

652
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:46,419
Scott: I had used up everything else and this guy's coming down the stairs and I pretty much turn and fire one shot and his he just falls over dead and I'm like, holy crap And the guy was like lucky shot and I'm like, yup that was.

653
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:59,198
Rym: I've had a lot of moments where it was real dicey like my whole team gets killed and I'm on my own and I got like a pistol and the bomb and Somehow I'd weasel my way through.

654
00:42:59,298 --> 00:43:02,330
Rym: everyone plant the bomb kill a bunch of people go on a rampage.

655
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:08,487
Scott: I have a lot of great moments where My favorite thing to do in counter-strike is to take a clever path through the map.

656
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:12,302
Scott: like an Aztec I would always take the secret stairs, even though it's not so secret anymore.

657
00:43:12,483 --> 00:43:18,150
Scott: No, but and in Assault oil rig I would always go my secret back way.

658
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:24,978
Scott: We're basically no one would be where I was until I made my mad dash for the helicopter you know.

659
00:43:24,998 --> 00:43:28,561
Scott: and Oh, there was also good one in Vegas.

660
00:43:28,783 --> 00:43:30,030
Scott: I would take the back way also.

661
00:43:30,796 --> 00:43:32,529
Scott: That was a good map one time.

662
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:34,430
Rym: This isn't anything awesome.

663
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:42,102
Rym: I did I was playing in I was office and I was the last counter-terrorist alive and the last terrorist was also alive.

664
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:43,108
Rym: who's one versus one?

665
00:43:43,128 --> 00:43:49,630
Rym: and I know that everyone else in the map was watching us because our little fight was going on for a while.

666
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,015
Rym: We were stalking each other around.

667
00:43:51,076 --> 00:43:52,361
Rym: It was unlimited time server.

668
00:43:53,104 --> 00:43:54,730
Rym: So I was stalking, you know, very carefully.

669
00:43:54,830 --> 00:44:02,959
Rym: I had my m4 silenced and I'm poking around and poking around and I Was walking silently and he was walking silently and for minutes and minutes.

670
00:44:02,979 --> 00:44:03,802
Rym: We couldn't find each other.

671
00:44:04,544 --> 00:44:17,610
Rym: So finally I'm walking very slowly and For a while and then I get this feeling and I I turn around and he's standing right there With a knife and he's been standing there and I didn't know what to do.

672
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:18,417
Rym: I would I almost.

673
00:44:18,437 --> 00:44:21,484
Rym: I jumped out of my chair like yeah and then he stabbed me to death.

674
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:31,403
Rym: and Then the voice chat turned on for me for all the dead people and all I heard was them laughing their asses off as they Explained to me that he'd been following me like that for over a minute.

675
00:44:31,846 --> 00:44:36,829
Rym: Yeah And the fact that I was so dumbstruck I couldn't even shoot him.

676
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:46,389
Rym: Yeah, it's a good yeah, like I literally I was like, yeah and I stood up a little bit and it was too late.

677
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,706
Scott: Yeah encounters like you always want to look all over the place real quick all the time.

678
00:44:50,726 --> 00:44:54,925
Scott: Yep You never most of the time when you and you need dying counter-strike.

679
00:44:55,005 --> 00:44:55,909
Scott: It's you shot in the back.

680
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:07,148
Scott: Usually when you you know, you're facing someone the odds of a firefight is pretty much just random But when you just get killed right out, it's in the back of the head.

681
00:45:07,429 --> 00:45:10,629
Rym: Yep I mean playing against people who were a good as we were good.

682
00:45:11,273 --> 00:45:13,967
Rym: it was really just a tactical game of strategy and teamwork.

683
00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:20,050
Rym: and What kind of plan the counter-terrorists would put together to do blah or what route we would take or how we would do it?

684
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,038
Rym: Or what kind of like wave we would move in?

685
00:45:22,198 --> 00:45:22,459
Scott: Yep.

686
00:45:22,499 --> 00:45:32,017
Scott: Strategies would be things like, you know all right, one guy has the para and let's loose and everyone else runs down the tunnel or Everyone go everyone rush left.

687
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:38,862
Scott: every absolutely everyone on the team go left because if you're on the defensive team usually want to have some guys at all.

688
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:55,350
Scott: the different ways that the way the maps are constructed is that you know, the Terrorists start in one area and the counter-terrorists start in another area and there are multiple paths To get from one area to the other and one team is gonna be pushing and one team is gonna be blocking.

689
00:45:55,711 --> 00:46:00,210
Scott: Based on if it's DE the terrorists push and on CS the counter-terrorists push.

690
00:46:01,431 --> 00:46:12,890
Scott: So the defenders usually want to cover all the different entrances because if they leave one Unguarded then there's a chance that all the offensive to the team will just go through that door.

691
00:46:13,091 --> 00:46:15,368
Scott: No one will be there to stop them and they'll win a game over.

692
00:46:16,212 --> 00:46:19,906
Scott: The offensive team wants to have all of their team go to one entrance.

693
00:46:20,307 --> 00:46:27,764
Scott: that way Even there even if there's a few guards at that entrance They'll be able to kill him and still have a whole team.

694
00:46:27,804 --> 00:46:28,508
Scott: They're ready to go.

695
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:33,070
Scott: So, you know this strategy would be like rush left brush middle rush, right?

696
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:34,092
Scott: You know stuff.

697
00:46:34,112 --> 00:46:35,638
Rym: but even then I mean good teams.

698
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,370
Rym: you had the the actual mechanics of all right.

699
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:38,611
Rym: Like.

700
00:46:38,631 --> 00:46:43,754
Rym: well, they'll run in and this guy will sweep to the left and this other guy runs straight forward Not looking at anyone.

701
00:46:43,774 --> 00:46:46,466
Rym: the next two people walk in and throw flashes in this direction.

702
00:46:46,526 --> 00:46:51,445
Scott: plans like that Yep, and then would also be you know defensive strategies that you know.

703
00:46:51,485 --> 00:46:51,626
Scott: you.

704
00:46:51,987 --> 00:46:54,089
Scott: way I described it You think the offense would always win?

705
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:59,730
Scott: But the defense could do things like throw flash grenades as soon as they saw anyone walk through the entrance.

706
00:47:00,171 --> 00:47:06,230
Scott: Then that would be a signal to all the other defenders to get over there as well as completely screwing up the offense.

707
00:47:06,872 --> 00:47:12,050
Scott: Then that you know, they could throw some smoke in there, you know kill the guys at a choke point.

708
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,410
Scott: So even though they're in a big group, they have to walk through the door one at a time.

709
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:17,749
Scott: They all get killed as they walk through the door.

710
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:26,442
Rym: of course a lot of times we play it on servers with people who weren't so good and At that point it became I am Rym aka Rambo.

711
00:47:26,462 --> 00:47:28,970
Rym: I walk around with an mp5 killing everyone.

712
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:33,049
Scott: I see no one can stop me except for the one guy who just stopped you.

713
00:47:33,932 --> 00:47:35,369
Scott: Yeah, you killed a whole bunch of guys.

714
00:47:35,823 --> 00:47:41,123
Rym: Yeah Cuz no matter how good you were One guy could not often take on the entire enemy team.

715
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:46,850
Rym: you could take out most of them But then it really depends on the on the skill of the other team.

716
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:56,510
Scott: they had to be pretty bad to completely lose to you, but in terms of I Could hardly ever kill many guys on the other team if I killed more than four guys in a round.

717
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,273
Scott: That was crazy.

718
00:47:57,334 --> 00:47:59,604
Scott: And in fact three guys is a damn good round.

719
00:47:59,664 --> 00:48:06,230
Scott: help two guys is a good round You know, but often I would win on my own by completing the objective.

720
00:48:06,493 --> 00:48:14,650
Scott: I would go in alone with the bomb I would go around the back way all alone with the terrorists and the hostages and rescue them.

721
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:16,195
Scott: Yeah, rescue the terrorists.

722
00:48:16,235 --> 00:48:23,328
Scott: I'd rescue the hostages all alone, but trying to fight the other team alone was What do you how do you say?

723
00:48:25,815 --> 00:48:27,082
Rym: I don't know how you say what are you trying to?

724
00:48:27,726 --> 00:48:28,209
Scott: fruitless?

725
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,509
Scott: Silly, what's the other word for silly?

726
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,227
Scott: Silly a waste of time.

727
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:37,401
Scott: Feudal.

728
00:48:37,442 --> 00:48:40,995
Scott: it was futile That's the word.

729
00:48:41,578 --> 00:48:43,829
Rym: that's the one futile rare.

730
00:48:44,832 --> 00:48:50,316
