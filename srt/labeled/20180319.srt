00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,858
Rym: It's Monday, March 19th, 2018.

2
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:10,179
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:13,230
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:14,930
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,030
Rym: It's a tech review roundup.

6
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:20,590
Rym: We're reviewing a bunch of technology.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:21,989
Rym: It's not a cop-out.

8
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:23,448
Rym: It's kind of a cop-out.

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,228
Scott: Let's do this.

10
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:31,670
Rym: So it was, uh, almost warm enough to run yesterday outside.

11
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:32,348
Scott: It's cold.

12
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:33,801
Rym: It's chilly.

13
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:34,530
Rym: I went outside.

14
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:36,750
Rym: It was at The Line.

15
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:40,269
Rym: If it had been even one degree colder, I would not have run outside.

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,630
Rym: If it had been even one degree warmer, I would have been a lot more comfortable.

17
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,410
Rym: Basically, I ran, like, eight miles.

18
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:55,288
Rym: And the only reason I didn't run my full distance is if I got in the shade or on streets that were windy, it was too cold.

19
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:59,990
Rym: But if I was in the sun and the wind was not strong, it was very pleasant.

20
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,550
Rym: So as a result, I had to, like, I ran this weird route.

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,869
Rym: Like, I looked at the map on Strava.

22
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:10,209
Rym: You can see me clearly, like, nope on some streets and, like, cross the street to be in the sun.

23
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:12,689
Rym: It just needs to be warm now.

24
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:15,378
Rym: Even though, uh, I think we're getting yet another snowstorm.

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,049
Scott: That's what I heard.

26
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:19,310
Rym: Yeah, meaning maybe I'll go skiing this coming weekend.

27
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,402
Scott: At least I bought a new boot.

28
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:20,868
Scott: My boots...

29
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:24,206
Rym: Oh yeah, your boots, like, the bottom fell off.

30
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:26,730
Scott: It's like, you know, it's the kind where it's all rubber.

31
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:28,970
Scott: And even on the top of your toes, it's rubber.

32
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:32,590
Scott: And then, without even, I was walking and I heard, like, this clicking noise.

33
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:33,095
Scott: I looked down.

34
00:01:33,115 --> 00:01:36,003
Scott: There's literally, like, cracks and giant cracks and holes in them.

35
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:36,770
Scott: And I'm like, what the fuck?

36
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:38,062
Scott: These are expensive.

37
00:01:38,102 --> 00:01:42,109
Scott: And then I remembered, oh, I bought these, like, at my previous job.

38
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:44,086
Scott: When I was working, like, downtown.

39
00:01:44,126 --> 00:01:45,088
Scott: That's how old these are.

40
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:48,470
Scott: So I got new ones on Amazon that are way cozy.

41
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,329
Scott: Zappos that are way cozy.

42
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,034
Rym: Yep, yep.

43
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,356
Scott: Yeah, I'm doing this thing where I'm biking.

44
00:01:53,377 --> 00:01:56,670
Scott: Someone convinced me to do this and I foolishly agreed.

45
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,537
Rym: I think it's a good thing.

46
00:01:57,578 --> 00:02:01,054
Rym: Like, I would, it's cool and I would consider doing it, but I didn't.

47
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,269
Scott: You would not like it.

48
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,258
Rym: Why would I not like it?

49
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:09,253
Scott: Because you are the kind of person who likes to do athletic things in a fast way.

50
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:09,354
Scott: Yeah.

51
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:12,387
Scott: And in an individual freewheeling way.

52
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:15,780
Rym: I do like very organized intense activity.

53
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,135
Rym: Like, I run races and everything.

54
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:22,810
Scott: I think it's sort of weird because I think what the problem is, is, like, there's all these different levels of groups, right?

55
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,234
Scott: Yeah.

56
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,890
Scott: So the group that I'm in is basically, like, a bunch of old people.

57
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:30,647
Scott: We're all like doop doop doop doop doop doop doop.

58
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:32,088
Scott: It's all relaxing.

59
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,910
Scott: Some of the other people are huffing and puffing, but I'm not.

60
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,840
Scott: I'm just like doop doop doop.

61
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:42,344
Scott: And then, like, the A group, which is all, like, you know, the Lance Armstrong type dudes.

62
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:46,790
Scott: I think that, like, it's like, you're faster than me because you're all trying to be athletic.

63
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,980
Rym: But I'm not as fast as them.

64
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,930
Scott: No, you would not, I don't know if you would be able to stay with them, right?

65
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:52,508
Scott: So it's like, you know.

66
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,414
Rym: Well, I mean, there was a time.

67
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:58,449
Scott: They're all, like, whoosh and you're all like with your hybrid bike.

68
00:02:59,356 --> 00:02:59,619
Rym: Yeah.

69
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:02,409
Rym: The real problem is I'm aerodynamically limited by that bike.

70
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:03,089
Scott: Yeah.

71
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:08,689
Scott: So, yeah, a bike in ten weeks in a row and I'm only allowed to miss two times.

72
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,709
Scott: If I miss more than two times, they kick me out.

73
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:13,290
Scott: So I'm missing packs no matter what, obviously.

74
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:13,652
Rym: Yup.

75
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:14,950
Rym: Meaning you can't miss anymore.

76
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,049
Scott: Well, I can miss one more, but I can't miss any more than that.

77
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,413
Scott: So it's like I could go to Passover with my family, but then oh no.

78
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:24,928
Scott: Then I really can't.

79
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,798
Scott: I'm having big trouble.

80
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:28,303
Scott: And so I don't know about that.

81
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:33,090
Scott: So, but yeah, I'm biking in the cold and even with See, this is what I don't understand.

82
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,998
Rym: You say it was cold.

83
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:40,282
Rym: That day, like if I had gone biking, it would have been shorts and like two layers on top.

84
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:46,349
Scott: No, I wore, so two Saturdays in a row, I've been biking and I've worn, like, thermal pants thingies.

85
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,303
Scott: The warmest socks.

86
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:50,787
Rym: I biked to Radagast on Saturday last weekend.

87
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:51,715
Rym: I didn't even wear gloves.

88
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:53,350
Scott: The warmest socks I could find.

89
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:58,963
Scott: and then I put in these toe warmer things that you open the packet and it's like, ah, right.

90
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,247
Rym: And then I don't like those things.

91
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,065
Rym: Actually, those things can be dangerous in winter sports.

92
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:06,318
Scott: You follow the instructions anyway.

93
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:06,641
Scott: No, no.

94
00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:07,732
Rym: So the reason they can be dangerous.

95
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:10,518
Scott: And then I had covers that go over my shoes for the front.

96
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:11,530
Rym: Oh, I've seen those things.

97
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,669
Scott: But one of them, one of them interfered with my cleats.

98
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,788
Scott: I only had it on one foot.

99
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,370
Scott: I got a really crap cheapo ones at Amazon.

100
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:19,228
Scott: I got to get the ones that are full boot shape.

101
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:20,379
Rym: So you had a hot foot, cold foot.

102
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:23,130
Scott: No, it actually, they didn't really help that much.

103
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:25,289
Scott: They were sort of a bad purchase.

104
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,658
Scott: They didn't work too well.

105
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:30,481
Rym: I can see how they would work for, cause like my, I think everyone else had the full foot ones.

106
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:31,250
Scott: I think those were much better.

107
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,670
Rym: Cause my bike shoes actually are, to say that they are not insulated is an understatement.

108
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,009
Scott: Mine are not insulated and they have big vents in them.

109
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:38,392
Rym: Yep.

110
00:04:38,453 --> 00:04:41,284
Rym: It's almost like my foot is just bare in the wind.

111
00:04:41,304 --> 00:04:41,910
Scott: Yes, exactly.

112
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:47,265
Scott: But anyway, and then I had like three layers on top and then two hats.

113
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:48,538
Rym: It wasn't that cold, Scott.

114
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:50,862
Scott: And then I had hand warmers and two gloves.

115
00:04:50,943 --> 00:04:51,550
Rym: Hand warmers?

116
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,597
Scott: Two gloves on each hand.

117
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,214
Rym: I don't even use hand warmers skiing.

118
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:59,190
Scott: And meanwhile, my fingers were like freezing even though my hand was warm because of the hand warmers.

119
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,070
Rym: What are you going to be like when you're 90?

120
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,313
Scott: But then...

121
00:05:02,354 --> 00:05:04,468
Rym: You're just going to be like wrapped around a heat lamp?

122
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:07,029
Rym: Like a lizard never moving?

123
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:11,347
Scott: At lunchtime my fingers thawed, but I was still cold even when I got home.

124
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,761
Rym: Yo Scott, on that day I biked to Radagast on a city bike without even wearing gloves.

125
00:05:16,802 --> 00:05:17,510
Scott: Yeah, what time?

126
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:19,990
Rym: Like 10?

127
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,852
Scott: Yeah, well I started biking at 7.

128
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:24,217
Rym: Yeah, at 7 it was only 4 degrees colder.

129
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,010
Scott: It was way cold.

130
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,664
Rym: Maybe 5 degrees colder.

131
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:27,230
Scott: Everyone was cold.

132
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:27,693
Scott: It was freezing.

133
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:31,110
Rym: Yeah, but were some people in your group wearing shorts?

134
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:32,014
Scott: No.

135
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:32,440
Rym: No?

136
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:32,966
Rym: None at all?

137
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:33,189
Scott: No.

138
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:34,308
Scott: They're old people.

139
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,910
Rym: Were there people in other groups wearing shorts?

140
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:37,796
Rym: No.

141
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:38,343
Rym: No one?

142
00:05:38,363 --> 00:05:38,404
Rym: No.

143
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:43,210
Scott: Even the A people had like gone, you know because everyone there has all kinds of equipment.

144
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,337
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

145
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:52,479
Rym: I do have some heights I can wear in that kind of situation, but I usually only wear those if I'm doing like a long distance runner bike.

146
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:54,360
Scott: Well we went to Scarsdale and Bank.

147
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,390
Rym: Oh, that's a pretty good ride.

148
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,024
Rym: So yeah, anyway, the deal with the show, we'll do the news.

149
00:05:59,085 --> 00:06:01,430
Rym: first, is we're going to review a bunch of technology that we've bought.

150
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,750
Rym: A wide array of different kinds of technology.

151
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,148
Scott: Actual electronic devices.

152
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:09,390
Rym: And we're not reviewing anything about them except their technological capabilities.

153
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,729
Rym: So before that, there is actually a bunch of news.

154
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:16,730
Rym: So my news is that this made the news.

155
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:23,920
Rym: For the first time, as far as anyone can tell, a self-driving car that was driving itself.

156
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,497
Scott: So a robot with wheels.

157
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:26,690
Scott: Yep, a robot with wheels.

158
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,477
Scott: A wheeled robot.

159
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,327
Rym: Well, no, no, no, no.

160
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:30,950
Rym: Wheeled robots have killed a shit ton of people.

161
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:33,981
Scott: Well, how is a self-driving car not just a wheeled robot?

162
00:06:34,122 --> 00:06:38,586
Rym: Because a self-driving car is a wheeled robot using public transportation infrastructure.

163
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,790
Scott: So I took a wheeled robot from a factory and just put it out on the road.

164
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:41,739
Scott: That's the same fucking thing.

165
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:43,091
Rym: You can't do that though.

166
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,364
Rym: Wheeled robots in factories.

167
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:45,542
Scott: Stop me, I'll just do it.

168
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:48,063
Rym: It'd be a lot like bumper cars.

169
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:48,729
Rym: They just couldn't go.

170
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:57,350
Rym: They actually rely on telemetry or cables to follow or QR code type signs everywhere.

171
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:06,205
Rym: I have worked in places where there were those kinds of robots and they were very, very dangerous to be around.

172
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:06,670
Scott: You don't say.

173
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:08,768
Rym: Wow, that was a long time ago.

174
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,930
Rym: There were some that weren't that dangerous to be around.

175
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,658
Rym: There were these big, uh, imagine a lame talkie talkie.

176
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:15,213
Scott: They just gave you a nice hug like, "Hey, how you

177
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:15,374
Scott: doing?".

178
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:22,060
Rym: They'd be like rolling along, puttering along, and if you're in their way, they'd stop and they'd just have this really cute voice that said, "Please move.

179
00:07:22,202 --> 00:07:22,909
Rym: You're blocking me.

180
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:24,100
Rym: Please move.

181
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:24,870
Rym: You're blocking

182
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:25,153
Rym: me.".

183
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:25,940
Scott: What if I just block it?

184
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:27,981
Rym: They would just keep saying that forever.

185
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:29,358
Scott: Move the tram car.

186
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:29,929
Scott: Watch the tram car.

187
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:31,088
Rym: Watch the tram car.

188
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:41,090
Rym: So an autonomous passenger vehicle on a public road hit and killed a pedestrian.

189
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:44,262
Scott: Was the pedestrian disobeying the light?

190
00:07:44,322 --> 00:07:51,809
Rym: They were crossing the street outside of a crosswalk, so they were jaywalking as far as the investigation has determined.

191
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:54,990
Rym: There's a lot of things to talk about.

192
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:57,939
Rym: The details of this accident are not that interesting.

193
00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:00,202
Rym: It's an Uber car that happened to do it.

194
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:02,061
Scott: Well, those are the shittiest ones of all of them, right?

195
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:02,910
Rym: I don't know what technology.

196
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,009
Scott: That's what I've heard is that the Uber ones are the worst ones.

197
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:06,745
Scott: The Google ones are way better.

198
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,341
Scott: Actually, I heard the Apple ones are the worst.

199
00:08:08,684 --> 00:08:10,550
Scott: Uber is the second worst and the Google ones are the best.

200
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:17,777
Rym: I don't want to get into those details, but Uber's response was to suspend all self-driving car testing across the board.

201
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:18,021
Rym: Good.

202
00:08:18,102 --> 00:08:18,468
Scott: Fuck you, Uber.

203
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:19,936
Scott: Uber's evil.

204
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:20,624
Scott: Let Google do it.

205
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,696
Rym: Irrespective of this.

206
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:24,748
Scott: If a Google car and an Uber car come down the street, which one am I getting in?

207
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:26,363
Rym: Which one are you vandalizing?

208
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:27,784
Scott: The one that has Google Maps, right?

209
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:32,950
Rym: The interesting thing is that this made the news everywhere.

210
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:33,515
Scott: Of course.

211
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:35,496
Rym: Self-driving car killed a person.

212
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:38,830
Scott: How many people were killed by human-driven cars today?

213
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:40,260
Rym: Today.

214
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,164
Rym: Today, more than one person was killed by a human-driven car.

215
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:44,630
Scott: Yeah.

216
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:46,430
Rym: Not an AI, just an eye.

217
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:49,133
Scott: Well, hopefully an eye.

218
00:08:49,173 --> 00:09:00,610
Rym: I stand by my strong belief that the current level of kind of shitty self-driving car is better than the average human driver.

219
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:02,607
Rym: I'm pretty confident that is...

220
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:12,227
Scott: People seem to argue against this because the limitations of the current self-driving car technology means it only works in a few scenarios and stuff like that, but it's like...

221
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,094
Rym: In those scenarios, humans regularly kill each other.

222
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:15,660
Scott: Right.

223
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:22,870
Rym: Like, in the controlled environment, slow driving in easy cities, people get hit all the fucking time.

224
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:23,212
Scott: Right.

225
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:41,090
Scott: So, the main thing I brought to this point many times, and I just keep bringing it up again, is that people are gonna... They're so horrified of the self-driving car killing someone, which it did, which is gonna happen, but people are gonna, like, insist that the self-driving car be 100% safe before they let it go out on the road.

226
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,133
Rym: I'm fine with that if we insist that human drivers have to be 100% safe.

227
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:57,236
Scott: Sure, that's true, but the point is, as long as they're at least even marginally safer than a human driver, statistically, that means using them instead of humans will only save lives.

228
00:09:57,417 --> 00:10:03,759
Scott: Every single human you take off the road and self-driving car you put on the road is probably saving some fraction of a human life.

229
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:17,174
Scott: Therefore, if they are safer, even only marginally so, which means they will still kill people, they'll just kill less people than humans, then we have a moral obligation to deploy them as much as we possibly can.

230
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:31,718
Rym: With the caveat that there is a cold calculus of the cost and resources of deploying them and masks like that might take away from the resources spent on other initiatives around, like, healthcare, for example.

231
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:35,635
Scott: Right, well, the resources of the whole world are deployed, right?

232
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:40,729
Scott: Yeah, but no, your point You can't bring the game of civilization into this one area of the car.

233
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:59,619
Rym: But I'm saying there is a cold calculus there, but that, not getting into that, like, overarching and kind of pointless argument, on this low level, humans are terrible at cars, and the sheer number of humans killed by cars on a daily basis is terrifying.

234
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:01,193
Scott: I want to renew my driver's license.

235
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:02,325
Scott: I got the fanciest one.

236
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:03,719
Rym: I got the fanciest one as well.

237
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:06,997
Rym: They didn't mail it to me yet, but, uh, I got mine, like, a little while ago.

238
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:15,697
Scott: Alright, the, what was required to renew the license after eight years of basically not driving was laughable.

239
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:16,690
Scott: Yeah, so I didn't even have to take it.

240
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:21,778
Scott: It was an eye chart that was maybe like five feet behind the person I was talking to.

241
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:25,170
Rym: An eye chart that is the same everywhere, and you could have memorized.

242
00:11:26,113 --> 00:11:29,495
Scott: And he said, "Read the top line," and it was humongous letters.

243
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:30,163
Scott: Yep.

244
00:11:30,244 --> 00:11:30,629
Scott: I read it.

245
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,899
Scott: Look, I can- That was it.

246
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:33,737
Scott: They didn't test my driving at all.

247
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:34,767
Rym: I'm legally blind.

248
00:11:34,787 --> 00:11:38,466
Rym: Like, I'm not in the sense that I'm not allowed to drive a car without my glasses.

249
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,020
Rym: Like, I have real bad vision.

250
00:11:40,464 --> 00:11:45,784
Rym: Despite that, if I take my glasses off and squint, I can still read the top fucking line.

251
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:46,069
Scott: Yep.

252
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:55,657
Rym: Uh, when I first got my New York State driver's license, they made me take the written test, even though I already had a driver's license.

253
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:57,212
Rym: Like, they made me take the written test, so I took it.

254
00:11:58,142 --> 00:11:58,769
Scott: I didn't have to do that.

255
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:08,344
Rym: I am of the mind that a human being who fails to get a perfect score on that test should never be allowed to drive ever.

256
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:08,890
Scott: I agree.

257
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,442
Rym: That test was questions like, "What do you do at a red

258
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:12,785
Rym: light?".

259
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:13,473
Scott: Mm-hmm.

260
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:14,750
Rym: Yep.

261
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:18,345
Scott: I think the most- Who has the right of way at this four-way intersection?

262
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,610
Rym: This really simple and contrived scenario.

263
00:12:21,353 --> 00:12:21,818
Rym: Mm-hmm.

264
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:38,003
Rym: I think the most difficult question on the entire test was if you're turning left on an intersection that has a left-turn lane, and there's multiple lanes you could get into on the road you're turning onto, which lane are you obligated to get into if there's only one turning

265
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:38,185
Scott: lane?

266
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:38,609
Scott: The closest one.

267
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:39,860
Rym: The closest one to what?

268
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:47,517
Scott: Well, I mean, if you're in the leftmost lane, you're gonna- So, I'm gonna say- So, say I'm going forward- You're gonna end up in the five-lane road.

269
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:50,146
Rym: Two lanes going one way, two going the other way, suicide lane in the middle.

270
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:50,530
Rym: Okay.

271
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,769
Rym: I'm turning left from the suicide lane onto another five-lane road.

272
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:56,109
Rym: Into which lane do I pull?

273
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:58,530
Scott: Uh, the one to the right of the suicide lane?

274
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,236
Scott: You are correct.

275
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:00,650
Rym: That was the answer.

276
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:03,357
Rym: That was the most difficult question on the test.

277
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,808
Rym: I had to think about it for a second as opposed to no seconds.

278
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:15,250
Rym: But this story is going to reverberate Black Mirror-style forever.

279
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:27,462
Rym: And I am not confident that a human in the same situation would have changed the outcome of this person's, uh, misadventure, shall we say.

280
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:31,426
Rym: Pretty confident a human driving this car would have hit this person the same way.

281
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:44,590
Rym: Especially because there was a human in the car with a steering wheel, gas, and brakes whose sole job was to sit in the car and intervene if the car seemed to be missing something.

282
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,429
Rym: And that person did not, in fact, hit the brakes.

283
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:50,309
Rym: So, uh, you got any news?

284
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:51,619
Scott: I do have news.

285
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:57,801
Scott: So the big news that's going on right now, uh, is this Facebook something story that everyone doesn't know what's going on.

286
00:13:57,841 --> 00:13:59,337
Rym: There's a lot of pieces to it.

287
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,459
Scott: I could explain this story real easy, right?

288
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:08,973
Scott: There was a professor in the UK, and this professor made a Facebook app that was sort of like a cute little questionnaire kind of app.

289
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:16,629
Scott: It wasn't really a big deal, but when people went and signed up to use it in those days, wait, years ago, they clicked, like, "Yes, I agree.

290
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:19,337
Scott: I give you permissions to get data from my Facebook account.

291
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:19,782
Scott: Yes, yes,

292
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:20,105
Scott: yes.".

293
00:14:20,206 --> 00:14:23,456
Scott: And now that app collected all this data from people's Facebook accounts.

294
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:23,962
Rym: Yep.

295
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:24,770
Scott: When it was active.

296
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:37,439
Scott: So, nowadays, if you were to make a Facebook app, Facebook would not allow you to make an app that collected the amount of information that app collected in those days, uh, because they become much more restrictive.

297
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,964
Rym: So a legacy app from the wild west.

298
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:44,230
Scott: So, that app was gone, but the professor still had that data from that project.

299
00:14:45,050 --> 00:15:02,085
Scott: That professor then breaking, uh, basically in direct contradiction with the Facebook terms of service and the privacy policy that users agreed to when they, you know, with Facebook, gave that data, or sold it to a company in the UK called Cambridge Analytica.

300
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:08,754
Rym: Now, it's worth noting that the EU, at least, has very strict rules around personal data.

301
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:10,108
Rym: Way more strict than the US.

302
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,209
Scott: Well, this is the UK, which is only sort of in the EU.

303
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:18,873
Rym: Yes, the UK, however, also does have very strict laws and regulations around personal information.

304
00:15:18,893 --> 00:15:30,753
Scott: Anyway, anyway, so the point is Cambridge Analytica had this data, and Cambridge Analytica was a company that, uh, used its data to help, uh, win the US election for the current president.

305
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:31,258
Rym: Yes.

306
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:35,444
Rym: Who is, if you're not in America and don't know the difference, is literally evil.

307
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:35,868
Rym: Yes.

308
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:37,889
Rym: Like, we're in a real bad situation because of this.

309
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:46,089
Scott: Anyway, so, but, this is like, so people who gave their data to Facebook and said yes to this still did not agree to this.

310
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:46,937
Scott: Yup.

311
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:47,221
Scott: Right?

312
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:58,314
Scott: It's like, their data was used by a third party from Facebook in a way that the users did not agree to have it used, uh, and Facebook is like, no, it wasn't a theft.

313
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,109
Scott: It was a, you know, basically a fraud.

314
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,399
Rym: Yeah.

315
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:15,787
Scott: Uh, so now there's all kinds of investigations and all kinds of hoo-ha, and Facebook is taking a big hit, and I saw some tweets that were like, why is Facebook people going to Cambridge Analytica before the authorities get there?

316
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:16,090
Scott: I don't know.

317
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,465
Scott: That could just be a sensational tweet.

318
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:17,870
Scott: Who knows?

319
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,412
Rym: Yup.

320
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:25,765
Rym: I've seen, I've seen a lot of interesting implications around who really drove this use of the data and where the data was actually used.

321
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:26,856
Scott: But was the professor up to?

322
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:30,777
Scott: He's just a professor doing a research project and then sells or gives his data to some other company.

323
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:35,522
Rym: There's a whistleblower involved who seems to, oh, there's a really good sentence in this article.

324
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:44,109
Scott: One of the professor's assistants was, is actually, uh, they discovered is a Facebook employee now, and they're investigating that, what that person's up to.

325
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:49,889
Rym: I'm going to wait to, uh, quote, I'm going to quote two short paragraphs from this, uh, Guardian article I'm going to link to for this.

326
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:57,140
Rym: Uh, the Observer Report contradicts Cambridge Analytica's chief executive who said the company did not have Facebook data.

327
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,646
Rym: Mm-hmm.

328
00:16:58,031 --> 00:17:04,169
Rym: Facebook waited more than two years after they discovered the breach before suspending Cambridge Analytica.

329
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,861
Rym: It's not a breach, though.

330
00:17:04,882 --> 00:17:05,228
Rym: It's not a breach.

331
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:17,665
Rym: Uh, Cambridge Analytica has denied inappropriate use of Facebook user profiles, comma, but a former employee who is now a whistleblower has emphatically contradicted that claim.

332
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:18,028
Rym: Mm-hmm.

333
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:37,644
Rym: There's a, the real issue here, like if you want to take away from this, is that understanding improper uses of personal data is nearly impossible, and the complexity of prosecuting it, getting any sort of recourse from it, this is going to tie up the courts for so long that I don't want to speculate.

334
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:38,150
Scott: At least the UK courts.

335
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,073
Scott: Yeah.

336
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:45,922
Scott: Anyway, the point is, as we've said on GeekNights many, many times, probably since the beginning of GeekNights, there are zeros and ones.

337
00:17:46,064 --> 00:18:00,775
Scott: Any data that can be turned into zeros and ones will be, and any data that has become zeros and ones, once it is shared in a non-encrypted way, can and will be shared infinitely with no control by you, the law can't stop anyone.

338
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:08,310
Rym: A control around data that is a EULA, a contract or a promise means basically nothing.

339
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:19,629
Scott: For the same exact reason you can't keep an MP3 from spreading everyone and force them to buy your CD, the same exact rules apply, you can't keep everyone from sharing your phone number.

340
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:20,392
Rym: Yep.

341
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:21,247
Rym: So what do you do?

342
00:18:22,363 --> 00:18:33,610
Rym: Pure opinion, I think we do need a better and more nuanced regulatory framework around, if data is used in improper ways, ways to punish the people who so use.

343
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,190
Scott: It will only work against people who are punishable, large corporations.

344
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:37,832
Rym: Yep.

345
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:53,249
Rym: Another part of this would be, if it is, if data usage like this is used for, say, evil political things or espionage type things, then CIA, FBI should probably come down with a heavy hammer.

346
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,869
Rym: People should go to jail, extraditions.

347
00:18:57,217 --> 00:19:02,701
Rym: Probably the most important one, don't give stodgy apps permission to use your data.

348
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:15,310
Scott: Yeah, also don't trust, you know, when you trust people, right, human beings, if I give Rym, if I tell Rym something, you know, even if he promises to keep it a secret, I'm now trusting Rym not to spread that to the entire universe.

349
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,399
Rym: And if I share it with someone else, Scott is now transitively trusting everyone I trusted.

350
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:21,954
Scott: Yes, this is how the world works.

351
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:23,289
Scott: You cannot avoid this.

352
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:27,429
Scott: You should opt to keep your data secret rather than share it.

353
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:33,995
Scott: Even your most loved and most close person on Earth, you should not tell them your password or anything ever.

354
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:34,298
Rym: Yep.

355
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:36,681
Rym: Now, even now, like we have, so I will tell them.

356
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:37,933
Scott: Unless you're dead, then you can tell them.

357
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:45,855
Rym: We have a giant new NAS, which we're going to talk about in the second half of the show, but for, we are both administrators of it.

358
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:52,623
Rym: So theoretically, we could go, like, I could just go, like, reset the password for her shares and, like, get into them or, like, do troubleshooting.

359
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:57,489
Rym: But the actual accounts we use day to day do not have shared access.

360
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:01,490
Rym: So even that thin barrier is better than nothing.

361
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:16,113
Rym: Like, separate and if you have shared resources, like, Scott and I have some shared things we administer, but wherever possible, even though we could both, like, do things to screw over the other person, the day to day accounts we use are separate.

362
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:24,618
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

363
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:25,449
Rym: What do you got for me?

364
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:27,445
Scott: Uh, what did I have for you?

365
00:20:27,465 --> 00:20:28,556
Rym: Uh, you don't remember this?

366
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:30,070
Scott: I'm trying to remember what my thing of day.

367
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,488
Scott: Oh, I do remember what my thing of day was.

368
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,516
Scott: So this is an old school thing of day from way back.

369
00:20:34,596 --> 00:20:37,262
Scott: You know, it's not actually old, like it's not being used again.

370
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,231
Scott: But it's the kind of thing.

371
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,484
Scott: It's the kind of thing of the day that we would use in the early days of GeekNights.

372
00:20:41,524 --> 00:20:43,329
Scott: and I saw this and I said, man, that brings you back.

373
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,970
Scott: This is a ball of matches.

374
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:47,726
Scott: The matches that set on fire.

375
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,674
Scott: They used to light a candle.

376
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:49,098
Rym: 42,000 of them.

377
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:54,514
Scott: 42,000 matches with, like, green at the end of them, which looks cool like green.

378
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,524
Scott: And someone made a perfect sphere of these matches.

379
00:20:57,544 --> 00:20:59,242
Scott: And then they lit that baby up.

380
00:20:59,343 --> 00:20:59,868
Rym: Oh, yeah.

381
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:05,321
Rym: There was an entire genre of pre YouTube video and early YouTube video.

382
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:09,950
Rym: that was basically what would happen if you did this really inadvisable thing?

383
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,878
Rym: Here's a video.

384
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:12,879
Rym: Usually it ended with someone getting hurt.

385
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:15,910
Rym: No one gets hurt in this video except the matches, I guess.

386
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:17,409
Rym: And it looks really cool.

387
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,536
Rym: It's a pretty good thing.

388
00:21:19,183 --> 00:21:21,203
Rym: I got a similarly low rent thing of the day.

389
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:25,201
Rym: So this is just a very short scene from Rick and Morty.

390
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:26,414
Rym: Like, nothing special there.

391
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:31,423
Rym: Except someone has edited and replaced an object.

392
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:33,629
Rym: that is the center of this very short scene.

393
00:21:34,472 --> 00:21:38,970
Rym: Whatever that object was is immaterial because they replaced it with a Bitcoin.

394
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:49,210
Rym: And as a result this scene, this short 30 second clip summarizes basically every feeling I have about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

395
00:21:50,071 --> 00:21:54,670
Rym: In the moment, the booklet book is Emily Wilson's translation of Homer's Odyssey.

396
00:21:56,818 --> 00:21:57,829
Rym: Have you read any of it yet?

397
00:21:58,352 --> 00:22:00,617
Scott: I read the same amount that I read last time.

398
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:01,970
Rym: You haven't even met Telemachus?

399
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,768
Scott: No, but I know who that is.

400
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,482
Scott: Odysseus' son.

401
00:22:05,582 --> 00:22:06,269
Rym: What's he do?

402
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:07,765
Rym: Do you remember what he does?

403
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:08,676
Scott: He looks for his dad.

404
00:22:08,717 --> 00:22:11,583
Scott: He goes around to like all these people saying, "Yo, where's Odysseus

405
00:22:11,603 --> 00:22:11,644
Scott: at?".

406
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:17,250
Rym: I'm starting to realize that almost everyone we know read the Odyssey in high school.

407
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,850
Rym: And I'm pretty sure almost every high school.

408
00:22:20,477 --> 00:22:20,942
Rym: really you didn't.

409
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:23,244
Scott: There was a mythology class.

410
00:22:23,284 --> 00:22:23,910
Scott: I did not take it.

411
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,514
Scott: I took other classes instead.

412
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,889
Rym: We just did this in literature class.

413
00:22:28,693 --> 00:22:30,090
Scott: We had choices of classes.

414
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,598
Scott: I took sci-fi class and I took Shakespeare class.

415
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:37,690
Rym: 9th grade, we read basically all the Greek tragedies and the Odyssey.

416
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,085
Scott: I took public speaking class.

417
00:22:39,105 --> 00:22:40,097
Scott: I took all these different classes.

418
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:41,209
Scott: I didn't take the mythology one.

419
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,078
Rym: That wasn't mythology.

420
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:42,810
Rym: That was just literature.

421
00:22:43,391 --> 00:22:44,870
Rym: Antigone was just part of literature.

422
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,705
Scott: We didn't have a literature class.

423
00:22:46,745 --> 00:22:47,290
Scott: We had choices.

424
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:49,143
Rym: We had those too.

425
00:22:49,224 --> 00:22:53,895
Rym: I could have taken a dedicated Shakespeare class, but regular English class, you read a Shakespeare every year.

426
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:56,520
Scott: We didn't have just English class.

427
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:58,398
Scott: After 9th grade.

428
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:01,149
Rym: We just had English every year and then 12th grade was...

429
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,170
Scott: I took hippie literature class.

430
00:23:04,095 --> 00:23:06,470
Scott: 12th grade was all kinds of anti-war abuse.

431
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,549
Rym: AP English.

432
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:20,047
Rym: So anyway, but I get the impression that almost everyone we know who read the Odyssey in high school, they started them with the Odysseus part and just skipped the entire actual beginning of the Odyssey.

433
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:23,866
Rym: because the Odyssey begins with Telemachus wondering where his dad went.

434
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:27,216
Rym: You don't even meet Odysseus until well into the Odyssey.

435
00:23:27,237 --> 00:23:31,115
Rym: You get this cutaway to like, "What was Odysseus up to during all

436
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:31,357
Rym: this?".

437
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,801
Rym: So it's real good and I want to do the show on it kind of soon.

438
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:40,049
Scott: I just keep the meta real short because the main meta is that PAX East is fucking soon.

439
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:41,890
Scott: Soon as fuck.

440
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,450
Rym: I made significant changes to our panel.

441
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,508
Scott: And not only is it fucking soon, it's fucking four fucking days.

442
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,390
Rym: Meaning, we gotta show up on Wednesday.

443
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,414
Rym: There is pre-Pax Gaming.

444
00:23:55,455 --> 00:23:59,436
Rym: If you show up on Wednesday, there is official sanctioned.

445
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:02,001
Rym: sit down in a space that is organized for this.

446
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:05,520
Scott: God damn Hump Day and you're already at PAX that night gaming.

447
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:12,530
Rym: We're gonna be playing Quartermaster General with like drinks and snacks in a tabletop gaming area on Wednesday.

448
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:18,229
Scott: And Thursday while everyone's at freaking work and all these Bostonians are gonna be commuting, we're gonna be Paxing right next to them.

449
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,619
Rym: Yep, Kino Q&A.

450
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:20,890
Rym: Friday, same.

451
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,270
Scott: Saturday, same.

452
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,862
Rym: Sunday, the finale.

453
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:24,939
Rym: And then Monday, I'm going home.

454
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,067
Rym: I don't know what I'm gonna do.

455
00:24:28,128 --> 00:24:31,759
Rym: Like, let's see, I get four days of East, four days of West.

456
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:32,649
Rym: That's eight days.

457
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,853
Rym: Eleven when you add in South.

458
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:38,027
Rym: Fourteen if you add in unplugged.

459
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,909
Rym: Sixteen if I add in dev.

460
00:24:40,571 --> 00:24:42,010
Rym: I go to a lot of Paxes.

461
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,449
Scott: You basically spend half a month a year at Paxes.

462
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:45,783
Rym: I don't know what to do about this.

463
00:24:45,803 --> 00:24:47,543
Scott: Half a month to a month of every year.

464
00:24:47,564 --> 00:24:49,546
Scott: It's like one twenty-fourth of every year.

465
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:53,339
Rym: This, friends and fans of GeekNights, is why That doesn't count.

466
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,230
Scott: Magfest also.

467
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,339
Scott: That's only the Paxes.

468
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,349
Rym: Which is also four days.

469
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:01,380
Scott: We basically spend like a one-twelfth, almost one-twelfth of our lives at Paxes.

470
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:14,323
Rym: So if you asked us to show up at a convention that you like, or you are a convention and you've emailed us over the years and asked us to come, that is why we either just don't respond, or when we do respond, we usually say,

471
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:14,847
Rym: "Sorry.".

472
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:15,779
Scott: Anyway.

473
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:17,802
Rym: So, yeah, come see us at Pax East.

474
00:25:17,823 --> 00:25:18,410
Rym: It's gonna be awesome.

475
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:23,096
Rym: And on Sunday, at ten thirty AM, we're gonna be doing a panel that we only did once before.

476
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:24,469
Rym: We tried it out at Magfest at work.

477
00:25:24,812 --> 00:25:25,539
Rym: Now it's legit.

478
00:25:25,862 --> 00:25:28,789
Rym: Clickbait title, non-clickbait content.

479
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,928
Rym: So let's get right into it.

480
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,649
Rym: Scott had this idea, and it's actually a pretty good idea, because we buy a lot of technology.

481
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,398
Scott: We probably shouldn't.

482
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:43,175
Rym: But what we haven't done on GeekNights, really, is do episodes reviewing technology.

483
00:25:43,195 --> 00:25:47,499
Rym: Like, I haven't, like, reviewed the ten eighty that I bought, like the particular one.

484
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:48,590
Scott: It's a video card.

485
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,640
Scott: What's there to review about it?

486
00:25:50,186 --> 00:25:52,912
Rym: Ah, price per dollar, like, or, not price per dollar.

487
00:25:52,932 --> 00:25:54,690
Scott: It's rather different from any other ten eighty.

488
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,730
Rym: Price per, like, performance.

489
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:59,762
Rym: I could've spent more to get, like, an overclocked one.

490
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:04,690
Scott: It has HDMI out and a DisplayPort out and it works, and it plays games fast.

491
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,068
Scott: And it renders the video.

492
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:10,630
Rym: For most people, it is overkill, even if you're a crazy gamer.

493
00:26:11,651 --> 00:26:16,149
Rym: Like, if I didn't edit video all the time, I actually would've gotten a ten seventy instead.

494
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,304
Rym: But, uh, anyway.

495
00:26:18,547 --> 00:26:21,760
Scott: I'd have a ten eighty, but I have a ten seventy because of the problems.

496
00:26:21,941 --> 00:26:26,264
Rym: So I have a ten eighty because I bought my video card before the troubles.

497
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:28,425
Scott: Yeah, but the ten seventy's actually not causing me any troubles.

498
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:29,577
Scott: Now I'm thinking like, "Hey, you know

499
00:26:29,597 --> 00:26:29,759
Scott: what?".

500
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:33,253
Scott: I was like, "Man, I should buy a video card for the HDPC because I took the ten seventy out of

501
00:26:33,314 --> 00:26:33,374
Scott: it.".

502
00:26:33,395 --> 00:26:34,285
Rym: Just do the Steam stream.

503
00:26:34,305 --> 00:26:34,670
Rym: Hold out.

504
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,719
Scott: But now I'm like, "You know what?

505
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,192
Scott: I just won't buy a video card for that.

506
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:39,269
Scott: I'll Steam stream only and, um...".

507
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,205
Rym: Wait, and then eventually, maybe, buy, like, the twelve eighty.

508
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:42,367
Rym: Yeah.

509
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,122
Rym: Put it in your regular computer.

510
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:45,415
Scott: Cascade's the old ten seventy.

511
00:26:45,435 --> 00:26:46,730
Scott: The ten seventy's plenty good for me.

512
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,082
Scott: I'll just hold, stay put.

513
00:26:48,224 --> 00:26:53,883
Rym: Yeah, so I got a ten eighty here and I got a four sixty in the HDPC.

514
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,344
Scott: I got an integrated one in the HDPC.

515
00:26:56,385 --> 00:26:57,334
Scott: My HDPC's way newer.

516
00:26:57,778 --> 00:26:59,454
Rym: Yeah, my HDPC is from early 2009.

517
00:26:59,454 --> 00:27:01,675
Scott: Mine's from, like, less than a year ago.

518
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:04,383
Rym: So what we're gonna try out here is we're gonna review... Maybe it's a year old.

519
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,069
Scott: Maybe it's older now.

520
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:18,304
Rym: We're gonna review, in semi-random order, a bunch of tech we've bought and, hopefully, one, we'll give you some interesting commentary and, two, this will give us a sense of what kinds of technology would actually be worthy of doing, like, dedicated Geek Dice reviews of.

521
00:27:18,546 --> 00:27:18,849
Scott: I don't know.

522
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,555
Rym: So we'll see.

523
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:23,718
Rym: I just found all the things I bought on Amazon recently.

524
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:24,850
Rym: They're remotely relevant.

525
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,690
Rym: So you want to start or should I start?

526
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,899
Scott: So the thing that I bought most recently at Amazon is remotely relevant.

527
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:36,624
Scott: It's something that everyone needs to have, which is a USB to serial ATA adapter thingy.

528
00:27:37,812 --> 00:27:43,980
Scott: This way... I mean, I had one of these, right, but the one that I had was... The oldest one I had was actually the IDE, right?

529
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:49,255
Scott: Then I bought a serial ATA one, but I don't know what happened to it, so I bought a new one.

530
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:52,022
Rym: Did you buy the Cables To Go one, like that one that everyone buys?

531
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:58,304
Scott: No, so the one that I bought that was that I had that I found in my desk drawer at work was only for two and a half inch drives.

532
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:02,182
Scott: It was basically USB on one end, serial ATA on the other end.

533
00:28:02,203 --> 00:28:03,678
Rym: Oh, I got one down here somewhere.

534
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:09,494
Scott: But it didn't work on a three and a half inch drive because it didn't provide enough power to spin up the motor, right?

535
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:17,656
Scott: So I went on Amazon and I was trying to find one that would be like, you know, because you can never tell like, is this one a good one or is it a bootleg, crappy one, right?

536
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:19,414
Scott: So I just want to let people know.

537
00:28:19,434 --> 00:28:20,646
Scott: I got this guy.

538
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:23,717
Scott: If you got a serial ATA drive... No, no, no.

539
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:24,728
Scott: I just have the little cable.

540
00:28:24,748 --> 00:28:25,395
Scott: I don't have a box.

541
00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:26,789
Rym: Oh, there's a drive in here.

542
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,119
Scott: Yeah.

543
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:38,630
Scott: If you want to connect an internal hard drive to a computer via USB, you should go on Amazon and buy the Ugreen USB 3 to SATA adapter.

544
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:44,285
Scott: It comes with a little power supply thingy and now you can power up a three and a half inch drive.

545
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:45,133
Scott: It will totally work.

546
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,619
Scott: And it's USB 3 so it's pretty fast.

547
00:28:48,206 --> 00:28:48,529
Scott: It was good.

548
00:28:49,814 --> 00:28:53,961
Scott: Oh, it's a must have device for anyone with drives and computers.

549
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:59,296
Rym: This is the SSD I bought back when SSDs were real expensive.

550
00:28:59,316 --> 00:29:00,144
Rym: that eventually died.

551
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:01,478
Rym: I spent like 400 bucks on this thing.

552
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:07,942
Scott: OK, something else really small that I bought is, you know, in my HDPC, I have an optical audio output, right?

553
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:17,981
Scott: But my Nintendo Switch sends audio to the PC via HDMI cable and then the PC, the TV has an optical audio output.

554
00:29:18,002 --> 00:29:23,414
Scott: So you have these two optical audio outputs, but my speaker system only has one optical input.

555
00:29:23,434 --> 00:29:27,597
Scott: So I got a switch and the switch that I had for many years was large.

556
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:30,429
Scott: It totally worked and it had a little remote control.

557
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:34,968
Rym: Let me admit, shamefully, I'm still just using the speakers in my TV.

558
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:36,950
Scott: I mean, whatever.

559
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,659
Rym: They're not great.

560
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,657
Rym: Like, I'm not going to pretend I'm not the kind of person who's going to say they're fine.

561
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:42,262
Rym: They're not.

562
00:29:42,404 --> 00:29:44,144
Rym: I'm just too lazy to do anything about it.

563
00:29:44,327 --> 00:29:50,670
Scott: Anyway, so I had the opposite of an optical audio switch, but the remote control broke because it was a cheapo model, right?

564
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:53,435
Scott: So I'm like, man, I should just try to fix this remote control.

565
00:29:53,455 --> 00:29:56,223
Scott: So I tried and I failed and the thing totally worked.

566
00:29:56,263 --> 00:29:58,363
Scott: I just get up to push the buttons on it to switch it.

567
00:29:58,404 --> 00:29:59,090
Scott: And it was large.

568
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,656
Scott: So I went on Amazon just to see how much is a new one.

569
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:02,061
Scott: You know what?

570
00:30:02,445 --> 00:30:03,665
Scott: A new one is fifteen dollars.

571
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:06,996
Scott: So I'm like, all right, fuck it.

572
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:11,869
Scott: I'll just buy the new one because the new one was so tiny compared to the one that I had.

573
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:13,422
Scott: Now it's completely hidden.

574
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:17,585
Scott: I freed up all this space in my own theater system because it's just this tiny little box.

575
00:30:17,606 --> 00:30:18,434
Scott: You don't even know it's there.

576
00:30:18,454 --> 00:30:20,070
Scott: And there's like a little.

577
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:23,684
Scott: the remote control infrared receiver is on little wires.

578
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:28,186
Scott: You can hide it somewhere and you can put the box hidden in the back and, you know, you don't see it.

579
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:32,655
Scott: But the thing is the one that I originally ordered.

580
00:30:32,675 --> 00:30:40,794
Scott: I want to let people know the portrait three, the portrait three port three by one digital digital audio optical switch.

581
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:50,522
Scott: What I actually received when I bought that on Amazon was not a switch, but instead the opposite of a switch has something with many outputs in one input.

582
00:30:52,395 --> 00:31:00,994
Scott: So I returned that and I instead ordered the J tech digital premium quality as p diff tasseling digital optical three by one switch.

583
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:02,490
Scott: And that indeed was a switch.

584
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:04,089
Scott: remote control that totally works.

585
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:15,034
Scott: So if you've got many optical audio sources and one optical audio speaker input on the speaker end by one of these guys, it totally works as cheap.

586
00:31:15,337 --> 00:31:15,762
Rym: All right.

587
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:21,721
Rym: I'm actually looking at because Hitman the forum always talks a lot about like he knows soundbars pretty well.

588
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:23,277
Rym: I'm thinking about just buying one of those soundbars.

589
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:37,301
Rym: Soundbars ain't bad and just plugging it because unlike you there is only one thing that ever sends audio that I care about to the TV and that's the HD PC and I guess the switch would be a second, but it's just HDMI.

590
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:40,974
Rym: So it still goes to the TV so I can just go out of the TV into a soundbar and not worry about it.

591
00:31:40,995 --> 00:31:46,228
Scott: I mean, if you're not doing surround, the reason to do the optical audio is for the surround sound, which I just gave up on.

592
00:31:46,268 --> 00:31:47,137
Rym: I let that ship sail.

593
00:31:47,258 --> 00:31:47,925
Scott: Then it doesn't matter.

594
00:31:48,188 --> 00:31:48,350
Rym: Yep.

595
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,177
Scott: Soundbars just fine.

596
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,149
Rym: So I'm thinking about it.

597
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:53,015
Rym: I also got the Sonos device.

598
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:53,764
Rym: That's for sure.

599
00:31:53,987 --> 00:31:54,170
Rym: Yeah.

600
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:59,830
Rym: So I bought recently a whole bunch of USB cables from Anker.

601
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:01,039
Scott: Why is that a story?

602
00:32:01,382 --> 00:32:02,694
Rym: So I want to review them.

603
00:32:02,735 --> 00:32:14,958
Rym: because, so the other day like a while ago, I was traveling like about a month ago and my phone started running low on battery because I was using it heavily and I was out a long time before I'd like be anywhere to charge it.

604
00:32:15,342 --> 00:32:18,707
Rym: So I plugged it into my Anker in my pocket and it just didn't charge.

605
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:20,920
Rym: That was a problem.

606
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,430
Rym: So I threw that USB cable away because clearly the USB cable was faulty.

607
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:31,729
Rym: And over the next few weeks I had this happen to me like nine times.

608
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:41,161
Rym: What happened, like I went back and looked, basically almost every USB cable I own I bought them all around the same time a long time ago.

609
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:43,690
Rym: And they all just wore out in the same way.

610
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:52,903
Rym: USB cables, well the previous generation of USB cables, not the modern like USB-C stuff, the USB micro with the little springs they wear out.

611
00:32:52,923 --> 00:32:54,157
Rym: They have a limited number of times.

612
00:32:54,177 --> 00:32:56,649
Rym: they can be plugged in before they start to lose their contacts.

613
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:03,025
Rym: And all the USB cables I bought around the same time started to wear out around the same time.

614
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:10,581
Rym: So I threw them all away and I just bought like a bunch of packs of Anker like braided cord USB cables.

615
00:33:10,601 --> 00:33:11,249
Rym: They're super cheap.

616
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,170
Rym: And they're great.

617
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:18,376
Scott: Yeah, so I've learned over the years lightning cables, right, and micro USB cables.

618
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:20,658
Scott: That's like I was buying Amazon Basics ones.

619
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:23,287
Scott: I was buying all kinds of different ones Anker ones.

620
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:26,238
Scott: See which ones would be like the most durable right.

621
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:29,002
Scott: Anker for greatly to their credit.

622
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:32,173
Scott: Once I had one of their cables break that was supposed to be the super strong one.

623
00:33:32,194 --> 00:33:35,910
Scott: And they just sent me a new one like they were like oh warranty on that cable sure.

624
00:33:36,371 --> 00:33:38,419
Scott: And they just sent me a new one with no questions asked.

625
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:42,820
Scott: But what I ended up realizing is that the way to go is the braided ones.

626
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:44,557
Scott: If it's a rubber cable is no good.

627
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:47,042
Scott: Metal cable is overkill and ridiculous.

628
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:53,426
Scott: Braided cables will last the longest if they're seeing heavy use charging phones in your pocket anyway.

629
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:59,023
Rym: So that's it because it's not something like the ones that are like near my computer like they're fine still.

630
00:33:59,104 --> 00:33:59,890
Rym: But I got rid of them anyway.

631
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:03,022
Scott: You can also you can look for that MFI certification too.

632
00:34:03,062 --> 00:34:03,710
Scott: That's that's it.

633
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:13,969
Rym: But I just bought all new USB cables and the Anker braided ones are fine and it was a great improvement over my previous state.

634
00:34:14,514 --> 00:34:21,449
Rym: And because I bought them all at once I bought the appropriate numbers of the appropriate lengths for all my possible use cases.

635
00:34:22,172 --> 00:34:23,262
Scott: It feels real good.

636
00:34:23,283 --> 00:34:25,382
Scott: I had a lot that were too long in different places.

637
00:34:25,483 --> 00:34:27,221
Rym: And I had some that were too short.

638
00:34:27,241 --> 00:34:29,444
Rym: I had a couple that were one foot long.

639
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:30,998
Rym: That is actually too short.

640
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:35,708
Scott: I also want to say if you go you can buy these hundred packs of like velcro cable ties.

641
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:36,514
Rym: Oh yeah.

642
00:34:36,817 --> 00:34:37,949
Scott: Actual velcro brand.

643
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:42,958
Scott: I'm ordering my second pack and I'm putting one in every single cable I own.

644
00:34:42,978 --> 00:34:45,847
Scott: And it's great because now nothing ever tangles.

645
00:34:45,928 --> 00:34:54,857
Scott: Cables that are in storage are all bundled up nicely and even cables that I'm using have the velcro on there so I can shorten them or tie them up and put them away and untie them.

646
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:55,100
Scott: It's like.

647
00:34:55,301 --> 00:35:06,515
Scott: so just get those by as many as you need and put these little velcro ties but one literally every fucking cable you own no matter what kind of cable is HDMI cable, lightning cable whatever.

648
00:35:06,535 --> 00:35:08,050
Scott: It'll be super great.

649
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:08,652
Rym: Yep.

650
00:35:08,997 --> 00:35:12,759
Rym: I did something similar a decade ago with all the GeekNights audio crap.

651
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:15,364
Rym: So I did buy something actually new.

652
00:35:15,384 --> 00:35:22,310
Rym: So as you know I still think to this day that the Pebble smartwatch was the best possible UX for a smartwatch.

653
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,605
Scott: Pebble watch is pretty great.

654
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:27,323
Scott: The only reason I stopped using the Pebble watch is because it died.

655
00:35:27,343 --> 00:35:27,727
Scott: Yep.

656
00:35:27,828 --> 00:35:30,816
Rym: Because it didn't do a bunch of fancy bullshit that you don't need.

657
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,229
Rym: It was always on.

658
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:33,464
Rym: you got your notifications.

659
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,797
Scott: The battery lasted forever.

660
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,413
Rym: The battery lasted like a week.

661
00:35:36,615 --> 00:35:37,264
Scott: It looked great.

662
00:35:37,487 --> 00:35:37,709
Rym: Yeah.

663
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:38,882
Rym: So the only reason.

664
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:39,650
Scott: It was comfy and small.

665
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,658
Rym: So Scott's kind of stopped working and he got the iWatch.

666
00:35:42,698 --> 00:35:43,870
Scott: It didn't really stop working.

667
00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:45,690
Scott: it just worked a little bit less good.

668
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,487
Scott: And then the support went away.

669
00:35:47,507 --> 00:35:52,801
Rym: So I held out longer but eventually the basic things I use it for.

670
00:35:52,862 --> 00:35:58,115
Scott: I think the reason I was able to bail so easily is because Apple is just like guess what new Apple watches with LTE and I'm like well alright.

671
00:35:58,257 --> 00:35:58,460
Rym: Yep.

672
00:35:59,068 --> 00:36:07,244
Rym: And I do think that both the Apple watch and the Android watches are an inferior overall experience to the Pebble for us.

673
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:12,943
Scott: Well I think that if you have an iPhone like I do the Apple watch is actually sort of better.

674
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:15,083
Rym: It does more but it's a trade off.

675
00:36:15,184 --> 00:36:19,809
Scott: The trade off is that it's a little bit bigger but that actually stopped bothering me now.

676
00:36:20,955 --> 00:36:21,830
Scott: It's more expensive.

677
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:22,964
Scott: that's truly a problem.

678
00:36:23,045 --> 00:36:23,227
Rym: Yeah.

679
00:36:24,112 --> 00:36:24,900
Rym: It's not always on.

680
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:26,436
Scott: And the battery life is much worse.

681
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,093
Scott: But other than that it's better.

682
00:36:28,638 --> 00:36:31,002
Rym: So I can't get an iWatch because I don't have an iPhone.

683
00:36:31,043 --> 00:36:31,832
Rym: so I had to get an Android watch.

684
00:36:31,852 --> 00:36:32,481
Scott: You can get an iPhone.

685
00:36:32,928 --> 00:36:32,989
Rym: Eh.

686
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:36,664
Rym: I like my, I actually really like my Android smartphone.

687
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:38,119
Scott: I haven't had an iPhone.

688
00:36:38,422 --> 00:36:38,564
Rym: Yeah.

689
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:39,029
Rym: You know what?

690
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,321
Scott: You haven't had an iPhone.

691
00:36:40,644 --> 00:36:41,919
Rym: You say that I like this phone.

692
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:43,899
Rym: Completely waterproof for a long time.

693
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:47,533
Rym: I just like take it in the shower with me and read Fark like it's totally chill.

694
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:57,716
Rym: Anyway so I needed to buy a smartwatch because the rot of services got to the point that my Pebble was an inferior experience.

695
00:36:58,362 --> 00:37:02,100
Rym: I gave it to our friend Kat because she's gonna ride the Pebble train to the bitter end.

696
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:02,645
Scott: And yeah.

697
00:37:02,665 --> 00:37:03,716
Scott: I got Pebble watches.

698
00:37:03,737 --> 00:37:05,152
Scott: I have two of the original Pebble watch.

699
00:37:05,253 --> 00:37:05,778
Scott: One is broken.

700
00:37:05,798 --> 00:37:08,606
Scott: And one Pebble Time which is not really broken.

701
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:09,941
Scott: It's just sitting there unused.

702
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:10,264
Scott: Yep.

703
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:13,798
Rym: So I factually said it and gave it to her so she can extend the life.

704
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,424
Rym: I read that.

705
00:37:14,444 --> 00:37:17,615
Scott: I'll put them with my Google Glass in my museum of technology.

706
00:37:17,776 --> 00:37:18,543
Rym: In July.

707
00:37:18,564 --> 00:37:21,818
Rym: You can kind of use Google Glass with generic Android wear actually.

708
00:37:22,222 --> 00:37:22,910
Rym: I'm gonna try that out.

709
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,323
Rym: I'm gonna see if I can just get started using it again.

710
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:24,687
Rym: Alright.

711
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:24,970
Scott: Good luck.

712
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:30,849
Rym: But I had I had to buy a smartwatch and I was looking at Android because I can't do the iWatch thing.

713
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:38,946
Rym: Most Android smartwatches are either gigantic bullshit monsters just like most Android phones are.

714
00:37:40,354 --> 00:37:42,849
Rym: And a lot of them are way too expensive for what they do.

715
00:37:43,673 --> 00:37:47,737
Rym: And it seems like the best one to get is the LG style.

716
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,464
Scott: Okay.

717
00:37:48,586 --> 00:37:49,899
Rym: The reason for the obsessed one I bought.

718
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,649
Rym: The reason I got it is that it's the smallest one.

719
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:53,797
Scott: That's a good reason.

720
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,818
Rym: The battery seems to last like all day.

721
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,526
Rym: It's fine.

722
00:37:56,951 --> 00:37:57,596
Rym: Like an iWatch.

723
00:37:57,758 --> 00:37:57,939
Rym: Alright.

724
00:37:58,585 --> 00:37:59,474
Rym: It doesn't have.

725
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:00,829
Scott: But a pebble watch lasts multiple days.

726
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,455
Scott: Yeah.

727
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:01,697
Rym: Yeah.

728
00:38:01,717 --> 00:38:05,475
Rym: But I can't compare it to the pebble because I can't buy a new pebble.

729
00:38:05,556 --> 00:38:05,758
Rym: Yeah.

730
00:38:05,899 --> 00:38:06,909
Rym: I can't keep using the pebble.

731
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:12,510
Rym: The LG style smartwatch in my opinion is the best Android smartwatch.

732
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,570
Scott: What Android smartwatches have you tried?

733
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,110
Rym: Just reading specs, reading reviews.

734
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:18,830
Rym: I bought this one.

735
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,920
Rym: I've been using it.

736
00:38:20,082 --> 00:38:21,457
Scott: The one that I bought is the best one.

737
00:38:21,477 --> 00:38:22,266
Scott: I haven't tried any others.

738
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:35,249
Rym: So what I'm gonna say is that the other ones are definitely bigger and don't seem to provide any material advantages for me over this small minimalist one.

739
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:39,270
Rym: I couldn't like every other smartwatch I looked at.

740
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,728
Rym: this Android was way bigger had a bunch of bullshit in.

741
00:38:42,808 --> 00:38:45,735
Rym: it was real ugly but mostly just it was so big.

742
00:38:46,038 --> 00:38:47,150
Rym: This is the smallest one.

743
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,038
Rym: It's actually the same size as a normal watch.

744
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,798
Rym: I got out my old normal watch from high school.

745
00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:57,210
Rym: They're all the people who say this watch is bad.

746
00:38:57,534 --> 00:39:00,949
Rym: their primary complaint is it's too small on my wrist.

747
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,002
Scott: Same people want a giant phone.

748
00:39:04,387 --> 00:39:04,549
Rym: Yup.

749
00:39:05,372 --> 00:39:15,656
Rym: So I have the tiny weird Android phone and the tiny Android smartwatch and while it is an objectively inferior experience to the pebble, it is a perfectly fine experience.

750
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:18,829
Rym: if pebbles didn't exist and I needed a smartwatch.

751
00:39:20,112 --> 00:39:20,316
Scott: Alright.

752
00:39:20,337 --> 00:39:30,888
Scott: so I had this NAS, the ready NAS NV+ which actually was way older than I thought and at one point I had to replace the power supply in it with a third party power supply and that actually totally worked.

753
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,870
Rym: Yeah that feels wrong though.

754
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:34,348
Scott: Yeah it does not.

755
00:39:34,591 --> 00:39:46,389
Scott: even though like I thought it was failing but actually it was not properly informing me of the way the drive failed and I did put a new drive in it and it totally did resurrect itself.

756
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:51,821
Rym: My night gear ready NAS do had similar problems like it would get into a weird state and I have to fuss with it.

757
00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:55,190
Scott: But the main thing is that it was really slow, it was really noisy.

758
00:39:55,352 --> 00:40:01,010
Scott: it had a lot of issues it's like but for some reason it did keep on working like it was a good.

759
00:40:01,413 --> 00:40:04,750
Scott: if you just cared about your data being reliable as long as you replaced the power supply.

760
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,962
Rym: Same boat, this net gear thing like it actually is still working fine.

761
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:10,467
Rym: it's just annoying to use and kind of dodgy.

762
00:40:10,487 --> 00:40:16,445
Scott: The main problem that really bothered me the most though was the fact that it failed made me worried of its future reliability.

763
00:40:16,506 --> 00:40:16,869
Scott: Yup.

764
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:24,345
Scott: Also the it only supported, the software never really got updated so it only supported SMB1.

765
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:42,165
Scott: Windows 10 actually removed support for SMB1 because it's inherently insecure and you have to go to a special menu to add SMB1 support back to Windows because SMB2 is secure and I really was like you know I probably should stop using SMB1 and disable that and use SMB2 only.

766
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,669
Scott: but to do that I need new NAS.

767
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,774
Scott: So I went and I bought the Synology that Rym has.

768
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:48,188
Scott: only mine is the same as his.

769
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:50,934
Scott: only mine is four bays, Rym has five bays.

770
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:51,217
Scott: Yup.

771
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,650
Scott: But it's otherwise identical.

772
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:53,690
Scott: it's the Synology.

773
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,815
Scott: I have the DS918+ And I have the DS1517+.

774
00:40:59,352 --> 00:41:02,977
Scott: It's the same exact device only mine has one less drive bay in it.

775
00:41:03,037 --> 00:41:03,219
Rym: Yup.

776
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:08,170
Scott: And let me tell you compared to that ready NAS and it costs a lot of money for this thing.

777
00:41:09,076 --> 00:41:09,238
Scott: Yup.

778
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,390
Scott: It's night and fucking day.

779
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:14,067
Scott: the Synology is like a masterpiece of engineering.

780
00:41:14,168 --> 00:41:14,815
Scott: it is incredible.

781
00:41:14,876 --> 00:41:16,150
Rym: And we both had this experience.

782
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:19,199
Rym: our NASes are the same other than this one bay.

783
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:21,584
Scott: But NASes like this didn't exist when I bought my NV+.

784
00:41:22,372 --> 00:41:30,289
Rym: So the big difference is kinda like how when we went from building those old AMD computers just going Intel I turned this thing on.

785
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,829
Rym: it just works.

786
00:41:32,374 --> 00:41:34,915
Rym: there's a web interface that is super responsive.

787
00:41:34,955 --> 00:41:43,641
Scott: The web interface looks like a desktop operating like you go in your browser and a thing that looks like Windows comes up and you can drag and drop and it has Windows in it.

788
00:41:43,964 --> 00:41:50,309
Scott: It's like a whole GUI OS windowing but it's just to manage your NAS.

789
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:54,050
Scott: it has apps you can install and it all works perfectly.

790
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:55,563
Scott: it has any feature.

791
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:59,438
Scott: it's like you don't need to hack firmwares or anything cause any feature that you can imagine.

792
00:41:59,499 --> 00:42:03,238
Scott: like gee I'd really like my computer to automatically back up things to this NAS.

793
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:04,712
Scott: Oh there's a thing that does that.

794
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:08,650
Scott: Gee I'd really like this NAS to automatically back up it's data to the cloud.

795
00:42:08,872 --> 00:42:09,741
Scott: there's a thing that does that.

796
00:42:10,004 --> 00:42:13,219
Scott: Gee I really wish this NAS like I could plug things into its USB slot.

797
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:14,190
Scott: It does that.

798
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:23,948
Scott: Anything that you could possibly like you don't need it to be open source cause literally any feature you can possibly imagine that you'd want this NAS to do is an app.

799
00:42:24,191 --> 00:42:26,167
Rym: look Active Directory hit a button.

800
00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:29,421
Rym: it's an AD server now DHCP server.

801
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:30,229
Scott: it's a web server.

802
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,260
Scott: there's like nothing that I could possibly want it to do.

803
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:33,948
Scott: that it doesn't do.

804
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,006
Rym: you can run like clouds.

805
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:37,824
Rym: I can run Java bullshit on it.

806
00:42:37,864 --> 00:42:39,930
Rym: look at this node node.js.

807
00:42:40,293 --> 00:42:41,422
Scott: it's super quiet.

808
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:45,942
Scott: if you when you plug it in you go to find.synology.com and it finds it.

809
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:49,339
Scott: you can even fix the SSL cert on it if you want to.

810
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:56,673
Scott: it's like damn like the people at Synology I can tell are Linux nerds who set the shit up and know how it goes down.

811
00:42:56,693 --> 00:42:59,461
Scott: but also it uses BetterFS for its raid.

812
00:42:59,866 --> 00:43:01,097
Scott: it's like damn son.

813
00:43:01,299 --> 00:43:04,048
Rym: it's very much prosumer edging into professional.

814
00:43:04,088 --> 00:43:09,039
Rym: because the plus model is well yeah so we are specifically reviewing the plus models.

815
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:12,150
Rym: the non plus model not.

816
00:43:12,473 --> 00:43:15,180
Rym: it's more like the regular old shitty NAS experience.

817
00:43:15,221 --> 00:43:15,908
Rym: it'll still work.

818
00:43:16,696 --> 00:43:20,902
Rym: it is that little plus is worth the extra couple hundred bucks like way worth it.

819
00:43:22,574 --> 00:43:26,169
Rym: the other big difference I think that we both notice is that it is just faster.

820
00:43:27,092 --> 00:43:31,119
Scott: like data access is faster everything is so much faster compared to the other.

821
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:34,856
Scott: and it could be cause the drives are faster but they're like 5400 RPM drives.

822
00:43:35,139 --> 00:43:40,875
Rym: they're still spinning disks yeah and the only reason I have 5 bays instead of 4 is my NAS is for 2 people.

823
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:47,079
Rym: so that extra storage actually really mattered a lot cause Emily generates a lot of data and I also generate a lot of data.

824
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:48,289
Rym: so we're both using it.

825
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:51,037
Rym: I enabled the Glacier Sync.

826
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,977
Rym: it just synchronizes up to Glacier.

827
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:56,410
Rym: it has a built in interface for like restoring files.

828
00:43:57,017 --> 00:44:02,499
Rym: if this NAS dies I can download the NAS's configuration from Glacier back onto itself like.

829
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,249
Rym: it's pretty great.

830
00:44:04,217 --> 00:44:13,870
Rym: the only problem I have with this NAS other than that it is substantially more expensive than a typical consumer NAS like hundreds and hundreds of dollars more.

831
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:20,939
Scott: yes Synology has other models that are much cheaper and from what I can tell those models do have similar features like probably are.

832
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:33,122
Scott: actually I probably recommend them based on what I know but they are gonna be much slower and they don't have a lot of RAM and power in them so they might not be as a magical experience as the plus fancy models.

833
00:44:33,142 --> 00:44:39,204
Scott: the other thing with the plus model that really sold me on it is I'm thinking man down the road what if this NAS is too small?

834
00:44:39,548 --> 00:44:41,670
Scott: right you know what if I need bigger drives in there?

835
00:44:41,771 --> 00:44:45,910
Scott: what if right you can get expansion things to add more slots.

836
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:47,909
Scott: I can get this thing and attach it.

837
00:44:48,314 --> 00:44:52,740
Scott: that will add 5 more 4 or 5 more bays to this thing and just put another volume in there.

838
00:44:52,962 --> 00:44:54,982
Scott: yeah and so I could load that up with drives.

839
00:44:55,285 --> 00:45:00,115
Scott: then I could basically get enough parity swap out my old drives put in bigger ones.

840
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:02,964
Scott: right because the drives I have in there are 4 terabyte drives.

841
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:07,932
Rym: I want 8 terabyte partly because I got them on sale though I think it might be able to support like 16 8.

842
00:45:07,932 --> 00:45:13,090
Scott: it definitely is 8 terabyte drives so I can at least double my capacity.

843
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,590
Scott: it might support 16 terabyte drives.

844
00:45:15,651 --> 00:45:16,810
Scott: I don't know all I'm saying.

845
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:24,458
Rym: one day those are gonna be cheap and available if you have serious data needs and are not a company.

846
00:45:24,478 --> 00:45:27,225
Rym: the Synology NAS is with the plus.

847
00:45:27,265 --> 00:45:30,760
Rym: next to them the DS number number number number plus they like.

848
00:45:31,224 --> 00:45:32,919
Scott: that is the solution it's gonna.

849
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:34,535
Scott: it's gonna really help you out.

850
00:45:34,616 --> 00:45:41,448
Scott: if you have you know computers like comparing these to like some of the QNAP type things I think this can actually even more than someone like me.

851
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:48,636
Scott: if you're the kind of person who's say doing like photo and video work right oh yeah and you've got like a laptop and you don't really have a desktop.

852
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:51,870
Scott: just having this in your house right.

853
00:45:51,991 --> 00:45:54,779
Scott: so when you get home you back everything up that it's gonna.

854
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:55,729
Scott: really it's really huge.

855
00:45:56,012 --> 00:46:03,284
Rym: now I'll give you one further caveat don't go beyond five bays unless you know what you're doing.

856
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:05,667
Scott: you don't need more than five days beyond five bays.

857
00:46:05,728 --> 00:46:15,185
Rym: there's actually a different kind of drive you probably want to buy or else the resonance of this device on its own will actually increase your drive failure rate?

858
00:46:15,225 --> 00:46:17,243
Rym: yeah we don't even need that.

859
00:46:17,384 --> 00:46:21,405
Scott: so in relation to that I think we both bought the Western Digital.

860
00:46:21,465 --> 00:46:22,920
Scott: what's it called my passport?

861
00:46:23,345 --> 00:46:25,487
Rym: oh yeah I put that in here because I was gonna talk about that right?

862
00:46:25,507 --> 00:46:27,443
Scott: so what this is related to the NAS.

863
00:46:27,463 --> 00:46:28,149
Scott: so what this is?

864
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:28,836
Scott: it's such.

865
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:30,333
Rym: it's so good I didn't realize.

866
00:46:30,434 --> 00:46:34,250
Scott: once I realized this existed I paid even though it's kind of also overpriced.

867
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:36,210
Rym: it's like two hundred bucks for the four terabyte.

868
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:36,859
Scott: I got the four.

869
00:46:36,879 --> 00:46:40,757
Scott: I got the biggest one because the three terabyte one's like ten dollars cheaper right.

870
00:46:40,778 --> 00:46:41,828
Scott: so anyway what this is?

871
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:43,690
Scott: it's an external hard drive.

872
00:46:43,912 --> 00:46:45,487
Scott: it's an external USB three hard drive.

873
00:46:45,648 --> 00:46:47,626
Scott: right okay it's a big square.

874
00:46:47,687 --> 00:46:50,170
Rym: it's kind of big yep but it's self powered.

875
00:46:50,634 --> 00:46:51,360
Scott: it's self powered.

876
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,510
Scott: so it is also a battery.

877
00:46:53,456 --> 00:47:02,028
Scott: you can turn it on when it's attached to fucking nothing connect to it with your phone with an app wirelessly and look at your data on there.

878
00:47:02,048 --> 00:47:04,050
Scott: you can back up your phone to it wirelessly.

879
00:47:04,474 --> 00:47:06,049
Scott: you can get stuff from it wirelessly.

880
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:09,889
Rym: you can plug your phone into it and charge your phone from it if you're really in a pinch.

881
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:13,909
Scott: it's a battery right it's a battery and a hard drive but wait there's more.

882
00:47:14,495 --> 00:47:15,665
Scott: it has an SD slot.

883
00:47:15,948 --> 00:47:29,946
Scott: you can take your SD card out of your camera or your phone or whatever shove it in there and it will start once you push a button backing up that data from the SD card to itself when it's not even plugged into the wall because again it has a battery in it.

884
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:32,975
Scott: also that wireless part is wifi.

885
00:47:33,257 --> 00:47:36,270
Scott: you can with it not connect it to anything.

886
00:47:36,755 --> 00:47:44,430
Scott: have it connect to wifi to get it on the internet and it can back up its data to the cloud when it's connected to fucking nothing.

887
00:47:44,894 --> 00:47:46,732
Rym: or because I set up my NAS like this.

888
00:47:46,974 --> 00:47:49,518
Rym: so we're at a con we video like a bunch of panels.

889
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:51,195
Scott: yeah this is the main workflow here.

890
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,340
Scott: you video stuff you photo stuff.

891
00:47:53,825 --> 00:48:00,387
Scott: you take your SD cards while you're out and about traveling and every night you put your SD cards into this to back them up.

892
00:48:01,216 --> 00:48:05,035
Scott: then when you get home you take this you plug it right into your NAS.

893
00:48:05,055 --> 00:48:11,824
Scott: you plug this external drive this Western Digital My Passport thing into your NAS and push the button on the NAS.

894
00:48:12,188 --> 00:48:17,359
Scott: now that drive starts backing up all the photos and videos from your trip onto the NAS.

895
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:26,590
Scott: meanwhile you take your SD cards that you didn't erase over to your computer and start editing video while the backing up is happening losing no time whatsoever.

896
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:29,723
Scott: and now you've got four copies of your stuff.

897
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:36,914
Scott: you've got it on the Passport you got it on your NAS you got it on your SD cards and now you have it on your desktop where you're working on it and maybe you'll have it in the class.

898
00:48:36,934 --> 00:48:39,783
Scott: so suddenly you got five copies of something with like no effort.

899
00:48:40,248 --> 00:48:42,328
Scott: super backed up super safe it's.

900
00:48:42,752 --> 00:48:43,984
Scott: it really changes everything.

901
00:48:44,045 --> 00:48:49,277
Rym: like the workflow for me and Scott now at a convention is we both generate a bunch of SD cards with shit.

902
00:48:49,681 --> 00:48:55,783
Rym: I put all mine into mine he puts all his into his and then we swap cards we swap SD cards so they're all backed up two times.

903
00:48:55,965 --> 00:49:03,196
Rym: so then when we both get home we can both immediately start making whatever media we're gonna make from our combined set of footage.

904
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:16,306
Scott: right but even if you're just say like even if you're like just a wedding photographer right okay so you're at a wedding you're taking photos taking photos fill the memory card shove it in here put a new memory card in the camera shoot photo shoot photo shoot photos.

905
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:20,186
Scott: by the time you filled up that memory card it's gonna be done right.

906
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:21,640
Scott: it's gonna be so huge.

907
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,934
Scott: I don't know really how.

908
00:49:22,975 --> 00:49:34,104
Scott: if you're someone who collects data on the go right maybe even if you're just like doing work on the go that creates large amounts of data you need one of these bad boys like before.

909
00:49:34,144 --> 00:49:45,096
Rym: this like the UX is the reason to buy this because before this like I could do a similar workflow but what I ended up doing is I'd plug the SD cards into my laptop that had an external hard drive connected to it

910
00:49:45,298 --> 00:49:46,674
Scott: and then you had to manually drag

911
00:49:46,694 --> 00:49:47,118
Rym: them all around.

912
00:49:47,139 --> 00:49:56,470
Rym: do you know how many times I would like forget to drag one like I'd forget one and I get home and I can't edit the panel until Scott comes over like the next week and gives me his SD card.

913
00:49:56,571 --> 00:50:00,207
Scott: yep it's it's real if you go out and take videos or photos or something.

914
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,227
Scott: these are these like must have device here.

915
00:50:02,348 --> 00:50:04,267
Rym: I am super impressed with this device and I can't.

916
00:50:04,287 --> 00:50:05,782
Rym: there aren't really other ones like it.

917
00:50:05,943 --> 00:50:10,004
Scott: yeah do not get the Western Digital NAS because I've heard bad things about those.

918
00:50:10,024 --> 00:50:11,034
Scott: get the Synology one.

919
00:50:11,943 --> 00:50:12,933
Rym: so we both bought.

920
00:50:12,954 --> 00:50:17,034
Rym: we both needed a label maker partly to label our SD cards.

921
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:18,690
Rym: as part of updating this workflow.

922
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,669
Scott: I didn't update my label my SD cards.

923
00:50:21,276 --> 00:50:22,470
Rym: we both bought the same.

924
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:25,279
Rym: there's this one label maker on Amazon.

925
00:50:25,299 --> 00:50:27,682
Rym: it's like the cheapest one.

926
00:50:27,723 --> 00:50:30,310
Rym: it's like 30 bucks and it's fine.

927
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:32,305
Rym: okay I don't know what else I can say about it.

928
00:50:32,386 --> 00:50:35,053
Rym: it's fine I'm using it as my label maker.

929
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:45,376
Rym: the fact that the mere fact of owning a label maker is convenient enough to be worth this basically trivial cost of entry even if it breaks in a year or two.

930
00:50:45,903 --> 00:50:47,843
Scott: it was so cheap I used it to label batteries.

931
00:50:47,904 --> 00:50:50,250
Scott: so I know because labeling batteries is a great idea.

932
00:50:50,834 --> 00:50:53,275
Scott: you've got say you know something that has like.

933
00:50:53,296 --> 00:50:56,710
Scott: so you got a GoPro and you got five GoPro batteries.

934
00:50:56,892 --> 00:51:00,447
Scott: right you label them one two three four and five always start with one.

935
00:51:00,467 --> 00:51:04,185
Scott: now you know which ones are the ones that are full and empty.

936
00:51:04,508 --> 00:51:07,538
Scott: right without having some sort of system of like flipping them or whatever.

937
00:51:07,558 --> 00:51:09,113
Rym: right yeah those I had.

938
00:51:09,174 --> 00:51:10,447
Rym: all those systems it's.

939
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:11,719
Rym: this is so much more elegant.

940
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,449
Scott: labeling them all is way better than what I say.

941
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:15,680
Rym: yep all right.

942
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,972
Scott: so something else I want to talk about here.

943
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:17,923
Rym: all right what do you want?

944
00:51:17,943 --> 00:51:25,337
Scott: so you know for many many moons since like 2000 before GeekNights I always used headphones.

945
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:29,821
Scott: I had six I which is the white ones that went with iPods.

946
00:51:30,508 --> 00:51:38,350
Scott: then I upgraded to like the hf2 hf3 ones which had the controllers which are for iPhones and I went through a few of those and the main.

947
00:51:38,713 --> 00:51:40,509
Scott: the thing is they were effectively perfect.

948
00:51:40,529 --> 00:51:41,701
Scott: they did everything I wanted.

949
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:42,994
Scott: they sounded great.

950
00:51:43,782 --> 00:51:45,398
Scott: I didn't sound the best but they sounded great.

951
00:51:45,863 --> 00:51:47,277
Scott: the isolation was incredible.

952
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:51,519
Scott: you put them on and you could stand next to a subway train with your volume down real low.

953
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:52,509
Scott: you'd hear your music.

954
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:53,519
Scott: you wouldn't hear the subway.

955
00:51:53,782 --> 00:51:55,842
Rym: I use the exact same ones for a long time.

956
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,398
Scott: your hearing was protected.

957
00:51:57,419 --> 00:51:58,450
Scott: it was fantastic.

958
00:51:59,515 --> 00:52:01,518
Scott: you know the controls on the wire worked great.

959
00:52:01,942 --> 00:52:08,649
Scott: everything was great except the problem with every single animatic I've ever had no matter what model is that the wires were flimsy as hell.

960
00:52:09,034 --> 00:52:27,398
Scott: and what would eventually happen over months or perhaps a year or two of use is that the wire near the jack would become stressed and you could tell that it broke internally because your music would cut out and you'd wiggle the wire near the jack and if you held it in just the right position you could hear the sound again.

961
00:52:27,782 --> 00:52:32,289
Scott: but if you let go well then it would cut out again because the wire was broken inside the rubber cable.

962
00:52:32,975 --> 00:52:36,350
Scott: they never made ones that had duh replaceable cables.

963
00:52:36,935 --> 00:52:40,206
Scott: all they had to do they had to make one with a completely replaceable cable.

964
00:52:40,267 --> 00:52:42,469
Scott: where the cable goes up to the actual earbud.

965
00:52:42,995 --> 00:52:54,368
Scott: they didn't have to make it to where like maybe the cable ended around your neck and then there was a little you know jack where you could swap it out because the part that always broke was the part that was in your pocket anyway.

966
00:52:54,389 --> 00:53:01,378
Scott: so the etymotic broke again as I thought they would and I may yet still RMA them which is all.

967
00:53:01,399 --> 00:53:04,370
Scott: they've always honored my warranty even when I've been way beyond warranty.

968
00:53:05,441 --> 00:53:10,874
Scott: but I decided to take you know to try out some wireless headphone option instead.

969
00:53:10,895 --> 00:53:15,338
Scott: because well wireless you don't got to worry about any cable damage right?

970
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,823
Rym: I will admit that the non apple wireless headphone experience generally sucks.

971
00:53:19,883 --> 00:53:22,146
Scott: yes so I've had bluetooth headphones before.

972
00:53:22,167 --> 00:53:27,337
Scott: I have some I was going to review and they're always a pain in the ass because the bluetooth pairing really sucks.

973
00:53:27,398 --> 00:53:38,329
Scott: so I looked apple the new apple bluetooth whatever has this thing where the there's certain headphones that use like the wireless apple standard and they quote just work.

974
00:53:38,855 --> 00:53:51,237
Scott: so uh one of our listeners luke suggested he is a big big fan of the beats x wireless inner headphones I mean beats kind of turned me off because like you know it's beats I mean I bought.

975
00:53:51,297 --> 00:53:53,196
Rym: sure in the end that's what I'm using for this.

976
00:53:53,217 --> 00:53:53,843
Scott: but I went.

977
00:53:53,883 --> 00:53:55,137
Scott: I bought them just to see how they were.

978
00:53:55,177 --> 00:53:58,429
Scott: I figured I could return them and here's how they are right.

979
00:53:58,449 --> 00:54:11,240
Scott: so on the first problem I had when I got them is that the wireless part it is once you do have it hooked up to your iPhone it's pretty great because like you turn them on and it's paired turn them off unpaired it.

980
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:17,155
Scott: once you pair them with your iPhone your apple watch and your iPad both know about it now so you can easily.

981
00:54:17,196 --> 00:54:18,205
Scott: just I went to my iPad.

982
00:54:18,225 --> 00:54:19,944
Scott: I pushed one button and it just switched.

983
00:54:20,045 --> 00:54:22,430
Scott: it moved from the iPhone to the iPad immediately.

984
00:54:23,352 --> 00:54:24,182
Scott: it's super great.

985
00:54:24,465 --> 00:54:25,174
Scott: the pairing works.

986
00:54:25,922 --> 00:54:33,862
Scott: uh the thing is it took me a while to get used to turning them on and off and I had to turn on and I wasn't used to turning my headphones on and off.

987
00:54:33,923 --> 00:54:34,348
Scott: now I am.

988
00:54:35,034 --> 00:54:39,155
Scott: but until you get used to that it was kind of annoying like why is music coming out?

989
00:54:39,296 --> 00:54:41,498
Scott: oh I didn't turn my headphones on right.

990
00:54:41,538 --> 00:54:44,608
Scott: they do have a battery that will run out but it lasts so long.

991
00:54:44,669 --> 00:54:45,679
Scott: I've never had it run out.

992
00:54:46,668 --> 00:54:49,678
Scott: uh you do have to charge it with a lightning cable which okay.

993
00:54:49,759 --> 00:54:51,010
Scott: so I charge my headphones at night.

994
00:54:51,394 --> 00:54:54,387
Scott: it's a thing I have to remember to do but I got used to it it.

995
00:54:54,428 --> 00:54:56,089
Scott: you know it's still not as good as wired.

996
00:54:57,071 --> 00:55:01,577
Scott: um the two problems with it the negatives and I think this might be the only negative.

997
00:55:01,658 --> 00:55:03,052
Scott: oh the sound first of all.

998
00:55:03,274 --> 00:55:13,617
Scott: uh the you can see the drivers on these are like way bigger than the drivers on the etymotic and they sound way more bassy and way more like fun.

999
00:55:13,638 --> 00:55:15,516
Scott: I guess that's what beats are supposed to sound like.

1000
00:55:15,557 --> 00:55:18,648
Rym: my surers are pretty much the same way like they have this giant driver.

1001
00:55:18,668 --> 00:55:20,243
Scott: yeah it's like you can like.

1002
00:55:20,486 --> 00:55:21,477
Scott: they sound more fun.

1003
00:55:21,497 --> 00:55:24,326
Scott: I don't know if they sound better for certain kinds of music.

1004
00:55:24,407 --> 00:55:28,445
Scott: you know it it's yeah that well I mean that's the kind of moods we don't really get into.

1005
00:55:28,546 --> 00:55:40,223
Rym: but there's there's a difference between headphones that sound good for listening to music and headphones that are a pure experience which really only matters if you're doing like editing a podcast.

1006
00:55:40,243 --> 00:55:45,838
Scott: so I can't really judge the quality of it so much but it's definitely a different aesthetic to the listening experience.

1007
00:55:45,858 --> 00:55:50,223
Scott: yeah um so the negatives is that one they don't.

1008
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:51,962
Scott: they're not like comfortable in my ear.

1009
00:55:52,104 --> 00:55:52,286
Scott: and the.

1010
00:55:52,912 --> 00:55:57,113
Scott: there's multiple earbud choices like different you know rubber bits you can put on.

1011
00:55:57,699 --> 00:56:02,105
Scott: none of them felt great and none of them sealed to isolate my ear at all.

1012
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:02,510
Scott: really.

1013
00:56:03,095 --> 00:56:07,679
Scott: and when I was first began using them I was very frustrated with the lack of isolation.

1014
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:12,950
Scott: because it was such stark contrast because I do because the etymotic skin wearing out.

1015
00:56:13,051 --> 00:56:16,546
Rym: I went with the Shure out and said I got the Shure like durable ones the SE-215.

1016
00:56:18,397 --> 00:56:19,070
Rym: they're invincible.

1017
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:22,144
Rym: I can replace the cables if they break.

1018
00:56:22,407 --> 00:56:24,770
Scott: oh yeah the durability is not a concern.

1019
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:25,863
Rym: but also the.

1020
00:56:27,155 --> 00:56:29,050
Rym: they have the flange tips.

1021
00:56:29,332 --> 00:56:30,282
Scott: there are flange tips.

1022
00:56:30,343 --> 00:56:34,564
Scott: they're just not the triple flange they're two flange.

1023
00:56:34,604 --> 00:56:35,555
Rym: nah you need the three.

1024
00:56:35,778 --> 00:56:36,810
Scott: well they don't have a three flange.

1025
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,586
Rym: so I have the three flange.

1026
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:42,649
Rym: but I tried out the Shure just like the foam thing that you roll up and expands in your ear.

1027
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,584
Rym: perfect isolation just great.

1028
00:56:44,685 --> 00:56:46,746
Scott: I don't think there was a foam thing that rolled up in my ear.

1029
00:56:46,766 --> 00:56:47,190
Scott: there were three.

1030
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:51,857
Scott: I think there were three sizes of rubber bits giant giant medium and small.

1031
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:56,059
Scott: this is the style I'm using right now and none of them felt great and none of them isolated.

1032
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,878
Rym: great these are like way comfortable.

1033
00:56:57,918 --> 00:57:02,525
Scott: maybe I can go get some different ones somewhere but yeah the one again I have some extras they might fit.

1034
00:57:02,687 --> 00:57:04,888
Scott: actually I know the ones that came with it were not good.

1035
00:57:04,949 --> 00:57:06,325
Scott: they don't isolate and they're not comfy.

1036
00:57:08,054 --> 00:57:10,327
Rym: yeah see I got all these different options that came with mine.

1037
00:57:12,457 --> 00:57:16,329
Scott: what was the other negative part besides not isolating and not being comfy?

1038
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:18,810
Scott: there was something else that bothered me about them.

1039
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:19,860
Rym: yeah cause I use the Shures.

1040
00:57:19,881 --> 00:57:21,620
Rym: they're wired but I don't really care.

1041
00:57:21,661 --> 00:57:26,005
Scott: oh I remember so because they're all appley and Bluetooth and what not right?

1042
00:57:27,298 --> 00:57:36,265
Scott: I pulled out my Nintendo Switch and then I was like oh there is no way for me to connect these headphones oh see my Shures to this Nintendo Switch.

1043
00:57:36,285 --> 00:57:38,570
Rym: they're plugged into my phone and I think oh I'm gonna play my Switch.

1044
00:57:38,752 --> 00:57:39,923
Rym: I just plugged them into my Switch.

1045
00:57:39,964 --> 00:57:43,134
Scott: the animatics are normal wired headphones with a wired jack.

1046
00:57:43,195 --> 00:57:45,724
Scott: I could plug them into a Switch or a DS or whatever.

1047
00:57:45,765 --> 00:57:54,530
Scott: it was not so with these wireless headphones with a lightning connector and it's like they connect to your apple watch and your iPhone and your iPad.

1048
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:55,277
Scott: and that's it.

1049
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:56,690
Scott: they don't connect to nothing else.

1050
00:57:56,791 --> 00:57:59,237
Scott: I can't plug them into my computer or anything.

1051
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,227
Scott: so that was very.

1052
00:58:00,267 --> 00:58:01,862
Scott: you know it's like on the one hand.

1053
00:58:01,902 --> 00:58:06,103
Scott: well now I don't have to use that little converter on the bottom of my iPhone which doesn't have a headphone jack.

1054
00:58:06,527 --> 00:58:11,840
Scott: but hey at least with that converter I could detach the converter and use my headphones on a Nintendo Switch.

1055
00:58:12,608 --> 00:58:13,497
Scott: no I can't.

1056
00:58:14,448 --> 00:58:20,729
Scott: so yeah if you use your headphones with anything that is not an apple device you might not want to get these.

1057
00:58:21,315 --> 00:58:22,670
Rym: so I bought some wireless.

1058
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:28,549
Scott: it's like I'm sticking with them cause I got them but I feel like when they did I'm probably not getting them again.

1059
00:58:28,973 --> 00:58:30,710
Rym: yeah I like my Shures.

1060
00:58:30,932 --> 00:58:36,610
Scott: I might even just try to get my Etymotic or Playz now but I did buy a wireless headphone.

1061
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:52,868
Rym: I use the Shures for like normal listening but I have a specific use case of mostly in the winter when it's crappy I will run or bike on a treadmill or exercise bike and I want to listen to music or podcast or like watch Netflix on a tablet while I'm doing so.

1062
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:58,568
Rym: and isolation headphones plus exercise equals weird sweaty air.

1063
00:58:59,471 --> 00:59:05,961
Scott: okay I guess I don't have this problem cause I never wear a headphone while I'm downstairs running for like an hour and a half.

1064
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:07,235
Rym: I don't want to just have nothing.

1065
00:59:08,184 --> 00:59:09,860
Rym: so I bought these like $60 Blue Ant.

1066
00:59:11,735 --> 00:59:17,275
Rym: I don't know what that brand is but these over the year Bluetooth wireless headphones it's one of those cheapo brands.

1067
00:59:17,396 --> 00:59:18,650
Rym: yeah they're like 60 bucks.

1068
00:59:18,872 --> 00:59:19,901
Scott: I had ones like that at work.

1069
00:59:19,941 --> 00:59:27,476
Scott: those are the ones that were difficult to pair but otherwise the ones I bought were August brand and I had them at work and they were actually amazing.

1070
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:32,610
Scott: if once I got them paired and working at work and I would charge them they sounded great.

1071
00:59:32,852 --> 00:59:35,900
Scott: they were actually the most comfortable headphones over ear headphones I've had.

1072
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,385
Scott: it was like a square around my ears so cozy.

1073
00:59:38,729 --> 00:59:42,590
Scott: the reason they died is simply cause they were so cheaply manufactured.

1074
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:46,406
Scott: the plastic band that went over my head cracked like the rig.

1075
00:59:46,547 --> 00:59:51,254
Rym: the rig was so comfortable and then it just snapped in two and I was like well that was pretty much the same situation.

1076
00:59:51,274 --> 00:59:54,750
Rym: so these are made specifically for exercise.

1077
00:59:54,934 --> 00:59:55,607
Scott: those look good.

1078
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:58,929
Rym: so the deal is they're kind of waterproof.

1079
00:59:59,823 --> 01:00:08,310
Rym: so like they're waterproof in fact I wouldn't bring them in the pool but if I sweat on them I can just wipe the sweat off.

1080
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:10,778
Scott: they don't soak in but I wouldn't take them outside.

1081
01:00:12,931 --> 01:00:13,578
Scott: they only get wet.

1082
01:00:14,955 --> 01:00:15,689
Rym: they're sweat proof.

1083
01:00:16,792 --> 01:00:19,090
Scott: I mean I've never had headphones that aren't sweat proof.

1084
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:23,910
Rym: yeah but if they have like foam then your sweat will kind of seep into the foam.

1085
01:00:25,133 --> 01:00:28,075
Rym: there's nothing to seep into two.

1086
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:29,597
Rym: the batteries last a long time.

1087
01:00:29,657 --> 01:00:30,789
Rym: they isolate pretty well.

1088
01:00:31,274 --> 01:00:36,689
Rym: the pairing was interesting though because one I can just plug a three and a quarter inch jack into it.

1089
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:37,821
Scott: yeah that's the kind that I had.

1090
01:00:37,861 --> 01:00:39,682
Rym: yeah so I can plug it into like a device.

1091
01:00:39,824 --> 01:00:43,638
Rym: but also the quick way to pair it is as NFC.

1092
01:00:43,779 --> 01:00:46,310
Rym: I just hold them up to the back of my phone and then my phone goes.

1093
01:00:47,313 --> 01:00:49,479
Scott: we're good to go and it just works.

1094
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:50,269
Scott: mine did not do that.

1095
01:00:50,694 --> 01:00:56,713
Rym: now while they're paired sometimes the Bluetooth just works but you know how Bluetooth is finicky and sometimes it doesn't.

1096
01:00:57,259 --> 01:01:02,894
Rym: if it ever doesn't seem like it's just gonna work all I have to do is hold it up with the NFC and it just instantly works.

1097
01:01:03,642 --> 01:01:06,895
Rym: that was pretty clever and I'm pretty pleased with that aspect of them.

1098
01:01:07,481 --> 01:01:13,260
Rym: the sound quality though is not great because they're cheap but it's good enough for a podcast while I'm like lifting weights for an hour.

1099
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:20,090
Scott: yeah the August Bluetooth ones that I had the sound quality was much better when you plugged them in with a wire than when you used the Bluetooth.

1100
01:01:20,453 --> 01:01:29,466
Scott: the other reason I want the wire on my Shure isolations is that occasionally and I did make sure I was using the right Bluetooth profile it wasn't that that was the problem.

1101
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:34,410
Rym: I do uh like when I'm rejiggering the Geeknight's audio or I'm mastering like a video that I really care about.

1102
01:01:34,794 --> 01:01:53,529
Rym: one thing I will do is I'll play parts of the audio not just with my monitor headphones from the mixer while I'm editing but also from cheap headphones plugged into the mixer and also with my isolation earbuds directly into the mixer to make sure I'm not optimizing to make a poor experience for like a normal person.

1103
01:01:54,410 --> 01:02:05,110
Rym: so if I had like iPhone-y app-ly things the only way to test that would be to like play back the audio that I exported from the editor on an iPhone.

1104
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:06,748
Rym: that would be a pain in the ass.

1105
01:02:07,813 --> 01:02:10,458
Rym: so the fact that it's wired is actually still a use case for me.

1106
01:02:10,498 --> 01:02:13,419
Scott: alright this is long enough and I'm hungry even though there's a lot more things we can talk about.

1107
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:14,022
Scott: yep so I'm gonna skip.

1108
01:02:16,351 --> 01:02:19,158
Scott: there's so much stuff I can talk about but you know give us feedback.

1109
01:02:19,219 --> 01:02:20,778
Rym: was this interesting useful?

1110
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:22,819
Rym: should we do this again cause.

1111
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,849
Rym: this is an easy way to knock out a bunch of Monday episodes.

1112
01:02:26,255 --> 01:02:27,149
Scott: thanks a bunch.

1113
01:02:32,017 --> 01:02:34,257
