1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,521
Rym: It's Monday April 24th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:18,975
Rym: We bring you our live panel about podcasting from Toricon 2006.

3
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:20,057
Scott: let's do this.

4
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,807
Rym: So we're back and we're tired after a long weekend in Rochester.

5
00:00:23,827 --> 00:00:25,873
Scott: Oh Yeah, I'm pretty tired.

6
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:29,044
Scott: Yeah driving how much total driving did I do?

7
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:30,850
Scott: like 600 something miles you drove?

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,160
Rym: 640 miles plus the driving around Rochester.

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,667
Scott: Yeah grumble grumble.

10
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:41,130
Rym: Yeah, screw you I once drove and I say this a lot, but I'm gonna say it again for the perp for all of our listeners out there.

11
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:50,010
Rym: I once drove from Poughkeepsie Which is by New York City to Lansing, Michigan and then two days later drove from Lansing, Michigan to Wildwood, New Jersey.

12
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:51,449
Scott: It's cuz you're stupid.

13
00:00:52,511 --> 00:01:03,509
Rym: Actually was because I finished my co-op and I was technically with IBM and I was technically homeless for a month Not really a month like three weeks almost a month and I could have gone back wherever.

14
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:10,650
Rym: instead I drove out to Michigan to see my family because I hadn't seen him in a while and my brother was going to college And I promised him I'd see him and I couldn't afford to fly.

15
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,189
Rym: I was poor back then but I could afford to drive believe it or not.

16
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:18,629
Rym: And then I went to Wildwood and lived there with our friend Scott Johnson at his beach house for the rest of the summer.

17
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,470
Scott: Yeah, because you could afford to drive after you know, the repoed car.

18
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:31,203
Rym: Yeah, well see that the repoed car was way when I didn't have money Had money if you didn't spend the driving around like an idiot.

19
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:32,630
Rym: now the driving was real cheap.

20
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,806
Rym: It was a lot cheaper than flying and I really couldn't not visit my family.

21
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:36,610
Rym: I hadn't seen him in a while.

22
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,510
Scott: Well, if it were the gas prices what it is now, you'd be in big trouble.

23
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,912
Rym: You know what?

24
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,398
Rym: The gas prices weren't what they are right now.

25
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:42,663
Rym: In fact, they were quite low.

26
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:44,370
Scott: Yeah now it's what I think.

27
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,770
Scott: It's a paid 312 today at the good gas station.

28
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:49,646
Rym: Yeah now it probably would have been cheaper to fly.

29
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:56,410
Rym: if My life as it occurred many years ago occurred in this today who would have thought that jet fuel would be cheaper than car fuel?

30
00:01:56,752 --> 00:02:00,289
Rym: Yeah, I think is that the airline industry isn't doing so well on its own.

31
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:09,175
Rym: Yeah, the jet blue price is actually going up not down but yeah, I got a real cheap flight out to an amazement Which I'm actually looking forward to quite a bit.

32
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:10,180
Scott: When is that?

33
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:13,393
Rym: Oh beginning of May middle of May sometime Maybe end of May.

34
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:13,956
Rym: I don't remember.

35
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:14,960
Rym: I got a plane ticket.

36
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,563
Rym: So I'm going.

37
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,860
Rym: I got to check and make sure and then We should go looking around.

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,553
Scott: Maybe there's like another convention We can go to.

39
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,530
Scott: they're missing maybe like a gaming one or something in the nearby area.

40
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,477
Rym: Well, we can hit ConnectiCon which I hear is really fun.

41
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:28,108
Scott: Isn't it like July or something?

42
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:28,710
Rym: I don't know.

43
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,241
Rym: It's not in my con repertoire.

44
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:35,330
Scott: Yeah I pretty much I was like I've been like within a hair's distance of it.

45
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:45,270
Scott: I think I was at the school with the summer camp the day of the con at one point And I saw like an Inagasha cosplay running around in the field, but I didn't go to the con at all.

46
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:46,475
Scott: I just went home.

47
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:46,976
Rym: Yep.

48
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:51,106
Rym: I mean I go to a lot more cons than you but that's because I started early Like I got hooked.

49
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:59,808
Scott: Yeah, I just you know I won't go very far put a lot of effort into a into a con unless it's Otakon unless I know.

50
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:02,904
Rym: yeah Now you should probably come to Katsucon next year.

51
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:17,417
Rym: It's really good Maybe but I digress cuz today's Monday and tech day and not anime day alright, but since our live show that we did at toricon was about podcasting and not about not Podcasting or anime.

52
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:20,270
Rym: so much it fits, you know tech podcasting.

53
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,847
Scott: Maybe we should have done a show about anime podcasts instead of I don't know.

54
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:27,144
Rym: Oh, well Yeah, our audience seemed to like what we did.

55
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:38,834
Rym: Yeah Okay, so Newsy have in the news New York State had a bit recently and a lot of people are pricing the headline that you can't be fired for surfing the internet While you're at work.

56
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:42,510
Scott: was this the guy who got fired by them by Bloomberg for playing solitaire?

57
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:43,630
Scott: I don't know if I was different guys.

58
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:43,770
Scott: I don't

59
00:03:43,791 --> 00:04:07,770
Rym: know if it was him directly, but he is somewhat related to this that this issue came out partly because of him and basically the judge ruled in this suit that he was wrongfully fired the guy whoever the guy was because Surfing the internet and doing computer things is in this day and age no different From making a personal call while you're at work or reading the newspaper or hanging around the water cooler.

60
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:12,350
Scott: But I thought that New York is one of those states so they can fire you for whatever any reason they want.

61
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:15,648
Rym: Oh, yeah They can except that one company still.

62
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:19,785
Rym: If they're not if they could either give no reason at all or they can give a stated reason.

63
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:25,342
Rym: usually there's a company policy and They'll say like we fired you because you broke corporate instruction 916.

64
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:27,328
Rym: Don't masturbate to pornography in your office.

65
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:36,288
Scott: Hello Well, they can't fire you for discriminatory reasons like you're too old or you're black or we don't like you because you're.

66
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:38,796
Rym: though Here's a nice bit of trivia there.

67
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:43,350
Rym: There is a list of protected classes and you cannot discriminate based on those classes.

68
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:50,293
Rym: However, you can discriminate all you want openly to anyone that is not in one of those classes for any reason that has nothing to Do those classes?

69
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:59,857
Rym: I don't remember them all but you cannot discriminate based on age gender race religion Sexual orientation, but not in all states.

70
00:05:00,018 --> 00:05:04,433
Rym: It's kind of stupid because some people are really backward and prejudice, but I digress Mm-hmm.

71
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:14,729
Rym: However, it is perfectly okay to discriminate based on obesity body body odor Um certain types of appearance.

72
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:26,630
Rym: It's complicated with appearance because you could discriminate against a guy who has say a tattoo of a spider across his face Yeah, but maybe not so much if he claimed that was part of his religion and gets all complicated at that point.

73
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,904
Scott: You said to have a spider my face part of our religion.

74
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:30,747
Scott: Yeah, haha.

75
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:35,420
Rym: But yeah, I think I mean basically a company.

76
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:37,630
Rym: if they're going to fire you they're going to fire you.

77
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:43,630
Scott: I think that a company should be allowed to fire, you know, pretty much whoever they want for almost whatever they want.

78
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,709
Rym: Yep, and it really is that way in New York.

79
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:50,485
Rym: Yeah, some states it isn't but there aren't many non right-to-work states left in this country.

80
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:51,950
Rym: the United States not.

81
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:53,220
Rym: We have a lot of foreign listeners.

82
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,457
Rym: I really got to not be so Us us us.

83
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:58,470
Scott: Yeah, I'd like to know what it's like in other countries.

84
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,196
Scott: Can people just fire anyone they want?

85
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,883
Scott: or is it you know their laws about?

86
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:03,388
Rym: we know how it is in France.

87
00:06:03,549 --> 00:06:05,974
Rym: Nah I mean, I love France.

88
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:10,004
Rym: I'm some would consider me a Francophile, but god damn.

89
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:12,010
Rym: That's not the thing to protest about.

90
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:16,157
Scott: I mean if I could see the u.s.

91
00:06:16,357 --> 00:06:20,568
Scott: Writing like they're firing us for browsing the web and listen to the podcast.

92
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,150
Scott: Let's a riot.

93
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:26,793
Rym: No, we riot when football team loses For all.

94
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:27,214
Scott: they're right.

95
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:28,479
Scott: when the soccer team loses.

96
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,764
Rym: no, they're right thing they write.

97
00:06:29,784 --> 00:06:32,997
Rym: when their football team loses They play real football.

98
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:36,570
Scott: Well, they just call soccer football and we call football football.

99
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:47,009
Rym: Anyway football, I just think the news here is that we here's a judge who?

100
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,761
Rym: Recognizes that the internet is not special.

101
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:56,489
Rym: It's basically become as important and relevant to our lives as the telephone is.

102
00:06:58,171 --> 00:06:58,936
Rym: It's something you just.

103
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:01,189
Rym: it's rare to see a judge who's on top of things.

104
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,958
Scott: Let's find the name of that judge and try to.

105
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,545
Scott: maybe he's a voted judge.

106
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:06,650
Scott: We had might have to vote for him.

107
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:07,677
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

108
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:10,835
Rym: if he'd be in a district where we could vote for him It might be a state judge or something.

109
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:11,256
Scott: I don't know.

110
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:15,190
Scott: Yeah, but either way he should become a one-level-up judge.

111
00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:17,218
Scott: Give him a little green and white mushroom.

112
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:21,937
Rym: Doo doo doo doo Yep, yeah, wait till my thing of the day tomorrow.

113
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:22,841
Scott: Oh, yeah.

114
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:23,483
Scott: Okay.

115
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:24,326
Scott: All right.

116
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:25,150
Rym: So what's your news?

117
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:33,910
Scott: So there's a big news about this Convention in Vegas right now or recently for the National Association of broadcasters.

118
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,545
Scott: hmm, those are like, you know the people who deal with the radio and TV broadcasting and and that shit.

119
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:55,090
Scott: and Apparently a bunch of nerds went there and they came back with some stories and The biggest story apparently is this camera called the big red one or the big red camera or whatever.

120
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:55,667
Rym: Is it red?

121
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,846
Scott: No, but it on the front of it looks really wicked cool.

122
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:10,010
Scott: Like wow all future II and shit Like there's a bunch of holes to mount stuff on it and it's really really professional like this is not something we will ever buy.

123
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:10,896
Rym: Yeah, granted.

124
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:12,930
Rym: We are not camera experts by any stretch.

125
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,844
Scott: This is something for like movie crews and film studios and TV shows.

126
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,850
Rym: I read us off the impressive part the specs.

127
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,866
Scott: Okay Well at first of all The only thing read about it is that it has this red light on the front to make.

128
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:26,209
Scott: that kind of makes it look like how.

129
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:29,878
Scott: So I just want to get that across.

130
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:32,750
Rym: so I'm sorry Dave I will not allow you to film yourself.

131
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:34,549
Rym: I was gonna make a joke about masturbate.

132
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,514
Scott: Yeah, that's the DRM.

133
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:35,856
Scott: is that this?

134
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:36,538
Scott: how is in there?

135
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:40,131
Scott: and if you try to videotape if you because this is a better quality Than your TV.

136
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:46,950
Scott: So if you try to film your TV to copy the video house, like I will not allow you to violate the DMCA.

137
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:50,347
Rym: That's not actually true.

138
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:53,309
Rym: Yeah Just making sure.

139
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:57,363
Scott: If it was I'd be great Just for the hilarity.

140
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:57,909
Scott: Anyway.

141
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:04,610
Scott: Yeah Anyway, so there's a company called red digital cinema and the founder is the same guy who founded Oakley the sunglasses company.

142
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:06,314
Scott: So that's what part I think.

143
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:12,070
Scott: why the camera looks so cool is because you know, Oakley sunglasses look cool They ever tell everyone my law of sunglasses.

144
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:15,822
Rym: You might have but it might not be a recent episode to go nuts.

145
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:20,329
Scott: Oh, so the law just is a little Non sequitur little, you know tangent.

146
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:28,250
Scott: You can go to the like a I don't know the free bins that the Lions have for sunglasses and get sunglasses for free.

147
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:32,227
Scott: You can go to a flea market and get like $2 sunglasses.

148
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:38,577
Scott: You can go to a rest stop and get $10 sunglasses or you can go to like, you know The sporting goods store.

149
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:40,129
Scott: get Oakley's for like 200 bucks.

150
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:47,288
Scott: You can go to like sunglass Hut and get ray-bans for like 500 bucks, right theoretically the sunglasses I have cannot be gotten for any price.

151
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,814
Scott: Theoretically, yes.

152
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:50,161
Rym: Yeah, I told that story.

153
00:09:50,201 --> 00:10:00,662
Scott: So yeah, but The what reason that sunglasses cost more money isn't because you know a sunglass that cost $100 is any better than the $10 Sunglass.

154
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:09,669
Scott: no, no No that the rule is that The more a sunglass cost the greater a percentage of the population will look good in them.

155
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:16,450
Scott: For example the $5 sunglasses from the flea market only look good in a very specific type of old lady.

156
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:37,709
Scott: The $10 sunglasses from the rest stop only look good on people like me and maybe people like, you know average-looking guys the hundred-dollar Oakley's look good on just about anyone who doesn't weigh more than 200 pounds and The $500 ray-bans look good on anyone with a human face.

157
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,435
Scott: That's that's the reason.

158
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:44,130
Scott: more expensive sunglasses are more expensive because they look good on anyone.

159
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:50,650
Rym: Yeah, though don't don't forget that there is a line about below which sunglasses are not only cheap but dangerous.

160
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:58,890
Rym: If you get like cheapo cheapo sunglasses, they're probably non polarized and they're probably not really protecting your eyes from UV rays.

161
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,811
Scott: Yeah, I'm just talking about the price to look good ratio I don't.

162
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:05,390
Scott: we're not talking about the quality of the lens and its sun protection or any of that.

163
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,718
Rym: Are you ever hear of a sunglass called blue blockers?

164
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,480
Scott: No.

165
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:09,062
Rym: All right.

166
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:11,430
Rym: I have a story about blue blockers that I'll say for another day.

167
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:13,257
Scott: Okay, so that's the law of sunglasses.

168
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:17,574
Scott: because just because the guy who founded Oakley founded this camera company Let's get to the camera.

169
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,986
Scott: The camera is an HD digital camera a video.

170
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,756
Scott: it can record 11.4 megapixel.

171
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:28,282
Scott: now I have a. what like a is it?

172
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,686
Scott: it's not even 10.

173
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:31,511
Scott: It's like a 5 or 6.

174
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:33,739
Rym: Yeah, the camera in my phone is a 1.4 megapixel.

175
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,118
Scott: Yeah, so My can my digital camera.

176
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:39,922
Scott: you can go to my flicker.

177
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,329
Scott: actually this toricon photos there.

178
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:47,049
Scott: Not many not many though cuz I suck and I don't use my camera enough that I spent so much money on.

179
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:54,181
Scott: cuz I don't Want to be like a photo guy anyway And you can see is a pretty damn good camera like really high resolution pictures.

180
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:55,665
Scott: This is 11.4 megapixels.

181
00:11:55,705 --> 00:12:03,364
Scott: Holy shit, and it can take 11.4 megapixel pictures.

182
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:08,862
Scott: a second 60s like 60 FPS is holy shit.

183
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:15,690
Scott: considering TV is what like 32 Movies are like nothing.

184
00:12:16,712 --> 00:12:20,347
Scott: So that's like holy crap pictures of digital.

185
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:25,166
Rym: now I think the really amazing thing here is the cost compared to those specs.

186
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:26,310
Scott: Yeah, okay.

187
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,835
Scott: So you have this amazing amazing camera that takes like the most beautiful HD imagery ever.

188
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:39,790
Scott: it also comes with you know, the amazing sensor that lets this happen and You know storage to store all that crazy video and all this shit.

189
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:54,236
Scott: Now normally according to I don't know this because I'm not a camera guy But according to these professional camera guys who went there something like this they expect it to cost, you know $250,000 $200,000 something in the house range, you know get a house for $200,000 got bad.

190
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:04,570
Rym: Yeah, when I wear all over the place the cheapest house anywhere near us is at least half a million.

191
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,117
Scott: That's a really fancy house.

192
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:09,746
Scott: No, no, that's like a four-bedroom or five-bedroom house.

193
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:14,110
Rym: You realize that There's a housing development right near us that has crap.

194
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:18,525
Rym: Oh like subdivision houses the same houses you see in any subdivision suburb anywhere.

195
00:13:19,027 --> 00:13:19,950
Rym: six seven hundred thousand.

196
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:21,517
Scott: Well, that's just nuts.

197
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,290
Rym: Yeah, there's no cheap houses here.

198
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:26,343
Rym: I would kill if this house cost two hundred thousand right now that we're living in.

199
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:28,030
Rym: I'd buy it in a second.

200
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:29,998
Scott: There are two hundred thousand dollar houses.

201
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:30,962
Rym: Yeah, not here.

202
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,275
Scott: Anyway now where we live That's not the point.

203
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:36,843
Scott: The point is is that two hundred thousand dollars is like a house price.

204
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:40,861
Scott: this camera costs Car price.

205
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:41,630
Scott: we're talking $17,500.

206
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:49,621
Rym: Yeah, like definitely not low budget But definitely not high budget like by any means.

207
00:13:49,742 --> 00:14:00,050
Scott: in other words if you were setting up Take to make a movie a digital movie and you know, you're gonna use film You just buy a whole shit ton of these instead of buying one of the normal cameras.

208
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:07,609
Scott: yeah, or if you're gonna make I don't know a Really professional video podcast just scoop one of these babies up.

209
00:14:08,553 --> 00:14:08,813
Scott: You know.

210
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:13,870
Rym: nice easy independent houses art houses little film houses.

211
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:18,049
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna see independent movies looking a lot better if this thing isn't fake.

212
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:27,381
Rym: now I'll point out that there is one big problem with that is that When you have a camera that high quality and you're recording at that high quality The all the other factors become a lot more important.

213
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:36,990
Rym: now the makeup has to be a lot better The lighting has to be a lot better Thing and the framing have to be a lot better, but at the same time couldn't you know, I'm not a I'm not an expert.

214
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,850
Rym: So yeah, I know what you're gonna say because I was just thinking that as I was saying since your image is so perfect Can you just bring it back down?

215
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,410
Scott: Yeah, I figure you could just compress it back down and then all the mistakes go away.

216
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,381
Scott: But then you have a really high quality source material to work with.

217
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:51,510
Rym: Yep, because I know that's how we do it with audio.

218
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:59,532
Scott: Yeah, now I think this thing's like a 30 millimeter lens, but you can buy a 300 millimeter lens for $5,000.

219
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,330
Rym: Now, of course, there's a tiny chance that this is semi vaporware.

220
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:05,663
Scott: Yeah, apparently like it was locked in a cage and shit.

221
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:07,169
Scott: So no one would mess around with it.

222
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:28,653
Scott: But the pictures of it look wicked awesome and if it's real expect awesome things to start showing up in Independent movie theaters and TV shows and all sorts of stuff expect a lot more HDTV Things of the day.

223
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:34,649
Rym: now many of people who know us realize that we're not particularly into that whole alcohol thing.

224
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:39,133
Scott: No alcohol not so good Poison.

225
00:15:39,414 --> 00:15:44,729
Rym: very few of us drink at all and even the ones who drink I mean, I enjoy wine a lot and things like that.

226
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:57,878
Rym: But we our group of friends really doesn't get into that whole standing there holding a red solo cup Culture yeah, and anything, you know more or Somewhat less or sideways from alcohol.

227
00:15:57,938 --> 00:15:58,580
Scott: No one does.

228
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,962
Rym: I don't think anyone smokes weed or smokes or no one we're really friends with currently does any drugs.

229
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:11,623
Rym: a few people did in the past and Interesting stories as a result, but drugs are bad and gay.

230
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,810
Rym: Well, the thing is I mean, I enjoy alcohol.

231
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,905
Rym: I really like wine and sake and that sort of thing now.

232
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:20,643
Rym: I Really don't like dealing with people who are drunk.

233
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:22,925
Scott: I Don't like being drunk.

234
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,920
Scott: Of course I've never been drunk because I don't drink.

235
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,549
Scott: but yeah, I know I don't like it.

236
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:33,666
Rym: I've been drunk and there's a level of drunkenness that is fun and it is not very much drunkenness because beyond that it is not fun.

237
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:38,684
Scott: If I'm eating no good, yeah, I mean you vomited everyone's vomited.

238
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:40,329
Scott: Yeah, it's not nice.

239
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:47,192
Scott: So why don't vomit if you if you vomited on by accident or because he ate something bad or because you were sick with like The flu.

240
00:16:47,393 --> 00:16:57,235
Rym: Yeah now don't do it on purpose and more importantly don't do to yourself What the guy in the video that is my thing of the day did Don't want to be this guy.

241
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:59,743
Scott: I mean, I'm never gonna be that guy.

242
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:10,560
Rym: I mean god damn it's funny Because this guy's drunk and he can't stand up and some kid has like a handicam and he's just filming it and The guy just can't stand up.

243
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:11,426
Rym: He's so drunk.

244
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:18,624
Scott: Yeah, I guess not being able to stand up is a little better than vomiting.

245
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:28,263
Scott: I imagine whoever he is already vomited copiously Perhaps but perhaps he is such an old Disgruntled drunken hobo that he doesn't vomit anymore.

246
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:32,221
Rym: Haha It just kind of oozes out of him and turns into those clothes.

247
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:34,470
Rym: Hobos wear exactly not hobos winos.

248
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:36,615
Rym: Some hobos are cool.

249
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:39,185
Scott: I think hobos technically are the people who do work.

250
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,290
Scott: So I don't think he was a hobo.

251
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:40,993
Scott: I think he's a bum.

252
00:17:41,414 --> 00:17:43,502
Rym: I think he was just like, uh, you know what?

253
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,589
Rym: He's probably a former college frat guy.

254
00:17:48,671 --> 00:17:51,962
Scott: He ended up homeless, how do you go from college to homeless?

255
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,286
Rym: alcohol?

256
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:58,180
Rym: Oh Pund Yeah, I mean definitely we're not prohibitionists.

257
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,546
Rym: We're not against alcohol.

258
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:00,289
Rym: I hate him.

259
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,694
Rym: Yeah freedom random.

260
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:07,895
Rym: But uh, yeah, if you're like this guy, I'm not going to help you off the street Nor will I respect you?

261
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:08,737
Scott: Yeah.

262
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:15,615
Scott: Yeah or possibly even talk to you or recognize your existence as a worthwhile Living organism.

263
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:20,709
Scott: Yeah, the the the bacteria on my foot might get more respect.

264
00:18:21,492 --> 00:18:23,438
Rym: Perhaps bacteria are dangerous little bastards.

265
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:25,906
Scott: They are they are they don't get drunk.

266
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:26,407
Scott: They're smart.

267
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:29,214
Scott: Yep Not getting drunk.

268
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:33,590
Scott: All right, so I'm sure everyone has played the types of video games.

269
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,117
Scott: You know where you walk sideways.

270
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,182
Scott: and yeah, you beat things up.

271
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:42,150
Rym: Final Fight River City Ransom Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and 3 and Streets of Rage Simpsons.

274
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:49,092
Scott: Oh, isn't it 6?

275
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:51,190
Scott: It was four for the little one and six for the big.

276
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,938
Rym: Yeah, it's just the one with two screens.

277
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:55,570
Rym: that's right and a bunch of nerds with a pile of quarters.

278
00:18:56,152 --> 00:18:57,938
Scott: I think there was also a cheap for the cheap.

279
00:18:58,078 --> 00:18:59,905
Scott: arcades had the four-person version.

280
00:18:59,945 --> 00:19:01,209
Scott: We had to crowd around one TV.

281
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:03,126
Scott: Yeah, that one wasn't so good.

282
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:06,756
Scott: Anyway Some guy made an animation.

283
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:13,598
Scott: It appears to be that he made it with flash, but it's an MPEG if you download it and He created it.

284
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:14,142
Scott: What is this?

285
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:15,410
Scott: an animated short?

286
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:18,380
Scott: Which is just like one of those games.

287
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:19,424
Rym: only it's not a game.

288
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:20,046
Scott: it's not.

289
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:21,070
Scott: it's not really a game.

290
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:22,019
Rym: I tell him the title.

291
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:29,670
Scott: Oh my god, it's pirate babies cabana battle street fight.

292
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,498
Rym: That is probably the best title.

293
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:36,811
Scott: or is it super ever had a battle street fight 2006?

294
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:40,089
Rym: All I got to say is pirate baby is an awesome villain.

295
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,084
Scott: Yeah, this I didn't know.

296
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,830
Scott: I Was told the name of this and then I said this better live up to the name.

297
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:59,031
Rym: Yes, two of our listeners sent me links to this last night But since I was dead from Tarakhan I hadn't even looked at him yet and then I Scott showed this to me and then I realized that that's what you'd link me To.

298
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:03,330
Scott: yeah, everyone had seen this already probably while we were away for the weekend.

299
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,909
Scott: But yeah, I would have probably seen it yesterday if I was home.

300
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:14,447
Scott: But you know, we wouldn't do a show till Monday anyway, and even if everyone's seen it This is just so good that even if one person out there has not seen this yet.

301
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:14,929
Scott: They got to go.

302
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:26,243
Rym: yeah, because there are some videos we have that are from the internet that if we if all of our friends 20 of us 30 of us are sitting around in our living room and One person says, huh badger mushroom.

303
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:26,625
Rym: What now?

304
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:27,448
Rym: I never seen that.

305
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:29,636
Rym: Or NASA.

306
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:30,563
Rym: Well, who's NASA?

307
00:20:30,784 --> 00:20:35,060
Rym: it is cold We all we suddenly jump to the TV turn out the computer and watch it.

308
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:37,490
Scott: yep, you don't know what radis skull is.

309
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:38,514
Scott: Oh my god.

310
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:51,490
Rym: All right, as an aside if any of you out there don't know who radis skull is rad Is ku ll as in I am the radis skull and I will kill you one by one just for fun.

311
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:56,583
Scott: Yeah, so this video way cool if you like.

312
00:20:56,684 --> 00:20:58,210
Scott: walk sideways beat-em-up games.

313
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:10,450
Scott: there's a lot of things in here that are total cliches like the video screen in the back with the repeating image of the villain and You know the way the bosses work and the weapons and the special it.

314
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:21,278
Scott: There's a really the thing that keeps you going because it would get kind of boring but they keep doing different special attacks that are all humorous in some way and The graphics are really authentic.

315
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:31,736
Scott: if if monochrome it is definitely an homage Super homage, I mean you'll even notice stuff in there like the Megaman octopus and Such and the Christopher Walken.

316
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:34,043
Rym: Oh Christopher Walken my hero.

317
00:21:34,524 --> 00:21:36,490
Scott: So if you haven't seen this go watch it.

318
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,854
Scott: It's freaking awesome.

319
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:40,782
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of cowbell in this game too much cowbell.

320
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:47,526
Rym: In fact, so moving on to the main bit We're actually going to play since we realized that we went to torque on over the weekend.

321
00:21:47,546 --> 00:21:50,964
Rym: as we've said many times I know I didn't just realize that I went to torque on.

322
00:21:51,045 --> 00:22:00,070
Rym: I realized that The show we recorded live in front of a real audience at torque on Had nothing to do with anime and we basically just talked about podcasting.

323
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,370
Scott: Yeah, so why would we play it on Thursday when we have plenty of things to talk about on Thursday?

324
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,057
Scott: I mean Wednesday as a boat.

325
00:22:07,097 --> 00:22:11,554
Scott: Yeah as opposed to Monday when we don't have Ideas awesome.

326
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:17,410
Rym: So I suppose without further ado here it is our live show from torque on entirely unedited.

327
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:18,788
Scott: Oh my god.

328
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:31,192
Rym: So, uh, I'm Rym, I'm Scott and this is GeekNights, let's do this All right.

329
00:22:31,674 --> 00:22:36,770
Rym: I'd like to say that this is our first stop on the first ever GeekNights tour of nowhere.

330
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:37,575
Rym: Well, actually we're going.

331
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:38,904
Scott: we're going to Otakon.

332
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:41,538
Rym: Yeah, we're been invited As panelists.

333
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:42,201
Rym: an amazement.

334
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:42,965
Rym: we're doing a show.

335
00:22:42,985 --> 00:22:43,728
Rym: Well, I'm doing a show.

336
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:46,550
Rym: Katsucon found out that we were there last year.

337
00:22:46,851 --> 00:22:53,629
Rym: We are now guests of Katsucon next year and we're gonna be running part of the video game room possibly Yep, so at least we got a show going there.

338
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:58,010
Scott: Yeah, and all the other conventions that we may or may not go to as we desire.

339
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:01,545
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, uh, we do a podcast.

340
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:02,750
Rym: now at any you listen to podcasts.

341
00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:05,307
Rym: Any idea what a podcast is?

342
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,050
Rym: ever heard the word podcast?

343
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:15,610
Rym: alright a Podcast is basically just internet radio, which has been around for a long time only done.

344
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:18,189
Rym: Well, it actually works and a lot of people are starting to use it.

345
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,910
Scott: Yeah in the olden days you've wanted to listen to radio on the internet.

346
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,215
Scott: it was pretty much streaming.

347
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:27,929
Scott: you had to go at the time they were talking and push a button and Who knows if it would work or not?

348
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,963
Scott: It was real media and the quality was low and you couldn't hear anything.

349
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:32,926
Scott: Sometimes it wouldn't even work.

350
00:23:33,348 --> 00:23:35,924
Rym: It was just terrible Yeah, and it really didn't take off at all.

351
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:43,517
Rym: So Apple and their infinite wisdom decided to push this thing called podcasting which when I heard about it I thought it sounded stupid because I didn't really understand it.

352
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:47,570
Scott: Yeah, it was actually not invented by Apple is the actual technology behind.

353
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,083
Scott: It was made by some other people a little earlier, but no one cares.

354
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:51,510
Rym: Yeah, it has very little to do.

355
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,416
Rym: You don't need an iPod.

356
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:53,242
Rym: You don't need iTunes.

357
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:54,249
Rym: Don't even need to like Apple.

358
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,917
Scott: You just need a computer.

359
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:58,549
Rym: all it is is syndicated audio or even video.

360
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:11,366
Rym: basically You subscribe to a feed which we could talk on length about that and then anytime whatever the feed is updates you get the mp3 File or whatever file it is automatically downloaded to whatever computer mp3 player you have.

361
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:13,733
Rym: so gig nights We are four nights a week.

362
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:18,689
Rym: So every weeknight a new gig nights episode appears around midnight one depending on when we finish.

363
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:25,669
Scott: Yet, so it's really just mp3s that you download that someone makes it's really all it is.

364
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:33,582
Scott: Yes with a fancy name with the word pod in it in to make it Harder to get people to listen because they think oh I need an iPod.

365
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:34,987
Scott: No, you don't need an iPod.

366
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:40,050
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I mean some of the big podcasts have what 50 60 thousand listeners.

367
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,736
Scott: I think there's some company.

368
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:45,730
Scott: they said their goal is to get like 500 million total podcast listeners in the world.

369
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,910
Scott: I don't know how close they are to getting that but there's a whole lot of people.

370
00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:55,769
Rym: Yeah I mean I'd really say that I mean you all know the webcomic boom how mega Tokyo got popular and Exploded and then webcomics exploded.

371
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:02,510
Rym: Podcasts are probably about a year or two right before where mega Tokyo and all that was before webcomics exploded.

372
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:05,329
Rym: So it's kind of a niche market and it's gonna explode one day.

373
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:11,490
Scott: It's like when it first came about, you know, some people got into it and then iTunes actually implemented podcast support.

374
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:24,050
Scott: So then it exploded some more and now it's kind of gradually growing as like real companies make Podcasts like penny arcade just came out with one that like jumped to number 12. that beats out like ESPN and stuff.

375
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:24,895
Rym: It's Penn Jillette.

376
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:26,424
Rym: if Penn & Teller has a podcast.

377
00:25:26,444 --> 00:25:27,370
Rym: That's fairly awesome.

378
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,970
Scott: Yeah, well, he does like a real radio show one hour every day every weekday.

379
00:25:32,171 --> 00:25:38,644
Scott: So he just he got his radio company to start putting those on the internet and he took the ads out Which makes it a lot more pleasant to listen to.

380
00:25:38,785 --> 00:25:40,716
Rym: yep now I mean, it's basically like radio.

381
00:25:40,837 --> 00:25:41,862
Rym: Usually it's talk radio.

382
00:25:41,882 --> 00:25:43,530
Rym: A lot of people do techno or music.

383
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,341
Rym: There's actually a lot of good music out there like normal radio.

384
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:48,810
Rym: They'll play techno from South Africa or something cool like that.

385
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,634
Scott: Yeah, that's one.

386
00:25:49,654 --> 00:25:53,150
Scott: My favorite podcast is what I think it's Derek the Bandit Sound Republic.

387
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:55,349
Scott: All it is is electronic music from South Africa.

388
00:25:55,892 --> 00:26:06,010
Scott: This guy's in Johannesburg South Africa taking his techno music and other people's techno music and like every once in a while He makes one big mp3 of it and you get it automatically and then you listen in the car.

389
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:11,126
Rym: It's great And I mean a lot of the content is creative commons or free or there's no copyright involved.

390
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:13,990
Rym: so you can just play it Share it whatever and the artists really don't care.

391
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:22,610
Scott: Yeah You get in big trouble if you put like real music like if I went and got like the Beatles music and put in my Podcast and they found out I get sued sued sued sued.

392
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:26,864
Scott: So what you do is there's all these musical artists who are you know independent?

393
00:26:26,904 --> 00:26:37,260
Scott: Maybe they're really local to one area and To get you know their music out there in the world is they say hey everyone if you want to podcast my music go for It and it's called pod safe music and that's what most people use.

394
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:40,913
Scott: because then you won't get sued and you help out some independent Artists somewhere.

395
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:42,823
Rym: Yeah, but I mean we don't play music.

396
00:26:42,863 --> 00:26:44,210
Rym: I don't listen to any of the music podcast.

397
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,489
Rym: We just do a talk show get nights a late-night talk show for geeks.

398
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:53,540
Rym: Think like the late show or late night with whoever whoever only with us.

399
00:26:55,636 --> 00:26:57,599
Scott: And Not so often is there a guest?

400
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,206
Rym: Yeah, every now and then we get guests.

401
00:26:59,247 --> 00:27:02,166
Rym: We really haven't had any big guests yet Though we've had some big names.

402
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:04,160
Rym: agree to future interviews?

403
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:08,473
Scott: Yeah, it's the technology really behind interviews is a little tricky sometimes.

404
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,380
Rym: Yeah, we can answer anything like that in questions.

405
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,619
Rym: I don't know how much you care about the technical details of trying to interview someone far off in a way.

406
00:27:15,162 --> 00:27:18,099
Rym: Though our best guest so far was how many of you know Mike Pfeffer?

407
00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:20,859
Rym: Alright, how many of you know Jewish wolf would?

408
00:27:21,861 --> 00:27:23,650
Scott: Jewish would is Mike Pfeffer.

409
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:27,343
Rym: He doesn't like to be known as Jewish wolf would It actually?

410
00:27:27,404 --> 00:27:30,296
Rym: he asked us specifically not to refer to him as Jewish wolf would be

411
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:30,577
Scott: referred

412
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:31,180
Scott: to him as Jewish

413
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,475
Scott: Wolf would only once in the recorded part of the show.

414
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:38,633
Rym: Yep But anyway, we decided to do this partly because we went to RIT.

415
00:27:38,673 --> 00:27:39,355
Rym: We both graduated.

416
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:41,160
Rym: I ran this anime club for three years.

417
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:43,184
Rym: I Founded the cosplay.

418
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:48,319
Rym: that happened right this time the year before Tora Khan was founded the next year by the president after me.

419
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:50,104
Rym: So we've been around a while.

420
00:27:50,124 --> 00:27:54,439
Rym: we both graduated all our friends graduated and we always talked about doing a radio show.

421
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:57,531
Rym: Well, well friends talked about.

422
00:27:57,631 --> 00:28:05,625
Rym: our original idea was a little different Yeah But it was basically we would sit around and talk and people who didn't know us would laugh a lot At the things we said.

423
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:06,629
Scott: looking at some people out there.

424
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,400
Rym: Yeah, like they were just it was hysterical to them.

425
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,658
Rym: We couldn't figure out why and people always said you should just record yourselves do a radio show.

426
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:19,700
Scott: So one day, you know when I got my little nano You know actually used iTunes because the stupid work laptop with windows.

427
00:28:20,021 --> 00:28:20,924
Scott: Yeah, we don't use windows.

428
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:25,581
Scott: But you know, I discovered how look I'll actually try this podcasting thing and I was like You know what?

429
00:28:25,943 --> 00:28:27,991
Scott: It's real easy to make one of these damn podcasts.

430
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:28,914
Scott: Let's freakin do it.

431
00:28:29,135 --> 00:28:31,865
Rym: Yep, and shit talk I love audio and all that stuff.

432
00:28:31,885 --> 00:28:36,160
Rym: So I immediately went out and bought a bunch of professional equipment and it's not that professional.

433
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:40,120
Rym: I mean as professional as we're ever gonna get unless we get syndicated by someone with money.

434
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,098
Scott: It's as professional as pretty much anyone needs.

435
00:28:43,312 --> 00:28:48,914
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so if you want to make a podcast which you might or might not want to do depending.

436
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:54,000
Scott: all you really need like minimum Is a microphone and a computer an Apple computer?

437
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,040
Scott: It makes it a lot easier if you don't know about technology because then you can use garage band garage band.

438
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,651
Rym: Hit a button your podcast appears in iTunes.

439
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:10,320
Scott: Yeah, it's dead stupid If you have an Apple computer, if you don't have an Apple computer, it's a little bit trickier, but whatever.

440
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:15,520
Rym: But there are a lot of podcasts out there that are just like one dude ranting about Linux or one, dude.

441
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,865
Rym: There's a podcast for everything.

442
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:17,809
Rym: What was the weird one?

443
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:20,580
Rym: We found it was a South African housing market.

444
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:21,824
Scott: No, that was the Australian.

445
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:23,689
Scott: There's an Australian real estate podcast.

446
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:27,942
Scott: Yeah, there's a very popular podcast only about knitting like Knitting.

447
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:34,260
Scott: Yeah, and it's it's old ladies talking about knitting and knitting techniques and all this or their freaking radio shows about everything.

448
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,732
Scott: There's one where it's just independent music from Scotland.

449
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:39,920
Scott: Yeah, it's very very popular.

450
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:41,226
Rym: It'll make you feel really rich.

451
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,560
Rym: It's this guy and he summarizes the New York Times for you every day.

452
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,364
Scott: Well, it's actually yet.

453
00:29:45,726 --> 00:29:48,040
Scott: That's actually made by the New York Times.

454
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,582
Scott: It's a new.

455
00:29:48,642 --> 00:29:53,280
Scott: it's an official New York Times podcast and the guy summarizes the front page of every second.

456
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:56,559
Rym: You've got like a little butler sitting there just reading it to you while you're having your morning coffee.

457
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:00,320
Scott: The onion radio news is also pretty good.

458
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:08,038
Scott: This guy comes on with like a two-minute podcast every day Just reading like the headline of an onion story in a quick summary and it's much funnier than reading the actual onion.

459
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:10,319
Rym: because yes The onions I guess is degraded over the years.

460
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:18,520
Rym: Yeah Now they're also videocast which are the same just with video Except it's a lot harder to do video for reasons that a lot of RIT students probably know very well.

461
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:23,236
Scott: Yeah, some of the popular video podcasts a ninja ask a ninja has a ninja.

462
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:24,240
Scott: ask a ninja is hilarious.

463
00:30:24,803 --> 00:30:27,156
Rym: If any of you've never heard of ask a ninja I recommend checking them out.

464
00:30:27,176 --> 00:30:27,839
Scott: ask a ninja calm.

465
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,146
Rym: It's a dude dressed up like a ninja answering questions.

466
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:30,808
Scott: That's it.

467
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,195
Rym: Like ask a ninja.

468
00:30:33,235 --> 00:30:34,078
Rym: How do you kill someone?

469
00:30:34,338 --> 00:30:38,299
Scott: Well How fast do you want me to kill them and how painfully you know?

470
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:40,598
Scott: I look forward to killing you soon.

471
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:50,814
Scott: Yeah But now that homestar runner actually converted to like video podcast format now so you can just subscribe to strong bads email Whenever there's a new strong bad email just it shows up and you watch it.

472
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:51,899
Scott: You don't have to do anything.

473
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:54,954
Scott: You don't have to visit homestar runner every damn day now.

474
00:30:54,994 --> 00:30:56,864
Rym: We'd like to talk a lot about the show We do now.

475
00:30:56,984 --> 00:31:02,820
Rym: I mean we're recording this now and we're gonna put it on the air next Wednesday on anime day Wednesday Wednesday night.

476
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:09,066
Scott: So it's really Thursday for normal people unless you sit up all night and wait and then it like around midnight 1 a.m Just there.

477
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:13,600
Rym: it is because that was the big idea We had is every podcast updates like Monday morning and it's usually once a week.

478
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:18,118
Rym: So we update at night and you know, it's a late show, but those shows are recorded like Sunday at 11 a.m.

479
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:22,392
Rym: So we actually record at night mostly because we have jobs and we're lazy.

480
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:29,634
Scott: Yeah, so while our show we say Monday night Tuesday night Wednesday night Thursday night It's really Tuesday morning Wednesday morning Thursday morning Friday.

481
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:37,989
Rym: Oh some of our fans I sit there and I'm doing post-production late at night and suddenly right around midnight when I start getting messages Hey, the show's not up yet something wrong.

482
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:40,239
Rym: Hey, where's my show?

483
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:44,560
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but actually we're pretty consistent.

484
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:50,143
Rym: We've missed what one show or something cuz I was at it missed one other show because I screwed up and deleted it after we Recorded it.

485
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:51,271
Scott: That's right.

486
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:52,338
Scott: You forget.

487
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:58,387
Rym: Yeah Yeah, well we did another show But actually that's the worst we lost.

488
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:06,117
Scott: we lost half the show and what we did is we put the half the show we still Had up on the internet and then we put a sorry Rym deleted it thing in the other half.

489
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,807
Rym: cuz honestly I mean we just talk and talk and talk.

490
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:14,379
Rym: but imagine if you had to do something like taught to give a speech on the fly And then you had to give it again.

491
00:32:14,883 --> 00:32:16,980
Rym: You really don't have the energy to say the same things.

492
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,571
Rym: Like if I crack a joke, I can't crack the same joke again.

493
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:21,479
Rym: And if I try it just sounds stupid.

494
00:32:21,962 --> 00:32:24,780
Rym: So if we lose an episode, we're just done we cry and go to sleep.

495
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,540
Scott: It's our podcast really isn't scripted or written like beforehand so we can't just read it again.

496
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:39,895
Scott: It's you know We just bring up whatever topic it is and then we just talk and then if we've already had the discussion How can we have the same discussion again and have it be so genuine?

497
00:32:39,935 --> 00:32:41,160
Scott: It would just be us going.

498
00:32:42,582 --> 00:32:43,264
Rym: Yeah, yep.

499
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:54,832
Rym: So uh, so yeah, that's so we actually force ourselves to not talk about things We're gonna talk about on the show like if there's news about I don't know Microsoft CEO kills Someone and a baby ninja.

500
00:32:54,893 --> 00:32:56,160
Rym: I don't know something crazy.

501
00:32:56,542 --> 00:33:00,400
Rym: We acknowledge that the news exists, but we won't talk about it till we turn the mics on at night.

502
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:04,019
Scott: We usually what we talked about before is we'll be like, alright Do we want to do this one or that one?

503
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:10,267
Scott: You know because it's really hard to pick two news stories a day because some days there's like 20 news stories And it's like oh my god, which two are the best.

504
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:13,080
Scott: and some days is like all this news is boring as hell.

505
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,776
Rym: Yeah, the news that other people that was important people bothers about it until we talk about it.

506
00:33:17,937 --> 00:33:20,201
Rym: Yeah like to no end Mmm.

507
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,360
Rym: now we really could talk a lot about how we do the show and the show itself.

508
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:33,352
Rym: But first before we get into that You guys have any questions about podcasting Podcasts everyone is you can come up here and get on the air with us if you like or you can just ask your question And we'll do our thing.

509
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:36,957
Rym: Why don't you?

510
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:38,122
Rym: we had a mic right here?

511
00:33:38,162 --> 00:33:39,589
Rym: We're we're on ball run the ball.

512
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,309
Scott: So I was wondering how long?

513
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,149
Rym: between when you record your?

514
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:51,950
Scott: Well, okay for us it's different than most people.

515
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:57,027
Scott: Yeah, we pretty much record it and then Rym starts editing it and then he puts it on the internet that night.

516
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:59,498
Rym: Yep Well, it most podcast.

517
00:33:59,518 --> 00:34:08,900
Rym: they'll record over the course of like four hours and they'll do like a show once a week or once a month and then they'll spend hours and hours editing and cutting down until They make like this thing that they can put up.

518
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,690
Rym: We really don't edit.

519
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:14,860
Rym: What do you hear is exactly what we said cutting out like when Scott burps.

520
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:16,965
Scott: do we cut out burps coughs?

521
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:23,554
Scott: Um, like um, like Yeah, those are big long pauses Anything like that.

522
00:34:23,574 --> 00:34:25,303
Scott: we cut out, but we don't cut out anything.

523
00:34:25,342 --> 00:34:26,630
Scott: we say that's English words.

524
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:27,393
Rym: Now it used to.

525
00:34:27,414 --> 00:34:30,670
Rym: when we first started it took me about two hours to do the post-production.

526
00:34:31,272 --> 00:34:40,562
Rym: I mean I had to run all these filters dynamic range compression and normalization, which if anyone wants to know I can go to Excruciating painful detail about and then we bought this machine.

527
00:34:40,902 --> 00:34:44,177
Rym: Yes, then we bought this machine here Which took all that out of the equation.

528
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:46,547
Rym: so now and now I've gotten good at editing.

529
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:54,453
Rym: it takes about 20 minutes total and that includes the time it takes to encode it to mp3 on my slow ass computer that I bought six and Years ago, yeah

530
00:34:54,493 --> 00:35:05,910
Scott: right now the major things that take a lot of time are his slow ass computer and uploading the file and then waiting for the stupid Hosting company to get the file and get it properly set up and then typing up the notes for the show.

531
00:35:06,131 --> 00:35:08,769
Scott: So yeah, that's the hard part which isn't hard.

532
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:16,130
Rym: Normally just we do four shows a week Which is kind of crazy like we have more episodes than friggin any other podcast out there with a few exceptions.

533
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:19,142
Scott: Yeah, there are podcasts that are like old way older than us.

534
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:21,471
Scott: how long we've been going since I got since over of 2005?

535
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:22,478
Rym: it's over 2005 four nights a week.

536
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:29,409
Rym: So we've got 97 episodes up plus the 11 beta episodes that none of you will ever hear.

537
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:36,530
Scott: Yeah, you're never gonna hear those but their podcast been going since like 2004 which is when it really started.

538
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:39,250
Scott: But they have like a hundred episodes maybe even less.

539
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,676
Scott: There's something like 20 episodes.

540
00:35:40,696 --> 00:35:42,243
Scott: you do one a month or something like that.

541
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:43,870
Scott: We already we're coming up on a hundred.

542
00:35:44,172 --> 00:35:45,261
Scott: Yeah, what number is this one?

543
00:35:45,322 --> 00:35:46,410
Rym: This is gonna be 90.

544
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,478
Rym: Well, this is gonna be 101 cuz it'll be later.

545
00:35:48,498 --> 00:35:48,658
Rym: Yeah.

546
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:51,990
Rym: All right any questions anyone you want to come up you wanna.

547
00:35:53,992 --> 00:35:56,050
Rym: So we've got Kate here who's walking up toward the state.

548
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,250
Rym: I don't wanna have dead air cuz that means I have to cut it out later.

549
00:35:58,953 --> 00:36:01,382
Rym: I really hate having to edit so I try to avoid it at all cost.

550
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:01,784
Rym: Yes.

551
00:36:01,824 --> 00:36:03,210
Rym: It's on just talk unless she turned it off.

552
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:06,129
Rym: Is there any subject that's completely off-limits?

553
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:14,861
Rym: considering the episode we did last Thursday, you know Here's the thing about aim and nothing is out of bounds.

554
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:15,987
Scott: well at least for us.

555
00:36:16,027 --> 00:36:18,723
Scott: you see the thing about Podcasting is there's no rating system.

556
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:19,710
Scott: There's no nothing like that.

557
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:28,440
Scott: But on iTunes specifically there's this explicit tag and you can't really it sucks because you can't put in a split Explicit tag on just one episode.

558
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:35,427
Scott: your I your podcast is either explicit Which means it's really dirty and you talk about sex and drugs and violence and God knows what.

559
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:36,090
Rym: there are a lot of.

560
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:38,136
Scott: There are quite a few.

561
00:36:38,217 --> 00:36:40,785
Scott: that sees there does a Nazi podcast out there?

562
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:42,310
Rym: wait Nazi is a neo-nazi.

563
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,383
Scott: No, as in it's a yelling white supremacist guy.

564
00:36:44,404 --> 00:36:48,366
Scott: Oh Yeah, and everyone like demanded he'd be taken off a bunch of lists.

565
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:49,130
Scott: It's a crazy story.

566
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,042
Scott: Anyway, there are other podcasts which are just nothing.

567
00:36:52,062 --> 00:36:58,066
Scott: they're playing which means they might say shit They might say whatever but you know, they were rated between pg-13 and our.

568
00:36:58,247 --> 00:36:58,990
Scott: yeah for our show.

569
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:04,564
Scott: Yeah Um, but other shows, you know, we're just mostly normal.

570
00:37:04,644 --> 00:37:08,990
Scott: now if your show is guaranteed You're never gonna curse, you know, you're gonna bleep out all the bad stuff.

571
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,918
Scott: You're gonna cut out anything little kids shouldn't hear.

572
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,950
Scott: you can put a clean tag on it and that can't put the clean tag.

573
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,570
Scott: We can't put the clean tag, but we don't put the explicit tag either.

574
00:37:19,352 --> 00:37:20,429
Rym: It's like a magic word.

575
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,415
Scott: Yeah, you see it's not.

576
00:37:22,656 --> 00:37:27,542
Scott: if you put on a real radio show the FCC can come down and you like a ton of bricks If you say fuck.

577
00:37:28,228 --> 00:37:33,790
Scott: Oh But if you just put an mp3 somewhere for people to download what are they gonna do to you?

578
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,959
Scott: Yeah, you can say whatever the hell you want now.

579
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:36,843
Rym: I mean it is GeekNights.

580
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:37,225
Rym: We're geeks.

581
00:37:37,245 --> 00:37:38,350
Rym: We talk about geekery.

582
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:46,682
Rym: so we basically broke it up into four like days of the week and the scary thing is that each one of our days is Pretty much a full-on podcast by itself.

583
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:48,150
Rym: are like Mondays.

584
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,859
Rym: We do science technology Linux all that sort of stuff.

585
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,009
Rym: Tuesdays are gaming video gaming board games all that.

586
00:37:54,571 --> 00:38:01,441
Rym: Wednesdays are anime and manga and comics and despite the fact that it's just one day of the week for us It's pretty much the biggest anime podcast out there.

587
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,090
Scott: Well, it's not the biggest one out.

588
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,150
Rym: Yeah, we shuffle between number one number two and number three on Yahoo podcasts for anime.

589
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,770
Scott: Yeah, Yahoo podcasts are just a little sketchy, but another good one.

590
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,357
Rym: I'll recommend them right now and give them a shout out.

591
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:14,210
Rym: anime world order is really good anime world order.

592
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:19,989
Scott: These people like they're older school fans than we are and they're a little fanboy and fangirl.

593
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:20,150
Rym: ish.

594
00:38:21,595 --> 00:38:24,083
Scott: But at the same time they know everything.

595
00:38:24,143 --> 00:38:29,180
Scott: like we did an episode about Lupin and We pretty much got everything wrong except Zenigata.

596
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:38,358
Scott: So the guy sends me this giant email telling me Excruciating details about every other character and all this stuff that we missed and I was like, okay You guys know everything about anime is to know.

597
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,105
Rym: now Thursdays.

598
00:38:40,165 --> 00:38:41,510
Rym: We decide we couldn't come up with anything.

599
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:45,689
Rym: So we decided it's like special topics, which means whatever the hell we want to talk about.

600
00:38:46,275 --> 00:38:47,449
Rym: Usually we rant about things.

601
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:50,179
Rym: Sometimes we do interesting things like last Thursday.

602
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:53,330
Scott: Yeah, some of our most popular Thursdays were like toys of our youth.

603
00:38:53,752 --> 00:38:57,690
Rym: Yeah, that episode has been linked to more than other than with one exception is our most linked to episode.

604
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,116
Scott: Yeah, TV shows of our youth.

605
00:38:59,317 --> 00:39:00,744
Rym: Yeah, we talked about Thundercats once.

606
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:02,090
Scott: how not to suck at college.

607
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:02,753
Scott: How not to.

608
00:39:02,793 --> 00:39:03,557
Scott: that's one of our things.

609
00:39:03,597 --> 00:39:04,280
Scott: how not to suck.

610
00:39:04,682 --> 00:39:06,069
Scott: Yeah, how to not suck.

611
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,275
Rym: Right grammar captain.

612
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:09,559
Scott: grammar captain Graham.

613
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:09,780
Scott: Mr.

614
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,864
Rym: Perry will be all over you.

615
00:39:11,045 --> 00:39:12,410
Scott: Maybe you will all right.

616
00:39:12,571 --> 00:39:19,309
Rym: It looks like someone in the audience is excited to ask a question So I guess he can come up and grab a mic unless he's not willing to step up to the challenge.

617
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,328
Scott: He's planning on asking a question, but we got him.

618
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:26,049
Rym: We have always had this question for you.

619
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:30,950
Rym: Oh, how how do you get that perfect European hair of yours to stay ever so beautiful?

620
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:38,602
Rym: Well one herbal essences Conditioner - I condition twice.

621
00:39:38,622 --> 00:39:39,928
Scott: don't you do something else of the conditioning?

622
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:42,090
Rym: I'm a homies fan.

623
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:48,510
Rym: I would refer to you to previous Thursdays episode if you want to know more about that topic.

624
00:39:48,591 --> 00:39:50,327
Scott: How many times are we gonna beat around this bush?

625
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:53,494
Rym: That's are you?

626
00:39:53,514 --> 00:39:54,097
Rym: that's a rather.

627
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:56,029
Rym: that's a rather loaded statement.

628
00:39:59,134 --> 00:39:59,963
Scott: I think we'll leave it at that.

629
00:40:03,991 --> 00:40:07,770
Rym: Actually, we put a pseudo explicit tag on that one episode so we wouldn't get in trouble.

630
00:40:07,851 --> 00:40:10,870
Rym: Plus we had disclaimers like every five minutes in the beginning.

631
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:17,210
Scott: Yeah It's another thing that some you got to watch out with some anime podcasts because they won't tell you when they're gonna spoil something.

632
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:19,710
Scott: We have our thing called the spoiler line.

633
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:25,210
Scott: Like if we talk about a show We'll talk about it and then when we're gonna start spoiling it we say this is the spoiler line.

634
00:40:25,371 --> 00:40:29,048
Scott: Stop listening now, if you haven't watched the show, we'll say it like ten times.

635
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:31,337
Rym: then we're like, yeah Everybody dies at the end of something.

636
00:40:31,357 --> 00:40:31,839
Rym: Mm-hmm.

637
00:40:32,502 --> 00:40:34,470
Scott: Yeah, as soon as you're over that line, it's all your fault.

638
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,250
Rym: Okay, any more questions about podcasting any?

639
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:39,745
Rym: Well, I think we've tapped the well here.

640
00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:42,383
Scott: Well didn't have so much water in it.

641
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,427
Rym: No, not really Can't stop beating this dead horse.

642
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:50,115
Rym: Don't be shy.

643
00:40:50,195 --> 00:40:50,779
Rym: don't be shy.

644
00:40:51,704 --> 00:40:52,790
Rym: got to keep filling the dead air.

645
00:40:56,076 --> 00:40:57,043
Rym: Hold the mic closer to your face.

646
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:00,015
Scott: Sorry about that Kissing the mic here.

647
00:41:00,256 --> 00:41:00,437
Scott: Yep.

648
00:41:00,678 --> 00:41:03,190
Scott: Um, how much does it cost to get?

649
00:41:04,191 --> 00:41:06,114
Scott: Listed on Nothing, nothing.

650
00:41:06,395 --> 00:41:06,696
Rym: Nothing.

651
00:41:06,937 --> 00:41:10,690
Rym: All you have to do is submit it have at least five episodes and not be terrible.

652
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:12,356
Rym: Usually someone looks at it.

653
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:18,729
Rym: if your podcast is terrible or your feed is broken or something isn't working I choose the email you and say man you suck go away.

654
00:41:19,951 --> 00:41:21,195
Scott: Yeah, and iTunes is you'd like.

655
00:41:21,576 --> 00:41:24,324
Scott: some people complain about them because they do sort of sketchy stuff.

656
00:41:24,344 --> 00:41:33,890
Scott: They'll be like they unlisted my feed Those bastards But other times it's like okay your your podcast is like.

657
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,965
Scott: You know bleep bleep bleep in the title and you didn't put an explicit tag on it.

658
00:41:37,105 --> 00:41:38,050
Scott: Apple sends them an email.

659
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:41,786
Scott: You better put an explicit tag on it or we're not gonna list you, you know bad about bleep bleep bleep.

660
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:42,790
Rym: What's your robot?

661
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:46,077
Scott: This is a dirty robot podcast.

662
00:41:46,178 --> 00:41:49,209
Scott: Actually, I see it would only made two episodes and then it went away.

663
00:41:50,731 --> 00:41:51,876
Scott: That's how I just made it up.

664
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:52,298
Rym: Hmm.

665
00:41:52,499 --> 00:41:53,824
Rym: There's actually there's a big issue.

666
00:41:53,865 --> 00:41:55,090
Rym: They call it pod fading.

667
00:41:55,332 --> 00:41:57,770
Rym: Yeah, I hate the fact that people come up with these silly.

668
00:41:58,272 --> 00:42:03,993
Rym: We've got someone else in the back who's excited which means she is now on the spot to ask a question and she seems No, she's hiding.

669
00:42:04,113 --> 00:42:05,258
Rym: Okay, she's hiding whatever.

00:42:11,165 --> 00:42:11,989
Rym: She has to ask a question.

674
00:42:14,293 --> 00:42:15,688
Rym: I'm killing that air here again.

675
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:22,808
Rym: Our podcast called GeekNights, we've already covered all that.

676
00:42:22,828 --> 00:42:23,330
Rym: you don't need to show.

677
00:42:28,918 --> 00:42:30,450
Rym: Tell me about your most controversial.

00:42:38,175 --> 00:42:39,464
Rym: Conrad asked me about my hair.

Rym: nothing what I pod fading.

684
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:58,297
Rym: for some reason everyone in this it's like webcomic art isn't come up with like names For all their like things.

685
00:42:58,337 --> 00:42:59,421
Rym: and this is the same kind of thing.

686
00:42:59,822 --> 00:43:01,770
Rym: Most podcasts don't make it to ten episodes.

687
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:03,682
Rym: Yeah, a lot of you really into it.

688
00:43:03,722 --> 00:43:07,720
Rym: They start a podcast They suck they stop and the podcast disappears.

689
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:09,266
Scott: a lot of people get into podcasting.

690
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,370
Scott: They think oh, this will be so easy.

691
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:14,650
Scott: I'll plug a mic into my laptop and I'll record a show but then they don't really have anything to talk about.

692
00:43:14,831 --> 00:43:22,527
Scott: Or they only do it when they feel like it and they don't do it regularly Or the one fanboy talking about his favorite hentai every day.

693
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:28,230
Scott: Yeah, and Those podcasts don't stick around for more than like two episodes and then they die.

694
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:30,610
Scott: But all the episodes are still there in iTunes.

695
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:32,817
Scott: Yeah, and it's called pod fading.

696
00:43:32,837 --> 00:43:35,667
Scott: because you'll go around and you'll find this podcast pod fading.

697
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:36,570
Rym: people call it pod.

698
00:43:36,751 --> 00:43:37,754
Rym: Yeah, that's right sucking.

699
00:43:37,975 --> 00:43:44,983
Scott: Yeah, but you'll go around you'll find some great podcast and then after like seven episodes They'd be like no more and you'll never see another one.

700
00:43:45,024 --> 00:43:46,129
Scott: You'd be like god damn it.

701
00:43:46,632 --> 00:43:49,308
Scott: It's like if a TV show just ends and it wasn't canceled or anything.

702
00:43:49,368 --> 00:43:49,590
Scott: just go.

703
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,280
Rym: What was that good video game when you were listening to?

704
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,030
Scott: that disappeared those gamers of jobs radio?

705
00:43:53,671 --> 00:43:58,990
Scott: They did 25 episodes and then the the guy went to work for the escapist so they had to stop it.

706
00:43:59,131 --> 00:44:00,137
Rym: Yeah, that's really too bad.

707
00:44:00,157 --> 00:44:01,949
Rym: I wonder if they should start something up again.

708
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:08,310
Scott: Yeah, maybe because there really aren't any good video game podcasts because they're they all suck except for that one.

709
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:08,792
Rym: All right.

710
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,922
Rym: We got another guy here with the question.

711
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:15,046
Rym: Hey, Rym and Scott Do you like how I covered just coming up here and not having to like fill dead air.

712
00:44:15,308 --> 00:44:17,549
Scott: That's fine Before you don't need to be introduced.

713
00:44:19,211 --> 00:44:19,512
Rym: I'm our boy.

714
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:22,766
Rym: I've been on the show before once to talk about non food.

00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:23,248
Scott: Yes.

716
00:44:23,268 --> 00:44:23,770
Scott: It was awesome.

Scott: We'll have you on some time talking about our related things.

718
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,903
Rym: I have an actual question for you right here at the the lovely Tora con at the.

719
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:31,810

00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,850
Rym: that that you are going to maybe talk about either another podcast or?

722
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:49,506
Rym: Well, honestly, we did a whole series on anime conventions and gaming conventions and one how to not suck it going to them Because a lot of our friends it's a good running theme how to not suck at things with us.

723
00:44:50,008 --> 00:44:55,362
Rym: a lot of people We've known have gone to cons and screwed something up Like the hotel was broken or their friends are all idiots.

724
00:44:55,382 --> 00:44:57,190
Rym: They got into a fight or just craziness.

725
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,502
Scott: Yeah, and a lot of people go to cons and then they don't really.

726
00:45:00,522 --> 00:45:02,931
Scott: they don't know how to get the maximum enjoyment out of The con.

727
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:04,216
Scott: so he did a thing on that too.

728
00:45:04,316 --> 00:45:08,150
Rym: Yeah, but ourselves we really only go to cons to do stuff like this.

729
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:13,540
Rym: I mean I speak on panels at like every con I go to and Once again, I'm here speaking on a panel.

730
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,970
Rym: Yeah, and we hang out with our friends and play DS games.

731
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:23,823
Scott: Yeah, the DS is like revitalized the whole convention scene because now every convention is Yeah, pick up the mic.

732
00:45:23,944 --> 00:45:33,690
Rym: It's I know again What panels were you guys all All right.

733
00:45:33,971 --> 00:45:42,689
Rym: The long story short is that at Ohio con - we all bunch of us went and we went into the anime club summit panel And no one was there to run it.

734
00:45:43,111 --> 00:45:51,650
Rym: so being the kinds of people that we are we sat down in the front pretended it was ours and ran it and Then we went to Otakon that year and the same thing happened.

735
00:45:51,992 --> 00:45:53,704
Rym: So we sat down and ran it only this time.

736
00:45:53,744 --> 00:45:56,195
Rym: the staffers said hey You guys know what you're talking about.

737
00:45:56,355 --> 00:45:57,178
Rym: run the panel forever.

738
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,027
Scott: and you ran that panel for like three years.

739
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:02,278
Rym: four years four years And I'm still running it this year.

740
00:46:02,298 --> 00:46:03,404
Rym: I mean my friend Scott Johnson.

741
00:46:03,445 --> 00:46:04,330
Scott: and now we had another panel.

742
00:46:04,612 --> 00:46:05,839
Rym: Yeah, anime central.

743
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:06,744
Rym: the same thing happened.

744
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:07,750
Rym: Katsucon.

745
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:13,133
Rym: I don't speak at it, but one of my friends does and I usually kind of slip my way in Katsucon.

746
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:14,117
Rym: we're gonna do stuff at like.

747
00:46:14,157 --> 00:46:15,562
Rym: I said before toro khan.

748
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:17,410
Rym: Obviously, we come back every year since we're alums.

749
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,318
Scott: Yeah, that's always a big advantage.

750
00:46:20,499 --> 00:46:28,054
Rym: Yeah, so basically we warmed our way in and we just stayed Alright.

751
00:46:28,074 --> 00:46:28,617
Rym: back to DS.

752
00:46:28,657 --> 00:46:30,850
Scott: is the DS is like the king of the convention scene?

753
00:46:31,272 --> 00:46:39,684
Scott: Yeah, anytime there's a grouping of geeks the DS is like All right, I'm up ripping out.

754
00:46:39,704 --> 00:46:41,933
Rym: their DS is All right.

755
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:42,314
Scott: We're all good.

756
00:46:42,955 --> 00:46:44,199
Rym: All right, we've got another question.

757
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,087
Rym: This is a Brian of instant classic fame.

758
00:46:47,247 --> 00:46:47,448
Rym: Yes.

759
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:50,339
Rym: Hi Is there life beyond podcasting?

760
00:46:50,399 --> 00:46:53,050
Rym: Is there anything to strive from now that you're on this level?

761
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,810
Rym: Well, actually there are a lot of directions to go because we're growing at a rate.

762
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:00,822
Rym: That's kind of scary for one since we didn't start that long ago.

763
00:47:00,923 --> 00:47:01,785
Rym: We haven't advertised.

764
00:47:01,946 --> 00:47:03,290
Scott: Yeah, we haven't advertised at all.

765
00:47:04,631 --> 00:47:06,979
Rym: Advertisers tried to make money straight up.

766
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,005
Rym: as in I'm gonna sell my podcast.

767
00:47:09,266 --> 00:47:10,410
Rym: those people have all failed.

768
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:14,190
Scott: Well, some of them had a little bit of success, but generally like one guy.

769
00:47:14,351 --> 00:47:17,670
Scott: He's like some famous British dude, like Ricky Jervis or something like that.

770
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:22,590
Scott: I don't know, but he had a podcast that was yeah, maybe his podcast was wicked popular and funny.

771
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:24,289
Scott: I never listened to it, but that's not the point.

772
00:47:24,932 --> 00:47:31,480
Scott: He decided that since he was so wicked popular starting with like the fifth or the tenth episode He was gonna sell every episode for like five bucks.

773
00:47:32,063 --> 00:47:32,927
Rym: That was the end.

774
00:47:32,947 --> 00:47:37,806
Scott: Yeah Well, you know his popularity dropped way down, but he made money.

775
00:47:37,846 --> 00:47:40,738
Scott: because you know, okay now I have a hundred listeners instead of a thousand.

776
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:47,684
Scott: but a hundred times five bucks is money, you know Other people sell ads and those people sometimes make money sometimes not.

777
00:47:48,185 --> 00:47:49,650
Scott: some of them are trying to cover the costs.

778
00:47:50,092 --> 00:47:51,299
Scott: Some of them are trying to profit.

779
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,486
Scott: Yeah, it just very.

780
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:53,290
Rym: there have been stories.

781
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:54,957
Rym: I haven't heard any specifically like.

782
00:47:54,997 --> 00:48:00,001
Rym: I know the guy where people were picked up by local radio stations or Not really big radio stations.

783
00:48:00,042 --> 00:48:01,210
Rym: yet because they needed voice talent.

784
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,690
Rym: They found someone who was good and just hey come work for us.

785
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,135
Rym: We'll pay you to do what you were doing for free.

786
00:48:05,637 --> 00:48:07,605
Rym: whoo in his defense though.

787
00:48:07,645 --> 00:48:08,930
Rym: He is the creator of The Office.

788
00:48:09,432 --> 00:48:10,115
Scott: I don't know what that is.

789
00:48:10,336 --> 00:48:11,280
Rym: So God doesn't watch TV.

790
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,866
Rym: The office is awesome in my opinion.

791
00:48:12,907 --> 00:48:15,371
Rym: Well, that's why I'm just Okay.

792
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:16,937
Scott: Thanks for thanks for the information.

793
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:19,990
Rym: Yeah, we have nothing against him just against his idea of podcasting.

794
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:24,425
Rym: Yeah, because our philosophy is that we're doing this for fun and we can afford to cover all the equipment.

795
00:48:24,766 --> 00:48:28,461
Rym: So we Refused to advertise on our site refused to make money.

796
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:30,750
Rym: if we make t-shirts, we'll just sell them at cost.

797
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:36,412
Rym: The question was how many listeners do we have?

798
00:48:36,453 --> 00:48:37,560
Scott: Well, it's hard to measure.

799
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:43,880
Rym: We have a few hundred currently which isn't too bad considering we just started and considering we've never advertised ever.

800
00:48:44,403 --> 00:48:46,560
Scott: Yeah, but there are different ways to measure listeners.

801
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:51,320
Scott: Like we can tell you how many people downloaded a specific episode, but there's four days a week.

802
00:48:51,421 --> 00:48:52,710
Scott: Some people only listen Monday.

803
00:48:52,851 --> 00:48:54,040
Scott: Some people only listen Tuesday.

804
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,840
Scott: Some people listen like Monday Thursday, but not Tuesday Wednesday.

805
00:48:57,402 --> 00:49:03,302
Scott: Some people listen to every day so the number of listeners is kind of Feed.

806
00:49:03,363 --> 00:49:13,880
Rym: we average what like 1.6 new listeners per calendar day Even even days where there are new episodes almost never lost listeners other than that one kid we banned from our forum.

807
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,169
Scott: He said I think he said that he was still listen.

808
00:49:16,189 --> 00:49:17,274
Scott: I think he said he's still listening.

809
00:49:17,314 --> 00:49:18,037
Scott: But so mr.

810
00:49:18,117 --> 00:49:21,955
Scott: Flaming geek I guess the guy who wasn't really in Japan and can't speak English.

811
00:49:21,995 --> 00:49:22,558
Scott: Yeah.

812
00:49:22,578 --> 00:49:26,720
Scott: Yeah No, but there's also the issue of people's might subscribe to your feed.

813
00:49:27,061 --> 00:49:32,860
Scott: So I know that someone is subscribed to like the Monday feed, but they might not download every single Monday episode.

814
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:34,547
Scott: So it's like he's a listener.

815
00:49:34,587 --> 00:49:37,780
Scott: He's not a listener, you know, or some people download and never listen to it.

816
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:40,820
Scott: They just let their iPods fill up and don't play him ever, you know.

817
00:49:41,102 --> 00:49:43,359
Scott: And then eventually they go what the hell is this and delete it all?

818
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:50,135
Rym: So basically I'd say after about six more months to a year We'll have enough statistics to actually do math and figure out exactly.

819
00:49:50,175 --> 00:49:58,700
Scott: but I'd say at least a few hundred Yeah, and then considering we haven't done any pushing whatsoever Like we barely push it, I think we just put it in our signatures and like slash that.

820
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:06,286
Rym: yeah, this is our first public appearance and I think Otakon is gonna be our kind of big tipping point since we're doing a Podcast at Otakon live.

821
00:50:06,346 --> 00:50:09,440
Rym: We might be getting all sorts of space at Otakon to do other fun things.

822
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:11,347
Rym: You're really not sure what the deal is yet.

823
00:50:11,427 --> 00:50:14,779
Rym: But I think being in the program book at Otakon is gonna explode us.

824
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:16,797
Rym: Yeah, well pretend I never said that.

825
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:20,426
Rym: Alright we have a question from Kate here.

826
00:50:20,808 --> 00:50:25,361
Rym: I just wanted you to break down the costs for overhead and Okay.

827
00:50:25,482 --> 00:50:25,723
Scott: Alright.

828
00:50:25,763 --> 00:50:28,270
Scott: So the first cost you have is a microphone.

829
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,540
Scott: now if you don't care about being high quality a microphone is 10 bucks.

830
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,805
Rym: Yeah I mean we went way overboard.

831
00:50:33,845 --> 00:50:34,808
Rym: most podcasts are.

832
00:50:34,828 --> 00:50:40,104
Rym: a dude with the crappy microphone that he found in the box his computer came in Plugged into his computer.

833
00:50:40,144 --> 00:50:44,560
Rym: He's recording in like Windows recorder and then encoding and like I don't know Nero.

834
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,007
Scott: Yeah, the Logitech headsets are pretty popular.

835
00:50:47,048 --> 00:50:48,813
Scott: the little like come out.

836
00:50:48,853 --> 00:50:50,398
Scott: It's got a little microphone a little.

837
00:50:50,558 --> 00:50:51,040
Scott: what's it called?

838
00:50:51,622 --> 00:50:52,766
Scott: Boom boom little stick.

839
00:50:52,867 --> 00:50:56,580
Scott: Yeah, they're usually like the gaming headsets you use if you want to play like counter-strike online.

840
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:02,260
Scott: But those things like 20 bucks and like some people when they want to add more people to their podcast just buy more headsets.

841
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:14,360
Rym: You know You need some sort of hosting and usually you want some sort of blog or blog software to go along with it Because I know webcomics usually wants some sort of automated system of I upload a comic and everything gets taken care of.

842
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:20,760
Rym: So you need the same sort of thing and there are a lot of cheap cheap cheap services that will offer that though You can do it yourself fairly easily.

843
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:33,760
Scott: Yeah, it all depends on your bandwidth because I mean if your host gives you a hundred gigabytes a month Right, if you only have so many listeners and your podcasts are only so many megabytes Maybe you can you know do it there and not have to pay any more fees.

844
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:42,540
Scott: But what eventually happens to most podcast is since of mp3 is pretty big and you're not bit torrenting it Which some people do actually bit torrent their podcast to save bandwidth.

845
00:51:42,701 --> 00:51:48,058
Scott: But most people just let you directly download the mp3 which means lots and lots of bandwidth costs.

846
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,860
Rym: now I won't go to all the hosting details because we've run our own Linux server up in the sky and then we host our feeds with feed burner.

847
00:51:55,141 --> 00:52:04,200
Rym: We host our mp3s with libsyn which I'm gonna recommend them to people who don't have any other option But I don't really recommend them because I don't like them terribly.

848
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:15,446
Scott: Yeah, libsyn isn't the greatest company, but really for like 10 bucks They'll let you do what 200 something megabytes worth of podcasts per month Many down.

849
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:19,220
Rym: if you get a million downloads, you're still good and they'll give you a blog that they'll run.

850
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:23,399
Rym: It's kind of like WordPress and they'll hate take care of your RSS feeds and all that sort of stuff.

851
00:52:23,964 --> 00:52:31,780
Rym: Yeah, the RSS feeds are a little tricky But yeah, we paid total about $80 a month for all of our hosting combined, but that includes other websites we run.

852
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,226
Scott: Yeah, we do other stuff with the hosting.

853
00:52:33,246 --> 00:52:35,033
Scott: So one hostings 40 bucks the line.

854
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:36,780
Scott: Oh, the libsyn is 20 bucks.

855
00:52:37,841 --> 00:52:38,787
Scott: Let's see the mixer.

856
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:40,860
Rym: Yeah only need a mixer.

857
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:43,400
Rym: See we we have two people on the podcast which is rare.

858
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,420
Rym: Most people who have are either one person or a bunch of people talking over Skype.

859
00:52:48,024 --> 00:52:53,319
Rym: I can't help you if you do the Skype thing because Skype is Complicated in the fact that it's closed source and you can't fiddle with it.

860
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:58,135
Scott: Yeah Gizmo is a little easier because you just open up gizmo call someone and push the record button.

861
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:05,940
Scott: with Skype you either need like two Computers wired together or a crazy wiring configuration or there's a freeware Windows program that lets you record Skype conversations.

862
00:53:06,143 --> 00:53:07,459
Scott: I don't know the name of it because I don't use it.

863
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:12,080
Rym: We've spent a little under $200 on equipment, but once again, we went way over the top.

864
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:17,060
Rym: I mean gig nights is one of the highest quality in terms of audio podcasts out there.

865
00:53:17,381 --> 00:53:19,731
Scott: Yeah, that's just because we put so much effort into it.

866
00:53:19,932 --> 00:53:21,720
Rym: I mean you can get that mixer was like 60 bucks.

867
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,407
Rym: It'll handle a whole bunch of inputs.

868
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:33,320
Rym: We've got a compressor there, which is our newest bit of technology Which I'm not gonna go explain it Unless someone wants me to but basically it reduces the range between the loudest sound and the quietest sound.

869
00:53:33,763 --> 00:53:44,808
Rym: So if I get quiet while I'm talking and then I get loud again It kind of evens it all out and more importantly it squishes the audio down so we can record on that crappy laptop right there With yeah crappy crappy sound card is it?

870
00:53:44,828 --> 00:53:45,873
Scott: you do need a computer.

871
00:53:45,993 --> 00:53:48,807
Scott: the computer doesn't have to be that good But they should hear the computer.

872
00:53:48,827 --> 00:53:51,460
Scott: the you know, you're gonna run into trouble processing.

873
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,482
Scott: It's gonna take forever.

874
00:53:52,622 --> 00:53:57,391
Scott: editing will take forever and you need a lot of hard drive space to store all the podcasts.

875
00:53:57,411 --> 00:54:03,407
Scott: because don't trust All your podcasts and then you're screwed.

876
00:54:03,668 --> 00:54:05,980
Scott: plus you want a hard drive lossless like original.

877
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:15,360
Rym: I mean you'll make an mp3 and upload it but you want to keep the original original WAV file or whatever Because in the future you're gonna want to be able to make a high quality master for whatever reason.

878
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:15,838
Rym: You know.

879
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:25,987
Rym: maybe you wanna put a DVD of your whole podcast someday or you get picked up by a radio station or You just want to re-edit them now that you know how to actually edit Or you want to release your outtakes?

880
00:54:26,649 --> 00:54:26,870
Rym: Yes.

881
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,196
Rym: We have we have outtakes.

882
00:54:28,216 --> 00:54:28,839
Scott: We have outtakes.

883
00:54:29,762 --> 00:54:30,425
Rym: Software is free.

884
00:54:30,566 --> 00:54:32,754
Scott: The software is free unless you want to get fancy.

885
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:37,239
Scott: the first fancy software That's kind of free is garage band, which isn't really free.

886
00:54:37,581 --> 00:54:39,028
Scott: But if you buy a Mac you get it for free.

887
00:54:39,229 --> 00:54:40,113
Rym: garage bands great.

888
00:54:40,355 --> 00:54:41,440
Rym: if you have that you're all set.

889
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,378
Rym: You can just podcast now.

890
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:53,886
Scott: Yeah Garage band has like amazing podcast tools for idiots like a Doofus could just click on the podcast button and garage band start talking and click the finish button and it takes care of everything for You considered buying a MacBook just for it.

891
00:54:54,147 --> 00:55:00,130
Scott: Yeah, there's another piece of software that's pretty popular called cast blaster cast blaster Windows, isn't it?

892
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:13,840
Scott: Yeah, it's not free but it's very very Fancy and it takes care of everything you need to do for podcasting even typing in your show notes and everything from start to finish Like you push a button in music plays and you push another button for wacky sound effects and the volumes and everything.

893
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:18,038
Rym: Yeah now beyond that there are things like Pro Tools Which if you don't know what that is, you don't need it.

894
00:55:18,341 --> 00:55:20,720
Rym: Even if you know what it is, you probably don't need it for a podcast.

895
00:55:21,181 --> 00:55:28,867
Scott: Yeah, Pro Tools is for real radio people and all kinds of fancy production studios who seem to use something called audacity Which is that's that right there.

896
00:55:29,128 --> 00:55:29,629
Rym: It's free.

897
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,332
Rym: It's really easy use.

898
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:31,035
Rym: it works in Windows.

899
00:55:31,075 --> 00:55:31,697
Rym: It works on Macs.

900
00:55:31,737 --> 00:55:32,380
Rym: It works in Linux.

901
00:55:33,781 --> 00:55:43,760
Rym: I can't really speak badly of it except for the fact that installing it can be a pain if you're using a Good Linux distribution because we're not gonna talk about this, but the guy who coded this doesn't know what he's doing.

902
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:51,865
Scott: Yeah, you can ask us any questions about non podcasting geekery after the show because we know but I mean most of you will have No problem and it works great.

903
00:55:52,246 --> 00:55:55,799
Rym: If you have Linux you can use something called resound re z ou nd.

904
00:55:56,121 --> 00:55:56,745
Scott: That's what we use.

905
00:55:56,765 --> 00:55:57,610
Rym: I swear by.

906
00:55:57,711 --> 00:55:59,139
Rym: it's a beautiful beautiful program.

907
00:55:59,664 --> 00:56:05,850
Rym: The guy who wrote it isn't the best coder But he knows a lot about audio and he wrote all the algorithms himself and it works really well.

908
00:56:07,103 --> 00:56:09,440
Scott: And considering, you know, you don't have too many other Linux options.

909
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:10,303
Scott: That's what we went with.

910
00:56:10,604 --> 00:56:16,966
Rym: so you could do a decent podcast on I'd say 20 bucks a month total Plus maybe 50 bucks worth of equipment.

911
00:56:17,547 --> 00:56:23,269
Rym: Yeah, pretty much and if you spend what we spent you'll have a crazy awesome radio quality podcast Mm-hmm.

912
00:56:24,503 --> 00:56:25,588
Scott: Here comes another question watch out.

913
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,472
Rym: Oh, yeah.

914
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:27,135
Rym: All right.

915
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:28,100
Rym: Here's a question for you.

916
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,233
Rym: I noticed that you guys have forums on your.

917
00:56:31,795 --> 00:56:32,960
Rym: we do indeed have forums.

918
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:39,256
Rym: Now do you think that first of all, is it necessary to have forums for podcasting?

919
00:56:39,316 --> 00:56:42,252
Rym: and second if you do What are some good tips to managing forums?

920
00:56:42,796 --> 00:56:44,854
Scott: Well, all right You want to take this?

921
00:56:44,874 --> 00:56:48,300
Scott: Yeah, sure If you have a podcast you generally have a website that goes with it.

922
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:51,180
Scott: That way people can find your podcast with Google or something.

923
00:56:51,301 --> 00:56:58,740
Scott: It's kind of necessary but you know Usually your website can add a minimum contain your show notes and links to your shows at a maximum.

924
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:03,157
Scott: You can try to build a whole community around your podcast, you know forums and all kinds of stuff.

925
00:57:03,177 --> 00:57:03,740
Scott: You don't need to.

926
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:07,980
Scott: It's just something that's good to interact with your listeners and all that sort of good stuff.

927
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,960
Rym: Also, it helps you gain momentum because if there's a community there, they'll all stay by you just like in webcomics.

928
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,759
Rym: It's like everything else.

929
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:19,140
Rym: I mean, we know some webcomic artists who stop updating and their fans bother them for like the next five years.

930
00:57:19,382 --> 00:57:20,151
Scott: When's it gonna update?

931
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:20,858
Scott: when's it gonna update?

932
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:30,033
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is that you know, if you only get feedback from your listeners via email then you know It comes in when someone really has the urge to email you.

933
00:57:30,053 --> 00:57:43,498
Scott: they won't just email you casually But if you can get someone to join your forums Which is about as much effort as getting them to send you one email Once they've joined and once they've gotten used to going to the site They'll just give you feedback constantly and start talking about all kinds of stuff.

934
00:57:43,799 --> 00:57:51,372
Rym: Yep Now you're gonna have to watch out for flamers trolls and general spam bots Which is really too complex a topic to get into now.

935
00:57:51,592 --> 00:57:53,780
Rym: Yeah, I used to say we've had to ban one person already.

936
00:57:54,121 --> 00:57:56,530
Scott: Yeah, but technology will solve you most of those problems.

937
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:59,380
Rym: Yeah and off the air we can tell you exactly how to deal with that.

938
00:57:59,711 --> 00:58:01,482
Scott: Yep Anything else?

939
00:58:01,703 --> 00:58:02,526
Rym: any more questions?

940
00:58:02,927 --> 00:58:03,610
Rym: What's happening at all?

941
00:58:04,453 --> 00:58:06,500
Rym: I think we've recorded enough for a show at least.

942
00:58:06,921 --> 00:58:08,448
Scott: Yeah, I think we have 18 minutes left.

943
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:09,171
Rym: Yeah.

944
00:58:09,211 --> 00:58:10,376
Rym: So anyway our show we haven't.

945
00:58:10,476 --> 00:58:11,199
Rym: it's GeekNights.

946
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:13,365
Scott: Listen to it GeekNights.

Rym: Yes as in the front row crew from the anime club I don't know who here is even old enough to remember what that is.

949
00:58:20,272 --> 00:58:20,352
Rym: Yeah.

950
00:58:21,216 --> 00:58:22,160
Rym: All right, there are some people.

951
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,231
Rym: They're all my friends already.

952
00:58:23,252 --> 00:58:31,415
Rym: So front row crew calm Yep, and we're out off the air and we'll probably take less formal questions starting now.

953
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:35,022
Scott: now now or maybe later Perhaps or really?

954
00:58:35,383 --> 00:58:46,900
Rym: Yeah, really and that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
