1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:15,920
Rym: It's Monday, Cinco de Mayo 2014, I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,108
Rym: Prosumer versus professional.

3
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:22,799
Rym: You probably don't want the latter even if you think you do.

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,578
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,600
Scott: So for the first time this year, I think it's time to bike to work.

6
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:34,080
Rym: I bike to work today?

7
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:38,017
Scott: So I go out and I'm like, "Oh, I'm gonna dig and get on my bike, start biking to

8
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:38,238
Scott: work.".

9
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:42,920
Scott: Then I checked the weather before I went to work and it said high fifties, low sixties.

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,152
Scott: And I'm like, "That's warm

11
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:44,415
Scott: enough.".

12
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:45,036
Scott: Yeah.

13
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:47,899
Scott: So I'm biking, I get to the old bridge.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,147
Rym: Which bridge?

15
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:50,180
Rym: The Queensborough?

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,866
Scott: 59th Street, yeah.

17
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:52,160
Scott: It's the only bridge I can take to work.

18
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:55,812
Scott: And the wind starts going whoosh.

19
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:56,919
Scott: and I'm like, "What the fuck is

20
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:57,060
Scott: this?".

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,940
Rym: The wind was strong enough when I hit the Williamsburg Bridge this morning to catch my new helmet and pull my head to the side.

22
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:08,414
Scott: The wind was so strong that when I was going downhill, I had to pedal to go.

23
00:01:09,157 --> 00:01:10,140
Scott: That's how strong it was.

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,298
Rym: How strong was that wind?

25
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:12,503
Scott: Too strong.

26
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:12,908
Scott: Right?

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,160
Scott: But meanwhile, when I checked that weather and saw high fifties, low sixties, you know what it said?

28
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,043
Scott: Wind-wise?

29
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:23,119
Scott: Three mile an hour wind from the north.

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,070
Rym: Yeah, did it not say 30 mile an hour gusts?

31
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:27,925
Scott: It did not say that.

32
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:31,440
Scott: It was horse shit, that weather.

33
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,146
Rym: See, you know what?

34
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,220
Rym: I was fine.

35
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,089
Rym: That anemometer?

36
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:35,200
Rym: Dysfunctional.

37
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Rym: While that wind was notable, it was not in any way impinging.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,470
Scott: I guess I made it to work.

39
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:43,120
Scott: It was not pleasant.

40
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:50,920
Rym: I also have a much longer ride than you, so by the time I get to that point, I'm in that mode of just fuck it, just pedaling, pedaling, pedaling, pedaling.

41
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:54,320
Rym: I mean, it takes me about a half hour to get to work on a bike.

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,579
Scott: Yeah, that's about right.

43
00:01:56,301 --> 00:02:00,240
Scott: Mostly the thing is, you know, it takes me like 15 minutes to get to Manhattan.

44
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:04,050
Scott: And then it takes me 15 minutes to cross town on 49th street.

45
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:08,201
Scott: because for the past, I've been biking to work since 2009.

46
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:11,971
Scott: In all four of those years, well, 9, 10, well, I guess 10, so 10, 11, 12, wow, a lot of years.

47
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:22,020
Scott: Every single year, as long as I've been biking to work, the left lane of 49th street has had permanent construction on like two blocks.

48
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:23,740
Rym: Wow, you're right now that I think about it.

49
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,300
Scott: That's never been, it's never, it's always been there all the time.

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,339
Rym: Maybe they just forgot.

51
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,302
Scott: Right.

52
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:31,700
Scott: There's like some new buses are deciding to stop somewhere.

53
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,727
Scott: It's like I was behind a bus.

54
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,380
Scott: I couldn't get through the spots in between.

55
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:34,944
Rym: Yeah.

56
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:35,993
Scott: It's a red light.

57
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:36,739
Scott: It's a green light.

58
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:43,380
Scott: The bus zooms across the intersection, immediately stops blocking the entire right lane as soon as it gets through the intersection.

59
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:45,247
Scott: And there was like three buses in front of it.

60
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:48,120
Scott: I'm like, well, left lane gone, right lane gone.

61
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:53,056
Scott: And now on top of all that, right, they decided to repave 49th street.

62
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:54,300
Scott: So it's all ground the fuck up.

63
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,160
Rym: Might I suggest a different street?

64
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,989
Scott: All right, so what should I use?

65
00:02:58,029 --> 00:02:58,875
Scott: 51st street or 47th street?

66
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:00,692
Rym: 51st, it's fine.

67
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:01,158
Rym: I've used it.

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,534
Scott: I'm going to try tomorrow.

69
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:02,959
Scott: We'll see.

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,225
Rym: Go to 55th or 58th street.

71
00:03:04,245 --> 00:03:04,587
Rym: 57th, I forget.

72
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,205
Scott: 57th is kind of crazy.

73
00:03:09,787 --> 00:03:13,038
Scott: It's full of cars and shit, but yeah, 49th street.

74
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:19,560
Scott: And then the part that's not all ground up, the deadliest potholes imaginable.

75
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,979
Scott: Like there was one that was like a foot deep.

76
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:30,420
Rym: Oh, there's a pothole near Manhattan Avenue in Brooklyn that if you don't notice it and you hit it in a bike and you don't have large tires, you're just fucked.

77
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:33,106
Rym: There's like two on Crescent.

78
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:34,151
Scott: Crescent's got two.

79
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:36,440
Scott: One farther up north and one near you.

80
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,400
Rym: I noticed that when I biked your place.

81
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,139
Scott: If we call 311, they're supposed to fix it.

82
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:42,426
Rym: Have you called 311?

83
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:42,858
Rym: I haven't.

84
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,392
Rym: Well, that's why they haven't fixed it.

85
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:45,400
Rym: We're waiting for you to call.

86
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,800
Scott: I'm not going to stop my bike, call 311 every time there's a pothole.

87
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:49,939
Scott: I think you had to work.

88
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,159
Rym: So since we're talking, I guess the show's about bikes now.

89
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:55,599
Rym: On my way home, because I was wearing glass and I thought, you know what I'm going to do?

90
00:03:56,181 --> 00:04:00,900
Rym: I'm going to take a picture of everyone who does something egregious and like from now on.

91
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,119
Scott: You're not going to be able to push the button in time.

92
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,900
Rym: I was like, maybe, you know, I'll, I'll get egregious photos.

93
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,919
Rym: I'll make a blog that's like shit heads in New York.

94
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,860
Rym: Yeah, so I got an archive of 40 something shit heads just for my commute home.

95
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,760
Scott: In like 10 minutes.

96
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,240
Rym: It was like 15 or 16 people who were just biking the wrong way on a one-way bike lane.

97
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,795
Rym: Two of these motherfuckers.

98
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,260
Rym: There was, the street had a bike lane going the right way on the same street.

99
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,075
Scott: Dude, I could have given you 10 red light runners, right?

100
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,080
Scott: Just on First Avenue.

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,400
Rym: I saw some teenage shit head actually just ram into an old lady.

102
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:35,975
Rym: I stopped and she seemed okay though.

103
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:36,800
Rym: She didn't speak English.

104
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,337
Rym: And he was yelling at me like he wanted to start a fight with me.

105
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:41,850
Rym: That was all today.

106
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:42,680
Rym: It was awesome.

107
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:50,799
Rym: Also, I had a cab honk at me and then swerve into the left lane to get around me, almost hitting another cab who then started honking at him.

108
00:04:51,162 --> 00:04:52,799
Rym: And then they got stuck stopping traffic.

109
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:53,460
Rym: Okay.

110
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:55,078
Scott: Yeah, that was, it was a fun day.

111
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:55,840
Scott: He was in a hurry.

112
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:57,620
Rym: Yeah, I guess he had to be somewhere.

113
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:00,114
Rym: So yeah, I guess there's news.

114
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:00,800
Rym: It's Monday.

115
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,323
Scott: All right.

116
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:03,760
Scott: So it's sort of a two Twitter news, right?

117
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,060
Scott: So Twitter news number one is the one that people probably care about more.

118
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:12,757
Scott: And that's that Twitter is considering adding a feature that I really want, which is the mute feature whereby...

119
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,564
Rym: No, no, no.

120
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:18,439
Rym: The fact that you even say it's a feature you want already leads into what I have to say about this.

121
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,940
Scott: Where you can follow someone, but you can mute them so you don't see their tweets.

122
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:31,720
Rym: Honestly, that already belies an issue with friendship and social networks.

123
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:43,019
Rym: The very fact that you need to be able to be following someone yet do not actually want to see what they have to say means that you don't want to be following them, but are under some sort of obligation to follow them.

124
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,227
Rym: Yeah.

125
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:47,880
Rym: Like if you follow your grandma and you don't want to see all the racist stuff.

126
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,308
Scott: Now, hold on, hold on.

127
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,099
Scott: I knew that you would go there because that is also the first thing I thought of.

128
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,989
Rym: And I knew because of the way you phrased this that you were leading me there so that you could then redirect.

129
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,400
Rym: So now I'm waiting for your redirect.

130
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,223
Scott: That is correct.

131
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:03,280
Scott: So you are correct and I 100% agree with you.

132
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,139
Scott: If you're following someone, you don't actually want to see their tweets, just fucking unfollow them.

133
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:10,840
Scott: And if they notice that or get upset by it, who gives a shit?

134
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,879
Rym: Well, hopefully they'll stop talking to you and then you win.

135
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,461
Scott: Maybe.

136
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:17,397
Scott: The reason to mute someone is temporary muting.

137
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:27,160
Scott: For example, so and so went somewhere and is tweeting like a fucking nut job because they're at some crazy event and you don't give any fuck.

138
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,588
Scott: So mute them until tomorrow.

139
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:30,540
Scott: That is the feature that I want.

140
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:31,628
Rym: That's not a bad feature.

141
00:06:31,648 --> 00:06:33,060
Rym: It has to have a deadline.

142
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,019
Scott: So you just go and click unmute the next day.

143
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,052
Rym: I don't know because then you'll forget.

144
00:06:38,092 --> 00:06:39,180
Rym: You might as well just unfollow them.

145
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:42,480
Scott: I'm sure there's a page you can go that will list the people you've muted.

146
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,099
Scott: I guess you could unfollow someone and follow them again the next day already.

147
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,419
Rym: Which is a better thing.

148
00:06:48,420 --> 00:07:05,160
Rym: I actually still wish I could, within Twitter, very easily see when people follow and unfollow me because I've noticed that the number of followers... It's not this steady, slow, slow rise, but it'll fluctuate pretty widely week to week.

149
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,560
Rym: And I'd really like to see what things I say cause a bunch of people to unfollow or follow me.

150
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,431
Scott: The thing I really want is Twitter lists, which exists, but doesn't really exist on mobile.

151
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:18,220
Scott: That way I could categorize everyone.

152
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:18,761
Rym: Yup.

153
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:19,669
Rym: Cause you know what I want?

154
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,500
Rym: I'd follow a lot more people or at least have a bunch of people in lists that are basically my personal equivalent of total fark.

155
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,041
Scott: Right.

156
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:33,840
Scott: So it's like the people that I actually care about every single tweet they tweet, I will have in the main feed that I'm constantly reading all the time.

157
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:42,759
Scott: But say there's someone who tweets about, I don't know, something I kinda care about, maybe programming stuff that I'm doing at work.

158
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:47,619
Scott: It's like I don't want to read their tweets in my main timeline, but I could take all those people, put them in a list...

159
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:48,699
Rym: And then when you're bored...

160
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,087
Scott: And then only read that list.

161
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,300
Scott: if I need to read that list, right?

162
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,472
Scott: And I could be like, oh, and a Twitter in this list.

163
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:59,220
Scott: I'd probably read that list constantly, but it would at least be separated from my main feed, right?

164
00:07:59,321 --> 00:07:59,660
Scott: Exactly.

165
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,640
Scott: But they don't add Twitter lists to the mobile app as far as I know.

166
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,517
Scott: It's like, for example...

167
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,480
Rym: It's like only in the web app.

168
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,611
Rym: Some people probably follow me for my occasional social justice related tweet, and then they're put off by my tweet.

169
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:11,020
Rym: that's just me saying f*ck a whole bunch.

170
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,321
Rym: Right.

171
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:28,560
Scott: The other thing is that there are people I'm friends with that are totally cool, and I follow them... And I like to read their tweets... But... They'll tweet like one gaming thing and like 20 social justice things, and it's like, I do not disagree with you at all in your, you know, things about social justice.

172
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,086
Scott: I am 100% with you.

173
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,919
Scott: But I do not want to read 50 posts about it every day.

174
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:35,578
Scott: Why is that all you talk about?

175
00:08:36,102 --> 00:08:42,900
Scott: I know that it's very important, but it's not so important that I need to read 50 tweets about it when I agree with it every single day.

176
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:44,238
Scott: We know.

177
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,600
Scott: You know, the only other piece I can see for this... But your tweets aren't solving the problem.

178
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:48,736
Rym: Is the situation...

179
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,660
Scott: Anyone who's following you is already solved.

180
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,099
Rym: I almost, all I really want is the ability to... I want your list, like you said.

181
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,740
Rym: I would like the ability to mute a specific conversation.

182
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,820
Rym: Because, you know, like maybe like me and Mike Toole will like start half arguing about something.

183
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,820
Scott: And I'll reply to just one tweet and suddenly my name is getting added in every tweet.

184
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:09,718
Scott: And it's like, no, stop it.

185
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,020
Rym: And then we keep arguing for like another four hours.

186
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,413
Scott: I just tossed in one comment.

187
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:13,999
Scott: Stop that shit.

188
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,753
Scott: Stop adding me to everything.

189
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,280
Rym: I kind of like the mechanism design of that.

190
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,532
Rym: Like, you want to get involved in someone's argument?

191
00:09:20,552 --> 00:09:21,840
Rym: Well, you're fucking involved now.

192
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:37,860
Scott: See, I'm actually curious in that when I reply to a conversation that has a bunch of people in it, I will only at the people who I can tell from the conversation that my comment is relevant to and will not at the extraneous people that has the side benefit of giving me some extra characters to work with.

193
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:44,440
Rym: I at everyone, one, out of a misplaced sense of pride for getting my ideas out with increasingly less space available.

194
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,658
Rym: And two, because I just don't give a shit and I don't want to think about...

195
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,720
Scott: You are not courteous at all.

196
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,980
Rym: Nope, which I think is why...

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,119
Scott: That is not a mystery.

198
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,640
Rym: Which I think is why my Twitter followers...

199
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,860
Scott: That is not a new development.

200
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:57,880
Rym: I am courteous in person.

201
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,254
Scott: If you are, in fact, anti-courteous, someone will tell you, "Rym, that is annoying noise.

202
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:02,957
Scott: Stop making it.

203
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:03,539
Scott: You will make it

204
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:03,800
Scott: more.".

205
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:08,215
Scott: And that is the way of Rym.

206
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:13,760
Rym: If anyone wants to read the Tower of Rym, that's line number one.

207
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,800
Scott: If someone is bothered by a thing, do that thing as much as possible in their presence.

208
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,620
Rym: But you see, you guys have to learn that if you tell me to stop it, I'll do it more.

209
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,440
Rym: If you don't say anything, I assume it's okay.

210
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,379
Rym: There's really no way out.

211
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:27,819
Scott: Anyway...

212
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,360
Rym: It's Rym's Gambit.

213
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,234
Scott: So the second...

214
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,959
Rym: It's my Kobayashi Maru.

215
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,260
Rym: The second Twitter news... You don't even know what Kobayashi Maru is, do you?

216
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,794
Scott: I've heard of it.

217
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,838
Rym: Do you know what it is?

218
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,320
Scott: I can't think of it right now.

219
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:37,700
Rym: Okay.

220
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:39,640
Rym: When you look it up, you'll laugh a little bit.

221
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:39,854
Rym: Maybe.

222
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,520
Scott: The second Twitter news is that Amazon is going to let you buy things on Twitter.

223
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,780
Scott: Now, how the hell does that make sense?

224
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,980
Scott: I can already link to Amazon...

225
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,119
Rym: I can already see that being me accidentally buying a bunch of stuff.

226
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,340
Scott: Right, we can already put links to things on Amazon on Twitter and they get shortened with the Amazon URL shortener.

227
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:57,199
Rym: Now we know, here's the thing.

228
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:58,660
Rym: I want to make it quick.

229
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,060
Rym: This is something that I hate about every technology discussion, forum, site, blog, podcast in the world.

230
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:15,839
Rym: And if something like this is announced and the armchair coder general journalist will be like, "But what if I make a link that auto buys something for $1,000 and someone accidentally clicks on

231
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:15,900
Rym: it?".

232
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:17,440
Rym: Obviously, it won't work like that.

233
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,540
Scott: Obviously, you're a moron who didn't read what I actually... And the problem is, it really is not that person.

234
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:28,140
Scott: It's the person who writes the headline that Amazon lets you buy things on Twitter, which is not true at all.

235
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,280
Scott: That's what all the headlines say, but that's not actually what they're doing.

236
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:49,960
Scott: What they're doing is, if someone tweets a tweet with a link to an item on Amazon, and you reply to that tweet with a hashtag, I forget what the hashtag is, but it's some Amazon checkout hashtag or something, it will then add that item to your cart on Amazon, but it won't check out.

237
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,318
Scott: And then when you go back to Amazon and look in your cart, that item will be there.

238
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,840
Scott: Now... And that's all they're doing.

239
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,140
Scott: That actually... I don't know how that counts as buying things on Twitter at all.

240
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,700
Rym: It's also actually, I think, pretty exploitable.

241
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,153
Scott: Maybe, yeah.

242
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:06,339
Rym: So, Juan, I compromise your account...

243
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:12,760
Scott: You tweet something with the hashtag, and then other people tweet or retweet it, and now that item is in their carts.

244
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:20,300
Rym: Or I compromise your Twitter account and do that to add things to your cart, and you might not notice.

245
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,000
Scott: And then you accidentally check out without looking at your cart and noticing the price is ridiculously high?

246
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,339
Rym: Which I usually don't look at my cart that much.

247
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,336
Scott: Okay.

248
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,376
Rym: 'Cause I add things to it over the course... Like, every few weeks, I go to my cart and I'm like, "All right, there's a bunch of stuff in here.

249
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:33,617
Rym: Check

250
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:33,838
Rym: out.".

251
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:37,030
Scott: Well, you are exploitable.

252
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:38,680
Scott: I actually look at what I'm buying.

253
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,269
Rym: Plus, I would add little things.

254
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:42,839
Rym: I'd go for, like, two or three dollar things.

255
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,320
Scott: I would put my own things into fulfillment by Amazon, right?

256
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:54,419
Scott: Then, with my own affiliate account, link to them, and then get people to buy them.

257
00:12:55,164 --> 00:12:55,959
Rym: Not a bad idea.

258
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,616
Scott: Yeah, maybe I'll make a specific Twitter account, ScottSells, and I'll start selling all the... I'm gonna sell a bunch of shit, so maybe I'll do it that way.

259
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:03,180
Scott: That'll be interesting.

260
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,140
Rym: You wanna sell some of my shit?

261
00:13:05,343 --> 00:13:06,319
Scott: Only after I sell all my shit.

262
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:09,139
Rym: All right, 'cause I got some floodlights that I really wanna get rid of.

263
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:10,832
Scott: I don't know how to sell those on Amazon.

264
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:11,780
Scott: I only know how to sell books.

265
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,580
Rym: Nah, I'm sure Amazon will take them, but it might cost too much.

266
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,158
Rym: Oh, that's all you.

267
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,675
Scott: Yeah.

268
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:17,819
Scott: It'd be cheaper to throw them away.

269
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:23,580
Rym: So, in other news, this article really hits the nail on the head.

270
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,820
Rym: The nail being something I'm pissed off about, and I have been for a long time.

271
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,879
Rym: Your name is pissed off about something?

272
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,451
Rym: Yeah, this issue is personal.

273
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,380
Scott: Well, why don't you go find that thing that you hate so much, figure out what noises it doesn't like to listen to, and make them at it?

274
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,286
Rym: Apparently, what it doesn't like to listen to is, "Hello, police?

275
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:40,830
Rym: Someone stole my phone.

276
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:42,393
Rym: They're right over there.

277
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:43,877
Rym: I can prove it's my phone.

278
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:44,759
Rym: Can you go take it

279
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:45,100
Rym: back?".

280
00:13:45,344 --> 00:13:45,518
Rym: Nope.

281
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,380
Rym: So, I guess that annoying noise.

282
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,380
Scott: That's always weirded me out, because it's like the police won't go and get your phone when it's right there.

283
00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:02,320
Scott: But if you're on the street, and your phone was literally just stolen like a minute ago, and there's a cop who happens to be nearby, they'll start a chase with no problems.

284
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,180
Rym: Well, that happened when my bike got stolen the second to last time.

285
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:09,551
Rym: I called the police, and they were like, "When did it get

286
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:09,912
Rym: stolen?".

287
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,437
Rym: I was like, "In the last five minutes,

288
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:11,899
Rym: tops.".

289
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:15,880
Rym: And then cop cars rushed over and canvassed the area.

290
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:25,660
Rym: But when they didn't find the guy right away, they instead pressured me into not... They didn't actually want me to file a police report, because crime statistics.

291
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,379
Rym: So, here's the deal.

292
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:33,220
Rym: Police departments around the US are warning people that we have the technology now.

293
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:44,259
Rym: If your Xbox or your iPhone gets stolen, odds are you can use technology to find out what house it's in right now, because the people who steal them usually just fucking use them.

294
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:47,420
Rym: They just fucking use them because the cops don't do anything.

295
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:58,720
Scott: All the cops will actually do is take the serial numbers of those objects, if they're expensive, and give them to pawn shops, and then the legit pawn shops, which I guess if the criminal's really dumb, they'll take it to a legit pawn shop.

296
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,540
Rym: If the criminal's smart, he'll just use it as long as he can.

297
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,320
Scott: Or sell it to a non-legit pawn shop or something.

298
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,260
Rym: Just use it for your phone.

299
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:13,060
Scott: And if that serial number appears, those places are supposed to report it to the police or whatever, and they usually kind of do.

300
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,204
Rym: I guess.

301
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:15,960
Rym: I don't really interact a lot with pawn shops.

302
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Scott: That's really your only hope.

303
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:26,572
Rym: So, the police are warning people that even though we have this trivial technology to, "Oh, my iPhone was stolen, and it's at this apartment building.

304
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:27,997
Rym: Oh, it's walking down the street.

305
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:28,539
Rym: Oh, it's that

306
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:28,799
Rym: guy.".

307
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:32,260
Rym: They're telling us to not confront the people who have them to get them back.

308
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,790
Scott: Well, it is dangerous to do so.

309
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:35,260
Scott: There's no question about that.

310
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,473
Rym: And they're saying, "You should come to the

311
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:36,817
Rym: police.".

312
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,980
Rym: But I know for a fact that the police give zero shits about this.

313
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,451
Scott: I think the real solution here is legislative.

314
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:46,280
Scott: There needs to be a law that says the-- The police must investigate.

315
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:53,900
Scott: I think--no, it's the--I don't know what you should--something along the lines of the Consumer Detective Act.

316
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,740
Rym: Like, if you have on your own collected sufficient evidence that, you know-- I can shoot holes in this idea right now, but I'll let you finish.

317
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,259
Scott: Yeah.

318
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:16,139
Scott: I like the idea, but-- If you have proved and collected significant evidence, there needs to be a place where someone whose job it is to look at the evidence you brought-- Officer Scott, I've collected significant evidence that aliens stole my cell phone.

319
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,998
Scott: Wow.

320
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,420
Rym: Followed by literally thousands of pages of documentation.

321
00:16:22,803 --> 00:16:24,320
Scott: And your evidence is bullshit.

322
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,720
Rym: Yeah, my evidence is bullshit, so yeah, everyone's evidence is bullshit.

323
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,607
Scott: You just take it to this person who looks at it, and the person goes-- And I know how that'll work.

324
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:33,379
Rym: That person will say it's all bullshit no matter what.

325
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,338
Rym: Because they don't want to deal with it.

326
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,311
Scott: Point is, there should be, you know, obviously you have to word the law in a way.

327
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,020
Scott: a lawyer would word it so that there aren't stupid loopholes.

328
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,980
Scott: The Rym is shooting in a thing that I just said two words of.

329
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,810
Scott: Actually, all I would-- And the police will be forced by law to where.

330
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,336
Scott: if you say, "Find my iPhone.

331
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:50,718
Scott: Here it is.

332
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:51,139
Scott: It's in this

333
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:51,300
Scott: house.".

334
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,409
Scott: They have to go and get it.

335
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:53,599
Scott: Or you can sue them.

336
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:54,899
Scott: That's how it needs to be.

337
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,140
Rym: Or maybe it says if the police won't do it, you get a vigilante license.

338
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:00,326
Scott: The police won't do it.

339
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:03,040
Scott: They have to compensate you and give you what your iPhone is worth.

340
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,578
Rym: That'd be cool.

341
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,160
Scott: Right?

342
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,809
Scott: It's like, "I have proof my iPhone is in this house.

343
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,358
Scott: Either you help me go retrieve it, or you buy me a new

344
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:09,800
Scott: iPhone.".

345
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:11,469
Scott: And by law, they must do it.

346
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,460
Scott: And if they don't, you can take them to court.

347
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:15,917
Scott: And if you win in court, they pay your court fees too.

348
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:18,940
Scott: And compensate you for your time of going to court.

349
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:24,040
Scott: And the officer who refused gets fired and is never allowed to be police or military ever again in their whole lives.

350
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:31,220
Rym: This is a specific example of that situation where technology has gotten to a point to where we can do ghost-in-the-shell shit.

351
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,634
Rym: If someone steals your stuff, we know where it is.

352
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:34,238
Rym: Just go get it.

353
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,340
Scott: Right, but I'm not the invincible major who can actually go and get the thing.

354
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,773
Rym: Ah, but the police could use this technology to improve the quality of life of everyone.

355
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:49,820
Rym: I mean, imagine if all the petty crimes that were solvable by technology in New York City were solved.

356
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:58,300
Rym: I have a feeling that a large percentage of the people who are mugging people for their cell phones would no longer be in polite society within a few months.

357
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,180
Scott: I mean, if this law existed, I would buy a $2,000 bike, I'd put a GPS in it, right?

358
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:06,920
Rym: And I'd use my bike all the time.

359
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,485
Scott: I wouldn't even lock it.

360
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,399
Scott: I would leave that shit on the street, and I'd be like, "Go for

361
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:12,479
Scott: it.".

362
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:20,280
Rym: You know, Scott, I'm of the mind that while I want the government to take care of a lot of things, I believe in a modicum of due diligence.

363
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:26,800
Rym: Like, a guy shouldn't steal your car if you leave the keys in it, but if you leave the keys in it, you're a dumb fuck.

364
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:37,380
Scott: If I can find it, if I know with 100% certainty that if you take it, I'll know where it is, and you will be arrested, that's like bait.

365
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,780
Scott: I'd just buy shit that's expensive and leave it the fuck around with GPS in it, and it would just help fix the problem faster.

366
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:48,300
Rym: I start stealing bikes, putting them in Faraday cages and removing their obvious GPS units.

367
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:50,575
Scott: That's obviously, I said, if there's 100% certainty.

368
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:53,380
Rym: There's no certainty in life.

369
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,539
Scott: There is a certainty.

370
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,670
Rym: There's no certainty in anything.

371
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:56,419
Rym: Solipsism.

372
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:59,771
Rym: Anyway, my point is this.

373
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,580
Rym: This is a specific example.

374
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,051
Rym: I mean, we have friends who have had shit stolen.

375
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:05,920
Rym: Scott knew where his Xbox was.

376
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:12,640
Rym: Another friend actually had the ad for her bike that was stolen on Craigslist in her neighborhood.

377
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,859
Rym: The cops basically told her to go fuck herself.

378
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,320
Scott: Yep.

379
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:23,780
Rym: Either legislation needs to fix this or, guys, seriously, get a really big friend or find a Hell's Angel and just go get your phone back.

380
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,569
Scott: I think we should just start a company, right?

381
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:27,217
Scott: We hire some people who are like...

382
00:19:28,106 --> 00:19:29,020
Rym: Hire a vigilante.

383
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:37,920
Scott: No, we just hire people who were bounty hunters or were bouncers or those security professionals.

384
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,779
Scott: Legitimate people who aren't crazy in the head because a lot of people...

385
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,279
Rym: I would hire only off-duty cops.

386
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,295
Scott: Yeah, that's a good one, too.

387
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,020
Rym: Or retired cops.

388
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,388
Scott: Also good, right?

389
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:47,100
Scott: Any of those types of people, right?

390
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,640
Scott: And some of those people in those professions are crazy in the head, so we would make sure we only hire the not-crazy-in-the-head ones.

391
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:07,060
Scott: And all we would do is if you come to us and prove that your phone or your whatever is at a specific place with the serial numbers or some evidence that we're comfortable with, you pay us a fee and we will go and recover your item.

392
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:09,560
Scott: But we'll go with you to recover your item.

393
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:24,880
Rym: I'm mostly mad about the fact that police departments seem to be advocating that the correct solution to this is that stolen phones should have mandated kill switches to make them not valuable, as opposed to trivially arresting people who are probably guilty of more than one crime.

394
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:26,959
Scott: Well, here's the reason for that, right?

395
00:20:28,623 --> 00:20:31,740
Scott: They don't want you to go to someone's house because it's dangerous, right?

396
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:36,100
Scott: Killing the phone proposes no danger to anyone.

397
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:42,500
Scott: If a cop has to drive somewhere and knock on a door, that's one more dangerous situation they have to be in.

398
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,160
Scott: They would rather no one be in any dangerous situation.

399
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:47,038
Rym: But I would argue...

400
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,375
Scott: I'm like, sorry, your job is to go into the dangerous situation.

401
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:51,320
Scott: That's what you signed up for.

402
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,940
Scott: Someone has to do it.

403
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:53,940
Scott: That's a separate discussion.

404
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:58,480
Scott: When there's a cop has a funeral, isn't there all this talk about bravery and courage?

405
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:09,160
Scott: It's like our whole society now looks down on bravery as stupidity, but it's like they want to use the word all the time to congratulate themselves, but they don't want to actually practice it.

406
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,140
Scott: And the rare case that someone actually does, it's like, oh my God, it's like, no, all of you should be doing that, right?

407
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:27,540
Rym: I think there's a side discussion to be had here that in general, because the police by and large will not help people with the kinds of crimes that most people experience, people don't really trust the police.

408
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,000
Scott: That's one reason people don't trust the police.

409
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,338
Rym: I am way more nervous around police than I am around shady hooded figures in an alley at night.

410
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:35,940
Rym: Like, for real.

411
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,780
Scott: I would be much more afraid of weird things that could happen if I go to the police station and say the wrong thing.

412
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:44,600
Scott: And weird things that could happen if I go try to recover my phone.

413
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,799
Rym: The only thing I'm more afraid of than cops is judges.

414
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:54,160
Rym: When I'm in a courtroom, I'm just sitting perfectly silent, even if I'm not on trial, just like, please don't send me to jail for nothing.

415
00:21:55,342 --> 00:22:00,300
Rym: I guess I'd be more afraid if I was in a jail that they'd accidentally keep me there, but I don't go into jails.

416
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,719
Rym: And I will never will.

417
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:02,236
Scott: Or prison.

418
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,100
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

419
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:15,380
Scott: I'm just going to leave my phone here and call the police and be like, this guy, my friend stole my phone.

420
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,427
Rym: I'm sure they'll come after me.

421
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:17,476
Rym: I'm sure that'll happen.

422
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,820
Scott: You'll go to that jail you never wanted to go to.

423
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:23,400
Rym: I'm sure the police will get right on recovering that cell phone.

424
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:24,360
Scott: Maybe they will.

425
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,920
Rym: Meanwhile, I'll be in your apartment, I'll claim squatters rights.

426
00:22:27,983 --> 00:22:29,779
Rym: It'll take you at least three months to kick me out.

427
00:22:32,461 --> 00:22:36,180
Rym: Plus, I've never actually been convicted of trespassing, breaking, or entering.

428
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:38,439
Rym: Though I've been chased before.

429
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:41,539
Rym: So yeah, things of the day.

430
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,359
Rym: I've got kind of serious things of the day.

431
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,899
Scott: The mayonnaise is a big deal.

432
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:46,983
Rym: Mayonnaise?

433
00:22:47,003 --> 00:22:47,510
Scott: I don't like mayonnaise.

434
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,118
Scott: It doesn't taste good.

435
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:49,700
Rym: What the fuck, Scott?

436
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,899
Scott: Chipotle mayo tastes good.

437
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,540
Rym: That's just mayo plus something.

438
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,580
Scott: Yeah, but that covers up the nasty taste of regular mayonnaise.

439
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:57,660
Rym: How can you hate mayonnaise?

440
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,318
Rym: It's disgusting.

441
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,780
Rym: It's as American as apple pie and trans fat.

442
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,720
Scott: I'd never put mayonnaise on something on purpose.

443
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,400
Scott: If I get like a chicken sandwich or something, it happens to be on there.

444
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,959
Scott: It's like, okay, but yeah, I'd never put mayonnaise on something intentionally.

445
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:11,266
Rym: So, mayone.us.

446
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:13,000
Rym: We don't talk about politics often on GeekNights.

447
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,439
Rym: We will do a Thursday show about this in depth later.

448
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,260
Rym: Scott and I both gave money to a super PAC.

449
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,358
Rym: That shit doesn't happen.

450
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:35,880
Rym: So, I urge you to go to this thing, read about it, and consider the fact that me, I'm a little more politically motivated, and Scott gave money to a political cause.

451
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,200
Scott: Well, it's, you know, why'd lack political motivation?

452
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,480
Scott: Because government's just fucking corrupt and you're not gonna do anything anyway.

453
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:47,820
Rym: Yeah, Lawrence Lessig's argument, corruption is the first thing we have to solve.

454
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,559
Rym: We can't solve anything until we solve corruption.

455
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:50,868
Scott: I 100% agree with that.

456
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,579
Scott: I agreed with it before he even said it.

457
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:59,940
Rym: So, as I've noticed, I was going through some of the details, it seems like mostly Democrats are on board with this, and mostly Republicans are not.

458
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,000
Scott: Well, but they're both corrupt as fuck.

459
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,920
Rym: Yeah, they are, but Democrats are at least paying this some lip service.

460
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:05,918
Scott: Okay, sure.

461
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,200
Scott: He's been playing at lip service for how many years and done nothing.

462
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:09,621
Rym: He?

463
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:11,616
Rym: So, the Democrats are embodied as a male?

464
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:15,935
Scott: Obama, specifically, said in his campaign- Oh, Obama.

465
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:24,459
Scott: Yes, he specifically said that he would do things to fight, you know, the influence of money in Washington, and it's been like six years, and he's done nothing.

466
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,760
Rym: Well, because it's Congress's job, really.

467
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:29,110
Scott: He didn't even say anything.

468
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,900
Scott: Since being elected, he did nothing.

469
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,680
Scott: Didn't even say something, like, "Hey, Congress-".

470
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,260
Rym: Well, that's because he's too busy covering up the aliens at Benghazi.

471
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,202
Scott: Obviously.

472
00:24:36,383 --> 00:24:40,020
Scott: Actually, Bill Clinton said, there was an interview with him, unrelated.

473
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,360
Scott: Well, somewhat related.

474
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,020
Scott: He said that when he became president, he sent his aides to go check out Area 51 for aliens, and that there weren't any.

475
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:53,421
Rym: Yeah, I'm sure that, one, even if- I mean, I'm assuming there's no aliens in Area 51.

476
00:24:53,421 --> 00:25:03,260
Rym: But, if there were, the aides who came back were either lizard people, clones- Of course.

477
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,140
Rym: And if he said he wanted to go there himself, they'd just drive him to some warehouse somewhere.

478
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:17,900
Scott: But anyway, the mayonnaise, right, the deal is, is they're gonna have a super PAC, and use the money to, basically, run ads to make sure that corrupt fucking congressmen don't get elected.

479
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:25,360
Scott: On an individual level, so they're gonna pick specific elections- And beat them, so they don't get elected back into Congress.

480
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:36,080
Rym: They're trying to get the most bang for their buck, and, basically, the deal is, if they get a million dollars worth of pledges, they have unnamed donors who will match that, doubling our power.

481
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:48,460
Scott: So there are at least some rich people who don't want to have to pay- They would rather not have to pay Washington and have the government be uncorrupt, than just pay Washington and get what they want.

482
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,459
Rym: Now, this is the same Lawrence Lessig that you're thinking of.

483
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:59,640
Rym: He's also proposed a constitutional amendment in his free ebook, One Way Forward, that is a specific proposal on a way to fix this problem.

484
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,640
Rym: Since no one paid attention to that, he's doing this instead.

485
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,660
Scott: Right, now how much confidence do I have that this will work in any way?

486
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:06,540
Rym: More than zero!

487
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,292
Scott: More than zero, which isn't much, but you know what?

488
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:10,860
Scott: What else has any chance at all?

489
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,980
Scott: Nothing realistic that anyone has proposed or is doing at all in any way, anywhere.

490
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,800
Rym: The money I gave this thing probably counts more than any vote I've ever cast.

491
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:29,120
Scott: Right, so, I mean, the arrow's probably gonna miss, but no one else shooting any, so might as well shoot if I don't pay and ain't gonna shoot.

492
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,299
Rym: Unless he's aiming at us, but at least it's Lawrence Lessig.

493
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,559
Rym: He definitely is not aiming at us.

494
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,100
Scott: Look, guys, if we can- Lawrence Lessig, certified, smart, good person.

495
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,960
Rym: If we can't trust Lawrence Lessig, we should just end human society right now, because we're fucked.

496
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:53,020
Scott: One thing I am worried about, right, and this is sort of con- also cons- you know, speaking of aliens, conspiracy nuttiness, right, but if this shit starts to move, right, it's sort of like, it's all him, right?

497
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:56,779
Scott: If someone tries to assassinate him, what are we gonna do?

498
00:26:58,642 --> 00:27:13,100
Rym: No one cares about it now, but if there's significant progress, and we're getting close to the point where we can do something- He assembled a board of directors that- imagine if you did this, and you assembled the board of directors of people to work with you on it.

499
00:27:13,643 --> 00:27:14,409
Rym: He did the same thing.

500
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:15,820
Rym: He's got a bunch of people working on it.

501
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:17,899
Rym: You'd probably have to take all of them out.

502
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:24,709
Scott: Listen, these powers that be that can control a government with money can kill a bunch of people in a- I'm gonna make a reference.

503
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:26,020
Rym: I'm curious if you get this reference.

504
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,509
Rym: You got to be a spirit.

505
00:27:27,832 --> 00:27:28,800
Rym: You can't be no ghost.

506
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:29,800
Scott: Okay.

507
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,048
Rym: It's ultra relevant.

508
00:27:33,557 --> 00:27:34,080
Rym: You have no idea?

509
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:38,120
Scott: I know, it's that movie where the guy's president but he doesn't give a shit.

510
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,709
Rym: Okay, you know.

511
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:39,320
Rym: Bullworth.

512
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:39,677
Scott: Yeah.

513
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,242
Scott: Yeah.

514
00:27:40,685 --> 00:27:41,148
Rym: Good movie.

515
00:27:41,631 --> 00:27:42,840
Rym: Really depressing movie.

516
00:27:43,623 --> 00:27:46,476
Scott: I prefer Dave, which is just like, "I'm president?

517
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:47,279
Scott: Yeah, I'm just gonna do

518
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:47,400
Scott: it.".

519
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:49,680
Rym: Dave is the eagle of American politics.

520
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,766
Scott: That's exactly right.

521
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,680
Scott: Yeah, Dave and Eagle are my style.

522
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,989
Rym: Yeah, I think Bullworth is the-.

523
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,460
Rym: no, this is how it really would go down.

524
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:55,917
Rym: That's right.

525
00:27:57,905 --> 00:27:58,679
Rym: So you got a thing of the day?

526
00:27:59,061 --> 00:27:59,423
Scott: I do.

527
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:02,040
Scott: So this guy had this idea, genius idea.

528
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:07,325
Scott: Every day he gets up and looks in the mirror in the bathroom, and he sees his ugly face, and he says, "You know what?

529
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,860
Scott: It'd be really cool if when I looked at this mirror, I saw other things while I was brushing my teeth.

530
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,340
Scott: For example, maybe news headlines, or the weather, and we have technology.

531
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,288
Scott: Why can't that happen?

532
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:17,620
Scott: How much time would I save?

533
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,149
Scott: I wouldn't sit at my computer.

534
00:28:19,472 --> 00:28:20,580
Scott: I could do two things at once.

535
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,900
Scott: I could wash my face and my hands and also get the news reading done.

536
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:25,280
Scott: How much time would I save in the morning?

537
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:27,774
Scott: I could bike around a little bit and then go to

538
00:28:27,815 --> 00:28:27,976
Scott: work.".

539
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:30,339
Scott: So you know what he does?

540
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,139
Scott: He goes and first he acquires a piece of observation glass, which is not the same as one-way glass.

541
00:28:37,823 --> 00:28:41,200
Scott: One-way glass is one side is black and the other side you see through.

542
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,740
Scott: Or one side is a mirror and the other side you see through.

543
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:52,960
Scott: This is what they have in police observation rooms, where if the lights in one room are on and the other ones are off, then you can only see through one way and the other side's a mirror.

544
00:28:53,322 --> 00:28:56,200
Scott: But if the lights in both rooms are on, it's just a piece of glass.

545
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:58,120
Scott: And it's crazy that that even works.

546
00:28:58,241 --> 00:28:59,960
Scott: But I'm sure the internet will tell you how that works.

547
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:01,640
Scott: I didn't look it up on the internet yet.

548
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:15,059
Scott: Then he took that piece of glass that it was kind of hard to get, actually, and he put a monitor behind it, and he made a webpage on the monitor with a Raspberry Pi with a black screen, and he only put the stuff he wanted to see in white text.

549
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:20,019
Scott: So it's like a mirror that he can look at his own face in, but then information shows through.

550
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,812
Rym: That's the kind of thing you see in movies that you think, "Oh, that'd be really

551
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:23,037
Rym: cool.".

552
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,380
Scott: Well, it exists today and you can build your own and maybe you can turn it into a product.

553
00:29:27,941 --> 00:29:29,500
Rym: And hopefully not burn your bathroom down.

554
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,840
Scott: And get a good price in observation glass and shitty Chinese LCD screens.

555
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:36,599
Rym: I'd be worried about burning my bathroom down, at least a little bit.

556
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,351
Scott: Oh, maybe you don't put it in the bathroom.

557
00:29:38,371 --> 00:29:39,220
Scott: Maybe it's a bedroom mirror.

558
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:40,912
Rym: I don't have a bedroom mirror.

559
00:29:40,972 --> 00:29:41,599
Rym: Maybe I should get one.

560
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,780
Scott: So you can look at your -- hang it on the ceiling?

561
00:29:44,804 --> 00:29:47,720
Rym: The only mirror I have is in the bathroom, which sometimes is a problem, actually.

562
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:53,400
Scott: The only thing I really like -- my mirror is gigantic in the bathroom, but I lack the full-length mirror.

563
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,118
Rym: Because you really got to see if those slacks are -- I know.

564
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,000
Rym: Matching the purse and the shoes.

565
00:29:59,520 --> 00:29:59,587
Rym: Yep.

566
00:30:01,242 --> 00:30:02,039
Rym: All right, metamoment.

567
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:02,304
Scott: Oh.

568
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:03,039
Scott: Connecticut.

569
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:04,597
Rym: It's coming up.

570
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,980
Scott: Oh, is it the next convention?

571
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,898
Rym: It's the next convention we're going to be going to.

572
00:30:09,061 --> 00:30:10,120
Rym: So Connecticut's awesome.

573
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,400
Rym: If you didn't submit a panel, well, it's way too fucking late for that.

574
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:16,800
Rym: I'm in the middle of scheduling everything, currently.

575
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:19,660
Rym: Yeah, Connecticut's awesome.

576
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:26,219
Rym: It's the best non-Pax, non-Magfest gaming convention I can think of in the United States.

577
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,310
Scott: Okay.

578
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,718
Rym: Pretty much straight up.

579
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,378
Scott: All right.

580
00:30:30,081 --> 00:30:32,480
Scott: Other news I can see on my calendar.

581
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,000
Scott: Today is Cinco de Mayo.

582
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:35,600
Scott: Party.

583
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,499
Rym: I saw the most racist ad that a frat put out for their Drinco -- It was all Corona?

584
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:46,680
Rym: They put on a Drinco del Mayo event, and the poster was racist to the point of,

585
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:47,428
Rym: "Ah.".

586
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:47,583
Scott: Ah.

587
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,167
Rym: Ah.

588
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:50,600
Rym: It was really bad.

589
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:53,140
Rym: I think their frat guy kicked off campus, though.

590
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:53,558
Scott: Good.

591
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:58,939
Scott: I guess the Netrunner Regionals, where I live, are coming up.

592
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,407
Scott: So there's one on the 28th -- oh, 21st of June, and one on the 19th of July.

593
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,357
Scott: All right.

594
00:31:06,722 --> 00:31:08,100
Scott: One's in Boston, one's in Philly.

595
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,118
Scott: Fuck you, not putting one in New York.

596
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,839
Scott: What other news is there, really, for meta-ness?

597
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:17,698
Scott: Oh, the book club is -- You forgot the name again.

598
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:18,860
Rym: It's your book.

599
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:19,733
Rym: Yup.

600
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,096
Rym: Yup.

601
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,319
Scott: I didn't start reading it yet.

602
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:22,358
Scott: I probably should acquire it.

603
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,280
Rym: I'll acquire it and read it because I'm flying.

604
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,739
Rym: There's going to be no GeekNights next week.

605
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:30,960
Rym: I've got to fly to London and Stockholm and Hamburg and Dublin.

606
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,018
Scott: I guess I'll be biking and Netrunning.

607
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:33,871
Rym: Yup.

608
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:35,380
Rym: So no GeekNights.

609
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,680
Rym: We'll see if we get anything done this coming weekend to have a little bit of bonus content along the way.

610
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:40,679
Rym: Stay tuned.

611
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,960
Rym: Tuesday episodes of GeekNights will be streaming live on Twitch once we short out the rest of the shit to make that happen.

612
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,319
Rym: A lot of shit that has to be sorted for that.

613
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:48,708
Scott: Yup.

614
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:52,720
Scott: For other things, check out all our stuff on the internet.

615
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,860
Scott: We have YouTube channels, even though mine's mostly Netrunner videos.

616
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,300
Rym: Mine's mostly GeekNights lectures.

617
00:31:58,201 --> 00:31:59,260
Scott: We've got Twitters.

618
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,298
Scott: We've got Facebooks.

619
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:00,934
Scott: We've got Google+.

620
00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:01,776
Scott: We have IRC.

621
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,554
Scott: We have a newsletter that I said I was going to write, but I didn't write, but I'm going to add it to my.

622
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:06,960
Scott: Remember the Milk right the fuck now.

623
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,839
Rym: Well, I forgot about it after last show.

624
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,309
Scott: Yup.

625
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,339
Scott: I can't log in to Remember the Milk right now.

626
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,500
Scott: But anyway, I'm definitely going to write another newsletter.

627
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,600
Rym: I'm definitely going to forget it until Wednesday.

628
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:16,738
Rym: We have forums.

629
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,660
Scott: Sign up for them.

630
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,300
Scott: We have every possible thing on the internet.

631
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,079
Scott: However you communicate on the internet, you should go.

632
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,840
Rym: But Black Dynamite, I only use Gopher.

633
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:27,360
Scott: Gopher's dead, Black Dynamite.

634
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,240
Scott: It hasn't been used since, like, I'm sure someone's going to tell me it's not dead, but it might as well be dead, right?

635
00:32:33,423 --> 00:32:34,079
Rym: It's pretty much dead.

636
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,451
Rym: Yeah.

637
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:39,280
Scott: Any place you go on the internet to communicate and be with people, we are in that place.

638
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,379
Scott: If you're listening to this, why would you not also be in that place with us?

639
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:43,659
Scott: At least a little bit.

640
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,860
Scott: Go find that place and be happy.

641
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,500
Rym: So, you bought some technology.

642
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,699
Scott: I guess I did.

643
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:55,500
Scott: So, I bought this camera that we sort of needed, I guess.

644
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,200
Scott: I mean, we didn't 100% need it, but if we want to do awesome video shit.

645
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,740
Rym: It could be argued that we needed it to justify the cost.

646
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,759
Scott: Sure, maybe.

647
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:07,997
Scott: So, the camera I got is the GH4.

648
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,000
Scott: Panasonic GH4, which is a Micro Four Thirds mirrorless camera.

649
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,860
Scott: But the main feature of it, compared to the GH3, is that it can record 4K video.

650
00:33:19,682 --> 00:33:21,191
Scott: And it's only, like, $1,700, which is very expensive.

651
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:30,100
Scott: But compared to any other camera that shoots 4K, that's not like a tiny GoPro or something, this is pretty much it.

652
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,500
Scott: Like, the next cheapest camera is, like, $4,000.

653
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,320
Scott: And after that, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars to shoot 4K video.

654
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,699
Scott: So, that's sort of ridiculous that it even exists.

655
00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:41,260
Scott: And it's pretty incredible.

656
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:46,660
Scott: You can basically use this shit to make professional movies and TV shows, like Hollywood level.

657
00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:52,500
Scott: You know, you might need extra equipment around the camera, such as lighting and such and such.

658
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,040
Rym: Yep, that's where I've been acquiring surprisingly expensive doodads.

659
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,319
Scott: Yep, lighting, lenses, et cetera, et cetera.

660
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,631
Scott: But the camera on its own for $1,700 does all that.

661
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:09,620
Scott: Upgrade, and it helped, because I had a GF2 going to the GH4, right?

662
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,060
Scott: And they both used the same Micro Four Thirds lenses.

663
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,737
Scott: So, it's like, "Oh, all the lenses I already bought are still

664
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:16,018
Scott: good.".

665
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:26,260
Scott: And, you know, I sort of realized, since starting to get cameras that actually change lenses, the lenses are the more expensive part, and they're the part you actually care about, right?

666
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,880
Scott: Because you buy a lens, it's good for fucking ever, right?

667
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,920
Scott: The body of the camera, it's like, that shit, you just get new ones every few years, right?

668
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,840
Scott: That shit gets out of date.

669
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:41,070
Rym: So, we'll see what we can do with this.

670
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:49,050
Rym: I mean, there's a lot of, like, basically what we have to do now, me and Scott, is with this new camera and actually trying to do video content on a regular basis.

671
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:58,470
Rym: You might remember the old, old days of GeekNights, like eight years ago, where it took us a while to make a pipeline that we follow the pipeline and GeekNights comes out.

672
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:03,410
Rym: Like, it used to be, like, every night we'd, like, talk for an hour about what we were going to do the show on.

673
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,049
Rym: We'd fuck around the mixer and plug a bunch of stuff in.

674
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,330
Rym: We'd talk a bunch, re-talk some stuff.

675
00:35:09,671 --> 00:35:13,530
Rym: I'd edit for, like, two hours, start the encoder, that would take, like, a half hour.

676
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,990
Rym: Then we, like, manually input all this data into a website on a pretty primitive backend.

677
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:27,450
Rym: It was a tough time, and over time, we refined, refined, refined, and now it takes about five more minutes than the time we spend talking to do an episode.

678
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:28,688
Rym: So, we got a good pipeline there.

679
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,609
Rym: Video's an order of magnitude more work.

680
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:39,690
Scott: I don't think it will be possible to get the video pipeline down, and let me tell you, I used the camera to record some Netrunner games, right?

681
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:45,630
Scott: I did it in 1080p, not 4K, and I did it at the lowest bitrate, which is 50 megabits per second.

682
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:52,670
Scott: You could take it all the way up to 200 megabits per second, 1080p, which will do something called All Eye.

683
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:58,450
Scott: So, what All Eye is, is normally, when you're, like, because it's recording, like, an MOV or MP4, right?

684
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:06,540
Scott: Normally, if there's, like, two frames of video next to each other, and one pixel is the same color in both frames, it doesn't store the pixel twice.

685
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,390
Scott: It's just, like, yeah, that pixel's the same, bro.

686
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:10,250
Scott: And it saves space that way, right?

687
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,150
Scott: When you do All Eye, it actually stores each frame individually.

688
00:36:14,691 --> 00:36:21,270
Scott: So, if you edit it in After Effects or something, or Photoshop, right, you can edit all the frames individually, right?

689
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:23,295
Scott: So, I didn't even use that mode.

690
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:26,183
Scott: I used the 50 megabit per second, 30 FPS mode, well, 29.97 FPS mode.

691
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,590
Rym: Ooh, not even 60 for that good action?

692
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:34,490
Scott: Yeah, and I recorded all these, you know, four rounds of Netrunners.

693
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:38,242
Scott: It took up almost the whole 128 gig SD card.

694
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:45,470
Scott: Yeah, well, it took an hour just to transfer that to the computer.

695
00:36:45,691 --> 00:37:00,708
Rym: Welcome to my world, where our existing pipeline to video like a GeekNights lecture, which is an hour long, on my old prosumer camcorder that has a 300 gig hard drive in it, compressed pretty heavily the video that comes out, 1080p60.

696
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:09,390
Rym: It's about 20 to 30 gigabytes per panel, and that's with old-as-shit technology, heavily compressed.

697
00:37:10,872 --> 00:37:16,410
Rym: And it takes me a while to turn that into a resulting video that is now for people to watch on YouTube.

698
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,421
Rym: So, you gonna store all that B-roll forever?

699
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:21,070
Rym: Hold on to that B-roll?

700
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:22,300
Scott: It's not B-roll.

701
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:23,027
Rym: It's the A-roll.

702
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,310
Scott: It's only A-roll.

703
00:37:24,531 --> 00:37:25,330
Rym: You gonna hold on to that A-roll?

704
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:26,608
Scott: I got space.

705
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:27,694
Rym: For now.

706
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:29,929
Rym: How many Netrunner things you gonna go to?

707
00:37:30,537 --> 00:37:30,808
Scott: A lot.

708
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:36,761
Rym: So, I'm already working on a pipeline for massive video files.

709
00:37:36,782 --> 00:37:39,990
Rym: I might have to upgrade my computer in the near future to handle this stuff.

710
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,817
Scott: My computer is pretty much as upgraded as it gets.

711
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:44,630
Scott: I mean, my NAS is full of drives.

712
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:53,270
Scott: So, you know, there's not really much I can upgrade other than getting some like monster servers or something else you can do, right?

713
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:59,830
Scott: And this is what Vimeo actually does, is when they need to encode, when you send your video upload to Vimeo to get encoded, right?

714
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:06,750
Scott: They send your video to all these Amazon instances that just spring up, encode your video, and then shut down, right?

715
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:12,490
Scott: So, you can just like get, you know, some ridiculous cloud server on Amazon.

716
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:24,110
Scott: If your internet is fast enough, upload your video, encode it, download it again, and you'll actually, if your bandwidth, if your download and upload are fast enough, you'll actually save time because the encoding will be so fast.

717
00:38:24,651 --> 00:38:32,310
Scott: And you got some ridiculously powerful machine to do the encoding, which costs a lot of money, but you're only using it for what, five minutes?

718
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:38,530
Scott: So, you only paid like a dollar to use that machine for five minutes maybe, right?

719
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:43,650
Scott: And you can actually, you know, if it saves you a lot of time, that's fucking worth it, right?

720
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:46,050
Scott: I would pay a dollar to save a couple hours of time.

721
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,112
Rym: Yup, absolutely.

722
00:38:48,174 --> 00:38:56,210
Rym: But all that aside, what I've been researching, and I actually haven't bought anything yet because it's a very complex field made more complex by the fact that we live in New York.

723
00:38:57,051 --> 00:38:59,290
Rym: We want good microphones.

724
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,850
Scott: We have lots of good microphones.

725
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,770
Rym: We do, but they're very bad, they're good for recording like GeekNights.

726
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:10,469
Rym: They're not good for recording lectures at conventions because we can't bring all this shit with us.

727
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:13,139
Rym: And even then it's hard to integrate it into their systems.

728
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:15,970
Rym: and then on video, like we don't like to hold microphones.

729
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,190
Scott: Yeah, holding microphones on video is only good in certain situations.

730
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:27,010
Scott: Usually where, you know, if you're doing like a TV show, like where you're a sitcom, you don't want to see anything on the screen, right?

731
00:39:27,111 --> 00:39:28,801
Scott: So you need to have a boom guy, right?

732
00:39:28,862 --> 00:39:30,130
Scott: Holding the microphone up above.

733
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,009
Rym: Or a bunch of lavaliers, a lot of ways you can do it.

734
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,070
Scott: You don't use lavaliers when you don't want anyone to see the microphone at all.

735
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:35,550
Scott: It depends.

736
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:40,950
Scott: On a sitcom, but you could use lavaliers on, say, a talk show where it's okay for people to see that, right?

737
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:50,770
Scott: But then if you're like, you know, doing an interview with someone on the street, holding a microphone as a news reporter, that's okay with a little box around it, you know, and you kind of want to have that.

738
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,770
Scott: You want that there, right?

739
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,850
Scott: That's like the thing that people are used to seeing and you get your logo on there and everything.

740
00:39:55,251 --> 00:40:02,750
Scott: And it also helps not just on the screen when people are watching at home, but also in person, like when you're on the street, right?

741
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,290
Scott: You can't just wire someone up with a lavalier to interview them, right?

742
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,469
Scott: But you still need to mic them.

743
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,550
Rym: It's interesting because I've seen a lot of reporters do just that when they're interviewing people.

744
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,670
Scott: They wire people up with a lavalier.

745
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,870
Rym: Yeah, they wire you up with a lavalier and then they do the interview and then they take it off.

746
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,681
Scott: It's so much faster to just walk up to somebody like, "Hey, how you

747
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:17,943
Scott: doing?".

748
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,070
Scott: Shove the microphone in their face.

749
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,181
Rym: Yeah, it depends on what you're doing there.

750
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:21,050
Rym: So hence, pipeline.

751
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:28,250
Rym: So the problem is, the one thing that really prevents this from being easy, we don't have studio space.

752
00:40:28,742 --> 00:40:28,848
Scott: No.

753
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:34,370
Rym: And even if we did, we're kind of trying to get studio space in the city somewhere.

754
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:42,570
Scott: Just to the west of my apartment near the bake shop, there's all sorts of industrial-ish, empty-ish places.

755
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:47,250
Scott: And there's a lot of tiny businesses that have moved in there, like Random Hair Salon.

756
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:51,343
Scott: I saw yesterday, there's some Bosnian group hang out.

757
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:52,266
Scott: They bought a space.

758
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,370
Scott: They're renting it or whatever.

759
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,904
Scott: And they were just Bosnian dudes hanging out together.

760
00:40:55,924 --> 00:40:56,870
Scott: And it's like, that's cool.

761
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,170
Rym: We should make a gaming society that's like that.

762
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,577
Scott: I'm sure we can find a space.

763
00:41:00,879 --> 00:41:02,770
Scott: We just need to find a way to pay for it.

764
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,489
Rym: Yeah, but it's also a space that we'll then be leaving a lot of very expensive equipment in.

765
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:07,872
Scott: Yeah, well, you know.

766
00:41:08,213 --> 00:41:15,310
Scott: But the other key is that for lighting, to save a lot of money, if you could get some west- or east-facing windows.

767
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,889
Rym: Yeah, because we totally do all our video when the sun's out.

768
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:25,150
Scott: What I'm saying is, if you can get some east- or west-facing windows, you can do video in the morning or the afternoon when the sun is shining right through those windows.

769
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:31,230
Rym: Actually, through the windows like that usually is not great lighting, just because of the angles involved and the glass.

770
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,690
Scott: The sun is the best light.

771
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:34,055
Rym: Yeah, naked sun.

772
00:41:34,115 --> 00:41:36,890
Rym: Not sun, through glass at an angle that you can't control.

773
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,490
Scott: No, we're talking about huge fucking windows, not tiny little box windows.

774
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,649
Rym: Yeah, that doesn't exist here.

775
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:41,612
Scott: It does.

776
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:44,946
Scott: Some guy was telling me how he bought a space.

777
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,257
Rym: Yeah, you told me about this guy.

778
00:41:47,357 --> 00:41:49,367
Rym: Yeah, that's not going to happen.

779
00:41:49,427 --> 00:41:49,889
Rym: Not feasible.

780
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,870
Rym: Also then, what, we're only going to do video on Saturday and Sunday during the golden hour?

781
00:41:54,475 --> 00:41:56,289
Scott: Well, only video that needs to be really bright.

782
00:41:58,193 --> 00:42:01,160
Rym: So, here's an example of a very specific issue.

783
00:42:01,661 --> 00:42:05,310
Rym: I'm not going to install booms in my house for microphones.

784
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:10,390
Rym: And I can't pad the entire living room in acoustic foam.

785
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:19,090
Rym: So, the only way to get good audio when we do a video is either to close mic us with our existing Geeknives microphones.

786
00:42:19,211 --> 00:42:20,269
Scott: Which you'll see in the video.

787
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,130
Rym: Which wouldn't be that bad.

788
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:24,449
Scott: We could dub over ourselves.

789
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,129
Rym: Yeah, because we'll totally do that.

790
00:42:26,352 --> 00:42:26,710
Rym: ADR.

791
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:27,649
Rym: That'll totally happen.

792
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:28,573
Scott: It'll be hilarious.

793
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:28,754
Scott: ADR.

794
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:39,230
Rym: But because of the restrictions on the room and the fact that I also don't want to just tear apart the living room every time we do video.

795
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,130
Rym: Because the idea is we're going to be doing video like once a week.

796
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:42,949
Scott: Well, hopefully.

797
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,330
Rym: Yeah, or at least once every other week.

798
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:44,928
Scott: Make more videos.

799
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:51,390
Rym: So, I need microphones that don't require shit to be set up in the living room to do it.

800
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:58,630
Rym: Because right now, either I put these microphones in front of our faces and then they cast shadows because despite all the lights I own, there's still not enough lights.

801
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:02,850
Rym: We can't be far enough away from the background to just green screen or whatever it out.

802
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:10,670
Rym: So, the other option is I can mount one boom higher up temporarily and do a stereo mic from the ceiling.

803
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,188
Rym: And it works okay, but the audio's not great.

804
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:17,050
Rym: And it's a giant pain in the ass to set that up every time.

805
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:26,710
Rym: So, what we want is if Scott's buying an expensive camera, I've been investigating to buy the E6 Countryman head-mounted microphone.

806
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,530
Rym: Which appears to be the best head-mounted microphone.

807
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:31,970
Scott: That's the one they use in the TED Talks.

808
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,700
Scott: It's like a little flesh-colored stick.

809
00:43:35,302 --> 00:43:37,250
Scott: Most of the equipment is on your ear, right?

810
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:40,450
Scott: And then it's just sort of this little stick that comes out and then in front of your mouth.

811
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:41,570
Rym: It is so tiny.

812
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:44,810
Scott: You can see it, but you forget it's there.

813
00:43:45,211 --> 00:43:49,910
Scott: It's great if you don't care if someone sees it, but you want really high quality and you don't want to hold anything.

814
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,690
Rym: Everyone I've ever talked to, all the research I've ever done, this is the fucking best.

815
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:56,969
Rym: So, duh, we'll get that.

816
00:43:57,272 --> 00:43:57,430
Scott: Right.

817
00:43:57,672 --> 00:43:57,758
Rym: Yeah.

818
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,410
Scott: But you gotta plug that shit into something.

819
00:43:59,650 --> 00:43:59,811
Rym: Yeah.

820
00:43:59,993 --> 00:44:02,050
Rym: Now, here's where it gets complicated and annoying.

821
00:44:02,411 --> 00:44:09,630
Rym: This is where professional equipment is so much more expensive and harder to deal with than prosumer equipment.

822
00:44:10,072 --> 00:44:10,955
Rym: Like Scott's camera.

823
00:44:11,297 --> 00:44:14,710
Rym: If we want to do full-on, full-on video, camera's not enough.

824
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:18,590
Rym: We need this huge base station to plug into it, which is like two grand by itself.

825
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:19,232
Scott: Right.

826
00:44:19,272 --> 00:44:23,550
Scott: This camera, the reason I got it is because of that very reason, right?

827
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:30,290
Scott: It's this weird piece of equipment in that, in the hands of a pro with all this extra shit, it can get the job done.

828
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,031
Scott: It's great.

829
00:44:31,272 --> 00:44:38,490
Scott: But also, you could just, as a photographer, just a normal person, it's totally usable, just on its own.

830
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:49,390
Scott: It's extreme rarity, right, in the world of audio/video production, that this one thing, like, expands such a wide range of amateur to professional use.

831
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:49,690
Rym: Yup.

832
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:55,590
Rym: But even then, you need all this extra equipment and pipelines to do the, like, if you want to use it in a studio, you need a bunch of other shit.

833
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:55,851
Scott: Yeah.

834
00:44:55,871 --> 00:45:01,270
Scott: It's like, if you just take this to your house and, like, take a video of you, it'll probably be a good video, right?

835
00:45:01,511 --> 00:45:04,089
Scott: But it's not going to look like a fucking Hollywood movie.

836
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:08,056
Rym: So here's the complication with the E6 microphone.

837
00:45:08,277 --> 00:45:15,150
Rym: For one, it has a ridiculous number of options that if you don't already, if you aren't already an expert in this stuff, it won't make any sense.

838
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:17,370
Scott: What could the options possibly be?

839
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:22,209
Rym: It has to do with the kind of cartridge in it, how directional it is, how much padding it has.

840
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,210
Scott: Wouldn't there just be the one they use at TED Talks?

841
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,722
Rym: They use different ones for different people.

842
00:45:28,004 --> 00:45:28,970
Rym: There's a lot of options.

843
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,162
Rym: So we know that stuff.

844
00:45:31,343 --> 00:45:32,230
Rym: We sort that stuff out.

845
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:33,288
Scott: That's crazy though, right?

846
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:34,307
Rym: Yeah, it is.

847
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:38,050
Scott: It's like, there's no different SM58s for different people, right?

848
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:38,951
Rym: Yeah.

849
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:43,750
Rym: Well, do you use an SM58 or a beta 87A or a beta 58?

850
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,359
Scott: This is a beta 58A.

851
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:46,321
Rym: Yeah, I bought that specifically.

852
00:45:47,352 --> 00:45:48,969
Scott: Do you need different ones or different people?

853
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:50,844
Rym: So my microphone is a beta 87A.

854
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:51,972
Scott: Oh.

855
00:45:53,932 --> 00:45:55,907
Rym: It's got a more cardioid pattern.

856
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:56,370
Rym: It's a hypercardioid.

857
00:45:57,016 --> 00:45:57,228
Rym: Okay.

858
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,730
Rym: Which means if I move my head too much, suddenly I'm really quiet.

859
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:02,470
Scott: You also just talked really quietly.

860
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:03,034
Rym: No, I guess I did.

861
00:46:03,315 --> 00:46:07,490
Rym: Talking at the same volume, now I'm next to the microphone, now I'm going back to the front of the microphone.

862
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,990
Rym: So anyway, tons of options, tons of complicated shit.

863
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:13,510
Rym: But we know this stuff, so that's fine, and this thing's the best.

864
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,050
Rym: So what do you plug it into?

865
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:25,230
Rym: Well, if we just wanted to do video in the house, I could get it hardwired to XLR, powered with phantom power, plug it directly into the mixer with a cable.

866
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,610
Scott: But that has a long-ass wire.

867
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:27,059
Rym: That's fine.

868
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:27,570
Rym: That's doable.

869
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,929
Scott: And we couldn't really walk around a lot either.

870
00:46:29,093 --> 00:46:29,490
Scott: Easily doable.

871
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,435
Scott: How do you hide that wire?

872
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,930
Scott: Down your shirt, down your pants, onto the floor, across the room?

873
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,190
Rym: Well, down your shirt, down your pants, behind us is sitting the Marantz.

874
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:37,188
Scott: Oh, okay.

875
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:37,875
Rym: That kind of rhymed.

876
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:39,389
Rym: Like, that actually would work pretty well.

877
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:42,450
Rym: There are cases where I would want to use the wired option.

878
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:48,669
Rym: Like, for example, if I'm just doing a Twitch video and I got my face on screen and doing some stuff, I'd kind of just want to plug it into the mixer and go.

879
00:46:49,091 --> 00:46:56,809
Scott: You could also just, like, walk around the convention and sort of have the Marantz hanging, like, behind you on your belt, flapping against your butt.

880
00:46:57,211 --> 00:46:57,901
Rym: So here's how we do it.

881
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:58,490
Rym: I wear the Marantz.

882
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:59,054
Scott: You're wearing the thing.

883
00:46:59,094 --> 00:47:01,389
Scott: The wires are behind you, but the video's only in front of you.

884
00:47:01,811 --> 00:47:03,150
Scott: And the Marantz is battery-powered.

885
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:03,683
Scott: Yeah.

886
00:47:04,314 --> 00:47:05,950
Scott: So we can sync that shit up later.

887
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,202
Rym: Lots of stuff we can do there.

888
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:07,950
Rym: that's nice and cool.

889
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:12,844
Rym: But the cartridge, the actual microphone, is fundamentally different.

890
00:47:13,285 --> 00:47:19,850
Rym: if you want to wire it hard-wired to be able to take phantom power and plug it into a mixer versus if you want to plug it into a wireless system.

891
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:20,392
Rym: And guess what?

892
00:47:20,694 --> 00:47:28,070
Rym: Half the other times we want to use this is, like, at a convention, we want to use our awesome microphone instead of the shitty microphones that, like, Pax gives us.

893
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:28,828
Scott: Yeah, we have to buy two.

894
00:47:29,752 --> 00:47:31,189
Rym: So, no, we have to buy...

895
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,010
Scott: A wired one and an unwired one.

896
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:33,135
Rym: Four.

897
00:47:33,933 --> 00:47:34,566
Scott: For two people.

898
00:47:34,627 --> 00:47:34,709
Scott: Four.

899
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:37,670
Rym: Yeah, they're, like, four to six hundred bucks each.

900
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:42,490
Scott: Well, my camera was seventeen hundred, so five hundred times four is about the same amount of money.

901
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:44,510
Rym: Now, say we want to do wireless.

902
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:46,140
Scott: Plus, you're not even counting the lenses I bought.

903
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,529
Scott: I bought a thousand-dollar lens, also.

904
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,430
Rym: That is a really good lens, though.

905
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:51,286
Rym: That lens...

906
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,408
Scott: I mean, because the other lenses were not really the greatest for video, so...

907
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:55,675
Rym: Yeah, yeah, they're not.

908
00:47:55,735 --> 00:47:58,390
Rym: Like, my pancake lens, not good at video at all.

909
00:47:58,791 --> 00:47:59,188
Scott: Yeah, no.

910
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,250
Rym: Yeah, zoom lens, I can kind of wing it, but I got to manual focus that shit out of time.

911
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,082
Scott: No, that lens is so not sharp.

912
00:48:04,283 --> 00:48:05,309
Scott: That's the cheapo.

913
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,590
Rym: Yeah, but it works pretty well.

914
00:48:06,973 --> 00:48:07,647
Scott: It works, yeah.

915
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:09,943
Rym: Especially if I'm going down to, like, 720p, anyway.

916
00:48:11,331 --> 00:48:15,149
Rym: So, wireless systems, if you've never dealt with wireless, I'll just say this.

917
00:48:16,411 --> 00:48:27,970
Rym: If a band tours, either every single venue they go to, they contact and say, "Take care of all the microphones for us," or they hire an RF manager.

918
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:34,430
Rym: The RF manager tours with them and figures out what equipment and frequencies and everything to use in every venue.

919
00:48:35,051 --> 00:48:42,130
Rym: So, if Scott and I buy some, like, cheapo wireless microphone shit, it might work here, but it might not work very well in Chicago.

920
00:48:42,812 --> 00:48:43,388
Rym: Just fuck you.

921
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:46,149
Scott: Well, isn't that why you can change, you know, channels on it?

922
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:50,370
Scott: So, we go to Chicago, and we push the "Search for New Channel" button, and it's supposed to find a channel.

923
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:56,290
Rym: Yeah, so already, if you want the ones that let you search for a channel, that's, like, twice the price getting into prosumer territory.

924
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,330
Scott: All right, well, that's already mandatory, right?

925
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,108
Rym: Yeah, so that already eliminates most of these systems in the world.

926
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,129
Rym: So, if you look at Just Sure...

927
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,289
Scott: But even if we just buy those, that should be fine, right?

928
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:05,573
Scott: Eh.

929
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:07,030
Scott: We don't need an RF manager.

930
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:15,470
Rym: So, if those have a single antenna, as opposed to dual channel, then odds are, if you walk around at all, your audio will just periodically drop out for a second.

931
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:17,210
Scott: Yeah, you added that you're not hitting the one antenna.

932
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,249
Rym: Yeah, because fuck you.

933
00:49:18,692 --> 00:49:19,909
Rym: Two antennas eliminates that.

934
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:21,150
Scott: All right, so you need two antennas.

935
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:22,467
Rym: That eliminates a bunch more of these types.

936
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,189
Scott: And searching for a channel.

937
00:49:23,831 --> 00:49:25,250
Rym: So, basically, eventually...

938
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,570
Scott: But we have two people, so we actually need four antennas and two searching for channels.

939
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:33,570
Rym: So, eventually, you get into, like, if you go to Sure, the ULX S&P series.

940
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:34,570
Scott: Aren't they competitors?

941
00:49:35,511 --> 00:49:38,630
Rym: Yeah, I'm just, I know Sure, and they seem to be the ones I'm going to buy.

942
00:49:38,914 --> 00:49:39,168
Scott: Okay.

943
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:47,150
Rym: I've used, like, other types before, but I've always used them in the sense of either someone else rented them and I just configured them.

944
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,821
Rym: I never had to think in terms of...

945
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,330
Scott: Do the Cavaliers, the Canyon people, also make the wireless things?

946
00:49:52,934 --> 00:49:53,725
Rym: They actually, no.

947
00:49:54,290 --> 00:50:03,970
Rym: So, when you buy their microphone, then you tell it what kind of wireless system you're going to use with it, and then they make it custom for that system.

948
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,890
Rym: The connectors are all different.

949
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,727
Rym: It's not just XLR.

950
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,510
Scott: Why wouldn't they make an interchangeable connector?

951
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:16,890
Rym: Because the voltages are also different, because if you're pushing regular old phantom power from something with a 9-volt battery in it on your back, that's not going to work so well.

952
00:50:18,094 --> 00:50:19,830
Rym: So, they take different voltages.

953
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:24,590
Rym: So, I came down to the ULX S&P versions.

954
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,970
Rym: The differences between them are almost negligible.

955
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:30,110
Scott: Why do they even have two different versions?

956
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,530
Rym: So, the S is considered the prosumer version.

957
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:36,030
Rym: It's pretty much awesome, but it doesn't have group scan.

958
00:50:36,351 --> 00:50:37,850
Rym: ULXP has group scan.

959
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,650
Scott: So, group scan is when you have more than one.

960
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:48,290
Rym: Group scan says the unit will find a group, because every different wireless system has a set of channel groups.

961
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:51,670
Rym: So, you pick a group, and then each microphone needs a channel within that group.

962
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:59,629
Rym: So, the group scan will find the group near you that has the least interference and thus most available channels.

963
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:02,209
Scott: And then it will give one channel to one guy and one channel to the other guy?

964
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:03,049
Rym: Basically, yes.

965
00:51:03,331 --> 00:51:07,550
Rym: Without group scan, you have to just fucking guess at which group and then scan within the group.

966
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:19,948
Rym: Wouldn't have been a problem, but the difference between the two is only like $200 per unit, and everything I ever read on the internet from anyone said, "Really wish I bought the P. Wasn't that much more

967
00:51:20,029 --> 00:51:20,250
Rym: money.".

968
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:22,685
Scott: Can you imagine sitting there going like, "How many channels are there?

969
00:51:22,685 --> 00:51:23,511
Scott: 12?".

970
00:51:23,511 --> 00:51:24,342
Rym: There's like 9 to 12 groups.

971
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:30,669
Scott: You sit there with number 1, and you scan it, and then 2, and then you scan it, and you're manually pushing the buttons.

972
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,650
Scott: Wouldn't you pay money to never have to push those buttons?

973
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:34,313
Rym: Exactly.

974
00:51:34,535 --> 00:51:35,670
Rym: So, this gets more complicated.

975
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,940
Rym: There's a lot of cheap systems on eBay.

976
00:51:38,081 --> 00:51:38,523
Rym: You know what?

977
00:51:38,785 --> 00:51:39,830
Rym: That shit's all illegal.

978
00:51:40,312 --> 00:51:40,714
Scott: Wait.

979
00:51:40,835 --> 00:51:41,760
Scott: How could it be illegal?

980
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,066
Scott: If it's on eBay, it's illegal.

981
00:51:43,107 --> 00:51:46,002
Scott: Wouldn't eBay say, "Hey, you can't sell that illegal equipment.

982
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:46,787
Scott: We're taking down your

983
00:51:46,807 --> 00:51:47,129
Scott: listing.".

984
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,330
Rym: Because people don't even know.

985
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,947
Scott: If I try to sell a gun on eBay, eBay's like, "Fuck

986
00:51:50,988 --> 00:51:51,149
Scott: no.".

987
00:51:51,371 --> 00:51:52,329
Rym: A lot of people still don't know.

988
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:59,047
Rym: So, in 2010, it finally became illegal to use wireless microphones on the 700 MHz band.

989
00:52:01,081 --> 00:52:01,268
Rym: Oh, okay.

990
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:11,710
Rym: Because that band, after the whole digital TV conversion and a whole bunch of stuff that happened, is used primarily by reserved special services, police, fire, EMT.

991
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:12,933
Scott: Wait.

992
00:52:13,315 --> 00:52:13,836
Scott: I don't get that.

993
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:17,870
Scott: Emergency services had frequencies they've been using forever.

994
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:19,870
Rym: That were overcrowded and not that effective.

995
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:25,170
Rym: The whole idea is that they rejiggered a lot of the frequencies to make better frequencies available.

996
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:29,499
Scott: So, if they rejiggered over to 700 MHz, they must have left some... What were they used to be using?

997
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,470
Scott: We can use that now, right?

998
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:30,793
Rym: Yeah.

999
00:52:30,834 --> 00:52:32,230
Rym: So, that's also reserved for other things.

1000
00:52:32,451 --> 00:52:34,670
Rym: And every wireless system works in different ranges.

1001
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:44,576
Rym: And if you want to use a particular wireless system, the advice everyone gives you comes down to, "Well, where are you installing this?

1002
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:48,008
Rym: What TV stations are active near

1003
00:52:48,068 --> 00:52:48,228
Rym: you?".

1004
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:51,409
Rym: So, shit got complicated way quick.

1005
00:52:52,472 --> 00:52:55,030
Rym: And one blog listed cities in terms of difficulty.

1006
00:52:55,571 --> 00:52:56,204
Rym: Like, how pro...

1007
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:57,630
Scott: Well, New York is going to be most difficult.

1008
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:59,649
Rym: Yeah, the list was like, how pro...

1009
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:00,630
Scott: New York is god mode.

1010
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:05,490
Rym: How pro does your RF manager need to be to handle a concert in this city?

1011
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:09,129
Rym: And at the top, by itself, New York.

1012
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:15,110
Scott: Right, but wouldn't you be in... Most of the good concert venues are in a shielded stage place, right?

1013
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,010
Scott: Where you're not going to interfere with anything outside the building.

1014
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,820
Rym: Yeah, you'll interfere with your own shit internally.

1015
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:22,790
Scott: Right, but if you're doing an outdoor concert, fuck you.

1016
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:23,290
Scott: Yup.

1017
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:28,170
Rym: So, doing all this research and all this research, I finally got to the end.

1018
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,810
Rym: I figured out everything to buy, kind of like how Scott did all this research.

1019
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:32,161
Rym: Like, this is the camera.

1020
00:53:32,403 --> 00:53:33,130
Rym: It's worth the money.

1021
00:53:33,532 --> 00:53:35,110
Rym: So, I decided to get a ULXP system.

1022
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:36,388
Rym: I go to buy one.

1023
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:41,210
Rym: And then, oh, ULXP's can be bought in one of three bands.

1024
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:43,369
Scott: Which one is the New York one?

1025
00:53:48,371 --> 00:53:50,370
Rym: So, each band has its own set of frequencies.

1026
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:54,450
Rym: They're all hardware, so if you buy one, you want to use a different band?

1027
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:55,067
Scott: Fuck you.

1028
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,088
Scott: You've got to buy three of each.

1029
00:53:56,431 --> 00:53:58,481
Rym: Also, say we buy the G3 band, I think is one of them.

1030
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:05,230
Rym: And all the other systems use different bands and different band names, different band sets.

1031
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:11,410
Rym: So, if you want to use that system at SayPax, depending on what band...

1032
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:17,410
Scott: So, we're going to take our equipment to Seattle and then to Boston, but we might need a different one in a different place than New York.

1033
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:18,898
Rym: And it doesn't just depend on the city.

1034
00:54:19,562 --> 00:54:21,010
Rym: SayPax already has a bunch of equipment.

1035
00:54:21,531 --> 00:54:22,560
Rym: What bands are they using?

1036
00:54:23,064 --> 00:54:23,750
Rym: What channels are three?

1037
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:24,809
Scott: Can't we just hook up to their equipment?

1038
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:26,349
Rym: Maybe, if they'll let us.

1039
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:26,853
Scott: Oh, but wait.

1040
00:54:26,954 --> 00:54:28,990
Scott: But our lavaliers are for our equipment.

1041
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:35,790
Rym: Now, we could plug our lavaliers because the one part of the reason why I want to go with Shure is because every con we've ever been to has used Shure wireless.

1042
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,450
Rym: And I know the connector, I know how that shit works.

1043
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:41,310
Rym: Even the anime club at RIT, that's what we used when we had microphones.

1044
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:48,430
Rym: So, we could plug our countrymen into their battery packs and just use our awesome microphone there without having to bring the other equipment.

1045
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:49,349
Rym: Which is fine.

1046
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,009
Scott: Oh, Zenkai Con, they had Sennheiser.

1047
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,389
Rym: Yeah, Zenkai Con.

1048
00:54:53,372 --> 00:54:55,030
Rym: PAX and everyone else had Shure.

1049
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:59,170
Rym: In fact, I took pictures of all the equipment at all the PAXes to do the research later.

1050
00:55:01,072 --> 00:55:03,149
Rym: So, yeah, that got real complicated real quick.

1051
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:10,610
Rym: And the moral of all this, I guess, is unless you need pro equipment, don't fucking buy pro equipment.

1052
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:12,493
Scott: Man, it's so weird.

1053
00:55:12,533 --> 00:55:21,050
Scott: It's like, is it that thing with the Bloomberg terminal where it's hard just to make pros feel like they know something?

1054
00:55:21,453 --> 00:55:23,549
Scott: Or is it just, it's hard because it's pro?

1055
00:55:24,092 --> 00:55:26,390
Rym: Oh, and by the way, are you licensed or not?

1056
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:32,916
Rym: Because if you buy some wireless microphone systems and you set them up in certain ways, oh, you're breaking the law.

1057
00:55:33,017 --> 00:55:34,950
Rym: You're fucked if the FCC comes knocking.

1058
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:37,789
Scott: But couldn't you just get the license for the FCC?

1059
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:45,889
Rym: FCC license for microphone broadcast locally at higher amplitudes or different reserve frequency ranges costs a lot of money.

1060
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:48,070
Scott: But a ham radio license doesn't cost much.

1061
00:55:48,231 --> 00:55:49,750
Rym: Ham radio is a totally different thing.

1062
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:53,184
Scott: Come on, all the licenses should be the same.

1063
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,010
Scott: Why is this one so expensive?

1064
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:58,370
Rym: It's not that it's so expensive, it's that it's expensive for us not making money.

1065
00:55:59,711 --> 00:56:03,190
Rym: Also, you have to have a legit reason and be something.

1066
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,170
Rym: Podcast doesn't count.

1067
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,609
Scott: Why don't we just go to a different country that doesn't have an FCC?

1068
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:11,249
Rym: Yeah, other countries, it's way complicated.

1069
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,245
Rym: Basically, all this equipment I'm looking at, US only.

1070
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:16,310
Rym: Do not bring it to the EU, they'll confiscate it.

1071
00:56:16,933 --> 00:56:24,167
Scott: Why don't we just go to the northern, well, no, not the northern part, near the tropics on an island where there's no one interfering with anything.

1072
00:56:24,187 --> 00:56:24,690
Rym: and who gives a fuck?

1073
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,604
Rym: And then in the middle of our Twitch broadcast, you hear the pirate radio.

1074
00:56:27,624 --> 00:56:28,288
Rym: just start chiming in.

1075
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:29,229
Rym: Awesome.

1076
00:56:29,731 --> 00:56:30,770
Rym: Actually, that was pretty awesome.

1077
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:33,669
Scott: Dude, if I lived in a boat in the tropics, I would listen to the pirate radio.

1078
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,070
Rym: I'd be looking forward to it.

1079
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:35,328
Rym: Yup.

1080
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:40,087
Scott: And then I'd see the guy in his boat with his big antennae sticking on and he'd say, "Hey, good morning, what's

1081
00:56:40,248 --> 00:56:40,328
Scott: up?".

1082
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:43,478
Rym: But let's say you aren't, you know, doing pro, like.

1083
00:56:43,499 --> 00:56:47,210
Rym: you're not trying to do live, like for real video streams to Twitch.

1084
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:51,130
Rym: You're not trying to like record for real lectures at conventions on a regular basis.

1085
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:52,209
Scott: Don't buy wireless.

1086
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:57,720
Rym: There's cheaper consumer level systems that'll work pretty fucking well.

1087
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:02,050
Rym: if you're okay with occasionally there's some static or occasionally it fails.

1088
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,110
Scott: Can't we just get that and then remove the static in post?

1089
00:57:05,612 --> 00:57:08,430
Rym: Well, the static removes what you were saying.

1090
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,910
Scott: Well, obviously we just re-record that part with ADR.

1091
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:13,769
Rym: Yeah, because we're totally going to do that.

1092
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:14,810
Scott: Why not?

1093
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:16,710
Scott: You'd save a fuck ton of money, right?

1094
00:57:17,391 --> 00:57:18,096
Rym: Eh, would we?

1095
00:57:18,177 --> 00:57:20,110
Rym: Because then we're spending time instead.

1096
00:57:20,412 --> 00:57:21,009
Scott: How much time?

1097
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:21,726
Rym: I don't know.

1098
00:57:23,251 --> 00:57:28,310
Rym: Also, the more pro equipment we have, the more likely it is a major convention would let us use it with their stuff.

1099
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:28,625
Scott: Maybe.

1100
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:41,970
Rym: But basically, unless you're doing something for serious and you're actually willing to do the requisite research and be an expert in that field, you should never buy professional equipment.

1101
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:48,410
Rym: Because either you're going to waste money or you're going to get in trouble or break something or somehow cause a problem for someone.

1102
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:49,111
Scott: Yeah.

1103
00:57:49,372 --> 00:57:52,149
Scott: I mean, it sounds similar to like, so the camera, right?

1104
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:57,026
Scott: The one problem I had with the previous camera is that when you record it, well, first of all, it wasn't even 1080p, it was 1080i.

1105
00:57:58,311 --> 00:58:02,545
Scott: But you'd record video, but if the battery ran out, video ends.

1106
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:04,070
Scott: Well, that's no good, right?

1107
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:08,585
Scott: I'm in a weird situation where, like, you don't really need, like, the battery lasts for hours, right?

1108
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:10,070
Scott: It's not really a problem most of the time.

1109
00:58:10,631 --> 00:58:16,810
Scott: But I was recording Netrunner videos and each round is an hour, or at least unless you play fast, right?

1110
00:58:17,031 --> 00:58:22,790
Scott: And, you know, you're using a battery, maybe round one the batteries- Well, you don't have a bandolier of batteries.

1111
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:27,070
Scott: Even if you have a bandolier of batteries, I can't stop in the middle of a game to change the battery.

1112
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:30,370
Rym: No, you have the bandolier that self-powers through that special weird-ass cable.

1113
00:58:31,191 --> 00:58:31,532
Scott: Oh, no.

1114
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:36,005
Scott: There's no way to apply power to that old camera, right?

1115
00:58:36,366 --> 00:58:37,650
Scott: Except through the battery holes.

1116
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:41,223
Scott: It doesn't have, like, an AC or DC input hole on it, right?

1117
00:58:41,664 --> 00:58:43,210
Scott: Like a camcorder does or anything.

1118
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:47,570
Scott: And, you know, you recharge the batteries by taking them out of the camera and putting them in a charger.

1119
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:55,990
Scott: So, basically, even if you only use, like, three quarters of a battery, that extra quarter is basically now useless to you because you can't record a full game on it.

1120
00:58:56,070 --> 00:59:00,362
Scott: If you try to use that power to record a game, the camera will run out mid-game.

1121
00:59:00,382 --> 00:59:02,950
Scott: You'll have to stop, change the battery, and start again.

1122
00:59:03,712 --> 00:59:05,550
Scott: Even if your memory card is gigantic, no good.

1123
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:09,130
Rym: My camcorder has a special battery that's basically just an interface to the battery ports.

1124
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,130
Rym: And then that has a cable that goes down to a bandolier of batteries.

1125
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:19,050
Scott: So, the newer camera, right, you can buy this thing, which is exactly that.

1126
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:20,236
Scott: It's a fake battery.

1127
00:59:20,377 --> 00:59:22,469
Scott: It's in the shape of a battery with a wire coming out.

1128
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:28,570
Scott: And the camera even has a little flappy bit so that the wire can escape the battery hole and stick out of the camera.

1129
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,530
Scott: Separately, they sell an AC adapter that plugs into that.

1130
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:35,770
Scott: They don't provide them in a package, even though one is useless without the other.

1131
00:59:36,433 --> 00:59:38,730
Scott: I don't know why, but they don't.

1132
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:45,427
Scott: So, in the instruction manual, it says, "Don't use any AC adapter except this AC10

1133
00:59:45,467 --> 00:59:45,508
Scott: PP."

1134
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:51,590
Scott: And don't use any battery, you know, plug thingy except the DC whatever number, right?

1135
00:59:52,095 --> 00:59:53,490
Scott: So, I tried to get those model numbers.

1136
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:58,390
Rym: Yeah, once you go pro, very specific model numbers of things mean a lot to you.

1137
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:05,870
Scott: So, I go and I finally B&H'd and miraculously they had the fake battery bit, but they didn't have an AC adapter.

1138
01:00:06,751 --> 01:00:10,147
Scott: How do they order a not equal number of both products?

1139
01:00:10,227 --> 01:00:10,770
Scott: I do not know.

1140
01:00:11,591 --> 01:00:13,930
Scott: So, I go searching on the internet for the AC adapter.

1141
01:00:15,071 --> 01:00:17,450
Scott: No one has it, except like some Japanese places.

1142
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:20,248
Scott: And it's like, "Wow, are they just not selling this

1143
01:00:20,268 --> 01:00:20,429
Scott: here?".

1144
01:00:20,671 --> 01:00:20,935
Rym: Yeah.

1145
01:00:21,665 --> 01:00:21,989
Scott: Well, here.

1146
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:27,509
Scott: But then I noticed the GH3 had the exact same batteries as the GH4.

1147
01:00:28,611 --> 01:00:35,109
Scott: It had the exact same DC coupling bit, but it had a different AC adapter, the AC8, not the AC10.

1148
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:40,688
Scott: And I'm like, "Huh, why wouldn't the AC8 work in the same as the AC10

1149
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:41,170
Scott: does?".

1150
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:50,403
Scott: I mean, clearly they've changed the product, but this takes the same batteries as that camera and the same DC coupler and the same everything.

1151
01:00:50,463 --> 01:00:52,210
Scott: Why wouldn't it use the same, right?

1152
01:00:52,771 --> 01:00:55,309
Scott: So, I decided to take a risk for the internets.

1153
01:00:56,010 --> 01:01:01,290
Scott: I went and I bought the Wasabi batteries meant for the GH3, the third-party batteries, and I stuck them in there.

1154
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,296
Scott: Camera could have exploded.

1155
01:01:02,941 --> 01:01:03,526
Scott: Didn't explode.

1156
01:01:03,546 --> 01:01:04,030
Scott: They worked great.

1157
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:08,650
Scott: And that made me think, "Aha, it is exactly the same as the GH3, isn't

1158
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:08,710
Scott: it?".

1159
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:09,648
Scott: And they're trying to bullshit me.

1160
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:13,568
Scott: So, then I found another camera store in the city and they had the AC8.

1161
01:01:14,354 --> 01:01:15,262
Scott: They had one left.

1162
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:16,009
Scott: And I got it.

1163
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:21,910
Scott: And I was in the store and I'm like, "Let me plug this into my camera before I buy it from you.

1164
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,059
Scott: If my camera explodes, that's on me.

1165
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:25,466
Scott: I'll just get the warranty or whatever.

1166
01:01:25,647 --> 01:01:26,310
Scott: I'll find a way.

1167
01:01:26,993 --> 01:01:28,207
Scott: If it doesn't explode, I'm buying

1168
01:01:28,247 --> 01:01:28,368
Scott: this.".

1169
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:30,685
Scott: And of course, it didn't explode.

1170
01:01:30,705 --> 01:01:31,390
Scott: It totally worked.

1171
01:01:31,796 --> 01:01:32,070
Rym: Alright.

1172
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,583
Scott: So, I can now plug the camera into the wall.

1173
01:01:34,623 --> 01:01:35,690
Scott: Something you would think is so simple.

1174
01:01:36,371 --> 01:01:40,890
Scott: Plug your camera into the wall so you can take video until the memory card is full without stopping indoors.

1175
01:01:41,212 --> 01:01:42,179
Scott: You think that would be basic.

1176
01:01:42,219 --> 01:01:43,689
Scott: Like, the camera would just fucking come with that.

1177
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:44,591
Scott: But no.

1178
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:46,519
Scott: Pro shit just doesn't come with that.

1179
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:48,627
Scott: The same as the stupid wireless mics.

1180
01:01:48,687 --> 01:01:49,350
Scott: It just doesn't.

1181
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:49,923
Scott: You have to...

1182
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:50,331
Rym: Yup.

1183
01:01:50,371 --> 01:01:50,854
Rym: Well, here.

1184
01:01:50,895 --> 01:01:53,310
Rym: Let's configure an E6 Countryman right now.

1185
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:54,278
Scott: Something so simple.

1186
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,510
Scott: Just plugging it into the wall.

1187
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:55,771
Rym: Alright.

1188
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:57,680
Rym: So, what are we plugging our fucking microphone into?

1189
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,690
Rym: There's a dropdown with like a hundred options.

1190
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:00,175
Scott: Whoa.

1191
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:01,193
Rym: Let's say,

1192
01:02:01,374 --> 01:02:01,715
Rym: "Sure.".

1193
01:02:01,775 --> 01:02:04,830
Rym: And all the other options you get change depending on what you pick here.

1194
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:05,990
Scott: It's like filling out your taxes.

1195
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:06,513
Rym: I'm gonna say,

1196
01:02:06,613 --> 01:02:06,975
Rym: "Sure.".

1197
01:02:06,995 --> 01:02:08,503
Rym: Oh, now I gotta pick a model.

1198
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:09,830
Rym: Let's go with the ULXP.

1199
01:02:10,714 --> 01:02:11,058
Rym: Alright.

1200
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:11,990
Rym: Flexibility.

1201
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:13,270
Scott: That's the one with the group scan, right?

1202
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:13,591
Rym: Yes.

1203
01:02:13,872 --> 01:02:14,435
Rym: Flexibility.

1204
01:02:14,455 --> 01:02:15,500
Rym: There are three codes here.

1205
01:02:15,701 --> 01:02:17,590
Rym: No code for a classy springy boom.

1206
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:19,716
Rym: I for a very flexible boom.

1207
01:02:20,118 --> 01:02:23,050
Rym: Or X for a flexible boom and a springy ear section.

1208
01:02:23,691 --> 01:02:26,970
Rym: And then paragraphs of description of what each one of these is.

1209
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,857
Scott: So why would you even need one or the other, right?

1210
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:31,970
Scott: This is the boom that goes from the ear to your face, right?

1211
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:36,490
Scott: You would want one that is where you can bend it and it stays in the shape that you bend it to.

1212
01:02:36,832 --> 01:02:36,933
Rym: Ah.

1213
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:38,061
Rym: So here's the explanation.

1214
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:39,250
Rym: Just to give you an example.

1215
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:43,850
Rym: The classic E6 is a good choice when one person alone will wear the microphone.

1216
01:02:44,451 --> 01:02:45,240
Rym: It holds its shape.

1217
01:02:45,301 --> 01:02:45,989
Rym: Just put it on and go.

1218
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:54,890
Rym: The eye is highly flexible with the larger silicone rubber piece to use when multiple people share the mic and you have to reconfigure it on the fly for different people.

1219
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:58,050
Scott: Oh, so the first one you reshape it and it stays in that shape forever?

1220
01:02:58,352 --> 01:02:58,730
Rym: Basically.

1221
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:01,170
Scott: The other one you can keep reshaping a bunch.

1222
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:04,029
Rym: And then the flex is a compromise between those two.

1223
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:07,290
Rym: For like theater, you might have to fuck with it occasionally.

1224
01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:12,830
Scott: Sure, the first one you can shape it once and leave it that shape forever.

1225
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:14,010
Scott: You can reshape it.

1226
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:16,188
Scott: But why not just get the reshaping one always?

1227
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:20,870
Rym: Because the reshaping one will possibly lose its shape over the course of doing something.

1228
01:03:21,392 --> 01:03:23,569
Rym: And you have to refit it to your head every time you put it on.

1229
01:03:24,191 --> 01:03:25,630
Scott: Oh, it sort of loses its shape.

1230
01:03:25,911 --> 01:03:27,350
Rym: The classic, like you do a thing and then it's set.

1231
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:29,490
Scott: The other one is really firm and stays that way forever.

1232
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:30,315
Rym: Exactly.

1233
01:03:30,335 --> 01:03:32,389
Rym: It stays that way for as long as you need it to.

1234
01:03:33,192 --> 01:03:34,819
Scott: But it can be reshaped.

1235
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,568
Scott: But if you reshape it too much, it's going to break?

1236
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:37,581
Scott: I don't know.

1237
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,902
Scott: Yeah, why not get just that one always?

1238
01:03:39,922 --> 01:03:41,010
Scott: Or the compromise one?

1239
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:46,130
Rym: So what if you own it for a venue where you have a different person speaking every night?

1240
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:54,770
Scott: If that firm one can be reshaped a bunch without breaking and it holds its shape once I shape it, why not use that one?

1241
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:55,978
Rym: It's not easy to shape.

1242
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,810
Rym: I watch videos on how to shape it.

1243
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:58,317
Scott: It's not just like you.

1244
01:03:58,337 --> 01:03:59,269
Scott: don't just bend it and that's it?

1245
01:03:59,611 --> 01:03:59,692
Rym: No.

1246
01:03:59,732 --> 01:04:03,490
Rym: You like flex and pull and the idea is that you make it perfect for one person.

1247
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,429
Rym: Leave it that way forever.

1248
01:04:04,775 --> 01:04:04,990
Rym: Alright.

1249
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:05,963
Rym: That's what it's aimed for.

1250
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,001
Scott: Because that matters that much, right?

1251
01:04:08,042 --> 01:04:09,250
Scott: If it's a little bit out of place.

1252
01:04:09,874 --> 01:04:11,290
Rym: At these volumes, it kind of does.

1253
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:12,596
Rym: So pattern.

1254
01:04:12,717 --> 01:04:13,990
Rym: Omnidirectional or directional?

1255
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:17,650
Scott: Well, it's always being worn on someone's head pointing at their mouth.

1256
01:04:17,731 --> 01:04:20,490
Scott: So why wouldn't you always want it to point straight at the mouth and that's it?

1257
01:04:21,151 --> 01:04:23,550
Rym: Well, usually actually you want omnidirectional for these things.

1258
01:04:23,933 --> 01:04:24,259
Scott: Okay.

1259
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:24,829
Scott: Why is that?

1260
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:26,901
Rym: Because it's usually not pointed at your mouth.

1261
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:28,169
Rym: It's just near your mouth.

1262
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:31,570
Rym: And omnidirectionals don't fuck with the sound.

1263
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:34,410
Rym: Directional microphones actually do fuck with your sound a little bit.

1264
01:04:35,093 --> 01:04:38,330
Rym: And they also, if they get a little out of place, now you're fucked.

1265
01:04:39,691 --> 01:04:41,910
Scott: Why would you then ever want the directional one?

1266
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:45,930
Rym: So you and me on a stage, we probably want omnis because it's just us talking.

1267
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:50,830
Rym: What if we're on a stage singing with Britney Spears and there's tons of noise on stage?

1268
01:04:51,255 --> 01:04:52,190
Rym: Then we need a directional.

1269
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:56,510
Scott: Oh, so that the guitars jamming and such don't go into the microphones?

1270
01:04:58,410 --> 01:04:58,810
Scott: Alright.

1271
01:04:59,471 --> 01:05:01,266
Rym: And then there's all these different types of directionality.

1272
01:05:01,286 --> 01:05:01,770
Rym: We'll skip all that.

1273
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:02,410
Rym: We'll go with the omni.

1274
01:05:02,992 --> 01:05:04,377
Rym: So, sensitivity.

1275
01:05:04,457 --> 01:05:07,890
Rym: Three of the options are grayed out because of the options we chose earlier.

1276
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:09,981
Rym: We can choose the W5, W6, or W7.

1277
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:19,210
Rym: Standard gain for general speaking, moderate gain for speaking and vocals, or powerful vocals.

1278
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:21,440
Scott: Oh, so it's basically how much...

1279
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:25,270
Rym: How sensitive is this thing before it just blows out?

1280
01:05:25,613 --> 01:05:25,720
Rym: Yeah.

1281
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:28,648
Rym: So, it appears that we need the W6.

1282
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,529
Scott: We would get the more sensitive one.

1283
01:05:31,216 --> 01:05:32,549
Rym: Not the most sensitive one, though.

1284
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:34,450
Scott: What's the most sensitive one?

1285
01:05:34,635 --> 01:05:34,830
Scott: Standard.

1286
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:35,990
Scott: That's the one where you whisper?

1287
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,350
Rym: No, standard gain for general speaking.

1288
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:45,128
Rym: The advice, and again, there's tons of advice here, it basically says standard spoken word, W5.

1289
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:50,628
Rym: Musical theater or, and I'm stressing this, dynamic presenters, W6.

1290
01:05:52,091 --> 01:05:54,588
Rym: Considering I'm yelling into this microphone right now, I think we need W6s.

1291
01:05:55,831 --> 01:05:56,502
Rym: It warns you, W7.

1292
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,990
Scott: But if we're too quiet, if we just sit and have a chat, maybe we won't get heard.

1293
01:06:00,231 --> 01:06:02,769
Rym: Well, it means we have to pump the gain up, it'll be a little noisier then.

1294
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:10,690
Rym: But that's probably better than blowing it out by being too loud for the thing when we start yelling in the middle of a panel.

1295
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:11,250
Rym: That's true.

1296
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:15,190
Rym: W7, basically, it's like only fucking use this if this is opera.

1297
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:16,841
Scott: If you're yelling, then you'll maybe get to move.

1298
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:22,990
Rym: Not even yelling, it says opera singer or other extremely loud applications only.

1299
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:27,450
Scott: In other words, if we put those on and we start doing a podcast, we won't even move the needle.

1300
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:27,940
Rym: Yup.

1301
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:29,675
Rym: Alright, color.

1302
01:06:29,776 --> 01:06:32,170
Rym: Light beige, tan, cocoa, or black.

1303
01:06:32,591 --> 01:06:34,510
Scott: I guess that's because you care about hiding it, right?

1304
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:36,129
Scott: But we don't really care about hiding it so much.

1305
01:06:37,473 --> 01:06:39,909
Scott: The fact that it's so small, it's already hidden enough for us.

1306
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:46,390
Scott: We're not honest, in theater, trying to really hide it when we're doing something really classical.

1307
01:06:46,531 --> 01:06:46,699
Rym: Exactly.

1308
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:50,730
Scott: So we would just get, I guess, the white person color.

1309
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:53,710
Rym: Yeah, well it's interesting because they give you a lot of notes.

1310
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:57,790
Scott: And it's like, you're going to see, even if I get white person color, it's like facial hairs and stuff.

1311
01:06:57,790 --> 01:07:02,090
Rym: Well, they warn you, for example, for placement against skin, when in doubt, choose the darker option.

1312
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:05,950
Rym: Lighter colors on camera look like scars from a distance.

1313
01:07:06,331 --> 01:07:08,670
Scott: Right, plus my beardedness and whatnot, right?

1314
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:12,490
Rym: Or we just go black and then it's obvious it's there, but it's kind of techno future.

1315
01:07:13,257 --> 01:07:13,928
Scott: I like black too.

1316
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:15,950
Rym: Alright, cable diameter, one millimeter.

1317
01:07:17,011 --> 01:07:21,349
Scott: And the solid black is not racially insensitive if anyone has to use it.

1318
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:22,968
Rym: Albinos.

1319
01:07:23,892 --> 01:07:24,589
Scott: Sorry, albinos.

1320
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:25,470
Rym: Racist.

1321
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:26,710
Rym: There is a white option.

1322
01:07:28,233 --> 01:07:29,110
Rym: Stark pearl white.

1323
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:30,029
Scott: Way to go, Canyon.

1324
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:32,250
Scott: That's actually, no, that looks like a scar.

1325
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:33,349
Scott: Anyway, keep going.

1326
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:34,309
Rym: Unless you're an albino.

1327
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:35,588
Scott: Go albinos, go.

1328
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:37,969
Rym: Also, that one can be colored with felt tip pens.

1329
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:41,550
Scott: Dude, somewhere there's the awesomest albino nerdy person ever.

1330
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:42,067
Rym: There has to be.

1331
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:44,650
Rym: Dude, if any albinos listen to GeekNights, totally talk to us.

1332
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:47,930
Scott: And they're doing all the cosplays that no one else can do and everyone is mad jelly.

1333
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:50,610
Rym: Name a character they can do other than Ray Iannami.

1334
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:53,970
Scott: Someone who's like really, really white.

1335
01:07:56,013 --> 01:07:57,829
Scott: Dylan Dow from Escaflownia is really white.

1336
01:07:58,150 --> 01:07:58,687
Rym: That kind of works.

1337
01:07:59,330 --> 01:07:59,525
Rym: Let's see.

1338
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:00,590
Rym: Alright, one more option.

1339
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:01,288
Scott: Various ghosts.

1340
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,710
Rym: Do we want the one millimeter.

1341
01:08:03,471 --> 01:08:04,809
Scott: Vampires of various sorts.

1342
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:09,510
Rym: The one millimeter Eremid reinforced cable or the two millimeter Duramax.

1343
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:11,070
Scott: We're not the Duramax cable.

1344
01:08:12,216 --> 01:08:13,410
Scott: We're not trying to hide the cable.

1345
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:14,570
Scott: We are buying an expensive.

1346
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:18,450
Rym: The Duramax cable provides 50 additional pounds of tensile strength.

1347
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:21,390
Scott: Right, we are buying an expensive thing we do not want to break.

1348
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:23,288
Scott: We are not buying a thing we are trying to hide.

1349
01:08:25,171 --> 01:08:26,979
Rym: Our sku is an E60W62SL.

1350
01:08:29,831 --> 01:08:30,569
Scott: How much is it?

1351
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:32,755
Scott: So $1,000 for two.

1352
01:08:33,974 --> 01:08:34,130
Rym: Yes.

1353
01:08:34,812 --> 01:08:36,450
Rym: And that won't work with the Marantz.

1354
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:37,826
Rym: Fuck.

1355
01:08:41,894 --> 01:08:43,429
Rym: So guys, don't go pro.

1356
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:47,109
Scott: Couldn't we get something that it can work with that goes in between it and the Marantz?

1357
01:08:48,515 --> 01:08:49,410
Rym: A wireless system.

1358
01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:50,870
Scott: Right, the wireless outputs into the Marantz.

1359
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,069
Rym: Yes, that's what we would do.

1360
01:08:52,393 --> 01:08:53,868
Rym: We would always use the wireless system.

1361
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:58,109
Rym: Assuming that we broadcast on a legal channel, the laws don't change.

1362
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:02,370
Scott: But couldn't we connect it to those little wireless backpack thingies, the gauntlet belt clip?

1363
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,990
Scott: And then couldn't we have a wire coming out of that?

1364
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,430
Rym: Those things usually don't have a local output wire.

1365
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:08,689
Scott: Couldn't we find one that does?

1366
01:09:09,254 --> 01:09:10,630
Rym: I don't know of one, to be honest.

1367
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:11,849
Scott: Couldn't we make one?

1368
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:18,029
Rym: Now there are devices I've found that I have not vetted that will give the proper voltage to this thing and convert to XLR.

1369
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:20,410
Rym: But I've got to do a little bit of research on those.

1370
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:23,790
Scott: You don't want to explode your $500 thing, even though I almost exploded my $700 camera.

1371
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:24,906
Rym: No, because here's the other thing.

1372
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:32,930
Rym: With professional equipment, if you go back to the store and you're like, "Yeah, it just stopped working," they can figure out exactly what you did to it.

1373
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:34,069
Scott: That's exactly right.

1374
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,670
Rym: That is not the case with consumer and prosumer stuff.

1375
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,024
Rym: No.

1376
01:09:37,531 --> 01:09:38,166
Rym: Except cell phones.

1377
01:09:39,294 --> 01:09:40,609
Rym: They know if you dropped it in the toilet.

1378
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:41,188
Scott: Yep.

1379
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:48,410
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1380
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:53,550
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1381
01:09:53,911 --> 01:09:58,950
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1382
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:01,870
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1383
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:06,630
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1385
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:14,450
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1386
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,570
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
