00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,265
Rym: It's Thursday, November 1st.

00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:12,007
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:14,935
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:15,998
Rym: We talk about books.

5
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:16,760
Rym: You should read.

6
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:25,387
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:31,850
Rym: So, uh, I was in a car accident today.

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,612
Scott: Were you really?

9
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:33,435
Scott: but wait you weren't.

10
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:38,514
Rym: well, yes Yes, I saved this cuz I want to get you drive somewhere today.

11
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:38,956
Scott: Yes.

12
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:40,040
Scott: Where did you drive?

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,820
Rym: I drove the cold spring for what to go climbing.

14
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:48,260
Rym: Okay, and then since I was there I drove further south cuz from breakneck Ridge.

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,680
Rym: We'd always see this pile of what looked like a burned-down building like on this point and I always wondered what it was.

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:01,760
Rym: So finally I drove over there and found it and it was just a little tiny hill that The rocks just look like a burned-down building from a distance.

17
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:06,460
Scott: Well, but wait, but wait you your car is in the driveway and it looks undamaged.

18
00:01:06,564 --> 00:01:18,940
Rym: Oh, yes it but so I'm in the parking lot outside of the nice like market down in cold spring and I'm sitting there parked like I pull out of a parking spot and I shift, you know from reverse into drive.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,282
Rym: I'm about to go and then bump this SUV is backed into me pretty hard Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:27,850
Rym: So I just stop and I just sit there like.

21
00:01:28,492 --> 00:01:29,736
Rym: ah, I got the phone out.

22
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:31,120
Rym: I'm about to call the police.

23
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:33,288
Rym: I'm all set to you know, take a picture.

24
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,513
Rym: call my insurance.

25
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,320
Rym: get ready to sue this person for damages.

26
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:39,825
Scott: I don't pay my deduct anybody to deal with indignity Possibilities like.

27
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:43,400
Rym: I'm fully prepared cuz I'm ready to deal with people like that.

28
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,434
Rym: I was already about to dial the police because I wasn't gonna let this person get away.

29
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:49,180
Rym: They were gonna pay for all the damages.

30
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:56,520
Rym: So I get out and I'm holding my cell phone and I look and the cars in there and the woman gets out.

31
00:01:57,022 --> 00:02:00,015
Rym: She's nice and young and she has like a kid in the car and she could.

32
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:03,469
Rym: first of all she comes out Crazily apologetic like oh my god.

33
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:04,412
Rym: I'm so sorry.

34
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:05,556
Rym: I can't believe I did that.

35
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:08,948
Rym: That was totally my fault Mm-hmm, so that diffused me a little bit.

36
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:11,236
Rym: I turned off my whoops.

37
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:14,294
Scott: Amass my let's see I would be rolling my eyes at this point.

38
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:14,898
Rym: Well, I was like.

39
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:16,844
Rym: so then she.

40
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:24,660
Rym: now then I look at where she has struck me and There's a big dent and she says oh my god.

41
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:31,435
Rym: And meanwhile, I'm looking and I started laughing hysterically.

42
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:32,679
Scott: that dent was there before.

43
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:42,420
Rym: well I had a dent cuz I worked in the Bronx and there's a dent where someone just reared like bumped into my car while it Was parked and I wasn't gonna pay my deductible to get that fixed.

44
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:46,019
Scott: Yeah, yeah deductible and there was no insurance companies raking it on.

45
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,727
Rym: Well, there was no.

46
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:50,872
Rym: I could have zero deductible But there was no one to sue cuz I had no like.

47
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:51,636
Rym: I didn't know who did it.

48
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:52,499
Rym: like some for all.

49
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:52,700
Rym: I know.

50
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,600
Rym: Is some illegal guy just bumped into it with like his unregistered car?

51
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:56,525
Rym: Who knows for all.

52
00:02:56,565 --> 00:03:01,551
Scott: I know like some guy came down the street with a hammer went wham There's a recon with an aluminum bat who knows?

53
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:02,917
Rym: or a scout as it were.

54
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:12,132
Rym: yep, so Her car like the bag bumper is sitting Inside of that pre-existing dent like perfectly.

55
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:13,536
Rym: it could not have been more.

56
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:14,880
Scott: Are you sure it's resisting?

57
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,846
Scott: Yes, all right Scott.

58
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:17,669
Rym: You've seen that dent.

59
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:18,834
Rym: It's been there for like a year.

60
00:03:18,854 --> 00:03:20,440
Scott: I don't really inspect your car so much.

61
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:22,046
Rym: It's right there.

62
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:24,334
Rym: There's a big dent in the driver's side.

63
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:25,338
Scott: Oh, I've seen that dent.

64
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:25,940
Rym: That's the dent.

65
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:27,793
Scott: You said you were backing out and you got bumped.

66
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:28,720
Scott: so I thought it was the bag.

67
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:31,313
Rym: I was all the way backed out and then she backed into my side.

68
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:37,200
Rym: Okay, so It's it's like sitting in the dent and I look and the dent is not deeper or anything.

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,145
Rym: It's the exact same thing.

70
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:39,231
Rym: now for a second.

71
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:46,000
Rym: I think you know All I'd have to do is call the police anyway, and this woman would pay for all the repairs.

72
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:47,908
Scott: Yeah free debt, but you don't care about your car.

73
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,888
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time I wouldn't mind my car to look nicer And I'd be effort though.

74
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:52,511
Scott: If not money.

75
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:54,100
Rym: No, you know how little effort it would be.

76
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,152
Rym: It was clearly her fault and in front of a witness.

77
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:57,540
Rym: She had said it was her fault.

78
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,837
Rym: So I was like there would be no trial would have been summary judgment and I would have gotten my deductible like without any effort at all.

79
00:04:04,842 --> 00:04:13,680
Rym: but Because one she was apologetic and realized that she had made the mistake to Just the absurdity of the fact that she'd hit me in the dent.

80
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:17,300
Scott: Well, I think as soon as you start laughing Even if it was me, right?

81
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,690
Scott: I would have probably gone there out of trying to get the ductible if it was a car I cared about and I cared about Doing the effort which I probably I wouldn't with your car.

82
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,988
Rym: if it was a car I cared about I would have fixed the dent Right in the first place though.

83
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:27,936
Rym: She would have made a new day.

84
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:28,480
Scott: That's true.

85
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:37,215
Scott: But the the fact that I would have seen her making a dent where there's already a dent My laughing uncontrollably would have prevented me from being able to do anything.

86
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:38,500
Rym: I was laughing show so hard.

87
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:38,983
Rym: She's like.

88
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:40,171
Rym: what's wrong?

89
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:46,773
Rym: And I'm like, all right And I tell her like the whole deal and she's like really like.

90
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:47,636
Rym: she didn't believe me.

91
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:52,098
Rym: Like I'm trying to scam her Seriously, I'm not gonna call the police.

92
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,505
Rym: just There's no damage to your car.

93
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:56,091
Rym: that I can tell and I really don't care.

94
00:04:56,111 --> 00:05:12,460
Rym: and I shook her hand and I drove away laughing Alright, so this woman who ran into my car with her giant SUV was saved from the wrath of Rym when he's in the right And has a police ready to back him up by the sheer absurdity of the random chance.

95
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:16,115
Scott: Well, I guess that story didn't go anywhere.

96
00:05:16,155 --> 00:05:20,062
Scott: We thought it was gonna go So I'll just add who was in the car besides her I don't know.

97
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:21,989
Scott: some kid didn't need that SUV.

98
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:22,912
Scott: get a real car.

99
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:24,116
Scott: Yeah small car.

100
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:24,918
Scott: That's all I'll say.

101
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,420
Rym: now I have a better bit, but I know different leader bit, but it was about a dream I had but I guess I could leave it at that but let that go.

102
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,607
Rym: I just want to say it involved saved by the bell.

103
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:34,390
Rym: What the fuck.

104
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,537
Scott: seriously the college years now.

105
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:38,204
Rym: now though I woke up.

106
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:47,550
Rym: I woke up and I laid in bed and I was thinking to myself wow And then I remembered the college years cuz I'd forgotten about that and I laid in bed Watch one episode of that.

107
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,800
Rym: I laid in bed for like 20 minutes And I was thinking so which was worse the college years or the new class?

108
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,034
Rym: Yeah, okay and screech was still there and yeah, what did he get held back?

109
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:00,660
Rym: No, he was like working at the school.

110
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,665
Rym: I think he was the principal.

111
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:02,268
Rym: I don't remember.

112
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:10,639
Rym: Oh, you know what he's doing now, but But yeah, I was Zach Morris and I'll and guitar heroes played heavily in.

113
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,587
Rym: Okay, I'll leave it at that sure.

114
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:15,855
Rym: so what do you have that can top that nothing?

115
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,437
Scott: really it's not.

116
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:18,391
Scott: I'm not topping something I just need to say something.

117
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:19,239
Rym: What do you need to say?

118
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,660
Scott: So I have not been a fan of the Facebook's or the Twitter's or the pounces or any of those sorts of things.

119
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:25,722
Rym: I'd be a fat You know what?

120
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:30,139
Rym: I would use Facebook if I didn't have my own personal forum that all my friends use.

121
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:33,052
Scott: Also, if I was still in college, I look at I've been.

122
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:34,900
Rym: oh god if I was still in college.

123
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:36,819
Scott: We were in college.

124
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:40,415
Scott: Facebook was around but it wasn't the business it is now.

125
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:50,980
Rym: now Facebook is amazing like seriously when we were in college like Facebook was barely an embryo and Orcutt was the hot shit among like the techie crowd and that got destroyed by the nation of Brazil.

126
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:56,620
Rym: But before that we all of us were using or cut like super hardcore and then it got ruined and we gave up.

127
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:03,820
Rym: but we saw that social networking was Awesome, if you're in college and now not so awesome for us personally, right?

128
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:04,956
Scott: Facebook is the business.

129
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:12,180
Scott: but You know, I have a Facebook account and I had a pounce account right, but I didn't really use these thingies.

130
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:27,186
Scott: I only use like dig and delicious and that's about it, you know, but for some reason for some reason I don't know why I had a policy where I wouldn't make anyone my friend on Facebook or pounds Unless I knew who they were.

131
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:32,208
Scott: and a lot of people would say be my friend and I say no be my friend No, and I wouldn't even I wasn't.

132
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:35,240
Scott: even I realized I'm not even freaking using these things.

133
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,895
Scott: What do I care if someone's my friend on these things or not?

134
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:38,840
Scott: I don't know what I was thinking.

135
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:47,449
Scott: I wasn't really thinking at all about it so much, you know, so I realized also maybe there's a chance, you know I mean these things don't really like.

136
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:49,400
Scott: I don't have a use for them, right?

137
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,958
Scott: like I'm poking at Facebook and there's like stuff to poke and it passes the time at work when I'm bored even though it Doesn't do anything for me.

138
00:07:57,622 --> 00:08:08,606
Rym: I had to step up from draw square on the desktop with a cursor, draw another square Draw a square around like waste ink doodling on a piece of paper draw a square around like miss Otto's face on the desktop three or four times.

139
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:16,319
Scott: Yeah, so I Decided now I'm gonna change my policy and if anyone wants to friend me on anything I'll just say yes.

140
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,873
Scott: And I think if I do that it might make these things more useful.

141
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:25,358
Scott: and also there's one called Jaiku which is sort of just like Twitter only not Twitter.

142
00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:29,959
Scott: and Basically, I wasn't interested in it and how Google bought it.

143
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,779
Scott: So I'm sort of interested to at least poke it for a few minutes.

144
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,469
Scott: But when Google bought it, they made it invite only.

145
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:38,017
Scott: so I want a Jaiku invite if anyone has one.

146
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,960
Rym: Ah Man, remember when we didn't have Gmail.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,560
Scott: Yeah, and if you've ever tried to friend me on Facebook or pounce or anything and I said no try again.

148
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:52,240
Rym: I will now say yes, not just no but no no no, no, no, no, right.

149
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:58,240
Rym: So in the news, I have to say something about this and I want to do a fun episode.

150
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,646
Rym: so I'm not gonna complain about people.

151
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:07,059
Rym: but there's an article here on slash dot and the headline is anti-terrorism and the death of the chemistry set.

152
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:13,208
Rym: I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna say it all what you think.

153
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:19,991
Rym: I'm gonna say because a lot of people are trying to make the argument that Chemistry sets are killed by all this anti-terrorism stuff.

154
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:22,620
Rym: partially that is not true at all.

155
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,442
Scott: There's actually.

156
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:24,907
Rym: there is almost nothing.

157
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:31,079
Rym: you need for a fun chemistry set that you cannot just get if you want it And there's no reason you couldn't include those in the chemistry set.

158
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:40,800
Rym: The reason chemistry sets are not around so much anymore Is that they are actually really dangerous if they're old-school and you can make very carcinogenic things very easily.

159
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:41,944
Scott: Yeah, there.

160
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:44,834
Rym: Oh what I'm saying is that you can still make a chemistry set.

161
00:09:45,055 --> 00:09:45,396
Scott: Yes.

162
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:46,460
Scott: See saws are dangerous.

163
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,726
Scott: You should have those for kids too.

164
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:50,920
Rym: I would argue that chemistry sets are far more dangerous.

165
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:57,980
Rym: Old-school kind of chemistry sets because you can make well depends how old-school we go in the radioactive old-school chemistry set.

166
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,784
Scott: Oh not radioactive.

167
00:09:58,804 --> 00:09:59,568
Scott: They made those.

168
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:07,846
Rym: the only reason they're not cool the only reason they don't make chemistry sets like they used to is that companies aren't stupid and an old-school chemistry set.

169
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:15,959
Rym: if parents don't keep an eye on kids or Kids don't read the instructions kids can make super dangerous and possibly deadly things that it.

170
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,280
Scott: that is Yeah, and really had to keep an eye on your kids no matter what they're doing.

171
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:20,499
Scott: No, but dangerous it is.

172
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:27,400
Rym: but what I'm saying is that the Liability there is massive and I don't think any company should market a chemistry set because they're just opening themselves up.

173
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:33,320
Scott: Then again, I think that you know They shouldn't really be liable if they put warnings on something and someone does it anyway.

174
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:37,960
Rym: But even then there's not a big market for that either because parents would be afraid of a chemistry.

175
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:42,020
Rym: I mean as a kid I had a chemistry set a kind of dangerous one.

176
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:43,867
Scott: I had an a dangerous one.

177
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:47,281
Scott: mine was for the thing is I took when I was at the local hobby shop They could.

178
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:50,735
Scott: they sold any chemical for a chemistry set that you wanted on its own.

179
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:58,100
Rym: when I was in high school I took organic chemistry the local community college and I learned a lot and I went back to my old chemistry set.

180
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,076
Rym: I was sifting through it and I realized just how carcinogenic half of the crap I had was.

181
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:04,942
Rym: I threw the stupid thing away Awesome.

182
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:23,640
Rym: I guess the problem is that chemistry sets no matter what warnings you were to write on them The fact is that chemistry as a whole unless you're doing simple things But like the amount of danger that can be created is far greater in many cases than the apparent danger Kind of like how I don't think we need.

183
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:27,700
Scott: You know, you're messing with a chemistry set that there's a lot of danger going on.

184
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:34,360
Rym: No I think the problem is that society in the US is such that People assume that things are safe if they can be bought in a store.

185
00:11:34,702 --> 00:11:36,860
Rym: Kind of like how you go to like an amusement park, right?

186
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,386
Rym: And you have the little.

187
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:43,160
Rym: you can drive the putt-putt car around the track and you can steer left and right But there's a rail.

188
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:46,626
Rym: so if you try to steer off the road It just kind of pulls the car back on the road.

189
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:55,520
Rym: as a result most kids I see on these things will Turn the opposite direction of the road every time because they know they can't go off the road and they just kind of go.

190
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,984
Scott: Yeah, there is it.

191
00:11:58,025 --> 00:11:59,591
Scott: there is a case to be made that sort of.

192
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,940
Scott: we've trapped ourselves in in this loop.

193
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:03,360
Scott: You know, we make things are dangerous.

194
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:08,630
Scott: So it made them safer and So people started to feel safe because things were safer.

195
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:19,200
Scott: and then we sort of can't escape into a situation Now where people where things are dangerous, but people realize they're dangerous because people have been trained for things to be safe.

196
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:22,960
Scott: So we have to make everything safe or else the people hurt themselves because they've been made.

197
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,039
Scott: you know growing up to assume everything is safe because we made it safe so that it wasn't crazy dangerous like in the olden days.

198
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:40,168
Scott: and you know, yeah, I think we had to strike some sort of balance between Some things we need to let them be dangerous in terms of for freedom and education and learning and growth of your mind and some Things we need to make safe.

199
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:44,220
Scott: So but not everyone just dies horribly But regardless that are stupid and preventable.

200
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,800
Rym: My point is very simply anyone who tries to blame terrorism or anti-terrorism laws on the death of the chemistry set.

201
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,468
Rym: that is pretty much completely incorrect.

202
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:58,308
Rym: and it is you're politicizing something that is not political and That's such a stupid our.

203
00:12:58,328 --> 00:12:59,594
Scott: it is a tiny bit true.

204
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:00,700
Scott: there are a few specific.

205
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:03,455
Rym: However, I want name something.

206
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:10,100
Scott: I don't know but Where were you read an article months ago that I could find if I wasn't middle of a podcast?

207
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,501
Scott: Yeah, so some guy on the internet a real like a scientist anyway Yeah Our get.

208
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:24,611
Scott: the thing I want to bring up about chemistry sets right is actually I think a large demise of the chemistry set is Greater attributed to the marketing of science to kids.

209
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:25,053
Scott: if you look at it.

210
00:13:25,213 --> 00:13:27,300
Scott: go look at pictures of chemistry sets online.

211
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:30,457
Scott: Right, look at a really old chemistry set from like the 60s or the 50s.

212
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,223
Scott: Look at the picture on there.

213
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:41,473
Scott: in the picture is scientists doing serious business and you know with like cool metal You know lab coats and and smartness going on metal lab coats.

214
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:41,814
Scott: Yeah.

215
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,878
Scott: Yeah metal lab coats.

216
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:50,343
Scott: It's awesome right and you you know, it's got all sorts of you know, like a 1950s sort of Like.

217
00:13:50,744 --> 00:13:53,812
Rym: maybe that's because those chemistry sets were marketed in the 1950s.

218
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:55,838
Scott: exactly if you look at a chemistry set.

219
00:13:55,918 --> 00:14:04,458
Scott: now though Right, the scientists are like wacky with like crazy Einstein hair like goofy glasses and all these multi colors.

220
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,000
Scott: and You market science now like it's some goofy kind of thing and not like a serious thing.

221
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:22,334
Scott: and I think that the change in the way we've marketed science to kids is Really what has caused the demise of the chemistry sentence, you know Kind of thing and it's not you know, no, it's not a serious thing.

222
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:23,720
Rym: I don't know if I agree with that.

223
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,280
Rym: I mean, I do agree that science is kind of seen differently nowadays.

224
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:33,966
Rym: But then again had the old way didn't get people into science any better than the new way It's really a long time ago.

225
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:41,594
Rym: I don't know all the scientists that are scientists right now Part of that just because it takes a long time to be a respected scientist.

226
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,598
Scott: I know I know.

227
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,660
Rym: so Plus, I mean how many of our friends are crazy?

228
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:52,240
Scott: There are decreasing numbers of you know people going into science majors at universities at least in the u.s.

229
00:14:52,762 --> 00:14:53,947
Scott: Other countries are doing fine.

230
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:59,400
Rym: Honestly, I think one of the big reasons for that is that High school no longer prepares you for college.

231
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:06,340
Rym: I do as a result I mean when I got to RIT and I had to take like some like the crap is calculus.

232
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:09,560
Rym: It was like can you do basic integrals and derivatives?

233
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:16,780
Rym: I can you do basic discrete math like such rudimentary calculus and People coming out of high school?

234
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:22,271
Rym: We're failing this class Miserably and having to retake it at my high school by default.

235
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:25,784
Scott: if you are the average kid taking the average class There's no honors.

236
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:26,629
Scott: No, nothing special.

237
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:28,340
Scott: You don't learn any calculus at all.

238
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:40,770
Rym: So yeah Yeah, but the thing is it's not just that because people came into RIT was just they lacked base the basic ability to do Algebra algebra basic algebra.

239
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,391
Scott: Yep.

240
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,400
Rym: So the calculus thing is like oh you can't do calculus.

241
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:46,608
Scott: So it's a multi-faceted process.

242
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:48,574
Rym: The professor was all like, all right.

243
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:50,220
Rym: Well, I'll break it down really simply.

244
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,003
Rym: So he goes into like some you know Basic algebra things like.

245
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:57,355
Rym: here's where calculus is derived from and he found that people couldn't do the basic algebra.

246
00:15:57,696 --> 00:15:57,857
Scott: Yeah.

247
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:00,046
Scott: Oh, well Yeah, why do you?

248
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:00,651
Scott: why are you here?

249
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:01,758
Scott: How did you get in?

250
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:09,340
Scott: Because all right, that is that is a multi-faceted problem going to high schools and college admissions and all sorts of things.

251
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:13,801
Scott: But yeah, I do think that the change in the way science is marketed is is said All right.

252
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:17,644
Rym: Anyway, let's do a show a Thursday on that at some point or a Monday I don't know.

253
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:22,020
Rym: I think I said everything I had to say now more about going into college and why people are so unprepared.

254
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:23,318
Scott: Okay, sure.

255
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,707
Scott: So I don't know which of mine.

256
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:28,920
Scott: both of my news things of the days are sort of both news and thing of the day.

257
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,645
Scott: So I'm just gonna pick this one to be the news.

258
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:31,167
Scott: Uh-huh.

259
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:32,832
Scott: So, you know what Disney World.

260
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:34,036
Scott: they have that ride.

261
00:16:34,518 --> 00:16:35,200
Scott: It's a small.

262
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,874
Rym: I wrote it once and I got stuck in it.

263
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:48,200
Scott: I wrote it I didn't get stuck in it and You know I had heard the song and I thought it was like this historic really important ride and it really wasn't so exciting.

264
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,866
Scott: I mean, it was cool, but it's historic.

265
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,255
Scott: I mean, you don't need to ride it more than once is all I'll say.

266
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:56,598
Rym: but anyway Much cooler is the troll ride in Epcot.

267
00:16:56,658 --> 00:17:09,640
Scott: Yeah when they made this ride in 1963 they made that ride under the assumption that the average male rider would be 175 pounds and the average woman rider would be at about a hundred and thirty five pounds.

268
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:11,083
Rym: I see what.

269
00:17:11,384 --> 00:17:12,489
Rym: I see what you did there.

270
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,773
Rym: I see where you're going with this.

271
00:17:13,794 --> 00:17:17,953
Rym: I Don't know if we need to continue and that's why.

272
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:24,280
Scott: and that's why Rym It's funny that you say you got stuck because these days it gets stuck quite often.

273
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:30,200
Rym: I just have to say I also got stuck in the haunted house and I remember when I was in line.

274
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:43,898
Rym: I didn't even think of this until just now but There was a woman and her kid and the woman could not fit in the haunted house booth with her kid And she was complaining about how the ride was bleh as a result and she demanded to be let on.

275
00:17:43,918 --> 00:17:50,072
Rym: and they're like We can't you don't fit Bottom but so that we get stuck in the ride, right?

276
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:53,373
Rym: You know, there's things that pop out and say boo Yeah, or scream or something.

277
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:54,220
Scott: the point of a haunted house.

278
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:01,831
Rym: So me and my grandma are stuck there for like 20 minutes, but the ride doesn't stop like everything's still going on Except we're not moving.

279
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:08,160
Rym: we stopped Exactly in front of like this box and every five seconds a witch popped out and went.

280
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:11,691
Rym: it was.

281
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:14,204
Rym: That was awesome.

282
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:19,258
Rym: Like if I could list some of the top ten things that happened to me that good fucking god.

283
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:23,481
Scott: So anyway So they made this ride The.

284
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:29,225
Scott: it's a small world after all right a long time ago in the 60s when people were less fat Averagedly in the u.s.

285
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:29,586
Scott: At least.

286
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:32,338
Scott: and well, they're closing it down to redo it.

287
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,700
Scott: They're going to make the flume bigger and wider and deeper with more water and bigger boats.

288
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:42,419
Scott: that fatter people can ride it without making the ride stop and making everyone wait on line.

289
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:45,029
Scott: and You know that the alternative is.

290
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:47,240
Scott: what they've been doing is like a fat person wants to ride.

291
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:55,460
Scott: They just put less people on the boat instead of filling it to capacity, you know But then it's longer lines because now they can do less people per boat.

292
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:55,520
Scott: You

293
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:14,079
Rym: know now that I recall cedar point had to do that on the two flumes like that a guy Who is always there and his job was to look at the people and dole them out into boats And you'd always see like a boat with a family of four boat with a family of four Four boats with four fat people that are obviously a family of four and another boat with a family of four.

294
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,080
Rym: Yep, of course what we always did is there's a there's a waterfall and there's a restaurant next to the waterfall.

295
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:25,138
Rym: So we'd sit there and wave at the people when they're coming around so they wouldn't see the waterfall coming.

296
00:19:25,158 --> 00:19:26,724
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I just want to.

297
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:33,471
Scott: I just want to throw that in as our monthly complaint about fat people and also Not like fat people not overweight people.

298
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:35,720
Rym: I think that the issue here is obese people.

299
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,860
Scott: Yes, there's you got to be obese to stop a ride.

300
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,434
Scott: There's a big buoyancy of the boat and your weight is conquering that.

301
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,197
Scott: come on.

302
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:44,100
Rym: There's a big difference.

303
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,960
Rym: That's a problem.

304
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,382
Rym: We just got it.

305
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:52,620
Rym: when we say fat people what we really mean are people who are like Obese to the point of where I would use the word morbid and people who did it to themselves.

306
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:58,006
Rym: Yeah, which is most of it if you got an extra 20 or 30 pounds, that's not What we're complaining about.

307
00:19:58,086 --> 00:20:00,314
Scott: if you're not stopping the boat, I don't care.

308
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:02,040
Rym: I don't want to give the wrong impression.

309
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,977
Scott: No, I do want to use it though as some evidence that like look these people are you know doing.

310
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:11,014
Scott: they're hurting themselves And they are hurting others and they here is an example of.

311
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:12,240
Scott: I mean, it's not a big deal.

312
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,232
Scott: Oh, no, the line for the amusement park ride takes longer.

313
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:15,494
Scott: Yeah.

314
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,819
Scott: Okay is in Disney World.

315
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:20,380
Scott: good God it is but it's not a big deal in terms of our society.

316
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:23,980
Scott: But it is example of look these people are hurting themselves.

317
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:25,446
Scott: No, I think it's.

318
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:26,149
Scott: it's not good.

319
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:30,777
Rym: the people who say that oh people aren't getting fatter We're just measuring differently or all that stuff.

320
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,700
Rym: But I mean when you get to the point where the flume ride the flume just stops halfway down.

321
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:39,180
Scott: Yes bottom down and in the 60s it never bottomed out.

322
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:43,260
Rym: Yeah, I mean what the physical properties of water did not change in the last.

323
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:47,336
Scott: Yes, what the boat is less buoyant than it was there 40 years ago.

324
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:56,008
Rym: things of the day.

325
00:20:56,901 --> 00:20:59,115
Scott: You know those biodiesel type people.

326
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,870
Scott: they think they're all green and cool, but they forget to fig.

327
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:05,450
Scott: You know calculate the fact of how much gas it takes to make the corn in the first place.

328
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,314
Rym: Well, it depends on.

329
00:21:06,374 --> 00:21:09,909
Rym: I mean if you make biodiesel from cane sugar, it looks like it works great.

330
00:21:10,373 --> 00:21:12,190
Scott: Yeah, it's all kinds of business with that.

331
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:12,787
Scott: But you know what?

332
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,650
Scott: We might not even need all that business because there's a guy named Jonathan Goodwin this the kudzu guy.

333
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:24,480
Rym: What there was a guy who figured out a way to make biodiesel out of kudzu Which is kind of grows without doing anything to it.

334
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:25,927
Scott: Oh, I guess that good.

335
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:27,714
Scott: That's good, too But no work fully yet.

336
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:29,499
Scott: This guy is even better.

337
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,666
Scott: I mean this is the only guy we need.

338
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:32,690
Scott: as far as I'm concerned.

339
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,540
Scott: He's basically a genius when it comes to mechanics.

340
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,730
Rym: Like he is easy normal Norman Borlaug.

341
00:21:41,393 --> 00:21:43,243
Scott: He might be he might be he.

342
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:44,470
Scott: he didn't really go.

343
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,450
Scott: I think he dropped out of school like in seventh grade it says and all he did was like buy old cars and repair them.

344
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:52,040
Scott: And you know, it's very much mechanic his whole life.

345
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:54,670
Rym: Wow, cuz you can't drop out of school in seventh grade now.

346
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:57,680
Scott: No, so he's 37 years old, right.

347
00:21:58,382 --> 00:22:03,449
Scott: and it says he when he dropped out or now now It says he looks like Kevin Costner with better hair.

348
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,519
Scott: But basically he is a professional car hacker.

349
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,430
Scott: people like famous people send him their cars and he hacks them up.

350
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:11,999
Rym: I should send him my car.

351
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,301
Rym: No.

352
00:22:12,321 --> 00:22:16,962
Scott: No, let me give you an example Right Neil Young just sent him a Lincoln Continental.

353
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:19,090
Scott: You know what he's gonna do that Lincoln Continental.

354
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:24,424
Rym: uh Put some nice spinners on it and an airfoil.

355
00:22:24,746 --> 00:22:25,689
Scott: No, he's not gonna do that.

356
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:30,932
Scott: He's going to take that Lincoln Continental and he is going to modify it with his special Technologies.

357
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:37,570
Scott: and when he is done with that Lincoln Continental it will get how many miles per gallon a billion a hundred.

358
00:22:37,952 --> 00:22:38,716
Rym: It's not too bad.

359
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:43,717
Scott: It will cut emissions by 80% and Double the horsepower.

360
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:54,841
Rym: Um, now I have to say one thing Is it possible that all he did was put a hidden tank full of rocket fuel and a special engine that slowly uses that rocket fuel?

361
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:55,230
Rym: and

362
00:22:56,394 --> 00:23:08,190
Scott: unlikely because I imagine when he gives these cars back to these people after they pay him a lot of money and they try to Fill it up with you know grease from the local McDonald's They're going to expect it to have twice the horsepower and 100 miles to the gallon.

363
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:08,672
Rym: Oh, it does.

364
00:23:08,693 --> 00:23:16,939
Rym: cuz the grease just like gets trapped somewhere to replace the rocket fuel That's slowly being used and when the rocket fuel runs out He says well, I guess your engine wore out here.

365
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:18,143
Rym: Let me fix it for you.

366
00:23:18,324 --> 00:23:19,910
Scott: It's possible, but it's unlikely.

367
00:23:20,993 --> 00:23:22,243
Scott: In addition, he's took.

368
00:23:22,283 --> 00:23:27,680
Scott: he took an h3 All right, then one of the worst cars ever second only to the h2.

369
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,230
Scott: I guess he's doubled the horsepower from 300 to 600.

370
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,293
Scott: Why?

371
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,658
Scott: Because now it gets 60 miles to the gallon.

372
00:23:36,738 --> 00:23:40,050
Rym: see that's the one thing that has always been known but people don't seem to do.

373
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,930
Rym: Is that you can use a turbo to get more horsepower and make a car better.

374
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,496
Scott: Oh, he's using a turbine.

375
00:23:45,536 --> 00:23:48,970
Scott: He's got the electric motor and the turbine in tandem.

376
00:23:50,051 --> 00:23:51,135
Scott: He's got it all going on.

377
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:53,967
Rym: It's what I was saying is you could use a turbo theoretically.

378
00:23:53,987 --> 00:23:54,610
Scott: This isn't a turbo.

379
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,412
Scott: This is I know.

380
00:23:55,493 --> 00:24:02,797
Rym: Yeah, I know while I was saying is theoretically you can use a turbo instead of increasing the power of a car Just making it more efficient.

381
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:04,123
Rym: Yeah, but no one ever does that.

382
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:05,669
Scott: Well, you could just supercharged it the same way.

383
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:09,649
Rym: Well, yeah, cuz it that's kind of beside the point.

384
00:24:09,689 --> 00:24:13,599
Rym: Yes Anyway Cuz a super and a turbo are not that different.

385
00:24:13,861 --> 00:24:15,950
Scott: Yeah, the point is is that for a long time?

386
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:18,590
Scott: You know, I don't want to be all conspiracy not here, right?

387
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:26,903
Scott: But you know people that like GM and Ford in places have all been saying Oh, you know, it's not possible to do these things, you know We can't make them any more fuel-efficient whatever.

388
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:29,661
Scott: if I was the government I would go and I would check this guy out.

389
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,368
Scott: if I was the congressman or a senator I would go and check this guy out.

390
00:24:32,932 --> 00:24:33,997
Scott: Make sure it was legit.

391
00:24:34,017 --> 00:24:35,524
Scott: bring some scientists with me, right?

392
00:24:35,987 --> 00:24:40,584
Scott: if it was legit I would immediately make a law saying well all cars have to be 60 miles to the gallon.

393
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:46,790
Scott: now that hummer is 60 miles a Gallon all cars can be that way and you start seeing turbos and all your cars big ones.

394
00:24:47,012 --> 00:24:48,668
Rym: I mean there there might be a lot of factors.

395
00:24:48,729 --> 00:24:49,212
Scott: now I don't want to.

396
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:51,970
Scott: there are a lot of factors, but even well play the devil's advocate have it.

397
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,125
Scott: You have a phase in time.

398
00:24:53,145 --> 00:24:57,990
Rym: Oh, no No, what I'm saying is that it's possible because there are a lot of technologies that you know.

399
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,670
Rym: They give you gains up front, but in the long run, maybe the engines are a lot less durable.

400
00:25:01,973 --> 00:25:03,770
Scott: There's all sorts of things to consider like that.

401
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:19,108
Scott: But in general for a long time people like G you know car companies have been saying this sort of stuff is impossible where Just by changing the mechanics of a car and getting away from an old Standard piston engine with the standard mechanics you can get a lot of efficiency without changing

402
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:19,630
Rym: a lot else.

403
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:26,430
Rym: Well, you know what the car companies are actually 100% correct in the regard that it's impossible for them because possible for them.

404
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:34,661
Rym: well when the majority of your expenses go to your old pensions and your workers because you The unions are good and bad.

405
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:34,963
Rym: I'm not.

406
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:36,190
Rym: I don't have an opinion on unions.

407
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,194
Scott: I do a union show.

408
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:41,350
Rym: I'll just say very simply I think unions are a tool that can be used for good or for bad.

409
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:43,682
Rym: Yeah, and I have no opinion on unions in general.

410
00:25:43,722 --> 00:25:47,518
Rym: I have opinions on specific unions Car industry Union.

411
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,249
Rym: Yeah problems in the u.s.

412
00:25:49,811 --> 00:25:56,550
Scott: It was it had a purpose it at a time of the Henry Ford times and now if you don't need it anymore Well, no, I think you could still have a purpose.

413
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:05,023
Scott: I think it's more a matter of the unions kind of got scary and corrupt and something like any anything No matter what it is the scary and corrupt is a problem no matter what it.

414
00:26:05,324 --> 00:26:10,795
Rym: so yeah, but still if this works I mean, yeah Maybe we should start using this.

415
00:26:10,996 --> 00:26:16,110
Scott: I would very much like a car that gets better gas mileage and more horsepower.

416
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:17,639
Scott: I would not have a problem with that.

417
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,142
Scott: How about you?

418
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:21,450
Rym: So, uh What's cooler than an Armenian?

419
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:24,256
Scott: Armenian you mean our man.

420
00:26:24,276 --> 00:26:26,704
Rym: it is a person from Armenia or Armenia.

421
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,690
Rym: the BBC pronounced it Armenia.

422
00:26:28,951 --> 00:26:29,813
Rym: Okay, I might be a British.

423
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:31,579
Scott: what's cooler than a person from Armenia?

424
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:35,010
Scott: how many people from Armenia, how about a rep?

425
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,247
Rym: from our from an Armenian?

426
00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:40,517
Rym: Okay, just check this video out.

427
00:26:40,537 --> 00:26:44,170
Rym: There's a whole bunch of them with varying levels of humor and I got a kick out of it.

428
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,379
Rym: It's uh, it's about red meat.

429
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:47,162
Scott: Okay.

430
00:26:47,182 --> 00:26:48,990
Scott: I watched one of these and I was not impressed.

431
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:50,760
Rym: Well, you're adorable jade.

432
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:57,572
Rym: if you didn't even like that awesome Bioshock cosplay with a little girl the costume wasn't the greatest bow shot custom I've seen.

433
00:26:57,853 --> 00:26:58,074
Scott: where?

434
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:59,238
Rym: where have you seen a better one?

435
00:26:59,358 --> 00:26:59,840
Scott: on the Internet's?

436
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:01,586
Scott: where on websites?

437
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:02,449
Rym: I'm sure yeah.

438
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,978
Rym: Are you sure it was a website?

439
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:05,790
Rym: Are you sure it wasn't nothing?

440
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:10,786
Scott: I'm sure and even so the video was sort of like, alright, nothing exciting happening here.

441
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:11,267
Scott: move on.

442
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:13,700
Rym: Okay Well, you're just a jaded horrible person.

443
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:15,470
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure I find this funny.

444
00:27:15,812 --> 00:27:17,606
Scott: I think you're easily amused and simple-minded.

445
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:27,575
Rym: take that You know what easily amused means there's a lot more enjoyment to be had in the world a lot less brains Or a lot less Horrible tedious boredom.

446
00:27:27,595 --> 00:27:30,186
Scott: I got my non horrible tedious.

447
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:31,110
Scott: What are you talking about?

448
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,810
Rym: You didn't do anything at work today, but putts around and be bored.

449
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:36,395
Rym: Yeah, you know what.

450
00:27:36,475 --> 00:27:39,190
Rym: I thought that for about a week and there's a reason I quit my job.

451
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:41,821
Scott: Yeah, that's the reason I quit the last job too.

452
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:43,450
Scott: But no I do do work.

453
00:27:43,551 --> 00:27:44,819
Scott: I just finished my work yesterday.

454
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,504
Scott: cuz I'm so awesome.

455
00:27:45,524 --> 00:27:46,269
Scott: They didn't give me new work.

456
00:27:49,772 --> 00:27:51,097
Scott: Okay, so today on the show, what are we doing?

457
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:53,526
Rym: well actually we had we had see.

458
00:27:53,546 --> 00:28:06,747
Rym: the thing is lately we've been doing a lot of shows where we talk about something that's bothersome to us or something where we have a strong opinion or a controversial subject and we ought to do our research or something and always it's not as fun to do.

459
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:12,149
Rym: and we realized that The question show was a lot more fun because it was just kind of we just it's really fun to do it.

460
00:28:12,652 --> 00:28:13,797
Rym: so we tried to think you know, what could we do?

461
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,360
Rym: that could be fun.

462
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:20,499
Rym: and we looked in the calendar and the show for today was ADD and ADHD and medicating children.

463
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,537
Scott: and we realized we have a lot of opinion and not a lot of facts because there isn't a Lot of facts on that issue.

464
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:27,590
Rym: Well, it was also one of those we would have.

465
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:31,149
Rym: It's a controversial issue and we would have been fun to do and screw it.

466
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:36,770
Rym: And then Emily said why don't you do a show on books you liked and that actually works really?

467
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:40,064
Rym: Well, and it's really easy to do and really fun to do because I want you.

468
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:44,259
Scott: we could do a geek dance book club If you want perhaps we could maybe once a month.

469
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,306
Scott: I think I'm stealing that from someone else though.

470
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:53,066
Rym: Oh, no Yeah, anyway, so at least for now, I think cuz we talked we've done this a few times.

471
00:28:53,267 --> 00:29:04,469
Rym: we've mentioned books we like but I think we're just gonna kind of Take turns talking about books that have affected us or that we really remember as being awesome and I'd say it That's that's as much as we thought about this topic.

472
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,961
Scott: Alright, yeah, I guess what it is.

473
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:08,630
Scott: We've been doing this for two years, right?

474
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:11,610
Scott: And you know, we've always said yeah book reviews fit into the show.

475
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,975
Scott: You know, if it's a sci-fi book we could do it Monday, I guess kind of yeah, there aren't so many sci-fi books We've both read.

476
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:18,684
Scott: we read like lost kingdoms or something.

477
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:19,650
Scott: We could do that in Wednesday.

478
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,030
Rym: I mean, I guess we've both read stranger in a strange land.

479
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:27,187
Rym: But yeah, I got to admit talking about that book would be boring to dry.

480
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:28,130
Scott: cuz pretty dry.

481
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:33,497

00:29:33,658 --> 00:29:34,970
Rym: I didn't read the lensman books yet.

483

Scott: ah, yes you do to take the TV show double the badassness put in space.

488
00:29:48,532 --> 00:29:52,082

489
00:29:52,142 --> 00:29:53,747
Rym: It's the exact same relationship.

00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:28,350
Rym: I've heard this from a lot of people.

533
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,848
Rym: It's been recommended to me highly and I plan to read it and you all probably should too.

00:32:32,948 --> 00:32:34,809
Scott: It's cheap It doesn't take that long to read.

535
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:38,743
Scott: It took me like a week or so and see I got a problem here about magic.

536
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:44,945

537
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,210
Rym: I like me a lot of golems.

538
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:49,302
Rym: I there was a good escape pod about some golems not too long.

539
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,350
Scott: Like I'm talking about the golem, you know the Prague golem.

540
00:32:51,932 --> 00:32:53,762
Rym: Oh, I'm talking about just golems.

541
00:32:53,963 --> 00:32:54,546
Scott: No, not done.

542
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:55,270
Scott: Not those golems.

543
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,907
Scott: No, the golem as a capital T golem the capital the.

544
00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:06,930
Scott: yeah This book has all of that and it's somehow it all works together in one thing and how it works together is is just crazy.

545
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:09,169
Scott: But it's uh, it's got everything.

546
00:33:09,994 --> 00:33:12,246
Scott: Best novel of last ten years probably.

547
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:21,184
Rym: All right So this is a book that my professed liking of gets me a lot of crap Especially from a few of our friends who will remain name.

548
00:33:21,224 --> 00:33:21,706
Scott: How about me?

549
00:33:21,726 --> 00:33:22,469
Scott: Does it get crap from me?

550
00:33:22,972 --> 00:33:30,990
Rym: Not so much, but it gets crap from a few people and They go on and on about how he's a terrible author and blah blah blah and his books are all.

551
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:32,280
Rym: I'm not gonna get into it.

552
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,441
Rym: But I Really like the Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway.

553
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:39,715
Rym: like I it's one of my favorite books I own.

554
00:33:40,037 --> 00:33:49,828
Rym: I don't own a first edition like I do with the ratio books But I own like the 1956 printing and had to read that for college I think in some class and it was okay.

555
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:57,110
Rym: I had to read it in like 11th or 12th grade and I Well, the thing is I'd read like someone with the people getting super drunk in Spain in the bullfighting.

556
00:33:57,831 --> 00:34:01,105
Rym: That doesn't really narrow it down with Hemingway, you know, yeah.

557
00:34:01,145 --> 00:34:08,731
Scott: Yeah, it's that one It's that's the one right where I was so amazed reading the early parts of it when I realized that people were drinking wine by The bottle.

558
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:19,330
Rym: Yeah, and especially because well, I mean if you tally up the amount of alcohol they drink it That would be like an ob7 test and burning wheel to not die something like that.

559
00:34:19,732 --> 00:34:20,416
Scott: I was just amazed.

560
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:22,849
Scott: I was like, is this is this supposed to be believable?

561
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,650
Rym: See the thing is I I really dig this book.

562
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:40,567
Rym: I mean I in general I really like Ernest Hemingway is writing and I think a lot of people who just dismiss him as simplistic or I think a lot of people dismiss his works out of hand or because they're told to dismiss it by Teachers they get who are

563
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:40,850
Scott: yeah

564
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:41,793
Rym: I mean, I can't.

565
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:42,114
Rym: really.

566
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:46,929
Rym: I'm not certain kinds of literature teachers who will always say yeah Ernest Hemingway is crap.

567
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,597
Scott: I'm not a dismister of Hemingway.

568
00:34:48,617 --> 00:34:51,409
Scott: The old man in the sea is the business, but I don't know.

569
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,717
Rym: I like farewell to arms a lot.

570
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:53,621
Scott: I didn't read that one.

571
00:34:53,683 --> 00:34:54,929
Rym: See you would probably like that.

572
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,679
Rym: There's a lot of World War one action.

573
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:58,849
Scott: Anyway, Sun Also Rises kind of for me.

574
00:34:59,212 --> 00:34:59,939
Scott: I mean, it's not like.

575
00:35:00,242 --> 00:35:05,090
Scott: oh, it's a terrible book But it then again, I'm not like, you know jumping for joy over it like you see I guess what it was.

576
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,722
Rym: I'd read a lot of Hemingway's other works and then I read this.

577
00:35:08,782 --> 00:35:21,976
Rym: so I kind of had the Hemingway context in place and as a result plus also one of my Witty moments in high school, even though I'm sure other people have made this joke but I said something to the effect of the Sun Also Rises.

578
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:31,967
Rym: I AKA at least the Sun rises and no one got it except like two kids in class and the literature teacher And I got bad props for that.

579
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:33,312
Rym: I was very proud and to this day.

580
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:44,960
Rym: I wear that as a tiny badge of witticism Partly because the I remember I had one kid who went on and on about the Symbolism of the scene at the end with the baton and I thought he was stretching it a little bit.

581
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:51,539
Rym: But then I read the whole book again, and I was like, wow I think Hemingway actually did mean that phallic symbolism and I don't think I can deny it.

582
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:55,345
Scott: No, it's really it's really hard to deny I mean if you if you ever.

583
00:35:55,365 --> 00:35:58,338
Scott: I guess I've never met Hemingway, but from what I've known of him.

584
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:09,119
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I guess it's just what I liked so much about this book was that on one hand I saw these characters is so jaded and cynical and ruined has like hulks of people.

585
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:22,231
Rym: and Yet at the same time Well, I remember when the main character goes off and he just stays alone in the mountains like fishing with his one friend fishing and drinking and doing nothing else and He's happy and color comes back into the world and I don't know.

586
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:26,419
Rym: it felt like you can escape from that like the Sun sets But it also rises.

587
00:36:27,442 --> 00:36:31,040
Rym: The problem is the characters don't actually realize that and none of them.

588
00:36:31,361 --> 00:36:32,345
Rym: Well, one guy is like.

589
00:36:33,028 --> 00:36:34,294
Rym: I guess it's just I can't.

590
00:36:34,415 --> 00:36:35,620
Rym: I don't want to go too long about this.

591
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:41,040
Rym: The story follows the main character, but he is not the real main character.

592
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,309
Rym: He's the one who doesn't escape from the jaded system cynicism of life.

593
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,100
Rym: that other guy the boxer escapes from that and has a real life.

594
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:49,150
Scott: Oh, right.

595
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:49,979
Scott: I remember this book.

596
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,975
Rym: Yeah the book was great because it would it followed one guy but the moral was about the other guy.

597
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:58,980
Rym: and if you read the book and You think it was about the cynical guy and it's a depressing book.

598
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,691
Scott: But I do remember that the boxer was the business and the other people.

599
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:02,333
Rym: that's it.

600
00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:03,980
Rym: The story is about the boxer.

601
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:05,530
Rym: It's not about the main character.

602
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,375
Rym: I think his name was Jack.

603
00:37:06,395 --> 00:37:07,180
Rym: I haven't read it in a while.

604
00:37:07,822 --> 00:37:08,852
Scott: It's a favorite book.

605
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:09,740
Scott: What's the main character's name?

606
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,379
Rym: I've read it like ten times, but I haven't read it in like five years.

607
00:37:13,902 --> 00:37:19,957
Rym: But seriously, the book is about the boxer and if you read it in that way Then it is a romance you want it to be about the.

608
00:37:19,978 --> 00:37:22,712
Rym: well No I even I think Hemingway said something to where.

609
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:25,848
Rym: if you read it about him Then it's a romance story.

610
00:37:26,129 --> 00:37:27,797
Rym: if you read it about any other character.

611
00:37:27,817 --> 00:37:28,480
Rym: It's a tragedy.

612
00:37:29,043 --> 00:37:32,440
Rym: Yeah, pretty much and the bullfighters kind of a cock and I'll leave it at that.

613
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:39,429
Scott: Bullfight screw you if you don't like this book, okay What book should I talk about next?

614
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:40,372
Scott: Let's see.

615
00:37:40,412 --> 00:37:41,476
Rym: All right, I got a list here.

616
00:37:41,516 --> 00:37:42,420
Scott: I got I got ready.

617
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:44,100
Scott: Okay, so, you know Roald Dahl?

618
00:37:44,841 --> 00:37:53,838
Scott: Yes, yeah Roald Dahl He wrote books such as Matilda and James and the Giant Peach and Charlie the Great Glass elevator and Charlie Chocolate Factory and all those books that you enjoyed When you were a kid.

619
00:37:53,921 --> 00:38:01,912
Scott: Well when I was a kid I pretty much read all his books because it was easy because all the books are published in the same format so I could recognize Them in the store and I knew which ones they didn't have.

620
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:11,060
Scott: it was great and You know some of his books were just sort of like Quirky sort of weird stuff like the twits, you know, and some of his books were serious business.

621
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:19,480
Scott: But there's one book of his that is overlooked I'd say more than all the others but it is the most serious business and it might be one of the best books there is.

622
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,062
Scott: Period.

623
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:28,100
Scott: the book is called the wonderful story of Henry sugar I think and some others and it's a book that contains a bunch of short stories.

624
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:35,826
Scott: but there's one relatively big story in the book compared to the others, which is the story of Henry sugar and it tries to make you believe.

625
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:38,899
Scott: it's about a real person which I don't believe but that doesn't matter.

626
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:43,790
Scott: and Basically, the story is this there's a guy he's loaded.

627
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:46,117
Scott: He lives in London, you know in a flat.

628
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,040
Scott: That's mad moneys.

629
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:53,625
Scott: He's got mad moneys and all he does every day is go to casino and he casinos people smoking cigars And it's big casino life.

630
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,753
Scott: and that's his living right gambling and whoo?

631
00:38:55,954 --> 00:38:57,560
Scott: richness and drunken and sleeping, right?

632
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,551
Scott: and one day he goes to.

633
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:09,884
Scott: he's like on vacation somewhere I get your Visiting someone at their big mansion, you know, cuz that's what rich people do and there's a poker game But there's too many people.

634
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:10,949
Scott: so he has to sit out.

635
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:13,700
Scott: He goes to the library in this guy's mansion.

636
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,047
Scott: It's good.

637
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:22,660
Scott: He's all alone there's no one else picks up a book and he starts reading it and Then it cuts to this book and basically the book he reads is in the book.

638
00:39:23,222 --> 00:39:28,062
Scott: you start reading that book and then you're done and it's back to Henry sugar and It.

639
00:39:29,048 --> 00:39:30,296
Scott: I'm not gonna say anything more.

640
00:39:30,337 --> 00:39:33,083
Scott: that happens But this book will teach you this.

641
00:39:33,884 --> 00:39:58,870
Scott: just one story within this book of short stories, right which has a book in it will teach you everything you need to know about charity and money and Randy bullshit and gambling and living and everything and It's like one of the best books there is and you could probably get it for really cheap and it won't take you that long To read because I read it when I was in like fifth grade.

642
00:39:58,951 --> 00:40:01,889
Scott: So I think you can read it now, you mean I don't think we have any fifth graders listening, right?

643
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,416
Scott: So you're older than a fifth grader.

644
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:05,205
Scott: You can read this easily quickly.

645
00:40:05,426 --> 00:40:07,552
Scott: You should get it Right.

646
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:11,653
Rym: So this one is gonna be out of place, especially with all the other books I'm talking about.

647
00:40:11,713 --> 00:40:15,826
Rym: but and I have a few friends who have read this and they agree with me.

648
00:40:15,866 --> 00:40:19,870
Rym: So I feel not Too off base in stating this opinion.

649
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:25,270
Rym: But when I was a kid, I read all those like forgotten realms books and I avoided those books.

650
00:40:25,711 --> 00:40:31,714
Rym: I read one dragon lads book and then I had started to read another one that I realized that I hate dragon lands and all that.

651
00:40:31,895 --> 00:40:37,950
Rym: but I read a lot of those and some were okay and some were awful and some Some of them were particularly awful.

652
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:44,630
Rym: But of all those books there's one that stands out as though it shouldn't be in the same section.

653
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:55,410
Rym: I don't know why but this one book is just good like actually good Stands on its own as a good novel a really good novel a disturbing novel.

654
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:58,929
Rym: It is Troy Dennings pages of pain.

655
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:11,070
Rym: now It is set in the planescape universe and has like the planescape logo like everything else, but don't be fooled This book has practically nothing to do with Dungeons & Dragons and you don't need to know anything about it.

656
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,595
Scott: Why did they put the logo on there?

657
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:13,820
Scott: making me be skeptical.

658
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,590
Scott: putting that logo on there is like let's make Scott skeptical.

659
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:22,753
Rym: well, because it's nominally written in this universe and it's part of all these books, but the thing is it stands alone and like it.

660
00:41:23,254 --> 00:41:35,987
Rym: it kind of takes some of the core ideas of some of the very basic ideas of planescape in this world and goes in a very I guess unexpected and interesting direction and

661
00:41:36,649 --> 00:41:36,750
Scott: it's

662
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:56,461
Rym: kind of almost a retelling of the story of Theseus, but it's Really well-written and really disturbingly written and I don't know this is one of those books that actually affected me in a very profound way and I remember I got to a point where I just stayed up all night reading the end of it and I Don't want to ruin anything.

663
00:41:56,623 --> 00:42:18,409
Rym: I just want to say If you like literature or fantasy or anything Just pick up Troy Dennings pages of pain and just read it Read it all the way through and tell me what you think about it because this book it Transcends what you would expect from a book like this and I hold it high on the list of books I have read in my life.

664
00:42:18,671 --> 00:42:31,248
Scott: I'm just generally skeptical of any book that has some sort of licensed property logo on the cover because that tells me that this person who wrote this book didn't think it was a good enough to stand on its own and they needed to somehow sell It to fans of that

665
00:42:32,313 --> 00:42:32,678
Rym: property.

666
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:42,342
Rym: the thing is But Troy Dennings, I mean he wrote a lot of stuff for D&D and he wrote under a bunch of pseudonyms And he's kind of big in that, you know industry of writing things.

667
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:44,930
Scott: I'm not saying that's like some law of the universe or anything.

668
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,709
Scott: I'm just saying that's what when I see that there.

669
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:47,874
Scott: That's what I think.

670
00:42:47,934 --> 00:42:54,743
Scott: so I tend to steer away and I'm incredibly skeptical of like any book with a Star Trek logo or Star Wars logo or a battle tech logo, even if it's.

671
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:58,942
Scott: I mean, I love Star Wars But a Star Wars logo on a books tells me stay away.

672
00:42:59,404 --> 00:43:00,870
Rym: This is such an exception.

673
00:43:01,072 --> 00:43:08,930
Rym: I seriously cannot recommend this book highly enough though I will warn you this book is a tad disturbing and super depressing.

674
00:43:09,674 --> 00:43:10,076
Scott: That's fine.

675
00:43:10,137 --> 00:43:18,386
Scott: If you couldn't tell from the title pages of pain Alright, so, you know that relatively new Miyazaki movie that ghetto Senki whatever.

676
00:43:18,407 --> 00:43:23,325
Scott: Uh, yeah Yeah, it was based on these books and I think there was a science fiction channel.

677
00:43:23,505 --> 00:43:24,650
Rym: Oh, this is a good call.

678
00:43:25,091 --> 00:43:31,294
Scott: there's a lot of science fiction channel live-action miniseries, but I heard that it was terrible even though I never saw it and I never.

679
00:43:31,315 --> 00:43:38,671
Scott: I haven't seen the Miyazaki movie yet Although I'm sure I will at some point and from what I hear while it I don't I'm not sure how good or bad it Was.

680
00:43:38,711 --> 00:43:47,470
Scott: people didn't seem to say it was as good as other Miyazaki movies and the person who wrote these books It was based on said well, it was a you know, she didn't like say all was terrible.

681
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,777
Scott: She said well, it was something different.

682
00:43:48,797 --> 00:43:49,722
Scott: It wasn't my story.

683
00:43:49,742 --> 00:44:00,719
Scott: It was his story, right and up these books were based on these books these these movies and miniseries and things were based on a series of books Called the Earthsea.

684
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:18,770
Scott: whatever Chronicles whatever you want to call them it's Earthsea the tales of Earthsea by Ursula K Le Guin and I own like a zillion books by this lady and There's four or five of them and you really only have to read like the first three or four You know, you should be able to get them like in a set with all the same printing on them.

685
00:44:19,234 --> 00:44:20,790
Scott: And these are I'm not gonna lie there.

686
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,617
Scott: They're basically, you know, they're.

687
00:44:22,677 --> 00:44:28,040
Scott: they're fantasy novels written at sort of a children's level, you know But if you're reading Harry Potter, you should not be.

688
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:29,145
Scott: you can read these.

689
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:30,270
Scott: it's better than Harry Potter.

690
00:44:30,872 --> 00:44:34,347
Rym: I just have to say the story of Harry Potter is all cool.

691
00:44:34,448 --> 00:44:34,930
Rym: And I like the.

692
00:44:35,953 --> 00:44:37,878
Rym: I like the characters.

693
00:44:37,918 --> 00:44:38,600
Rym: I like the story.

694
00:44:38,661 --> 00:44:44,283
Rym: I think Snape is like the best dude ever but That woman cannot write.

695
00:44:44,384 --> 00:44:45,652
Scott: good god I don't like.

696
00:44:46,234 --> 00:44:49,890
Scott: I don't like anything about Harry Potter except for funny flash videos just will make out of it.

697
00:44:50,151 --> 00:44:52,376
Scott: Oh, yeah, that can be funny.

698
00:44:52,477 --> 00:44:57,510
Rym: just the way she writes like her use of English just bothers me and I can't get past that.

699
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:01,244
Scott: So you need if you need a point of reference to see how much Harry Potter sucks.

700
00:45:01,606 --> 00:45:02,650
Scott: Earthsea is the business.

701
00:45:02,711 --> 00:45:04,086
Scott: This is where you want to go All right.

702
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:04,551
Scott: You know how.

703
00:45:04,592 --> 00:45:16,250
Scott: sometimes you read like some sort of epic fantasy trilogy or something and it always feels even Lord of the Rings Right, it feels like the real business went down before the books you're reading aka like in the Silmarillion, right?

704
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:19,030
Scott: But it's like whatever the story you're reading about now.

705
00:45:19,471 --> 00:45:22,560
Scott: They always talk about the epic war of the past.

706
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,170
Scott: that is so much bigger and badder than the thing that you're wrong right now.

707
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:32,767
Rym: I think part of the reason for that is that Following the bigger better epic story is often not nearly as interesting.

708
00:45:32,968 --> 00:45:35,647
Scott: That is true And I there's a certain amount of merit in that.

709
00:45:35,687 --> 00:45:52,265
Scott: However This story of Earthsea at least the first three books right tells the story of this guy get right and It feels like when you're at the beginning of the book right when you're reading early on it feels like The awesome stuff all happened in the past when the world was full of dragons.

710
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,018
Scott: and look at the guy Mentoring the main character.

711
00:45:55,058 --> 00:46:01,210
Scott: get he is like, you know the most Badassist wizard, you know there is and everything is all man's right?

712
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:23,422
Scott: But as you read on you realize that Ged is basically like the Merlin of this universe, you know, it's like yeah There was badass stuff in the past, but you're reading the story of the guy not like, you know You know Luke Skywalker, but in the past, you know, Yoda was really the guy, you know Not like Darth Vader was really the guy in the past.

713
00:46:23,462 --> 00:46:25,129
Scott: No, this is the guy.

714
00:46:25,612 --> 00:46:29,189
Scott: so as you read on this is this is so awesome this shit.

715
00:46:29,209 --> 00:46:34,830
Scott: and You know, it's not like the deepest thing and he it's not shallow, but it's not like the deepest thing ever.

716
00:46:35,132 --> 00:46:45,471
Scott: there's there's you know a nice poignant message towards the end of the first book and You know They start introducing different characters and like the second and third books and they get it and Ged sort of becomes like, you know You.

717
00:46:45,491 --> 00:46:54,847
Scott: it's like you read the story of this guy in the first book and then in like the later books He sort of becomes this, you know, distant amazing powerful guy, but you're like wait, I read that story.

718
00:46:55,068 --> 00:47:00,030
Scott: Oh my god You know it, you know, imagine if like, you know the first Harry Potter book, you know, it's okay.

719
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:05,070
Scott: And then the second Harry Potter book is about someone else and Harry Potter is like some you know, mystical.

720
00:47:05,311 --> 00:47:07,317
Scott: Oh my god guy that like doesn't even show.

721
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:09,063
Scott: that's how awesome this is.

722
00:47:09,103 --> 00:47:12,375
Scott: That's the feeling you get while reading it and It's high quality.

723
00:47:12,435 --> 00:47:13,720
Scott: It doesn't take long to read at all.

724
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,470
Scott: They're like little books meant for much younger audience.

725
00:47:17,175 --> 00:47:18,505
Scott: Why am I doing all these young kids books?

726
00:47:18,566 --> 00:47:18,868
Scott: I don't know.

727
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:28,164
Rym: So I gotta say and I think I've made reference to this before but I think my favorite Novel ever like of all time hands down is the Count of Monte Cristo.

728
00:47:28,606 --> 00:47:33,745
Rym: You only read that recently I know and you know, well recently God I read it when I was still going to RIT.

729
00:47:33,765 --> 00:47:34,749
Scott: Oh, did you?

730
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:37,763
Scott: Yeah I thought you read it like, okay, whatever.

731
00:47:38,005 --> 00:47:38,748
Scott: Yeah, okay.

732
00:47:39,412 --> 00:47:50,259
Rym: And I'd read excerpts from it a lot of excerpts from it throughout, you know high school even in middle school like short like I guess simplified excerpts and Relatively recently like in the last many years.

733
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:55,543
Rym: I read the whole thing straight up Relatively unabridged and it's just.

734
00:47:55,924 --> 00:47:57,250
Rym: it's one of my favorite novels ever.

735
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,169
Rym: I'm not gonna tell you the story of the Count of Monte Cristo other than that.

736
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:05,309
Rym: It is probably the best story of revenge ever written.

737
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:07,516
Rym: I Cannot name one better.

738
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:09,586
Scott: It is quite a story of revenge.

739
00:48:09,647 --> 00:48:10,250
Scott: There is no doubt

740
00:48:10,652 --> 00:48:31,545
Rym: I just I love it and to get into no great detail I think the reason I like it the mope beyond anything else is that partly because of the way it was written it Ended up that the like the pace of the story, you know a lot of novels like skip over a lot or the action kind of zooms in and zooms out and speeds up and slows down depending on what action is going on.

741
00:48:31,605 --> 00:48:41,486
Rym: like a Scene where there's action will be described in like excruciating detail But then other scenes will be described in little detail and important details will kind of stand out.

742
00:48:41,526 --> 00:49:03,830
Rym: Scooby Doo ish almost The Count of Monte Cristo keeps an even keel pretty much throughout to the point that Everything is described very kind of straightforward matter-of-factly and I don't know as a result and it's all like from the perspective of the count and You just kind of go through this story in a semi-realistic way and it just it draws me along in such this.

743
00:49:04,558 --> 00:49:05,043
Rym: I love it.

744
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:07,517
Scott: I Say about that book though.

745
00:49:07,557 --> 00:49:10,010
Scott: Is that it was from a time where they paid you by the page?

746
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,496
Rym: Oh, yeah, he was paid like by the word.

747
00:49:12,557 --> 00:49:15,246
Rym: There's a reason why he was so circuitous in his eye.

748
00:49:15,647 --> 00:49:20,430
Rym: Yeah, but Regardless of why it was written that way this book is fucking awesome.

749
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:30,709
Rym: And also I do want to say however if you were going to read it Read the translation by Robin bust and don't read any other translation because they're all pretty awful.

750
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:35,488
Rym: Okay and read an unabridged like the relatively unabridged penguin classics.

751
00:49:35,668 --> 00:49:40,390
Rym: one is Like the best translation of this book and a lot of people say oh they dumbed it down.

752
00:49:40,455 --> 00:49:50,430
Rym: No All they did was take because the thing is it was written kind of in colloquial French Which sounds kind of stilted if you translate it directly or you mean air it to modern French.

753
00:49:51,172 --> 00:49:57,675
Rym: So a lot a lot of the translation so much end up translating it in this really stilted way But it was written in the vernacular.

754
00:49:58,057 --> 00:50:01,869
Rym: So the the bus translation is really kind of a vernacular.

755
00:50:01,929 --> 00:50:09,019
Rym: and also Okay Read the penguin classics one.

756
00:50:09,341 --> 00:50:10,967
Rym: Don't bother with any other translation.

757
00:50:10,987 --> 00:50:11,610
Rym: You'll enjoy it.

758
00:50:11,992 --> 00:50:13,578
Scott: It's a public domain book.

759
00:50:13,598 --> 00:50:16,390
Scott: So like anyone in their mother can print a copy in any form they want.

760
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:21,858
Rym: But the penguin classics one I just looked it up was actually written in 1996. so it's a recent translation.

761
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:25,230
Rym: All right, and read that one seriously forget anything else.

762
00:50:26,093 --> 00:50:27,819
Scott: All right, I'm gonna do a double book combo.

763
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,388
Rym: You don't watch any movies because they're unmitigated.

764
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:31,613
Scott: Lee awful I'd never seen any.

765
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:32,757
Scott: they're awful.

766
00:50:32,777 --> 00:50:34,342
Scott: Isn't there like incredibly old black and white there.

767
00:50:34,362 --> 00:50:35,226
Scott: It's supposed to be gone.

768
00:50:35,306 --> 00:50:36,430
Rym: No, it's not good.

769
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:37,694
Rym: Okay, it's awful.

770
00:50:37,714 --> 00:50:43,350
Scott: All right, so I got a double book combo right ready one really small book and one really big book ready.

771
00:50:44,752 --> 00:50:48,969
Scott: If you're playing civilization and you want the mad moneys, what do you build?

772
00:50:49,371 --> 00:50:50,956
Rym: Well, what do I build?

773
00:50:50,976 --> 00:50:55,430
Rym: Oh, I know where you're going with this because what I build are fanatics because that's all I use.

774
00:50:55,991 --> 00:50:59,962
Rym: Before that I filled Marco Polo and then I build Adam Smith.

775
00:51:00,363 --> 00:51:02,850
Scott: Adam Smith and what do they teach you in social studies class?

776
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,786
Scott: About how you know, we have capitalism.

777
00:51:05,826 --> 00:51:06,270
Scott: Where did that come?

778
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:12,750
Rym: Well, they always they always dumb it down and say well capitalism is all Adam Smith and communism is all Karl Marx or possibly angles.

779
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:13,231
Rym: Yep,

780
00:51:13,854 --> 00:51:22,713
Scott: and that's what they teach you in school and whatever truth may lie in that the fact of the matter is this I'm not gonna art make a communism versus capitalism argument right now but I'll say this

781
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:23,455
Rym: go

782
00:51:23,575 --> 00:51:35,354
Scott: on Amazon and if you don't already buy a copy of the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Buy a copy of the Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith and when you get these books in the mail from Amazon They're pretty cheap.

783
00:51:35,394 --> 00:51:36,682
Scott: I mean, these are public domain books.

784
00:51:36,742 --> 00:51:37,949
Scott: This is just so good.

785
00:51:38,673 --> 00:51:44,234
Scott: one of these books is very small and one of these books is very big and I can tell you which is which.

786
00:51:44,836 --> 00:51:46,723
Scott: but I will tell you that is obvious.

787
00:51:46,843 --> 00:51:50,268
Scott: one person thought their clever plan through and one person did not.

788
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,333
Scott: Now I Only own one of these.

789
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:57,819
Scott: I only own one of these books.

790
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,770
Scott: the larger one because the smaller one is is not needed.

791
00:52:01,332 --> 00:52:02,817
Rym: I uh, I own the smaller one.

792
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:05,064
Scott: Oh you I read it numerous times.

793
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:05,626
Scott: I never read it.

794
00:52:05,746 --> 00:52:06,850
Scott: I thought it was worth it.

795
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:20,438
Rym: I don't think he thought his clever plan is the thing you read the Communist Manifesto and is basically blah blah blah the workers blah blah and Adam Smith is like Well, what if blah happens?

796
00:52:20,518 --> 00:52:22,145
Rym: I was like, ah, well we do this.

797
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:23,350
Rym: But what about blah?

798
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:32,685
Rym: well we do this and a lot of people point out the failings of capitalism and Scott and I have come to the opinion that those are not failings of capitalism.

799
00:52:32,926 --> 00:52:40,308
Rym: Those are failings of our Economic system because our Western economic system is not Adam Smith capitalism any stretch.

800
00:52:40,368 --> 00:52:40,910
Scott: that is correct.

801
00:52:41,011 --> 00:52:42,759
Scott: If you actually I don't read don't?

802
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,850
Scott: I don't suggest you read this book straight through because it.

803
00:52:46,435 --> 00:52:50,730
Scott: But take this book and hasn't the printing I have which is like this golden paperback, right?

804
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,256
Scott: I mean at the cover that it's gold.

805
00:52:52,296 --> 00:52:52,999
Scott: It looks golden.

806
00:52:53,019 --> 00:53:01,350
Scott: I don't know who publishes it, but it's it's like The table of contents in the front and the index in the back.

807
00:53:01,831 --> 00:53:02,173
Scott: Pretty much.

808
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:09,195
Scott: if anyone makes any comment about economics whatsoever using that index you can find Exactly what they're talking about.

809
00:53:09,236 --> 00:53:12,926
Scott: look it up in the book and there's your answer and it makes perfect sense.

810
00:53:12,986 --> 00:53:22,830
Rym: every time for example We were arguing about a minimum wage I'm not gonna say which side either one of us wrong because it doesn't matter but we disagreed and Other people weren't sure with this big argument.

811
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:28,967
Rym: so finally We're like Let's just see what Adam Smith said and we'll agree that that's probably the way we should go.

812
00:53:29,048 --> 00:53:37,344
Scott: and we were like Oh, there's a whole section on that and the whole chapter I think it's chapter four or seven called the wages of labor.

813
00:53:37,705 --> 00:53:39,010
Scott: That is the best chapter.

814
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:44,058
Scott: Everyone should be that are you are a laborer or will be?

815
00:53:44,459 --> 00:53:57,109
Rym: to summarize Adam Smith's position was basically that if a job is not worth being paid a living wage for then the job is not worth doing because if it's Necessary someone is eventually going to be willing to pay a living wage for it.

816
00:53:57,772 --> 00:54:03,950
Rym: And there I mean, I think there could be modern exceptions because now we have the idea of part-time work and that sort of thing.

817
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:04,191
Rym: But

818
00:54:04,954 --> 00:54:06,460
Scott: I'm gonna have to look up part-time work now,

819
00:54:06,761 --> 00:54:14,741
Rym: but on average I feel like yeah if a job is that necessary then a Basic living wage should be provided the

820
00:54:14,782 --> 00:54:15,746
Scott: job takes all day to do

821
00:54:15,967 --> 00:54:20,088
Rym: or else the job Obviously wasn't as important as you think it is.

822
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:26,142
Rym: Yep But yeah, you can if nothing else if you argue about economics But you probably do.

823
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:30,493
Scott: if you're on the internet You would better have a copy of Adam Smith's wealth of nations And the thing is.

824
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:34,370
Scott: the thing that I think is most important about this book is that you learn in school like laissez-faire.

825
00:54:34,511 --> 00:54:40,950
Scott: Adam Smith wanted everyone to leave economics alone and let it do what it wanted And that's true to a certain extent.

826
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:54,887
Scott: But if you actually read the book you'll find that many of the typical say libertarian laissez-faire stances and economics Disagree with Adam Smith quite a bit and you will find that Adam Smith thought his clever plan through and he knows.

827
00:54:55,068 --> 00:54:55,870
Scott: he knows the business.

828
00:54:55,950 --> 00:55:06,158
Scott: I mean he wrote this book ages ago, but he was a big businessman in a time when the world was crazy business and He wrote a gigantic book.

829
00:55:06,218 --> 00:55:09,850
Scott: that is available now and you should not deny yourself access to this book.

830
00:55:10,412 --> 00:55:11,015
Rym: It's very.

831
00:55:11,055 --> 00:55:12,963
Scott: maybe you can get it for free on like project Gutenberg.

832
00:55:13,004 --> 00:55:14,390
Rym: It's very to the point.

833
00:55:15,133 --> 00:55:19,050
Scott: It is very to the point but also, you know, he's kind of snarky in some points.

834
00:55:19,311 --> 00:55:19,792
Scott: It's not.

835
00:55:20,274 --> 00:55:23,564
Scott: it's not like, you know, this this, you know, like boring reference book.

836
00:55:23,664 --> 00:55:25,510
Rym: It's not like reading translations of Greek.

837
00:55:25,811 --> 00:55:26,796
Scott: No, it's very.

838
00:55:26,816 --> 00:55:28,604
Scott: I mean he wrote he was he spoke English.

839
00:55:28,684 --> 00:55:31,355
Scott: It was it was not that old You know is an English book.

840
00:55:31,937 --> 00:55:32,660
Scott: It was in English.

841
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,286
Scott: You could understand what he's talking about.

842
00:55:34,326 --> 00:55:35,370
Scott: It's not a translation.

843
00:55:35,894 --> 00:55:38,110
Scott: It's very well footnoted all over the place.

844
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:49,329
Scott: You know everything, you know, sometimes it's a read a little slowly because it is, you know it's not old English in the in the literal sense, but it is ye old English in the jovial sense and You should only copy this book.

845
00:55:50,211 --> 00:55:51,113
Scott: It's worth owning.

846
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:56,330
Rym: So this is something cuz you know, I've been on my 12 Byzantine emperors.

847
00:55:58,191 --> 00:55:59,175
Rym: Now what do you what?

848
00:55:59,195 --> 00:56:00,800
Rym: what book do you think I'm gonna bring up?

849
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:06,869
Rym: because I'm not gonna say the rock decline and follow the Roman Empire one of those penguins classics that ends in Clees.

850
00:56:08,151 --> 00:56:11,130
Rym: Actually, no, I'm gonna talk a little bit about Plutarch's Roman lives.

851
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:19,012
Rym: Okay, because I picked this up kind of on a lark and I've been reading it and I've always liked reading like whenever I read About history.

852
00:56:19,032 --> 00:56:32,790
Rym: I just I adore primary sources like reading a historical work written by a Roman about the ancient Egyptians is just fascinating to me on many levels, especially if it's annotated.

853
00:56:33,151 --> 00:56:39,390
Rym: So I get the modern translator saying things like well, he was mistaken here because of blah or he obviously made this up.

854
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:57,972
Rym: But I recently picked up Plutarch and Plutarch lived in you know, like 50 60 100 sometime ad like kind of when the Roman Empire was doing pretty well and he wrote about Roman and Greek history and he was a historian and a writer and One of the.

855
00:56:58,475 --> 00:57:15,866
Rym: the thing he's most known for are his parallel lives or his lives where he would basically Look find the history and write a story of a person who may or may not have been fictional but it's generally like He'll pick like a figure in Roman or Greek history and just kind of give an account of their life from the perspective of the Roman people or the Greek people.

856
00:57:15,886 --> 00:57:27,417
Rym: and All I have to say is that reading primary sources about the Romans by the Romans gives you of and the Greeks gives you a very Interesting perspective on the Romans.

857
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:44,197
Rym: and I'm more and more and it's not just from Plutarch It's from other sources get the impression that before Rome was a large Empire and when they were just one struggling state amidst many in Italy the Romans were kind of funny and Overly to quote their neighbors

858
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:45,060
Scott: overly

859
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,050
Rym: obsessed with democracy and a sense of civic duty.

860
00:57:48,910 --> 00:58:12,470
Rym: And they were kind of I don't know that the politics of Rome were very funny like a lot of times there would be disputes between the gentry and the peasants or the laborers or that's like the people living in apartments in the city and the people of the city would say fuck this and just kind of march out of the city and basically say all right you guys Are on your own and just march out to this hill and then the the patricians would have to like ride out to the hill.

861
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:18,398
Rym: Please come back to the city will forgive your debt and enact like judicial and social reform.

862
00:58:18,698 --> 00:58:20,000
Rym: and they'd be like, I don't know.

863
00:58:21,913 --> 00:58:24,747
Rym: The Romans were just very funny and a lot of.

864
00:58:25,028 --> 00:58:45,269
Rym: I guess it's very easy reading history to forget that the people living in Rome or Persia or Germany or any place where there's kind of a historical thing going on especially ancient history To forget that the actual people who are living then we're not much different from us now and they had the same problems and they argued about the same things.

865
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:53,859
Rym: and Caesar went to war on dubious pretexts despite the wishes of the Senate and then came back and used that glory for political gain.

866
00:58:53,899 --> 00:59:01,709
Rym: and the people were rallying against this like stupid and costly and wasteful war in a foreign land against people who were generally innocent.

867
00:59:01,729 --> 00:59:10,768
Rym: and There's this the people in ancient Rome in ancient Greece were not that different from us and Often had the same kind of stupid problems that we have now.

868
00:59:11,772 --> 00:59:12,415
Scott: Is that I gotta say?

869
00:59:12,676 --> 00:59:16,350
Rym: the only other thing I have to say is that if you want to read history like this?

870
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:27,636
Rym: I generally recommend reading Latin or later Greek things because earlier Greek writings are often even translated Incredibly tedious to read.

871
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:35,530
Rym: good God do I like Xenophon's histories, but good God Can I not stay awake like and then so-and-so went off to so-and-so?

872
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:39,967
Rym: But many a thing happened when so-and-so went off to so-and-so because so and so said such as.

873
00:59:39,987 --> 00:59:42,424
Scott: I think that's why the 12 Byzantine Empire's gets it ever.

874
00:59:42,464 --> 00:59:49,650
Scott: his guy gets it So right because he takes the so and so he takes the boringness and he makes a you know The dramatic story out of it that it well.

875
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:54,050
Rym: I think what he does well too is he'll say things like very straight up like this happened.

876
00:59:54,551 --> 00:59:56,598
Rym: But unlike a lot of the primary sources.

877
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:04,182
Rym: He makes it obvious when you should be reading between the lines Like he lays it on thick like and of course what.

878
01:00:04,363 --> 01:00:06,730
Rym: what would be the obvious thing to do in such a situation?

879
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:08,501
Rym: Would be to do blah and it's like wow.

880
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:11,294
Rym: Yeah, sure, okay Go room.

881
01:00:11,535 --> 01:00:11,956
Scott: All right.

882
01:00:12,678 --> 01:00:12,979
Scott: You have any.

883
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,805
Scott: you want me to pull one out from under you here?

884
01:00:14,825 --> 01:00:17,300
Rym: Yeah, let's each do one more All right.

885
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:19,809
Scott: I'm gonna steal American gods by me.

886
01:00:21,474 --> 01:00:23,109
Rym: I was that I guess we'll end on that.

887
01:00:24,731 --> 01:00:26,258
Scott: Just yoink that I knew that was gonna work.

888
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:26,820
Rym: All right, fine.

889
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:27,342

Rym: American gods is fucking awesome.

891
01:00:28,688 --> 01:00:30,138
Rym: Neil Gaiman It's like my personal hero.

892
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:37,465
Rym: I find him a little bit sexy This but it's very British and very well, he's rugged and he's cute.

893
01:00:37,686 --> 01:00:38,167
Rym: What can I say?

894
01:00:38,188 --> 01:00:38,870
