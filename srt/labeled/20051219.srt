00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,640
Scott: It's Monday, December 19th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:23,319
Scott: Our podcast went for 80 minutes, so we kind of cut out the news bits and we went straight into part two of our continuing "What to Choose for a Computer" series.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,112
Scott: There.

4
00:00:34,262 --> 00:00:35,419
Rym: Alright, things of the day.

5
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:45,240
Rym: So this is an auction on eBay, and it's an auction for something that if I had money enough, I would have been bidding on this and I would have bid until I got it.

6
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:48,279
Scott: I have enough money, but it's still way too much.

7
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,779
Rym: I think it'd be worth it.

8
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,719
Rym: If I had this much disposable income, I'd be there.

9
00:00:52,740 --> 00:01:02,374
Rym: But Teller, of Penn & Teller fame, is auctioning off brunch with himself in his house with a mouse.

10
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:03,920
Scott: No mouse.

11
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,516
Rym: Well, no mouse.

12
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:11,079
Rym: But he'll cook you brunch, and you can hang out with him in his house all day and he'll show you all the neat, magic-y trick things he has in his house.

13
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:20,119
Rym: Like he has a table with a skeleton in it that screams, and he has a magic mirror wall, and just all this cool stuff, and you get to hang out with him.

14
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:20,878
Rym: Hear his voice.

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,000
Scott: We should auction off brunch at our house.

16
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:23,568
Rym: Yeah.

17
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,959
Rym: Maybe we'll get five bucks.

18
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:26,098
Scott: Dude.

19
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:26,452
Scott: Sweet.

20
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,920
Rym: Now, this auction is already at about $1,500, and I think it's gonna get a lot higher than that before this ends.

21
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,020
Scott: Well, I think there were so many seats, and they already auctioned off all the seats.

22
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:35,820
Rym: This is the last seat.

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,280
Scott: This is the last seat, so it's gonna go for a higher price than the previous seats.

24
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:48,051
Rym: But the reason they're doing this is the James Randi Educational Foundation is ramping up for the amazing meeting, which is this conference.

25
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:49,940
Rym: they do, and a lot of cool people are there.

26
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,160
Rym: The people from Penn and Teller are there, and James Randi is there, the Mythbusters are usually there, and a bunch of other really cool, famous, science-type people.

27
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:06,220
Rym: And this is a charity event, this brunch, and the money's gonna go right to the JREF, Sweet.

28
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,538
Rym: Except for $25 of it, which will go toward the food that Teller will cook you.

29
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,100
Scott: 'Cause Teller can't afford the food.

30
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:12,980
Rym: Yeah.

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,019
Scott: 'Cause, you know, he's so poor living in his mansion.

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,340
Rym: The funny thing is, you don't get to pick what he cooks.

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,479
Rym: He's gonna cook whatever he wants.

34
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,000
Scott: Hopefully he won't, like, bleed all over it, or something, with some magic blood.

35
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:25,239
Rym: I'm just curious what his voice sounds like.

36
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:26,740
Scott: I know what his voice sounds like.

37
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:27,465
Rym: I heard him go

38
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:28,130
Rym: "Ahh!"

39
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:29,440
Rym: once in the background or something.

40
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:33,080
Scott: You can go online and find out what he sounds like fairly easily.

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,098
Rym: Well, perhaps I shall do that.

42
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:36,770
Scott: Uh, you know, I'm not 100% sure of that, but I'm 99% sure of it.

43
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,039
Scott: So if you can't find it, then don't yell at me.

44
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:43,659
Rym: But you're the one who suggested it.

45
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,980
Scott: It's 'cause the internet has everything.

46
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,120
Scott: The odds of it not being there are much less than the odds of it being there.

47
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:48,450
Rym: Yeah.

48
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:49,419
Rym: So what do you got?

49
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,180
Scott: Well, you know Phoenix Wright, the awesome, awesome DS GBA lawyer game?

50
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,419
Rym: Yep, yep, yep.

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:04,740
Scott: Well, in that game, you're Phoenix Wright, this lawyer who has a fondness for objecting and then pointing dramatically.

52
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,580
Rym: Yeah, by dramatic, we mean hit the table, swing the arm around in the air, there's flashing lights, and then you point.

53
00:03:12,381 --> 00:03:13,039
Scott: And then he objects.

54
00:03:15,702 --> 00:03:25,180
Scott: So someone took that little animation out of the game and put it in Flash, and you can basically type text in a box and choose what Phoenix Wright says, and you can make him say anything.

55
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,098
Rym: So totally, every time I argue with anyone on the internet ever, Phoenix is gonna be backing me up.

56
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:44,619
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if you ever need a lawyer to say something, just type it in this box, click the button, send someone the link, they'll click on it, and they'll see Phoenix pointing at them dramatically and then saying whatever you want them to say.

57
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,220
Scott: Like, you are totally wrong.

58
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,839
Scott: See, look, someone agrees with me, a lawyer agrees with me.

59
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:57,640
Rym: Of course, the first four things you typed into it to show me your thing of the day were various obscenities and poop jokes.

60
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,163
Scott: Duh.

61
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:05,356
Scott: I mean, any person in the world would type that in first, I mean, what else would you type in?

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,999
Rym: Yeah, just like when the DS first came out.

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,460
Rym: I think the first thing 98% of males who had a DS type drew was a penis of some variety.

64
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:16,048
Scott: Don't lay off.

65
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,279
Scott: the females also drew peni.

66
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,178
Rym: Yeah, you know what, everyone drew peni.

67
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,319
Rym: Multiple webcomics make jokes about it.

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,800
Scott: You know, it used to be when I was in elementary school, drawing boobies was a thing.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,977
Scott: Now it's all drawing peni.

70
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,238
Rym: What's up with that?

71
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:38,420
Rym: In fact, just because I thought of it in the latest VGCats today, just a normal, funny VGCats comic, but there's a starscape, like in the background, and it shows one constellation.

72
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,619
Rym: And I'll give you one guess what that constellation was in the shape of.

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,860
Scott: Oh my God, a little barbecue.

74
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:55,479
Rym: So moving on, we started a series last Monday, actually we started it during last Monday's podcast when it came to our attention that this was a good idea.

75
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:59,320
Rym: A continuous series on how to buy or build a computer.

76
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:06,380
Scott: Yup, and some people didn't believe us, what we were saying last week, and how a $500 computer was sufficient.

77
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:08,440
Scott: And they're wrong.

78
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,934
Rym: Yeah, if you look in the forums, we made a $500 computer and a $1000 computer.

79
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:14,027
Scott: And a $3000 computer.

80
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:29,976
Rym: Yeah, I didn't actually post the $3000 computer because I didn't make it on Newegg, but let me tell you, a $3000 computer has dual processor, bad ass, like 4 gigs of registered ECC memory, and like more hard drive space than, oh my God.

81
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:38,440
Scott: Yeah, I made a computer that wasn't exactly $3000, I just went all out on it, like the ultimate, ultimate crazy computer.

82
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,840
Scott: And it was a little over $3000, but it's more than any, it's a computer that no human being needs basically.

83
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:47,932
Scott: And even the $1000 computer was excessive.

84
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,600
Scott: We're like talking insane, the best video card available.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,180
Rym: The $500 computer will play every game that is out now.

86
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,959
Scott: And games to come.

87
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:04,860
Scott: It won't play them perfectly with all the settings turned all the way up.

88
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,500
Rym: Well actually, a lot of them it will, just not Half Life 2.

89
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,737
Scott: Yeah, it'll play new games like Half Life 2 and I guess the new F.E.A.R.

90
00:06:12,777 --> 00:06:21,599
Scott: game and whatever other new PC games at the medium, normal quality with enough frames that you won't go, oh my frame rate is low.

91
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,598
Scott: So if you spend more than $500 for a computer, you better have some crazy use for it, like art.

92
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:34,580
Rym: Yeah, like our friend Kat was like, I need an expensive computer, because I do art.

93
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,099
Scott: Yeah, if you're doing art, you need computer, if you're doing 3D art, you need even more computer.

94
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:41,407
Rym: Yep.

95
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,200
Scott: If you're doing video editing, you need a lot of computer.

96
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,040
Rym: If you play Counter Strike, you don't need computer.

97
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,195
Scott: If you're playing Counter Strike, you need a $100 computer.

98
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:58,140
Rym: So, this being part two of our ongoing series, last time we talked about how to pick what kind of computer you need, or figure out your needs basically.

99
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,700
Rym: Now we're going to get into some of the more gritty details.

100
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:01,940
Rym: The components.

101
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,238
Rym: What is in a computer, and what do you need, why do you need it, and how do you pick a good one?

102
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:10,880
Scott: Well, the first and most important part is the motherboard.

103
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:11,820
Rym: The motherboard.

104
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:23,880
Scott: The motherboard is basically this big circuit board with a bunch of slots and plugs and holes in it, and it's basically, the purpose of the motherboard is to tie all the real parts of the computer together.

105
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,380
Rym: Everything in your computer plugs into the motherboard.

106
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,000
Rym: Every component of your computer communicates with other components through the motherboard.

107
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,560
Rym: The motherboard has thousands and thousands of circuits and things all over it.

108
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:34,850
Scott: Yep.

109
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:45,299
Scott: In a way, the motherboard is the defining piece of your computer, but in another way, it is none of your computer, as it doesn't really do so much, except let other things talk across it.

110
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,300
Rym: It's just the connective tissue, basically.

111
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:55,559
Scott: Yep, but what motherboard you choose is probably the most important choice, because different motherboards can allow different things to be put into them.

112
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,298
Scott: So you have to figure out what you want, and then you pick a motherboard that can hold what you want.

113
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:00,609
Rym: Yep.

114
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,578
Rym: Luckily, motherboard buying is a thousand times easier now than it was, not like four or five years ago even.

115
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,180
Scott: Oh god, it used to be a nightmare.

116
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,760
Rym: Because it used to be, it'd be like, no, you look online, you want a motherboard.

117
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,680
Rym: But every motherboard, because technology wasn't quite there yet, there were trade-offs.

118
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,180
Rym: Like oh, this one has four spots for memory, but it only has this many PCI slots.

119
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,940
Scott: Oh yeah, or it has, this one doesn't have ISA slots, this one does.

120
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,760
Scott: This one has extra USBs, this one doesn't.

121
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:34,059
Scott: This one has, you know, and like, in those days, onboard sound was, you know, it's like, do I really want it?

122
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,558
Scott: Do I not?

123
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:35,399
Scott: It's not as good.

124
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,460
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't as good.

125
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,058
Rym: It didn't work.

126
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,840
Rym: Like, onboard video, if you found it, was like the worst thing ever.

127
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,659
Scott: Onboard video used to be like a death sentence.

128
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,500
Scott: It was, it was a nightmare.

129
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,440
Scott: Nowadays, it's much, much better.

130
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,579
Scott: Every motherboard that I looked at recently when pricing out computers has been more than what I've wanted.

131
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,080
Scott: I haven't found a single insufficient motherboard.

132
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:55,679
Rym: Also, the quality has gone up.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,500
Rym: It used to be that if you bought a cheap off-brand motherboard, odds were it just didn't work.

134
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,090
Scott: Yep.

135
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,377
Rym: Not like it was slow, but like literally, your computer wouldn't boot, and you were fucked.

136
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:11,619
Scott: Yeah, and like, the expensive motherboards were the only ones that actually supported all the features of things.

137
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:18,279
Scott: Like, you couldn't get a motherboard that like, let your CPU go as fast as it could go unless you bought the really, really fancy new ones.

138
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:21,600
Scott: It really wasn't good in the olden days.

139
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:21,952
Rym: Yep.

140
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:31,120
Rym: And also, a lot of, there were a lot of undocumented random, like, if you happen to use this processor and this memory on this motherboard, you can't boot.

141
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:32,279
Scott: Yep.

142
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:33,459
Rym: All that's gone.

143
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,980
Rym: Any motherboard that you can buy on Newegg will probably work just fine.

144
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:43,758
Scott: And as long as you fill it with the correct amount of parts, and the parts fit, it's 99.9% guaranteed to work.

145
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,820
Scott: There's actually, I think, I can only think of one case in which that won't happen, and it's not, don't, it's nothing anyone should worry about.

146
00:09:51,681 --> 00:10:00,818
Rym: So basically, I guess we'll get back to the motherboard periodically throughout this, because once again, the motherboard decides what you can buy, or what you buy decides what motherboard you need.

147
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:07,839
Rym: But the main things to say are that, one, you probably want, most motherboards that are worth a crap now have a sound card built into them.

148
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,532
Scott: Yep.

149
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,497
Rym: That's all you need.

150
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,240
Rym: It is pretty much useless to buy a sound card.

151
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,320
Rym: Sound cards are no longer an item that you need to purchase for a computer.

152
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:25,673
Scott: Back in the day, a sound card used to be like, if you didn't have one that went in a PCI slot or an ISA slot, the one that was built into the motherboard was like some piece of crap.

153
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:33,260
Scott: Or if you bought, like, a Packard Bell computer, you would get a sound card and a modem and a video card all built into one card, and it was a piece of crap.

154
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:43,380
Scott: And nowadays, the sound cards that are built into motherboards are about as good as sound cards get, and they're not, one that's put into a PCI slot is no better.

155
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:53,840
Scott: You can only really get better if you buy a crazy professional sound card that's like external to the computer, and you only need that if you're, like, an audio professional.

156
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:54,716
Rym: Yeah.

157
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:59,059
Rym: I mean, I'm actually thinking of getting a nice external Yamaha for doing this stuff.

158
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,240
Rym: For a number of reasons that I won't get into, because you don't care about it, but if you're doing any sort of professional audio, you need a real sound card.

159
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,280
Scott: But if you're just a gamer, or a normal PC user- Sound blasters give you nothing.

160
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,260
Rym: They take your money, they give you nothing in return.

161
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Scott: Yeah, don't buy an Audigy, don't buy anything.

162
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:26,139
Scott: The one that's built into any of the motherboards that we'll tell you to buy, or pretty much any motherboard you buy these days that's a new, modern motherboard with built-in sound, will let you do surround sound with nothing.

163
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:26,934
Scott: Yep.

164
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,614
Scott: And it doesn't cost you any extra money.

165
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,036
Rym: If you buy one of those, it'll probably just have a driver and you won't even need to bother with it.

166
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,919
Scott: Yeah, it'll just work.

167
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,240
Scott: Ding!

168
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,200
Scott: Oh, look, you have surround sound and it works perfectly.

169
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,400
Rym: I mean, it used to be the conventional wisdom was, buy a sound blaster.

170
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:41,640
Rym: It's the standard, and it's the best, and it's the only way.

171
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,680
Rym: But now, sound blaster is just audio file- not even audio file, it's just rubbish.

172
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:46,379
Scott: Yep.

173
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Rym: They're just trying to take your money.

174
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,590
Rym: Now, the other thing that will be on your motherboard is a network card.

175
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:53,488
Scott: Yep.

176
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,450
Rym: You don't need to buy a network card anymore.

177
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,870
Rym: Any motherboard that's worth a dollar or more has a network card built into it, it'll work fine.

178
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:02,929
Scott: There are even some motherboards that have two network cards built in.

179
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:04,830
Scott: If you need two network cards, go for it.

180
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:12,325
Scott: If not, it couldn't hurt, but you're probably- if a motherboard has two network cards and you're not someone who needs two, that might be a motherboard.

181
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,170
Scott: that's too much for you.

182
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,489
Rym: Yeah, we don't want to sound conceited, but if you can't think of a reason to have two network cards, you don't need two network cards.

183
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:24,910
Scott: Yeah, and if you do really need a whole bunch more network cards, you're probably just gonna fill your PCI slots with like, quadruple NICs and stuff.

184
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:25,219
Scott: Yeah.

185
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:36,770
Scott: So, but every- your motherboard should have a network card, and if possible, get one that supports gigabit ethernet, because while you probably won't use it now, they're pretty easy to get motherboards with gigabit ethernet on them.

186
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,909
Rym: They generally don't cost anymore.

187
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,890
Scott: It doesn't cost anymore, and it will help you in the future, for sure.

188
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:46,579
Rym: Now, motherboard needs a processor in it.

189
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:49,160
Rym: You can't boot anything without a processor.

190
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,300
Scott: The processor is probably the most important part of the computer, in fact, it is the computer.

191
00:12:54,663 --> 00:12:56,879
Rym: It's also probably your easiest choice.

192
00:12:57,288 --> 00:12:57,413
Rym: Yep.

193
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:59,299
Rym: One, buy an AMD.

194
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,800
Scott: Yeah, I don't- I- I can't tell you to buy an Intel and keep a straight face.

195
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:16,200
Rym: I mean, they're not- they're not bad chips, my Intel chips are very fast and very good, but they cost upwards of four times more, and they're not better.

196
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:27,620
Scott: Yeah, it's like, an AMD that costs a hundred bucks, the same- an Intel chip that is the same power will cost four times more dollars.

197
00:13:28,863 --> 00:13:30,020
Scott: Why would you buy the Intel?

198
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,840
Scott: There's no reason.

199
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:36,400
Rym: See, 'cause a lot of people have this impression, because it was true, you know, seven years ago, that Intel chips were better.

200
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:38,240
Scott: Because they were fighting against Cyrix.

201
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,879
Rym: I mean, back in the day, there were Cyrix chips, which, if you've ever heard of Cyrix, you probably had it associated with bad things.

202
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,180
Rym: Cyrix is like the worst chip in the world.

203
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,580
Scott: I think they still make chips, but I don't think they make normal PC chips anymore.

204
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:58,940
Rym: Yeah, but then, you know, AMD had the K6-3 and all that, and back then, Intel chips were significantly better, cooler, and faster.

205
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:09,320
Scott: I had a Pentium 3 back when the K6-2 was the only other option, but then when the K7, AKA the original Athlon came out, that was the beginning of the end for Intel.

206
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:16,800
Rym: I mean, it started out, Athlons, basically, they weren't as efficient as Intel chips, but they made up for it with raw horsepower.

207
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:23,880
Rym: Now the tables have turned, and the AMD chips have more raw horsepower and are more optimized in most cases.

208
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:41,638
Scott: Yeah, and especially now, AMD has won the 64-bit war, and while at this very moment in time, no one really needs a 64-bit processor, and like, hardly anyone actually has the 64-bit version of Windows, Linux, if you set it up right, will take advantage of your 64-bitness.

209
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:53,800
Scott: But if you're going to buy a computer today, 64-bit is backwards compatible with the old 32-bit, and in the future, it's going to help you out a lot as people start writing programs that take advantage.

210
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,300
Scott: So you can't not get 64-bits unless you're really, really poor.

211
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,960
Rym: And even then, I mean, 64-bit chips are not significantly more expensive.

212
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:11,740
Scott: You can get the low-end 64-bit chips for the same price as the high-end 32-bit chips, which is almost nothing these days, relatively.

213
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,640
Rym: Now there's one more complication here, and well, there's two more, really.

214
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:18,380
Rym: One, there's dual processors, or multiple processors.

215
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:19,797
Rym: You don't need it.

216
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,380
Rym: I'm telling you, right now, you do not need more than one processor.

217
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,400
Scott: You might, if you're crazy, get a dual-core processor.

218
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,700
Rym: That's the other complication.

219
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,295
Rym: Yep.

220
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:37,100
Rym: A dual-core processor basically has two processor cores, which is essentially two processors, on the same chip, the same processor.

221
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,658
Scott: So it's only one.

222
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,980
Scott: To you, it looks like there's one thing that you stick in your motherboard, but really, it's two in there.

223
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,674
Rym: But while there's two in there, they share the same memory bandwidth going out to the rest of the PC.

224
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,515
Rym: Yep.

225
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,940
Rym: Which, there's more detail.

226
00:15:52,180 --> 00:16:07,800
Rym: I mean, basically, we can't explain that without getting into very technical details, but suffice to say, just think of it this way, you know people who don't know about computers, they say the computer, and they point at their monitor, they say the PC, and they point at the whole thing, or the processor, they point at the whole thing?

227
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,220
Scott: Or they say the hard drive, and they point at the whole thing?

228
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:11,919
Rym: That's what a processor's like.

229
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:23,639
Rym: What you think of as a processor, you know, that thing you stick in your computer, is actually a core, which does all the processing, and a whole bunch of registers, and memory, and caches, and all this stuff.

230
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,900
Scott: There's a bunch of bunch of tiny stuff all crammed in there.

231
00:16:27,268 --> 00:16:27,699
Scott: It's crazy.

232
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:35,160
Rym: But again, if you don't know about that, and you don't care about that, dual-core isn't going to help you that much either, and the dual-cores are actually fairly expensive.

233
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:35,900
Scott: Yep.

234
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:40,180
Scott: And, let's see, the other thing you have to worry about when buying a processor is the socket.

235
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,160
Rym: Yep.

236
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,060
Rym: But luckily, it's fairly simple.

237
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:50,820
Rym: A socket will have a letter and a number, or sometimes just a number, but they're all unique, and you can't put the wrong thing into the wrong hole ever.

238
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,860
Scott: You just don't get it.

239
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:58,457
Scott: If by some miracle you buy a processor that won't fit in your motherboard, you just won't be able to put it in.

240
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,159
Scott: You'll know if you can put it in, because it'll just drop right in, like, easily.

241
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,838
Rym: Well, I take that back, there are exceptions to that, but you won't run into them because they're all old.

242
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,152
Rym: Real old.

243
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:08,858
Rym: Real old.

244
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:15,441
Scott: So basically, the choices for AMD these days are socket 754, and socket 939.

245
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:16,959
Scott: There's a 940, but don't worry about it.

246
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,098
Rym: Yeah, 939 and 940 are essentially the same, other than some differences.

247
00:17:21,137 --> 00:17:22,138
Rym: that, again, you don't care about.

248
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:22,931
Scott: 940 is for servers.

249
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,660
Scott: You don't need 940.

250
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,640
Rym: Yeah, that's multiple processor gobbledygook.

251
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:51,800
Scott: Yeah, so if you choose the 754, which is good if you're going for a bargain, you can use the Athlon 64s, and I think some of the Semprons, and basically the lower half of the 64-bit line of chips will work in it, and all the newer chips are being made for 939, including the dual-core ones, and all the others.

252
00:17:52,500 --> 00:18:02,100
Scott: So it doesn't really matter which one you get, you know, if you're not going for, like, the crazy high-end chips, because you'll be able to get a chip in the range you want.

253
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,656
Scott: You know, the best chip that anyone needs, you can get one for the 754 socket.

254
00:18:08,262 --> 00:18:12,858
Rym: But if you're thinking forward compatibility, 939, you'll have a more upgradeable system in the long run.

255
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,120
Scott: Yeah, definitely 939 if you're not even more worried about power than money.

256
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:28,200
Scott: 750, if you're looking for the save, the save the money, 754 is your really only choice, because the 939 only takes more expensive processors in it.

257
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,359
Rym: Now basically, here we get to the point of, how do you pick how fast a processor you need?

258
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:39,180
Rym: Because honestly, buying the fastest processor you can afford is usually not the best option.

259
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,440
Scott: Well I'll tell you what I do, is, there's two things I do.

260
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,340
Scott: First, I look at benchmark charts on websites.

261
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:56,460
Scott: Now, while benchmarks have all sorts of problems with them, and you know, and that, "Oh, someone rigged them, the system's not the same, it's under ideal conditions, not real working conditions, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah," right?

262
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:57,660
Scott: They have a graph.

263
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,100
Scott: Now I don't look at the numbers in the graph, I look at the curve of the graph.

264
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:15,960
Scott: And where I tend to look is, you notice most of the graphs, when there's benchmarks, are sort of these exponential things, where, towards the bottom where the slower processors are, you're only getting tiny increases in power as you go up to the next chip.

265
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Scott: But when you get to the really high up chips, you're getting these huge jumps in powers.

266
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:28,220
Scott: Like the difference between the most powerful chip and the second most powerful chip is a lot bigger than the difference between the slowest chip and the second slowest chip.

267
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,436
Rym: Usually though, I mean, those graphs look different depending on what generation of chips you were in.

268
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:33,257
Scott: Oh yeah, of course.

269
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,119
Rym: Because notice we're not talking about specific chips so much here.

270
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:38,880
Rym: Because really, that won't help you.

271
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,900
Rym: If you buy a computer a month from now, it'll be different.

272
00:19:41,204 --> 00:19:42,540
Scott: Yeah, it changes pretty much daily.

273
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:51,057
Scott: There's so many different cores and megahertzes and numbers and things, it's just not helpful to try and say, "This is which one you

274
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:51,319
Scott: need.".

275
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:56,579
Rym: So just keep in mind, we're not telling you what to buy, we're telling you how to figure out for yourself what to buy.

276
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:56,872
Rym: Right.

277
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:05,899
Scott: So what I do is I look at that graph, and I try to see which numbered chips are at the point where the exponential increase is about to start.

278
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:14,320
Scott: Right in between the part where there's no real increases and the part where it goes crazy, right before it goes crazy, I look at that number.

279
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:23,619
Scott: Then I go back and I see what the prices are on those chips with numbers close to the number that was on the point in the graph.

280
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,959
Scott: And you'll notice that the price tends to do the same thing.

281
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,158
Scott: There's really not much of a price difference between the slow chip and the slightly faster slow chip.

282
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:33,860
Scott: There's like maybe a few bucks difference.

283
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:41,860
Scott: But as you get towards the part where the power is about to exponentially increase, you'll see the price will exponentially increase.

284
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:52,602
Scott: It'll be like $98, $110, $130, $200, $300, $500, $1,000.

285
00:20:52,602 --> 00:21:04,978
Scott: I try to get the chip that's right before the price goes crazy, because you don't have to pay that much more than the slower chip, and it's not that much slower than a chip that's crazy more expensive than it.

286
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:12,580
Rym: And then six months down the road, but what I've always done, I use a slightly similar strategy, but I do it based on price solely.

287
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:22,732
Rym: I buy pretty much the middle of the road chip that'll do everything I need it to do, or I buy the fastest one that I can afford or that I feel like I should spend the money on.

288
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:24,519
Rym: But that's because I use my processor.

289
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,880
Rym: We'll get into how much processor you actually need in a minute.

290
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:36,240
Rym: And then six months later, I buy the fastest chip, like the end of line chip, the last chip that'll fit in whatever socket I have in my motherboard when it gets cheap.

291
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:42,940
Scott: Yeah, like I had a Socket-A motherboard back in the, I have one now actually, but they no longer really, Socket-A is going out of style.

292
00:21:43,562 --> 00:21:44,851
Scott: But it has an XP-2500 in it.

293
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:48,815
Scott: The fastest chip that can go in there is an XP-3200.

294
00:21:49,981 --> 00:21:53,957
Scott: That will never change because they're not making any more Socket-A chips really these days.

295
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:03,819
Rym: So you can always buy the maximal end of life chip for a motherboard, and then now you'll pretty much make that computer the best it could ever have been whenever you upgrade to the next computer on the road.

296
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:10,720
Scott: Yup, so now in maybe a few months, I'll buy the XP-3200 and replace the 2500.

297
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,619
Scott: And the XP-3200 will cost me almost nothing because no one wants that chip anymore, it's a dead chip.

298
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:14,989
Rym: Yup.

299
00:22:16,221 --> 00:22:37,800
Scott: Now, to figure out how much CPU you're using, well, if you're not doing something that's CPU intensive, like encoding video, or editing WAV or video files, or rendering 3D graphics, or compiling code, or pretty much any of those things, you don't really need a powerful CPU.

300
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,167
Rym: I mean, you play games, your video card and your RAM are most of the performance in a game.

301
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:50,900
Scott: Yeah, when you're playing a game, the CPU is important because if it's too slow, it'll hold back your video card and your RAM.

302
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,100
Scott: Like, let's say your video card is wicked fast, and your CPU is wicked slow.

303
00:22:56,781 --> 00:23:01,179
Scott: Your video card will be doing all the work faster than the CPU sends it new work to do.

304
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,980
Scott: But let's say your CPU is wicked fast, so much faster than your video card.

305
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:13,279
Scott: It'll send the video card work at the rate at which the video card can do work, and then...

306
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,879
Rym: All that extra speed is lost.

307
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:15,819
Scott: It does nothing.

308
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,900
Scott: All that extra CPU power that you have doesn't do anything for your game.

309
00:23:20,262 --> 00:23:21,139
Scott: It's basically lost.

310
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,940
Rym: Because having more RAM can always help out with caching.

311
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:27,996
Rym: Having more processor beyond what you use is absolutely 100% useless.

312
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:44,400
Scott: So you just want to figure out, you know, how powerful is your video card, get a chip that has the full front side bus speed of your motherboard, and is as fast as you're willing to pay for, and you probably won't cause a bottleneck in your CPU.

313
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,017
Rym: Now, if you don't know what front side bus or anything we just said are, there's a simpler approach.

314
00:23:50,702 --> 00:23:58,259
Rym: Simply figure out how much you're willing to spend, and buy the best processor you can reasonably accept.

315
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:58,995
Scott: Yep.

316
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:07,572
Scott: And if after you add all your other components, or add all your other components first and do the CPU last, and say, "Alright, I'm $200 below my budget," get a $200 CPU.

317
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:28,740
Rym: Because honestly, if there's a $200 difference between the CPU you're looking at and the is better spent buying a bunch of RAM, or an awesome video card, because processors are very easily upgraded.

318
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:30,600
Rym: It's trivial.

319
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:32,599
Scott: Alright.

320
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:37,280
Scott: After the CPU, the next most important part is the RAM.

321
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,880
Rym: RAM is probably, in terms of performance, the most important thing.

322
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:45,740
Rym: Basically, as much RAM as you can cram in there is always better.

323
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,580
Scott: Well, to a point.

324
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,839
Scott: And it depends if you're running Windows or Linux a lot too.

325
00:24:49,982 --> 00:24:50,275
Rym: Well, yeah.

326
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:58,780
Rym: But basically, with consumer motherboards, the kind of motherboards you're looking at, you'll max out the RAM on the motherboard before you'll hit the point of having more RAM is useless.

327
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,160
Scott: Well, let's talk about what RAM does for a second.

328
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,040
Scott: RAM, whenever you're doing something on your computer, it's in the RAM.

329
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:14,640
Scott: RAM is like, if you think of your brain as a computer, the RAM is where whatever you're thinking about right now is stored.

330
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:22,620
Scott: So if you want to think about more things at once, or if you want to think about a really big thing, then you're going to need a lot of RAM.

331
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:28,000
Rym: Like, we had some people who were talking about how they want a computer that will multitask well, so they need a fast processor.

332
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:29,340
Rym: Nope, that's not true.

333
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,259
Rym: You need a lot of RAM.

334
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,240
Rym: The fast processor doesn't matter so much.

335
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:32,609
Scott: Yep.

336
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,385
Scott: Now, you know how.

337
00:25:34,626 --> 00:25:39,379
Scott: sometimes if you're playing like a game, a game is something big to think about, if it's a new game.

338
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:41,059
Scott: It takes up a lot of RAM.

339
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:45,320
Scott: And you want to switch from using that game to, say, your web browser.

340
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:53,300
Scott: If you don't have a lot of RAM, then what your computer does is when it's out of RAM, it uses the hard drive, which we'll talk about, which is much slower than RAM.

341
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,920
Rym: Like orders of magnitude, multiple orders of magnitude slower.

342
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:06,020
Scott: Yeah, if you have a computer right now that's old, and while you're using it, it starts ticking like crazy, like, that means you don't have enough RAM.

343
00:26:06,642 --> 00:26:07,799
Scott: And that's very, very bad.

344
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,860
Scott: And if you put more RAM in that computer, it will improve the performance crazily.

345
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,780
Scott: Like insane increases in speed.

346
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:24,038
Rym: Like, I had a 486 back in the day with 4 megabytes of RAM, and one day, for $190, I bought another 4 megabyte chip and stuck it in.

347
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:25,758
Rym: It was like night and day.

348
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,420
Rym: The computer became a screaming beast.

349
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,308
Scott: Mm-hmm.

350
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:34,840
Scott: So, you gotta have enough RAM to do whatever the computer's thinking about.

351
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,160
Scott: Now, if you use Windows, you're gonna need more than if you use Linux.

352
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,220
Rym: Quite literally, almost double.

353
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,057
Rym: Probably you need about 50% more RAM if you have a Windows machine.

354
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:48,420
Scott: You need 100% more RAM if you're running Windows.

355
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:57,419
Scott: But, basically, with Windows, 512 megabytes of RAM is the minimum for doing anything.

356
00:26:58,341 --> 00:26:58,877
Scott: Anything at all.

357
00:26:58,877 --> 00:27:00,660
Scott: 256, it'll be a nightmare.

358
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,520
Scott: Windows itself will take up the entire 256 megabytes of RAM, and that'll be the end of that.

359
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:12,120
Scott: 512 will let you run Windows and a few programs, or play one game at a time.

360
00:27:12,683 --> 00:27:15,861
Scott: You know, you can close everything and play a game with 512.

361
00:27:15,861 --> 00:27:20,078
Scott: I have 512, but I run Linux, and I bought my computer a while ago when 512 was awesome.

362
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,960
Scott: In Windows, I gotta recommend 1 gigabyte at the minimum.

363
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:34,200
Scott: 'Cause with 1 gigabyte, you can play a game, watch a video, and run Gaim and your web browser all at the same time, and it'll be alright.

364
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:36,860
Scott: It won't be monstrous, but you'll be alright.

365
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:37,270
Rym: Yep.

366
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:45,720
Rym: Now, for Linux, I'd recommend 1 gigabyte because, honestly, the price of another gigabyte is almost trivial compared to the benefit of having extra RAM.

367
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:46,520
Scott: Yeah.

368
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:53,300
Scott: I mean, 512 and Linux will pretty much do anything you need to do if you're using a good Linux, you know, configured properly.

369
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,677
Scott: But, to have a gig instead of 512 is just not that much more money, and it will help you.

370
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,540
Rym: I mean, like, we talked about processors earlier, and the price curve is exponential.

371
00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:07,220
Rym: Every jump increases in price more than the previous increase.

372
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,900
Rym: Unless you want an insane amount of RAM, RAM prices are linear.

373
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,740
Rym: 1 gig, 2 gig, 3 gig, 4 gig, each gig costs the same amount as the previous gig.

374
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,632
Scott: 'Cause you're buying a number of chips, and the price of one chip is the price of that chip.

375
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,400
Scott: To buy four of them costs, you know, they don't get more expensive when you buy more.

376
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,740
Rym: Now, you really, I mean, I said no amount of RAM is too much, go all out.

377
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,580
Rym: 4 gigabytes of RAM is ludicrous.

378
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,060
Scott: Yeah, and remember, you gotta look at how much RAM your motherboard can hold.

379
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,754
Scott: Some motherboards only have two slots, and you generally don't want to buy sticks that are bigger than 1 gig.

380
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,200
Rym: Just because they're expensive.

381
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:53,340
Scott: Yeah, any stick, a single stick of RAM that has more than 1 gig of RAM memory on it, is really kind of dumb to buy at this point in time.

382
00:28:54,461 --> 00:29:03,438
Scott: And, you know, if you have a two-slot motherboard, it'll probably say in the motherboard specification "max RAM 2 gigs, max RAM maybe 3

383
00:29:03,438 --> 00:29:03,720
Scott: gigs.".

384
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,479
Scott: Maybe it can take one and a half gig sticks, but you don't want to buy those.

385
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:08,620
Scott: Unless they become cheap someday.

386
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,037
Rym: Yep, now luckily most motherboards you'll look at will have three or four dim slots for RAM.

387
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:20,619
Scott: I would recommend buying a motherboard with four slots, because that way, even if you only use two of the slots or one of the slots right now...

388
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,379
Rym: It's so easy to upgrade RAM.

389
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,699
Scott: Yeah, in the future, if something happens, you can just buy more RAM and stick it in those slots and you're good to go.

390
00:29:27,944 --> 00:29:28,379
Scott: And it's cheap.

391
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:32,560
Rym: And when you install new RAM, like say you upgrade later, you don't have to do anything.

392
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Rym: Your computer just knows.

393
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,698
Scott: You literally just turn your computer off, put the chips in the slots, then turn your computer back on.

394
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,009
Scott: And that's it.

395
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,980
Rym: Now, there are actually problems with Windows.

396
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,793
Rym: I forget the exact limit because I stopped using Windows, but I run into this a lot at work.

397
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:54,620
Rym: I think it's two gigabytes, but if you want more than two or so gigabytes of RAM in Windows, you actually have to flip something in the registry or it won't do anything.

398
00:29:55,522 --> 00:29:59,960
Scott: In Linux, I think that's a problem too, but it's only if you have more than four gigs of RAM, there's something in the kernel.

399
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:05,020
Scott: But only if you're using Linux or you have to manually configure your kernel, will that be a problem.

400
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:05,451
Rym: Yeah.

401
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,260
Scott: Like Gen 2.

402
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,740
Rym: Now, there are a million, million different kinds of RAM.

403
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,319
Rym: You know, different PC numbers and CAS latency numbers and all these numbers that you really probably don't want to learn about.

404
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:15,700
Scott: Yep.

405
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,659
Rym: They're good to learn about, but you don't need to.

406
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,940
Rym: Basically, you're going to pick your motherboard.

407
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,060
Rym: Whatever your motherboard says it takes, buy that.

408
00:30:23,361 --> 00:30:27,249
Scott: Yeah, if your motherboard says it takes 168-pin DDR400 DIMMs, get 168-pin DDR400 DIMMs.

409
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,680
Rym: And read the manual or read the specs on your motherboard.

410
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:42,280
Rym: Some motherboards will say things like you can have up to one gigabyte of unregistered or two gigabytes of registered.

411
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:42,918
Scott: Yep.

412
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:44,619
Rym: Make sure you pay attention to that.

413
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,018
Scott: Do whatever it says.

414
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,437
Scott: Don't get, you know, they sell this RAM, I see, in places like DDR600 RAM.

415
00:30:53,361 --> 00:30:55,294
Scott: I've never seen a motherboard that takes DDR600 RAM.

416
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,620
Scott: That's really only for crazy, overclock, game nuts who think they're getting something.

417
00:31:01,281 --> 00:31:05,580
Scott: Or maybe a potential future computer that might go that fast.

418
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:07,059
Scott: It's just silly.

419
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,780
Scott: Whatever your motherboard says, buy that and buy the right number of gigs.

420
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,372
Rym: Yep.

421
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,000
Rym: And don't, like, never think that you can outsmart the motherboard.

422
00:31:14,162 --> 00:31:14,558
Rym: It knows.

423
00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:16,040
Scott: It definitely knows.

424
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:24,259
Rym: Now, the only thing that really you might have a question about, because it'll come up a lot now, especially as RAM increases, is that there are three basic kinds of RAM.

425
00:31:25,665 --> 00:31:26,339
Rym: Of modern RAM.

426
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,399
Rym: We're not getting into all the old stuff.

427
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,100
Rym: There is registered, there is ECC, and there is just normal RAM.

428
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:35,359
Rym: ECC, you don't need to worry about.

429
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,539
Rym: No consumer motherboard that I know of uses it.

430
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:43,540
Rym: It's this error correction thing that's really only useful for expensive, powerful servers.

431
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:46,740
Rym: And ECC RAM costs almost double normal RAM.

432
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:47,556
Scott: Yeah.

433
00:31:48,023 --> 00:31:50,000
Scott: I mean, sometimes ECC RAM would be helpful.

434
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:56,020
Scott: Like, my parents' computer recently had a RAM problem, and if they had had ECC RAM, they wouldn't have had that problem.

435
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:02,319
Scott: But it's just so much easier to go, "Oh, I found out that the RAM is broken because I ran the memory checking program.

436
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,837
Scott: Let me, you know, take the RAM stick out and get them a new

437
00:32:05,998 --> 00:32:06,079
Scott: one.".

438
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:07,459
Scott: And that's that.

439
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,539
Rym: Now, registered is to not go into detail on it.

440
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,900
Rym: Basically, if you have a lot of RAM, it has to be registered.

441
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:19,240
Rym: Otherwise, your motherboard can't address it in an efficient manner.

442
00:32:19,701 --> 00:32:24,300
Rym: And either it won't recognize the rest of your RAM, or your RAM performance will degrade.

443
00:32:25,581 --> 00:32:33,679
Rym: Now, usually the motherboard will warn you, but a nice rule is, if you go over two gigabytes, you must use registered RAM, no matter what the motherboard says.

444
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:42,660
Scott: Yeah, I really, even if the motherboard says you can use unregistered in large quantities, just get registered if you're going all out on RAM.

445
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:52,139
Scott: And if you really need RAM, like, you're doing some photoshopping where you're going to have a big picture in the RAM, and you're going to be doing all kinds of stuff to it, get registered RAM.

446
00:32:52,562 --> 00:32:53,559
Scott: It will help you a lot.

447
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,979
Rym: Plus, even if you're only getting a gig now, if you get registered, it'll be a lot easier to upgrade to, you know, four gigs later on.

448
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,422
Scott: Yep.

449
00:33:01,174 --> 00:33:01,520
Scott: Absolutely.

450
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:08,539
Rym: And also, if you have four slots, and you want to have two gigs of RAM, buy two one-gig sticks, that way you still have two slots free.

451
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,300
Rym: Don't buy four 512s, then upgrading sucks.

452
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:28,420
Scott: Yeah, well the thing about the number of sticks to buy is that on certain motherboards, especially the N-Force NVIDIA motherboards, which I would recommend highly, there is a feature called dual channel, which only activates, it's activated automatically if you have enough sticks of RAM.

453
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:42,200
Scott: But basically, if you have two or more sticks of RAM of the same size, and you put them into your computer, the dual channel feature will be enabled if the motherboard decides that you have the correct RAM to do so.

454
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,839
Rym: It's just a performance-enhancing thing.

455
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,840
Scott: Yeah, so, what you'll see a lot when you're buying RAM are these paired sticks.

456
00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:54,476
Scott: It'll be like, you only add one thing to your cart, but it'll be like 2x512.

457
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:03,760
Scott: That means two 512 megabyte sticks of RAM that are in a pair, so if you put those into your computer together, they'll be dual channel.

458
00:34:04,262 --> 00:34:14,879
Rym: Because that is one thing, even though memory for AMD-based motherboards don't require it, usually it's a good idea to always buy your memory in sets of two.

459
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:19,940
Rym: Or at least always buy from the same manufacturer and of the same type.

460
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:24,260
Rym: You don't want to mix Crucial and Corsair in the same motherboard.

461
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:30,460
Rym: It's not technically wrong, and you probably won't have a problem, but it's just not a good idea.

462
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:34,900
Scott: And the paired sticks are actually from the same lot.

463
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,340
Scott: They were chips that were made right after each other, and they go together.

464
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,520
Scott: So it's the tiniest bit better.

465
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,379
Rym: Now there's also a slight downside to that.

466
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,199
Rym: If there was a problem with that lot, then both your RAM are going to fail at the same time.

467
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,659
Scott: Yeah, but RAM does have a warranty, so you're okay then.

468
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:56,480
Scott: But you're going to have maybe a problem in your computer if they both die five years later and you still have the computer.

469
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,320
Rym: Yeah, but by then you can buy whatever old RAM you needed for nothing.

470
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:04,440
Scott: But basically, if you want one gig of RAM and you know that's what you need, buy two 512 meg sticks and a pair.

471
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,100
Scott: If you need two gigs of RAM, buy two one gig sticks.

472
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:16,560
Scott: Don't go buying a single one gig stick and that's it, because it won't be as good as the two 512s performance-wise in most cases.

473
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,860
Rym: So in general, in this current time, and of course this changes rapidly, get at least a gig.

474
00:35:24,061 --> 00:35:25,118
Rym: Two gigs is real nice.

475
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,040
Scott: Two gigs if you're a heavy Windows user.

476
00:35:27,483 --> 00:35:30,160
Rym: Yeah, or if you're a multimedia 3D whatever.

477
00:35:30,902 --> 00:35:33,159
Rym: Or if you really, really multitask.

478
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:37,160
Rym: I don't mean having Firefox and a couple tabs and GM open.

479
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,760
Rym: I mean having multiple extensive applications open.

480
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:47,179
Scott: And if you're a Linux desktop user, one gig is really all you need and more than that won't help you unless you go nuts.

481
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,478
Scott: Like really nuts.

482
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,579
Rym: Or if you do crazy things like make a RAM disk and install things to it.

483
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,736
Scott: Yeah, you can do crazy stuff like that.

484
00:35:54,776 --> 00:35:55,099
Scott: That's fun.

485
00:35:56,385 --> 00:36:00,580
Scott: Oh, if you're using VMware or anything like that, you're gonna need a lot of RAM.

486
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,240
Rym: Yes, VMware or virtualization or Plex 86 or anything like that.

487
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:11,159
Scott: Yeah, I would go so far as to say if you're using VMware like daily that you should have as much RAM as your motherboard can hold.

488
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:14,019
Scott: Because it would just make it that much better for you.

489
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,119
Rym: Now, hard drives.

490
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,100
Scott: The hard drive is where you put all your stuff.

491
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,420
Rym: Now, this is complicated and basically I want to break this up into two sections.

492
00:36:25,203 --> 00:36:29,979
Rym: One, there's the hard drive or drives that you install your operating system and your programs on.

493
00:36:30,842 --> 00:36:32,900
Rym: And then there is mass storage.

494
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,700
Rym: And by mass storage, I mean things you don't change often.

495
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,919
Rym: Things like your MP3 collection that you're just adding to.

496
00:36:39,623 --> 00:36:41,840
Rym: Or all those Futurama episodes you downloaded.

497
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,640
Rym: All your data that isn't directly related to applications and operating system.

498
00:36:47,426 --> 00:36:47,620
Scott: Alright.

499
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:55,939
Rym: Because basically on any computer beyond a computer that has one or two hard drives in it, you're going to need to separate the two or you're going to have trouble down the road.

500
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:08,160
Scott: Yeah, if you've got a pile of MP3s and videos on the same partition on the same hard drive as your operating system, operating systems change and people upgrade things and fool around with things.

501
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:14,680
Scott: And drives with operating systems on them get a lot of use and get read and write data to a lot.

502
00:37:15,144 --> 00:37:16,460
Scott: Which means they're probably going to fail.

503
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,800
Scott: And if all your MP3s are on there with it, that's not the safest thing in the world.

504
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:22,759
Rym: And we're not trying to scare you.

505
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,459
Rym: Hard drives fail more often than you think.

506
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,980
Rym: They fail scarily often.

507
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,640
Scott: They fail more often than any other part of the computer.

508
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,920
Rym: I'm holding in my hand a dead hard drive.

509
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,859
Scott: Because they have moving parts.

510
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:40,260
Rym: Not only that, but hard drives are actually getting less reliable as they get more advanced.

511
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,359
Scott: And the bigger the hard drive is, the less reliable it is.

512
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:43,811
Rym: Yes.

513
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,080
Rym: Also, if it's a MaxTor or a Seagate or, and see here's the thing I'll get into now.

514
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:53,096
Rym: You're going to hear from people that, "Oh, don't buy a so-and-so brand of hard drive.

515
00:37:53,136 --> 00:37:53,277
Rym: They're

516
00:37:53,297 --> 00:37:53,518
Rym: bad.".

517
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,009
Rym: "Don't buy this brand.

518
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:55,635
Rym: They failed on

519
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:55,776
Rym: me.".

520
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:57,532
Rym: Every brand is that way.

521
00:37:57,613 --> 00:37:58,360
Rym: You really can't win.

522
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,920
Scott: Yeah, no matter what brand.

523
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:03,699
Scott: If you talk to someone, they'll say, "This is the brand that crashed on

524
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:03,819
Scott: me.".

525
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,477
Scott: "Then I switched to this brand and it didn't crash on

526
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:06,618
Scott: me.".

527
00:38:07,122 --> 00:38:08,540
Scott: It's all random, pretty much.

528
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,554
Scott: Except for Western Digital.

529
00:38:09,595 --> 00:38:09,899
Scott: They suck.

530
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,329
Rym: Yeah, they're better now.

531
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:12,540
Rym: They used to be real bad.

532
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,180
Rym: The old Western Digital caviar drives.

533
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:17,020
Scott: IBM Death Stars used to suck, but they no longer make those.

534
00:38:17,681 --> 00:38:20,031
Rym: Seagate used to be crazy good.

535
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:22,100
Rym: Now they're still good, but they're not infallible.

536
00:38:22,841 --> 00:38:26,760
Scott: Yes, Seagate was never infallible, but I would still recommend Seagate.

537
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,880
Scott: But I can't honestly say that MaxTor or those other brands are really worse.

538
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:38,640
Rym: You're looking more for the specs on the hard drive and the speed.

539
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,299
Rym: Don't worry so much about the brand.

540
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,580
Rym: Because it really, really doesn't matter.

541
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,600
Scott: As long as you don't get weirdo brand hard drives.

542
00:38:45,961 --> 00:38:49,600
Scott: Which are really hard to find because there aren't so many hard drive manufacturers these days.

543
00:38:50,221 --> 00:38:50,301
Rym: Yep.

544
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:55,380
Rym: So basically a MaxTor, a Seagate, an old IBM, though you don't really want old hard drives.

545
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,740
Rym: Never buy a used hard drive.

546
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:03,160
Scott: No, unless you're digging for old people's data and not trying to use a hard drive for daily use for you.

547
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:06,108
Scott: Buy brand new hard drives.

548
00:39:06,872 --> 00:39:08,380
Scott: Try to get ones that have three year warranties.

549
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,320
Scott: If they're only giving you a one year warranty, that means they don't have confidence in that drive.

550
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,980
Rym: The thing is, almost every company gives you a one year warranty.

551
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,820
Scott: No, nowadays Seagate gives you the three years.

552
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,650
Rym: Yes, Seagate does.

553
00:39:17,752 --> 00:39:18,420
Rym: Other people don't.

554
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,003
Scott: Yeah.

555
00:39:19,915 --> 00:39:20,260
Scott: It's alright.

556
00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:27,700
Rym: Now, there used to be, the argument back in the day on hard drives was, do I get IDE or do I get SCSI?

557
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:30,138
Rym: Well the answer to that is serial ATA.

558
00:39:31,582 --> 00:39:31,722
Scott: Yep.

559
00:39:32,323 --> 00:39:40,979
Scott: Recently, and on all motherboards that you will buy today, unless you buy a weird motherboard that you shouldn't be buying for a desktop, it will have serial ATA.

560
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:44,854
Scott: Now, remember in the olden days, you used to have these big fat cables?

561
00:39:44,894 --> 00:39:46,520
Scott: They would be really flat and wide.

562
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,219
Scott: And that's what you would connect your hard drives to your computer with.

563
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:53,300
Scott: And SCSI was the same way, only it was fatter and wider.

564
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,780
Rym: Yeah, well SCSI was a lot different in ways that you probably, you really don't, I don't want to get into the details.

565
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,920
Scott: Back in the day, your choice was basically between really awesome hard drives that were really expensive and worked differently.

566
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:05,419
Rym: SCSI.

567
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,580
Scott: And hard drives that worked normally and cost a normal amount but weren't so awesome.

568
00:40:09,822 --> 00:40:09,976
Rym: IDE.

569
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:16,420
Scott: Now, we have this thing called serial ATA, which is fast, awesome, and cost normal price.

570
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:22,600
Rym: It combines all the awesome of old SCSI, like SCSI 2 and back, with all the ease of use of IDE.

571
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:23,360
Scott: Yep.

572
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:31,580
Scott: So, if you don't buy a motherboard that has serial ATA and serial ATA hard drives for a desktop computer, I have no idea what you're thinking.

573
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,526
Rym: Unless you're going super cheap.

574
00:40:33,928 --> 00:40:37,100
Rym: Like, you're making a bare bones tiny computer for your grandma.

575
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:43,820
Scott: Yeah, every motherboard I saw had support for four serial ATA devices and four old school IDE devices.

576
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,240
Rym: And you still want the old school IDE capability.

577
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,139
Scott: Because you might come across a drive that is only old school IDE and you might want to plug it in.

578
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:58,300
Rym: Also, a lot of things like CD-ROMs and just various other things, a lot of them aren't serial ATA because they don't need it.

579
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:06,460
Scott: Yeah, but there are serial ATA CD-ROMs and if you really want to not have ribbon cables in your computer, it might be worth it to buy one.

580
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:10,119
Scott: But anyway, serial ATA is the way to go.

581
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:22,360
Scott: You have to look at your motherboard, which will either be serial ATA 150, which is normal, or serial ATA 2, aka serial ATA 300, which is just twice as fast, theoretically, on paper.

582
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:26,680
Scott: And depending on whatever your motherboard has, that's the kind of drive you want to buy.

583
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,161
Rym: Yes.

584
00:41:27,383 --> 00:41:29,960
Rym: However, if you have the faster one, it's backward compatible.

585
00:41:30,302 --> 00:41:31,057
Scott: Yep, so you can...

586
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,479
Rym: So you can buy a cheap, slower drive.

587
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:41,220
Scott: So if you have a motherboard that has fancy, fancy serial ATA, but you don't want to buy a fancy, fancy drive, just buy the normal serial ATA drive and you're good.

588
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:46,539
Rym: Now, there aren't many choices when it comes to specs of hard drives other than how big they are.

589
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:54,240
Rym: But the choices that you'll see, and this is important because it matters, there is RPMs, or how fast the drive spins.

590
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:58,500
Rym: This is directly related to its speed and its reliability.

591
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:04,640
Rym: The faster it spins, the faster the data can come off of it, and the more likely the drive is to fail.

592
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:05,822
Scott: Yep.

593
00:42:05,842 --> 00:42:08,951
Scott: You'll see crazy like 10,000, 15,000 RPM drives for servers and things and whatnot.

594
00:42:08,951 --> 00:42:18,780
Scott: 7200 RPM has pretty much been the standard for how fast a consumer desktop hard drive should be.

595
00:42:19,322 --> 00:42:19,584
Rym: Yes.

596
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:22,000
Rym: Also, you really only see faster drives on SCSI.

597
00:42:22,401 --> 00:42:23,484
Scott: Yep.

598
00:42:23,504 --> 00:42:25,370
Scott: And that's what I can recommend to buy to you.

599
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,293
Scott: That's what I buy.

600
00:42:26,313 --> 00:42:28,720
Scott: That's what's been in every computer for years and years.

601
00:42:29,544 --> 00:42:29,845
Rym: Yep.

602
00:42:29,886 --> 00:42:32,240
Rym: But 5400 has a use, which we'll get into.

603
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:32,731
Scott: Yep.

604
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:41,220
Rym: Now, since I said we're going to split this up, first, if you're building a computer, you need somewhere to put the operating system and the applications and everything.

605
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:41,806
Scott: Mm-hmm.

606
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,147
Rym: You have two basic options.

607
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:47,100
Rym: Either buy one hard drive or buy two hard drives.

608
00:42:47,682 --> 00:42:47,873
Scott: Mm-hmm.

609
00:42:48,362 --> 00:42:51,960
Rym: Now, if you buy one hard drive, you buy a hard drive, you install everything on it, that's that.

610
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:52,620
Scott: Yep.

611
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,800
Rym: If you buy two, most motherboards now that are serial ATA give you RAID options.

612
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,405
Rym: Now, RAID is the key.

613
00:43:00,866 --> 00:43:05,140
Rym: RAID was something that only a few years ago was out of the reach of most people.

614
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:11,300
Scott: It was only for like big companies who had tons and tons and tons of data that they needed to put someplace to be very, very safe.

615
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,539
Rym: RAID has suddenly and powerfully come into the mainstream, and you want it.

616
00:43:15,922 --> 00:43:16,818
Scott: And it's pretty cheap, too.

617
00:43:17,141 --> 00:43:23,480
Rym: It's cheap, and even if it wasn't that cheap, it's worth the money now, especially with the amounts of data that people store.

618
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,280
Rym: Mm-hmm.

619
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:32,040
Rym: Now, for the operating system, you'll have to read the manual on your motherboard to learn how to set up the RAID, but it's actually really, really easy.

620
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:40,157
Rym: But I recommend that no matter what computer you build, you buy two hard drives, and you can either RAID 0 or RAID 1 them.

621
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:42,223
Rym: Mm.

622
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:47,840
Rym: There are all these different numbers of RAID, but 0 and 1 are generally the only ones that your motherboard is going to support.

623
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:54,940
Rym: 0 gives you, it basically combines the two drives into one big, super-fast drive called a stripe.

624
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:04,232
Scott: If you're someone who needs lots and lots of performance, like you have lots and lots of video editing going on, but you know, you can live with it.

625
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:09,460
Scott: if maybe the drives crash because you're smart and you back up on an external drive or a server somewhere.

626
00:44:09,582 --> 00:44:09,647
Scott: Yep.

627
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:17,160
Scott: But you're editing video, which means if you can read it off the drive faster, you can edit it faster and work faster, RAID 0 is what you want.

628
00:44:17,761 --> 00:44:24,680
Rym: RAID 0 stripes can give you up to about 40% increases in speed, because it can read and write to both disks simultaneously.

629
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,320
Scott: Yep, it's very, very good.

630
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,806
Rym: Now, there's a major drawback to this.

631
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:34,180
Rym: If one of the drives fail, all the data's gone from both drives, irrecoverably.

632
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,280
Scott: Yep, unless you go to some data recovery specialists.

633
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,579
Rym: That costs more than a new computer would cost.

634
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:46,920
Scott: Yeah, I would not recommend going to them unless you're a company and the money and the data on those drives is worth more money than it costs to recover it.

635
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:59,899
Rym: Now, for an operating system, RAID 0 is fine because, theoretically, as long as you're storing your data, all the things, all the files that you save that aren't an application somewhere else, the worst case, you lose the array.

636
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,340
Rym: You buy a new drive, you replace it, and you reinstall your operating system and all your programs.

637
00:45:05,381 --> 00:45:06,647
Rym: That's not that difficult.

638
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:09,120
Rym: Even in Windows, it's really not that much of a pain.

639
00:45:09,321 --> 00:45:11,607
Scott: The only data you have to worry about losing.

640
00:45:11,687 --> 00:45:16,040
Scott: If you're worried about reliability, it should only be because of data that cannot be replaced.

641
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,799
Scott: Software that is installed, things that you can download from the internet again, things that are on CDs.

642
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,999
Scott: Don't worry if your hard drive crashes and that's all that's on there, because you can just put it on there again.

643
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:35,253
Rym: Now, the other option is RAID 1, and this option is more expensive.

644
00:45:35,654 --> 00:45:38,260
Rym: In fact, it's twice as expensive per megabyte.

645
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:47,420
Rym: RAID 1, if you have two drives, you only get one drive worth of space, and it makes a copy of that entire drive to the other drive at all times.

646
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,259
Scott: But if one of the drives crash...

647
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,583
Rym: You're fine!

648
00:45:51,305 --> 00:45:53,955
Rym: All you do is turn the computer, the computer will work just as normal.

649
00:45:53,995 --> 00:45:55,119
Rym: It'll say, "Hey, I lost a

650
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:55,300
Rym: drive.".

651
00:45:56,261 --> 00:46:03,620
Rym: And whenever you feel like it, you turn the computer off, you take the dead drive out, you put a new drive in, and it rebuilds all the data on the new drive and you have a backup again.

652
00:46:03,901 --> 00:46:04,041
Rym: Yep.

653
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:10,360
Scott: I would recommend using RAID 1 if you have lots and lots of, say, documents for your home business.

654
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:18,180
Rym: Or, if it's really worth it to you to, no matter what happens to your hard drives, you won't have to ever reinstall or rebuild your computer.

655
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,441
Scott: Yep.

656
00:46:19,582 --> 00:46:21,626
Scott: Some people, you know, they have important data.

657
00:46:21,787 --> 00:46:27,880
Scott: Maybe say you have all the emails of your entire life on your hard drive, because maybe you switched email servers.

658
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:46,079
Scott: Or, you know, you have something special, and instead of, you know, backing up onto tapes or external hard drives or things, which is, you know, an intensive, manual, possibly daily procedure that you have to go through, or go through the trouble of automating, RAID 1 just, boop, you're safe.

659
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,893
Rym: Now, there are two more options, and we don't have to go into great detail on them.

660
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,480
Rym: One is no RAID at all, just have a disk.

661
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:52,910
Scott: Yep.

662
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:56,517
Rym: Or, you know, JBOD, which is the acronym for "Just a Bunch of

663
00:46:56,558 --> 00:46:56,859
Rym: Disks.".

664
00:46:57,364 --> 00:46:58,899
Scott: Yeah, that's what it really stands for.

665
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,148
Rym: Yeah, seriously, it'll say that onto boxes.

666
00:47:01,188 --> 00:47:03,920
Rym: If you see JBOD and you're confused by it, it doesn't mean anything.

667
00:47:03,981 --> 00:47:04,678
Scott: Just a bunch of disks.

668
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:05,721
Rym: Yeah, literally.

669
00:47:06,984 --> 00:47:09,008
Rym: But if you have just a disk, that's fine.

670
00:47:09,148 --> 00:47:11,152
Rym: No RAID, you just install your operating system on it.

671
00:47:11,493 --> 00:47:14,880
Rym: But once again, just like a RAID 0, if that drive goes, you lose all your data.

672
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:15,229
Scott: Yep.

673
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:23,115
Rym: And then there's RAID 0+1, which, to simplify greatly, is a RAID 0 of RAID 1s, or a RAID 1 of RAID 0s.

674
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:33,400
Rym: So you need four disks to do that, and you lose the space on two of them, and you get crazy performance, and full backup all the time.

675
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,299
Scott: Yep, but you need to buy extra disks.

676
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,099
Rym: Four drives to get the space on two of them.

677
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:39,608
Scott: Yeah.

678
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:55,480
Rym: Now, basically, if you have a large collection of data, like beyond some Office files, we're talking hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes of data, MP3s, whatever, you really need a separate storage solution.

679
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:06,280
Scott: Maybe another computer with a bunch of hard drives in it, or some sort of box full of hard drives that is outside of your computer and attached to your computer by another means.

680
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:08,728
Rym: Or, in your computer, in a separate RAID.

681
00:48:09,571 --> 00:48:12,280
Rym: So, just because there are so many options, here's a nice example.

682
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,629
Rym: You have one hard drive connected to your serial ATA.

683
00:48:16,471 --> 00:48:19,380
Rym: That hard drive has your operating system and all your applications installed on it.

684
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,129
Rym: It's a 7200 RPM fast drive.

685
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:25,140
Rym: Maybe you have two of them and you make it a stripe, but it doesn't matter.

686
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,400
Rym: Your operating system and your applications are on these fast drives.

687
00:48:28,461 --> 00:48:32,451
Rym: Now you buy a RAID card and you stick it in a PCI slot.

688
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:34,516
Rym: RAID cards aren't that expensive.

689
00:48:34,656 --> 00:48:36,100
Rym: About a hundred bucks will get you a decent one.

690
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,370
Rym: A RAID card lets you do the other numbers of RAID, because I said 0 and 1.

691
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,754
Rym: There's also 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 55, and a whole bunch of them.

692
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,625
Rym: Now, RAID 5, I'm really going to skip a lot here.

693
00:48:50,905 --> 00:48:52,347
Rym: You want RAID 5.

694
00:48:52,347 --> 00:49:02,000
Rym: RAID 5 gives you very good speed increases, 20 to 30% in many cases, which is almost as much as a pure stripe, a pure RAID 0.

695
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,400
Rym: But at the same time, you get redundancy, which is almost as good as a RAID 1.

696
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:25,260
Rym: Basically what it does is, say you have N drives, you'll get N minus 1 drives worth of space, and that last drive holds parity information, with which, if any one of the drives in the array dies, you can use that parity to recreate all the data on the lost drive.

697
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:35,860
Scott: So if you have 5 drives and one of them crashes, you're still okay, because you can replace it, and if you wait a while, eventually all the data on that drive will reappear.

698
00:49:36,321 --> 00:49:44,354
Rym: Now technically what I said was a RAID 3, because a RAID 5 just means that the parity is distributed among all the disks, and it's kind of complicated, don't worry about it.

699
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,700
Rym: RAID 5 is what you want, most things don't even bother with RAID 3 anymore.

700
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,680
Rym: And basically you want to buy 4 drives, make a RAID 5 of them, stick them on a RAID card, and then put all your data there.

701
00:49:56,361 --> 00:50:15,001
Scott: Now you can make a RAID 5 with 3 drives, so if you're really cheap and you don't really need that much space, let's say you buy some crazy motherboard that supports RAID 5 and has 4 serial ATA connectors, you can buy 4 drives, use one of them for your OS, and then 3 of them for a RAID 5.

702
00:50:15,001 --> 00:50:16,219
Rym: Which is a very good idea.

703
00:50:16,521 --> 00:50:22,953
Scott: Yeah, but the motherboards that support RAID 5 are very hard to come by, so you might be paying an extra up to $100 for that motherboard.

704
00:50:23,274 --> 00:50:26,200
Scott: But it could be worth it if you're definitely going to go this route.

705
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,065
Rym: Now also keep in mind, hard drives are cheap.

706
00:50:29,547 --> 00:50:31,634
Rym: You can buy a 250/300GB hard drive for very little money comparatively.

707
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:41,114
Scott: Yeah, and there's sales occasionally these days where you can see stuff like, 200GB hard drive, 40 bucks, limit one per person.

708
00:50:41,254 --> 00:50:44,240
Scott: So if you get a bunch of your friends, you can buy a bunch of these things for nothing.

709
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,523
Rym: So don't skimp on hard drives.

710
00:50:47,903 --> 00:50:48,865
Rym: Back up your data.

711
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,069
Rym: I don't know how much more I can stress that.

712
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:57,357
Rym: Most people don't back up at all, and they don't seem to realize that hard drives die often and you'll lose everything.

713
00:50:57,977 --> 00:50:59,760
Rym: Imagine if you lost every MP3 you had.

714
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:11,020
Scott: Well, there is one thing, is that some people, they don't download lots of MP3s, or maybe they use like the iTunes Music Store, in which case if they've already bought a song and they still have their account, they can download it again.

715
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,667
Scott: And maybe they don't have so many applications, so they don't need to use a lot of space for them.

716
00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:20,673
Scott: And they don't download a lot of movies, or maybe they stream a lot of movies.

717
00:51:20,974 --> 00:51:24,820
Scott: Or they store all their music and movies on their iPod, not on their computer.

718
00:51:25,901 --> 00:51:31,430
Scott: If you're one of these people who doesn't really need lots of hard drive space at all, just get one hard drive.

719
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:34,877
Scott: Like an 80GB hard drive and put your operating system on it, and that's that.

720
00:51:35,418 --> 00:51:36,720
Scott: You don't have to worry about any of this crap.

721
00:51:38,143 --> 00:51:40,940
Rym: If you have data, you need somewhere safe to put it.

722
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:58,280
Scott: Also, if the only data you have is a few Excel files, or a few Word documents, you can get one of those USB little tiny drives that you just stick in, and you can put all your data on that, or maybe copy your My Documents folder to it and take it around with you.

723
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,549
Rym: Well, because Penny Arcade made this mistake, if you have a backup drive, it's a backup.

724
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:05,793
Rym: That means the data is also somewhere else.

725
00:52:06,574 --> 00:52:09,860
Rym: So you save it to your hard drive and you periodically copy it to the other drive.

726
00:52:10,222 --> 00:52:13,880
Rym: You don't just put it all on that other drive, because then if that drive fails, you're just as fucked.

727
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:15,281
Scott: Yep.

728
00:52:15,421 --> 00:52:35,280
Scott: You have to gauge how much data you have, how much data you're going to have, how much space all your stuff takes up, and whether it's worth it to buy a big RAID that can maybe hold 600GB of data, or if you're only going to have 80GB of stuff and it's just stupid for you to spend money on that.

729
00:52:35,941 --> 00:52:45,800
Scott: But always know that unless you have some sort of system of backing up or RAIDing, that your data is in a precarious position.

730
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:46,742
Rym: Yep.

731
00:52:46,762 --> 00:52:50,500
Rym: And if your data is on the same disk as your operating system, even more precarious.

732
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:51,887
Scott: Very precarious.

733
00:52:53,098 --> 00:52:53,380
Scott: Alright.

734
00:52:54,041 --> 00:53:07,080
Rym: So, we've talked a long time about this, and I guess that means that our series is going to continue next week, next Monday, with part 3, where we'll get into picking a video card, which will probably be a whole show unto itself.

735
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,299
Scott: Ah, the video card isn't so complicated.

736
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,804
Rym: Well, I guess we'll do a video card and all the other peripherals.

737
00:53:12,085 --> 00:53:20,540
Rym: Video card monitors and CRTs if you need things like that, DVD burners, which is kind of complicated now.

738
00:53:21,123 --> 00:53:23,300
Scott: It's not as complicated as it was a few months ago.

739
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,820
Rym: Yeah, because luckily things have kind of solidified.

740
00:53:26,824 --> 00:53:26,905
Scott: Yep.

741
00:53:26,925 --> 00:53:28,720
Scott: Floppy drives, which are no longer needed.

742
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,120
Rym: Yeah, though they're still kind of useful, but the thing is they're expensive now, which is kind of surprising.

743
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,160
Scott: Oh, and of course, the boxes that you put your computer in.

744
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:42,200
Rym: Yes, and probably the most neglected and yet most critical component of all, the power supply.

745
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:42,852
Scott: Yep.

746
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,787
Rym: You don't think anything of the power supply.

747
00:53:44,808 --> 00:53:47,560
Rym: The power supply is just the thing that you plug it in and it works.

748
00:53:48,363 --> 00:53:50,530
Rym: The power supply can make or break your system.

749
00:53:51,072 --> 00:53:53,560
Rym: Too weak a power supply can destroy your motherboard.

750
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,799
Scott: Too weak a power supply and your computer won't even work.

751
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:56,289
Scott: Yeah.

752
00:53:56,681 --> 00:53:57,460
Scott: I had that problem.

753
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,008
Rym: So we'll get into all that next Monday.

754
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:00,971
Rym: Stay tuned.

755
00:54:02,517 --> 00:54:03,180
Rym: And we out.

756
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,102
Scott: Appear.

757
00:54:05,037 --> 00:54:05,260
Scott: Appear.

758
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:15,059
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

759
00:54:15,401 --> 00:54:17,610
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.
