00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,912
Rym: It's Tuesday December 29th 2020.

2
00:00:13,912 --> 00:00:14,313
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,593 --> 00:00:17,240
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,190
Rym: We are talking about the last 10 years of games.

5
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:24,828
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:29,319
Rym: So I'm working this week But it's like the low-key.

7
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:30,745
Rym: We're like no one's it.

8
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:36,859
Rym: well because I saved all my vacation days and my job doesn't just kind of the end of the year Like yours does my where my work is closed.

9
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:37,943
Rym: I ran a company.

10
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:40,691
Rym: it would fucking close from like Christmas to New Year's every year.

11
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:43,440
Scott: my previous company and current company closed.

12
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:45,768
Scott: I would not work somewhere if they were not closed.

13
00:00:45,788 --> 00:00:50,587
Rym: if I had a company would also close in like the peak month like The peak of summer.

14
00:00:50,647 --> 00:00:51,492
Rym: they'd be like a two-week.

15
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:52,337
Rym: We're just closed.

16
00:00:52,377 --> 00:00:52,840
Rym: go to the beach.

17
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:55,667
Rym: That's cuz.

18
00:00:55,687 --> 00:01:08,735
Rym: I'm a good person man, but I've had a lot more free time because I finished a bunch of other projects and I got a bunch of things set up and I basically have been playing a lot of Non-overwatch video games again.

19
00:01:08,795 --> 00:01:19,798
Rym: It's kind of weird Okay, but what I've been playing a lot of again is Star Wars squadrons Mm-hmm, and the thing is Star Wars quadrants like we reviewed it already.

20
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:23,510
Rym: The game's great Like it's everything I wanted but we were.

21
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:31,917
Rym: uh, I think the game industry term was dog shit And it in terms of our actual play like when me and Scott like all of us are still dog shit at it.

22
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:37,038
Rym: Ah So since the update that is no longer true.

23
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:40,768
Scott: I Think that what is how if anything has happened?

24
00:01:40,788 --> 00:01:42,514
Scott: They have simply fixed matchmakings.

25
00:01:42,574 --> 00:01:44,120
Rym: There's a few things they fix.

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,195
Rym: So if you haven't played our skills, our bodies didn't suddenly change.

27
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,580
Scott: We didn't practice it, right?

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,569
Scott: There's no way we got better at it overnight.

29
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,900
Rym: I actually did practice and got better.

30
00:01:54,161 --> 00:02:05,993
Rym: I've been playing a lot of bunch of solo and I was practicing certain kinds of things and forcing myself to play the a-wing and the tie interceptor even when I was losing and my team was sucking partly because of me.

31
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:07,520
Rym: It was starting to pay off.

32
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:10,582
Rym: I also did read a lot more tutorials on things Like.

33
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:19,059
Rym: I learned how to micro drift pretty well Like I can do those like weird like 90 degree 90 degree turns like around an asteroid like really reliably now.

34
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:22,975
Rym: But okay, what really happened is this update?

35
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:24,140
Rym: remember when they released this game?

36
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,919
Rym: They definitely were like hedging their bets because they said things like the game is coming out.

37
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:33,964
Rym: But it's as is like we're not gonna invest more in the game There aren't gonna be new ships.

38
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:43,581
Scott: Yeah, the people who are working on it at what it was that company in Canada Right is like it's published by EA but this other company made it and they're basically like, okay, you guys are done now Right.

39
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,685
Scott: We're done paying you money.

40
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:45,629
Scott: This is you made it.

41
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,015
Scott: It's released the end.

42
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:50,588
Scott: Yep, right and buy it for 40 bucks or don't.

43
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:58,699
Rym: but it was a very popular and I think they realized that or whatever whatever decision-making process internally went from.

44
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:04,777
Rym: Well, let's hedge our bets - okay, the game's big let's actually invest more into it.

45
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:18,457
Rym: and they made a lot of balance changes a lot of bug fixes and They seem to have fixed the matchmaking because one thing that is very different now is we are playing against people who are around our skill level.

46
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:26,059
Scott: Yeah Matchmaking is of course always super huge in any game that is skill based with not a lot of luck.

47
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:35,448
Scott: because You know, if you got wedge antilles out there, right you're just big trouble If you're not, you know.

48
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,612
Rym: and but what's interesting is the changes They made the balance changes not so much the matchmaking but the balance changes.

49
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:49,860
Rym: they change in ways That's hard to describe and I'm still introspect Like I'm still inspecting as I play and I think about why it feels so different.

50
00:03:50,422 --> 00:04:08,340
Rym: It changed the way the game feels to play and it feels a lot more like the old tie fighter game and it seems to mostly focus around things like They tweaked a bunch of the weapons to where that one rotary like burst cannon thing is not just the god of the game anymore.

51
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:09,703
Rym: That's good.

52
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:13,320
Rym: They did some oddly specific things like that that charge up cannon.

53
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,918
Rym: Now when you're charging it you take double damage until you release to prevent people using it to

54
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,180
Scott: couse

55
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:29,020
Rym: Mm-hmm, so it can only really be used when you're chasing someone as a win more or like attacking a capital ship Like if you're going head-on against someone that weapon is a mistake

56
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:30,381
Scott: Mm-hmm.

57
00:04:30,883 --> 00:04:39,025
Rym: They also changed the way the capital ships interact with star fighters and how they target such that if you're going fast and Maneuvering a lot.

58
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:41,179
Rym: It actually takes them a lot longer to lock on to you.

59
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:42,741
Scott: And yeah I was always.

60
00:04:42,822 --> 00:04:49,982
Scott: I was under the impression that like that the the star destroyers and the capital ships basically weren't actually like Shooting.

61
00:04:50,423 --> 00:05:02,440
Scott: they were just sort of like, you know saying, you know calculating like is there an enemy within Right damage them, you know this percent, you know over time whatever right or stuff like that.

62
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,838
Rym: No, they just work like a normal ship.

63
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:05,598
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

64
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:06,932
Rym: They've got all those turrets.

65
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:14,983
Rym: those turrets all fire Independently and it has logic for what to target and it basically if you're going fast and maneuvering more like, you know It calculates.

66
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:19,540
Scott: Okay, this x-wing has been within the range of the Star Destroyer for x seconds.

67
00:05:20,082 --> 00:05:24,320
Scott: Alright animate the turret shooting it guaranteed hitting it and doing this much damage, right?

68
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:29,312
Rym: It's not Yeah, it's actually like.

69
00:05:29,332 --> 00:05:31,680
Rym: it's very clear if you watch how they behave in-game.

70
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:38,060
Rym: Like you know the training mode mess with it a little bit that it seems to do a very simple system of prioritizing targets.

71
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:51,068
Rym: It doesn't seem to do a lot of logic there But it does prioritize targets and it basically seems to disperse its fire among the valid targets within its zone That it has gotten a lock on and it has some.

72
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:57,287
Rym: the targeting system has some sort of logic where it takes it longer to lock based on how fast you're going and how much you're maneuvering.

73
00:05:57,929 --> 00:06:12,400
Rym: so the end result and I tested this a bunch was that if You fly straight at it by yourself You see like in the distance It'll suddenly fire all of its turrets that can see you at you and this big salvo just like comes at you and only you.

74
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:18,940
Rym: But if you come at it with a bunch of ships It's it targets all of them at the same time and shoots like a little bit at all of them.

75
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:25,499
Rym: But if one of the ships you're coming in with is faster than the other ones, it doesn't target the faster ship for a while.

76
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,000
Scott: Mmm,

77
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:43,060
Rym: and I confirm this experimentally by playing the end result of all these changes though Like I cannot stress enough if you bounced off of this game because it felt too hard the game just feels Way more fun to play and all these balance changes basically made all the different play styles kind of work.

78
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:48,200
Rym: Like it's kind of shocking how all these tweaks have made the game feel completely differently.

79
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,771
Scott: Small changes make a big difference.

80
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:56,231
Rym: Yeah, and as a result, I'm diving into this game pretty hard now Like I'm playing it almost every day.

81
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:57,300
Rym: This game is great.

82
00:06:59,424 --> 00:07:00,355
Rym: So you got got any news?

83
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:04,489
Scott: Not really, it's not like people are releasing games.

84
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:05,774
Scott: I'm on the holiday, right?

85
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:09,060
Scott: They release them before the holiday To sell for the holiday.

86
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:11,519
Scott: But yeah, I've been playing this game.

87
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:19,671
Scott: I saw this game at PAX many years ago at least a few years ago when it was like super new not even out yet And it's been in every packs.

88
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,858
Scott: I've been to since then.

89
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:23,413
Scott: At least video game packs is right.

90
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:24,500
Scott: somewhere it had a booth.

91
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:30,184
Scott: They were showing it off and I said that game looks kind of interesting, you know I'll probably play that one day.

92
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:31,408
Scott: and that day came.

93
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,475
Scott: so the game is graveyard keeper.

94
00:07:34,017 --> 00:07:37,910
Scott: It's a game That you know, it's pixely kind of art.

95
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:40,820
Scott: It's got sort of Lucas artsy kind of humor.

96
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:45,340
Scott: You know that kind of thing, right and it's sort of like a harvest moon situation.

97
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:48,078
Scott: But you are a graveyard keeper and that's all I knew about it.

98
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:50,392
Scott: So now that I've played it a bunch.

99
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:55,819
Scott: I haven't beaten it yet It's pretty interesting And there's also some not good things, right?

100
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:04,930
Scott: So the good thing about it that makes it different from all the other harvest moons rune factories Stardew valleys all those sorts of things.

101
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,520
Scott: right is let's say you're playing rune factory And there's a whole bunch of different systems in all these games, right?

102
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,040
Scott: You know, you got your your your your farming you get your dating you got right?

103
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:28,940
Scott: There's no dating in graveyard keeper, but you know, it's there's other stuff for you got dungeoning sometimes all kinds of systems but usually you sort of have to or feel like you have to Keep up on all the systems like like in rune factory.

104
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,306
Scott: There's like a day right.

105
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:35,009
Scott: the day goes around and as you plant some crops You got to water them every day.

106
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:37,179
Scott: If you miss a day, they'll be shitty your crops, right?

107
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,799
Scott: So every day you have to water them every day and then if they grow you got to harvest them at the exact right day.

108
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:46,092
Scott: Otherwise, then they start to rot right and you sort of have to keep.

109
00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:49,526
Scott: you know, if you got animals you got to feed them daily, yeah, or every.

110
00:08:49,586 --> 00:08:51,012
Scott: I've got to brush the animals like.

111
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:59,000
Rym: it's a game loop that I have Never in my life been able to engage with without getting mad at and as I get older I have even less patience for right.

112
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:05,400
Scott: So what graveyard keeper does is very interesting and that is the same sort of game mechanics, right?

113
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,540
Scott: It's like okay, you know get you know, the materials in a minecraft II sort of way, right?

114
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,180
Scott: Yeah tree take a log build the building to process the log into planks.

115
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,760
Scott: You know five planks and three bits of metal makes a desk or some shit like that, you know the same usual thing, right?

116
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,972
Scott: You know, you need ten pumpkins to do this.

117
00:09:23,992 --> 00:09:25,682
Scott: So you go to you Have you?

118
00:09:25,763 --> 00:09:27,169
Scott: did you plow some land?

119
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,800
Scott: you plant some pumpkin seeds that you bought, right?

120
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:34,660
Scott: You you put some fertilizer first, right, you know same same shit you do with all these other games.

121
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:47,311
Scott: but While there is a day in a week this sort of fictional weekly calendar where there's like a different symbol for each day There is no pressure on anything.

122
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:49,320
Scott: It's like they're like Satan.

123
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,030
Scott: There are quests that you're trying to accomplish.

124
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,258
Scott: for example, like the astrologer.

125
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:57,819
Scott: it'll be like All right, the astrologer needs some acid to repair a book, right?

126
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:02,731
Scott: You can just get him the acid Whenever the fuck you can just you could get.

127
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:04,340
Scott: you could just do everything else in the game.

128
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:07,620
Scott: I just whenever you feel like getting the acid you can do it, right?

129
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,420
Scott: He's always you know, well the astrologer is only there once a week on a particular day.

130
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,953
Scott: But you know, you can just do it whenever it.

131
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:20,479
Scott: the quest never goes away You know you if you need say some pumpkins to make the acid which you don't I'm just making an exam.

132
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,520
Rym: That makes me more interested in this game because that's why I can't engage with Stardew Valley, right?

133
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,959
Scott: Let's say you need some pumpkins for something, right?

134
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:30,088
Scott: The witch the witch actually had a quest.

135
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:33,160
Scott: we needed to bring her a pumpkin right to make it big.

136
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,130
Scott: So you just you go you dig some land right.

137
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,180
Scott: you plant your pumpkin seed then you can just go focus.

138
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:42,155
Scott: Let's say you want to focus on this other quest.

139
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:43,222
Scott: where you need it I don't know.

140
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,347
Scott: you want to build up your.

141
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:46,879
Scott: you want to make your graveyard nicer for the for the priest, right?

142
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,374
Scott: You just go spend like a whole bunch of days working on your graveyard.

143
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:51,600
Scott: Just ignoring the pumpkins.

144
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,647
Scott: You just forgotten about them.

145
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:54,660
Scott: You're not and you're not playing the farming system.

146
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,599
Scott: You're only playing the graveyard system because that's what you feel like doing right now.

147
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:06,640
Scott: You fully focus on doing this graveyard stuff getting stones carving them putting them in the graveyard getting bodies You know embalming them burying of them, right?

148
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,522
Scott: You're doing though.

149
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:13,120
Scott: you're interacting with just the system that you're focused on right now, and you just forgot all about the farming system.

150
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,003
Scott: You're not even touching it.

151
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:17,555
Scott: weeks in game in game weeks have gone by.

152
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:19,100
Scott: you haven't even checked the farm.

153
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,653
Scott: When you're ready for the farm again, you're like okay my graveyards perfect.

154
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:24,680
Scott: I completed my graveyard related quests.

155
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:26,505
Scott: Let's go check on the farm.

156
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:29,395
Scott: all the pumpkins are just sitting there a plus pumpkins.

157
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:30,620
Scott: They're just chillin waiting for you.

158
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,347
Scott: They're not rotten or anything, you know, so you can.

159
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:37,800
Scott: there's many many systems and it is a very time-consuming game.

160
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:50,745
Scott: but you could just pick which parts of the game you're gonna focus on at any given moment and Fully focus on those and there's no FOMO of with any other part of the game at any time Which is kind of nice.

161
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:52,193
Scott: and that's I think what keeps me.

162
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:53,359
Scott: kept me playing it, right?

163
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:56,359
Scott: um bad parts of this game.

164
00:11:57,661 --> 00:12:05,157
Scott: It there's a lot of systems and this quests relating to all the systems with all those plots and characters And I think partially it's because I bought a bundle with all the DLCs.

165
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:08,579
Scott: This game takes a long fucking time to play.

166
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:12,853
Rym: Well, the game is actually on sale right now for like under seven bucks.

167
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:13,876
Scott: That's only.

168
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:14,739
Scott: that's without the DLCs.

169
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,887
Scott: But yeah, I bought the.

170
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:17,077
Scott: I bought so I got it.

171
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:19,486
Scott: Also this game.

172
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:23,162
Scott: I don't think there's of the characters in the game I didn't.

173
00:12:23,563 --> 00:12:26,534
Scott: I don't remember if there's any not white characters in this game.

174
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:28,119
Scott: I don't think there are.

175
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:30,988
Scott: You also can't like even change your character.

176
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:33,055
Scott: You're just this white beard dude, right?

177
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:34,038
Scott: It's that's your character.

178
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:34,599
Scott: deal with it.

179
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:50,360
Scott: Also, one of the characters is clearly a Romani type trading dude in the woods And they referred to him with the G racial slur for that Basically as if it's just a normal word there and I don't even know.

180
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:53,654
Scott: Then you know, they're just using it like it's 1980 something, right?

181
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:57,296
Scott: So that's a thing.

182
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:02,280
Scott: But yeah, the only time pressure there is I know I said there was like no pressure.

183
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:12,947
Scott: There is one thing in the game, you know, it's not there at the beginning of the game, but eventually You get the ability to give sermons in the church And that is like you're there.

184
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:23,039
Scott: that not only is gonna be like a very strong source of money Which is hard not that easy to get Because it's you can't just sell all your stuff easily because that's like supply and demand and shit like that.

185
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:28,899
Scott: But it's also the only way that I know of to get the faith resource, which is needed for a lot of things.

186
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:35,619
Scott: So and you can only do it on I guess Sunday or the day of the week that has the Sun symbol on it.

187
00:13:36,303 --> 00:13:42,115
Scott: So basically even though there's no time pressure on anything You do have to sort of keep an eye on the calendar and be like up.

188
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:43,120
Scott: It's the Sun day.

189
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,860
Scott: I have to go and just you know, push go to the church and push the one button just to collect my faith, right?

190
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,120
Scott: It's it's that sort of thing and certain NPCs only appear one day of the week, right?

191
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,059
Scott: The astrologer only is on the moon day.

192
00:13:55,542 --> 00:14:01,124
Scott: So if you have any astrologer related business, you got to wait for the moon day and remember and if you miss it It's not a big deal.

193
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:02,269
Scott: No, you missed it.

194
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:04,660
Scott: Yeah, it's like you just wait another week and then he'll be back.

195
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,171
Scott: Right, but it is a little bit annoying.

196
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,280
Scott: It's like alright, I guess I can't engage with that system.

197
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,379
Scott: Wait another week before I can go continue that bit, right?

198
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:16,699
Scott: So if you at single-player only.

199
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:22,756
Scott: So yeah, if you like that kind of thing, this is an okay game to play.

200
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:23,518
Scott: It's not perfect.

201
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:24,460
Scott: It's got some issues.

202
00:14:24,582 --> 00:14:31,440
Scott: Oh another issue was Clearly they didn't like not the all the game has got so many bits going on.

203
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:38,310
Scott: I did some like plot stuff out of order and like my characters That clearly they weren't supposed like that didn't learn.

204
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:47,315
Scott: the character said some things as if they knew information And then after that I did a different quest and learned the information Thing before he learned the thing.

205
00:14:49,562 --> 00:14:50,165
Scott: So there's a it's.

206
00:14:50,286 --> 00:14:52,760
Scott: it's not that polished in the in those sorts of areas.

207
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:55,484
Scott: But yeah, it could see.

208
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:58,855
Scott: no I saw it a pecs and it looked interesting and I keep playing it.

209
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:00,460
Scott: So that's something.

210
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:01,951
Rym: It looks like it's on the switch too.

211
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:03,060
Rym: So maybe I'll play it on the switch.

212
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,509
Scott: Maybe I don't know if it could be good to play on the switch.

213
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,880
Scott: It's really a mouse and keyboard kind of situation.

214
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,480
Rym: I'll have to look at a video and see exactly how it works on the switch because slay the spire is best on the switch.

215
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,344
Rym: But I don't know about all.

216
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:17,460
Scott: there's a lot of manipulating inventory screens.

217
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:22,455
Rym: If it's just a bunch of like radio radio menus, it's not radio.

218
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:23,799
Scott: Oh you mean on the switch.

219
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:26,879
Rym: Oh, yeah No, I don't think I wonder what it look like on the switch.

220
00:15:27,704 --> 00:15:28,780
Scott: I don't know what it looks like on the switch.

221
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,815
Scott: I imagine it looks the same and you just use your analog stick instead of a mouse or a touch screen or that sounds actually horrible.

222
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:36,884
Scott: Yeah, it's a mouse and keyboard game I think.

223
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:42,240
Scott: but all the other thing is that you know The thing I never ever want to do is touch my switches screen like ever.

224
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:46,898
Scott: Yeah, there's also you know people talk about like quality of life and these sorts of go.

225
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:51,094
Rym: the listeners Switch version has terrible load times - okay.

226
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:51,756
Scott: That's good info.

227
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:52,559
Scott: good info.

228
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:53,905
Rym: Well, then it's all.

229
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:55,472
Rym: it's under seven bucks on Steam's.

230
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,120
Rym: I guess buy it on Steam if you're interested.

231
00:15:57,847 --> 00:15:59,139
Scott: Well, that doesn't include the DLCs.

232
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:06,197
Scott: But anyway, the last thing is that in terms of quality of life the game does just make itself easy to play.

233
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:12,899
Scott: like you can eventually Make zombies out of the dead bodies to do a lot of the work for you stuff anymore.

234
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:14,464
Scott: And like you can.

235
00:16:14,484 --> 00:16:24,400
Scott: just like you can you start with a vineyard and you make grapes and then you make wine But then you can get zombie vineyard and then you can get zombie wine making right and then you just have wine.

236
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,678
Scott: You don't have to do anything, right?

237
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:32,240
Scott: But there's also like you can build like little container trunks right in different areas.

238
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:39,967
Scott: So let's say in your vineyard you build a trunk and in the trunk you put your grape seeds and your fertilizer Right and your trellises and whatever.

239
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:47,700
Scott: then when you go to do stuff in the grape area It basically considers all that stuff to like be in your pocket.

240
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:48,543
Scott: You don't have to like.

241
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:52,278
Scott: go get the stuff then, you know, it's just the stuff you just do it, right?

242
00:16:53,324 --> 00:16:55,215
Scott: So it makes itself really convenient.

243
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:55,939
Scott: in that way.

244
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:56,944
Scott: let's let's.

245
00:16:57,004 --> 00:17:03,572
Scott: if they if you actually had to manage all the stuff individually instead of just Dump all your equipment in the box and then go crafting.

246
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:05,640
Scott: I would not have gotten anywhere in this game.

247
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:06,818
Scott: I would have been like fuck this shit.

248
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,344
Rym: Yep That's the kind of thing like.

249
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:11,034
Rym: that's the kind of nonsense in Stardew Valley that just keeps.

250
00:17:11,054 --> 00:17:14,039
Rym: I keep bouncing off of that game hard I guess never deal with it.

251
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:17,238
Scott: I never you know after I've seen it and I'm just never even gonna try it.

252
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:19,747
Scott: but Some of you do like Stardew Valley.

253
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:26,625
Scott: there are some of our listeners in our discord who have been playing it multiplayer Starting around, you know week ago.

254
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,051
Rym: Yeah, they're not like you could get in on this.

255
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,280
Scott: Yeah, it's cuz it's vacation times, right?

256
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,818
Scott: So I'm sure they would be happy to play with you fellow listener.

257
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:37,868
Scott: Multi-value multiplayer Stardew Valley go.

258
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:41,300
Scott: Yeah, or if there's any other game you want to get going on come to our discord.

259
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:42,488
Scott: Try to get a game going on.

260
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:51,060
Rym: So in some really brief news I want to briefly review the overwatch winter wonderland nonsense because they always do these themed events.

261
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,311
Rym: They'll like be special games in the arcade like the non ranked modes.

262
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:56,117
Rym: Like there's a summer games thing.

263
00:17:56,137 --> 00:18:02,314
Rym: There's a winter thing There's a Halloween thing but they added some games and kind of change things up in the winter game.

264
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:11,826
Rym: and one thing I've noticed with all these sort of arcade modes is that they're making sometimes radical game design changes and Experimenting a lot in there.

265
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:20,300
Rym: and the quality of these games the reason I bring this whole thing up are Actually getting really high just in the last year.

266
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,070
Rym: Like they've started to find some gold with alternative modes.

267
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:31,678
Rym: and the mode in particular that if you're interested in game design I think you should look at is the freeze tag mode that they added.

268
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:34,327
Rym: Uh-huh It's a four on four versus pick a kid.

269
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:39,960
Rym: pick any characters you want like whatever and the game is just if you kill a They're frozen.

270
00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:47,736
Rym: You can unfreeze someone by standing next to him and holding use for like four seconds And when one team's completely frozen you win the round.

271
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:48,420
Rym: it's best of three.

272
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:53,080
Scott: It's not just pick the deep when you just pick the DPS character to freeze people faster.

273
00:18:53,582 --> 00:19:02,133
Rym: Ah, so, uh, if you win if your team wins a round all the characters You used are now banned for you for the rest of this match.

274
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:05,270
Rym: Oh We picked the four great characters.

275
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:06,215
Rym: now what now?

276
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:06,900
Rym: what fuckers?

277
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,540
Scott: Well, hopefully well, but oh, but if you lose you can keep using them.

278
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,980
Scott: Yes, so in the basically in the first battle, everyone's got the same four great character.

279
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,789
Scott: See, that's the other team wins don't?

280
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,020
Rym: because the characters are all pretty well balanced.

281
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:22,146
Scott: Like well, you might.

282
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,919
Scott: you might also do it like a tug-of-war where you have your anchors.

283
00:19:25,324 --> 00:19:26,398
Scott: Yeah, you put them at the end.

284
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:29,951
Scott: But you point is you know, whichever team is like better.

285
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:38,662
Scott: right if a team is like, oh, you know doing better They lose their characters and then maybe that'll balance out and the other team will get some wins Similar

286
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:44,060
Rym: to how a gun game was often balanced where as you get further along you get crappier and crappier weapons

287
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:46,656
Scott: And then you get your last kill with the knife for

288
00:19:46,696 --> 00:19:47,120
Rym: the grenade.

289
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:51,187
Scott: It's hard to get that last kill with the knife Like you're the best player in the universe.

290
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:53,356
Scott: all these shitty players still have m4 m4s.

291
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:02,059
Scott: Yeah, you got your knife now But you're running at it with your knife and they just hose you down over and over and over Even though even though you're way better than they are you're already on knife.

292
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:08,729
Rym: But you know so funnily enough Overwatch added a gun game mode in that arcade a while ago And it is also like fantastic.

293
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:10,660
Scott: How many guns are in overwatch?

294
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,980
Rym: Well, the way it works is every time you have to get a kill with every character.

295
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:21,537
Rym: No, that makes and the last character is the like entirely healing character that has like a little pistol and nothing else.

296
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:28,582
Rym: Yeah But they randomized the order of the rest of the characters along the way which leads to some interesting Bottlenecks.

297
00:20:28,642 --> 00:20:33,239
Rym: like a lot of people hit the sniper and just can't get past the sniper and they sit there the whole game sniping.

298
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,671
Scott: Mmm Make sense.

299
00:20:35,732 --> 00:20:43,160
Rym: Yeah But I just if you haven't played like if you play overwatch competitively and you haven't looked in that like casual area in a while.

300
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:50,790
Rym: There is some like really good game design in that casual arcade part of overwatch But I think a lot of people are sleeping on that.

301
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,936
Rym: You should not sleep on.

302
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:52,740
Rym: they're fantastic.

303
00:20:54,021 --> 00:21:02,760
Scott: Well, you know, this is just sort of like an extension of what you had and say the counter-strike world Mods right and there was to be like they've like Pokemon server or some shit.

304
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:09,411
Rym: Yeah, or the world the Wow, my counter-strike was the one that always Unnerves me the most in server.

305
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:14,340
Scott: Yeah, there'd be stuff like that But this is like same thing only made by the people who made the game.

306
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:19,339
Rym: It's like if only professional modders and they're only giving you the best they think they've got.

307
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:27,780
Scott: It would be cool though if the there was also community mods somehow but also polished right and not just you know top-down.

308
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,574
Rym: Yeah, the trick is there's a lot of trickiness, you know, you think about like dota.

309
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:33,120
Scott: dota was community mod, right?

310
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,887
Scott: Oh, you can you can make.

311
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:37,219
Scott: it was unpolished as hell and it still is.

312
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:41,995
Rym: Yeah, you can make custom servers up to a point that are pretty customizable.

313
00:21:42,096 --> 00:21:46,774
Rym: But yeah beyond that I don't know if I'm not interested in what the community would make just yet.

314
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:58,120
Rym: I Remember what happened to TF 2 with the mods tribes to tribes - I said TF 2 because I have a web page open with TF 2 because I was gonna talk about that in our main bed.

315
00:21:58,742 --> 00:22:02,195
Rym: But anyway, it's time for things of the day.

316
00:22:02,216 --> 00:22:03,179
Rym: So check this.

317
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,626
Rym: Mario paint was a game.

318
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:18,788
Rym: I was obsessed with getting when I was a kid because even in the SNES era I was deep in PC gaming and what always pissed me off about games like Sim City on the SNES Was that mouse didn't have a mouse?

319
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:22,040
Scott: I was just playing some a little bit at Sim City for like a minute.

320
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,047
Scott: I'm a Mac plus over here.

321
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:26,877
Rym: Oh, I have this weird urge to play Sim City 2000 again.

322
00:22:28,641 --> 00:22:29,124
Scott: Yeah, me too.

323
00:22:29,606 --> 00:22:29,847
Scott: Too bad.

324
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:30,510
Scott: It's not multiplayer.

325
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:30,731
Rym: Nope.

326
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:32,880
Rym: I don't think it would be good multiplayer.

327
00:22:33,342 --> 00:22:34,647
Rym: You know, how do you play that multiplayer?

328
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:37,879
Rym: You just both play single-player and after an hour you compare your cities.

329
00:22:38,881 --> 00:22:40,799
Scott: I'll be on cheetah mode in that way.

330
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:50,081
Rym: so, uh Mario paint was the Super Nintendo game that came with the Super Nintendo Mouse.

331
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,287
Rym: so I was fucking upset.

332
00:22:52,608 --> 00:22:57,100
Rym: I remember like I was that was like top of my Christmas list of mom.

333
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:57,767
Rym: Just give me this game.

334
00:22:57,787 --> 00:22:58,555
Rym: That's all I want.

335
00:22:58,595 --> 00:22:59,020
Rym: is this game?

336
00:22:59,404 --> 00:23:08,388
Rym: I want nothing else But the Mario paint because my kid brain thought that the mouse would work with any SNES game where that would make sense Which obviously is not true.

337
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:15,455
Rym: Not true, but Mario paint was Fantastic for its era.

338
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:20,132
Rym: like that Was a weird thing for Nintendo to put out on the Super Nintendo.

339
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:22,660
Rym: and you might think but friend get a computer.

340
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:25,720
Rym: Yeah, computers were not great at things back then.

341
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:33,879
Rym: Mario paint was actually better than a lot of the like kid drawing software you would ever have access to on a PC.

342
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:40,900
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you think about it, it's like Mario Right at the time Mario paint came out, right?

343
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,008
Scott: What were you gonna have for drawing software on your computer?

344
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,014
Scott: basically MS paint Mac paint.

345
00:23:46,275 --> 00:23:48,582
Scott: right that like, you know What was there?

346
00:23:48,622 --> 00:23:50,588
Scott: there was like print shop deluxe.

347
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:55,687
Rym: or you want to make music unless you have pirated like cakewalk studio You got nothing.

348
00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:57,480
Scott: Did that exist in 1992?

349
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:06,159
Scott: I don't know when cakewalk even came out, but you know, you'd be making music with like, you know Commodore 64 MIDI stuff right in that time, you know stuff like that.

350
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:22,236
Rym: Yeah, so I guess 92 a little bit later than that, but Mario paint basically had baby's first music making program coupled with baby's first drawing program and baby's first Animation where you could like make legit animations like this Mario paint.

351
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:23,059
Rym: There was a lot going on.

352
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:30,561
Scott: But what could you if you tried to use a computer from 1990 even 1993 like a 386?

353
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:38,899
Scott: Yeah, yeah that at 386 or like an a Mac like LC or something like that Maybe a Mac quadra that kind of if you're drawn in logo is the listener just pointed out?

354
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:40,228
Scott: Yeah, I could be like Matt.

355
00:24:40,248 --> 00:24:47,312
Scott: It would be like Mac OS 7 I think 7 or 8 maybe around that time Probably 7 something it's like.

356
00:24:47,593 --> 00:24:52,232
Scott: yeah, you could do some stuff But first of all those computers would cost thousands and thousands of dollars.

357
00:24:52,714 --> 00:24:53,256
Rym: I can't walk.

358
00:24:53,276 --> 00:24:54,360
Rym: came out for DOS in.

359
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:58,025
Scott: Okay, not bad.

360
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:00,474
Rym: Holy shit this DOS interface.

361
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,625
Rym: Oh my god I've never seen the cake.

362
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:17,205
Scott: Mario paint definitely was a thing where the Absolute power of it was not that high but within the constraints it provided, you know Computationally, right?

363
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:18,048
Scott: They made.

364
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:26,165
Scott: they were able to make a vastly superior user interface Within which you could still do a lot, right, you know.

365
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:32,769
Scott: and because it was easier you could you know, even though it was Computationally less powerful.

366
00:25:33,771 --> 00:25:39,750
Scott: Someone who is you know a kid could do more in Mario paint than they could do and like Photoshop, right?

367
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:45,269
Scott: If you gave that same kid, you know today's Photoshop, they probably wouldn't be able to do as much with it.

368
00:25:45,852 --> 00:25:52,861
Scott: You know, yeah year old right an eight-year-old could probably make better music and better animation in Mario paint than they could in.

369
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:56,777
Scott: you know after effects or Garage band or whatever.

370
00:25:56,958 --> 00:26:00,010
Rym: the Mario paint also lets you save your drawings.

371
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,482
Rym: You could save your big drawing you could save your animation.

372
00:26:02,502 --> 00:26:02,723
Scott: You could.

373
00:26:02,743 --> 00:26:04,170
Scott: you ran out of save space eventually.

374
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:05,233
Rym: No, it was.

375
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:07,841
Rym: you can only save one drawing one song.

376
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:10,930
Rym: Yeah, and one and at a safe space, so it wasn't safe space.

377
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,400
Rym: It was whatever you had.

378
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,930
Rym: is what you had when you log back in.

379
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:24,105
Rym: So, uh, it only had 32 Kilobytes of save RAM and an astute person this YouTube channel bushy tail is where they are.

380
00:26:24,366 --> 00:26:29,150
Rym: this person actually like Thought about this and wondered what would happen and tested it.

381
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:45,708
Rym: I don't think anyone ever like thought of this before but they basically figured out that all the pixels combined and all the like the minimum possible footprint of All the files that you could make in this game is way more than 32 kilobytes.

382
00:26:46,551 --> 00:27:06,496
Rym: So the game definitely had to be doing some compression on these images which oh so you yeah yeah, so what they did is they Tried to make images and animations with as much entropy as possible to see if they could make something that Mario Paint could not save.

383
00:27:07,117 --> 00:27:10,292
Rym: and they were successful in doing this and make sense.

384
00:27:10,653 --> 00:27:19,369
Rym: Mario Paint actually had logic to detect and handle this and this is a video of Exactly what happens if you try to save?

385
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:30,330
Rym: Mario Paint when there is too much entropy to compress your images and the little robot Animation just gives up and says data overflow and plays a special sound and then the game crashes.

386
00:27:31,353 --> 00:27:36,930
Scott: My best memory of Mario Paint, even though I did not own a Super Nintendo at the time and did not own Mario Paint.

387
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:45,847
Scott: I played it at a kid's house who had it and we and we made an animation of MC hammer, but it was only his pants dancing.

388
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:52,310
Scott: Whoo It's just it was just two legs with with big balloon pants, you know doing like, you know dancing back and forth.

389
00:27:52,715 --> 00:28:00,650
Rym: I made a lot of like Mario World Levels with like Mario jumping around and picking up a Yoshi and stuff and of course fly swatting game, right?

390
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:08,939
Rym: Yep fly swatting game which existed solely to teach people how to use a mouse because Nintendo was worried that people Who bought this game had never encountered a mouse before.

391
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:09,741
Scott: it's the same thing.

392
00:28:09,781 --> 00:28:18,340
Rym: Microsoft made solitaire for the same reason and the best part Of this video is there's not many comments like 400 But not many people care about this.

393
00:28:18,742 --> 00:28:24,644
Rym: but at the very bottom There's a comment that says wait, that's the origin of the bot and his song.

394
00:28:24,764 --> 00:28:26,450
Rym: I thought it was from Mario maker.

395
00:28:29,411 --> 00:28:34,310
Scott: Okay, so also a Nintendo thing of the day, I don't know if I've used this before I don't remember it.

396
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,260
Scott: This is actually a video that was the videos from 91.

397
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,989
Scott: So around I guess before Mario Paint, right?

398
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,153
Scott: and The.

399
00:28:42,273 --> 00:28:43,521
Scott: it was uploaded to YouTube in 2009.

400
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:50,280
Scott: So And it has millions of views But I don't remember seeing it until recently.

401
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:51,665
Scott: so there you have it.

402
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:56,661
Scott: and what this is it's a video That Nintendo of America right and people got to remember.

403
00:28:56,681 --> 00:29:01,596
Scott: Nintendo of America mostly is concerned with you know Marketing and distribution.

404
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:04,509
Scott: They don't really make the games there or anything, right?

405
00:29:05,313 --> 00:29:07,848
Scott: it always has been that way sales right that sort of thing.

406
00:29:07,868 --> 00:29:16,590
Scott: and It was a video that Nintendo of America made in the early 90s for retailers, right because you weren't buying shit online.

407
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,948
Scott: you were buying all the shit at the store Toys R Us department store, right.

408
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:24,523
Scott: and It was for retailers who didn't know shit about.

409
00:29:25,025 --> 00:29:26,290
Scott: you know, video games, right?

410
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:34,582
Rym: They're just selling them and back when retail would like provide services like help you pick something describe explain how something works teach you how to use the thing right.

411
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:49,621
Scott: and it was to educate retailers about technical support for Nintendo products because if somebody had a tech support problem with a Nintendo product in the early 90s and they were not Technologically inclined what the fuck were they gonna do right?

412
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:50,824
Scott: My Nintendo doesn't work.

413
00:29:51,185 --> 00:29:52,970
Scott: Who are they gonna call, right?

414
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:53,350
Scott: Are?

415
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,123
Rym: there was a number in the back of every Nintendo game annual like?

416
00:29:57,143 --> 00:29:59,350
Scott: there were no cell phones, right?

417
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,579
Scott: You were calling on your regular landline phones.

418
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:03,205
Scott: I'm like 800 number, right?

419
00:30:03,526 --> 00:30:05,474
Rym: There was the Nintendo Line.

420
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:10,290
Scott: Yeah, there was no Google though, right that you could search for answers, right?

421
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:17,243
Scott: A lot of people were just gonna take their shit back to the store and try to return it and get a new one or Some shit like that, right?

422
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,868
Scott: Rather than try to figure it out.

423
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:25,330
Scott: And plus back in those days like hooking stuff up to a TV wasn't just an HDMI cable, right?

424
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,462
Scott: Some guys got need some like RF adapter.

425
00:30:27,502 --> 00:30:28,789
Scott: Who knows what you needed back then?

426
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:36,465
Rym: Well, you needed an RF adapter unless you were the fanciest motherfucker And then you could plug RCA directly into those ports on the side of the NES.

427
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:37,550
Scott: That's right.

428
00:30:38,475 --> 00:30:56,490
Scott: But yet first of all in this video you're seeing Nintendo's training with these actors pretending to be stupid customers or not always stupid customers, but you know exaggerated customers Or extremely hell or the the far too knowledgeable and too skilled retail employees.

429
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:03,350
Scott: And just you know, it's to educate retailers about what they should do how they should handle customers.

430
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,548
Scott: You try to bring Nintendo products in with problems and whatnot, right?

431
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:16,361
Scott: But also in this video, right you're sort of seeing this unrealistic Retail setup where like there's this wall of NES games.

432
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:21,206
Rym: That's actually literally what the store I went to looked like and I was about to say.

433
00:31:22,153 --> 00:31:28,597
Scott: The only thing unrealistic about that is not that there is a wall of NES games It's only that the wall is so clean and organized.

434
00:31:28,898 --> 00:31:29,179
Rym: Yeah,

435
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:41,114
Scott: right when I would go to Toys R Us back in the day There was a wall of paper slips, yeah little pictures of the box as you would take the paper slip to this booth They had and that was

436
00:31:41,154 --> 00:31:44,824
Rym: like bulletproof glass and there was the wall of actual games in there.

437
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:52,849
Scott: cuz in that booth was Literally Nintendo games of every Nintendo game just in stacks piled to the seat.

438
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:57,707
Rym: even worse Somehow if there were no paper slips under a game you wanted that game was sold out.

439
00:31:57,808 --> 00:32:13,303
Rym: Fuck you Yep, but we always went and asked anyway like Each one of those cartridges was 50 late 80s early 90s dollars, you know ish 50 Stacked and they were stacked to the ceiling.

440
00:32:13,343 --> 00:32:14,930
Scott: There was a lot of money in that booth.

441
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,220
Scott: That's why they didn't just leave them out.

442
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:17,450
Scott: You had to get the piece of paint, right?

443
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,894
Scott: I remember toys the games.

444
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:22,467
Rym: there were $30 games, but that was like Hogan's Alley.

445
00:32:22,948 --> 00:32:33,768
Rym: there were $45 games was like the normal games 45 or 50 and then 60 to 70 was like hot game on release like Zelda 2 or Mario 3.

446
00:32:33,768 --> 00:32:41,885
Scott: and The worst thing was that you know in those days You know nowadays shovelware is like, you know, the shovelware still exists.

447
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:42,627
Scott: it existed then.

448
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:49,936
Scott: it existed before Nintendo did see what shovelware did to the Atari and reduced it significantly By not licensing it.

449
00:32:50,318 --> 00:32:52,789
Scott: but there was still a lot of bad games out there.

450
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:55,770
Rym: Yes, actually probably had more shovelware than the NES.

451
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:01,044
Scott: Maybe probably but you know shovelwares today you can tell.

452
00:33:01,164 --> 00:33:02,750
Scott: and also it's a dollar, right?

453
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:08,252
Scott: It's not a big deal if you accidentally buy a shovelware and the NES if you bought a shovel where that was 50 bucks down The toilet.

454
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:13,354
Rym: Yeah, that's why our kids the smart kids went to blockbuster and rented games first That's right.

455
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:27,130
Scott: or in a later era the funko land also known as free babysitting Yes, but hey This I just want people who weren't alive then to see that, you know the pew that beautiful, you know wall that wall.

456
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:41,420
Rym: I can smell some of these images I can smell the inside of It said it still boggles my mind to like - this must be what people who like were born before Electricity felt like.

457
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,997
Rym: when there's electricity everywhere Like I just think back to like.

458
00:33:45,037 --> 00:33:49,090
Rym: this was my literal reality and what it was like to live in that world compared to this world.

459
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,967
Rym: Yep In the meta moment, we're stuck at home.

499
00:36:02,862 --> 00:36:11,490
Rym: It is hard to express to you out there especially if you were younger than us how Fucking amazing this decade has been for gaming.

500
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:20,088
Rym: This is a gaming a decade where the Wii U came and went where the 3ds came and went Counter-strike go appeared.

501
00:36:21,517 --> 00:36:32,540
Rym: Yeah PC gaming the renaissance of PC gaming began at the very beginning of this decade and Turned into a PC gaming like Platinum Age.

502
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,190
Rym: This is the greatest PC gaming era in human history hitherto.

503
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:42,706
Rym: Mmm the true the Nintendo switch like changed the paradigm of what a console is.

504
00:36:42,726 --> 00:36:46,150
Rym: the Wii U try several It's already several years old.

505
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:52,870
Rym: It doesn't even feel like it but it's old Like I was trying to think back like what happened in the 2010s in gaming and everything.

506
00:36:53,212 --> 00:37:01,190
Rym: We could make a geeked-out podcast for a year That was just talking about the 2010s of gaming and we would not have come did it for 10 years.

507
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,378
Rym: We did do it for 10 years.

508
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:04,230
Scott: You could just listen to all these episodes.

509
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:06,789
Rym: We could have done more episodes in these 10 years.

510
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:09,636
Scott: The point is is that at the in 20 2009 2010?

511
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:11,181
Scott: What did gaming look like, you know?

512
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,236
Scott: It looked like then?

513
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:18,732
Scott: I'm pretty sure it was Xbox 360 Right.

514
00:37:18,812 --> 00:37:22,186
Scott: Yeah, was it regular DS not 3ds, right?

515
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:25,720
Scott: Yes to not come out yet I don't think 3ds was quite.

516
00:37:26,021 --> 00:37:28,010
Rym: I was looking at 2010 in video games.

517
00:37:28,132 --> 00:37:29,129
Rym: Look at me look at the website.

518

Rym: the Wii was out.

520
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,391
Scott: the Wii was a thing because the Wii was late 2000.

521
00:37:34,391 --> 00:37:36,664
Scott: So the Wii was stills at its and its strength.

522
00:37:36,785 --> 00:37:40,101
Rym: the Wii was strong But it was in its long decline.

523
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:43,113
Rym: like everyone knew Nintendo had something coming Right.

524
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:44,859
Scott: the the Wii was there.

525
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,605
Scott: the regular DS was there.

526
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:53,201
Rym: the the ps3 Slim came out at the end of the previous decade 2009.

527
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:54,444
Rym: Yeah, right ps3 Xbox 360, right?

528
00:37:56,891 --> 00:38:01,646
Scott: And at this time, you know forget all the things that have happened between then and now.

529
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:07,545
Scott: right at that moment It was actually like sort of just.

530
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:15,608
Scott: it wasn't exactly the beginning But like it was still the early times of just indie video games period right.

531
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:18,977
Scott: the Xbox Was like the before that.

532
00:38:19,098 --> 00:38:21,223
Scott: obviously the indie games have always existed right.

533
00:38:21,243 --> 00:38:27,670
Scott: there have been games from non major publishers But that Xbox indie marketplace that is gone exactly.

534
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:36,395
Scott: That was not a thing and PC games were hard to run and weird team didn't have seem just didn't let anyone Fucking put their games on Steam.

535
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:39,524
Scott: right, you know, it wasn't like there wasn't this?

536
00:38:39,926 --> 00:38:42,114
Scott: the itch I/O didn't exist That's for sure.

537
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:44,125
Scott: It's not that I'm aware of a lot of indie games.

538
00:38:44,185 --> 00:38:46,014
Rym: I played in the 2000s.

539
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,529
Rym: the knots were like here's an exe file from the internet.

540
00:38:50,312 --> 00:38:55,550
Scott: Right exactly if you in deep video games where someone made a game and they're selling it on their own.

541
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:03,110
Scott: Right that Xbox marketplace was like the first time That you could in a like on a major platform.

542
00:39:03,812 --> 00:39:06,884
Scott: Pretty much anyone could get their game up there and get it for a sale.

543
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:12,543
Scott: and we were seeing the games You know coming out like, you know, I guess the early ones like the braid.

544
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:15,718
Rym: braid was right at the end of 2009.

545
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:20,210
Scott: right You see like your Monaco right we saw that it packs a whole bunch.

546
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:22,243
Rym: We saw that it packs many many many times.

547
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:24,335
Rym: I still have those diamonds Right.

548
00:39:24,355 --> 00:39:25,002
Scott: Oh, yeah, right.

549
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:31,179
Scott: Yeah You know, I guess what else was coming out around then.

550
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:37,639
Scott: but like it was still like these early days where people starting to be Like hey, I made a video game all on my own.

551
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:38,100
Scott: What was?

552
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,766
Scott: it was half-minute hero was one of those.

553
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:43,435
Rym: Oh, yeah, that game was Phenomenal right.

554
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:46,550
Scott: It was like people just made a game out of nowhere on their own.

555
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:50,865
Scott: Yeah, and because they were had this plat is store to sell it on.

556
00:39:51,428 --> 00:39:58,310
Scott: it's like oh Well, you can actually sort of like make money making a game on your own if you're lucky and it becomes a huge hit.

557
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:04,430
Scott: Most of them won't but that became a thing and for the rest of the decade we are now in a place where?

558
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,299
Scott: Especially thanks to steam the Xbox one died.

559
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:10,430
Scott: but like on switch you get shit.

560
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:13,201
Scott: Nowadays, like fucking kit, you know.

561
00:40:13,563 --> 00:40:14,366
Scott: cadence of fire.

562
00:40:14,507 --> 00:40:16,073
Scott: Oh, yeah I krypto.

563
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:20,507
Scott: the necro dancer wasn't a thing in 2010 and now cadence of Hyrule and 20 in 2020. is that you know?

564
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,380
Rym: I'm gonna say, you know what happened in the 2010s this decade.

565
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,413
Rym: it destroyed the concept of game genres like.

566
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:34,045
Rym: it's the concept still there but We there were so many genre breakers and new genres that formed that.

567
00:40:34,086 --> 00:40:46,657
Rym: I still is the Concept of genres that are really strong But there are there's a lot more of them and there's a lot more games that are described as it's this genre and this genre mixed.

568
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:50,377
Rym: yes Before that, right?

569
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:55,536
Scott: We have also seen several genres Die or wane, right?

570
00:40:55,576 --> 00:40:59,890
Scott: So the biggest the biggest death has been the MMORPG at least the classical kind.

571
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,334
Rym: I think the grindy kind is right.

572
00:41:02,354 --> 00:41:04,398
Scott: the Final Fantasy 1. and what's that other one?

573
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:05,640
Scott: people are playing the Chinese one?

574
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,765
Rym: That Doesn't narrow it down It's that one.

575
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:11,590
Scott: That's like a big hit.

576
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,119
Scott: the action II won I forget.

577
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,555
Scott: Regardless, you know, it's like the the World of Warcraft style MMO.

578
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:19,137
Scott: Like is it 100% dead?

579
00:41:20,241 --> 00:41:21,003
Scott: No, of course not.

580
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:23,612
Scott: They still there but it's like in 2010.

581
00:41:23,612 --> 00:41:25,639
Scott: Like it was like there was a Lord of the Rings MMO.

582
00:41:27,222 --> 00:41:30,796
Scott: It was like so many MMOs, you know, the Elder Scrolls one.

583
00:41:30,816 --> 00:41:31,739
Scott: is that one still exist?

584
00:41:33,223 --> 00:41:33,567
Rym: Contact?

585
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:34,860
Scott: were there two Star Wars ones?

586
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:35,525
Scott: I don't even know.

587
00:41:35,646 --> 00:41:47,000
Rym: the end of the previous decade I my primary PC was Linux on the desktop and I was playing like Wii games And I was mostly tabletop and PC games DS games.

588
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,680
Rym: PC gaming was not in a great shape because Team Fortress 2 had come and was not good.

589
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:56,000
Rym: Like Left 4 Dead 2 was one of the last hurrahs of the end of that decade.

590
00:41:57,041 --> 00:42:03,860
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you look at our 20 are our video game episodes from 2010 a lot of them were about old games.

591
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,035
Scott: The only major PC game I see is like Civ 5.

592
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:11,231
Rym: Yeah But then as you scroll through more episodes, we did like.

593
00:42:11,692 --> 00:42:18,252
Scott: we're talking about a lot of interesting games Right, you know 2011 this half-minute hero Rock of Ages.

594
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:20,399
Scott: That was another early indie game, right?

595
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,046
Scott: You know Super Meat Boy another one.

596
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:26,791
Scott: that was 2011 right up.

597
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:29,179
Scott: and now finally Super Meat Boy forever comes out.

598
00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:30,739
Scott: now He just came out.

599
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,704
Rym: So another big.

600
00:42:31,744 --> 00:42:35,160
Rym: before we do I want to jump around to a lot of different places before we go deep into anything.

601
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:46,996
Rym: another big change tabletop Exploded in multiple ways like D&D over this decade coalesced into fifth edition, which for all its problems It's probably the best D&D.

602
00:42:48,263 --> 00:42:51,334
Scott: Yeah, I mean D&D itself had a lot of ups and downs.

603
00:42:51,454 --> 00:42:53,160
Rym: fourth edition was just a nightmare.

604
00:42:54,141 --> 00:43:13,259
Scott: Yeah, what we've seen I think as a whole is the emergence of the watch people play an RPG Usually D&D not always though online which led to this Interested in playing the games that didn't exist at all in 2010, even though it could have.

605
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,608
Rym: yeah It should have.

606
00:43:14,688 --> 00:43:19,299
Scott: we're stupid fine sight But now it totally exists in is huge.

607
00:43:20,046 --> 00:43:26,320
Rym: There are several people to do it But look at the beginning of 2010 we have Luke and Jared on the show like in July.

608
00:43:26,722 --> 00:43:28,252
Rym: We have them on multiple times.

609
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:32,849
Rym: talking about indie RPGs We start like we were really diving in indie RPGs.

610
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:37,140
Rym: the indie RPG scene has really come into its own in this past decade.

611
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:40,718
Rym: There are so many top tier indie RPGs out there.

612
00:43:41,684 --> 00:43:48,747
Scott: Yep, I think it still hasn't managed to Like chip away at these sort of like.

613
00:43:48,768 --> 00:43:49,711
Rym: no, you know what I think happened.

614
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:53,143
Rym: the whole space expanded because the space had contracted for A long time.

615
00:43:53,223 --> 00:43:56,520
Rym: I think RPGs table top RPGs expanded overall.

616
00:43:56,881 --> 00:44:02,739
Rym: So D&D grew a lot but indie RPGs also grew a lot relative to where they were.

617
00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:09,210
Scott: Right, but I think in terms of percentage of the pie I don't like D&D is still in.

618
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:14,067
Rym: the RPGs are a smaller percentage of the pie But a larger absolute number.

619
00:44:14,187 --> 00:44:18,740
Rym: more people are making enough money doing indie RPGs to make indie RPGs.

620
00:44:19,806 --> 00:44:34,898
Rym: Yes, indeed It's still not a like healthy ecosystem, but it's growing rapidly and it's growing in absolute numbers Even if D&D is still the black monolithic elephant with With a flurry of blows in the room, right?

621
00:44:35,602 --> 00:44:46,705
Scott: And the other thing I think that the story of regular tabletop in the 2010s I think is absolutely got to be like very heavily tied to the story of the Kickstarter board game the Kickstarter.

622
00:44:46,926 --> 00:44:59,426
Rym: like it the Kickstarter caused a renaissance of like Unknown designers and indie games coming out, but it also caused a glut of shovelware relative to other products.

623
00:44:59,727 --> 00:45:00,549
Scott: project types.

624
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,479
Scott: board games are like one of the biggest on Kickstarter.

625
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:09,835
Scott: like this Disproportionate money for board gaming projects to like movie funding projects, right?

626
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:14,689
Scott: Even though they're both valid uses of Kickstarter And we saw early in the decade.

627
00:45:14,729 --> 00:45:15,713
Scott: What do I see here?

628
00:45:15,793 --> 00:45:24,664
Scott: on GeekNights, right like Eminent domain and like some other, you know games that were like some of the early Kickstarter games, right?

629
00:45:24,684 --> 00:45:26,950
Scott: Yeah now it's like friggin.

630
00:45:27,231 --> 00:45:30,400
Scott: every board game is some sort of Kickstarter thing.

631
00:45:30,581 --> 00:45:38,083
Scott: You know, they're all you know, the whole industry is about making you know giant game with a bunch of extras in it and all kinds of Course.

632
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:44,720
Rym: the decade that bubble grew and kind of burst right is definitely I think is is definitely deflating now.

633
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:50,959
Rym: Finally, I at least I hope it is it seems to be but what's rising now is the like the industry.

634
00:45:50,979 --> 00:45:52,244
Rym: god There's a lot of shovelware.

635
00:45:52,264 --> 00:45:54,171
Rym: There's a lot of the last one year.

636
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:59,719
Scott: It's playing games online and digitally instead Which already it's always existed.

637
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:05,600
Scott: But it was never like good enough and you wouldn't do it because you could just play games in person, right?

638
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:14,166
Scott: but now it's getting better and also the pressure of not being able to play games in person is actually Finally pushed that up.

639
00:46:14,406 --> 00:46:30,205
Rym: But the other thing I've seen accelerate massively in this past decade was People who are more casual and more mainstream tabletop gamers playing the kinds of games that in the previous decade They would never encounter in their lives Like root.

640
00:46:30,265 --> 00:46:43,334
Rym: absolute is that there's a lot of games that are a good example But roots probably most well-known one root got a lot of people to try Grognard wargame mechanics without realizing it and definitely feel like at the start of the decade.

641
00:46:43,394 --> 00:46:50,596
Scott: It was like, okay, you know Settlers has managed to get its way into the hands of a lot of people right Catan.

642
00:46:50,616 --> 00:46:55,126
Scott: Yeah carcass Kind of well-known Right, but we're out here.

643
00:46:55,186 --> 00:46:57,393
Scott: We're playing, you know, right?

644
00:46:57,413 --> 00:46:58,937
Scott: I don't know fucking.

645
00:46:59,118 --> 00:46:59,800
Scott: what was out then.

646
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,549
Rym: Let me look like how to be came out in 2010.

647
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:05,790
Rym: I Remember we gave fucking talks at PAX.

648
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:09,906
Rym: is we were like check this shit out Like we talked about how to be like.

649
00:47:09,966 --> 00:47:16,127
Rym: no one had ever made a game like that before because there weren't really games like you A show on Hanabi.

650
00:47:16,147 --> 00:47:17,492
Scott: I think it was later than that.

651
00:47:17,733 --> 00:47:18,796
Rym: It came out in 2010.

652
00:47:18,796 --> 00:47:19,940
Rym: We didn't do show on it right away.

653
00:47:20,222 --> 00:47:21,569
Scott: We did it in 2013.

654
00:47:21,569 --> 00:47:24,662
Rym: seven wonders came out in 2010 Right.

655
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:28,620
Scott: It's like we were in the seven wonders zone when everyone else is in the Catan zone, right?

656
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,005
Scott: That's like Tudor own horn here.

657
00:47:30,025 --> 00:47:33,620
Scott: It's just because we've been playing settler since 2000 just due to luck and circumstance.

658
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:39,825
Scott: Yeah and privilege obviously but the So we're just ahead of people.

659
00:47:39,885 --> 00:47:47,507
Scott: but now I feel like the mass board gaming, you know gaming world has Absolutely caught up.

660
00:47:47,647 --> 00:47:51,400
Scott: It's like, you know, you're Azul's your roots, right?

661
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,544
Scott: You're a pandemic.

662
00:47:52,585 --> 00:48:01,357
Rym: they move like they were like carcass settlers was Barely expanded or extended market like not mass market, but not core niche market anymore.

663
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:06,980
Rym: by the end of the day Those games are all like expanded market and settlers as mass market.

664
00:48:07,542 --> 00:48:11,880
Scott: Yeah, you go to Target now and it's like the games are there right there.

665
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,731
Scott: They are just in the store the real, you know, the real games.

666
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:18,866
Scott: and in the store all the normal people go Right, not the nerdy people.

667
00:48:19,006 --> 00:48:23,460
Scott: Yeah, there are still obviously even nerdier games that are the kinds that we're playing.

668
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,002
Rym: Well, look at us.

669
00:48:24,183 --> 00:48:27,073
Rym: We're always pushing deeper and further away from the masses.

670
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:35,473
Scott: That's why we're playing train games, obviously But it's like when tickets a ride came out and we were playing it like a whole bunch in College that game would blow people's minds.

671
00:48:35,494 --> 00:48:38,999
Scott: when we brought it to the table We played tickets a ride in college a whole bunch.

672
00:48:39,741 --> 00:48:43,709
Scott: And it's like ticket to ride is not only not completely dead it's still around.

673
00:48:43,729 --> 00:48:53,049
Scott: and now I think ticket to ride is just like on the shelf in the toy store if there is toys rest is gone, but Any store that it still exists.

674
00:48:53,069 --> 00:49:00,819
Scott: It's like tickets a ride is just like, you know Probably out there just like whatever if all the families are buying it who aren't even you

675
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:10,493
Rym: know I would say the tabletop gaming ecosystem and industry Evolved Modernized and became mature over the course of this decade in a way that had never been before.

676
00:49:10,955 --> 00:49:12,580
Rym: but that meant some casualties.

677
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:14,586
Rym: There were big consolidations.

678
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:16,171
Rym: a lot of publishers went under.

679
00:49:16,592 --> 00:49:17,635
Rym: there was not like that.

680
00:49:17,715 --> 00:49:19,240
Rym: The whole industry has consolidated.

681
00:49:20,882 --> 00:49:22,207
Rym: There aren't that many publishers?

682
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:25,397
Scott: no, not too many and we're losing.

683
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:32,060
Scott: we're losing more Hasbro just gobbling everything up just like the tabletop RPGs.

684
00:49:32,562 --> 00:49:37,440
Rym: This wasn't like oh the indie games ate away at the mass market like the book that the long-running games.

685
00:49:37,801 --> 00:49:40,268
Rym: it was that the entire space got bigger like Magic.

686
00:49:40,308 --> 00:49:43,898
Rym: the Gathering kept trucking along bigger than ever and it's just still going.

687
00:49:43,918 --> 00:49:47,808
Rym: and Magic did not lose people to all these other games.

688
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:51,400
Rym: There's just more people playing tabletop games everywhere.

689
00:49:52,441 --> 00:49:55,629
Rym: Yep, so the the convention scene changed a lot.

690
00:49:55,649 --> 00:50:03,011
Rym: like packs went from the big thing in Seattle to like the Industry-dominating event over the course of that decade packs.

691
00:50:03,092 --> 00:50:06,023
Rym: The first PAX East was in 2010.

692
00:50:06,023 --> 00:50:09,840
Scott: Yep, we did like five really been the decade of packs, right?

693
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,867
Scott: It's like that's barely was like we went.

694
00:50:11,947 --> 00:50:14,496
Scott: our first packs isn't like oh, oh, eight eight.

695
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:14,978
Scott: Oh nine.

696
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:15,560
Scott: We went away.

697
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:16,900
Rym: No nine and then pack.

698
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:19,451
Rym: We're doing a PAX East.

699
00:50:19,672 --> 00:50:21,340
Rym: Will you come and do panels?

700
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,728
Scott: Packs wasn't mega until like 2013 2014.

701
00:50:24,728 --> 00:50:25,029
Scott: Yeah, it was.

702
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:25,992
Scott: wasn't even selling out.

703
00:50:29,864 --> 00:50:32,185
Scott: Yeah, exactly It wasn't.

704
00:50:32,225 --> 00:50:34,840
Scott: until a few years in and that so this has been the decade of packs.

705
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,948
Scott: Well, so PAX Unplugged came into existence.

706
00:50:37,008 --> 00:50:39,157
Scott: South and East came into it and Australia.

707
00:50:39,418 --> 00:50:43,122
Rym: every packs That's not PAX West came into existence Exactly.

708
00:50:43,162 --> 00:50:45,350
Scott: They did not exist in the previous decade.

709
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:46,233
Scott: They just weren't there.

710
00:50:46,253 --> 00:50:56,699
Rym: and you can see in our personal lives Right at the end of the decade We hard pivoted away from all the cons that were in gaming cons and went to a lot of gaming cons mostly packses But also magfest.

711
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:04,659
Scott: Yep See what else was like the huge thing going on in this decade, right?

712
00:51:06,822 --> 00:51:07,525
Rym: I mean I can talk about.

713
00:51:07,545 --> 00:51:09,132
Rym: you can go deep into a bunch of areas.

714
00:51:09,193 --> 00:51:11,763
Scott: I'm just but yeah, obviously so I mean personally right.

715
00:51:11,783 --> 00:51:15,877
Scott: so my personal pattern of gaming right is in the early part of the decade.

716
00:51:15,917 --> 00:51:16,660
Scott: What was I doing?

717
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,488
Scott: You know, I was playing mostly.

718
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:20,902
Scott: I would get games for my Wii or DS Yeah, you know.

719
00:51:20,943 --> 00:51:40,594
Scott: and I beat them or not play them all forget they existed somehow Like the other day I was watching I think was a few maybe months ago Actually, I was watching someone speedrun Wario where for the Wii and that Wario where just Wario shake it for the Wii I think and I was like, I feel like I've seen this game.

720
00:51:41,115 --> 00:51:42,520
Scott: I don't I don't remember it.

721
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,600
Scott: It's like it but I seen it and it's like I had it for the Wii.

722
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:49,159
Scott: I think I played it and beat it and then whenever played it again, right?

723
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,980
Rym: But like at the end of the previous decade table-top wise I like it was only playing old retro games and tabletop games.

724
00:51:56,101 --> 00:52:01,516
Scott: I wasn't playing a lot of video games and right Wasn't playing a lot of video games early in the 2010s at all.

725
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:05,597
Scott: I was just you know, I'd play these mega games like, you know, Mario Galaxy, whatever.

726
00:52:05,617 --> 00:52:10,589
Scott: when it came out I beat it and be done with it and now Occasionally Civ V came out.

727
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:12,497
Scott: I played my DS before I went to bed.

728
00:52:12,578 --> 00:52:13,080
Scott: stuff like that.

729
00:52:14,521 --> 00:52:26,076
Rym: Yeah, but as the decade went on what really the thing that my personal journey of gaming the strongest one is that the multi-class Competitive team-based FPS which had been dead.

730
00:52:26,216 --> 00:52:31,072
Scott: one of them Dead Team Fortress 2 genre.

731
00:52:31,092 --> 00:52:32,960
Scott: there was one game that you played.

732
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:34,088
Rym: There were a lot of.

733
00:52:34,129 --> 00:52:38,451
Rym: there were multiple games in that genre But they were all variants on a theme and it was just kind of dead.

734
00:52:38,812 --> 00:52:40,298
Rym: Team Fortress 2 came out.

735
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:40,880
Scott: What other?

736
00:52:42,525 --> 00:52:43,900
Scott: Team Fortress 2 came out last decade.

737
00:52:44,252 --> 00:52:56,099
Rym: Yeah He came out and wasn't great and then and and even then those games were only popular among like people who are obsessed with that Specific narrow area of gaming like that was not common for people to play those games.

738
00:52:56,421 --> 00:52:59,860
Scott: TF 2 is for people very guy was really popular and people were playing it with the hats.

739
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:03,352
Rym: Yeah When TF 2 came out it was like the audience that played.

740
00:53:03,392 --> 00:53:05,620
Rym: TF 2 was not the audience to play those older games.

741
00:53:06,102 --> 00:53:15,178
Rym: Overwatch brought back a type of game that had been pretty much dead and Even in its heyday was not widely played and made it mass-market.

742
00:53:16,222 --> 00:53:18,027
Rym: Mmm, this was the decade.

743
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:22,700
Rym: the second half of this decade was the decade of actually finally stealing from the Forgotten Masters.

744
00:53:22,881 --> 00:53:32,114
Rym: This was the decade where all the forgotten genres and forgotten games someone with money said I'm gonna pay some people to make a game that does this thing because there aren't any.

745
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:35,426
Rym: if we just make it someone will play It no one will compete with us.

746
00:53:35,908 --> 00:53:42,090
Rym: and we see that across like all gaming Mm-hmm dead genres was revived.

747
00:53:42,672 --> 00:53:45,000
Scott: Yeah, we didn't get the Pokemon MMO, but we got Pokemon go.

748
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,795
Scott: Pokemon itself does have more multiplayer internet stuff now than it ever has.

749
00:53:49,815 --> 00:53:50,196
Scott: Yeah.

750
00:53:50,237 --> 00:53:56,195
Scott: Yeah in the past Even though it's not the full MMO that you would imagine right in like this perfect cyber world.

751
00:53:56,215 --> 00:53:59,448
Rym: I still imagine that that's the only unrealized potential.

752
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:04,920
Scott: that is egregious, but the You know, so I started out, you know, just playing some Nintendo games, right?

753
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,834
Scott: I guess is playing some of those indie games in the Xbox that I had for a while.

754
00:54:07,874 --> 00:54:08,337
Scott: They got rid of.

755
00:54:08,618 --> 00:54:19,140
Scott: right and tabletop wise it's like in 2010 early 2010s We were going to like, you know tabletop game night and playing, you know, a Puerto Rico with some people.

756
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,250
Rym: We just I mean nerd NYC was a thing kind of that.

757
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:26,642
Rym: those events all kind of died over the course of the 2010s Right.

758
00:54:26,662 --> 00:54:32,146
Scott: We were doing those, you know, sort of smaller time board game meetup things And I saw that trend kind of.

759
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:38,767
Rym: generally though like smaller board game need meetups declined as the decade went on For a lot of what happened.

760
00:54:38,807 --> 00:54:44,569
Scott: to me personally the reason I abandoned them it was because I spent Four to five years playing netrunner.

761
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:48,523
Rym: you did you went deep in the netrunner just like I would Right.

762
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:50,630
Scott: So netrunner was a was a huge game.

763
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:52,816
Scott: Can I think 2013 is when it started?

764
00:54:52,897 --> 00:54:59,400
Scott: I want to say I'm guessing I feel like 2013 through slate 17 and I've sort of waned off towards.

765
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,439
Rym: I remember you'd go to a netrunner meetup and I would go to nerd NYC and play like German games.

766
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:10,857
Scott: Well, well cuz netrunner was just a great game that I discovered but also there was activity around it right enough of it.

767
00:55:11,298 --> 00:55:20,025
Scott: and also You know it was like hey instead of going to a board game meetup where I'll play who knows what game and I'll play one game all Night with some drunken people.

768
00:55:20,045 --> 00:55:23,960
Scott: I don't know I can play this game which keeps changing.

769
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:32,913
Scott: It is really dynamic interesting and deep with people that all know the rules and I'll own the game and I'll really want to play It a lot right and are on a weekly.

770
00:55:32,974 --> 00:55:34,400
Scott: some you know, there was at the peak.

771
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,389
Scott: We were having like a you know tournaments ever like.

772
00:55:36,429 --> 00:55:36,871
Scott: it was big.

773
00:55:36,911 --> 00:55:38,920
Scott: there were two tournaments a month and shit going down.

774
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,640
Scott: It was like very active and then it sort of you know tapered off over time.

775
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,150
Scott: But yeah that occupied a lot of my time.

776
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:46,916
Scott: that one game and now okay.

777
00:55:46,937 --> 00:55:47,820
Scott: I don't need to go back to that.

778
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:55,040
Rym: I'm good That isn't that decade cuz by two like in in my younger days there would be like one game usually a competitive game.

779
00:55:55,341 --> 00:56:00,780
Rym: That would dominate all my multiplayer play and I'd like focus on that game and play a lot of single-player games.

780
00:56:01,661 --> 00:56:06,540
Rym: That came back for both of us in the past decade because I like went crazy for overwatch.

781
00:56:06,621 --> 00:56:11,100
Rym: I still kind of play overwatch like every day To the exclusion of a lot of other online games.

782
00:56:11,461 --> 00:56:16,480
Rym: But at the beginning of the decade I did that too because counter-strike go came out at the beginning of the decade.

783
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:23,860
Rym: Bringing back counter-strike and making it like honestly counter-strike go is probably the second best counter-strike.

784
00:56:24,801 --> 00:56:28,074
Scott: Probably I think one six Pokemon go came into existence.

785
00:56:28,114 --> 00:56:28,858
Scott: I think I mentioned that are.

786
00:56:28,878 --> 00:56:31,586
Rym: yeah Ingress came and went in that time, too.

787
00:56:32,508 --> 00:56:33,571
Rym: I found our review of it.

788
00:56:33,631 --> 00:56:36,720
Rym: We're basically what I my exact words were don't play it.

789
00:56:36,801 --> 00:56:38,620
Rym: It's a candy box sure.

790
00:56:40,284 --> 00:56:43,924
Scott: We saw a lot of All the jackboxes.

791
00:56:43,964 --> 00:56:44,928
Scott: that's all 2010s.

792
00:56:45,329 --> 00:56:46,051
Scott: right that there was.

793
00:56:46,071 --> 00:56:52,053
Scott: I mean there was the original you don't know jack in the 90s Right, but 2010s jackbox, right?

794
00:56:52,114 --> 00:56:54,984
Scott: Yeah, it's a totally different new Revolutionary thing.

795
00:56:55,004 --> 00:56:55,506
Scott: that's been.

796
00:56:56,027 --> 00:57:01,337
Rym: they figured out how to make web sockets kind of just work and no one seems to have mastered this Except them, right?

797
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:12,393
Scott: obviously 2010s phone games right there are phones in late 2000s But smartphones weren't like I said in a tech episode were not huge.

798
00:57:12,634 --> 00:57:20,816
Rym: I think the 3ds was the last Like super small portable console because phones completely displaced that entire market.

799
00:57:21,017 --> 00:57:24,348
Scott: smartphone adoption It was the thing of the 2010s.

800
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:27,320
Scott: and thus games on the smartphones.

801
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:30,548
Scott: The Candy Crush might be the game of the decade.

802
00:57:30,588 --> 00:57:31,612
Scott: honestly, right.

803
00:57:31,772 --> 00:57:34,620
Scott: if you think about it, I don't you know, it's close All right.

804
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,592
Scott: What else would even be close on the on the list in terms of like.

805
00:57:37,813 --> 00:57:39,660
Scott: you have to pick one game to represent the whole?

806
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:43,404
Scott: Decade for the population of humanity That's like.

807
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:44,369
Scott: that might be it.

808
00:57:44,691 --> 00:57:49,255
Rym: Yep, but that like the 3ds I think was the last small console that normal people would play.

809
00:57:49,617 --> 00:57:55,174
Rym: and the 3ds Had its ups and downs in this decade like the local Nintendo's bad at that.

810
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:57,807
Scott: Yep, it was still huge though.

811
00:57:58,128 --> 00:57:58,830
Rym: It was huge.

812
00:57:59,252 --> 00:58:01,900
Rym: The 3d thing obviously didn't matter, but the console itself was fine.

813
00:58:02,322 --> 00:58:03,848
Rym: But now look what happened.

814
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:06,400
Rym: We've seen this the the industry is segmented into.

815
00:58:07,702 --> 00:58:15,338
Rym: There's basically two consoles that are just gaming PCs That compete with each other pretty much with time limited exclusives that will usually be on Steam.

816
00:58:15,378 --> 00:58:20,181
Rym: eventually There's PC gaming Which is continuing to grow in a big way Like.

817
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:26,104
Rym: I'm so happy the PC gaming is so big again for a lot of reasons that we've talked about Over the entire decade.

818
00:58:26,745 --> 00:58:27,848
Rym: and then there's Nintendo.

819
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:40,830
Rym: Nintendo is doing its own thing and the switch is like this perfect marriage of form and function That I think Nintendo found their niche and I doubt they will do anything that does not switch like any time in the foreseeable future.

820
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:51,973
Scott: Well Nintendo saw you know, the Wii U go poop and they're like, hey, we need to make something right that in an era right where Someone can buy a computer and someone has a phone.

821
00:58:51,993 --> 00:59:03,699
Scott: Yeah, right if someone has We think that a person someone has a computer and a phone we need to make a device that they will buy in addition to those two things.

822
00:59:05,752 --> 00:59:13,171
Scott: And And so they do it right and I think Nintendo's obvious real advantage There is sort of you know, like it just.

823
00:59:13,372 --> 00:59:21,980
Scott: not only is the switch hardware, you know So unique in providing, you know features that and experiences you couldn't get on normal hardware right more commodity hardware.

824
00:59:22,561 --> 00:59:26,953
Scott: It's that they still have their Mario's their Zelda's and all those games.

825
00:59:27,073 --> 00:59:31,533
Scott: Yeah, it's 100% exclusive to their platform You know, so.

826
00:59:34,746 --> 00:59:44,229
Rym: But the other thing they did is With breath of the wild they like broke the concept of what an open-world game could be for everyone who's ever made one up to that point.

827
00:59:46,203 --> 00:59:54,660
Rym: Other notable big things from the decades Sports went from only nerds care to more watch than the Super Bowl.

828
00:59:55,454 --> 00:59:55,800
Rym: That's true.

829
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,108
Rym: Like that is that people aren't like people.

830
00:59:58,128 --> 00:59:59,191
Rym: I don't think realize.

831
00:59:59,271 --> 01:00:05,619
Rym: younger kids already do not seem to realize that Esports didn't fucking exist in the previous decade in any meaningful way.

832
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:08,109
Scott: No, not in a meaningful way, right?

833
01:00:08,129 --> 01:00:09,695
Scott: There's like what fatality is quick.

834
01:00:09,715 --> 01:00:15,376
Rym: Yeah, like fatality That's one of the only eSports people people could name from that era and even a quick people do a Starcraft.

835
01:00:16,601 --> 01:00:18,553
Scott: Yeah, it was Starcraft and quake and that was pretty much it.

836
01:00:18,734 --> 01:00:19,660
Scott: Yeah now it's everything.

837
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,349
Scott: See I think other notable things right.

838
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:32,400
Scott: so obviously most recently we've had trained games because of one website But that's just I think a larger in our eyes because we're deep into that and grander scheme.

839
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,729
Scott: It's not actually that big but it is.

840
01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:36,977
Scott: it's it's grown proportion to its previous.

841
01:00:37,017 --> 01:00:47,940
Rym: We've seen Digital implementations of board games become good when previously they were often shitty and Become kind of the most common way.

842
01:00:48,121 --> 01:00:56,793
Rym: Someone will learn to play a popular board game as they'll play it on an app first on their phone or tablet Learn the rules and then move on to playing it with people like.

843
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:57,375
Rym: that's a thing.

844
01:00:57,435 --> 01:00:58,620
Rym: That wasn't a thing before.

845
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:03,256
Scott: We've seen the roguelike become a bigger deal in the 2010s, right?

846
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:07,092
Scott: So many wrote, you know roguelike you should just be net hack.

847
01:01:07,112 --> 01:01:09,060
Scott: Yeah now it's everything but that's it.

848
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:09,621
Rym: That's another.

849
01:01:09,662 --> 01:01:11,747
Rym: it's like rogue like the cons.

850
01:01:11,787 --> 01:01:19,531
Rym: the things that made rogue interesting mashed into some other genre in some Escape rooms are a big thing.

851
01:01:19,571 --> 01:01:20,940
Scott: if you consider those to be a game.

852
01:01:21,043 --> 01:01:30,640
Scott: Yeah Then many escape rooms like are still a thing now Right, like they've actually been able to sort of hold on to their power in whatever form they take tabletop digital or physical.

853
01:01:31,285 --> 01:01:33,260
Scott: They're all the same sort of same sort of, you know.

854
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:42,920
Rym: I think that's part of a broader trend where we're in the era where people who are around our age Who actually started going out and making games and founding studios and like doing this stuff?

855
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:51,650
Rym: So the people who grew up wanting more games and had access to games and were deep into that games Like we have this like second generation of people making those games now.

856
01:01:51,811 --> 01:01:54,600
Scott: Yep, the roll and write game became a thing.

857
01:01:54,822 --> 01:01:57,740
Scott: It's I think it's sort of faded a little bit But there are some recent entry.

858
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:05,903
Rym: Well, it kind of really turned into a bubble where there were like ten of them published in one like one month I remember like yeah There was it.

859
01:02:05,944 --> 01:02:06,326
Scott: there was an.

860
01:02:06,366 --> 01:02:07,773
Rym: I mean Yahtzee was a rollin right.

861
01:02:07,813 --> 01:02:09,120
Rym: Yahtzee's been around for a while.

862
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:17,552
Rym: The rollin rights were not played by people who weren't playing old weird games like Yahtzee with their families until this decade.

863
01:02:18,217 --> 01:02:21,611
Scott: right Phenomenon wise goose game was just huge.

864
01:02:21,732 --> 01:02:21,933
Scott: right.

865
01:02:21,973 --> 01:02:23,360
Scott: talking about the indie games, right?

866
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:26,676
Scott: Starting with the braids we went from braid to goose game, right?

867
01:02:26,717 --> 01:02:36,160
Scott: So You know because I was when I started talking about the indie game, you know revolution of the 2010 So I was mostly thinking about where he came from, but it's like yeah, we got to goose game.

868
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,956
Scott: That's where we are now where something like that is now just known by everybody.

869
01:02:40,036 --> 01:02:40,940
Scott: Everyone knows this game.

870
01:02:41,741 --> 01:02:42,445
Scott: Everyone played that.

871
01:02:42,746 --> 01:02:43,771
Scott: is there anyone who didn't play it?

872
01:02:44,032 --> 01:02:44,233
Scott: No one.

873
01:02:44,274 --> 01:02:44,937
Scott: listen to the show.

874
01:02:44,957 --> 01:02:45,460
Scott: I doubt it.

875
01:02:45,741 --> 01:02:55,718
Rym: I think we though did see the rise and then fall Like kind of hard fall of a lot of rhythm games like rhythm games had a lot of trouble.

876
01:02:55,758 --> 01:03:00,000
Rym: this decade DDR kind of disappeared from non like crazy.

877
01:03:01,283 --> 01:03:08,260
Scott: Rhythm games have bounced back to a more like, you know, but they're more like tablet tapping type rhythm games.

878
01:03:08,481 --> 01:03:10,170
Scott: No, well some of them are but it's like.

879
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:14,720
Scott: DDR itself has like sort of you know Come off the ground and written gone to a plateau, right?

880
01:03:15,021 --> 01:03:15,663
Scott: You can get that.

881
01:03:15,683 --> 01:03:18,711
Scott: there is that there is the main current DDR machine.

882
01:03:19,232 --> 01:03:21,980
Rym: it exists, right but there aren't our where.

883
01:03:23,222 --> 01:03:27,135
Scott: No, well, there are some but it's it's not where it was in the 2000s where?

884
01:03:29,982 --> 01:03:32,340
Scott: You could get everyone had plastic instruments, right?

885
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:42,070
Rym: Yeah Like in the very beginning the decade like decade like Rock Band 3 was like the hottest game get dance pads at the store Just normally, right?

886
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:45,084
Scott: It's like that stuff was all 2000s 2010s.

887
01:03:45,425 --> 01:03:50,056
Scott: everyone threw out their plastic instruments shit and only hardcore people had like.

888
01:03:50,297 --> 01:03:54,193
Rym: people like it like DDR Enthusiasts have special DDR pads.

889
01:03:54,294 --> 01:03:56,664
Rym: No one else plays DDR It has.

890
01:03:56,745 --> 01:04:00,720
Scott: the genre is sort of stable at this like level, right?

891
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,940
Scott: It's probably equal to like the train game situation.

892
01:04:02,961 --> 01:04:04,905
Scott: Yeah, right We're only only.

893
01:04:04,945 --> 01:04:09,220
Scott: the train games are going up from where they are and the rhythm games are going down from where they were.

894
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:10,143
Scott: But they're.

895
01:04:10,685 --> 01:04:28,005
Rym: you know, it's a niche thing that's holding steady and there has a community and it's there though there are a small number of Rhythm game crossed with something else getting back into that genre mixing stuff like pistol whip is a rhythm rail shooter Mmm.

896
01:04:28,025 --> 01:04:28,990
Scott: Oh speaking of which right?

897
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:33,560
Scott: It's like yeah, you're you know, wow I'm not a big fan of VR and I was gonna bring this up last.

898
01:04:34,461 --> 01:04:41,879
Rym: Yeah has not reached the art level but VR is like legit expanded market gaming.

899
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:50,226
Scott: now Yeah, VR is you know, pretty much like yeah people talk it used to be just like oh There's like VR.

900
01:04:50,247 --> 01:04:57,680
Scott: you can buy VR for a zillion dollars in this one game And now it's sort of like alright if you got a pile of money you can play Star Wars in VR.

901
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,509
Scott: Yeah, there's a whole bunch of VR games.

902
01:04:59,549 --> 01:05:01,017
Scott: Star Wars was I think the side

903
01:05:02,161 --> 01:05:14,108
Rym: Between Star Wars and the quest to because the quest in the quest to where you can do VR without a gaming PC and Without a bunch of nerd shit like putting the sensors on the walls It'll just work and they're really popular.

904
01:05:14,128 --> 01:05:18,680
Rym: like this VR is more accessible than high-end PC gaming right now.

905
01:05:19,981 --> 01:05:23,118
Rym: Probably Oculus Quest 2 cost way less than a low-end gaming PC.

906
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:29,680
Rym: Sure, but my VR is sort of like I have a valve index that is for nerds.

907
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:41,186
Rym: But Star Wars was probably the first game that was a like expanded market like edging into but not quite mass-market.

908
01:05:41,206 --> 01:05:45,428
Rym: like this game was launched and They just said you know what it works with VR.

909
01:05:45,489 --> 01:05:48,280
Rym: if you have VR any VR headset, it just works.

910
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,149
Rym: We designed it for that, but you don't need it.

911
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,594
Rym: Hmm and that is a big side.

912
01:05:53,635 --> 01:05:57,151
Rym: the next decade I think we're gonna see VR by the end of next decade.

913
01:05:57,192 --> 01:05:58,557
Rym: VR will be mass-market.

914
01:05:58,618 --> 01:06:08,847
Scott: if the world is not It depends right if it remains an expensive thing that is a big fat thing you got to put on your head and But it's already not you could like.

915
01:06:08,907 --> 01:06:12,159
Rym: the quest is cheap and doesn't need a gaming PC.

916
01:06:12,821 --> 01:06:14,528
Rym: It costs less than some gaming consoles.

917
01:06:14,989 --> 01:06:15,993
Scott: How much does it cost?

918
01:06:16,214 --> 01:06:17,840
Rym: let me see the quest one is real cheap.

919
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:18,973
Scott: It's cost more than a ps5.

920
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:21,328
Rym: probably less than a ps5.

921
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:23,668
Rym: Quest 2 is 300 bucks.

922
01:06:23,769 --> 01:06:24,718
Rym: It's way less than a ps5.

923
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,820
Scott: No, that's not too bad, but it's still quite a bit to spend for something with so few games.

924
01:06:30,881 --> 01:06:32,637
Rym: I think that much more than a switch, and there's a.

925
01:06:33,963 --> 01:06:38,020
Scott: But how many games does a switch have right versus how many games the VR games are there?

926
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:42,364
Rym: Yeah, that's why I'm saying by the end of this coming decade well It depends right.

927
01:06:42,384 --> 01:06:48,509
Scott: so I'm saying if it VR in order for VR to sort of you know It's got upwards momentum for sure right where it.

928
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:54,807
Scott: you know before it was just like a nothing like people were really Stretching reaching for it right it's like this could be for this could be virtual boy.

929
01:06:54,827 --> 01:06:56,170
Scott: You're buying here with your money, right?

930
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:58,118
Rym: Now it kind of just works.

931
01:06:59,341 --> 01:07:06,466
Scott: It's not virtual boy - it's definitely reached like I think maybe PSP territory right where it's like It's gonna have a lot of games.

932
01:07:06,526 --> 01:07:06,987
Scott: It's not gonna.

933
01:07:07,028 --> 01:07:08,553
Scott: Just die right.

934
01:07:08,634 --> 01:07:10,039
Scott: It's like it's useful.

935
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:16,800
Rym: well But even more the studios are all like currently researching to break their big games in the coming decade.

936
01:07:17,001 --> 01:07:21,433
Scott: Yeah, but unlike the PSP there is platform enthusiasm for VR.

937
01:07:21,493 --> 01:07:26,490
Scott: right software developers working on it and such right You know pretty much across the board except for Nintendo.

938
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:27,574
Scott: right pretty much play.

939
01:07:27,594 --> 01:07:29,040
Scott: You know everyone's into VR, right?

940
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:40,854
Scott: Yeah, I'm trying to make things for it But I think unless it really it needs like another big bump or two in terms of price down tons of more games

941
01:07:41,056 --> 01:07:41,559
Rym: which is

942
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:42,702
Scott: What

943
01:07:42,722 --> 01:07:54,556
Rym: what is lacking at the end of this decade is a large enough ecosystem of studios that have mastered the craft of making VR games and mastered the UX and like like the How the game

944
01:07:54,576 --> 01:07:54,880
Scott: works?

945
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:56,321
Scott: It could.

946
01:07:56,341 --> 01:08:01,060
Scott: but the point is if it doesn't get you know one or two boosts it could be could still go down.

947
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,586
Rym: Right those boosts are dead.

948
01:08:02,606 --> 01:08:04,273
Rym: that R&D is already there.

949
01:08:04,354 --> 01:08:05,900
Rym: those games are already in flight.

950
01:08:06,281 --> 01:08:11,600
Scott: I don't feel like the end of 2030. we could either be saying like VR almost made it.

951
01:08:12,123 --> 01:08:13,110
Scott: No, it didn't make it.

952
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,599
Scott: They got to try again a third time.

953
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,899
Rym: Start displacing some other games by the end of this coming decade.

954
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:21,225
Scott: Not too confident about that.

955
01:08:21,345 --> 01:08:22,408
Rym: I am very confident.

956
01:08:22,429 --> 01:08:23,111
Scott: go either way.

957
01:08:23,212 --> 01:08:24,555
Scott: Yes, you know you bought a VR.

958
01:08:24,596 --> 01:08:25,479
Scott: That's why you're confident.

959
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:31,960
Scott: Person who buys the wine rights likes it no matter what it tastes like.

960
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:37,395
Rym: Now the question is selling like crazy to normal people in fact like crazy.

961
01:08:37,456 --> 01:08:38,379
Scott: How many is it selling?

962
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:38,500
Rym: well?

963
01:08:39,124 --> 01:08:39,870
Rym: More than we use.

964
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:40,453
Scott: how many sell?

965
01:08:40,474 --> 01:08:41,139
Scott: more than we use?

966
01:08:41,881 --> 01:08:45,356
Rym: I definitely sold more than we use because the Wii U did sell more than we use.

967
01:08:45,636 --> 01:08:46,460
Scott: how many did it sell?

968
01:08:46,741 --> 01:08:47,444
Rym: It's still selling.

969
01:08:47,464 --> 01:08:48,669
Rym: We don't have the holiday numbers yet.

970
01:08:49,352 --> 01:08:51,319
Scott: Yeah, how many we use sold?

971
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:55,553
Rym: Why we both saw that chart on we use 101 million.

972
01:08:55,654 --> 01:08:57,139
Scott: We you know that was wheeze.

973
01:08:57,843 --> 01:09:00,676
Rym: Yeah, I was about to say I was gonna say I was like.

974
01:09:00,718 --> 01:09:03,126
Scott: that's not The we use.

975
01:09:03,267 --> 01:09:05,618
Rym: so quest 2 appears to be approaching 10 mil.

976
01:09:08,011 --> 01:09:09,100
Scott: Oh, that's we you games.

977
01:09:11,622 --> 01:09:12,526
Scott: I saw this recently.

978
01:09:12,586 --> 01:09:13,852
Scott: how many we use were sold.

979
01:09:13,892 --> 01:09:15,538
Scott: It was like it was some millions, right?

980
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:19,848
Scott: Total we sold.

981
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:20,352
Scott: I don't know.

982
01:09:20,795 --> 01:09:21,479
Scott: yeah millions.

983
01:09:22,142 --> 01:09:30,064
Rym: The question was here is to have sold to millet around launch and is tracking to hit 10 mil like oh Yeah, any man.

984
01:09:30,106 --> 01:09:32,015
Scott: so the number of we use sold by the end.

985
01:09:32,055 --> 01:09:32,738
Scott: It was like 5 million.

986
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:41,406
Rym: All right, so the projected quest 2 numbers by next by sometime next year is double that 10 million we used.

987
01:09:41,446 --> 01:09:43,192
Rym: that's that's the best number I can find.

988
01:09:43,232 --> 01:09:46,465
Rym: they sold out 2 million at launch And then they ran.

989
01:09:46,524 --> 01:09:47,509
Rym: it couldn't make more.

990
01:09:47,569 --> 01:09:48,353
Rym: like they were sold out.

991
01:09:48,433 --> 01:09:50,060
Rym: people couldn't get him right.

992
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:56,480
Scott: well The Wii U was a failure, so it has to do Million more in next year, that's a that's a better.

993
01:09:56,621 --> 01:09:57,225
Rym: That'll match.

994
01:09:57,245 --> 01:09:58,151
Scott: so that so 2 million.

995
01:09:58,192 --> 01:10:01,249
Rym: it launched 3 million next year In the first in the first year.

996
01:10:01,269 --> 01:10:09,995
Scott: basically All right, so it's not a complete bomb like the Wii U. But you need a lot more than that to be like a smash right here.

997
01:10:10,076 --> 01:10:11,040
Rym: It's not a smash.

998
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:16,760
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely like nice to attend when it's and it's a will it be tens of millions, right?

999
01:10:17,441 --> 01:10:22,620
Scott: You know they need to make some development that will get that number to the tens of millions and not just the ones.

1000
01:10:22,741 --> 01:10:32,280
Rym: I think that is one more Iteration of the hardware that does not require a gaming PC being better because if you have a gaming PC VR is already there.

1001
01:10:32,742 --> 01:10:35,095
Rym: But that's not what most people are gonna interact with.

1002
01:10:35,115 --> 01:10:40,500
Rym: they're gonna react with these Standalone systems that just work without having to do any gamer nerd nonsense.

1003
01:10:41,504 --> 01:10:52,020
Rym: There is some evidence Whereas I'm poking around that The those non PC tethered VR kits are selling to people who don't otherwise have gaming systems.

1004
01:10:52,946 --> 01:10:53,470
Scott: It makes sense.

1005
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:54,740
Scott: why would you if you have a gaming system?

1006
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:55,564
Scott: Why would you buy?

1007
01:10:55,845 --> 01:10:56,006
Scott: right?

1008
01:10:56,046 --> 01:10:58,620
Scott: if you have a gaming system you also want to get your use out of it, right?

1009
01:10:59,123 --> 01:10:59,633
Scott: Yeah, why would you?

1010
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,302
Rym: So but I think it's.

1011
01:11:01,402 --> 01:11:01,542
Rym: it's.

1012
01:11:01,763 --> 01:11:15,795
Rym: it's one more iteration of the inside-out tracking hardware for non PC gamer enthusiasts coupled with like two studios Releasing multiple games over the next several years like real games like full-on games.

1013
01:11:16,176 --> 01:11:17,460
Rym: We need like five more games.

1014
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:18,858
Rym: They're on a level of half-life Alex.

1015
01:11:19,785 --> 01:11:20,440
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

1016
01:11:21,461 --> 01:11:36,100
Rym: So, yeah, that was there anything else big time that happened in the 2010s, I think it's pretty much story is that gaming has become Hugely important to culture and society and as an industry has grown massively.

1017
01:11:37,282 --> 01:11:38,106
Rym: There's more players.

1018
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:39,110
Rym: There's more makers.

1019
01:11:39,773 --> 01:11:44,160
Rym: the one bad thing But this is not new the same thing was happening in the previous decade.

1020
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:51,602
Rym: The industry is unsustainable in terms of like crunch and working practices and capital Right.

1021
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,829
Scott: Also your your gamer gate was in the 2010s.

1022
01:11:53,889 --> 01:11:57,160
Rym: That was a gamer harassment like exploded.

1023
01:11:57,281 --> 01:11:57,725
Rym: But that's more.

1024
01:11:57,785 --> 01:11:59,901
Rym: we'll talk about that more on Thursday I think.

1025
01:12:00,162 --> 01:12:02,710
Rym: well that is all in the a brigade was not the thing.

1026
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:06,060
Rym: that was just the like trial run for what really happened.

1027
01:12:06,842 --> 01:12:13,040
Scott: Sure, but I think what has happened is on the one hand right the both the the bad.

1028
01:12:13,581 --> 01:12:30,093
Scott: You know people in this world right got stronger and you know went to war right and but also You can view it in the other way and that aha the good people weren't just sitting around taking it anymore You know just letting letting the status quo maintain.

1029
01:12:30,274 --> 01:12:30,474
Rym: like.

1030
01:12:30,575 --> 01:12:30,936
Rym: look at.

1031
01:12:31,016 --> 01:12:39,611
Rym: look at how Blizzard has handled harassment issues in their games in this decade Compared to how any fucking company handled that in the previous decade.

1032
01:12:40,052 --> 01:12:40,514
Rym: They went.

1033
01:12:40,614 --> 01:12:52,205
Rym: the companies are increasingly doing as much of the right thing as they can with like banning first and asking questions later taking reports seriously building reporting and Accountability systems into their games.

1034
01:12:52,587 --> 01:12:56,420
Scott: It's not fully developed yet if I could think make an analogy, right?

1035
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,212
Scott: Basically, there's been this like wasp hive on the porch.

1036
01:12:59,574 --> 01:13:00,960
Scott: It's just been there, right?

1037
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:07,034
Scott: It's just been sitting there this whole time and every time you leave your house you know you watch out for the wasps and that was the what was in.

1038
01:13:07,074 --> 01:13:08,782
Scott: that was the saddest quo of the 2000s.

1039
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:10,847
Scott: was you just watching out for the wasps?

1040
01:13:11,188 --> 01:13:16,666
Scott: and the 2010s we both tried to get rid of the wasps Actively, right?

1041
01:13:16,686 --> 01:13:19,360
Scott: We didn't six necessary succeed completely, right?

1042
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,022
Scott: But we did get.

1043
01:13:20,183 --> 01:13:23,637
Scott: we got a lot of them, but we also got stung by a lot of wasps.

1044
01:13:23,758 --> 01:13:25,729
Scott: Yep Right, and that was the 2010s.

1045
01:13:25,749 --> 01:13:30,188
Scott: So Hopefully, I'm hope 2020s.

1046
01:13:30,268 --> 01:13:32,357
Scott: We want to see a world where you can walk out on your porch.

1047
01:13:32,417 --> 01:13:34,727
Scott: No wasps That's what we're that's our gaming for.

1048
01:13:34,928 --> 01:13:37,800
Rym: but I think the sad part is I think that is way beyond gaming.

1049
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:42,400
Rym: I think the gay the gamer culture was just sort of a head like that.

1050
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:47,897
Scott: But the games right gaming the gaming community was a particular nexus.

1051
01:13:47,938 --> 01:13:54,720
Scott: that other Community, you know, you know the anime community had its own, you know, but they was much smaller.

1052
01:13:54,760 --> 01:14:08,379
Rym: I think part of the difference is the gaming community where this stuff really like germinated was hypersocial online a little bit ahead of Social media.

1053
01:14:09,282 --> 01:14:17,739
Rym: Yep, like gamers were harassing each other and gamer hate stuff was happening in social media when gaming was still over represented compared to other things in social media.

1054
01:14:18,563 --> 01:14:20,211
Scott: No, all that stuff was 2010s though.

1055
01:14:20,332 --> 01:14:21,075
Scott: Yeah thousands.

1056
01:14:21,377 --> 01:14:23,166
Scott: Not so much Yep 2000s.

1057
01:14:23,226 --> 01:14:28,832
Rym: like harassment was like an Individual person would bother you in a specific game and you couldn't even

1058
01:14:28,872 --> 01:14:32,122
Scott: go play counter-strike and people would say racial slurs Yeah,

1059
01:14:32,203 --> 01:14:32,544

1062
01:14:34,993 --> 01:14:35,917

01:14:35,937 --> 01:14:36,720
Rym: you in real life

1064
01:14:37,564 --> 01:14:38,689
Scott: It was just how it was.

1065

Scott: That was just life in the 2000s.

1066
01:14:40,197 --> 01:14:46,080
