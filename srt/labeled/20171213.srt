1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,674
Rym: It's Wednesday, December 13th, 2017.

2
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:16,160
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,240
Rym: Tonight, the thing that you call Voltron, go lyin'.

4
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:24,408
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,690
Rym: So, uh, I cooked something I've never cooked before, and it was, it was a situation.

6
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,473
Scott: Bugs?

7
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:33,483
Rym: Jellyfish?

8
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:46,068
Rym: When I encountered, when I actually acquired the ingredient and held it in my hands I went online to ask the question of, "How do I tell if this thing is

9
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:46,489
Rym: rotten?".

10
00:00:46,716 --> 00:00:46,870
Rym: Yup.

11
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:50,388
Rym: As in, "Is this what this should look, feel, and smell

12
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:50,630
Rym: like?".

13
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,188
Scott: Daikon?

14
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:52,738
Rym: No, no, no, no, no.

15
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:54,170
Rym: This was black garlic.

16
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:55,930
Scott: Oh, I've had black garlic before.

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,450
Rym: Yeah, I'd had black garlic, but I never encountered it in its raw form before.

18
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,094
Scott: Oh, I've had it.

19
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:00,558
Scott: It's fine.

20
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:01,790
Scott: I've cooked with it.

21
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,638
Rym: Do you know what it is?

22
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:03,630
Rym: Like what the deal is with it?

23
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,810
Scott: It's just like a different garlic species that's infused with something or something like that.

24
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,175
Rym: Nope, nope, nope.

25
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:08,845
Rym: No, nothing.

26
00:01:08,865 --> 00:01:09,210
Rym: Not at all.

27
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:09,790
Rym: All right.

28
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,449
Scott: Black garlic is- I looked it up and then I forgot.

29
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:17,930
Rym: It's regular old garlic that's basically put in a special hot room for months.

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:18,648
Rym: Okay.

31
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,609
Rym: And it sits there slowly turning black and gooey.

32
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,167
Rym: All right.

33
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:29,438
Rym: And it basically breaks down a lot of the garlicky stuff in it, and it makes it much more, like it makes it actually a very different flavor.

34
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,910
Rym: So I made some ramen with it, and it was A plus.

35
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,589
Rym: Yeah, why not?

36
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,690
Rym: And now I'm gonna start cooking with black garlic a little more often.

37
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:37,029
Rym: You gotta get grandpa garlic.

38
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:40,068
Rym: So you can make it yourself- In a hot room?

39
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:56,010
Rym: Yeah, so apparently what a lot of people do is they take, if they buy a new rice cooker, like a Japanese one, because this apparently is very popular in Japan, they'll take the old rice cooker, set it on the warming setting, like they'd cooked some rice, and just put a bunch of garlic in it and let it sit for a few months.

40
00:01:58,091 --> 00:01:58,675
Rym: It's possible.

41
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:01,230
Rym: it'll just rot depending on if you get the temperature right and all that.

42
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:01,788
Scott: You don't say.

43
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,149
Rym: But yeah, black garlic pretty good.

44
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,948
Scott: And that ramen I made was pretty good.

45
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:10,469
Rym: So yeah, that's the most exciting thing that happened to me in the last few days.

46
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,810
Scott: Okay, what exciting happened to me?

47
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,189
Rym: Got anything for an opening bit?

48
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:16,970
Scott: My back hurts, which has never hurt in my whole life.

49
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:24,630
Scott: You know, so many people in the world have back pain so much that, you know, I think back pain is like the biggest scam in the world of like people promising to help you with it.

50
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,450
Rym: Well, because a lot of back pain, there's literally nothing that can be done.

51
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:30,465
Rym: And when a doctor tells you that, some people say, "Oh shit,".

52
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:35,228
Rym: and some people say, "I'm gonna go to an increasingly crazy series of doctors until one of them says

53
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:35,610
Rym: something.".

54
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:37,507
Scott: And then even though they can't actually help you.

55
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:37,870
Scott: But anyway.

56
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:38,853
Rym: Yeah.

57
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:39,960
Rym: Don't go to chiropractors.

58
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,650
Rym: They're faking literally every case.

59
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,529
Rym: Just in case you don't know that.

60
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,563
Scott: Anyway, so this morning I'm just getting ready to go to work, you know, and I think I was like picking up my keys.

61
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:49,390
Scott: Who knows what I forget?

62
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,529
Scott: But like basically my left side moved in a weird way and I felt something go doink.

63
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,570
Scott: And I was like, it felt like did a bone pop out or like a muscle flipped over?

64
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,433
Rym: Welcome to.

65
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:12,947
Rym: I am older than 30 because I feel like when you're under 30, if your back hurts, it's always because like you took an injury and you can say, "Well, when I fell off that mountain, that's why my back hurts

66
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:13,249
Rym: today.".

67
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:13,571
Scott: Yeah.

68
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:21,470
Scott: But anyway, so something in my back left middle area went doink and it's been slightly annoying all day.

69
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,129
Rym: I suspect what'll happen is when you go to bed, because I'm a little older than you.

70
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,270
Rym: Old old man, I'm gonna give you some advice.

71
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,250
Rym: I suspect it's gonna feel worse in the morning and not better.

72
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:30,790
Scott: Maybe.

73
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:34,270
Rym: Because it sounds like you have the same thing that Pete was talking about in the forum.

74
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,559
Rym: So yeah, good luck with that.

75
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:37,890
Rym: I've been there.

76
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,039
Rym: The last time it happened to me, I was laying in bed and I tried to get up in the morning and I can't sit straight up.

77
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,186
Rym: I just can't.

78
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,970
Scott: I mean, I can't sit straight up anyway.

79
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:46,953
Rym: So I like roll out.

80
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:48,259
Scott: I can't basically do a forward sit up.

81
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:55,488
Rym: So I roll on my side, I kind of push myself up and my back's just like, "Yeah, fuck you

82
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:55,789
Rym: today.".

83
00:03:56,572 --> 00:04:00,966
Rym: And then after a week, I just went away and the doctor was like, "Yeah, that happens.

84
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:01,828
Rym: You're over

85
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:02,330
Rym: 30.".

86
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,509
Scott: Well, if it lasts long enough, I'll go to a doctor, but no.

87
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,590
Rym: You know what the doctor said the last time I went to him about a back thing?

88
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,769
Rym: He literally said, and I'm quoting here, "If that keeps happening for a few months, come back

89
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:12,949
Rym: in.".

90
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,728
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

91
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,227
Scott: Yeah.

92
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:16,788
Rym: So you got any news?

93
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:18,290
Scott: I do have a news.

94
00:04:19,653 --> 00:04:21,720
Scott: So we should talk about comics more.

95
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,510
Scott: I'm reading comics more because I'm trying to clear out my comic shelf.

96
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:27,149
Rym: I'm reading comics less because I'm watching a lot more anime and TV.

97
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,760
Scott: I'm trying to get, well, great.

98
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:29,950
Scott: So erudite.

99
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:34,729
Scott: Because my shelf is starting to lean over a little bit.

100
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:38,028
Scott: So I'm trying to read comics.

101
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,470
Rym: I don't want to go over and find you dead under a pile of comics.

102
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,195
Rym: It's possible.

103
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:42,990
Scott: Anyway, I'm trying to read the comics.

104
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,910
Scott: And if anyone doesn't know, there's a guy named Ed Piskor.

105
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:47,580
Scott: I don't know how to say his name.

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,426
Scott: It might just be Piskor.

107
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:48,889
Scott: I don't know.

108
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:50,888
Scott: It's spelled P-I-S-K-O-R.

109
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:57,410
Scott: And he basically went to the Kubert comic school and he partnered up with CZ.

110
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,350
Scott: He's done some work with some pretty famous people.

111
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,609
Scott: And the main comic I know him for is Hip Hop Family Tree, which is this really awesome comic if you've never seen it.

112
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,530
Scott: It basically talks about the history of hip hop until it's like, and the art style is just phenomenal.

113
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:14,719
Scott: So he is now making a comic.

114
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,850
Scott: I couldn't believe that they got him to make this comic.

115
00:05:18,754 --> 00:05:22,290
Scott: It's called X-Men Grand Design, right?

116
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:31,930
Scott: And basically for a Marvel comics, it's incredibly strange for one person to write it, draw it, penciling, coloring.

117
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,049
Scott: He's doing the whole thing because that's what he does.

118
00:05:34,674 --> 00:05:35,863
Scott: Usually get a whole team of people.

119
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:36,569
Scott: He's doing everything.

120
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:44,068
Scott: And it's basically he's going to retell the real X-Men story, the whole thing, right?

121
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:47,690
Scott: With no info, you know, it's not going to tie into anything.

122
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,850
Scott: It's just going to be like, oh, tired of reading all these convoluted X-Men comics.

123
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:53,490
Scott: You know, you just want to read the real X-Men story.

124
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,130
Scott: Here it is all in this one self-contained graphic novel.

125
00:05:57,211 --> 00:05:58,485
Scott: Wait for the trade situation.

126
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,330
Scott: But the first issue comes out or just came out soon.

127
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,994
Rym: I can read that.

128
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:04,589
Rym: I could feel I feel like I could enjoy this.

129
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,332
Scott: It's the thing is like.

130
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:10,990
Scott: I like X-Men so much like the two comics I bought when I was a kid in the 90s buying comics.

131
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,710
Scott: I bought Spider-Man 2099 because it was cyberpunk.

132
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:17,665
Scott: It was Spider-Man, the Spider-Man 2099 asshole.

133
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:23,790
Scott: And it started at number one so I could start and get the whole thing.

134
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,650
Scott: And the other comic I bought was X-Men because I'd started at number one and I was watching X-Men on Fox.

135
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,374
Scott: And that comic, it didn't.

136
00:06:30,414 --> 00:06:36,210
Scott: it wasn't a comic that was like one of those ones that's just retelling the exact episodes in comic form.

137
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:39,990
Scott: But, you know, it was the same characters who look the same, you know.

138
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:40,979
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty bad.

139
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,070
Rym: My continuity was the same.

140
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,350
Rym: It was always, I've tried to find the comics that look the same as the Fox cartoon and that's how I got into X-Men.

141
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,562
Scott: It was it was it was adjectivilist.

142
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:50,850
Scott: X-Men is what it's known as.

143
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,588
Scott: The one where, you know, Jim Lee did the cover for number one or whatever that folded out, right?

144
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:55,950
Scott: That one.

145
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,350
Scott: So those are the two comics I read as a kid and I really like X-Men.

146
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,533
Scott: I like the X-Men characters.

147
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:05,430
Scott: I like the fundamental X-Men story, which I guess we talked about in our last book club a bit.

148
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:09,590
Scott: But it's really hard to read any X-Men now because it's fucked the fuck up.

149
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:13,170
Rym: I mean, what I like to say is that I love everything about the X-Men except reading the comics.

150
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:23,050
Scott: Yeah, so getting Ed Piskor's style going on plus just, you know, retelling the real X-Men story is an excellent day.

151
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,949
Scott: I'll be buying this trade for sure.

152
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,270
Rym: Yeah, so a quick big geek bite because Emily and I had a bunch of friends actually went to see Coco in the theater.

153
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:33,170
Rym: It's actually still in the theaters right now, the new Pixar movie.

154
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,008
Scott: It'll be there a while.

155
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,589
Scott: Right, till the holiday season's over.

156
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,769
Rym: It's real good.

157
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:42,810
Scott: I mean, has there been a Pixar movie where people said it's real bad?

158
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,400
Rym: Yeah, I guess I feel like it's in my top two.

159
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:49,670
Rym: Like, it was real good.

160
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,690
Scott: Isn't like anything they make just soon to be real good?

161
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,750
Rym: It's pretty much all about skeletons.

162
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,354
Rym: It's got these skeletons.

163
00:07:57,715 --> 00:07:59,439
Rym: It is up Rym's Alley in a lot of ways.

164
00:08:00,703 --> 00:08:03,650
Rym: I don't really want to spoil anything about it.

165
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,730
Rym: I feel like you could go in to see it.

166
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,768
Scott: It's a spoil about a kid's movie.

167
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,210
Scott: But what's interesting about it... There's a happy ending.

168
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:08,844
Rym: Well...

169
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,189
Scott: The main characters are kids.

170
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:19,410
Rym: Well, so what it's really about is when your parents die and relatives die, how you deal with that.

171
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:27,023
Rym: And it doesn't pull any punches and the heel turn that I expected because it was a Pixar movie and they telegraphed it.

172
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:31,090
Rym: the whole time was way darker and more fucked up.

173
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:35,250
Rym: It went into a lot of dark places, way beyond what I expected.

174
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:37,429
Rym: And also the music is fantastic.

175
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:39,750
Scott: I mean, it's a Disney musical.

176
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,950
Rym: Yeah, but the music goes beyond that.

177
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,217
Scott: Even crappy Disney movies, right?

178
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:47,289
Scott: Like ones that are not remembered or not cared about very much.

179
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,790
Rym: But even Pocahontas has fantastic music.

180
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,221
Scott: That are musicals.

181
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:52,850
Scott: Like Pocahontas, which is a really crappy movie.

182
00:08:52,870 --> 00:09:02,550
Rym: But this one's different in that the plot is about a musician and most of the music is him performing or other people performing in the context of the actual story.

183
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,608
Scott: Yeah, there's plenty of those.

184
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:05,950
Rym: It's just, it's fantastic.

185
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,310
Rym: And if you haven't seen it in the theater, I highly recommend you go see it in the theater.

186
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,533
Rym: It is beautiful.

187
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:15,710
Rym: The skeletons are done better than any non-Sharezone skeleton I've ever seen.

188
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:22,969
Scott: I mean, I don't disagree, but I feel like saying all that is sort of unnecessary because all you have to say is like, "Oh, Pixar has a new

189
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:23,210
Scott: movie.".

190
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,503
Scott: It's like, "Oh, all those things you just said are just obvious.

191
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:26,550
Scott: You don't need to have someone tell them to

192
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:26,630
Scott: you.".

193
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,250
Rym: See, you say that, but I feel like it's a cut above most Pixar movies.

194
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:30,843
Scott: I mean...

195
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:32,088
Rym: I really think it is.

196
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:32,809
Scott: Okay.

197
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:34,636
Rym: And you'll have to see it to see.

198
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:37,709
Rym: I guess Emil and I will review it in depth on Patreon because you haven't seen it yet.

199
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,870
Scott: And then I'll probably see it when I see every other Pixar movie, which is like five to ten years after they come out.

200
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,530
Rym: I'm sure you can just find it on the high seas.

201
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,617
Scott: I mean, what's the hurry?

202
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,170
Scott: It's like, it's not going anywhere.

203
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:50,330
Scott: It's going to be easily obtainable for decades.

204
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,176
Rym: It looks pretty good in the theater.

205
00:09:52,196 --> 00:09:55,970
Rym: What was interesting though, late Friday night showing still had mostly kids in the audience.

206
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,850
Scott: I go to the theater for things that won't be easily obtained.

207
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,130
Rym: Like Hateful Eight?

208
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:01,214
Rym: Yeah.

209
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:02,950
Scott: I'm sure you can buy that on DVD now.

210
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,907
Rym: Yeah, but you can't see it.

211
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,029
Scott: Not in 70 millimeters.

212
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,610
Rym: No one has a TV that's going to show that properly.

213
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,204
Scott: Someone does.

214
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,010
Rym: You're going to have this one long thin line on the middle of your monitor.

215
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,390
Scott: I've seen some million dollar TVs, but yeah.

216
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:19,130
Rym: I mean, I guess you could watch it on one of those like double wide silly gaming monitors, like the curved ones.

217
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:20,728
Rym: That's wide enough at least.

218
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,919
Rym: Wouldn't be high enough res.

219
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,343
Rym: That's just 1080p.

220
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:26,990
Scott: Those are just two 1080p monitors stuck to each other on the side.

221
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,490
Rym: But at least they're wide enough.

222
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,330
Rym: I mean, if I looked at it on my screen, there'd be like two inches in the middle.

223
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:31,934
Scott: Right.

224
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:32,370
Scott: Anyway.

225
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,190
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

226
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:47,850
Rym: So, as you know, I do this perennial panel at anime conventions mostly called foreign anime openers.

227
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,650
Rym: Or like anime openers around the world.

228
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:57,550
Rym: I change it up and I just have this rotating library of anime openers translated into languages other than Japanese and English.

229
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,650
Scott: Which is originally, it was originally my deal.

230
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:01,382
Rym: But you never actually made it.

231
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:02,390
Rym: Like I made the panel.

232
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:05,750
Scott: I mean, I was like, oh, I discovered that it was a thing.

233
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,390
Scott: And I think I made a blog post that had like a ton of them in it.

234
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:08,912
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

235
00:11:08,932 --> 00:11:09,193
Rym: You know what.

236
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:13,170
Rym: you have a pain in the ass it was to turn that into a legit panel and like research all this shit.

237
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:18,450
Rym: And like figure, because half the foreign anime openers you find on YouTube are actually fakes or they're made by fans.

238
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,989
Rym: And you really got to like figure this stuff out.

239
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,210
Rym: So anyway, I just found the mother load.

240
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,990
Rym: And part of the problem is I don't speak most of these languages.

241
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:31,669
Rym: Meaning, I don't speak any of these languages.

242
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:33,150
Scott: You speak one language.

243
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,730
Rym: I can look up the name of a show in another language and like do some copy paste.

244
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,024
Rym: But I might copy paste the wrong thing.

245
00:11:40,124 --> 00:11:40,910
Rym: It's tough.

246
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:48,390
Rym: So I just now was looking for a thing of the day because I wanted to see if I could find a quick copy of one of the Ranma Christmas specials.

247
00:11:48,512 --> 00:11:49,749
Rym: That's a good Wednesday thing of the day.

248
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:55,408
Rym: And I ended up finding, purely even a recommended video, the Arabic opener to Ranma.

249
00:11:56,991 --> 00:12:01,590
Scott: We should have done all holiday things of the day to match up with our all Halloween related activities.

250
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,850
Rym: That's a really good idea and I feel dumb that we didn't do that.

251
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,129
Rym: I'm going to do that for the rest of the month.

252
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:06,550
Rym: That's easy enough.

253
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,330
Rym: So I found the opener to Ranma 1/2.

254
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,930
Rym: The "Ya Pa Pa Ya Pa Pa" but in Arabic.

255
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:22,830
Rym: And because of all the stupid research I did for that panel, I know this is legit because it's from SpaceToon as the SpaceToon logo.

256
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,130
Rym: SpaceToon is the Arabic anime channel based out of Dubai.

257
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,410
Rym: And also I just learned a little while ago Damascus.

258
00:12:30,234 --> 00:12:31,130
Scott: What's going on in Damascus?

259
00:12:31,472 --> 00:12:35,350
Rym: I literally don't... I'm not even sure what's going on in Yemen or Qatar at this point.

260
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:36,890
Scott: Well that's a little different situation.

261
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:42,590
Rym: But a lot of these places I don't really understand what's going on despite reading the news.

262
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:43,630
Rym: But I digress.

263
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:45,410
Scott: Because there's not a lot of journalists going there.

264
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,550
Rym: So anyway, this video is legit.

265
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,410
Rym: It's got the SpaceToon logo and then I noticed that it's on the SpaceToon channel.

266
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:58,790
Rym: And it turns out I never thought to look for the SpaceToon channel in Arabic because there's this SpaceToon channel on YouTube.

267
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:04,329
Rym: And it's just all... I think it's every Arabic anime opener there is.

268
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:05,795
Rym: It's just here.

269
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:07,870
Rym: It's an official video in high quality.

270
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:11,930
Rym: Good times are coming because I'm doing this panel at MagFest in the morning.

271
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,070
Scott: That's only one language though even though it's many animes.

272
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,930
Rym: Yeah but you know what?

273
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:22,950
Rym: I feel like Arabic language anime is underrepresented among a lot of people who don't think that people in Arabic speaking countries like anime.

274
00:13:23,932 --> 00:13:24,729
Rym: And also...

275
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:25,668
Scott: I know they like anime.

276
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:27,169
Rym: They love Kpop too.

277
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:27,828
Rym: We do.

278
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:35,590
Rym: Imagine a captain white boy internet user who shows up to a random panel at like 8am at MagFest.

279
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,510
Rym: Because actually an attendee at MagFest probably knows this stuff.

280
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,510
Rym: But anyway, this is pretty great and that's my thing of the day.

281
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,489
Rym: You can go peruse this channel and already I found some gold in there.

282
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,969
Rym: So what do you got?

283
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:48,196
Scott: Oh.

284
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:49,105
Scott: Thing of the day, right.

285
00:13:49,206 --> 00:13:49,650
Scott: What was it?

286
00:13:49,852 --> 00:13:50,348
Scott: It was...

287
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:52,730
Rym: It was something related to the Itano Circus.

288
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,230
Scott: That's right.

289
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,720
Scott: Basically this video is not great.

290
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,930
Scott: This is not a great thing of the day.

291
00:13:56,873 --> 00:13:56,954
Rym: Oh.

292
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:58,790
Rym: I thought Scott always had the great things of the day.

293
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,437
Scott: Not always.

294
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:00,489
Scott: Just most of the time.

295
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:02,350
Scott: Anyway.

296
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:05,621
Scott: I mean even Tom Brady lost.

297
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:06,829
Scott: He got his ass kicked by the dolphins.

298
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:13,510
Scott: So basically if you don't know what the Itano Circus is when you're watching anime and there's missiles going all over the place.

299
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,250
Scott: Like whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh.

300
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:15,871
Scott: Right.

301
00:14:15,891 --> 00:14:19,568
Scott: That's called an Itano Circus because this guy Ichiro Itano invented it.

302
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:25,170
Scott: And here's a very short video that shows you many of these which are very enjoyable to watch.

303
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:28,210
Scott: And also discusses them and their history briefly.

304
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:30,150
Scott: It's only like three minutes long.

305
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:37,610
Scott: But, you know, I think it's it's something that like comes up every once in a while and it seems like people who really know about anime just like for them.

306
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:39,149
Scott: This is like common knowledge.

307
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:39,572
Scott: Right.

308
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,590
Scott: It's not even a thing that like needs to be explained for like anime nerds.

309
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:47,070
Scott: But for other people, it's like this revelation like, oh, that's a thing.

310
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:48,366
Scott: Oh, what did you know?

311
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:51,370
Scott: And so this is a useful video.

312
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:54,970
Scott: Maybe you being an anime nerd who watches GeekNights don't need this video.

313
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:02,110
Scott: But if you pass this video around to people who are only like barely into anime or like watch anime but don't care about it.

314
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,089
Rym: Or like if you're trying to get a free badge to one of those small anime cons that we don't really go to.

315
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:11,830
Rym: Just watch this video and then turn it into a panel about Itano Circus and you could probably get a free badge.

316
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,231
Scott: Yeah.

317
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:12,734
Scott: You know, it's.

318
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:15,250
Scott: it's the kind of thing that they will very much enjoy.

319
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,070
Scott: And the video is pretty well made by whoever made it.

320
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:18,557
Scott: What's the?

321
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:19,109
Scott: what's the channel?

322
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:20,590
Rym: Oda Quest.

323
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,017
Rym: All right.

324
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:21,850
Scott: Good job Oda Quest.

325
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,149
Rym: It only has like 800 views.

326
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,511
Scott: Yeah.

327
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:25,350
Scott: You're good at making videos, Oda Quest.

328
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,498
Rym: Oh, I'll subscribe to you.

329
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:27,910
Rym: You got like you got like no subscribers.

330
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:28,668
Rym: I'll throw some love.

331
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,454
Scott: Yeah.

332
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:30,890
Scott: Also, you know, love to Oda Quest.

333
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:31,610
Scott: Yeah.

334
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,070
Scott: Of course, I don't know anything else about that.

335
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,330
Scott: Watch.

336
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,328
Scott: Maybe I'll retract that.

337
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,710
Rym: For all you know, it's a milkshake, doc.

338
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:37,509
Rym: I'll click on this channel right now.

339
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:37,851
Rym: Yeah.

340
00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:39,529
Scott: I might have to detract my.

341
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:40,373
Rym: All right.

342
00:15:40,413 --> 00:15:42,310
Rym: Interview with Kung Gao, co-founder of Crunchyroll.

343
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:43,216
Rym: All right.

344
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:44,489
Rym: They're doing some stuff here.

345
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,108
Rym: Looks like it's pretty new.

346
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,949
Rym: There's only a few videos.

347
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,046
Scott: All right.

348
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:49,647
Scott: OK.

349
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,350
Rym: Let's see.

350
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,169
Rym: Let's see how this goes.

351
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:52,481
Rym: Yeah.

352
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,492
Rym: Yeah.

353
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:59,530
Rym: In a moment, the book club book is the new translation of the Odyssey.

354
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:01,670
Scott: I just want to talk about something for a second.

355
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:05,810
Scott: So I was thinking, hey, maybe to make the book club episode actually good.

356
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,030
Scott: I'll put in some effort and I'll I'll read some other Odyssey translation.

357
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:12,910
Rym: I have read other Odyssey translation, but not recently.

358
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,289
Rym: I'm not going to read one of those again.

359
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:15,003
Scott: I thought.

360
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:15,210
Scott: Right.

361
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,290
Scott: So I go looking on here on Amazon.

362
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:18,270
Scott: Right.

363
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:19,349
Rym: Which ones are on Amazon?

364
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,664
Scott: So there is one that's the Emily Wilson one.

365
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:26,270
Scott: is the one that we're doing, correct?

366
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:26,926
Scott: Yes.

367
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,208
Rym: New one.

368
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:32,330
Scott: There's a signet classic one that looks like, you know, a legit one.

369
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,390
Scott: Right.

370
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:37,189
Scott: Oh, because I'm searching on my tablet, I don't get the kindle one.

371
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:39,929
Scott: Do you have the scroll down a little bit?

372
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:40,770
Scott: This Mario.

373
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,963
Scott: Yeah.

374
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,130
Scott: What's the title of that one?

375
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:42,588
Scott: This one?

376
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:42,906
Scott: Yeah.

377
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,950
Scott: The one with the blue generic Kindle.

378
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,010
Rym: The Odyssey rendered into English prose for use of those who cannot read the original.

379
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:50,630
Scott: That's a free Kindle edition.

380
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,230
Scott: Yes.

381
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,110
Scott: Scroll down, though.

382
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,990
Scott: There's another free Kindle edition that's just called the Odyssey.

383
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:55,709
Rym: Here's one.

384
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,710
Rym: The idiot, the the Iliad and the Odyssey altogether by Homer.

385
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:00,588
Rym: I don't know who translated it.

386
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,670
Scott: It's like some of these are zero dollars Kindle editions.

387
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,950
Scott: And I don't know how those translations even compared to like the signet classic one.

388
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:08,730
Scott: Right.

389
00:17:09,214 --> 00:17:10,368
Rym: I honestly don't know.

390
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,430
Rym: I do not know which translations I've read.

391
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:21,165
Rym: All I know is I've read two different translations and all I could say about them in high school is that I read to whatever one I read when I was young and pop up.

392
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:26,749
Rym: one of them was pleasant to read and made sense and one of them felt like shoving nails into my eyes.

393
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:30,470
Scott: But anyway, we're reading this one, which is the Emily.

394
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:32,010
Rym: The Emily Wilson.

395
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:32,690
Rym: Emily Wilson.

396
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:33,509
Scott: That's the one.

397
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,029
Rym: Pretty much.

398
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:42,506
Scott: If you search for a translation of the Odyssey, because this is new and if you search for Odyssey on Amazon, the number one result is this book and the number two result is Mario Odyssey.

399
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:56,229
Rym: The interesting things are that it's a modern translation that uses colloquial language where possible while maintaining the artistry of the original to make it more accessible and relatable, which I'm always a fan of.

400
00:17:57,051 --> 00:18:06,530
Rym: It also too, it's the first major translation done by a woman and that perspective is very interesting and very elucidating apparently.

401
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,272
Rym: I haven't read it yet.

402
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:14,809
Rym: as to the things that are in the Odyssey that all the men who have translated over the years didn't really seem to think much about.

403
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:20,033
Rym: This translator said, "Hey, what about all those slaves that got fucking murdered at the

404
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:20,323
Rym: end?".

405
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:28,370
Scott: Yeah, I still feel like I need to read a man translation and then read this translation to be able to compare and contrast in the book club episode.

406
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:29,669
Rym: Let's pick one.

407
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:35,110
Scott: With a fresh memory, not a... Because my memory of the Odyssey is basically like, "Okay, he leaves.

408
00:18:35,454 --> 00:18:35,910
Scott: I don't remember.

409
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:36,566
Scott: Is this Cyclops

410
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:36,690
Scott: first?".

411
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:37,169
Scott: Leaves where?

412
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:38,690
Rym: Where is he, Scott?

413
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,350
Rym: Where does he start?

414
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,009
Scott: I'm just going to name Greek cities until I get it right.

415
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,670
Rym: Well, yeah, the Trojan War, but that's not where... Where is he when the Odyssey begins?

416
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,270
Rym: He's on an island having sex with a hot goddess, not a goddess, but a witch basically.

417
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,429
Scott: Is it Cyprus?

418
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,029
Rym: Circe is the person.

419
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:57,089
Scott: Circe is the witch?

420
00:18:57,313 --> 00:18:57,526
Scott: Yes.

421
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:00,090
Scott: Anyway.

422
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:00,770
Rym: Anyway.

423
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,470
Scott: I know the basics of the story.

424
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,670
Rym: Let's each... I don't know the... Let's pick some other one of these translations, the stodgy one.

425
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,289
Scott: I'm just going to... One of the zero dollar ones.

426
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:15,050
Rym: Let's each just pick one section to read the original, maybe the Cyclops part.

427
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,207
Scott: That's a good idea.

428
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,710
Scott: The lazy, but also kind of okay way.

429
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:34,110
Rym: I feel like we should do... The part we should read together from the old one, just to compare, should probably be the part near the end where he comes back and he hides himself, and then they murder all the servants, and they get rid of all the suitors and all that stuff, because that's near the end.

430
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,690
Scott: That's a good idea.

431
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,670
Scott: Choosing a few parts.

432
00:19:35,752 --> 00:19:38,530
Scott: Maybe let's do... Maybe we should do... Here is a balance between the two.

433
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:39,164
Scott: Yeah.

434
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,250
Scott: The first chapter.

435
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:41,829
Scott: The last chapter.

436
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:42,648
Rym: And the Cyclops.

437
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:45,890
Scott: And pick Cyclops, Sirens, Poseidon.

438
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,587
Scott: Pick one of them.

439
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:47,010
Rym: All right.

440
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:47,468
Rym: We'll pick one.

441
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,150
Scott: Pick one of the monster encounters.

442
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:49,739
Scott: Yeah.

443
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:52,390
Rym: It's basically just a series of D&D encounters.

444
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,067
Scott: Pretty much.

445
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:53,810
Scott: That's right.

446
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:55,589
Scott: Those are just the big ones.

447
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:57,810
Rym: Oh, this beautiful goddess-like woman.

448
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,930
Rym: I'm having sex with her.

449
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,083
Rym: Nope.

450
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,789
Rym: Time to go home.

451
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,109
Rym: And that actually happens twice.

452
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:02,324
Scott: Yeah.

453
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:03,670
Rym: So, yeah.

454
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:08,590
Rym: This should be really interesting, because I've been meaning to re-read the Odyssey for We're not going to read any Iliads, though?

455
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:10,510
Rym: I've never actually read the Iliad.

456
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,190
Scott: Full disclosure.

457
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,970
Scott: Isn't there also the Aeneid or whatever?

458
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:13,828
Rym: The Aeneid?

459
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:14,627
Rym: I don't know.

460
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:18,890
Rym: I've read all of the... What's his name?

461
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,609
Rym: I've read Antigone and Oedipus and all those.

462
00:20:22,112 --> 00:20:23,090
Rym: Multiple translations.

463
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:23,626
Scott: Nope.

464
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:24,747
Rym: Have not.

465
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,650
Rym: Antigone is pretty good.

466
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,648
Rym: Oedipus is pretty good, too.

467
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:32,130
Scott: Which one has stories about my man Agamemnon in it?

468
00:20:32,374 --> 00:20:32,910
Rym: Agamemnon.

469
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:33,688
Rym: That's the Iliad.

470
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:34,684
Scott: All right.

471
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,369
Scott: Well, I guess I'll be checking that out.

472
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:38,506
Scott: Agamemnon!

473
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:39,628
Scott: Agamemnon.

474
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:40,230
Rym: Yeah.

475
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:43,190
Rym: I got feelings on Agamemnon.

476
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:44,349
Scott: He's badass.

477
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,410
Scott: That's all I got to know.

478
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:46,029
Rym: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

479
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,789
Rym: It is issues, though.

480
00:20:47,191 --> 00:20:48,130
Scott: I mean, so does Kenshiro.

481
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:48,657
Scott: Yeah.

482
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:57,030
Rym: Otherwise, we're going to be hanging around New York until the end of the year, and then real quick, next year, we're going to be at PAX South.

483
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,206
Rym: We're going to be doing a panel on Friday, January 12th at PAX South at 4 p.m.

484
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:04,650
Rym: on the Bobcat Theater, Balance in Game Design.

485
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,187
Rym: GaoGao.

486
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:06,288
Rym: We're also going to be there.

487
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:07,170
Rym: GaoGao.

488
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:07,830
Scott: That's a bobcat.

489
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:08,664
Rym: That's not.

490
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,969
Rym: Bobcats don't say that.

491
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,447
Scott: What do they say?

492
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,470
Rym: Only bears say that.

493
00:21:11,713 --> 00:21:12,729
Scott: What do bobcats say?

494
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:13,508
Rym: I don't even know.

495
00:21:14,493 --> 00:21:15,989
Scott: All growling animals say GaoGao.

496
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,109
Scott: A lion says GaoGao.

497
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:19,150
Scott: A tiger says GaoGao.

498
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,350
Rym: I feel like after Yurikuma, GaoGao is exclusively the domain of bears.

499
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:22,881
Rym: Okay.

500
00:21:23,774 --> 00:21:24,329
Rym: So, yeah.

501
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:24,789
Rym: We'll be there.

502
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,170
Rym: Otherwise, just playing games, hanging around.

503
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,910
Rym: We'll also be at Magfest doing a bunch of panels, including a bunch of new panels.

504
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,969
Rym: It's going to be exciting times.

505
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,470
Scott: I'm also going to be doing a secret impromptu panel, How to Dig Dug.

506
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,610
Scott: You have to be at the Dig Dug when I'm there and you'll get it.

507
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,387
Scott: It'll take two minutes.

508
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,949
Rym: Ooh, a Dig Dug impromptu.

509
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,269
Rym: That'll be interesting.

510
00:21:42,531 --> 00:21:43,049
Scott: How to Dig Dug.

511
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:49,429
Scott: If anyone catches me at a Dig Dug machine and says, "Scott, I want to know how to Dig Dug," I will tell you how to Dig Dug.

512
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:57,110
Rym: So also, if, Scott, since you're joining Netflix and drop in the- I already signed up for my Netflix.

513
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:06,089
Rym: I think you'll actually like Stranger Things, but season two, if you decide to watch the second season, Dig Dug features prominently on both-.

514
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,590
Scott: I did see a screenshot on the web of someone playing a Dig Dug.

515
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,010
Scott: That was definitely from that show.

516
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,390
Rym: The arcade game itself features prominently in the plot.

517
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,430
Rym: The arcade game itself features prominently in allegory to the-.

518
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,790
Scott: So Pookas and Fygar's come out of the kid's closet or something and burn them in his sleep?

519
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,370
Rym: Let's just say that it also applies allegorically to things that happened in the show.

520
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:30,470
Rym: And then it applies literally to a thing that happens in the show.

521
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,610
Scott: Someone has to dig and inflate- someone inflates someone until they explode?

522
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,849
Rym: So the only thing that does not happen is the inflating.

523
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:36,461
Rym: Okay.

524
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:38,668
Scott: But- Do they get burned by the Fygar?

525
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,070
Rym: Well, watch your show.

526
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,970
Scott: Do they eat an eggplant?

527
00:22:41,453 --> 00:22:43,230
Scott: There is- That they found underground randomly?

528
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,510
Scott: There- Shady, shady vegetables?

529
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:46,330
Rym: You'll see.

530
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:46,890
Rym: Okay.

531
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:53,070
Rym: If you like season one, which I actually do think you will, I think you're gonna- it's not a Ready Player One situation like you're worried about.

532
00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:56,690
Scott: I'm just saying, 'cause like, you know, I'm not saying it is a Ready Player One situation.

533
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:57,339
Rym: I just believe you.

534
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:07,245
Scott: No, but if you talk to some- if you talk to some fan of it- If you look at the promotional media, or if you look- if you just look at like Twitter comments and just get a- try to get an idea- Remember ET?

535
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:15,670
Scott: If you try to get an idea of the show based on screenshots and these sorts of, you know, just the ephemera that is about in the nerdosphere- Yup.

536
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,330
Scott: It feels like it's a Ready Player One.

537
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:17,759
Rym: Yup.

538
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:26,350
Rym: But whereas Stranger Things uses a scalpel and the tools of an artisan, Ready Player One is- I was gonna say something really mean about Ready Player One.

539
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:26,969
Scott: The fist of a ham?

540
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:34,647
Rym: That's giving it too much justice, because that- that's too close to steamed hams, which are good.

541
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,149
Scott: So, yeah.

542
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,210
Scott: You're gonna need a lot of time.

543
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,190
Rym: Save plenty a lot of time to talk about.

544
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:40,850
Rym: Go, lion.

545
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,129
Scott: All right, so here's the deal, right?

546
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:53,970
Scott: So, when I was a kid, Voltron was hot shit, but as a kid, you know, I watched it and my friend had the real Voltron toy, the whole thing, and everyone was jealous, and he still has it, even though he's, like, two years older than me and, like, a fancy lawyer.

547
00:23:54,190 --> 00:24:02,610
Rym: So I never watched Voltron as someone who has adult or even teenager perspective.

548
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:06,428
Scott: See, as a kid, all I remembered from Voltron was, like, "Oh, there's five colors of

549
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:06,790
Scott: lions.".

550
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:07,349
Scott: I knew that.

551
00:24:07,451 --> 00:24:08,210
Scott: They combined.

552
00:24:08,373 --> 00:24:08,438
Scott: Yup.

553
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,570
Scott: The five characters.

554
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,467
Scott: Here's what they look like.

555
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,369
Rym: I knew the combined one had a sword.

556
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,630
Scott: They're in a castle.

557
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:14,390
Scott: It has a sword.

558
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,990
Scott: It fights monsters.

559
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:17,410
Scott: I only remember, like, the vague imagery of Voltron.

560
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,610
Scott: I didn't remember any details.

561
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:27,970
Scott: But then, in high school, Voltron was on Toonami, so I would get home, right, when they finally added Cartoon Network to our cable subscription, it was still on Toonami, and that was the first show.

562
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:29,230
Scott: Get home immediately, Voltron.

563
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:30,464
Scott: It's like, "Yes, finally,

564
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:30,870
Scott: Voltron.".

565
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,535
Scott: This is before.

566
00:24:31,858 --> 00:24:33,250
Scott: you could just download stuff from the internet.

567
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,410
Scott: There was no way.

568
00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:35,248
Scott: It was not no DVDs.

569
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:42,748
Scott: There was literally no way for me to re-experience Voltron after my childhood until it was on Toonami, right?

570
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:55,349
Scott: And I watched it again, and then I was able to remember more details of Voltron, and then sometime during RIT, I think they put out a DVD box set, and I bought only the first season in, like, a tin- I remember that.

571
00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:05,270
Scott: In a tin thing, and I was able to watch the first season of Voltron, but this was all the US Voltron, which I knew was edited, to some extent, from two different anime, right?

572
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:09,729
Scott: There was an anime called Go Lion, which was the lion Voltron, the Voltron that we give a shit about.

573
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,350
Rym: Well, Beast King Go Lion.

574
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:11,667
Scott: Right.

575
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,862
Scott: And then there was some other anime- Die Ruger.

576
00:25:14,231 --> 00:25:14,508
Scott: Okay.

577
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:30,209
Scott: -that involved, like, a 30-something vehicles that combined or some shit, and I never even s- people in- like, I didn't find out till internet days that there even was a vehicle Voltron because that was never on TV where I lived anywhere, so for me, Voltron was only lion Voltron.

578
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:42,528
Rym: I have the even weirder experience of I know I must have, in my pre-sentient days, watched Voltron because I had some Voltron toys, and I had a Voltron board game that we played all the time.

579
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:48,229
Scott: I had a Voltron Halloween costume, the crappy kind with the plastic mask and the plastic s- sack you shoved over yourself.

580
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:56,789
Rym: So the Voltron board game that I had, which I still have, my mom has it, actually, it- Is it just roll- roll your dice and move your dice?

581
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:57,234
Scott: No?

582
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:04,710
Rym: So I think, based on how I- this is it, based on my memories, remember that, uh, Canisia Lord of the Rings game?

583
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,110
Scott: Like, I've seen the box for this game, but I've never seen the inside of it.

584
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,050
Rym: So remember the Canisia Lord of the Rings game, where, like- The co-op game that's, uh, yeah.

585
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:15,850
Rym: Where your guys are moving forward on the corruption track, but Sauron's also moving closer together, and if you touch, you lose?

586
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,890
Scott: That's the only good part of the game.

587
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,809
Rym: I'm pretty sure the Voltron game has that same mechanic and is actually co-op.

588
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:21,200
Scott: Maybe.

589
00:26:21,978 --> 00:26:23,190
Scott: So- I have no idea how the game works.

590
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:30,350
Rym: But I don't remember, because as a kid, this was before I was sentient, so I would play this game without actually knowing how it worked.

591
00:26:30,813 --> 00:26:31,070
Scott: Anyway.

592
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:41,070
Rym: But the fact that I had the game and the toys implies that I watched the show Voltron, and I remember all these oddly specific details, but I don't remember the game.

593
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,769
Scott: So anyway, Voltron is a big deal.

594
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,741
Scott: I think it's a new Voltron show.

595
00:26:44,781 --> 00:26:45,989
Scott: that's all the rage these days.

596
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:46,990
Rym: It's apparently great.

597
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,430
Rym: It's done by, I guess, a lot of the same people who did Avatar, the last Airbender, which is also great.

598
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,188
Scott: Where can you watch it?

599
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:52,529
Scott: Uh, I don't know.

600
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,090
Scott: Alright, anyway.

601
00:26:53,271 --> 00:26:54,190
Rym: We should probably watch it, though.

602
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,010
Scott: There's also some other remakes of Voltron.

603
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:03,968
Scott: There's also a bunch of Voltron comics, like when I was in the RIT days, I was buying Voltron comics that were actually quite good, but there have been bad and good ones over the years.

604
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,969
Rym: Regardless- But we're not talking about any of that!

605
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:20,890
Scott: In the US, we had this edited line Voltron, this edited vehicle Voltron that were somehow combined into two shows that were played back-to-back, and I guess were both called Voltron, but the actual show is called Go Lion, so a few weeks ago- Beast King Go Lion!

606
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:28,029
Scott: I was on Crunchyroll, and I was trying to watch the march comes in like a lion, Gatsu No Lion, whatever, about the show- Oh, yeah, yeah.

607
00:27:28,192 --> 00:27:29,370
Scott: The depressed kid who plays Shogi.

608
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:30,169
Rym: I want to watch that.

609
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:32,110
Scott: Uh, I watched like one or two episodes.

610
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:37,190
Scott: It was, you know, it was worth at least searching for again, and when I searched, I just typed "lion" into Crunchyroll.

611
00:27:37,752 --> 00:27:40,810
Scott: It was like, "lion, press enter," and all that show didn't appear.

612
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,546
Scott: The only show that appeared was Go Lion, and I'm like, "Oh, that's on

613
00:27:44,586 --> 00:27:45,109
Scott: Crunchyroll!".

614
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:46,389
Scott: So I watched that instead.

615
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,650
Rym: So all Scott said to me was, "Hey, you should watch Go Lion.

616
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,426
Rym: We'll do a show on

617
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:50,529
Rym: it.".

618
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:50,702
Rym: Right.

619
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,650
Scott: "Hey, you should watch the Go Lion.

620
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,449
Scott: We'll do a show on it.

621
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,650
Scott: Won't that be a good show?

622
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:57,667
Scott: Talk about the actual Japanese Go Lion, you know, and not the

623
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:58,129
Scott: Voltron.".

624
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:14,230
Rym: So my very initial impressions from the first few minutes are, one, I definitely as a kid did not at any point remember Voltron involving the horrific mutilation of slaves by monsters.

625
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,630
Scott: Yeah, so I knew the show had been edited because there's a character who dies.

626
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:20,390
Scott: I never actually saw that character until high school.

627
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:31,850
Rym: So I remember this weird thing as a kid where there was a rumor that a character died, and like no one- Because when you're watching shows in syndication on TV, they don't play them in order or anything like that, right?

628
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,749
Rym: So the only episodes of Voltron- But the one weird kid who was always like, "Yeah, the guy died and they covered it

629
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:35,890
Rym: up.".

630
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,810
Rym: The only episode- He must have known something about it.

631
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,849
Scott: The only episode of Voltrons I saw when I was a kid didn't have Sven in them.

632
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,437
Scott: He was called Sven in the U.S.

633
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:45,341
Scott: version.

634
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,429
Scott: He was called Quiet in this version.

635
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,490
Rym: Well, Quiet's his nickname.

636
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,590
Rym: It was Takashi Shurigane.

637
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,369
Scott: Sure, whatever.

638
00:28:53,990 --> 00:29:00,289
Scott: But anyway, he had a stereotyped Swedish accent, like the Swedish chef in the U.S.

639
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:00,490
Scott: one.

640
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:05,750
Scott: And basically, you could tell if you had any amount of intelligence.

641
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:11,925
Scott: When I watched it in high school on Toonami, I could tell, "Hey, that character totally died in the original Japanese and they hid it by

642
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:12,288
Scott: editing.".

643
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:19,110
Scott: So I knew that it was edited that much, but now watching the actual Go line with subtitles, you have no idea.

644
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:22,370
Scott: This show was edited extremely heavily.

645
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:24,159
Rym: If I had to say the- Extremely.

646
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,090
Rym: In terms of what the editing is or what- It wasn't just erasing one character's death.

647
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,486
Rym: It felt a lot like when I started watching Fist of the North Star, when I started watching this.

648
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:46,684
Scott: Yes, this Go line is way closer to Fist of the North Star than it is to... It's not as Fist of the North Star, but it's definitely got tons and tons of violence and horror that is not present at all in the U.S.

649
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:46,905
Rym: Voltron.

650
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:53,289
Rym: I want to try to summarize the plot together up until they have the real castle and they make Voltron.

651
00:29:53,631 --> 00:29:54,004
Scott: Right, right, right.

652
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,330
Rym: Because it's just serial.

653
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,510
Rym: Like, every episode just continues from the last one.

654
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:57,750
Rym: Oh,

655
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:13,070
Scott: and eventually, once the setup is done, it becomes Monster of the Week, but there is a little bit of serialness even in the Monster of the Week episodes where things that, basically, the status quo will sometimes change ever so slightly in an episode and then they carry it going forward.

656
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:20,246
Scott: So, even though it's Monster of the Week, eventually, the first five, six, seven episodes are really building up the world.

657
00:30:21,211 --> 00:30:23,450
Rym: If you watch the first six episodes, it's basically a movie.

658
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:27,590
Scott: I haven't watched to the end, but I think there is an end at the ending.

659
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,950
Scott: You might be able to, if you figure it out, skip over a lot of the Monsters of the Week.

660
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:39,868
Rym: Oh, the other big thing that's different is that Voltron starts on that planet, but here, Go line starts on Earth.

661
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:41,289
Rym: And Earth is gone.

662
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:41,809
Scott: Yep.

663
00:30:42,290 --> 00:31:01,990
Rym: So, basically, the show starts with a slave ship filled with these, like, weird leather-looking dudes whipping the shit out of a whole bunch of slaves, and then the slave ship lands at a slave planet where the slaves are forced to fight to the death against these death black guardians.

664
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,383
Scott: So, the death black guardians are awesome because, like, where the hell did these come from?

665
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,870
Rym: These are, like, the monsters that the Incorai make in The Prince of Nothing.

666
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:13,970
Rym: And if you say Rym, that's not, like, that sounds weird.

667
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,130
Rym: That is the closest thing I can think of.

668
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,090
Rym: They are made with occult fire.

669
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:37,689
Scott: The death black beasts are made with a combination of, they take the slaves who were victorious in combat, plus evil magic, plus feeding them the dead other slaves, and they combine those things to create horrific monsters that then fight slaves and become even more powerful combat beasts.

670
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:42,270
Rym: It's way worse than the prison planet in Dune.

671
00:31:43,174 --> 00:31:45,650
Scott: This isn't alluded to in Go Lion.

672
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,910
Scott: This is straight up said.

673
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,225
Scott: That's exactly how they're made.

674
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:57,049
Rym: You watch a tournament where the king, the emperor, is like, "I need stronger death black guardians," and he has a tournament where they're all trying to behead as many people as possible as fast as possible.

675
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:15,327
Rym: And then, like, it's literally a witch uses occult magic that is called, like, occult death black guardian, even more crazy and fucked up, and then they put him in a coffin and shoot him at the planet.

676
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:16,766
Scott: The coffins are in the U.S.

677
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:16,909
Scott: one.

678
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,970
Rym: Yeah, but they shoot him at the planet like a gun, and he pops out to go kill people.

679
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:30,462
Scott: So, the one thing I got to say that's really great about this show is that the designs of the death black beasts, which are called robeasts in U.S.

680
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:34,410
Scott: Voltron, are all really unique and fantastic.

681
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:35,247
Scott: They're crazy.

682
00:32:35,631 --> 00:32:44,210
Scott: Whoever designs the visuals of these monsters, like, even though it's monster of the week, every episode, you're getting a different and unique, incredible looking monster.

683
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:54,370
Rym: Like that second one, let's get a juggernaut looking guy with a weird, like, eye, like the one Cyclops guy in He-Man, give him some muscles, a spike coming out, guns coming out of his nipples.

684
00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:02,450
Scott: Evangelion can only design so many unique looking angels, but even the fanciest angels don't compare to a robeast, a death black whatever.

685
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:04,509
Rym: And there's so many... A death black beast man.

686
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,803
Scott: There's so many death black beast men, because there's one.

687
00:33:08,024 --> 00:33:10,046
Scott: every, almost every episode there's a new one.

688
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:14,029
Rym: But this construction of how they're made is just literally shown to you.

689
00:33:15,672 --> 00:33:28,530
Rym: So, even better, along with all that, you get this sort of setup of Voltron, meaning, you know, go lion, was this entity, some robot someone made that I guess has its own AI.

690
00:33:29,111 --> 00:33:36,210
Scott: We don't know if he was made, but he's presented as if he's a living being who happens to be in a robot shape that looks like it has five lion heads.

691
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:41,926
Rym: And who has existed forever, no one knows where he came from, and all he does is going around fighting people in space.

692
00:33:43,131 --> 00:33:45,330
Rym: So I guess he shows up in a planet and just starts killing people.

693
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:54,450
Scott: In US Voltron, they called him defender of the universe, and I would argue, yo, you know, Voltron is way more powerful than like even Ava's or whatever.

694
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:59,050
Scott: He defends literally the whole universe, and really nothing can fuck with Voltron.

695
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:03,009
Scott: And go lion, right, is even more powerful.

696
00:34:03,492 --> 00:34:07,150
Scott: Than US Voltron, who's actually the same robot.

697
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:13,350
Scott: Go lion kills and battles every being worth fighting in all of the universe.

698
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,329
Scott: Kind of like Bruton.

699
00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:20,750
Scott: And then, yeah, challenges Pluto, whatever, challenges the goddess of space herself.

700
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,190
Rym: Who is basically a Sailor Moon goddess who was like, um, son.

701
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,856
Scott: Yeah, that's the only thing.

702
00:34:25,937 --> 00:34:28,750
Scott: go lion can't mess with is the goddess of all space.

703
00:34:28,991 --> 00:34:29,710
Rym: It's so great.

704
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:40,248
Rym: You get all these shots of him fucking up all these space monsters, and suddenly he goes to attack this goddess who's just like this beautiful woman surrounded by doves, and she's just like, nope, what's wrong with you?

705
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:42,110
Rym: What are you, I'm the goddess of space.

706
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,083
Rym: What are you doing?

707
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:48,070
Scott: So she punishes him by sending him down to a planet and separating him in five pieces or whatever.

708
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:57,750
Rym: And I guess, I don't know, I don't know if whatever animus, like what animated him is still in him or is gone, because now he's going to be piloted by people.

709
00:34:57,811 --> 00:34:59,629
Rym: He's piloted by five humans after this.

710
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:04,350
Scott: Yeah, and no longer has his own will of, maybe he does, but it doesn't express itself.

711
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:12,410
Rym: So the other beginning is that our five main characters are researchers slash space pilots who are off doing something in space.

712
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,526
Scott: Yes, they're basically five bad, this is always in every telling of Voltron comics that, you know, whatever.

713
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,370
Scott: There's five badasses.

714
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,030
Scott: There's basically five incredible badasses.

715
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,729
Rym: And they are badasses.

716
00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:25,470
Rym: They barely need the Voltron lions to fight.

717
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,690
Scott: Yes, they're basically these five badasses.

718
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:33,630
Rym: Like what, the one short kid basically fights off like the entire galactic army for a while, just with one pistol.

719
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:34,509
Rym: They're spacemen.

720
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:35,930
Scott: It's like Captain Harlock, right?

721
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,349
Scott: It's like his crew is all badasses.

722
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:41,570
Scott: So it's like five badasses in space, but they've been captured.

723
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:42,788
Rym: Well, let's back up.

724
00:35:43,091 --> 00:35:48,690
Rym: They come back to Earth after a long mission in space and they find that Earth planet of the Aped and is gone.

725
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:49,669
Scott: Oh, right, right, right.

726
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:55,970
Rym: If thermonuclear itself, Earth is destroyed, everyone's dead, and they have this long moment of no YM play God.

727
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,769
Scott: Yeah, that wasn't in the US book.

728
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,321
Rym: Yeah.

729
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,770
Rym: You got these, all these shots of like children dying in nuclear holocaust, right?

730
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:08,970
Rym: And then this spaceship shows up on the horizon and it's this evil empire that didn't destroy Earth.

731
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,889
Rym: Earth destroyed itself.

732
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,450
Rym: This empire is like, hey, Earth got destroyed.

733
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,149
Rym: Let's go see if there's any slaves to steal.

734
00:36:15,614 --> 00:36:17,550
Scott: We want those irradiated slaves.

735
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:22,730
Rym: But I just love this fact that the evil empire didn't even need to destroy Earth.

736
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:25,189
Rym: They ignored Earth and Earth destroyed itself.

737
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:25,520
Scott: Yeah.

738
00:36:25,772 --> 00:36:25,857
Scott: Yeah.

739
00:36:26,692 --> 00:36:29,030
Rym: So the dive Basel, who is the emperor?

740
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:29,808
Rym: I'm just called emperor.

741
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,995
Rym: Yeah.

742
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:36,710
Scott: I mean the emperor, but I think in the US one he was called King Zarkon, but in this one he's dive Bosel something I can't even pronounce.

743
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:40,570
Scott: So he just is the bad evil king and is the evil king and the evil witch.

744
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:45,123
Scott: And I remember there being the Prince Zarkon in the US one, but I don't think I got far enough.

745
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,469
Rym: I think he shows up later.

746
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,829
Scott: I didn't get far enough and go line to get to the Prince.

747
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:56,129
Rym: So his deal is that he is the most powerful being like this empire is basically conquering the entire universe bit by bit.

748
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:06,682
Rym: He's really a bad ass emperor of evil, but he's also really really stupid and really simplistic in the things he wants and that which is the only one who actually knows what's up.

749
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,589
Scott: I mean, he just wants to be more powerful.

750
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,530
Scott: He's not stupid.

751
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:11,049
Rym: I think he's just watch him.

752
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:12,430
Scott: He's not completely stupid.

753
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:14,090
Scott: He's just power hungry and simple.

754
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:14,688
Rym: He wants.

755
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,450
Rym: Yeah, he's simple.

756
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,050
Rym: He's not stupid.

757
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,805
Rym: He wants to expand his power and he's bored.

758
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:27,950
Rym: And whenever he's bored, he asks the witch and that guy that generally sends out to go get him more slaves to fight in the arena to make more death black beast.

759
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,890
Scott: There was one thing I noticed I got to talk about.

760
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,509
Scott: I brought this up to everyone already, but the listeners haven't heard it.

761
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:38,589
Scott: There's a scene where he's talking to the witch and he's casually has this giant drumstick that he's gnawing on.

762
00:37:38,711 --> 00:37:39,949
Rym: Oh yeah, the drumstick.

763
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:40,347
Scott: Right.

764
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,696
Scott: He's got this giant drumstick.

765
00:37:41,716 --> 00:37:44,690
Scott: he's just chomping on while he's talking to the witch and they don't say anything.

766
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:51,009
Rym: So it's not only gonna say is that scene reminds me of the non man that we meet in the later Prince of Nothing books with his oil.

767
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:51,627
Scott: Right.

768
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:51,957
Scott: Yeah.

769
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,250
Scott: Anyway, he's chopping on this drumstick as just like scenery.

770
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,849
Scott: Like at least it's like, Hey, at least they're animating something and not just having a still frame of him.

771
00:37:58,914 --> 00:37:59,046
Scott: Right.

772
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,049
Scott: Not, you know, good job.

773
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,247
Scott: Right.

774
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:03,610
Scott: You put in the effort to animate him eating this drumstick, but it's like, wait a minute.

775
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:06,070
Scott: You live on this horrible slave planet.

776
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:07,390
Scott: I've seen this slave planet.

777
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,310
Rym: There's nothing but slaves, a fucking wasteland.

778
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:13,470
Scott: And I already know you feed slaves to beast men.

779
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,190
Scott: And I haven't seen any other fucking livestock around here.

780
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,090
Scott: The emperor is eating slave meat.

781
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:18,929
Scott: There is no.

782
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,970
Rym: Oh, they don't say the slaves are eating slave meat.

783
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:25,710
Scott: And they do say that they don't say what the emperor is eating.

784
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:30,410
Scott: But one hundred percent, if you have any logic whatsoever, he's just eating slave meat.

785
00:38:30,913 --> 00:38:32,510
Scott: So also they they draw.

786
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,810
Scott: It's not just human slaves.

787
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,510
Scott: They're all sorts of different alien species.

788
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:35,930
Rym: Oh, yeah.

789
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:38,310
Scott: A Star Wars number of different alien species.

790
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,190
Rym: This empire literally only seems to be eating wookie meat.

791
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,329
Rym: It only has two wings.

792
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,870
Rym: One wing is the empire's army going out and conquering more land.

793
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:51,989
Rym: And the other wing is this general going out to collect more and more slaves to fuel these dark purposes.

794
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:52,768
Rym: Yeah, that's it.

795
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,310
Rym: That's literally the full extent of what these people are up to.

796
00:38:56,431 --> 00:38:57,429
Scott: And they eat the slaves, too.

797
00:38:57,592 --> 00:38:58,389
Scott: So it's like this.

798
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,670
Scott: The people going to get slaves are literally farming.

799
00:39:01,012 --> 00:39:01,489
Rym: It's Scott.

800
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,810
Rym: It's a hunger from the outside.

801
00:39:04,431 --> 00:39:15,829
Rym: So where the show actually begins is that the slave ship lands after these slaves get whipped to the shed and then they take all the ones who are too whipped to continue and immediately grind them up into meat.

802
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:21,548
Rym: And all the ones who can continue are thrown into arena to fight one of these death black beast men.

803
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:22,145
Rym: Mm hmm.

804
00:39:22,753 --> 00:39:24,429
Rym: And they basically all get killed.

805
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:25,809
Rym: And then we come to that.

806
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,485
Scott: I mean, you're just you're sitting there with no weapons and there's a death like beast man.

807
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,107
Scott: Yeah, you are.

808
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,910
Scott: So I mean, Voltron, you need to Voltron to fight one of those.

809
00:39:33,032 --> 00:39:33,868
Scott: And you're just a person.

810
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:35,068
Rym: Get fucked.

811
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:50,950
Rym: So then we cut to our five badasses and you learn from them because they're just in a prison cell that literally every slave who is in this planet still and alive fought and killed a death black beast man by themselves.

812
00:39:52,052 --> 00:39:56,110
Rym: So we already know that these five badasses are the baddest ass badasses.

813
00:39:56,892 --> 00:40:05,068
Rym: And they're in this cell and they accidentally look out a window and they discover that all the meat they've been eating is slave made and they're just like, let's fucking break out of here.

814
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:05,470
Scott: Yeah.

815
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:12,490
Scott: And they actually have a really good logic, which I appreciate being in this show, which is, look, if we try to break out and get caught, what are they going to do?

816
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,589
Scott: Turn us into slave meat.

817
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:14,829
Scott: What else are we going to do?

818
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:23,650
Rym: Fight a death like beast man to get murdered by it and get turned into slave me or keep fighting death like beast man and not get eaten and probably eventually get turned into a death like beast man.

819
00:40:23,814 --> 00:40:23,970
Scott: Right.

820
00:40:24,051 --> 00:40:25,490
Scott: So it's like there's no good option.

821
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:29,550
Scott: It's not like there's an incentive to not try to escape if you're going to be killed.

822
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,230
Scott: It's like if you're on death row, what are you going to do if they try to escape?

823
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:32,768
Scott: Shoot you.

824
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:34,449
Scott: You might as well try to escape.

825
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:38,849
Scott: And the only reason you don't do that in the real world is because this might be a legal way to escape.

826
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,509
Rym: If you get lawyers, they've already killed a death like beast man, as we know.

827
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:45,250
Rym: So they escape pretty trivially.

828
00:40:45,832 --> 00:40:49,030
Scott: I mean, the prison is a lot is less strong than a death like beast man.

829
00:40:49,177 --> 00:40:49,266
Rym: Yeah.

830
00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:52,229
Rym: And they're stronger than one basic death like beast man.

831
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:55,630
Scott: So and it's funny because let's see how many times you can say death like this.

832
00:40:56,232 --> 00:40:58,450
Rym: It gets said a lot in the show.

833
00:40:58,592 --> 00:40:58,857
Rym: Oh, yeah.

834
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:00,504
Scott: OK.

835
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,950
Scott: I saw the Wikipedia quote for Goli and the point is they escape.

836
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,250
Scott: They seal a slave ship.

837
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:05,988
Scott: They run away.

838
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:11,210
Scott: And of course, by chance, they land on the planet of where Voltron is.

839
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:16,530
Scott: It seems like the name is a planet, Allura, Altaia, Altaia, Allura is the princess's name.

840
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,390
Rym: Allura is the name of the planet in Voltron.

841
00:41:19,951 --> 00:41:23,170
Scott: Allura is the princess's name in Voltron and the name of the planet, I think.

842
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:23,462
Scott: Is it?

843
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:23,870
Scott: I don't know.

844
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,050
Scott: This planet, Altaia, whatever.

845
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,030
Scott: It's the Voltron plan.

846
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:38,970
Rym: So it's not clear from the first like six episodes whether or not Voltron called them to the planet, whether or not the princess and the badass mustache guy, the strategist called them to the planet, or if it was just dumb chance.

847
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:49,110
Rym: But it seems like a signal happened and they were drawn to the planet for the purpose of there's never been five badasses capable of piloting Voltron and mustache guy.

848
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:55,548
Scott: Yet somehow the long lost king of this planet, the princess's father, knew like who is piloting Voltron in his day.

849
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:56,708
Rym: I don't know.

850
00:41:58,155 --> 00:41:59,229
Scott: And how did he know about it?

851
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:08,030
Rym: And basically now we've got this planet that has all this ridiculous precursor technology, some of which was built by the people who were on the planet.

852
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,509
Scott: The king definitely made that castle.

853
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:10,630
Rym: But he didn't make Voltron.

854
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,930
Rym: So that's an inch that precursor, it's kind of like the same level of precursor tech as He-Man.

855
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,188
Scott: It's almost like it's all a little Metroid kind of.

856
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,508
Rym: Yeah, Metroid as well.

857
00:42:21,752 --> 00:42:24,130
Rym: And one thing leads to another and they get Voltron going.

858
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,330
Rym: And this planet was destroyed by the empire.

859
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,269
Scott: Yeah, the empire basically destroyed this planet and then ignored it.

860
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:35,607
Scott: But there were people hiding out on it, including the princess, the guy who's in the castle with her.

861
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:36,328
Rym: And Voltron.

862
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,410
Scott: And Voltron and all these, you learn eventually that like a lot of the citizens were living in caves and hiding.

863
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:43,950
Scott: And then the empire left before it got them all.

864
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:52,750
Rym: There's this great moment where our five badasses, like they're fighting off empire troops just with pistols or sticks or whatever, and they're totally fine.

865
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:57,548
Rym: And then they start bitching like, yeah, all these survivors on this planet are like baby ass wimps.

866
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,129
Rym: And then the princess is like, you shut the fuck up.

867
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:00,378
Rym: Yeah.

868
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,169
Rym: You have no idea what they've been through.

869
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:02,767
Scott: That's right.

870
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:08,850
Rym: But it is true that they are more badass than pretty much any other people on this planet, except mustache guy and the princess.

871
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:16,510
Scott: I mean, it kind of makes sense if you're Earth in that day and age where there's probably been who knows how much evolution, genetic engineering, technology, right?

872
00:43:16,771 --> 00:43:22,150
Scott: And you're sending people into space to go far, you're sending badasses and they're going to be way badass, right?

873
00:43:22,298 --> 00:43:22,425
Rym: Yep.

874
00:43:22,972 --> 00:43:25,010
Rym: They're badass in that Leiji Matsumoto way.

875
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:32,450
Scott: Imagine the Earth you live on, the real Earth, a thousand, two thousand years from now, assuming we have good things happening and scientific progress.

876
00:43:32,851 --> 00:43:34,930
Scott: What kind of badass people we're going to send into space.

877
00:43:36,554 --> 00:43:36,782
Scott: Come on.

878
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:37,608
Scott: Anyway.

879
00:43:38,592 --> 00:43:42,030
Rym: So that's it on a high level.

880
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:42,908
Rym: That's the show.

881
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:43,310
Scott: Yeah.

882
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:50,670
Scott: Once they get Voltron going, which takes a while, it's pretty much the empire sending a death black beast to fight them every episode.

883
00:43:50,971 --> 00:44:00,110
Scott: Then they use their powers to make the death black be super big and super strong so that you need giant Voltron to fight it, you know, because they start out normal, sort of slightly larger than human size.

884
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:09,929
Scott: At one point, as not a spoiler, the witch comes to the planet and totally murders the quiet Sven slash Sven guy.

885
00:44:10,433 --> 00:44:12,169
Scott: And then the princess has to take his place.

886
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:16,930
Rym: The witch is clearly the driving force between the entire the whole empire and that cat.

887
00:44:17,211 --> 00:44:19,150
Rym: You get so many shots that cat's eyes glowing.

888
00:44:19,251 --> 00:44:21,489
Scott: Well, the cat is sort of the counterpart to the mice.

889
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:23,909
Rym: And the mice are like the good animals.

890
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:24,950
Scott: Yeah, there's good animals.

891
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,810
Scott: And that's sort of like, you know, Smurfs.

892
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:27,749
Scott: There's the evil cat.

893
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:28,175
Rym: Yeah.

894
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:31,870
Scott: And Inspector Gadget, this brain and then the evil cat.

895
00:44:32,232 --> 00:44:32,809
Scott: The claw cat.

896
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:32,958
Scott: Yeah.

897
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:33,317
Scott: Right.

898
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,849
Scott: You know, it's a common thing.

899
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,447
Scott: And it's silly.

900
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:37,228
Rym: Oh my God.

901
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,130
Rym: On the Wikipedia article, space mice are listed as allies.

902
00:44:40,499 --> 00:44:40,690
Rym: Yeah.

903
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,789
Rym: A family of five mice that live in Grodama Castle.

904
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:51,078
Scott: But the thing is, even though it's monster of the week, it's like when Voltron cuts these monsters down and go line Voltron custom monsters down, it's just like form blazing sword.

905
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:51,969
Scott: The monster is dead.

906
00:44:52,033 --> 00:44:52,228
Scott: Right.

907
00:44:52,635 --> 00:44:52,988
Scott: In here.

908
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,129
Scott: When Goliath cuts them, it's like this.

909
00:44:55,271 --> 00:44:55,990
Scott: They're a cut in half.

910
00:44:56,051 --> 00:44:57,390
Scott: It looks like Kentro punched him.

911
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:01,230
Scott: It's like, yeah, the way it's animated and everything is like super violent.

912
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:01,730
Scott: Right.

913
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:05,770
Rym: At least for, you know, what you would expect, because it makes a it makes it very clear.

914
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:06,889
Rym: These are not robots.

915
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:08,270
Rym: These are basic.

916
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:12,865
Scott: I think they call them robeasts in Voltron of, you know, U.S.

917
00:45:12,906 --> 00:45:14,929
Scott: because to imply that they are robot beasts.

918
00:45:15,272 --> 00:45:16,690
Scott: But no, they are not.

919
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,690
Scott: They are people that were slaves that got horribly infected with evil.

920
00:45:21,431 --> 00:45:27,689
Rym: And I guess my big takeaway is that I expected to watch this and then we do a show on it like, OK, this was the thing we watch.

921
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:35,829
Rym: But I kind of felt that same feeling watching the first six episodes that I felt the first time I started watching a bunch of Fist of the North Star.

922
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:36,910
Scott: You want to keep watching?

923
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,810
Rym: Like, I feel like I could just occasionally watch an episode.

924
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:49,010
Scott: Even though it's monster of the week, it's like you get it sort of drags you on with its its simple structure of making you want to keep going.

925
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:58,490
Scott: And as the added bonus of the slight amount of serial storytelling where things change a little bit each episode, it's not just the boring, super repetitive thing.

926
00:45:58,873 --> 00:46:00,650
Scott: And as far as I know, I've never seen it.

927
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:04,070
Scott: There is an ending that like actually sort of wraps things up at the end.

928
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:07,509
Scott: It's not just, you know, monster of the week and then suddenly no more.

929
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:10,590
Rym: Oh, I learned some stuff from Wikipedia.

930
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,570
Rym: There's probably spoilers that I won't say, but yeah, I feel like I know spoilers of.

931
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:17,909
Rym: Oh, no, it only came out before I was born.

932
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:18,511
Scott: Yeah.

933
00:46:19,574 --> 00:46:29,130
Rym: So, yeah, all I want to say is if you have Crunchyroll, you should watch the first episode of this, if nothing else, because it will give you a lot of perspective.

934
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:42,170
Scott: Yeah, Voltron is a big enough property in the world of nerdery that even if you don't like it, even if you don't give a shit, even if you hate Mecca's of all kinds, you know, even if you hate anime's, you should watch some go line and maybe even some U.S.

935
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:47,450
Scott: Voltron, just so you have knowledge of this somewhat important nerd thing.

936
00:46:48,232 --> 00:46:49,830
Scott: And then if you don't like it, you don't watch anymore.

937
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:51,076
Scott: But, you know, it's like.

938
00:46:51,116 --> 00:46:53,290
Rym: it's like not everyone not everyone watches.

939
00:46:53,551 --> 00:46:57,110
Scott: It's just good to know about and maybe you'll like it and then watch more.

940
00:46:57,271 --> 00:46:59,130
Rym: Yeah, I liked it way more than I expected.

941
00:46:59,450 --> 00:46:59,875
Scott: I know, right.

942
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:00,989
Scott: It's like it's a yeah.

943
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:08,430
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

944
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:13,549
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Cat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

945
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:18,950
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

946
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,870
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

947
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:26,630
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

948

949
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:34,450
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

950
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,570
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

951
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:54,190
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are and I point out that Patreon appears to have decided to roll back that terrible change they were making on one dollar pledges, because frankly, one dollar pledges are the best pledges.

952
00:47:54,971 --> 00:48:00,930
Rym: So I wasn't sure what I was going to do about that, but it looks like I'm just going to double down on making Patreon content because I think they made the right decision.

953
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:02,790
Rym: I'll talk about that in the future.

954
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:38,729
Rym: But anyway, the Patreon patrons for this particular episode are Alan Joyce, Rebecca Dunn, Heidi McNichol, The Shimmering Ruby Obelisk, Hanging in the Sky, MyStady.com, Jeremy Monner, Jennie White, Bonafide, Electrified, Six Car Monorail, Cold Guy, Amanda Duchette, Sean Yeager, Matthew Smith, Nicholas Brandau, Captain Chinkawackasy, 421 Creations, No I Never Ever Wonder Why We're Here, Semper Fi, Bitch, Sherman Von Horrell, Rare Lavelle, James David White, Rochelle Montanona, Super White, Rym Says Something Funny Here, Sailor Vista, Don Shlick, Jartavish, and Jojo Joestar, Sam Cordery, Clinton Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Drew Openlander, Brian Cendroni, Finn, Chris Midkiff, Chris Knox, Daniel Redmond, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

955
00:48:39,311 --> 00:49:55,510
Rym: So now I leave you with... (singing in foreign language).
